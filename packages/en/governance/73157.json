Excellent monographs on\r\nPitt were given to the world by Lord Rosebery and Mr. Charles Whibley\r\nin the years 1891 and 1906, but they were too brief to admit of an\r\nadequate treatment of the masses of new materials relating to that\r\ncareer. Of late these have been greatly augmented by the inclusion\r\namong the national archives of the Pitt Manuscripts, which comprise\r\nthousands of letters and memoranda hitherto little used. In recent\r\nyears also the records of the Foreign Office and Home Office have\r\nbecome available for study, and at many points have yielded proofs of\r\nthe influence which Pitt exerted on the foreign and domestic policy of\r\nGreat Britain. Further, by the great kindness of the Countess Stanhope\r\nand Mr. E. G. Pretyman, M.P., I was enabled to utilize the Pitt\r\nManuscripts preserved at Chevening and Orwell Park; and both His Grace\r\nthe Duke of Portland and the Earl of Harrowby generously placed at my\r\ndisposal unpublished correspondence of Pitt with their ancestors. These\r\nnew sources render it necessary to reconstruct no small portion of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAmong recent publications bearing on this subject, the most important\r\nis that of “The Manuscripts of J. B. Fortescue, Esq.,” preserved at\r\nDropmore (Hist. MSS. Comm., 7 vols., 1892–1910), the seventh volume of\r\nwhich comprises details respecting the death of Pitt. This collection,\r\ncontaining many new letters of George III, Pitt, Lord Grenville,\r\nand British ambassadors, has proved of incalculable service. Many\r\nMemoirs, both English and foreign, have appeared of late. Among foreign\r\nhistorians who have dealt with this period, Sorel holds the first\r\nplace; but his narrative is often defective on English affairs, to\r\nwhich he gave too little attention. The recent monograph of Dr. Felix\r\nSalomon on the early part of Pitt’s career (Leipzig, 1901), and those\r\nof Herren Beer, Heidrich, Luckwaldt, Uhlmann, Vivenot, and Wittichen\r\non German affairs, have been of service, as well as those of Ballot,\r\nChassin, and Pallain on Anglo-French relations. The bias of Lecky\r\nagainst Pitt detracts somewhat from the value of the latter part of\r\nhis work, “England in the Eighteenth Century”; and I have been able to\r\nthrow new light on episodes which he treated inadequately.\r\n\r\nSometimes my narrative may seem to diverge far from the immediate\r\nincidents of the life of Pitt; but the enigmas in which it abounds can\r\nbe solved only by a study of the policy of his rivals or allies at\r\nParis, The Hague, Madrid, Vienna, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. These\r\nquestions have not received due attention from English students; for\r\nLecky did not treat the period 1793–1800 except in regard to Irish\r\naffairs. Accordingly, while by no means neglecting the private and\r\nsocial life of Pitt, I have sought in this volume to describe his\r\nachievements during the period dominated by Catharine of Russia, Joseph\r\nof Austria, and Mirabeau. That age is also memorable for political,\r\nfiscal, and social developments of high interest; and I have dealt\r\nwith them as fully as possible, often with the aid of new materials\r\ndrawn from Pitt’s papers. It being impossible to extend the limits of\r\nthis work, I ask the forbearance of specialists for not treating those\r\nproblems more fully. It is a biography, not a series of monographs; and\r\nI have everywhere sought to keep the figure of Pitt in the foreground.\r\nNew letters of George III, Pitt, Grenville, Windham, Burke, Canning,\r\netc., which could only be referred to here, will be published in a\r\nvolume entitled “Pitt and Napoleon Miscellanies,” containing also\r\nessays and notes.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank not only those whose generous assistance I have already\r\nacknowledged, but also Mr. Hubert Hall, of the Public Record Office,\r\nfor advice given during my researches; the Rev. William Hunt, D.Litt.,\r\nfor a thorough recension of the proofs of this work; the Masters\r\nof Trinity College and Peterhouse, Cambridge; Professor Firth, and\r\nMr. G. P. Gooch, M.A., for valued suggestions; the Ven. Archdeacon\r\nCunningham and Mr. Hewins for assistance on economic subjects; M.\r\nRaymond Guyot and Herr Doctor Luckwaldt for information on French\r\nand German affairs; also Mr. E. G. Pretyman, M.P., for permission to\r\nreproduce the portrait of the first Countess of Chatham; Mr. R. A.\r\nTatton, for similar permission to include Gainsborough’s portrait of\r\nWilliam Pitt; and last, but not least, Mr. A. M. Broadley for the\r\ncommunication of new letters relating to Pitt and his friends.\r\n\r\n                                                            J. H. R.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAP.

At\r\nthe close of 1783, during a crisis of singular intensity, he became\r\nChief Minister of the Crown, and thenceforth, with one short interval,\r\ncontrolled the destinies of Great Britain through twenty-two years\r\nmarked by grave complications, both political and financial, social and\r\ndiplomatic, ending in wars of unexampled magnitude. Early in the year\r\n1806 he died of exhaustion, at the age of forty-seven. In these bald\r\nstatements we may sum up the outstanding events of the life of William\r\nPitt the Younger, which it is my aim to describe somewhat in detail.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing his antecedents and the course of his early life, I\r\npropose to give some account of English affairs in the years when he\r\nentered on his career, so that we may picture him in his surroundings,\r\nrealize the nature of the difficulties that beset him, and, as it\r\nwere, feel our way along some of the myriad filaments which connect an\r\nindividual with the collective activities of his age.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt, Earl of Chatham, died in 1778. His second son, named\r\nafter him, began his political career at the close of the year 1780,\r\nwhen he was elected Member of Parliament for Appleby. The decade which\r\nthen began marks a turning point in British history. Then for the first\r\ntime the old self-contained life was shaken to its depths by forces of\r\nunsuspected power. Democracy, Athene-like, sprang to maturity in the\r\nNew World, and threatened the stability of thrones in the Old World.\r\nFor while this militant creed won its first triumphs over the soldiery\r\nof George III, it began also to colour the thoughts and wing the\r\naspirations of the masses, especially in France, so that, even if the\r\ntroops of Washington had been vanquished, the rising tide of thought\r\nwould none the less have swept away the outworn barriers of class. The\r\nmarch of armies may be stayed; that of thought never.\r\n\r\nThe speculations enshrined in the “Social Contract” of Rousseau and\r\nthe teachings of the Encyclopaedists contained much that was crude,\r\nor even false. Nevertheless, they gave an impulse such as no age ever\r\nhad known, and none perhaps ever will know again. The course of the\r\nAmerican War of Independence and the foundation of a State based on\r\ndistinctly democratic principles proved that the new doctrines might\r\nlead to very practical results. The young giant now stood rooted in\r\nmother-earth.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this portent in the world of thought and politics\r\nthere came about another change. Other centuries have witnessed\r\nexperiments in the direction of democracy; but in none have social\r\nspeculations and their results been so closely accompanied by\r\nmechanical inventions of wonder-working potency. Here we touch on the\r\nspecial characteristics of the modern world. It is the product of two\r\nRevolutions, one political, the other mechanical. The two movements\r\nbegan and developed side by side. In 1762 Rousseau gave to the world\r\nhis “Contrat Social,” the Bible of the French Revolutionists; while\r\nonly two years later Hargreaves, a weaver of Blackburn, produced his\r\nspinning-jenny. In 1769 Arkwright patented his spinning-frame, and\r\nWatt patented his separate condenser. The year 1776 is memorable alike\r\nfor the American Declaration of Independence, and for the publication\r\nof Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations.” In 1779 the Lancashire weaver,\r\nCrompton, produced his “mule-jenny,” a vast improvement on the machines\r\nof Arkwright and Hargreaves. The year 1785 witnessed not only the\r\nDiamond-Necklace scandal, so fatal to the prestige of the French\r\nmonarchy, but also the patenting of Watt’s double-acting steam-engine\r\nand Cartwright’s “power loom.” In the year 1789, which sounded the\r\nknell of the old order of things on the Continent, there appeared the\r\nfirst example of the modern factory, spinning-machinery being then\r\ndriven by steam power in Manchester. At the dawn of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when the democratic movement had for the time gone astray\r\nand spent its force, the triumphs of science and industry continued\r\npeacefully to revolutionize human life. In 1803, the year of the\r\nrenewal of war with France, William Radcliffe of Stockport greatly\r\nincreased the efficiency of the power loom, and thereby cheapened the\r\nproduction of cloth. Finally, the year 1814 ought to be remembered,\r\nnot only for the first abdication of Napoleon, but also for that\r\npeaceful and wholly beneficent triumph, George Stephenson’s “No. 1,”\r\nKillingworth locomotive.[1]\r\n\r\nThe list might be extended far beyond the limits of the period treated\r\nin this work, but enough has been said to show that the democratic and\r\nindustrial forces closely synchronized at the outset, and that while\r\nthe former waned the latter waxed more and more, proving in the years\r\n1830–2 the most potent ally of English reformers in efforts which Pitt\r\nand his friends had failed to carry through in the years 1780–5. So\r\nintimate an interaction of new and potent forces had never been seen\r\nin the history of man. In truth no one but a sciolist will venture\r\nto ascribe the problems of the present age solely to the political\r\nmovement which found its most powerful expression in the French\r\nRevolution. Only those can read aright the riddle of the modern sphinx\r\nwho have ears for both her tones, who hearken not only to the shouts of\r\nleaders and the roar of mobs, but also listen for the multitudinous hum\r\nof the workshop, the factory, and the mine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lot of William Pitt the Younger was cast in the years when both\r\nthese revolutions began their mighty work. The active part of his\r\nfather’s career fell within the old order of things; the problems which\r\nconfronted Chatham were merely political. They therefore presented\r\nnone of that complexity which so often baffled the penetration and\r\nforethought of his son. It is true that, with a prophetic vision of\r\nthe future, the old man foretold in thrilling words the invincibility\r\nof the American cause, but then his life-work was done; from his\r\nPisgah-mount he could only warn, and vainly warn, the dwellers in the\r\nplain below. His son was destined to enter that unknown land; and\r\nhe entered it when his people were burdened by debt, disaster, and\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nWhat were the material resources of the nation? Were they equal to\r\nthe strain imposed by a disastrous war? Could they resist the subtly\r\nwarping influences of the coming age? The questions closely concern\r\nus in our present inquiry. For the greatness of a statesman is not to\r\nbe assessed merely by an enumeration of his legislative, diplomatic,\r\nand warlike successes. There is a truer method of valuation than this\r\nhaphazard avoir-dupois. It consists in weighing his achievements\r\nagainst his difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt is well, therefore, to remember that the British people of the year\r\n1780 was a small and poor people, if we compare it not merely with\r\nmodern standards (a method fallacious for the present inquiry), but\r\nwith the burdens which it had to bear. The population of England and\r\nWales at that time has been computed a little over 7,800,000; that of\r\nScotland was perhaps about 1,400,000. That of Ireland is even less\r\nknown. The increase of population in England and Wales during the years\r\n1770–80 exceeded eight per cent., a rate less, indeed, than that of\r\nthe previous decade, which had been one of abounding prosperity, but\r\nsurpassing that of any previous period for which credible estimates can\r\nbe framed.[2]\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the nation seems also to have suffered little decline;\r\nand after the conclusion of peace in 1783 it showed a surprising\r\nelasticity owing to causes which will soon be considered. But in the\r\nyears 1780–3 there was a universal conviction that the burden of debt\r\nand taxation was unendurable. Parliament in 1781 voted the enormous\r\nsum of £25,353,857 for Ways and Means, an increase of £814,060 on the\r\nprevious year. As the finances and debt of Ireland were kept entirely\r\nseparate up to the end of the century, this burden fell upon some\r\n9,200,000 persons, and involved a payment of about £2 15s. per head, an\r\namount then deemed absolutely crushing.\r\n\r\nBut two important facts should be remembered: firstly, that the\r\ninvestments of British capital in oversea undertakings, which are\r\nnow enormous, were (apart from the British East and West Indies)\r\npractically non-existent in the year 1780, Great Britain being then\r\nan almost self-sufficing unit financially; secondly, that modern\r\nmethods of taxation are less expensive in the collection and less\r\nburdensome to the taxpayer than those prevalent in that non-scientific\r\nera. The revenue of 1781 included the following items: £12,480,000\r\nfor “Annuities and Lottery,” £2,788,000 for “Certain Surpluses of the\r\nSinking Fund,” £2,000,000 Bank Charter, and so on. Only about one\r\nfourth of the requisite amount was raised by means that would now be\r\nconsidered sound.[3]\r\n\r\nThe National Debt was then reckoned at £177,206,000; and the annual\r\ninterest, amounting to £6,812,000, ate up considerably more than one\r\nfourth of the “bloated estimates” of that year. The burden of debt\r\nseemed appalling to that generation; and the Three per cent. Consols\r\nsank from 60¼ in January 1781 to 55 in November. But further blows were\r\nsoon to be dealt by Ministers at the nation’s credit; and the same\r\nstock ranged between 56 and 58 when William Pitt became Prime Minister\r\nin December 1783. Predictions of national bankruptcy were freely\r\nindulged in; and it should be remembered that Great Britain, vanquished\r\nby a mighty Coalition and bereft of her most valuable colonies, seemed\r\nfar more likely to sink into the gulf of bankruptcy than triumphant\r\nFrance. The events of the next six years turned essentially on the\r\nmanagement of the finances of the rival Powers by Pitt and by the\r\nControllers-General of Versailles. Apart from the personal questions\r\nat issue, the history of that time affords the most instructive proof\r\nthat victory may bear within itself the seeds of future disease and\r\ncollapse; while a wise use of the lessons of adversity may lead the\r\nvanquished to a lease of healthier life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we turn our gaze away from the material resources of Great Britain\r\nto the institutions and sentiments of our forefathers, there will\r\nappear many bizarre contrasts and perplexing symptoms. At first sight\r\nthe self-contained, unreceptive, torpid society of the Georgian era\r\nmight appear to be wholly unfitted to bear the triple strain of a\r\nserious national disaster, and of the warping influences of the new\r\ndemocracy and the new industrialism. The situation was indeed most\r\nalarming: “What a dismal fragment of an Empire!” wrote Horace Walpole\r\nin June 1780, “Yet would that moment were come when we are to take\r\na survey of our ruins.” In truth, had the majority of Britons been\r\naddicted to morbidly introspective broodings, they would have been\r\nundone. There are times when a nation is saved by sheer stolidity; and\r\nthis characteristic alike in monarch and people, which was responsible\r\nfor the prolongation of the war, helped to avert collapse at its close.\r\nThe course of the narrative will show that the brains of Englishmen\r\nwere far from equal to the task of facing the problems of the age\r\nthen dawning; but Englishmen were equal to the task of bearing the\r\nwar-burdens manfully, and thus were able to supply the material out of\r\nwhich Pitt, aided by the new manufacturing forces, could work financial\r\nmarvels.\r\n\r\nThen again, British institutions offered that happy mixture of firmness\r\nand adaptability which at many crises has been the salvation of the\r\nrace. Had they been as rigid as those of Sparta they must have cracked\r\nand fallen asunder; had they been as fluid as those of Athens they\r\nmight have mouldered away. But, like the structure of English society\r\nof which they form the framework, they lend themselves to reverent\r\nrestoration, and thwart all efforts at reckless innovation. Sir Henry\r\nMaine happily assessed the worth of this truly national safeguard\r\nin the statement that our institutions had, however undesignedly,\r\narrived at a state in which satisfaction and impatience, the chief\r\nsources of political conduct, were adequately called into play. Of this\r\nself-adjusting process Pitt, at least during the best years of his\r\ncareer, was to be the sage director.\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons why Englishmen should be a prey alternately to\r\nfeelings of satisfaction and discontent. Instinct and tradition bade\r\nthem be loyal to the throne and to the institutions of their fathers.\r\nReason and reflection bade them censure the war policy of George III\r\nand the means whereby he sought to carry it through to the bitter\r\nend. St. Stephen’s, Westminster, had been the shrine of the nation’s\r\nliberties; it now, so Burke declared, threatened them with a slow and\r\ninglorious extinction. Obedience to the laws had ever been the pride of\r\nthe nation; but now that virtue might involve subservience to a corrupt\r\nand greedy faction.\r\n\r\nYet however great the provocations, Britons were minded to right these\r\nwrongs in their own way, and not after the fashions set at Geneva or\r\nParis. In truth they had one great advantage denied to Continental\r\nreformers. At Paris reform almost necessarily implied innovation; for,\r\ndespite the dictum of Burke to the contrary, it is safe to say that the\r\nrelics of the old constitution of France offered no adequate basis on\r\nwhich to reconstruct her social and political fabric. In England the\r\nfoundations and the walls were in good repair. The structure needed\r\nmerely extension, not rebuilding. Moreover, British reformers were by\r\nnature and tradition inclined towards tentative methods and rejected\r\nwholesale schemes. Even in the dull years of George II the desire for\r\na Reform of Parliament was not wholly without expression; and now, at\r\nthe time of the American War, the desire became a demand, which nearly\r\nachieved success. In fact, the Reform programme of 1780 satisfied the\r\naspirations of the more moderate men, even in the years 1791–4, when\r\nthe excitements of the French Revolution, and the writings of Thomas\r\nPaine for a time popularized the levelling theories then in vogue at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nCertainly, before the outbreak of the French Revolution, the writings\r\nof Continental thinkers had little vogue in Great Britain. The “Social\r\nContract” of Rousseau was not widely known, and its most noteworthy\r\ntheses, despite the fact that they were borrowed from Hobbes and Locke,\r\naroused no thrill of sympathy. This curious fact may be explained by\r\nthe innate repugnance of the islanders alike to the rigidly symmetrical\r\nform in which the Genevese prophet clothed his dogmas, and to the\r\nJacobins’ claim for them of universal applicability. The very qualities\r\nwhich carried conviction to the ardent and logic-loving French awakened\r\ndoubts among the cooler northern folk.\r\n\r\nThen again, however sharp might be the resentment against George\r\nIII for this or that action, national sentiment ran strongly in the\r\ntraditional channels. After the collapse of the Stuart cause loyalty\r\nto the throne and to the dynasty was the dominant feeling among all\r\nclasses. As Burke finely said of the Tories after the accession\r\nof George III, “they changed their idol but they preserved their\r\nidolatry.” The personality of George III was such as to help on this\r\ntransformation. A certain _bonhomie_, as of an English squire, set off\r\nby charm of manner and graciousness of speech,[4] none too common in\r\nthat class, went to the hearts of all who remembered the outlandish\r\nways of the first two Georges. Furthermore, his morals were distinctly\r\nmore reputable than theirs, as was seen at the time of his youth,\r\nwhen he withstood the wiles strewn in his path by several ladies of\r\nthe Court with a frankness worthy of the Restoration times.[5] His\r\ngood sense, straightforwardness, and his love of country life and\r\nof farming endeared him both to the masses of the people and to the\r\nmore select circles which began to learn from Versailles the cult of\r\nRousseau and the charms of butter making. Queen Charlotte, a princess\r\nof the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, also set her face against vice\r\nand extravagance, but in a primly austere manner which won few to the\r\ncause of virtue. Domesticity in her ceased to be alluring. Idle tongues\r\nwagged against her even when she sought to encourage the wearing of\r\ndresses woven in Spitalfields rather than those of ever-fashionable\r\nParis; or again, when she prohibited the wearing of ostrich feathers at\r\nCourt.[6]\r\n\r\nThe reader will fail to understand the political life of that time\r\nand the difficulties often besetting Pitt until he grasps the fact\r\nthat George III not only reigned but governed. His long contest\r\nwith the Whig factions left him victor; and it is singular that the\r\nshortsightedness of the elder Pitt signally aided the King in breaking\r\nup their power. Both of them aimed at overthrowing the supremacy of the\r\nold Whig families, but it was George III who profited by the efforts\r\nof the Earl of Chatham.[7] The result was seen in the twelve years\r\nof almost personal rule (1770–82), during which Lord North and the\r\nwell-fed phalanx of the King’s Friends bade fair to make the House of\r\nCommons the mere instrument of the royal will. The King’s influence,\r\nimpaired for a time by the disasters of the American War, asserted\r\nitself again at the time of the Lord George Gordon Riots in June 1780.\r\nThat outbreak of bigotry and rascality for a time paralyzed with fear\r\nboth Ministers and magistrates; but while all around him faltered,\r\nGeorge III held firm and compelled the authorities to act.[8] The\r\nriots were quelled, but not before hundreds of drunken desperadoes had\r\nperished in the flames which they had kindled. Those who saw large\r\nparts of London ablaze long retained a feeling of horror at all popular\r\nmovements, and looked upon George III as the saviour of society. This\r\nit was, in part, which enabled him to retain his influence scarcely\r\nimpaired even by the disasters of the American War. The monarchy stood\r\nmore firmly rooted than at any time since the reign of Queen Anne.\r\nJacobitism survived among a few antiquated Tories, like Dr. Johnson, as\r\na pious belief or a fashionable affectation; but even in the year 1763\r\nthe lexicographer, after receiving a pension from George III, avowed\r\nto Boswell that the pleasure of cursing the House of Hanover and of\r\ndrinking King James’s health was amply overbalanced by an income of\r\nthree hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAs a sign of the reality of the royal power, we may note that public\r\naffairs were nearly at a stand-still at the time of the lunacy of\r\nGeorge III (November 1788 to February 1789). The following Foreign\r\nOffice despatch, sent to the British Ambassador at Berlin at a critical\r\ntime in our diplomatic relations, shows that Pitt and the Foreign\r\nSecretary, the Marquis of Carmarthen, considered themselves the King’s\r\nSecretaries of State, and unable to move until the royal will was known:\r\n\r\n                                          Whitehall, January 6 1789.\r\n\r\n    TO MR. EWART,\r\n\r\n    SIR,\r\n\r\n    I have received your letters up to No. 93, but I have not any\r\n    commands to convey to you at present, the unhappy situation of His\r\n    Majesty’s health making it impossible for me to lay them before\r\n    him. The present situation of this country renders it impossible\r\n    for me to send you any particular or precise instructions. I trust,\r\n    however, that the system for supplying the present unfortunate\r\n    interruption in the executive part of the Government will be\r\n    speedily completed, at least with as little delay as the importance\r\n    of the object will admit of, and which, being once more formed,\r\n    will of course restore that part of the Constitution to its usual\r\n    energy and effect.[9]\r\n\r\nEwart and our other ambassadors were therefore urged to mark time as\r\nenergetically as might be; and no orders were sent to them until after\r\n17th February 1789, when the King began to recover.\r\n\r\nAt ordinary times, then, the King’s authority was looked upon as\r\nessential to the working of the Government, a fact which explains the\r\neager interest, even of men not place-hunters, in the Regency disputes\r\nof 1788–9. In truth, the monarchy was the central fact of the nation’s\r\nlife; and, as it acquired stedfastness from the personal popularity\r\nof George III, the whole of the edifice had a solidity unknown in the\r\nyears 1680–1760.[10]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMontesquieu praised the English constitution as providing without undue\r\nfriction a balance of power between King, Lords, and Commons. This\r\njudgment (penned in 1748) still held good, though the royal authority\r\nhad in the meantime certainly increased. But the power of the nobles\r\nwas still very great. They largely controlled the House of Commons. The\r\nLowthers secured the election of 11 Members in the Lake District; and\r\nthrough the whole country 71 Peers were able directly to nominate, and\r\nsecure the election of, 88 commoners, while they powerfully influenced\r\nthe return of 72 more. If we include all landowners, whether titled on\r\nuntitled, it appears that they had the power to nominate 487 members\r\nout of the 658 who formed the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn these days, when the thought and activities of the towns overbear\r\nthose of the country districts, we cry out against a system that\r\ndesignedly placed power in the hands of nobles and squires. But we must\r\nremember that the country then far outweighed the towns in importance;\r\nthat the produce of the soil was far more valuable than all the\r\nmanufactures; and that stability and stolidity are the characteristics\r\nof an ancient society, based on agriculture and reared in Feudalism.\r\nIf we except that metropolitan orgy, the Wilkes’ affair, London and\r\nWestminster were nearly as torpid politically as Dorset. Even in\r\nthe year 1791 the populace of Manchester and Birmingham blatantly\r\nexulted in a constitution which left them without any direct voice\r\nin Parliament. It was in the nature of things that Grampound, Old\r\nSarum, Gatton, and Castle Rising should return eight members; the\r\nchoice of the Tudor Sovereigns had lit upon those hamlets or villages\r\nas test-places for consulting the will of the nation, and the nation\r\nacquiesced, because, even if Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, and\r\nSheffield had enjoyed that privilege, they would probably have sent\r\nup country gentlemen of the same type, and after a far greater output\r\nof money and beer. Where the will of the nation is almost entirely\r\nhomogeneous there is no injustice in selecting representatives by the\r\nhaphazard methods then in use.\r\n\r\nStrong in their control of Parliament, the nobles sought to hem in\r\nthe throne by meshes of influence through which even the masterful\r\nand pertinacious George III could with difficulty break. Their circle\r\nwas small. True, they had failed in their effort of 1719 to limit the\r\nnumber of creations at any one time to six; but jealousy had almost\r\nthe force of law. Ultimately we find George III declining to confer\r\na dukedom on any but princes of the blood, and Pitt incurred the\r\ndispleasure of his cousin, Earl Temple, because he failed to bend the\r\nroyal will on that question. The need of caution in respect to the\r\ngranting of titles may be inferred from the Pitt Papers, no small part\r\nof which refer to requests for these honours. Pitt has been reproached\r\nwith his lavish use of this governmental device, for he created about\r\n140 peerages in the years 1783–1801. I have, however, found proofs that\r\nhe used it reluctantly. In the Pitt Papers are several letters which\r\nthe statesman wrote refusing requests for peerages. On this matter, as\r\nalso with regard to places and appointments, he treated any attempt at\r\nbargaining with cold disdain, witness this crushing reply to an Irish\r\npeer who, in September 1799, applied for a British peerage: “... There\r\nis a passage in the conclusion of your Lordship’s letter on which it is\r\nimpossible for me not to remark that it appears to convey an intimation\r\nwith respect to what may be your political conduct, which would at\r\nall events induce me to decline being the channel of bringing your\r\napplication before His Majesty.”[11]\r\n\r\nBut rebukes and refusals seem to have made little impression on\r\nthat generation, imbued as it was with a deep-seated belief that the\r\nvictors had a right to the spoils and should apportion them among their\r\nfollowers according to rank and usefulness. The whole matter was spoken\r\nof under the convenient euphemism “influence,” which, when used in a\r\npolitical sense, denoted the secret means for assuring the triumph of\r\nthe Crown and the reward of the faithful. While not implying actual\r\nbribery, it signified persuasion exerted through peerages, places,\r\nand pensions. According to this scheme of things, strenuous support\r\nof “the King’s cause” would earn a title, a bishopric, a judgeship,\r\nor a receivership in the customs or excise. These allurements offered\r\nirresistible attractions in an age which offered far fewer means of\r\nindependent advancement than the present. With the exception of those\r\nstrange persons who preferred to make their own way in life, men of\r\nall classes had their eyes fixed on some longed-for perch above them,\r\nand divided their attention between the symptoms of decay in its\r\noccupant and the signs of the favour of its patron. The expectant part\r\nof Society resembled a gigantic hen-roost at the approach of evening,\r\nexcept that the aspirations upward were not signs of quiescence but\r\nof ill-suppressed unrest. Those who delve among the confidential\r\nletters of that time must often picture the British nation as a\r\nmountain-climber. Perhaps one sixth part of Pitt’s time was taken up in\r\nreading and answering requests of bewildering variety. College friends\r\ndunned him with requests for preferment, with or without cure of souls.\r\nRectors longed to be canons; canons to be deans; deans to be bishops;\r\nand wealthy bishops coveted sinecure deaneries, among which, curiously\r\nenough, that of London was the greatest prize. The infection spread to\r\nall classes. Gaugers of beer longed to be collectors of His Majesty’s\r\nrevenue; faithful grooms confidently expected a gaugership; and elderly\r\nfishermen, who in their day had intercepted smugglers, demanded, as of\r\nright, the post of harbourmaster. A Frenchman once defended the old\r\n_régime_ on the ground that it ranged all classes about the King in\r\ndue gradations of privilege. Similarly Britons of their own free will\r\ngrouped themselves around the throne on steps of expectancy.\r\n\r\nA curious example of the motives which led to influential requests for\r\npreferment in the Church is to be found in the correspondence of the\r\nMarquis of Carmarthen (afterwards Duke of Leeds), who was at that time\r\nForeign Secretary under Pitt. His letter to his chief may speak for\r\nitself:\r\n\r\n    _Private._\r\n\r\n                                 Grosvenor Square, Nov. 13 1787.[12]\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    I fear it will not be in my power to return to Hollwood to-day, by\r\n    which I shall be prevented from so soon troubling you _viva voce_\r\n    with the only subject I do not like to converse with you upon,\r\n    viz., asking for Preferment. But my anxiety for my friend Jackson,\r\n    and understanding that the Bishopric of Chester is not yet given\r\n    away, will, I hope, plead my excuse to you for asking it for him,\r\n    and perhaps you may forgive me adding that from local circumstances\r\n    that preferment in his hands would be particularly agreeable to me,\r\n    on account of a large part of my northern property being situated\r\n    in the Diocese of Chester. I do assure you that a compliance with\r\n    this request would make me truly happy.\r\n\r\n                                                 Believe me, etc.\r\n                                                         CARMARTHEN.\r\n\r\nReverting to matters which are purely secular, we may note that in the\r\nyear 1783, at the time of Pitt’s assumption of power, the number of\r\nEnglish peers was comparatively small, namely about 240, and of these\r\n15, being Roman Catholics, could not sit in Parliament.[13]\r\n\r\nThis select aristocracy was preserved from some of the worst evils\r\nincident to its station by healthful contact with men and affairs.\r\nThe reversion of its younger sons to the rank of commoners prevented\r\nthe formation of the huge caste of nobles, often very poor but\r\nalways intensely proud, which crusted over the surface of society in\r\nContinental lands; and again, the infusion of commoners (generally the\r\nablest governors, soldiers, and lawyers of the age) preserved the Order\r\nfrom intellectual stagnation such as had crept over the old _noblesse_\r\nof France. Both the downward and the upward streams kept the mass free\r\nfrom that decay which sooner or later besets every isolated body.\r\nNor did the British aristocracy enjoy those flagrant immunities from\r\ntaxation which were the curse of French social and political life.\r\n\r\nBut let us view this question in a more searching light. Montesquieu\r\nfinely observes that an aristocracy may maintain its full vigour, if\r\nthe laws be such as will habituate the nobles more to the perils and\r\nfatigues, than to the pleasures, of command.[14] In this respect the\r\nBritish aristocracy ran some risk of degeneration. It is true that\r\nits members took an active part in public business. Their work in the\r\nHouse of Lords was praiseworthy. The debates there, if less exciting\r\nthan those of the Commons, bear signs of experience, wisdom, dignity,\r\nand self-restraint, which were often lacking in the Lower House. The\r\nnobles also took a large share in the executive duties of the State.\r\nNot only did they and their younger sons fill most of the public\r\noffices, including the difficult, and often thankless, diplomatic\r\nposts, but they were active in their counties and on their estates, as\r\nlords-lieutenant, sheriffs, and magistrates. The days had not yet come\r\nwhen “Society” fled from the terrors of the English winter. For the\r\nmost part nobles spent the parliamentary vacations at their country\r\nseats, sharing in the duties and sports which from immemorial times\r\nhad knit our folk into a compact and sturdy whole. Yet we may question\r\nwhether the pleasures of command did not then far exceed its perils\r\nand fatigues. Apart from the demoralizing struggle for higher honours,\r\nthere were hosts of court and parliamentary sinecures to excite\r\ncupidity and encourage laziness. The rush after emoluments and pleasure\r\nbecame keener than ever after the glorious peace of 1763, and a perusal\r\nof the letters addressed to any statesman of the following age must\r\nawaken a doubt whether public life was less corrupt than at the time of\r\nWalpole.\r\n\r\nThen, again, in the making and working of laws, the privileges of the\r\nnobles and gentry were dangerously large. Throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury those classes strengthened their grip both on Parliament and\r\non the counties and parishes. Up to the year 1711 no definite property\r\nqualification was required from members of Parliament; but in that year\r\na law was passed limiting the right of representing counties to those\r\nwho owned land worth £600 a year; and a rental of half that sum was\r\nexpected from members of boroughs. This was equivalent to shutting out\r\nmerchants and manufacturers, who were often Dissenters, from the county\r\nrepresentation; and the system of pocket boroughs further enabled\r\nlandowners to make a careful choice in the case of a large part of the\r\nmembers of towns. Again, the powers of the magistrates, or justices of\r\nthe peace, in the affairs of the parish, were extraordinarily large.\r\nA French writer, M. Boutmy, computes them as equalling those of the\r\n_préfet_, the _conseil d’arrondissement_, the _maire_, the _commissaire\r\nde police_, and the _juge de paix_, of the French local government of\r\nto-day. Of course the Shallows of Pitt’s time did not fulfil these\r\nmanifold duties at all systematically; for that would be alien to the\r\nhaphazard ways of the squires and far beyond their talents. Local\r\ndespotism slumbered as much as it worked; and just as the Armenians\r\nprefer the fitful barbarities of the Turks to the ever-grinding\r\npressure of the Russian bureaucracy, so the villagers of George III’s\r\nreign may have been no more oppressed than those of France and Italy\r\nare by a system fruitful in good works and jobs, in officials and\r\ntaxes. On this point it is impossible to dogmatize; for the Georgian\r\npeasantry was dumb until the years after Waterloo, when Cobbett began\r\nto voice its feelings.\r\n\r\nThe use of the term “despotism” for the rule of the squires is no\r\nexaggeration. They were despots in their own domains. Appeals against\r\nthe rulings of the local magistrates were always costly and generally\r\nfutile. It was rare to find legal advisers at their side; and the\r\nunaided wits of local landowners decided on all the lesser crimes (many\r\nof them punishable with death at the assizes) and the varied needs of\r\nthe district. With the justices of the peace it lay to nominate the\r\nguardians of the poor and “visitors,” who supervised the relief of\r\nthe poor in the new unions of parishes resulting from Gilbert’s Act\r\nof 1782. The working of the Draconian game-laws was entirely in their\r\nhands, and that, too, in days when the right of sporting with firearms\r\nwas limited to owners of land worth £100 a year. Finally, lest there\r\nshould be any community of sentiment between the bench and the dock,\r\nat the oft-recurring trials for poaching, the same land and money test\r\nwas applied to all applicants for the honoured post of magistrate.\r\nThe country gentlemen ruled the parish and they virtually ruled the\r\nnation.[15] The fact was proclaimed with characteristic insolence\r\nby the Lord Justice Clerk, Macqueen of Braxfield, in his address to\r\nthe jury at the close of the trial of Thomas Muir for sedition, at\r\nEdinburgh in August 1793: “A Government in every country should be just\r\nlike a Corporation; and in this Country it is made up of the landed\r\ninterest, which alone has a right to be represented. As for the rabble,\r\nwho have nothing but personal property, what hold has the nation upon\r\nthem? What security for the payment of their taxes? They may pack\r\nup all their property on their backs and leave the country in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye. But landed property cannot be removed.”[16] The\r\nScottish nobles, especially in the Highlands, still claimed extensive\r\nrights over their vassals; and several of them made patriotic use of\r\nthese powers in raising regiments during the great war with France.\r\nThomas Graham, afterwards Lord Lynedoch, is the best known example of\r\nthis feudal influence.[17]\r\n\r\nIn many districts the squires received unwelcome but powerful support\r\nfrom “nabobs.” Those decades witnessed a steady flight homewards of\r\nIndian officials, for the most part gorged with plunder. They became\r\nan appreciable force in politics. Reckless of expense so long as they\r\ncould enter the charmed circle of the higher gentry, they adopted\r\nthe politics and aped the ways of their betters; so that many a\r\ncountryside felt the influence of their greed and ostentation. The\r\nyeomen and villagers were the victims of their land-hunger; while the\r\nsmall squires (so says Grose in his Olio of the year 1792) often fell\r\nin the course of the feverish race for display. As the Roman moralist\r\ninveighed against the influx of Syrian ways into the life of his city,\r\nso too might Johnson have thundered at the blending of the barbaric\r\nprofusion of the Orient with the primal simplicity of the old English\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, however, that life still showed the tenacity that\r\nmarks our race. Certainly in Court circles there were no signs of the\r\nadvent of commercialism, still less of democracy. The distinctions\r\nof rank in England seemed very strict, even to a German, who was\r\naccustomed to the formalities of the Hanoverian and Rhenish Courts.\r\nCount von Kielmansegge in 1761 noted the precision of etiquette at\r\nthe State balls: “Rank in England is decided exclusively according to\r\nclass, and not according to service; consequently the duchesses dance\r\nfirst, then marchionesses, then dukes’ daughters, then countesses.\r\nForeigners had no rank at all in England, so they may not dance before\r\nthe lords and barons.... For this reason foreigners seldom dance at\r\nCourt.” It was not etiquette for the King and Queen to dance at the\r\nstate balls; but, even so, the formalism of those functions must have\r\nbeen pyramidal. The same spirit of formality, fortified by a nice sense\r\nof the gradations of rank, appears in the rules of a county club at\r\nDerby, where the proceedings seem to have been modelled on the sun and\r\nplanets, the latter being always accompanied by inferior satellites.[18]\r\n\r\nThe customs of the _beau monde_ in London were regulated by one\r\nall-absorbing preoccupation, that of killing time in a gentlemanly and\r\ngraceful manner. Fielding, in his “Joseph Andrews,” thus maps out the\r\nday of a fop about the middle of the century:\r\n\r\n    In the morning I rose, took my great stick, and walked out in my\r\n    green frock, with my hair in papers, and sauntered about till ten.\r\n    Went to the Auction; told Lady B. she had a dirty face, laughed\r\n    heartily at something Captain G. said (I can’t remember what, for\r\n    I did not very well hear it), whispered to Lord ----, bowed to the\r\n    Duke of ----, and was going to bid for a snuff-box, but did not,\r\n    for fear I should have had it. From 2 to 4 dressed myself; 4 to 6\r\n    dined; 6 to 8 coffee-house; 8 to 9 Drury Lane Playhouse; 10 to 12\r\n    Drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of West End life given by Moritz, a Prussian pastor who\r\nvisited England in 1782, is very similar, but he enters into more\r\ndetail. He describes fashionable people as walking about all the\r\nmorning in a _négligé_ attire, “your hair not dressed but merely rolled\r\nup in rollers, and in a frock and boots.” The morning lasted till\r\nfour or five o’clock, then the fashionable time for dinner. The most\r\nusual dress in that summer was a coat of very dark blue, a short white\r\nwaistcoat, and white silk stockings. Black was worn for full dress,\r\nand Moritz noticed that the English seemed to prefer dark colours.\r\nDress seemed to him to be one of the chief aims and occupations of our\r\npeople; and he remarked on the extraordinary vogue which everything\r\nFrench then enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to pause here and dwell on the singular fact that, at\r\nthe time when England and France were still engaged in deadly strife,\r\neach people should be intent on copying the customs and fashions\r\nof the other. The decade of the “eighties” witnessed the growth of\r\n“Anglomania” to ridiculous proportions in France; while here the\r\ngoverning class thought it an unfailing proof of good breeding to trick\r\nout every other sentence with a French phrase. Swift alone could have\r\ndone justice to the irony of a situation wherein two great nations\r\nwasted their resources in encompassing one another’s ruin, while every\r\nday their words and actions bore striking witness to their admiration\r\nof the hereditary foe. Is it surprising that Pitt should have used all\r\nhis efforts in 1786 to bring about an _entente cordiale_ on the basis\r\nof the common interests of the two peoples?\r\n\r\nTo revert to our theme: the frivolities and absurdities of Mayfair,\r\nwhich figure so largely in the diaries and letters of the period,\r\nprobably filled a smaller space in the life of the nation than we\r\nare apt to infer from those sources. Moritz, who had an eye for the\r\nhomely as well as the courtly side of life, noticed the good qualities\r\nwhich kept the framework of society sound. He remarked that in London,\r\noutside the Court circles, the customs were plain and domestic, the\r\npeople generally dined about three o’clock, and worked hard.[19] His\r\ntour on foot through the Midlands also gave him the impression that\r\nEngland enjoyed a well-balanced prosperity. He was everywhere pitied or\r\ndespised, it being assumed that a pedestrian must be a tramp. There can\r\nbe little doubt that even at the end of that disastrous war, our land\r\nwas far more prosperous than any of the States of North Germany.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the proud islanders was nowhere more obvious than at\r\nthe chief pleasure resorts of Londoners, Vauxhall and Ranelagh. These\r\ngardens and promenades impressed Moritz greatly, and he pronounced the\r\nscene at the rotunda at Ranelagh the most brilliant which he had ever\r\nwitnessed: “The incessant change of faces, the far greater number of\r\nwhich were strikingly beautiful, together with the illumination, the\r\nextent and majestic splendour of the place, with the continued sound\r\nof the music, makes an inconceivably delightful impression.” Thanks to\r\nthe curiosity of the Prussian pastor, we can look down with him on the\r\ngay throng, and discern the princes, lords, and knights, their stars\r\nfar outshining all the commoners present; we see also a difference in\r\nthe styles of wearing the hair, the French queues and bags contrasting\r\nmarkedly with plain English heads of hair or professional wigs. Most\r\nof the company moved in “an eternal circle, to see and to be seen”;\r\nothers stood near to enjoy the music; others again regaled themselves\r\nat the tables with the excellent fare provided for the inclusive sum\r\nof half-a-crown; while a thoughtful minority gazed from the gallery\r\nand moralized on the scene. The display and extravagance evidently\r\nsurprised Moritz, as it surprises us when we remember that it was at\r\nthe close of a ruinous war. In the third year of the struggle, the\r\nmercurial Horace Walpole deplored the universal distress, and declared\r\nthat when he sat in his “blue window,” he missed nine out of ten of\r\nthe lordly chariots that used to roll before it. Yet, in the seventh\r\nyear, when the half of Europe had entered the lists against the Island\r\nPower, the Prussian pastor saw nothing but affluence and heard nothing\r\nthat did not savour of a determined and sometimes boastful patriotism.\r\nAt Ranelagh he observed that everyone wore silk stockings, and he\r\nwas informed that even poor people when they visited that abode of\r\nsplendour, dressed so as to copy the great, and always hired a coach in\r\norder to draw up in state at the entrance.[20]\r\n\r\nRanelagh and Vauxhall, we may note in passing, were beyond the\r\nconfines of the London of 1780. The city of Westminster was but slowly\r\nencroaching on Tothill Fields; and the Queen’s House, standing on the\r\nsite of the present Buckingham Palace, commanded an uninterrupted view\r\nwestwards over the fields and market gardens spreading out towards the\r\nlittle village of Chelsea. On the south of the Thames there was a mere\r\nfringe of houses from the confines of Southwark to the Archbishop’s\r\npalace at Lambeth; and revellers returning from Vauxhall, whether by\r\nriver or road, were not seldom sobered by visits from footpads, or the\r\neven more dreaded Mohawks. Further afield everything was completely\r\nrural. Trotter, Fox’s secretary, describes the statesman as living\r\namidst bowers vocal with song-birds at St. Ann’s Hill, Wandsworth;\r\nand Pitt, in his visits to Wilberforce or Dundas at Wimbledon, would\r\nprobably pass not a score of houses between Chelsea and the little\r\nold wooden bridge at Putney. That village and Wimbledon stood in the\r\nsame relation to London as Oxshott and Byfleet occupy to-day. North\r\nof Chelsea there was the hamlet of Knightsbridge, and beyond it the\r\nvillages of Paddington and “Marybone.”\r\n\r\nAs Hyde Park Corner marked the western limit of London, so Bedford\r\nHouse and its humbler neighbour, the British Museum, bounded it on\r\nthe north. The Foundling Hospital stood in open fields. St. Pancras,\r\nIslington Spa, and Sadler’s Wells were rivals of Epsom and Tunbridge\r\nWells. Clerkenwell Church was the fashionable place for weddings for\r\nthe richer citizens who dwelt in the northern suburbs opened up by\r\nthe new City Road completed in 1761. On the east, London ended at\r\nWhitechapel, though houses straggled on down the Mile End Road. The\r\namount of the road-borne traffic is curiously illustrated by the fact\r\nthat the Metropolis possessed only three bridges, London Bridge,\r\nWestminster Bridge, and Blackfriars Bridge; and not till the year 1763\r\ndid the City Fathers demolish the old houses standing on London Bridge\r\nwhich rendered it impossible for two carts to pass. Already, however,\r\nsuburbs were spreading along the chief roads out of London. In the\r\n“Connoisseur” of September 1754 is a pleasingly ironical account of\r\na week-end visit to the villa of a London tradesman, situated in the\r\ndesolate fields near Kennington Common, from the windows of which one\r\nhad a view of criminals hanging from gibbets and St. Paul’s cupola\r\nenveloped in smoke.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Englishman’s love of the country tended to drive\r\nLondoners out to the dull little suburbs around the Elephant and\r\nCastle, or beyond Tyburn or Clerkenwell; and thus, in the closing years\r\nof the century, there arose that dualism of interests (city versus\r\nsuburbs) which weakens the civic and social life of the metropolis.\r\nA further consequence was the waning in popularity of Vauxhall and\r\nRanelagh, as well as of social clubs in general. These last had\r\nfurnished a very desirable relief to the monotony of a stay-at-home\r\nexistence. But the club became less necessary when the family lived\r\nbeyond the river or at “Marybone,” and when the merchant spent much\r\ntime on horseback every day in passing from his office to his villa.\r\nAnother cause for the decline of clubs of the old type is doubtless\r\nto be found in the distress caused by the Revolutionary War, and\r\nin the increasing acerbity of political discussions after the year\r\n1790. Hitherto clubs had been almost entirely devoted to relaxation\r\nor conviviality. A characteristic figure of Clubland up to the year\r\n1784 had been Dr. Johnson, thundering forth his dicta and enforcing\r\nthem with thumps on the table. The next generation cared little for\r\nconversation as a fine art; and men drifted off to clubs where either\r\nloyalty or freedom was the dominant idea. The political arena, which\r\nfor two generations had been the scene of confused scrambles between\r\ngreedy factions, was soon to be cleared for that deadliest of all\r\nstruggles, a war of principles. In that sterner age the butterfly life\r\nof Ranelagh became a meaningless anomaly.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, no one in England dreamt of any such change.\r\nThe spirit of the nation, far from sinking under the growing burdens of\r\nthe American War, seemed buoyant. Sensitive _littérateurs_ like Horace\r\nWalpole might moan over the ruin of the Empire; William Pitt might\r\ndeclaim against its wickedness with all his father’s vehemence; but\r\nthe nation for the most part plodded doggedly on in the old paths and\r\nrecked little of reform, except in so far as it concerned the abolition\r\nof sinecures and pensions. In 1779–80 County Associations were founded\r\nin order to press on the cause of “œconomical reform”; but most of\r\nthem expired by the year 1784. Alike in thought and in customs England\r\nseemed to be invincibly Conservative.\r\n\r\nThe reasons, other than racial and climatic, for the stolidity of\r\nGeorgian England would seem to be these. Any approach to enthusiasm,\r\nwhether in politics or religion, had been tabooed as dangerous ever\r\nsince the vagaries of the High Church party in the reign of Anne\r\nhad imperilled the Protestant Succession; and far into the century,\r\nespecially after the adventure of “Bonnie Prince Charlie,” all leanings\r\ntowards romance were looked on as a reflection on the safe and solid\r\nHouse of Brunswick. Prudence was the first of political virtues, and\r\ncommon sense the supreme judge of creeds and conduct.\r\n\r\nExternal events also favoured the triumph of the commonplace, which is\r\nso obvious in the Georgian literature and architecture. The call of\r\nthe sea and the influence of the New World were no longer inspirations\r\nto mighty deeds. The age of adventure was past, and the day of company\r\npromoters and slave-raiders had fully dawned. Commerce of an almost\r\nPunic type ruled the world. Whereas the wars of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries had turned mainly on questions of religion, those\r\nof the eighteenth centred more and more on the winning of colonial\r\nmarkets as close preserves for the mother-country. By the Peace of\r\nUtrecht (1713) England gained the first place in the race for Empire;\r\nand a clause of that treaty enabled her to participate in the most\r\nlucrative of trades, the kidnapping of negroes in Africa for the\r\nsupply of Spanish-America. Never was there a more fateful gain. It\r\nbuilt up the fortunes of many scores of merchants and shipowners, but\r\nit degraded the British marine and the populace of our ports, in some\r\nof which slaves were openly sold. The canker of its influence spread\r\nfar beyond ships and harbours. Its results were seen in the seared\r\nconscience of the nation, and in the lowering of the sense of the\r\nsanctity of human life, which in its turn enabled the blind champions\r\nof law, especially after the scare of 1745, to multiply capital\r\npunishments until more than 160 crimes were punishable by death.\r\n\r\nThe barbarities of the law and the horrors of the slave-trade finally\r\nled to protests in the name of humanity and religion. These came in the\r\nfirst instance from the Society of Friends.[21] But the philanthropic\r\nmovement did not gather volume until it was fed by the evangelical\r\nrevival. Clarkson, Zachary Macaulay, Wilberforce (the ablest champion\r\nof the cause), and John Howard, the reformer of prisons, were living\r\nproofs of the connection which exists between spiritual fervour and\r\nlove of man. With the foundation, in the year 1787, of the _Society for\r\nthe Abolition of the Slave Trade_, the philanthropic movement began\r\nits career of self-denying effort, which for some five years received\r\nvaluable support from Pitt. Other signs of a moral awakening were not\r\nwanting. In 1772 Lord Chief Justice Mansfield declared that all slaves\r\nbrought to the United Kingdom became free--a judgement which dealt\r\nthe death-blow to slave markets in this country. In 1773 John Howard\r\nbegan his crusade for the improvement of gaols; and seven years later\r\nSunday Schools were started by Robert Raikes. The protests of Burke and\r\nSir Charles Bunbury against the pillory, the efforts of the former in\r\n1784–5 to prevent the disgraceful overcrowding of the prisons, and the\r\ncrusade of Romilly against the barbarities of the penal code are also a\r\ntribute to the growth of enlightenment and kindliness.\r\n\r\nThese ennobling efforts, however, failed to make any impression on\r\nwhat is termed “Society.” The highest and the lowest strata are, as a\r\nrule, the last to feel the thrill of new movements; for surfeit and\r\nstarvation alike stunt the better instincts. Consequently, Georgian\r\nEngland became strangely differentiated. The new impulses were quickly\r\npermeating the middle classes; but there their influence ceased. The\r\nflinty hardness of the upper crust, and the clayey sediment at the\r\nbottom, defied all efforts of an ordinary kind. The old order of things\r\nwas not to be changed save by the explosive forces let loose in France\r\nin 1789. That year forms a dividing line in European history, as it\r\ndoes in the career of William Pitt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough ominous signs of the approaching storm might already be seen,\r\nthe noble and wealthy wasted their substance in the usual round of\r\nriotous living. It may be well to glance at two of the typical vices of\r\nthe age, drinking and gambling, of course in those circles alone where\r\nthey are deemed interesting, for thence only do records reach us.\r\n\r\nDrinking did not count as a vice, it was a cherished custom. The depths\r\nof the potations after dinner, and on suitable occasions during the\r\nday, had always been a feature of English life. Shakespeare seems to\r\naim these well-known lines at the English rather than the Danes:\r\n\r\n  This heavy-headed revel east and west\r\n  Makes us traduced and tax’d of other nations:\r\n  They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase\r\n  Soil our addition.[22]\r\n\r\nCertainly in the eighteenth century drinking came to be in a sense\r\na flying buttress of the national fabric. The champions of our\r\n“mercantile system” brought about the signature of the Methuen Treaty\r\nof 1703 with Portugal, in order to favour trade with that harmless\r\nlittle land at the expense of that with our “natural enemy,” France.\r\nHostility to the French being the first of political maxims, good\r\ncitizens thought it more patriotic to became intoxicated on port wine\r\nthan to remain sober on French claret. Though we may not endorse Adam\r\nSmith’s hopeful prediction that the abolition of all duties on wine\r\nwould have furthered the cause of temperance, yet we may agree that\r\nthe drunkenness of the age was partly due to “the sneaking arts of\r\nunderling tradesmen”--when “erected into political maxims for the\r\nconduct of a great empire.” Equally noteworthy is his verdict that\r\ndrunkenness was not limited to people of fashion, and that “a gentleman\r\ndrunk with ale has scarce ever been seen among us.”[23]\r\n\r\nThe habit of tippling, which even the moralist Johnson (_aet._ 70) said\r\nmight “be practised with great prudence,” was everywhere dominant. The\r\nthinness and unpracticality of the studies at the old universities\r\nwere relieved by the depth and seriousness of the potations. The\r\nphrase, “a port wine Fellow,” lingered to the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury as a reminiscence of the crusted veterans of a bygone age,\r\nwhose talk mellowed at the second bottle, and became drivel only at\r\nthe fourth. Lord Eldon relates how a reverend Silenus, a Doctor of\r\nDivinity of Oxford, was once discovered in the small hours feeling\r\nhis way homewards by the delusive help of the railings encircling the\r\nRadcliffe Library, and making lay remarks as to the unwonted length of\r\nthe journey.[24] Where doctors led the way, undergraduates bettered\r\nthe example; and the customs of Cambridge, as well as the advice of\r\nphysicians, served to ingrain in Pitt that love of port wine which\r\nhelped to shorten his life.\r\n\r\nBut the Universities only reflected the customs of an age when “drunk\r\nas a lord” had become a phrase. In fashionable society it was usual to\r\nset about tippling in a methodical way. Sometimes, at the different\r\nstages of the progress, travellers’ impressions were recorded in a\r\nquaintly introspective manner. Rigby, Master of the Rolls in Ireland,\r\nwhen jocularly asked at dinner by the Prince of Wales to advise him\r\nabout his marriage, made the witty and wise reply: “Faith, your Royal\r\nHighness, I am not drunk enough yet to give advice to a Prince of Wales\r\nabout marrying.”[25] The saying recalls to mind the unofficial habit of\r\ntraining and selecting diplomatists and ambassadors, namely, to ply the\r\naspirants hard and then notice who divulged fewest secrets when under\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nFortunately, amidst the Bacchic orgies of the time, the figure of\r\nGeorge III stood steadfast for sobriety. His tastes and those of Queen\r\nCharlotte were simple and healthy. Further, he was deeply impressed by\r\nthe miserable end of his uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, whose frame,\r\nalways unwieldy, became a mass of gouty corpulence and staggered on to\r\ndissolution at the age of forty-four. The Duke, so it is said, had long\r\nbefore warned the King, if he wished to live to a healthy old age, to\r\navoid all the pleasures of the table.[26] The life and death of the\r\nDuke--an example more potent than words--and the homely tastes of the\r\nroyal pair themselves, served to keep the bill of fare at Windsor well\r\nwithin the compass of that of many a small squire. After hunting for\r\na whole morning, the King was sometimes content to lunch on a jug of\r\nbarley-water. Stories to this effect endeared “farmer King George” to\r\nthe plain, wholesome folk of the provinces in whom lay the strength\r\nof England; but they aroused no responsive feeling in courtiers and\r\nnobles, who looked on such lenten fare as scarcely human, certainly not\r\nregal.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Prince of Wales, however, tended to bring matters\r\nback to the level beloved of the _Comus_ rout. The orgies of Carlton\r\nHouse were not seldom bestial; and yet fashionable society seems to\r\nhave suffered no qualms on hearing that the prince was more than once\r\nsaved from suffocation by prompt removal of enswathing silks.[27]\r\nDinners became later, longer, and more luxurious. Experienced diners\r\nwere those who could reckon the banquet, not by the number of glasses,\r\nbut of bottles. Instead of figuring as an incident in the course of the\r\nday, dinner became its climax. We find Horace Walpole in February 1777\r\ncomplaining that it absorbed the whole of the evening: “Everything is\r\nchanged; as always must happen when one grows old and is prejudiced to\r\none’s old ways. I do not like dining at nearly six, nor beginning the\r\nevening at ten at night. If one does not conform one must live alone.”\r\n\r\nMany letters of that amusing writer show how the latter part of\r\nthe four hours was spent. Take this reference to the death of Lord\r\nCholmondeley: “He was seventy and had a constitution to have carried\r\nhim to a hundred, if he had not destroyed it by an intemperance\r\nthat would have killed anybody else in half the time. As it was, he\r\nhad outlived by fifteen years all his set, who have reeled into the\r\nferry-boat so long before him.” There Horace Walpole laid his finger\r\non one of the sores of the age. Statesmen and generals, parsons and\r\nsquires, were generally worn out at fifty-five; and if by reason of\r\nstrength they reached three score years and ten, those years were\r\nindeed years of sorrow and gout. In the annals of that period it\r\nwould be impossible to find a single man possessed of the vigour of\r\nMr. Gladstone at eighty, or the subtlety and firmness displayed by\r\nBeaconsfield at Berlin at the age of seventy-four. A nonagenarian was\r\nnever seen at St. Stephen’s: at seventy statesmen were laid by in\r\nflannel and wheeled about in bath-chairs. The cause of it all may be\r\nsummed up in one word--port wine.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would extend to an unwieldy length if a full account\r\nwere given of what was, perhaps, the most characteristic vice of\r\nthe age. Gambling has always flourished in an uncultured, reckless\r\nand ostentatious society. Men who have no mental resources within\r\nthemselves are all too apt to seek diversion in the vagaries of\r\nchance. Tacitus noted it as the worst vice of the savage Teutons whom\r\nin other respects he lauded; and certainly none of their descendants\r\ngamed more than the Englishmen of the Georgian era. In vain did\r\nthe King set his face against the evil. The murmurs grew not loud\r\nbut deep when he forbade gambling at Court on that much cherished\r\noccasion, “twelfth-night.” The courtiers then substituted cards, and\r\nbetted furiously on them, until they too were banished from the royal\r\npalaces, even on that merry festival.[28] But here again the Prince\r\nof Wales neutralized his father’s example, and before long succeeded\r\nin contracting debts to a princely amount, whereupon they were\r\nconsiderately paid by Parliament. That sturdy opponent of George III,\r\nCharles James Fox, outran even the Prince of Wales in zeal. At an all\r\nnight sitting he is known to have lost £12,000; and, putting fortune\r\nto the test, lost successively £12,000 and £11,000 more. His great\r\nrival, the younger Pitt, plunged into play for a brief space, but on\r\nfinding it get too strong a hold over him, resolutely freed himself\r\nfrom its insidious meshes. Thereafter that genial wit, George Selwyn,\r\npointed the moral of their early careers by comparing the rivals to the\r\nindustrious and idle apprentices of Hogarth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mention of Hogarth awakens a train of thought alien to his\r\nself-satisfied age. One begins to inquire what was the manner of\r\nlife of those coarse thickset figures who fill the background of his\r\nrealistic canvases. Were Englishmen of the lower orders really given\r\nover to Bacchic orgies alternating with long spells of flesh-restoring\r\ntorpor? What was their attitude towards public affairs? While Rousseau\r\nbegan to open out golden vistas of a social millennium, were the\r\ntoilers really so indifferent to all save the grossest facts of\r\nexistence? The question is difficult to answer. The Wilkes affair\r\nseemed for the time to arouse universal interest, but the low class\r\nLondoners who bawled themselves hoarse for “Wilkes and Liberty”\r\nprobably cared for that demagogue mainly because he was a Londoner\r\nbent on defying the House of Commons. Personal feelings rather than\r\npolitical convictions seem to have determined their conduct; for Wilkes\r\nwas not reviled a few years later when he went over to the King’s side.\r\nMeanwhile the Gordon Riots had shown the London populace in another\r\nlight. As for the County Reform Associations of the years 1780–4, they\r\nhad very little hold upon the large towns, except in Yorkshire; and\r\nthere the movement was due to the exceptionally bad representation and\r\nto the support of the great Whig landlords. The experience of those\r\ndecades proves that political action which arises out of temporary\r\ncauses (especially of a material kind) will lead to little result.\r\n\r\nThat mercurial and ill-educated populace seems to have shaken off its\r\npolitical indifference only at the time of a general election. Moritz\r\ndescribes the tumultuous joy with which Londoners took part in the\r\nelection of the year 1782. The sight of carters and draymen eagerly\r\nlistening to the candidates at the hustings; their shouts for a speech\r\nfrom Fox; the close interest which even the poorest seemed to feel in\r\ntheir country’s welfare, made a deep impression on Moritz, who found\r\nthe sight far more exhilarating than that of reviews on the parade\r\nground at Berlin. His mental comparison of Londoners with the Romans of\r\nthe time of Coriolanus was, however, cut short when he saw “the rampant\r\nspirit of liberty and the wild impatience of a genuine English mob.” At\r\nthe end of the proceedings the assembly tore down the hustings, smashed\r\nthe benches and chairs, and carried the fragments about with them as\r\nsigns of triumph.[29] Rousseau and Marat, who saw something of English\r\nlife during their stay in this country, declared that Britons were free\r\nonly during an election; and the former averred that the use which they\r\nmade of “the brief moments of freedom renders the loss of liberty well\r\ndeserved.”[30] Certainly their elections were times of wild licence;\r\nand the authorities seem to have acquiesced in the carnival as tending\r\nto promote a dull, if not penitential, obedience in the sequel. Not\r\nwithout reason, then, did Horace Walpole exclaim, at the close of the\r\nAmerican War--“War is a tragedy; other politics but a farce.”\r\n\r\nThe moralist who cons the stories of the frivolity and vice of that\r\nage is apt to wonder that any progress was made in a society where\r\nwar and waste seemed to be the dominant forces. Yet he should remember\r\nthat it is the extravagant and exceptional which is chronicled, while\r\nthe humdrum activities of life, being taken for granted, find no\r\nplace either in newspapers, memoirs, or histories. We read that in\r\nthe eight years of the American War the sum of £115,000,000 was added\r\nto the National Debt, the interest on which in the year 1784 amounted\r\nto £9,669,435.[31] But do we inquire how a country, which with great\r\ndifficulty raised a revenue of £25,000,000 a year, could bear this load\r\nand the far heavier burdens of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars?\r\nThe problem seems insoluble until we remember that British industry\r\nwas then entering on its most expansive phase. The condition of our\r\nland may be compared with that of a sturdy oak which has had one of its\r\nlimbs torn away and its foliage blighted by a storm. Yet, if the roots\r\ngrip the soil deep down, the sap of a single season will restore the\r\nverdure, and in a few years the dome of foliage will rise as shapely\r\nand imposing as ever. So was it to be with England. Her astonishingly\r\nquick recovery may be ascribed partly to the exertions of the great man\r\nwhose public life will here be set forth. But one man can do little\r\nmore than direct the toil of the many to fruitful issues; and the\r\nfruitfulness that marked the first decade of his supremacy resulted\r\nfrom the contact of the nation’s roots with a new and fertile layer of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nBelow the surface of the national life, with its wars and party\r\nintrigues, there lay another world, in which the thoughts of Watt and\r\nTrevithick, of Hargreaves, Arkwright and Cartwright, were slowly taking\r\nshape in actuality. There lay the England of the future. Already its\r\nstrength, though but that of an embryo, sufficed to send up enough of\r\nvital sap quickly to repair the losses of war; and the first claim of\r\nthe younger Pitt to the title of Statesman lay in his perception of the\r\nneeds and claims of this hidden life.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical inventions which led up to the era of great production\r\nresulted indirectly from the outburst of industrial activity that\r\nfollowed the victorious issue of the Seven Years’ War. “Necessity is\r\nthe mother of Invention”; and the great need after 1763 was to quicken\r\nthe spinning of yarn so that the spinsters of a household could keep\r\nthe father supplied with enough weft for his loom. This necessity\r\nquickened the wits of a Lancashire weaver, Hargreaves; and in 1764 he\r\nconstructed his “jenny,” to lighten the toil of his wife. In quick\r\nsuccession came the inventions of Arkwright and Crompton, as already\r\nnoted. The results obtained by the latter were surprising, muslin and\r\nother delicate fabrics being wrought with success in Great Britain.\r\nIn a special Report issued by the East India Company in 1793, the\r\ncomplaint was made that every shop in England offered for sale “British\r\nmuslins equal in appearance and of more elegant patterns than those of\r\nIndia, for one fourth, or perhaps more than one third, less price.”[32]\r\nFurther improvements increased the efficiency of this machinery,\r\nwhich soon was used extensively in the north-west of England, and in\r\nLanarkshire. The populations of Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and\r\nBirmingham, after 1780, began to increase amazingly.[33] Hitherto\r\nthey had numbered between 30,000 and 60,000 souls. Now they began to\r\noutstrip Bristol and Norwich, the second and third of English cities.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the Industrial Revolution in this, its first\r\nphase, brought wealth and contentment to all members of the community.\r\nThe quantities of thread, varying in fineness, but severally invariable\r\nin texture and strength, enabled the hand-loom weavers to push on\r\nwith their work with none of the interruptions formerly caused by the\r\ninability of hard-pressed spinsters to supply the requisite amount of\r\nyarn. These last, it is true, lost somewhat in economic independence;\r\nfor by degrees they sank to the position of wage-earners in mills, but\r\nthey were on the whole less hard-worked than before, water furnishing\r\nthe power previously applied by the spinster’s foot; and the family\r\nretained its independence because the father and brothers continued to\r\nwork up cloth on their own hand-looms and to sell the produce at the\r\nweekly markets of Manchester or Blackburn, Leeds or Halifax. In the\r\ncase of the staple industry of Yorkshire, many men reared the sheep,\r\ndressed and dyed the fleeces, worked up the thread into cloth, and\r\nfinally, with their sons, took it on a packhorse to the nearest cloth\r\nmarket. A more complete example of economic independence it would be\r\ndifficult to find; and the prosperity of this class--at once farmers,\r\nand dyers, manufacturers, and cloth merchants--was enhanced by the new\r\nspinning machinery which came rapidly into use after the year 1770.\r\n\r\nThis fact is emphasized in a vivid sketch of life in a Lancashire\r\nvillage drawn by one who saw it at the time of these momentous\r\ndevelopments. William Radcliffe describes the prosperity which they\r\nbrought to the homes of the farmer-artisans who formed the bulk of\r\nthe population of his native village of Mellor, about fourteen miles\r\nnorth of Manchester. He calls the years 1788 to 1803 the golden age of\r\nthe cotton industry. Every out-house in the village was fitted as a\r\nloom-shop; and the earnings of each family averaged from 80 to 100 or\r\nsometimes even 120 shillings a week.[34] This account, written by a man\r\nwho rose to be a large manufacturer at Stockport is probably overdrawn;\r\nbut there can be no doubt that the exuberant prosperity of the North of\r\nEngland provided the new vital force which enabled the country speedily\r\nto rise with strength renewed at the very time when friends and enemies\r\nlooked to see her fall for ever. Some idea of the magnitude of this new\r\nsource of wealth may be gained from the official returns of the value\r\nof the cotton goods exported from Great Britain at the following dates:\r\n\r\n  1710         £5,698\r\n  1751         45,986\r\n  1764        200,354\r\n  1780        355,060\r\n  1785        864,710\r\n  1790      1,662,369\r\n  1795      2,433,331\r\n  1800      3,572,217\r\n  1806      9,753,824\r\n\r\nAfter 1803 Cartwright’s power-loom came more and more into use, and\r\nthat, too, at the time when Watt’s steam-engine became available\r\nfor general use. The pace of the Industrial Revolution was thus\r\naccelerated; and in this, its third phase, the far-reaching change\r\nbrought distress to the homes of the weavers, as was to be seen in the\r\nLuddite riots of 1810–11. This, however, belongs to a period later than\r\nthat dealt with in these pages. Very noteworthy is the fact that in\r\nthe years 1785–1806, which nearly cover the official life of Pitt, the\r\nexports of cotton goods increased almost twelvefold in value; and that\r\nthe changes in the textile industries enhanced not only the wealth of\r\nthe nation but also the prosperity of the working classes in districts\r\nwhich had been the poorest and most backward.\r\n\r\nLimits of space preclude any reference to the revolution wrought in\r\nthe iron industry when coal and coke began to take the place of wood\r\nin the smelting of that metal. It must suffice to say that, whereas\r\nthe English iron industry had seemed in danger of extinction, it now\r\nmade giant strides ahead. In 1777 the first iron bridge was erected\r\nat Coalbrookdale, over the Severn. Six years later Cort of Gosport\r\nobtained a patent for converting pig-iron into malleable-iron by a\r\nnew and expeditious process;[35] and in 1790 the use of steam-engines\r\nat the blast furnaces trebled their efficiency. This and the former\r\nreference to the steam-engine will suffice to remind the reader of the\r\nenormous developments opened up in all manufactures when the skill and\r\npatience of Watt transformed a scientific toy into the most important\r\ngenerator of power hitherto used by man.\r\n\r\nThus, in the closing years of the eighteenth century--that much\r\ndespised century, which really produced nearly all the great inventions\r\nthat the over-praised nineteenth century was merely to develop--the\r\nIndustrial Revolution entered on its second phase. The magnets which\r\nthenceforth irresistibly attracted industry, and therefore population,\r\nwere coal and iron. Accordingly, as Great Britain had abundance of\r\nthese minerals in close proximity, she was able in a very short space\r\nof time to become the workshop of the world. The Eldorado dreamt of\r\nby the followers of Columbus was at last found in the Midlands and\r\nmoorlands of the north of England. For the present, the discovery\r\nbrought no curse with it. While multiplying man’s powers, it also\r\nstimulated his ingenuity in countless ways. Far from diverting his\r\nenergies from work to what is, after all, only the token of work, it\r\nconcentrated his thoughts upon productive activity, and thus helped not\r\nonly to make work but to make man.\r\n\r\nWhile the moors and vales of the North awakened to new and strange\r\nactivities, the agricultural districts of the Midlands and South also\r\nadvanced in wealth and population. A scientific rotation of crops, deep\r\nploughing, and thorough manuring of the soil altered the conditions of\r\nlife. Here again England led the way. Arthur Young, in his “Travels in\r\nFrance” (1787–9) never tires of praising the intelligence and energy\r\nof our great landowners, whereas in France his constant desire is to\r\nmake the _seigneurs_ “skip.” In the main, no doubt, the verdict of\r\nYoung was just. Landlords in England were the leaders of agricultural\r\nreform. In France they were clogs on progress. Yet, the changes here\r\nwere not all for good. That is impossible. The semi-communal and almost\r\ntorpid life of the village was unequal to the claims of the new age;\r\nand, amidst much of discomfort and injustice to the poor, individual\r\ntenures, enclosures, and high-farming became the order of the day.[36]\r\nNew facilities for travel, especially in the form of mail-coaches,\r\nbetter newspapers (a result of the Wilkes affair)--these and other\r\ndevelopments of the years 1770–84 heralded the dawn of an age which\r\nwas to be more earnest, more enlightened, less restful, and far more\r\ncomplex. The times evidently called for a man who, while holding to\r\nall that was best in the old life, fully recognized the claims of the\r\ncoming era. Such a man was William Pitt.\r\n\r\nIn many respects he summed up in his person the tendencies of the\r\nclosing decades of the century, just as the supreme figure of his\r\nfather reflected all that was most brilliant and chivalrous in the\r\nmiddle of the Georgian era. If the elder Pitt raised England to heights\r\nof splendour never reached before, the younger helped to retrieve the\r\ndisasters brought on by those who blindly disregarded the warnings of\r\nhis father. In the personality both of father and of son there was\r\na stateliness that overawed ordinary mortals, but the younger man\r\ncertainly came more closely into touch with the progressive tendencies\r\nof the age. A student of Adam Smith, he set himself to foster the\r\nindustrial energies of the land. In order to further the cause of\r\npeace, he sought the friendship of the French nation, of which Chatham\r\nwas the inveterate enemy; and in the brightest years of his career he\r\nseemed about to inaugurate the golden age foretold by the Illuminati.\r\nAs by contact with Adam Smith he marched at the head of the new and\r\npeaceful commercialism, so too through his friendship with Wilberforce\r\nhe felt the throb of the philanthropic movements of his times.\r\n\r\nFor the new stirrings of life in the spheres of religion, art, and\r\nliterature, Pitt felt no deep concern. Like his father, and like\r\nthat great genius of the South who wrecked his career, he was “a\r\npolitical being.” In truth, the circumstances of the time compelled\r\nhim to concentrate all his energies on public affairs. It was his lot\r\nto steer the ship of state through twenty of the most critical years\r\nof its chequered voyage. Taking the tiller at a time of distress, he\r\nguided the bark into calmer waters; and if he himself did not live on\r\nto weather a storm more prolonged and awful than that from which he\r\nat first saved his people, yet even in the vortex of the Napoleonic\r\ncyclone he was to show the dauntless bearing, the firm faith in the\r\ncause of ordered freedom, the unshaken belief in the destinies of his\r\nrace, which became the son of Chatham and the typical Englishman of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS\r\n\r\n    I am glad that I am not the eldest son, but that I can serve my\r\n    country in the House of Commons like papa.--PITT, May 1766.\r\n\r\n\r\nChampions of the customs of primogeniture must have been disquieted\r\nby observing how frequently the mental endowments of the parents were\r\nwithheld from their eldest son and showered upon his younger brother.\r\nThe first Earl of Chatham was a second son, and found his doughtiest\r\nopponent in Henry Fox, Lord Holland, also a second son. By a singular\r\ncoincidence the extraordinary talents of their second sons carried them\r\nin their turn to the head of their respective parties and engaged them\r\nin the longest duel which the annals of Parliament record. And when\r\nthe ascendancy of William Pitt the Younger appeared to be unshakably\r\nestablished, it was shattered by the genius of the second surviving son\r\nof Charles Marie de Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe future defender of Great Britain was born on 28th May 1759, just\r\nten years before the great Corsican. His ancestry, no less than the\r\ntime of his birth, seemed to be propitious. The son of the Earl of\r\nChatham, he saw the light in the year when the brilliant victories\r\nof Rodney, Boscawen, Hawke, and Wolfe lessened the French navy by\r\nsixty-four sail of the line, and secured Canada for Britain. The almost\r\ndoting fondness which the father felt for the second son, “the hope and\r\ncomfort of my life,” may perhaps have been the outcome of the mental\r\necstasy of those glorious months.\r\n\r\nIf William Pitt was fortunate in the time of his birth, he was still\r\nmore so in the character of his father. In the nature of “the Great\r\nCommoner,” the strain of pride and vanity was commingled with feelings\r\nof burning patriotism, and with a fixed determination to use all\r\nhonourable means for the exaltation of his country. Never since the\r\nage of Elizabeth had Englishmen seen a man of personality so forceful,\r\nof self-confidence so indomitable, of patriotism so pure and intense.\r\nThe effect produced by his hawk-like eye, his inspiring mien and\r\noratory was heightened by the consciousness that here at last was an\r\nhonest statesman. In an age when that great party manipulator, Walpole,\r\nhad reduced politics to a game of give and take, the scrupulous probity\r\nof Chatham (who refused to touch a penny of the interest on the balance\r\nat the War Ministry which all his predecessors had appropriated)\r\nshone with redoubled lustre. His powers were such as to dazzle his\r\ncontemporaries. The wide sweep of his aims in 1756–61, his superb\r\nconfidence as to their realization, the power of his oratory, his\r\nmagnetic influence, which made brave officers feel the braver after an\r\ninterview with him--all this enabled him completely to dominate his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn truth his personality was so dazzling as to elude the art of\r\nportraiture. At ordinary times he might have been little more than a\r\nreplica of that statesman of the reign of Charles II whom Dryden has\r\nimmortalized:\r\n\r\n  A man so various that he seemed to be\r\n  Not one, but all mankind’s epitome.\r\n\r\nBut Chatham was fortunate in his times. He certainly owed very much to\r\nthe elevating force of a great idea. In the early part of his life,\r\nwhen no uplifting influence was at work, his actions were often grossly\r\nincongruous and at times petty and factious. Not until he felt the\r\ninspiration of the idea of Empire did his genius wing its way aloft.\r\nIf it be true that the Great Commoner made the British Empire, it is\r\nalso true that the Empire made him what he was, the inspirer of heroic\r\ndeeds, the invigorator of his people.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with these qualities, which entitle him to figure in\r\nEnglish annals as Aristotle’s “magnificent man,” his defects were\r\nvenial. Nevertheless, as some of them lived on in a lesser degree in\r\nhis son, we must remember his arrogance, his melodramatic airs, his\r\nover-weening self-will, and his strange inconsistencies. In no one\r\nelse would these vices and defects have been tolerated; that they\r\nwere overlooked in him is the highest tribute that can be paid to the\r\nsplendour of his services and the sterling worth of his nature.\r\n\r\nIf we look further back into the antecedents of the Pitt family, we\r\nfind it domiciled at or near Blandford in Dorset, where it had produced\r\none poet of quite average abilities, Christopher Pitt (1699–1748),\r\nwhose translation of Virgil had many admirers. The love of adventure\r\nand romance, so often found in West Country families, had already\r\nbeen seen in Thomas Pitt (1653–1726), who worked his way to the front\r\nin India despite the regulations of the Company, became Governor of\r\nMadras, and made his fortune by very questionable transactions.[37] His\r\ngreat stroke of good fortune was the purchase of the famous diamond,\r\nwhich he thereafter sold to the Regent of France for nearly six times\r\nthe price of purchase. He married a lady who traced her descent to\r\na natural son of James V of Scotland; and to this union of a daring\r\nadventurer with the scion of a chivalrous race we may perhaps refer the\r\nwill-power and the mental endowments which shone so brightly in their\r\ngrandson, the first Earl of Chatham.\r\n\r\nOn his mother’s side the younger Pitt could claim a distinguished\r\ndescent. Her maiden name was Hester Grenville, and she was the daughter\r\nof Richard Grenville and Hester, Countess Temple. The appended table\r\nwill show the relation of the Pitt and Grenville families:\r\n\r\n               RICHARD GRENVILLE m.

In contrast to his theatrical, lordly,\r\nand imperious ways, she shone by her simplicity and sweetness. His\r\njunior by many years, she accepted his devotion with something of awe,\r\nand probably felt his oft recurring attacks of gout, for which he\r\nmagniloquently apologized, to be a link between them; for the Jove of\r\nthe Senate became docile and human when he was racked with pain.[38]\r\nHer tender care at these times, and at others her tactful acquiescence\r\nin his moods and plans, ensured tranquillity and happiness in their\r\nhousehold. Not that she lacked firmness of character, when occasion\r\nrequired; but we may ascribe her pliability to the personal ascendancy\r\nof her lord, to the customs of the times, and to her perception of the\r\nrequisites for a peaceful existence. She carried her complaisance so\r\nfar as to leave to her consort the choice of the residence at Hayes,\r\nnear Bromley, in Kent, which he bought at the end of the year 1754. The\r\nfollowing are the almost Griselda-like terms in which she defers to his\r\nopinion on the matter: “For the grand affair proposed by my dear love,\r\nI have only to reply that I wish him to follow what he judges best, for\r\nhe can best judge what sort of economy suits with the different plans\r\nwhich he may choose to make hereafter. Whatever you decide upon will be\r\nsecure of being approved by me.”[39]\r\n\r\nWhen a woman renounces all claim to a voice in the selection of\r\nher abode, we may be sure that she will neither interfere much in\r\nher husband’s political career, nor seek to shine in a _salon_ of\r\nblue-stockings. In fact, Lady Chatham’s influence on her children\r\nwas purely domestic. Her realm was the home. There is scarcely a\r\ntrace of any intellectual impress consciously exerted upon her gifted\r\nson, William; but her loving care ensured his survival from the many\r\nillnesses of his early years; and she dowered him with the gentler\r\ntraits for which we search in vain in the coldly glittering personality\r\nof Chatham. As examples of her loving care for her children, I may cite\r\nthe following passages from her letters. In August 1794, when she felt\r\nold age coming on apace, she wrote in this tender strain:\r\n\r\n    I feel that I cannot support the idea of leaving you, my beloved\r\n    sons, without saying unto ye how truly my fond affection has\r\n    increasingly ever attended ye both, and that my constant prayers\r\n    have been daily addresst to the Omnipotent Disposer of all events,\r\n    that you might be directed in all things by the blessing of\r\n    heavenly wisdom....\r\n\r\nOr take this gentle chiding to William (25th April 1796):\r\n\r\n    I do not [hear] from you, my dear son, but I hear often of you in\r\n    a way that makes up to me in the best manner possible for your\r\n    silence. I cannot, however, help wishing that my pleasure was\r\n    increased by receiving now and then a few words from you, and\r\n    immediately comes almost a reflection that obliges me to unwish it\r\n    again, that I may not take up any part of the small leisure you\r\n    have to enjoy a little relaxation from your various calls.\r\n\r\nThe old lady long retained her vigour; for in the autumn of 1795 she\r\ndescribes herself as “stout enough both in body and mind to wish the\r\nwind to shift to the east so that the fleet might not be detained.”[40]\r\nIndeed, in the even strength of her body, as in the constancy of her\r\nmind, she far excelled her husband. We find Wilberforce, in the summer\r\nof 1791, entering the following note in his diary: “Old Lady Chatham,\r\na noble antiquity--Lady Chatham asked about Fox’s speaking--is much\r\ninterested about politics--seventy-five years old, and a very active\r\nmind.”[41]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                              _Emery Walker Ph. sc._\r\n\r\n  _Hester Grenville, Countess of Chatham_\r\n  _from a painting in the possession of E. G. Pretyman Esq._\r\n]\r\n\r\nDoubtless, her pride in the triumphs of her second son explains the\r\nsingular buoyancy of her nature almost up to the time of her death. She\r\nmust have recognized him as pre-eminently her child. In appearance he\r\ncertainly favoured her. A comparison of the two noble Gainsboroughs of\r\nmother and son preserved at Orwell Park shows William to have been more\r\na Grenville than a Pitt. His nose--that feature on which caricaturists\r\neagerly fastened, and on which he was said proudly to suspend the\r\nHouse of Commons--had nothing in common with Chatham’s aquiline and\r\nterrifying prow. So, too, the whole bearing of the son was less fiery\r\nand less formidable than that of the father. In Chatham there lay the\r\npotentialities of a great warrior; but in the son’s nature these powers\r\nwere wholly subordinate to the faculties that make for supremacy in\r\ncivil affairs, namely, patience, reasonableness, and aptitude for logic\r\nand finance. Above all, there shone in the younger Pitt a harmony of\r\nthe faculties, in which the father was lacking.\r\n\r\nThere is ample proof of the devotion with which Pitt regarded his\r\nparents. His letters to them were long and loving; but while he\r\naddressed Chatham in the stilted terms which the Earl himself affected,\r\nhe wrote to his mother in a simple and direct style that tells of\r\ncomplete sympathy. In one of his youthful letters to her he apologized\r\nhumbly for some little act of inattention; and in later years the busy\r\nPrime Minister often begged her forgiveness for his long silence. In\r\nall 363 letters to his mother have survived, and prove the tenderness\r\nof his love. Clearly also he valued her advice; for at the crisis of\r\nthe early part of 1783 he asked her opinion whether or no he should\r\ntake office as Prime Minister.[42] For the most part the letters\r\ncontain little more than references to private affairs, which prove\r\nthe warmth of his family feelings; but sometimes, especially in the\r\nlater years when the overworked Prime Minister could rarely visit his\r\nmother at her home, Burton Pynsent in Somerset, he gives reasons for\r\nhoping that the progress of measures through Parliament, or the state\r\nof the negotiations with France during the Revolutionary war, would\r\npermit him to pay her a visit. The letters bear touching witness to\r\nthe hopefulness of spirit which buoyed him up; but sometimes they are\r\noverclouded by disappointments in the political sphere, which were\r\nall the keener because they held him to his post and prevented the\r\nlonged-for stay at Burton Pynsent in August or at Christmas. In such\r\ncases Lady Chatham’s replies are restrained and dignified. I shall\r\nsometimes draw on this correspondence, especially where it reveals\r\nPitt’s hopes for the work of the session or the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nIngenious pleaders from the time of Macaulay onwards have shown their\r\nskill in comparing the achievements of father and son. The futility of\r\nall such tight-rope performances must be obvious to those who remember\r\nthe world-wide difference between the cataclysmic forces and novel\r\nproblems of the revolutionary era and the comparatively simple tasks\r\nof the age of Chatham. We shall have cause, later on, to insist on the\r\ndifference in efficiency between Frederick the Great and Frederick\r\nWilliam II as an ally; and not even the most fervent panegyrists of\r\nChatham will dare to assert that the ill-led and underfed armies of\r\nLouis XV were foes as redoubtable as the enthusiastic hosts called into\r\nbeing and marshalled by the French Revolution and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is one of these fallacious comparisons which\r\ndeserves a brief notice. Lady Chatham, on being asked by one of her\r\ngrandchildren which was the cleverer, the Earl of Chatham or Mr. Pitt,\r\nreplied: “Your grandpapa without doubt.”[43] The answer is remarkable.\r\nNo woman in modern times has been blessed with such prodigality of\r\npower and talent both in husband and son; and we, with a knowledge\r\nof the inner forces of the two periods which she could not possess,\r\nmay perhaps be inclined to ascribe her verdict to the triumph of the\r\nearly memories of the wife even over the promptings of maternal pride.\r\nExplain it as we may, her judgement is certainly a signal instance\r\nof self-effacement; for the gifts of tact, prudence, and consistency\r\nwhereby Pitt restored England to her rightful place in the years\r\n1783–93 were precisely those which he derived from her.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked that great men have owed more to the\r\nmother’s nature than to that of the father; and, while Chatham dowered\r\nhis second son with the qualities that make for versatility, display,\r\nand domination, his mother certainly imparted to him forethought,\r\nsteadiness of purpose, and the gentler gifts that endeared him to a\r\nselect circle of friends. Here again, one might suggest a parallel\r\nbetween Pitt and his great opponent, Napoleon, who owed to his father\r\ncharacteristics not unlike those named above, but received from his\r\nmother the steel-like powers of mind and body which made him so\r\nterrible an opponent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to indicate some of the influences of heredity\r\nwhich helped to shape the career of Pitt. It is a topic on which only\r\nsciolists would venture to dogmatize. Even in his early youth William\r\nbegan to outshine his elder brother. In their boyhood, mostly spent\r\nat Hayes, the difference of temperament between John and William made\r\nitself felt to the disadvantage of the former. He was reserved, not\r\nto say heavy and indolent, where William was bright and attractive.\r\n“Eager” is the epithet applied to him by Lady Chatham in 1766. The\r\neldest son, having none of the intellectual gifts and graces of\r\nChatham, could not satisfy the imperious cravings of the father, with\r\nthe result that William received an undue share of admiration. He was\r\n“the wonderful boy.” John was designed for the army, with results no\r\nless unfortunate for England than a similar choice proved ultimately\r\nto be for France in the case of Joseph Bonaparte. Well would it have\r\nbeen for the United Kingdom had John Pitt allowed the glorious name\r\nof Chatham to sink to comfortable mediocrity on the paternal estates\r\nof Hayes or Burton Pynsent, and never to be associated with the Isle\r\nof Walcheren. His colleagues in the Cabinet learnt to respect his\r\njudgement as that of a safe man; but, as the sequel will show, he was\r\nutterly lacking in energy and the power of inspiring others.\r\n\r\nWilliam, having alertness of mind and brightness of speech, was\r\ndesigned for Parliament. Or rather, this was his choice at the age\r\nof seven. In May 1766, on hearing that his father was raised to the\r\nPeerage, he told his tutor, the Rev. Edward Wilson, in all seriousness,\r\nthat he was glad he was not the eldest son, but that he could serve\r\nhis country in the House of Commons like his papa.[44] The words have\r\noften been misquoted, even by Earl Stanhope, the boy being reported\r\nas saying, “I want to speak in the House of Commons like papa.” The\r\nwords, when correctly cited, are remarkable, not for childish conceit,\r\nbut for a grave and premature sense of responsibility. They show the\r\nstrength of that patriotic instinct which inspired every action of his\r\ncareer, spurring him on to his early studies, and to the complex and\r\ncrushing duties of his youth and manhood. They sound the keynote of his\r\ncharacter and enable us to form some notion of the strength of that\r\nlife-long desire to serve his native land. This, his first recorded\r\nutterance, links itself in noble unison with that last tragic gasp of\r\n23rd January 1806--“My country. How I leave my country!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe health of the little William was so precarious that he and his\r\nbrothers and sisters spent much time at the seaside resorts, Weymouth\r\nand Lyme Regis, which were not far from Burton Pynsent, an estate\r\nbequeathed by an admirer to the Earl of Chatham. Yet notwithstanding\r\nall the care bestowed on him, the boy had but a frail hold on life.\r\nIllness beset him during fully the half of his youth. At the age of\r\nfourteen he was still short and thin and weighed only six stone,\r\ntwo pounds.[45] Observers, however, agree that his spirits always\r\nrose superior to weakness; and to this characteristic, as also to\r\nhis indomitable will, we may attribute his struggling on through an\r\nexhausting career to the age of forty-seven. The life of Pitt is a\r\nsignal proof of the victory which mind can, for a time, win over matter.\r\n\r\nVery naturally, his parents decided to have him trained at home rather\r\nthan at a public school. Chatham, while at Eton, formed the most\r\nunfavourable impression of the public school system and summed it up\r\nin his remark to Shelburne that he had “scarce observed a boy who was\r\nnot cowed for life at Eton; that a public school might suit a boy of a\r\nturbulent, forward disposition, but would not do where there was any\r\ngentleness.”[46]\r\n\r\nThe tutor chosen for this purpose was the Rev. Edward Wilson, of\r\nPembroke Hall (now College), Cambridge, who had charge of him from his\r\nsixth to his fourteenth year. The mutual affection of tutor and pupil\r\nis seen in a letter which the tutor wrote at Weymouth in September\r\n1766, describing William as often standing by him while he read, and\r\nmaking remarks that frequently lit up the subject and impressed it on\r\nthe memory. His ardour, he adds, could not be checked.[47] Wilson’s\r\ntraining seems to have been highly efficient, as will appear when we\r\ncome to consider the phenomenal attainments of his pupil at the time of\r\nhis admission to the University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps significant that that later prodigy of learning and\r\noratorical power, Macaulay, was also not brought into contact with\r\nour public school system. Both of these remarkable men may have owed\r\nsome of their originality to the thoroughness of the private tuition\r\nwhich they received before entering the university. Had they passed\r\nthrough the mill of a public school they would certainly have been less\r\nangular, and would have gained in knowledge of men. Pitt especially\r\nmight have cast off that reserve and stiffness which often cost him\r\nso dear. But both of them would assuredly have lost in individuality\r\nwhat they might have gained in _bonhomie_. Still more certain is it\r\nthat those hotbeds of slang would have unfitted them for the free\r\nexpression of their thoughts in dignified and classical English. The\r\nease with which, from the time of his first entrance into Parliament,\r\nPitt wielded the manifold resources of his mother tongue may be\r\nascribed partly to hereditary genius but also to daily converse with\r\none of the greatest of orators. It was Chatham’s habit to read with his\r\nfavourite son passages from the Bible or from some other great classic.\r\nWe also know from one of the Earl’s private memoranda that he made\r\nit a special study to clothe his thoughts in well-chosen words.[48]\r\nIndeed, he never talked but always conversed. We may be sure, then,\r\nthat even the lighter efforts of the statesman must have been to the\r\nboy at once an inspiration to great deeds, a melodious delight, and a\r\nlesson in rhetoric. What youth possessed of genius would not have had\r\nhis faculties braced by learning English from such a tongue, by viewing\r\nmankind through such a lens?\r\n\r\nThis education at home probably explains one of Pitt’s marked\r\ncharacteristics, namely, his intense hopefulness. Brought up on the\r\nbest authors, imbued with the highest principles, and lacking all\r\nknowledge of the seamy side of life, he cherished an invincible belief\r\nin the triumph of those aims which he felt to be good and true. This\r\nis an invaluable faculty; but it needs to be checked by acquaintance\r\nwith the conduct of the average man; and that experience Pitt scarcely\r\never gained except by hearsay. Sir George Trevelyan has remarked that\r\nthe comparative seclusion of Macaulay in youth led to his habitual\r\nover-estimate of the knowledge usually possessed by men. Certainly it\r\nled to the creation of that singular figment, “Macaulay’s school-boy.”\r\nA similar remark probably holds true of the quality of Pitt’s nature\r\nnoted above. Partly, no doubt, his hopefulness was the heritage\r\nbequeathed by Chatham; but it was strengthened by Pitt’s bookish\r\noutlook on life.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of his childhood and early youth must also have\r\nfavoured the growth of that patrician virtue, confidence. Up to the\r\nyear 1774 he lived on his father’s estates at Hayes and Burton Pynsent,\r\namidst some of the choicest scenery in the south of England. The\r\nland overflowed with prosperity, which was rightly ascribed in large\r\nmeasure to the genius of Chatham. Until the shadow of the American War\r\nof Independence fell on the youth, in his seventeenth year, he was\r\nthe favourite son of a father whom all men revered; and his lot was\r\ncast in a land which seemed to be especially favoured. Thus pride of\r\nfamily and pride of race must have helped to stiffen the mental fibre\r\nof a youth on whom nature and art alike showered the gifts and graces\r\nof a chivalrous order. In a coarse nature the result would have been\r\nsnobbishness. In William Pitt the outcome was devotion to the ideals of\r\nhis father and buoyant confidence as to their ultimate triumph.\r\n\r\nIn some respects there is truth in the statement of Windham that Pitt\r\nnever was young. Certainly for so delicate a plant the forcing process\r\nwas perilously early and prolonged. In the Pitt Papers (No. XI) I have\r\nfound a curious proof of the hold which the boy had over Latin at a\r\nvery early age. It is a letter written to his father, the general\r\ncorrectness of which contrasts strangely with its large round letters\r\nenclosed within lines. It is not dated, but probably belongs to 1766,\r\nthat is, to the seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\n    MI CHARISSIME PATER,\r\n\r\n    Gaudeo audire te rursum bene valere. Vidimus primates Mohecaunnuck\r\n    et Wappinger, Tribuum Indicorum a septentrioli America, qui veniunt\r\n    in Angliam supplicare regem ob quosdam agros. Gulielmus Johnson,\r\n    eques auratus, desiderabat auxilium eorum in bello, et illi omnes\r\n    abierunt ut pugnarent contra Gallos; sed, cum domum rediebant,\r\n    sentiebant Batavos arripuisse omnes suos agros. Vulgus apud\r\n    Portland illos parum commode tractabat.\r\n\r\n                             Sum, mi charissime Pater,\r\n                                         tibi devinctissimus,\r\n                                                     GULIELMUS PITT.\r\n\r\nI have also found a curious proof of the stilted style in which the boy\r\nwrote to his father, while on the very same day he wrote to his brother\r\nalmost in the terms which a boy of eleven would use. To the Earl of\r\nChatham he thus begins a letter of 31st July 1770:\r\n\r\n    From the weather we have had here I flatter myself that the\r\n    sun shone on your expedition, and that the views were enough\r\n    enlivened thereby to prevent the drowsy Morpheus from taking the\r\n    opportunity of the heat to diffuse his poppies upon the eyes of the\r\n    travellers.[49]\r\n\r\nThis almost rises to the pomposity of style with which Chatham\r\ndescribed to his son William the stinging of carriage-horses by wasps.\r\nThe insects figure as “an ambuscade of Pandours,” and the horses as\r\n“these coursers of spirit not inferior to Xanthus and Podarges.”[50]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere on the other hand is the boy’s letter to his brother:\r\n\r\n                                                Hayes, July 31 1770.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n    I assure you that I am obliged to you beyond what is to be\r\n    expressed for your epistle or journal. The dialogue between you and\r\n    your host is very entertaining to those not interested in the want\r\n    of provision in the inn. But I fancy it was not so to you, as it\r\n    afforded little or no hope of dinner unless you could dine on the\r\n    small tithes. The 2 Masons are incomparable. I think the intended\r\n    candidate is to the full as likely as G. O. to succeed, and for\r\n    what I know deserves it better. As I have seen neither the statue\r\n    at Guilford nor that at South Carolina, I cannot judge which excels\r\n    in point of workmanship, but I know which of the two noble Persons\r\n    (in my opinion) is the superior. Your white mare I take to be more\r\n    of the species of an elephant than any other; and can carry houses\r\n    or castles on her back. Tho’, great as She is, Long Sutton might\r\n    perhaps keep her under her feet. These two mornings I have rode\r\n    out before breakfast. Your Greek was excellent, and (I think) with\r\n    practice you may become a Thucydides. Dapple is in good health; and\r\n    we have taken the liberty to desire him to honour us with following\r\n    the little chaise. I hope all stock is pure well.\r\n\r\n                            I am, dear brother,\r\n                                    Affectionately yours,\r\n                                                   WILLIAM PITT.[51]\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the two letters proves that Chatham’s influence\r\nmust have overwrought the boy’s brain and inflated his style. The\r\nletter to John evinces a joy in life natural to a boy of eleven,\r\ntogether with a wide range of interests and accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThat the writers of the period also did much to form the boy’s style\r\nwill appear from his first poem, “On the Genius of Poetry,” which bears\r\ndate May 1771.[52] It seems to be the joint product of Harriet and\r\nWilliam Pitt:\r\n\r\n  Ye sacred Imps of thund’ring Jove descend,\r\n  Immortal Nine, to me propitious, bend\r\n  Inclining downward from Parnassus’ brow;\r\n  To me, young Bard, some Heav’nly fire allow.\r\n  From Aganippe’s murmur strait repair,\r\n  Assist my labours and attend my pray’r.\r\n  Inspire my verse. Of Poetry it sings.\r\n  Thro’ _Her_, the deeds of Heroes and of Kings\r\n  Renown’d in arms, with fame immortal stand.\r\n  By _Her_ no less, are spread thro’ ev’ry land\r\n  Those patriot names, who in their country’s cause\r\n  Triumphant fall, for Liberty and Laws.\r\n  Exalted high, the Spartan Hero stands,\r\n  Encircled with his far-renowned bands.\r\n  Whoe’er devoted for their country die,\r\n  Thro’ _Her_ their fame ascends the starry sky.\r\n  _She_ too perpetuates each horrid deed;\r\n  When laws are trampled, when their guardians bleed,\r\n  That shall the Muse to infamy prolong\r\n  Example dread, and theme of tragic song.\r\n  Nor less immortal, than the Chiefs, resound\r\n  The Poets’ names, who spread their deeds around.\r\n  Homer shall flourish first in rolls of fame;\r\n  And still shall leave the Roman Virgil’s name;\r\n  With living bays is lofty Pindar crown’d;\r\n  In distant ages Horace stands renown’d.\r\n  These Bards, and more, fair Greece and Rome may boast,\r\n  And some may flourish on this British Coast.\r\n  Witness the man, on whom the Muse did smile,\r\n  Who sung our Parents’ fall and Satan’s guile,\r\n  A second Homer, favor’d by the Nine.\r\n  Sweet Spenser, Jonson, Shakspear the divine.\r\n  And He, fair Virtue’s Bard, who rapt doth sing\r\n  The praise of Freedom and Laconia’s King.\r\n  But high o’er Chiefs and Bards supremely great\r\n  Shall Publius shine, the Guardian of our state.\r\n  Him shall th’ immortal Nine themselves record,\r\n  With deathless fame his gen’rous toil reward,\r\n  Shall tune the harp to loftier sounding lays\r\n  And thro’ the world shall spread his ceaseless praise.\r\n  Their hands alone can match the Heav’nly strain\r\n  And with due fire his wond’rous glories sing.\r\n\r\nThe poem, which is in William’s handwriting, shows that by the age of\r\ntwelve he had acquired the trick--it was no more--of writing in the\r\nstyle of Pope and Johnson. The lines remind us of the felicitous phrase\r\nin which Cowper characterized the output of that school:\r\n\r\n  The click-clock tintinnabulum of rhyme.\r\n\r\nBut they show neatness of thought and phrase. In a word, they are good\r\nJohnsonese.\r\n\r\nThe same quality of sonorous ponderosity is observable in Pitt’s\r\nletters of 3rd June 1771 to his uncle the statesman, Earl Temple,\r\nthanking him for a present, in which the names of Lyttelton and Coke\r\nare invoked. In the following sentences the trend of the boy’s thoughts\r\nis very marked: “I revere this gift the more, as I have heard Lyttelton\r\nand Coke were props of the Constitution, which is a synonimous [_sic_]\r\nterm for just Liberty.” The “marvellous boy” ends by quoting part of a\r\nline of Virgil, which still more powerfully inspired him:\r\n\r\n  avunculus excitat Hector.\r\n\r\nThe next year saw the production of a play, which he and his brothers\r\nand sisters acted at Burton Pynsent on 30th May 1772. Here again the\r\nmotive is solely political: a King, Laurentius, on his way homeward,\r\nafter a successful war, suffers shipwreck, and is mourned as dead. The\r\nnews leads an ambitious counsellor, Gordinus, to plot the overthrow of\r\nthe regency of the Queen; but his advances are repelled by a faithful\r\nminister, Pompilius--the character played by William Pitt--in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  Our honoured Master’s steps may guide her on,\r\n  Whose inmost soul she knew; and surely she\r\n  Is fitted most to fill her husband’s throne,\r\n  She, whom maternal tenderness inspires,\r\n  Will watch incessant o’er her lovely son\r\n  And best pursue her dear Laurentius’ plans.\r\n\r\nPompilius warns the Queen of the plot of Gordinus, and persuades her\r\nto entrust her son Florus to his care in a sylvan retreat. Thither\r\nalso Laurentius comes in disguise; for, after landing as a forlorn\r\nsurvivor, he hears of dangerous novelties that had poisoned men’s\r\nminds and seduced the army from allegiance to the Queen. Pompilius,\r\nwhile visiting the royal heir, sees and recognizes Laurentius, brings\r\nhim to Florus, and prepares to overthrow the traitors. In due course\r\nthe King’s adherents defeat the forces of Gordinus, who is slain by\r\nLaurentius himself, while Pompilius, his standard bearer, kills another\r\narch-conspirator. The King grants a general pardon in these lines:\r\n\r\n  Us it behoves, to whom by gracious Heav’n\r\n  The cares of nations and of States are giv’n--\r\n  Us it behoves with clemency to sway\r\n  That glorious sceptre which the gods bestow.\r\n  We are the shepherds sent to tend the flock,\r\n  Sent to protect from wrong, not to destroy.\r\n  Oh! Florus! When thou govern’st our domains,\r\n  Bear these thy father’s precepts in thy mind.\r\n  Thro’ love control thy subjects, not thro’ fear.\r\n  The people’s love the bulwark of thy throne.\r\n  Give not thy mind to passion or revenge,\r\n  But let fair Mercy ever sway thy soul.[53]\r\n\r\nIt is fairly certain that none of the children but William could have\r\nwritten these lines; and the fact that the mainspring of the action is\r\npolitical further stamps the play as his own. Some Spirit of the Future\r\nseems to have hovered over him, for the mental derangement of George\r\nIII in 1788 brought to the front questions relating to a Regency not\r\nvery unlike those sketched by the boy playwright. The sense of loyalty\r\nand devotion which informs the play was then also to guide Pitt’s\r\nfootsteps through a bewildering maze. Indeed this effusion seems almost\r\nlike a marionette’s version of the Regency affair: Laurentius is a more\r\nromantic George III, Pompilius quite startlingly foreshadows Pitt the\r\nPrime Minister, the Prince of Wales (an undutiful Florus) and Fox may\r\npass for the conspirators; and the _motif_ of the play twangs a mimic\r\nprelude to the intrigues of Carlton House. In the acting of the play\r\nthe elder brother seems far to have surpassed William, who bore himself\r\nstiffly and awkwardly. Such was the testimony of young Addington,\r\na lifelong friend, who saw the play acted on another occasion at\r\nHayes.[54] The criticism is valuable as showing how ingrained in Pitt’s\r\nnature was the shyness and _gaucherie_ in public which were ever to\r\nhamper his progress.\r\n\r\nJuvenile authorship has its dangers for a delicate child; and we are\r\nnot surprised to find from notes left by his first tutor to Bishop\r\nTomline that the half of Pitt’s boyhood was beset by illnesses which\r\nprecluded all attempt at study. But nothing stopped the growth of his\r\nmental powers, which Wilson summed up in the Platonic phrase, “Pitt\r\nseemed never to learn but merely to recollect.” At the age of fourteen\r\nand a half, then, he was ripe for Cambridge. It is true that youths\r\nthen entered the English Universities at an age fully as early as the\r\nScottish lads who went from the parish school, or manse, straight to\r\nEdinburgh or Aberdeen. Charles James Fox, Gibbon, and the lad who\r\nbecame Lord Eldon, entered Oxford at fifteen. Wilberforce, who at\r\nseventeen went up from Hull to St. John’s College, Cambridge, was\r\nprobably the senior of most of the freshmen of his year; but the case\r\nof Pitt was even then exceptional.\r\n\r\nCambridge on the whole enjoyed a better reputation than Oxford for\r\nsteady work; but this alone does not seem to have turned the thoughts\r\nof the Earl of Chatham so far eastwards. He himself was an Oxford man,\r\nand the distance of Cambridge from Burton Pynsent, the usual abode of\r\nthe family, would naturally have told in favour of Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe determining facts seem to have been that Wilson’s companionship\r\nwas deemed essential, and that he, as a graduate of Pembroke Hall,\r\nCambridge, turned the scale in favour of his own college. This appears\r\nfrom Wilson’s letter of 2nd December 1772 to his wife:\r\n\r\n    I could not have acted with more prudence than I have done in\r\n    the affair of Pembroke Hall. Mr. Pitt is not the child his years\r\n    bespeak him to be. He has now all the understanding of a man,\r\n    and is, and will be, my steady friend thro’ life.... He will go\r\n    to Pembroke, not a weak boy to be made a property of, but to be\r\n    admir’d as a prodigy; not to hear lectures but to spread light.\r\n    His parts are most astonishing and universal. He will be fully\r\n    qualified for a wrangler _before he goes_, and be an accomplished\r\n    classick, mathematician, historian and poet.[55]\r\n\r\nHow often have similar prophecies led to disappointment. In the case\r\nof the “wonderful boy,” they did but point the way to a career whose\r\nmeridian splendour has eclipsed the tender beauty of its dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAT CAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\n    A man that is young in yeares may be old in houres, if he have lost\r\n    no time. But that happeneth rarely.--BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 26th April 1773 Pitt’s name was entered at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge;\r\nand he commenced residence there on 8th October 1772. His health\r\nbeing ever a matter of grave concern, Wilson stayed with him in order\r\nto prevent any boyish imprudences and accompany him in riding. But\r\nall precautions were in vain. Despite the invigorating influences of\r\nsea-air at Lyme Regis, where William and his brother had stayed from\r\nJune up to 21st September, he soon fell ill at Cambridge, and remained\r\nin bed for several weeks. Thanks to the medical skill of Drs. Addington\r\nand Glynn (the former an old friend of Chatham), he gradually got\r\nthe better of the hereditary foe, gout; but the letters which passed\r\nbetween Lady Chatham and Wilson attest the severity of the seizure. The\r\nboy seems to have won the love of his medical attendants, as appears\r\nfrom this sentence in her letter of 22nd November. “What a gift William\r\nhas to conciliate the love of those who are once acquainted with him.”\r\n\r\nThere is a story told to Thomas Moore by the Bishop of Bath and Wells,\r\nthat Pitt brought his nurse with him in the carriage to Cambridge,\r\nand that she stayed to look after him. This strange assertion is made\r\nin the poet’s diary for 13th February 1826; and the distrust which\r\nthat late date inspires is increased when we find that the Bishop had\r\nthe anecdote from Paley, who “was very near being his [Pitt’s] tutor,\r\ninstead of Pretyman, but Paley did not like it.”[56] As Paley was at\r\nChrist’s, and there never was any question of Pitt entering at that\r\ncollege or receiving from the outset regular instruction outside the\r\nwalls of Pembroke, the story lacks every element of credibility.\r\n\r\nThe facts are as follows: Mrs. Sparry, who was attendant or housekeeper\r\nat Burton Pynsent, went to Cambridge to nurse the boy through his long\r\nand serious illness, and finally brought him home. At last the invalid\r\nwas strong enough to bear the journey. Four days were taken up in\r\nreaching London; and we find him writing thence to his mother on 6th\r\nDecember that he had not been fatigued and felt strong enough to walk\r\nall the way home; but, he added, Mrs. Sparry urged him not to write\r\nmuch.[57] He did not return to Cambridge (“the evacuated seat of the\r\nMuses” as Chatham styled it) until 13th July 1774. Then he informed\r\nLady Chatham that Cambridge was empty, that Dr. Glynn had called on him\r\nand had inquired after Mrs. Sparry, who would be glad to hear that the\r\nbed at his rooms had been well aired. These trifles enable us to reduce\r\nthe oft quoted nurse story to its proper insignificance.\r\n\r\nWilson seems to have done his best to amuse his charge in the dreary\r\nvacation time of July–September 1774; for on 24th August Pitt described\r\nto his mother a ride in which Wilson and he had lost their way among\r\nlanes and fields and regained the track with some damage to hedges,\r\nand after a chase of one of the steeds, but far too late to share\r\nin college dinner. Again, on 1st September, he wrote to the Earl of\r\nChatham: “The ardour for celebrating this day is as great at Cambridge\r\nas anywhere; and Mr. Wilson himself, catching a spark of it, signalized\r\nhimself by killing a crow on the wing after a walk of six hours.”[58]\r\n\r\nThe natural vivacity of disposition, which charmed all his friends,\r\nmust have played no small part in the recovery of his health. The\r\nmedical authorities of to-day would also probably assign more\r\nimportance to regular hours, exercise, and careful diet than to\r\nthe use of port wine, adopted in compliance with his physicians’\r\nrecommendation, on which some contemporary writers dwell with much\r\ngusto. Certain it is that from the year 1774 onwards “his health became\r\nprogressively confirmed.”\r\n\r\nThis phrase occurs in the biography of Pitt written by his college\r\ntutor, Dr. Pretyman, whose style it aptly characterizes. The book is\r\nindeed one of the most ponderous ever published. As tutor, friend, and\r\nadviser, the Rev. Dr. Pretyman had unique opportunities for giving\r\nto the world a complete and life-like portrait. Pitt was entrusted\r\nto his care and to that of his colleague, Dr. Turner, in 1773–4,\r\nand thereafter to Pretyman alone. The undergraduate soon conceived\r\nfor him an affection which was strong and lasting. Their intercourse\r\nsuffered little interruption, not even from the ecclesiastical honours\r\nwhich the young Prime Minister so freely bestowed on his old tutor.\r\nThe bishop, who in 1803 took the name of Tomline, continued to be\r\nthe friend and adviser of the Statesman up to the dreary days which\r\nsucceeded the death-blow of Austerlitz. Pitt died in his arms, and he\r\nwas his literary executor. Yet, despite the mass of materials put into\r\nhis hands (or was it because of their mass?)[59] he wrote one of the\r\ndullest biographies in the English language.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the riddle may perhaps be found in the cast of his\r\nmind, which was that of a mathematician and divine, while it lacked\r\nthe gifts of interest in men and affairs, of insight into character,\r\nof delicate and instinctive sympathy, and of historic imagination,\r\nwhich enliven, reveal, interpret, and illuminate personalities and\r\nsituations. Talleyrand, with a flash of almost diabolical wit, once\r\ndescribed language as a means of _concealing_ thought. Tomline, with\r\nlaboured conscientiousness, seems to have looked on biography as a\r\nmeans of concealing character. Certainly he portrayed only those\r\nfeatures which are easily discernible in the tomes of the Parliamentary\r\nHistory. An almost finnikin scrupulousness clogged him in the exercise\r\nof the scanty powers of portraiture with which Nature had endowed\r\nhim. The biographer was continually being reined in by the literary\r\nexecutor, the result being a progress, which, while meant to be\r\nstately, succeeds only in being shambling. Here and there we catch\r\nglimpses of Pitt under the senatorial robes with which his friend\r\nadorned and concealed him, but they are tantalizingly brief. The Bishop\r\nwas beset by so many qualms concerning the propriety of mentioning this\r\nor that incident as to “suppress many circumstances and anecdotes of\r\na more private nature,” and to postpone the compilation of a volume\r\non this more frivolous subject. Death supervened while the Bishop was\r\nstill revolving the question of the proprieties; and we shall therefore\r\nnever fully know Pitt as he appeared to his life-long counsellor.[60]\r\n\r\nThere must have been sterling qualities in the man whom the statesman\r\nthus signally honoured. Dr. Pretyman’s learning was vast. Senior\r\nWrangler and Fellow of his College, he also became a Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society; and his attainments in the classics enabled him to\r\ncommand the respect of his pupil in a sphere where, according to\r\nWilson, Pitt had the Platonic gift, not of learning, but of instinctive\r\nremembrance (ἀνάμνησις). Nevertheless, nearly all contemporaries seem\r\nto have found in the tutor and Bishop a primness and austerity which\r\nwere far from attractive. Perhaps he lacked the vitality which might\r\nhave energized that mass of learning. Or else the consciousness that\r\nhe was a Senior Wrangler, together with the added load of tutorial and\r\nepiscopal responsibility, may have been too much for him. To Pitt,\r\nnurtured amidst the magniloquence of Hayes and Burton Pynsent, the\r\nseriousness and pedantry of Pretyman doubtless appeared natural and\r\npleasing. To outsiders they were tedious; and the general impression\r\nof half-amused, half-bored wonderment is cleverly, though spitefully,\r\nexpressed in the lines of the _Rolliad_:\r\n\r\n  Prim preacher, prince of priests and prince’s priest,[61]\r\n  Pembroke’s pale pride, in Pitt’s _praecordia_ placed,\r\n  Thy merits all shall future ages scan,\r\n  And prince be lost in parson Pretyman.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting parts of the bishop’s biography of Pitt\r\nare those in which he describes his attainments, and his studies at\r\nPembroke Hall. The tutor found him, as Wilson expected, exceedingly\r\nwell versed in the classics, so that he seldom met with any\r\ndifficulties. Chatham had prescribed a careful study of Thucydides and\r\nPolybius; and the young undergraduate was often able, with little or no\r\npreparation, to translate six or seven pages of the former historian,\r\nwithout making more than one or two mistakes. This is very remarkable\r\nin a youth of fifteen; but his sense of the meaning and fitness of\r\nwords seems to have been not less instinctive than his choice of\r\nlanguage, which was soon to arouse the wonder and admiration of the\r\nmost experienced debaters at Westminster.\r\n\r\nAs regards his mathematical attainments, Tomline states that he had\r\nalready read the first six books of Euclid, and had mastered the\r\nelementary parts of Algebra, Trigonometry, and Natural Philosophy.\r\nThe bent of his mind was towards the Humanities; but he had a good\r\nhold on mathematics, and became expert at the solution of problems.\r\nNewton’s _Principia_ aroused his deepest admiration. Various notes on\r\nmathematical and astronomical subjects extant in the Pitt Papers (too\r\nfragmentary for reproduction here) show that he retained his interest\r\nin the exact sciences.[62]\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge, above all, he deepened his knowledge of the classics.\r\nThe ease with which he deciphered so obscure a work as Lycophron’s\r\n“Cassandra” astonished even those who were familiar with his\r\nexceptional powers. Everything therefore conduced to give him an\r\nexceedingly wide and thorough knowledge of the literatures of Greece\r\nand Rome; for, fortunately for him, he had neither the need nor the\r\ninclination to bestow much time on the art of versifying in those\r\nlanguages, which absorbed, and still absorbs, so much of the energy of\r\nthe dwellers by the Cam. Accordingly the life, thought, and statecraft\r\nof Athens and Rome became thoroughly familiar to him. His love for\r\ntheir masterpieces of art and imagination was profound; and the many\r\ncomments in his handwriting on the margin of the chief authors suffice\r\nto refute the gibe of certain small-minded opponents, that he kept\r\nup his acquaintance with the classics in order to find tags for his\r\nspeeches.[63] To some extent, it is true, his studies were directed\r\ntowards his future vocation. At the wish of the Earl of Chatham, he\r\nbestowed great attention on the oratory of the ancients; and he seems\r\nto have bettered the precept by making critical notes on the speeches\r\nwhich he read, and remarking how the various arguments were, or might\r\nbe, answered. Add to this a close and loving perusal of Shakespeare\r\nand Milton, and it will be seen that Pitt’s studies at Cambridge were\r\nsuch as invigorated the mind, cultivated his oratorical gift, and\r\nthoroughly equipped him for the parliamentary arena.\r\n\r\nFrom Tomline we glean a few details which enable us to picture the\r\nyoung undergraduate in his surroundings. He states that his manners\r\neven at that early age were formed and his behaviour manly, that he\r\nmixed in conversation with unaffected vivacity and perfect ease. His\r\nhabits were most regular; he never failed to attend morning and evening\r\nchapel except when prevented by ill health. Owing to his father’s habit\r\nof reading aloud a chapter of the Bible every day, his knowledge of\r\nthe Holy Scripture was unusually good. Tomline mentions a circumstance\r\nwhich will serve also to illustrate Pitt’s powers of memory and fine\r\nsense of sound. On hearing his former tutor read portions of Scripture\r\nin support of his “Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles,” the\r\nstatesman (it was in that anxious year, 1797) stopped him at one text\r\nwith the remark--“I do not recollect that passage in the Bible, and it\r\ndoes not sound like Scripture.” He was right: the passage came from the\r\nApocrypha, which he had not read.\r\n\r\nThe singular correctness of Pitt’s life while at Cambridge exposed\r\nhim to the risk of becoming a bookworm and a prig. From this he was\r\nsaved by his good sense and his ill-health. “The wonderful boy” was\r\nbegged by his parents not to court the Muses too assiduously. Chatham’s\r\nfatherly anxiety and his love of classical allusions led him to run\r\nthis metaphor to death; but the strained classicisms had the wished for\r\neffect. Pitt rode regularly and far. In the Pitt Papers (No. 221) I\r\nhave found proof that, while at Cambridge, he was trained in the then\r\nessential art of fencing. At a later date his old fencing-master, Peter\r\nRenaud, sent to him a petition stating that he had “had the honour of\r\nteaching you when you was at Pembroke College,” and that in consequence\r\nof the decline in the habit of fencing, he was now in poverty, and\r\ntherefore begged for help from his illustrious pupil.\r\n\r\nWe clutch at these trifles which show the drift of Pitt’s early habits;\r\nfor the worthy Tomline, who had stacks, where we have only sheaves,\r\ndoes not condescend to notice them. From the Pitt Papers we can,\r\nhowever, in part reconstruct his Cambridge life. In his first term,\r\nPitt described Pembroke as “a sober, staid college, and nothing but\r\nsolid study there.” Fortunately, too, no exceptional privileges were\r\naccorded to Chatham’s favourite son. The father in his letter to\r\nthe tutor had not claimed any, except those required on the score of\r\nhealth. Consequently though Pitt had the right to don the gorgeous gown\r\nof a “gentleman-commoner” (afterwards called “fellow commoner”), he did\r\nnot do so. In his first letter to his father he stated that his cap\r\nwas “to be stripped of its glories, in exchange for a plain loop and\r\nbutton.”[64] It is further pleasing to know that his father wished him\r\nnot to make use of that tattered mediaeval privilege which allowed sons\r\nof noblemen to receive the degree without sitting for examination; and\r\nthat persistent ill-health alone led him to resort unwillingly to this\r\nmiserable expedient.\r\n\r\nWe are here reminded of Wordsworth’s reference to the sense of social\r\nequality to be found at Cambridge, even at a time when titled arrogance\r\nand old-world subservience ramped and cringed unchecked and unrelieved\r\nin most parts of the land. The lines are worthy of quotation because\r\nthey show that the spirit prevalent at Cambridge, at least at St.\r\nJohn’s College, prepared the poet to sympathize with the French\r\ndemocracy. He speaks of Cambridge as\r\n\r\n  A Republic, where all stood thus far\r\n  Upon equal ground, that we were brothers all\r\n  In honour, as in one community,\r\n  Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,\r\n  Distinction open lay to all that came,\r\n  And wealth and titles were in less esteem\r\n  Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry.\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether Pitt’s feelings at this time were akin to those\r\nof Wordsworth, who entered St. John’s in 1787. Pitt’s surroundings were\r\nnot such as to favour the infiltration of new ideas. In his first two\r\nyears he mixed scarcely at all with undergraduates, and even after 1776\r\nhis circle seems to have been limited, doubtless owing to his intense\r\nshyness, ill-health, and constant association with Dr. Pretyman. On 4th\r\nNovember 1776 he writes home that he had been spending a few days at\r\nthe house of Lord Granby (the future Duke of Rutland), and had returned\r\nto the “sober hours and studies” of college; but he rarely refers to\r\npastimes and relaxations.\r\n\r\nHis letters also contain few references to study; but one of these is\r\nworthy of notice. On 10th November 1776 he asked permission to attend\r\na month’s course of lectures on Civil Law for the fee of five guineas;\r\nand later on he stated that they were “instructive and amusing,”\r\nbesides requiring little extra work. In that term he took his degree in\r\nthe manner aforesaid. Early in 1777 he moved to other rooms which were\r\nsmall but perfectly sheltered from wind and weather. About that time,\r\ntoo, he launched out more freely into social life, so we may judge from\r\nthe not infrequent requests for increased supplies. On 30th June 1777\r\nhe writes that he has exceeded his allowance by £60, the first sign of\r\nthat heedlessness in money matters which was to hamper him through life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of interest in these early letters is the frequent\r\nreferences to the politics of the time, which show that he kept the\r\nservice of his country steadily in view. Thus, on 23rd March 1775\r\nduring vacation time at Hayes, he writes to his brother, begging him,\r\nif he leaves his pillow before noon, to find out the fate of Mr.\r\nBurke’s motion on behalf of conciliation with America. He signs the\r\nletters on behalf of “the Society at Hayes,” possibly a reference\r\nto a family debating club.[65] It is noteworthy that the struggle\r\nof the American colonists with George III was the first political\r\nevent to arouse his interest, which must have been heightened by the\r\nfervid speeches of Chatham on the subject. A little later a side eddy\r\nmust have set in, for his elder brother, Lord Pitt, on receiving\r\nhis commission in 1774, joined his regiment, which was quartered\r\nsuccessively at Quebec and Montreal. On 31st May 1775 William writes\r\nfrom Cambridge that the papers are full of the bad news from Boston,\r\ndoubtless the fight at Lexington. Ten days later he requests Lady\r\nChatham to send, along with the “Ethics,” Davenant on “Peace, War, and\r\nAlliance,” as it is not in any library in Cambridge. Clearly, then, the\r\nyouth was alive to the legal and international questions then at stake.\r\n\r\nProbably these wider interests carried him more into society. His\r\nfriendship with Lord Granby, then an undergraduate, is more than once\r\nreferred to; and thus was formed that connection which furthered Pitt’s\r\ncareer, and led to the sending of Lord Granby (after succeeding to the\r\nDukedom of Rutland) to the Viceregal Lodge at Dublin. The Duke, it may\r\nbe mentioned, bequeathed to Pitt the sum of £3,000.[66] Friendships\r\nformed at the University counted for much in times when court and\r\ngovernmental influence made or marred a man’s career. We may therefore\r\nnote that as Pitt’s health improved during the last years at Cambridge,\r\nhe also became friendly with the following: Lord Westmorland, Lord\r\nEuston, Lowther (Lord Lonsdale), Pratt (Lord Camden), Pepper Arden,\r\nEliot, Bankes, Long, and St. John.\r\n\r\nThe name of him who was perhaps Pitt’s dearest friend is here\r\nconspicuous by its absence. Wilberforce saw little of Pitt at\r\nCambridge, partly, perhaps, because he did not enter at St. John’s\r\nCollege until 1776 and then became associated with a dissolute set; but\r\nhe made Pitt’s acquaintance towards the end of their time there, and\r\nthe youths were mutually attracted by their brilliant conversational\r\ngifts and intellectual powers, which were to be sharpened by delightful\r\nintercourse at London and Wimbledon. In a passage penned in 1821,\r\nWilberforce contrasts the comparative ill fortune of Pitt with the\r\ngood fortune of his rival, Charles James Fox, who at Oxford made the\r\nacquaintance of a number of brilliant young men, Sheridan, Windham,\r\nErskine, Hare, General Fitzpatrick, and Lord John Townshend. Nearly\r\nall of these, it is true, won distinction in public life; but it is\r\nscarcely fair to say that Pitt’s Cambridge friends (to whose number\r\nWilberforce adds Lords Abercorn and Spencer) were deficient in parts.\r\nTheir gifts, if less brilliant, were more solid than those of Fox\r\nand Sheridan. Lords Camden and Westmorland were to prove themselves\r\nable administrators, and the future Duke of Rutland, though showy and\r\ndissolute, displayed much ability as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Bankes\r\n“the precise” (as the _Rolliad_ terms him) was a hard-hitter in debate;\r\nwhile the gentler qualities of Eliot endeared him both to Pitt and to\r\nhis sister Harriet, whom he married in 1785.\r\n\r\nViewing the question more widely, we may surmise that Pitt’s career at\r\nCambridge would have been more fruitful had he gone up somewhat later\r\nand mixed more with undergraduates, especially with good talkers. In\r\nthat case we can imagine that the Grenville stiffness in him would\r\nalmost have vanished. A _bon vivant_ like Fox or North he could never\r\nhave been; but the austerity of his life at Cambridge, save in its\r\nclosing months, did not tend to cure him of the awkward shyness which\r\nWilberforce noted as so prominent a trait in his character;[67] and\r\nthus he went forth into the life of Westminster weighted with that\r\nserious defect, an incapacity for making a wide circle of friends\r\nor winning over enemies. In a sense it may be said that Pitt took\r\npolitical life too seriously. He prepared for it from boyhood so\r\nstrenuously as partly to stunt his social faculties, and thereby\r\nhandicap himself for life. For in that age the political arena was the\r\nclose preserve of the nobles, gentry, and nabobs, with whom a statesman\r\ncould scarcely succeed unless he had the manners of the clubs and the\r\ninstincts of a sportsman. A compromise between Lord Chatham and Tony\r\nLumpkin would have made the ideal leader. As it was, there entered on\r\nthe scene a compromise between Chatham and Aristides.\r\n\r\nPitt’s chief relaxation from the “sober studies” at Pembroke Hall was\r\nfound in visits to the great debates at Westminster. The first of\r\nthese visits belongs to the month of January 1775, when his father was\r\npleading passionately for conciliation with America. Benjamin Franklin,\r\nthe champion of the colonists, was present; and the orator clearly\r\naimed at persuading our kinsmen beyond the seas that they had the\r\nsympathy of very many British hearts. Those two orations echoed far and\r\nwide amid the dales of New England and the rocks of the Alleghanies.\r\nWhat, then, must have been the effect of the living voice and of that\r\nsuperb presence, which trebled the power of every word, on a sensitive\r\nyouth whose being ever thrilled responsive to that of his father?\r\nLanguage failed him to express his feelings. “Nothing prevented his\r\nspeech,” so he wrote to his mother, “from being the most forcible that\r\ncan be imagined, and [the] Administration fully felt it. The manner\r\nand matter both were striking; far beyond what I can express. It was\r\neverything which was superior; ... his first speech lasted above an\r\nhour and the second half an hour--surely the two finest speeches\r\nthat ever were made, unless by himself.”[68] He heard also Chatham’s\r\ngreat effort of 30th May 1777, and describes it as marked by “a flow\r\nof eloquence and beauty of expression, animated and striking beyond\r\nexpression.”\r\n\r\nFor Pitt, indeed, the chief delights of the vacations centred in St.\r\nStephens. Never has there been a more eager listener to the debates;\r\nand here his method of studying the orators of Greece and Rome enabled\r\nhim quickly to marshal the arguments of a speaker, assess them at their\r\nreal worth, and fashion a retort. During one of his visits to the House\r\nof Lords he was introduced to Charles James Fox, already famous as\r\nthe readiest debater in the Lower House. The Whig leader afterwards\r\ndescribed the rapt attention with which the youth at his side listened\r\nto the speeches of the peers, and frequently turned to him with the\r\nremark: “But surely, Mr. Fox, that might be met thus,” or “Yes; but he\r\nlays himself open to this retort.” Little can Fox have imagined that\r\nthese gifts, when whetted by maturity, were frequently to dash the\r\nhopes of the Whigs.[69]\r\n\r\nThe nice balancing of arguments, and the study of words, together\r\nwith the art of voice production, may make a clever and persuasive\r\nspeaker; but a great orator is he to whom such things are but trifling\r\nadornments, needful, indeed, for a complete equipment, but lost amidst\r\nthe grander endowments of Nature, imagination and learning. Pitt\r\nexcelled in the greater gifts no less than in the smaller graces.\r\nHe had the advantage of a distinguished presence, a kindling eye, a\r\nsonorous voice; and to these excellences were added those of the mind,\r\nwhich outshone all adventitious aids. And these intellectual powers,\r\nwhich give weight to attack and cover a retreat, were cultivated with\r\na wholeheartedness and persistence unparalleled in our annals. The\r\npompous greetings of the Earl of Chatham to “the civilians and law of\r\nnations tribe” at Pembroke Hall show the thoroughness of his son’s\r\napplication to law. It also seems probable that during the latter part\r\nof his stay at Cambridge he widened his outlook on public affairs by\r\na study of Adam Smith’s great work, “The Wealth of Nations,” which\r\nappeared in 1776. He afterwards avowed himself a disciple of Adam\r\nSmith; and it is questionable whether he would have had time after\r\nleaving Cambridge thoroughly to master that work.\r\n\r\nBooks which bore upon the rise and fall of States seem to have engaged\r\nhis attention, as was also the case with the young Napoleon--witness\r\nhis copious notes on changes of dynasty and revolutions. In truth,\r\nthose questions were then “in the air.” In 1748 Montesquieu had\r\npublished his “Spirit of Laws”; Rousseau had brought out in 1762 his\r\n“Social Contract,” which Quinet has described as the seed of the French\r\nRevolution. Whether Pitt perused these works is doubtful; but it is\r\nclear that in his reading he had an eye for the causes that make or\r\nmar the fortunes of nations. Witness the remark in his letter of 19th\r\nMarch 1778, that nowhere in history could he find “any instance of a\r\nNation so miserably sacrificed as this has been.”[70] He shared the\r\ngeneral conviction that none but Chatham could steer the ship of State\r\ninto safe waters; and deep must have been his concern when the King\r\nrefused to hear of Chatham forming a new Ministry for the purpose of\r\nconciliation. No consideration, not even the loss of his Crown (so he\r\nwrote to Lord North) would induce him to “stoop to the Opposition.”[71]\r\n\r\nSuch conduct bordered on the insane now that France had made common\r\ncause with the United States; but there was no means of forcing the\r\nKing’s hand. The majority in Parliament supported his Minister, Lord\r\nNorth; and little could be expected from the Earl of Chatham in view of\r\nhis growing infirmities of mind and body. His haughty and exacting ways\r\nno less than his inconsistencies of aim had scattered his following;\r\nand it was but a shadow of a name that appeared in the House of Lords\r\non 7th April 1778. Encased in flannel, looking deadly pale, but with\r\nsomething of the old gleam in his eyes, he entered, staying his\r\ntottering frame on his sons, William and James. He spoke twice, urging\r\nthe House not to debase the monarchy by conceding full independence\r\nto America, still less by giving way before France. “Shall this great\r\nkingdom now fall prostrate before the House of Bourbon? If we must\r\nfall, let us fall like men.” Much of the speech was inconsistent with\r\nhis former opinions; but the peers recked not of inconsistency; they\r\nlistened with bated breath to words which recalled the glorious days\r\nof 1759--words which were to be prophetic both for himself and for his\r\nson. A second oratorical effort was too much for his overwrought frame.\r\nHe pressed his hand to his heart and fell. The peers hard by caught him\r\nin their arms; his sons hurried up and helped to bear him to a house in\r\nDowning Street. Thence he was removed to Hayes, and there on 11th May\r\n1778, in the midst of his family, he passed away.\r\n\r\nFor the greatest statesman and orator of his age there could be but one\r\nplace of sepulture. The House of Commons unanimously voted an address\r\nfor a public funeral and a monument in Westminster; and probably of\r\nall Englishmen there was only one who regretted the decision. George\r\nIII had revealed the pettiness of his nature when, in a letter to Lord\r\nNorth, he referred to Chatham’s breakdown in the House of Lords as his\r\n“political exit.” He now stated that, unless the inscription on the\r\nmonument dwelt only on Chatham’s influence in “rouzing the nation at\r\nthe beginning of the last war,” the compliment paid to the deceased\r\nstatesman would be “rather an offensive measure” to him personally.[72]\r\n“The Court do everything with an ill grace,” is William’s description\r\nof the preparations for the funeral.[73] No one represented the\r\nKing at the funeral on 9th June, a fact which gave to the ceremony\r\nthe appearance of a great popular demonstration. It was the last of\r\nChatham’s triumphs.\r\n\r\nOwing to the absence of the eldest son with his regiment, William\r\nwas the chief mourner. Few of the beholders had any knowledge of his\r\nmanifold gifts; and the crowds which gazed at the stately procession,\r\nas at the burial of England’s glories and hopes, could not surmise\r\nthat the slim figure following the hearse was destined to retrieve the\r\ndisasters of the present and to link once more the name of Pitt with a\r\ngreat work of national revival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL APPRENTICESHIP\r\n\r\n    I cannot approve of the requisition, in the studies of future\r\n    statesmen, of so much theoretical knowledge, by which young people\r\n    are often ruined before their time, both in mind and body. When\r\n    they enter into practical life, they possess indeed an immense\r\n    stock of philosophical and learned material; but in the narrow\r\n    circle of their calling this cannot be practically applied, and\r\n    will therefore be forgotten as useless. On the other hand what they\r\n    most needed they have lost: they are deficient in the necessary\r\n    mental and bodily energy, which is quite indispensable when one\r\n    would enter efficiently into practical life.--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lives of English statesmen have very rarely, if ever, been\r\nenervated by that excessive zeal for education which the great German\r\nthinker discerned as a possible danger for his fellow countrymen.\r\nCertainly to those who had drunk deep of the learning of Leipzig,\r\nHeidelberg, or Göttingen, the transference to a Staats-secretariat\r\nat Weimar, Cassel, or even at Berlin, must have been a life of sheer\r\ndrudgery. Doubtless, the _doctrinaire_ policy of many a Continental\r\nState sprang from the persistent attempts of some Pegasus in harness\r\nto rise again to the serene heights of his youthful contemplations.\r\nIn England our youths did not meditate on the science of politics.\r\nBoth Oxford and Cambridge displayed a maternal care lest the brains\r\nof the rising generation should overtax the bodies; and never was the\r\nunsullied spring of Helicon ruffled by draughts taken under compulsion.\r\nGibbon’s experience at Magdalen College in 1752–3, of the genial\r\nindifference of his first tutor, and the unblushing neglect of his\r\nsuccessor, seems to have been quite normal; and it is clear that the\r\ncurriculum of that wealthy corporation had not the remotest connection\r\nwith any known form of activity outside its walls.\r\n\r\nPitt’s residence at Cambridge was more fruitful for the future. The\r\ndons of Pembroke Hall seem to have taken their duties less lightly\r\nthan was the rule elsewhere; and Pitt’s lifelong gratitude to Dr.\r\nPretyman may have been partly due to the unusual advancement in\r\nlearning achieved under his watchful care. But even so, the regular\r\nstudies had no bearing on the life of a statesman other than that which\r\ncomes from an intelligent reading of the philosophers and historians of\r\nGreece and Rome. Pitt’s choice of lectures on Civil Law was his own.\r\nAnd, after taking his degree in the autumn of 1776, he seems largely\r\nto have followed the bent of his mind, which, as we have seen, led him\r\nto study the crises in national affairs, and the causes of welfare or\r\ndecay. It is significant that the young Napoleon Bonaparte approached\r\nhistorical study in the same practical way.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Pitt haunted the precincts of Westminster, and there learnt\r\nto view politics, not as a science, but a strife. For him, therefore,\r\nthere was little risk of being hampered by an ill-digested mass of\r\ntheoretical learning as he faced the ever shifting problems of the\r\nCommonwealth; still less of undergoing the transition from the breezy\r\nuplands of philosophy to the political mill of some petty principality.\r\nIt is the happy lot of Britain’s sons to come to ever widening spheres\r\nof activity; and their minds, never “sicklied o’er” at the outset,\r\nshould possess the alertness and vigour which Goethe rightly praised as\r\na better equipment than the best elaborated theories and the richest\r\nstore of precedents. This natural course of development ought to\r\nproduce not _doctrinaires_, but statesmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chief misfortunes of Pitt’s early life were his appalling\r\nprecocity, which the Earl of Chatham in no wise checked, and the\r\nsense of responsibility thrust upon him all too soon by the terrible\r\nbereavement described above. As the eldest son was then abroad with\r\nhis regiment, William was at once involved in a network of cares. The\r\nfinances of the family were in an embarrassed state. Chatham’s habits\r\nhad been so lavish, and his conduct in official life so honourably\r\nscrupulous, that the estate was encumbered with debts. Parliament voted\r\nthe sum of £20,000 towards their payment; but, if we may judge from one\r\nof the later letters of Lady Chatham, embarrassments at times continued\r\nto beset her.[74] William also inherited property which was to yield\r\nlittle more than an annual income of £250--a sum inadequate to meet\r\nthe demands of an ambitious youth in an age when money no less than\r\nfamily standing served as the passport to a public career.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the lack of resources seems to have stimulated energies\r\nthat were ever braced by difficulty. About five months after the\r\nfuneral of his father, we find him expressing to Lady Chatham his\r\nresolve to take rooms at Lincoln’s Inn. In his view practice at the\r\nBar was invaluable as a training for that wider and grander service to\r\nwhich he had early vowed himself.\r\n\r\nIn one important particular Pitt’s conduct showed singular foresight.\r\nHe did not, as might have been expected in days when travelling was\r\nslow and expensive, give up his rooms at Pembroke Hall, but for nearly\r\ntwo years he continued usually to reside there, even while keeping his\r\nterms at Lincoln’s Inn. Extravagant though this arrangement seemed to\r\nbe, it was based on prudential motives. In the miserable condition\r\nin which public affairs then were, he judged that a dissolution of\r\nParliament could not be long deferred; and the chance of winning a seat\r\nat his University seemed to him, though still in his teens, greater\r\nthan at an ordinary constituency, where the deep pockets of grandees or\r\nnabobs must mar his prospect.[75]\r\n\r\nAbout Cambridge, then, his hopes fondly clustered, seeing that it\r\nwas “a seat of all others the most desirable, as being free from\r\nexpense, perfectly independent, and I think in every respect extremely\r\nhonourable.”[76] The words have the ring of manly determination which\r\nmarks all his public utterances.\r\n\r\nThe following letter of his to Mr. John (afterwards Lord) Townshend,\r\nthen one of the members for the University, marks the first official\r\nannouncement of his intentions:\r\n\r\n                                        Pembroke Hall, July 15 1779.\r\n\r\n    DEAR TOWNSHEND,\r\n\r\n    The very earnest and sincere wishes I expressed for your success\r\n    in the late contest for the University of Cambridge, might perhaps\r\n    lead you to imagine that I should take a similar part on every\r\n    future occasion. I was therefore very sorry that it was not in my\r\n    power to explain to you my situation when I had the pleasure of\r\n    seeing you here. But, having since finally determined to offer\r\n    myself a candidate for the University at the General Election, I\r\n    am desirous of giving you immediate notice of a circumstance of\r\n    which I imagine you will be glad to be apprised as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n                                                        W. PITT.[77]\r\n\r\nAt the same time he informed his uncle, Earl Temple, of his resolve,\r\nand received the following reply. The italicizing of the Christian name\r\nspeaks for itself:\r\n\r\n                                                Stowe, July 18 1779.\r\n\r\n    I cannot, my dear _William_, but interest myself most warmly in\r\n    whatever relates to your honour or interest; I therefore learn with\r\n    singular pleasure the hopes you conceive that the good old lady,\r\n    the alma mater of Cambridge, may be inclined to treat you as her\r\n    most favourite son. Such a testimony at your age from a learned\r\n    body cannot but be very flattering. As to your prospect of success,\r\n    I cannot form any opinion, being totally unacquainted with every\r\n    circumstance but that of your merit. You must therefore be [_sic_]\r\n    at present to receive from me nothing but sincere assurances of\r\n    my best good wishes and readiness to serve you as may be in my\r\n    power. How far it may be advisable for you before you have more\r\n    ripened in your profession to launch out into the great ocean of\r\n    politicks and expose yourself to the sweet music of those lovely\r\n    syrens, which have already seduced your cousin Thomas from the\r\n    destined and determined object of his life, is a matter of great\r\n    doubt, and the reflection that it is so may prove some consolation\r\n    to you should you not succeed. The memory of your father and the\r\n    great character you have attained speak forcibly in your favour,\r\n    but a dead minister, the most respectable that ever existed, weighs\r\n    very light in the scale against any living one, at least if I may\r\n    guess at your university by her good sister. All therefore I can\r\n    say further is to recommend to you very thoroughly to examine the\r\n    foundation of your hopes before you engage, not suffering your\r\n    conduct to be warped by your wishes; because, if from the event\r\n    this measure shall appear to be lightly taken up, such an outset\r\n    in life will diminish much of those high expectations which you\r\n    have so deservedly raised. Your young old friend and namesake\r\n    salutes you very kindly and gratefully, Hester and Catherine very\r\n    affectionately, without forgetting that antient spinster Mrs.\r\n    Stapleton. We shall be happy to receive you here, candidate or no\r\n    candidate....[78]\r\n\r\n                                                             TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nDespite this response, Pitt resolved to persevere, and that too, though\r\nthe political horizon had darkened owing to the declaration of war\r\nby Spain. At first he avowed his deep concern at this event; but the\r\nnote of hopefulness, which is never long absent from his letters, soon\r\nbegins to reassert itself in the expression of a belief that this new\r\ndanger may “be productive of some good effects at home, and that there\r\nmay still be spirit and resources in the country sufficient to preserve\r\nat least the remnant of a great empire.” This forecast was justified.\r\nThe struggle became one for national existence, waged against our\r\nhereditary rivals, the monarchs of the House of Bourbon; and the\r\nsearchings of heart of England’s sons, at warring against their own\r\nkith and kin, were in large measure stilled. The thrilling incidents\r\nthat accompanied the three years’ siege of Gibraltar by the Spaniards,\r\nour successes in India, and the naval triumphs of the closing years of\r\nthe war showed the hardening of the nation’s fibre under the strain of\r\nadversity and danger.\r\n\r\nAfter residing at Burton Pynsent for some weeks in the autumn in order\r\nto reassure Lady Chatham while the invasion-scare was at its height,\r\nPitt returned to Cambridge at the close of the year, and settled down\r\nat Lincoln’s Inn in the early weeks of 1780. Thanks to the kindness of\r\nhis uncle, Earl Temple, he had been able to procure a lease of rooms on\r\nthe north side of the attic of staircase number 4 of Stone Buildings\r\n(those nearest to Holborn). The sum of £1,100, which in November 1778\r\nhe had pronounced “frightful,” had been advanced on the property which\r\nPitt was to inherit when he came of age.\r\n\r\nConcerning Pitt’s life at Lincoln’s Inn we know next to nothing. The\r\nlack of official records of the Inns of Court, except unilluminating\r\nentries of dates, thwarts all efforts at reconstructing the early life\r\nof many famous men; and the denseness of the gloom which surrounds our\r\ninstitutions, academic and legal, is apt to provoke the investigator\r\nto unpatriotic reflections. Is there any French statesman of modern\r\ntimes about whose early career the records of the institutions with\r\nwhich he was associated are so scanty and uninteresting as are those of\r\nCambridge and Lincoln’s Inn concerning the life of the brilliant son of\r\nChatham?\r\n\r\nAs it is, the investigator at Lincoln’s Inn can discover little more\r\nthan that Pitt was called to the Bar on 12th June 1780, and that on the\r\nnext day a lease was taken out for his rooms for three “lives,” namely,\r\nJohn, Earl of Chatham, aged 23, William Pitt, aged 21, and James\r\nCharles Pitt, aged 18. The rent was £9 9_s._ 10_d._ per annum.[79]\r\n\r\nThe great preoccupation of Pitt, apart from the ever-pressing topic\r\nof national danger, was the movement for Economic Reform. Originating\r\nat York in December 1779, it gathered volume until the petitioners in\r\nthat county alone numbered more than 8,000 freeholders. East Anglia\r\nresponded to the call of Yorkshire; and Pitt hoped to see London rally\r\nto the cause of purity and political freedom. If ever there was a\r\nchance of sweeping away the network of sinecures whereby the King kept\r\nhis hold on the House of Commons, it was now, when the growth of debt\r\nand taxation rendered economy in non-essentials the most urgent of\r\npublic duties.\r\n\r\nIn February 1780 Burke introduced his proposals for Economic Reform\r\nin a speech of great ability. He sought, firstly, to abolish the\r\nspecial jurisdictions in Wales and Cheshire and in the Duchies of\r\nLancaster and Cornwall, which formed petty and extravagant and corrupt\r\ngovernments. The great orator, like a forensic _retiarius_, sought to\r\nenfold his great enemy, Corruption, within the cloak of humour which\r\nhe thus deftly threw in front. Affecting the desire to free the royal\r\nprerogative from irritating and absurd local restrictions, he proceeded\r\nthus: “Cross a brook, and you lose the King of England, but you have\r\nsome comfort in coming again under His Majesty, though shorn of his\r\nbeams, and no more than Prince of Wales. Go to the north and you find\r\nhim dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster. Turn to the west of that north,\r\nand he hops upon you in the humble character of the Earl of Chester.”\r\nEqually difficult and important was Burke’s attempt to reduce the\r\nCivil List and lessen the number of sinecures attached to the King’s\r\nhousehold. He sought to abolish the offices of Master of the Household,\r\nTreasurer, Comptroller, Cofferer, Treasurer of the Chamber, the whole\r\nBoard of Green-Cloth, the Wardrobe and Jewel Offices, the Board of\r\nWorks, and the Keepers of stag-hounds, buck-hounds, fox-hounds,\r\nand harriers, and other well-paid sinecures. With playful irony he\r\ndescribed the clatter of white-sticks and yellow-sticks about the head\r\nof a reformer who would touch those offices, or sought to exclude\r\nthe King’s turnspit from Parliament. As regarded the Civil List, he\r\nproposed to fix its amount immutably, to transfer to the general fund\r\naccounts which had ceased properly to belong to the King’s private\r\npurse, and to regulate the whole on business-like principles. He also\r\nurged the suppression of useless offices in the general administration,\r\nespecially the newly created Secretaryship for the Colonies and the\r\nBoard of Trade, the latter of which then formed a desirable sinecure\r\nfor eight members of Parliament.[80] Most important of all, perhaps,\r\nwas the proposal, brought in by Sir Philip Clerk, to exclude from\r\nParliament contractors--a class which had been proved to have battened\r\non the funds, and to have urged the continuance of the war.\r\n\r\nHad Burke’s proposals stood in need of further vindication, it would\r\nhave been supplied by the mysterious fate which befell them. Members\r\nof Parliament with scarcely an exception loudly commended the measure,\r\nand the eloquence and power with which Burke introduced it to the\r\nHouse. About the same time Lord Shelburne brought forward in the Upper\r\nHouse damning proofs of the greed of contractors and of the gross\r\ncarelessness with which accounts were kept at the Admiralty and War\r\nOffice.[81] The defence of ministers was strong only in personalities.\r\nArgument there was none; and it seemed that the whole festering sudd of\r\ncorruption must be swept away by the flood of popular indignation.\r\n\r\nFrom three of Pitt’s letters, those of 9th and 26th February and 14th\r\nMarch 1780, we can imagine the high hopes of the young reformer as he\r\nlistened to the scathing attack on Ministers by Lord Shelburne, and\r\nthe comprehensive indictment framed by Burke. In the second letter he\r\nnotes with joy the drop of the ministerial majority to two; and in the\r\nsmall hours of 14th March he was privileged to witness the stormy scene\r\nwhich occurred when Burke by a majority of eight carried his motion for\r\nabolishing the Board of Trade. And yet the sudd did not move. Despite\r\nthe success of reformers in the House, and the growing excitement among\r\ntheir associations in the country, the clogging influences of the past\r\nprevailed. Members who praised Burke for his lofty and statesmanlike\r\naims, voted in committee against the details of his scheme. Little by\r\nlittle it disappeared; and, in face of the greed, cowardice, or apathy\r\nof Parliament, Burke soon declared his indifference as to the fate of\r\nthe few remaining clauses of his measure. The bill for the exclusion\r\nof contractors from Parliament passed the Commons, but was thrown out\r\nby the Lords.\r\n\r\nAnother surprise was in store for the House and the country. On 6th\r\nApril Mr. Dunning brought forward a motion that “the influence of the\r\nCrown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be lessened.” The\r\nmotion was made suddenly and on the day when numerous petitions were\r\nlaid on the table, signed by thousands of persons, on behalf of shorter\r\nparliaments and a larger addition to the representatives of counties\r\nwho, as a rule, showed some independence. The proposal produced a\r\ngreat sensation. Ministers seemed to be “stunned.” Pitt’s relative,\r\nThomas Pitt of Boccanoc, ably supported this daring motion. The Speaker\r\nhimself left the chair and spoke in support of it, and the resolution,\r\nafter a trifling change of form, was passed by a majority of eighteen.\r\nBut again the forces of obscurantism triumphed. Apparently Dunning owed\r\nhis success solely to the fear of the imminence of a general election,\r\nand as that fear lessened, so also did the numbers of the popular\r\nparty in the House. North slowly but surely regained his hold on the\r\nwaverers, and succeeded in defeating a motion begging the King not to\r\ndissolve or prorogue Parliament until steps had been taken to diminish\r\nthe influence of the Crown at elections (24th April).\r\n\r\nFor the present Pitt stifled his disappointment at this fiasco by\r\nattendance at the opera and masquerades, so we may judge from his\r\nletters; but he probably hardened his resolve to effect the Reform\r\nof Parliament itself, which, as was now clear to all but Burke, must\r\nprecede any attempt to cleanse the Augean stables of the Court and the\r\nAdministration. That gifted thinker but somewhat erratic politician,\r\nwhose character will concern us later, had gone so far as to defend the\r\nstate of the representation and to urge reformers to concentrate their\r\nefforts on the task of freeing Parliament from the corrupt influences\r\nthat were warping its character. To this belief he still clung, in\r\nspite of the recent damning proof that a Parliament of place-hunters\r\nand borough-mongers had refused to root out the canker of corruption,\r\neven at a time of great national danger. Pitt, for his part, looked for\r\nsafety to that course of action which Chatham had so often taken; he\r\nturned away from Parliament and fixed his hopes in the nation. Even the\r\noratory of Burke failed to satisfy him. He found in his great speech of\r\n11th February not only “real beauties,” but “ridiculous affectations.”\r\nHe added, however, in his letter of 14th March: “I have heard two less\r\nstudied harangues from him since in reply that please me much more\r\nthan this does now that it is upon paper.” This criticism, coming from\r\nthe son of Chatham, is a little surprising; but it may be considered\r\nsymptomatic. As will appear later, there was something in Burke’s\r\ntemperament which jarred on the young statesman.\r\n\r\nWhile disagreeing with Burke and the more academic wing of the\r\nreformers, Pitt did not consort with the men on the extreme left who\r\nnow raised a great clamour through the country. He seems to have had no\r\ndealings at this time with the Reform or “Œconomic” Associations; and\r\nevents now occurred which helped for a time to distract his attention\r\nfrom politics. While he was expecting to be called to the Bar, London\r\nfell a prey to the Lord George Gordon rioters (2nd to 9th June).\r\n\r\nWhat must have been the disgust of the young patrician as he gazed at\r\nthe scenes of rapine and drunkenness which went on under the name of\r\nProtestantism! The pretence of bigotry was soon flung aside, and then,\r\nwhen the thin crust of civilization was removed, men saw appalled the\r\ndepths of villany that usually are hidden. For days the passions of\r\nthe mob raged unchecked by timorous magistrates and ministers. The\r\nKing alone was undismayed, and finally insisted on the use of vigorous\r\nmeasures. Thanks to his staunchness, the wheels of government began to\r\nmove once more. Then the orgy quickly died down; but it left men with a\r\ndread of the newly-revealed Caliban, and a heightened respect for the\r\none man whose firmness had ensured the vindication of law and order.\r\nHow much the popular cause then suffered can never be known. When,\r\nin the course of the French Revolution, the Parisian mob carried the\r\nKing and Queen from Versailles to Paris and completed its triumph at\r\nthe harvest time of 1792, Englishmen viewed those events in the lurid\r\nlight thrown by the flames of the Lord George Gordon riots; and it is\r\nprobable that Pitt himself was no stranger to this feeling.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Parliamentary Reform in England also suffered untold harm.\r\nWhy talk about manhood suffrage, vote by ballot and annual Parliaments,\r\nas the Westminster Committee had talked, when all around were proofs\r\nof the savagery of the many-headed monster? The Duke of Richmond, who\r\nthen, along with Fox, advocated a programme of reform which was to\r\nfurnish the Chartists with their “six points,” confessed in a letter to\r\nShelburne that the riots “will tend to discredit any attempts of the\r\npeople to do themselves justice on any future occasion when the cause\r\nmay warrant it”;[82] and though Charles James Fox retained his faith\r\nin the cause, yet he and all other democrats thenceforth found it a\r\nhopeless task to roll the stone up to the point to which the enthusiasm\r\nof the people carried it in the spring of 1780. After midsummer of that\r\nyear the various committees and associations preached to deaf ears. The\r\nKing had won.\r\n\r\nTo return to Pitt’s fortunes, we may note that Lincoln’s Inn had been\r\nin no immediate danger from the rioters, though surrounded with flames\r\non all sides. In order to be ready for the worst, the benchers took\r\narms and formed a corps, in which Pitt had his first experience of\r\nvolunteering. The records of the Inn, however, show that it was also\r\ndefended by 800 men of the Northumberland Militia, the sum of £364\r\n12_s._ 0_d._ being paid for provisions to them for the ten days during\r\nwhich they were in garrison.[83]\r\n\r\nThe desire of the resident members of the Inn worthily to entertain\r\nthe officers of that corps led to the appointment of a committee for\r\nthat purpose, which included Pitt, Pepper Arden (afterwards Lord\r\nAlvanley), Mitford (afterwards Lord Redesdale), Bland Burges, and three\r\nothers. The last named, in his reminiscences, tells how, when his turn\r\ncame, he invited Gibbon and Lord Carmarthen to meet four officers\r\nand other company at dinner. The historian, as is well known, was a\r\nmost entertaining talker, flitting easily from one topic to another,\r\nand lighting up all with sallies of wit which the listeners were\r\nexpected to receive with deferential applause and unquestioning mirth.\r\nJudge then of his astonishment, when, after one of his best foreign\r\nanecdotes, which touched on “the fashionable levities of political\r\ndoctrine then prevalent,” a deep but clear voice was heard from the\r\nfar end of the table calmly but civilly impugning the correctness of\r\nthe story and the propriety of its political connexion. The applause\r\nceased at once, and Gibbon turned his gaze petulantly on the slim youth\r\nwho had dared to challenge his unquestioned supremacy, and sat there\r\nquietly eating grapes. As the interruption had been hailed with too\r\nmuch approval to be ignored or dismissed with a frown, he endeavoured\r\nto crush the youth by heavy artillery. A spirited fire came in return,\r\nand a sharp duel of wits began, which the company followed with the\r\nkeenest interest. Finally the skill and vigour of the attack drove the\r\nhistorian from one position after another and left him defenceless;\r\nwhereupon he left the room in high dudgeon. In vain did Bland Burges\r\nseek in the anteroom to calm his feelings and persuade him to return.\r\n“By no means,” replied Gibbon; “that young gentleman is, I have no\r\ndoubt, extremely ingenious and agreeable, but I must acknowledge that\r\nhis style of conversation is not exactly what I am accustomed to,\r\nso you must positively excuse me.” Meanwhile Pitt continued to hold\r\nforth on the topic in dispute, “which he discussed with such ability,\r\nstrength of argument, and eloquence, that his hearers were filled with\r\nprofound admiration.”[84]\r\n\r\nSuch was the first recorded triumph of Pitt. Would that we knew more\r\nthan the bare outlines of the discussion! But an unkind fate has\r\nvouchsafed here, as at so many points, enough of information to whet\r\nthe appetite for more, enough to give us the merest glimpse of those\r\nsurprising powers which easily discomfited Gibbon at his prime.\r\n\r\nWe know little about the extent of Pitt’s legal attainments or his\r\nskill as a pleader. His practice was to last but a short time. Three\r\ndays after the end of the riots he was called to the Bar and afterwards\r\nwent on the Western Circuit, of which he was a member. As to the\r\nimpression aroused by his pleading, I have found very few particulars\r\nexcept the statement in an almost contemporary biography that his first\r\ncase, which must have been in London, was one concerning an East India\r\ntrade dispute, and that he attracted the notice of Lord Mansfield\r\non the Bench. He is said to have acted as junior counsel in several\r\ncases at Dorchester and Exeter, and to have commanded attention by the\r\nforce of his reasoning rather than attracted it by playing upon the\r\nemotions. His style, in short, was clear and argumentative rather than\r\n“attractive and passionate.”[85] From Exeter he was recalled in haste\r\nby news which was of far higher interest to him than the quarrels of\r\nWessex squires and traders. The King had dissolved Parliament and had\r\nfixed 31st October for the date of assembly of its successor.\r\n\r\nThis action was what might have been expected from the most astute of\r\nelectioneering agents. Disgust at the excesses of the Gordon rioters\r\nwas still the dominant motive in the political world, and at such a\r\ntime men looked askance at Reform. Further, in order to ensure the\r\nsuccess of what he termed “my cause,” George III condescended to the\r\narts of the canvasser, entering the shop of a draper at Windsor, and\r\nsaying in his quick peremptory way--“The queen wants a gown, wants a\r\ngown. No Keppel. No Keppel.” Windsor rejected Keppel; Burke failed to\r\nkeep his seat at Bristol; and Pitt made no impression whatever on the\r\nToryism of the University of Cambridge. In any case his election was\r\nhighly improbable. Dons and country clergymen are not wont to favour\r\nthe claims of a young and unknown candidate; but the trend of thought\r\nat that time made his defeat certain.\r\n\r\nHe bore it with his usual serenity. “Mansfield and Townshend have\r\nrun away with the prize,” so he wrote on 16th September, “but my\r\nstruggle has not been dishonourable.” He now once more betook himself\r\nto legal affairs at Lincoln’s Inn, but his thoughts still centred in\r\nWestminster. Despite the stagnation which marked our public life after\r\nthe victory of the King and Lord North at the general election, the\r\nfate of the commonwealth drew Pitt to St. Stephen’s for the earlier\r\nhalf of every day. His regular attendance at the House was perhaps\r\ninstrumental in furthering his dearest hopes. The Duke of Rutland had\r\nbeen on cordial terms with Pitt at Cambridge; and he now mentioned the\r\ntalents of his friend to Sir James Lowther. That magnate of Cumberland,\r\nwho could secure the return of eleven candidates, welcomed the\r\nsuggestion that Pitt should enter Parliament for one of his seats, and,\r\nwith a generosity none too common among owners of “pocket boroughs,”\r\noffered him a seat at Appleby unconditionally, save that he (Pitt) was\r\nto resign his seat if his political views should in the future become\r\nopposed to those of his patron.[86]\r\n\r\nTo this condition even the proud son of Chatham could not demur; and,\r\nthough the connection with what was practically a pocket borough could\r\nnot be quite palatable to a reformer, yet he doubtless remembered that\r\nhis father first entered Parliament as member for Old Sarum.\r\n\r\nWhile we smile at the vagaries of the old system, which enabled “the\r\ngreat commoner” to begin his public career as representative of an\r\nuntenanted mound, and his son as member for a town which he did not\r\neven visit, let us remember that occasionally it opened a door easily\r\nfor a man of genius. Gladstone, in his Tory years, eulogized the system\r\non these grounds;[87] and it is certainly remarkable that, besides the\r\ntwo Pitts, many other famous men used these stepping-stones. Burke,\r\nthrough most of his public life, was member for a pocket borough,\r\nWendover or Malton; and Canning entered Parliament as member for a\r\nscarcely discoverable village, Newtown, in the Isle of Wight. Fox and\r\nPeel also entered Parliament by similar means. However quaintly the old\r\norder of things misrepresented the British people, it did now and then\r\nhelp to bring brilliant men to the front with a speed that is no longer\r\npossible. But it is noteworthy that young men of spirit took care to be\r\nsoon quit of pocket boroughs.[88]\r\n\r\nAppleby having duly registered the decree of Sir James Lowther at the\r\nclose of 1780, Pitt took his seat in the House of Commons on 23rd\r\nJanuary 1781. From that time to the very same day in the year 1806 when\r\nhe breathed his last, he was to expend his life in strenuous efforts\r\nthroughout a quarter of a century which comprised such events as the\r\nclose of the American War, the new grouping of the Powers of Europe,\r\nthe French Revolution, and the rise of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAT WESTMINSTER AND GOOSTREE’S\r\n\r\n    A series of undesigned changes brought the English Constitution to\r\n    such a condition that satisfaction and impatience, the two great\r\n    sources of political conduct, were both reasonably gratified by\r\n    it.--SIR HENRY MAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present age, marked by peaceful relations between the different\r\nparts of the Empire and by complete accord between the sovereign and\r\nhis people, it is difficult to realize the condition of public affairs\r\nat the time when Pitt entered Parliament. The war with the United\r\nStates, France, Spain and Holland, threatened the ruin of the nation,\r\nand it further brought to a climax a constitutional crisis of great\r\nimportance. That struggle had resulted in no small measure from the\r\npersonal methods of rule of George III; and, despite the disastrous\r\ninfluence of that policy on the Empire, there was still the chance of\r\nits winning at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this paradox is to be found in the composition of the\r\nHouse of Commons and in the character of the King. Ten years had\r\nelapsed since the publication of Burke’s indictment, that, whereas in\r\nthe previous century the distempers of monarchy had been the chief\r\ncause for fear, now the main apprehension centred in the distempers\r\nof Parliament.[89] The facts given above, and those soon to be set\r\nforth, will show that the danger was still acute. The rallying of\r\npractically the whole of the Tory party to the King’s side, the\r\ndivision of the Whigs into two chief groups, neither of which had any\r\ndefinite programme, the enormous power which the monarch wielded over\r\nthe members of the Lower House by means of “influence,” and, last but\r\nnot least, the revival of his prestige owing to the Lord George Gordon\r\ncrisis, all served to strengthen his hand even against reformers who\r\nstruggled for peace abroad and economy and purity in the administration.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the disintegration of the party system and the corruption of\r\nthe House of Commons had provided George III with a most favourable\r\nopportunity for realizing the ideals set forth in Bolingbroke’s\r\n“Patriot King.” The old parties had for the time lost their _raison\r\nd’être_. All but a few fossilized Tory squires had given up the cause\r\nof the Stuarts. The Whigs could no longer claim to be defenders of\r\nthe House of Brunswick and the liberties of England. For more than a\r\ncentury they had settled down comfortably on the spoils of office,\r\nuntil the sight of their magnates affecting to slay the slain and\r\nbattening on the nation’s spoils aroused general resentment. Of this\r\nfeeling the King had made dexterous use. In the name of the nation he\r\nclaimed to set aside the parties and govern in the interests of the\r\nwhole. As generally happens in such cases, he called into being another\r\nparty, the King’s Friends, which, under the guise of acting for the\r\nnation, gradually ensured the subservience of Parliament to the royal\r\nwill. By dint of honours, places, and money, the new policy won its\r\nway, until, as we have seen, it could defy the efforts for Reform. To\r\nthe eye of alarmed patriots it seemed that the House of Commons would\r\nsoon be little more than a tool of the King, and that George III would\r\nsucceed in the enterprise which had cost Charles I his head.\r\n\r\nThere were some grounds for these fears. George III was on the whole\r\na more formidable opponent than the first Charles. While lacking the\r\npersonal charm of the Stuart sovereign and his power of calling forth\r\nenthusiastic service, he far excelled him in common sense and the power\r\nof adapting means to ends. Both men believed thoroughly in their cause,\r\nstruggled with obstinate persistence towards the goal, and yet showed\r\ngreat finesse in the use to which they put men and events. Outwardly\r\nand mentally, they had nothing in common. Yet the parallel between\r\nthem is closer than would at first sight appear. In a political sense\r\nGeorge III is a rather gross replica of Charles I. Even the highest\r\nof Anglicans has never been tempted to canonize him; for, in truth,\r\nhe lived in a material age, and had too great a belief in material\r\ninterests ever to be in danger of “martyrdom.”\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, lay the real danger to the liberties of England in the\r\ndecade, 1770–80. They are more likely to be undermined by an appeal to\r\nmaterial interests than by an open attack. Charles was foolish enough\r\nto assail both the consciences and the pockets of his subjects. George\r\nleft consciences alone, and made use of the pockets of the governing\r\nclasses to achieve his ends. This sapping process was more likely to\r\nsucceed than a hasty attack above ground. The policy of Charles I\r\nbraced men to resistance; that of George III drugged and enervated\r\nthem.[90] Early in the seventeenth century Parliament was the champion\r\nof the nation’s liberties; now there was some fear that it might\r\ndegenerate into a King’s Council. Parliament is but the register of the\r\nnation’s will; and torpor at St. Stephen’s bespoke political deadness\r\nthroughout the land. Here, perhaps, was the most threatening symptom of\r\nall. The attempt to manipulate Parliament could come near to success\r\nonly in an age of high living and plain thinking. Even the disasters\r\nof the American War did not awaken England at once. Her monitor was\r\nsleeping the sleep of surfeit. What were defeats on the other side\r\nof the Atlantic to the members for the pocket boroughs who virtually\r\ncontrolled the House for the King’s cause? To what effect was it that\r\nLondon and Westminster now and again chafed at the losses of the war,\r\nwhen those cities returned only eight members, as against Cornwall’s\r\nforty-four? Episodes like those connected with the names of Wilkes and\r\nLord George Gordon roused for a time storms of tropical violence; but\r\nwhen they died down there ensued long and enervating lulls. All went\r\non once more as in a land of lotus-eaters, who scarcely heeded the dim\r\nmutterings that came across the western ocean. Even the disaster at\r\nYorktown, which virtually ended the American War, did not thoroughly\r\narouse the nation. Two months after the receipt of that news, Romilly\r\nwrote to a friend, “The nation seems fallen into a deep sleep.”[91]\r\n\r\nThe distributor of the soporific fruit seemed to be equal to every\r\nemergency. Lord North was a coarse and heavy man, with a wide mouth,\r\nthick lips, and puffy cheeks, which seemed typical of his policy. He\r\nresembled Walpole in his knowledge of men’s foibles and contempt of\r\nhumanity. True, he excelled him in affability; but he signally fell\r\nbehind him in the sterner qualities which master men and beat down\r\nobstacles. For eleven years he had been chief Minister of the Crown,\r\nlatterly much against his will; and for fourteen months more the\r\nimperious monarch was to hold him to his post.\r\n\r\nWith Lord North were associated in the year 1781 men who were\r\nfully contented with the task of supervising their own departments\r\nand the patronage belonging to them. The most noteworthy of these\r\nMinisters were Lord Thurlow, a man of low tastes and violent temper,\r\nbut considerable gifts for intrigue, who acted officially as Lord\r\nChancellor and unofficially as chief of “the King’s friends”; Earl\r\nBathurst, Lord President; Germain (Viscount Sackville), Secretary of\r\nState for the Colonies; Lord Townshend, Master of the Ordnance; Mr.\r\nJenkinson (afterwards the Earl of Liverpool), Secretary at War; the\r\nEarl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty; the Earl of Carlisle,\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and Mr. William Eden (afterwards Lord\r\nAuckland), Chief Secretary at Dublin Castle. The personality of some\r\nof these men will appear more fitly in the sequel. Here we may note\r\nthat they resembled highly paid confidential clerks, working under\r\nthe general direction of the King, rather than responsible Ministers.\r\nOf collective action and responsibility there was little under Lord\r\nNorth.[92] George III acted on the principle that had guided the\r\nCaesars, _Divide et impera_.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the system and such were the men who now had to\r\nconfront a world in arms. Apart from the interminable conflict in\r\nAmerica, the area of strife was spreading in Europe; for the Dutch,\r\nincensed by our maritime policy, were on the point of declaring war. In\r\nIndia Hyder Ali was ravaging the Carnatic; and Britons, looking forth\r\nin fear from Madras, could see the clouds of smoke that told of his\r\ndevastations. In the Mediterranean Gibraltar still stoutly held out\r\nagainst the Franco-Spanish forces, but our possession, Minorca, was\r\nsoon to fall. In the Baltic the League of the Armed Neutrality held\r\nthe sword dangling over Briton’s commerce, and was kept from striking\r\nonly by the skill of Sir James Harris, our envoy at St. Petersburg, in\r\nplaying on the foibles of Catharine II.\r\n\r\nYet against most of these difficulties British energy ultimately made\r\nheadway; and they did not at present disturb the course of events in\r\nParliament, with which we are here more especially concerned. The\r\nOpposition was divided into two chief groups, which had not yet begun\r\nto coalesce under the pressure of national calamity. The larger of\r\nthese was the official Whig party under the nominal leadership of the\r\nMarquis of Rockingham, an affable and tactful man, with little strength\r\nof character, formidable only from his connections with the great Whig\r\nHouses. Among his followers two men stood forth, of powers so great and\r\nvaried as to claim our attention at once. These were Fox and Burke.\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox (1749–1806), the second son of Lord Holland, was\r\nnow in the prime of his powers. Nature had dowered him with gifts\r\nso rich and varied as not to have been seriously marred even by the\r\ndissipations into which his father had encouraged him to plunge before\r\nhe left Eton. While at Hertford College, Oxford, he gave proofs of his\r\neager, vivacious, lovable temperament, and imbibed that passion for\r\nthe classics and for all great literature which was to be his solace\r\nthrough life. Well would it have been for him had this been his only\r\npassion; unfortunately he never shook off the vices contracted in\r\nyouth. His amour with Mrs. Armstead was notorious and avowed. Equally\r\nharmful was his mania for gambling. Many a time he ruined his speeches\r\nin the House by the fatigue or annoyance due to the losses of an\r\nall-night sitting at Brooks’s. But whether he lost or won, whether\r\ncaressed by Ministers in Parliament or turned out of his rooms in St.\r\nJames’s Street by Jews and bailiffs,[93] he was ever beloved, even by\r\nthose whom he belaboured in the House.\r\n\r\nHis oratorical gifts were the outcome of a powerful mind, and they\r\nwere enhanced by a melodious voice and forcible action. Perhaps the\r\ngreatest charm of his speeches was their ease and naturalness. He spoke\r\nas if without premeditation, and at times he indulged in repetitions\r\nand digressions to an unpardonable extent. But all such faults and\r\noccasional carelessness in the choice of words scarcely lessened the\r\neffect of his efforts, which seemed to his hearers to be above all\r\nart. The unfailing vigour of thought, the power with which he could\r\nfirst recapitulate the arguments of his opponents and then tear them\r\nin pieces, and the good humour, which rarely left him even in his most\r\nscornful moods, served alike to convince and captivate the House. He\r\nwas the prince of debaters, surpassing even Chatham himself in ease,\r\nwit, skill, and versatility, though lacking that awe-inspiring faculty\r\nthat swayed Parliament as with a Jove-like frown. The years 1780–82\r\nsaw him at the height of his powers. Grattan afterwards remarked that\r\nno one could realize the force of Fox’s oratory who had not heard him\r\nbefore his unnatural coalition with Lord North in 1783, after which\r\nevent he always seemed on the defensive: “the mouth still spoke great\r\nthings, but the swell of soul was no more.”[94] How great must have\r\nbeen his blunders and indiscretions, both in public and private life,\r\nto have blighted a career of so transcendent a promise.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Edmund Burke belongs rather to the sphere of literature\r\nand political philosophy than to that of political action. Great in\r\nthought and great in his powers of oratory, he yet failed to impress\r\nthe House of Commons, or the public at large; his speeches were too\r\nornate, too overburdened with learning and reasoning, to please an\r\naudience that is plain, practical, and apt to be impressed more by the\r\nspeaker himself than by the fullness of his arguments or the beauty of\r\nhis style. In a word, Burke lacked the indefinable gift which Chatham,\r\nFox, and Mirabeau so abundantly possessed--that of personality. His\r\nfigure had not the forceful massiveness of that of Fox, and it wanted\r\nthe dignity of the younger Pitt. Moreover his voice was harsh, and his\r\naction clumsy. His philosophic love of wedding facts to principles\r\noften led him to soar to heights where the question at issue appeared\r\nlike a speck and votes a vulgar impertinence. Worst fault of all, his\r\nspeeches were far too long. The fullness and richness which delights us\r\nto-day then had the effect of emptying the House. The result of it all\r\nwas the decline of his influence and the increase of his irritability,\r\nCeltic vivacity leading him more than once shrilly to chide friends\r\nwho sought to pull him back to his seat. These failings, together with\r\nthe number of his impecunious relatives, probably explain why he never\r\nattained to Cabinet rank. In a subordinate office in the year 1783\r\nhe showed signal want of tact and discernment. Thus, in contrasting\r\nthe effect produced by the perusal of his great orations with that\r\nwhich gained him the nickname of the dinner-bell of the House, one is\r\nreminded of the truth of the bitter line levelled at him by Goldsmith:\r\n\r\n  And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.\r\n\r\nThe other group, which rivalled the official Whigs in the zeal of\r\nits opposition to Lord North, was that of the former followers of\r\nChatham. They had neither organization nor a programme; but in general\r\nthey inherited the imperial sentiments and non-partisan traditions of\r\nthat great leader. They were less eager than the Rockingham group for\r\nparliamentary reform and the limiting of the royal prerogative; but,\r\nlike the Girondins of the French Revolution, the indefiniteness of\r\ntheir aims left much liberty of action to their following; and Pitt,\r\nwho naturally attached himself to this group, rivalled Fox in his zeal\r\nfor Reform, both economic and parliamentary.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Chathamites was the Earl of Shelburne, who had been\r\ndriven into opposition by the arbitrary conduct of the King at the\r\ntime of the Wilkes affair. The estimates of his character are very\r\ndiverse. Burke wrote of him privately in 1783 as “this wicked man, and\r\nno less weak and stupid than false and hypocritical,” his chief crime\r\nbeing that of breaking in pieces the Whig party. Few persons would\r\nhave gone so far as the vehement Irishman, who, on these lower levels,\r\nallowed party passion to dull his eagle glance. Shelburne was one of\r\nthe _grands seigneurs_ and political thinkers of the time. Polite and\r\ncourtly, he dazzled men by the splendour of his hospitality. In his\r\nlibrary he shone as a scholar and philosopher, and his conversation was\r\nthe index of his keen and supple intellect. In public life he showed\r\nthat he never lacked courage. Yet there was always something wanting\r\nabout Shelburne. His speech and manner passed so quickly and easily\r\nfrom the affable to the severe as to beget feelings of distrust. His\r\nenemies accused him of duplicity and dubbed him Malagrida, a well-known\r\nPortuguese Jesuit.[95]\r\n\r\nWe may note here that Pitt either shared or deferred to the general\r\nfeeling about Shelburne when he omitted him from his Cabinet in\r\nDecember 1783.\r\n\r\nSome of the specific charges against Shelburne (and most of them are\r\nvague) have vanished now that the mists of passion, amidst which he\r\never moved, have cleared away.[96] It is the lot of some men to arouse\r\nundeserved dislike or distrust, owing to unfortunate mannerisms. Yet it\r\nis certain that England owes much to the earl. He was one of the first\r\nto espouse the Free Trade principles of Adam Smith; he was chiefly\r\nresponsible for the terms of peace of 1782–3; and the admiration of\r\nBenjamin Franklin for him largely conduced to the signature of the\r\npreliminaries with the United States. Posterity has therefore accorded\r\nto him a far higher place than was allowed by the jealousy or pettiness\r\nof his contemporaries. Such was the leader to whom Pitt attached\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOn 25th January 1781 Shelburne protested manfully against the\r\noverbearing conduct of our Government in ordering the capture of\r\nDutch merchantmen before the outbreak of war, and inveighed against\r\nthe policy of the Ministry as fatal to liberty and to the welfare of\r\nthe Empire. Finally he declared that the tactics of Government had\r\nproved that the conquest of the American colonies, if it could be\r\naccomplished, would entail fatal results at home; that he would be\r\nbetter pleased to see his country free, though curtailed in power and\r\nwealth, than acquiring greatness, if greatness were to be purchased at\r\nthe expense of her constitution and liberty. The speech rang true to\r\nthe traditions of Chatham; and it awoke responsive echoes in the breast\r\nof his son.[97]\r\n\r\nWithin the space of five weeks Pitt proved that his support was of the\r\nhighest value. In a maiden speech, which perhaps bears away the palm\r\nfrom the first efforts of the greatest orators of all time, he gave\r\nproof of those astonishing powers which nature seemed to have implanted\r\nin a state of maturity. Practice and experience were to perfect them;\r\nbut they then left on all his hearers an impression of wonder as at\r\nsomething almost supernatural in a youth of twenty-one years. This\r\nfeeling was all the more natural as the speech dealt with economic\r\nsubjects, which Wilberforce regarded as “of a low and vulgarizing\r\nquality.”[98]\r\n\r\nWe must pause here to notice that the topic of economy was at that time\r\nof burning interest. On the whole it excited more general attention\r\nthan the subject of parliamentary reform. In fact the latter was\r\ninsisted on by practical men mainly with the view of stopping the\r\nfrightful waste that resulted from sinecures, jobs, and other forms\r\nof corruption in the public service. Rigid doctrinaires like Major\r\nCartwright might dilate on the heaven-born right of every man to have\r\na vote, or depict the beauty of an electoral system which enlisted\r\nthe virtuous energies of every citizen and called on him to renew\r\nParliament every year, that being the natural time of renewal of all\r\nthings.[99] A still stiffer theorist, Jebb, might go further and\r\ninsist on the election of a new Parliament for each session. Together\r\nthey might call for the ballot, equal electoral areas, and payment of\r\nmembers. Yet their arguments would have fallen on deaf ears but for\r\nthe strain of war taxes, the dullness of trade, and the blunderings of\r\nplacemen high in office. When London, Bristol, and Yorkshire felt the\r\npinch of hard times, national expenditure became a matter of the most\r\nurgent concern.\r\n\r\nIt was in support of Burke’s proposals for the better regulation of the\r\nKing’s Civil List and for abolishing several sinecures that Pitt made\r\nhis maiden speech in the House (26th February 1781). At once he lifted\r\nthe subject to a high level. The measure, he said, would have come with\r\nmore grace, and with more benefit to the public service, had it sprung\r\nfrom the royal breast. Ministers ought themselves to have proposed\r\nit, thereby showing that His Majesty desired to participate in the\r\nsuffering of the Empire.\r\n\r\n    They ought to consult the glory of their royal master, and seat\r\n    him in the hearts of his people, by abating from magnificence what\r\n    is due to necessity.... The abridgment of useless and unnecessary\r\n    expense can be no abatement of royalty. Magnificence and grandeur\r\n    are not inconsistent with retrenchment and economy, but, on the\r\n    contrary, in a time of necessity and of common exertion, solid\r\n    grandeur is dependent on the reduction of expense; and it is the\r\n    general sentiment and observation of the House that economy is at\r\n    this hour essentially necessary to national salvation.\r\n\r\nHe next ventured on an argument scarcely consistent with the assumption\r\nof the royal graciousness and generosity touched on in his first period\r\nby asserting that the most important object of the bill was\r\n\r\n    The reduction of the influence of the Crown--that influence which\r\n    the last Parliament, by an express resolution, had declared to be\r\n    increasing, and that it ought to be diminished--an influence which\r\n    was more to be dreaded, because more secret in its attacks, and\r\n    more concealed in its operations than the power of prerogative.\r\n\r\nAfter referring briefly to this delicate subject, he held up to scorn\r\nthose who ridiculed the proposal on the ground that it would effect a\r\nsaving of only £200,000 a year; as if the calamities of the present\r\ncrisis were too great to be benefited by economy: as if, when millions\r\nwere being spent, there was no need to think of thousands! Finally he\r\ndeclared that the Civil List had been granted by Parliament to His\r\nMajesty, not for his personal gratification, but in order\r\n\r\n    to support the power and the interests of the Empire, to maintain\r\n    its grandeur, and pay the judges and the foreign ministers, and to\r\n    maintain justice.... The people, who granted that revenue, under\r\n    the circumstances of the occasion, were justified in resuming a\r\n    part of it under the pressing demand of an altered situation. They\r\n    clearly felt their right; but they exercised it with pain and\r\n    regret. They approached the throne with hearts afflicted at the\r\n    necessity of applying for retrenchment of the royal gratifications;\r\n    but the request was at once loyal and submissive. It was justified\r\n    by policy, and His Majesty’s compliance with the request was\r\n    inculcated by prudence as well as by affection.[100]\r\n\r\nAdmiration of the perfect manner in which the speech was delivered\r\nseems to have blinded contemporaries to its importance as a political\r\npronouncement. Certainly in both respects it is remarkable. No speech\r\never won more general and more immediate praise. Burke declared the\r\nyoung orator to be not merely a chip of the old block but the old block\r\nitself. Charles James Fox hurried up to offer his congratulations on\r\nthis oratorical triumph, and further showed his regard by proposing\r\nPitt as a member of Brooks’s club--a connection which he maintained\r\nunbroken through life. Lord North described the oration as the best\r\nfirst speech that he had ever heard; and another member of the House,\r\nStorer, commenting on the self-possession of the young speaker, which\r\nwas far removed from “improper assurance,” remarked that there was\r\nnot a word or a look that one would have wished to correct.[101] In\r\nan age when dignity of diction and grace of deportment were deemed\r\nessential to the success of a speech--that was the time when Windham\r\nused to spend hours beforehand in framing elegant _juncturae_ for\r\nhis periods--the verdicts quoted above imply in a young speaker the\r\npossession of a profusion of gifts and graces no less remarkable than\r\nthe maturity of judgment which harmonized them.\r\n\r\nAlas, the reader of to-day cannot fully realize the witchery of his\r\ndiction, instinct with the fervour of youth, but balanced by the\r\nsagacity of manhood. The printed word can never reveal the nature\r\nof the spell cast on listeners by a noble countenance, harmonious\r\ngestures, musical cadences, and the free outpouring of inspiring\r\nthoughts. No great speeches, except those of a pre-eminently literary\r\nquality, such as shines in the stately rhetoric of Burke, can be\r\nappreciated apart from the speakers. It is the man who gives life to\r\nthe words. A fervent admirer of Chatham’s oratory summed up his chief\r\nimpression in the suggestive remark that there was something in the\r\nspeaker finer than his words; “that the man was infinitely greater than\r\nthe orator.” This must be so, if the speaker is to keep attention on\r\ntip-toe, ever on the look-out for new effects and charms. Hope is a\r\nnecessary element in all admiration. The hearer, to be enthralled, must\r\nhave been wafted up to that state of ecstasy wherein delight at present\r\nbeauties is intensified by the expectation of other charms yet to come.\r\nShakespeare has once for all time portrayed this mental bliss in the\r\nyoung and eager love of Florizel for Perdita:\r\n\r\n                          What you do\r\n  Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,\r\n  I’ld have you do it ever.\r\n\r\nSome such wealth of gifts the Commons of Britain discerned in Pitt in\r\nthat springtide of hope. Theirs was to be a rich harvest of joy. Ours\r\nis but a lean aftermath.\r\n\r\nThe reader, who naturally thinks more about the matter of this speech\r\nthan the manner of its delivery, will be most impressed by the boldness\r\nof some of the arguments. That a new member should venture to remind\r\nParliament and the nation of the King’s control over the Civil List\r\nbeing that of a steward, not of a proprietor, was daring enough; but it\r\nis startling to find the future champion of the Crown asserting that\r\nthe nation could _resume_ at least a part of what it had granted. There\r\nis no essential difference between this plea and the dictum of Rousseau\r\n(used so effectively by the French Revolutionists against the King and\r\nthe Church) that the hypothetical contract once framed between prince\r\nand people empowered the latter at any time to enter into possession of\r\nproperty which was held merely in trust on their behalf. The sentiments\r\nexpressed in Pitt’s first speech enable us to gauge the astonishment\r\nof the world when the young orator at the close of 1783 became first\r\nMinister of the Crown.\r\n\r\nHis second speech, delivered on 31st May, was perhaps less effective\r\nthan the first, though it marks an advance in argumentative power\r\nand the handling of details. Colonel Barré had proposed that the\r\ncommissioners who supervised the public accounts should be chosen from\r\nthe House of Commons. After a hostile speech from Lord North, Pitt rose\r\nto support the motion. He pointed out how essential this proposal was\r\nfor the maintenance of the power of the Commons. He continued thus:\r\n\r\n    Every branch of the legislature has something peculiar to\r\n    distinguish and to characterize it; and that which at once gives\r\n    the character and elevation of the Commons House of Parliament is\r\n    that they hold the strings of the national purse, and are entrusted\r\n    with the great important power, first of granting the money, and\r\n    then of correcting the expenditure. To delegate this right, then,\r\n    is a violation of what gives them their chief consequence in the\r\n    legislature, and what, above all other privileges, they cannot\r\n    surrender or delegate without a violent breach of the constitution.\r\n\r\nTracking the Prime Minister into detail after detail, he finally begged\r\nthe House to pass the motion as necessary for the prosperity of the\r\nland and as a pledge of further reforms.\r\n\r\n    But (said he) if the motion is rejected, and the old and vicious\r\n    system of government is in every point tenaciously adhered to, the\r\n    freedom of the people and the independence of this House must be\r\n    buried in the same grave with the power, the opulence and the glory\r\n    of the Empire.\r\n\r\nMen so diverse in character as George Selwyn and the young reformer,\r\nWilberforce, were loud in praise of the speech. The latter, though\r\nhe regretfully voted against Pitt, declared him to be “a ready-made\r\norator”; while the old place-hunter and _roué_ found in it, “_du sel\r\net du piquant à pleines mains. Charles_ [Fox] _en fut enchanté_.”[102]\r\nHorace Walpole praised the speech in these terms:\r\n\r\n    The young William Pitt has again displayed paternal oratory. The\r\n    other day, on the commission of accounts, he answered Lord North,\r\n    and tore him limb from limb. If Charles Fox could feel, one should\r\n    think such a rival, with an unspotted character, would rouse him.\r\n    What if a Pitt and Fox should again be rivals.... As young Pitt is\r\n    modest too, one would hope some genuine English may revive.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, not a single vote was gained by this oration, for\r\nthe division list showed ninety-eight against Barré’s motion and only\r\nforty-two for it. A Scottish member, Ferguson of Pitfour, a faithful\r\nsupporter of Henry Dundas, on one occasion confessed that he had only\r\nonce ventured to vote on his own conviction, and that was the worst\r\nvote he ever gave. Many members, while lacking the courage and wit to\r\nmake the admission, acted with equal fidelity to their own interests;\r\nand hence even the best speeches rarely won over votes. In the present\r\ncase no one answered, and no one could answer, Pitt’s arguments; yet\r\nthey had no effect on the docile flock which trooped into the lobby\r\nat the heels of Lord North. By a majority of forty-three the Commons\r\ndecided that the King should not be requested to show his benevolence\r\nand disinterestedness.\r\n\r\nThe third effort of the young orator had no more effect. It came\r\nabout, apparently without premeditation, in the course of a debate\r\non the motion of Fox for the conclusion of an immediate peace with\r\nour American colonies (12th June). In the first part of his speech\r\nPitt warmly controverted two members who claimed that Chatham had\r\nsympathized with the war; and, in his eagerness to clear his father’s\r\nmemory, he averred that his (Chatham’s) conduct on this subject had\r\nbeen uniform and consistent. After this doubtful assertion he stated\r\nhis own views in a most trenchant style. Falling upon Lord Westcote,\r\nwho had declared the war to be a holy war, he uttered these remarkable\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    I am persuaded, and will affirm, that it is a most accursed,\r\n    wicked, barbarous, cruel, unnatural, unjust, and diabolical war.\r\n    It was conceived in injustice; it was nurtured and brought forth\r\n    in folly;[103] its footsteps are marked with blood, slaughter,\r\n    persecution and devastation; in truth everything which goes to\r\n    constitute moral depravity and human turpitude are to be found\r\n    in it. It is pregnant with misery of every kind. The mischiefs,\r\n    however, recoil on the unhappy people of this country, who are made\r\n    the instruments by which the wicked purposes of its authors are\r\n    effected.\r\n\r\nHe continued in the same vehement strain, and seems to have impressed\r\nthe House less than before, Selwyn giving as his verdict that he was “a\r\npromising young man.” The speech does, indeed, sound somewhat forced;\r\nand its declamation seems too turgid to be effective. On this occasion\r\n“the King’s cause” once more triumphed, by 172 votes to 99.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the middle of July, after the close of the session, Pitt went on the\r\nwestern circuit, but the notices of his speeches are very meagre. The\r\nonly reference that I have found to this episode in his life is in a\r\nletter of 29th August 1781 to his Cambridge friend, Meeke:\r\n\r\n    I have this circuit amassed the immense sum of thirty guineas\r\n    without the least expense either of sense or knowledge.... I\r\n    shall return to town with the fullest intention of devoting\r\n    myself to Westminster Hall and getting as much money as I can,\r\n    notwithstanding such avocations as the House of Commons, and (which\r\n    is a much more dangerous one) Goostree’s itself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nAs a proof that Pitt did not merely play with the legal profession, I\r\nmay quote this sentence from his letter of June 1782 to Meeke:\r\n\r\n    I have for many reasons chosen to be only a friend, without being a\r\n    member, of Shelburne’s Administration, and am at least as likely to\r\n    continue a lawyer as you are to commence one.[104]\r\n\r\nThe second letter belongs to a time when the prospects of advancement\r\nwere unpromising, and when, therefore, Pitt devoted much of his time to\r\nthe select and charming club at Goostree’s. As there is a widespread\r\nimpression that he was a political automaton, who never unbent save\r\nunder the spell of Bacchus, it will be well to turn our attention to\r\nhis social life in London and at Wimbledon. It cannot be said that he\r\never felt the full charm of London--\r\n\r\n  The quick forge and working-house of thought.\r\n\r\nBrought up in the aristocratic seclusion of Hayes and Burton Pynsent,\r\nand in Pretyman’s prim coterie at Cambridge, he had no experience of\r\nthe varied jostling life which the Londoner loves: and nature had\r\nnot dowered him with the adaptability that makes up for the defects\r\nof training. Therefore he ever remained somewhat of a stranger in\r\nLondon. He was at home in Downing Street, and still more so in his\r\nown select club, or at Hayes, Wimbledon, or Holwood; but London never\r\nlaid her spell on him, and his life was the poorer for it. He reminds\r\nus somewhat of that character in Dickens’s “Great Expectations,” who,\r\nthough naive and jovial, when he entered his suburban retreat in\r\nWalworth Road and the mimic castle at the end of the garden, yet always\r\nfixed his features in chilling reserve when he went forth citywards.\r\nSo, too, there were two Pitts, the austere man of affairs, and the\r\nlovable, delightful friend. London alone could have mixed up the two\r\nmen and produced a sociable compound; but this was not to be.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s Inn and the law did little towards unbending him; though the\r\nstory, recounted in the previous chapter, of his intellectual duel with\r\nGibbon at a dinner in Lincoln’s Inn during the Gordon Riots shows that\r\neven then he had the power of keen and witty repartee which gained him\r\nthe victory over an admitted autocrat of the table. Why these gifts did\r\nnot draw him into general society is hard to say. Probably his shyness\r\nand awkwardness, on which Wilberforce lays so much stress, held him\r\naloof.\r\n\r\nCertainly the temptations of the West End had for him only a passing\r\nallurement. He felt no desire, besides having no means, to associate\r\nwith the gambling _cohue_ that played at Brooks’s or Almack’s. His\r\npreference for bright and entertaining talkers naturally linked him\r\nwith those who had sufficient mental resources within themselves to\r\nscorn the usually dull cliques whose interest in life begins and ends\r\nwith card tables. So far as opportunities had offered at Cambridge, he\r\nhad cultivated conversation as a fine art; and now in the West End he\r\nfound several of his University friends who welcomed him to a somewhat\r\nwider circle. It included about twenty-five young men, of whom the\r\nmost noteworthy were Lords Althorpe, Apsley, G. Cavendish, Duncannon,\r\nEuston, Graham, and Lennox; as well as the following who were to\r\nbecome peers: Mr. Pratt (Marquis Camden), St. John (Lord St. John),\r\nBridgeman (Lord Bradford), Morris Robinson (Lord Rokeby), W. Grenville\r\n(Lord Grenville), Pepper Arden (Lord Alvanley), and R. Smith (Lord\r\nCarrington).\r\n\r\nThat was the age when the bestowal of titles was one of the means\r\nof influence used by the Crown for the defence of its prerogatives.\r\nWilberforce late in life remarked that more than half of the Peers\r\nhad received their titles during his lifetime, and certainly, if we\r\nlook at the circle of Pitt’s friends in 1781, we find that only he and\r\nseven others remained commoners. They were Bankes, Edwards (afterwards\r\nSir Gerard Noel), Marsham, T. Steele, General Smith, Wilberforce and\r\nWindham, a friend of somewhat later date.\r\n\r\nThese and a few others, about thirty in all, formed what might be\r\ntermed Pitt’s Club. They met first at a house in Pall Mall, but\r\nafterwards occupied rooms in the premises of a man named Goostree,\r\nwhich later on were used as the Shakespeare Gallery.[105] Opposition to\r\nLord North’s Ministry was one of the shibboleths of this coterie; but\r\nin pre-revolutionary days, when the merely political club was almost\r\nunknown, conviviality held the first place at Goostree’s. One who was\r\nin George Selwyn’s set evidently thought the ideals aimed at in Pitt’s\r\nlittle society too good for London; for he wrote, at the close of 1781:\r\n“Goostree’s is a small society of young men in Opposition, and they\r\nare very nice in their admissions; as they discourage gaming as much\r\nas possible, their club will not do any harm to Brooks’s, and probably\r\nnot subsist a great while.” In February 1782 Selwyn himself refers to\r\nPitt as having formed a “society of young ministers who are to fight\r\nunder his banner ... and they assemble at Goostree’s.” Clearly, then,\r\nthis club was political, at least in part. Pitt spent much of his time\r\nthere, supping at the club every night during the winter of 1780–81;\r\nand there it was that he became intimate with William Wilberforce, the\r\nmost fascinating of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe young and brilliant member for Hull was a living proof of the\r\ntriumph which mind can win over physical disadvantages. In person he\r\nwas slight and bent, and he early suffered from that weakness of the\r\neyes which hampered him through life. Yet, “bodkin” though he was,\r\nhis quickness of mind, the silvery tones of his voice, the wit that\r\nsparkled in his speech, and his uniform geniality and kindliness gained\r\nfor him a continuous round of social triumphs. His singing possessed\r\na natural charm which drew from the Prince of Wales the statement\r\nthat he would come at any time to hear Wilberforce sing. Equally\r\nattractive was his power of mimicking any public character; but what\r\nmost of all endeared him to his friends was the genial raillery of his\r\nconversation, his power of lively repartee, and the chivalry which\r\nshone in all his words and deeds. Mme de Staël afterwards declared\r\nhim to be the best talker among all the Englishmen she had known; and\r\nin that art of the _salons_ the exuberant Genevese was an exacting\r\nconnoisseur. She, however, could not know the warmth of feeling which\r\nanimated that slight frame, or the sensitiveness of conscience which\r\nwas to make him one of the chief uplifting forces of the age. Towards\r\nthe close of his life he expressed regret that in his youth he had made\r\nintellectual conversation his all in all.[106] But regret was surely\r\nneedless, when that gift attracted to him the young statesman whose\r\nlife at some points he helped to inspire and elevate. Both of them,\r\nindeed, were artists in words; and the free play of mind on mind must\r\nhave helped to strengthen those oratorical powers which were to be\r\ndevoted to the service of their country and of mankind.\r\n\r\nFrom the pages of Wilberforce’s diary we catch a glimpse, tantalizingly\r\nbrief, alas, of Pitt as a boon companion, losing among his intimates\r\nthat shyness which outsiders mistook for pride.\r\n\r\n    He was the wittiest man I ever knew, and what was quite peculiar\r\n    to himself, had at all times his wit under entire control. Others\r\n    appeared struck by the unwonted association of brilliant images;\r\n    but every possible combination of ideas seemed always present to\r\n    his mind, and he could at once produce whatever he desired. I was\r\n    one of those who met to spend an evening in memory of Shakespeare\r\n    at the Boar’s Head, East Cheap. Many professed wits were present,\r\n    but Pitt was the most amusing of the party, and the readiest and\r\n    most apt in the required allusions. He entered with the same\r\n    energy into all our different amusements; we played a good deal at\r\n    Goostree’s, and I well remember the intense earnestness that he\r\n    displayed when joining in these games of chance. He perceived their\r\n    increasing fascination, and soon after suddenly abandoned them for\r\n    ever.\r\n\r\nThis passage, together with its context, is interesting in more\r\nways than one. Firstly it shows that the fashionable vice of the age\r\nhad crept into Goostree’s more than was known by outsiders; or else\r\nSelwyn’s reference to the club belonged to a later period, when Pitt’s\r\nresolve to have done with gambling, and the remorse of Wilberforce at\r\nhaving suddenly won a large sum from impecunious friends, had availed\r\nto curb the passion for it in their society. The difference of the\r\ntwo friends in temperament is equally noteworthy. In Wilberforce the\r\nresolve to break away from gambling was the first sign of awakening\r\nof a sensitive conscience, which, though dulled by gaieties, was\r\nthenceforth to assert itself more and more and finally to win over the\r\nwhole of his energies.\r\n\r\nPitt also felt the fascination of play in a manner which shows the\r\neagerness of his animal instincts; but the awakening in his case seems\r\nto have been due to self-respect and also to a keen sense of what\r\nhe owed to the State. How could he, who had early vowed himself to\r\nthe service of his country, dull his powers and tarnish his name by\r\nindulgence in an insidious and enslaving vice? The career of Charles\r\nJames Fox, we may believe, had already been a warning to the young\r\naspirant. In any case, by an exercise of that imperious will, which\r\ncontrolled even his vehement impulses, he crushed at once and for ever\r\nthose entangling desires, and came forth fancy-free from that Circean\r\ndomain, saved by his ennobling resolve to serve England.\r\n\r\nIn another sense--a less important one, it is true--Pitt was the\r\nmost unfortunate man of his age. All his friends agreed that he was\r\na delightful talker and the most charming of companions. But there\r\ntheir information ends. Not one of them had the Boswellian love of\r\ndetail which enables us to peer right into the heart of Johnson, and\r\ndiscern the loves and hates, the prejudices and envyings, the whims\r\nand fancies which swayed it. A man can never be known unless we have,\r\nnot merely his great speeches, but also his small talk. That of Pitt\r\nmust have been of singular charm, not only from the richness of his\r\nmental gifts, but also from the width of the culture which informed\r\nthem. In learning he equalled the best of his compeers at Cambridge;\r\nand we may imagine that his vivid knowledge of the life of Greece and\r\nRome lent to his comparisons and references a grace which could be\r\nappreciated by few _raconteurs_ of to-day. I have already referred to\r\nthe stories circulated by those who set themselves to talk and write\r\nhim down to their own level, that he studied the classics merely in\r\norder to provide elegant tags to his speeches. The theme has been\r\nembroidered by certain admirers of Fox, who picture the Whig statesman\r\nas the disinterested lover of Greece and Rome, and Pitt as a kind of\r\nmoney-grubbing paramour. If these persons, instead of copying from the\r\nmany malicious stories of that time, would investigate for themselves,\r\nthey would see through the partisan spitefulness of all such tales.\r\nFortunately, Pitt’s copies of the classics preserved at Orwell Park\r\nreveal signs, not only of his frequent perusal of them, but of the\r\npleasure which it brought, as evinced by marginal comments. Away, then,\r\nwith the Foxite myth of the classical tags!\r\n\r\nThe passage from Wilberforce’s Diary cited above also shows Pitt\r\nto have been well primed with Shakespearean lore, and to have had\r\nthe mental agility and tact which could cull the right flower from\r\nthat rich garner. Ill though we could spare any of Pitt’s oratorical\r\nefforts, I doubt whether we would not give up any one of his speeches\r\nif we could have in return a full record of some of the evenings spent\r\nby him and his friends at Goostree’s or the Boar’s Head.\r\n\r\nConcerning his ordinary talk we only know that he delighted his family\r\nby his gaiety, even amidst the heaviest cares of state. In that\r\nterrible year 1793, when England and France had closed in the death\r\ngrapple, Lady Chatham refers to his “ease and gay spirits”; and she\r\nspeaks of him as not looking like a man on whom rested the destinies\r\nof kingdoms. A further sentence explains the source of this buoyancy\r\nof spirits: “The uprightness of his intentions and the strength of\r\nhis mind saved him from feeling any oppression from the weight upon\r\nhim.”[107]\r\n\r\nHere we see the secret of that cheerfulness which charmed his friends.\r\nHis high spirits were in part, no doubt, bequeathed to him by the\r\never confident Chatham; but their even flow was also the outcome of\r\nhis own conscious rectitude. Hence also there came the brightness and\r\nsincerity which shone in Pitt’s conversation as also in his life.\r\nAnother characteristic on which Wilberforce insisted was his strict\r\ntruthfulness, which his friend attributed to his self-respect and to\r\nthe moral purity of his nature. Yet there was no taint of priggishness\r\nabout it. Wilberforce describes him as “remarkably cheerful and\r\npleasant, full of wit and playfulness, neither, like Mr. Fox, fond of\r\narguing a question, nor yet holding forth like some others [Windham is\r\nhere hinted at]. He was always ready to hear others as well as to talk\r\nhimself.”[108]\r\n\r\nObviously, then, Pitt’s conversation was free from some of the defects\r\nwhich mar the efforts of professional talkers. He never used the\r\nsledge-hammer methods by which Dr. Johnson too often won an unfair\r\nadvantage; he scorned to make use of feigned incidents or grossly\r\nexaggerated accounts whereby many small wits gain a passing repute.\r\nHis speech, in private as in public, seems to have resembled a limpid\r\nstream, the natural overflow of a mind richly stocked and a nature at\r\nonce lively and affectionate.\r\n\r\nSometimes the stream raced and danced along, as appears from an entry\r\nin the diary of George Selwyn, in March 1782:\r\n\r\n    When I left the House, I left in one room a party of young men,\r\n    who made me, from their life and spirits, wish for one night to\r\n    be twenty. There was a tablefull of them drinking--young Pitt,\r\n    Lord Euston, Berkley, North, etc., singing and laughing _à gorge\r\n    déployée_: some of them sang very good catches; one Wilberforce, a\r\n    M. of P., sang the best.\r\n\r\nThis is only one of many signs that nature had bestowed on Pitt social\r\ngifts and graces which under more favourable conditions would have made\r\nhim the centre of a devoted circle of friends. True, he was too shy and\r\nmodest to figure as a political Dr. Johnson; too natural to pose as\r\ndid the literary lion of Strawberry Hill; too prudent to vie with Fox\r\nas the chief wit and gamester of a great club. But in his own way and\r\nin his own sphere he might have carried on those honourable traditions\r\nwhich have invested the life of St. Stephen’s with literary and social\r\ncharm, had not Chatham’s premature forcing of his powers devitalized\r\nhim before the start of a singularly early and exacting career. Here\r\nwas the ill fortune of Pitt. Like all precocious natures he needed\r\ntimes of rest and recuperation before he reached his prime. He sought\r\nthem in vain either at Hayes, Cambridge, or Westminster. As we shall\r\nsee, the very unusual state of English politics down to 1789 would have\r\nmade the accession of Fox, the unofficial representative of the Prince\r\nof Wales, a public misfortune; and soon afterwards there occurred in\r\nquick succession the disputes with Spain, Russia, and France, which,\r\nafter two false alarms, ended in a tremendous war. In such a period\r\nhow could a delicate man rise to the height of his faculties, either\r\npolitical or social? On both sides of his nature Pitt showed signs of\r\nthe most brilliant promise; but the premature and incessant strain of\r\npublic duty robbed him and his country of the full fruition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE WITH AMERICA\r\n\r\n    Since the accession of our most gracious sovereign to the throne,\r\n    we have seen a system of government, which may well be called a\r\n    reign of experiments.--JUNIUS, Letter to the Duke of Grafton, 8th\r\n    July 1769.\r\n\r\n    James I was contemptible, but he did not lose an America.\r\n    His eldest grandson sold us, his younger lost us--but we\r\n    kept ourselves. Now we have run to meet the ruin--and it is\r\n    coming.--HORACE WALPOLE, 27th November 1781.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year 1781 occurred a series of events which\r\nbrought Pitt for a time into open opposition to the King. As we have\r\nseen, he had not hesitated to invite George III to enter the path of\r\nEconomical Reform which was peculiarly odious to him. But now the\r\ndivergence of their convictions seemed hopeless. For if Pitt inherited\r\nthe firmness of the Pitts and Grenvilles, George III summed up in his\r\nperson the pertinacity characteristic of the Guelfs and the Stuarts.\r\nThe gift of firmness, the blending of which with foresight and\r\nintelligence produces the greatest of characters, was united in George\r\nIII with narrowness of vision, absorption in the claims of self, and a\r\npedantic clinging to the old and traditional. Coming of a tough stock,\r\nand being admittedly slow and backward, he needed an exceptionally good\r\neducation in order to give him width of outlook and some acquaintance\r\nwith the lessons of history. But unfortunately his training was of the\r\nmost superficial character. Lord Waldegrave, his governor, found him\r\nat the age of fourteen “uncommonly full of prejudices, contracted in\r\nthe nursery, and improved by bedchamber women and pages of the back\r\nstairs.”[109] From these cramping influences he was never to shake\r\nhimself free. The death of his father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, in\r\n1751, left him under the influence of his mother, an ambitious and\r\nintriguing woman, who instilled into him the desire to govern as well\r\nas reign. That advice accorded with the leanings of his nature, which,\r\nthough torpid, was yet masterful.\r\n\r\nAs will appear in the sequel, George III possessed characteristics\r\nwhich made him a formidable opponent. His lack of mental endowments\r\nwas partly made up by his insight into character, and still more by\r\nhis determined will. If he was dull, he was dogged--a quality dear to\r\nthe Britons of that age. His private virtues, his homely good sense, a\r\nbearing that was generally genial, and a courage which never quailed,\r\nmade him in many ways a pattern king for a plain people in ordinary\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nUnhappily for him and his people, the times were extraordinary. Like\r\nhis contemporary, Louis XVI of France, he needed an intellectual\r\nequipment wider than that which goes to make a model country squire.\r\nIn a period remarkable beyond all others for the infiltration of new\r\nideas, neither of these unfortunate monarchs had the least skill\r\nin reading the signs of the times. But, while the royal hunter of\r\nVersailles was so conscious of his defects as frequently to lean too\r\nmuch on advisers and therefore waver, his equally Boeotian brother\r\nof Windsor had an absolute belief in his prognostications (save\r\nsometimes on foreign affairs) and scorned to change his mind. This last\r\npeculiarity appears in a letter which he wrote to Pitt on 2nd March\r\n1797. After chiding his Prime Minister for complying too much with the\r\nOpposition, he continues:\r\n\r\n    My nature is quite different. I never assent till I am convinced\r\n    what is proposed is right, and then I keep [_sic_]; then I never\r\n    allow that to be destroyed by afterthoughts, which on all subjects\r\n    tend to weaken, never to strengthen, the original proposal.[110]\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless sound advice, provided that the first decision\r\nemanates from a statesmanlike brain. How ruinous the results can be if\r\nthat resolve be the outcome of a narrow, proud, and self-complacent\r\nunderstanding, the fortunes of the British Empire in the years 1774–83\r\nmay testify. Those who love to dwell on the “might-have-beens” of\r\nhistory, may imagine what would have happened if the mild and wavering\r\nKing of France had ruled Great Britain, and if our pertinacious\r\nsovereign had been in the place of the hapless Bourbon whose\r\nvacillations marred everything in the memorable spring of 1789.\r\n\r\nIn certain matters George III showed great ability. If he was not a\r\nstatesman, he was a skilled intriguer. Shelburne, himself no tyro\r\nin that art, rated the King’s powers high, stating that “by the\r\nfamiliarity of his intercourse he obtained your confidence, procured\r\nfrom you your opinion of different public characters, and then availed\r\nhimself of this knowledge to sow dissension.”[111] Further, the\r\nskill and pertinacity with which he pulled the wires at elections is\r\nastonishing. No British monarch has equalled him in his knowledge of\r\nthe means by which classes and individuals could be “got at.” Some of\r\nhis letters on these subjects, especially that on the need of making\r\nup for the “bad votes” cast for Fox in the famous Westminster Election\r\nof 1784, tempt one to think that George III missed his vocation, which\r\nshould have been that of electioneering agent of the Tory party.\r\nIn truth he almost succeeded in making Windsor and St. James’s the\r\nheadquarters of that faction.[112]\r\n\r\nDespite his private virtues, he rarely attached men to him by the ties\r\nof affection and devotion--the mark of a narrow and selfish nature.\r\nHis relations to his sons were of the coolest; and all his Ministers,\r\nexcept, perhaps, Addington, left him on terms that bordered on dislike\r\nif not hostility. The signs of the royal displeasure (as Junius justly\r\nobserved to the Duke of Grafton) were generally in proportion to the\r\nabilities and integrity of the Minister. This singular conduct may be\r\nreferred to the profound egotism of the King which led him to view\r\npolitics solely from his own standpoint, to treat government as the\r\nart of manipulating men by means of titles, places, and money,[113]\r\nand to regard his Ministers as confidential clerks, trustworthy only\r\nwhen they distrusted one another. The union of the Machiavellian\r\ntraits with signal virtue and piety in private life is a riddle that\r\ncan be explained only by his narrow outlook, which regarded all means\r\nas justifiable for the “right cause,” and believed all opponents to\r\nbe wicked or contemptible. In fact, the narrowing lens of his vision\r\nalike stunted and distorted all opponents until they appeared an\r\nindistinguishable mass. A curious instance of facility in jumbling\r\ntogether even irreconcilable opposites appeared in his remark to Lord\r\nMalmesbury in 1793 that the _Illuminés_ (the Jacobins of Germany) “were\r\na sect invented by the Jesuits to overthrow all governments and all\r\norder.”[114] Such was the mental equipment of the monarch on whom now\r\nrested the fate of the Empire.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 25th November 1781, news arrived in London which sealed\r\nthe doom of Lord North’s Ministry. Cornwallis, with rather less\r\nthan seven thousand men, had surrendered to the Franco-American\r\nforces at Yorktown. The blow was not heavy enough to daunt a really\r\nunited kingdom. On the Britain of that year, weary of the struggle,\r\nand doubtful alike of its justice and its utility, the effect was\r\ndecisive. Lord North, on hearing the news from his colleague, Lord\r\nGeorge Germain, received it “as he would have taken a bullet through\r\nhis breast.” He threw up his arms and paced up and down the room,\r\nexclaimed wildly: “Oh, God! it is all over.” This, if we may believe\r\nWraxall,[115] was the ejaculation of the man who latterly had been\r\nthe unwilling tool of his sovereign in the coercion of the American\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nWhile Lord North, the Parliament, and the nation were desirous of\r\nending the war, the King still held to his oft expressed opinion,\r\nthat it would be total ruin for Great Britain to give way in the\r\nstruggle, seeing that a great Power which begins to “moulder” must be\r\nannihilated.[116] He therefore kept North to his post, and allowed the\r\nKing’s speech for the forthcoming autumn session to be only slightly\r\naltered; the crucial sentence ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    No endeavours have been wanting on my part to extinguish that\r\n    spirit of rebellion which our enemies have found means to foment\r\n    and maintain in the colonies, & to restore to my deluded subjects\r\n    in America that happy and prosperous condition which they\r\n    formerly derived from a due obedience to the laws; but the late\r\n    misfortune in that quarter calls loudly for your firm concurrence\r\n    and assistance to frustrate the designs of our enemies, equally\r\n    prejudicial to the real interests of America and to those of Great\r\n    Britain.\r\n\r\nThe gauntlet thus defiantly flung down was taken up with spirit by Fox\r\nand Burke, who even ventured to threaten with impeachment the Secretary\r\nfor the Colonies, Germain, and the First Lord of the Admiralty, the\r\nEarl of Sandwich. This was unfair. They were little more than puppets\r\nmoved by the King; and he was responsible ultimately for the bad\r\ncondition of the army and navy, and was sole cause for the continuance\r\nof the war. No one imagined (so Romilly wrote on 4th December 1781)\r\nthat the war would go on after the disaster at Yorktown.[117]\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing debates on the King’s speech, Pitt made an effective\r\nattack on Ministers, upbraiding them with the inconsistency of their\r\nstatements and the obscurity in which they shrouded their plans. For\r\nhimself, with his profound conviction as to the need of promptly\r\nterminating the war, he adjured them to state clearly what line of\r\nconduct they meant to pursue. This last challenge went home because\r\nthe language of Ministers was openly inconsistent, that of the Lord\r\nAdvocate, Dundas, being hardly different from the views held by the\r\nOpposition. In fact it was now said that there were three parties on\r\nthe Government benches--the King’s, Lord North’s, and that of Dundas,\r\nshading off from war _à outrance_ to something like conciliation with\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the House (as Fox wrote in his Journal) was “tenacious\r\nof places and pensions,” and at first supported the Government by\r\nsubstantial majorities; but a typical placeman like Selwyn wrote early\r\nin December that if the measures and conduct of the Ministry were not\r\nchanged, they were completely undone. Nervousness about his sinecure\r\nmade the wit a true prophet. Not only was the majority breaking into\r\ngroups, but the Opposition was acting well together. This again was a\r\nresult of the Yorktown disaster. Only a few days previously, Shelburne,\r\nthe leader of the Chathamites, had in vain proposed to the official\r\nchief of the Whigs, Rockingham, that they should unite their followers,\r\nso that there should be but two parties, “that of the Crown and that of\r\nthe people.”\r\n\r\nNow, however, as victory came in sight, the Opposition closed its\r\nranks, while the once serried phalanx of placemen opposite began to\r\nsplit up from sheer panic. During this interesting time Pitt made\r\nanother speech, which won high encomiums from Horace Walpole for its\r\n“amazing logical abilities.” Equally notable was the alertness which\r\nfastened on a slight incident. In the midst of his tirade against the\r\ninconsistencies of Ministers, North and Germain began to whisper\r\ntogether, while that wary little placeman, Welbore Ellis, who was\r\nbetween them, bent down his head to listen. At once Pitt exclaimed: “I\r\nwill wait until the unanimity is a little better restored. I will wait\r\nuntil the Nestor of the Treasury has reconciled the difference between\r\nthe Agamemnon and the Achilles of the American War.”[118]\r\n\r\nLittle by little Lord North’s majority dwindled away. It sank to a\r\nsingle vote on 22nd February 1782, when General Conway brought forward\r\na motion for the termination of the war. On the renewal of the motion\r\nfive days later, the House, amidst a scene of great excitement,\r\ndeclared against North by 234 votes to 215. The Ministry, under\r\npressure from the King, held on for a few days, and, on 8th March, even\r\ndefeated a vote of censure by a majority of ten.\r\n\r\nPitt, who was one of the tellers for the minority, had startled\r\nthe House, in the course of a fighting speech, by the following\r\nnotable words: “For myself, I could not expect to form part of a new\r\nadministration; but, were my doing so more within my reach, I would\r\nnever accept a subordinate situation.” On the authority of Admiral\r\nKeppel, his neighbour in the House, he is said to have repented\r\nimmediately of this declaration, and to have wished to rise and\r\nexplain or mitigate it. If so, the feeling must surely have been only\r\nmomentary. Pitt, as we have seen, was essentially methodical. His\r\nfeelings, his words, even his lightest jests, were always completely\r\nunder control. It is therefore impossible to regard so important a\r\nstatement as due to the whim of the moment, or to the exaggeration\r\nof which a nervous or unskilful speaker is often guilty. Still less\r\ncan we believe that he seriously intended to explain away his words.\r\nSo weak an action would have been wholly repugnant to another of his\r\ncharacteristics--pride. The declaration was probably the outcome of\r\nhis unwavering self-confidence and of a belief that any Ministry which\r\ncould be formed must be short lived.\r\n\r\nIf so, his conduct was well suited to bring him to the front at a time\r\nmore opportune than the present. It was inconceivable that a monarch so\r\nmasterful and skilled in intrigue as George III should long submit to\r\nbe controlled by the now victorious Whig families, whose overthrow had\r\nbeen his chief aim. To foment the schisms in their ranks, and shelve\r\nthem at the first possible time was an alternative far preferable to\r\nthat of retiring to Hanover--a suggestion which he once more threw out\r\nto Lord North. When the struggle between Crown and Commons had come to\r\nits second phase, it would be time for a young member to take a leading\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA crisis became imminent forthwith, on the House passing a declaration\r\nthat it would “consider as enemies to His Majesty and to this country\r\nall who should advise or by any means attempt the further prosecution\r\nof offensive war on the continent of America.” By this Act the Commons\r\nreasserted their undoubted right of controlling the prerogative of the\r\nCrown even in the question of peace or war.[119] The declaration was a\r\npreliminary to impeachment of Ministers in case they still persisted in\r\ndefying the House.\r\n\r\nIt also led the King, on 11th March, to send his champion, the\r\nChancellor, Lord Thurlow, to consult with Lord Rockingham. The leader\r\nof the official Whigs knew that he had the game in his hands, and\r\nsought to dictate the conditions on which alone he would form an\r\nadministration. They were as follows: “American Independence; no Veto;\r\nEstablishment Bill; great parts of Contractors Bill; Custom House and\r\nExcise, etc., Bill; Peace in general, if possible; Economy in every\r\nbranch.”[120] The King demurred to these terms, and after eight days\r\nthe overture lapsed. Meanwhile Lord North’s position in the House was\r\nbecoming intolerable, and on 20th March he announced the resignation of\r\nhis Ministry. On going to take leave of the King, he was greeted by the\r\nfollowing characteristic words: “Remember, my Lord, that it is you who\r\ndesert me, not I you.”\r\n\r\nMost sovereigns would now have accepted defeat. But George III was\r\nno less dogged of will than ingenious in finding a way of escape. He\r\nhad one chance left. Beside the official Whig families, headed by\r\nRockingham, there were the Chathamites, led by Shelburne, who occupied\r\nan intermediate position not easy to define. Like most political\r\ngroups which profess to be above party, they had succeeded in forming\r\nanother party. They differed from the Whigs in not desiring to see the\r\nroyal prerogative shorn of power, as it had been under the first two\r\nGeorges to the advantage of the old governing families. In foreign\r\nand colonial affairs they aimed at the triumph of a truly national\r\npolicy, which, while furthering the cause of freedom, also made for\r\nthe greatness of the Empire. Even amidst his protests against the\r\ncontinuance of the war, Shelburne raised his voice, as Chatham had\r\ndone, against a complete severance of the tie uniting the colonies to\r\nthe motherland.[121] These opinions seem to us now unpractical in view\r\nof the existing state of things. Certainly, if we may judge by the\r\nspeeches of William Pitt, he had overshot the limits of the Chathamite\r\ntraditions which his chief still observed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Chathamites, albeit a somewhat _doctrinaire_\r\ngroup, indeed scarcely a party, might now be utilized as a buffer\r\nbetween the throne and the Whig magnates. Accordingly, the King,\r\nduring an interview with Shelburne, in which he expressed his dislike\r\nof Rockingham, proposed that Shelburne should form a Cabinet with\r\nRockingham as head, Shelburne being the intermediary between the\r\nKing and the Prime Minister. As Shelburne knew that he could not\r\nstand without the support of the Whigs, the latter had their way at\r\nnearly all points. The King most reluctantly consented not to veto\r\nAmerican Independence--a matter on which Rockingham stood firm. In\r\nsmaller and personal matters, on which George III set much store, he\r\npartly succeeded. He refused to see Rockingham until the latter was\r\nPrime Minister; he insisted on keeping his factotum, Lord Thurlow,\r\nas Chancellor, and he fought hard to keep the gentlemen of the royal\r\nhousehold unchanged; but, as he wrote to Lord North, “the number I have\r\nsaved is incredibly few.” Among them was Lord Montagu, the governor\r\nof the King’s son, whom Horace Walpole dubbed the King’s spy on the\r\nPrince of Wales, and the only man in whom he (George III) had any\r\nconfidence. The same sharp critic noted that the King now used, with\r\nsome success, the only artifice in which he had ever succeeded, that\r\nof sowing discord. He had openly shown that Shelburne and Thurlow were\r\nhis men in the Cabinet; and Fox, who became Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs, said that the new Cabinet belonged partly to the King\r\nand partly to the people. In the very limited sense in which the Whigs\r\nwere a popular party (for the official Whigs sought the support of the\r\npeople mainly in order to browbeat the King), the remark was correct.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the King had certainly contrived largely to\r\nnullify the victory of the Whigs by fomenting discords in the Cabinet.\r\nSo astute an intriguer as Shelburne was certain to chafe at the\r\nascendancy of Rockingham; and the King’s tactics, while humiliating the\r\nPrime Minister, enabled Shelburne secretly to arrange matters according\r\nto the royal behests. Shelburne held the secretaryship for Home\r\nAffairs, which then carried with it a supervision of the executive at\r\nDublin Castle. He also brought in Dunning (now created Lord Ashburton\r\nwithout the knowledge of Rockingham) as Chancellor of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster; and it has been ascertained that he sought to include Pitt\r\nin the Cabinet with some high office. Which office he was to have is\r\nnot clear; but Lady Chatham wrote to Shelburne on 28th March in terms\r\nwhich implied an office of Cabinet rank. Here, however, Rockingham\r\nprotested with success; and as a result only the Vice-Treasurership of\r\nIreland was offered him, an office which by his previous declaration he\r\nhad bound himself to refuse.[122] His exclusion from the Cabinet by the\r\ninfluence of the official Whigs served to alienate him from that party,\r\nand brought him more in contact with men who were beginning to figure\r\nas supporters of the royal prerogative.\r\n\r\nAs a private member, Pitt gave his support to the new Ministry; and\r\non 29th April he made a brief but telling appeal for unanimity,\r\n“from which the salvation of the nation could alone be hoped for.”\r\nCertainly the Ministry needed the help of all patriots. The prestige\r\nof Britain was at the lowest ebb. Beaten alike in the New World and\r\nin the Mediterranean, where Minorca had recently been recovered by\r\nthe Spaniards, she seemed at the end of her resources. Ireland was\r\nin a state of veiled rebellion. The Parliament at Dublin unanimously\r\ndemanded the repeal of Poynings Act and that of the year 1720, which\r\nassured its dependence on the British Government; and some 100,000\r\nVolunteers were ready to take the field to make good the claim. In\r\nvain did the new Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Portland, seek to gain\r\ntime. Grattan, whom the Earl of Mornington styled “the most upright\r\nand temperate demagogue that ever appeared in any country,” had\r\nIreland at his back. He refused to wait; and in the month of May the\r\nBritish Parliament gave effect to his demands by unanimously conceding\r\nlegislative independence to the Dublin Parliament.[123] Pitt did not\r\nspeak on the subject, but he probably agreed with the change, which in\r\nthe circumstances was inevitable. The news aroused in Ireland a storm\r\nof enthusiasm, and the Dublin Parliament voted the sum of £100,000 for\r\nraising 20,000 seamen. For the present, then, the Irish question was\r\nshelved, but at the cost of many difficulties in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the cloud which had hung so ominously over\r\nBritain’s navy cleared away. News arrived of the victory which Rodney\r\ngained over the French fleet under Count de Grasse near Dominica\r\non 12th April 1782,[124] which saved the West Indian colonies and\r\nrestored Britain’s supremacy on the ocean. Equally fortunate was\r\nEliott’s repulse of a determined attack on Gibraltar by the French and\r\nSpaniards, which brought about the relief of the garrison and ensured\r\nthe total failure of the prolonged and desperate efforts of France and\r\nSpain to seize the key of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the nation rose with these successes; and Shelburne\r\nbrought forward a Bill for arming the people. The motion came to\r\nlittle, probably because of the fear which the Lord George Gordon riots\r\nhad aroused;[125] but, as the sequel will show, it took effect in some\r\nquarters and provided the basis for the far more important Volunteer\r\nMovement of the Great French War.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, as showing the strong bent of Pitt’s nature towards\r\ncivil affairs, that he spoke, not on these topics, but solely on the\r\ncause of Parliamentary Reform. His insistence on this topic at a time\r\nof national peril can be paralleled by the action of another statesman\r\na century later; and it is significant that, when Mr. Gladstone\r\nintroduced his Franchise Bill in 1884, he was warmly reproached by\r\nLord Randolph Churchill for bringing forward this topic amidst the\r\nconflicts or complications in which we were involved in Egypt, the\r\nSudan, Afghanistan, and South Africa. But the Liberal leader claimed\r\nthat by conferring the franchise on some two million of citizens, the\r\npeople would be arrayed “in one solid compacted mass around the ancient\r\nthrone which it has loved so well and round a constitution now to be\r\nmore than ever powerful and more than ever free.” The plea has been\r\njustified by events; and we can now gauge at its true value the politic\r\ndaring of the two statesmen who sought to meet dangers from without by\r\nstrengthening the fabric of the Empire at its base.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1782 the gravity of the crisis was far greater than that of\r\nthe year 1884; for the storms were beating on an edifice dangerously\r\nnarrow at the ground. Realizing that the subject of the representation\r\nwas too complicated to be handled except after an official\r\ninvestigation, Pitt for the present proposed merely the formation of a\r\nCommittee of Inquiry which should report on the best means of carrying\r\nout “a moderate and substantial reform.” His proposals, and still more\r\nthe fame of his eloquence, aroused great interest; so that on the\r\nmorning of 7th May a crowd endeavoured to gain access to Westminster\r\nHall. Many of the “news-writers” were excluded, with results harmful to\r\nthe printed reports of the speech.[126] Pitt prefaced his remarks by\r\nacknowledging most thankfully that they had now to do with a Ministry\r\nwhich desired such a measure, and not with one that “laboured to\r\nexert the corrupt influence of the Crown in support of an inadequate\r\nrepresentation of the people.” He assumed it as proven that the House\r\nof Commons had received an improper and dangerous bias, which impaired\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\n    That beautiful frame of government which has made us the envy and\r\n    admiration of mankind, in which the people are entitled to hold so\r\n    distinguished a share, is so far dwindled, and has so far departed\r\n    from its original purity, as that the representatives have ceased,\r\n    in a great degree, to be connected with the people. It is of the\r\n    essence of the constitution that the people should have a share in\r\n    the government by the means of representation; and its excellence\r\n    and permanency is calculated to consist in this representation,\r\n    having been designed to be equal, easy, practicable, and complete.\r\n    When it ceases to be so; when the representative ceases to have\r\n    connection with the constituent, and is either dependent on\r\n    the Crown or the aristocracy, there is a defect in the frame\r\n    of representation, and it is not innovation but recovery of\r\n    constitution, to repair it.\r\n\r\nHe then pointed out some of the worst anomalies of the existing system.\r\nThere were some boroughs wholly controlled, or absolutely possessed,\r\nby the Treasury. In others its influence was contested solely by a\r\ngreat landowner, but never by the inhabitants in their own right. Some\r\nfew boroughs [Old Sarum is the classical instance] had only one or two\r\nvoters. Other towns,\r\n\r\n    in the lofty possession of English freedom, claim to themselves\r\n    the right to bring their votes to market. They have no other\r\n    market, no other property, and no other stake in the country, than\r\n    the property and price which they procure for their votes. Such\r\n    boroughs are the most dangerous of all. So far from consulting the\r\n    interests of their country in the choice which they make, they hold\r\n    out their borough to the best purchaser.... It is a fact pretty\r\n    well known that the Nabob of Arcot had no less than seven or eight\r\n    members in that House. May not a foreign State in enmity with this\r\n    country, by means of these boroughs, procure a party of men to act\r\n    for them under the mask and character of members of that House?\r\n\r\nPitt then warned the Commons that the forces of corruption might\r\nsoon be found to be as strong as ever. Though they had grown with\r\nour growth, they had not decayed with our decay. For years they had\r\nmaintained in power a Ministry which had worked ruin to the Empire.\r\nFinally, he referred to the opinion of his father on this great subject\r\nand besought members to satisfy the longings now widely expressed\r\nthroughout the kingdom, which must carry the matter to a triumphant\r\nissue. His speech was loudly cheered. The able orations of Fox and\r\nSheridan also seemed to carry the House with them; but, as in former\r\ncases, the undercurrent of self-interest worked potently against\r\nReform, and ensured the rejection of Pitt’s proposal by 161 votes to\r\n141. The country gentlemen were alarmed at his motion, the opposition\r\nof Pitt’s relative, Thomas Pitt, being especially strong.\r\n\r\nProbably it was a tactical mistake for Pitt, a private member, to bring\r\nforward such a motion. If he had waited until the Ministry had so far\r\nprevailed over its external difficulties and internal dissensions as\r\nto be able to take up the question, his support might have ensured the\r\ntriumph of the Government proposals. As it was, the misgivings of the\r\ncautious, the vested interests of nominee members, the embarrassments\r\nof the Ministry, and the opposition of the old Whig families, doomed\r\nto failure his second effort in this direction. Not for the space of\r\nforty-eight years was so favourable an opportunity to recur; and then\r\nit was a new Industrial England which burst through the trammels of an\r\nold-world representation.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by this rebuff, he spoke on 17th May in favour of the motion\r\nof a veteran reformer, Alderman Sawbridge, for shortening the duration\r\nof Parliaments. Only one of his arguments has come down to us, namely\r\nhis contention that the Septennial Act placed undue influence in the\r\nhands of Ministers, as appeared from the strenuous opposition which the\r\nenemies of political purity had always offered to the repeal of that\r\nmeasure. Fox spoke for the motion; but Burke, who had been persuaded\r\nto absent himself from the earlier debate, now let loose the vials of\r\nhis wrath against a Reform of Parliament in whatever shape it came.\r\nSheridan describes him as attacking Pitt “in a scream of passion,” with\r\nthe assertion that Parliament was just what it ought to be, and that\r\nall change would be fatal to the welfare of the nation.\r\n\r\nBurke’s diatribe prepares us for the part which he played during the\r\nFrench Revolution. The man who discerned perfection in a Parliamentary\r\nsystem, in which Scotland had only 4,000 voters and 45 members,\r\nwhile 19 Cornish villages returned 38 members; in which the Duke of\r\nNorfolk could put in 11 members, and the Nabob of Arcot 7 or 8, while\r\nManchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham remained politically\r\ndumb--such a man might well regard the French revolutionists as “the\r\nablest architects of ruin” that the world had ever seen. His tirade\r\nagainst short Parliaments carried the House with him, the motion being\r\nrejected by a majority of 88.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find Pitt taking part at a meeting of friends\r\nof Reform at the Thatched House Tavern (18th May 1782), which seems\r\nto have been held under the auspices of Major Cartwright’s “Society\r\nfor Promoting Constitutional Information.” The Duke of Richmond, Lord\r\nMahon, Sir Cecil Wray, and the Lord Mayor were present. A motion was\r\npassed urging the need of petitioning Parliament for “a substantial\r\nreformation of the Commons House of Parliament”; and the minutes of\r\nthe meeting were in Pitt’s handwriting. He was then in correspondence\r\nwith John Frost, an attorney of Percy Street, who was secretary for\r\nthe Middlesex Reform Committee; and in the second letter the young\r\nstatesman refers to some honour which that committee proposed to confer\r\non him for his efforts on their behalf. These facts and Pitt’s letters\r\nto Frost were produced by Erskine during his defence of Frost against\r\na charge of sedition early in the Hilary Term 1793.[127] The episode\r\nwas highly effective and probably ensured the mitigation of Frost’s\r\nsentence. The whole incident is noteworthy, as it points the contrast\r\nbetween the earlier and later phases of Pitt’s career which was to be\r\nproduced by the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nPitt did not speak during the debates on two other measures which alone\r\nof all the reformers’ programme passed through Parliament in 1782.\r\nThey were the Contractors Bill, which, by excluding all contractors\r\nfrom Parliament and disfranchising all revenue officers, dealt a blow\r\nat some forms of political corruption.[128] By the other Act several\r\nsinecures, with salaries of about £70,000 a year, were swept away.\r\nThe King exerted his influence against both measures, his man, Lord\r\nThurlow, striving by every means to defeat the former of them in the\r\nLords; while the Economy Bill was shorn of some of its more drastic\r\nclauses by the action of Shelburne and Thurlow in Cabinet Councils.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of common action was seen during the discussion of a\r\nBill for the repression of bribery at elections (19th June). Pitt spoke\r\nin favour of the motion, but, strange to say, Fox opposed it. This was\r\nthe first occasion on which they voted in opposite lobbies, though\r\nthere had been no friendship or close intercourse between them. The\r\nmotion was of course lost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir relations were destined quickly to alter, owing to an event\r\nwhich opened another phase of the long struggle between the King and\r\nthe hostile Whig “phalanx.” On 1st July 1782 the Marquis of Rockingham\r\ndied. Of small ability, he yet held a conspicuous place in the\r\naffairs of State, owing to his vast landed estates, the strength of\r\nhis political and family connections, and to his high character. At\r\nonce the King and the “phalanx” girded themselves for the conflict.\r\nOn the very next day George III offered the Premiership to the Earl\r\nof Shelburne, now more than ever inclining to the King’s side. With\r\nan openness which did not always characterize him, that Minister\r\nat once referred the proposal to his colleagues, only to have it\r\nrejected by the official Whigs. Four of Rockingham’s most decided\r\nfriends in the Cabinet--Fox, the Duke of Richmond, Lord John Cavendish,\r\nand Admiral Keppel--demanded that the Duke of Portland should be\r\nPrime Minister.[129] Such a proposal was doubly objectionable;\r\nfirst, because the Duke, as then appeared from his conduct at Dublin\r\nCastle, had little insight and no strength of character; secondly,\r\nbecause the proposal itself was scarcely constitutional; for the\r\nKing had, as he still has, the right to select his Prime Minister.\r\nNevertheless, Shelburne consented to refer the proposal to George III,\r\nwho emphatically rejected it. Thereupon Fox and Lord John Cavendish\r\nresigned; Shelburne undertook to form an Administration and offered the\r\nChancellorship of the Exchequer, vacated by Lord John Cavendish, to\r\nWilliam Pitt. He at once accepted it.\r\n\r\nThe other chief changes were that Thomas Townshend (soon to become Lord\r\nSydney) took the Secretaryship of State held by Shelburne, while Fox\r\nwas succeeded as Secretary for Foreign Affairs by Lord Grantham, and\r\nthe Duke of Portland, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, by Earl Temple. Burke\r\nand Sheridan marked their attachment to the Whigs by resigning their\r\nsubordinate offices. It was in face of able, eloquent, and exasperated\r\nmen like these that Pitt took up the burden of office, along with the\r\nvirtual leadership of the House of Commons, at the age of twenty-three.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Fox and his friends in resigning office was hotly\r\narraigned. A debate on their action in voting a pension of £3,200 a\r\nyear to Colonel Barré turned mainly on the larger question (9th July).\r\nFox, conscious that Barré’s pension was a blot on Ministers who had\r\nposed as champions of economy, retorted fiercely on his critics,\r\ndeclaring Shelburne and his followers to be heedless alike “of promises\r\nwhich they had made, of engagements into which they had entered, of\r\nprinciples which they had maintained, of the system on which they had\r\nset out.... They would abandon fifty principles for the sake of power,\r\nand forget fifty promises when they were no longer requisite to their\r\nends; ... and he expected to see that, in a very short time, they would\r\nbe joined by those men whom that House had precipitated from their\r\nseats.”[130]\r\n\r\nHad Fox been satisfied with defending his own resignation on the ground\r\nof disagreement with Shelburne on details of policy, his relations to\r\nthe Chathamites might have remained cordial. But the attack on Pitt’s\r\nchief was so violent as to provoke sharp rejoinders. General Conway\r\ndefended Shelburne from the charge of apostasy, and stated that it\r\nwas he who had convinced George III of the need of recognizing the\r\nindependence of the American colonies; also that the differences\r\nbetween Shelburne and Fox on that point were merely differing shades of\r\nopinion.[131] Pitt expressed his regret at the resignation of Fox, but\r\nattributed it in the main to a dislike of Shelburne rather than of his\r\npolicy. For himself, he said, he completely trusted the noble earl, and\r\nif he were called upon to serve under him (his appointment was not yet\r\nconfirmed) he would do so cheerfully in any capacity and to the utmost\r\nof his power. The strictures of Fox were further discounted by the fact\r\nthat Richmond and Keppel did not resign their seats in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the action of Fox after this lapse of time it seems\r\nimpossible to acquit him of the charge of acting with haste and bad\r\ntemper. His charges against the sincerity of Shelburne respecting the\r\ndetails of the negotiation then begun with France and America have been\r\nrefuted, or at least minimized, by an eminent authority.[132] Fox must\r\nhave known as well as Conway that Shelburne had induced George III\r\nto recognize the independence of the American colonies--a political\r\nservice of the highest order; and if on matters of detail he sharply\r\ndiffered from him, and thought him insincere, meddlesome, and too\r\nfriendly to the King, it was his duty to remain in office with his\r\nWhig friends so as to curb those tendencies. It is by no means certain\r\n(as Mr. Lecky asserted) that he would have been always, or generally,\r\noutvoted;[133] and his presence in the Cabinet would have strengthened\r\nhis party in the Commons. It may be granted that he believed he was\r\ntaking the only straightforward course; but his vehement nature\r\noften led him to unwise conclusions. True, his colleagues nearly\r\nalways forgave him; for it was a signal proof of the warmth of his\r\ndisposition that his friends loved him even when he offended them; but\r\nthey came by degrees to distrust his judgement, and to see that other\r\ngifts than courage, eloquence, and personal charm were needed in a\r\nleader. Certain it is that public opinion condemned his resignation as\r\nhasty, ill-timed, and compromising to the cause of Reform.\r\n\r\nHis action was especially unfortunate in this last respect. In April he\r\nhad written that, if the Rockingham Cabinet could stay in office long\r\nenough to deal “a good stout blow to the influence of the Crown,” it\r\nwould not matter if the Ministry broke up. But the blow had not been\r\ndealt; the passing of the Economy Bill and the exclusion of contractors\r\nfrom Parliament and revenue officers from the franchise had only\r\nscotched the snake of corruption, not killed it. Yet the party which\r\nalone could deal the final blow was now weakened by the action of the\r\nmost ardent of reformers. The worst result of all, perhaps, remains to\r\nbe noticed. When Fox maliciously taunted Shelburne with being about to\r\nunite with Lord North in order to keep in office, no one could have\r\nimagined that the speaker would soon have recourse to that despicable\r\nmanœuvre; but the curse, flung out in heedless wrath, was destined to\r\ncome home to roost.\r\n\r\nPitt now came to office by a path which necessitated a sharp divergence\r\nfrom Fox--a divergence, be it noted, due to party tactics and not\r\nto the inner convictions of the men themselves. After the foregoing\r\naccount of the session of 1782--it ended on 11th July--the reader will\r\nbe in a position to judge for himself whether up to that time Pitt or\r\nFox was to blame for a split which seems unnatural and blameworthy.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August Pitt moved into the “vast awkward house” in\r\nDowning Street which was to be his official residence. Dissensions soon\r\narose in the Cabinet; and in addition there were the dangers resulting\r\nfrom the war and the urgent need of concluding peace. Accordingly\r\nPitt was able to spend but very few days out of town at his beloved\r\nHayes, even in the heat of summer, still less to go on circuit as\r\nhe had intended. The Shelburne Ministry contrived to simplify the\r\ndiplomatic situation by offering to recognize the independence of the\r\nUnited States (27th September). The frankness with which this was\r\ndone, at a time when Vergennes, the French Foreign Minister, showed a\r\nkeen desire to shut those growing communities out from the valley of\r\nthe Mississippi,[134] served somewhat to allay the anti-British fury\r\nkindled by the War. The Americans saw, what had long been discerned at\r\nWestminster, that the Bourbons were using them as pawns in their game\r\nfor the overthrow of the British Empire; and their envoys resolved to\r\nbreak loose from their engagement not to treat separately for a peace\r\nwith England. The preliminaries of peace, signed on 30th November,\r\naccorded to the young Commonwealth the Mississippi as its boundary on\r\nthe west, and the larger part of the great lakes on the north, together\r\nwith fishery rights off Newfoundland. All these terms, including that\r\nof the independence of the States, were provisional, taking effect\r\nwhenever peace should be settled with France and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with France and Spain were rendered easier by the\r\nill-will now existing between the Bourbon Powers and the United\r\nStates. The relief of the garrison of Gibraltar by Lord Howe further\r\ndisposed them to abate their terms. On the other hand, they knew of\r\nthe difficulties of the British Cabinet, and the general desire of the\r\nnation for peace. Matters were therefore in a complicated state at the\r\nend of the year 1782; and we learn from a statement of Shelburne that\r\nduring November he refrained from summoning Cabinet Councils in order\r\nto preserve unanimity.[135] Ministers had indeed differed sharply,\r\nfirstly, on the question whether Gibraltar should be handed back to\r\nSpain, and secondly, on that of the indemnity. The King and Shelburne\r\nwished to have Porto Rico and West Florida in exchange for Gibraltar;\r\nGrafton preferred Porto Rico and Trinidad; while Richmond, Keppel\r\n(probably also Pitt) objected to the cession of the great fortress\r\nwhich had been so stoutly held against a three years’ siege.[136]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when, on 5th December, Parliament\r\nreassembled. On the next day Pitt committed a mistake which exposed him\r\nto a reprimand from the King through Shelburne. Fox pressed Ministers\r\nto declare that the acknowledgement of American independence was\r\nunconditional. The senior Minister in the House, Townshend, replied\r\nthat that condition of peace would take effect only on the conclusion\r\nof a general peace. Pitt, however, added that “the clear indisputable\r\nmeaning of the provisional agreements made with the American\r\ncommissioners was the unqualified recognition of their independence”;\r\nand it would form part of the treaty with the belligerent powers.[137]\r\nHere he overshot the mark. That recognition depended on the conclusion\r\nof treaties with France and Spain. The King, therefore, sent him a\r\nrebuke through Shelburne, adding, however, “It is no wonder that so\r\nyoung a man should have made a slip.”--We cannot regret the occurrence,\r\nfor it shows how anxious Pitt was to have that great question settled.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing debates Pitt sharply retorted on Burke, who, quoting\r\nfrom “Hudibras,” had accused Ministers of making the King speak--\r\n\r\n  As if hypocrisy and nonsense\r\n  Had got the advowson of his conscience.\r\n\r\nThe son of Chatham showed something of his father’s fire, reprobating\r\nthe unseemly jeer of the speaker and declaring that he repelled the\r\nfurther charge of hypocrisy “with scorn and contempt.” A retort\r\ncourteous, or humorous, would have been more in place after Burke’s\r\nraillery; but Pitt, though witty in private, rarely used this gift in\r\nthe House, probably because he wished to be taken seriously. In this\r\nhe succeeded. In all but name he was leader of the House of Commons.\r\nThe task of keeping together a majority was extremely difficult; for,\r\naccording to Gibbon, the Ministry could command only 140 votes, while\r\nas many as 120 voted with Lord North, 90 with Fox, the rest drifted\r\nabout as marketable flotsam. The situation became worse still late in\r\nthe year, when rumours began to fly about that Fox and Lord North were\r\nabout to join their discordant forces for the overthrow of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Shelburne Cabinet rendered the greatest\r\npossible service by holding on to office, while they pressed through\r\nthe negotiations with France, Spain, and Holland. Ultimately, the\r\npreliminaries of peace were signed on 20th January 1783. They brought\r\nno disgrace on a Power which had latterly been warring against half\r\nthe world. The chief loss in the West Indies was Tobago, a small but\r\nwealthy island, in which British merchants had large interests. It\r\nwas surrendered to the French, who recovered their former possession,\r\nSt. Lucia. On the other hand, they gave back to Britain Dominica,\r\nGrenada, St. Vincent, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat. The cession of\r\nthe islands of Miquelon and St. Pierre enabled France to gain a firmer\r\nfooting in the Newfoundland fisheries. In Africa we gave back Senegal\r\nand Goree to France; while her stations in India, conquered by us, were\r\nlikewise restored. Spain gained more largely than France. She retained\r\nher recent conquests, West Florida and Minorca, and she acquired East\r\nFlorida, while recognizing the reconquest of the Bahamas by England.\r\nThe Dutch ceded Negapatam but recovered Trincomalee. These conditions\r\nwere ultimately ratified by the Treaty of Versailles (3rd September\r\n1783).\r\n\r\nTerms so favourable could not have been secured had not the Court of\r\nVersailles felt the need of peace in order to repair its shattered\r\nfinances. It was the shadow of the oncoming eclipse of 1789 which\r\nwarned Louis XVI and Vergennes to agree with their adversary while they\r\nwere in the way with him. Nevertheless, the Shelburne Ministry deserves\r\nthe highest credit for making head against internal difficulties, and\r\nfor gaining terms which were far less burdensome than those imposed on\r\nFrance by the Seven Years’ War.\r\n\r\nThis is the light in which they are regarded now. In that age, when the\r\nspoils of office rather than patriotism prompted the words and votes\r\nof members, the details of the peace afforded a welcome opportunity\r\nfor undermining the Ministry. Already it seemed to be in difficulties.\r\nThe waverers inside the Cabinet, or those who were chafed by the\r\noverbearing ways and personal diplomacy of Shelburne, began to leave\r\nthe labouring ship. Keppel threw up the Admiralty, the Duke of Richmond\r\nabsented himself from the Cabinet Councils, and Grafton and Conway\r\nseemed on the point of retiring.[138] Pitt remained faithful, but urged\r\nthe need of strengthening the Ministry by alliance with Fox and his\r\nfollowers. Shelburne at first inclined to a compact with Lord North’s\r\nparty; though both he and Pitt objected strongly to the inclusion of\r\nNorth himself in the Cabinet. As “the lord in the blue ribbon” had his\r\nparty well in hand, it was impossible to bring them in without him. It\r\nremained, then, to seek help from the Foxites. Here the bitter personal\r\nfeud between Shelburne and Fox complicated the situation fatally both\r\nfor Shelburne, Fox, and Pitt. But before the fight began in Parliament\r\non the burning topic of the hour, Pitt made an attempt to bring in Fox\r\n(11th February). He acted with the consent of Shelburne and with the\r\nknowledge, and probably the grudging permission, of the King.\r\n\r\nFew private interviews have been more important. On it depended the\r\nfortunes of the Ministry, and to some extent, of the Empire. If it\r\nsucceeded, the terms of peace were certain to pass through Parliament.\r\nAn alliance would also be formed between two political groups which had\r\nalmost the same aims and were held apart only by the personal pique\r\nof their leaders. A union of the best elements of the Whigs and the\r\nChathamites would tend to curb the power of the King, maintain the\r\nhonour of the flag, and secure the passage of much-needed reforms.\r\nThe defeat, or at least the postponement, of these salutary aims must\r\nnecessarily result from persistence in the miserable feud. For the\r\ntwo men themselves that interview was fraught with grave issues. The\r\nrepulse of the natural affinities was certain to doom one of them to an\r\nunnatural alliance or to helpless opposition.\r\n\r\nIt must have been with a keen sense of the importance of the crisis\r\nthat these able men faced one another. The interview was soon over.\r\nPitt stated to Fox the object of his visit; whereupon the Whig leader\r\nasked whether it was proposed that Lord Shelburne should remain\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury. On Pitt answering in the affirmative,\r\nFox remarked that it was impossible for him to form part of any\r\nAdministration of which Lord Shelburne was the head. Pitt at once drew\r\nhimself up (so Dundas afterwards declared), and the proud movement of\r\nhis head, the significance of which many an opponent was destined to\r\nfeel, ended the interview. According to Bishop Tomline, he broke off\r\nthe conversation with the words: “I did not come here to betray Lord\r\nShelburne.” The breach was irreparable.[139]\r\n\r\nThree days later, Dundas (soon to be a firm supporter of Pitt) made a\r\ndespairing effort to win over Lord North, who coolly repulsed him. On\r\nthat same day Fox offered his alliance to the man whom for thirteen\r\nyears he had railed at as the instrument of corruption and tyranny.\r\nThey agreed\r\n\r\n    that nothing more was required to be done in reducing the influence\r\n    of the Crown by economical reform, and that on parliamentary reform\r\n    every man should follow his own opinion. Mr. Fox having urged\r\n    that the King should not be suffered to be his own Minister, Lord\r\n    North replied: “If you mean there should not be a government by\r\n    departments, I agree with you. I think it a very bad system. There\r\n    should be one man, or a Cabinet, to govern the whole and direct\r\n    every measure. Government by departments was not brought in by me.\r\n    I found it so, and had not vigour and resolution to put an end\r\n    to it. The King ought to be treated with all sort of respect and\r\n    attention, but the appearance of power is all that a King of this\r\n    country can have.”[140]\r\n\r\nThey then began to consider the question of the distribution of\r\noffices, and finally decided to oppose the forthcoming address to the\r\nKing expressing thankfulness at the peace.\r\n\r\nThus was formed the famous, or infamous, Coalition of 1783. With the\r\npolicy of reducing the governing power of the King, it is impossible\r\nnot to feel much sympathy. George III had hitherto governed England\r\nwithout much let or hindrance, except from Chatham and Rockingham. His\r\nnarrowness and obstinacy were the chief causes of the American War;\r\nand we now know that during four years he had kept Lord North to that\r\nwork, despite his remonstrances. But nothing could reconcile the new\r\nalliance to the public. A shiver of disgust ran through the nation when\r\nit transpired that Fox had plighted troth with the man whom he had\r\nthreatened to impeach; and that impression was never to die away.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is doubtful whether enthusiasm for Reform was the chief\r\nmotive that prompted Fox’s action.[141] As we have seen, he gave up\r\nEconomic Reform; and his stipulation respecting Parliamentary Reform\r\nwas so half-hearted as to doom that question to failure. How could that\r\ncause thrive when it would have the effect of sending the chiefs of\r\nthe future Ministry into opposite lobbies? Fox must have known enough\r\nof Parliament to see that his present conduct hopelessly impaired the\r\nstrength of the reformers, in what was at all times an uphill fight. In\r\ntruth, the whole incident brings into sharp relief the defects of his\r\ncharacter, which, while rich in enthusiasms, ever lacked balance, and\r\nso frequently led him to a reckless use of most questionable means for\r\nthe compassing of ends in themselves desirable.\r\n\r\nIn this instance his recklessness was to blast his whole career. He\r\nseems not to have considered the general impression certain to be\r\ncreated by his facile union with a long-loathed opponent. But the\r\npublic, always prone to harsh judgements on political inconsistencies,\r\nat once inferred that he joined North, partly in order to be revenged\r\non Shelburne for some personal slights, but mainly with the view of\r\nsnatching at the sweets of office which he had of late so unaccountably\r\ncast aside. His conduct seemed oddly to blend all that was foolish in\r\nwayward boyhood with the cunning of an unscrupulous politician. The\r\ncynical majority argued that such extremes as Fox and North could meet\r\nonly under the overmastering pressure of greed; and to idealists or\r\npatriots the Coalition of 1783 seemed to plunge England back into the\r\nold slough of selfishness from which the noble pride of Chatham had\r\nraised her.\r\n\r\nThe name of Chatham reminds us of the Coalition which in 1757 he\r\nframed with his former opponent, the Duke of Newcastle. The two cases\r\nhave indeed been compared; but they have very little in common. Then\r\nthe very existence of England was at stake. She was in the midst of a\r\nwar which was being grossly mismanaged; and the union of the one able\r\nstatesman of the age with the manipulator of patronage, was practically\r\nthe only means of avoiding a national disaster. Now, in February 1783,\r\nhostilities were at an end; the terms of peace were arranged, and were\r\ncertain to take effect, if the new Coalition allowed it. The action\r\nof the elder Pitt in 1757 was inspired by patriotism and crowned by\r\ndeserved triumph. That of Fox and North rested, in part, on more sordid\r\nmotives, jeopardized the conclusion of peace, threw the political world\r\ninto utter confusion, and ended in disaster.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the new Coalition were soon to appear. On Monday 17th\r\nFebruary, the debates opened on the address to the King relative to\r\nthe peace. In the Lords the opposition of Keppel and Richmond to their\r\nlate colleagues was an ominous sign; but still more so was the combined\r\nattack of Foxites and Northites in the Lower House. North spoke with\r\nsomething of the restraint which became a man so largely responsible\r\nfor the present humiliations. He fastened on the worst parts of the\r\ntreaty--the cession of Minorca and the Floridas to Spain, and the\r\nabsence of any guarantees for the American Loyalists. Where he trod\r\nwith measured steps, Sheridan and Fox rushed in with frothy violence.\r\nSheridan declared that the treaty “relinquished completely everything\r\nthat was glorious and great in the country”; and his chief branded it\r\nas “the most disastrous and disgraceful peace that ever this country\r\nhad made.” Then adverting to the understanding with North, which was\r\ngenerally known, Fox defended it by quoting the phrase, “Amicitiae\r\nsempiternae, inimicitiae placabiles.”[142]\r\n\r\nPitt’s speech, in reply to Fox, was not one of his happiest efforts,\r\nand Ministers were left in a minority of sixteen. He excelled himself,\r\nhowever, four days later during the debate on a vote of censure\r\nbrought against the Administration by his former colleague, Lord John\r\nCavendish. The attack was ingeniously made under cover of a series of\r\nresolutions, affirming that the House of Commons accepted the peace,\r\nwhile believing the concessions made to our enemies to be excessive,\r\nand demanding better terms for the American Loyalists. Fox spoke with\r\nhis usual ardour in favour of these mutually destructive resolutions.\r\nAfter declaring that all who looked at the terms of peace must “blush\r\nfor the ignominy of the national character,” he proceeded to defend his\r\nalliance with Lord North. The times, he said, were now changed; they\r\nhad to deal with a Prime Minister, Shelburne, who was “in his nature,\r\nhabitudes, and principles, an enemy to the privileges of the people.”\r\nThey must therefore form “the strongest Coalition which may re-instate\r\nthe people in their rights, privileges, and possessions.”[143]\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether Pitt was aware that the orator had just bartered\r\naway the cause of Parliamentary Reform; but he certainly suspected it;\r\nand the surmise must have kindled a fire of indignation before which\r\nhis bodily weakness vanished. During the long speech of his opponent\r\nhe suffered from fits of vomiting which compelled him at times to hold\r\nopen a small door behind him, called Solomon’s porch. But when, at one\r\no’clock in the morning, he rose to reply, all his weakness vanished.\r\nIn a speech of three hours he traversed the whole ground of the treaty\r\nand reviewed the situation brought about by the recent monstrous\r\nCoalition. He fought hard for the Peace, which the present resolutions\r\nimperilled, and still more so for the maintenance of the honourable\r\ntraditions of public life.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly adverting to the strange part now played by Fox, he\r\ncontinued in terms which showed that he appealed more to the nation\r\nthan to Parliament.\r\n\r\n    The triumphs of party, Sir, with which this self-appointed Minister\r\n    seems so highly elate, shall never seduce me to any inconsistency\r\n    which the busiest suspicion shall presume to glance at. I will\r\n    never engage in political enmities without a public cause. I\r\n    will never forego such enmities without the public approbation;\r\n    nor will I be questioned and cast off in the face of this House\r\n    by one virtuous and dissatisfied friend.[144] These, Sir, the\r\n    sober and durable triumphs of reason over the weak and profligate\r\n    inconsistencies of party violence; these, Sir, the steady\r\n    triumphs of virtue over success itself, shall be mine, not only\r\n    in my present situation but through every future condition of my\r\n    life--triumphs which no length of time shall diminish, which no\r\n    change of principle shall sully.\r\n\r\nHe then showed that a continuance of war would be full of peril and\r\nmight lead to national bankruptcy; that Ministers were not, as at the\r\nend of the Seven Years’ War, able to dictate terms of peace, and that\r\nthose now proposed were as favourable as could be expected. If we had\r\nceded Florida, we had regained the Bahamas and Providence. While losing\r\nTobago and St. Lucia, we recovered Grenada, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis,\r\nand Montserrat. In Africa we should once more hold Senegambia, the best\r\nand healthiest settlement. The loss of Minorca was bearable, for the\r\nisland was expensive in peace and never tenable in war. Then, adverting\r\nto the alleged betrayal of the American Loyalists, he appealed warmly\r\nfor reconciliation with the United States, and still more warmly\r\ndeprecated the suspicion that Congress would be guilty of the base\r\ninjustice of doing nothing for those sufferers. His words have the ring\r\nof sincere conviction; but it is painful to have to add that these\r\nmagnanimous hopes were doomed to disappointment.[145]\r\n\r\nDescending to the lower levels of party strife, he declared that\r\nhis opponents were aiming their shafts, not at the Treaty, but at\r\nthe Earl of Shelburne. Their unnatural coalition was brought about\r\nby personal spite; and, he added with thrilling emphasis: “If this\r\nill-omened marriage is not already solemnized, I know a just and lawful\r\nimpediment, and, in the name of the public safety, I here forbid the\r\nbanns.” Finally, in what seemed a farewell to the cares of office,\r\nhe vindicated his conduct, as inspired by the traditions of Chatham,\r\nand he appealed to the House and to the nation at large in this noble\r\nperoration:\r\n\r\n    You may take from me, Sir, the privileges and emoluments of place,\r\n    but you cannot, and you shall not, take from me those habitual and\r\n    warm regards for the prosperity of Great Britain, which constitute\r\n    the honour, the happiness, the pride of my life, and which I trust\r\n    death alone can extinguish. And, with this consolation, the loss of\r\n    power, Sir, and the loss of fortune, though I affect not to despise\r\n    them, I hope I soon shall be able to forget:\r\n\r\n      Laudo manentem. Si celeres quatit\r\n      Pennas, resigno quae dedit\r\n                      ... probamque\r\n      Pauperiem sine dote quaero.[146]\r\n\r\nA member of the House relates that when he came to the words--“et mea\r\nvirtute me involvo”--he paused for a moment, drew his handkerchief\r\nacross his lips, and then, as if recovering from a slight\r\nembarrassment, gave the final words with thrilling effect.[147]\r\n\r\nThe whole speech aroused an interest and emotion unequalled since\r\nthe time of Chatham’s mighty orations. North complimented the young\r\nChancellor on his amazing eloquence, which had so deeply affected every\r\nmember of the House, and stated that, though he himself was the object\r\nof his thunder, he had listened to that thunder with astonishment and\r\ndelight. He then asserted that better terms might have been gained,\r\nespecially from the Americans, and declared his belief that the new\r\nCoalition would greatly benefit the country. The House by a majority of\r\nseventeen decided for North and against Pitt.\r\n\r\nIn the Lords, Shelburne had a majority of thirteen; but the victory of\r\nNorth and Fox in the Commons led him to offer to resign office on 24th\r\nFebruary 1783. In this honourable manner ended Pitt’s first tenure of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE COALITION\r\n\r\n    Of all the public characters of this devoted country (Mr. Pitt\r\n    alone excepted) there is not a man who has, or who deserves, the\r\n    nation’s confidence.--ROMILLY _21st March 1783_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn politics, as in war, victories sometimes prove to be more disastrous\r\nthan defeats. When triumph lures a leader on into ever increasing\r\ndifficulties, he may well rue his seeming good fortune; while,\r\non the other hand, the retreat of his opponents may lessen their\r\nresponsibilities, and, by enabling them to concentrate, double the\r\nstrength of their next blow.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case with Fox and Pitt. Fox’s triumph over the former was\r\nseen by discerning friends to be of the Pyrrhic kind. He owed it to an\r\nunprincipled alliance, and for it he threw away the support of public\r\nopinion. Pitt, on the other hand, fell gloriously, fighting strenuously\r\nfor terms of peace which, in the nature of things, his successors could\r\nnot sensibly ameliorate. Accordingly, events worked for him and against\r\nthe victors. Only a well organized party can resist the wear and tear\r\nof parliamentary strife; and it lay in the nature of things that greed\r\nof place and pension--to say nothing of political differences--should\r\nsunder these hungry and unprincipled groups.\r\n\r\nBut while the voice of prudence counselled delay, missives from Windsor\r\nurgently requested Pitt to assume the supreme command of the beaten\r\nhost. Well might the King be insistent. In the young statesman, and\r\nin him alone, could he discern a possible saviour from the two-headed\r\nmonster of the Coalition. As usual, he viewed the crisis from a purely\r\npersonal point of view. In a characteristic letter to Shelburne he\r\nsaid nothing on the wider issues that were at stake, still less did he\r\nvouchsafe a word of thanks for his valuable services; but he deplored\r\nhis own lot in having to reign in a most profligate age, and declared\r\nonce more that he would never submit to the Coalition.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the credit of advising the choice of Pitt as the\r\nnew Prime Minister rests with Shelburne. Certainly the idea did not\r\noriginate with Henry Dundas, as he afterwards claimed; for on Monday\r\nmorning, 24th February 1783, Dundas wrote to Shelburne as follows:\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n    I cannot refrain from troubling your Lordship with a few lines\r\n    upon a subject of the most serious importance; and the particular\r\n    ground of my addressing you arises from the words which dropped\r\n    from you yesterday morning relative to Mr. Pitt. I did not pay\r\n    much attention to them when you uttered them, but I have revolved\r\n    them seriously and candidly in the course of the day yesterday,\r\n    and I completely satisfied my own mind that, young as he is, the\r\n    appointment of him to the Government of the country is the only\r\n    step that can be taken in the present moment attended with the most\r\n    distant chance of rearing up the Government of this country....\r\n    He is perfectly new ground, against whom no opposition can arise\r\n    except what may be expected from the desperation of that lately\r\n    allied faction, which I am satisfied will likewise gradually\r\n    decline till at last it will consist only of that insolent\r\n    aristocratical band who assume to themselves the prerogative of\r\n    appointing the rulers of the kingdom. I repeat it again that I am\r\n    certain the experiment will succeed if His Majesty will try it.[148]\r\n\r\n                                                       HENRY DUNDAS.\r\n\r\nThe King warmly welcomed Shelburne’s suggestion, sent for Pitt, and\r\nurged him to form a Ministry on his own terms. The young statesman,\r\nfar from succumbing to the glamour of the moment, at once foresaw\r\nthe difficulties of the proposal, and requested time for reflection.\r\nDundas sat up with him through that night, going through the names of\r\nmembers of the House, and calculating the chances of adequate support.\r\nIn a letter which Pitt wrote to his mother on the 25th, he speaks of\r\nthe question as turning on that of numbers in the House. On the next\r\nday and the morning of the 27th he seemed ready to accept the King’s\r\noffer, on the strength of an assurance given by Dundas that Lord North\r\nwould not actively oppose him. But on the afternoon of that day he laid\r\nbefore the King his reasons for declining the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe interview was long and earnest. It marked the beginning of that\r\ncontest of wills which only ceased with life itself. The King strove\r\nhard to gain for his service the only man of note who stood between him\r\nand the new Coalition. He plied the young Minister with every possible\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n    Nothing [so the King wrote to Shelburne on that day] could get\r\n    him to depart from the ground he took, that nothing less than a\r\n    moral certainty of a majority in the House of Commons could make\r\n    him undertake the task; for that it would be dishonourable not to\r\n    succeed, if attempted; all I could obtain was that he should again\r\n    try, but as fixed a declaration that, if he cannot meet with what\r\n    he thinks certainty, he shall decline.[149]\r\n\r\nWe could wish to know more about this interview and to follow the\r\nmental wrestling of the Sovereign with the young barrister. Rarely,\r\nexcept perhaps from Chatham, had George III met with so firm a resolve\r\nnot to accept office; and we may reasonably infer that the reluctance\r\nwhich baffled the arts of the King sprang from a deep fund of pride.\r\nPitt scorned to be Minister by sufferance of North--a man whom he\r\nloathed. Further, why should he take up that burden at the bidding\r\nof the Sovereign whom he knew to be the chief cause of the present\r\ndifficulties? Was it not better that George III and his former tool\r\nshould unravel the tangle of their own making? As North and Fox for the\r\npresent commanded the House of Commons, they must govern, as long as\r\nthey could hold together. Reasons of varied kinds, therefore, must have\r\nled Pitt to hold back; and though he promised the King to consider the\r\nmatter, we may be sure that his resolve was virtually formed.\r\n\r\nOther names were then mooted, including those of Thomas Pitt and Earl\r\nTemple; but, as George III bitterly complained, not one of them had\r\nspirit enough to stand forth. All his efforts to escape the meshes of\r\nthe Coalition were in vain. Meanwhile, public affairs went from bad\r\nto worse. “Our internal regulations (so William Grenville wrote to\r\nTemple), our loan, our commerce, our army, everything is at a stand\r\n... we have no money, and our troops and seamen are in mutiny.”[150]\r\nBut, for a whole month, nothing bent the King’s purpose. It was clear\r\nthat he was seeking to sow discord among his opponents.[151] In this\r\nhe failed. Finally the Coalition succeeded in imposing its nominee,\r\nthe Duke of Portland, on the King; but, as George insisted that his\r\n“friend,” Lord Thurlow, should continue to be Lord Chancellor, the duke\r\nand his backers broke off the negotiations (18th to 20th March). At\r\nonce the King sent for Pitt in the following curt note--the first in\r\nhis long correspondence with him.[152]\r\n\r\n                                    Queen’s House, _March 20, 1783_.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Pitt, I desire you will come here immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                               G. R.\r\n\r\nOnce more, then, the King made his offer to the young statesman. For\r\nfive days he sought to bend that stubborn will, urging the needs of\r\nthe public service and his own resolve never to admit the Duke of\r\nPortland and North after their treatment of him. But on 25th March Pitt\r\npolitely, but most firmly, declined, on the same grounds as before.\r\nThe King thereupon declared himself much hurt at his refusal to stand\r\nforth against “the most daring and unprincipled faction that the annals\r\nof this kingdom ever produced.”[153] Once more he talked of retiring\r\nto Hanover and leaving to the Coalition the task of governing Great\r\nBritain. But on mentioning this scheme to his hard-headed counsellor,\r\nLord Thurlow, he is said to have received the illuminating advice\r\nthat the journey to Hanover was easy enough; but the example of\r\nJames II’s travels abroad warranted the conclusion that the return\r\njourney was more difficult.[154] The story is _ben trovato_; but we\r\nmay doubt whether even Thurlow’s assurance was equal to this ironical\r\ndissuasiveness, and whether George III would ask advice on a step\r\nnever meant to be taken, and threatened merely in petulance. Equally\r\nunconvincing is the story of the King bursting into tears in the\r\npresence of the hated Duke of Portland. If the age was lachrymose,[155]\r\nGeorge III was not.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the Coalition had conquered. They dictated their terms.\r\nGeorge bent before the parliamentary storm, perhaps taking heart from\r\nThurlow’s words, that time and patience would cure the present evils.\r\nOn the last day of March, Pitt, with the relic of Shelburne’s Ministry,\r\nresigned office; and on the 2nd of April the new Ministers kissed\r\nhands. One who saw that function declared that he foresaw the fate of\r\nthe Coalition Ministry; for when Fox came up for that ceremony, “George\r\nIII turned back his ears and eyes just like the horse at Astley’s when\r\nthe tailor he had determined to throw was getting on him.”[156]\r\n\r\nThe observer augured well. Fox’s eagerness to mount the saddle, and\r\nPitt’s determination to stand aloof largely determined their future\r\ncareers and the course of history. Success comes to the man who knows,\r\nnot only when to strike swiftly and hard, but also how to bide his\r\ntime. The examples of Pericles and Epaminondas; of Fabius Maximus,\r\nCaesar and Caesar Augustus in ancient history; of Louis XI, Elizabeth,\r\nCromwell, William of Orange, Talleyrand, and even of Napoleon, might\r\nbe cited as proofs of the power inherent in far-seeing patience. With\r\nPitt’s refusal of power in the spring of 1783 we may compare Napoleon’s\r\nprudent reserve in the French political game of the years 1797–8, based\r\nas it was on his declaration to Talleyrand in October 1797: “It is only\r\nwith prudence, wisdom and great dexterity that obstacles are surmounted\r\nand important ends attained.... I see no impossibility in attaining,\r\nin the course of a few years, those splendid results of which the\r\nheated and enthusiastic imagination catches a glimpse, but which the\r\nextremely cool, persevering and positive man alone can grasp.” Pitt’s\r\ngreat speech of 21st February 1783 showed him to possess imaginative\r\ngifts and ambition of a high order; his refusal of office, owing to\r\nthe stubborn facts of arithmetic, was the outcome of those cool and\r\ncalculating instincts without which aspiring genius is a balloon devoid\r\nof ballast.\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded by the public to the Coalition Ministry was\r\nfar from flattering. No sooner were the names of Ministers known,\r\non 2nd April 1783, than indignation ran high. The Duke of Portland,\r\nas First Lord of the Treasury, was seen to be an ornamental figure,\r\neasily controllable by Fox. The two Secretaries of State were North\r\nand Fox, the latter leading the House of Commons; and this close\r\nofficial union of two men who had spent their lives in vilifying each\r\nother was generally reprobated.[157] Fox, formerly the bitterest of\r\nNorth’s revilers, was held to have betrayed his Whig principles; and\r\nhis once enthusiastic constituents at Westminster, at his re-election\r\nrefused him a hearing, shouting him down several times. The conduct of\r\nNorth, the reviled, seemed incredibly base and unmanly. For the rest,\r\nLord John Cavendish (dubbed by Selwyn “the learned canary-bird”) took\r\nPitt’s place at the Exchequer; Lord Stormont became President of the\r\nCouncil, the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Privy Seal; and Keppel returned to\r\nthe Admiralty. The foregoing formed the Cabinet. As the King was forced\r\nto part with his man, Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor’s seal was put in\r\ncommission, Lord Loughborough (formerly Mr. Wedderburn, a man apt at\r\nbetrayal) becoming first commissioner. Burke and Sheridan were rewarded\r\nwith the subordinate posts of Paymaster of the Forces and Secretary\r\nto the Treasury. Thus the Whig members were in the ascendant, though\r\nNorth’s party predominated in the House of Commons. Temple resigned the\r\nLord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, which went, after an embarrassing delay,\r\nto one of Fox’s boon companions at Brooks’s, Lord Northington.[158]\r\n\r\nWilberforce, with his usual power of hitting off a situation, declared\r\nthat the Fox-North Coalition inherited the defects of its progenitors,\r\nthe violence of Fox and the corruption of North. This was the general\r\nopinion. As for George III, he raged against this unnatural union.\r\nHe could not mention the subject without falling into the flurried\r\nincoherent kind of talk which afterwards marked the on-coming of\r\nattacks of lunacy. Private hatred of Fox, as the man who led astray\r\nthe Prince of Wales into the equally odious paths of gambling and\r\npolitical opposition, fed the King’s animosity against the Whig orator\r\nas the foe of the constitution. But the vials of his wrath were poured\r\nforth on North, for his betrayal of the royal confidence lavished on\r\nhim for a decade. On 1st April, George III informed Temple that he\r\nhoped the nation’s eyes would soon be opened, and that the Pitts and\r\nGrenvilles would deliver him from the thraldom of the Coalition. For\r\nthe present, he would certainly refuse to grant any honours asked for\r\nby the new Ministry.[159] As the greed of the Coalition was notorious,\r\nthe situation thus became piquant in the extreme. Amusement at the\r\nirony of the situation must have helped, in Pitt’s case, to lighten\r\nthe disappointment of retiring from office. Certainly he was never\r\ndowncast. Wilberforce’s journal shows him to have been a frequent and a\r\njoyous visitor to Wimbledon. This was the time of the spring-sowing of\r\nthe flower-beds of Lauriston House with the fragments of Ryder’s opera\r\nhat. (See Chapter XII.)\r\n\r\nOther and more practical fruits of his hopefulness were his efforts\r\nfor Parliamentary Reform, clouded over though that cause was by the\r\nalliance of Whigs and the former “King’s Friends.” Acting not as a\r\npartisan (for, just before resigning office, he informed the House\r\nthat he belonged to no party), he introduced a motion on 7th May for\r\nthe Reform of Parliament. On this occasion London and Kent seemed to\r\ntake an interest in the motion, and the approaches to St. Stephen’s as\r\nwell as the galleries were thronged by petitioners in favour of Reform.\r\nThe freeholders of Kent, the householders of the Tower Hamlets, and\r\nthe electors of Westminster (the last headed by Fox!), came in great\r\nnumbers to give weight to their petitions. Horace Walpole noted that\r\nKent and Essex had joined the Quintuple Alliance (_i.e._, of counties)\r\nin favour of Reform.[160]\r\n\r\nIn due course Pitt rose to bring in his motion. He claimed that the\r\ndisasters of the past years had at length caused the people “to turn\r\ntheir eyes inward on themselves” to find out the cause of the evil.\r\nNo one could now doubt that the radical fault in the constitution was\r\nthe secret influence of the Crown as exerted on the House of Commons.\r\nFor the redress of this evil three plans had been proposed, first, the\r\nextension of the franchise to every man--a proposal which he scouted as\r\nboth impracticable and even undesirable, seeing that the minority must\r\nthen hold themselves to be slaves to the majority. (It is difficult to\r\nfollow Pitt here; for every electoral system implies a majority and\r\nminority; and hardship arises only when the majority is subservient to\r\nthe minority--as was the case in 1783.) Their forefathers, he added,\r\nhad never contemplated giving a vote to every man, and the scheme was\r\n“a mere speculative proposition that may be good in theory but which\r\nit would be absurd and chimerical to endeavour to reduce to practice.”\r\nThese words should be noted. For they refute the slander that Pitt\r\n“ratted” from the cause of Reform in and after 1790, when it was based\r\non the Jacobin theory of universal suffrage, which he had always\r\nrepudiated.\r\n\r\nPitt’s second proposal of Reform was to abolish the “rotten boroughs.”\r\nHe confessed that they were “deformities” in our system, but he felt\r\nthat they could not be removed without endangering the whole pile.\r\nThe third proposal seemed to him far better, namely, to add a number\r\nof members for the counties and the metropolis. He summed up his\r\ncontentions in three Resolutions: (1) for the prevention of bribery and\r\nundue expense at elections; (2) the disfranchisement of boroughs where\r\ncorruption was proven; (3) an addition to members of counties and of\r\nthe metropolis. The details of these proposals were to be specified in\r\na Bill, if the Resolutions were carried. They met with support from\r\nFox, while their very limited character, which Sheridan ridiculed,\r\ncommended them to Dundas and Thomas Pitt, who previously had opposed\r\nReform.[161] As a pledge of his sincerity, Thomas Pitt offered to\r\nsurrender his rights over the parliamentary borough of Old Sarum.\r\n\r\nAll was of no avail. North, Colonel Luttrell, Lord Mulgrave, and others\r\ndeclaimed against any change in the glorious constitution. The House\r\nby a majority of one hundred and forty-four reprobated the dangerous\r\nspirit of innovation which was abroad. Doubtless the demoralization of\r\nthe Whigs made defeat inevitable. Pitt himself spoke with less than\r\nhis usual effectiveness; and the absence of petitions from the new\r\nmanufacturing towns showed that the country at large cared little for\r\nthe question. This apathy seems to us unaccountable until we remember\r\nthat Manchester, Leeds, and Halifax tamely suffered Richard Cromwell to\r\nannul the act of enfranchisement which the great Oliver had bestowed\r\nupon them. Evidently the age-long torpor still lay upon the land.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of the session, Pitt brought in measures for effecting\r\nretrenchment in the public offices. He commented on such abuses as the\r\nfollowing: that the chief clerk of the navy office received a salary\r\nof £250 a year, but ten times that amount in gifts, and other clerks in\r\nthe same proportion. The Secretary of the Post Office raised his salary\r\nof £500 to a total of £3,000 by a 2½ per cent. charge on all packets--a\r\ncuriously cumbrous method of redress. The expense of stationery at the\r\noffice of Lord North during his term at the Treasury was £1,300 a year,\r\none item being £340 for whip-cord! By careful economies Pitt hoped to\r\nsave the nation £40,000 a year. The debate was rendered remarkable by\r\na speech from Burke. The great man was smarting under the censure of\r\nthe House for reinstating two dishonest officials, and had betrayed the\r\nCeltic sensitiveness of his nature by drearily ranting until Fox and\r\nSheridan fairly pulled him to his seat. He now rallied Pitt on “prying\r\ninto the little perquisites of little men in little offices, while he\r\nsuffered the greatest abuses to exist in the offices under his eye.\r\nHe seemed to have that nice olfactory nerve which could smell a ball\r\nof horsedung a thousand miles off, but which was not affected by the\r\nstench of a dunghill under his very window.” Burke, however, failed\r\nto substantiate the latter part of his malodorous simile. The measure\r\npassed the Commons, only to perish in the Lords. Keppel denied that\r\nthere were any abuses at the Admiralty; the Duke of Portland opined\r\nthat Pitt’s reforms would cost as much as they saved; and Stormont\r\ndeclared that they would be highly inconvenient.[162] The same fate\r\nbefell a measure, which Pitt warmly supported, for lessening expenses\r\nat elections.\r\n\r\nIn his speech on Lord John Cavendish’s Budget, Pitt showed a practical\r\nknowledge of finance which enabled him trenchantly to expose the weak\r\npoints of his successor’s proposals; and he further pointed out the\r\nbest means for launching a loan on the most favourable terms. His\r\nreputation gained in solidity during the session; and if his speeches,\r\nafter the great effort of 21st February, lacked brilliance, they\r\nexhibited his capacity and his grasp of affairs.\r\n\r\nMinisters, on the other hand, lost ground, owing to their own blunders\r\nand the widening of the gulf between their discordant sections. A case\r\nin point was their treatment of the question of the allowance for the\r\nPrince of Wales. As will appear later more in detail, the relations\r\nbetween the King and the Prince were already so strained that the\r\nMinistry--“my son’s Ministry,” the King sometimes called it--must\r\nhave known the question to be thorny. The tastes of George III being\r\nas frugal as those of his son were extravagant, a clear understanding\r\nwith the King seemed the first essential to a settlement. Yet Fox\r\nand his supporters in the Cabinet prevailed on the other Ministers,\r\nrather reluctantly, to allot the sum of £100,000 a year to the Prince,\r\nand that, too, without consulting the King. According to Horace\r\nWalpole, the proposal came to light during a casual conversation\r\nbetween the King and the Duke of Portland on 11th June. The account\r\ngiven in the “Fox Memorials” seems, however, to convict George III\r\nof inconsistency.[163] In any case, he angrily declaimed against the\r\nproposal, as showing that Ministers, despite their professions of\r\neconomy, “were ready to sacrifice the public interests to the wishes\r\nof _an ill-advised young man_”; he declared his readiness to allow the\r\nPrince £50,000 a year from the Civil List, so as not to burden the\r\npublic. This was the sum which he himself had received as Prince of\r\nWales; and he held strong ground in proposing to support his bachelor\r\nson on a similar allowance.\r\n\r\nThis was the mine sprung upon the Ministry on 16th June. It promised\r\nto end their existence; and Fox believed that the King would seize\r\nthe opportunity to dismiss Ministers, dissolve Parliament, and appeal\r\nto the country on the cry of economy, paternal authority, and no\r\nmischief-making between father and son. Doubtless he would have done\r\nso but for the very speedy compliance of the Prince of Wales with\r\nhis expressed wishes--an act of submission due less to the filial\r\ndevotion of the Prince than to his desire to save his favourite from\r\na crushing defeat at the polls. Ultimately, on 23rd June, the House\r\nagreed to vote the sum of £60,000 for the present needs of the Prince,\r\nas regards debts and the furnishing of Carlton House, and £50,000\r\na year out of the Civil List. The incident led to some regrettable\r\ncomplications. Fox seems to have attributed the King’s sudden anger to\r\nan intrigue of Pitt, whom he dubbed “an unscrupulous opposer.”[164]\r\nFurther, the Prince thenceforth more than ever looked on his father\r\nand the opponents of Fox as his own personal enemies, in that they\r\nbound him down to an insufficient allowance, which he felt no scruple\r\nin exceeding. The wretched business of the Prince of Wales’s debts, and\r\neven that of the Regency, resulted in no small measure from the bad\r\nblood engendered in the strife of June 1783.\r\n\r\nThe King, also, as we can now see by the new light which the Dropmore\r\nPapers have thrown on events, watched the course of affairs more\r\nclosely than ever in order to pave the way to office for the Pitts and\r\nGrenvilles. But his rancour did not blunt his prudence. He was resolved\r\nnot to exchange one set of masters for another. If Pitt came in, it\r\nmust be on terms favourable to the Crown. George saw Temple after his\r\nabandonment of the cares of State at Dublin Castle, and soon began to\r\nsound him and Pitt as to their ideas on a future Ministry.[165]\r\n\r\nThere was one grave objection to Pitt, namely, his zeal for Reform.\r\nSeeing that the Coalition Ministry was lukewarm on this subject,\r\nthe King strove to ensure similar complaisance on the part of its\r\nsuccessor. He therefore commissioned his secret bargainer, Thurlow, to\r\nsee Pitt and clear up this question. The ex-Lord Chancellor invited his\r\nformer colleague to dinner on 19th July, five days after the end of\r\nthe session. He was very wary in his overtures, and Pitt complained to\r\nGrenville that he had a very good meal, but little information. Thurlow\r\nwas profuse in hints and innuendos, which Pitt gauged at their real\r\nvalue. First he depicted the situation as by no means unfavourable to\r\nthe King, who had gone through the worst when he admitted the Foxites\r\nto office. On Pitt suggesting that perhaps he would become reconciled\r\nto them, Thurlow hastened to add that that was impossible, especially\r\nafter the affair of the Prince’s allowance. The “King’s friend” then\r\nturned the conversation to the subject of Parliamentary Reform and the\r\ninfluence of the Crown.\r\n\r\n    His object (so Pitt wrote to Earl Temple) was to insinuate that\r\n    a change was not so necessary to the King; and to endeavour to\r\n    make it (if it should take place) rather our act than his; and\r\n    on that ground to try whether terms might not be imposed that\r\n    could not otherwise. This is so totally contrary to every idea we\r\n    both entertain that I thought it necessary to take full care to\r\n    counteract it. I stated in general that if the King’s feelings\r\n    did not point strongly to a change, it was not what we sought.\r\n    But that if they did, and we could form a permanent system,\r\n    consistent with our principles, and on public ground, we should not\r\n    decline it. I reminded him how much I was personally pledged to\r\n    Parliamentary Reform on the principles I had publicly explained,\r\n    which I should support on every seasonable occasion. I treated as\r\n    out of the question any idea of measures being taken to extend\r\n    [Crown] influence, though such means as are fairly in the hands\r\n    of Ministers would undoubtedly be to be exerted. And I said that\r\n    I wished those with whom I might act, and the King (if he called\r\n    upon me) to be fully apprized of the grounds on which I should\r\n    necessarily proceed....[166]\r\n\r\nThis is a declaration of the highest importance. If Thurlow was not\r\nvery explicit, Pitt certainly was; and it is clear that he fathomed\r\nthe intentions of George III. They were, in brief, to use the present\r\nunsatisfactory state of things as an inducement to a patriotic and\r\nambitious young man to come forward as a “King’s friend,” taking up the\r\nplace which North’s defection had left vacant. Shelving the problem of\r\nParliamentary Reform, Pitt was to govern for the King and by means of\r\nhis influence. The young statesman saw the snare, skilfully evaded it,\r\nand let it be understood that, if he took office, he would come in on\r\nhis own terms, not on those of the King. Firm in the alliance of the\r\nGrenvilles, and all who detested the Coalition Ministry, he needed not\r\nto supplicate the royal favour. Once more he would bide his time, until\r\nthe King sued for his support. Temple in his reply warmly commended his\r\nsound sense and honourable conduct, acknowledging that Pitt was pledged\r\nto Reform, so long as there was any chance of success.\r\n\r\nA time of skilful balancing now ensued. The King, disappointed at\r\nPitt’s independent attitude, took Temple’s advice, and decided to\r\nleave to his Ministers the odium of concluding peace, and of bringing\r\nin proposals of Reform which would certainly disappoint some and\r\nexasperate others of their following. It is clear, however, that, after\r\nhis annoyance at the question of the Prince of Wales’s allowance,\r\nGeorge resolved to dismiss his Ministers as soon as their popularity\r\nwaned, and to recur to personal rule, if he could find a serviceable\r\ninstrument. It was generally known by the end of the session that\r\nPitt might play that part as soon as he chose. George hinted as much\r\nto Thurlow, who passed it on to the political world. The news was\r\nwell known when Pitt went down to Brighthelmstone for sea-bathing in\r\nAugust.[167]\r\n\r\nOther causes, however, besides the aloofness of Pitt, concurred to\r\npostpone the crisis. The Cabinet, feeling its position insecure, was\r\nin no haste to sign the definitive treaties of peace, feeling the\r\ninterval of uncertainty to be some guarantee of continuance in office.\r\nThere was also some hope that the Czarina, Catharine II, intent as she\r\nwas on plans against Turkey, would court our alliance and thus end our\r\nisolation.[168] Thus the state of party affairs in England, as well as\r\nthe changing ambitions of the Czarina, helped to postpone the final\r\nsettlement; but ultimately the treaties were signed on 3rd September\r\nat Versailles. They varied very slightly from the preliminaries which\r\nMinisters, when in opposition, had so violently attacked. Apart from\r\na stipulation for the safeguarding of British property in the ceded\r\nisland of Tobago, and the better definition of our rights in the gum\r\ntrade, there was no material change. The American Loyalists, for\r\nwhom Fox and Burke had so passionately pleaded, were left in the\r\nsame position as in the preliminary treaty. The Coalition Ministry\r\nin five months of bargaining secured no better terms from France and\r\nSpain than Shelburne had arranged. Fox and North, who had blamed\r\ntheir predecessors for failing to make a commercial agreement with\r\nthe United States, now had to confess their own failure. Finally, the\r\nPreliminaries with Holland, signed on 2nd September, showed that Fox,\r\nwho, with Sheridan, had declaimed against the expected retrocession of\r\nTrincomalee to the Dutch, now consented to it. Negapatam, a far less\r\ncommanding post, was retained.\r\n\r\nThese actions exposed Ministers to the charge of gross inconsistency\r\nin ratifying conditions of peace against which they had inveighed in\r\nunmeasured terms. On 11th November Pitt rallied them on this topic, and\r\nthen, soaring from the low levels of partisan warfare, to the heights\r\nof statesmanlike survey, he uttered these words:\r\n\r\n    The nation has a right to expect that, without delay, a complete\r\n    commercial system, suited to the novelty of our situation, will\r\n    be laid before Parliament. I am acquainted with the difficulty\r\n    of the business and will not attribute the delay hitherto to any\r\n    neglect on the part of Ministers. I am willing to ascribe it to the\r\n    nature of the negotiation; but I expect that the business will soon\r\n    be brought forward, not by piece-meal, but that one grand system\r\n    of commerce, built upon the circumstances of the times, will be\r\n    submitted to the House for their consideration.[169]\r\n\r\nThis is the first sign of Pitt’s resolve to give effect to the\r\nteachings of Adam Smith, and to aid in founding on the ruins of our old\r\ncolonial system a fabric far sounder and more beneficent. It is further\r\nsignificant, as showing the absence of factiousness in the Opposition,\r\nthat the address to the King of thanks for the peace was carried\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have looked ahead in order to glance at Pitt’s conduct respecting\r\nthe treaties of peace concluded on 3rd September; let us turn to his\r\nmovements during the vacation. First he ran down to Brighthelmstone\r\nto take some dips in the sea; and then struck away westwards towards\r\nSomerset for a flying visit to Lady Chatham at Burton Pynsent. Next,\r\nafter a short stay at Kingston Hall, Bankes’s country house in Dorset,\r\nin company with Wilberforce and Eliot, he returned to town on 7th\r\nSeptember in order to look into the political situation. He found that\r\nthe Ministry was losing favour mainly because the King refused to grant\r\nany peerages at their request. Apart from this, however, there was no\r\nsign of a collapse. That stormy petrel of politics, Lord Thurlow, was\r\nabroad; and Pitt probably considered it tactful not to linger about\r\ntown, but to visit the Continent. Before setting out, he attended the\r\n_levée_ at St. James’s on 10th September; and the King inquired the\r\ntime of his return “in a rather significant manner.”[170]\r\n\r\nOn the next day he met Wilberforce and Eliot at Canterbury, and on\r\nthe 12th they crossed to Calais. He found the journey to Reims more\r\ncomfortable, and the appearance of the people more prosperous, than he\r\nhad expected; but “the face of the country the dullest I ever saw.”\r\nThe reception of the party at Reims, where they proposed to improve\r\ntheir French before proceeding to Paris, had a spice of novelty.\r\nEach of the three friends had trusted to the others to provide the\r\nneedful introductions. As a result they were able only to obtain one\r\nintroduction, through the London banker, Thellusson, and this proved\r\nto be to a grocer, whom they found behind his counter selling figs and\r\nraisins. Somewhat crestfallen, the three _milords anglais_ returned to\r\ntheir inn. Not for ten days did they gain an _entrée_ to the intendant\r\nof Reims, and through him to the Archbishop. His Grace was by no means\r\nan awe-inspiring personage; he figures in Wilberforce’s letters as a\r\njolly fellow, about forty years of age, who played billiards like other\r\npeople. The three friends also met an Abbé de Lageard, “a fellow of\r\ninfinite humour,” who used to entertain them by visits of five or six\r\nhours at a stretch. To him, early in their acquaintance, Pitt mooted a\r\ngrievance, that there, in the middle of Champagne, they could get no\r\nwine that was even tolerable. The abbé thereupon entertained them at\r\nhis house with the best wine of the province, and with five hours of\r\nbreezy talk.\r\n\r\nPitt, so we learn from Wilberforce, was the most fluent of the visitors\r\non these occasions. His ear, “quick for every sound but music,”\r\nreadily caught the intonations of the language, and he soon conversed\r\nwith ease and fair accuracy. Some few of his _mots_ are preserved\r\nby Wilberforce. In answer to the abbé’s inquiry about his opinion\r\nof French institutions, Pitt replied: “Sir, you have no political\r\nliberty, but as for liberty in civil affairs, you have more than you\r\nthink.” His opinion on the durability of the English constitution is\r\neven more surprising. “The part of our constitution which will first\r\nperish is the prerogative of the King and the authority of the House\r\nof Peers.”[171] None of Pitt’s sayings is more remarkable than this,\r\nuttered as it was long before the storms of the French Revolution, and\r\nafter the British monarchy had easily weathered the Atlantic gale.\r\nPossibly the conviction here recorded helps to explain why, at the\r\nclose of the year, Pitt undertook to support the monarchy, in order to\r\nmaintain that balance of the English constitution which all thinkers\r\n(especially Montesquieu) had praised as its peculiar excellence.\r\n\r\nThe third of the _mots_ mentioned by Wilberforce illustrates the\r\ngenerosity of Pitt’s character, a trait in which his opponents, judging\r\nfrom his generally cold exterior, believed him to be deficient. On the\r\nabbé expressing surprise at so moral a country as England allowing\r\nitself to be governed by Fox, a man signally deficient in private\r\ncharacter, Pitt replied: “Ah! you have not been under the wand of the\r\nmagician.” Out of the varied scintillations of wit and gaiety with\r\nwhich Pitt brightened this five weeks’ sojourn in France, we catch\r\na glimpse of these three sparks alone. Doubtless the weakness of\r\nWilberforce’s eyes at that time accounts for the tantalizingly meagre\r\nentries in his diary; but, seeing how elusive a figure Pitt is, we must\r\nbe thankful even for these slight jottings.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore left wondering about the intercourse between the\r\nthree Englishmen and Talleyrand, who was then staying with his uncle,\r\nthe Archbishop of Reims. Of their brilliant conversations--for where\r\nTalleyrand was dullness could not dwell--we know nothing. Talleyrand\r\nand Pitt, we are told, instructed one another in their mother tongues\r\nand exchanged ideas, especially on literature and the advantages\r\nof Free Trade.[172] What a subject for Landor, this interchange of\r\nthoughts between the ablest young men of the age, who agreed on all\r\nthe essentials of politics and yet were soon to be forced by destiny\r\ninto bitter conflict! How different the future might have been had\r\nTalleyrand had enough strength and straightforwardness to become chief\r\nof the French Republic!\r\n\r\nThe stay of the three friends at Reims ended on 9th October, owing to\r\nPitt’s desire to reach Paris in time to see George Rose, a Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, who had been travelling on the Continent with Lord\r\nThurlow. There can be little doubt that Pitt hoped to hear from him\r\nnews respecting the situation in London; for they had confidential\r\nconverse, in which Pitt gained over Rose completely to his side.[173]\r\nAt Paris he had intercourse with Lafayette, Benjamin Franklin, and\r\nmany other celebrities. By special invitation they shared in the\r\ngala festivities of the Court at Fontainebleau, and there saw not\r\nonly the French Ministers and chief nobles, but also the King and\r\nQueen (15th-19th October). That was the heyday of Louis XVI and Marie\r\nAntoinette. The conclusion of the Peace of Versailles with England\r\nseemed to place France without question at the head of the political\r\nworld. She had sundered the Empire of her rival, and with ordinary\r\nwisdom she might hope to keep the lead as a commercial and colonizing\r\npower. Strong in the alliance of Austria and Spain, with her friendship\r\ncourted by the United States, Prussia, Sweden, and Holland--at times\r\nby the Czarina Catharine--France seemed to be high above the reach of\r\nadverse fortune. The prestige of the monarchy was as yet undimmed by\r\nthe affair of the Diamond Necklace. The factious opposition of the\r\nParlements had scarcely begun; and the days of hunting and festivity\r\nat Fontainebleau must have realized those visions of charm and beauty\r\nin which Burke has enshrined Marie Antoinette, “glittering like the\r\nmorning star, full of life and splendour and joy.”\r\n\r\nBy her side at Court and in the hunting field was that strange\r\nopposite, her husband. What the friends thought of Louis XVI in\r\nhunting attire is shown by Wilberforce’s note--“clumsy strange figure\r\nin immense boots.” Whether the King spoke to them is doubtful, for\r\nhis words were ever few, and etiquette forbade his conversing much\r\nwith foreigners.[174] But the Queen, with her usual vivacity and wit,\r\nrallied them upon their friend, the grocer, at Reims. The courtiers\r\noften crowded round Pitt (so Wilberforce recalls), “and he behaved\r\nwith great spirit, though he was sometimes a little bored when they\r\ntalked to him about Parliamentary Reform.” At Fontainebleau Pitt met\r\nLafayette at dinner in company with the American Minister, Franklin.\r\nAgain we long to know of the converse of these representative men. Only\r\none scrap survives, namely, that Pitt informed the Frenchman, whom his\r\nadmirers termed “the hero of both worlds,” that his principles were too\r\ndemocratic for him.[175] When the tempest burst upon Western Europe,\r\nthis soon became apparent.\r\n\r\nNecker, the Minister who in 1789 aspired to ride on the winds and\r\ncontrol the storm, was desirous of allying his family with that of\r\nPitt. The ex-Controller-General of French Finances and his ambitious\r\nconsort sought to strengthen their claims on the Government for a\r\nreturn to office, by an alliance with a powerful family. What alliance\r\ncould be so brilliant for these Genevese Protestants as with the son\r\nof Chatham? We now know for certain that Necker and his wife urgently\r\nwished for this union; for a year later the mother, when seriously ill,\r\nwrote to her daughter (the future Mme. de Staël) in these terms:\r\n\r\n    I did desire that you should marry Mr. Pitt. I wished to confide\r\n    you to the care of a husband who had made for himself a great\r\n    name; I also could have wished for a son-in-law to whose care I\r\n    could commend your poor father, and who would feel the full weight\r\n    of his charge. You were not disposed to give me this satisfaction.\r\n    Well! All is now forgiven.[176]\r\n\r\nClearly the match was to have been of an eleemosynary character; and\r\nall who rejoice in the eager exuberance of the life of Mme. de Staël\r\ncannot be surprised at her refusal, even when a young girl, to become\r\na testamentary asset in the life of her father. Whether her repugnance\r\nat the idea was further increased by seeing Pitt in one of his “bored”\r\nmoods, we do not know. Indeed it is uncertain whether they ever met. If\r\nwe may judge from the sketch of Pitt written by Wilberforce in 1821,\r\nthe affair was mooted in the frigid bargaining manner usual with French\r\nparents. Horace Walpole, a close friend of M. Necker, remarked to Lord\r\nCamden, who thereupon passed it on to Pitt, that the Neckers had so\r\nmuch respect for him that, if he claimed the hand of their daughter,\r\nhe would not be refused--by the parents. What would have happened when\r\nMlle. Necker came to be asked must be left to the imagination.[177]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the charms of the French Court and the meshes of matrimonial\r\nschemes Pitt was suddenly called away. A special messenger bade him\r\nreturn at once to London. What he had all along hoped now came to\r\npass. The King’s dislike of his Ministers had overcome all other\r\nfeelings, and he now appealed to Pitt to free him from the toils of\r\nthe Coalition. The friends spent twenty-four hours in a carriage, then\r\nsuffered the usual miseries of a Channel passage, and reached London on\r\n24th October.\r\n\r\nThe situation was serious. Though delivered from fear of war, the\r\ncountry was beset by many perils. Consols were on the decline.\r\nThe state of Ireland was alarming. The Associations of Volunteers\r\novershadowed the Government at Dublin, and seemed about to dictate\r\nterms to that at Westminster. Their attitude aroused keen resentment,\r\nseeing that the legislative independence of Ireland had been proclaimed\r\nto be the cure for all her evils. “What! (exclaimed Horace Walpole)\r\nWould they throw off our Parliament and yet amend it.” Worst of all,\r\nperhaps, was the almost complete indifference of Britons to the\r\npolitical situation. The same rather cynical observer had already noted\r\nthat no one, except interested politicians, really cared who was in, or\r\nout of, office. His words deserve quotation:\r\n\r\n    Our levity is unlike that of the French. They turn everything into\r\n    a jest, an epigram, or a ballad. We are not pleasant but violent,\r\n    and yet remember nothing for a moment. This was not our character\r\n    formerly.... Can the people be much attached to any man if they\r\n    think well of none? Can they hate any man superlatively if they\r\n    think ill of all? In my own opinion we have no positive character\r\n    at present at all. We are not so bad as most great nations\r\n    have been when sinking. We have no excessive vices, no raging\r\n    animosities.[178]\r\n\r\nThe passage is interesting in more ways than one. Milton dubbed us\r\nfickle and alleged our insular situation as the cause.[179] Addison\r\nin one of his essays repeated the charge, which was perfectly natural\r\nearly in the eighteenth century. Further, Horace Walpole’s criticism is\r\nremarkable as that of a shrewd observer during what he termed a time\r\nof “comfortable calm.” He saw the two leading nations, as it were,\r\ndrifting sluggishly in a Sargasso Sea of politics after one storm;\r\nand they and he never suspected the approach of a far more terrible\r\ntempest. Neither in London nor Paris had any inspiring personality come\r\nto the front. Pitt had not fully emerged. Robespierre was intent on\r\nhis briefs at Arras; the Corsican, who was to quicken the pulse of all\r\npeoples, still studied under the monks of Brienne; and Horace Walpole\r\ncould therefore complain of the pettiness of politics, the aimless\r\nbrawlings of Westminster, the lighter vagaries of Versailles, and the\r\ndullness of the world.\r\n\r\nAt London all was soon to change. Though Fox and North kept their\r\nmajority solid on the question of the peace, yet they came to grief\r\nover a measure of almost equal importance. On 18th November, amidst\r\nscenes of unequalled excitement, Fox brought forward his India Bill;\r\nand on a question where vast patronage was at stake passions rose\r\nto fever heat. Indian affairs will be treated more fully in another\r\nchapter; and it must suffice to state here that the East India\r\nCompany was in a deplorable condition, mainly owing to the war with\r\nHyder Ali and the insubordination and rapacity of the Company’s\r\nservants, which led to abuses degrading to Britain and oppressive to\r\nthe natives of India. According to the terms of North’s Regulating\r\nAct of 1773, Parliament had the right of intervention in all matters\r\nof high policy; but in one important question the Company had set its\r\nbehests at naught. In April 1782 a vote of censure was passed on the\r\nGovernor-General, Warren Hastings, and the Company was requested to\r\nrecall him. The Court of Directors issued an order to this effect; but\r\nthe Court of Proprietors reversed their decision, and Hastings was left\r\nin a position ambiguous and irritating to all parties. Consequently\r\ndictates of policy and the interests of the nation compelled Parliament\r\nto assert its paramount authority.\r\n\r\nBut the manner of the intervention and the act itself were alike\r\nextraordinary. The new India Bill was the joint work of Fox and Burke\r\nwith some aid from the law-officers of the Crown. It has often been\r\nsaid, on the scantiest of evidence, to have been framed mainly by\r\nBurke; but the clauses which abrograted the Charter of the East India\r\nCompany and vested the control of Indian affairs chiefly in Parliament,\r\nbear the imprint of the mind of Fox rather than of the more cautious\r\nand conservative statesman.[180] In strict propriety the measure\r\nought to have originated with Lord North. He privately expressed his\r\napproval, and then, alleging indisposition, stayed away from Parliament\r\non the day of its introduction.[181]\r\n\r\nFox opened his case in a speech of great power. He dilated on the\r\nills resulting from the disorders in the Company’s service, and, in\r\nparticular, from the ambition of Warren Hastings. He then showed the\r\ntendency of the parliamentary reports on Indian affairs, and claimed\r\nthat, in the virtual bankruptcy of the Company (which could not\r\ndischarge its debts to the Crown), Parliament had the right to take the\r\nsupreme control of its territories. We may pause here to notice that\r\nthe Directors of the Company stoutly denied the assertion as to their\r\nbankruptcy, and claimed that, when its expenses were reduced to a peace\r\nfooting, the Company’s creditors would be in a better position than\r\nany creditors in Europe.[182] Their printed report of 23rd January\r\n1784 laid stress on the heavy charge involved by conquests in India\r\n“which the wisdom of the nation has given up for equivalents in other\r\nparts of the world.” It also claimed the payment of £260,687, the\r\ncharge incurred by the Company for the maintenance of French prisoners\r\nin the Seven Years’ War. The Directors further stated that, if\r\nGovernment would check the very extensive smuggling in tea (an article\r\nwhich formed the most valuable of the monopolies of the Company),\r\nmore than double the amount would be sold by legitimate means. These\r\nfacts should be borne in mind, as the Company succeeded in spreading a\r\nconviction that the attack of Fox was unjust.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of his speech Fox detailed his proposals for effecting\r\ndrastic changes in India, and explained the reasons for separating\r\nadministrative affairs from purely mercantile affairs. Many authorities\r\nclaimed that the territories of the Company belonged in reality to the\r\nCrown; others denied this claim. On one point all must agree, that the\r\nCrown could not possibly deal with “a remote and difficult trade.”\r\nAccordingly he sought to form “a mixed system of government, adapted\r\nto the mixed complexion of our interests in India.” For administrative\r\nwork he proposed to establish a Board of seven commissioners, nominated\r\nby Parliament, for three or five years--four years was the term\r\nfinally suggested--having full power to appoint and dismiss officers\r\nin India, and complete control over its government. The Board was to\r\nsit in London, “under the very eye of Parliament,” and the minutes\r\nof its meetings were to be open to inspection by Parliament. If this\r\nexperiment succeeded, he proposed that in future the King should\r\nnominate the seven commissioners, and he was to fill up vacancies that\r\nmight occur in the meantime. As for the mercantile interests of the\r\nCompany, they were to be managed by a subordinate Board or Council,\r\nconsisting of eight members chosen by Parliament from among the larger\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nHe further proposed to remedy the worst abuses in India in a second\r\nBill which would abolish the holding of monopolies, such as that for\r\nopium, which had been jobbed away to the son of a former chairman of\r\nthe Company. Security of tenure would be granted to the Zamindars, or\r\nnative landlords, and the acceptance of presents by the Company’s\r\nservants in India--a fertile source of corruption and oppression--would\r\nbe strictly forbidden. Fox admitted that the private influence of the\r\nCrown, even in its worst days, was nothing compared with that of the\r\nEast India Company, and wisely abstained for the present from naming\r\nthe seven commissioners whom he proposed to appoint.[183]\r\n\r\nHere was the weak point of an otherwise excellent measure; and Pitt,\r\ntowards whom all eyes were directed, fastened upon it. While admitting\r\nthe urgent need of reform, he deprecated the abrogation of all the\r\ncharters and privileges of an ancient Company under the plea of\r\nnecessity. “Is not necessity,” he said, “the plea of every illegal\r\nexertion of power? Is not necessity the pretence of every usurpation?\r\nNecessity is the argument of tyrants: it is the creed of slaves.”\r\nFurther, what evils must result if that formidable political weapon,\r\nthe patronage of the Company, were transferred to the Ministers then in\r\npower, and finally to the Crown? On the one side it would tend to the\r\ngrossest corruption, on the other, to despotism.[184]\r\n\r\nPitt, it will be seen, opposed the measure owing to the indirect but\r\ninevitable consequences which it would entail in the vitiated state of\r\naffairs then existing in Parliament, where an unwholesome Coalition\r\nheld together only with the aim of enjoying the spoils of office and\r\neven richer booty in the future.[185] The possession of the enormous\r\npatronage of the India Company opened up golden vistas that fired the\r\nimaginations even of the dull squires who trooped after Lord North. As\r\nfor the far livelier followers of Fox, they were jubilant at prospects\r\nwhich promised not only places in the East, but a long lease of power\r\nat St. Stephen’s. Their opponents were alike depressed and indignant.\r\nA former friend of Fox, Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, commented on the\r\n“spirit of ambition, rapacity and confiscation” that characterized his\r\nproposals; and the bad impression caused by the patronage section of\r\nhis Bill was intensified when it appeared that four of the seven new\r\ncommissioners were to be declared Foxites, better known at Brooks’s\r\nClub than at the India House, namely, Lord Fitzwilliam, Frederick\r\nMontagu, Sir Henry Fletcher, and Robert Gregory. In Lord North’s\r\ninterest there were his son, Colonel North, Viscount Lewisham, and Sir\r\nGilbert Elliot.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of seven pronounced partisans to these posts of\r\nalmost unbounded responsibility wrecked the measure. In itself the\r\nBill contained many excellent features. The transference of governing\r\npower from the Company to Parliament in conjunction with the Crown,\r\non terms ultimately favourable to the latter, was a bold step; but\r\nmuch could be said for it, and Pitt certainly overshot the limits of\r\nfair criticism in his first speech. If Fox and North had chosen the\r\nseven commissioners fairly from among all three parties, the mouths\r\nof gainsayers would have been stopped. Now, however, the partisan\r\ncorollary to the measure justified the most vehement strictures. A\r\nflood of satire was poured on the Bill. Two caricatures in particular\r\nhad a very wide circulation, probably at the expense of the threatened\r\nCompany. One represented Fox as Samson carrying off the ruins of the\r\nEast India House; the second, by Sayer, who soon became Pitt’s man and\r\nreceived a small post from him, showed Fox as Carlo Khan riding into\r\nDelhi on an elephant having the face of Lord North, and preceded by\r\nBurke as trumpeter.\r\n\r\nPitt wrote privately to the Governor of the Company suggesting that\r\nits prestige would be enhanced if a meeting of its creditors could be\r\narranged and a declaration could be procured that they would allow\r\nample time for the discharge of their claims.[186] But caricatures,\r\nsuggestions, and petitions were needless. The same facts which\r\ndiscredited the Bill in the country whetted the eagerness of the\r\nministerial majority in Parliament. At the second reading Pitt briskly\r\nrenewed his attacks; and he now had the support of William Grenville in\r\na statesmanlike speech, which lacked “the commanding tone, the majesty,\r\nand all the captivating rotundity and splendour of Pitt’s eloquence,”\r\nbut equalled it in argumentative power.[187] Dundas, Jenkinson, and\r\nScott (the future Lord Eldon), reinforced the assault: but all was in\r\nvain. Burke, in a majestic oration, proclaimed that the Bill would\r\nsave India from manifold evils which he depicted with righteous\r\nindignation.[188] But material interests told more than eloquence and\r\nmorality. The influence of Ministers and the hopes of their followers\r\nensured the speedy passing of this complex and far-reaching measure\r\nthrough the Commons by a final majority of 208 votes to 102 (3rd\r\nDecember).\r\n\r\nThis was a heavy blow to the Opposition, especially to Pitt, who had\r\nsaid that he would fight the whole Bill, clause by clause. Horace\r\nWalpole wrote two days later that Pitt had slunk from the contest,\r\nbut that the check would do him good, dazzled as he had been by his\r\npremature fame. Walpole also remarked that, while excelling Chatham in\r\nlogical power, the son had much less firmness and perseverance. Readers\r\nof those charming letters will note with some amusement that in the\r\nmiddle of the next month, Walpole wrote that nothing but obstinacy\r\nprevented Pitt resigning his post as Prime Minister. After that Walpole\r\ngave up the rôle of political prophet.\r\n\r\nFor now there occurred a series of events which taught modesty to\r\nwiseacres. The King intervened in a surprising manner. In the House of\r\nLords influence from above was suddenly pitted against the interests of\r\nthe nether world. George III had long been awaiting a fit opportunity\r\nfor tripping up the hated Ministry. A few weeks before, he had covered\r\nFox and North with ridicule in front of the whole Court. Acting on\r\nthe first rumour of the death of Sir Eyre Coote in India, they had\r\nproffered a request that his ribbon of the Order of the Bath should go\r\nto a friend, and believed that they had secured the granted assent of\r\nthe Sovereign. The aspirant therefore appeared at the next levée at St.\r\nJames’s Palace with the officers of the Order; but the King, affecting\r\ngreat surprise at the unseemly haste of his ministers in acting on\r\nunofficial information, refused to confer the ribbon, repulsed their\r\nentreaties, and postponed the ceremony.[189]\r\n\r\nGeorge was now to taste the sweets of revenge in a matter more than\r\nceremonial. His coadjutor was Earl Temple, who had advised him to wait\r\nuntil the times were ripe; and from a MS. preserved at Chevening we\r\nlearn that the King hastily sent for the Earl on the night of 11th\r\nDecember. Thurlow also had an interview with him and pointed out in\r\nunmeasured terms the humiliations which he would suffer from Fox’s\r\nIndia Bill, namely, that it would transfer to the present Ministers\r\n“more than half the royal power.” Always jealous of his patronage, the\r\nKing at once determined to ward off so insidious an attack. But he and\r\nhis advisers acted with characteristic caution. They considered--and\r\nthis is an interesting point in our constitutional history--that the\r\nexercise of the royal veto on the Bill, if it should pass both Houses,\r\nwould be a “violent” step.[190] They preferred to act secretly and\r\nindirectly through the Lords.\r\n\r\nIn order to exert pressure in the most drastic way possible, a card was\r\nwritten (probably in the King’s hand) stating “That His Majesty allowed\r\nEarl Temple to say that whoever voted for the India Bill was not only\r\nnot his friend, but would be considered by him as an enemy; and if\r\nthese words were not strong enough, Earl Temple might use whatever\r\nwords he might deem stronger and more to the purpose.”[191] Armed with\r\nthis card, Temple set to work to whittle down the Fox-North majority.\r\nHis success was startling and complete. The golden glint of the spoils\r\nof the Indies paled under the thunder-cloud of the royal displeasure.\r\nThe fear of losing all chance of advancement at home, whether titular\r\nor material, sent place-hunters and trimmers trooping over to the\r\nOpposition; and a measure, the success of which seemed assured, was\r\nthrown out on 17th December by a majority of nineteen. On the next day\r\nthe King ordered Lord North and Fox to send in their Seals of office by\r\ntheir Under-Secretaries, “as a personal interview on the occasion would\r\nbe disagreeable to him.” He entrusted the Seals at once to Temple, who\r\non the day following signified to the other Ministers their dismissal\r\nfrom office. On the same day, 19th December, the King sent for Pitt\r\nand appointed him First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus it was that Pitt became Prime Minister before he attained his\r\ntwenty-fifth year. His acceptance of office after the recent use of\r\nthe royal prerogative is an action that stands in need of defence.\r\nThere can be no doubt that George III abused his power by seeking in\r\nan underhand way to influence the votes of the Peers. The assertion\r\nof Earl Stanhope that his action did not involve the infraction of\r\nany specific rule of the constitution will not pass muster. As was\r\nably pointed out in the debate in the Commons on 17th December, the\r\nthree parts of the constitution, King, Lords, and Commons, exist\r\nindependently; and, just as the interference of one branch of the\r\nLegislature in the debates and actions of the other is most properly\r\nresented, so too the intervention of the Crown during the debates\r\nis undoubtedly an infraction of the liberties of Parliament. While\r\nnot forbidden by any specific rule of the constitution, such action\r\ncontravenes the spirit of the ninth clause of the Bill of Rights, which\r\nstipulates for complete freedom of debate and speech in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Pitt towards this question during the debate of 17th\r\nDecember in the Commons is noteworthy. He did not attempt to defend\r\nsuch a use of the royal prerogative as was then first reported: he\r\nasserted, no doubt with perfect sincerity, that the report was an idle\r\nrumour, of which the House could take no cognizance. The House did not\r\nshare his opinion. Swayed by a vehement speech of Fox, who declaimed\r\nagainst the “infernal spirit of intrigue” ever present in the King’s\r\ncounsels, and charged Pitt with an underhand attempt to gain power,\r\nmembers decided by a majority of nearly two to one that to report the\r\nopinion, or pretended opinion, of the King on any Bill under discussion\r\nin Parliament, was a high crime and misdemeanour, subversive of the\r\nconstitution.[192]\r\n\r\nIt was in face of these resolutions that Pitt, on 19th December, took\r\noffice. If he looked solely to Parliament, his position was hopeless.\r\nConfronting him was a hostile majority, smarting under a great\r\ndisappointment, and threatening him, and still more his relative, Earl\r\nTemple, with the penalties of the constitution. On hearing the news\r\nof his acceptance of office, the members of the Coalition burst into\r\nloud laughter, and gleefully trooped over to the Opposition benches.\r\nScarcely could they conceal their mirth during the ensuing debates;\r\nand on 22nd December the House resolved itself into a Committee to\r\nconsider the state of the nation. Certainly Pitt’s position was trying\r\nenough; for his triumph seemed to be the result of a backstairs\r\nintrigue, unworthy of the son of Chatham, and fatal to the influence\r\nof Parliament. He figured as the King’s Minister, carried to office by\r\nthe votes of nineteen Peers, against the will of the Commons. One can\r\ntherefore understand the persistence of the Whig tradition, in which\r\nhis action appeared the great betrayal of the liberties of Parliament.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we carry the question to the highest Court of Appeal,\r\nthe action of Pitt is justifiable. The prerogatives of Parliament\r\nare subservient to the interests of the nation. And when the majority\r\nof the House of Commons acts in a way strongly reprobated by public\r\nopinion, its authority undergoes an immediate eclipse. In a not\r\ndissimilar case, Chatham dared to appeal from a discredited House to\r\nthe people at large; and his son was justified in taking a step which\r\ninvolved a reference to the people’s will at the first favourable\r\nopportunity. Pitt always looked on the Coalition as an unprincipled\r\nintrigue, in which the forms of the constitution were used in order to\r\nviolate its spirit. He knew that the country condemned what Romilly\r\ntermed “that scandalous alliance.” The original crime of the Coalition\r\nseemed more than ever heinous when Ministers appointed solely their own\r\nnominees to regulate Indian affairs. This very fact damned the India\r\nBill in the eyes of the public, which cared not a jot for parliamentary\r\nmajorities held together by hopes of booty. Men who had formerly\r\ninveighed against George III now began to revise their judgements and\r\nto pronounce even his last device justifiable when directed against\r\nMinisters who were about to perpetrate the most gigantic job of the\r\ncentury. In looking away from the votes of a corrupt Parliament to the\r\nwill of the nation, Pitt was but following in the footsteps of his\r\nfather, who had more than once made a similar appeal, and never in vain.\r\n\r\nFinally we must remember that Pitt did not take office as a “King’s\r\nFriend.” He had consistently refused to bind himself down to the\r\nconditions which George III sought to impose. The King knew full well\r\nthat he had to deal with a man of sternly independent nature. He had\r\nfailed to bend Pitt’s will in the summer, when conditions favoured his\r\nown “cause.” Now, when he was accused of violating the constitution,\r\nand a hostile majority in the Commons held most threatening language,\r\nhe could not but uphold a Minister who stood forth in his defence. If\r\nin July Pitt refused to bow before the royal behests, surely he might\r\nexpect to dictate his own terms in December. The King’s difficulty\r\nwas Pitt’s opportunity; and, as events were to prove, George III had,\r\nat least for a time, to give up his attempts at personal rule and to\r\nacquiesce in the rule of a Prime Minister who gave unity and strength\r\nto the administration. While freeing himself from the loathed yoke of\r\nthe Whig oligarchy, the King unwittingly accepted the control of a man\r\nwho personified the nation.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the events of 17th-22nd December 1783 can scarcely be\r\noverrated. In a personal sense they exerted an incalculable influence\r\non the fortunes of George III, Pitt, Fox, Burke, and many lesser men.\r\nIn constitutional history, as will afterwards appear, they brought\r\nabout the development of the Cabinet and the reconstruction of the\r\ntwo chief political parties in their modern forms. The happy ending\r\nof the crisis enabled the ship of State to reach smoother waters and\r\nmake harbour, though many of her crew and all foreign beholders looked\r\non her as wellnigh a castaway. All this, and more, depended on Pitt’s\r\naction in those days. He knew the serious nature of the emergency; and\r\nat such a time it behoves the one able steersman to take the helm,\r\nregardless of all cries as to his youth and his forwardness. Pitt had\r\nthe proud confidence of Chatham, that he and he alone could save the\r\nkingdom, and the verdict of mankind has applauded the resolve of the\r\nfather in the crisis of 1756, and the determination of his youthful son\r\nin the equally dark days at the close of 1783. Conduct, which in a weak\r\nand pliable man would have been a crime, is one of the many titles to\r\nfame of William Pitt the Younger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE WITH FOX\r\n\r\n                          Let me lament,\r\n  With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,\r\n  That thou, my brother, my competitor\r\n  In top of all design, my mate in empire,\r\n  Friend and companion in the front of war,\r\n  The arm of mine own body, and the heart\r\n  Where mine his thoughts did kindle--that our stars,\r\n  Unreconciliable, should divide\r\n  Our equalness to this.\r\n\r\n                      SHAKESPEARE, _Antony and Cleopatra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty which confronted the young Prime Minister was of\r\na personal nature. On or about 23rd December, his cousin, Earl Temple,\r\nthrew up the Seals and forthwith retired to his domain of Stowe in\r\nBuckinghamshire. This event seemed to presage the death of the infant\r\nadministration, which the action of the Earl had largely helped to\r\ncall to being. So assured was Fox of victory that he ascribed Temple’s\r\nresignation to cowardice, and expressed regret at it because the\r\ninevitable fall of the new Ministry would be explained away by the\r\naction of the Earl.[193] Undoubtedly it was a severe blow to Pitt.\r\nBishop Tomline states that, on visiting him early on the next morning,\r\nhe found he had not had a moment’s sleep, an occurrence without\r\nparallel in time of health.[194] For Pitt, like Napoleon, Wellington,\r\nand other hard workers, enjoyed the priceless boon of sound and restful\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for Temple’s retirement cannot fully be fathomed owing to\r\nthe loss of his letters in these important weeks; but we know from the\r\nBuckingham Papers that he was disgusted with political life and had\r\nclaimed the award of some honour as a sign of the King’s approval of\r\nhis services in Ireland, after his abrupt dismissal by Fox and North.\r\nThe proud and sensitive nobleman doubtless entered into the plan for\r\nthe overthrow of those enemies, in the hope of benefiting the State and\r\nsetting the crown on his own career. Rumour had already assigned to him\r\nthe Dukedom of Buckingham, and in this case that lying jade truthfully\r\nvoiced his desires.[195]\r\n\r\nThe prominent part which he had played in the late intrigue doubtless\r\nled him to insist on some high honour. As to the nature of the claim\r\nand its reception by Pitt we know nothing; for he loyally maintained\r\nsilence as to the cause of the rupture; but the Earl’s letter of 29th\r\nDecember to Pitt breathes suppressed resentment in every line. It is\r\nthe peevish outpouring of a disappointed man, who saw his _protégés_ in\r\nIreland neglected, and his own wishes slighted.[196]\r\n\r\nThe question arises--why did not Pitt press the claims of his cousin?\r\nHis services in Ireland had been valuable; and to him the Prime\r\nMinister very largely owed his present position. The answer would seem\r\nto be that Pitt soon found out the truth as to his objectionable use of\r\nthe King’s name. At first he rejected the rumour to that effect, and\r\nit is consonant with his character to suppose that, after probing the\r\nmatter to the bottom, he declined to press on the King Earl Temple’s\r\nclaims. The rupture was sharp and sudden. It is even possible that high\r\nwords passed between them. In any case, it is certain that Pitt did not\r\nraise the question of a reward for the Earl’s services until ten months\r\nlater. Good taste may also have determined his conduct in this matter.\r\nHow could he at once confer a high dignity on the very man whose\r\npolitic whisperings had helped to raise him to power? Time must elapse\r\nbefore Temple could gain the reward for his services in Ireland; and\r\nit was not until early in October 1784 that Pitt mooted the question\r\nof the Marquisate of Buckingham or the Order of the Garter.[197]\r\nThe following new letter from Pitt to his cousin, preserved in the\r\nChevening archives, contains the official notification of the former\r\nof these honours.\r\n\r\n                                              Downing St.\r\n                                                    _Nov. 23, 1784._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n    Your Lordship will receive from Lord Sydney the official\r\n    notification of His Majesty’s having given orders for preparing\r\n    a Patent giving your Lordship the rank of Marquis. In addition\r\n    to this mark of His Majesty’s favour, I have great satisfaction\r\n    in being authorized to assure your Lordship that, if His Majesty\r\n    should depart from His present determination, of not giving the\r\n    rank of Duke out of His Royal Family, it is His gracious intention\r\n    to include your Lordship in any such promotion. I need not add how\r\n    happy I am in obeying H.M.’s commands on this occasion, nor how\r\n    truly I am at all times,\r\n\r\n                            My dear Lord,\r\n                    Your most affectionate and faithful servant,\r\n                                                            W. PITT.\r\n\r\nTurning from this personal matter, which brought friction for a\r\ntime between the Pitt and Grenville families, we notice other\r\ndifficulties confronting the young Premier, which might have daunted an\r\nexperienced statesman. The frivolous looked on with amusement at his\r\nefforts.--“Well, Mr. Pitt may do what he likes during the holidays;\r\nbut it will only be a mince-pie administration, depend upon it.” So\r\nspake that truest of true blues, Mrs. Crewe, to Wilberforce on 22nd\r\nDecember; and she voiced the general opinion. Yet Pitt never faltered.\r\nOn the next day Wilberforce noted in his journal: “Pitt nobly firm.\r\nEvening [at] Pitt’s. Cabinet formed.” On one topic alone did the young\r\nchief show any anxiety. “What am I to do,” he asked, “if they stop the\r\nsupplies?” “They will not stop them,” replied his brother-in-law, Lord\r\nMahon, “it is the very thing they will not venture to do.”[198] The\r\nsurmise of this vivacious young nobleman (afterwards Earl Stanhope) was\r\nfor a time correct; but Pitt had rightly foreseen the chief difficulty\r\nin his path. For the present, on the receipt of a message from the\r\nKing that no dissolution or prorogation would take place, Parliament\r\nseparated quietly for the vacation (26th December).\r\n\r\nFor Pitt that Christmastide brought little but disappointment and\r\nanxiety. His cares were not lessened by the conduct which he found it\r\ndesirable to pursue towards the Earl of Shelburne, long the official\r\nleader of the Chathamites. He did not include him in his Ministry,\r\npartly, perhaps, from a feeling of delicacy at asking his former chief\r\nto serve under him, but mainly from a conviction that his unpopularity\r\nwould needlessly burden the labouring ship of State. To Orde he\r\nexpressed his deep obligations to the Earl, but lamented his inability\r\nto leave out of count “the absolute influence of prejudice” against\r\nhim. He did not even consult Shelburne as to the choice of coadjutors;\r\nand the Earl let it be known that he would have no connection with\r\nthe new men, “lest he should injure them.”[199] Pitt also sustained\r\nseveral direct rebuffs. Though, on 19th December, he sent an obsequious\r\nrequest to the Duke of Grafton to strengthen his hands by accepting\r\nthe Privy Seal, that nobleman declined.[200] Camden was equally coy;\r\nand, strangest of all, his own brother-in-law, Mahon, would not come\r\nforward. We can detect a note of anxiety in the following letter of\r\nPitt to Lord Sackville, formerly Germain, which I have discovered in\r\nthe Pitt Papers (No. 102):\r\n\r\n                                                    _Dec. 29, 1783._\r\n\r\n    MY LORD,\r\n\r\n    In the arduous situation in which His Majesty has condescended to\r\n    command my services at this important juncture, I am necessarily\r\n    anxious to obtain the honor of a support and assistance so\r\n    important as your Lordship’s. I flatter myself Mr. Herbert will\r\n    have had the goodness to express my sense of the honor your\r\n    Lordship did me by your obliging expressions towards me. Permit\r\n    me to add how much mortification I received in being disappointed\r\n    of his assistance at the Board of the Admiralty, which I took the\r\n    liberty of proposing to him, in consequence of the conversation\r\n    Lord Temple had had with your Lordship. I should sincerely lament\r\n    if any change of arrangements produced by Lord Temple’s resignation\r\n    should deprive the King and country in any degree of a support\r\n    which the present crisis renders so highly material to both. If\r\n    your Lordship would still allow us to hope that you might be\r\n    induced to mark by Mr. Herbert’s acceptance your disposition in\r\n    favour of the King’s Government, the opening may be made with the\r\n    greatest ease at any moment, and Your Lordship’s commands on the\r\n    subject would give me particular satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFrom Wraxall’s Memoirs[201] we learn that the writer undertook to pave\r\nthe way for the receipt of Pitt’s letter; but all was in vain. Lord\r\nSackville refused to take office, though he promised a general support.\r\n\r\nThe most serious refusal was that of the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland\r\nby Earl Cornwallis. George III highly approved of Pitt’s proposal\r\nof that nobleman, whose tact and forbearance would have proved of\r\ninfinite service in so troublous a time.[202] Who knows whether the\r\nrebellion and savage reprisals of 1798 might not have been averted\r\nby the adoption of wiser methods at Dublin Castle in the eighties?\r\nAs it was, the most difficult administrative duty in the Empire was\r\nsoon to devolve upon a young nobleman, the Duke of Rutland, whose\r\nchief qualifications seem to have been his showy parts, his splendid\r\nhospitality, and his early patronage of Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet as finally formed comprised the following seven members:\r\nPitt, First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer;\r\nthe Marquis of Carmarthen (son of the Duke of Leeds), an amiable\r\nbut unenterprising Secretary for Foreign Affairs; Lord Sydney (T.\r\nTownshend), Home Secretary; Earl Gower, President of the Council (up to\r\nDecember 1784, when Earl Camden succeeded him); the Duke of Rutland,\r\nLord Privy Seal (up to November 1784, when Earl Gower succeeded him,\r\nthe Duke taking the Viceroyalty of Ireland); Lord Howe, First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty; Lord Thurlow, Lord Chancellor. In debating power this\r\nCabinet was deficient. Apart from Pitt and Thurlow, not one of the\r\nMinisters could make a tolerable speech, or possessed the strength of\r\ncharacter which makes up for oratorical deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThurlow might have been a tower of strength in the Lords, but for his\r\nduplicity, bad temper, and domineering ways. For the present, Pitt had\r\nto put up with him as a disagreeable necessity. There was something\r\nso threatening in his aspect as to elicit Thelwall’s picturesque\r\ndescription of him as a man with the Norman Conquest in his eyebrow\r\nand the Feudal System in every feature of his face. Add to these\r\nformidable gifts a sonorous voice, his powers of crushing retort, above\r\nall, his secret connection with George III, and his influence in the\r\nUpper House can be imagined. Yet his reputation rested on a slight\r\nbasis; his knowledge of law was narrow, his culture slight, and his\r\nprivate character contemptible. He was known to bully his mistress and\r\nhis illegitimate daughters, just as he browbeat juries and Whigs.[203]\r\nOn the whole his reputation is hard to explain save on the ground that\r\nthe majority of mankind is apt to be imposed on by externals, and is\r\ntoo uncritical or too lazy to sound the depths of character.\r\n\r\nFor the present Pitt tolerated Thurlow just as the commander of an\r\nuntried warship might tolerate the presence of an imposing gun of\r\nuncertain power, in the midst of light weapons. The boom of his voice\r\nwas worth something to a Ministry in which the posts not of Cabinet\r\nrank were filled as follows: The Duke of Richmond, Master-General\r\nof the Ordnance;[204] Kenyon, Attorney-General; Pepper Arden,\r\nSolicitor-General; William Grenville (afterwards Lord Grenville) and\r\nLord Mulgrave, joint Paymasters of the Forces; Henry Dundas (afterwards\r\nLord Melville), Treasurer of the Navy; Sir George Yonge, Secretary at\r\nWar; George Rose and Thomas Steele, Secretaries of the Treasury; Thomas\r\nOrde, Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Of these the Duke\r\nof Richmond had great private influence, but was personally unpopular.\r\nGrenville and Rose were useful, hard-working men, but uninteresting\r\nin personality and speech. Their characters and that of Dundas will\r\nconcern us in Chapter XII. Here we may note that the bold and jovial\r\nnature of Dundas made him popular as a man; but his defection from\r\nLord North, and his capacity for intrigue impaired his influence in\r\nthe House. Nevertheless his fighting powers, his legal training, his\r\nknowledge of men and affairs, and his skill in parrying the blows\r\nof the Opposition made him an effective lieutenant in the House. By\r\ndegrees, as we shall see, he acquired great influence over Pitt; and\r\nafter his entry to the Cabinet as Home Secretary in 1791, he, together\r\nwith Grenville, came to form around Pitt what may almost be termed\r\nan inner Cabinet. For the present, however, the distrust with which\r\nthe “Caledonian thane” was regarded permitted him to be no more than\r\nthe chief among Pitt’s subordinates; and the ingenious poetaster of\r\nthe “Rolliad” maliciously aimed these lines at his weakest point, his\r\ninconsistency:\r\n\r\n  His ready tongue with sophistries at will\r\n  Can say, unsay, and be consistent still;\r\n  This day can censure, and the next retract,\r\n  In speech extol, and stigmatize in act.\r\n\r\nThe other subordinates claim only the briefest notice. Sir George\r\nYonge was a nonentity, under whom the British army sank to the nadir\r\nof efficiency. Kenyon and Pepper Arden were very young men; the latter\r\nwas one of Pitt’s Cambridge friends, lively and amiable, but having\r\nlittle influence in debate. The House could not take Pepper seriously.\r\nOn the whole the Ministry aroused little confidence among friends and\r\nmuch derision among opponents. The general opinion was expressed by Sir\r\nGilbert Elliot (first Earl of Minto) that Pitt’s colleagues were “a set\r\nof children playing at Ministers, and must be sent back to school, and\r\nin a few days all will have returned to its former course.”[205] On the\r\nother hand Daniel Pulteney, writing to the Duke of Rutland, said that\r\npeople approved the appointments and were glad that Pitt, in showing\r\nattention to existing interests, proved himself to be not “too virtuous\r\nand speculative for a Minister.”[206]\r\n\r\nSuch were the predictions concerning a premiership which was to last\r\nnearly eighteen years. In one respect the mediocrity of his colleagues\r\nmade Pitt’s task easier. His commanding temper would never have brooked\r\nthe superior airs of the earls, Temple and Shelburne. From the outset\r\nhe could carry out his plan of moulding the Cabinet to his will and\r\nenforcing its discipline, without hindrance except from Thurlow;\r\nand the final ejection of that cross-grained egoist marked not only\r\nthe triumph of Pitt, but also the consolidation of the Cabinet in\r\nwhat seems to be its permanent form, a body moulded by, and largely\r\nresponsible to, the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAll this was hidden from the gaze of the most discerning amidst the\r\ngloom and uncertainties of the first days of the year 1784. Shortly\r\nbefore Parliament re-assembled events occurred which helped to\r\nstrengthen a confessedly weak administration. At the request of Pitt,\r\nGeorge III created four new peerages. Thomas Pitt received the title of\r\nLord Camelford; Edward Eliot (father of Pitt’s brother-in-law) became\r\nLord Eliot; Henry Thynne was created Lord Carteret; and a barony was\r\nconferred on the second son of the Duke of Northumberland. Thus the\r\nsources of nobility, which had remained hermetically sealed during\r\nthe previous administration, were now opened with a highly suggestive\r\nreadiness.\r\n\r\nAnother incident, which it is more pleasing to relate, concerned\r\nPitt alone. On 11th January the Clerkship of the Pells, a sinecure\r\nworth £3,000 a year for life, fell vacant by the death of Sir Edward\r\nWalpole, a younger son of the Whig statesman. According to precedent,\r\nit would have been not only justifiable, but usual for Pitt to take\r\nthis post. Despite the advice of his friends to this effect, Pitt\r\nrefused to increase his very slender private income at the public\r\nexpense, and prevailed on Colonel Barré to accept the sinecure in\r\nplace of the pension of £3,200 a year generously voted to him by the\r\neconomical Rockingham. This most unexpected conduct, which of course\r\nsaved the public funds the amount of that pension, was loudly praised\r\nby Barré himself and by all who were not inveterate partisans. These\r\nlast decried Pitt’s action as resulting either from love of applause\r\nor from priggishness. The taunt has been echoed in later times, even\r\nby those who laud to the skies Chatham’s self-abnegation in the matter\r\nof official perquisites. Nothing better illustrates the malice which\r\nhas dogged the footsteps of the son than that sneers should be his\r\nreward for an action similar in all respects to that which has elicited\r\npraise for his father. Both of them, surely, desired at the outset to\r\nemphasize their resolve to put down financial jobbery in the public\r\nservice. Their actions were prompted solely by patriotism.\r\n\r\nOn 12th January, when Parliament met, Pitt had to bear the brunt of\r\nreiterated attacks from Fox, Erskine, and General Conway, under cover\r\nof motions for resuming a Committee to consider the state of the\r\nnation. The young Minister parried their blows by stating his resolve\r\nto bring in very soon an India Bill. Then, flinging back their taunts,\r\nthat he had crept into office by the backstairs, he uttered these\r\nmemorable words: “The integrity of my own heart and the probity of the\r\npublic, as well as my private principles, shall always be my sources\r\nof action. I will never condescend to be the instrument of any secret\r\nadvisers whatever; nor in any one instance, while I have the honour to\r\nact as Minister of the Crown in this House, will I be responsible for\r\nmeasures not my own, or at least in which my heart and judgement do not\r\ncordially acquiesce.” The glance of contempt which he flung at Lord\r\nNorth (the unwilling tool of George III in the American War) gave point\r\nto this declaration. In truth, it sounded the keynote of Pitt’s career.\r\nHe came into office to save the country from the Coalition, but he came\r\nin untrammelled by royal control; and his action in resigning in 1801\r\nevinced the proud consistency of his convictions.\r\n\r\nBeaten in the first division in the House of Commons by a majority of\r\nthirty-nine, and on the next day by even larger numbers, he held on\r\nhis way unmoved.[207] In consonance with the traditions of Chatham, he\r\ncared little for Parliament provided that the country was with him; and\r\nof this there were unmistakable proofs. The East India Company, acting\r\nthrough a sub-committee which sat permanently for the defence of its\r\ninterests, was arousing all the chartered bodies of the land against a\r\npolicy that seemed to threaten other vested interests. “Our property\r\nand charter are forcibly invaded: look to your own.” This was the\r\nbattle-cry, unscrupulous but effective, which made aldermen, freemen,\r\nwardens, and liverymen of venerable companies bestir themselves. A\r\nlittle later the City of London sent an address of thanks to the King\r\nfor his action in saving the country from the evils of Fox’s India Bill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus Pitt, wafted onwards by the breath of popular favour, could\r\nconfidently expose his India Bill to the contrary gusts that eddied\r\nin the House of Commons (14th January 1784). The methods used in its\r\npreparation were in signal contrast to those employed by Fox. The Whig\r\nleader, far from consulting the East India Company, had drawn up his\r\nBill in concert with Burke and others hostile to its interests and\r\nill-informed as to its working. Pitt, on the contrary, took care to\r\nfind out the views entertained in Leadenhall Street. The Pitt Papers\r\nshow that the Company manifested a desire to meet him more than half\r\nway, and that their representative officials conferred with him on\r\n5th January 1784. Indeed, his Bill was in large measure the outcome\r\nof resolutions which seem to have been framed at that conference and\r\nwhich gained the assent of five-sixths of those present at a General\r\nCourt of the Company held on 10th January. The resolutions were to\r\nthis effect:--That the Company, confiding in the justice of Government\r\nfor the relief of some of its most pressing claims, consented that the\r\nfollowing powers should be vested in the Crown: (1) All despatches to\r\nor from India to be communicated to one of the King’s Ministers, and\r\nthe Directors must conform to the King’s pleasure. The controlling\r\npower to be vested in the Minister and other responsible persons\r\ndelegated to attend to the affairs of the Company. (2) Despatches\r\nrelating to commercial affairs must likewise be submitted to the\r\nMinister, who may negative them if they bear on civil or military\r\nGovernment, or on the revenues of the Company. In case of dispute, the\r\ndecision of His Majesty in Council shall be final. (3) The General\r\nCourt of the Company shall be restrained from rescinding any act of\r\nthe Court of Directors only after the King’s pleasure shall have been\r\nsignified on the same. (4) The Government in India to be carried on in\r\nthe name of the Company by a Governor and three councillors in each of\r\nthe Presidencies, the Governor and the Commander-in-Chief (who shall be\r\nnext in Council to the Governor) being appointed and recalled by the\r\nCrown, while the Company appointed the two other councillors, subject\r\nto His Majesty’s approbation. They could be recalled either by the\r\nCrown or by the Company.[208]\r\n\r\nWhen the Company agreed to sacrifice so much of its powers, the battle\r\nwas half won; but, for the present, the chief difficulty lay in the\r\nHouse of Commons. In introducing his India Bill on 14th January, Pitt\r\nsought to forestall the criticisms of the hostile majority by reminding\r\nthe House that the government of territories so remote and so different\r\nfrom our own must be in a sense irrational--“inconvenient to the mother\r\nand supreme power, oppressive and inadequate to the necessities of the\r\ngoverned.” In such a case any scheme of government must be a choice\r\nbetween inconveniences. He then stated the principles on which he\r\nbased his proposals. Firstly, the Indian dominion must not be in the\r\nhands of the Company of merchants in Leadenhall Street. Nevertheless,\r\nany change should be made not violently, but with the concurrence of\r\nthat Company, its commercial affairs being left as far as possible to\r\nits supervision, wherever they were not mixed up with questions of\r\npolicy and revenue. Where these questions were involved, obviously\r\nGovernment must have a voice.\r\n\r\nHaving laid down these guiding principles, he proceeded to fill in\r\ndetails. He claimed that his proposals were such as not to interfere\r\narbitrarily with the privileges of the Company; and that his new Board\r\nof Control would be found to be, not the organ of a party, but an\r\nadjunct of the governmental machinery. It was to consist of at least\r\ntwo of the Ministers of the Crown, namely, the Secretary for Home\r\nAffairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, along with a certain\r\nnumber of Privy Councillors named by the King. These last were to\r\nattend regularly, and were not to be paid. All the despatches of the\r\nCompany, except those of a completely commercial nature, were to be\r\nsubmitted to the new India Board and countersigned by it. While not\r\ncontrolling the patronage of the Company, the Board would have the\r\nright to negative their chief appointments. The three Presidencies were\r\nhenceforth to be administered, each by a Governor (a Governor-General\r\nin the case of Bengal), a Commander-in-Chief, and a Council. The\r\nCrown would appoint these three Commanders-in-Chief, and would have\r\nthe right of recalling the Governors and their councillors--a clause\r\ncalculated to prevent such a fiasco as that of the attempted recall of\r\nWarren Hastings. Finally, in order to curb the abuses in the Company’s\r\nservice, Pitt proposed to institute at Westminster a tribunal for the\r\ntrial of offences committed in India, and he suggested that parts of\r\nthe second India Bill of Fox might be adopted for the prevention of\r\nabuses in India.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this measure excelled that of Fox in many\r\nrespects. It left the actual details of administration to Governors\r\nand councillors who were on the spot and could act therefore with\r\npromptitude; but, by subjecting them in all matters other than\r\ncommercial to what was in effect a special committee of the Privy\r\nCouncil, it associated the Government of India with the British\r\nconstitution in a way that answered the needs of the time and the\r\ndevelopments of the future.\r\n\r\nBut the House of Commons was in no mood to gauge the excellences of\r\nthe scheme. It was swayed rather by the vehement criticisms of Fox,\r\nwho declared that the Bill gave far too much influence to the Crown,\r\nand that, if passed, it must inevitably lead to the loss of India. The\r\nFox-North Coalition still voted solidly for their chiefs, and on 23rd\r\nJanuary the measure was thrown out on the second reading by 222 votes\r\nto 214.\r\n\r\nScenes of great excitement ensued. Fox and his followers loudly called\r\non the Ministry to resign. Pitt sat still, vouchsafing no reply to the\r\nclamour, except when General Conway accused him of sending agents over\r\nthe land to corrupt the voters. Then he started to his feet, defying\r\nConway to substantiate the charge, but, for the rest, declaring his\r\nindifference to the slanders of opponents, and his determination to\r\nwork for the welfare of the State.\r\n\r\nThree days later, when Fox charged him with acting as the\r\nunconstitutional Minister of the Crown and overriding the powers of\r\nParliament, he replied that such was not his act and intention. His\r\nconduct was unusual because the occasion was unprecedented. To have\r\nresigned after the recent vote would have brought to power Ministers\r\nwho, he believed, had not the confidence of the nation; and he further\r\npointed to the recent diminution of the votes of the Opposition. The\r\nargument was telling, for the hostile majority had dwindled from one\r\nhundred and six on 3rd December, to thirty-nine on 12th January, and\r\nnow to eight. These facts clinched his contention that the feeling of\r\nthe House was inclining to the favourable verdict which the country had\r\nbegun to declare. A shrewd observer like Wraxall came to see that Pitt\r\nwas vindicating the constitution even in his seeming breach of it.[209]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, everything was at hazard. Though the majority against\r\nhim lessened, it was still a clear majority; and to appeal from an\r\nindisputable fact to what was at most a surmise, seemed a defiance of\r\nthe House. As such it met with severe handling at the hands of Fox and\r\nhis sturdy henchman, Coke of Norfolk. They, however, finally agreed\r\nto adjourn the whole question for three days. Why Fox did not at once\r\npress his advantage to the utmost is hard to say. Perhaps he feared\r\nto let loose the passions of the House upon the country at large when\r\nConsols were down at 54 and national ruin seemed imminent. He may have\r\ndesired to gain time in order to watch the trend of public opinion, and\r\nto appear as a peace-restoring Neptune rather than an inconsiderate\r\nAeolus.\r\n\r\nAn influential minority of the House longed for calm. On that very\r\nday fifty-three of its members met privately at the St. Albans Tavern\r\nto urge a union of parties on a more natural and less unpopular basis\r\nthan the Fox-North Coalition. Appointing a committee of five, they\r\nbesought the Duke of Portland to use his influence to bring about a\r\nconnection between Fox and Pitt. As we have seen, the hostility of\r\nthese statesmen had arisen, not from difference of principles, but from\r\nthe divergent interests of party groups. It had, however, been inflamed\r\nby Pitt’s acceptance of office in circumstances that were especially\r\nodious to Fox; and the Whig leader, in his speech of 26th January,\r\npointedly declared that, while admitting the urgent need of union and\r\nconciliation, he must insist on the vindication of the honour of the\r\nHouse by the resignation of the present unconstitutional Ministry. A\r\nsimilar declaration was sent on the same day by the Duke of Portland to\r\nthe committee of the St. Albans Tavern meeting.\r\n\r\nSuch a beginning was far from promising. Clearly an understanding\r\nexisted between the nominal and real chiefs of the Whig party with a\r\nview to forcing on a dissolution. This implied that the conciliators\r\nwere appealing to party-leaders to act as arbiters, and that they\r\nat once passed judgement against the Pitt Ministry. Matters were\r\nnot improved during a debate in the House on the need of forming an\r\nextended Administration (2nd February). Fox, while disclaiming any\r\npersonal hostility to Pitt, insisted on the resignation of Ministers\r\nas the first step towards the formation of a wider Administration.\r\nOn his side Pitt once more declared that any union between them must\r\nbe formed in an honourable way, and that it would be paltry for him\r\nto resign merely in order to treat for re-admission to office. The\r\noriginal motion having passed unanimously, a hostile resolution was\r\nthen brought forward substantiating Fox’s declaration. Whereupon Pitt,\r\nnettled by these insidious tactics, declared that he would never change\r\nhis armour and beg to be received as a volunteer among the forces of\r\nthe enemy. Never, he exclaimed, would he consent to resign before the\r\nterms of such a union were arranged. If the House desired to drive the\r\nMinistry from office there were two ways open--either to petition the\r\nKing for their removal, or to impeach them. At present their remaining\r\nin office was not unconstitutional. The hostile motion, however, passed\r\nby a majority of nineteen; and by a slightly larger majority the House\r\nresolved to lay its decision before the King.\r\n\r\nThat day was perhaps the most critical of Pitt’s parliamentary career.\r\nThe feeling of the House seemed to be turning against him; and the\r\nnegotiations at the St. Albans Tavern (which went on intermittently\r\nuntil 1st March) were far from favourable to his interests. Both sides\r\nagreed as to the goal to be reached, but each threw on the other the\r\nresponsibility of taking the first step, which that other declined\r\non points of honour. At the outset the Duke of Portland declined to\r\nsee Pitt with respect to a union until he had resigned. Then, on 31st\r\nJanuary, he hinted, obscurely enough, that the Minister might find a\r\nmiddle way; and when Pitt requested an explanation, he referred him to\r\nrecent precedents, which were in effect resignations.\r\n\r\nThe good sense which rarely deserts the House of Commons for long\r\nreappeared on 11th February. Fox then professed not only his readiness\r\nto serve with Pitt, when he had complied with the terms of the\r\nconstitution, but also his desire to meet him half-way as to the\r\ndetails of a new India Bill of which he had given notice. Pitt replied\r\nin a similar spirit, but declared that there were some men with whom he\r\ncould not serve. Thereupon Lord North, at whom this shaft was levelled,\r\ndeclared his willingness to stand aside if the voice of the country\r\ndemanded it. No act in his career did him more credit, and the incident\r\naroused a general hope that Pitt would now feel himself able with\r\nhonour to resign.\r\n\r\nHe refused, however, to take that step, probably because of the\r\ncontinued obduracy of the Duke of Portland. The St. Albans Tavern\r\nCommittee had besought the King to intervene in order to facilitate\r\nan interview between Pitt and the Duke. Accordingly on Sunday, 16th\r\nFebruary, the King rather reluctantly urged the Duke to meet the Prime\r\nMinister, but signified privately to Pitt his resolve never to apply\r\nto His Grace again if he still declined.[210] Nevertheless the Duke\r\nrefused to unbend.\r\n\r\nThe last stage of the negotiations illustrates the niggling methods\r\nof partisanship prevalent in those times. In answer to a final appeal\r\nfrom the committee, Pitt and his colleagues urged the King to make\r\none more effort to bring the Duke of Portland to an accommodation.\r\nThe reply of the King on 26th February shows that, in spite of his\r\nstrong objections, he made that effort, but with the stipulation that\r\nthe Duke should have “no right to anything above an equal share to\r\nothers in the new administration, not to be the head of it, whatever\r\nemployment he may hold.” Pitt amplified this statement by declaring\r\nthat the new Ministry would be formed “on a wide basis, and on fair\r\nand equal terms.” Obviously this implied the entry of the followers\r\nof Portland and Fox on equal terms with those of Pitt; but the Duke,\r\nwhile approving the word “fair,” required to know the meaning of the\r\nword “equal”; and when Pitt replied that this could be best explained\r\nin their interview, the Duke refused to come unless the meaning of the\r\nword were first made clear.[211] This straining at gnats put an end to\r\nthe negotiations. It is now abundantly clear that Pitt went as far as\r\ncould be expected, and that the continuation of the deadlock resulted\r\nfrom the captiousness of the Duke of Portland.\r\n\r\nTen years were to elapse before the Portland Whigs came in to\r\nstrengthen Pitt’s hands, and their accession amid the storms of the\r\nFrench Revolution involved the break up of the Whig party. In February\r\n1784 there was a chance that the whole party would form a working\r\nalliance with Pitt and the Chathamites. Such a union would have formed\r\na phalanx strong enough to renovate the life of Great Britain and to\r\nprepare her better to stand the strain of the coming crises. It was not\r\nto be. Obviously no union could be lasting where the party knocking for\r\nadmission insisted on dictating its terms and gaining admission to the\r\ncitadel.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, an air of unreality about these negotiations,\r\nprobably due to the fact that each party was intent on the state of\r\npublic opinion and the chances of a dissolution. The same fact probably\r\nexplains the action of Fox in the House. Time after time he carried\r\nmotions of censure against Pitt, though by wavering majorities. He and\r\nhis followers hindered the apportionment of the supplies, threatened\r\nto block the annual Mutiny Bill, and went so far as to hold the menace\r\nof impeachment over the heads of Ministers. When the Lords by a large\r\nmajority reprobated the actions of the Commons and begged the King to\r\ncontinue his Ministers in office, the intervention of the Upper House\r\nwas strongly resented by the Coalition majority.[212]\r\n\r\nYet Fox never pressed his attacks home. The threats of impeachment\r\nremained mere stage thunder, probably because he doubted his power to\r\nlaunch the bolt. There was, indeed, much truth in Pitt’s description of\r\nhim as “the champion of a small majority of this House against the loud\r\nand decided voice of this people.” Hatred of the unnatural Coalition,\r\nfar from declining, was intensified by Pitt’s manly and consistent\r\nconduct. The popular imagination thrilled at the sight of the young\r\nPremier braving the clamour of Foxites and Northites in reliance upon\r\nthe final verdict of the nation. According to all the constitutional\r\ntext-books, the Whig leader spoke sound doctrine when he declaimed\r\nagainst Pitt’s tenure of office in the teeth of the repeated censures\r\nof the House; but men discerned the weakness of the Opposition; they\r\nweighed it rather than counted heads; and in the balances of common\r\nsense the Fox-North majority kicked the beam. Westminster and Banbury,\r\nthe very places which had returned Fox and North, now sent up addresses\r\nof thanks to the King for dismissing them from office. Middlesex,\r\nEdinburgh, York, Worcester, Exeter, and Southwark, besides many smaller\r\nplaces, sent in addresses to the same effect, thereby in some cases\r\ndishonouring the parliamentary drafts of their members. The City of\r\nLondon, the home of blatant Whiggism at the time of the Wilkes affair,\r\nnow thanked Pitt for his services and voted him its freedom, with the\r\naccompaniment of a gold box. His ride into the city on 28th February\r\nto receive this honour resembled a royal progress, and Wilkes was the\r\nman who welcomed him to the Hall of the Grocers’ Company, where he was\r\nentertained at a great banquet.\r\n\r\nNor was his popularity lessened by an incident that attended his\r\nreturn to his brother’s residence in Berkeley Square. His carriage,\r\ndrawn along by a cheering crowd, was passing the chief social centre\r\nof the Foxites, Brooks’s Club, when a sudden rush was made at it by a\r\nbody of stalwart ruffians armed with sticks and the broken poles of\r\nsedan-chairs. So fierce was the onset that the carriage doors crashed\r\nin, and Lord Chatham with difficulty parried the blows aimed at his\r\nbrother. For some moments they were in serious danger, but, aided by\r\ntheir partisans, they succeeded in escaping to White’s Club, hard by.\r\nFox was loudly accused of being the author of this outrage. But, of\r\ncourse, it would be foolish to lay this brutal attack to his charge.\r\nIt seems probable, however, that hangers-on of the party paid some\r\nscoundrels to incapacitate Pitt for the rest of the parliamentary\r\nstrifes. He, and he alone, could make headway against the storm; and\r\nhis removal even for a week would have led to the triumph of Fox and\r\nNorth. We may note here that Pitt did not resign his membership of\r\nBrooks’s Club on account of this outrage--a proof that he was far above\r\nall thoughts of revenge or rancour.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the Opposition were somewhat marred by the events\r\nof 28th February. Everything tended to hamper the actions of that\r\nill-assorted couple, North and Fox. True, on 1st March they carried by\r\ntwelve votes an address to the King for the removal of Ministers; but\r\nGeorge III acted not only with firmness but with dignity. He replied,\r\nas he had before replied to a similar address, that he deplored the\r\nfailure of the efforts to form an extended Administration on _fair\r\nand equal terms_, but saw in that failure no reason for dismissing\r\nMinisters who appeared to have the confidence of the country, and\r\nagainst whom no specific charges were urged. These skilful retorts\r\nstruck home; and a long and reproachful representation to the King,\r\nsaid to have been drawn up by Burke, was carried by a majority of only\r\none. Pitt looked on this as tantamount to a triumph; for two days later\r\nhe wrote to the Duke of Rutland that he was “tired to death even with\r\nvictory; for I think our present state is entitled to that name.”[213]\r\nHis forecast was correct. In face of these dwindling numbers, Fox and\r\nNorth did not venture to oppose the passing of the Mutiny Bill, which,\r\nsince the beginning of William III’s reign, has year by year legalized\r\nthe existence of a standing army.[214]\r\n\r\nTo allow this measure to pass, after threatening to obstruct the work\r\nof Government, was a virtual confession of failure; and not only the\r\nHouse but the country took it as such. The inner weakness of the\r\nCoalition now became daily more evident. Discontents that were hidden\r\nduring the months of seeming triumph broke forth as the prospect of\r\ndefeat loomed large ahead. The tension of the past two months now gave\r\nway to a strange slackness, resulting doubtless from the uncertainties\r\nof the situation. Fox relapsed into silence. Pitt rarely spoke and\r\nscarcely vouchsafed a reply to the smaller men who kept up the aimless\r\nstrife. In truth, the heavy-laden air at St. Stephen’s gave premonitory\r\nsigns of that portent in nature when songsters become mute and animals\r\ncreep about with anxious restlessness under the shadow of an oncoming\r\neclipse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nation was now to give its verdict. On 24th March the King\r\ndissolved Parliament. The Great Seal disappeared from the house of the\r\nLord Chancellor on that very morning; but by great efforts another was\r\nready by noon of the 25th. For some weeks the land had simmered with\r\nsuspense. “Even ladies,” wrote Horace Walpole on 12th March, “talk of\r\nnothing but politics.” In truth, a time of new political fashions was\r\nat hand. The old having been discarded, very much depended on a decided\r\nlead given by some of the leading constituencies.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons men looked eagerly to the example set by Yorkshire\r\nand Westminster. Both had recently led the way in the agitation\r\nfor Economic and Parliamentary Reform and were strongholds of\r\nWhiggism; yet both the county and the city had recently acclaimed\r\nthe conduct of Pitt. Canon Mason, a well-known poet of those days,\r\nwho, with the reforming parson, Wyvill, had fathered the Yorkshire\r\nReform Association, was now working hard on behalf of George III and\r\nPitt--a fact which spoke volumes. Yet, despite the strength of the\r\nAssociation, and the ardent Toryism of most of the clothing towns of\r\nthe West Riding, the influence of the great Whig Houses, especially\r\nthe Cavendishes in Wharfedale, the Fitzwilliams at Wentworth, and the\r\nEarl of Carlisle at Castle Howard, was so strong as to make the issue\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the county was tested first at a great meeting of its\r\nfreeholders held in the yard of the Castle at York on Lady Day. Despite\r\ndriving hail-storms and a bitter wind, thousands of sturdy yeomen,\r\ntogether with throngs of clothiers from the towns of the West Riding,\r\npoured into that historic space. Then came the magnates of the county,\r\ndriving up in their coaches-and-six. In good old English style the\r\ntwo sides of the case were set forth on the hustings in fair and open\r\nrivalry by the best speakers of both parties. The large towns and the\r\nyeomen evidently favoured the royal prerogative upheld by Pitt, while\r\nthe claims of the Whigs and of North’s followers were championed by\r\nthe great lords and their tenantry, by sticklers for constitutional\r\nprecedents, and all who hoped to benefit by a change of Ministry.\r\nThe issues at stake being as obscure as the cleavage between parties\r\nwas zigzag, the speeches for the most part fell ineffectively. What\r\nwith the sleet and the confusion of parties the meeting seemed about\r\nto break up in disorder, when there appeared on the daïs a figure\r\nso slim and weak as to quail before the blasts. But the first few\r\nsentences of that silvery voice penetrated the storm and dominated the\r\nswaying crowd. It was the voice of Wilberforce, who once more showed\r\nthe influence of clearness of thought and beauty of utterance over a\r\nconfused throng. Boswell, describing the whole incident to Dundas,\r\nsaid: “I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table; but, as I\r\nlistened he grew and grew until the shrimp became a whale.”\r\n\r\nThe victory of mind over matter was decisive. His arraignment of the\r\nCoalition and defence of Pitt carried the meeting with him; and a great\r\nshout arose: “We’ll have this man as our county member.” The instinct\r\nof the meeting was sound. The tact of Wilberforce in uniting all Whigs\r\nand Tories who were not committed to the Coalition or bound by the\r\nmagnates greatly furthered his cause; so that finally an election which\r\nhad of late always been decided by the three great Houses named above,\r\nresulted in the triumphant return of Wilberforce and Duncombe. The show\r\nof hands was so overwhelmingly in their favour that the Whigs accepted\r\nthe verdict and did not demand a poll. The victory was not only a\r\nsevere blow to the county families and an assertion of the growing\r\nindependence of the middle classes and yeomen; it was also a gain for\r\nthe cause of purity, the total expenses of the successful candidates\r\nbeing less than £5,000.\r\n\r\nThe example set in Yorkshire was followed in most parts of Great\r\nBritain. The supporters of the Coalition were smitten hip and thigh;\r\nas many as 160 members of the Opposition were thrown out, and by a\r\nvery obvious joke they were termed Fox’s Martyrs, the details of their\r\ndeaths being recorded with tragi-comic solemnity.[215] The strength\r\nand universality of the popular impulse surprised even Pitt.[216]\r\nHe was carried in triumphantly by 334 votes for the University of\r\nCambridge, his friend, Lord Euston, gaining 288, while their opponents,\r\nTownshend and Mansfield, polled only 267 and 181 respectively.[217]\r\nWilkes swept Middlesex by a large majority--for the Crown. Skilful\r\nspeakers like Erskine, county magnates like Earl Verney and Thomas\r\nGrenville, were thrust aside for the crime of supporting the Coalition;\r\nand in certain boroughs, where no one had been sent down to oppose\r\nthat hated union, travellers who declaimed against it were forcibly\r\ndetained and returned as members of Parliament. Never, we are assured\r\nby Wraxall, was there less bribery used in the interests of the\r\nCrown; for, as he naively asserts, “corruption for once became almost\r\nunnecessary.”[218]\r\n\r\nThe reasons of this extraordinary overthrow of the Coalition are not\r\nfar to seek. Tories felt far more regard for the royal prerogative\r\nthan for Lord North, now that he had gone over to the King’s enemies;\r\nand independent Whigs refused to follow Fox in his ex-centric march\r\ntowards the Northites. Thus the Coalition was in reality defeated\r\nby--the Coalition. That jaundiced old Whig, Horace Walpole, might\r\nabjure his friendship with Mason for heading “the pert and ignorant\r\ncabal at York”; he might declare that the nation must be intoxicated to\r\napplaud the use of the royal prerogative against “the Palladium of the\r\npeople” (the House of Commons). “Junius” might raise his once dreaded\r\nvoice to assure his countrymen that the victory of Pitt would put an\r\nend to their boasted liberties. It was useless. The nation’s instinct\r\nbade it break with the past and start afresh on a path that promised\r\nsteady progress. That instinct now swept aside the old party lines and\r\norganizations in a way that had not been seen since the advent of the\r\nGeorges.\r\n\r\nOnly at one place was the rout of the Whigs stayed; and the doubtful\r\nissue of the conflict at Westminster attested the wondrous personal\r\npowers of Fox. A union of strength with geniality, of eloquence with\r\nfrankness, which appeals to Englishmen, was seen in him in all its\r\npotency. The “magician” (to use Pitt’s phrase about his rival) waved\r\nhis wand with startling effect. A few days of platform speaking\r\nsufficed to restore his earlier popularity. Despite the utmost efforts\r\nof the Court and Government on behalf of their candidates, Admiral\r\nHood and Sir Cecil Wray, the Whig totals crept up day by day, so as to\r\nthreaten the seat of the latter, which at one time seemed assured.[219]\r\nGeorge III followed the course of the Westminster election with an\r\neager interest that reveals his hatred of the Whig leader. This is\r\nseen in his suggestion on 13th April to Pitt that bad votes should be\r\nfabricated at Westminster to counterbalance those which must have been\r\ntrumped up for Fox; or again (1st May) that the _Quackers_ [_sic_]\r\nmight perhaps be induced to come to the poll in the interests of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAll was of no avail. The arts of Windsor were foiled by the charms\r\nof Devonshire House. Georgiana, the beauteous duchess, used her\r\nallurements to rally voters to the Whig cause, and is said to have\r\ncarried her complaisance so far as to kiss a butcher for a promise\r\nof his vote. Certain it is that she and her sister, the Viscountess\r\nDuncannon, conveyed artisans from the outlying districts to the poll\r\nin their own chariots. The Countesses of Carlisle and Derby, Lady\r\nBeauchamp, and Mrs. Crewe, also used their charms on behalf of the Whig\r\ncause, so that a favouring rhymester could write:\r\n\r\n  Sure Heaven approves of Fox’s cause\r\n    (Though slaves at Court abhor him),\r\n  To vote for Fox, then, who can pause\r\n    Since _Angels_ canvass for him?[220]\r\n\r\nIn vain did the Court put forward the Countess of Salisbury to keep\r\nwaverers steadfast. The Countess possessed beauty, but tempered by\r\nage and discretion. Thanks to the exertions of Georgiana, and to the\r\ninfluence of the Prince of Wales and of the Dukes of Portland and\r\nDevonshire, Fox, at the end of an exciting contest of forty days,\r\nheaded Sir Cecil Wray by 236 votes, though he still fell 460 votes\r\nbelow Lord Hood. The Prince of Wales celebrated this triumph by a great\r\nreception in the grounds of Carlton House at the very time when the\r\nKing was passing outside to open Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut the local success of the Whigs was not yet complete. Many\r\nsuspicious facts during the election seemed to discredit the result;\r\nand when Sir Cecil Wray demanded a scrutiny, the High Bailiff of\r\nWestminster not only granted the request, but refused to make any\r\nreturn for Westminster, thus invalidating the election of Fox and even\r\nof Hood until an inquiry was held.[221] Fox entered Parliament, but it\r\nwas through the kindness and foresight of Sir Thomas Dundas, who had\r\nprocured his election for the Orkney and Shetland Islands. At once he\r\nattacked the High Bailiff as well as the Government, which he accused\r\nof influencing the action of that official. The matter is too involved\r\nand technical to enter upon here. Its chief interest lies in the manly\r\nand massive oration which Fox flung against Pitt on 8th June. The Prime\r\nMinister evaded the missile with much dexterity; and a large majority\r\ninsisted on the scrutiny. After nine months of inquiry the position\r\nof the candidates was virtually unchanged. The Government’s following\r\nstrongly desired to end this expensive and fruitless inquiry; but Pitt\r\nopposed the motions to this effect, and early in the session of 1785\r\nfound himself abandoned by his majority.\r\n\r\nThe motives which prompted his action on this affair will be considered\r\nin Chapter XII; but we may here note that it certainly lessened his\r\npersonal influence in the critical session of 1785. His own position\r\nhad hitherto been so well assured that generous behaviour towards\r\none of the most affable and open-handed men of his time would have\r\nbeen both natural and becoming. As it was, many of his friends were\r\ndisgusted, and some thought his conduct would fatally prejudice his\r\nfuture. Thus, on 10th February 1785 Daniel Pulteney wrote as follows:\r\n“Contrary to the wish of all his real friends, and only supported by\r\nDundas, Lord Mulgrave, and Bearcroft, Pitt persevered in this cursed\r\nbusiness.... The consequence of this will be trifling if Pitt will\r\n_now_ recede and agree to order the return, but ... many will form a\r\nvery different idea of the Administration if such an odious business is\r\nforced down by a small majority.”[222] Fortunately Pitt’s own friends\r\nabandoned him before matters went too far. The affair unsteadied his\r\nfollowers for a time; and the impression was spread abroad that he had\r\nall the qualifications for winning a decisive victory, but none of the\r\ngraces that add lustre to its laurels. Apart from this personal detail,\r\nwhich influenced public opinion more than far wider questions, Pitt’s\r\ntriumph in and after 1784 was so complete as to usher in a new era in\r\nBritish politics. We may therefore pause to review both its causes and\r\nits significance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the irremediable blunder committed by Fox in framing the\r\nCoalition with Lord North, he made several mistakes during the early\r\nweeks of 1784. It was in the highest degree unwise to stake everything\r\non the cohesion of his majority in the Commons, and to seek to avert a\r\ndissolution. Judging by his motions in the House, it was the worst of\r\ncrimes for Pitt to advise the King to appeal to the nation. But surely\r\nthat was the natural and almost inevitable step, seeing that Parliament\r\nhad sat for four years, and the opponents were very nearly matched.\r\nYet, while hindering the course of public business by the postponement\r\nof votes for the public service, Fox claimed to be acting with a single\r\neye to the public welfare. Such conduct evinced no insight into the\r\nessentials of the problem before him. For surely, if Ministers were\r\nacting as illegally as he averred, it was his duty to impeach them. If\r\ntheir offence was more venial, the verdict of the people would suffice.\r\nThe question could be decided only in one of two ways--either by an\r\nimpeachment or a dissolution. He decided in neither way, but allowed\r\nthe tangle to grow worse, until men came to believe that his sole aims\r\nwere to shirk any appeal, either to the laws of England or to the\r\nhustings, and to force his way once more to power along with Lord North\r\nby means of their large but unstable majority. This was the suspicion\r\nwhich thinned their following at St. Stephen’s and ruined them at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nPitt, on the other hand, showed great tactical skill in working his way\r\nout from an apparently hopeless position. Admitting that his tenure\r\nof office was irregular, he justified it by the unanswerable retort\r\nthat the Opposition could not govern. Accepting their decision, that\r\nsupplies should be postponed so as to prevent a dissolution, he made it\r\nclear whose was the responsibility for the resulting disorganization.\r\nFinally, when the inability of his opponents to block the Mutiny Bill\r\nhad set free the administrative machine, he appealed to the country.\r\nMen were quick to see which side had best consulted the interests of\r\nthe State. Over against the impotently factious conduct of Fox stood\r\nthe patriotic good sense of his rival in disregarding the wavering\r\ncensures of a discredited House in order on the fitting occasion to\r\nconsult the will of the nation.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the essential facts of that unparalleled situation are\r\nfully grasped, the diatribes against Pitt for making an illegal use\r\nof the royal prerogative for selfish purposes are seen to be mere\r\nverbiage. Equally futile is it to inquire, with Lord John Russell, why\r\nthe constitution was not afterwards altered in favour of the Crown,\r\nand why the Court did not gain more advantage by its triumph in the\r\nGeneral Election of 1784.[223] The fact is that Pitt had never intended\r\nto govern as a Court minion, or to subject the constitution to the\r\nroyal will. It was not merely that his pride revolted against any such\r\ndegradation; but his principles, no less than the tough consistency of\r\nhis nature, forbade it. Because he insisted on maintaining the King’s\r\nprerogative at one point, namely, that Ministers were dismissed by him\r\nand not by the House of Commons, he was far from supporting it at all\r\npoints. Even in that particular, he admitted that Government could not\r\nbe carried on by Ministers who had not the confidence of the House of\r\nCommons, but he asserted, and triumphantly proved, that that House had\r\nnot the confidence of the nation. For the long delay in putting the\r\nmatter to the test, Fox, not he, was responsible.\r\n\r\nIn reality, then, there was no violation of the constitution, and\r\nno change in Pitt’s relations to the Crown. True, he had sought to\r\nreconcile its prerogatives with the functions of Parliament; but his\r\nattitude towards George III was still marked by a proud independence,\r\nwhich often caused annoyance.[224] He brought forward measures which\r\nthe King disapproved; and in all important matters he had his way\r\ndown to the spring of 1801, when George III demurred on conscientious\r\ngrounds. The shelving of the cause of Parliamentary Reform by Pitt\r\nafter the year 1785 resulted from the utter indifference of the nation,\r\nnot from any bargain that he had corruptly struck with the King.\r\n\r\nBut if the memorable contest of 1784 has not the significance sometimes\r\nascribed to it in partisan narratives, it is of great moment in\r\nregard to the monarchy, the Cabinet, and the course of events at St.\r\nStephen’s. George III came forth victorious from his long struggle with\r\nthe Whig Houses; but the magnitude of the peril had taught him prudence\r\nand self-restraint; and, while keeping a tight hand on patronage, he\r\nwas thenceforth content, in the more important sphere of legislation,\r\nto leave a free hand to the Minister who had saved him from the\r\nopen conflict with the Commons which Fox had sought to precipitate.\r\nThe relations between the King and Prime Minister therefore came to\r\nresemble those which had subsisted between the first two Georges and\r\nWalpole.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the growth in the powers of the Cabinet, which had been\r\ninterrupted since the fall of that Minister, now proceeded normally.\r\nDuring the seventeen years of Pitt’s supremacy the principle became\r\nfirmly established that the chief Minister of the Crown was the centre\r\nof authority, and that, while holding that authority nominally from\r\nthe King, he exercised it by virtue of a mandate from the people.\r\nGeorge, therefore, had escaped from the thraldom of the Coalition only\r\nin order to bow before an authority which was at once constitutional\r\nand irresistible. He no longer had to do with the nominee of a dozen\r\ngreat families, but with a man who had the clearly expressed confidence\r\nof the nation. The same fact tended to make the Cabinet of the future\r\nmore and more a homogeneous and well disciplined Council, obeying the\r\nimpulsion of the first Minister, and adding force to his declarations\r\nof policy. No longer was it possible, as in Lord North’s decade of\r\noffice, for the Ministers to act singly and at the behests of the\r\nsovereign. George III’s policy of _divide et impera_ might succeed with\r\nNorth; it could not but fail before the iron resolution of Pitt. The\r\nKing’s acquiescence in the new order of things enabled him to regain\r\nmuch of the ground which he had earlier lost by his masterful efforts\r\nto govern as well as reign. Well was it for the British monarchy that\r\nthose disputes were settled before the storms of the French Revolution\r\nbeat upon that ancient fabric.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may note that Pitt was far more than a second Walpole. The\r\nsturdy Norfolk squire wielded power, as a nominee of the Whig Houses;\r\nbut Pitt was established in office by a wider and grander mandate. The\r\nGeneral Election of 1784 ended the existing party system and shattered\r\nthe rule of the Whig families who had hitherto dominated the Georgian\r\nEra. The somnolent acquiescence of the populace in that headship now\r\ngave way to a more critical spirit, to a sense that the traditional\r\nparties must readjust themselves under a new leader. Chatham’s\r\nconception of a union which should absorb the best elements of both\r\nWhigs and Tories received a startlingly complete fulfilment; for the\r\ngreatest of the results of the election of 1784 was the emergence of a\r\nparty which may be termed national.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nRETRENCHMENT\r\n\r\n    In the arithmetic of the customs, two and two, instead of making\r\n    four, make sometimes only one.--DEAN SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sixteenth Parliament of Great Britain met on 18th May 1784\r\nthe arrears of legislation and accumulation of debt were as serious\r\nas at any time in our history; for, owing to fierce party strifes and\r\nthe distractions of war, very few remedial measures had been passed\r\nin recent years. The “Economic Reform” passed by Lord Rockingham’s\r\nGovernment is the only oasis in an otherwise arid waste, strewn with\r\nthe wrecks of partisan warfare. The condition of affairs was therefore\r\nbecoming most serious; and a collapse could be averted only by the\r\nutmost skill and care. The three per cent. government stocks told a\r\ntale of waning confidence. Even after the peace they steadily declined,\r\nfrom an average of 65 in January 1783 to 56 at the close of that year.\r\nThey were as low as 53⅞ in part of January 1784; and it is a striking\r\ntribute to the confidence which Pitt inspired that, on the results of\r\nthe elections of the spring of 1784 being known, they rose to more\r\nthan 58. That first essential to a revival of national credit, a firm\r\nGovernment, was now assured, and patriots looked anxiously for the\r\nmeasures whereby the young Minister might stave off disaster.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Speech laid stress on two topics, finance and the East India\r\nCompany. Within the limits of a short session Pitt could not possibly\r\nhope to pass other large measures; and he urged Alderman Sawbridge\r\nnot to persevere with his annual motion in favour of Parliamentary\r\nReform, promising to bring it forward himself in the session of 1785.\r\nWhen the Alderman pressed the matter to a division, he was defeated by\r\na majority of seventy-four--a result damaging to the cause which he\r\nsought to serve.[225]\r\n\r\nThe way being thus left clear for the two great questions that would\r\nadmit of no delay, Pitt sought to lay the ghost of national bankruptcy.\r\nThe imminence of the danger can scarcely be realized. In that decade\r\nwe link together the thought of bankruptcy with that of France; but\r\nif those years closed with the Revolution in France and prosperity\r\nin England, the result may be ascribed very largely to the wasteful\r\nfinancial system pursued at Versailles and to the wise husbanding of\r\nBritain’s resources by Pitt. According to the French statesman, Necker,\r\nthe National Debts of the two countries were almost exactly equal.[226]\r\nThe pamphlet literature of the years 1783–84 reveals a state of things\r\nwellnigh as serious in England as that which brought about the crash\r\nin France. One of the closest students of finance, Dr. Price, in a\r\npamphlet of the early part of 1783, stated that the Fox-North Ministry\r\nopenly avowed its inability to pay off any of the public debts; and he\r\nasserted that such helpless conduct must carry us fast to the brink of\r\ndisaster. Another writer urged that, in order to abolish the National\r\nDebt, tithes must be swept away, the revenues of the Church reformed,\r\nand all citizens must submit to the payment of one-sixth part of their\r\nincomes. The National Debt, which amounted to £215,717,709 in January\r\n1783, was denounced in language whose extravagance would cause a mild\r\nsurprise to a generation that placidly bears a burden nearly four times\r\nas great; but, to a kingdom which with the utmost difficulty raised\r\n£25,000,000 in revenue, this burden seemed overwhelming. Dr. Price\r\nsummed up a widespread conviction in his statement that the growth of\r\ndebt brought about increased subservience to the Crown, prosperity to\r\nstock-jobbers, and depression to all honest traders.[227]\r\n\r\nThe war which ended in 1783 had been carried on in a singularly\r\nwasteful manner. Price computed that the increase to the National Debt\r\nowing to the war had been £115,654,000 up to January 1783, when all the\r\naccounts had not yet come in; he also reckoned that the last four years\r\nof that struggle had cost £80,016,000 as against £60,835,000 for the\r\nlast four years of the Seven Years’ War. This increase resulted largely\r\nfrom the reckless way in which North had issued loans, so that bankers\r\nand subscribers, and, it is said, the Ministers themselves, reaped\r\nlarge profits, while the nation suffered. According to Price, loans\r\nwhich cost the nation £85,857,691, actually brought to the exchequer\r\nonly £57,500,000.[228] This resulted partly from corrupt practices,\r\nbut also from North’s endeavour to keep down the rate of interest to\r\nthree or four per cent.; the outcome being that, in the impaired state\r\nof public credit of the year 1781 he had to allot £150 of stock in the\r\nthree per cents and £25 in the four per cents for every £100 actually\r\nborrowed. Thus, the raising of a sum of £12,000,000 on these terms\r\nactually cost the nation £21,000,000; and interest had to be paid on\r\n£9,000,000 which never came into the exchequer. Obviously he would have\r\ndone better to raise £100 for £100 stock, even had he given 6 or 7 per\r\ncent. interest; for the experience of the past showed that in time of\r\npeace and prosperity the rate of interest could be reduced without much\r\ndifficulty. Nevertheless, the advisers of the Crown always preferred to\r\nkeep to a low rate of interest, even at the cost of tempting lenders by\r\nallotting £175 of Government stock for every £100 of cash.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when Pitt introduced his Budget (30th\r\nJune 1784). It will be convenient to set forth and explain his\r\nproposals singly and in connection with the facts which he had to\r\nface. The first was the appallingly large deficit, constantly swollen\r\nby the coming in of bills for war expenses. The champion of peace and\r\nretrenchment had to confess that, despite all his efforts to balance\r\nincome and expenditure, he must raise a loan of £6,000,000. Obviously,\r\nas Consols still stood as low as 58, he could borrow only on exorbitant\r\nterms; but it is regrettable that he now fell back on North’s plan\r\nof borrowing at a low rate of interest and of burdening the funds\r\nwith a vast amount of fictitious debt. He proposed to allot to every\r\nsubscriber of £100 no less an amount of stock than £100 of three per\r\ncents, £50 of four per cents, and 5_s._ 6_d._ of long annuities,\r\nbesides three fifths of a lottery ticket in a lottery of 36,000\r\ntickets.[229] He computed that the terms and chances now offered were\r\nactually worth £103 14_s._ 4½_d._, and that lenders would therefore be\r\ntempted to lend.[230] This was so. But, for the reasons stated above,\r\nthe burdens bequeathed to posterity were crushing, though less than\r\nthose entailed by North’s loan of 1781.\r\n\r\nAs regards Pitt’s personal dealings with financiers, his conduct shone\r\nradiantly clear when contrasted with those of Lord North. It had been\r\nthe custom for that guardian of the public purse to arrange the price\r\nof the loan with a few favoured supporters in the City, and then allot\r\nscrip on scandalously low terms to his friends in Parliament, who\r\ncould thereafter sell at a handsome profit. Pitt now threw open to\r\npublic competition all tenders for his loan; and the proposals sent in\r\nwere formally opened at the Bank in a way which precluded jobbery and\r\nsafeguarded the nation’s interests.\r\n\r\nScarcely less serious was the problem of the huge floating, or\r\nunfunded, debt, that is, that portion of the National Debt for which\r\nno provision whatever had been made by Parliament. In the main it\r\nconsisted of unpaid bills, which had been increased by about one\r\nquarter or even one third of their original amount. It now stood at\r\nabout £14,000,000. Pitt ardently desired to fund the whole of it, but\r\nhe found that so great an effort would cause too much disturbance\r\nin the money market. He therefore proposed to fund at present only\r\n£6,600,000, forming it into stock bearing 5 per cent. interest and\r\nissued at 93. He defended this high rate of interest on the ground that\r\nsuch a stock could in the future be redeemed on more favourable terms\r\nthan a three per cent. stock which might be worth a comparatively small\r\nsum when capitalized. The argument was surely just as applicable to the\r\nformer loan of £6,000,000.[231]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt still remains to notice the worst ills that beset the fiscal and\r\ncommercial life of our land. Indeed, we shall not understand the\r\ndaring nature of Pitt’s experiment of the year 1784 unless we take\r\na comprehensive view of the losses, both material and moral, which\r\nresulted from the extraordinary prevalence of smuggling. Never had\r\ncontraband trade been so active as of late. How should it be otherwise,\r\nwhen the customs dues were tangled and burdensome; when the Navigation\r\nLaws, especially respecting the coasting trade in Scotland, were so\r\nannoyingly complex that the papers which a vessel needed for crossing\r\nthe Firth of Forth involved nearly as much expense and delay as if she\r\nwere bound for Canada.[232] In such a state of things illicit trade was\r\never gaining recruits from the ranks of honest merchants and seamen.\r\n\r\nFor monopoly, too, depressed their calling and exalted that of the\r\nsmuggler. By far the most important article subject to monopoly was\r\ntea. That expensive luxury of the days of Queen Anne, a “dish of tea,”\r\nwas now fast becoming a comfort of the many. Indeed, Arthur Young\r\nfound that the use of tea had spread into the homes of cottagers; and\r\nhe classed as extravagant those villages which owed their refreshment\r\nto China, and commended the frugality of those which adhered to\r\nhome-brewed ale.[233] The increased use of Bohea was certainly not\r\ndue to the East India Company or to the State; for the former sold\r\nthe “drug” at the high prices warranted by its monopoly of trade with\r\nChina; and on the arrival of the precious chests at our shores, an _ad\r\nvalorem_ duty of 119 per cent. had to be met. The increase of habits\r\nwhich Arthur Young deprecated and temperance reformers now applaud\r\nwas due to smugglers. We learn from Adam Smith that Dutch, French,\r\nand Swedish merchants imported tea largely;[234] and from their ports\r\nenterprising skippers conveyed it to our shores, there to be eagerly\r\nwelcomed by a populace which found the cheating of Government far\r\nmore attractive and gainful than agriculture. The annals of the time\r\nshow how deeply the coast population was infected. The large barns\r\nwhich the tourist admires in many an East Anglian coast village, more\r\noften held contraband than corn. Thomas Hardy has shown how the dull\r\nlife of a Wessex village kindled at the news of a successful “run\r\nin,” and how all classes helped to defeat the “King’s men.” The poet\r\nCrabbe, with his keen eye for the stern realities of life in his parish\r\nof Aldborough, tells of his grief at finding there, not the simple\r\nhome-loving life of an old English village,\r\n\r\n  But a bold, artful, surly savage race.\r\n\r\nTheir sport was not cricket or wrestling on the village green, but\r\nsmuggling.\r\n\r\n        Beneath yon cliff they stand\r\n  To show the freighted pinnace where to land,\r\n  To load the ready steed with guilty haste,\r\n  To fly with terror o’er the pathless waste,\r\n  Or, when detected in their straggling course,\r\n  To foil their foes by cunning or by force,\r\n  Or yielding part (which equal knaves demand)\r\n  To gain a lawless passport through the land.\r\n\r\nThese are the words of a moralist. To the easy-going many the smuggler\r\nwas merely a plucky fellow who cheated the common foe of all, the\r\nGovernment, and helped poor folks to get spirits, tea, and tobacco at\r\ncheap prices. As for showing any reluctance to buy smuggled goods, this\r\nseemed “a pedantic piece of hypocrisy.”[235] It must also be admitted\r\nthat Government had sinned against light; for the great reduction of\r\nthe tea duty by Pelham in 1745 had almost put an end to smuggling in\r\nthat article; but unfortunately his successors, when confronted with\r\nthe results of war, re-imposed the old duties and thereby gave new life\r\nto the smuggler’s calling.[236]\r\n\r\nThe excess of an evil sometimes works its cure. It was the stupidity\r\nof the fiscal regulations in France which helped to turn the attention\r\nof her most original thinkers to the subject of national finance;\r\nwhence it came about that Political Economy had its first beginnings in\r\nthe land where waste and want were rampant. So, too, it was reserved\r\nfor the son of a Kirkcaldy customs officer to note early in life the\r\nfollies of our system; and, when further enlightened by contact with\r\nmen and affairs, especially with the French _Economistes_, he was\r\nable to give to the world that illuminating survey of a subject where\r\ntradition and prejudice had previously reigned supreme. Finally, it was\r\nin the very darkest hour of Britain’s commercial and financial annals\r\nthat remedial measures were set on foot by the young statesman who had\r\nlaid to heart the teachings of the “Wealth of Nations.”\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say whether Pitt owed more to Adam Smith or to Earl\r\nShelburne. Probably the influence of the Scottish thinker on the young\r\nstatesman at this time has been exaggerated; for it seems certain that\r\nthe later editions of the “Wealth of Nations” were modified so as to\r\nbring them into line with some of Pitt’s enactments.[237] Further,\r\nPitt made no public acknowledgement of his debt to Adam Smith until\r\nhis Budget speech of 1792, when he expressed the belief that the\r\nphilosopher, then deceased, had given to the world the best solution to\r\nall commercial and economic questions. It may be, then, that Pitt in\r\n1784 owed less to Adam Smith than to his first chief, Shelburne, and\r\nto other men of affairs, including his own brother-in-law, that able\r\nthough eccentric nobleman, Lord Mahon. Shelburne was the depository of\r\nthe enlightened aims of that age; and, as Price pointed out, he and\r\nPitt in the year 1782 were about to make reforms in the public service\r\nwhich would have saved the revenue some half a million a year.[238]\r\n\r\nNow, with a freer hand, he took up the task which the Coalition of\r\nFox and North had interrupted; and in a measure which supplemented\r\nhis Budget, he proposed to cut the ground from under the smuggler\r\nby reducing the duty on tea from an average of 119 per cent. to 12½\r\nper cent. on the cheaper varieties, though on the finer kinds of tea\r\n(Suchong, Singlo, and Hyson) he imposed a higher scale of duties.[239]\r\nEven so, he expected that the produce of the tea duty would sink at\r\nfirst from £800,000 to £169,000, though he must have hoped soon to\r\nrecoup a large part of this sum. As there was a large deficit on the\r\npast year, it was necessary to devise a tax which would help to make up\r\nthe temporary loss with no risk of leakage.\r\n\r\nSuch a source of revenue Pitt found in an increase of the window-tax.\r\nEvery house with seven windows was now to pay, not four shillings, but\r\nseven shillings a year. On a house with eight windows eight shillings\r\nwere paid, and so on, except that houses with more than ten windows\r\npaid half-a-crown per window. He reckoned the increase from this source\r\nat about £700,000. Whatever objections might be urged against the tax\r\non the score of health, it certainly fell mainly on the middle and\r\nwealthy classes; for as many as 300,000 of the poorest houses went\r\nduty free. The impost may therefore be considered as a first rough\r\nattempt at taxation according to income. The change was beneficial in\r\nanother way. The old customs duty on tea violated the canon of taxation\r\nlaid down by Adam Smith--that a tax should take from the pockets of\r\nthe people as little as possible over and above what it brings into\r\nthe treasury of the State. The 119 per cent. duty seemed to challenge\r\nevasion, and the attempt to enforce it probably cost the country more\r\nthan the tax yielded. The window tax belonged to the class of excise\r\nduties the expenses of which amounted only to about 5½ per cent. of the\r\ntotal yield; and the new impost could not possibly be evaded except by\r\nthe heroic remedy of blocking up windows.\r\n\r\nThus, both in regard to economic doctrine and common sense (the\r\nformer is but the latter systematized) Pitt’s experiment ushered in\r\na new era in British finance and therefore in British commerce. The\r\nCity of London welcomed the change, which promised to lead to the\r\nemployment of twenty more clipper ships for the China tea-trade and to\r\nthe destruction of the contraband tea-trade to these shores carried\r\non hitherto by the French and Dutch East India Companies. Indeed, no\r\nsooner did this Commutation Bill (as it was called) gain general assent\r\nthan the Dutch Company offered to sell to us its cargoes of tea at a\r\nloss of 40 per cent. on prime cost and expenses. This fact alone ought\r\nto have stilled all opposition to the measure; but Fox continued to\r\noppose it with a vehemence worthy of a better cause; he was ultimately\r\nbeaten by 143 votes to 40 (10th August 1784).[240]\r\n\r\nWe may note here that by further regulations of the year 1784 and by\r\nwhat was called the “Manifest Act” of 1786, frauds on the revenue were\r\nmade far more difficult. Thus to Pitt belongs the credit of having done\r\nmore than any minister (for he succeeded where Walpole largely failed)\r\nto stop a material loss and a grave moral evil.\r\n\r\nIt would be incorrect to claim that Pitt was the first to light on the\r\nidea of substituting lower and effective duties for the exorbitant\r\nand ineffective duty on tea. William Eden (the future Lord Auckland)\r\ndeclared that very many persons had advocated some such change, and\r\nhe attributed to Lord John Cavendish the formation of the revenue\r\ncommittee, the results of whose inquiries were now utilized by the\r\nPrime Minister. Pitt, on the other hand, gave the credit of the measure\r\nto his relative, Lord Mahon. The mention of that nobleman reminds us\r\nof an incident which enlivened the debate. While sawing the air in\r\norder to emphasize his hearty approval of the death blow now dealt to\r\nsmuggling, he gave Pitt a smart knock on the head, to the unbounded\r\namusement of the House.\r\n\r\nThe details of the Budget itself do not imply a very firm belief in\r\nthe principles of what is called Free Trade. As has been shown, the\r\ndifficulties in Pitt’s way were enormous. The new loan, the funding\r\noperation, and the interest on the unfunded debt altogether entailed an\r\nadded charge of £910,000 a year. This sum he proposed to raise by means\r\nthat may be termed old-fashioned. Looking round the domain of industry,\r\nhe singled out for taxation the few articles that were duty-free or\r\nwere only lightly burdened. Men’s hats were now to pay a toll of two\r\nshillings a-piece (felt hats only sixpence), and thus bring £150,000\r\nto the nation’s purse; female finery (ribbons and gauzes) was mulcted\r\nto the extent of £120,000. He also estimated that a duty of three\r\nshillings on every chaldron of coals (not only in London as heretofore,\r\nbut throughout Great Britain) would bring in about £150,000; but he\r\nproposed to free from its operations all manufacturers who met with\r\nsharp foreign competition. Further, he imposed a tax on all horses\r\nused for riding or for pleasure, which he estimated at £100,000; and\r\nhe eked out the remainder of the sum by duties on printed linens and\r\ncalicoes, candles, hackney coaches, bricks and tiles, paper, licences\r\nfor shooting, and licences for traders in excisable goods.\r\n\r\nMost of these proposals were received with resignation, but several\r\nmembers urgently protested against the impost on coals as likely to be\r\nruinous to industry, and ultimately Pitt withdrew it. This, however,\r\nled him to impose a tax on race-horses (especially winners), to raise\r\nthe licence for shooting from one guinea to two guineas, to increase\r\nthe postage for letters, and to curtail the privileges of franking\r\nletters by Members of Parliament. This had been disgracefully abused.\r\nEvery member of both Houses had the right both of sending and of\r\nreceiving letters free. As if this were not sufficient, in days when a\r\nshilling was an ordinary charge for the receiver of a letter, several\r\nmembers were known to sell envelopes which they had franked; and a\r\nlarge firm is said to have paid a member £300 a year for franking their\r\ncorrespondence. Pitt struck at these abuses by requiring that franked\r\nletters must bear the name of the member, the date, and the post town\r\nfrom which the letter was to be sent. By this and other restrictions\r\na leakage which had amounted to nearly £200,000 a year was stopped,\r\nat least in part. The notion that every Member of Parliament ought\r\nto enjoy privileges which were withheld from the many was so deeply\r\nrooted that the abuses of “franking” persisted up to the time of the\r\ncomplete abolition of the privilege in 1840, when penny postage became\r\nthe law of the land. Thus in January 1802 we find a distinguished\r\ndiplomatist, Sir George Jackson, commiserating his sister on the\r\nscarcity of noblemen in Bath, which implied “a dearth of _frank-men_ to\r\nfly to.”\r\n\r\nThe effort to curb the abuses of that hateful class privilege forms\r\nthe best feature of Pitt’s Budget of 1784. In other respects it is\r\nnot remarkable. The new imposts have none of the merits attending his\r\nCommutation Act for the repression of smuggling. What is surprising is\r\nthat he did not try the experiment of increasing the House Duty, an\r\nimpost which fell mainly upon the rich, was easy to collect, and could\r\nbe made very remunerative.[241] It was actually tried by North in 1778,\r\napparently because it had borne good results in Holland.[242] Thus, the\r\nmachinery was at hand, and only needed to be more strenuously worked.\r\nI have failed to find in the Pitt Papers the reason why the statesman\r\ndid not try this expedient; still less why he imposed the niggling and\r\nirritating little taxes named above. He estimated the yield of the\r\nduties on bricks, paper, and hackney coaches at no more than £50,000,\r\n£18,000, and £12,000 respectively. Further, the tax on candles, though\r\nonly of one halfpenny the pound, was certainly burdensome to the poor.\r\nOn the whole, it is not surprising that a rhymester thus set forth the\r\ncondition of John Bull:\r\n\r\n  One would think there’s not room one new impost to put\r\n  From the crown of the head to the sole of the foot.\r\n  Like Job, thus John Bull his condition deplores,\r\n  Very patient, indeed, and all covered with sores.\r\n\r\nOther persons of a quasi-scientific turn sought comfort in the\r\nreflection that taxation ought, like the air, to press on the\r\nindividual at all points in order not to be felt.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Pitt’s financial genius matured slowly. Possibly he thought\r\nthe situation too serious to admit of doubtful experiments. Certainly\r\nhe went step by step, as is seen by reference to his next Budget. Its\r\nmost significant feature was the endeavour to simplify the collection\r\nof taxes. Hitherto there had been much overlapping and consequent waste\r\nof effort, owing to the existence of three Boards or Committees. The\r\nExcise Department managed the taxes on carriages, wagons, carts, and\r\nmale-servants; the new taxes on horses and race-horses were under the\r\nCommissioners of Stamps; while separate Commissioners administered the\r\nimposts on houses and windows. In place of this complex, expensive,\r\nand inefficient machinery, Pitt instituted a single “Board for Taxes,”\r\nwhich supervised affairs more cheaply and left few loopholes for\r\nevasion. The imposts named above were thenceforth termed “the assessed\r\ntaxes.”[243] In that year he also imposed taxes on female servants,\r\nshops, and attorneys. Here again his fiscal policy distinctly belonged\r\nto the old order of things, when men, despairing of finding any\r\nwidespread and very lucrative tax, grumblingly submitted to duties\r\non every article of consumption and every important action of life.\r\nThe days of a few simple and highly productive taxes had not fully\r\ndawned.[244] The sequel will show that, only under the intolerable\r\npressure of the long war with France, did Pitt work his way to the\r\nIncome Tax; and the terms in which he replied to the Lord Provost of\r\nGlasgow, who in March 1798 recommended that impost, show that, while\r\nalways favouring it on theoretical grounds, he doubted the possibility\r\nof collecting it systematically.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 we are still in the age of youthful hopes and experiments.\r\nWe find Pitt writing to Wilberforce on the last day of September:\r\n“The produce of our revenues is glorious, and I am half mad with a\r\nproject which will give our supplies the effect almost of magic in\r\nthe reduction of debt.”[245] Equally hopeful is his letter to Lord\r\nBuckingham on 8th November, in which he speaks of the rise of stocks\r\nbeing fully justified by the splendid surplus of “£800,000 per annum at\r\nleast. The little that is wanting to make good the complete million may\r\nbe had with ease.”[246] Both references are to the plan of a Sinking\r\nFund which was to work wonders with the National Debt, blotting it out\r\nin two or three generations by the alchemy of compound interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plan of a Sinking Fund was not wholly his, although it came to\r\nbear Pitt’s name. Walpole, early in his career, had started a scheme\r\nwhereby a certain sum was annually set apart for forming a fund which\r\nwould accumulate by compound interest and finally be available for the\r\nextinction of the National Debt. This plan came to grief, because in\r\n1732 Walpole began to draw on his own fund rather than increase the\r\nLand Tax and annoy country gentlemen. This, we may note, is one of\r\nthe perils of a Sinking Fund that, guard it as its founder may, some\r\nthriftless Chancellor of the Exchequer will insist on filching from it.\r\nThat was the fate of Walpole’s fund. The scheme, however, survived,\r\nand received a new impulse in 1772, when Dr. Price, a Nonconformist\r\nminister, called public attention to it by a pamphlet on the National\r\nDebt. In this he proved by irrefutable arithmetic that a Sinking Fund,\r\nif honestly worked, must ultimately wipe out the largest debt that can\r\nbe conceived. For, as he hopefully pointed out, a single seed, if its\r\nproduce could be entirely set apart for sowing, would in course of time\r\nmultiply so vastly as to fill all the lands where it could grow. This\r\nis true; but the simile implies singular powers of self-control in the\r\nsowers, especially if they are beset by hunger before that glorious\r\nclimax is attained. Descending to the more practical domain of the\r\nmoney market, Price proved that a sum of £200,000, set apart annually,\r\ntogether with its compound interest, would in eighty-six years be worth\r\n£258,000,000. Whether the nation were at peace or at war, said Dr.\r\nPrice, the stipulated sum must be set aside, even if it were borrowed\r\nat a high rate of interest; for the nation borrowed at simple interest\r\nin order to gain the advantages of compound interest. While admitting\r\nthe folly of such conduct for a private individual, he maintained with\r\nequal _naïveté_ that a State must benefit by it, even if there were no\r\nsurplus of revenue and if money were dear.[247]\r\n\r\nSuch was the scheme which fired Pitt with hope; but it is very\r\nquestionable whether he accepted all its details. Certainly he did not\r\nact precipitately. On 11th April 1785 he felt the pulse of the House\r\nof Commons by stating his confident hope of having a surplus of one\r\nmillion available for the present plan, and his determination next\r\nyear to found “a real Sinking Fund” on a basis which would absolutely\r\npreclude pilfering in the future. It is also noteworthy that he\r\nresolved to raise that million by taxation, not by borrowing. This\r\nis a fact which has been ignored by Hamilton, McCulloch, Lecky, and\r\nother critics of Pitt’s experiment; but the debate just referred to and\r\nthose soon to be considered place it beyond possibility of denial. Mr.\r\nDempster urged him to begin at once, even if he had to borrow, seeing\r\nthat France had started a Sinking Fund which “would enable her in a few\r\nyears to get rid of the greatest part of her National Debt.” But the\r\nPrime Minister declined to be hurried, especially if he had to borrow\r\nat a high rate of interest.[248] Clearly, then, Pitt did not share the\r\nextravagant hopes of Price.\r\n\r\nHis relations to Price cannot be wholly cleared up. Early in January\r\n1786 he wrote to him in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    The situation of the revenue certainly makes this the time to\r\n    establish an effectual Sinking Fund. The general idea of converting\r\n    the 3 per cents with a fund bearing a higher rate of interest,\r\n    with a view to facilitate redemption, you have on many occasions\r\n    suggested, and particularly in the papers you were so good as to\r\n    send me last year. The rise of the stocks has made a material\r\n    change since that period, and I am inclined to think something\r\n    like the plan I now send you may be more adapted to the present\r\n    circumstances.[249] There may be, I believe, some inaccuracies in\r\n    the calculations, but not such as to be very material. Before I\r\n    form any decisive opinion, I wish to learn your sentiments upon it,\r\n    and shall think myself obliged to you for any improvement you can\r\n    suggest if you think the principle a right one, or for any other\r\n    proposal which from your knowledge of the subject you may think\r\n    preferable.\r\n\r\nWith his reply Price sent the three alternative plans which the curious\r\nmay peruse in his “Memoir and Works.” Unfortunately the ten volumes\r\nconsecrated to his fame by his nephew, William Morgan, are instinct\r\nwith so bitter a prejudice against Pitt as to be worthless on all\r\nquestions affecting him. Morgan does not print Pitt’s proposal, but\r\nbrushes it aside as puerile, and gives the impression that Price did\r\nso; he gives no account of the interview which Pitt had with Price in\r\nthe middle of January, but asserts that the Minister threw aside his\r\nown proposals, adopted the third and least efficient of Price’s plans,\r\nmangled it in the process, and never acknowledged his debt to his\r\nbenefactor.[250] The first of these charges can be refuted by Price’s\r\nreply to Pitt’s letter given above. He pronounced the Prime Minister’s\r\nproposals “very just,” but pointed out some defects, especially the\r\nproviso which placed the Sinking Fund at the disposal of Parliament\r\nwhen the interest on it amounted to £4,000,000, as he expected it would\r\nby the year 1812.[251] Morgan’s unfairness is further revealed by his\r\nstatement that Pitt did not choose to increase the taxes in 1786 so as\r\nto provide the million surplus which ought to have been forthcoming.\r\nWhereas the fact is that in the Budget of 1785 the Minister imposed\r\ntaxes for that very purpose; and when these proved scarcely sufficient,\r\nhe imposed others on 29th March 1786.[252]\r\n\r\nFalse and acrid charges such as these do not surprise us in the\r\npartisan biographies of that age. What is surprising is that McCulloch\r\nand Lecky should have endorsed some of Morgan’s statements, especially\r\nrespecting Pitt’s omission of his acknowledgements to Price.[253] On\r\nthis I must observe, firstly, that it is not proven that Pitt owed\r\nto Price everything that was good in his Sinking Fund, and spoiled\r\nthe plan by his own alterations of it; for the omission of Pitt’s\r\nproposal by Morgan leaves us without means of comparing the original\r\nproposals of the two men; secondly, that the official reports of the\r\nthree debates of the spring of 1786 on this subject are so meagre as to\r\nfurnish no decisive evidence on what was, after all, a minor detail.\r\nFurther, it is probable that Price’s influence on Pitt’s proposal was\r\nless than has been supposed. In the Pitt Papers is a letter of Pulteney\r\nto Pitt dated 18th April 1786, in which he urges him carefully to\r\nreconsider Price’s third plan before finally adopting it. He states\r\nthat Sir John Sinclair, Sir Edward Ferguson, Mr. Beaufoy, and Mr.\r\nDempster had yesterday met Dr. Price at Bath House in order to discuss\r\nthe merits of Price’s plan, and also one by Mr. Gale. The discussion\r\nleft Pulteney with the conviction that Gale’s plan was “infinitely\r\npreferable to any of the three produced by Dr. Price,” and he begged\r\nPitt to add it to his Bill as an alternative.[254] I have not found\r\na copy of Gale’s plan or any evidence as to its adoption in part by\r\nPitt; but the statesman certainly repudiated the notion of borrowing\r\nin order to pay off debt, on which Price had laid stress. And yet by\r\na strange irony of fate, this expedient, to which the statesman had\r\ntemporary recourse only under the strain of war, is that which has been\r\npronounced by nearly all critics the characteristic part of his scheme.\r\n\r\nThe chief features of Pitt’s proposals were his efforts to raise the\r\nwhole of the annual million from revenue, and to safeguard this fund\r\nfrom the depredations of wasteful financiers in the future.[255] He\r\ntherefore placed it under the control of six responsible persons, among\r\nwhom were the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank\r\nof England. The disposal by Parliament of the fund when the yearly\r\nincome arising from it should amount to four millions, may be termed a\r\nconcession of the financier to the parliamentary spirit.\r\n\r\nThe scheme met merely with indirect criticism, the debates turning\r\non general policy, or on the question whether there was a surplus of\r\na million, or any surplus at all. These were the issues to which the\r\neager partisanship of Fox and Sheridan sought to divert the attention\r\nof the House. Let them beware, exclaimed Fox, of tying up a sum of a\r\nmillion a year, when they might want all their available resources for\r\na war. As for Sheridan, he sought to ridicule the experiment, not on\r\nfinancial grounds, but because it was the height of folly to add to the\r\npresent enormous burdens when “we had but one foe, and that the whole\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been in these debates no reference to Dr. Price’s\r\nschemes, though they then enjoyed considerable notoriety. Mention was\r\nmade of the writings of Baron Maseres on the efficacy of Compound\r\nInterest; but the Opposition confined itself almost entirely to\r\ncomplaints about the taxes, and gloomy prophecies about the advent of\r\nanother war. Surely some member of that angry and disappointed group\r\nwould have accused Pitt of filching his scheme wholesale from that of\r\nPrice, if the charge had been possible. We can imagine that Sheridan,\r\ninstead of croaking over the impending coalition of Europe against\r\nEngland, would in that case have declaimed against Pitt as the thief\r\nof the magic wand of the real Prospero of finance. Would not Fox also\r\nhave brought his sound and sturdy sense to the congenial task of\r\nexposing the fallacies of Price and the imposture of Pitt? The darling\r\nof Brooks’s Club, who well knew the perils of borrowing in order to\r\npay off old debts, would have fastened on the folly of borrowing at\r\nhigh rates in order to gain the advantage of Compound Interest. We\r\ncan picture him asking how a plan, which was admittedly foolish for\r\nan individual, could be profitable for a nation, and where the taxes\r\ncould be raised that would make good the interest on the sums set apart\r\nevery year for the wonder-working fund. Surely the Opposition was not\r\nso ignorant of finance and of Price’s proposals as not to detect the\r\nweakness of the Prime Minister’s plan, had it been modelled solely on\r\nthem.[256]\r\n\r\nThe debates in which the Commons dealt with this great and complex\r\nsubject seem to have been fruitful only in personalities. At the final\r\nstage of the Bill, however, Fox moved an amendment with the aim of\r\nlightening the burdens on the nation in time of war. He proposed that,\r\nwhenever a new loan should be raised, the Minister should be pledged to\r\nraise moneys sufficient to pay the interest on the loan, and also to\r\nmake good to the Sinking Fund what might be taken from it. He stated as\r\na concrete example that, if a new loan of £6,000,000 were required in\r\ntime of war, and if £1,000,000 were in the hands of the Commissioners\r\nof the National Debt, that sum should be transferred to the account of\r\nthe loan; for this, he claimed, would save the public the expense of\r\nraising that million through bankers and the Stock Exchange, and the\r\nSinking Fund would not be injured if the million temporarily borrowed\r\nfrom it were made good by taxation. His speech contained one statement\r\nof personal interest, namely, that he had shown his proposal to the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, who approved of it. This, then, was one\r\nof the few occasions on which Pitt conferred with Fox. He now accepted\r\nFox’s amendment, because (to take the supposed case), apart from the\r\nsaving of commission on the million, Government would be able to raise\r\nthe five millions on better terms than the six millions. Pitt also\r\nexpressed the hope that the addition of the amendment to his Bill would\r\ndo away with all temptation to a Minister to rob the Sinking Fund.[257]\r\n\r\nThis last argument cut both ways. As Earl Stanhope (formerly Lord\r\nMahon) pointed out to the Lords, when he introduced a rival scheme a\r\nfew days later, it would be absurd to lessen the temptation to commit\r\nan offence which he (Pitt) had declared to be thenceforth impossible.\r\nIn fact, the permission to transfer the yearly million to another fund\r\nrather tended to strengthen the argument for alienation in any other\r\ncase where expediency might be urged. Stanhope’s plan for rendering the\r\nSinking Fund permanent is too complex to be discussed here; the debates\r\non it were closed by the royal assent being given to Pitt’s measure on\r\n26th May.[258]\r\n\r\nIf we examine carefully the many criticisms that have been levelled\r\nagainst Pitt’s Sinking Fund, they apply only to his handling of the\r\nfund during the Great War with France. Every sciolist in finance can\r\nnow see the folly of borrowing money at a high rate of interest in\r\norder to provide the fund with its quarterly supply.[259] It is clearly\r\na case of feeding a dog on his own tail. But such a proceeding, though\r\nlauded by Price, was quite contrary to Pitt’s original intention, which\r\nwas the thoroughly sound one of paying off debt by a steady application\r\nof the annual surplus. He departed from this only under stress of\r\ncircumstances which he looked on as exceptional and temporary.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, even the officials of the Treasury seem to have\r\noverlooked the fact that the nation was thereby increasing its debt\r\nin a cumbrous attempt to lessen it. In 1799, when the pinch caused by\r\nthe withdrawal of a million a year was severely felt, George Rose,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, praised the Sinking Fund as an example\r\nof integrity and economy which must in the highest degree promote the\r\nprosperity of the nation. And Lord Henry Petty, who succeeded Pitt as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, stated in his first Budget Speech in March\r\n1806 that “it was owing to the institution of the Sinking Fund that the\r\ncountry was not charged with a much larger amount of debt. It was an\r\nadvantage gained by nothing.” This extraordinary statement, coming from\r\na political opponent, shows how that generation was mesmerized by the\r\npotency of Compound Interest.\r\n\r\nYet, delusive as the scheme came to be, it conferred two benefits on\r\nGreat Britain. Firstly, it tended to the reduction of the National Debt\r\nduring the time of peace. Nearly eleven millions were written off in\r\nthe years 1784–1792;[260] and the country felt no inconvenience until\r\nthe million had to be borrowed at ruinous rates. But, far more than\r\nthis, faith in the Sinking Fund buoyed up British credit at a time\r\nwhen confidence was the first essential of the public safety. In the\r\ndark days of 1797 and 1805 Britons were nerved by the spirit of their\r\nleader, who never quailed even in face of mutiny, disaster, and the\r\nnear approach of bankruptcy. There are times when unjustifiable trust\r\nis better than the most searching scrutiny. Finally, it is the barest\r\njustice to the memory of Pitt to remember that his whole financial\r\npolicy in the early part of the Great War rested on the assumption that\r\nFrance would soon be overborne; and, as we shall see, that assumption\r\nwas justified by the experience of the past and by every outward sign\r\nin her present life. It was the incalculable element in the French\r\nRevolution, from the _levée en masse_ of 1793 down to Austerlitz in\r\n1805, which baffled Pitt and metamorphosed his Sinking Fund into a load\r\nof lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nREFORM\r\n\r\n  Unblest by Virtue, Government a league\r\n  Becomes, a circling junto of the great\r\n  To rob by law; Religion mild, a yoke\r\n  To tame the stooping soul, a trick of State\r\n  To mask their rapine, and to share their prey.\r\n\r\n                                 THOMSON, _Liberty_.\r\n\r\n    The distempers of monarchy were the great subjects of apprehension\r\n    and redress in the last century; in this, the distempers of\r\n    Parliament.--BURKE, _Thoughts on the present Discontents_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experience of statesmen has generally led them to link together the\r\nquestion of retrenchment with that of Reform. The connection between\r\nthese two topics indeed lies in the nature of things. The brunt of\r\ntaxation has in the past fallen on the middle and artisan classes; and\r\nwhere they have only a small share in the government, the spending\r\ndepartments are apt to run riot. Under an oligarchy or plutocracy\r\nthe Government is likely to become a close preserve for the benefit\r\nof landless younger sons, the preservation of great estates being\r\nthus assured by means which lower the public services to the level\r\nof eleemosynary institutions. Whenever the mass of taxpayers gains\r\npolitical power, it will insist on efficiency and economy; or, at the\r\nworst, it will claim that the unprivileged shall also have an entry\r\ninto the domain of Government. In either case, the result will be not\r\nunlike that which happens in a household where the husband sleepily\r\npays and the wife lavishly spends. When the rude awakening comes, the\r\nspending department will probably yield to the power that holds the\r\npurse. The _ultima ratio_ of husbands and Parliaments is, after all,\r\nmuch the same. On the other hand, if the House of Commons represents\r\nlittle more than the rent-receiving classes, what hope is there that\r\nit will draw the purse strings? Whence it comes about that economists\r\nhave for the most part pleaded for a truly representative system.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Pitt had twice brought forward the question of the\r\nReform of Parliament, and had twice suffered defeat. The need of\r\ncaution was obvious; and this explains his conduct in begging that\r\nveteran reformer, Alderman Sawbridge, not to press his motion on this\r\nsubject in the short session of May–August 1784. The Prime Minister,\r\nhowever, promised to bring it before the House of Commons early in the\r\nfollowing session.[261] Some surprise was therefore felt on the opening\r\nday, 25th January 1785, when the King’s Speech contained no promise\r\nmore definite than that he would concur in every measure which would\r\n“secure the true principles of the constitution.”[262] Pitt himself,\r\nwhile admitting that the King’s Speech might in that House be assumed\r\nto be the speech of the chief Minister, stated that it was impossible\r\nto include in it a reference to that topic. The inference was obvious,\r\nthat the King objected to its inclusion in the speech.\r\n\r\nFor Pitt’s interest in the subject certainly had not cooled. In the\r\nspring of 1784 he had assured the Rev. Christopher Wyvill and the\r\nYorkshire Association of his devotion to the cause in the following as\r\nyet unpublished letter.\r\n\r\n                                        London, March 11, 1784.[263]\r\n\r\n    GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n    I consider myself greatly obliged to you for the favour of your\r\n    letter, which I received upon the 6th instant. I beg leave to\r\n    assure you that my zeal for Reform in Parliament is by no means\r\n    abated, and that I will ever exert my best endeavours to accomplish\r\n    that important object.\r\n\r\n                                                   (Signed) W. PITT.\r\n\r\nFurther, on 27th December 1784 he stated to Wyvill his intention to\r\nbring forward a Reform Bill as early as possible in the next session,\r\nand that he would “exert his whole power and credit _as a man, and as\r\na minister, honestly and boldly_, to carry such a meliorated system of\r\nrepresentation as may place the constitution on a footing of permanent\r\nsecurity.”[264] This at least was the version of his words which Wyvill\r\nat once circulated to Reform Committees throughout the country. With\r\na belated access of prudence, he added a postscript, urging that it\r\nmust in no case be published; but some foolish friend or wise opponent\r\nbruited it abroad, with the result that members of the House now\r\ncontrasted his eagerness for Reform with his inability to secure any\r\nmention of it in the King’s Speech. He might declare that the subject\r\nwas the nearest to his heart, and that nothing but its complexity\r\nprevented him sketching an outline of his proposal; but members drew\r\ntheir own conclusions. North made a skilful use of Wyvill’s letter, but\r\nelicited from Pitt no definite disclaimer of the words quoted from it.\r\nIndeed Pitt afterwards assured Wyvill that those words well expressed\r\nhis thoughts.[265]\r\n\r\nPitt judged that it would be best to proceed circumspectly in the\r\nmatter of Reform, perhaps because he wished the affair of Wyvill’s\r\nletter to blow over, or because he had obstacles to face in his\r\nCabinet. Owing to these or other causes he decided to give precedence\r\nto his resolutions for according greater freedom of trade to Ireland,\r\nwhich will be dealt with in another chapter; and not until 18 April\r\n1785 did he bring before Parliament the subject of parliamentary\r\nReform. The delay was unfortunate, for the trading classes were by this\r\ntime ruffled by proposals which promised to bring in the products of\r\nIrish cheap labour.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pitt drew up a draft scheme of Reform and sent it to Wyvill\r\nfor his perusal. He proposed to set aside a sum of somewhat more than\r\n£1,000,000 in order to indemnify electors in nomination boroughs,\r\nprovided that two-thirds of their total number should agree to forego\r\ntheir right of sending members to Parliament. In that case the borough\r\nshould be disfranchised, the electors receiving compensation by a\r\nParliamentary Committee after due examination of their claims. The\r\nseats thus vacated were to be added to counties or to districts of the\r\nlarger counties. Pitt also hinted at the enfranchisement of certain\r\nsuburban areas of London, and suggested that notoriously corrupt\r\nboroughs (such as Shoreham and Cricklade) should be disfranchised\r\nwithout compensation, their electoral powers being transferred to\r\ncounties. He further proposed to widen the county franchise by\r\nadmitting copyholders of 40 shillings a year and leaseholders whose\r\nleases had a certain term yet to run.[266]\r\n\r\nThese suggestions strike us as strangely cramped, except in the matter\r\nof copyholds, which were dealt with more generously than in Earl Grey’s\r\nBill of 1831. The proposals for disfranchising the pocket boroughs\r\nresemble a political auction, Pitt dangling a million before the\r\npotwallers of Gatton, Grampound, Castle Rising, etc., as the sole means\r\nof endowing the great counties with political power, and of enabling\r\nManchester, Birmingham, Leeds, and Sheffield to find articulate\r\nutterance. Wyvill in 1797 noted that these towns formed a part of\r\nPitt’s scheme of enfranchisement; but the Prime Minister does not seem\r\nin 1785 to have ventured distinctly to formulate so revolutionary a\r\nproposal. In the draft of a preamble to his Bill he suggested the\r\nadvisability of enlarging the electorate in the case of several towns\r\nsuch as Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Winchester, where the Corporation or\r\nthe Guild Merchant alone returned the members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThese draft proposals reveal the caution, not to say nervousness, with\r\nwhich Pitt approached this great subject; and the same characteristics\r\nappear in the speech of 18th April 1785 in which he introduced his\r\nmeasure. While lacking glow and enthusiasm, it was instinct with\r\nmoderation and persuasiveness. He started with the assumption that\r\nthe House of Commons ought to be “an Assembly freely elected, between\r\nwhom and the mass of the people there was the closest union and most\r\nperfect sympathy”; but he proceeded to allay the fears of those who,\r\nlike Burke, saw in any change a death-blow to the constitution, by\r\ndisclaiming “vague and unlimited notions.” He desired, he said,\r\n“a sober and practicable scheme which should have for its basis\r\nthe original principle of representation.” He then showed how that\r\nprinciple had been warped by time and Court intrigues. Sometimes method\r\nwas discoverable, and he cited a case that occurred shortly after\r\nthe Restoration when, after the disfranchisement of 72 boroughs, 36\r\nof them regained their rights on petition, but the 36 others, having\r\ndecreased in size, remained without representatives. Therefore, by\r\nthe discretionary powers of the Crown to grant, or to withhold,\r\nrepresentation, there was a clear recognition of the principle that\r\nthe chief towns, not the decayed towns, should return members to\r\nParliament. Who, he asked, was the truer supporter of the constitution?\r\nHe who sought to preserve the mere form of it, or he who preferred its\r\nsubstance and essence to the empty shell? Coming next to the outlines\r\nof his scheme, he declared that he would change neither the proportion\r\nof Scottish to English members, as settled by the Act of Union of 1707,\r\nnor the numbers of the House. All that he aimed at for the present was\r\nto disenfranchise 36 decayed boroughs and to assign their 72 members\r\nto the counties which most needed a larger representation, as also to\r\nLondon and Westminster.\r\n\r\nModeration such as this implies timidity. Moreover this was not\r\nall. As we have seen, Pitt did not intend to carry out this reform\r\nby compulsion; and he now declared that, recognizing as he did the\r\nmonetary value of the franchises of these decayed boroughs, he proposed\r\nto form a fund whence they might gain compensation for this undoubted\r\nloss. Very skilfully he introduced this novel proposal by deprecating\r\nthe “squeamish and maiden coyness” which members affected in speaking\r\nthere on a topic which they frankly discussed outside the House. For\r\nhimself he faced the fact that the right of returning two members to\r\nParliament had a certain monetary value, and he therefore offered a\r\ndue indemnity. Further, if in the future any other decayed borough\r\nshould wish to surrender its franchise “on an adequate consideration,”\r\nhe proposed to facilitate such a surrender, and to allot the two\r\nseats to any district or town that seemed most to need the franchise.\r\nFinally he desired to widen the electorate in the counties by including\r\ncopyholders, whose property was as secure as, sometimes more secure\r\nthan, that of the freeholders.[267]\r\n\r\nSuch were the proposals. They were brought forward at a time when Pitt\r\nhad suffered in the opinion of the House, first by his obstinacy in\r\npersevering with the Westminster election scrutiny, and, secondly,\r\nby the Irish Commercial Resolutions. Members were therefore in an\r\nunsettled state of mind, and an eye-witness describes them as listening\r\nto the Prime Minister “with that sort of civil attention which people\r\ngive to a person who has a good claim to be heard, but with whom the\r\nhearers are determined to disagree.” The same witness, Daniel Pulteney,\r\nfound that most of Pitt’s friends “lamented that he would not keep\r\nclear of this absurd business--this Yorkshire system of Reform.”[268]\r\n\r\nDespite this chilling reception, Pitt set forth his proposals “with the\r\nattractions of a most seductive eloquence.” Such is the testimony of\r\nWraxall, which by itself would tend to refute the venomous assertion\r\nthat Pitt was not in earnest. The contrary is proved by his words and\r\ndeeds. At Christmastide 1784 he begged Wilberforce to return from the\r\nsouth of France in order to work in the cause of Reform; and on 12th\r\nJanuary 1785 he wrote to the Duke of Rutland in these terms: “I really\r\nthink that I see more than ever the chance of effecting a safe and\r\ntemperate plan [of Reform], and I think its success as essential to the\r\ncredit, if not to the stability, of the present administration, as it\r\nis to the good government of the country hereafter.”[269] Further, it\r\nis certain that those ardent reformers, Robert Smith (afterwards Lord\r\nCarrington) and Wyvill, had no doubt of his earnestness. The latter\r\nstated in his letters that Pitt was striving his hardest to arouse\r\ninterest in the Reform of Parliament.[270]\r\n\r\nThere is also ground for thinking that the King had privately assured\r\nhim that, though he regretted his advocacy of Reform, no word of his\r\nshould influence any one against that measure. Wraxall, who voted\r\nagainst Pitt, admits that his plan of Reform was highly attractive in\r\ntheory--a phrase which leaves us wondering what would have been the\r\npractical scheme of reform after which this earth-born soul was dimly\r\ngroping.[271] Even Burke, who saw mortal danger to the body politic in\r\nthe removal of the smallest rag of antiquity, complimented the Minister\r\non the skill with which he had sought to make the change palateable to\r\nall parties. None the less did that fervid Celt consider the whole plan\r\nan _ignis fatuus_, calculated to mislead and bewilder. Herein Burke for\r\nonce voiced the feelings of the country gentry who thought the fate of\r\nthe constitution bound up with the maintenance of the rotten boroughs.\r\nThe speeches of Duncombe and Wilberforce in support of the measure\r\nwere poor and rambling. Dundas, an unwilling convert to Reform, had\r\nnothing better to say than that he highly approved the principle of\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThe chief arguments against the measure were those of North, Fox, and\r\nBankes. The first declared that the country cared not a jot for Reform.\r\nBirmingham had not petitioned for it. One of the members for Suffolk,\r\nwho sought advice from his constituents, had received no instructions\r\nfrom them. The effort to get up a Reform meeting in London had resulted\r\nin the attendance of only three hundred persons; and the outcome of\r\nsimilar efforts in the provinces might be summed up in the line from\r\n“The Rehearsal”:\r\n\r\n  What horrid sound of _silence_ doth assail mine ear?\r\n\r\nAs for Fox, though he voted with Pitt, he did his best to defeat the\r\nmeasure. He wittily explained the silence of the people by their alarm\r\nat Pitt’s Irish Resolutions; for when on the point of emigrating\r\nfrom a land on the brink of ruin, why should they trouble about\r\nits constitution? Further, he stoutly objected to the award of any\r\nindemnity to the owners of pocket boroughs. The same point was shrewdly\r\npressed by Bankes. The measure, he said, was absurd on the face of\r\nit. For why declare against the whole principle of the traffic in\r\nsuch boroughs, and yet proceed to allow liberal compensation to the\r\ntraffickers? The argument was more clever than sound, as appeared in\r\n1834 when Parliament awarded £20,000,000 to slave-owners. The taunt\r\nalso came with an ill grace from the owner and representative of Corfe\r\nCastle; but it cut Pitt to the quick. He immediately arose and avowed\r\nthat the remark wounded him deeply on account of his long friendship\r\nwith the speaker; the point touched was a tender one; but the evil\r\nwas such that it must be cured, and it could be cured in no other way\r\nthan the present. And so, in this mood of “Et tu, Brute,” Pitt and\r\nhis friends withdrew into the lobby, and soon learned that his third\r\nattempt to redress the glaring ills of the representation had been\r\ndefeated by 248 votes to 174.\r\n\r\nThe blow was crushing and final as regards Parliamentary Reform in that\r\nage. The storms of the French Revolution and the mightier subterranean\r\nforces of the Industrial Revolution were to work upon the old order\r\nof things before the governing classes of England were brought to see\r\nthe need of renovation; and when the change came in 1832, it was not\r\nuntil the nation had drawn near to the verge of civil war. In 1785 the\r\ntransition would have been peaceful and progressive. Pitt was content\r\nto work by permissive methods, and to leave open the decision as to\r\nwhich of the rising industrial towns should gain the franchise as it\r\nwas sold by the decaying boroughs. Such a mode of advance seems to us\r\nthat of a snail, and marked by a trail of slime. But we must remember\r\nthat the brains of that generation worked very slowly on political\r\nquestions; for in truth they had to do with a society which was to\r\nours almost as a lake is to a torrent. Further, it is noteworthy that\r\nthe offer to buy out the pocket boroughs was the chief recommendation\r\nof Pitt’s measure to the House of Commons. Burke praised him for thus\r\ngilding his pill; and Dundas’s chief plea for the measure was that\r\nit did not outrage “the sacred inheritance of property.” Alone among\r\nPitt’s supporters Bankes reprobated these bartering methods. The\r\nattitude of the House should be remembered, as it bears on the question\r\nhow far Pitt was justified in buying off the opposition of the Irish\r\nborough-holders and others who suffered by the Act of Union of 1800.\r\n\r\nCould Pitt have taken any further steps to ensure the passing of his\r\nReform Bill? Mr. Lecky, followed in this by lesser historians, has\r\nmaintained the affirmative. He avers that, by making it a ministerial\r\nmeasure, Pitt could have brought to bear on it all the influence of\r\nparty discipline.[272] To this it may be replied that Pitt’s majority,\r\nthough large, was very independent. As will appear in the next chapter,\r\nwe find him writing that he could not then count on the support of many\r\nof his followers from one day to another. They had floated together\r\nfrom the wreckage of the Fox and North parties, and had as yet gained\r\nno distinct cohesion, except such as arose from admiration of him.\r\nFurther, he strained this feeling too severely in the session of 1785\r\nby his harsh treatment of Fox over the Westminster election, and by\r\npressing on three unpopular measures, namely, the Irish Resolutions\r\n(22nd February), the fortification of Portsmouth and Plymouth (14th\r\nMarch), and Parliamentary Reform (18th April). Sooner or later he\r\nsuffered defeat on all these proposals. Yet it is clear that his\r\nfollowers did not intend to drive him from office, but merely to teach\r\nhim caution. In this they succeeded only too well. Thereafter he acted\r\nfar more warily; and, except in the Warren Hastings’ case, and in the\r\nFrench Commercial Treaty, he for some time showed little of that power\r\nof initiative which marked the early part of the session of 1785. The\r\nfact is to be regretted; but the need of caution is manifest when we\r\nremember that a single irretrievable blunder would have entailed a\r\nFox-North Ministry with all the discords and confusion that must have\r\ncome in its train. Even zealous reformers, while regretting that Pitt\r\ndid not persevere with Reform, continued to prefer him to Fox and\r\nNorth. This appears in a letter written by Major Cartwright at the\r\nclose of the year 1788. On the news of the mental derangement of George\r\nIII, that veteran reformer wrote to Wilberforce: “I very much fear that\r\nthe King’s present derangement is likely to produce other derangements\r\nnot for the public benefit. I hope we are not to be sold to the\r\nCoalition faction. Mr. Fox is, I see, arrived, and cabal, I doubt not,\r\nis labouring with redoubled zeal under his direction to overturn the\r\npresent Government.”[273] The distrust felt for Fox after his union\r\nwith North survived in full force even in 1788. Their accession to\r\npower, and the triumph of the Prince of Wales, were looked on as the\r\nworst of all political evils. This, I repeat, explains and justifies\r\nthe determination of Pitt to continue in office.\r\n\r\nBut other reasons must also have influenced his decision to shelve\r\nthe question of Reform at least for the present. His Cabinet was too\r\ndivided on it to warrant his risking its existence on a proposal which\r\nhad always been rejected. The marvel was that a Prime Minister should\r\nbring it forward. Further, if we may judge from George III’s letter\r\nof 20th March, the active though secret opposition of the King was\r\naverted only by Pitt giving an unmistakable hint that he would resign\r\nif it were used against the measure.[274] Having secured the King’s\r\nneutrality, Pitt could hardly go further and leave his sovereign in the\r\nlurch by breaking up his Cabinet on a question on which he alone of the\r\nexecutive Government felt strongly.\r\n\r\nAnother possible alternative was that he himself should resign.\r\nBut this again would almost certainly have involved the fall of an\r\nAdministration of which he was the keystone. It is also noteworthy\r\nthat the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, whether collective\r\nor personal, had not then been definitely established. Cabinets and\r\nindividual Ministers resigned on points of honour, or when they held\r\nthat the Government could no longer be satisfactorily carried on.\r\nBut neither of these cases had arisen. The Government of the country\r\nobviously could go on as well as before. True, a legislative proposal\r\nof great importance had been rejected; but it cannot be too clearly\r\nstated that in that century the chief work of Government was to govern,\r\nnot to pass new laws. Far on in the next century the main business of a\r\nCabinet came to be the proposing and carrying through of new measures;\r\nbut this idea was foreign to that more stationary age; and probably\r\neveryone would have accused Pitt of deserting his post had he resigned\r\nowing to his inability to carry a legislative enactment of a very\r\ndebatable character. Walpole has not been blamed because he held to\r\noffice despite his failure to carry his very important Excise Bill.\r\n\r\nAgain, why should Pitt have persevered with the cause of Reform?\r\nDespite all the efforts of Wyvill and the Associations, only eight\r\npetitions had been sent up to the House in favour of it. The taunts\r\nof North as to the apathy of the country were unanswerable. No voice\r\nwas heard in protest against the rejection of the measure; and the\r\njudgement of Wilberforce was that of practically all reformers, that,\r\nafter Pitt’s failure, Reform was hopeless.[275] Wyvill himself, in\r\na pamphlet written amidst the excitements of 1793, admitted that\r\nPitt’s measure received little attention in 1785, and soon fell into\r\noblivion--a fact which he explained by the complete satisfaction which\r\nthe nation then felt with its new Ministry. Here we have the true\r\nexplanation, furnished by the man who had his hand on the nation’s\r\npulse. Wyvill saw that the practical character of the reforms already\r\ncarried by Pitt had reconciled the people even to rotten boroughs.\r\nHe also stated that the proposals of 1785 did not go far enough to\r\nsatisfy many reformers, but that they aroused the bitter hostility of\r\nthe boroughmongers. There, indeed, was the gist of the difficulty. The\r\nboroughmongers carried the House with them; and it was impossible at\r\nthat period to stir up a national enthusiasm which would brush aside\r\nthe fears of the timid and the sophistries of the corrupt. Only under\r\nthe overpowering impulse of 1832 could the House be brought to pass\r\nsentence against itself. Because Grey and Russell carried a Reform Bill\r\nnearly half a century later, is Pitt to be blamed for abandoning, after\r\nthe third attempt, a measure which aroused invincible opposition in\r\nParliament, and only the most languid interest in the nation at large?\r\n\r\nFurther, be it noted that the conduct of Fox had irretrievably damaged\r\nthe cause of Reform. His union with Lord North had split in twain\r\nthe party of progress; and we have the testimony of an ardent young\r\nreformer, Francis Place, that that unprincipled union dealt a death\r\nblow to the London Society for promoting Constitutional Information,\r\nthe last expiring effort of which was to publish a volume of political\r\ntracts in the year 1784.[276] Not until the year 1791 was this useful\r\nsociety revived, and then owing to the impulses set in motion by French\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is noteworthy that Pitt gave his support to a smaller\r\nmeasure of Reform brought forward in the session of 1786 by Earl\r\nStanhope. That nobleman had persuaded Wilberforce to widen the scope\r\nof a proposal which the member for Yorkshire had first designed for\r\nthat county alone. It provided for the registration of all freeholders\r\nand the holding of the poll in several places at the same time. Pitt\r\nspoke warmly for the Bill as tending to remedy the chief defects in\r\nthe county representation, and he expressed the hope that at some\r\nfuture time the whole of the representation would undergo the same\r\nimprovements (15th May). Despite the opposition of Grenville and Powys,\r\nleave was granted to bring in the measure by 98 votes to 22. Though\r\nStanhope emphatically declared in the Lords that the summary rejection\r\nof a Bill affecting the Commons would be an act of “unutterable\r\nindecency,” the Peers rejected the measure by 38 votes to 15.[277]\r\n\r\nThis was the last effort made by Pitt’s friends and supporters to\r\nimprove the old system. For the present, Reform had come to an\r\n_impasse_. Even practical little proposals which passed the Commons\r\nwere doomed to failure in the Lords; and it was clear that nothing\r\nshort of a convulsion would open up a passage. The events that followed\r\ntended to discredit the cause of progress. As will appear in Chapter\r\nXIV, the violence of the Dutch democrats threatened to wreck their\r\nconstitution, to degrade the position of the Prince of Orange, and to\r\nmake their country a footstool of the French monarchy. Pitt perforce\r\ntook the side of the Prince; and this question, together with the\r\ntorpor of the populace, served by degrees to detach the young statesman\r\nfrom uncompromising reformers like Stanhope and Wyvill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe defection or apathy of many of his friends in the session of 1785\r\nwas undoubtedly a severe blow to Pitt. It sounded the death-knell of\r\nhis earlier idealism, and led him on, somewhat dazed, to a time marked\r\nby compromise and a tendency to rely upon “influence.” Daniel Pulteney\r\nnoted, when he saw him in the park on the day following the rebuff,\r\nthat he was in deep sorrow.[278] That was natural in a man who had\r\nhoped to arouse the nation to a vivid interest in good government, and\r\nsuddenly found himself headed back to the old paths. The shock must\r\nhave been the greater as he had been guided by what I have termed his\r\nbookish outlook on life.\r\n\r\nPulteney, as a man of the world, pointed out to his patron, the Duke\r\nof Rutland, this defect in the young Prime Minister: “This system of\r\nPitt’s, to act upon general ideas of the propriety or wisdom of a\r\nmeasure, without attending enough to the means by which it can be best\r\nand most happily introduced--I mean, knowing the general opinion of the\r\nHouse at the time--must, I foresee, involve him in time in one or other\r\nof these difficulties,” namely, the rash introduction of a measure,\r\nor its abandonment through a sudden access of distrust. Again he says\r\nthat Pitt is very much “fettered in his conduct on great affairs. From\r\na very partial and confined knowledge of the world, he is too full\r\nof caution and suspicions where there does not exist the shadow of a\r\npretext for them; and, from having no immediate intercourse with the\r\ngenerality of the House of Commons here, he is as ignorant of their\r\nopinions on particular questions as if he was Minister of another\r\ncountry.” He then states that, when Pitt suddenly came to see the facts\r\nof the case, he was apt to be unduly despondent and to bring forward\r\nonly those questions on which he was sure of a majority. He concludes\r\nthat this habit of “acting only on abstract principles” would greatly\r\nembarrass him; but that he might expect long to continue in power,\r\nbecause “whenever he was to quit, I think no Ministry, not founded on\r\ncorruption, could stand against him.”[279]\r\n\r\nThis estimate, by a practical politician, though marked by a desire\r\nto depreciate Pitt and exalt the Duke of Rutland, goes far towards\r\nexplaining the symptoms of change which are thereafter noticeable\r\nin Pitt’s career. It shows us Pitt, not a superb parliamentarian\r\ndominating men and affairs from the outset, but rather an idealist,\r\nalmost a _doctrinaire_, who hoped to lead his majority at his will\r\nby the inspiring power of lofty principles, but now and again found\r\nthat he had to do, not with Humanity, but with humdrum men. We see\r\nhim in the midst of his upward gazings, disconcerted by the force of\r\nmaterial interests, and driven thenceforth to pay more attention to the\r\nprejudices of his party.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance among the expedients to which he was driven after\r\nthe spring of 1785 was the use of “influence.” As was shown in the\r\nIntroduction, that word, when used in a political sense, denoted the\r\nsystem of rewards or coercion whereby the King and his Prime Minister\r\nassured the triumph of their policy. Peerages, bishoprics, judgeships,\r\nmagistracies, sinecures and gaugerships, were the dainties held out\r\nby every Ministry in order to keep their sleek following close to\r\nheel and thin the ranks of the lean and hungry Opposition. Peerages\r\nalone counted for much; for we find Pitt writing, during the Fox-North\r\nMinistry of 1783, that the King’s determination not to create a single\r\npeer during their term of office must sooner or later be fatal to\r\nthem. Government by rewards and exclusions was looked upon as the\r\nnatural order of things; but up to the session of 1785 Pitt used\r\n“influence” sparingly. At a later date Wilberforce ventured on the\r\nvery questionable assertion that Pitt’s command over Parliament after\r\nthe General Election of 1784 was so great that he might have governed\r\nby “principle” and have dispensed with “influence.” He expressed,\r\nhowever, his admiration of him for refusing to associate with trading\r\npoliticians, a connection which, even in the hours of recreation, was\r\ncertain to bring defilement.[280]\r\n\r\nPitt, as we have seen, never stooped to associate with jobbers, but\r\nhe seems to have decided, after the severe rebuffs of February–April\r\n1785, to use “influence” more and more. We notice in his letters to the\r\nDuke of Rutland and Orde several injunctions as to the management of\r\nmembers in the Irish Parliament; and he sought to conciliate waverers\r\nby other means, such as the abandonment of those clauses of the Irish\r\nResolutions which were most obnoxious to British traders, and an almost\r\nlavish use of honours and places. This last expedient he adopted\r\nunwillingly; for on 19th July 1785 he wrote to the Duke of Rutland\r\nthat circumstances compelled him to recommend a larger addition to\r\nthe British peerage than he liked, and that he was very desirous not\r\nto increase it farther than was absolutely necessary.[281] This shows\r\nthat his hand was forced either by his colleagues or by the exigencies\r\nof the time. Possibly the promises of peerages had to be made in order\r\nto secure the passing of the Irish Resolutions even in their modified\r\nform. It is humiliating to reflect that this descent from a higher to a\r\nlower level of policy thenceforth secured him a majority which followed\r\nhis lead, except on the isolated questions of the fortification of\r\nPortsmouth and Plymouth, and of the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the\r\nlatter of which he left entirely open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to consider here the question of the\r\nfortification of the chief national dockyards, as it shows the\r\ndetermination of the Prime Minister to secure economy and efficiency in\r\nthe public services. As we have seen, his great aim was to carry out\r\na work of revival in every sphere of the nation’s life. When thwarted\r\nin one direction he did not relax his energies, but turned them into\r\nnew channels. On the rejection of the Irish Resolutions, he urged the\r\nDuke of Rutland to seek out the most practicable means of healing the\r\ndiscontent in that island. Above all he suggested an alleviation in the\r\nmatter of tithe (then the most flagrant of all material grievances), if\r\npossible, with the assent of the (Protestant) Established Church.[282]\r\nSimilarly in the cause of Free Trade, when foiled by Anglo-Irish\r\njealousies, he turned towards France; and, after discovering the\r\nimpossibility of carrying out his aim for the regeneration of\r\nParliament, he vindicated the claims of morality in the administration\r\nof India. Finally, it is a crowning proof of the many-sidedness and\r\npractical character of his efforts that, amidst all his strivings to\r\nreduce the National Debt, he sought to strengthen the nation’s defences.\r\n\r\nDespite the many distractions of the years 1785–1786, he devoted much\r\ncare and thought to the navy. Already, in 1784, he had instituted a\r\nParliamentary inquiry into the state of the fleet and the dockyards,\r\nwhich brought to light many defects and pointed the way to remedies.\r\nHis anxiety respecting the first line of defence also led him to keep\r\nthe number of seamen at 18,000, a higher total than ever was known\r\nin time of peace; and he allotted the large sum of £2,400,000 for\r\nthe building of warships by contract. Further, he sought to stop the\r\ncorruption which was rife in the dockyards and the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe letter which Sir Charles Middleton (afterwards Lord Barham) wrote\r\nto him on 24th August 1786 reveals an astounding state of affairs. From\r\nhis official knowledge he declared--\r\n\r\n    The principle of our dockyards at present is a total disregard to\r\n    public œconomy in all its branches; and it is so rooted in the\r\n    professional officers that they cannot divest themselves of it\r\n    when brought into higher stations. They have so many relatives\r\n    and dependants, too, in the dockyards, that can only be served by\r\n    countenancing and promoting improper expences, that they never lose\r\n    an opportunity of supporting them when in their power, and on this\r\n    account ought to have as small a voice as possible in creating\r\n    them.[283]\r\n\r\nIn this and other letters to Pitt, Middleton expressed his belief\r\nthat much might be done to check these evils by the help of a firm\r\nand upright Minister. Probably this appeal from a patriotic and\r\nhard-working official sharpened the attention which Pitt bestowed on\r\nnaval affairs. We know from the notes of Sir T. Byam Martin that Pitt\r\nfrequently visited the Navy Office in order to discuss business details\r\nwith the Comptroller, and by his commanding ability left the impression\r\nthat he might have been all his life engaged on naval affairs. In\r\nparticular he used to inspect the reports of the building and repairing\r\nof the ships-of-the-line.--“He also (wrote Martin) desired to have a\r\nperiodical statement from the Comptroller of the state of the fleet,\r\nwisely holding that officer responsible personally to him without any\r\nregard to the Board.” The results of this impulse given by one master\r\nmind were speedily seen. More work was got out of the dockyards, and\r\ntwenty-four new sail-of-the-line were forthcoming from private yards\r\nin the years 1783–1790. Thus, by the time of the Spanish war-scare in\r\n1790, ninety-three line-of-battle ships were ready for commission.[284]\r\nThe crises of the years 1786–1788 had also been so serious that they\r\nmight speedily have led to war had not Britain’s first line of defence\r\nbeen invincible.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the proposal to strengthen the defences of Portsmouth and\r\nPlymouth, Pitt was less fortunate. The proposal really came from the\r\nDuke of Richmond, Master of the Ordnance, who was far from popular--a\r\nfact which perhaps influenced the votes of members. Though Pitt and\r\nother Ministers adduced excellent reasons for not leaving those vital\r\npoints in their present weak state, he did not carry the House of\r\nCommons with him. After an exciting debate, which lasted till 7 a.m. of\r\n28th February 1786, the numbers on a division were found to be exactly\r\nequal. Then there arose a shout such as had not been heard since the\r\nmemorable vote which wrecked Lord North’s Ministry. At once all eyes\r\nturned to the Speaker, Cornwall. He declared that he was too exhausted\r\nto give his reasons for his vote, but he would merely declare that the\r\n“Noes” had it. Wraxall states that the sense of the House was against\r\nPitt, the country gentlemen especially disliking the addition of\r\n£700,000 to the next year’s expenses.[285] One of the arguments of the\r\nOpposition seems to us curious. It was urged that the fortification of\r\nthe two towns in question might be the beginning of a despotic system\r\nwhich would undermine the liberties of Englishmen. While treating\r\nthis argument with the contempt it deserved, Pitt declared that he\r\nbowed before the feeling of the House. The commencement of huge works\r\nat Cherbourg later in the year must have caused qualms even to the\r\nwatch-dogs of the constitution.\r\n\r\nSome of the more eager Whigs called out for him to resign, it being\r\nthe third time in twenty-two months that he had failed to carry an\r\nimportant measure. We may, however, point out that the proposal\r\nemanated from the Duke of Richmond; and there is the curious fact that\r\nCourtenay during the debate of 20th March 1789 asserted that the plan\r\nwas merely the Duke’s, and had not come from the Royal Engineers. He\r\nwas also not contradicted.[286] Further, it should be noticed that\r\nthough Pitt made the proposal his own, Dundas and others of his Cabinet\r\nwere known to dislike it. There is the final consideration already\r\ndwelt on, that the custom which requires a Ministry to resign on the\r\nrejection of any important measure, had not yet crystallized into a\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThis was the last severe check which Pitt sustained in Parliament for\r\nmany years. The fact that he suffered as many as three in twenty-two\r\nmonths with little or no diminution of prestige shows that his majority\r\nreally trusted him and had no desire to put Fox and North in power.\r\nThat alternative was out of the question, as Fox knew, even when he\r\ntwitted his rival with being kept in office solely by the royal favour.\r\n\r\nNevertheless in the years following 1785 we notice a distinct weakening\r\nin Pitt’s progressive tendencies. Whig though he was in his inmost\r\nconvictions, he drifted slowly but surely towards the Tory position.\r\nFortunately for him, the folly of his rivals in the year 1784, and\r\nagain in the Regency crisis of 1788–9, enabled him to link the cause of\r\nthe King with that of the nation. But these occasions were exceptional.\r\nIt is never safe to owe a triumph to the mistakes of opponents amidst\r\nunusual conditions. For mistakes will be made good; and in the whirl of\r\nlife circumstances will arise which range men and parties according to\r\nelemental principles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven before the French Revolution tested the strength of Pitt’s\r\nreforming convictions, there came a question which acted as a\r\ntouchstone. This was the proposal to repeal the Corporation and Test\r\nActs of the reign of Charles II. Those measures had excluded from\r\noffice in Corporations, or under Government, all who would not receive\r\nthe Sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England. By this\r\nban a large body of intelligent and loyal citizens were thrust out of\r\nthe pale of political and civic preferment; and though the Toleration\r\nAct and Annual Acts of Indemnity screened them from actual persecution,\r\ntheir position was yet one of hardship. Certain bodies had not\r\nscrupled to make money out of their conscientious objections. As is\r\nwell known, the Corporation of the City of London hit upon the plan of\r\naugmenting the building fund of their new Mansion House by passing a\r\nby-law in 1748 fining any Londoner who refused to serve when presented\r\nfor nomination as Sheriff, and then proposing rich Nonconformists\r\nfor that office. Not until 1767 did the able pronouncement of Lord\r\nMansfield in the Upper House secure the rejection of this odious\r\ndevice. Thenceforth Nonconformists secured immunity from fines for\r\nrefusing to serve in offices that were barred by the test of the\r\nSacrament.\r\n\r\nNevertheless their position was far from enviable. By the freaks\r\nof insular logic Protestant Dissenters were allowed to vote in\r\nparliamentary elections and even to sit in the House of Commons; but\r\nthough they had a share in the making and amending of laws, they could\r\nhold no office in a Corporation, or any of the great London Companies;\r\ncommissions in the army, navy, and offices in other public services\r\nwere also legally closed to them. Severe penalties hung over the head\r\nof any one who, in reliance on the annual Act of Indemnity, ventured\r\nto infringe any of these singular enactments. Public opinion approved\r\nthis exclusiveness; and an anecdote told of that humorous mass of\r\nintolerance, Dr. Johnson, shows that prejudice was still keen in the\r\ncircles which he frequented. He, Sir Robert Chambers, and John Scott\r\n(the future Lord Eldon), were walking in the gardens of New Inn Hall\r\nat Oxford, when Chambers began picking up snails and throwing them\r\ninto the next garden. Johnson sharply rebuked him for this boorish\r\nact, until there came the soothing explanation that the neighbour was\r\na Dissenter.--“Oh,” said the Doctor, “if so, Chambers, toss away, toss\r\naway as hard as you can.”[287]\r\n\r\nThe choice blend of Anglicanism and culture discernible in Chambers and\r\nJohnson, might be seen elsewhere than in the seat of learning on the\r\nIsis. It was the rule in the rural districts, except among the sturdy\r\nyeomen of the Eastern Counties, where the spirit that fought at Naseby\r\nhad so far survived as to render snail-throwing a pastime of doubtful\r\nexpediency. The same remark applies to London, where the tactics of\r\nthe city fathers had signally failed to suppress Dissent. Very many\r\nchurchmen were ashamed of these petty attempts at persecution, and the\r\nprogress of the Evangelical revival aroused a feeling of uneasiness at\r\nseeing the most sacred rite of the Church degraded into a political\r\nshibboleth. Comprehension within the bosom of Mother Church was highly\r\ndesirable; but clearly it might be too dearly purchased by Erastian\r\nlaws which enabled a lax Nonconformist to buy his way into the Customs\r\nor Excise by presenting himself at the altar of the nearest church\r\nalong with convinced communicants.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Nonconformists had a strong body of opinion on their\r\nside in the session of 1787, when they asked for the repeal of those\r\nexclusive statutes. A staunch churchman, Mr. Beaufoy, championed their\r\ncause in a very powerful and eloquent speech, which won the admiration\r\nof Wraxall.[288] Beaufoy dwelt on the anomaly of retaining this\r\nold-world exclusiveness, which would expose to the penalties of the\r\nlaw the illustrious John Howard, if ever he returned to this country.\r\nHe showed that no danger need be apprehended for the Established\r\nChurch, especially as the Act of Supremacy would continue to exclude\r\nfrom office all Roman Catholics, as well as Quakers. Further, the\r\nloyalty of the Protestant Dissenters had been sufficiently shown in\r\nthe election of 1784, when they voted with Pitt on behalf of the\r\nprerogatives of the Crown. He then inveighed against the continuance\r\nof enactments which “degraded the altar into a qualification-desk for\r\ntax-gatherers and public extortioners.” Fox followed with a strong plea\r\nfor religious toleration, quoting Locke and other writers who denounced\r\nthe imposition of religious tests in political matters. The Church of\r\nEngland, said the Whig leader, was disgraced by the present state of\r\nthings; and, seeing that it represented the majority of the English\r\npeople, it could not be endangered by the proposed change.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand North, now quite blind, came into the House leaning\r\non his son, Colonel North, in order to oppose the motion. Speaking with\r\nmuch earnestness, he declared that the Test and Corporation Acts were\r\nthe bulwarks of our Constitution. Pitt must have felt some surprise\r\nat speaking on the same side as North; but he now asserted that those\r\nActs did not impose any stigma or penalty on Nonconformists, for whom,\r\nindeed, he had a great respect. There must be a Church Establishment,\r\nand it of necessity implied some restrictions on those outside its\r\npale. The constitution of Society involved limitations of individual\r\nrights; and he averred that the laws in question were justified by that\r\nconsideration. Further, there were no means whereby moderate Dissenters\r\ncould be admitted to these privileges while the more violent were\r\nexcluded. If all were admitted, they might overthrow the outworks of\r\nthe Establishment. These arguments carried the day by one hundred and\r\nseventy-six votes to ninety-eight (28th March 1787).[289]\r\n\r\nBishop Watson, of Llandaff, in his “Reminiscences,” explains Pitt’s\r\nconduct on this occasion. He declares that the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer had no strong feelings of his own on the subject, and had\r\ntherefore referred the matter to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The\r\nPrimate had assembled his colleagues at Lambeth, and by ten votes to\r\ntwo they had decided to uphold the Caroline enactments. If this be\r\ncorrect, Pitt’s action was weak. Certainly his speech was half-hearted,\r\nand utterly different in tone from his orations on Reform, the\r\nRegency, Slavery, and other topics which moved him deeply. Moreover,\r\nthe referring a matter of this kind to the bench of bishops was about\r\nas reasonable as taking the opinion of country squires on a proposed\r\nmitigation of the Game Laws, or of college dons on a reform of their\r\nuniversity. A Prime Minister abdicates his functions when he defers to\r\nthe opinions of a class respecting a proposal which will trench on its\r\nprerogatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINDIA\r\n\r\n    “We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territory\r\n    by the same obligations of duty which bind us to all our other\r\n    subjects.”--(Proclamation of Queen Victoria, 1st November 1858.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMontaigne once uttered a protest against those historians who “chew\r\nthe mouthfuls for us,” and spoil all in the process. He coupled with\r\nit, however, another vice which is really far more serious, namely,\r\ntheir habit of laying down rules for judging, and “for bending history\r\nto their fancy.” As for the presenting history in mouthfuls, it is\r\nprobably the only way of making it digestible except for those mighty\r\nintellects which seize facts and figures with avidity, and assimilate\r\nthem as if by magic.\r\n\r\nFurther, the modern historian may urge in defence of the topical method\r\nthat it is the only practicable way of dealing with the infinity of\r\ntopics of the last two centuries, ranging over parliamentary debates\r\nand wars, finance and social gossip, mean intrigues and philanthropic\r\nmovements, industrial changes and empire-building, the efforts of\r\ngreat men and the impersonal forces that mould and move great nations,\r\ntogether with the denuding agencies that weather away the old surface\r\nand the resistless powers that thrust up a new world. How shall a\r\nfinite intellect grasp at once all the moving details of this varied\r\nlife? The mind craves to consider at any one time only one part of the\r\nmajestic procession, just as it demands that the facts of Nature shall\r\nbe grasped under different sciences. Human life is one as Nature is\r\none; but the division in each case is necessitated by the increasing\r\nwidth of man’s outlook. All that is essential in the sorting-out\r\nprocess is that it shall honestly set forth all the important facts,\r\nand here and there open out vistas revealing the connection with\r\nother fields of human activity. In short, history can no longer be\r\na detailed panorama of life, but it can and ought to be a series of\r\ncompanion pictures, informed by the personality of the artist and\r\ndevoid of conscious prejudice.\r\n\r\nAmong the diverse subjects which confront us in the many-sided\r\ncareer of Pitt, none stands more apart than that of his relations\r\nto India. Of his Herculean labours we may, perhaps, term this one\r\nthe cleansing of the Augean stables. The corruption that clung about\r\nthe Indian Government, the baffling remoteness of its duties, the\r\nsingular relations of the East India Company to the Crown, and of its\r\nown officials to it, above all, the storms of passion which had been\r\naroused by the masterful dealings of Warren Hastings and the furious\r\ninvectives of Burke, presented a problem which could not be solved\r\nsave by the exercise of insight, patience, and wise forcefulness. It\r\nwould greatly overburden this narrative to recount the signal services,\r\nalbeit marred by deeds of severity and injustice, whereby Hastings\r\ngrappled with the Mahratta War and the incursion of Hyder Ali into\r\nthe Carnatic. All that need be remembered here is that Parliament had\r\ncensured some of his actions and demanded his recall, that the Court of\r\nDirectors of the Company had endorsed that demand, but that the Court\r\nof Proprietors had annulled it. Hastings therefore remained at his\r\npost, mainly, it would appear, from a conviction that he alone could\r\nsafeguard British supremacy.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on this all-important question there was division in the\r\nexecutive powers at Calcutta, and in the East India Company itself;\r\nwhile the insubordination of very many of the Company’s servants in\r\nIndia further revealed the insufficiency of Lord North’s Regulating Act\r\nof 1773. Fortunately, however, the finances of the Company were in such\r\ndisorder as to make it amenable to pressure from Westminster. It owed\r\na very large sum to the Home Government for duties on its imports into\r\nGreat Britain; and Parliament was thus the better able to assert the\r\nsupremacy of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt was high time to make good this claim. The India Bills of Fox and\r\nof Pitt had been thrown out; and thus, despite an infinity of talk,\r\nthe whole situation remained unchanged, except that nearly every one\r\nnow agreed that it must be changed. On questions of detail opinions\r\ndiffered widely. Some of the proprietors and Directors of the Company\r\nprotested against any interference whatsoever with chartered rights\r\nwhich they were perfectly able to uphold and vindicate. The opposite\r\nextreme was touched by Fox during a preliminary debate on the affairs\r\nof the Company, when he declared that body to be a sink of corruption\r\nand iniquity, a mere conduit for bringing home the wealth acquired by\r\nits servants in India. If, said he, the patronage of the India service\r\nmust be vested either in the Directors or in the Crown, let the Crown\r\ntake that influence from hands which had so shamefully abused it.\r\n\r\nPitt’s position, it soon appeared, was intermediate between these\r\nextremes. Four days later, on 6th July 1784, he introduced his second\r\nIndia Bill in a speech marked by great circumspection. He started from\r\nthe same principles which had fashioned the outlines of his former\r\nmeasure (see chapter vii), that, though a charter ought not to override\r\nthe needs of the State, yet nothing but absolute necessity could\r\njustify its abrogation. The affairs of the Company, he claimed, did\r\nnot warrant so extreme a measure. His aim would be, not to abolish,\r\nbut improve on, the existing plan of government for India. There were\r\ntwo essentials to be aimed at, namely, a due share of activity and\r\nresourcefulness in the Indian Government and obedience to the measures\r\ndictated by Parliament. The former of these requisites could be\r\nattained only by according to the Indian Government a certain degree of\r\npower, and from the latter it resulted that that power must be subject\r\nto the control of a regulating Board at home.\r\n\r\nPitt therefore recurred to his former plan. He left to the Governments\r\nof the Presidencies, above all, to the Governor-General, enough\r\nauthority to enable them to cope with emergencies; but he also\r\nproposed to subject them to a Board consisting of members chosen by\r\nthe Crown from the Privy Council. To this special committee of the\r\nPrivy Council would be entrusted the power of devising legislation\r\nfor India, of controlling Indian policy, and of recalling any of the\r\nCompany’s officials. It was not, however, to have a voice in those\r\nquestions of patronage which might deflect it from the path of duty and\r\nimpartiality. The proceedings of the Board might be open to perusal by\r\nthe Directors of the Company; but its behests would be final. In case\r\nof flagrant disobedience, or of other grave offences, the officials and\r\nservants of the Company were to be tried by a Commission consisting of\r\nmembers of the two Houses of Parliament chosen by ballot shortly before\r\nthe trial.\r\n\r\nSuch were the chief proposals. As for the spirit which informed the\r\nmeasures, it may be divined from that part of the speech in which\r\nthe Prime Minister set forth the fundamental principles of our\r\nIndian policy. They were in brief these, the avoidance of war and of\r\nalliances that might lead to war, and the use of such conciliatory\r\nmethods as would further the aim which we had chiefly in view--pacific\r\ncommerce.[290]\r\n\r\nNeither the spirit of enlightened patriotism, which pervaded the\r\nspeech, nor the practical nature of the proposals screened the measure\r\nfrom fierce opposition. That acrid opponent of Warren Hastings, Mr.\r\nFrancis, taunted Pitt with leaving to the Directors of the Company\r\nthe mere shadow of authority, but he prophesied that the large\r\npowers vested in the Governor-General and in the Governments of the\r\nPresidencies would be abused as flagrantly as ever they had been in the\r\npast. Fox expanded these objections with his usual force, asserting\r\nthat far too large powers were given to the Crown, and that the\r\nproposed Board would be quite as partisan a body as the Commissioners\r\nto whom he in his India Bill had entrusted the regulating power. He\r\nfurther insisted that to leave appointments to the Company, while\r\ndepriving it of authority, was a miserably weak expedient which must\r\nsap the base of government. On their side, the Directors of the Company\r\ncomplained that the present Bill at several points trenched on their\r\ntrading rights, which they had always expressly reserved to themselves;\r\nand they urged that they must retain in their own hands the right of\r\nrecalling their own servants. As for the proposed tribunal for the\r\ntrial of disobedient officials, it seemed to them an unsatisfactory\r\nexperiment, seeing that both trial by jury and impeachment were ill\r\nadapted to the complex questions of Indian administration.[291]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Company had to give way at nearly all points.\r\nThe powers of the Court of Proprietors almost entirely lapsed (to\r\nthe satisfaction of all but themselves); and a clause was passed,\r\ncompelling the Company’s officials to state on oath the amount of\r\ntheir fortunes at the end of their service, Pitt himself suggesting\r\nthat private gains up to £2,000 a year after the first five years of\r\nservice should not be deemed culpable. Though the Bill prohibited the\r\nreceiving of “presents” from natives, it was clear that officials\r\nwould use other equally objectionable means in order to arrive at that\r\nunobjectionable sum.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, the principle of controlling Indian affairs from\r\nWestminster, which Lord North had rather haltingly asserted eleven\r\nyears earlier, now became the dominant fact of the situation. This will\r\nbe clear if we review the constitution and powers of the new Board of\r\nControl. It was to consist of six members of the Privy Council chosen\r\nby the King; the Chancellor of the Exchequer and one of the Secretaries\r\nof State being always included. In the absence of these two, the senior\r\nmember of the remaining four was to preside; and finally the conduct\r\nof the Board’s affairs came to rest virtually with him, so that he\r\nbecame, in all but name, Secretary of State for India. For the present,\r\nhowever, as appears from a letter of Dundas to Cornwallis of 29th July\r\n1787, Pitt attended the Board regularly and thoroughly mastered its\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nTo this Board were submitted all letters and despatches between the\r\nCompany and its officials in India, except those which referred solely\r\nto trade. Every proceeding and resolution of the Court of Directors\r\nmust come to it; and from it there issued orders which the Directors\r\nwere bound to enforce. Further, at the second reading Pitt amended his\r\nBill so as to allow the Board in urgent cases to frame and transmit\r\ntheir commands to India without communicating them to the Directors.\r\nFinally, if the Company appealed against the Board’s decisions, the\r\nultimate judgement lay with the King in Council, that is, with a body\r\nlargely the same as that from which it appealed.[292] While, therefore,\r\nPitt instituted what was called a system of dual control, that control,\r\nsave in the lower sphere of commerce, was really exercised by the Home\r\nGovernment. In the long series of changes which transformed the venture\r\nof a company of London merchants into an Empire administered by the\r\nBritish people, no step is more important than that taken by him in\r\nthis, his first great constructive effort.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Various circumstances in the next eighteen months\r\nshowed the need of still further strengthening the Indian executive.\r\nCertain ominous moves of the French caused anxiety. In the spring of\r\n1785 their East India Company was revived on an imposing scale; and\r\nthe close relations subsisting between France and the Dutch Republic\r\naugured ill for the British dominions in the Orient. Everything,\r\ntherefore, tended to emphasize the need of strong Government at\r\nCalcutta; and the attention directed to Indian affairs, consequent on\r\nthe charges brought against Warren Hastings early in the year 1786,\r\nfurther convinced many competent judges of the need of strengthening\r\nthe Indian executive. These considerations furnish the reasons which\r\nled Pitt to bring in an Amending Act.\r\n\r\nIf we may judge from Pitt’s speeches of 17th and 22nd March of\r\nthat year, he had been much impressed by the sagacity of the\r\nGovernor-General in seeking to frame an alliance with the Great Mogul\r\nfor the purpose of counterbalancing the offensive league of Tippoo\r\nSahib with the French. The action of Hastings’ Council in frustrating\r\nthis statesmanlike plan, because it contravened the instructions of the\r\nCompany, showed the unwisdom of doubly tying the hands of a competent\r\ngovernor, first by instructions drawn up in Leadenhall Street, and\r\nsecondly by a Council in which pedantry or personal spite could\r\nparalyze great enterprises. Obviously what was required was to choose\r\nthe right man as Governor-General, then to grant him powers large\r\nenough to meet serious crises, and to place him in such a relation to\r\nthe Home Government that those powers would not be abused. None of\r\nthese conditions could be satisfied so long as the Company appointed\r\nthe supreme officials and prescribed their functions.\r\n\r\nBut Pitt’s Bill of 1784 had changed all this. As we have seen, the\r\nBritish Government was now the driving force of the Indian machinery,\r\nthe Company acting merely as an intermediate wheel. The responsibility\r\nof the Governor-General to the new India Board and to Parliament having\r\nbeen decisively asserted, his powers could now safely be increased.\r\n\r\nThis formed the _raison d’être_ of Pitt’s Amending Act of March 1786.\r\nThough introduced by Dundas--a graceful compliment to his exertions\r\nin Indian matters in time past--it emanated from the Prime Minister.\r\nIt applied the principles of the India Bill of 1784 to the servants\r\nof the Company in Great Britain. But, what was far more important, it\r\nenabled the Governor-General to override the opinions of his Council\r\nat Calcutta, the members thenceforth merely recording in writing their\r\nprotests or the grounds of their opposition. The like powers were\r\nalso conferred on the Governors of Madras and Bombay. Finally, the\r\nGovernor-General was empowered to fill up any vacancy in the Council\r\noccasioned by death, and was also to act as Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThese far-reaching proposals caused Burke’s spleen to overflow. He\r\nburst forth into a violent diatribe against this “raw-head and bloody\r\nbones Bill.” Pitt’s first India Bill, he declared, was an abortion of\r\ntyranny, an imperfect foetus in a bottle, to be handed about as a show,\r\nbut hypocrisy had nursed it till now the full-grown monster was before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n                     And at his heels,\r\n  Leash’d in like hounds, shall famine, sword, and fire\r\n  Crouch for employment.\r\n\r\nIt was absurd, he said, to expect energy and despatch from a despotism\r\nlike that about to be set up in India. Democracy owed most of its\r\ntriumphs to the openness and strength of its operations. The joint\r\nexperience of many must prevail over the fallible judgements even\r\nof the best mind on earth. After this outburst, which Burke must\r\nhave regretfully recalled when he undertook his crusade against\r\nFrench democracy, Fox emptied the vials of his wrath on the measure,\r\nespecially taunting Pitt with robbing the Council at Calcutta of all\r\nadministrative functions. This was not surprising, he said, as the\r\nMinister so obviously preferred speech to action. His speeches were\r\nsplendid, his actions presented a long record of failure. “Let others\r\nact, the honourable gentleman desired only to argue.” Pitt wisely\r\ndeclined to notice heated personalities, and limited his speech to\r\nthe task of proving that the Bill cured several of the weaknesses\r\nof the Indian Government, and met the needs of the situation. This\r\nreply, quiet, dignified, and practical, carried the House with him by\r\na majority of eighty-nine. The Bill passed the third reading without a\r\ndivision on 27th March. Such was Pitt’s retort to the windy declamation\r\nof his opponents.\r\n\r\nThus was completed the fabric begun two years before. Thenceforth the\r\nGovernor-General wielded a concentrated power such as India had not\r\nknown since the decline of the Moguls. No longer could he be thwarted\r\nby the members of his own Council as Warren Hastings had often been by\r\nthe intrigues of Monson and Francis. In truth the Viceroyalty was now\r\nan autocracy such as orientals could understand and respect. But this\r\nautocracy was, after all, local and conditional--a fact which Burke\r\noverlooked or ignored. While wielding despotic authority in India, the\r\nnew Viceroy was but an adjunct of the British constitutional machine.\r\nIt is perhaps the highest of Pitt’s achievements that he saw how to\r\ncombine two ideals of Government, the oriental and the occidental, in\r\na way that conduced to vigour of action in Bengal, and did not impair\r\npopular progress at home. While investing the real ruler of India\r\nwith powers far greater than those wielded by Warren Hastings, he\r\nsubordinated them to the will of King and Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that Pitt was weak as a legislator.[293] It will\r\nbe well to notice this charge at the close of these volumes. But\r\nsurely, when judged by all conceivable standards, his India Bills must\r\ntake rank amongst the greatest of legislative achievements. For by\r\nthose measures, Pitt subordinated the most powerful of all Companies\r\nto the British Parliament. By it, as we have seen, he harmonized the\r\nclaims of a viceregal autocracy in the Orient with those of popular\r\ngovernment at home; and he thereby saved the British Empire from the\r\nfate which befell that of Rome. Historians of the Roman Republic agree\r\nthat the favourites of the Senate of the type of Verres who were\r\nlet loose on the provinces beyond the sea, not only proved the most\r\nfrightful scourge to the subject peoples, but also undermined popular\r\nliberty at home by the unscrupulous use of their plundered hoards. The\r\nsame system palsied the limbs of that Empire and drugged its brain.\r\nWhether the “nabobs” who rolled off from India and settled down in\r\nEngland would finally have exerted this doubly baleful influence, it\r\nis futile to inquire; but, had they gorged and bribed for several\r\ngenerations, the results must have been serious among a people that\r\nlook on politics from a very practical standpoint.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to have run amok at that class, like Burke, might\r\nhave yielded them the ultimate victory. Pitt observed the golden mean.\r\nFor the present, the Company hailed him as its champion. But, while\r\nsaving it from the Quixotic crusader, he bound it and its servants by\r\nstrong ties, which it was found easy to tighten at every renewal of\r\nthe Charter. Above all he strengthened the hands of the Viceroy even\r\nwhile binding him more closely to the Home Government. Has any other\r\nstatesman succeeded in the task of linking an oriental autocracy with\r\nthe ancient parliamentary system of a Teutonic race?\r\n\r\nThe first of the parliamentary Governors-General was the man whom\r\nPitt early in 1784 designed for the equally difficult post of Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland. In the summer of that year, as also early\r\nin 1785, he urged Earl Cornwallis to combine the functions of\r\nGovernor-General and Commander-in-Chief of India; but the earl at that\r\ntime declined, partly because the powers of the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwere unduly restricted.[294] The high hopes which Dundas had long\r\nentertained of the abilities of Cornwallis, shown by his desire to\r\noffer to him the Viceroyalty in 1782, now led the Ministry to meet his\r\nobjections by introducing the Amending Act for extending the powers of\r\nthe Governor-General in cases of emergency.[295] Cornwallis accordingly\r\naccepted office; and in the seven years of his Viceroyalty (1786–1793)\r\nBritish rule was so far strengthened as to withstand the attacks of the\r\nMahrattas and the far-reaching combinations of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same year which saw the dawn of a new era for India, witnessed also\r\nthe impeachment of Warren Hastings. We are not concerned here with the\r\nseries of events which provided material for that longest and most\r\nfamous of our State trials. What does concern us is the behaviour of\r\nPitt in what was perhaps the most complex problem confronted in his\r\nearly manhood. Seeing that he was chiefly responsible for the vote in\r\nthe House of Commons which made impeachment inevitable, this part of\r\nthe question cannot be passed by. Difficult though it is to separate\r\none of the charges brought by Burke and Fox against Hastings from the\r\nothers, yet limits of space compel us to restrict our survey to that\r\none which induced Pitt to vote for the impeachment. It related to\r\nHastings’ treatment of Cheyt Singh, the Zamindar (not quite correctly\r\ntermed the Rajah) of Benares.\r\n\r\nThe reader is doubtless aware that Hastings’ tenure of the Governorship\r\nof Bengal in and after the year 1772 coincided with a period of\r\nexceptional difficulty, which was enhanced by the acrid and often\r\nunderhand opposition of Francis, Clavering, and Monson in the Governing\r\nCouncil at Calcutta. Further, the East India Company was often on\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy. Undoubtedly the perpetual want of money led\r\nHastings to the most questionable of his enterprises, the letting\r\nout of the Company’s troops to the Rajah of Oude for the purpose of\r\ndriving out or subjecting the Rohillas, a race of freebooters on his\r\nnorth-western borders. But difficulties thickened with the outbreak\r\nof the war with the Mahrattas and the French. The climax came in 1780\r\nwhen Hyder Ali, the usurper of Mysore, let loose his hordes upon the\r\nCarnatic, and threatened to sweep the British into the sea. Then it was\r\nthat the genius of Hastings awoke to full strength. He strained every\r\nnerve to send from the Hooghly a large force of troops to the relief\r\nof the despairing settlement at Madras; and, money being an essential,\r\nhe cast about for all means of finding it without wholly depleting the\r\nexchequer of the embarrassed Company. Among other devices he pressed\r\none of his feudatories, Cheyt Singh, Zamindar of Benares, for a sum of\r\n£50,000 in addition to the annual tribute. Seeing that the British held\r\nthe paramountcy in India, and therefore enjoyed the right of calling\r\non the vassal princes for help in time of emergency, the claim was\r\nreasonable, especially as Cheyt Singh’s father owed his position to the\r\nEast India Company. After giving extra assistance in each of the years\r\n1778–80, Cheyt Singh began to grow restive in 1780 when the demand was\r\nrenewed, and showed signs of disloyalty. Hastings thereupon imposed a\r\nfine of £500,000. More than this, he went to Benares in person, hoping\r\nto browbeat the Zamindar; but, his following being scanty, the troops\r\nof the latter rose against him, and cooped him up in his residence.\r\nWith the splendid coolness which never deserted him, he manfully faced\r\nthe danger. Secretly he sent warning to some of the Company’s forces\r\nnot far distant, and British valour rescued him from his desperate\r\nplight. An Englishman in resolution, Hastings was an oriental in his\r\nmethods of punishment and revenge. Forthwith he deposed Cheyt Singh,\r\nand set in his place another Zamindar with a much enhanced tribute\r\n(September 1781).\r\n\r\nThe same plea of overmastering necessity impelled him to interfere in\r\nthe affairs of Oude, an episode which, when tricked out in the gorgeous\r\nrhetoric of Burke and Sheridan, shocked the conscience of the British\r\npeople. Sheridan’s oration on “The Spoliation of the Begums of Oude”\r\nis perhaps the most thrilling Philippic of the modern world; but its\r\nforce is sensibly lessened when we know that Burke derived his version\r\nof facts from a poisoned source. Francis, the bitter enemy of Warren\r\nHastings, had been worsted by that master-mind in the Council-chamber\r\nat Calcutta; and, on challenging him to a duel, had been wounded in\r\nfair fight. It was this man, beaten twice over, who in 1781 returned\r\nto England to brood over means of revenge, and found them incarnate in\r\nBurke.\r\n\r\nThe genius which enabled that great Irishman to pour out serene and\r\nsoul-satisfying judgements on the affairs of nations was allied with\r\na more than feminine sensitiveness that often left him at the mercy\r\nof first impressions and Quixotic impulses. On all points of honour,\r\nwhether personal or national, his chivalrous nature carried him to\r\nextremes bordering on the fantastic. The two incidents recounted above\r\nkindled in him a passion of indignation, which cooled but slowly, even\r\nwhen hatred of the French Revolution obsessed him. All attempts to\r\nascribe Burke’s crusade against Hastings to partisanship or personal\r\nspite have egregiously failed. As Macaulay has shown in his brilliant\r\nbut untrustworthy essay on Warren Hastings, Burke’s opposition to\r\nHastings began in 1781, survived the kaleidoscopic changes of the\r\nnext decade, and lived on into the new world of the Revolutionary\r\nEra. Clearly it resulted from a profound difference of view on Indian\r\naffairs. Even to-day, when the justificatory facts of Hastings’ career\r\nare well known, his actions are wholly condemned by men of a similar\r\nbent of mind. On the other hand his policy appears statesmanlike to\r\nthose who look first at the wealth of benefits conferred on India by\r\nthe British Raj and pay little heed to miscarriages of justice which\r\nthey regard as incidental to an alien administration. The Hastings\r\nepisode will ever range in hostile groups men of strongly marked\r\ndispositions; while the judicial minority will feel themselves drawn\r\nperplexingly first to the sentimental side and then to the practical\r\nside as new facts and considerations emerge from the welter of evidence.\r\n\r\nFrom midsummer 1785, when Hastings landed at Plymouth and repaired to\r\nthe Court at Windsor, England was rent asunder by these prepossessions.\r\nThe King, as might be expected, received him with marked favour;\r\nbut it caused some surprise that Queen Charlotte, who was propriety\r\npersonified, should affably receive his wife, the _divorcée_ of a\r\ncomplaisant Baron Imhoff. For a time it seemed that Hastings could\r\nafford to scorn the efforts of his opponents. Burke had given\r\nnotice of a hostile motion in the House of Commons; but, in the then\r\ndiscredited state of the Opposition, it was unlikely to pass. Ministers\r\nfor the most part approved the conduct of Hastings. Pitt also is said\r\nto have been favourably impressed by an interview which they had\r\ntowards the end of June. Unfortunately no account survives of what must\r\nhave been a memorable meeting. Hastings was then fifty-two years of\r\nage, exactly double the span of life passed by the Prime Minister. But\r\nthe young statesman had by instinct the same faculty of controlling his\r\nfeelings under a calm exterior which the Governor-General had perfected\r\nduring years of vindictive opposition at Calcutta. The countenance of\r\neach was thin and worn by the workings of a too active brain, reminding\r\nthe beholder of the noble lines of Milton:\r\n\r\n               Deep on his front engraven\r\n  Deliberation sat and public care;\r\n  And princely counsel in his face yet shone\r\n  Majestic.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly they were then the ablest men of action of our race; and,\r\ndespite envious surmises to the contrary, we may be sure that Pitt\r\nlooked with admiration on the placid intellectual features of the man\r\nwhose gigantic toil had saved British India. Both of them had the\r\npower of throwing off the cares of state and of indulging in playful\r\nintercourse with friends;[296] and charm of manner and conversation\r\nmust have enlivened the interview.\r\n\r\nYet each was closely on his guard. The opposition of Dundas to Hastings\r\n(for he it was who moved the vote of censure on him in May 1782) must\r\nhave coloured Pitt’s feelings; and Hastings, as we know, believed that\r\nthe India Bill of 1784 was a veiled attack upon himself. The interview\r\ncertainly did not reassure him; for he thenceforth informed his friends\r\nthat he could not depend on the support of Pitt.[297] The doubts were\r\nstrengthened by the omission of the honours that so distinguished a man\r\nmight have expected; but this fact was attributable to the motion of\r\ncensure of which Burke had given notice in the House.\r\n\r\nThus Pitt maintained a cautious reserve. To say that he was waiting\r\nto see which way the wind would blow is manifestly unjust. He was\r\nawaiting further information in what was a most complicated case. We\r\nknow that he sent to Hastings for an explanation of the terms of a\r\nzamindar’s tenure of office, evidently in order to clear up some of\r\nthe questions respecting the Zamindar of Benares.[298] Thus, while\r\nLansdowne, Mansfield, and Thurlow loudly proclaimed their confidence in\r\nHastings; while the King continued to converse with him most affably at\r\nthe _levées_, and Queen Charlotte accepted a splendid ivory bedstead\r\npresented by his wife, Pitt remained guardedly neutral.\r\n\r\nMany members of the Opposition wished to let the motion of censure\r\ndrop, and urged this at a private meeting held at the Duke of\r\nPortland’s residence shortly before the meeting of Parliament in\r\nJanuary 1786. But the zeal of Burke and Fox had not cooled with time.\r\nFurther, on the first day of the session they were pointedly challenged\r\nby Major Scott, the accredited agent of Hastings in the House. At best\r\nScott was a poor champion. Verbose, tedious, and ever harping on the\r\nsame theme, he wearied the House with the wrongs of Hastings before\r\nthey came officially before it; and on the first day of the great trial\r\nFanny Burney remarked: “What a pity that Mr. Hastings should have\r\ntrusted his cause to so frivolous an agent! I believe--and indeed it is\r\nthe general belief, both of friends and foes--that to his officious and\r\ninjudicious zeal the present prosecution is wholly owing.”[299]\r\n\r\nYet Scott would scarcely have flung down the gauntlet without the\r\nknowledge and consent of his patron. Indeed on all grounds it is\r\nprobable that Hastings, with his customary daring, preferred that the\r\nquestion should come to the clear light of a trial rather than swell\r\nwith the accretions of gossip and dark innuendoes.[300] We must also\r\nremember that until the vote of censure of 28th May 1782 was removed\r\nfrom the journals of the House his name was under a cloud; and now that\r\nthe accusations of Burke and Francis hurtled more thickly through the\r\nair, the whole matter was bound to come to the arbitrament of the law\r\nor of pistols.\r\n\r\nOn Hastings and Scott, then, rests the responsibility for renewing\r\nthe strife. While they thus rashly opened the game, Burke replied on\r\n17th February 1786 by a move of unusual skill. He requested that the\r\nClerk of the House should read Dundas’s resolutions of censure of May\r\n1782, and then ironically suggested that that gentleman, formerly\r\nthe president of the special committee of the House, was the man who\r\nnow ought to take action against the ex-Viceroy. He himself was but\r\na humble member of that committee, and he now looked, but in vain,\r\nto those in power to give effect to the earlier resolutions. “But I\r\nperceive,” he said, with his eyes on Pitt, “that any operations by\r\nwhich the three per cents may be raised in value affect Ministers more\r\ndeeply than the violated rights of millions of the human race.”[301]\r\nDundas, never an effective speaker, failed to wriggle away from the\r\ncharge of inconsistency thus pointedly driven home. The attitude of\r\nPitt was calm and dignified. In the course of the adjourned debate\r\nhe professed his neutrality on the question. While commending Burke\r\nfor the moderation with which he then urged his demands, he admitted\r\nthat the charges brought against Hastings ought to be investigated\r\nand his guilt or innocence proved by incontestable evidence. “I am,”\r\nhe said, “neither a determined friend nor foe of Mr. Hastings, but I\r\nwill support the principles of justice and equity. I recommend a calm\r\ndispassionate investigation, leaving every man to follow the impulse of\r\nhis own mind.”[302]\r\n\r\nThis declaration of neutrality, the import of which will appear in\r\nthe sequel, did not imply that there was to be no investigation.\r\nThe challenge having been thrown down, the tournament was bound to\r\nproceed. Thenceforth Pitt confined himself to the functions of arbiter.\r\nBurke now enlarged his motion so as to include all the official\r\ncorrespondence respecting Oude, whereupon the Minister urged him always\r\nto state his reasons for the production of documents, and not to expect\r\nthose which revealed any secret policy. Burke said he was ready to\r\nspecify his charges, and he did so. He further said that he was in\r\npossession of abundant evidence to make good those charges. On his\r\napplying for certain confidential papers, Pitt opposed the motion; but\r\nhe agreed to sixteen other motions for papers. In face of these facts,\r\nhow can the panegyrists of Warren Hastings claim that Pitt objected\r\nto Burke’s procedure and carried a motion against it?[303] Burke’s\r\nmotions were agreed to without a division, the Prime Minister having\r\nmerely given an obviously necessary veto in the case of confidential\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nIn view of the charges of gross inconsistency that have been brought\r\nagainst Pitt on the Hastings trial, it will be well to look into\r\ndetails somewhat closely. On 3rd March 1786 Burke returned to the\r\ncharge by pressing for the communication of papers respecting the\r\nrecent peace with the Mahrattas and cognate subjects. At once Dundas\r\nand Pitt objected, on the ground that very many of those documents were\r\nof the most confidential character, revealing, as they did, the secret\r\nmeans whereby the Mahratta confederacy was dissolved. In the course\r\nof his speech Pitt declared that Hastings had made that peace “with\r\nan address and ingenuity that did him immortal honour.” But he added\r\nthat other charges against him might be substantiated. In vain did Fox\r\nand Burke protest against the withholding of documents bearing on the\r\npresent topic. The sense of the House was against them. Wilberforce\r\napplauded the caution of Ministers, as did eighty-seven members against\r\nforty-four on a division. A similar motion by the accusers for the\r\nproduction of papers relative to Delhi met with the same fate three\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nOn Fox renewing his demand for the Delhi papers (17th March), Pitt took\r\noccasion to state his views clearly. If State papers were called for in\r\norder to set on foot a criminal prosecution, he required the mover to\r\n“show a probable ground of guilt,” and secondly, that the papers were\r\nnecessary to substantiate that guilt; the third condition was that the\r\npublic service would not suffer by publication.[304] He then proceeded\r\nto prove that the action of Hastings in seeking to form an alliance\r\nwith the Great Mogul (despite the orders of the Company) was timely and\r\nstatesmanlike, as it promised to thwart the alluring offers of Tippoo\r\nSahib and the French to that potentate. Finally he asserted that, if he\r\ncould reveal the Delhi correspondence to the House, all members would\r\nsee how improper its publication would be. For his own ease and for\r\nthe reputation of Hastings, which would be enhanced by such a step, he\r\ncould wish to give it to the world, especially as all the documents\r\nhitherto granted were hostile to the ex-Viceroy; but in the interests\r\nof the country he must oppose the demand of the prosecutors for the\r\nDelhi papers. In spite of the slap-dash assertions of Sheridan that the\r\ncontents of those papers were perfectly well known, the House upheld\r\nPitt’s decision by 140 votes to 73.[305]\r\n\r\nThe next move of the prosecutors was to demand the presence of certain\r\nwitnesses at the bar of the House. The Master of the Rolls objected\r\non points of form, and also protested against the appearance of\r\npamphlets hostile to Hastings which had been industriously circulated\r\namong the members of both Houses. Burke then admitted that most of\r\nthe State Papers asked for had been granted, though some had been\r\ndenied, but acridly complained that Ministers were now trying to\r\nquash the prosecution. Pitt did not speak.[306] On 26th April Burke\r\nbrought forward two more charges, whereupon Pitt remarked that they\r\ncontained much criminal matter, but he had formed no opinion as to\r\ntheir correctness; he hoped that it would appear otherwise, but the\r\nHouse must examine them with the utmost impartiality. Fox having\r\ntaunted him with pretending to see no guilt where he saw too much,\r\nPitt deprecated such outbursts. Later in the debate he demurred to the\r\nexamination of witnesses called by the prosecutors before Hastings\r\nhimself had been heard at the bar. Justice, he said, demanded that the\r\naccused should have a hearing before the accusers substantiated their\r\ncase. He also declared that he would not consent to the examination of\r\nwitnesses, still less to vote the impeachment of Hastings, on the vague\r\nand indefinite charges as yet before the House. Wilberforce expressed\r\nthe hope that the Minister would persevere in the steady path he had\r\npursued and would not be driven from it by the intemperate attacks of\r\nopponents. Burke inveighed against Pitt’s decision; but the latter\r\ncarried the day by 139 votes to 80.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore by Pitt’s action that Hastings procured a hearing\r\nin the House--an opportunity which, if tactfully used, might have\r\ndisconcerted his accusers. But the opportunity was lost. Instead of\r\nmaking a telling speech, Hastings proceeded to read a long and laboured\r\nreply, which occupied all the sittings of 1st and 2nd May, and emptied\r\nthe House. Members accustomed to the faultless oratory of Pitt and\r\nthe debating vigour of Fox, yawned at the dreary recital of remote\r\nevents of which they knew little and cared less. Accordingly, it was\r\nwith enhanced hope of success that Burke, after a month of careful\r\npreparation, brought forward his charges respecting the Rohilla War.\r\nOn 13th June he introduced them. On the former of them Grenville\r\ndefended the conduct of Hastings on the ground that the Rohillas\r\nhad by their raids provoked the war, and that it was well to remove\r\nthem. Dundas censured the Rohilla War, but maintained that, while the\r\nGovernor-General should have been recalled for it twelve years ago,\r\nthere was no ground for impeaching him for it now, especially as in\r\nthe interval Parliament had three times named him Governor-General.\r\nWilberforce, whose opinion weighed much with Pitt, took the same view.\r\nThe most significant speech of the defence was that of Wilbraham\r\nwho, on behalf of Hastings’ honour, urged the House to refer the\r\ncharges to the House of Lords, where alone a full acquittal could be\r\npronounced.[307] Pitt spoke only on a small technical point, but voted\r\nwith Grenville and Dundas. Despite a long and powerful speech by Fox,\r\nthe House sided with what seemed to be the ministerial view, and at\r\nhalf-past seven in the morning of 3rd June rejected Burke’s motion by\r\n119 votes to 67.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by this further rebuff, Fox, on 13th June, very ably brought\r\nup the charge relating to the treatment of Cheyt Singh, Zamindar of\r\nBenares.[308] He allowed that the continuance of Hastings in power\r\ntwelve years after the Rohilla War seemed to imply that Parliament had\r\ncondoned that offence; but this plea could not be urged respecting\r\nthe Benares affair of 1781. He showed that the Company had agreed to\r\nrespect the independence of the Zamindar of Benares, and that Hastings\r\nhad pressed on him remorselessly for aids in money and cavalry, and\r\nhad finally mulcted the exhausted prince of half a million sterling.\r\nThe fate of Bengal, he claimed, depended on their condemnation of so\r\ntyrannical a proceeding.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned on Pitt as he rose to state his views on this\r\nquestion; and Wraxall avers that never did the range of his faculties\r\nappear greater, his marshalling of facts more lucid, or his elocution\r\nmore easy and graceful. This is the more remarkable as the young\r\nMinister avowed his desire on personal grounds to absent himself from\r\nthe discussion of so complex and remote a problem. We also know from\r\nhis letter of 10th June to Eden, that he had “hardly hours enough\r\nto read all the papers on that voluminous article” (the Benares\r\ncharge).[309] It is therefore clear that he formed his judgement within\r\na very short time of his speech. In this, however, he soon showed\r\nthat he had probed the intricacies of the question. Setting forth in\r\ndetail the terms of a zamindar’s tenure, he disproved Fox’s contention\r\nthat the Company had no right to exact an “aid” from an “independent\r\nrajah.” He demurred to the epithet “independent,” at least as regarded\r\nthe supreme power in India. The suzerain power has as good a right in\r\ntime of crisis to exact “aids” from its feudatories as any Suzerain in\r\nEurope from his feudal dependents. Next he crushed Francis by citing\r\nhis own written opinion that extraordinary demands might be exacted\r\nfrom such feudatories. Having set forth the question in its true light,\r\nand exposed the inconsistency and malice of Francis, he approached\r\nthe crux of the whole problem, whether the fine ultimately exacted\r\nfrom Cheyt Singh was not excessive. Here he objected to the drawing\r\nof precedents solely from the days of the Indian Emperors. It was the\r\nduty of every British administrator to behave according to the rules of\r\njustice and liberty; and, said he, “On this ground I feel it impossible\r\nto acquit Mr. Hastings of the whole of the charge brought against him;\r\nfor I feel in my conscience that he has pushed the exercise of that\r\narbitrary discretion which, from the nature of the Eastern Government,\r\nwas intrusted to him to a greater length than he was warranted to do by\r\nthe necessity of the service.” While justified in imposing a penalty,\r\nhe continued, Hastings had not proportioned the punishment to the\r\nguilt. In fining Cheyt Singh £500,000 for a mere delay to pay £50,000\r\n(which £50,000 in the last instance was actually paid) Hastings had\r\n“proceeded in an arbitrary tyrannical manner.” As to the restoration of\r\nCheyt Singh to his possessions, it was beset by certain difficulties,\r\nand he preferred for the present to withhold his opinion.\r\n\r\nThat speech led to the impeachment of Warren Hastings; for though\r\nGrenville, Lord Mulgrave, and the Attorney-General (Pepper Arden) spoke\r\nagainst the Prime Minister, the judgement of the last named prevailed;\r\nthe House endorsed it by 119 votes to 79, or about the same numbers as\r\nhad rejected the previous charge. The conduct of Pitt on this occasion\r\nhas been vehemently assailed. Wraxall, writing many years later,\r\nmaintained that it was a sudden and unaccountable change of front; and\r\nhe further suggested that the jealousy which was said to be felt by\r\nDundas for the superior abilities of Hastings might have influenced\r\nPitt’s action.\r\n\r\nAs the insinuation has been endlessly repeated, I may be pardoned for\r\ndwelling on it somewhat fully. The story has been tricked out with a\r\nwealth of details. It is asserted that Pitt issued a Treasury circular\r\ncalling for the attendance of his supporters on the 13th of June, as\r\nif it were for the defence of Hastings. No proof of this statement has\r\never been given; and there are good grounds for disbelieving it. In\r\nthe first place it should be remembered that attendance at the House\r\nhad been greatly thinned by the Whitsuntide holidays. The vacation was\r\njust over; and, as everyone acquainted with Parliament ought to know, a\r\nfull House was hardly to be expected at the first sitting afterwards.\r\nPitt’s letter of 10th June to Eden contains the following sentence.\r\nAfter stating that there had recently been a short and languid debate,\r\nand a division of seventy-one to thirty-three, he continues: “We\r\nshall probably have some attendance next Tuesday when Mr. Fox moves\r\nthe charge respecting Benares; and after that our chief difficulty\r\nwill be to get a House for the next fortnight. In the meantime I have\r\nhardly hours enough to read all the papers necessary on that voluminous\r\narticle.”[310]\r\n\r\nThese are not the words of a man who is about to perform an act of\r\ntreachery. It is clear that Pitt found great difficulty in getting\r\nthrough the evidence on that charge before the debate came on; and\r\nfurther, that he was doing his duty as leader of the House in trying\r\nto assure as good an attendance as the holiday season permitted on\r\na charge of this importance. Wraxall, who here opposed Pitt, makes\r\nno mention of any ministerial “whip” in favour of Hastings, as he\r\nwould certainly have done if he could thereby have strengthened his\r\ncase against him. The fact that neither he nor Tomline refers to the\r\ncalumny proves the lateness of its origin. Further, if a special “whip”\r\nhad been sent out for the support of Hastings, would not some of the\r\nex-Viceroy’s friends, especially Major Scott, have exposed the fraud?\r\nBut no reference to it is to be found in the report of that debate.\r\nAre we also to suppose that the forty or fifty members who changed\r\nsides with Pitt, would have gone over to the accusers if he had been\r\nguilty of such duplicity? Finally, it is clear from the remarks of\r\nGrenville, Mulgrave, and Pepper Arden, that even the colleagues of Pitt\r\nfelt perfectly free to vote as they chose. Mulgrave declared that the\r\nPrime Minister would not be fit to remain in office a single day if he\r\nexpected his friends and associates to give up their opinions on this\r\nsubject. Pitt, as we have seen, had at the outset called on members\r\nto exercise their impartiality; and he now assented to Mulgrave’s\r\nstatement.[311] The story that Pitt sent round a “whip” for the support\r\nof Hastings, and then drove his followers like sheep into the opposite\r\nlobby, may therefore be dismissed as a malicious fiction, at variance\r\nwith all the known facts of the case.\r\n\r\nThen again it is stated by Lord Campbell in his sketch of the life\r\nof Lord Eldon,[312] that Pitt mysteriously abandoned Hastings,\r\n“and--contrary to the wish of Lord Thurlow who had a scheme for making\r\nHastings a peer, perhaps a Minister--gave him up to impeachment.” The\r\ncharge is made in a very loose way; but on it the detractors of Pitt\r\nhave built a theory that Dundas and he feared the advent of Hastings\r\nto the India Board, or to the Ministry, or to the House of Lords. This\r\nstory has been varied and amplified, so that in one version George III\r\nappears as desirous of forcing him into the Cabinet, or granting him a\r\npeerage on the sole recommendation of Thurlow. But the letter which the\r\nKing wrote to Pitt on 14th June shows that, while regretting his action\r\nconcerning Hastings, he respected his conscientiousness, and harboured\r\nno thought of breaking with him.[313] That Thurlow had boasted of his\r\npower to further the interests of Hastings is likely enough; but it is\r\ncertain that the King never thought of thrusting the ex-Viceroy into\r\nthe Cabinet, or the India Board of Control, or of raising him to the\r\nHouse of Lords without the approval of his Prime Minister. The King’s\r\nletters to Pitt[314] show that his chief desire then was to meet the\r\nlarge and growing expenses of his family; and Pitt’s economic policy\r\nmade his continuance in power at that time especially desirable. Royal\r\ncondescension towards Hastings set all tongues wagging; and they have\r\nwagged ever since on the malignant jealousy of Dundas, and the gross\r\ninconsistency of Pitt; but the proofs adduced are of the flimsiest\r\ncharacter. Wraxall and Bland Burges, who later on jotted down their\r\nimpressions of parliamentary life, asserted that Dundas had somehow\r\nbecome convinced that the King intended to eject him from the India\r\nBoard of Control and put Hastings in his place. But neither of them\r\ngave any proof. Wraxall merely stated that “the public believed” that\r\nDundas feared such a change.[315] Bland Burges averred that Dundas had\r\n“by some means” come to know the secret intention of the King, and\r\ntherefore “sedulously fanned Mr. Pitt’s jealousy and uneasiness and so\r\nalarmed his mind that he hurried him on to a decision before he had\r\ntime to satisfy himself as to its justice or expediency.”[316]\r\n\r\nEqually unconvincing is the story, which Hastings himself told some\r\nthirty years later, that on the morning of 13th June Dundas called on\r\nPitt, remained closeted with him for some hours, and convinced him that\r\nthey must abandon the ex-Viceroy. The insinuation conveyed in this\r\nbelated anecdote is that Pitt was then and there won over by Dundas,\r\nand owing to the mean motives mentioned above. The ingrained tendency\r\nof men to seek for petty personal pretexts rather than larger, more\r\ngenerous, and more obvious causes, seems to be the _raison d’être_\r\nof the story and of its perpetuation. There are also some natures so\r\nwarped by partisanship that they naturally refer actions of political\r\nopponents to discreditable motives; and it is a sign of the bias which\r\ndetracts from the value of Macaulay’s “Warren Hastings,” that he did\r\nnot mention the late date at which the story was started, while he\r\ngives it as an historic fact that Pitt’s change of front was “the\r\nresult of this conference.”\r\n\r\nNo statement of what went on at this alleged interview has ever been\r\nforthcoming; but, fortunately, on the all important question of motive,\r\nwe have the clear testimony of one who knew Pitt most intimately,\r\nand whose political differences never distorted his imagination.\r\nWilberforce, who had followed Pitt’s actions closely throughout the\r\ncase, afterwards declared that justice had not been done to Pitt:--\r\n\r\n    People [he said] were asking what could make Pitt support him\r\n    [Hastings] on this point and on that, as if he was acting from\r\n    political motives; whereas he was always weighing in every\r\n    particular whether Hastings had exceeded the discretionary power\r\n    lodged in him. I well remember (I could swear to it now) Pitt\r\n    listening most attentively to some facts which were coming out\r\n    either in the first or second case. He beckoned me over, and went\r\n    with me behind the chair, and said: “Does not this look very ill\r\n    to you?” “Very bad indeed.” He then returned to his place and made\r\n    his speech, giving up Hastings’ case. He paid as much impartial\r\n    attention to it as if he were a juryman.[317]\r\n\r\nHere we have evidence at first hand, though belonging to Wilberforce’s\r\nlater years. Clearly it must refer to the events of 13th June; and\r\nit shows that if any one person was responsible for Pitt’s change of\r\nfront that person was Wilberforce. Late in life the philanthropist\r\ndeclared that Pitt’s regard for truth was exceptionally keen, springing\r\nas it did “from a moral purity which appeared to be a part of his\r\nnature.” He also added that the want of simplicity and frankness\r\nsometimes observable in his answers really sprang from this scrupulous\r\nveracity.[318]\r\n\r\nTo quote the opinion of another experienced politician. William\r\nPulteney wrote to Pitt the following hitherto unpublished letter:\r\n\r\n                                             LONDON, 15th June 1786.\r\n\r\n    I cannot abstain from congratulating you on the line you took on\r\n    Tuesday. It will do you great credit everywhere, but, what you\r\n    will always think of more importance, I am convinced it will have\r\n    the most salutary effects in every part of this great Empire,\r\n    and particularly in India. Such is the powerful influence of\r\n    strict honour and justice in those who govern kingdoms that it\r\n    pervades every mind and in a great degree regulates the conduct of\r\n    individuals. On the other hand, the wilfully permitting persons in\r\n    high and responsible situations to go unpunished and uncensured,\r\n    when guilty of important offences, is sufficient to foster the bad\r\n    and corrupt principles in all other minds and to lay a foundation\r\n    for similar and greater offences. You have my hearty thanks, and I\r\n    am sure will have the thanks of all who understand the importance\r\n    of your conduct.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, etc.\r\n                                                   W. PULTENEY.[319]\r\n\r\nFew persons did understand his conduct, and sensitive pride kept his\r\nlips sealed. Nevertheless to all unprejudiced minds his conduct needed\r\nno defence. On that higher plane where truth and justice are alone\r\nconsidered (for justice is applied truth), Pitt did not swerve from\r\nthe principles which he at first laid down. From the beginning of the\r\nHastings case he had sought to hold the balances even. He left it open\r\nto his colleagues to differ from him. He refused the publication of\r\npapers favourable to Hastings where they compromised the welfare of the\r\nState or the characters of our Indian feudatories. He insisted that\r\nthe charges against Hastings should be clearly drawn up, and that he\r\nshould be allowed to answer those charges in person. On the topic of\r\nthe Rohilla War he did not speak, doubtless because his mind was not\r\nmade up. The fact that Parliament had three times re-appointed Hastings\r\nafter that very censurable event, did in a technical sense screen him\r\nfrom prosecution now. But on the Benares affair, no such plea could be\r\nurged. It was a question on which the present Parliament alone had to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nThe enormous vogue enjoyed by Macaulay’s Essays compels me once more\r\nto notice his treatment of Pitt respecting the Benares charge. A man\r\nof philosophic temperament once expressed a wish that he was as sure\r\nabout anything, as the great Whig historian was about everything. This\r\nassertiveness peeps through the veil of diffidence which Macaulay\r\ndonned before delivering the verdict, that any man with a tenth part of\r\nPitt’s abilities ought to have convicted Hastings on the Rohilla charge\r\nand acquitted him on the Benares charge.[320] In order to establish\r\nthis assertion Macaulay passed by the technical plea above named,\r\nwhich must have weighed with Pitt, and then used his powers of special\r\npleading to whittle down Pitt’s arguments on the Benares case, so that\r\nthey seem to turn ultimately on the trumpery question whether the fine\r\ninflicted on the Zamindar was rather too large or not. But we may ask,\r\nfirstly, was it a small affair to exact half a million sterling from a\r\nprince who during three years had been hard pressed, and as a matter of\r\nfact had paid up the arrears for which that fine was imposed? Did it\r\nconcern the Zamindar alone? Did it not concern all the subjects from\r\nwhom that half million must ultimately be wrung?\r\n\r\nNot only did the conduct of Hastings far exceed the limits required by\r\njustice; it was also bound up with a question on which the stability of\r\nour Indian Empire has ever rested. So long as the feudatories of the\r\nBritish Raj feel confidence in his sense of justice, India is safe.\r\nWhenever they have cause to believe that injustice and oppression are\r\nthe characteristics of his rule, the foundations of the Indian Empire\r\nare shaken to their base. Not without reason did Fox declare that the\r\ndecision on the Benares affair was vital to the preservation of our\r\nascendancy in Bengal. The statesmanlike eye of Pitt, we may be sure,\r\ndiscerned the same truth. Besides, there was an additional reason why\r\nhe should now more than ever resolve to engrave the names of Justice\r\nand Mercy on the newly formed arch of the Indian Government. As has\r\nbeen shown, the recent India Bill placed greatly increased powers in\r\nthe hands of the Governor-General. Burke and Fox had taunted Pitt\r\nwith setting up a despotism from which endless suffering must flow.\r\nThe charge was hollow; but, adorned as it was by splendid rhetoric,\r\nit created a deep impression. Was it not well, then, to show by a\r\nconcrete example that any Viceroy who violated the principles of\r\njustice would meet with condign punishment at Westminster? A statesman\r\nhas to consider, not merely the principles of justice, as applied to\r\nan individual; he must also think of the results of his actions on\r\nthe millions whom they will affect; and we may reasonably infer that\r\namong the motives which led Pitt to break with many of his friends\r\nnot the least was a heartfelt desire to safeguard the relations of\r\nthe feudatories to the Suzerain Power, and to protect the myriads of\r\nHindoos who had no protection save in the dimly known court of appeal\r\nat Westminster.\r\n\r\nOn the charge respecting the spoliation of the Begums of Oude, Pitt\r\nalso cast his vote against Hastings; and again a majority followed him.\r\nIt is questionable whether even the sensationally brilliant oration of\r\nSheridan on this affecting topic moved the House so much as the silent\r\nbut scornful disapproval expressed in Pitt’s vote.[321] The impeachment\r\nwas thenceforth inevitable.\r\n\r\nWith the forensic pageant that ensued we are not here concerned.\r\nThenceforth the case belonged strictly to the legal domain. Its\r\nduration throughout the years 1788–95 was certainly discreditable to\r\nBritish law. Hastings out of his never affluent fortunes spent some\r\n£71,000 in the vindication of his actions,[322] and at last secured an\r\nacquittal. But though men in Europe forgot the case amidst the potent\r\ndistractions of the French Revolution, the effect of it was not lost\r\nupon the Orient. The comparative calm which settled benignly on India\r\nfor twelve years may be attributed largely to a renewal of confidence\r\nin the sense of justice of our people. After the events of the year\r\n1786 princes and peasants alike felt assured that the most transcendent\r\nservices, if smirched with acts of injustice, would never screen a\r\nViceroy from the censure of the British Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH PROBLEM\r\n\r\n(1785)\r\n\r\n    We have the satisfaction of having proposed a system which will\r\n    not be discredited even by its failure, and we must wait times and\r\n    seasons for carrying it into effect.--PITT TO THE DUKE OF RUTLAND,\r\n    17th August 1785.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a story, uncertain as to date and origin, which picturesquely\r\ndescribes Pitt’s indebtedness to the author of “The Wealth of\r\nNations.”[323] Adam Smith had been invited to meet the young\r\nPrime Minister at dinner; but some mischance delayed his arrival.\r\nNevertheless, the guests patiently waited for him, and on his entrance\r\nPitt exclaimed, “Nay, we will stand until you are seated; for we are\r\nall your scholars.” The compliment came with none the less graciousness\r\nbecause the father of Political Economy had in his work incautiously\r\ndefined a statesman as “that insidious and crafty animal.” Pitt was\r\nnow to give a new connotation to the word. Almost alone among the\r\npoliticians of the eighteenth century, he had set himself to gain a\r\nstore of knowledge which would enable him to cope with the increasingly\r\ncomplex problems of his craft; and thus, in an age when a university\r\ndegree, the grand tour, and London club-life were held to be a\r\nsufficient preparation for a political career, he came forth like a\r\nMinerva fully armed at all points.\r\n\r\nAmong the practical questions to which the Scottish thinker turned\r\nthe attention of his age, none was more important than those dealing\r\nwith the relations between England and her American colonies, the\r\ndesirability of an unfettered trade with France, and the need of a\r\nclose union with Ireland. The first of these questions had been\r\ndisposed of by war, and the second will engage our attention in a later\r\nchapter. On the Irish question Adam Smith strongly advocated union\r\nwith Great Britain as conferring on the smaller island the boons which\r\nhad breathed new life into Scotland, namely, freedom of trade and\r\ndeliverance from an oppressive dominant caste.\r\n\r\nThese contentions must have secured the approval of Pitt; for the\r\noutlines of his policy both towards Ireland and France bear a striking\r\nresemblance to those sketched in “The Wealth of Nations,” with\r\nthis important difference, that after the gain of independence by\r\nthe Irish Legislature in 1782 the union of the two Parliaments was\r\nclearly impossible for the present. We therefore find Pitt turning his\r\nattention to the two topics which then chiefly agitated public opinion\r\nin Ireland, viz., the reform of Parliament and the fiscal relations to\r\nGreat Britain. In order to understand Pitt’s handling of these problems\r\nit is necessary briefly to review the course of Anglo-Irish affairs.\r\n\r\nThe story of the dealings of England with the sister isle in the years\r\n1688–1778 is one that it is painful to contemplate. The efforts to\r\ndragoon the Catholic Irish out of their creed, or to grind them into\r\nthe lowest stratum of society, produced a race hatred of which we\r\nare still reaping the dire harvest. The Celt broods over the past;\r\nand his memory clings round the days when Papists were excluded\r\nfrom Parliament, from the possession of freehold estates, from the\r\nprofessions and from juries; when they might not act as guardians\r\nor possess a horse worth more than £5; and when their Protestant\r\nneighbours on tendering £5 could take any horse that pleased them.\r\nAll this and far more may be read in the pages of Lecky. As for the\r\nruffianly enactments of the Irish penal code, many of them were so\r\nmonstrous as to bring their own cure. In the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century even the arrogant Protestant squirearchy of Ireland\r\nfound it impossible or undesirable to enforce them.\r\n\r\nThe growth of principles of toleration and enlightenment which marked\r\nthe years 1760–80 had some effect even on the nominees of Protestant\r\nlandlords and borough-mongers who formed the bulk of the Irish\r\nParliament. It is a curious fact that even the narrowest and most\r\nbigoted of governing castes cannot wholly resist the tendencies of\r\nthe times; and the Dublin Parliament, representing only a part even\r\nof the Protestant minority of Irishmen, was no more able to keep\r\nout new ideas than the members of the pocket boroughs of Britain\r\ncould withstand the Reform movement of 1830–32. The infiltration\r\nof novel principles into the Irish Legislature was slower and more\r\npartial, inasmuch as that body misrepresented even more ludicrously\r\nthe opinions of the mass of Irishmen.[324] It had long been swayed by\r\na clique of politicians who were termed “Undertakers,” because they\r\nundertook its manipulation, ostensibly in the interests of the British\r\nGovernment, but really in their own. The traditions of the past and\r\nthe determination of the members of the Protestant Established Church\r\nto keep the Government in their own hands, formed a massive barrier\r\nagainst change. Yet the dissolving touch of the Time-Spirit and the\r\nshocks of war were at work upon that barrier; and when the war with\r\nthe American colonies and France strained the resources of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland past endurance, it showed signs of giving way on\r\ntwo questions, the one religious, the other fiscal. In the year 1778,\r\nCatholics who took the oath of allegiance were allowed to become in\r\neffect owners of land, that is, they might hold land on lease for\r\n999 years. Further, the odious temptations formerly held out to sons\r\nof Catholics to abjure their creed were also abrogated. That year\r\ntherefore seemed to be the beginning of an epoch of toleration, which\r\nit was the ardent desire of Pitt to crown with an act of justice too\r\nlong delayed.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, we are concerned mainly with his attempt to reform\r\nthe fiscal relations between the two islands. Until the year 1778\r\nIrishmen were still in the state of economic vassalage to England which\r\nthe Parliaments of William III had forcibly imposed. In some respects,\r\nespecially in regard to the woollen industry, they were now worse\r\noff than in that time of humiliation. The enactment of 1699, which\r\nabsolutely forbade the export of her woollen goods, hopelessly crippled\r\nan otherwise promising industry. Nor was this all. Her staple product,\r\nwool, might not be sent to foreign lands lest their manufacturers\r\nmight benefit, and become rivals to ours. That fear was not wholly\r\ngroundless in the case of France; for French weavers found that Irish\r\nwool supplied the qualities lacking in their own wool. The result was\r\nthe rise of an extensive smuggling trade in that article from Ireland\r\nto France, which the Government utterly failed to stop.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war with the American colonies, as I have said,\r\nbrought all these questions to an acute phase; and in 1776 the British\r\nGovernment so far relaxed the prohibitions on export as to allow Irish\r\nwoollens to be exported for the clothing of the Irish troops serving\r\naway from their own country. At the same time Irish fishermen were\r\nadmitted to a share in the Newfoundland and other fisheries from which\r\nthey had been excluded.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was done for the most important of Irish\r\nmanufactures. The linen industry had not been severely hampered by the\r\nBritish Government. While prohibiting the export of fine linens, and\r\nof sail-cloth, in the supposed interests of British manufacturers,\r\nthe British Government granted bounties on the coarse linens exported\r\nfrom Ireland; and up to the year 1771 that industry had greatly\r\nprospered. Thereafter it underwent a serious decline. So alarming\r\nwas the shrinkage of trade and the rise of Ireland’s debt, that in\r\n1778 Lord North’s Ministry was fain to propose the abolition of many\r\nof the fiscal disabilities which sapped her strength. She was to be\r\nallowed to send her products to the British colonies and to receive\r\ntheirs directly in return; but, in order to allay the fears of British\r\nmanufacturers, the old restrictions on the Irish woollen trade remained\r\nin force. Nothing, however, could allay those fears. At once loud\r\ncomplaints were raised from Aberdeen to Plymouth, so that North gave\r\nup nearly all his proposals; and Ireland gained little or nothing from\r\nhis well meant efforts, except that ships built in Ireland thenceforth\r\ncounted as British-built, and could receive bounties granted for the\r\nfisheries.[325]\r\n\r\nWhere reason and statesmanship had failed, force was to succeed. The\r\nutter inability of the British Government to defend Ireland against\r\nthreatened French invasions furnished the pretext for the formation\r\nof powerful Volunteer corps, consisting solely of Protestants, and\r\ntherefore especially strong in Ulster. The Presbyterians of that\r\nprovince, smarting under the civic disabilities imposed by the old\r\nTest Act, and under an equally archaic system of commerce, demanded\r\nredress of these grievances, in the latter of which the more lethargic\r\nRomanists gave them increasing support. Religious antipathies were\r\nforgotten in the face of Ireland’s urgent needs. The governing coterie\r\nat Dublin Castle failed either to check the movement or to revive the\r\nold schisms. It seemed that the intolerable burdens of the British\r\nfiscal system were about to mould the jarring elements of Irish society\r\ninto the unity that marks a nation.\r\n\r\nThough they failed to reach that far-off goal, they for the present\r\nwon a noteworthy success. By combining to refrain from the purchase of\r\nBritish goods they dealt a severe blow at the system thrust upon them.\r\nNor did they abstain from threats of force. The Volunteers paraded the\r\nstreets of Dublin with cannon bearing the motto, “Free Trade--or this.”\r\nIn face of an overwhelming opposition, the Lord-Lieutenant, the Earl of\r\nCarlisle, advised the British Government to give way; and at the close\r\nof the year 1779, and early in 1780, a series of enactments was passed\r\nat Westminster withdrawing the prohibitions on the export of woollen\r\ngoods and glass from Ireland. Commerce with the British colonies was\r\nnow also provisionally thrown open to Irish merchants, and they were\r\nadmitted to a share in the Levant trade.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the cause of religious toleration gained an equally\r\nsignal triumph. The strength of the Ulster Volunteers and the abatement\r\nof religious bigotry brought the Irish Parliament to pass a measure for\r\nrelieving the Protestant Dissenters of that land from the sacramental\r\ntest which had been looked on as one of the bulwarks of the Established\r\nChurch; and in the spring of 1780 the British Parliament gave its\r\ngrudging assent to that boon for Ireland which for nearly half a\r\ncentury longer it persisted in withholding from Nonconformists in\r\nEngland and Wales. As was stated in Chapter V of this work, the Irish\r\nVolunteers in the year 1782 gained another most important concession,\r\nnamely, the recognition of the legislative independence of the Irish\r\nParliament. Fortunately the British Government on this occasion acted\r\nwith grace and dignity. The Rockingham Ministry advocated the change,\r\nwhich passed both Houses with but a single adverse vote, that of Lord\r\nLoughborough. The disagreeable fact, that this last boon, like the\r\nothers, was extorted by force, was thus tactfully glozed over; and\r\nwhen the suspicions of the good faith of England aroused in Ireland by\r\nthat restless demagogue, Flood, were laid to rest by the Renunciation\r\nAct of the year 1783, the relations of the two islands became almost\r\ncordial.\r\n\r\nCauses of friction, however, remained. The royal veto might, and\r\nprobably would, still tell against the Irish Legislature, even though\r\nthe veto of the British Parliament and of the Privy Council had lapsed.\r\nThe influence of the Lord Lieutenant and of his Chief Secretary on\r\nthe Irish Ministers was also great; and his influence was distinctly\r\nBritish. Dublin Castle could also generally determine the votes of a\r\nmajority in both Houses of Parliament. Further, it was quite possible\r\nthat on commercial questions the Irish Parliament would differ sharply\r\nfrom that of Westminster. This seemed so in the early months of Pitt’s\r\nMinistry. The beginning of the year 1784 found Ireland depressed by\r\na very inclement winter; and the cry was raised that her Parliament\r\nshould “protect” her industries, especially that of wool, from English\r\ncompetition. The exertions of the new Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of\r\nRutland, aided perhaps by the reluctance of the more moderate members\r\nto enter on a commercial war with England, sufficed to defeat these\r\nproposals; but the Irish House of Commons, in May 1784, unanimously\r\npassed an address to the King, emphasizing the need of “a wise\r\nand well-digested plan for a liberal arrangement of a commercial\r\nintercourse between Great Britain and Ireland.” This was the friendly\r\nchallenge which Pitt determined to take up. From the outset he made the\r\nIrish commercial question peculiarly his own. More than once in his\r\ncorrespondence with the Duke of Rutland he describes it as the nearest\r\nto his heart.[326]\r\n\r\nNo problem could have been more tangled. Ireland was still in a very\r\nrestless state. Despite the warnings of that uncrowned King of Ireland,\r\nGrattan, the Volunteers began to enroll Catholics and to threaten\r\nthe coercion of the Dublin Parliament. But, as the Duke of Rutland\r\nwrote to Pitt, Parliament “does not bear the smallest resemblance to\r\nrepresentation”; and a petition from a great meeting held at Belfast in\r\nJuly 1784 declared that “the [Irish] House of Commons has degenerated\r\ninto a fixed body so little connected with the people that it ceases\r\nto be a guardian of their property, and hath become the representative\r\nof an overbearing aristocracy.” The petitioners asserted that the\r\ndelegates of the Volunteers were a representative body, and urged\r\nthe King to dissolve the Irish House of Commons.[327] This demand\r\nwas widely echoed. The Volunteers, having already through their\r\ndelegates exerted on Parliament a pressure which was semi-national,\r\nrefused either to let politics alone, or to disband. Ultimately their\r\nrecklessness and the efforts of Grattan undermined their influence,\r\nand they gradually dwindled away; but, for the present, they seemed\r\nable to extort all their demands, prominent among which was that for\r\nthe “protection” of Irish industries and products. In his first long\r\ncommunication to Pitt, the Duke of Rutland dwelt on the urgent need of\r\ninvestigating Irish claims, though he frankly declared that he could\r\nnot understand the commercial question. Open-handed to ostentation, and\r\ndevoted to the pleasures of the table, this affable young aristocrat\r\noccasionally showed signs of political foresight, as when he ventured\r\nto predict “that without _an union_ Ireland will not be connected with\r\nGreat Britain in twenty years longer.”[328]\r\n\r\nFar abler and more painstaking was his chief secretary, Orde, on whom\r\nwas to fall the burden of work connected with the proposed Reform. The\r\nletters which passed between him and Pitt in the summer of 1784 show\r\nthe care taken by both of them to master the facts of the situation.\r\nOrde (the future Lord Bolton) warned Pitt that a resolute effort would\r\nsoon be made to effect the entire separation of the two Kingdoms, and\r\nurged him to “act towards Ireland with the utmost liberality consistent\r\nwith your own safety: it must in the long run be the wisest policy.”\r\nAbove all he insisted, as the duke had also done, on the need of a firm\r\ndecision, which even the malcontents must regard as final.[329]\r\n\r\nPitt on his side sought to procure the fullest information on all\r\npoints. In regard to the Reform of the Irish Parliament he deprecated\r\nany extreme measure such as the admission of the Roman Catholics then\r\nappeared to be; but he advocated the extension of political rights\r\nto Protestant Dissenters; for, as he forcibly put it, “we may keep\r\nthe Parliament, but lose the people.” As for the fiscal question he\r\nrequired first of all a satisfactory knowledge of the facts, so that\r\nsome general principles of action could be agreed on; and he urged that\r\nthe financial relations of the Kingdoms should be regulated according\r\nas the prosperity of Ireland increased with her enlarged commercial\r\nopportunities. Justice required that Ireland should then take her\r\nshare of the imperial burdens, which at present rested almost entirely\r\nwith Great Britain. Finally they must seek some means calculated to\r\nbestow on Ireland that permanent tranquillity which the late commercial\r\nconcessions had failed to secure.[330]\r\n\r\nIn this letter, dated 19th September 1784, we see not only an outline\r\nof the scheme which took definite form in the Irish Propositions,\r\nor Resolutions, of the session of 1785, but also an instructive\r\nexample of Pitt’s methods of procedure. He began by collecting all\r\nthe ascertainable facts, including the causes of previous failures,\r\nand, by sifting these data, he sought to arrive at general principles\r\nwhich would illuminate the whole question. In a word, his method was\r\ninductive. It begun with facts and ended with principles. Unlike the\r\nFrench legislators of 1789–93, who first enunciated principles and then\r\nsought to square the facts of life to them, he started with a solid\r\nbasis and reared on it a structure from whose summit the toiler might\r\ntake a wide survey. The Revolutionists built symmetrically and grandly,\r\nbut without foundations.\r\n\r\nIn order thoroughly to master details, Pitt summoned from Ireland not\r\nonly Orde but also Foster, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Beresford,\r\nChief Commissioner of the Revenue. Both were able and masterful men,\r\nthe former the doughtiest opponent, the latter the staunchest champion,\r\nof Pitt’s Act of Union. Beresford did much to beautify Dublin, and his\r\nname lives on in Beresford Place. With these experienced officials Pitt\r\nhad many conferences at Downing Street, or at the house on the north\r\nside of Putney Heath, which he rented for the latter part of 1784.\r\nThey confirmed Orde’s advice as to the wisdom of granting to Ireland\r\ncomplete liberty and equality in matters of trade, but warned him as to\r\nthe difficulty of drawing from Ireland any contribution to the imperial\r\nfunds. Here it should be remembered that Ireland supported 15,000\r\nregular troops, 3,000 of whom were at the disposal of the British\r\nExecutive in Ireland, while the others could be moved from Ireland with\r\nthe consent of her Parliament.\r\n\r\nConverse with Foster must also have strengthened Pitt’s resolve to\r\npress on the Reform of the Irish Parliament; for he now warned the\r\nDuke of Rutland, who stoutly opposed Reform, not to confuse peaceable\r\nefforts in that direction with subversive or treasonable schemes; and\r\nin a notable phrase of his letter of 4th December, he declared that\r\nParliamentary Reform must sooner or later be carried in both countries.\r\nAs regards procedure, he thought it best to postpone a change in the\r\nIrish franchise until a similar measure came forward at Westminster;\r\nfor this, if successful, would impart to the movement in Ireland an\r\nirresistible force. In the meantime it would be well to take up the\r\ncommercial problem.\r\n\r\nPitt’s sanguine temperament here led him into a tactical mistake. The\r\nIrish Resolutions were destined to arouse in Great Britain a storm of\r\nopposition which swept away the hopes of the Reform Associations; and\r\nthe collapse of their efforts told unfavourably on the Irish political\r\nmovement. Probably also he erred in bringing forward his proposals\r\nfirst in Dublin--a matter on which Fox readily aroused resentment at\r\nWestminster. Yet, where the issues were so tangled, it is difficult to\r\nsay whether success could have crowned Pitt’s efforts had they been put\r\nforth in a different order.[331] From his letter of 7th October 1784 to\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant we see that he looked on the Reform of the Irish\r\nParliament as simpler, but yet “perhaps more difficult and hazardous,”\r\nthan the commercial questions then at stake.\r\n\r\nHere again he calculated wrongly. Ireland’s demand for equality of\r\ntrading advantages with Great Britain was certain to meet with vehement\r\nopposition from our manufacturers, as the events of the year 1778\r\nconvincingly showed. His mistake is the more remarkable as he proposed\r\n“to give Ireland an almost unlimited communication of commercial\r\nadvantage, if we can receive in return some security that her strength\r\nand riches will be our benefit, and that she will contribute from time\r\nto time in their increasing proportions to the common exigencies of the\r\nEmpire.”[332] How buoyant was Pitt’s nature to cherish the hope that\r\nBritish merchants would concede commercial equality to Ireland, or that\r\nthe factions at Dublin would take up the burdens of Empire!\r\n\r\nNo letter of Pitt’s rings with more enthusiasm, though an undertone\r\nof anxiety can be detected, than the very long one of 6th-7th\r\nJanuary 1785. Writing until far past midnight he explained to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant in great detail the aim which he had in view, namely,\r\nthe sweeping aside of all local prejudices, so that England and Ireland\r\nmight become “one country in effect, though for local concerns under\r\ndistinct Legislatures.” The pupil of Adam Smith had caught a clear\r\nglimpse of the truth that States which throw down their customs’\r\nbarriers become effectually parts of the same body. But he now saw that\r\nBritish manufacturers would probably resist so sweeping a change; and\r\nhe pointed out to Rutland that the admission of Ireland to commercial\r\nequality, even in the case of the export trade from British Colonies,\r\nto which, he said, she had no claim of right, involved a solemn duty\r\nto respond to imperial duties. He then pointed out that Ireland would\r\nhave more than mere equality; for Great Britain was burdened by taxes\r\nwhich were the outcome of those duties; and Irish shippers, with their\r\nlighter burdens, might find it possible to export the produce of those\r\ncolonies to Great Britain to the detriment of British shippers. In\r\nmany ways he sought to disprove the claims or excuses put forward by\r\nIrish patriots why they should receive much and give little in return.\r\nHe showed the impossibility of conceding so much unless Ireland would\r\nirrevocably pledge herself to contribute, according to her ability, to\r\nthe expenses of the Empire.[333]\r\n\r\nThe despatches sent by the Home Secretary, Lord Sydney, to the Lord\r\nLieutenant, and the letters of Pitt to Orde, contained precise\r\ninstructions on this last point. Pitt first desired that Ireland’s\r\ncontribution should go towards the navy.[334] Then for a time he\r\nharboured the notion that it should go towards his proposed Sinking\r\nFund, because that money would not pass beyond England, and would\r\nreturn in the form of a trade the balance of which was known to be in\r\nfavour of Ireland.[335] But the Cabinet adopted the earlier proposal,\r\nwith the proviso that the contribution towards the naval expenses of\r\nthe Empire should be made in such a way as the Irish Parliament might\r\ndirect. The letter of George III to Pitt, of 28th January 1785, shows\r\nthat the King insisted on a contribution from Ireland as essential.\r\n\r\nThe ten Propositions, or Resolutions, embodying the aims of Pitt, were\r\nbrought before the Irish Parliament on 7th February 1785. They embodied\r\nthe information gleaned from Beresford, Foster, and Orde; and a report\r\nrecently drawn up by a special committee of the British Privy Council\r\nalso furnished useful information. Modified in some particulars, and,\r\nwith the addition of a Proposition soon to be noticed, they passed the\r\nDublin Parliament with little difficulty. In their modified form they\r\nmay be summarized as follows. Foreign and colonial products were to\r\npass between Great Britain and Ireland, in either direction, without\r\nany increase of duty. The goods and products of the sister islands were\r\nalso to be imported either free or at identical rates; or again, where\r\nthe duties were not equal, they were to be reduced to the lower of the\r\ntwo tariffs hitherto in operation. All prohibitions on inter-insular\r\ntrade were to lapse without renewal, unless it should seem expedient\r\nin the case of corn, meal, malt, flour, and biscuits. The British\r\nGovernment required that, when the “hereditary revenue” exceeded a\r\ncertain sum, Ireland should pay over the surplus as a contribution\r\nto the naval expenses of the Empire. As the “hereditary revenue”\r\nconsisted mainly of custom and excise duties, its increase (which was\r\ngenerally steady) afforded the best index of the prosperity of Ireland.\r\nMoreover that branch of the revenue had hitherto been under the general\r\ndirection of the Crown; and Pitt’s proposal to transfer its surplus\r\nto the control of the Irish Parliament was both statesmanlike and\r\nconciliatory.[336]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the letters of the Duke of Rutland to Pitt revealed the\r\nconviction even of the best friends of Government that the Propositions\r\nwould fail if they were coupled with any demand for a money payment.\r\nThe time, said the Duke, was very critical. They were seeking to\r\norganize a legal militia force in place of the self-constituted\r\nVolunteers; Grattan and Daly had spoken splendidly for the change;\r\nbut the demand for a subsidy would jeopardize everything, even the\r\nconnection with Great Britain.[337] A secret report which he sent to\r\nPitt showed that of the members of the large towns of Ireland, only\r\nLondonderry was well disposed to the Resolutions. In the case of\r\nWaterford (“well governed, under Lord Tyrone’s influence”) the freemen\r\nopposed them while the two members supported them. Belfast, a close\r\nborough, opposed them. In all, he reckoned forty-five members hostile,\r\ntwelve friendly, and the others absent or not accounted for. A list\r\nfollowed of the “expectations” of members as regards judgeships,\r\npensions and sinecures.[338]\r\n\r\nAs Rutland and Orde had foreseen, the assailants of the measure\r\nfastened on the question of the contribution. How could a country,\r\nwhose annual expenditure at present exceeded income by £150,000, and\r\nwhose absentee landlords drained her of a million a year, pay a large\r\nsum to the richer island? Did not Ireland contribute largely in men\r\nand money to the army? And was not a great part of her administration\r\ncontrolled by a Monarch and a Ministry in whose succession and\r\nappointment she had no voice? Such were the invectives of that most\r\nacrid and restless of demagogues, Flood. Far more statesmanlike was the\r\nconduct of Grattan. Equalling, nay excelling, Flood in his oratorical\r\npowers, he held them under the control of a masculine reason. As\r\nhis energy and tact had gained for his land the boon of legislative\r\nindependence, so now he sought to cement friendly relations with\r\nGreat Britain, and therefore gave a general assent to the commercial\r\nproposals. The Irish Ministers also pointed out that Great Britain\r\nopened a far larger market than Ireland did; that the industries of the\r\nlarger island, being handicapped by war taxes and high wages, could be\r\nexploited by Irishmen, whose national burdens were comparatively light,\r\nand that the colonial trade was now to be opened up in its entirety and\r\nfor ever, not on terms that were revocable at the option of the British\r\nGovernment, as was the case in 1780.\r\n\r\nAll these arguments were of no avail to carry the proposal respecting\r\nIreland’s contribution to the navy. Though Pitt had carefully framed\r\nit so that Ireland would pay nothing until she was in a prosperous\r\nstate, he failed to meet the rooted objections of the Dublin Parliament\r\nto money going out of the country. Grattan focused the opposition by\r\ndemanding that Ireland should pay nothing until her Government had put\r\nan end to the long series of deficits. In private conversations with\r\nhim Orde failed to weaken this decision, in which nearly all Irishmen\r\nconcurred. A Resolution to that effect was therefore added. It was\r\nfurther arranged that when the annual hereditary revenue, which then\r\nstood at £652,000, should exceed £656,000 in time of peace, the surplus\r\nshould go towards the support of the imperial navy in such a way as the\r\nIrish Parliament should direct. Additional taxes were then voted which\r\nwere estimated to yield £140,000 a year.\r\n\r\nNo beginning could have been less auspicious. The arrangement was far\r\nless satisfactory than the worst of the alternative plans to which Pitt\r\nexpressed the hope that Orde would never resort. The contribution,\r\non the present terms, could be evaded by any juggling Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer who should contrive a series of small and profitable\r\ndeficits. Consequently Orde, who came to London to persuade Pitt of\r\nthe need of the change, found him inexorable. Pitt was resolved “not\r\nto proceed until the condition should be taken away from the last\r\nResolution.”[339] This also appears in a part of his letter to the\r\nMarquis of Buckingham:\r\n\r\n    [_Secret._]\r\n\r\n                                     Sunday, February 20, 1785.[340]\r\n\r\n    ... I am able to tell you confidentially that we shall certainly\r\n    _suspend_ the final approbation of the commercial system, and\r\n    declare the impossibility of completing it till more satisfaction\r\n    and explicit provision is made in Ireland respecting the object of\r\n    contribution.\r\n\r\n                                                      Yours ever,\r\n                                                            W. PITT.\r\n\r\nIn opening his case at Westminster on 22nd February, Pitt had to\r\ncontend with the discouragement caused by this rebuff, and with a fit\r\nof hoarseness, which he informed Grenville he had been trying to sleep\r\noff without much success. Nevertheless his speech was allowed to be\r\na fine effort. He besought members fairly to consider his proposals,\r\nwhich aimed at settling the relations of the two islands on a liberal\r\nand permanent basis. Glancing scornfully at the tactics of the\r\nOpposition and the campaign of malice and misrepresentation started\r\nby the “Gazetteer” and taken up by various trading bodies, he claimed\r\nthat there should be fair play, at least until he had stated his case\r\nfully. It was complex, and his proposals might need modification in\r\ndetails. The old system of cruel and abominable restraint imposed on\r\nIrish trade had vanished. They now had to complete a new system,\r\nand community of benefits was the only principle on which they could\r\nproceed. They proposed entirely and for ever to open to Ireland the\r\ntrade of our colonies except that of India, which was a monopoly of the\r\nEast India Company. There was no solid ground for the fear that so poor\r\na country as Ireland would become the emporium of colonial goods, and\r\nwould re-export them to our shores. Equally unlikely was the suggestion\r\nthat Ireland would undersell us in manufactures; for British energy had\r\nsecured for our goods a fairly large market in Ireland even against her\r\nimport duties. He then referred guardedly to the subject of Ireland’s\r\ncontribution to the imperial navy. Finally, while deprecating any\r\nimmediate decision, he declared that what England lost by the bargain\r\nshe would more than recoup from the growing friendliness and prosperity\r\nof the sister island. He therefore proposed a general motion for the\r\npermanent and irrevocable admission of Ireland to all the advantages\r\nof British commerce when she irrevocably pledged herself to pay a sum\r\ntowards the defence of commerce.[341]\r\n\r\nThe Opposition, exasperated by Pitt’s ungenerous treatment of Fox\r\nconcerning the Westminster election, at once opened a furious fire of\r\ncriticisms. Fox, who held the old Whig views in favour of a “national\r\ncommerce,” that is, protection, urged that Ireland would probably\r\nsmuggle into Great Britain the produce of foreign colonies, and would\r\nbecome the “grand arbitress of all the commercial interests of the\r\nEmpire.” The Resolutions ought, he claimed, first to have been moved\r\nat Westminster, in which he was probably right. If they were passed,\r\nhe said, Great Britain would never have anything more to concede to\r\nIreland. The Navigation Acts, the source of England’s prosperity, would\r\nbe a dead letter. As for Ireland’s contribution to the navy, he would\r\n“trust everything to her generosity, but not much to her prudence.”\r\nEden, formerly Irish Secretary, then dwelt on the danger of allowing a\r\nlightly taxed country to compete with a heavily burdened country. The\r\ndebt of Great Britain was a hundredfold that of Ireland; and, while a\r\nBriton paid on an average fifty shillings a year in taxes, an Irishman\r\npaid only eight shillings. The plan now proposed would be a revolution\r\nin British trade. These words are remarkable in view of Eden’s\r\ndesertion of North and his assistance to Pitt in carrying through a\r\nstill greater “revolution,” the commercial treaty with France of 1786.\r\nThe speeches of Fox and Eden did some good; their attack on Pitt’s\r\nmeasure convinced Irishmen that it must have many excellences. The Earl\r\nof Mornington (afterwards the Marquis Wellesley) declared that Ireland\r\nwould warmly support Pitt. Beresford also stated that the Irish members\r\nnow only wanted an excuse for siding with him; but England must beware\r\nof pressing Ireland too hard in this bargain. A rebuff would seriously\r\njeopardize the cause of order.[342]\r\n\r\nNo sense of prudence or responsibility restrained the action of the\r\nBritish Opposition and their mercantile allies. A campaign had already\r\nbegun. It bore signs of careful organization. The signal was given by\r\nthe “Gazetteer” of 16th February, which pointed out that the Navigation\r\nActs, the source of Britain’s prosperity, would be virtually annulled\r\nby Pitt’s proposals. On the next day it showed that Irish competition,\r\nbased on low wages, must ruin our industries. On 18th February a\r\nmeeting of silk manufacturers protested against the Resolutions. On\r\nthe 24th the planters and merchants of the West Indies followed suit.\r\nOn that day the “Gazetteer” stated that, if Pitt’s measure became law,\r\nthe Exchange would be transferred from Cornhill to Cork; later on it\r\ndeclared that Arkwright and Dempster would set up their factories in\r\nIreland. On 3rd March the “Morning Chronicle,” the organ of the middle\r\nclasses, joined in the hue and cry, declaring that even as it was the\r\nbalance of trade between Great Britain and Ireland was in favour of\r\nthe latter, and that the larger island must be drained of money by the\r\nsmaller if the old restrictions were not maintained.\r\n\r\nMeetings of protest were now in full swing. Delegates of the West\r\nIndia merchants had an interview with Pitt and declared his answer to\r\nbe unsatisfactory. The merchants themselves refused, by fifty-nine to\r\nforty, to petition against his proposals, but the minority published\r\nand circulated their opinions. The manufacturing towns, except those\r\nof the woollen districts, petitioned strongly against the Resolutions.\r\nManchester, Lancaster, and Dudley each sent two petitions to that\r\neffect; while three apiece emanated from Glasgow, Paisley, and Bristol.\r\nSo the game of misrepresentation went on. A petition from Lancashire\r\ncontained 80,000 signatures; and a document purporting to come from\r\n13,243 weavers of Glasgow and Rutherglen, shows that artisans were as\r\nmuch alarmed as the merchants. The weavers stated their conviction\r\nthat if the Resolutions became law, they would be undersold by the\r\nIrish in the home market and reduced to beggary.[343] This solidarity\r\nof interest is noteworthy. In those days the “manufacturer” was\r\nactually, as well as in name, the weaver; and tens of thousands of\r\nhouseholds, where the hand-loom kept the wolf from the door through\r\nthe winter, saw pale Ruin stalking behind the figure of thrifty,\r\nresourceful, energetic Paddy. The agitation therefore spread through\r\nall classes with a unanimity that would scarcely be possible now,\r\nwhen the term “manufacturer” has come to mean a capitalist who owns a\r\nfactory where nothing is done by hand. Then the solidarity of interest\r\nbetween merchants and weavers was obvious. In imagination both classes\r\nsaw their industries wafted by a cruel east wind to a land whose\r\ninhabitants they disliked and despised.\r\n\r\nSome of the petitions were based on false information. That of the\r\nGlasgow cotton workers complained that the fourth Resolution, as\r\nit left the Irish Parliament, would place a heavy duty on British\r\ncottons.[344] But Pitt had throughout insisted that there must be\r\nan equalizing of duties on both sides of the Irish Sea, the lower\r\nlevel being always taken. In truth, all reasoning was in vain. The\r\nprotectionist spirit was proof against all arguments. Thus, the\r\ncommittee of the merchants and manufacturers of Sheffield declared\r\nthat their industry could not be carried on without grave injury if\r\nthe present duty on bar iron imported into Great Britain, namely, 56\r\nshillings per ton, were reduced to the level then obtaining in Ireland,\r\nthat is, 10 shillings a ton.\r\n\r\nStill keener was the opposition in Bristol. The protectionist feeling\r\nhad lost none of the bitterness which mainly caused the unseating of\r\nBurke in the election of 1774. The sugar refiners of that town now\r\ndeclared that they had spent more than £150,000 in buildings and plant,\r\nall of which would go for naught, if the Irish Parliament, “under the\r\nprivilege of importing raw and refined sugars through that country to\r\nthis [should] lay a heavy duty on loaf and lump sugar and a small duty\r\non bastard and ground sugars and molasses”; for the Irish merchants\r\nwould then “effectually prevent our exporting the former to that\r\nkingdom and also to foreign markets, and enable them to send the latter\r\ninto Great Britain at a less price than it can be manufactured here\r\nunder the burthen of the high duties, the high price of labour, and\r\nheavy taxes, which would inevitably tend to the ruin of that valuable\r\nbranch of trade in this kingdom.”[345] The Bristol sugar-refiners can\r\nscarcely have read Pitt’s proposals, which implied equal duties on\r\nall articles at British and Irish ports; and the Irish Parliament had\r\nagreed to this. The notion that Irish sugar-refiners, by complex duties\r\nof their own devising, would soon beat their British rivals out of\r\nforeign markets and ruin them in the home market, is a sign of the mad\r\nfolly of the time. Against stupidity such as this even the gods fight\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nBy no arguments could the hubbub be appeased. Pamphlets, especially\r\none by Lord Sheffield, denounced the doom awaiting England should\r\nPitt’s Resolutions pass. In a short time sixty-four petitions poured\r\nin against them;[346] and the manufacturers of Great Britain, under\r\nthe chairmanship of Wedgwood, formed a “Great Chamber” in order to\r\nstave off the catastrophe. Yet Pitt’s energies and spirits seemed to\r\nrise with the rising opposition. In order to emphasize the importance\r\nof commerce, he had recently appointed a Committee of Council for\r\nCommerce, which promised to answer the purposes which that ornamental\r\nbody, the Board of Trade (abolished in 1782), had signally failed to\r\nfulfil. The new Council was charged to examine manufacturers and others\r\nas to the relations of Anglo-Irish commerce and the probable effect\r\nof the Resolutions. Similar investigations were made at the bar of\r\nthe House of Commons. Pitt cherished high hopes from these inquiries.\r\n“The more the subject is discussed,” he wrote to Orde on 4th April,\r\n“the more our cause will be benefited in the end.... I do not myself\r\nentertain a doubt of complete success.” To the Duke of Rutland he\r\nwrote on the 16th: “Though we may lose a little in popularity for the\r\ntime, we shall ultimately gain--at least the country will, which is\r\nenough.”[347]\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee is very curious, as showing the difficulty\r\nof obtaining trustworthy statistics even on the weightiest topics. The\r\nIrish accounts showed a far larger export of goods to Great Britain\r\nthan of imports from Great Britain; while, on the contrary, the British\r\nCustom House returns gave the balance of trade as largely against\r\nIreland. The committee could discover no means of accounting for this\r\nextraordinary discrepancy.[348] Thus, while protectionists on both\r\nsides of the Irish Sea were croaking over the decline of their trade\r\nand the growth of that of their rival, the official returns showed that\r\n(as they would have phrased it) the balance of trade was so largely in\r\ntheir favour as to warrant the hope of the speedy exhaustion of that\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nIn matters which were within the ken of the financiers of that age, the\r\nreport was reassuring. The woollen manufacturers of Norwich declared\r\nthat, though the wages of Irish spinners were less by one-half than\r\nthose of English spinners, Irish competition was not to be feared under\r\nthe conditions now proposed. Everett, a London merchant, maintained\r\nthat the British manufacturers, owing to their skill, taste, and\r\ningenuity, would always have a superiority over those of Ireland,\r\nprovided that British sheep and wool were not exported thither. Nine\r\nwoollen manufacturers of Yorkshire were decidedly of this opinion. The\r\nchief clothier of Devizes expected harm from Irish competition only\r\nin the cheaper stuffs.[349] For the cotton industry the evidence was\r\nless encouraging, the witnesses from Manchester claiming that Irish\r\nthread could be spun 20 per cent. cheaper than British thread, and\r\nthat an import duty of 10½ per cent. was needed to protect the home\r\nmarket.[350] Representative silk merchants of London and Scotland had\r\nlittle apprehension for the future, until the Irish workers developed\r\nskill and taste.[351] As for the iron trade, the evidence of eight\r\niron-masters who were examined refuted the reasoning of the Sheffield\r\npetition. Provided that Ireland did not pay a smaller duty than Great\r\nBritain on imports of bar iron, they asserted that they could hold\r\ntheir own against her small and struggling iron industry.[352]\r\n\r\nIn face of the alarmist statements of Wedgwood in public, his evidence\r\nbefore the committee is of some interest. When asked whether he feared\r\nIrish competition in pottery if the duties in both kingdoms were\r\nequalized, he replied that “there might be danger of a competition in\r\ntime, in their own and every foreign market.[353] I should think we\r\nwere safer if earthenware was allowed to be imported free of all duties\r\ninto both countries.” This was the man who headed the protectionist\r\n“Great Chamber of Manufacturers.” Wedgwood’s chief manager admitted\r\nthat he had only the day before heard that any pottery at all was made\r\nin Ireland. Is it surprising that Pitt sharply criticized Wedgwood’s\r\ntactics?\r\n\r\nOther strange features of this report are, first, that the outcry in\r\nEngland against any relaxation of duties was greatest in the case of\r\nthe very articles, calicoes and sugar, in which the Irish Parliament\r\nhad recently imposed higher duties; secondly, that whereas much of the\r\nevidence told in favour of inter-insular Free Trade, the committee\r\ndecided in favour of a system of moderate duties to be agreed on by the\r\ntwo Governments.[354] Some such conclusion was perhaps inevitable in\r\nview of the popular clamour; but the committee made no suggestion how\r\nthe two Parliaments, now drifting into fiscal hostility, were to come\r\nto terms.\r\n\r\nIf the evidence contained in the report had been duly weighed, the\r\nscare among British traders must have passed away; but official reports\r\nare of little avail to thwart the efforts of panic-mongers. In vain did\r\nGeorge Rose, in an unsigned pamphlet, point the moral of the case, and\r\nappeal to the common sense of his countrymen.[355] The Opposition had\r\nthe ear of the public, and the fate of the Resolutions in their present\r\nform was evidently sealed. Probably Pulteney was right in stating that\r\nthe report came out too late to influence public opinion, and that Pitt\r\nhad unaccountably underrated the force of the prejudices contending\r\nagainst him. Now, when the vote on the Westminster Scrutiny alarmed\r\nhim, he became perhaps unduly cautious.[356] This may be the true\r\nexplanation of his disposition to compromise. In his letter of 21st\r\nMay, to the Duke of Rutland, he dwelt on the difficulties arising from\r\nthe unscrupulous tactics of the enemy and the very marked independence\r\nof a large number of his supporters, so that “we are hardly sure from\r\nday to day what impression they may receive.”\r\n\r\nThis avowal is of some interest. It shows how critical was Pitt’s\r\nposition in the spring of 1785. As has been seen in a former chapter,\r\nhe had strained the allegiance of his motley following by taking up\r\ntoo many thorny questions at once. The composite elements--Foxite,\r\nNorthite, and Chathamite--had not yet been fused into unity by the\r\npower of his genius and the threatening pressure of France. Only by\r\nthe most careful leading could he keep his supporters together, and\r\nsave the country from the turmoil which a Fox-North Ministry must have\r\ncaused. There was the danger; and we may be sure that Pitt clung to\r\noffice, not merely from love of power (though he did love power), but\r\nbecause, in the proud words of Chatham, he knew that he could guide his\r\ncountry aright, and that no one else could.\r\n\r\nViewing the question of the independence of members of Parliament in\r\na more general way, we may hazard the conjecture that in the days of\r\npocket boroughs and small electorates members probably acted more\r\nindependently than in the present time, when their action is apt to\r\nbe the resultant of two external forces, pressure from constituents\r\nand pressure from the party “whip.” However we may explain the fact,\r\nit is certain that Pitt, despite his huge majority, failed to carry\r\nthree important proposals in 1785–6; and in the case of the Irish\r\nPropositions he hesitated and lost the day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the second week of May, 1785, the Prime Minister bent before the\r\nstorm, and on the 12th presented his modified measure in the form of\r\ntwenty Propositions. The chief changes were those tending to safeguard\r\nour West India planters and merchants against the secret importation\r\nof the products of the French or Spanish colonies into this country on\r\nIrish ships. He maintained the monopoly of the East India Company in\r\nall the seas and lands between the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of\r\nMagellan, but allowed the Company’s ships to export goods from Ireland\r\nto the East Indies. Further, he proposed that the Navigation Laws,\r\nwhether present or future, and the enactments respecting colonial\r\ncommerce, should be equally binding on both kingdoms. Respecting the\r\nreduction of duties in either country, it was suggested that they\r\nshould not fall below 10½ per cent.; also that no new duties should be\r\nimposed except such as would “balance duties on internal consumption.”\r\nHe also added a Proposition concerning the copyright of books.\r\nRespecting Ireland’s contribution to the navy, Pitt annulled the Irish\r\nproposal asserting the prior need of balancing income and expenditure,\r\nand required that the proposed financial arrangement should be\r\nperpetual.\r\n\r\nIn his speeches of 12th May and succeeding days he showed that most of\r\nthe petitions against his plan were founded on error, and he refuted\r\nthe hackneyed assertion that, because Ireland was lightly taxed and\r\nwages were low, she would therefore undersell Britons in their own\r\nmarkets. Considering her extreme poverty, he said, her burdens were in\r\neffect as great as those of England; her backwardness in industry would\r\nlong cripple her; moreover, for skilled labour she had to pay as dearly\r\nas British employers. He claimed that a liberal scheme of commercial\r\nunion would benefit both islands, just as the Union with Scotland\r\nhad immensely furthered the prosperity of Great Britain despite the\r\nprophecies of ruin with which it was at the time received.\r\n\r\nHis opponents now changed their tactics. Seeing that the Propositions\r\nhad been altered largely in deference to their fears, they could\r\nscarcely meet them with a direct attack. They therefore sought to\r\nprocure their rejection, if not at Westminster, then at Dublin.\r\nCongratulating themselves on having caused the abandonment of the first\r\nproposals, as fraught with ruin to Great Britain, they sought to set\r\nIreland in a flame against the amended measure. It is true that Fox\r\ndeprecated the concession of the proposed advantages to Ireland, on\r\nthe ground that they would subject our workers to the caprices of the\r\nDublin Parliament. But he reserved his denunciations for the proposals\r\nwhich treated Ireland as a subsidiary State, in the matter of the\r\nNavigation Acts. Above all, he declared, he would trust Ireland where\r\nthe Prime Minister distrusted her, namely, in the contribution to the\r\nnavy. Put that to her as a debt of honour, said he, and she would\r\ndischarge it. Compel her, and she would either refuse from injured\r\npride or concede it grudgingly, while perhaps equally withdrawing her\r\nsupport from the army. “I will not,” he exclaimed, “barter English\r\ncommerce for Irish slavery: that is not the price I would pay, nor is\r\nthis the thing I would purchase.” Finally he declared that the House\r\ncould not understand these matters so well as the traders and workers\r\nof Great Britain, who had overwhelmingly declared against the measure.\r\nFox did well to disclaim any positive opinions on these subjects; for\r\nhe took no interest in them, and is known never to have read Adam\r\nSmith’s work, which he scoffed at as a collection of entertaining\r\ntheories.[357] We can now understand his conduct in declaiming against\r\nthe new safeguards for British industry, which he himself had demanded;\r\nand if we may judge from Wraxall, the most telling parts of his\r\nspeech were the personal touches in which he reprobated Pitt’s lofty\r\ndictatorial manner, and his novel connection with the “King’s friend,”\r\nJenkinson. Formerly War Secretary under Lord North,[358] he had\r\nrecently been appointed by Pitt head of the new “Committee of Council\r\nfor the Superintendence of Commerce.” Burke, who must have approved\r\nPitt’s proposals (except the contribution from Ireland, against which\r\nhe hotly inveighed), made capital out of the new “Coalition,” calling\r\nJenkinson Pitt’s pedestal, and wittily declaring that he envied not the\r\nstatue its pedestal or the pedestal its statue.[359] Other members,\r\nincluding Fox and Pitt, skilfully played with the simile, and thus\r\nbeguiled the hours of these otherwise exhausting debates, which, we may\r\nnote, caused Wilberforce to faint in the midst of his efforts to defend\r\nhis chief.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant, though not the least mischievous, speech of these\r\ndebates was that of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. It is needless to dilate\r\non the Celtic charm and vivacity of this great _littérateur_. Descended\r\nfrom an old Irish family, which gave to Swift one of his dearest\r\nfriends, and to Dublin one of its leading actors and authors, he was\r\nborn in 1751, doomed to sparkle. Educated at Harrow, and called to the\r\nBar, he soon attracted attention by his speeches and still more by his\r\nplays. His “Rivals” and “School for Scandal” attested the versatility\r\nof his wit and the cynical geniality of his nature. In 1780 he made\r\nwhat was perhaps the chief mistake of his life in entering Parliament\r\nas member for Stafford; for his character was too volatile his satire\r\ntoo caustic, to ensure success except as a _frondeur_. Friendship\r\nwith Fox condemned him almost entirely to this _rôle_ and exaggerated\r\nthe recklessness of his utterances. He was the Charles O’Malley of\r\npolitics. When, therefore, that engaging political satire, “The\r\nRolliad,” appeared, in castigation of Rolle, the somewhat roisterous\r\nmember for Devonshire, everyone attributed the poems to Sheridan; and\r\nhis strenuous denial found little credence.[360]\r\n\r\nOne of the “Probationary Odes” amusingly hit off the alliance of\r\nJenkinson with Pitt and the increase in the number of the Irish\r\nPropositions:\r\n\r\n  Lo! hand in hand advance th’ enamour’d pair\r\n  This Chatham’s son and that the drudge of Bute.\r\n    Proud of their mutual love\r\n    Like Nisus and Euryalus they move\r\n    To Glory’s steepest heights together tend,\r\n    Each careless for himself, each anxious for his friend.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS\r\n\r\n            Hail! most prudent Politicians!\r\n            Hail! correct Arithmeticians!\r\n    Hail! vast exhaustless source of Irish Propositions!\r\n\r\nElsewhere in dolorous strains the Muse\r\n\r\n  Sees fair Ierne rise from England’s flame,\r\n  And build on British ruin Irish fame.[361]\r\n\r\nIn these witticisms we have the high-water mark of the achievements\r\nof the Opposition. Sheridan inveighed against the exaction of a\r\ncontribution from Ireland towards the navy, and the re-imposition of\r\nthe Navigation Laws (certainly the weakest part of Pitt’s case) as\r\nimplying a legislative inferiority from which she had escaped in 1782.\r\nHe scoffed at the commercial boons as a mean and worthless bribe,\r\nand the whole scheme as “a fraud, cheat and robbery,” fatal to the\r\nconfidence of the Irish in the good faith of Britain. The playwright\r\nfurther exclaimed that it would be a misfortune if the Irish Parliament\r\ndared to pass the Resolutions, and that, as it was not by Parliament\r\nthat the independence of Ireland had been obtained, so it was not\r\nby Parliament that it should be given up. This was tantamount to an\r\ninvitation to the Irish Volunteers to renew their coercion of the\r\nDublin Parliament; and it was now clear that Fox and his friends, in\r\ndespair of defeating the proposals at Westminster, were seeking to\r\nwreck them at Dublin, if need be, at the cost of civil broils.\r\n\r\nIn this they succeeded. By substantial majorities Ministers carried\r\nthe Irish Propositions at the end of May; and the Lords passed them\r\non 18th July. But long before this the storm-centre had moved across\r\nSt. George’s Channel. Throughout the length and breadth of Ireland an\r\noutcry was raised against the state of ignominious dependence in which\r\nIreland would be placed by the contribution now imposed on her for ever\r\nin return for greatly diminished advantages. Fox’s telling phrase about\r\nthe bartering of Irish liberty against British commerce was on every\r\nlip. The results were at once obvious. Though Pitt, with his usually\r\nsanguine forecast, had expressed the belief that the Dublin Parliament\r\nwould be more manageable than that of Westminster, it set at naught\r\nall the Viceregal blandishments. Some of its members even taunted\r\nPitt with acting treacherously towards Ireland throughout. Grattan,\r\nwhile refraining from this taunt, opposed the new scheme, especially\r\nclause iv and the perpetual contribution, in a speech which the Lord\r\nLieutenant described to Pitt as “seditious and inflammatory to a degree\r\nscarcely credible.” Flood excelled himself in recklessness; and in that\r\nbody of usually subservient placemen, leave to bring in the Bill was\r\ngranted only by a majority of nineteen (12th August).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn face of this storm-signal the Irish Government decided to furl\r\ntheir sails and come to anchor. The measure was deferred to another\r\nsession; and of course was never heard of again. Considering the “very\r\ngreat clamour”[362] in the country, this was inevitable; and Dublin\r\nmanifested its joy by a spontaneous and general illumination. Woodfall,\r\nan opponent of Pitt’s policy, admitted to Eden that neither the\r\npopulace nor the members could explain the cause of their recent fury\r\nor their present joy.[363] The excitement soon abated; and it must be\r\nallowed that the popular party in Ireland did not adopt the hostile\r\nmeasures against British trade which might have been expected after the\r\nbreakdown of these enlightened proposals. Lord Westmorland, during his\r\nviceroyalty five years later, admitted that complete harmony existed in\r\nthe commercial relations of the two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThis may have salved the wound which the events of 1785 dealt to\r\nPitt. Up to the very end he had hoped for success in what had been\r\nthe dearest object of his life. After hearing of the ominous vote of\r\n12th August in Dublin, he wrote to the Marquis of Buckingham in the\r\nfollowing manly terms:\r\n\r\n                                   Putney Heath, Aug. 17, 1785.[364]\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n    I have many thanks to return you for your letter. Grenville will\r\n    probably send you the account we received to-day from Ireland,\r\n    after a long period of suspense. The motion for bringing in a\r\n    Bill has been carried only by 127 against 108; and such a victory\r\n    undoubtedly partakes, for the present at least, of the nature of\r\n    a defeat. A motion was announced for Monday last, declaratory\r\n    against the 4th Resolution. The event of this motion seemed to be\r\n    thought uncertain. The probable issue of all this seems to be that\r\n    the settlement is put at some distance, but I still believe the\r\n    principles of it too sound, not to find their way at last.\r\n\r\nTo the Duke of Rutland he also wrote in the same lofty spirit, using\r\nthe words quoted at the head of this chapter, and adding that, when\r\nexperience had brought more wisdom, “we shall see all our views\r\nrealised in both countries and for the advantage of both.”\r\n\r\nFaith and courage such as this are never lost upon colleagues and\r\nsubordinates, especially when they can rely on loyal support from their\r\nchief. Both to the Duke and to Orde Pitt now tendered his thanks for\r\ntheir tact and resolution in face of overwhelming difficulties, and\r\nthus manifested that kindliness and magnanimity which wins heartfelt\r\ndevotion. For, as usually happens after defeat, envious surmises\r\nwere rife. Some spiteful influence (probably that of the Marquis of\r\nBuckingham),[365] had sought to poison Pitt’s mind against Orde\r\nas the chief cause of the failure in Dublin. As for Beresford, he\r\nbelieved that some of Pitt’s colleagues had turned traitors. Lesser men\r\nmight pry into corners to find petty causes for that heart-breaking\r\ncollapse; but no such suspicions mar the dignity of Pitt’s voluminous\r\ncorrespondence, a perusal of which enables the reader to understand\r\nwhy Orde once exclaimed: “I am so sensible of the manly and noble part\r\nwhich Mr. Pitt has acted, that I will die by inches in the cause of his\r\nsupport.”[366]\r\n\r\nThe real reason of failure, as Pitt clearly saw, was the determination\r\nof powerful factions in both kingdoms to wreck his proposals by\r\nrepresenting each concession made to the sister-island as an injury or\r\nan insult, or both. At all times it is easier to fan to a flame the\r\nfears and jealousies of nations than to allay them; and in that age the\r\nsusceptibilities both of Britons and Irishmen were highly inflammable.\r\nTwelve decades, marked by reforming efforts and closer intercourse,\r\nhave softened the feelings then so easily aroused; and as we look back\r\nover efforts of conciliation, not yet crowned with complete success, we\r\nsee no figure nobler and more pathetic than that of the statesman who\r\nstruggled hard to bring together those hitherto alien peoples by the\r\nties of interest and friendship; we see also few figures more sinister\r\nthan those of his political opponents at Westminster who set themselves\r\ndoggedly to the task of thwarting his efforts by means of slander and\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPITT AND HIS FRIENDS\r\n\r\n(1783–94)\r\n\r\n              Keep thy friend\r\n  Under thy own life’s key.\r\n\r\n      SHAKESPEARE, _All’s Well that Ends Well_.\r\n\r\n    A crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of pictures,\r\n    and talk but a tinkling cymball where there is no love.--BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome statesmen merit notice solely from the magnitude of their\r\nachievements; others attract attention by the charm of their\r\npersonality. Pitt claims homage on both accounts. Accordingly I propose\r\nto devote this chapter to his private life and friendships during the\r\nearly part of his career, beginning with the time when he laid down the\r\nChancellorship of the Exchequer and fled to the house of his friend\r\nWilberforce at Wimbledon. In the Diary of the latter we read this brief\r\nbut suggestive entry: “April 3 [1783]. To Wimbledon, where Pitt, etc.,\r\ndined and slept. Evening walk--to bed a little past two. April 4.\r\nDelicious day: lounged the morning at Wimbledon with friends: foining\r\nat night, and run about the garden for an hour or two.”\r\n\r\nWe can picture the scene. Lauriston House, Wilberforce’s abode on\r\nthe south side of Wimbledon Common, is a spacious villa, comfortable\r\nin its eighteenth-century solidity, and scarcely changed since those\r\ndays. One of the front bedrooms is known as “Mr. Pitt’s room.” There\r\nhe would look forth on the Common, which had for him a peculiar charm.\r\nAt the back, the south windows look upon an extensive lawn, bordered\r\nnot too thickly by trees, under one of which, a maple, tradition says\r\nthat he was wont to lounge away his Sunday mornings, to the distress\r\nof his host. At other times the garden was the scene of half riotous\r\nmirth. Pitt, Dudley Ryder, Pepper Arden, Tom Steele, and Wilberforce\r\nthere broke loose from the restraints of Westminster, and indulged\r\nin _foyning_. That old-English word, denoting thrusting or fencing,\r\nconjures up visions of quips and pranks such as Horace loved. Would\r\nthat Pitt had had more time for these wholesome follies!\r\n\r\nImagine these youths, with the freshness of Cambridge still upon\r\nthem, cheating the hours with fun. Pitt, the stately, austere leader\r\nof the House of Commons, who, on entering its precincts, fixed\r\nhis eyes straight on his seat, and tilted his nose loftily in air\r\nduring his State progress thither, with not so much as a nod to his\r\nsupporters[367]--yet here, on the lawn of Lauriston House, is all fun\r\nand laughter, sharpening his wit against the edge of Wilberforce’s\r\nfancy, answering jest with jest, quotation with quotation, in a fresh\r\nmingling of jollity and culture. As yet all is joyous in the lives\r\nof the friends. Wilberforce has inherited from an uncle an ample\r\nfortune along with Lauriston House, and adds rooms to it so as fitly\r\nto entertain the friends who always cluster about him. The woes of the\r\nslaves have not yet struck a chill to his life, and he lives amidst\r\na buzz of friends and admirers. He reminds us of that character in\r\nDisraeli’s “Lothair,” who proved an irresistible magnet at every\r\nparty--no one quite knew why; but every one sought to be next him. The\r\nmagnetism of Wilberforce is easily intelligible; it lay in his lovable\r\nand gifted nature, which welled forth freely in genial anecdote,\r\nfriendly parody, sparkling retort.\r\n\r\nFor Pitt, too, there were as yet no oppressive cares. True, at that\r\ntime, there loomed before him the toilsome career of an impecunious\r\nbarrister, but that did not daunt his serene and self-reliant nature.\r\nDoubtless the troubles of England moved him more, now that the prospect\r\nof peace with America and the half of Europe was overclouded by the\r\ntriumph of Fox and North. But Pitt had that protective faculty,\r\ninherent in all great natures, of laying aside personal and even\r\nnational cares in the company of his dearest friends, and it set him\r\nfree for life-restoring mirth. Then, too, his nature, shy and stiff\r\nto mere acquaintances, blossomed forth radiantly to a chosen circle,\r\nsuch as he found at Wimbledon. Here, then, was seen the real man.\r\nAway went the mask of official reserve, which prudence compelled him\r\nto wear at Westminster as a defence against his seniors. Here, among\r\nyouths and friends, his pranks were startling. One of them must be\r\ntold in the words of Wilberforce: “We found one morning the fruits of\r\nPitt’s earlier rising in the careful sowing of the garden beds with the\r\nfragments of a dress-hat in which Dudley Ryder had overnight come down\r\nfrom the opera.”\r\n\r\nWould that we knew more of those bright days! For Pitt the man, not\r\nPitt the statesman, is seen at Wimbledon. The pillar of State, columnar\r\nin its Doric austerity, becomes a lithe facile form, twined about\r\nwith social graces, gay with the flowers of friendship. The hours of\r\nrecreation, rather than those spent in the office, reveal the inner\r\nlife. Alas! the self-revealing episodes in the life of Pitt are hidden\r\nfrom us. None of his friends was a Boswell. Wilberforce, who might\r\nhave been the enlightener, was troubled by defective eyesight, which\r\ncurtailed his correspondence; and his Diary is a series of tantalizing\r\njottings, a veritable Barmecide feast. As for Pitt’s relatives, they\r\nnever drew him out of himself. Lord Chatham, though a good talker\r\nin general company, seems to have exerted on his younger brother\r\na slightly chilling influence; and their letters were fraternally\r\nbusiness-like. We therefore search in vain for those lighter traits\r\nof character, those sparkles of wit, which enlivened the joyous years\r\n1783–5. This side of Pitt’s character is little more known to us than\r\nare the hidden regions of the moon. We wish to know it all the more\r\nbecause it is not the frozen but the sunny side of his being.\r\n\r\nFailing to catch more than one sportive echo of those glad times, the\r\nchronicler falls back on mere externals, such as Pitt’s occasional\r\nreluctance to attend the parish church at Wimbledon, or his fondness\r\nfor fishing in Lord Spencer’s lake on the lower land east of the\r\nCommon. Clearly the neighbourhood must have attracted him; for in\r\nAugust 1784 he leased the house next to Lord Ashburton’s, on the\r\nnorth side of Putney Heath, scarcely two miles distant from the abode\r\nof Wilberforce. He resided there up to the autumn of 1785, when the\r\nopportunity of buying the house at Holwood drew him to the scenes of\r\nhis boyhood, near Hayes, in Kent. Nevertheless the Surrey Common was to\r\nwin him back. For, during his last term of office, he purchased Bowling\r\nGreen House, on the old Portsmouth road, near the middle of that\r\nbeautiful space.\r\n\r\nThere it was that he fought his duel with Tierney on Whitsunday 1798.\r\nThere, too, he breathed his last, on 23rd January 1806. In the dark\r\ndays that followed on the news of Austerlitz, his thoughts turned with\r\none final flicker of hope towards the news which he expected from his\r\nspecial envoy to Berlin, the Earl of Harrowby, formerly Dudley Ryder.\r\nThe news proved to be heart-breaking. But fancy persists in wondering\r\nwhether, perchance, during the time of waiting, the dauntless spirit\r\ndid not for a brief space fling off the thraldom of the present and\r\nflit across the open to dwell with fond remembrance on that spring\r\nsowing of the flower-beds of his friend Wilberforce.[368]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the severe disappointments of the session of 1785, the signs\r\nof friskiness vanish from the life of Pitt. Up to that time his\r\nhopefulness is of almost boyish intensity. Confidence in himself, and\r\nin the goodness of his cause, and determination to carry out a work of\r\nnational revival, lead him to grapple with great enterprises in a way\r\nthat astonishes friends and baffles opponents. The nation having given\r\nhim a mandate in 1784, he hopes to solve the most urgent of existing\r\nproblems. They are the restoration of public credit, the reduction\r\nof the National Debt, the reform of Parliament, the subordination of\r\nthe East India Company to the control of Parliament, the opening up\r\nof freer trade not only with Ireland but also with France, and the\r\npreservation of peace, so that, as he phrased it--“Let peace continue\r\nfor five years, and we shall again look any Power in Europe in the\r\nface.”[369]\r\n\r\nHere was a programme which transcended anything previously seen. But\r\nto it were added the many unforeseen events and problems that provide\r\na full stock in trade for an ordinary parliamentary leader. The Warren\r\nHastings affair alone would have occupied a whole session under a\r\nquiescent Minister; and we may here note that Pitt’s conscientious\r\ntreatment of it, as a matter on which Ministers and members must vote\r\naccording to their convictions, tended to relax the bonds of party\r\ndiscipline to a dangerous extent.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is only one of his important actions during the first\r\nyears of power that needs apology. This is the persistence with which\r\nhe pressed against Fox the demand for a complete scrutiny of the\r\nWestminster election. Despite the fact that that wearisome and very\r\nexpensive inquiry brought to light few bad votes, and did not exclude\r\nFox from Parliament (for as we saw, he sat as Member for Orkney), the\r\nPrime Minister refused to put an end to “this cursed business,” as\r\nPulteney termed it,[370] until his own supporters compelled him to\r\ndesist. How are we to explain this conduct? It led to waste of time\r\nand temper in Parliament, besides annoying many of his friends, and\r\nstraining to breaking-point the allegiance of his composite majority.\r\nThere can be no doubt that he committed a blunder, and one which\r\nEnglishmen detest; for his conduct seemed ungenerous to a beaten foe\r\nand a violation of the unwritten rules of fair-play.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is likely that he acted, not from rancour, not from\r\na desire to ban his enemy, least of all under any dictation from\r\nWindsor (of this I have found no sign), but rather from the dictates\r\nof political morality. That there had been trumping up of false votes\r\nwas notorious; for the votes polled exceeded the total number of\r\nvoters; and Pitt, as the champion of purity at elections, may have\r\ndeemed it his duty to probe the sore to the bottom. In these days an\r\navowed champion of Reform would be praised for such conduct. In that\r\nage he was condemned; and it was certainly tactless to single out Fox\r\nfrom among the many candidates for whom corrupt practices had been\r\nused. Such an act appeared the outcome of personal pique, not of zeal\r\nfor electoral purity. So at least men looked on it in the spring of\r\n1785. Pulteney, Wraxall, and the ordinary ruck of members failed to\r\nsee anything but personal motives in the whole affair.[371] Fox, who\r\nalways gauged the temper of the House aright, carried it with him when\r\nhe protested that he had little expected to find Pitt acting as the\r\nagent of the Crown in his persecution; that it was clearly the aim of\r\nthe Ministry to ruin him, for he was a poor man. “Yet,” he added, “in\r\nsuch a cause I will lay down my last shilling. If ultimately I lose\r\nmy election, it will be for want of money, not from want of a legal\r\nmajority of votes, while Westminster will be deprived of its franchise\r\nbecause I am unable to prosecute a pecuniary contest with the Treasury.”\r\n\r\nThis is the most effective type of parliamentary speech. It avoided\r\nall reference to the abstract principles which were at stake, and it\r\nappealed with telling force to the sporting instincts of squires.\r\nLittle wonder is it that Pitt’s followers went over to the side which\r\nseemed to stand for fair play to a poor man in his contest with a\r\nspiteful bureaucracy. A few days later Pitt could muster only a\r\nmajority of nine (21st February 1785), and this clearly foreshadowed\r\nthe end of the scrutiny, which came with a vote hostile to Ministers on\r\n3rd March. On a subordinate motion, six days later, several malcontents\r\nreturned to their allegiance, thus proving, in Wraxall’s words, that\r\n“they wished to control and restrain, but had no desire to overturn,\r\nthe Administration.”[372]\r\n\r\nThis affair deserves mention here because it illustrates what was the\r\nchief weakness of Pitt. His secluded childhood, his education apart\r\nfrom other youths, even at Cambridge, his shyness in general company,\r\nand his decided preference for the society of a few friends, gave him\r\nvery few opportunities for knowing ordinary men. He therefore was\r\nslow in understanding the temper of the House, and he never gained\r\nwhat we may call the Palmerston touch. Well would it have been for\r\nhim if he had mixed more with men and shown towards members of the\r\nHouse the affability with which Fox and North charmed friends and\r\nfoes alike. But, like Peel, Pitt had neither parliamentary graces\r\nnor small talk for the lobby. In truth he was too shy or too proud\r\nto unbend with ease. Or rather he did so only in a circle of friends\r\nor among his juniors. Then his sense of fun could go to surprising\r\nlengths, witness that historic romp when Lady Hester Stanhope, two of\r\nher younger brothers, and young William Napier (the future historian)\r\nmanaged to get him down and blacken his face. In the midst of their\r\njubilant triumph there came a knock at the door. Two Ministers were\r\nannounced as desirous of taking his commands on some question. For a\r\nfew minutes State business stood still until the Prime Minister shook\r\noff his assailants and washed his face for the interview. Then the\r\nboys marvelled more at the change of manner than of colour. The Prime\r\nMinister threw up his chin, loftily inquired the cause of the visit,\r\nimparted his decision, stiffly dismissed the Ministers--and resumed the\r\nromp.[373] Clearly there were two Pitts.\r\n\r\nHis rather stilted manners at Westminster were doubtless a\r\nreflection--a lunar reflection--of the melodramatic splendours of his\r\nfather. Never was a colleague or a subordinate introduced to Chatham’s\r\npresence until the effects of light were Rembrandtesque, and the\r\ntelling phrase had been coined. But where the father triumphed by the\r\nforce of his personality, the son only half succeeded. For he was more\r\na Grenville than a Pitt, and he inherited from that family some of its\r\ncongenital stiffness. Hence the efforts which the son put forth, as if\r\nwith the aim of fulfilling the precept of St. Paul to Timothy--“Let no\r\nman despise thy youth”--were calculated, not to impress beholders, but\r\nrather to freeze them.\r\n\r\nFar different was the easy good nature of Fox, which often salved\r\nthe wounds inflicted in the course of debate. It is said that Lord\r\nNorth, after one of the debates on the American War, in which Fox had\r\nmercilessly belaboured one of the Ministers, good-humouredly remarked\r\nto the orator, “You were in fine feather to-night, Charles; I am\r\nglad that it was not my turn to be fallen upon.” Fox, we may add,\r\nreciprocated these sentiments. However he might threaten North with\r\nimpeachment, he was ready in private to shake him by the hand; and\r\nshortly before the fall of that Minister he publicly asked his pardon\r\nfor offending him by his tremendous indictment, adding that he meant it\r\nnot. To us this sounds unreal. Either the indictment against the author\r\nof the nation’s ruin was not quite sincere, or the apology was hollow.\r\nPitt, with his exceptionally high standard of truthfulness,[374] could\r\nnot have tendered it. Fox did; and Wraxall praised his conduct, adding\r\nthat Pitt was less placable, and was wanting in those frank, winning,\r\nopen ways which made friends and retained them through adversity.[375]\r\n\r\nThis rather superficial verdict--for Wraxall knew Pitt only very\r\nslightly--summed up the views of the easy-going mass, which cares\r\nnothing for principles, little for measures, and very much for men,\r\nprovided that they keep up the parliamentary game according to the old\r\nrules and in a sportsmanlike way. It must always be remembered that\r\nfew members of Parliament took their duties seriously, and looked on\r\nthe debates mainly as a change from the life of the other fashionable\r\nclubs. To such an assembly the political philosophy of Burke was\r\nfoolishness, and the lofty principles of Pitt, mere Pharisaism. Its\r\nideal would have been Esau, provided that he had held fast to the\r\ncustoms of primogeniture.\r\n\r\nWe have little or nothing that directly shows the impression produced\r\non Pitt by his discovery of the shallowness and fickleness of his\r\nsupporters. Perhaps it intensified his natural shyness and awkwardness\r\nof manner, which Wilberforce assures us were very great. Certainly\r\nhe did not mix more with men. “Pitt does not make friends” is a\r\nsignificant entry in Wilberforce’s Diary for March 1785.[376] This\r\ninability to make a wide circle of friends was not incompatible with\r\nthose rarer gifts which link a man closely to those with whom he had\r\nreal kinship of spirit. If we may read Shakespeare’s thoughts into the\r\nwell-known words of Polonius to Laertes, the poet supremely admired a\r\nman who inspired the few with ardent affection and held the many at\r\narm’s length. In regard to character, then, we may honour Pitt for the\r\nvery characteristic which to men like Wraxall seemed a blemish.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was a serious failing in a parliamentary tactician.\r\nOnlookers, who saw only the cold and reserved exterior, described\r\nPitt as the embodiment of egotism and pride. His friends knew full\r\nwell that he was the soul of kindness. Dundas and Wilberforce testify\r\nto his affable behaviour to subordinates, his fund of good temper,\r\nwhich was proof even against contradiction and the advent of bad\r\nnews. Wilberforce mentions a case in point. Pitt had long been\r\nruminating on some revenue proposal, and at length mentioned it to\r\nthe Attorney-General, only to learn that there would be grave legal\r\nobjections to the scheme; far from showing annoyance, he received the\r\nannouncement “with the most unruffled good-humour,” and, giving up\r\nhis plan, “pursued his other business as cheerfully and pleasantly as\r\nusual.”[377]\r\n\r\nIt is not thus that a proud and egotistical nature sees his castle\r\nvanish into air. Anecdotes such as this have been known only since the\r\nyear 1897. Now we know the real Pitt; the men of these times saw only\r\nthe professional mask; and therefore we find exclamations like that of\r\nSir Gilbert Elliot who, after hearing the almost inspired speech of\r\nPitt on the abolition of the slave-trade, remarked: “One felt almost\r\nto like the man”;[378] or again Lady Anne Hamilton in her “Memoirs\r\nof the Court of George III,” asserted that Pitt was always cold and\r\ncarried his frostiness even into his carouses.\r\n\r\nThis certainly was the general belief. In one particular Pitt’s\r\nbehaviour often gave colour to the charge of pride or egotism. His\r\nletters were as stiff as his parliamentary attitudes. Worst of all,\r\nhe very often left letters unanswered; and this applied not merely to\r\nbegging letters, against which silence is a Prime Minister’s panoply,\r\nbut even to important matters of State. We find Eden, in the midst\r\nof the commercial negotiations with France, writing from Paris in\r\ndespairing terms about the Prime Minister’s silence, and finally\r\nsuggesting that all his letters of the last fortnight must have sunk\r\nin the Channel. Sir James Harris, too, when fighting an unequal battle\r\nagainst the French party in Holland, begged Pitt to send a few lines\r\nto encourage the hard pressed friends of England. For four months not\r\na line came; and at last Harris begged Carmarthen to cajole a letter\r\nout of his chief: “Is it impossible to move him, _who speaks_ so well,\r\nto write one poor line to these sound shillings and pence men?”[379]\r\nThe excuse doubtless was, that Pitt was overworked in Parliament\r\n(as indeed he stated to Eden);[380] but, even with the then scanty\r\nfacilities for dealing with a vast correspondence, he should certainly\r\nhave handled it with more method and tact. Careless correspondents will\r\nreadily conjecture how much a Prime Minister may harm his prospects by\r\nsubjecting friends and foes alike to a peculiarly annoying slight.\r\n\r\nPitt, then, owed little or nothing to social graces; and Horace Walpole\r\ngave a very superficial judgement, when, in his companion sketches of\r\nPitt and Fox, he stated that the former “cultivated friends to form a\r\nparty.” On the contrary, he harmed his party by cooling his friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men who most helped Pitt to keep in touch with his following were\r\nDundas, Grenville, and Jenkinson. They did not, as Wraxall avers, hold\r\nthe first place in his confidence. That was still held by Wilberforce;\r\nand to their friendship we may apply the apt remark of Montaigne, that\r\nthe amity which possesses and sways the soul cannot be double. For\r\npolitical reasons Pitt after the year 1784 came into closer contact\r\nwith his subalterns, among whom Dundas and Grenville claim notice.\r\n\r\nHenry Dundas (1742–1811), a younger son of the Right Honourable\r\nRobert Dundas, Lord President of the Scottish Court of Session, and\r\nof Anne Gordon of Invergordon, was born at Edinburgh, where he was\r\neducated first at school, then in the University. The atmosphere in\r\nwhich he grew up was strictly legal; and his ancestry, no less than\r\nhis upbringing, seemed to fit him for success at the Bar, at which\r\nhe appeared in 1763. His rise was rapid, and in 1774 he entered\r\nParliament as member for Midlothian. At Westminster he attached himself\r\nto North’s party and became known as a hard worker and hard hitter.\r\nUnited as these powers were with a manly presence, genial gifts, and\r\nthe full fund of Scottish shrewdness, he acquired favour and became\r\nLord Advocate. Grace and persuasiveness of speech he lacked; a harsh\r\nvoice, a still harsher accent, and awkward gestures told against him;\r\nbut above these defects he rose triumphant, thanks to indomitable\r\ncourage, which enabled him unabashed to bear the heaviest blows of\r\ndebate. Napoleon once expressed his admiration of Blücher, because,\r\nhowever badly he was beaten, “the old devil” came up again as though\r\nnothing had happened. So it was with Dundas in his many encounters with\r\nFox. He might be repulsed but never routed. His features were bold\r\nand handsome, and, if they were “tinged with convivial purple,” that\r\nperhaps enhanced their charm. For the House loved a _bon vivant_, who\r\nentertained with lairdly lavishness and had good store, not only of\r\nwine, but of broad stories.\r\n\r\nWraxall, while admitting Dundas’s appearance to be “manly and\r\nadvantageous,” avers that his conviviality was part of a deep-laid\r\nscheme for managing men and tightening his grip on the Administration;\r\nfor “never did any man conceal deeper views of every kind under\r\nthe appearance of careless inattention to self-interest.” The same\r\ninsinuation is wittily conveyed by the authors of “The Rolliad” in a\r\nskit on the Cabinet Meetings which Dundas was supposed to hold in his\r\nvilla. “March 9th, 1787. Got Thurlow to dine with us at Wimbledon--gave\r\nhim my best Burgundy and blasphemy to put him into good humour. After\r\na brace of bottles ventured to drop a hint of business. Thurlow cursed\r\nme, and asked Pitt for a sentiment. Pitt looked foolish, Grenville\r\nwise. Mulgrave stared. Sydney’s chin lengthened. Tried the effect of\r\nanother bottle. Pitt began a long speech on the subject of our meeting.\r\nSydney fell asleep by the fire”--and so on.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Dundas was the great political agent of the age. He\r\nmanaged Scotland, so thoroughly, indeed, that he has been termed “the\r\nforemost Scotsman of the eighteenth century.”[381] No civilian since\r\nthe time of John Knox has ever controlled the energies of that people\r\nso thoroughly as Henry Dundas. What the great Reformer achieved by an\r\nappeal to their highest aspirations, the party manipulator achieved\r\nby an appeal to the purse. Since the collapse of the Stuart cause\r\nmaterial interests had been paramount; and their deadening effect on\r\nnational character appears in the political torpor which lay upon\r\nScotland until the strident call of the French Revolution awakened her.\r\nThe men north of the Tweed had even more reason than Englishmen to\r\ndesire Parliamentary Reform; for, as will be seen in a later chapter,\r\nin all Scotland there were only 1303 electors; and these returned 45\r\nmembers as against 44 who misrepresented Cornwall. But so long as the\r\nScots slumbered, it mattered not whether they had 45 members or 4;\r\nfor the return of 45, and their course of conduct at Westminster were\r\nalike prescribed by Dundas. The soporific fruit which drugged the\r\nScottish people and kept their representatives close to his heel was\r\n“patronage.” Dundas it was who dispensed all important prizes both in\r\nChurch and State. Valuable livings at home, lucrative posts in India\r\nor speedy advancement in the navy, these and many other rewards were\r\nin his hands. His influence at the Admiralty and at the India Board of\r\nControl was immense; he worked hard for his men; and it may be admitted\r\nthat his choice of officials, especially for India, was often sound.\r\nCertain it is that he opened up golden avenues to hundreds of poor\r\nScottish families, so that he was often hailed as the benefactor of his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Dundas conferred a substantial boon. He persuaded Pitt\r\nto extinguish the embers of hatred to the reigning dynasty which still\r\nsmouldered in the Highlands, by restoring the estates that were\r\nconfiscated after the “Forty-five.” By this act of clemency Pitt and\r\nDundas linked their names to the work of reconciliation so tactfully\r\nbegun by Chatham, and helped to foster the sentiment of British\r\nnationality, which bore a rich harvest on the fields of Salamanca\r\nand Waterloo. It is not surprising, then, that Dundas had the small\r\ngoverning clique in Scotland entirely at his beck and call. One of his\r\nforty-five henchmen at Westminster, Ferguson of Pitfour, frankly stated\r\nthat he had never heard a speech which had influenced his vote, and\r\nthat there was only one defect in Dundas’s leadership, namely, that he\r\nwas not quite tall enough to enable his followers readily to see into\r\nwhich lobby he was going at division-time.[382]\r\n\r\nEven so, the magnetic influence of Dundas upon the obedient Caledonian\r\nsquad was a political asset of no small worth. Not seldom could\r\nthe laird of Melville decide the fate of Cabinets by throwing his\r\nforty-five votes into this or that scale. He himself was fully aware of\r\nhis importance; for in a letter which he wrote to Grenville early in\r\n1789, he declined another official post because in his present position\r\n(or positions) he was “a cement of political strength to the present\r\nAdministration,” the dissolution of which might be ruinous. The words\r\nare instinct, not only with the Scottish canniness, but with Scottish\r\nloyalty. In truth, the staunchness of Dundas’s friendship to Pitt\r\nsuffices to refute those critics, both of his own and later times, who\r\nspeak of him as of a political Vicar of Bray. In his early days his\r\ntrimming propensities were often disagreeably prominent; and the speech\r\nin which he hailed the rising sun of Pitt, and slighted the waning\r\norb of North, was quite characteristic of the earlier half of his\r\ncareer.[383] But, for him as for some others, the splendour of Pitt’s\r\ngenius, and the glow of his pure patriotism, inaugurated a brighter\r\nfuture; and he might well say of his tergiversation at that time what\r\nTalleyrand said of his still more numerous changes of front: “I have\r\nnever deserted a party before it deserted itself.” While recognizing\r\nin this new ally great powers of work, and still greater powers of\r\n“influence,” Pitt did not at once give him his whole confidence; and\r\nwe shall probably not be far wrong in inferring that only after the\r\ndisillusionment of the spring of 1785, did “Henry VIIIth of Scotland”\r\nbecome his counsellor on matters of the highest moment. Thenceforth\r\nhis influence over Pitt steadily increased, while that of Wilberforce\r\nsomewhat waned; and we find the latter declaring at a later time that\r\nPitt’s connection with Dundas was his “great misfortune,” a remark\r\nwhich applied mainly to the slavery question.[384] It is, however,\r\nstill more applicable to Dundas’s conduct of the war, when, as we\r\nshall see, his absorption in other work, and his utter inexperience of\r\nmilitary affairs, should have made him backward in giving advice. Far\r\nfrom that, he was for some time the guiding spirit; and from his seat\r\nat the Home Office or the India Board, or from his suburban villa, he\r\ndashed off orders of momentous import, which were to gladden the heart\r\nof Carnot.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the man at whose house, on the west side of Wimbledon\r\nCommon, Pitt was a frequent visitor. There the conviviality was\r\nunrestrained by those scruples which more and more prevailed at\r\nWilberforce’s abode hard by; and after the latter gave up that villa,\r\nin the autumn of 1786, the associations of Pitt with Wimbledon are\r\nsomewhat vinous. Both Pitt and Dundas were hard drinkers. The former\r\nfrequently tossed off several tumblers of port wine before a great\r\nspeech in the House of Commons; and it would seem, if rumour spoke\r\ntruly, that at Dundas’s the potations were long and deep. It must not,\r\nhowever, be supposed that Pitt performed no serious work there. The\r\nlong and important despatches which he wrote at Wimbledon show the\r\ncontrary; and their contents prove them to have been written before\r\nthe Bacchic pleasures, which men of that age deemed the appropriate\r\nclose of a busy day. Only once did the pleasures of dessert at Dundas’s\r\ncause Pitt and his host to compromise themselves in public. But on one\r\noccasion they came to the House of Commons obviously the worse for\r\nliquor. The occasion was equally remarkable. It was on the acceptance\r\nof the French Declaration of War, in February 1793. Fox generously\r\nforebore from taking advantage of his rival’s incapacity,[385] but the\r\nsituation was hit off in the following lines:\r\n\r\n  I cannot see the Speaker, Hal, can you?\r\n  What! Cannot see the Speaker, I see two.\r\n\r\nA man so frank and intriguing, so subtle and pugnacious as Dundas, is\r\nfair game for the satirist; and it is not surprising that the Whig\r\nrhymsters who compiled the “Rolliad” scourged the factotum of Caledonia:\r\n\r\n            Whose exalted soul\r\n  No bonds of vulgar prejudice control.\r\n  Of shame unconscious in his bold career\r\n  He spurns that honour which the weak revere;\r\n  For, true to public Virtue’s patriot plan,\r\n  He loves the _Minister_ and not the _Man_.\r\n  Alike the advocate of North and Wit,\r\n  The friend of Shelburne and the guide of Pitt,\r\n  His ready tongue with sophistries at will\r\n  Can say, unsay, and be consistent still.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, the effusion of unscrupulous party hacks; but it\r\nshows the skill with which the enemies of Dundas seized on the weak\r\npoints in his career. As a matter of fact, few men have worked harder\r\nthan the future Viscount Melville, and on few men has fortune at the\r\nclose pressed more unkindly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilliam Wyndham Grenville (1759–1834) is a less interesting man than\r\nDundas. First cousin to Pitt, and born in the same year, he seemed\r\ndestined to advance hand in hand with him, just as his father had\r\nsignally helped Chatham in certain parts of that meteoric career.\r\nNature, however, had clearly designed the Grenvilles, both father\r\nand son, not to be comets, scarcely planets, but rather satellites.\r\nThe traditional pride of the Grenvilles (in which Pitt was by no\r\nmeans lacking) appeared in William Grenville, blended with a freezing\r\nmanner, the effect of which was enhanced by his heavy features and\r\nstiff carriage. To counterbalance these defects, he was dowered with\r\nan upright and virtuous disposition, great industry, a choice store of\r\nclassical learning, good sense, though not illuminated by imagination,\r\nand oratorical gifts, which, if neither majestic nor pleasing, partook\r\nof his native solidity. As Paymaster of the Forces (conjointly with\r\nLord Mulgrave) he did useful work, the higher branches of which\r\ninvolved questions of foreign policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                              _Emery Walker Ph. sc._\r\n\r\n  _William Wyndham, Lord Grenville\r\n  from a painting by Hoppner_\r\n]\r\n\r\nPitt’s appreciation of his sound sense appeared in his choice of\r\nGrenville for very delicate diplomatic missions to The Hague and\r\nParis in the crisis of 1787. The evenness of his judgement and temper\r\nprocured him the Speakership of the House of Commons in 1789,\r\nafter the death of Cornwall. From this honourable post he was soon\r\ntransferred to more congenial duties, as Secretary of State, and\r\nentered the Upper House as Lord Grenville. In 1791 he became Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, his conduct of which will engage our attention\r\nlater on. Here we may note that in all his undertakings he gained a\r\nreputation for soundness; and if the neutral tints of his character\r\nprocured for him neither the enthusiastic love of friends nor the\r\nhatred of foes, he won the respect of all. The envious railers who\r\npenned the “Rolliad” could fasten on nothing worse than his solidity--\r\n\r\n  A youth who boasts no common share of head.\r\n  What plenteous stores of knowledge may contain\r\n  The spacious tenement of Grenville’s brain!\r\n  Nature, in all her dispensations wise,\r\n  Who formed his head-piece of so vast a size,\r\n  Hath not, ’tis true, neglected to bestow\r\n  Its due proportion to the part below.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, though Grenville could manage business, he could not\r\nmanage men; and at this point he failed to make good a defect in\r\nthe political panoply of Pitt. On neither of the cousins had nature\r\nbestowed the social tact which might have smoothed the rubs of\r\ndiplomatic discussion, say, in those with the French envoy, Chauvelin,\r\nin 1792. That fervid royalist, Hyde de Neuville, complained bitterly\r\nof the freezing powers of Downing Street. The enthusiastic young\r\nCanning found it impossible to work with Grenville, who was also on\r\nstrained terms with Dundas. The “inner Cabinet,” composed of Pitt,\r\nGrenville, Dundas, must have been the scene of many triangular duels;\r\nand it needed all the mental and moral superiority of Pitt (as to which\r\nevery one bears witness) to preserve even the appearance of harmony\r\nbetween seconds who were alike opinionated, obstinate, and covetous of\r\npatronage.[386] On the whole, the personality of Grenville must rank\r\namong the dullest of that age. I have found no striking phrase which\r\nglitters amidst the leaden mass of his speeches and correspondence. His\r\nlife has never been written. He would be a very conscientious zealot\r\nwho would undertake it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning to the central figure of the group, we have once more to\r\nmourn the lack of information about those smaller details which light\r\nup traits of character. Few of Pitt’s letters refer to his private\r\naffairs in the years 1784–86; and the knowledge which we have of them\r\nis largely inferential. Even the secondary sources fared badly; for it\r\nseems that Pitt’s housemaid made a holocaust of the many letters which\r\nWilberforce wrote to him during his foreign tour in 1785.[387] In the\r\nPitt Papers there is only one letter of Wilberforce of this period; and\r\nas it throws light on their friendship and the anxiety felt by Pitt’s\r\nfriends at the time of the Irish Propositions, I print it here almost\r\n_in extenso_.[388]\r\n\r\n                                           Lausanne, 2nd Aug., 1785.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR PITT,\r\n\r\n    ... If I were to suffer myself to think on politics, I should be\r\n    very unhappy at the accounts I hear from all quarters: nothing\r\n    has come from any great authority; but all the reports, such as\r\n    they are, are of one tendency. I repose myself with confidence on\r\n    you, being sure that you have spirit enough not to be deterred by\r\n    difficulties if you can carry your point thro’; and trusting that\r\n    you will have that greater degree of spirit which is requisite to\r\n    make a person give up at once when the bad consequences which would\r\n    follow his going on are at a distance. Yet I cannot help being\r\n    extremely anxious: your own character, as well as the welfare of\r\n    the country are at stake; but we may congratulate ourselves that\r\n    they are here inseparably connected. In the opinion of unprejudiced\r\n    men I do not think you will suffer from adjourning the Irish\r\n    propositions _ad calendas Graecas_, if the state of Ireland makes\r\n    it dangerous to proceed and you can make it evident you had good\r\n    reason to bring them on, which I think you can. At the worst, the\r\n    consequences on this side are only that you suffer (the Country\r\n    may suffer too, but I am taking for granted this is the lesser\r\n    evil); but I tremble and look forward to what may happen if the\r\n    Irish Parliament should pass the propositions, and the Irish nation\r\n    refuse to accept them; nor would it be one struggle only; but as\r\n    often as any Bill should come over from our House of Commons to\r\n    be passed in theirs, which was obnoxious, there would be a fresh\r\n    opportunity for reviving it, especially as you have an Opposition\r\n    to deal with as unprincipled and mischievous as ever embroiled the\r\n    affairs of any country. God bless you, my dear Pitt and carry you\r\n    thro’ all your difficulties! You may reckon yourself most fortunate\r\n    in that chearfulness of mind which enables you every now and then\r\n    to throw off your load for a few hours and rest yourself. I fancy\r\n    it must have been this which, when I am with you, prevents my\r\n    considering you as an object of compassion, tho’ Prime Minister\r\n    of England; for now, when I am at a distance, out of hearing of\r\n    your foyning, and your (illegible) other proofs of a light heart,\r\n    I cannot help representing you to myself as oppressed with cares\r\n    and troubles, and what I feel for you is more, I believe, than even\r\n    Pepper feels in the moments of his greatest anxiety; and what can I\r\n    say more?...\r\n\r\nPepper Arden, to whom Wilberforce here refers, scarcely lived up to his\r\nname. His character and his countenance alike lacked distinction. The\r\nlatter suffered from the want of a nose, or at least, of an effectively\r\nimposing feature. What must this have meant in a generation which\r\nremembered the effect produced by Chatham’s “terrifying beak,” and was\r\ndominated by the long and concave curve on which Pitt suspended the\r\nHouse of Commons! Further, Pepper lacked dignity. His manner was noisy\r\nand inelegant.[389] He pushed himself forward as a Cambridge friend of\r\nPitt; and the House resented the painful efforts of this flippant young\r\nman to run in harness by the side of the genius. Members roared with\r\nlaughter when Arden marched in, at Christmastide of 1783, to announce\r\nthat Pitt, as Prime Minister of the Crown, would offer himself for\r\nre-election. The effrontery of the statement was heightened by the\r\nvoice and bearing of the speaker. Nevertheless, Pitt, as we have seen,\r\nmade him Attorney-General. No appointment called forth more criticism.\r\nHe entered the peerage as Lord Alvanley.\r\n\r\nIt is the characteristic of genius to attract and inspire the young;\r\nand Pitt’s influence on them was second only to that of Chatham. As\r\nwe shall see later on, Canning caught the first glow of political\r\nenthusiasm from the kindling gaze of the young Prime Minister.\r\nPatriotism so fervid, probity so spotless, eloquence so moving fired\r\ncooller natures than Canning’s; and among the most noteworthy of\r\nthose who now came forward was Henry Addington. His father, Anthony\r\nAddington, had started life as a medical man in Reading, and afterwards\r\nin Bedford Row, London, where Henry was born in 1754. In days when\r\nthat profession held a lower place than at present, this fact was to\r\nbe thrown in the teeth of the son on becoming Prime Minister. Chatham,\r\nhowever, always treated his family physician (for such Addington\r\nbecame) with chivalrous courtesy. Largely by the care of the doctor\r\nWilliam Pitt was coaxed into maturity after his “wan” youth.[390] It\r\nwas natural, then, that the sons should become acquainted, especially\r\nas young Addington, after passing through Winchester School and\r\nBrasenose College, Oxford, entered at Lincoln’s Inn while Pitt was\r\nstill keeping his terms there.\r\n\r\nConsidering the community of their studies and tastes, it is singular\r\nthat few, if any, of their letters of this period survive. Such as\r\nhave come down to us are the veriest scraps. Here, then, as elsewhere,\r\nsome evil destiny (was it Bishop Tomline?) must have intervened to\r\nblot out the glimpses of the social side of the statesman’s life.\r\nIt is clear, however, that Pitt must have begun to turn Addington’s\r\nthoughts away from Chancery Lane to Westminster; for the latter in 1783\r\nwrites eagerly against “the offensive Coalition of Fox and North.” At\r\nChristmas, when Pitt leaped to office as Prime Minister, he sought to\r\nbring Addington into the political arena, and held out the prospect\r\nof some subordinate post. Addington accordingly stood for Devizes,\r\nand was chosen by a unanimous vote at the hustings in April 1784.\r\nNevertheless, his cool and circumspect nature rose slowly to the height\r\nof the situation at Westminster. Externals were all in his favour.\r\nHis figure was tall and well proportioned; his features, faultlessly\r\nregular, were lit up by a benevolent smile; and his deferential manners\r\ngave token of success either as family physician or family attorney.\r\nIn fine, a man who needed only the spur of ambition, or the stroke of\r\ncalamity, to achieve a respectable success. It is said that Pitt early\r\nbade him fix his gaze on the Speaker’s chair, to which, in fact, he\r\nhelped him in 1789, after Grenville’s retirement. But, for the present,\r\nnothing stirred Addington’s nature from its exasperating calm. As\r\nworldly inducements failed, Pitt finally made trial of poetry. During a\r\nride together to Pitt’s seat at Holwood, the statesman sought in vain\r\nto appeal to his ambition; but Addington--five years his senior, be\r\nit remembered--pleaded the disqualifying effects of early habits and\r\ndisposition. Thereupon Pitt burst out with the following passage from\r\nWaller’s poem on Henrietta Maria:\r\n\r\n  The lark that shuns on lofty boughs to build\r\n  Her humble nest, lies silent in the field;\r\n  But should the promise of a brighter day,\r\n  Aurora smiling, bid her rise and play,\r\n  Quickly she’ll show ’twas not for want of voice,\r\n  Or power to climb, she made so low a choice;\r\n  Singing she mounts; her airy notes are stretch’d\r\n  Towards heaven, as if from heaven alone her notes she fetch’d.\r\n\r\nThen the statesman set spurs to his horse and left Addington far\r\nbehind.[391] It is curious that when Addington’s ambition was fully\r\naroused, it proved to be an obstacle to Pitt and a danger to the\r\ncountry in the crisis of 1803–4.\r\n\r\nAdverting now to certain details of Pitt’s private life, we notice\r\nthat he varied the time of his first residence on Putney Heath (August\r\n1784–November 1785) by several visits to Brighthelmstone, perhaps in\r\norder to shake off the fatigue and disappointment attendant on his\r\nIrish and Reform policy. At that seaside resort he spent some weeks in\r\nthe early autumn of 1785, enjoying the society of his old Cambridge\r\nfriends, “Bob” Smith (afterwards Lord Carrington), Pratt (afterwards\r\nLord Camden), and Steele. We can imagine them riding along the quaint\r\nlittle front, or on the downs, their interchange of thought and sallies\r\nof wit probably helping in no small degree the invigorating influences\r\nof sea air and exercise. If we may trust the sprightly but spiteful\r\nlines in one of the “Political Eclogues,” it was at Brighton that Pitt\r\nat these times especially enjoyed the society of “Tom” Steele, whom he\r\nhad made Secretary of the Treasury conjointly with George Rose. Unlike\r\nhis colleague, whose visage always bore signs of the care and toil of\r\nhis office, Steele was remarkable for the rotundity and joviality of\r\nhis face and an inexhaustible fund of animal spirits.[392] Perhaps\r\nit was this which attracted Pitt to him in times of recreation. The\r\nlines above referred to occur in an effusion styled--“Rose, or the\r\nComplaint,”--where the hard working colleague is shown as bemoaning\r\nPitt’s preference for Steele:\r\n\r\n  But vain his hope to shine in Billy’s eyes,\r\n  Vain all his votes, his speeches, and his lies.\r\n  Steele’s happier claims the boy’s regard engage,\r\n  Alike their studies, nor unlike their age:\r\n  With Steele, companion of his vacant hours,\r\n  Oft would he seek Brighthelmstone’s sea-girt towers;\r\n  For Steele relinquish Beauty’s trifling talk,\r\n  With Steele each morning ride, each evening walk;\r\n  Or in full tea-cups drowning cares of state\r\n  On gentler topics urge the mock debate.\r\n\r\nHowever much Pitt enjoyed Steele’s company on occasions like these,\r\nhe did not allow his feelings to influence him when a question of\r\npromotion arose. Steele’s talents being only moderate, his rise was\r\nslow, but he finally became one of the Paymasters of the Forces. In\r\nthat station his conduct was not wholly satisfactory; and Pitt’s\r\nfriendship towards him cooled, though it was renewed not long before\r\nthe Prime Minister’s death.\r\n\r\nFor George Rose, on the other hand, despite his lack of joviality, Pitt\r\ncherished an ever deepening regard proportioned to the thoroughness and\r\ntactfulness of his services at the Treasury. In view of the vast number\r\nof applications for places and pensions, of which, moreover, Burke’s\r\nEconomy Bill had lessened the supply, the need of firm control at the\r\nTreasury is obvious; and Pitt and the country owed much to the man\r\nwho for sixteen years held the purse-strings tight.[393] On his part\r\nRose felt unwavering enthusiasm for his chief from the time of their\r\nfirst interview in Paris in 1783 until the dark days that followed\r\nAusterlitz. Only on two subjects did he refuse to follow Pitt, namely,\r\non Parliamentary Reform, from which he augured “the most direful\r\nconsequences,” and the Slavery Question. That he ventured twice to\r\ndiffer decidedly from Pitt (in spite of earnest private appeals) proves\r\nhis independence of mind as well as the narrowness of his outlook.\r\nHe even offered to resign his post at the Treasury owing to their\r\ndifference on Reform, but Pitt negatived this proposal. We need not\r\naccept his complacent statement that Pitt later on came over decidedly\r\nto his opinion on that topic.[394]\r\n\r\nThe tastes of the two friends were very similar, especially in their\r\nlove of the country; and it was in the same month (September 1785)\r\nthat each bought a small estate. We find Pitt writing at that time to\r\nWilberforce respecting his purchase of “Holwood Hill,” near Bromley,\r\nKent, and stating that Rose had just bought an estate in the New\r\nForest, which he vowed was “just breakfasting distance from town.” “We\r\nare all turning country gentlemen very fast,” added the statesman. A\r\nharassing session like that of 1785 is certain to set up a centrifugal\r\ntendency; and we may be sure that the nearness of Holwood to Hayes was\r\na further attraction. Not that Pitt was as yet fond of agriculture.\r\nHe had neither the time nor the money to spare for the high farming\r\nwhich was then yearly adding to the wealth of the nation. But he\r\ninherited Chatham’s love of arranging an estate, and he was now to\r\nfind the delight of laying out grounds, planting trees and shrubs and\r\nwatching their growth. Holwood had many charms--“a most beautiful spot,\r\nwanting nothing but a house fit to live in”--so he described it to\r\nWilberforce.[395] He moved into his new abode on 5th November 1785, and\r\nduring the rest of the vacation spent most of his time there, residing\r\nat Downing Street only on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Many\r\naffairs of State were decided at parties at Holwood, or, later on, at\r\nDundas’s villa at Wimbledon.\r\n\r\nPitt admitted to Wilberforce that the purchase of Holwood was a piece\r\nof folly; and this was soon apparent to all Pitt’s friends who had\r\nold-fashioned notions of making both ends meet. That desirable result\r\nhad rarely, if ever, been attained by the son of the magnificent\r\nChatham. Sparing for the nation’s exchequer, Pitt was prodigal of\r\nhis own. The aristocratic _hauteur_, of which all but his friends\r\ncomplained, led him to disregard the peccadilloes of servants and the\r\novercharges of tradesmen. A bachelor Prime Minister, whose nose is\r\nhigh in air, is good sport for parasites; and even before the purchase\r\nof Holwood, Pitt was in difficulties. During one of the visits to\r\nBrighthelmstone, “Bob” Smith undertook to overhaul his affairs, and\r\nfound old and forgotten bills amounting to £7,914. The discovery came\r\nas a shock; for Pitt, with his usual hopefulness, had told his Mentor\r\nthat, as three-quarters of his official salary were due, he would have\r\nenough for his current liabilities. A further scrutiny showed that\r\ntradesmen, in default of any present return, took care to ensure an\r\nabundant harvest in the future. The butcher usually sent, or charged\r\nfor, three or four hundredweight of meat on a Saturday, probably\r\nbecause Pitt was often away for the week-end. The meat bill for\r\nJanuary 1785, when Pitt generally dined out, was £96, which, reckoning\r\nthe price at sixpence a pound, implied a delivery of 34 hundredweight.\r\nOther bills for provisions (wrote Smith to Wilberforce) “exceed\r\nanything I could have imagined.” Apparently they rose in proportion\r\nto Pitt’s absence from home. His accounts were kept by a man named\r\nWood, whose book-keeping seems to have been correct; but Smith begged\r\nWilberforce to urge on Pitt the need of an immediate reform of his\r\nhousehold affairs.[396] Whether it took place, we cannot tell; for this\r\nis one of the private subjects over which Bishop Tomline chose to draw\r\nthe veil of propriety.\r\n\r\nAn economical householder would have found relief from the addition\r\nof £3,000 a year to his income. That was the net sum which accrued\r\nto him after August 1792, from the Lord Wardenship of the Cinque\r\nPorts.[397] That Pitt felt more easy in his mind is clear from his\r\nletter to Lady Chatham, dated Downing Street, 11th November 1793. She\r\nhad been in temporary embarrassment. He therefore sent £300, and gently\r\nchid her for concealing her need so long. He continued as follows:\r\n“My accession of income has hitherto found so much employment in the\r\ndischarge of former arrears as to leave no very large fund which I can\r\nwith propriety dispose of. This, however, will mend every day, and at\r\nall events I trust you will never scruple to tell me when you have the\r\nslightest occasion for any aid that I can supply.”[398]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Pitt soon fell into difficulties, and partly from his\r\nown generosity as Colonel of the Walmer Volunteers. As we shall also\r\nsee, he gave £2,000 to the Patriotic Fund started in January 1798.\r\nBut carelessness continued to be his chief curse. In truth his lordly\r\nnature and his early training in the household of Chatham unfitted him\r\nfor the practice of that bourgeois virtue, frugality. That he sought to\r\npractise it for the Commonwealth is a signal proof of his patriotism.\r\nWe shall see that his embarrassments probably hindered him from a\r\nmarriage, which might have crowned with joy his somewhat solitary life.\r\n\r\nIn the career of Pitt we find few incidents of the lighter kind, which\r\ndiversify the lives of most statesmen of that age. Two such, however,\r\nconnect him with the jovial society of Dundas. It was their custom\r\nto outline over their cups the course of the forthcoming debates;\r\nand on one occasion, when a motion was to be brought forward by Mr.\r\n(afterwards Earl) Grey, Dundas amused the company by making a burlesque\r\noration on the Whig side. Pitt was so charmed by the performance that\r\nhe declared that Dundas must make the official reply. The joke sounded\r\nwell over wine; but great was the Scotsman’s astonishment to find\r\nhimself saddled with the task in the House. Members were equally taken\r\naback; and the lobbies soon rustled with eager conjectures as to the\r\nreason why Pitt had surrendered his dearly cherished prerogative. It\r\nthen transpired that the Prime Minister had acted partly on a whim, and\r\npartly on the conviction that a speaker who had so cleverly pleaded a\r\ncase must be able to answer it with equal effect.[399]\r\n\r\nThe other incident is likewise Bacchic, and is also uncertain as to\r\ndate. Pitt, Dundas, and Thurlow had been dining with Jenkinson at\r\nCroydon; and during their rollicking career back towards Wimbledon,\r\nthey found a toll-bar gate between Streatham and Tooting carelessly\r\nleft open. Wine, darkness, and the frolicsome spirit of youth prompted\r\nthem to ride through and cheat the keeper. He ran out, called to them\r\nin vain, and, taking them for highwaymen, fired his blunderbuss at\r\ntheir retreating forms.[400] The discharge was of course as harmless\r\nas that of firearms usually was except at point-blank range; but the\r\nwriters of the “Rolliad” got wind of the affair, and satirised Pitt’s\r\nlawlessness in the following lines:\r\n\r\n  Ah, think what danger on debauch attends!\r\n  Let Pitt o’er wine preach temperance to his friends,\r\n  How, as he wandered darkling o’er the plain,\r\n  His reason drowned in Jenkinson’s champagne,\r\n  A rustic’s hand, but righteous fate withstood,\r\n  Had shed a premier’s for a robber’s blood.\r\n\r\nGaiety and grief often tread close on one another’s heels; and Pitt\r\nhad his full share of the latter. The sudden death of his sister\r\nHarriet, on 25th September 1786, was a severe blow. She had married his\r\nCambridge friend, Eliot, and expired shortly after childbirth. She was\r\nhis favourite sister, having entered closely and fondly into his early\r\nlife. He was prostrated with grief, and for some time could not attend\r\neven to the public business which was his second nature. Eliot, now\r\ndestined to be more than ever a friend and brother, came to his house\r\nand for some time lived with him. It will be of interest to print here\r\na new letter of George III to a Mr. Frazer who had informed him of the\r\nsad event.\r\n\r\n                                WINDSOR,\r\n                                    _Sept. 25, 1786._ 9.15 p.m.[401]\r\n\r\n    I am excessively hurt, as indeed all my family are, at the death\r\n    of the amiable Lady Harriot Elliot (_sic_); but I do not the less\r\n    approve Mr. Frazer’s attention in acquainting me of this very\r\n    melancholy event. I owne I dread the effect it may have on Mr.\r\n    Pitt’s health: I think it best not at this early period to trouble\r\n    him with my very sincere condolence; but I know I can trust to the\r\n    prudence of Mr. Frazer, and therefore desire he will take the most\r\n    proper method of letting Mr. Pitt know what I feel for him, and\r\n    that I think it kindest at present to be silent.\r\n\r\n                                                               G. R.\r\n\r\nThe King further evinced his tactful sympathy by suggesting that\r\nPitt should for a time visit his mother at Burton Pynsent. In other\r\nrespects his private life was uneventfully happy. The conclusion of the\r\ncommercial treaty with France, the buoyancy of the national revenue,\r\nand the satisfactory issue of the Dutch troubles must have eased his\r\nanxieties in the years 1786–87; and after the serious crisis last\r\nnamed, his position was truly enviable, until the acute situation\r\narising from the mental malady of George III overclouded his prospects\r\nat the close of the year 1788.\r\n\r\nCertainly Pitt was little troubled by his constituents. Almost the only\r\nproof of his parliamentary connection with the University of Cambridge\r\n(apart from warnings from friends at election times how so and so is to\r\n“be got at”) is in a letter which I have discovered in the Hardwicke\r\nPapers. It refers to a Cambridge Debt Bill about to be introduced by\r\nCharles Yorke in April 1787, to which the University had requested Pitt\r\nto move certain amendments in its interest. It will be seen that Pitt\r\nproposed to treat the request rather lightly:\r\n\r\n    DEAR YORKE,\r\n\r\n    I am rather inclined to wish the Cambridge [Debt] Bill should\r\n    pass without any alteration, unless you think there are material\r\n    reasons for it.--The impanelling the jury does not seem to be\r\n    a point of much consequence, but seems most naturally to be the\r\n    province of the mayor.--With regard to the appeal, I think we\r\n    agreed to strike it out entirely.--As the Commission are a mixed\r\n    body from the town, the county, and the University, there seems to\r\n    be an impropriety in appealing either to the town sessions or the\r\n    County Sessions, either of which may be considered as only one out\r\n    of three parties interested. The decision of the Commission appears\r\n    therefore the most satisfactory, and if I recollect right, it is\r\n    final as the bill now stands.\r\n\r\n                                       Yours most sincerely,\r\n                                                       W. PITT.[402]\r\n\r\nIn the whole of Pitt’s correspondence I have found only one episode\r\nwhich lights up the recesses of his mind. As a rule, his letters are\r\ndisappointingly business-like and formal. He wrote as a Prime Minister\r\nto supporters, rarely as a friend to a friend. And those who search\r\nthe hundreds of packets of the Pitt Papers in order to find the real\r\nman will be tempted to liken him to that elusive creature which, when\r\npursued, shoots away among the rocks under a protective cloud of ink.\r\nAt one point, however, we catch a glimpse of his inmost beliefs.\r\nWilberforce, having come under deep religious convictions in the autumn\r\nof 1785, resolved to retire for a time from all kinds of activity\r\nin order to take his bearings anew. Then he wrote to Pitt a full\r\ndescription of his changed views of life, stating also his conviction\r\nthat he must give up some forms of work and amusement, and that he\r\ncould never be so much of a party man as he had hitherto been. Pitt’s\r\nreply, of 2nd December 1785, has recently seen the light. After stating\r\nthat any essential opposition between them would cause him grief but\r\nmust leave his affection quite untouched, he continued as follows:\r\n\r\n    Forgive me if I cannot help expressing my fear that you are\r\n    nevertheless deluding yourself into principles which have but too\r\n    much tendency to counteract your own object and to render your\r\n    virtues and your talents useless both to yourself and to mankind.\r\n    I am not, however, without hopes that my anxiety paints this too\r\n    strongly. For you confess that the character of religion is not a\r\n    gloomy one, and that it is not that of an enthusiast. But why then\r\n    this preparation of solitude, which can hardly avoid tincturing the\r\n    mind either with melancholy or superstition? If a Christian may act\r\n    in the several relations of life, must he seclude himself from them\r\n    all to become so? Surely the principles as well as the practice of\r\n    Christianity are simple, and lead not to meditation only but to\r\n    action. I will not, however, enlarge upon these subjects now. What\r\n    I ask of you, as a mark both of your friendship and of the candour\r\n    which belongs to your mind, is to open yourself fully and without\r\n    reserve to one, who, believe me, does not know how to separate his\r\n    happiness from your own.[403]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, a Saturday, he called on Wilberforce at Wimbledon, and\r\nthe friends for two hours unburdened their hearts to one another.\r\nWe know little of that moving converse. The two men had ideals so\r\ndifferent that unison was out of the question. The statesman, so we\r\nlearn, had never reflected much on religion, that is, in the keenly\r\nintrospective sense in which Wilberforce now used the word. To Pitt, as\r\nto most Englishmen, religion meant the acceptance of certain doctrines\r\nlaid down by the State Church, and we may describe it as largely\r\npolitical and conventional, buttressing the existing order, but by no\r\nmeans transforming life or character. One glance alone we gain into the\r\nsanctuary of his thoughts; he told Wilberforce that Bishop Butler’s\r\n“Analogy” raised in his mind more doubts than it answered--a proof\r\n(perhaps the only proof that survives) of his cherishing under that\r\ncorrect exterior a critical and questioning spirit.\r\n\r\nTo Wilberforce, thenceforth, all doubts were visitations of the devil.\r\nIndeed, the microscopic watch which he kept on his thoughts and moods\r\nseemed likely to stunt his activities. From this he was perhaps saved\r\nby his friendship with Pitt. True, they could no longer tread the same\r\npath. Pitt obeyed that call to action on behalf of his country which\r\nfrom his boyhood had deadened all other sounds. Wilberforce for a long\r\ntime held aloof from politics as debateable ground beset with snares\r\nto the soul. And yet, though the two men diverged, the promptings of\r\naffection kept them ever within hail. No gulf ever opened out such as\r\nColeridge finely pictured as yawning between two parted friends:\r\n\r\n  They stood aloof, the scars remaining,\r\n  Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;\r\n  A dreary sea now flows between.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Wilberforce found with some surprise that on most questions\r\nthey agreed as before[404]--a proof that there was no desertion of\r\nprinciple on Pitt’s part after the session of 1785. We may go further,\r\nand assert that in their changed relations the two friends exerted upon\r\neach other a mutually beneficent influence. The new convictions of\r\nWilberforce tended to refine the activities of his friend; and Pitt’s\r\npractical good sense helped to launch the philanthropist on that career\r\nof usefulness in which he could both glorify God and uplift myriads of\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nA sharp difference of opinion respecting the war with France\r\noverclouded their lives in the year 1793. Wilberforce fully recognized\r\nthe sincerity of the Cabinet’s efforts to avoid a rupture, and admitted\r\nthat Ministers had not pursued a “war system.” But shortly before\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities, when he was about to speak in favour\r\nof conciliation, Pitt took the strange step of sending Bankes to\r\nhim, earnestly begging him not to speak, as it might do irreparable\r\nmischief, and promising him an opportunity for the statement of his\r\nviews. That opportunity did not come; and Wilberforce evidently\r\nresented this attempt to make political capital out of their\r\nfriendship.[405] The breach between them did not widen until late\r\nin the year 1794, when Wilberforce deemed it his duty to move an\r\namendment in favour of peace. Bankes and Duncombe supported it; but it\r\nwas easily defeated. In the following year the relations between Pitt\r\nand Wilberforce on this question became so strained as to cause both\r\nof them deep distress. Indeed Pitt, who generally enjoyed profound\r\nslumbers, for a time suffered from insomnia. The only other occasions\r\nwhen sleep fled from him were the sudden resignation of Earl Temple\r\nlate in 1783, the mutiny at the Nore, and the arrival of the news of\r\nTrafalgar.\r\n\r\nThe old feelings began to reassert themselves, when Pitt spoke\r\nstrongly in favour of the Abolition of the Slave Trade (26th February\r\n1795); but the friends did not meet for nearly a month, and then with\r\nsome little embarrassment on both sides. All shadows, however, vanished\r\nin a few months’ time, when Wilberforce came to see that his friend\r\nlonged for peace so soon as it was compatible with security. Thereafter\r\ntheir old friendship revived, though tinged with the sadness attending\r\ndisappointed hopes.\r\n\r\nPitt did not so readily forget the independence now and again\r\ndisplayed by Bankes, for instance, in opposing Parliamentary Reform,\r\nthe Westminster Scrutiny, and the continuance of the war. Though they\r\nwere friendly at Cambridge, and afterwards at Goostree’s Club and in\r\nthe House, Pitt never warmed to Bankes, whose nature indeed was too\r\nprecise, cold, and prudent ever to call forth affection. Respected\r\nby all for his sound but stolid speeches, he for forty years sat at\r\nWestminster as member for Corfe Castle. No one seems ever to have\r\nthought of making Bankes either a Minister or a peer. At a later time\r\nthe circle of Pitt’s friends included Canning and Wellesley, who will\r\nreceive notice in later chapters.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Pitt seems to have been somewhat exacting in his\r\nfriendships. One of his early comrades complained that all suggestions\r\nto the Prime Minister must, under pain of his resentment, go forth\r\nto the world as emanations of his wisdom. This is to sacrifice\r\nfriendliness and candour to egotism and parliamentary punctilio. True,\r\nno statesman can afford to neglect prudential considerations; and we\r\nmay freely grant that the cautious calculations of Pitt rarely obsessed\r\nhis whole being, as that of Napoleon was dominated by his egotism.\r\nWe do not find Pitt acting, still less speaking, in the sense which\r\nprompted the remark of Napoleon about an over scrupulous servant: “He\r\nis not devoted to me; he does not want to get on.”\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that there is something wanting about Pitt. He\r\nlacked geniality and glow alike in his treatment of men, and in his\r\nattitude towards the aspirations of the age then dawning. Probably this\r\ndefect sprang from a physical basis. It must be remembered that Chatham\r\nwas nearly all his life a martyr to gout. He bequeathed this weakness\r\nto his second son, a fact which may account for the coldness of Pitt’s\r\nnature. Just as creatures with a torpid circulation love to bask in the\r\nsun, so his chilliness may have prompted the cravings for the Bacchic\r\nsociety of Dundas and Steele. In this respect he suffers by comparison\r\nwith Fox, the full-blooded man, the impetuous foe, the open-handed,\r\nforgiving friend, whose character somewhat resembles that of Antony,\r\ndeified by Cleopatra:\r\n\r\n                      For his bounty,\r\n  There was no winter in ’t; an autumn ’twas\r\n  That grew the more by reaping; his delights\r\n  Were dolphin-like; they showed his back above\r\n  The element they lived in.[406]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nISOLATION\r\n\r\n(1784, 1785)\r\n\r\n    The situation of Europe appears never to have been so critical at\r\n    any epoch since the breaking out of the Thirty Years’ War as it is\r\n    at the present moment.--SIR JAMES HARRIS, _2nd February 1785_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American War of Independence left Great Britain in a critical\r\nsituation both internally and in relation to other Powers. She had\r\nbeen at war with France, Spain, the Dutch Netherlands, and the United\r\nStates, while the Baltic Powers threatened her with hostilities owing\r\nto her insistence on an exacting maritime code. As she refused to come\r\nto a compromise on these questions, the period of peace which followed\r\nafter the Treaty of Versailles (September 1783) did not lead to a\r\nresumption of friendly relations with the States above named. She was\r\nin part hated, in part despised.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent feeling found striking expression in an intercepted\r\nletter of Frederick the Great, which our able ambassador, Sir James\r\nHarris, saw at St. Petersburg. The crabbed monarch therein described\r\nGreat Britain as a land ruined by an unfortunate war, and unable ever\r\nagain to become a formidable rival to France. Here the wish was father\r\nto the thought. “Old sour-mug,” as the Berliners dubbed him, had not\r\nforgiven his desertion by England at the close of the Seven Years’ War,\r\nand never missed an opportunity of affronting George III and damaging\r\nhis interests. It was he who, in the years 1778 and 1779, thwarted\r\nHarris’s plan of effecting an Anglo-Russian alliance, which might have\r\nnullified the efforts of France in the American War; and now, at the\r\nend of that struggle, the resentful old King did his best to perpetuate\r\nthe isolation of the Island Power. In name, he was our ally, the treaty\r\nof 1756 never having been broken; but in reality he was the wiliest of\r\nopponents, his fleeting fits of complaisance being designed to make bad\r\nblood between England and the Emperor Joseph II.[407]\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless rivalry of Austria and Prussia would generally have\r\nenabled Great Britain to count on the support of one of those Powers.\r\nBut while Frederick flouted us from senile spleen, Joseph held aloof\r\nfrom motives of policy. Not only did he hold England cheap, but he saw\r\nin her an obstacle to one of his many schemes. As he was then one of\r\nthe most active of European rulers, we may well begin our survey of\r\nforeign affairs by a short account of him and of his aims.\r\n\r\nJoseph II (1780–1790) held the extensive lands of the House of\r\nHapsburg-Lorraine, ranging from the Milanese to Cracow, and from the\r\nCarpathians to the Breisgau on the Upper Rhine; but these States,\r\nespecially those in Italy and Swabia, lacked the strength that comes\r\nfrom continuity. His position as “Emperor” (that is, elective head of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire) implied little; for the confederate princes of\r\nthat moribund organism had almost complete sovereign powers in the\r\ncomponent States. To breathe new life into “the Empire” was almost\r\nhopeless; but he set himself to solidify and extend his hereditary\r\ndominions by a series of attractively perilous projects. He also\r\nsought to centralize at Vienna the governing powers of his very\r\ndiverse domains, and to carry out reforms, social, agrarian, and\r\nreligious, which aroused widespread opposition. Many of his schemes\r\nwere generous and enlightened, but they stirred the resentment of\r\nlandowners, priests, and Nationalists, especially in Hungary and in his\r\nBelgic Provinces. In order to carry out these programmes, he sought or\r\nmaintained alliances with the most powerful States, namely, Russia and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nHere we are concerned chiefly with his connection with the latter\r\nPower. Despite temporary causes of friction, the Franco-Austrian\r\nalliance of 1756 still subsisted; and it had gained new vitality by\r\nthe marriage of Louis XVI (then Dauphin) with Marie Antoinette, a\r\ndaughter of Maria Theresa and sister of Joseph II, whose efforts on\r\nbehalf of Viennese policy were to effect something for that Court, at\r\nthe expense of her popularity at Paris. Thus, early in the year 1785,\r\nwhen Joseph II revived a scheme, which had been thwarted in 1778,\r\nfor the exchange of his discontented Belgic lands for the Electorate\r\nof Bavaria, all Europe saw in it the hand of Marie Antoinette. The\r\nabsorption of Bavaria would have made the Hapsburgs absolutely supreme\r\nin Central Europe, while the transfer of the Bavarian Electoral House\r\nto Brussels would have broken down the Barrier arrangements which\r\nBritish statecraft had ever sought to build up on the North of France.\r\nThe Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had assigned the then Spanish Netherlands\r\nto the House of Austria in order to set limits to the expansion of\r\nFrance; and the transfer could not be made without the consent of the\r\nsignatory Powers, the chief being England.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, too, Joseph’s Belgian policy ran counter to British\r\ninterests. He had ordered the Dutch troops out of the fortresses (Mons,\r\nNamur, etc.), which, by the Barrier Treaty of 1715, they had the right\r\nto occupy at the expense of those districts; and he further set at\r\nnaught well-established rights of the Dutch, first by furbishing up\r\ncertain musty claims to their frontier stronghold, Maestricht; and\r\nsecondly, by declaring the navigation of the estuary of the Scheldt,\r\nbelow Antwerp, free from Dutch control. In the latter demand he\r\nundoubtedly had “natural law” on his side, while the law of nations\r\nwas as clearly for the Dutch, the Treaty of Münster (1648) having\r\nempowered them to close that estuary to all commerce but their own. As\r\na result the once flourishing trade of Antwerp was wellnigh strangled,\r\nand it was reasonable for Joseph II to seek to end this state of\r\nthings. Nevertheless, his conduct in setting aside that treaty-right\r\nwithout consulting other Powers, was no less indefensible than the\r\nsame action of the French Revolutionists in the autumn of 1792, which\r\nlargely brought about the Great War. In fact, the conduct of Joseph\r\nII towards his own subjects and neighbouring States fitly earned him\r\nthe designation, the “crowned revolutionist”; and, had his power of\r\ncarrying out schemes equalled his facility in weaving them, he might\r\nhave figured in history as a Teutonic Napoleon.\r\n\r\nEqually disturbing and more incisive was the influence of Catharine II\r\nof Russia. It is needless to describe here the strange career of that\r\ndaughter of a poor German prince who ultimately became Czarina. She was\r\njustly suspected of having connived at the murder of her consort Peter\r\nIII; and her relations with her son, the future Paul I, were severely\r\nstrained by her numerous amours. But no indulgences dulled the vision\r\nor the ambition of Catharine. Her freshness of mind and facility of\r\nexpression dazzled her philosophic visitors, Diderot and Grimm; and\r\nthese varied powers were held in leash by a virile will which made\r\nher one of the greatest political forces of the age. Her resolve to\r\naggrandize Russia centred in two great enterprises, the partition of\r\nPoland and the overthrow of the Turkish Power. In the first partition\r\nof Poland (1772) she had the concurrence of Frederick the Great and the\r\nreluctant consent of Maria Theresa; but the death of the latter, in\r\nNovember 1780, removed all checks on Joseph II, who for fifteen years\r\nhad been associated with her in the government of the Austrian States.\r\n\r\nThe two most daring rulers in Europe in the year 1781 came to an\r\nunderstanding which foreboded a general upheaval. Their arrangement\r\ndid not take the form of a treaty, for Joseph, as Emperor, claimed\r\nprecedence in all titles, which Catharine, proud of the comparatively\r\nnew Imperial title of the Czars of Muscovy, refused to recognize.\r\nAccordingly, in May 1781, the punctilious sovereigns exchanged letters,\r\nbinding themselves to mutual support; Joseph undertaking to assist\r\nthe Czarina in her designs against the Turks, while she guaranteed to\r\nJoseph the integrity of his dominions, thus enabling him to adopt the\r\nforward policy whose developments in the Netherlands we have noticed.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Frederick the Great and England seek, though by widely\r\ndiverse means, to dissolve this alliance. Capricious and violent\r\nin private life and in her likes and dislikes, Catharine showed\r\nstatesmanlike firmness and caution in public affairs. Her firmness\r\nappeared in her refusal to take the tempting bait of Minorca which\r\nour ambassador Harris skilfully held out to her in 1780, if she would\r\nmediate in favour of England in the American War. She rightly saw more\r\nprofit in heading the Armed Neutrality League; and Harris used all\r\nhis arts in vain.[408] Her caution shines in her charming repartee to\r\nDiderot after the French philosopher had vivaciously sketched his plan\r\nof renovating Russia. “M. Diderot, you forget in all your plans of\r\nreform the difference in our positions; you only work on paper, which\r\nendures all things; it opposes no obstacle either to your imagination\r\nor to your pen. But I, poor Empress that I am, work on a sensitive and\r\nirritable medium, the human skin.” In these phrases lies the secret\r\nof the success of Catharine and of the ultimate failure of Joseph. He\r\nforgot that the sentient skin is not parchment: she never forgot it.\r\n\r\nFor the present, their alliance promised to make them the arbiters\r\nof Europe, Catharine in the East, and her ally in the centre and the\r\nNetherlands. It was therefore desirable for Great Britain to gain their\r\nalliance, or at least their friendship. But our overtures were repulsed\r\nat both Courts. In vain did Sir Murray Keith, our respected envoy at\r\nVienna, seek to undermine the unnatural alliance between France and\r\nAustria, and suggest a return to the traditional connection between the\r\nCourts of St. James and Vienna; the Francophile policy of the Austrian\r\nChancellor, Kaunitz, was still in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nIn vain also did Alleyne Fitzherbert, now the British Ambassador at\r\nSt. Petersburg, remind Catharine II of the many interests, trading and\r\npolitical, we had in common, and of the help we had given to the infant\r\nnavy of Russia in officers and men, and in granting facilities for\r\nits repair at Portsmouth and Port Mahon.[409] With her, past services\r\nweighed but lightly as against present expediency. The assurances of\r\nthe previous decade as to the natural links between England and Russia\r\nwere ridiculed, probably because her keen eyes discerned, sooner than\r\nthose of any British statesman, the eventual opposition of England to\r\nher scheme of seizing Constantinople. As a prelude to this enterprise\r\nshe annexed the Crimea in the year 1783; and, as we shall see later,\r\nshe thenceforth bent all her energies to the task of enthroning at\r\nConstantinople her grandson, Constantine. The alliance of Austria being\r\nessential, and the union of the Hapsburgs with France being but little\r\nimpaired by Joseph’s Belgic plans (at least up to the end of 1784), she\r\ncourted Paris and slighted London. A proposal which Fitzherbert made at\r\nSt. Petersburg in April 1784, for an alliance with Russia, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark, fell to the ground.[410]\r\n\r\nThus, the trend of European politics in the East, in Germany, and in\r\nthe Netherlands told heavily against England, and increased the natural\r\nreluctance of any Power to seek the friendship of a beaten nation. It\r\nis at such times that the artificiality of the idea of the Balance of\r\nPower is seen. No State took the slightest interest in restoring the\r\nislanders to their rightful position in the world. For this they had to\r\ntrust to themselves and to their young leader.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Pitt and his Foreign Secretary, the Marquis of\r\nCarmarthen, at first desired little more than to be left alone.\r\nPeace is always the greatest of British interests, and it was so\r\npre-eminently at that time, when the interest on the National Debt\r\nabsorbed three-fourths of the nation’s revenue. Foreign Affairs\r\ninterested the Cabinet but little, so we gather from the memoranda of\r\nthe Marquis of Carmarthen (afterwards Duke of Leeds); but he there\r\nstates that Pitt applied himself closely to the correspondence with\r\nambassadors, and that, in a conversation which they had together at\r\nWimbledon in May 1784, he found that they agreed as to the desirability\r\nof severing the connection of Austria with France, and of forming some\r\nalliance which would counterbalance the power of the French and Spanish\r\nHouses of Bourbon; but at the same time Pitt was strongly convinced\r\nof the need of avoiding any engagements which might lead to war.[411]\r\nThat George III had lost his bellicose temper appears from the closing\r\nsentence of his letter of 6th July 1784 to Carmarthen: “Till I see this\r\ncountry in a situation more respectable as to Army, Navy, and Finances,\r\nI cannot think anything that may draw us into troubled waters either\r\nsafe or rational.”[412]\r\n\r\nThis sensible pronouncement was called forth by the proposal of Pitt\r\nand Carmarthen to make another overture to the Empress Catharine.\r\nAn opportunity occurred owing to a recent compact between France\r\nand Sweden, according to the former a naval depôt and other special\r\nprivileges at the port of Gothenburg. As this might enable French\r\nwarships to control the mouth of the Baltic, it threatened the\r\ninterests of England, Denmark, and Russia; and the British Cabinet,\r\nalways intent on regaining the favour of the Czarina, began to sound\r\nthe situation at St. Petersburg and Copenhagen. Carmarthen sought the\r\nadvice of Sir James Harris, and received the following witty reply:\r\n\r\n                                       Cuffnalls, Oct. 6, 1784.[413]\r\n\r\n    Should the Northern Lights be really enlightened, and a spark of\r\n    common sense be added to Kitty’s bright understanding I hope my\r\n    friend Fitz[herbert] will accomplish the point we have all failed\r\n    in. I cannot but suppose that the Ch[ancellor] and Lord C. will\r\n    defer to your opinion, and that your next messenger will carry\r\n    positive and particular instructions both to Hamlet and Semiramis.\r\n\r\n“Semiramis” (Catharine) proved to be no less obdurate to Fitzherbert\r\nthan to Harris, though the instructions issued to the former had\r\nbeen drawn up in a masterly manner by Pitt himself. It is clear that\r\nthe young statesman took a keen interest in the overture to Russia;\r\nfor when Carmarthen sent him a draft of his “Instructions for Mr.\r\nFitzherbert,” he sent the hitherto unpublished replies, which throw an\r\ninteresting light on his relations to that Minister, and his views on\r\nforeign policy:\r\n\r\n                 BRIGHTHELMSTONE, Wed^y night. _Oct. 13, 1784_.[414]\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n    I return you with many thanks the draft of the Instructions to Mr.\r\n    Fitzherbert. I trouble you at the same time, as you permitted me,\r\n    with the sketch of the Ideas which had occurred to me on the same\r\n    subject. I have the satisfaction to perceive, as I flattered myself\r\n    must be the case, that our Ideas do not seem to differ in any\r\n    respect. I hardly need give you the trouble of reading my scrawl.\r\n    I leave it however to your consideration, tho’ hardly thinking\r\n    anything in it will repay the time of perusing it. You will, I am\r\n    sure, excuse a proof at least of my solicitude on a subject on\r\n    which we feel equally interested.\r\n\r\nThat Carmarthen set a high value on the “scrawl,” appears from the fact\r\nthat it bears the pencil-mark, “sent to Russia the 15th.” As it was\r\nprobably the first diplomatic note ever penned by Pitt, it deserves to\r\nbe quoted in full, especially as it proves that he was no advocate of\r\nisolation. He saw too well the dangers of it. Further, those who take\r\npleasure in contrasting his orderly and forcible statement of ideas\r\nwith a loose and feeble statement may consult the draft of Carmarthen,\r\nwhich that Minister had the good sense to replace by Pitt’s:[415]\r\n\r\n    It is His Majesty’s earnest desire to regulate his conduct on the\r\n    occasion of the late Treaty between France and Sweden, in the\r\n    strictest concert with the Court of Petersburg. And therefore,\r\n    altho’ it would have been a great satisfaction to have known first\r\n    what line appeared to the Empress most proper to be pursued, we\r\n    have no difficulty in stating without reserve what the situation\r\n    appears to us to call for. We wish at the same time to know whether\r\n    any other specifick measures have been thought of by the Empress,\r\n    and we are ready in every respect to enter into the fullest and\r\n    most confidential communication.\r\n\r\n    We are not aware of any treaty or of any other ground, which gives\r\n    a direct and absolute right to object to any arrangement which the\r\n    King of Sweden may have thought proper to make in this instance\r\n    with regard to a Port of his own dominions; altho’ the possibility\r\n    of its being carried to the extent which there is reason to suspect\r\n    is ultimately intended cannot but occasion great jealousy, and\r\n    altho’ even in a commercial light, it may possibly not be a matter\r\n    of indifference. The difficulty of making a direct opposition in\r\n    the first instance seems, by Mr. Fitzherbert’s report, to have\r\n    struck the Ministers of the Empress in the same manner. On this\r\n    supposition, the only immediate step which it appears natural to\r\n    take is to desire from the Court of Stockholm an explanation to\r\n    what extent the privileges granted to the French are _bonâ fide_\r\n    intended to be carried. A representation to this purpose should,\r\n    we think, be made jointly in the names of the Courts of London,\r\n    Petersburg, and Copenhagen, if the latter Court should be disposed\r\n    (as we trust will be the case) to co-operate on this occasion.\r\n    This may produce such an explanation from Sweden as may furnish\r\n    a strong additional ground for interference hereafter to prevent\r\n    the dangerous designs of France, if she should be inclined to\r\n    avail herself of the privileges she has now acquired to carry\r\n    them into execution. If the answer should not be explicit and\r\n    satisfactory, further measures should be concerted to guard against\r\n    the effects to be apprehended. Indeed, whatever colour may be given\r\n    to the transaction, it would not seem wise to trust implicitly\r\n    to assurances and explanations. In every light, therefore, the\r\n    only substantial security would be in an establishment of that\r\n    permanent and solid connection between this country and Russia\r\n    and Denmark, which their common interests render on all accounts\r\n    most desireable. Without such a system, [the] consequences of this\r\n    attempt cannot be effectually obviated, direct opposition to it\r\n    seeming hardly practicable; and desultory and unconnected efforts\r\n    which terminate in one single and separate point (even if the\r\n    occasion admitted of their being exerted to the utmost) promising\r\n    comparatively but little effect. Explanations and assurances,\r\n    however explicit, unless such measures are taken to enforce an\r\n    adherence to them, will be but a feeble and precarious barrier\r\n    against the encroaching spirit which has dictated this project.\r\n    Even if this particular measure should be defeated, the same spirit\r\n    (unless effectual and systematic steps are taken to counteract it)\r\n    will show itself in other shapes and on innumerable occasions.\r\n    This object therefore of an alliance between the three Courts\r\n    seems to be the only measure, under the present circumstances,\r\n    which promises effectual support to their common interests and\r\n    to the general tranquillity of Europe. And there seems no reason\r\n    to imagine that there can be any obstacle in the way of its\r\n    completion, which a cordial and mutual inclination, and a free and\r\n    open discussion will not easily remove.\r\n\r\nAll was in vain. There was more method in Catharine II’s waywardness\r\nthan Harris understood. Her aim being the preparation of a great fleet\r\nat Sevastopol with a view to the conquest of Turkey, she needed, as we\r\nhave seen, the co-operation of Austria; but that implied friendship\r\nwith France, and therefore coolness to England.[416] These motives\r\nlong continued to govern the policy of the Empress, and prevented the\r\nformation of any good understanding with her.\r\n\r\nAs for the Emperor, Joseph II, there was small hope of an alliance\r\nwith him. The emergence, early in 1785, of his pet scheme of a\r\nBelgic-Bavarian exchange was a palpable threat to the old Germanic\r\nSystem, of which George III, as Elector of Hanover, was a pillar;\r\nand he knew right well that the Court of St. James would steadfastly\r\noppose the weakening of the Barrier in Flanders which must ensue from\r\nso violent a change. Sir James Harris summed up the opinion of our\r\nstatesmen when he said that that Barrier against the encroachments of\r\nFrance had “ever been deemed essential to the interests of Europe in\r\ngeneral and to those of England in particular; but it is destroyed\r\nthe moment the Low Countries either belong to France directly, or are\r\ngoverned by a sovereign devoted to her influence.”[417]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe here touch upon a question which, after being the fruitful cause\r\nof wars from the time of the Plantagenets, was soon to involve Great\r\nBritain in the struggle with Revolutionary France, and yet again with\r\nNapoleon. The effort to prevent France acquiring complete control over\r\nthe Netherlands was to be the chief work of William Pitt--a career far\r\nother than that which he had marked out for himself, and into which,\r\nas we shall see, he was drawn most reluctantly. The struggle presents\r\nthree well-marked phases: the first concerns chiefly the disputes\r\nbetween the Stadholder of the United Provinces and the Patriots,\r\nabetted by France, which finally resulted in a complete triumph for the\r\nformer, thanks to the action of Prussia and England and the formation\r\nof the Triple Alliance of 1788. In the second period Revolutionary\r\nFrance, with the help of the Patriots, overran those provinces, and set\r\nup the Batavian or Dutch Republic. The uneasy Peace of Amiens ended\r\nin 1803, largely because Bonaparte insisted on treating that Republic\r\nas a dependency of France; and Pitt’s life closed in the midst of the\r\nworld-strife that ensued. But the Treaties of Vienna carried out (what\r\nNapoleon never would have agreed to[418]) the erection of a seemingly\r\nsolid Barrier against France, the Kingdom of the United Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThese mighty convulsions arose very largely from a contention as to\r\nthe fate of the Netherlands. The importance of States depends not so\r\nmuch on their size as on their situation; and the Dutch and Belgic\r\nNetherlands, forming the fringes of the French and Teutonic peoples,\r\nderive great importance from that circumstance, or perhaps even more\r\nfrom their occupying the coast-line beside the mouths of the Rhine,\r\nMeuse, and Scheldt, which contains fine harbours and is peopled\r\nby an enterprising and industrious folk. The conduct of a British\r\nGovernment with respect to those lands is, so to speak, a barometric\r\ntest of its skill and energy. None but the weakest and most craven of\r\nAdministrations has ever allowed a great hostile Power to dominate the\r\nmouths of those rivers. It was no idle boast of Napoleon that at his\r\ngreat naval port of Antwerp he held a pistol at the head of England.\r\nDoubly true would that vaunt be of a Great Power which held Rotterdam\r\nand Amsterdam. In a description of the struggle with France in 1785–7\r\nfor supremacy in the Dutch Netherlands, we are concerned with the\r\nprelude of what was to be a mighty trilogy of war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fatuity of Lord North’s Administration was nowhere more glaringly\r\nshown than in the high-handed proceedings at sea which embroiled us\r\nwith the United Provinces, but it should be remembered that three\r\nprovinces out of the seven strongly objected to go to war. Accordingly,\r\nthat ill-knit confederacy conducted the war without vigour; and, after\r\nDutch commerce had suffered severely, it concluded peace with Great\r\nBritain in 1783, ceding the station of Negapatam in India. Resentment\r\nagainst England was blended with indignation against the Anglophile\r\nStadholder, William V, who was accused of having paralysed the efforts\r\nof his country. He was even reported by the Patriots or democrats to\r\nhave expressed the hope, after the Dutch success at the Dogger Bank,\r\nthat the English fleet had not suffered much. These and other silly\r\ntales acquired some credibility from the fact that he was the son of\r\nthe Princess Anne, daughter of George II, who had imbued him with a\r\nlove of her country. As his guardian and instructor in statecraft was\r\nDuke Lewis of Brunswick, whose intermeddling finally hastened his\r\ndeparture from the country, the popular movement for the lessening of\r\nthe Stadholder’s powers acquired strength from the hatred of foreigners\r\nand foreign ways always so strong in that home-loving folk. These,\r\nthen, were the circumstances which brought the disputes between the\r\nPatriots and the Orange party to a crisis in the years 1785–7, and\r\nthreatened to plunge Europe into a great war. The immediate causes were\r\npetty and local. The possible results were of world-wide importance.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the hereditary Stadholder had undergone several\r\nchanges according to the exigencies of the times. In the long struggle\r\nwith Spain, as later with Louis XIV, the Dutch had wisely entrusted to\r\nthe Princes of Orange the chief executive powers, only to go back to\r\nstrictly republican and federal customs when the crisis was past. The\r\nsame expedient held good during the invasion of the Maréchal de Saxe\r\nin 1746–7, and with a similar sequel. Thus, to the House of Orange\r\nthe Dutch looked for a Cincinnatus in times of stress, but expected\r\nhim afterwards to go back to his tulips. The advantage of such an\r\narrangement is obvious, provided that the populace is fully agreed as\r\nto the time of summoning Cincinnatus and the time of dismissal; also\r\nthat that illustrious House could ever furnish a supply of men doughty\r\nin war and submissive in peace.\r\n\r\nBut here lay the difficulty: that the Princes and their supporters\r\nobjected to arrangements which implied phenomenal powers of activity\r\nand hibernation. A demand arose that the Republic should so far\r\ncentralize its governing powers as to be ready against emergencies;\r\nand in 1747 the United Provinces adopted a constitution whereby the\r\nStadholderate became a perpetual office, hereditary in the House of\r\nOrange. It was confirmed by all the provinces in 1766; and until\r\nrecently no one had disputed the right of the Prince to command the\r\narmed forces, both military and naval, and to exercise a large amount\r\nof control over the executive functions of the provinces. He shared\r\nthese last with the States General, representing all the provinces, and\r\nwith the States of the several provinces. Nevertheless, these bodies,\r\ntogether with their Grand Pensionaries, Greffiers, and the Regents (or\r\nchief magistrates) of towns, looked jealously on his prerogatives and\r\nsharply resented any change tending to unify and centralize the forces\r\nof the nation.[419]\r\n\r\nIn truth, the task of holding together the United Provinces was\r\nlike that of grasping oiled billiard balls. They were, in effect,\r\nindependent States, having power to decide on peace and war, make\r\ntreaties and raise loans. Differing in their constitutions, they also\r\nstood in different relations to the Stadholderate. The duties of the\r\nStates General were to uphold the Union framed at Utrecht in 1579, and,\r\nas far as possible, to supervise foreign policy and national defence,\r\nthe executive side of these functions falling to the Stadholder and\r\na Council of State. But ratification by the States of the several\r\nprovinces, or at least by a majority of them, was needful to give\r\nvalidity to all such decisions and actions. When we further learn\r\nthat the Regencies of the chief towns had the right of ratifying the\r\ndecisions of the States of their provinces, we can understand the\r\nmagnitude of the task which confronted the Stadholders and Marlborough\r\nin defending those clannish communities.\r\n\r\nThe alleged treachery of the Stadholder during the late war with\r\nEngland, together with resentment at his centralizing efforts, had\r\nnow roused these local instincts to a state of fury, which William\r\nV seemed unable either to quell or to calm. In truth, that hapless\r\nruler was irresolution personified. His _rôle_ was always one of\r\npassivity. Rarely did he show a spark of spirit or turn the tables\r\non his opponents, though he might easily have thrown on them the\r\nresponsibility for the misfortunes of the war, of which they, not he,\r\nwere the cause.[420] Compared with him, that other political nullity,\r\nLouis XVI, seemed a man of firmness and energy. Strange to say, the\r\nlottery of marriage had given to each of them an active and capable\r\nconsort. In her smaller sphere, Wilhelmina, Princess of Orange, played\r\na part not unlike that of Marie Antoinette. She was niece of Frederick\r\nthe Great and shared in the strong qualities that are rarely eclipsed\r\nin the House of Hohenzollern; but for the present she was doomed idly\r\nto chafe at the humiliating restrictions of her lot. The lynx eyes\r\nof Sir James Harris soon detected her real feelings for her husband,\r\nwhich, though curbed by wifely duty, now and again broke forth. In\r\nthe as yet unpublished letters of Harris to the Marquis of Carmarthen\r\nare sharp comments on the dullness and torpor of the Prince. These\r\npiquant words describe the relations of that ill-matched pair: “He is\r\nso jealous of her sense and power that he would not even go to Paradise\r\nby her influence; and she has so mean an opinion of his capacity, and,\r\nin general, that kind of contempt a high-spirited woman feels for an\r\ninferior male being, that I see no hopes of bringing them to that\r\ndegree of cohesion so highly necessary for the completion of my future\r\nplans.”[421]\r\n\r\nThe man who wrote these words had already seen much of men and\r\naffairs. Born at Salisbury in 1746, Harris was educated at Oxford,\r\nwhere his acquaintance with Fox instilled into him Whig principles.\r\nAfter completing his studies at Leyden, he entered the diplomatic\r\nservice, served with distinction at Madrid and Berlin, and acted as\r\nambassador at Petersburg in the years 1777–82, spending there, so it\r\nis said, £20,000 of his private fortune, in his country’s service.\r\nReturning to England, he entered Parliament as member for Christchurch,\r\nand warmly supported Fox. His handsome presence and lively conversation\r\nwon him high favour at Carlton House, and afterwards, probably at the\r\nsuggestion of Pitt, he gave good advice to the Prince of Wales. A\r\nleader in society, as in the diplomatic world, the brilliant Harris\r\nwas courted on all sides; but popularity did not dull his love for\r\nhis wife; and the strong expressions of friendship which occur in the\r\ncorrespondence between him and Carmarthen show that these versatile and\r\nwitty men (the latter wrote a comedy which earned the praise of Warton)\r\nhad a deep fund of staunchness and fidelity. Their affection had some\r\npolitical results. The first article in the political creed of Sir\r\nJames Harris was hatred of France; and the intervention of Pitt in the\r\naffairs of the Foreign Office may be ascribed to his perception of the\r\nGallophobe bias which the vehement and persuasive Harris imparted to\r\nthe policy of Carmarthen.\r\n\r\nSuch was the envoy who at the close of the year 1784 proceeded to The\r\nHague, to uphold the cause of the Stadholder and England against the\r\nPatriots and France. The outlook seemed of the gloomiest. “There is\r\nnot, I fear” (so he wrote on 7th December), “the most distant prospect\r\nof reclaiming this country.” And again, on 11th March 1785: “We have\r\nnothing to expect from this country. Passive, tame, and void of every\r\npublic virtue, they [the Orange party] will submit to everything.\r\nThe Prince now talks of going away, of selling his demesnes in these\r\nprovinces and retiring to Germany--a resolution which, if ever he\r\ncarries it into execution, will compleat his character.”[422] As for\r\nthe refusal of Frederick the Great to help his niece Wilhelmina, it cut\r\nthe chivalrous Harris to the quick. His private letters to Carmarthen\r\nbreathe hatred against France, but contempt of Prussia. When Frederick\r\ncoolly advised her to disarm the Patriots by coming to terms with\r\nFrance, the impetuous Harris burst forth: “The knot must be cut,\r\nnot untied, and the King of Prussia’s half measures rejected.”[423]\r\nAdmiration for that unfortunate princess added vehemence to his\r\nlanguage. He found her far more frank and genuine than Catharine of\r\nRussia, needing very little of the flattery which he vainly lavished\r\non “Semiramis.” He succeeded in persuading the Princess to trust\r\nEngland rather than Prussia; and it is clear that he worked for a\r\ncompact between Great Britain, Austria, and the Netherlands, with the\r\ninclusion of Russia and Denmark if possible. But at times, in hearing\r\nof the indignities that she daily had to bear at The Hague, he forgot\r\nmere questions of policy. “Now and then” (he wrote on 9th September\r\n1785) “my thoughts get worldly, and I think of flesh and blood when\r\nI see a pair of fine eyes with the tears starting from them, but I\r\nsoon suppress this idea.”[424] Perhaps it was well that the Prince and\r\nPrincess left The Hague and went to reside at Nymeguen, in faithful\r\nGuelderland, near the Prussian Duchy of Cleves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Pitt looked away from the turmoil at Westminster (it was the year\r\nof the Reform Bill and the Irish Propositions) he might well feel\r\ndismay at the almost indescribable welter on the Continent. On all\r\nsides the old order was breaking up. Two mighty Empires took the\r\nlead in disruptive schemes which menaced the smaller States with\r\nruin. Intellectual keenness and military force helped on the coming\r\ncataclysm. Catharine and Joseph were by far the ablest rulers of their\r\nage. Frederick, a prey to moroseness, was content to wait for favours\r\nfrom Versailles which were never forthcoming. France as yet showed few\r\nsigns of that weakness which was soon to overtake her. True, Louis XVI\r\nwas a nonentity; but in Marie Antoinette the Austro-French alliance had\r\nits corner stone. Moreover, the French Foreign Minister, Vergennes,\r\nwas a man of outstanding talents. His hostility to England had been\r\nnotorious; and even now he was reviving the French East India Company,\r\nand was pressing the Sultan for trading facilities in Egypt and the\r\nRed Sea, which threatened our ascendancy in India.[425] To complete\r\nthis brief survey, we may note that England had disputes with Spain\r\nconcerning the rights of British merchants on the Mosquito Coast of\r\nCentral America;[426] and the ill humour of the Court of Madrid lent\r\nsome credit to persistent rumours of the formation of a Quadruple\r\nAlliance between Russia, Austria, France, and Spain, for the overthrow\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nHaving gained some knowledge of the chief players in the great game\r\nthat was now opening, and of the vast issues at stake, we return to\r\nnotice its varying fortunes, especially as they concerned Pitt. It\r\nshould be remembered that, while the Marquis of Carmarthen wrote the\r\ndespatches, the spirit which informed them was that of the Prime\r\nMinister. Carmarthen had ability, but it trickled off towards lampoons\r\nand plays. In _la haute politique_ he never had very deep interest;\r\nbut it is clear that Pitt soon found in it the fascination which has\r\nenthralled many a master mind.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, Joseph II early in 1785 led the way in two\r\nvery threatening moves, namely, the proposal for the Belgic-Bavarian\r\nExchange and the demand that the Dutch should cede to him Maestricht\r\nand throw open the navigation of the Scheldt estuary below Antwerp. It\r\nwas characteristic of him that he should press both these disturbing\r\nclaims in the same year, a fact which reveals his confidence in his\r\nalliances with Russia and France, and his contempt for the isolated\r\nPowers, Prussia, Holland, and Great Britain. In these two matters\r\nhe used his allies as passive tools for the furtherance of his own\r\nends; and this explains the concluding sentences of Harris’s letter\r\nto Carmarthen quoted in part above: “The Emperor dupes Russia: France\r\nmakes a fool of Prussia. In two words this seems to be the state of\r\nEurope. I wish England could take advantage of this singular position\r\nof affairs.”[427]\r\n\r\nPitt and his colleagues were by no means so absorbed in managing the\r\nHouse of Commons as Harris hinted in his letter of four days later\r\nto Joseph Ewart at Berlin. The despatches of this able official,\r\nSecretary of the British Legation at the Prussian capital, had already\r\nwarned them of their danger, and pointed to an alliance with Prussia\r\nas the only way of escape. The once Prussophobe Harris admitted to\r\nEwart the force of these arguments;[428] and, as Hertzberg, one of the\r\nPrussian Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, favoured an English\r\nconnection, there was some hope that the long feud between Frederick\r\nthe Great and George III would die a natural death. During a visit\r\nto London in May, Harris drew up convincing arguments in favour of a\r\nPrussian alliance, and the King suggested that he should go to Berlin\r\nto arrange matters.[429]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the martinet of Sans Souci was as unbending as ever.\r\nHe would not hear of entering into a general alliance with England,\r\neither because he still hankered after a union with France,[430]\r\nor feared that an _entente_ with the islanders would drive France\r\ninto close union with Russia and Austria. His resolve was the more\r\nremarkable because the Duke of York had been at Berlin to arrange the\r\naccession of Hanover to the League of German Princes which Frederick\r\nwas then forming as a counterstroke to Joseph’s assault on the\r\nGermanic System.[431] That the Prussian monarch should have neglected\r\nto strengthen that inherently weak union by the support of England,\r\nis one of the puzzles of his reign. Had he done so, the League would\r\nhave taken a long stride forward towards the unification of Germany.\r\nFrederick chose otherwise. He welcomed Hanover and repulsed Great\r\nBritain. The League therefore lacked the support that it might have\r\nhad. England and Prussia went their own ways, and therefore yielded to\r\nFrance the first place in the affairs of Western Europe, particularly\r\nin Holland. Moreover the Imperial Courts hotly resented the inclusion\r\nof Hanover in the League, as will presently appear.\r\n\r\nGeorge III very rarely, if ever, consulted Pitt concerning Hanoverian\r\naffairs, the control of which he shared solely with the Regency at\r\nHanover.[432] But the accession of the Electorate to the _Fürstenbund_,\r\nwhich took definite shape in August 1785, was not the purely Germanic\r\naffair which George III strove to represent it. The incident gave deep\r\numbrage to Joseph and Catharine; and their anger fell scarcely less\r\non Frederick than on the Elector of Hanover. Vorontzoff, the Russian\r\nambassador at London, on 5th August handed in a sharp protest, which\r\nPitt at once forwarded to Windsor. It hinted that if George III did not\r\nannul his treaty with Prussia and Saxony, Russia would form alliances\r\ndisagreeable to England. As appears in the King’s reply to Pitt,\r\nGeorge scorned the threat, which proved to be harmless.\r\n\r\nThe natural outcome of this should have been an Anglo-Prussian\r\n_entente_. As Frederick and George had given deep offence to the\r\nImperial Courts, it would have been reasonable for them to bury the\r\nhatchet and come to a secret compact for mutual defence. Hanover, which\r\nhad so long been the cause of alienation, should now have brought them\r\nto a close union. For this consummation Ewart had long been working. He\r\nit was who first caught a glimpse of the brilliant prospects which an\r\nAnglo-Prussian alliance would open up; and with his perfervid Scottish\r\nnature (he was born at a manse near Kirkcudbright in 1759, the year\r\nof Pitt’s birth) he set himself to win the confidence of the Prussian\r\nMinister, Count Hertzberg, and the respect of his chiefs at London.\r\nPossessing lively manners, a frank and pleasing address, natural\r\nshrewdness, perseverance, and zeal tempered with tact, he gradually\r\nwon the confidence of Hertzberg, and saw him at least once, and often\r\ntwice, every day. Thus he paved the way for a second proposal of a\r\ngeneral alliance between England and Prussia. “_M. Ewart me tourmente\r\nbeaucoup du plan_,” wrote Hertzberg on 5th July to the Princess of\r\nOrange.[433] For the present he toiled in vain; but it is clear that\r\nthe first conception of the Triple Alliance of England, Prussia, and\r\nHolland, originated neither with Pitt nor Carmarthen, nor Harris,\r\nnor Hertzberg, but with Ewart. His chief at Berlin, Lord Dalrymple,\r\nwas in the main a figure-head of the British Embassy, and did not\r\nfavour an Anglo-Prussian compact. But Ewart plodded on at the basis\r\nof the fabric, which Pitt and Harris were destined to complete. The\r\nservices of this lonely and pertinacious Scot have not received due\r\nrecognition.[434]\r\n\r\nThe threats of the Czarina, however much they might be spurned at\r\nWindsor and Whitehall, furnished another reason why Pitt and Carmarthen\r\nshould seek to come to some understanding with Prussia; but, having\r\nfailed in the month of May, they were now warily on their guard.\r\nThe feeling prevalent in diplomatic circles is piquantly expressed\r\nin Harris’s letter of 23rd August to Carmarthen: “As for the King\r\nof Prussia if he is sincere, he will die; if not, he will of course\r\ndeceive us; in both cases he should be used only as a tool, and, by\r\nbeing forced to speak out himself, compel others [_i.e._ Austria and\r\nRussia] to declare themselves.”[435]\r\n\r\nThis passage probably explains why the Pitt Ministry, in sending\r\nEarl Cornwallis on an informal mission to Berlin, tied his hands by\r\ninstructions of a stringent kind. Carmarthen on 2nd September cautioned\r\nthe Earl not to commit this country in the slightest degree; and to\r\nhear much, but speak little to that “artful” monarch.\r\n\r\nWhen such suspicions beset the interview, no good could result. On his\r\nside Frederick appears never to have taken the proposal seriously. He\r\nassured Cornwallis of his friendship for England, but remarked on the\r\nthreatening state of things in Europe; France, Spain, Austria, and\r\nRussia were in alliance (which was false); Holland was in the power\r\nof France; Prussia and England were isolated, and, if united, were no\r\nmatch for the vast display of power opposed to them. The union between\r\nFrance and Austria was indissoluble (a very questionable statement in\r\nview of their opposing interests in the Netherlands); but it might be\r\npossible to arouse the jealousy of Catharine against Austria over the\r\nsuggested partition of Turkey. As for France, she was seeking to make\r\ntrouble for England everywhere, especially in India and Ireland. But\r\nhe ended his jeremiad with praises of Pitt for his care of British\r\nfinances. This tirade was evidently intended to discourage Pitt and\r\nto bring him as a suppliant for the alliance of Prussia. For if the\r\nQuadruple Alliance were a fact, what was to be gained by the two States\r\nremaining in isolation, especially as each of them had annoyed its\r\nneighbours? Frederick’s real opinion appeared in the sharp rebuke which\r\nhe sent to Count Lusi, his envoy at London, for venturing to suggest\r\nthe desirability of an interview.[436]\r\n\r\nThe incident left the Pitt Ministry in worse straits than ever by\r\nrevealing to all the world the friendless state of England. A note of\r\nanxiety may be detected in the letter which Pitt wrote to Harris on\r\n13th October 1785. After referring to the growing prosperity of the\r\ncountry, as enhancing its prestige, he added that he would say nothing\r\nabout Dutch or continental politics--“for they seem in truth still\r\ntoo mysterious to form any conjectures on the turn either of them may\r\nultimately take.”[437] The words deserve notice; for they refute the\r\nnotion that Pitt had formed any definite system.[438] His only plan at\r\nthis time was to wait until the horizon cleared. Much may be said for\r\nthis cautious opportunism; but it had the disadvantage of leaving us\r\nisolated at a time of great danger. We had done enough to incur the\r\ndispleasure of two most dangerous sovereigns, Catharine and Joseph, but\r\nnot enough to avert its probable consequences.\r\n\r\nFor the present, Ministers sought to recover the good will of\r\nCatharine. In semblance it was easily procurable. Vorontzoff for a\r\ntime dangled before Carmarthen the prize of a Russian alliance, and\r\nsought to persuade him that the Empress was on the point of proposing\r\nit when she heard of Hanover joining the German League. The Austrian\r\nenvoy, Kazeneck, also assured him that friendship with Russia would\r\nbe the best means of preventing war with France. Carmarthen seems to\r\nhave taken these offers at their face value and wrote to Harris that\r\nthe road from London to Paris lay through Petersburg.[439] Similar\r\nproposals came from these envoys for some time; and Carmarthen cheered\r\nhimself with a truly pathetic belief in their honesty.[440] Harris\r\nalso, despite his knowledge of Catharine’s anti-British bias, persisted\r\nin hoping for a return of her favour. He even drew up a memorandum\r\nrecounting the advantages of an Anglo-Russo-Austrian League, for which\r\nCarmarthen was already angling; and in particular he deprecated any\r\noffer of alliance to Frederick, “unless compelled by events.”[441] It\r\nis strange that Pitt and Carmarthen did not see that the advances of\r\nthe Imperial Courts were designed merely to keep England and Prussia\r\napart. But, in truth, the fault lay mainly with Frederick the Great,\r\nwhose spleen was incurable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the course of events in the Netherlands should have brought\r\nPrussia and England to terms. They need not have been public, still\r\nless offensive in aim; for that would have brought about a close\r\nunion of France with Russia as well as Austria, an event which Pitt\r\nno less than Frederick sought to avert. But why Pitt and Carmarthen\r\nshould not have welcomed a secret defensive compact with Prussia it\r\nis hard to say. If the princes and counts of Germany did not hesitate\r\nto brave the wrath of Joseph by union with Prussia, why should Great\r\nBritain? Frederick’s shiftiness may be granted. But at this crisis\r\nthere was a motive which might be trusted to keep him staunch, namely,\r\nself-interest. Both England and Prussia sorely needed an ally; yet they\r\nheld severely aloof.\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn of 1785, Joseph II brought severe pressure to\r\nbear upon the Dutch to cede Maestricht to him, and to throw open the\r\nnavigation of the Scheldt below Antwerp. Hostilities were on the\r\npoint of breaking out, when France skilfully intervened, offered\r\nher mediation, and prevailed on the disputants to accept the terms\r\nwhich she offered. By the Treaty of Fontainebleau (8 Nov. 1785) the\r\nEmperor agreed to waive his exorbitant claims in consideration of the\r\npayment of 15,000,000 florins, for the half of which sum the Court\r\nof Versailles became responsible. That so heavily burdened a State\r\nshould add to its financial difficulties excited some surprise; but in\r\nthe political sphere Vergennes gained a signal triumph. By becoming\r\npaymaster to Joseph, he kept that wayward ruler in French leading\r\nstrings; and, by saving Maestricht and the Scheldt navigation to the\r\nDutch, he ensured the supremacy of France in that land. This compact\r\nwas followed two days later by a Franco-Dutch treaty of alliance\r\nwhereby the Court of Versailles guaranteed the possessions of the\r\nUnited Provinces; and each of the two States undertook to furnish ships\r\nand men to the other in case of attack.[442]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pitt awoke to a sense of the danger, and urged Harris to use\r\nhis utmost endeavours (short of an open breach with France) to prevent\r\nthe ratification of the treaty by the United Provinces. All that the\r\nenvoy could do was to present to the States General at The Hague a\r\nMemorial declaring the continued interest taken by England in the\r\naffairs of the Republic. But of what avail was this academic statement\r\nwithout a conditional and secret offer of armed support, which\r\neverybody knew France would give rather than forego her triumph? Again,\r\nearly in December, Pitt warned Carmarthen that Harris should “redouble\r\nevery possible effort” to prevent the Franco-Dutch alliance.[443] This\r\nwas merely to bid him fight with his hands tied.\r\n\r\nFrance now held a most commanding position in Europe. By the new\r\ncompacts she influenced Hapsburg policy, she forced Frederick the Great\r\ninto almost abject deference, she allured Catharine, and she controlled\r\nthe Dutch Netherlands. This last triumph crowned the life-work of\r\nVergennes. The recent treaties relieved him from the disagreeable\r\nalternative of choosing between Austria and the United Provinces in\r\ncase of a rupture. They emphasized the isolation of England. Above all,\r\nthey prepared the way for joint action of the French and Dutch East\r\nIndia Companies which might prove to be fatal to British ascendancy in\r\nIndia.[444]\r\n\r\nThe meagre correspondence of Pitt at this time contains scarcely a\r\nreference to this very serious crisis. His letters turn mainly on\r\nfinance, Irish affairs, and domestic topics such as the purchase of\r\nHolwood. On the Dutch problem there is not a word except the curiously\r\ncurt reference in his letter of October 6 to Grenville: “I have\r\nwritten to Lord Carmarthen on the Dutch business much as you seem to\r\nwish.”[445] The phrase is interesting as marking the commencement of\r\nthe influence which Grenville was soon to gain over Pitt in foreign\r\naffairs; but its nonchalance is astounding. In part, no doubt, the\r\npassivity of the Prime Minister resulted from the determination of\r\nGeorge III to hold aloof as King of England from all complications,\r\nhowever much, as Elector of Hanover, he might irritate Austria and\r\nRussia. As we shall see in the next chapter, George was beginning to\r\nbe alarmed at the growing expenses of his family, and viewed the Dutch\r\ncrisis mainly as involving burdensome demands on the Civil List. Here,\r\nthen, as at so many points in his career, Pitt was handicapped by the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nBut it is also probable that in the disappointing year 1785, marked\r\nby the failure of his Reform and Irish measures, he suppressed the\r\nconcern which he must have felt at the deepening isolation of England.\r\nWe must remember that he had formed a resolve to play a waiting game\r\nin foreign affairs. On August 8 he wrote to the Duke of Rutland that,\r\nif the commercial treaty with Ireland became law, and peace lasted for\r\nfive years, England would be able to look any Power in Europe in the\r\nface.[446] That explains why he tied the hands of Harris at The Hague\r\nand sent to Berlin overtures so cautious as to be received with polite\r\ndisdain. His great aim was to lessen the National Debt; and the year\r\n1785, with all its disappointments, witnessed a most extraordinary rise\r\nin Consols, viz. from 54¼ to 73½. There was the strength of England’s\r\nposition. If she reduced her debt, while all the Continental Powers\r\nwere ruinously increasing theirs, she must have the advantage when\r\nturmoil ended in war.\r\n\r\nPitt therefore adopted a policy of delay. So long as he could\r\nstrengthen the navy, maintain the army at the ordinary peace footing,\r\nand enhance the nation’s credit, he was content to bide his time,\r\nleaving Harris to combat French influence in Holland as best he\r\ncould.[447] Such a policy was very far from brilliant; and, had not\r\nFrance in the next two years entered on a period of rapid decline, he\r\nmight be censured for tamely waiting on events. For it is possible\r\nthat a bold initiative at Whitehall in October, while Vergennes’ Dutch\r\ntreaties were taking shape, might have gained active support either\r\nfrom Prussia or from Joseph II, who had been on very cool terms with\r\nFrance. Pitt, however, preferred to hold back, even though the Bourbons\r\ngained control of the United Provinces. By his passivity in face of\r\nthat diplomatic disaster we may measure his devotion to the cause of\r\npeace. And just as Queen Elizabeth often reassured her people at the\r\ngravest crisis by displays of frivolity, so too Pitt’s absorption\r\nin tree planting at Holwood may have been a device for hiding his\r\nanxiety, reassuring the public, and preventing a fall in the Funds.\r\n\r\nSerene hopefulness in the future of his country is a strong feature in\r\nthe character of this great man; and we shall find occasions when he\r\ndisplayed this quality to excess. Certain it is that he never lost hope\r\nor relaxed his energies, even now, when Ministers and envoys evinced\r\nsigns of gloom or despair. A proof of the prevalence of these feelings\r\nappears in one of the closing passages of a Memorandum which the Duke\r\nof Richmond, Master of the Ordnance, on 30th December 1785, sent to his\r\ncolleague, Carmarthen. It was written owing to a singular circumstance,\r\nwhich reveals the impulsiveness of Pitt. The Duke had almost casually\r\nsuggested the desirability of recovering some foothold in the Dutch\r\nNetherlands by inducing them to propose to include England in their\r\nrecent treaty with France. This hint, which the Duke threw out in\r\nconversation, was at once taken up by Pitt, who, without consulting the\r\nCabinet, urged Carmarthen to take steps to carry it into effect, and\r\nsuggested that one of the Patriots might be bribed to make the proposal\r\nof including England, as if it were to test the sincerity of her offers\r\nof friendship. Of course the matter came to nothing; but the surprise\r\nof the Duke at Pitt’s speedy adoption of the hint led him to descant on\r\nour isolation, and to harp on the well-worn theme of an alliance with\r\nAustria:--\r\n\r\n                                        Goodwood, December 30, 1785.\r\n\r\n    ... If the Emperor and France keep well together, Leghorn will be\r\n    also an inimical port,[448] as may Algiers and Marocco if their\r\n    treaties with Spain go on. Holland seems lost to us both in Europe\r\n    and the East Indies; and should the Emperor and Russia unite with\r\n    France, Sweden must follow, and Denmark dare not be our friend.\r\n    Under such circumstances what are we to look for but utter ruin!\r\n    If France is disengaged on the Continent and assisted by Spain,\r\n    Holland and Russia (to say nothing of America), we must be attacked\r\n    with greatly superior forces in the East and West Indies and\r\n    perhaps in Canada; but, what is still worse, we shall undoubtedly\r\n    have the war brought into Ireland, and I very much doubt whether we\r\n    can by any means avoid that country being divided, and a large part\r\n    acting against us. If any of these points of attack succeed, and\r\n    above all, if our navy should meet with any disaster from superior\r\n    forces, the next step will be to bring the war into this country,\r\n    and the best issue of such an event must be attended with much\r\n    distress. In short, the natural and political advantages of France\r\n    are such that I very much fear the consequences. To divert her\r\n    attention by stirring up some powerful enemy on the Continent has\r\n    been long and universally considered as our only resource, and yet\r\n    unfortunately we seem to be obstructing the only Power capable of\r\n    creating that diversion, which is the Emperor....[449]\r\n\r\nIt was amidst fears so intense and prejudices so deep-seated that Pitt\r\nundertook the negotiations for a friendly commercial treaty with France\r\nwhich is the chief event of the year 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nL’ENTENTE CORDIALE\r\n\r\n(1786)\r\n\r\n  Thy father’s fame with thine fair Truth shall blend.\r\n  His vigour saved from foreign foes the land,\r\n  Thy prudence makes each foreign foe a friend.\r\n\r\n                              REV. W. MASON TO PITT, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nation is but the family writ large; and, just as families after\r\na ruinous quarrel sometimes win their way back towards prudence and\r\nfriendliness, so too nations now and again feel the force of the\r\nsociable instincts. Such a time was now at hand for Great Britain\r\nand France. The eight years of the American War of Independence had\r\nincreased the debt of the Island Power by £115,000,000;[450] and so\r\nwasteful had been the conduct of the war by France that in the years\r\n1778–1783, she had exceeded the total of her already large peace\r\nexpenditure by £66,000,000.[451] Further, as that struggle brought to\r\nher few results beyond the satisfaction of rending the British Empire\r\nin twain, she was scarcely the better for it. In truth, while defeat\r\nled patriotic Britons to tread the humble paths of retrenchment and\r\nreform, the triumph of France allured her politicians into the stately\r\navenues ending in bankruptcy and Revolution.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of war, philosophy, science, and industry had\r\nbeen waging their peaceful campaigns; and now in the exhaustion or\r\nquiescence which beset both peoples, the still small voice of reason\r\nwas heard. The responsiveness of thought in England and France is\r\none of the most remarkable facts in the eighteenth century. Though\r\npolitical rivalry had five times over embroiled those peoples in deadly\r\nstrife, yet their thinkers had never ceased to feel the thrill of\r\nsympathetic ideas, originated by “the natural enemy,” which proved\r\nto be no less potent than the divulsive forces of statecraft. The\r\nMarconigrams of thought pass through storms, whether atmospheric\r\nor political; and it may be that finally the nations will become\r\nsounding-boards responding more and more to progressive ideas, and less\r\nand less to the passions of mankind.\r\n\r\nCertainly the mental sympathy of England and France in that century was\r\nstrongly marked. As is well known, the philosophy of Locke supplied\r\nVoltaire and Rousseau with most of the weapons of their intellectual\r\narmoury. From the English constitution Montesquieu drew many of the\r\ncontentions which lend significance to his _Esprit des Lois_. The ideas\r\nof naturalism and sensibility were wafted hither from the garner of\r\nRousseau. Philanthropy became a force in both lands about the same\r\ntime but in diverse ways. In France it was in the main anti-clerical,\r\nspringing from the indignant protests of Voltaire against atrocities\r\nsuch as that inflicted by the Church on Calas. In this land it may\r\nbe traced to the Wesleyan revival, the motive which impelled Howard,\r\nClarkson, and Wilberforce being distinctly religious.\r\n\r\nOn a lower plane we notice the immense vogue of English fashions in\r\nFrance, and of French _modes_ in England. _Grands seigneurs_ sought to\r\ncopy our field sports, swathed themselves in English _redingotes_, and\r\nrose in the stirrups _à l’Anglaise_. The Duc de Chartres (the future\r\nPhilippe Egalité) set the rage for English ways and fabrics, so that\r\nFrench industries seriously suffered. In 1785 the French Minister\r\ncomplained to our envoy that French draperies could not be sold unless\r\nthey looked like English stuffs.[452] Britons returned the compliment.\r\nThey swarmed into France. We find our envoy complaining that English\r\nfamilies were settling in every French town, so that it might be well\r\nto devise an absentee tax which would drive them homewards.[453]\r\n\r\nBut no influence helped on the new cosmopolitanism so much as the\r\nspread of ideas of Free Trade. Here the honours lie with French\r\nthinkers. It was by residence in France and contact with the\r\n_Economistes_, Quesnay and Turgot, that Adam Smith was able to\r\nformulate the ideas soon to be embodied in the “Wealth of Nations.”\r\nHere we may note a curious paradox. The practical islanders supplied\r\ntheir neighbours with political ideas which, when barbed by Voltaire\r\nand Rousseau, did much to gall France into violent action. On the other\r\nhand, the more nimble-witted people gave to its trading rival the\r\nfiscal principles (neglected at home) which furthered the extension\r\nof its commerce. Venomous use might be made of this contrast by that\r\nfast diminishing band of Anglophobes who see in all British actions\r\nperfidious attempts to ruin France; but it must be remembered that\r\neverything depends on the men who introduce and apply the new ideas,\r\nand that, whereas France was unfortunate in the men who promulgated and\r\nworked the political principles learnt in England, the islanders on the\r\ncontrary had the wisest of counsellors. Contrast Voltaire, Rousseau,\r\nand Robespierre with Adam Smith and Pitt, and the riddle is solved at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nAmidst the exhaustion of war, both nations were now ready to listen\r\nto all that was most convincing in the arguments of the _Economistes_\r\nand of Adam Smith. These exponents of the nascent science of Economics\r\nrendered a memorable service to the cause of peace by urging nations,\r\nlike sensible traders, to rejoice in the prosperity of their\r\nneighbours, not in their poverty. Propinquity, said they, should be an\r\nincentive to free intercourse, not to hatred. Adam Smith pointed out\r\nin his “Wealth of Nations” (1776) that France could offer us a market\r\neight times as populous as that of our North American colonies, and\r\ntwenty-four times as advantageous if the frequency of the returns were\r\nreckoned. The British market, he said, would be equally profitable\r\nto France. He laughed to scorn the notion that France would always\r\ndrain Great Britain of her specie, and showed that the worship of the\r\n“balance of trade” was accountable for much folly and bloodshed.[454]\r\nIt is difficult to say whether these views had much hold on the\r\nEnglish people. If we may judge from the passions aroused by Pitt’s\r\nIrish Resolutions, it was slight. On the other hand the absence of\r\nany vehement opposition to the commercial treaty with France a year\r\nlater, shows either that public opinion here was moving forwards, or\r\nthat the Opposition felt it impossible to bring to bear on the absolute\r\ngovernment of Louis XVI those irritating arguments which had had so\r\npotent an influence on the Irish people.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the _Economistes_ in France probably did not count\r\nfor very much. But they had shown their power during the brief but\r\nbeneficent ministry of Turgot; and even when Marie Antoinette procured\r\nthe dismissal of that able but austere Minister, one of his disciples\r\nremained in office, and was now Minister of Foreign Affairs. This\r\nwas Vergennes. Few men at that time did more for the cause of human\r\nbrotherhood than this man, whom Carlyle described as “solid phlegmatic\r\n... like some dull punctual clerk.” A man’s importance depends,\r\nafter all, not so much on external brilliance as on the worth of his\r\nachievements; a statesman who largely decided the Franco-American\r\nalliance, the terms of peace in 1783, and the resumption of friendly\r\nrelations with England, need not fear the verdict of history. In a\r\nlittle known fragment written in April 1776, Vergennes thus outlines an\r\nintelligent policy:\r\n\r\n    Wise and happy will that nation be which will be the first to adapt\r\n    its policy to the new circumstances of the age, and to consent\r\n    to see in its colonies nothing more than allied provinces and no\r\n    longer subject States of the mother-land. Wise and happy will that\r\n    nation be which is the first to be convinced that commercial policy\r\n    consists wholly in employing lands in the way most advantageous for\r\n    the owners, also the arms of the people in the most useful way,\r\n    that is, as self-interest will enjoin if there is no coercion;\r\n    and that all the rest is only illusion and vanity. When the total\r\n    separation of America [from Great Britain] has forced everybody\r\n    to recognize this truth and weaned the European nations from\r\n    commercial jealousy, it will remove one important cause of war, and\r\n    it is difficult not to desire an event which ought to bring this\r\n    boon to the human race.[455]\r\n\r\nTwo years later, when France drew the sword on behalf of the Americans,\r\nBritons naturally scoffed at these philanthropic pretensions. The\r\nconduct of her Court and nobles was certainly open to the charge of\r\nhypocrisy, especially when Louis XVI issued the ordinance of 1781\r\nrestricting the higher commissions in his army to those nobles who\r\ncould show sixteen quarters of nobility. Singular, indeed, to battle\r\nfor democracy in the new world and yet draw tighter the bands of\r\nprivilege in France! Yet Vergennes, Necker, and other friends of reform\r\nwere not responsible for this regal folly; and they were doubtless\r\nsincere in hoping that the downfall of England’s colonial system would\r\ninaugurate a new era in the politics and commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nA proof of the sincerity of Vergennes is to be found in the 18th\r\nArticle of the Treaty of Versailles (1783), which stipulated that,\r\nimmediately after the ratification of the treaty, commissioners should\r\nbe appointed to prepare new commercial arrangements between the two\r\nnations “on the basis of reciprocity and mutual convenience, which\r\narrangements are to be terminated and concluded within the space of two\r\nyears from the 1st of January 1784.” For this clause Lords Shelburne\r\nand Grantham on the British side were chiefly responsible; and it is\r\ncertain that the former warmly approved it.[456] Pitt, as Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer in that Ministry, doubtless also welcomed the proposal;\r\nbut I have found no sign of his opinions on the subject. The credit for\r\nthis enlightened proposal may probably be assigned to Vergennes, seeing\r\nthat he dictated terms, while the British Cabinet accepted them. There\r\nis a ring of sincerity in his words written on 1st February 1783 to de\r\nRayneval, then his diplomatic agent in London: “It is an old prejudice,\r\nwhich I do not share, that there is a natural incompatibility between\r\nthese two peoples.... Every nation must strive for the utmost\r\nprosperity; but this cannot be based on exclusiveness, otherwise it\r\nwould be a nullity. One does not get rich from very poor nations.”[457]\r\nThis seems to be an echo of Adam Smith’s dictum: “A nation that would\r\nenrich itself by foreign trade is certainly most likely to do so when\r\nits neighbours are all rich, industrious, and commercial nations.”[458]\r\n\r\nStatesmen on this side of the Channel were slower than their rivals\r\nin seeking to realize these enlightened aims. The fall of Shelburne’s\r\nMinistry and the triumph of the Fox-North Coalition led to no important\r\nchange in the Treaty, which was signed at Versailles in September 1783;\r\nbut the commercial treaty was shelved for the present. With all his\r\nenlightenment in matters political, Fox had a limited outlook in the\r\ncommercial sphere. He held the old Whig views, which for wellnigh a\r\ncentury had been narrowly national and mercantilist. Further, he hotly\r\ncontested the claim put forward by the French Government to consider\r\nall trading arrangements at an end, including those of the Treaty of\r\nUtrecht, if no arrangement were formed before the end of the year\r\n1785.[459]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when Pitt and Carmarthen took office\r\nat the close of the year 1783. The events described in the previous\r\nchapter will have enabled the reader to understand the need of\r\ngreat caution on the part of Pitt. Though the language of Vergennes\r\nwas redolent of human brotherhood, his actions were often shrewdly\r\ndiplomatic. In the United Provinces, as we have seen, his policy wore\r\na twofold aspect. While supporting the Patriots, he claimed to be\r\nsupporting the cause of democracy, but he also dealt a blow at British\r\ninfluence. Though he maintained the Austrian alliance, he coquetted\r\nwith Prussia; and, while dallying with the Czarina in order to keep\r\nout England, he made a profitable bargain with Russia’s enemy, Sweden,\r\nrespecting Gothenburg. Thus on all sides he advanced the cause of\r\nenlightenment and the interests of France.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this dextrous union of philosophy and\r\nstatecraft (which resembles that by which Napoleon utilized Rousseau’s\r\nadvocacy of natural boundaries) earned the hatred of nearly every\r\nBriton. Carmarthen and Harris were deeply imbued with these feelings;\r\nand it is certain that Pitt, while taking the outstretched hand of\r\nVergennes, half expected a dagger-thrust. We find Grenville writing\r\nto Carmarthen on 25th February 1785 concerning a plan, which Pitt had\r\nformed, for provisionally buying over a Mr. D. S. M. at Paris to send\r\nconfidential news, especially respecting the plans and movements of\r\nthe French in the East Indies. He was to receive 60 guineas a month\r\nfor news sent to Daniel Hailes, Secretary at the British Embassy,\r\nand 250 guineas at the end of three months if his information gave\r\nsatisfaction.[460] Other items make if clear that Pitt viewed with\r\nconcern the activity of France in the East. The formation of a French\r\nEast India Company in March 1785 was a threatening sign;[461] and in\r\nthe summer came a report from Sir Robert Ainslie, British ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, that France was intriguing to gain a foothold in Egypt\r\non the Red Sea. Part of his despatch of 23rd July 1785 is worth quoting:\r\n\r\n    ... The Porte has varied in her general opposition to establishing\r\n    a trade through Egypt, by opening the navigation of the Red Sea to\r\n    the flag of Christian Powers. The present undertaking and the late\r\n    French mission to Cairo was in consequence of a plan devised by the\r\n    late French ambassador to ruin our East India Company by an illicit\r\n    trade under the protection of France, in which it was thought the\r\n    Company’s servants would join most heartily. It is clear that\r\n    France adopted this scheme, but I can pledge myself the Porte was\r\n    not consulted and that she will never protect a project by far\r\n    more dangerous to her own interests than even to ours. It seems\r\n    Count Priest hoped to elude the Ottoman bad humour by employing the\r\n    navigation of the flags of all Christian Powers indiscriminately\r\n    and to secure his trade by the protection of the Beys of Egypt, who\r\n    certainly have aimed at absolute independence ever since the time\r\n    of Ali Bey.[462]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Sir James Harris with Carmarthen shows that\r\nour Ministry kept a watchful eye on any symptoms which portended a\r\nunion of the Dutch East India Company with that of France. Indeed,\r\nas we shall see, the reasons which prompted the resolute action of\r\nPitt at the crisis of 1787 in Holland were largely based on naval and\r\ncolonial considerations. Matters in the East were in an uneasy state.\r\nOnce again, in January 1786, Hailes reported that the unsettled state\r\nof Egypt was known to be attracting the notice of the French Foreign\r\nOffice, probably with a view to conquest.[463] The efforts which France\r\nput forth in 1785–6 for the construction of a great naval fortress at\r\nCherbourg also claimed attention; and Britons were not calmed by the\r\nphilosophic reflections of some peace-loving Gauls that the completion\r\nof that mighty harbour would render it impossible for England to make\r\nwar on France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn view of the lowering political horizon, is it surprising that\r\nPitt was very cautious in responding to the proposals of the French\r\nCabinet for a friendly commercial treaty? It is incorrect to say, as\r\nHarris did in a rather peevish outburst, that Pitt was too occupied\r\nwith Parliament to attend to foreign affairs.[464] We now know that\r\nhe paid much attention to them, though the pressing problems of\r\nfinance, India, Ireland, and Reform perforce held the first place in\r\nhis thoughts. But he must have desired to gain a clearer insight into a\r\nvery complex situation before he committed his country to a commercial\r\ntreaty with France.[465] To have done so prematurely might have\r\nprevented the formation of that closer political union with Russia and\r\nAustria which British statesmen long and vainly struggled to effect.\r\n\r\nBut another motive probably weighed even more with Pitt in favour\r\nof delay. We have seen how fondly and tenaciously he clung to the\r\nhope of a commercial union between Great Britain and Ireland through\r\nthe session of 1785. Surely it was of prime importance to complete\r\nthe fiscal system of the British Islands before he entered into\r\nnegotiations with a foreign Power. To have hurried on the French\r\ncommercial treaty before that with Ireland was concluded would have\r\nbeen a grave tactical error. As a firm economic unit, Great Britain and\r\nIreland could hope for far better terms from France than as separate\r\nentities; and this consideration almost certainly supplies the reason\r\nfor Pitt’s extreme anxiety to assure the industrial unity of these\r\nislands before he began to bargain with France; while it may also\r\nexplain the desire of Vergennes to press on the negotiation before the\r\nBritish Islands had acquired fiscal solidarity. In fine, everything\r\nconspired to impose on Pitt a passive attitude. Vergennes, as the\r\nvictor, could propose terms; Pitt, representing the beaten Power, could\r\nonly await them. Such was the situation in 1784–5. An autocracy founded\r\non privilege seemed to be threatening our political existence, and yet\r\nmade commercial proposals which might have come from Adam Smith himself.\r\n\r\nThe British Government responded to them very slowly. In the spring\r\nof 1784 it appointed George Craufurd to act as our commissioner at\r\nVersailles for the drafting of a commercial arrangement, as was\r\nrequired by the treaty of 1783; but he did not receive his instructions\r\nuntil September. Rayneval, who had the full confidence of Vergennes,\r\nwas the French commissioner; and at their first interview he asked that\r\nthe principle of reciprocity should form the basis of the negotiations.\r\nTo this the British Court demurred, and the affair remained in suspense\r\nfor some months. On 3rd March 1785 Craufurd wrote to Carmarthen that\r\nhe was still waiting for replies to his notes of 30th September and\r\n25th November, and that Vergennes had repeatedly expressed to the Duke\r\nof Dorset, the British ambassador, his annoyance at the loss of time.\r\nHis resentment had recently taken a tangible form; he had issued an\r\nordinance (_arrêt_) imposing a tax of sixty per cent on all carriages\r\nimported from the United Kingdom. This action led Carmarthen to break\r\nhis long silence on commercial matters and to protest against the\r\ntax as tending to “prevent that spirit of conciliation or friendly\r\nliberality so necessary at this time to produce any good effect for\r\nthose commercial arrangements now in contemplation.”[466] He also\r\nhinted that Great Britain might with perfect justice retaliate.\r\nFurther, he repudiated the French claim, once again raised, that\r\nall commercial arrangements would lapse by the end of 1785, and\r\nmaintained that the Treaty of Utrecht would afterwards equally be in\r\nforce. After further delays Rayneval demanded that there should be\r\nabsolute reciprocity in their commercial dealings, the basis of the\r\nmost favoured nation being adopted where it did not infringe existing\r\ntreaties. To this Carmarthen sent the following reply on 5th August:\r\n\r\n    Mutual benefits and reciprocal advantages are indisputably the\r\n    objects we are inclined to pursue in the adjustment of this\r\n    business; but to say at once that the two nations shall be\r\n    entitled to those privileges which are alone allowed to the most\r\n    favoured nations, by way of a basis to the negotiation and without\r\n    weighing the nature and consequence of such privileges is totally\r\n    impossible; and of this I think M. de Rayneval must be convinced\r\n    when he recollects that it was a stipulation of this sort contained\r\n    in the 8th and 9th articles of the Treaty of Commerce of Utrecht\r\n    in 1713 that prevented those articles from ever being carried into\r\n    effect.[467]\r\n\r\nConsidering that reciprocity and the most favoured nation treatment\r\nhad been urged by Rayneval at his first interview with Craufurd in\r\nSeptember 1784, it is difficult to see why Carmarthen felt flurried by\r\nthe present proposal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Vergennes had struck another heavy blow. He issued an\r\n_arrêt_ forbidding foreigners to share in the French trade to the\r\nBarbary States, and on 10th July he prohibited the import of foreign\r\ncottons, muslins, gauzes, and linens into France. At once there arose\r\na cry of distress and rage throughout Great Britain; and Carmarthen\r\nsent an energetic remonstrance against this further proof of the\r\nill-humour of the French Government. Hailes at once informed him\r\nthat the two _arrêts_ had “been suspended with more forbearance than\r\ncould reasonably have been expected, considering the detriment French\r\nmanufactures have sustained, and the great advantage we have derived\r\nfrom the balance of trade being so much and so long in our favour.\r\nPeople in general think that this strong measure will hasten the\r\nconclusion of an arrangement between us.”[468] Vergennes soon assured\r\nHailes of his desire for a friendly arrangement, but he added that\r\nmeanwhile the French Government had to look to its own needs and stop\r\nthe enormous influx of British goods, for which the French public\r\nclamoured. Commerce and finance were then the chief care of the French\r\nGovernment. On 25th August Hailes reported the pains secretly taken\r\nby the French to attract skilled English workmen. On 22nd September\r\nCraufurd stated that further disagreeable events would happen unless\r\nsome progress were made with the commercial treaty; Rayneval observed\r\nthat, if we objected to reciprocity and the most favoured nation basis,\r\nit was for us to make a proposal. On 21st October Vergennes issued\r\nanother unfriendly _arrêt_ prohibiting the import of iron, steel, and\r\ncutlery; but Hailes continued to assure Carmarthen that Vergennes and\r\nRayneval were anxious for a final settlement and that the _arrêts_ were\r\n“meant to stimulate us to a conclusion of the commercial treaty as soon\r\nas possible.”[469]\r\n\r\nPitt now began to bestir himself on this matter. In order to have at\r\nParis a commissioner abler, or more acceptable, than Craufurd seems to\r\nhave been, he made overtures to William Eden (the future Lord Auckland)\r\nwith a view to his acting as special commissioner in his place. In the\r\nAuckland Papers at the British Museum there is an unpublished letter\r\nof Pitt to Eden, dated Brighthelmstone, 16th October 1785, in answer\r\nto one in which Eden had hinted that he would prefer the Speakership\r\nof the House of Commons, as Cornwall “obviously suffered while in the\r\nchair.”[470] Pitt’s reply is as follows:\r\n\r\n    It gives me great satisfaction to find that there remains no\r\n    obstacle to your acceptance of either of the situations mentioned\r\n    in my letter to Mr. Beresford, and that nothing seems left to\r\n    settle but the mode of carrying such an arrangement into effect. I\r\n    confess I am not aware of any means which could properly be taken\r\n    to induce the Speaker to retire at present; and therefore in the\r\n    interval I should very much wish to accelerate the execution of the\r\n    other idea.[471]\r\n\r\nPitt then refers to some difficulties which make it desirable to\r\ndefer the actual appointment until the session had begun. He suggests\r\nconferences, especially as in a fortnight he would be nearer to Eden.\r\nAll this bespeaks a degree of nonchalance quite remarkable considering\r\nthe importance of the questions at stake. Everything tends to show\r\nthat Pitt felt far less interest in this negotiation than in that with\r\nIreland, to which he had very properly given the first place. The\r\neffort to free trade between the two islands having now failed, there\r\nwas no reason for further postponing the discussions with France.\r\n\r\nSuch seems to me the reasonable way of explaining his procedure. The\r\ncontention of the French historian of this treaty, that Pitt was\r\nopposed to the commercial arrangement with France, and was only forced\r\ninto it by the hostile _arrêts_, is untenable.[472] He maintains that\r\nit was the last _arrêt_, that of 21st October, which brought Pitt to\r\nhis senses--“Mr. Pitt, who did not _then_ wish for war, surrendered.”\r\nThis phrase reveals the prejudice of the writer, who, publishing his\r\nwork at the time of Cobden’s negotiations with Napoleon III, obviously\r\nset himself to prove that Free Trade was French both in the origin of\r\nthe idea and in the carrying out in practice by statesmen. Passing\r\nover these claims, we should remember that Pitt had made his first\r\novertures to Eden in the first week in October, some ten days before\r\nthe appearance of the _arrêt_, which, in Butenval’s version, compelled\r\nhim to “surrender.”\r\n\r\nPitt acted with much circumspection. He urged Eden to collect\r\ninformation on trade matters; but it seems that not until December did\r\nthe new Council of Trade set on foot any official inquiries.[473]\r\nPerhaps the Irish negotiation, which was hurried on too fast, had\r\ngiven him pause. Meanwhile, however, France had gained another success\r\nby imposing her mediation on the Emperor Joseph II and the Dutch\r\nGovernment and settling the disputes between them. As appeared in the\r\nprevious chapter, this treaty led to the conclusion of an alliance\r\n(10th November 1785) both political and commercial, with the United\r\nProvinces, which emphasized the isolation of England and secured the\r\nDutch markets for France. Thus the delay in meeting the advances of\r\nVergennes had been doubly prejudicial to British interests, and it must\r\nbe confessed that Pitt’s _début_ in European diplomacy was far from\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we look into details, we find that Carmarthen hampered\r\nthe negotiations at the outset by refusing to accept the “most\r\nfavoured nation” basis of negotiation, and by throwing on France the\r\nresponsibility for not proposing some “practicable” scheme. On 14th\r\nOctober 1785 he wrote to Hailes that Great Britain very much desired a\r\ncommercial treaty with France, and was waiting for “specific proposals”\r\nfrom her; and again, on 4th November, that matters seemed hopeless,\r\nowing to Rayneval’s obstinate adherence to his original scheme.[474]\r\nThis pedantic conduct was fast enclosing the whole affair in a\r\nvicious circle. Meanwhile the sands of time were running out: and it\r\nseemed that England would be left friendless and at the mercy of any\r\ncommercial arrangement which France chose to enforce after the close\r\nof the year. It is strange that Pitt did not insist on the furtherance\r\nof a matter which he judged to be “of great national importance.”[475]\r\nBut his only step for the present was to write a letter, signed by\r\nCarmarthen, asking for an extension of time beyond the end of that\r\nyear. In reply Vergennes expressed the satisfaction of Louis XVI that\r\nGreat Britain was seriously desirous of framing a commercial treaty and\r\ngranted six months’ extension of time.[476] A year was finally granted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this further proof of Vergennes’ good will, the\r\nnegotiation began under conditions so unfavourable to Great Britain\r\nas to call for a skilled negotiator; but the career of William Eden\r\nwarranted the hope that he would bear the burden of responsibility\r\ntriumphantly. Born in 1744, and educated at Eton and Christchurch,\r\nhe early showed marked abilities, which were sharpened by practice\r\nat the Bar. He also devoted his attention to social and economic\r\nquestions; and when, in 1780, he became Chief Secretary for Ireland\r\nunder the Earl of Carlisle, he did much to promote the prosperity of\r\nthat land, especially by helping to found the Bank of Ireland. He\r\ntook keen interest in the treatment of prisoners, and proposed to\r\nsubstitute hard labour for transportation. The reform of the penal\r\nlaws also engaged his attention. He had long been attached to Lord\r\nNorth’s party, though his views were more progressive than theirs. By\r\nhis marriage with the sister of Sir Gilbert Elliot he came into touch\r\nwith the Whigs; and, though his petulant conduct in 1782 with regard\r\nto the resignation of the lord-lieutenancy by Carlisle caused general\r\nannoyance, he was largely instrumental in bringing about the Fox-North\r\nCoalition. Consistency sat lightly upon Eden; and when, in 1785, he\r\nhotly opposed Pitt’s Irish proposals, similar in effect to his own of\r\nsome years earlier, he was roundly abused by one of his friends for his\r\nfactiousness.[477] The same correspondent soon had cause to upbraid\r\nhim still further for his conduct in the autumn of 1785, when, leaving\r\nthe Opposition, he went over to the Government side in order to act as\r\nspecial commissioner at Paris. The Duke of Portland coldly commended\r\nhim for placing country above party; but the many saw in the move\r\nonly enlightened self-interest and felt no confidence in him. Wraxall\r\nexpressed the prevalent opinion when he said that there “existed in\r\nEden’s physiognomy, even in his manner and deportment, something\r\nwhich did not convey the impression of plain dealing or inspire\r\nconfidence.”[478]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Eden was the ablest negotiator whom Pitt could have chosen\r\nfor a difficult commercial bargain; Wedgwood at once wrote to say that\r\nhe would have been his choice; and the remarks as to Pitt filching away\r\na prominent member of the Opposition are clearly prompted by spite.\r\nAfter hearing much evidence on commercial matters at the Committee\r\nof Council, Eden set out for Paris at the end of March 1786, and was\r\nwelcomed by Vergennes as a kindred soul. The Duke of Dorset was\r\nsomewhat offended at his coming, and held aloof. Fortunately he found\r\nit desirable to take a long holiday in England, during which time the\r\naffairs of the embassy were ably carried on by Eden and Hailes. A\r\npopular song of the day referred to this in the lines:\r\n\r\n  For Dorset at cricket can play\r\n  And leave Billy Eden in France, sir.\r\n\r\nDorset’s services were, in fact, mainly social. He was liked by Marie\r\nAntoinette; and his _thés dansants_ were frequented by the leading\r\nnobles.[479]\r\n\r\nOn Eden, then, and Pitt (for Carmarthen felt no trust in the French)\r\nlay the chief burden of the negotiations. It is clear that Pitt now\r\ntook a keen interest in the affair; and as Vergennes, Rayneval, and\r\nCalonne (Minister of Finance) showed a marked desire to come to a fair\r\ncompromise, the matter was soon in good train. The chief difficulties\r\narose from the suspicions of Carmarthen and the desire of Jenkinson,\r\nhead of the Council of Trade, to drive a hard bargain with France.\r\nPitt could not be indifferent to the opinions of his colleagues; and\r\nhis experience of British manufacturers was such as to make him press\r\nfor the best possible terms. That he still felt some distrust of the\r\nCourt of Versailles is clear from his letter of 19th April 1786 to Eden\r\nthat their financial embarrassments were such as “to secure, at least\r\nfor a time, a sincere disposition to peace.”[480] By that time, too,\r\nhe must have received Eden’s letter of 13th April marked “Private and\r\nconfidential,” which referred in glowing terms to the prospects of the\r\nnegotiation:\r\n\r\n    It is a circumstance which I shall think a just subject of pride\r\n    to us both in the present age and of merit with posterity if the\r\n    result should be what at this moment seems probable.... France\r\n    shows a disposition to encourage our trade if we remove the\r\n    senseless and peevish distinctions which fill so many lines in our\r\n    Book of Rates; and a decided resolution to obstruct it as much as\r\n    possible if those distinctions are suffered to remain. In the same\r\n    time all the speculations and exertions of our trade with this\r\n    Kingdom are suspended, and the manufactures, the navigation and the\r\n    revenue are suffering. Besides, all the trading and manufacturing\r\n    parts of England are at this hour disposed to go much greater\r\n    lengths than are now suggested.... It is even highly possible that\r\n    this treaty may form a new epoch in history.[481]\r\n\r\nOver against the enthusiasm of Eden we may set the distrust of\r\nCarmarthen, as evinced in his statement to that envoy on 29th April,\r\nthat if France could ever be sincere, Eden would doubtless bring the\r\nbargain to a successful issue.[482] Far less complimentary were his\r\nreferences to Eden in private letters to Dorset and Harris. From\r\nthe former he inquired: “How is our paragon of perfection relished\r\nin France?”[483] In a letter to Harris, who constantly maintained\r\nthat Eden was playing the game for Versailles, not for London,\r\nCarmarthen referred to “the absurd and officious letter of our great\r\ncommercial negotiator.”[484] It is well to remember these jealousies;\r\nfor, as Harris was the bosom friend of Carmarthen, he succeeded in\r\npersuading him that the whole negotiation with France was a trick of\r\nour arch-enemy. The letter of Harris, which called forth Carmarthen’s\r\nironical reply, ended with the statement that France sought “to depress\r\nus everywhere, to keep us in an isolated and unconnected state, till\r\nsuch time as they think they can cripple us irrecoverably by an open\r\nhostile attack.”[485] These suspicions must have been passed on to Pitt\r\nafter due sifting; and it speaks much for the evenness and serenity\r\nof his mind that he persevered with the negotiation in spite of the\r\nprejudices of his Foreign Minister. Naturally, also, he kept the affair\r\nin his own hands.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Pitt occupied a position intermediate between that of\r\nthe incurably suspicious Carmarthen and of the pleased and rather\r\nself-conscious Eden. When the latter very speedily arrived at a\r\npreliminary agreement, or Projet, with Rayneval, and begged that it\r\nshould be adopted as speedily, and with as few alterations as possible,\r\nPitt subjected it to friendly but close scrutiny. His reply of 10th May\r\nhas been printed among the Auckland Journals; but his criticisms were\r\neven more practical in a long letter of 26th May, which is among the\r\nPitt Papers. The following sentences are of special interest:\r\n\r\n    The Principles on which the Projet is founded are undoubtedly those\r\n    on which it is to be wished that this business may be finally\r\n    concluded, both as they tend to the mutual advantage of the two\r\n    Countries in their commercial intercourse, and as they include the\r\n    abolition of useless and injurious distinctions. But on the fullest\r\n    consideration it has not appeared to His Majesty’s servants that\r\n    it would be proper to advise the immediate conclusion of a treaty\r\n    on the footing of that Projet without some additions to it which\r\n    may tend to give a more certain and permanent effect to these\r\n    principles.... In addition to this, the Projet, as it now stands\r\n    affords no security that general prohibitions or prohibitory duties\r\n    may not at any time take place in either Country to the exclusion\r\n    of whatever may happen to be the chief articles of trade from the\r\n    other. It is true that the same motives which should guide both\r\n    parties in the present negotiation might for a long time prevent\r\n    their adopting a conduct so contrary to the spirit of the proposed\r\n    agreement. But it cannot be the wish of either Court to trust to\r\n    this security only. We ought by all the means in our power to\r\n    remove even the possibility of future jealousy on these subjects.\r\n    And it appears from the observations of the French Government on\r\n    the first sketch of this Projet that they felt the force of this\r\n    remark. There can therefore be no doubt of their readiness to\r\n    concur in anything which can give it a greater degree of stability\r\n    and certainty. And we shall probably arrive sooner at the great\r\n    object--a solid and comprehensive settlement of the commercial\r\n    intercourse between the two countries than by beginning with a\r\n    Preliminary Treaty, unexceptionable indeed in its principles, but\r\n    which would necessarily reserve some very important points for\r\n    separate discussion, and would in the meantime leave the whole\r\n    system incomplete and precarious.[486]\r\n\r\nPitt then pointed out to Eden that the discussion of a compact of\r\na temporary nature would tend to unsettle the minds of traders and\r\nperhaps even to discredit the whole undertaking. Accordingly he\r\nenclosed a Declaration, which comprised the substance of the French\r\nProjet, but gave it a more permanent form and set limits to the duties\r\nwhich might thereafter be levied. The letter shows that he had got\r\nover his first suspicions and was now working for a more thorough and\r\npermanent settlement than that sketched by Rayneval. The draft of the\r\nBritish Declaration is in Pitt’s writing--a proof that he had taken\r\nthis matter largely into his own hands. The replies of Eden to him are\r\nboth long and frequent; but most of those preserved in the British\r\nMuseum are too faded to be legible. In that of 6th June he warned Pitt\r\nthat France was ready to settle matters on friendly terms, but, as\r\nthere were many intrigues against the treaty, Pitt should conclude it\r\npromptly. More favourable terms might possibly be gained for British\r\ncottons and steel; but it would be best not to press the Versailles\r\nCabinet too hard.[487]\r\n\r\nPitt, however, refused to hurry matters. Indeed, the only part of this\r\nlong effusion which he heeded, seems to have been that respecting steel\r\nand cottons. He further distressed Eden by his action with regard\r\nto silks. Under pressure from the London silk-workers, he found it\r\nnecessary to continue to exclude all foreign silk-goods,[488] which\r\ncaused Eden to remark on 17th June: “With what face I am to propose the\r\nadmission of English cottons and the exclusion of French silks I do not\r\nwell foresee.”[489]\r\n\r\nMost of the official letters between Pitt and Eden will be found in\r\nLord Auckland’s Journals. We will therefore glance only at some of\r\ntheir letters which have not been published. They show that Pitt sought\r\nby all possible means to lessen the duties on British cottons and\r\nhardware imported into France, and that he demurred to the abrogation\r\nof the Methuen Treaty with Portugal (1703) which had accorded to\r\nher wines exceptionally favourable treatment. Discussions on these\r\nand other topics were retarded by the long debates at Westminster\r\nconcerning the Sinking Fund and Warren Hastings: so that on 13th July\r\nEden ironically informed Pitt that all his letters to him since 10th\r\nJune had miscarried. The close of the session (11th July) left Pitt\r\nfreer for diplomatic affairs; he threw himself into the bargaining with\r\nmuch zest, and Eden more than once hinted that a great outcry would\r\narise in France if their Ministers gave way to our demands.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Pitt struggled hard to obtain the best possible terms not\r\nonly for Great Britain but also for Ireland. Despite Eden’s repeated\r\nappeals for urgency, he asked the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lieutenant of\r\nIreland, to induce the Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Speaker,\r\nand Beresford to come to London for the purpose of advising him on\r\nseveral matters that concerned Ireland, especially as to the admission\r\nor exclusion of French linens. This further delay wrung Eden’s heart,\r\nand he wrote on 31st August: “Your political courage goes beyond mine,\r\nfor I suppose that you look without anxiety on this fortnight’s delay,\r\nwhich we are giving. In truth, if it is given in politeness to Ireland,\r\nit is a great compliment; for it is impossible to do more for Ireland\r\nthan we have done.”[490] He then made the noteworthy prophecy that, as\r\nthe treaty could not possibly adjust all the topics relating to the\r\ntrade of Britain and Ireland, it would lead up to a right settlement\r\nbetween the two islands. Certainly Eden equalled Pitt in foresight,\r\nhowever much he fell short of him in coolness, determination, and\r\nbargaining power.\r\n\r\nThese qualities appear very forcibly in the Anglo-French negotiation.\r\nIt is probable that Pitt bargained too closely; but the reason is\r\napparent if one looks at the scores of petitions that reached him\r\nfrom alarmed manufacturers. Lancashire was well to the front in its\r\ndemands for favourable terms; and we therefore find Pitt holding out\r\nfor only a 5 per cent. duty in France on British cottons. To this\r\nRayneval retorted by claiming at least 20 per cent.--“M. de Vergennes\r\nwas of opinion,” wrote Eden, “for 15 per cent., and M. de Calonne,\r\nafter much dispute, and by the aid of a paper in which I had urged\r\nfor 5 per cent., split the difference and carried it for 10 (but with\r\ngreat doubts).”[491] Calonne, the cheerful and prodigal Controller\r\nof Finances, now began to take a closer interest in the treaty; he\r\ninveighed against Pitt for prohibiting French silks while expecting the\r\nalmost free entry of British cottons, and said that there were 60,000\r\nworkers at Lyons who would curse him for this treaty. This explains why\r\nthe French negotiators once again held out for 15 per cent., and, when\r\nthat was rejected by Pitt, finally fixed it at 12 per cent.\r\n\r\nPitt also struggled to gain easier terms for Irish linens in France,\r\nand suggested that if this were conceded, the Dublin Parliament would\r\nprobably accept the Anglo-French treaty _in toto_.[492] On the subject\r\nof hardware Pitt fought for the interests of Birmingham, as appears\r\nin the draft of a long despatch to Eden, of 4th September, with many\r\ncorrections and additions in his writing. Very significant is the last\r\nsentence, which is in his hand:\r\n\r\n    If you cannot obtain a reduction to 5 or 7½ per cent. on iron,\r\n    copper, or brass, you will endeavour to gain it on iron alone, that\r\n    being a point which H.M.’s servants have most earnestly at heart,\r\n    and in which the reasoning above stated seems conclusive in our\r\n    favour. This is a point to be pressed to the utmost, but if you\r\n    should find it _absolutely_ impossible to carry it, it should not\r\n    ultimately prevent your signing the treaty.[493]\r\n\r\nThe treaty, signed at Versailles on 26th September 1786, may be thus\r\nsummarized: It granted complete freedom of navigation and trading\r\nrights between the two nations for their European dominions. The\r\nsubjects of either kingdom were thenceforth free to enter the lands\r\nof the other without licence or passport, and free of any capitation\r\ntax--a privilege most unusual in those days--and to enjoy perfect\r\nreligious liberty. In regard to the most important of French exports,\r\nnamely, wine, Great Britain agreed to place her neighbour on the\r\nfooting of the most favoured nation by lowering the duties to the level\r\nof those imposed on Portuguese wines. The duties on French vinegar\r\nand oil were also greatly reduced. The following articles nominally\r\nconcerned both nations, but in practice applied almost entirely to\r\nBritish imports into France. Hardware, cutlery, and similar goods were\r\nnot to pay more than 10 per cent.; cottons, woollens, muslins, lawns,\r\ncambrics, and most kinds of gauzes, not more than 12 per cent.; but\r\nsilks, or articles partly silken, were prohibited as formerly. Linens\r\nwere reciprocally to be charged at no higher rates than those levied\r\non Dutch linens imported into Ireland, that is, at “the most favoured\r\nnation” rates. Sadlery, porcelain, pottery, and glass of all kinds,\r\nwere to pay no more than 12 per cent. The highest impost retained was\r\n30 per cent., levied on beer, perhaps because the interchange of that\r\nproduct was certain to be small. Countervailing duties might, however,\r\nbe placed on certain articles. In the concluding forty articles of\r\nthe treaty (one of the longest and most complex ever signed), the\r\ncontracting Powers sought to lay down principles or regulations for\r\nthe avoidance of disputes with respect to contraband and prohibited\r\ngoods, smuggling, privateering, the suppression of piracy, and other\r\nsubjects. They also left themselves free to revise the treaty at the\r\nend of twelve years. It is noteworthy that each of the contracting\r\nPowers affirmed the principle of seizing and confiscating the goods of\r\nthe other Power when found on an enemy’s merchantman, provided that\r\nthey were embarked after the declaration of war.[494]\r\n\r\nThe treaty disappointed the hopes of some enthusiasts, who hoped that\r\nit might include some proviso for arbitration. Among these was William\r\nPulteney, who, on 14th September, wrote to Pitt in terms that deserve\r\nto be remembered. After pointing out the futility of prohibitive\r\nedicts, he continued:\r\n\r\n    It is to be considered whether this is not a good opportunity to\r\n    ingraft upon this treaty some arrangement that may effectually\r\n    tend to prevent future wars at least for a considerable time.\r\n    Why may not two nations adopt, what individuals often adopt\r\n    who have dealings that may lead to disputes, the measure of\r\n    agreeing beforehand that in case any differences shall happen\r\n    which they cannot settle amicably, the question shall be referred\r\n    to arbitration. The matter in dispute is seldom of much real\r\n    consequence, but the point of honour prevents either party from\r\n    yielding, but if it is decided by third parties, each may be\r\n    contented. The arbitrators should not be sovereign princes; but\r\n    might not each nation name three judges, either of their own courts\r\n    of law, or of any other country, out of whom the opposite nation\r\n    should choose one, and these two hear the question and either\r\n    determine it or name an umpire--the whole proceedings to be in\r\n    writing? This would occasion the matter to be better discussed than\r\n    is commonly done, and would give time for the parties to cool and\r\n    most probably reconcile them to the decision, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\n    It has frequently occurred to my mind that, if France and England\r\n    understood each other, the world might be kept in peace from one\r\n    end of the globe to the other. And why may they not understand\r\n    each other? I allow that France is the most intriguing nation upon\r\n    earth; that they are restless and faithless; but is it impossible\r\n    to show them that every object of their intrigue may be better\r\n    assured by good faith and a proper intelligence with us, and might\r\n    we not arrange everything together now so as completely to satisfy\r\n    both?...[495]\r\n\r\nPitt, we may note, had sought to take a first step towards the\r\nlimitation of armaments, by suggesting that the two Powers should\r\nlessen their squadrons in the East Indies; but to this Vergennes, on\r\n1st April 1786, refused his assent.[496] Seeing, too, that France\r\nwas pressing on the works at Cherbourg, and forming an East India\r\nCompany on a great scale, Pitt naturally restricted his aims to the\r\nestablishment of friendly commercial relations. The progress made in\r\nthis respect was immense. Powers recently at war had never before\r\nsigned a treaty containing provisions of so wide a scope, and so\r\nintimate a character; and lovers of peace hailed it as inaugurating a\r\nnew era of goodwill. “People in general,” wrote the Duke of Dorset,\r\nfrom London, to Mr. Eden, “are very much pleased with your treaty: the\r\nprincipal merchants in the City don’t choose to give an opinion about\r\nit; anything, if novel, is apt to stupify merchants.... I never saw\r\nthe King in such spirits: they rise in proportion to the stocks, which\r\nare beyond the sanguine expectations of everybody.”[497] The rise in\r\nConsols gave the verdict of the City in unmistakable terms, and it was\r\ngenerally endorsed. On 20th November the Marquis of Buckingham wrote:\r\n“My accounts are that all manufacturers are run wild in speculation.\r\nOur wool has felt it already.”[498] A few cranks like Lord George\r\nGordon declaimed against Pitt for selling his country to the French,\r\nbut the majority of thinking men, even in the Chamber of Manufacturers,\r\nthankfully accepted the treaty. A Glasgow manufacturer wrote to Eden\r\nthat Great Britain, having the best wool, the best iron, the best\r\nclays for pottery, the best coal, and by far the best machinery in the\r\nworld, would soon beat the French in their own market.[499] This was\r\nthe general opinion. Those who held it said nothing, but set to work\r\nto regain in France herself the market of which she had deprived us\r\nin America. The state of Great Britain and of France in the year 1789\r\nshowed which were the more durable, the triumphs of war or of peace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was some opposition in the House of Commons. Early\r\nin the session of 1787, Fox brought forward the question of the treaty\r\nand pressed for delay, so that the feeling of the country might be\r\nascertained. To this Pitt demurred, on the ground that members had\r\nhad ample time to consider the questions at issue, and that trade\r\nwould suffer from the continuance of the present uncertainty. The\r\narts which had undermined Pitt’s compact with Ireland were now once\r\nmore practised. Burke twitted the Prime Minister with looking on the\r\naffairs of two great nations in a counting-house spirit; and the\r\nChamber of Manufacturers, in which opinions were divided, sought to\r\nfrighten members by a petition setting forth “the serious and awful\r\nimportance of the treaty ... comprehending a prodigious change in\r\nthe commercial system of this country.”[500] This stage thunder was\r\nspeedily divested of its terrors by Pitt pointing out that four months\r\nhad elapsed since the signing of the treaty, and yet the Chamber of\r\nManufacturers had remained silent until that day (12th February). After\r\nshowing that neither our old ally, Portugal, nor our manufacturers had\r\ncause for alarm, Pitt raised the question to a high level in a passage\r\nwhich furnished a dignified retort both to the gibe of Burke, and to\r\nthose who denounced trade with our traditional enemy: “To suppose,”\r\nhe said, “that any nation can be unalterably the enemy of another is\r\nweak and childish. It has its foundation neither in the experience of\r\nnations nor in the history of man. It is a libel on the constitution of\r\npolitical societies, and supposes the existence of diabolical malice\r\nin the original frame of man.” Then, coming once more to practical\r\nconsiderations, he affirmed that, though the treaty was advantageous to\r\nFrance, it would be more so to us.[501]\r\n\r\nIn reply, Fox made one of the worst speeches of his career. He asserted\r\ntwice over that France was the natural enemy of this land, owing to\r\nher overweening pride and boundless ambition; and that by means of the\r\npresent treaty she sought to tie our hands and prevent us engaging in\r\nany alliances with foreign powers. Portugal, he said, was now made a\r\nsacrifice and peace-offering to France. The House refused to follow the\r\nvagaries of the Whig leader by 258 votes to 118; and the provisions of\r\nthe treaty were passed in Committee by substantial majorities within\r\na fortnight. The treaty passed the Lords on 6th March by 74 votes to\r\n24.[502] In due course the treaty was ratified, and the ports on both\r\nsides of the Channel were opened to free commercial intercourse on 10th\r\nMay 1787.\r\n\r\nPitt undoubtedly erred in proclaiming his conviction that the treaty\r\nwas more advantageous to Great Britain than to France. He clinched\r\nhis triumph in Parliament, but he imperilled the treaty; and it is\r\nnoteworthy that he made that statement after Eden had warned him not\r\nto do so.[503] It was a weakness of which he was rarely guilty. The\r\nFrench negotiators had often pointed out that they were running a great\r\nrisk of inflicting much harm on their industries. This was sober truth.\r\nIndeed, their general acquiescence in Pitt’s requests has always been\r\na puzzle; for the belief of Vergennes in Free Trade was not shared by\r\nthe other Ministers, except perhaps by Calonne; and it was certain that\r\nthe manufacturers of Rouen, Amiens, and Lille would cry out against the\r\nsudden change from prohibition to a 12 per cent. duty on textiles.\r\n\r\nDaniel Hailes set himself to solve the riddle for the satisfaction of\r\nthe ever distrustful Carmarthen, who, on 29th September 1786, wrote\r\nto him privately: “our suspicions of the good faith and friendly\r\nprofessions of France in political matters ought to be in exact\r\nproportion to the facility she may have evinced upon matters purely\r\ncommercial.” He further suggested that her aim was perhaps to sever our\r\ngood relations with States with which we had political and commercial\r\nties.[504] Hailes, doubtless taking his cue from his chief, thereupon\r\nsought to find out the motives which had influenced the French\r\nMinistry, and summed up his conclusions in a long report. It gives an\r\ninteresting but somewhat jaundiced account of affairs in that very\r\ncritical year 1786--the year of the Diamond Necklace scandal and of the\r\ndecision to convoke the Chamber of Notables for the rectification of\r\nabuses too deep-seated for Louis XVI to uproot. The report is too long\r\nto quote here except in its most important passage; but we may glance\r\nat its salient features. Hailes pointed out that France suffered nearly\r\nas much as England from the late war, which left her with a National\r\nDebt almost exactly equal to that of her rival; also that the hopes of\r\nFrenchmen to gain the trade of the United States had been blighted. The\r\nCourt of Versailles had, moreover, not exercised “the wise management\r\nof venality and the œconomy of corruption and favor” which would\r\nhave satisfied most of the privileged classes. Its partiality was as\r\nnotorious as its extravagance; and the failure of the old commercial\r\nprohibitive system, as also of the recent prohibitive _arrêts_, was\r\nprobably due to the corruption prevalent in Court and official circles;\r\nfor, to quote Hailes’s words:\r\n\r\n    Every one having credit enough with the great, or the mistresses of\r\n    the great, to procure an exemption, would not have failed to apply\r\n    for it in favour of some dependent or other. It seems therefore\r\n    probable that the French Government felt its own inability to give\r\n    effect to its prohibitory laws against the importation of British\r\n    manufactures, and in that respect, at all events, they may be said\r\n    to have been gainers by the treaty.\r\n\r\n    But I think I can take upon me to assure your Lordship that there\r\n    exists another and no less principal cause of the eagerness of\r\n    France to conclude the commercial arrangement. I mean that of the\r\n    immediate relief of the _Trésor Royal_ by the increase of the\r\n    Revenue, an increase which, it may be presumed, will prove immense,\r\n    from the sudden influx of all sorts of British merchandise paying\r\n    the legal duties, as soon as the Treaty shall take effect. If this\r\n    opinion should prove to be well grounded (and from the attention\r\n    which I have paid to the late conduct of the Comptroller General\r\n    [Calonne] I am much inclined to think it is) it will be a strong\r\n    mark of the corruption of that Minister, who sacrifices to an\r\n    immediate and temporary resource the dearest interests of his\r\n    country.[505]\r\n\r\nWe need not lay much stress on the personal arguments here adduced;\r\nfor Hailes may have been unduly influenced by the partisans of Necker\r\nor Breteuil, who were always at feud with Calonne. It is probable that\r\nVergennes and Calonne were swayed by a deeper motive, namely, the\r\ndesire to keep England quiet and friendly while they laid their schemes\r\nwith a view to the ascendency of France in the Dutch affairs soon to\r\nbe described, and thereafter to the combination of their efforts for\r\nthe overthrow of British power in the East. Such an aim is consonant\r\nwith the philosophic thoroughness of the character of Vergennes and\r\nthe ambition of his showy colleague. Whether Pitt suspected some such\r\ndesign is uncertain; that Carmarthen did so can admit of no doubt.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, may be said for Hailes’s views. It is generally admitted\r\nthat the prodigal Calonne sacrificed very much in order to stand\r\nwell with the Queen’s party, and that his ardent desire was to put\r\na good face on things at the time of the Assembly of the Notables\r\nearly in 1787. There was every reason for his concern. The future of\r\nFrance depended on the docility of the Notables. If they were so far\r\nsatisfied with the state of affairs as to pass the reforms desired\r\nby the King and Vergennes, the crisis which led up to the Revolution\r\nmight have ended peacefully. Unjust taxation, constant deficits, and\r\nnational bankruptcy were among the chief causes of the Revolution. Of\r\ncourse, Vergennes and Calonne could not foresee events; but they knew\r\nthat the future was gloomy in the extreme unless the Notables induced\r\nthe privileged classes to take up their fair share of the financial\r\nburdens. If Ministers were able to point to increased customs returns,\r\nthe decline of smuggling, and the cementing of friendly relations with\r\nEngland, the Notables and the nobles at large might prove amenable to\r\nreason (for Anglomania was still the fashion); and all might yet go\r\nwell. In these considerations probably lies the key to the conduct\r\nof the French Ministry in the later stages of the negotiation of\r\n1786. With Vergennes the treaty was probably a matter of principle;\r\nto Calonne it was a device adopted in the course of that daring game\r\nof “neck or nothing,” on which he staked the destinies of France.\r\nThough he was the chief sinner, Government and people alike behaved\r\nwith incredible levity. Alvensleben, reporting on the situation at\r\nVersailles in November 1787, said: “Everything here is a matter of\r\nceremony, clothes, varnish, phrases, national boasting, tinsel,\r\nintrigues; and everything is finally decided by forms.”[506]\r\n\r\nThis scathing report was written after France had lost her one able\r\nstatesman. Vergennes died shortly before the Notables assembled;\r\nand they, having to deal with an irresolute King and a political\r\ngamester, turned a deaf ear to counsels of Reform. Probably, too,\r\nthey were influenced by the outcry against the commercial treaty,\r\nfor it was general in all manufacturing centres, and did not pass\r\naway, as was the case in Great Britain. The Rouen Chamber of Commerce\r\ninstituted an inquiry, the outcome of which was a report affirming\r\nthe marked superiority of British textile goods to those of France,\r\nand the impossibility of competing with them on the basis of the 12\r\nper cent. duty. An able writer, Dupont de Nemours, gave an effective\r\nanswer to the report; but, as generally happens in such cases, the\r\ndefence attracted less attention than the attack.[507] We must\r\nfurther remember that merchants who lived under an oppressive system\r\nof taxation had every possible reason for “crying poor.” Complaints\r\nagainst the commercial treaty were hurled at Arthur Young in every\r\nFrench manufacturing town which he visited in his tours of 1787 and\r\n1788. Abbeville, Amiens, Lille, and Lyons declared against it in\r\nvarying tones of anger or despair; the wine districts alone were loud\r\nin its praise.[508] Undoubtedly the French textile industries suffered\r\nseverely for a time. The taste for English goods continued to depress\r\nhome products, and that, too, despite the efforts of Marie Antoinette\r\nto set the fashion for the latter. In 1788 as many as 5,442 looms were\r\nidle in Lyons; but it is to be observed that this crisis was due either\r\nto the continued smuggling of English silk goods, to the preference for\r\nour fine cottons, or to the failure of the silk harvest in that year.\r\nThe last cause was probably the most important.[509] The woollen and\r\ncotton trades alone could have been directly affected by the treaty. In\r\nthem the conditions were undoubtedly bad in the years 1787, 1788. At\r\nTroyes 443 looms were not worked out of 2,600, and that proportion was\r\nusual throughout the east and north of France.\r\n\r\nM. Levasseur, however, who has carefully investigated the causes of\r\nthis crisis, attributes it largely to the utter prostration of public\r\ncredit in France, and the issue of a coinage of doubtful value. The bad\r\nharvest of 1788, followed by a terribly cold winter, also intensified\r\nthe distress. He concludes that, even so, the commercial treaty might\r\nultimately have been advantageous to certain parts of the industrial\r\neconomy of France; but it was applied suddenly in a time of political\r\nunsettlement and general distress.[510]\r\n\r\nWe must also remember that Calonne had for many months been squandering\r\nthe resources of France. In accordance with his motto: “In order to\r\nestablish public credit one must cultivate luxury,” he had raised\r\nloan upon loan in time of peace, and it has been estimated that in\r\nthe forty-one months of his term of office (1783–87) he borrowed\r\n650,000,000 francs (£26,000,000).[511] No fiscal experiment can have a\r\nfair chance under such conditions; and it is therefore a violation of\r\nthe laws of evidence to assert that the Commercial Treaty of 1786 was\r\nthe chief cause of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nSumming up the facts concerning this most interesting treaty, we may\r\nconclude that the honour of originating it undoubtedly belongs firstly\r\nto Vergennes, secondly to Shelburne, and only in the third place to\r\nPitt. It is clear that the French statesman worked steadily for it\r\nduring the negotiations of 1783, and used all available means to bring\r\nit about even while Pitt showed no responsive desire. As has been shown\r\nabove, the young Prime Minister had good reasons for not taking the\r\nmatter up seriously until the autumn of 1785. Indeed it would have\r\nbeen a tactical mistake to press on the commercial compact with France\r\nuntil he had put forth every effort to unite Ireland with Great Britain\r\nby intimate trade relations. When those endeavours were frustrated\r\nby ignorance and faction, he turned towards France, but slowly and\r\nsuspiciously. Not until the negotiation was far advanced did he show\r\nmuch eagerness on the subject. But it is the mark of a great Minister\r\nto keep a firm grasp upon colleagues and subordinates at all important\r\npoints; and Pitt saw the futility of Carmarthen’s prejudices no less\r\nthan the possible danger of Eden’s Gallophile enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe hostile actions of the French agents in Holland, to which we must\r\nsoon recur, made him cautious on matters purely political; and, while\r\npushing on the commercial treaty, which Carmarthen looked on as a trap,\r\nhe took care to subject the ardent fancies of Eden to cold douches\r\nlike the following: “Though in the commercial business I think there\r\nare reasons for believing the French may be sincere, I cannot listen\r\nwithout suspicion to their professions of political friendship.”[512]\r\nAs we shall see in the next chapters, Pitt generally treated with\r\nwholesome scepticism the alarmist news sent by Harris from The Hague.\r\nBut the tidings from that quarter enabled Pitt to assess at their due\r\nvalue the philanthropic professions of the _salons_ of Paris. Not that\r\nhe was indifferent to the golden hopes of that age. After the treaty\r\nwas signed he gave expression to his hopes in words pulsating with a\r\nnoble enthusiasm; but, while it was under discussion, he showed the\r\nbalance of mind and keenness in bargaining which characterize a great\r\nstatesman. We may also remark here that Pitt sought earnestly to bring\r\nabout a favourable commercial treaty with Spain and Russia, but failed.\r\nThe Czarina showed her hostility by granting to France a treaty on the\r\nbasis of the most favoured nation.[513]\r\n\r\nFinally, we may hazard the conjecture that, if the finances of France\r\nhad received from the Court of Versailles and Calonne a tithe of the\r\nfostering care which Pitt bestowed on those of Great Britain, both\r\ncountries would have profited equally from the free commercial and\r\nsocial intercourse inaugurated by this memorable compact. As it was,\r\nFrance slid fast down the slope that led to the chasm of Revolution;\r\nand in the midst of that catastrophe Robespierre and his followers, who\r\nrepresented the prejudices of the northern manufacturing towns, spread\r\nabroad the spiteful falsehood that Pitt’s commercial policy had ever\r\nbeen aimed at the financial ruin of the French nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH CRISIS\r\n\r\n(1786, 1787)\r\n\r\n    If we lose the Netherlands, France will acquire what she has always\r\n    considered as the climax of her power.--SIR JAMES HARRIS, 1st May,\r\n    1787.\r\n\r\n    His Majesty wishes only the preservation of the independence\r\n    and true constitution of the [Dutch] Republic.--THE MARQUIS OF\r\n    CARMARTHEN, 29th June, 1787 (B. M. Add. MSS., 35539).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have interrupted our survey of Pitt’s foreign policy in order\r\nto present a connected account of that interesting episode, the\r\ncommercial treaty with France. But this event took place in a year\r\nwhich witnessed the growth of a crisis so serious as to threaten\r\nruin to that constructive effort. The crisis arose from the sharp\r\nconflict of interests between Great Britain and France in Dutch\r\naffairs, as described in Chapter XIII. As no adequate account has yet\r\nappeared in English on this question, I propose to treat it on a scale\r\nproportionate to its importance.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that the feuds between the Patriots, abetted\r\nby France and the Stadholder’s party, had already aroused keen interest\r\nat London and Paris; that our able envoy, Harris, had bravely waged\r\nan unequal campaign for the Prince and Princess of Orange--unequal,\r\nbecause Pitt persistently forbade him to commit this country to the\r\ndefence of their cause, though sentiment and policy linked it to that\r\nof England. Further, the general situation of the Powers then seemed\r\nirretrievably to doom the Prince’s fortunes. Frederick the Great, in\r\nhis desire to keep on good terms with France, refused to help his\r\nniece, Wilhelmina, Princess of Orange. Austria was allied with France,\r\nand Russia with Austria. Finally, neither Pitt nor the Marquis of\r\nCarmarthen deemed it possible to frame an alliance with Prussia; and\r\nall the advances which they made to the Czarina, Catharine II, and the\r\nEmperor Joseph II, were coldly repelled. In fact, no Power cared for\r\nan alliance with England. The conclusion of the Franco-Dutch alliance\r\nof November 1785 seemed to close all doors against her. When the\r\nfortunes of a State have been on the decline, it is very hard to stop\r\nthe downward movement. That was the position of Great Britain early in\r\nthe year 1786.\r\n\r\nThe only sources of hope seemed to be in the imminence of the death of\r\nFrederick and in the outrageous actions of the Dutch Patriots. Their\r\nviolent support of provincial rights and hatred of the Stadholder\r\nand his mildly centralizing policy were carried to strange lengths.\r\nThe Estates of Holland decreed that no Orange songs were to be sung,\r\nand no Orange colours worn. Harris relates that a woman came near\r\nto be hanged for the latter offence. Even the vendor of carrots was\r\nsuspect unless he left the roots in a protective coating of soil. To\r\na home-loving people like the Dutch these pedantries became ever more\r\nhateful. The bovine character of the Stadholder was to some extent a\r\nsafeguard; for who could reasonably claim that his colossal powers of\r\ninaction would ever be a danger to the Republic? It is fairly certain\r\nthat he had the allegiance of the rural population everywhere, even\r\nin the Province of Holland; but the populace of the large towns was\r\noverwhelmingly on the side of the Patriots; and the Estates of Holland\r\n(a province which contained more than half the population, and more\r\nthan half the wealth, of the whole Union) decidedly opposed him.[514]\r\nOf the smaller provinces, Guelderland, Zealand, and Friesland supported\r\nthe Stadholder. Utrecht was torn with schism on this subject, the rural\r\ndistricts cleaving to him, while the city of Utrecht broke away, and\r\ndefied his authority. As Pitt forbade Harris to take any step which\r\nwould commit England to the defence of the Stadholder, that envoy\r\ncontinued to play an apparently hopeless game. But his skill, resource,\r\nhis commanding personality, and occasional bribes, enabled him to\r\ncontinue the struggle, even in democratic Holland. His great difficulty\r\nwas that France in April 1786 had let it be known that she would allow\r\nno other Power to interfere in Dutch affairs, and would forcibly oppose\r\nany such attempt. To strive against the Patriots while they had a\r\nground of confidence utterly denied to their opponents, was to condemn\r\nHarris to struggle against great odds, and never has an unequal fight\r\nbeen more gallantly fought. The worst symptom was the rise of bodies\r\nof armed burghers, styled Free Corps, which soon attained considerable\r\nstrength. Encouraged by success, the Patriots sought to depose William\r\nV outright, and proclaimed the Princess Regent during the minority of\r\nher son. She rejected this scheme with indignation. Failing here, they\r\nstruck at the authority of the Prince by procuring from the Estates of\r\nHolland his deposition from the command of the regular troops of that\r\nprovince. This blow could not be parried; and it dealt consternation\r\namong the loyalists.\r\n\r\nThere was no hope of help from Frederick the Great. For the reasons\r\npreviously stated he had hardened his heart against all the appeals\r\nthat came from the Princess of Orange; and she finally rejected with\r\nscorn his advice that she should come to terms with the Patriots and\r\nFrance. On 16th May 1786 Harris summed up the relations of Prussia to\r\nFrance and Holland in this sprightly way:\r\n\r\n“Prussia says to France ‘Do what you please in Holland, but leave\r\nat least the appearance of a Stadholderian Government.’--France\r\nreplies--‘We shall lose the confidence and support of the Patriots\r\nand with it our whole influence in the Republic if we mention the\r\nword “Stadholder”; take from us the odium of the measure by declaring\r\nyou cannot see him deposed. We then may, without displeasing our\r\nfriends, espouse his cause to a certain degree, and we shall both be\r\nsatisfied.’”[515]\r\n\r\nWhile the welter was ever increasing in this once prosperous land,\r\nthere came a gleam of hope from the East. On 17th August 1786 Frederick\r\nthe Great was gathered to his fathers, and his nephew Frederick\r\nWilliam II reigned in his stead. As Prince Royal he had spoken warmly\r\nof his resolve to right the wrongs of his sister, the Princess of\r\nOrange; but as King he disappointed her hopes. His character was\r\ndespicable. Extravagance and dissipation were accountable for private\r\ndebts amounting to one million sterling at the time of his accession\r\nand soon after to three-quarters of a million more.[516] But his\r\nirresolution was of more serious consequence. A vicious man may excel\r\nas a ruler; an unstable man, never. Frederick William had scarcely a\r\nfeature in common with the masterful race of the Hohenzollerns. The\r\ncontrast between him and his uncle was startling. In place of that\r\nsilent, cynical, and dogged ruler, Berlin and Sans-Souci rejoiced\r\nin a handsome, affable monarch, who seemed made to win the hearts\r\nof all at first sight and to lose them on closer acquaintance. For\r\nit was found that with him work and policy depended on whims and\r\nmoods. Swaying to and fro between energy and sloth, violence and\r\ntimidity, he disconcerted his Ministers, until they came to see that\r\nthe King’s resolves were as fleeting as his feelings. After the\r\nfirst flush of activity wore away, languor pervaded every bureau of\r\nthat centralized autocracy. On 6th January 1787 Lord Dalrymple, our\r\nambassador at Berlin, wrote of the King: “in general he appears very\r\nindifferent about what is passing”; and he further reported that he\r\nurgently desired to “get rid of so irksome an affair” as his sister’s\r\ntroubles, and looked on the Prince of Orange as the chief cause of\r\nthe dissensions in the Dutch Netherlands.[517] Another of our envoys,\r\nwith more wit than is usually found in semi-official letters, summed\r\nup the difference between Frederick the Great and Frederick William II\r\nby saying that the former had the wisdom of Solomon, but the latter\r\nresembled that potentate only in respect of his overflowing harem.\r\nMirabeau’s opinion on the imminent downfall of the Prussian State is\r\ntoo well known to need quoting here.\r\n\r\nYet the nonchalance of Frederick William in foreign affairs is not\r\nwholly indefensible. Confronted by the alliance of those scheming\r\nand unscrupulous rulers, Catharine II and Joseph II, he could effect\r\nlittle until he had the friendship of one at least of the Great\r\nPowers; but France was pledged to Austria, and England was still\r\naverse from a Prussian alliance. On 20th October 1786 Dalrymple thus\r\nsummed up his arguments against a compact with the Court of Berlin:\r\n“We might indeed form a temporary co-operation with Prussia for some\r\nparticular purposes, as at present in the case of Holland, where\r\nlittle or no opposition is to be expected from the two Imperial\r\nCourts; but to enter into a general and permanent system with Prussia\r\nalone, without the concurrence of other Powers, would be a measure,\r\nin my apprehension, perfectly frantic, and only to be justified by a\r\ncombination similar to that in 1756 being formed against us.” Four\r\ndays later, after an interview with Hertzberg, Dalrymple wrote that\r\na Northern League between us and the Baltic Powers was out of the\r\nquestion during the lifetime of the Czarina, seeing that Turkish\r\nschemes stood first in her thoughts, and these implied alliance with\r\nJoseph.[518] As will shortly appear, the knowledge which the Turks had\r\nof these schemes was to lead to the Eastern War of 1787, which ended\r\nthe suspense besetting Prussia and England.\r\n\r\nFor the present the isolation of these States left them in a most\r\nprecarious position. The utmost they could hope for was to struggle on,\r\nwaiting for a turn of Fortune’s wheel in their favour. The first aim of\r\nthe Court of Berlin was to thwart the Austrian scheme for exchanging\r\nthe Belgic provinces for Bavaria. Joseph II still pursued this phantom,\r\nthough he had his hands full in Brabant, where philosophism had again\r\nstirred up revolt, and his alliance with Catharine portended war with\r\nthe resentful Turks. Frederick William believed, and perhaps rightly,\r\nthat so long as the Austro-Russian alliance held good, Prussia could\r\ntake no step Rhinewards. He therefore saw in the entreaties of his\r\nsister only a scheme to draw him into fatal courses; and when the\r\nentreaties became reproaches his answers became few and cold.[519]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, too, the influence of the veteran diplomatist,\r\nHertzberg, was waning, because of an austere and somewhat superior\r\nmanner which the young King resented. That Minister favoured a close\r\nunderstanding with England with a view to joint action at The Hague;\r\nbut there was associated with him at the Foreign Ministry a colleague,\r\nCount Finckenstein, who strongly inclined towards France, thwarted\r\nHertzberg’s efforts, and prejudiced the King against an English\r\nalliance.[520] To add to the perplexities of the time, Thulemeyer, the\r\nPrussian envoy at The Hague, supported France; and Harris suspected\r\nhim, perhaps rightly, of having been bought over by the Patriots and\r\ntheir paymasters. He certainly thwarted the efforts of Görtz, a special\r\nenvoy sent from Berlin to The Hague; and finally the Princess of Orange\r\nbegged her brother, seeing that he would not help her, at least not to\r\nallow Thulemeyer to act in concert with De Vérac, the French envoy at\r\nThe Hague.[521] Early in May she sent a request for a loan of Prussian\r\ncannon in order to withstand the growing forces of the Patriots, but\r\nmet with a refusal.\r\n\r\nMatters, however, now took a turn for the better for that unfortunate\r\nPrincess. Latterly the Court of Berlin had sought to arrange with that\r\nof Versailles a plan of joint intervention so as to end the strifes\r\nin the United Provinces in a way not too derogatory to the Prince of\r\nOrange. But this proposal was accompanied by conditions which were at\r\nonce very tartly rejected by the Court of Versailles. This refusal of a\r\nfriendly overture was to have far-reaching results, for the irritation\r\nof the Prussian monarch now led him to favour the idea of intervention\r\nin Holland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis brief survey will have enabled us to understand the gradual\r\ndevelopment of Pitt’s policy from strict neutrality to tentative and\r\ncautious activity. The change of attitude will be found to correspond\r\nclosely with a change in Continental affairs which enabled him with\r\nlittle risk to raise his country once more to her rightful position.\r\n\r\nIt is the mark of a great statesman to keep his gaze on all the chief\r\nmatters of public interest, to weigh their importance, and to make\r\nhis policy the resultant, as it were, of the leading forces and best\r\ntendencies of his age. No one who has not a clear vision and ripe\r\njudgement can give such an assessment and act on it with tact and\r\nfirmness. Small minds are certain to be diverted towards side issues\r\nand hastily to take up questions which are unripe for solution. From\r\nthese faults Pitt’s singular maturity of mind and steadiness of purpose\r\nkept him free. He saw that the greatest of British interests was peace;\r\nand, despite the pressing claims of Harris at The Hague, he refused to\r\nbe drawn blindfold into the irritating and obscure questions there\r\nat stake. True, it was important to keep the United Provinces from\r\nbecoming dependent on France; but he believed that the efforts of the\r\nPatriots in that direction might be curbed by means of diplomacy. No\r\nstatesman prefers a warlike to a peaceful solution unless all the\r\nresources of his own craft have been exhausted, least of all could the\r\nchampion of economy, who naturally discounted the clamorous appeals of\r\nHarris for help.\r\n\r\nThere were reasons why our envoy should urge Pitt to adopt a more\r\nforward policy. In the autumn of 1786 the fortunes of the Stadholder\r\nsteadily declined, and the raids of the Patriots on his prerogatives\r\nbecame more daring and successful. In September, as we saw, he was\r\ndeprived of the command of the regular forces in the Province of\r\nHolland. His opponents, the Patriots, next strengthened their Free\r\nCorps, drew a cordon of troops along the frontiers of Holland, and\r\noverthrew his authority in the hitherto loyal provinces, Overyssel and\r\nGroningen. The city of Utrecht also defied him and elected Estates,\r\nwhile those of the still loyal Province of Utrecht assembled at\r\nAmersfoort. Other towns, even in the loyal provinces, seemed likely\r\nto follow the example of Utrecht. In face of these facts the appeals\r\nof Harris for help became more urgent than ever. On 24th October he\r\nwrote privately to Carmarthen: “As we are afraid to threaten, we must\r\neither bribe or give up the game.”[522] But, realizing more and more\r\nthat the obstacle to his forward policy lay in the peaceful resolves\r\nof Pitt, he wrote directly to him on 28th November, pointing out that\r\nFrance was making amazing strides everywhere at our expense, that she\r\nwas on the point of gaining complete control over the United Provinces,\r\nand he hinted that that accession to her naval strength and to her\r\nresources in the East Indies would enable her soon to attack England in\r\noverwhelming strength.\r\n\r\nMuch could be said in favour of this view. The activity of France in\r\nthe East, as we saw in the last chapter, had been very threatening,\r\nand it is clear that the schemes of St. Priest and other French agents\r\nin Egypt pointed out the path on which Bonaparte set forth with heroic\r\nstride thirteen years later. Dreams of a French Empire in the East\r\nhaunted many minds at Paris in 1786. On 7th September, shortly before\r\nthe signature of the Anglo-French commercial treaty, Hailes, Secretary\r\nof Legation at Paris, reported that the French Government seemed to\r\nbe preparing for “the entire subversion” of British power in India;\r\nand he cynically added that when the time for action came, “then, as\r\nformerly, the rights of mankind will be held out as the pretext.”[523]\r\nEven Eden sent word that there was talk of a design that France should\r\ngain control over all the Dutch ports in the East Indies.[524] When we\r\nremember that the Cape of Good Hope was a Dutch possession, and that\r\nthe British lands in India were scattered and weak, we can appreciate\r\nthe gravity of the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe surmises of Hailes and Eden were correct. There was a powerful\r\nparty at the French Court which worked in alliance with the Dutch\r\nPatriots for the control of the East Indies. They saw their opportunity\r\nin the bankruptcy then threatening the Dutch East India Company; and\r\nin the winter of 1786 the Patriot leader, the Rhinegrave of Salm, sent\r\nto the Cabinet of Versailles a plan of a Franco-Dutch alliance with\r\na view to the overthrow of the British power in India. Thanks to the\r\npacific views of Louis XVI and Vergennes, nothing came of the scheme;\r\nbut the Patriots then changed front and offered to hand over to France\r\nthe important naval station, Trincomalee, in the north-east of Ceylon,\r\nto serve as a place of arms for France in case of war. This plan had\r\na favourable reception at Versailles, some of the Ministers urging\r\nthat 18,000 troops should be sent out under the command of General de\r\nBouillé. This soldier (the hero of Carlyle’s stirring account of the\r\nMutiny of Nancy in 1790) states in his Memoirs[525] that he remained\r\nsome time at Paris in hopes of receiving the order for the conquest\r\nof the British settlements in India; but he remained in vain; for the\r\nFrench Cabinet _found no opportunity for going to war_. The events now\r\nto be described will explain the sorry ending to these golden hopes;\r\nand the reader will bear in mind that the struggle of the rival Powers\r\nfor ascendancy in Holland concerned the fate of Britain’s Indian Empire\r\nno less than her position in Europe.[526]\r\n\r\nAll the more astonishing, then, is the calmness of Pitt’s reply to\r\nHarris of 5th December 1786. In it he directed him to do all in his\r\npower to keep together the Orange party, so that it might “act with\r\nadvantage, both for their own country and for us, on some future day,\r\nif it should arrive.” For the present, however, that party must “lie\r\nby,” and avoid pushing things to an extremity which would commit both\r\nthemselves and England.[527]\r\n\r\nThis cautious policy was perhaps in some measure due to the King,\r\nwho strongly opposed a forward policy in the Netherlands. His chief\r\npreoccupation in the years 1786, 1787, was the extravagance of the\r\nPrince of Wales and the rapidly increasing expense of his own family,\r\nto which he refers in pathetic terms. The news of the activity of Sir\r\nJames Harris at The Hague “much affected” him; and when, on 7th January\r\n1787, Lord Carmarthen wrote to Windsor in order to suggest a more\r\nenergetic policy in the Netherlands, a sharp retort came, bidding that\r\nMinister remember “the disgraceful conduct” of England in the late war,\r\nand asserting that he (George III) refused to act as the _Draw-can-sir_\r\nof Europe.[528]\r\n\r\nFrom the tenour of the King’s letter to Pitt on 8th January we may\r\ninfer that Carmarthen had kept his overture to Windsor secret; and\r\nPitt, on hearing of it from the King, must have felt piqued at his\r\ncolleague’s action. Already they were on strained terms owing to\r\nPitt having insisted on Carmarthen’s presence at Court, despite\r\nindisposition, in order to present the Portuguese envoy; and a chief\r\nwho demanded so strict an observance of etiquette was certain to resent\r\nany private attempt of his Foreign Minister to influence the King’s\r\nopinions on a far weightier question. There is an apologetic tone in\r\nCarmarthen’s hitherto unpublished letter of 8th January to Pitt. The\r\nfirst sentences refer to his ill health, and are omitted:\r\n\r\n                                               Hendon, Jan. 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    I wish to lay before you _in confidence_ my letter to the King of\r\n    yesterday, together with His Majesty’s answer of this morning’s\r\n    date, which I am free to confess to you has occasioned me a\r\n    considerable degree of uneasiness.... You will, I am sure, do me\r\n    the justice to remark the manner in which I have stated my opinion\r\n    to the King and I have always understood your sentiments to be\r\n    precisely the same in regard to the _object_, though perhaps\r\n    more cautious (from prudential and well founded motives) in the\r\n    means to be employed. I am free to own that, eager as I am for\r\n    preventing France acquiring the absolute command of Holland, I have\r\n    always thought we might succeed by means of private negotiation\r\n    and intrigue. The experiment of trying to combat her with her own\r\n    weapons would have some merit; and, convinced as I am that she\r\n    has reckoned all along upon England not interfering, I think the\r\n    present moment must not be passed by without our endeavouring to\r\n    make the most we can of the Provinces which are opposed to Holland,\r\n    and of the present firmness of the Prince and Princess of Orange.\r\n    _L’Assemblée des Notables_ is I think some security for the pacific\r\n    disposition of France, or rather for her inability of indulging\r\n    any of a contrary nature at present. I should hope we might have a\r\n    meeting on Thursday for the Dutch business.[529]\r\n\r\nThe differences between Pitt and Carmarthen were greater than are here\r\nrepresented; and the joint influence of the King and Pitt prevented the\r\nadoption of the more spirited measures towards which he inclined. This\r\nwas gall and wormwood to Harris. That able envoy, looking on helplessly\r\nat the brilliant diplomatic successes of France, failed to see the\r\ncanker which was eating at her heart. The Assembly of the Notables\r\nwas “the beginning of the end.” It implied the inability of the\r\nabsolute monarchy to carry the urgently needed reforms or to meet the\r\nordinary expenses of the State. Pitt saw this. Further, while Harris\r\nadmitted that he regarded France as “a natural enemy,” Pitt looked on\r\nher as a possible friend. On the Dutch Question alone was there keen\r\nrivalry between the two States; and, in view of the growing financial\r\ndifficulties of France, delay was more than ever advisable; for her\r\nefforts abroad must slacken as her vitality lessened under the load\r\nof debt that Calonne was gaily heaping up. In the meantime, until the\r\nPrussian monarch had the will, and England had the power, to intervene,\r\nHarris must continue his Sisyphus toil, and the Prince and Princess\r\nmust suffer further indignities. Such was Pitt’s policy. To our envoy\r\nit seemed unbearably mean; but it won in the end, and all the more\r\nsurely for the delay. A Minister at the centre can often see things in\r\ntruer perspective than an ambassador who is, after all, only at one\r\npoint on the circumference.\r\n\r\nHarris continued stoutly to roll the stone uphill. He helped to form\r\nan Association of the Provinces, towns and persons opposed to any\r\nchange in the constitution; and, as the Stadholder in the early part of\r\n1787 showed far more spirit and tact, the Patriots found it by no means\r\neasy to push the stone backwards. Harris declared on 20th April 1787\r\nthat the popular indignation ran strongly against the Patriots, who had\r\nnot one-twentieth of the people on their side. This is incredible; but\r\nit is quite certain that his activity and the less determined policy of\r\nMontmorin, the successor of Vergennes at Versailles, put new heart into\r\nthe Stadholder’s party. Nevertheless, the Patriots carried the day at\r\nAmsterdam by sheer audacity, and compelled the Regents, or magistrates,\r\nto dismiss nine of their number. This act of violence, together with\r\nthe increasing activity of William V and the signs of wavering at\r\nVersailles, led Harris to request an interview with Ministers at\r\nWhitehall.[530] He also bore a letter of the Princess to George III,\r\nwhich met with no favourable response.\r\n\r\nA Cabinet meeting was held on 23rd May 1787, at which Harris was\r\npresent, and submitted his opinions to a full discussion. Ministers\r\nmet at Thurlow’s house for dinner; and he in due course launched\r\nforth on the troubled sea of Dutch politics, stating at great length\r\nthe arguments against intervention, then tearing them to pieces, and\r\ndeclaring even for war with France, if the need arose. Richmond, Master\r\nof the Ordnance, called for maps, discussed the military situation, and\r\nurged the need of speedy preparations. Pitt then admitted the immense\r\nimportance of preserving the independence of Holland, and of facing\r\nwar as a possible, but not probable, alternative; then, turning to\r\nHarris, he pressed him to say which course involved the greater risk,\r\nthat of opposing France at once before she entirely dominated the Dutch\r\nNetherlands, or that of awaiting the issue of her present efforts. He\r\nalso asked what kind of help the Orange party most needed. In reply\r\nto this and to similar questions from Thurlow, Harris urged that\r\nmoney should be supplied, especially to the Province of Guelderland;\r\nhe declared that the supporters of the constitution would probably\r\nbe overborne if they were not helped by England; that France was not\r\nin such a condition as to go to war in order to conquer Holland, but\r\nthat when she had the upper hand there she probably would throw\r\ndown the gauntlet. Stafford then declared in favour of intervention.\r\nNevertheless, Pitt held firmly to his conviction, that no case was\r\nyet made out for a course of conduct which might possibly lead to war\r\nand so blight the budding prosperity of Great Britain. Carmarthen and\r\nSydney did not speak. We may plausibly conjecture that the silence of\r\nthe Foreign Minister betokened his disapproval of Pitt’s views and his\r\ninability to controvert them.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can judge, Pitt alone was for complete neutrality.\r\nNevertheless, his view prevailed. An interview which Harris had with\r\nhim on the morrow did not change his sentiments; but, on 26th May, the\r\nCabinet agreed to allow our envoy the sum of £20,000 so as to enable\r\nthe loyal provinces to take into their pay the troops which had been\r\ndisbanded by, or had deserted from, the forces of the Province of\r\nHolland.[531] On 10th June the further sum of £70,000 was advanced.[532]\r\n\r\nPitt’s resolve was doubtless based on the difficulty of gaining an\r\nally, for, as we have seen, the King of Prussia had recently refused\r\nthe request of his sister for a loan of cannon and was proposing to\r\nconcert plans with France for a joint mediation in Dutch affairs.[533]\r\nHow was it possible for England alone to interfere for the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Orange while their natural protector was making advances to\r\ntheir enemy? So little hope was there at present of aid from Prussia\r\nthat on 12th June Carmarthen expressed to Harris his belief that the\r\nOrange party would get more help from the Emperor Joseph than from\r\nFrederick William. The torpor of that party was another depressing\r\nsymptom. Time after time Carmarthen informed Harris that if the\r\nPrince’s supporters desired help, they must bestir themselves: they had\r\nas yet the majority of the regular army and of the States-General on\r\ntheir side; and a fit use of this strength would save the situation.\r\n\r\nDespite the efforts of Harris, the Patriots continued to gain ground.\r\nAt the end of May their partisans wrecked the houses of the Prince’s\r\nfriends at Amsterdam, and crushed the reaction in his favour which\r\nhad gathered head.[534] On 15th June the States-General decided, on\r\nthe casting vote of the President, to admit the deputies sent by the\r\nillegal Estates of the city of Utrecht. This gave a bare majority to\r\nthe Patriots, who then proceeded to deprive the Stadholder of the right\r\nto order the march of troops or the distribution of stores in the\r\nprovinces outside Holland. Four days later, however, Harris was able\r\nto procure the rejection of this decree as illegal; and it was further\r\ndecided that the Estates of Utrecht meeting at Amersfoort were the\r\nlegal Estates of that province and could alone send deputies. Of course\r\nthis change of front has been ascribed to English gold, and certainly\r\nit was due to Harris. This rebuff to the Patriots and the coyness of\r\nthe French Court to their urgent demands for help may have led to the\r\nformation of a resolve which was to end the balancings of statesmen and\r\nthe even pulls of parties. The solution of the Dutch problem was, in\r\nthe first instance, due to a woman’s wit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month of June 1787, the Princess of Orange\r\nframed a plan for leaving her city of refuge, Nymeguen, and proceeding\r\nto The Hague with the aim of inspiring her crestfallen partisans.\r\nHitherto the Orange party had shown the torpor which is the outcome of\r\npoor leadership. Of the Prince of Orange it might have been said, as it\r\nwas said of Louis XVI, that he cooled his friends and heated his foes;\r\nbut his consort had the fire and energy which he lacked. Harris once\r\nconfessed that her frank, blue eyes could be “dangerous”; and in many\r\nways her presence promised to breathe new life into her party.\r\n\r\nAs the journey to The Hague would involve some risk of insult from\r\nthe Free Corps which formed a cordon on the frontier of the Province\r\nof Holland, she proceeded first to Amersfoort, where her consort was\r\nholding together his partisans in the Province of Utrecht, in order\r\nto gain his consent to this daring step. Thereafter she warned Harris\r\nand her chief friends at The Hague of her resolve, and asked their\r\nsanction, adding that the magnitude of the object at stake impelled her\r\nto run some measure of personal risk in order to compass it. Harris\r\nsaw objections to the plan, but yielded to the representations of the\r\nDutchmen. He, however, stated to Carmarthen his doubts whether she\r\ncould make her way through the bodies of armed burghers, and asked his\r\nchief for instructions as to his course of action in case any violence\r\nwere offered to Her Royal Highness.[535]\r\n\r\nHis apprehensions were in part to be realized. The princess set out\r\nfrom Nymeguen on 28th June with the ordinary retinue. While seeking\r\nto enter the Province of Holland near Schoonhoven, she was stopped by\r\na lieutenant commanding a body of Free Corps, who refused to allow\r\nher to proceed; his action was endorsed by the authorities; and she\r\nwas obliged, though without much personal indignity, to put up at the\r\nnearest house where the lieutenant kept her and her ladies-in-waiting\r\nunder close and embarrassing surveillance, until she consented that the\r\nquestion of her journey should be decided by the Estates of Holland.\r\nThen she was allowed to return to Schoonhoven, where she indited\r\nletters to the Grand Pensionary and others, declaring that her sole\r\naim was to promote a reconciliation. The Estates of Holland refused to\r\nallow her to proceed, and she had finally to return to Nymeguen. This\r\ninsult to royalty sent a thrill of indignation through every Court but\r\nthat of Versailles.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the political results of the incident, we may pause\r\nto ask whether the plan of the Princess’s journey was the outcome of\r\nthe fertile brain of Harris. That was the insinuation of the French\r\nForeign Minister, Montmorin, and it has often been repeated.[536] The\r\ncharge has never been proven; and the following reasons may be urged\r\nagainst it. Harris certainly hoped to profit by her presence at The\r\nHague, but obviously he doubted the possibility of her entering the\r\nprovince. Further, on 29th June, when he heard of her detention, he\r\nwrote to Carmarthen: “The event which has happened oversets our whole\r\nplan. Check to the queen, and in a move or two checkmate is, I fear,\r\nthe state of our game.” Not yet did he see that the check might be\r\nworth a Prussian army to the Orange party. All he saw was the present\r\ndiscouragement of that party, and the timidity of the States-General\r\nof the United Provinces, who now refused to censure the outrage.\r\nCarmarthen saw more clearly. “Don’t be so disheartened by a check to\r\nthe queen,” he replied. “Cover her by the knight and all’s safe.... If\r\nthe King, her brother, is not the dirtiest and shabbiest of Kings, he\r\nmust resent it.”[537]\r\n\r\nBut had the Princess throughout laid her plans with a view to such an\r\nevent? In this connection it is significant that Frederick William\r\nof Prussia had latterly shown great irritation against the Court of\r\nVersailles owing to its summary rejection of his offer of a joint\r\nmediation in the Dutch troubles. Montmorin curtly declined every one\r\nof the preliminary terms which Hertzberg had succeeded in appending to\r\nthat proposal. He also blamed the Stadholder for all the ferment, and\r\nstated that, if the Prussian monarch intervened in favour of the Orange\r\nparty, he would “only compromise himself to his entire loss.”[538] This\r\nnagging reply to a friendly overture cut the sensitive monarch to the\r\nquick; he sent a spirited remonstrance, declaimed against the bad faith\r\nof the French Government, and stated that he meant now to complete his\r\nown plans in Holland, that he hoped to have the support of England,\r\nand might draw the sword sooner than was expected.[539] Ewart expected\r\nlittle result from all this; but he was mistaken. Frederick William was\r\na man of sentiment; and the appeal which now came from Holland was one\r\nthat stirred his being to its depths.\r\n\r\nThe Princess, on hearing of his resentment against France, seems to\r\nhave devised a course of action which would be likely to make this\r\nmood lasting. Harris reported on 22nd June that on the day before, “in\r\nconsequence of a courier from Berlin, the Princess of Orange, a few\r\nhours after he arrived, left Nymeguen and set out for Amersfoort. She\r\nhad time to write to nobody, and the cause of this sudden departure is\r\nnot to be guessed at.”[540] The short journey to Amersfoort was for the\r\npurpose described above. That the Princess was acting in close concert\r\nwith her brother, and that Harris knew nothing as to the motives of her\r\nconduct further appear in statements which (strange to say) are omitted\r\nfrom his despatch of 25th June, printed in the “Diaries.” He informed\r\nCarmarthen that she was sending a courier to Berlin, and that the\r\npresent plan “completely does away all the ideas which have been very\r\nprevalent here for these three or four days, that His Prussian Majesty\r\nwas so irritated at the late answer from France as to be decided to\r\nassist the Prince of Orange with men and money.” Obviously the guile\r\nof Sir James Harris was of the diplomatic, not of the feminine, kind.\r\nFurther, the fact that the Princess travelled with a retinue made it\r\nalmost certain that she would be stopped by the cordon of Free Corps\r\non the frontier of Holland. If her chief aim had been to arrive at The\r\nHague, she would have gone in disguise; for only so could she hope to\r\npass through the troops. Her chief aim surely was to be stopped; and\r\nthe more contumeliously, the better for her purpose.\r\n\r\nHer letters written after the incident show that she desired to reap\r\nthe full advantage from it. On 6th July Harris reported her expectation\r\nthat, if England proposed to Prussia a plan for rescuing the Republic\r\nfrom France, it would be well received at Berlin; and that she grounded\r\nher confidence in the reports of those who knew the King of Prussia\r\nwell. Ewart also on 10th July stated that she had written to Berlin in\r\nterms implying that the honour of the King was at stake fully as much\r\nas her own.[541] With these proofs of the discouragement of Harris,\r\nand of the keen insight of the Princess before us, may we not infer\r\nthat she deliberately chose to submit herself to an insult from the\r\nPatriots in order to clinch a resolve which she knew to be forming in\r\nher brother’s mind? His anger against France might then be fanned to a\r\nflame of resentment fed by injured family pride.\r\n\r\nFortunately for her purpose, the Estates of Holland waived aside the\r\ndemand of the King of Prussia for immediate and complete satisfaction\r\nfor the insult; and Frederick William vowed that he would exact\r\nvengeance at the sword’s point. Hertzberg now saw within his reach the\r\ngreat aims which Ewart and he had so long pursued, an Anglo-Prussian\r\ncompact which might ripen into alliance. But it was a task of much\r\ndifficulty to stiffen that monarch’s wavering impulses. Hertzberg\r\nrightly saw that English influence should not at first be pushed;[542]\r\nand only when the King’s resentment at the insult began to cool, were\r\nthe wider questions of the future discreetly opened to his gaze.\r\nHere again the situation was complicated; for Finckenstein worked on\r\nhis fears of an attack from Austria, if he intervened in Holland;\r\nand Thulemeyer, the Prussian envoy at The Hague, darkened the royal\r\ncounsels by sending an official warning that Prussia must expect no\r\nhelp from England, even if France struck at the Prussian expeditionary\r\ncorps. Ewart, however, was able to show that this report closely\r\nresembled an earlier one from the same source. The only result, then,\r\nwas to discredit Thulemeyer and pave the way for his disgrace. When\r\nfurther friendly assurances came from the Pitt Ministry, Frederick\r\nWilliam gave orders for the mustering of 25,000 troops at his fortress\r\nof Wesel on the lower Rhine. Even now he was afflicted by the\r\nirresolution which for so many years was to paralyze the power of his\r\nkingdom; and it is doubtful whether he would have acted at all but for\r\nthe initiative now taken by the Prime Minister of England.[543]\r\n\r\nPitt’s change of attitude at this time is the decisive event of the\r\nsituation. At once, on hearing the news of the insult to the Princess\r\nof Orange, he saw that the time for action had come. In a personal\r\ninterview with Count Lusi, Prussian ambassador at London, he pointed\r\nout that this was a matter which solely concerned the Prussian monarch,\r\nand in which France had no right to interfere.[544] George III spoke in\r\nthe same terms to Lusi at a _levée_. Further, on the receipt of Ewart’s\r\ndespatch of 7th July, reporting that Pitt had declared against any\r\nintervention whatever by Great Britain, Carmarthen sent a sharp denial,\r\nand stated that diplomatic support would have been offered earlier to\r\nPrussia in Dutch affairs, but for the strange conduct of Thulemeyer at\r\nThe Hague. If that conduct did not represent the wishes of the Prussian\r\nGovernment, His Majesty “will be extremely ready to enter into a most\r\nconfidential communication with His Prussian Majesty” on the means of\r\npreserving the independence of the Dutch Republic and the rights of the\r\nStadholder. Carmarthen added the important information that Montmorin\r\nhad declared that France would not thwart the Prussian monarch’s\r\nresolve to gain reparation for the insult. That question he declared\r\nto be totally distinct from an interference in the domestic affairs of\r\nthe Republic, which might be settled amicably by a joint mediation of\r\nthe Powers most concerned in them, namely, the Emperor, Great Britain,\r\nPrussia, and France. The draft of this important despatch closed with\r\nthis sentence, in Pitt’s handwriting: “Could such a good understanding\r\nbe agreed on, there can be little doubt that the affairs of Holland\r\nwould be settled in an amicable way, to the satisfaction of all those\r\nwho are interested in the welfare of the Republic.”[545]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that Pitt meant to encourage Prussia to energetic\r\naction, in case the Estates of Holland did not grant full reparation\r\nfor the insult; but he looked on that step merely as preliminary\r\nto the others which would solve the whole question by a peaceful\r\nmediation of the four Powers above named. On learning that the\r\nEmperor had expressed his friendly interest in the Prince of Orange\r\nand his approval of Prussia’s conduct, the Foreign Office sent off a\r\ndespatch to Keith, British Ambassador at Vienna, bidding him to urge\r\nhis active co-operation “and to make it, if possible, the means of\r\nestablishing a cordial and confidential correspondence with that Court\r\nin future.”[546] Joseph II did not respond to this friendly proposal,\r\nprobably because of troubles lowering in the East. But the incident\r\nproves the reluctance of our Foreign Office to act with Prussia alone,\r\nand also its hopes of a peaceful mediation in Dutch affairs. According\r\nto news received from Paris, France did not seem likely to oppose\r\nPrussia’s action, and even favoured the scheme of a joint mediation of\r\nthe three Powers, which were then on cordial terms.[547]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the friendly assurances that came from London, and the\r\nmanly advice of Hertzberg, Frederick William continued to vacillate in\r\nhis usual manner. As we have seen, he had recently coquetted with the\r\nnotion of a mediation conjointly with France alone; but, despite its\r\ncurt rejection by the Court of Versailles, he now recurred to a similar\r\nscheme.[548] If France had played her cards well, she might even then\r\nhave won the day at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the French Government at this crisis is hard to fathom.\r\nIts swift and unaccountable changes may perhaps be explained by the\r\nalternate triumph of peaceful and warlike counsels in the Ministry,\r\nwhich in the month of August underwent some alterations. Towards Great\r\nBritain the tone was at first quite reassuring, a fact which may be\r\nascribed to the friendly relations between Montmorin and Eden. Our\r\nenvoy had visited London in July, and therefore, on his return to Paris\r\nat the end of the month, fully knew the intentions of his chiefs. Their\r\npacific nature appeared in a proposal, which he was charged to make\r\nto Montmorin, for the discontinuance of warlike preparations on both\r\nsides until such time as notice might be given for their renewal. On\r\n4th August the French Minister cordially received this proposal,[549]\r\nand it was acted on with sincerity until the crisis of the middle of\r\nSeptember. But Eden soon found that the French Court intended forcibly\r\nto intervene if the Prussian troops entered the United Provinces, and\r\nthat Montmorin had rejected the recent proposal from Berlin for a\r\nFranco-Prussian intervention.[550] Here, surely, the French Minister\r\ncommitted a surprising blunder. The traditional friendship between\r\ntheir Courts should have led him to welcome a proposal which would\r\nhave kept England entirely out of the question. Probably he counted\r\non procuring better terms from the ever complaisant Court of Berlin.\r\nIf so, he erred egregiously. By repelling the advances of Prussia, he\r\nthrew that Power into the arms of Great Britain; and Pitt was shrewd\r\nenough to accord a hearty welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIPLE ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n    This treaty produced an effect throughout the whole of Europe by\r\n    its mere existence, without military preparations or force of\r\n    arms.--VON SYBEL.\r\n\r\n    Pitt has already astonished all Europe by the alacrity of the late\r\n    armament, and his name as a War Minister is now as high as that\r\n    of his father ever was.--THE EARL OF MORNINGTON TO THE DUKE OF\r\n    RUTLAND, 17th October 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events described in the last chapter had brought England and\r\nPrussia to a crisis at which, despite their strong mutual suspicion,\r\ncommon action was imperiously needed in order to save the Dutch\r\nNetherlands from French domination. As we have seen, no British\r\nstatesman had ever acquiesced in the supremacy of France in that\r\ncountry; and it is clear from the British archives that Pitt now took\r\na keen interest in thwarting her designs. The draft of the official\r\nanswer to Eden’s despatch of 4th August 1787 is entirely in Pitt’s\r\nwriting, and it was sent without alteration or addition by the Foreign\r\nMinister, Lord Carmarthen--an unusual circumstance, which shows the\r\nmasterful grip of the chief over matters of high import. In this\r\ndespatch, of 10th August, he welcomed the assurance of Montmorin\r\nthat warlike preparations would be stopped until further notice.\r\nGreat Britain would, however, renew them after due notice if France\r\nassembled a force at Givet, on the Belgian border. He then referred\r\npointedly to rumours that French transports had sailed for Amsterdam--a\r\nmeasure which would prejudice “the great work of conciliation which\r\nit is so much the object of the two Courts to forward and promote.”\r\nFrench ships were also reported as laying in stores of food in\r\nBritish ports, a proceeding which would have been stopped but for the\r\nfriendly assurances now received. He then referred to the invitation\r\nof the loyal provinces of Friesland and Zealand, that Great Britain\r\nwould mediate on their behalf, and hinted that this might be done.\r\nThe despatch closed with the following dignified remonstrance on the\r\nsubject of the outrages of the Free Corps in Holland:\r\n\r\n    I am here also under the painful necessity of adding that the\r\n    conduct held in the Province of Holland, apparently instigated\r\n    by those who have all along appeared the instruments of France,\r\n    seems to increase, instead of diminishing in violence. I enclose a\r\n    copy of an address presented by the Free Corps of that Province,\r\n    which it is intended that you should show to M. de M[ontmorin]. It\r\n    cannot escape that Minister how little such a step is calculated to\r\n    promote an accommodation or a suspension of hostilities, which his\r\n    language so strongly recommends.[551]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pitt had sent his cousin, William Wyndham Grenville, to\r\ncollect information at The Hague. As we saw in Chapter XII, the\r\nattainments of that young statesman, then Paymaster of the Forces, were\r\neminently sound. His hard and practical nature stood in contrast to the\r\nsensitive and imaginative Harris, about whom George III trenchantly\r\nwrote to Pitt, that he was so easily discouraged that it was well he\r\nheld no military command. Probably Pitt held the same opinion about\r\nHarris, whose forward policy he had long held in check. That there was\r\nsome widespread distrust of him is clear from the observation of the\r\nDuke of Dorset, that “he was playing the devil at The Hague.”[552] In\r\nany case, it was well to have independent advice, and the selection of\r\nso young a man as Grenville is a tribute to his prudence and ability.\r\n\r\nHe reached The Hague on 30th July, and during his stay of about\r\nthree weeks succeeded in clearing up many points preliminary to the\r\nmediation. The letters which passed between him and Pitt bespeak a\r\nresolve on both sides to settle matters peaceably if possible. The\r\nfollowing sentence in Pitt’s letter of 1st August is noteworthy: “It\r\nis very material that our friends should not lose the superiority of\r\nforce within the Republic, while we are labouring to protect it from\r\ninterference from without.” Six days later he wrote that the prospect\r\nwas still favourable, but that, if French troops were to assemble\r\nat Givet, it might be needful to resume naval preparations, so as to\r\nreassure Prussia.[553] Equally hopeful in tone is his letter of 2nd\r\nAugust to Earl Cornwallis, Governor-General of India. After pointing\r\nout that Great Britain could not allow France to become mistress of the\r\nDutch Netherlands, and thereby add enormously to her naval strength\r\nand her power of aggression in India, he expressed the hope that the\r\nmediation of the three Powers would take place; but, failing an apology\r\nfrom the Estates of Holland, the King of Prussia would order his\r\ntroops into that province, and take steps for “maintaining the just\r\nrights of the Stadholder and the constitution and independence of the\r\nRepublic.” If war broke out, Cornwallis was at once to strike at the\r\nDutch settlement of Trincomalee, in Ceylon; while a force from England\r\nwould be sent to reduce the Cape of Good Hope--the first sign in Pitt’s\r\nletters of the importance which he attached to that post.[554]\r\n\r\nDespite suspicious signs to the contrary, the French Cabinet at that\r\ntime probably wished for a peaceful mediation; but the Courts of London\r\nand Versailles differed sharply as to the way of action. Pitt and\r\nCarmarthen held that reparation to the King of Prussia for the insult\r\nto his sister was a purely personal affair, distinct from the political\r\nissues. France now denied this; she belittled the affront to the\r\nPrincess, and induced the Estates of Holland to frame an apology which\r\nwas in the main a justification of their conduct. If Montmorin had\r\npressed that body to make an adequate apology, it would certainly have\r\nbeen forthcoming. The stiff-neckedness of the Estates of Holland was\r\ndue to their expectation of armed support from France if matters came\r\nto the sword; and the action of the Marquis de Vérac, the French envoy,\r\njustified their confidence.\r\n\r\nIn truth, French policy wore different aspects at Paris and at The\r\nHague. Montmorin assumed an air of injured innocence when Eden\r\ntransmitted to him Pitt’s remonstrances. On 15th August he indignantly\r\ndenied the truth of the rumours about French transports sailing to\r\nHolland and of the food supplies drawn from England. He also complained\r\nof the harshness of Pitt’s reference to the assembling of troops at\r\nGivet, an action which was a natural retort to the muster of Prussians\r\nat their fortress of Wesel on the Rhine; and he merely laughed at\r\nthe address of the Free Corps.[555] A week later Eden reported that\r\nMontmorin was anxious to settle the Dutch troubles peacefully and\r\nspeedily, and would therefore recall the over-zealous Vérac from The\r\nHague. Pitt, however, refused to allow that Prussia was exceeding her\r\njust rights in claiming satisfaction for the insult. The fit way of\r\nending the matter, he argued, would be for the Estates of Holland to\r\napologize frankly and fully, whereupon the three Powers must insist on\r\nthe dispersal and disarming of the Free Corps as a needful preliminary\r\nto the joint mediation.[556] On 28th August Eden heard that the French\r\nGovernment would not form the camp at Givet, it being understood that\r\nthe Prussian monarch would limit his claims to the gaining of personal\r\nsatisfaction, which France promised to procure from the Estates of\r\nHolland. This welcome news led Pitt to express the hope that an\r\nagreement would at once be framed for stopping the excesses of the\r\nFree Corps. Thus, so far as our dealings with Montmorin ran, there\r\nseemed, even at the end of August 1787, the likelihood of a peaceful\r\nsettlement. A signal proof of Pitt’s hopefulness is afforded by his\r\nletter of 28th August to Cornwallis at Calcutta. In this he speaks of\r\nthe need of settling the personal question between the King of Prussia\r\nand the Estates of Holland as preliminary to the general settlement of\r\nthe dispute. Even of that he cherished hopes, but he deemed caution and\r\npreparation so eminently necessary as to order the despatch of another\r\nregiment to Bombay.[557]\r\n\r\nIn truth, the central knot of the whole tangle was at The Hague. In\r\norder to understand the position there we must remember that the\r\nStates-General, representing the Union, had not called on France for\r\naid, in case of hostilities. Thanks to the skill and private influence\r\nof Harris, a majority of that body still upheld the claims of the\r\nStadholder, deprecated any appeal to the Court of Versailles, and\r\nsought to procure from the Estates of Holland an apology to the King\r\nof Prussia. The Estates, however, stoutly refused to give anything\r\nmore than a complacent explanation of the incident. The spirit which\r\nanimated that assembly appears in the comment of one of the leading\r\nPatriots on the Prussian ultimatum: “A sovereign body can never\r\napologize to the wife of its first servant.”[558] The Memoirs of\r\nCount de Portes, a Swiss officer who espoused the cause of the Dutch\r\nPatriots and helped to raise a regiment for them, show the cause of\r\ntheir confidence. He wrote on 14th September: “Though the Prussians are\r\nat our gates, they seem to me still at the sport of politics, and I\r\ncan scarcely believe that they will put themselves between our waters\r\nand _our French_. At the worst we will open our sluices and drown\r\nourselves.”[559]\r\n\r\nThere was the strength of the Patriots. In a legal sense their case\r\nwas weak; but their audacious energy even now promised to snatch\r\nvictory from the inert Orange party. The Free Corps in the months of\r\nJuly and August became more numerous and insolent than ever, and it\r\nwas a notorious fact that hundreds of French officers and soldiers had\r\npassed into their ranks.[560] Thus strengthened, they marched about the\r\ncountry, taking some places by force, and in several cases deposing the\r\nRegents, or chief magistrates appointed by the Stadholder. On all sides\r\nthey despoiled the property of opponents, and carried confusion to the\r\ngates of The Hague. On 1st August Harris thus summed up his hopes and\r\nwishes to Carmarthen: “If I am de-Witted, don’t let me be outwitted,\r\nbut revenge me.”[561] Count Bentinck also wrote: “the majority of\r\nHolland have made themselves masters of our lives and property; ...\r\nthey are masters of the purse, and of the sword, and of the Courts\r\nof Justice.”[562] That arch-intriguer, Vérac, on 31st August, the\r\nvery day of his recall, assured the Patriots that France would never\r\ndesert them. This boast was consonant with the whole policy of France\r\nrespecting the Free Corps. She had rejected the Prussian proposal for\r\ntheir suppression, which accompanied the plan of a Franco-Prussian\r\nmediation. On 29th August Montmorin stated to Eden that it was\r\nimpossible to disarm the Free Corps, and on 11th September when stiff\r\nremonstrances came from London on this subject, he airily declared\r\nthat France could no more control those troops than the waves of the\r\nsea.[563]\r\n\r\nIs it surprising that the Pitt Ministry came to the conclusion that\r\nthe real aim of the French Government was to amuse England and Prussia\r\nwith fair words, until its partisans gained a complete mastery in the\r\nUnited Provinces and forced the States-General to send to Paris a\r\nformal demand for help, with which the Court of Versailles could not\r\nbut comply? Whether Montmorin was playing a double game, or whether\r\nhis hand was forced by other members of his Cabinet, is far from\r\nclear.[564] Certainly the contrast between his fair professions and\r\nFrench intrigues in Holland inspired increasing distrust, and served to\r\nbring about the _dénouement_ which shattered the prestige of the French\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the crisis came. Only by slow degrees did Pitt,\r\nCarmarthen, and Harris shake off distrust of Prussia. The length\r\nof time attending the transit of despatches between London and\r\nBerlin (eleven days on the average even in summer) clogged the\r\nnegotiations. At Paris the Prussian envoy, Görtz, intrigued against the\r\nAnglo-Prussian understanding, and represented Eden as minimizing the\r\ninsult to the Princess of Orange. At once Pitt sent to Eden a courteous\r\nbut firm request for an explanation of his words, which had caused a\r\nsensation at Berlin. Of course Eden was able to explain them entirely\r\nto Pitt’s satisfaction.[565] But it is clear that the mutual dislike at\r\nLondon and Berlin could have been ended only by the fears aroused by\r\nthe action of France.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove the distrust prevalent at Berlin, Pitt and\r\nCarmarthen sent to that Court full copies of their correspondence with\r\nFrance, which convinced Frederick William of their good faith and the\r\nduplicity of Versailles.[566] He saw that France was dragging on the\r\naffair so that the approach of autumn might hinder the effective action\r\nof his troops. Suspicion of this helped to bring England and Prussia to\r\naccord. But the tidings which spurred on Pitt and Carmarthen to more\r\ndecisive action came from The Hague. On 20th August Harris reported\r\nthat a body of Free Corps was approaching that town, that he was\r\npreparing to leave it in haste, and had sent all important papers away.\r\nOn hearing this news and perhaps that brought back by Grenville on 23rd\r\nAugust, the Cabinet resolved to send General Fawcett to Cassel to hire\r\n5,000 Hessians for the help of the loyal Dutch provinces, and others\r\nfor the British service--that detestable expedient which parsimony made\r\ninevitable at every alarm of war. Harris was also empowered to order up\r\na British ship lying at Harwich, laden with gunpowder and stores for\r\nthe help of the Stadholder’s forces.[567] On the same day Carmarthen\r\ninstructed Ewart to warn the Prussian Court that, though we had agreed\r\nwith France to suspend warlike preparations, yet we were ready to send\r\nout at least as large a fleet as France could possibly equip.[568]\r\nEwart, in his reply of 4th September, stated that but for this\r\nencouraging news Frederick William might once more have wavered, owing\r\nto the insidious intrigues of the French party, and the discouraging\r\nreports which came from the Duke of Brunswick. The nerves of that\r\nveteran were unstrung by visions of the spectral camp at Givet, and\r\nhe mourned over the unpreparedness of his own force at Wesel, which,\r\nhe declared, could not march before 7th September.[569] These tidings\r\nhad once more depressed the royal thermometer at Berlin; but the news\r\nfrom London came just in time to send the mercury up again. On 3rd\r\nSeptember, then, Frederick William drew up an ultimatum to the Estates\r\nof Holland, and bade Hertzberg come to a close understanding with\r\nEngland. On 7th September he resolved to recall Thulemeyer, and urged\r\nthe British Government to declare what forces it would set in motion if\r\nFrance attacked the Prussian army in Holland.[570]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLate on that day there arrived at Berlin news which ended the last\r\nhesitations of Frederick William. The Porte, long fretting under\r\nthe yoke imposed by the Treaty of Kainardji, and irritated by the\r\nproceedings of the Czarina, had declared war on Russia. This came\r\nalmost as a bolt from the blue. No one had believed the Sultan capable\r\nof so much energy as to attack the Muscovites; and rumours spread\r\nat Vienna and Petersburg that this was due to British gold. The\r\ninsinuation was probably false. As will appear in Chapter XXI, the\r\nTurks had been goaded into war, and relied on help from Sweden, perhaps\r\nalso from Prussia. Undoubtedly their action greatly embarrassed Joseph\r\nII, who was bound by compacts with Russia, the enemy of Turkey, and\r\nwith France, her friend. Late on 7th September Finckenstein pointed\r\nthis out to Ewart, and added that Prussia and England ought at once\r\nto frame an agreement, and intervene effectively without fear of\r\nFrance.[571] This time the decision was final. Ewart reported that\r\nthe news of Turkey’s challenge to Russia caused all the more joy at\r\nBerlin as the party of Marie Antoinette had gained an ascendancy at\r\nVersailles, which implied the strengthening of the Franco-Austrian\r\nalliance and a proportionate loosening of the ties linking Joseph II\r\nto Russia.[572] The reasoning was not sound; for it was probable that\r\nFrance, acting in close concert with the two Empires, would partition\r\nTurkey with a view to the seizure of Egypt and other commanding posts\r\nin the East.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Prussia looked on the war in the East as giving her a\r\nfree hand in the West; and on 7th September she decided to act in\r\nthe Netherlands. Four days later a French envoy, Groschlag, arrived\r\nin Berlin with offers, partly enticing, partly threatening, which\r\nmight once more have drawn the wavering impulses of the King towards\r\nParis.[573] But now, after many months of uphill fight, all the omens\r\nfavoured the Anglo-Prussian cause.\r\n\r\nOn 13th September, before the refusal of the Prussian ultimatum by the\r\nEstates of Holland had been received, the Duke of Brunswick crossed the\r\nDutch frontier. In Guelderland and parts of Utrecht the Prussians were\r\nhailed as deliverers; even the city of Utrecht opened its gates, owing\r\nto the cowardice of the Rhinegrave of Salm, who soon abandoned the\r\ncause for which he had blustered so long. Nowhere did the Free Corps\r\nmake any firm stand. Even in Holland their excesses had turned public\r\nopinion strongly against them. It is said that the weather prevented\r\nthe opening of the sluices; but the half-heartedness of the defence,\r\nand the eagerness of the Orange party for deliverance, probably explain\r\nthe _débâcle_. When the Dutch have been united and determined, their\r\ndefence of their land has always been stubborn. Now it was not even\r\ncreditable; and this fact may be cited as damning to the Patriots’\r\nclaim that they stood for the nation. On 20th September the Prince of\r\nOrange made his entry into The Hague amidst boundless enthusiasm. Sir\r\nJames Harris also received a striking ovation, which rewarded him for\r\nthe long months of struggle.\r\n\r\nNow, while the Patriots were in consternation at their overthrow, our\r\nenvoy clinched his triumph by persuading the Estates of Holland to\r\nreverse their previous acts against the Stadholder’s authority, and to\r\nrescind a resolution which they had passed on 9th September appealing\r\nfor armed aid from France. The cancelling of this appeal on 21st\r\nSeptember was a matter of great importance, as it deprived France of a\r\npretext for armed intervention. The receipt of this news at Versailles\r\nhelped to cool the warlike ardour of the French Court.\r\n\r\nThere the temper of the Ministry had fluctuated alarmingly. The recall\r\nof Vérac seemed to assure a peaceful settlement. But on 4th September\r\nMontmorin sent to Eden a despatch which ran directly counter to the\r\nBritish and Prussian proposals. It stated that the Dutch towns,\r\nwhere the Free Corps had forcibly changed the magistrates, “_ont\r\ndéjà consommé la réforme; ... c’est une affaire terminée_.” As for\r\nthe Prince of Orange, he would do well to abdicate in favour of his\r\nson.[574] Pitt of course indignantly rejected both proposals; and his\r\ntemper is seen in the phrase of his letter of 14th September to Eden,\r\nthat if France was determined to keep her predominance in the United\r\nProvinces, she must fight for it.[575]\r\n\r\nAn acute crisis now set in. While Carmarthen warned Montmorin that\r\nEngland would not remain a quiet spectator of French intervention, that\r\nMinister on 16th September issued a Declaration that France could not\r\nrefuse the appeal for help which had come from the Estates of Holland.\r\nHe charged England with having plotted the whole affair with Prussia,\r\nand asserted that, inconvenient though the time was now that the fate\r\nof the Turkish Empire stood at hazard, France must in honour draw the\r\nsword.[576]\r\n\r\nThis Declaration drew from Pitt an equally stiff retort. In a circular\r\ndespatch intended for all our ambassadors, which he himself drew\r\nup, he declared that England could not admit the right of France,\r\nowing to its treaty with the Dutch Republic, “to support a party in\r\none of the Provinces in a measure expressly disavowed by a majority\r\nof the States-General; and His Majesty has repeatedly declared the\r\nimpossibility of his being indifferent to any armed interference of\r\nFrance in the affairs of the Republic, which, if unopposed, must\r\nnecessarily tend to consequences dangerous to the constitutional\r\nindependence of those Provinces, and affecting in many respects the\r\ninterests and security of his dominions. His Majesty has therefore\r\nfound himself under the necessity of taking measures for equipping\r\na considerable naval armament and for augmenting his land forces.”\r\nNevertheless he still desired “an amicable settlement of the points\r\nin dispute.”[577] As many as forty sail of the line were immediately\r\nprepared for sea; and here we may notice that Pitt’s care for the navy\r\nensured a preponderance which virtually decided the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn order to see whether war might be averted, George III suggested,\r\non 16th September, that someone should be sent to Paris who could\r\ndeal with the French Ministers better than Eden did. Pitt therefore\r\ndecided, on 19th September, to despatch Grenville, charging him\r\ndistinctly to declare that Great Britain approved the action of the\r\nKing of Prussia, and would resist an armed intervention by France; also\r\nthat the settlement in the United Provinces must be such as to restore\r\nto the Stadholder his constitutional powers, and prevent the ascendency\r\nof the party hostile to Britain. A secondary aim of Grenville’s mission\r\nwas the forming of a friendly understanding with France for the\r\ncessation of warlike preparations on both sides of the Channel--a proof\r\nof Pitt’s watchful care over the exchequer.[578]\r\n\r\nMontmorin received Grenville coldly on 28th September at Versailles;\r\nbut his reserve was merely a cloak to hide his discomfiture. Nine\r\ndays before he had assured Eden, in the confidence which followed on\r\na private dinner, that “if the Estates of Holland should prove so\r\ndefenceless, or so intimidated as to give way to whatever might be\r\nforced under the present attack, he would advise His Most Christian\r\nMajesty not to engage in war.” If matters went more favourably he\r\nwould advise him to draw the sword; but, as for his own feelings,\r\nhe was weary of the Dutch Question, and only sought the means for\r\ngetting rid of it creditably, so that France might turn her attention\r\nto another quarter, obviously the East.[579] Grenville, after hearing\r\nall this from Eden, and receiving the good news from The Hague, of\r\ncourse put the right interpretation on Montmorin’s _non possumus_, and\r\nsought to facilitate his stately retreat. He was at once waved back.\r\nMontmorin would make no promise as to her course of action so long as\r\nthe Prussians were in Holland. Even on the question of disarmament\r\nby the two Powers--a matter of the utmost moment to France--he would\r\nmake no pledge, though Grenville strongly urged him to do so. Two more\r\ninterviews passed with the same frigid negations; and on 3rd October\r\nGrenville returned to London, harbouring a shrewd suspicion that the\r\nactions of the Court of Versailles would on this occasion tally with\r\nMontmorin’s words.\r\n\r\nSuch proved to be the case. France did nothing, to the unbounded\r\ndisgust of her partisans in Holland. Amsterdam shut its gates and\r\nendured a short siege from the Prussians in the belief that help\r\nmust come from Paris. Our diplomatic agent, W. A. Miles, writing\r\nfrom Liège on 1st October, reported that the burgomasters of Utrecht\r\nand Gorcum had passed through that city on their way to Paris in the\r\nconviction that “France would never leave them in the lurch, and that\r\nher troops would certainly march to the relief of Amsterdam.”[580]\r\nTheir consternation must have been great on reaching Givet to find that\r\nthere was no camp there.[581] The truth then flashed upon them that the\r\nFrench agents had relied on bluster and the Free Corps. Disappointment\r\nat the inaction of the French Court probably hastened the surrender\r\nof Amsterdam, which opened its gates on 10th October. The capture by\r\nthe Prussians of many French soldiers, who declared that they were\r\nacting for that Government, revealed the sinister conduct of some,\r\nat least, of the French Ministers, and of Vérac.[582] A letter of\r\nGrenville to Eden on 26th October 1787 shows the surprise and disgust\r\nof our Ministers at this flagrant bad faith. He says he is “mortified”\r\nat finding that Ségur, Minister for War, had sent signed orders for\r\nparties of French artillerymen to march north to the frontier, and\r\nput themselves under the command of an adventurer named Esterhazy.\r\n“His (Ségur’s) orders again expressly direct the march into Holland in\r\ndisguise, and point out the places where the men are to be equipped\r\nwith _habits de paysan_ for this purpose.”[583]\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Amsterdam gave the last blow to the war party at\r\nVersailles. Up to 14th October Pitt felt the utmost concern, as appears\r\nin his letter of that date to Eden; but the reply of that envoy three\r\ndays later showed that Ségur and his colleagues now bowed to the\r\ninevitable. Their peaceful mood was doubtless confirmed by the evasive\r\nand discouraging answer sent by Austria to the appeal for help.[584]\r\nThe Emperor had a large force in Belgium, but none too large to hold\r\ndown that people. Moreover, the prospect of war with Turkey imposed\r\ncaution at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger now was that France would join Russia and Austria\r\nin the dismemberment of Turkey. Fear of such a step haunted Pitt, who\r\nalways surveyed the Dutch Question from the standpoint of India. Thus\r\nwe find him on 8th October charging Eden to watch most carefully the\r\nattitude of France to the events in the East. The replies of that envoy\r\nwere, as usual, reassuring. France, according to Eden, only desired\r\npeace, and the scheme of seizing Egypt was “wholly wild.”[585] Pitt\r\ntherefore decided to press forward, and to persuade France to give\r\nan unequivocal assurance of her pacific intentions, as a prelude to\r\ndisarmament on both sides. His letter of 14th October to Eden on this\r\ntopic shows a grip of essentials, together with a surprising _finesse_.\r\nWhile anxious to induce France to disarm at the earliest possible\r\nmoment, he advised Eden to humour Alvensleben, the special Prussian\r\nenvoy at Paris, and to convince him that we were giving Prussia firm\r\nsupport and were not disposed to patch up a premature settlement.[586]\r\nEvidently Pitt’s interest in diplomacy, though belated, was keen.\r\n\r\nAfter long correspondence with Berlin, and much demurring at\r\nVersailles, a Declaration and Counter-Declaration were drafted and\r\nsigned by the British envoys and Montmorin on 27th October. The French\r\ndocument averred that, as it had never been the intention of the King\r\nof France to intervene in Dutch affairs, he now retained no hostile\r\nviews in any quarter respecting them, and therefore consented to\r\ndisarm.[587] This public denial of what had notoriously been the aim of\r\nhis Government, and this promise to renounce all ideas of revenge on\r\nPrussia, sent a thrill of astonishment through the diplomatic world.\r\nNever had France so openly abandoned her partisans or so publicly\r\nproclaimed her impotence. If Pitt (as French historians have asserted)\r\nhad persistently sought to humiliate the Court of Versailles, he could\r\nnot have succeeded more completely. But this Counter-Declaration was\r\nmerely the climax of a diplomatic game which had taken a threatening\r\nturn only since the beginning of September. The fact is that the French\r\nMinisters, and still more their agents in Holland, had precipitated\r\nthe crisis by the actions of the Free Corps at the very time which\r\nproved to be most unfavourable for them. By their conduct they courted\r\nfailure; but it was the outbreak of war in the East which made that\r\nfailure complete and crushing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the conduct of the friends of the House of Orange,\r\nafter long delays and blunders, was singularly astute when the crisis\r\ncame. The conduct of the Princess deserves the highest praise. The\r\ndiplomacy of Harris and Ewart was a marvel of skill. As for Eden, he\r\nhad little more to do than to obey orders, though he sometimes toned\r\ndown the harsh phrases of Pitt and Carmarthen.[588] The action of the\r\nPrussians was trenchant, but it could not have been so but for their\r\nconfidence in the promised support of the Sea Power. Pitt’s fostering\r\ncare of the national resources, and his rehabilitation of the navy had\r\nmade it virtually impossible for the semi-bankrupt French State to\r\nenter single-handed on a war with Great Britain and Prussia. This was\r\nthe determining factor in the problem; and every statesman at Paris,\r\nLondon, and Berlin knew it.\r\n\r\nBut something more than sound finance is needed in a complex and\r\ncritical situation. There the qualities of foresight, tact, and\r\ndetermination are of priceless worth; and on all sides it was admitted\r\nthat Pitt displayed them to a high degree. The restraint which kept\r\nHarris strictly within bounds until the fit moment arrived is not more\r\nremarkable than the boldness which reaped all possible advantages\r\nfrom the daring _coup_ of the Princess of Orange. Eden wrote on 1st\r\nNovember, that he had _shuddered_ at the courage of Pitt in braving the\r\nchances of a war with France.[589] But the young statesman knew how far\r\nhe could go with safety; he discerned the essential fact that France\r\ncould not fight, and that Montmorin adopted his negative attitude in\r\norder to hide that important secret. If Montmorin chose to justify her\r\ndisarmament by assertions which were equally false and humiliating,\r\nthat was a matter for him, not for the statesmen of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nPitt’s conduct of this, his first great diplomatic campaign, shines\r\nall the more brightly by contrast with the vacillations of Frederick\r\nWilliam and the stupendous blunders of the French Government. Adverting\r\nbriefly to these last, we may note that France had little ground for\r\ninterference so long as a majority of the States-General deprecated\r\nsuch action; and, thanks to Harris, that majority, except for a few\r\ndays, held firm. The French Government therefore founded its hopes\r\non the majority in the Province of Holland, and on the high-handed\r\nproceedings of the Free Corps, which it secretly abetted. Montmorin\r\nrepulsed two overtures from Berlin because of the insistence of Prussia\r\nthat those corps should be suppressed. This action it was, more perhaps\r\nthan the resentment of Frederick William at the insult to his sister,\r\nwhich helped to bring Prussia and Great Britain into line. France also\r\nfinally denied the right of Frederick William to gain reparation for\r\nthat insult, though she at first recognized the justice of his claim.\r\nFurther, when he sent forward his troops, she made ready for war, and\r\nthen adopted the attitude of sullen resentment, which rendered a joint\r\nmediation by the three Powers impossible. This conduct in its turn\r\nimplied the lapse of the Franco-Dutch treaty of 1785, and the triumph\r\nof British and Prussian influence in the United Provinces. Frenchmen\r\nalso saw in this event another proof of the uselessness of the Austrian\r\nalliance on which Marie Antoinette had staked her popularity; and\r\nthe _débâcle_ in Holland was a deadly blow at the influence of that\r\nunfortunate Queen. Finally France admitted her defeat in terms at which\r\nfriends and foes alike scoffed. Not without reason, then, did Napoleon\r\nafterwards assert that the French Revolution was due to three causes,\r\nthe Battle of Rossbach, the Diamond Necklace scandal, and the ousting\r\nof French influence from the United Provinces in 1787. The judgement is\r\ncuriously superficial in that it passes over the fiscal and agrarian\r\nevils which potently conduced to the great upheaval; but it reflected\r\nthe opinion of that generation, which looked on deficits, dearths, and\r\nbread-riots as dispensations of Providence, of trifling import when\r\ncompared with the decay in prestige of an ancient monarchy. Something\r\nmay be said for this view of things in the case of France. For years\r\nthat monarchy had lived on prestige. The surrender of October 1787 now\r\nproclaimed to the world its decrepitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the events attending the restoration of the Stadholder’s power\r\nand the constitution of the year 1747 we are not here concerned. Pitt\r\nhad rightly refused to interfere until the efforts of the Patriots to\r\nestablish French influence had become a positive danger to England.\r\nHis interest in those troubles was largely grounded on naval and\r\ncolonial considerations. If the United Provinces became an annexe of\r\nFrance, their fleet, their valuable colonies, and their once prosperous\r\nEast India Company, would be cast into the balance against us. Now\r\nthat this danger was past, he sought to remove all chance of its\r\nrecurrence by suggesting the formation of a treaty of alliance with the\r\nRepublic. On 5th October the first proposal to this effect was framed\r\nat Whitehall on condition that the two States should assist one another\r\nin case of attack, and guarantee the possession of their territories;\r\nbut from the outset the Foreign Office set its face sternly against any\r\nconcession such as “Free Ships, Free Goods,” on which the Dutch were\r\nlikely to insist.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another stumbling stone in the way. The Dutch\r\nfelt keenly the surrender of Negapatam to Great Britain, and they\r\nurged that, as that sacrifice had been forced on them in 1784 for the\r\ngreater security of our settlements in the Carnatic, its retrocession\r\nwas a natural consequence and a pledge of the friendship now happily\r\nrestored. The Pitt Ministry, however, viewed the matter in the\r\ncold light of self-interest, and rejected the demand, in spite of\r\nthe reiterated assurances of the Prince of Orange, the new Grand\r\nPensionary, Van der Spiegel, and other friends of England, that they\r\ncould not otherwise accept the proffered treaty. Even Harris finally\r\nconfessed his inability to bend their will, and he advised Pitt and\r\nCarmarthen not to imperil the alliance on this single detail. Prussia,\r\nhe said, had given way at some points in her negotiations with the\r\nDutch; and it was impolitic for us to be too stiff.[590]\r\n\r\nPitt, however, would not give way. Probably he considered that the\r\nStadholder’s party, now in power, needed our support more than we\r\nneeded his; or he may have grounded his decision on the need of\r\npreventing the rise of any Power other than that of England in South\r\nIndia, where Tippoo Sahib was always a danger. He refused to do more\r\nthan offer to negotiate on this question within the space of six\r\nmonths after the signature of the treaty. The negotiation was never\r\neven begun; and thus the treaty signed at The Hague on 15th April\r\n1788 was always viewed with disfavour by the Dutch. The guarantee of\r\nthe restored Stadholderate by Great Britain, and the promise of each\r\nState to assist in the defence of the possessions of the other, were\r\nin themselves quite satisfactory; but the compact lacked the solidity\r\nwhich comes only from entire confidence and goodwill.[591]\r\n\r\nThe formation of an alliance with Prussia in the same year also came\r\nabout in a manner more brilliant than sound. Of course, in all such\r\naffairs each Power tries to bring the other over to its own standpoint;\r\nand much tugging must needs take place between a military and a naval\r\nState. Frederick William and his chief statesman, Hertzberg, had just\r\nachieved the first success of their careers, and largely owing to the\r\nfirmness of Pitt. Assured of their supremacy in Germany and Holland,\r\nthey now sought to guard against the dangers threatening them from the\r\nEast. The news which came in the month of November 1787, that Austria\r\nwould join Russia in her war with Turkey, caused the gravest concern\r\nat Berlin, and therefore enhanced the value of a British alliance. The\r\ngrowing weakness of France and the power of Pitt to handle a crisis\r\nfirmly therefore put a new face on Prussian policy. Instead of waiting\r\non Paris, the Berlin Cabinet looked more and more expectantly towards\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nAlready Frederick William had signified his desire for a union with\r\nthe Dutch “in order to pave the way to a Triple Alliance between\r\nEngland, Prussia, and Holland as soon as it may be possible to\r\naccomplish it.”[592] But the Pitt Ministry, distrustful of an alliance\r\nwith Prussia unless Russia also came in, treated this overture very\r\ncoyly. From a letter which the first Earl Camden wrote to Pitt on\r\n18th October, we gather that the Earl was far more inclined to such\r\nan alliance than Pitt had shown himself to be at a recent meeting of\r\nthe Cabinet. Camden favoured the plan as tending to consolidate our\r\ninfluence in Holland--a matter of the utmost moment. “We have escaped\r\nmiraculously,” he writes, “from the most perilous situation we ever\r\nexperienced, and shall be mad if we slip the opportunity of rooting\r\nout the French interest in that country for ever ... and that will\r\nbe compleatly effected by a Prussian alliance.” It would also free\r\nPrussia from slavish dependence upon France. As for the fear that it\r\nwould drive France to a close compact with Russia and Austria, the Earl\r\ntreated that danger as remote.[593]\r\n\r\nCarmarthen, and probably Pitt also, looked on the danger as real\r\nenough to give them pause. Not till 2nd December did Carmarthen return\r\nany specific answer; and then he expressed the doubt whether it was\r\ndesirable to form a Triple Alliance then, as there were rumours of\r\na projected union between these three Powers, which might become a\r\nreality if England, Prussia, and Holland coalesced.[594] If that\r\nhostile league were formed, it would then be desirable to come to\r\nterms, and even to include Denmark, Sweden, and the lesser German\r\nStates. It is curious that he did not name Poland; but here we find the\r\nfirst definite sign of that league of the smaller States with Prussia\r\nand Great Britain which afterwards played so important a part in Pitt’s\r\nforeign policy.\r\n\r\nThe caution of Pitt was justified. In a few days’ time Sweden came\r\nknocking at our door, asking for admittance along with Denmark. The\r\nadventurous character of Gustavus III will appear in the sequel. Here\r\nwe may note that Carmarthen politely waved aside this offer of alliance\r\nfrom a suspicion that he was planning a blow at Russia.[595] The blow\r\ndid not fall until the middle of July 1788; but then the sudden summons\r\nof the Swedish King to the Empress Catharine to hand back part of\r\nRussian Finland, and to accept his mediation in the Russo-Turkish War,\r\nshowed the meaning of his proposal at Christmas 1787.\r\n\r\nOnly by slow degrees did the eastern horizon clear. But when France\r\nshowed her resentment at the participation of Austria in the Turkish\r\nWar, the spectre of a hostile Triple Alliance was laid; and then, but\r\nnot till then, Pitt showed more favour to the Prussian proposals. Yet\r\nhere again there was need of caution. The Eastern Question touched\r\nPrussia far more closely than England. If Joseph II gained his heart’s\r\ndesire--Moldavia and Wallachia--and Catharine extended her boundary to\r\nthe River Dniester, the greatness and even the safety of Prussia and of\r\nPoland would be hopelessly compromised.[596] Accordingly Prussia sought\r\nby all means short of drawing the sword to help the Turks in their\r\nunequal struggle. She cantoned large forces near the Austrian border,\r\nhinted that she would be glad to offer her mediation for the purpose\r\nof securing a reasonable peace, and sent an official disguised as a\r\nmerchant by way of Venice to Constantinople in order to encourage the\r\nSultan to a vigorous prosecution of the war.[597] Hertzberg also urged\r\nthe formation of a league between Prussia, England, and the smaller\r\nStates with a view to the guarantee of the Turkish possessions in\r\nEurope.[598]\r\n\r\nTo this proposal the British Government gave no encouragement. So\r\nfar as appears from the despatches of this year, the fate of Turkey\r\nwas not a matter of much concern to Pitt and Carmarthen. Indeed, not\r\nuntil 2nd April did they vouchsafe an answer to the Prussian proposal\r\nof alliance; and then they based their acceptance on the need of\r\nsafeguarding the situation in Holland. Other States, it was added,\r\nmight be invited to join the Triple Alliance in order effectively to\r\ncounterbalance the jealous efforts to which it might give rise; but\r\nGreat Britain declined to bind herself to any guarantee of the Sultan’s\r\ndominions. If he were in sore straits, Great Britain would support\r\nPrussia in gaining reasonable terms for him, but she would not favour\r\nany active intervention on his behalf. Still less would she support the\r\nnotion (outlined by Hertzberg) that Prussia should acquire an indemnity\r\nfor any gains that Austria might make in the present war.[599] The\r\nkeynote of British policy was firmly struck in this sentence: “The\r\ngreat object which we have in view is the continuance of peace, as far\r\nas that is not inconsistent with our essential interests. It is with\r\nthat view that the alliance of Holland has been thought so material,\r\nas rendering any attack upon us less probable. With the same view we\r\nare desirous of cultivating the closest connections with the Court of\r\nBerlin.”[600] That is to say, the proposed Triple Alliance was to be a\r\npurely defensive league for the safeguarding of the three States and\r\ntheir colonies.\r\n\r\nAt Berlin, however, now that Catharine had finally waved aside the\r\nfriendly offers of British and Prussian mediation, the Eastern crisis\r\neclipsed all other topics. By degrees Hertzberg laid his plans for the\r\naggrandizement of Prussia, whatever might befall the Turks.[601] As\r\nwill appear more fully in a later chapter, he expected that Joseph II\r\nwould gain the whole, or large parts, of Moldavia and Wallachia. The\r\narmed mediation of Prussia was to lessen these acquisitions; and as a\r\nset-off to them Austria must cede Galicia to the Poles; while their\r\ngratitude for the recovery of that great province, torn from them in\r\n1772, was to show itself in the cession to Prussia of the important\r\nfortresses and districts, Danzig and Thorn, so necessary for the\r\nrounding off of her ragged borders on the East. Such was the scheme\r\nwhich took shape in Hertzberg’s fertile brain, and dominated Prussian\r\npolicy down to the summer of the year 1791.\r\n\r\nThe watchful Ewart forwarded to Whitehall details of this gigantic\r\n“deal” (if we may use the Americanism); and as the scheme came to light\r\nit aroused deep distrust at Whitehall. At once the Prussian proposal\r\nwore a new aspect; and the draft of a treaty drawn up in this sense in\r\nthe middle of April left little hope of a settlement between the two\r\nPowers. In reply to its proposals Pitt and Carmarthen pointed out the\r\nvagueness of the Prussian suggestions respecting Turkey, but hinted\r\nthat an opportunity might come for befriending the Sultan if he were\r\ntoo hard pressed. Further, while promising to help Prussia if she were\r\nattacked, they again demanded the like succour from her if any of our\r\ncolonies were assailed. They also desired to bring into the league\r\nSweden, Denmark, and Portugal. For the present, however, they sought to\r\nlimit the Anglo-Prussian understanding to the Dutch guarantee, though\r\na closer compact was to be discussed during the visit of the Prussian\r\nmonarch to his sister at Loo.[602]\r\n\r\nThis last suggestion was for Ewart himself. The others he was to pass\r\non to Hertzberg. That Minister chafed at this further rebuff to his\r\nplans, which now comprised the offer of the armed mediation of Prussia,\r\nEngland, and Holland to Catharine and Joseph. The fondness of Frederick\r\nWilliam for France once more appeared; and the French party at Berlin\r\nvenomously raised its head. England, they avowed, would gain everything\r\nfrom this one-sided compact; for her colonies were to be found in every\r\nsea. Why should the troops of the great Frederick be set in motion to\r\nhelp the islanders every time that one of their colonial governors lost\r\nhis temper? Finally the King declared that he would not send his troops\r\nbeyond the bounds of Germany and Holland.[603]\r\n\r\nThere seemed little chance of an agreement between the two Courts,\r\nuntil Frederick William set out for his visit to the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Orange at Loo, and let fall the remark that he hoped to see\r\nSir James Harris there. Already that envoy had asked permission to come\r\nto London; and, with the zeal of a convert to the Prussian alliance,\r\nhe convinced Ministers of its desirability, even if they gave way on\r\ncertain points. The Instructions drawn up for him on 6th June set forth\r\nthe need of an Anglo-Prussian alliance in order “to contribute to\r\nthe general tranquillity.” He was also to sound the Prussian monarch\r\nas to the inclusion of other Powers, especially Sweden and Denmark;\r\nbut discussions on this matter were not to stand in the way of the\r\nsignature of the treaty.[604] George III, now a firm supporter of peace\r\nprinciples, favoured the scheme, as appears from his letter of the same\r\ndate to the Princess of Orange. He there stated that he approved of\r\nan alliance with Prussia, though there might not be time to gain the\r\nadhesion of other States; and he expressed the hope that this compact\r\nwould lead Austria and France to desire the continuance of peace, and\r\nthereby conduce to the termination of war in the East.[605]\r\n\r\nFortified by these opinions of the King and Cabinet, Harris prepared to\r\nplay the game boldly. His handsome person, grand air, and consciousness\r\nof former victories gave him an advantage in the discussions with\r\nFrederick William, who, thanks to the tact of the Princess, laid aside\r\nhis earlier prepossessions against the “dictator,” and entered into his\r\nviews. In order to keep the impressionable monarch free from disturbing\r\ninfluences, Harris paid the sum of 200 ducats to a chamberlain if he\r\nwould ensure the exclusion of a noted partisan of France, Colonel\r\nStein, from the royal chamber during a critical stage in the healing\r\nprocess. The climax came during a ball on 12–13th June. After midnight\r\nthe King sought out Harris, invited him to walk in the garden, admitted\r\nthe force of his arguments in favour of an immediate signature of the\r\nproposed treaty, and allowed him to speak to his Minister, Alvensleben.\r\nWhile fireworks blazed and courtiers danced, the two Ministers drew\r\nup a provisional treaty, to which the King assented on the following\r\nmorning, 13th June 1788.\r\n\r\nThe news of the signature of the Provisional Treaty of Loo was received\r\nat Berlin with an outburst of rage, when it appeared that nearly all\r\nthe aims and safeguards striven for by Ministers and Francophiles had\r\ndisappeared. Further negotiations ensued at Berlin; but they brought\r\nno material change to the Loo compact. The treaty signed at Berlin by\r\nHertzberg and Ewart on 13th August 1788 was defensive in character.\r\nEach State promised to help the other, in case of attack, by a force of\r\n20,000 men; but Great Britain was not to use such a force of Prussians\r\noutside Europe or even at Gibraltar. That contingent might be increased\r\nif need arose; or it might be replaced by a money equivalent. As was\r\nstipulated at Loo, the two Powers pledged themselves to uphold the\r\nintegrity of the United Provinces and of their present constitution,\r\nand to defend that State by all possible means, in case of attack,\r\nthe Dutch also affording armed help to either ally, if it were\r\nattacked. Two secret articles were added to the Berlin Treaty, the one\r\nstipulating that no military aid should be given to the party attacked\r\nunless the latter had on foot at least 44,000 men; the second provided\r\nthat a British fleet should assist Prussia if the latter applied for\r\nit.[606]\r\n\r\nThus was formed an imposing league. The splendid army of Prussia,\r\nbacked by the fleets and resources of Great Britain and the Dutch\r\nRepublic, constituted a force which during three years was to maintain\r\npeace and assure the future of the smaller States. If we remember the\r\nstate of woeful isolation of England up to the summer of 1787, the\r\ncontrast in her position a year later is startling. It came about owing\r\nto the caution of Pitt in a time when precipitate action would have\r\nmarred everything. His wise delay in the early stages of the Dutch\r\ncrisis, and his diplomatic coyness in the bargaining with Prussia are\r\nalike admirable.[607] The British envoys, Ewart and Harris (Keith at\r\nVienna deserves also to be named) were men of unusual capacity and\r\ncourage; but then as now success depended mainly on the chief; and it\r\nhas been shown that the guiding hand at Whitehall was that of Pitt.\r\n\r\nHis diplomatic triumphs recorded in this chapter were to have a marked\r\ninfluence on the future of Europe. It is not generally known how acute\r\nwas the danger arising from the schemes of Catharine II and Joseph\r\nII. In popular imagination the premonitory rumblings of the French\r\nRevolution rivet the attention of the world to the exclusion of all\r\nelse; but a perusal of the letters of statesmen shows that nine-tenths\r\nof their time were given to thwarting the plans of the imperial\r\nrevolutionists. In truth French democracy could not have gained its\r\nrapid and easy triumphs had not the monarchies of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope shaken the old order of things to its base, so that even the\r\nintelligent conservatism of Pitt failed to uphold the historic fabric\r\nfrom the attacks that came from the East and the West. Well was it for\r\nGreat Britain that her diplomatic position was fully assured by the\r\nautumn of the year 1788. For at that time lunacy beset her monarch,\r\nparalyzed her executive government, and threatened to place her\r\nfortunes at the mercy of a dissolute prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCE OF WALES\r\n\r\n  Our Ministers like gladiators live;\r\n  ’Tis half their business blows to ward or give.\r\n  The good their virtue would effect, or sense,\r\n  Dies between exigents and self-defence.\r\n\r\n                                              POPE.\r\n\r\n    He [the Prince of Wales] has so effeminate a mind as to counteract\r\n    his own good qualities, by having no control over his weaknesses.\r\n\r\n                          THE EARL OF MALMESBURY, _Diaries_, iv, 33.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Prime Minister of Great Britain needs to be an intellectual Proteus.\r\nBesides determining the lines of foreign and domestic policy, he must\r\nregulate the movements of a complex parliamentary machine, ever taking\r\ninto account personal prejudices which not seldom baffle the most\r\ncareful forecast. It is not surprising, therefore, to find statesmen at\r\nWestminster often slow and hesitating even when there is need of prompt\r\ndecision. The onlooker may see only the public questions at issue. The\r\nman in the thick of the maze may all the time be holding the personal\r\nclue which alone can bring him to the open. How often has the fate of\r\nEurope turned on the foibles or favouritism of Queen Elizabeth, Louis\r\nXIV, Queen Anne, Charles XII, Catharine II. In the present age this\r\nfactor counts for less than of yore. Hence it comes about that many\r\nmodern critics assess the career of Pitt as if he were in the position\r\nof a Gladstone. In point of fact he was more under royal control than\r\nWalpole or Godolphin. He had to do with a Sovereign who in the last\r\nresort gave the law to his Ministers, and occasionally treated them\r\nlike head clerks.\r\n\r\nTrue, George III interfered with Pitt less than with his predecessors.\r\nThat masterful will had been somewhat tamed during the “bondage” to the\r\nCoalition, and almost perforce accepted the guidance of his deliverer.\r\nThe King even allowed Pitt to go his own way respecting Reform,\r\nWarren Hastings, and the Irish Commercial Treaty. Family scandals and\r\nfamily debts for a time overshadowed all other considerations, a fact\r\nwhich goes far to explain the bourgeois domesticity of his outlook\r\non Dutch affairs. In these years, then, he acquiesced in the lead of\r\nthe heaven-sent Minister who maintained the national credit and the\r\nnational honour. But in the last resort George III not only reigned but\r\ngoverned. Thus, apart from the Eastern War, which we shall consider\r\nlater, everything portended a time of calm in the year 1788, when\r\nsuddenly the personal element obtruded itself. There fell upon the\r\nmonarch a strange malady which threatened to bring confusion in place\r\nof order, and to enthrone a Prince who was the embodiment of faction\r\nand extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe career of the Prince of Wales illustrates the connection often\r\nsubsisting between the extremes of virtue and vice. Not seldom the\r\nlatter may be traced to the excess of the former in some primly\r\nuninteresting home; and certainly the Prince, who saw the light on 12th\r\nAugust 1762, might serve to point the moral against pedantic anxiety\r\non the part of the unco’ guid. His upbringing by the strictest of\r\nfathers in the most methodized of households early helped to call out\r\nand strengthen the tendencies to opposition which seemed ingrained in\r\nthe heirs-apparent of that stubborn stock. In the dull life at Kew or\r\nWindsor, bristling with rules and rebukes, may we not see the working\r\nin miniature of those untoward influences--fussy control and austere\r\ndomination--which wearied out the patience of Ministers and the loyalty\r\nof colonists?\r\n\r\nMoreover this royal precisian was not blessed with a gracious\r\nconsort. Queen Charlotte’s youthful experiences at the ducal Court of\r\nMecklenburg predisposed her to strict control and unsparing parsimony.\r\nMany were the jests as to her stamping with her signet the butter left\r\nover at meals. It was even affirmed that apple charlottes owed their\r\nname to her custom of using up the spare crusts of every day. These\r\nslanders (for the latter story fails before the touchstone of the term\r\n_Charlotte Russe_) owed their popularity largely to her ugliness.\r\nOne of her well-wishers, Colonel Disbrowe, once expressed to Croker\r\nthe hope that the bloom of her ugliness was going off.[608] This sin\r\nrevealed a multitude of others; and it is fairly certain that Queen\r\nCharlotte has been hardly judged. Some there were who accused her of\r\ncallousness towards the King during his insanity; and the charge seems\r\nin part proven for the year 1804.[609] Others, again, charged her\r\nwith unmotherly treatment of the Prince of Wales. Who can suffice for\r\nthese things? Aristophanes coined a happy phrase to denote lovers of\r\nthe trivial in politics. He calls them “buzzers-in-corners.” Those who\r\nessay to write the life of a great statesman must avoid those nooks.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain. The Prince of Wales grew to dislike both his\r\nfather and mother. His temperament was far gayer and more romantic than\r\ntheirs. Some imaginative persons have ventured to assert that a more\r\ngenerous and sympathetic training would have moulded him to a fine type\r\nof manhood. Undoubtedly his education was of the narrow kind which had\r\nstunted the nature of George III; and when the King, with ingrained\r\nobstinacy, continued to keep the trammels on the high-spirited youth\r\nof eighteen, he burst them asunder. At that age the Prince had his\r\nfirst amour (was it his first?), namely, with the actress, “Perdita”\r\nRobinson.[610] The gilded youth of London, long weary of the primness\r\nof Windsor, cheered him on to further excesses, and Carlton House set\r\nthe tone of the age. In vain did the King seek to regain the confidence\r\nand affection of his son.[611] His efforts were repulsed; and the\r\ndebasing influence of Henry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, inured the\r\nPrince to every kind of debauchery.\r\n\r\nAs if this were not enough, the heir to the throne made a bosom friend\r\nof the man whom his father most detested, Charles James Fox. Through\r\nthat charming libertine the Prince became an _habitué_ of the Whig\r\nClub, Brooks’s;[612] and, as we have seen, he helped to defeat the\r\nKing’s eager electioneering in the great fight of 1784 at Westminster.\r\nThenceforth the feud between father and son was bitter and persistent.\r\nThe Prince had all his father’s wilfulness, and far more than his stock\r\nof selfishness. So far as is known, he showed no sign of repentance,\r\nbut argued himself into the belief that the King had always hated him\r\nfrom his seventh year onward.[613] There is nothing that corroborates\r\nthis petulant assertion. The King had been a kind and even doting\r\nfather, his chief fault being that of guiding too long and too closely\r\nthis wayward nature.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1783 the quarrel had waxed warm on the subject of the\r\nimmorality and extravagance of the Prince. At that time the Coalition\r\nMinistry startled the King by proposing to grant the sum of £100,000\r\na year to the Prince of Wales, exclusive of the revenues of the Duchy\r\nof Cornwall, which amounted to about £13,000 a year.[614] The King,\r\nhaving formerly received far less than that amount, considered it\r\nexorbitant. As we saw in Chapter VI, the Ministry would probably have\r\nfallen had not the Prince required his favourite to waive the proposal.\r\nParliament then voted £30,000 to pay his debts, £30,000 to start his\r\nnew establishment (Carlton House) and £50,000 a year out of the Civil\r\nList.\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of the next year the Prince defiantly proposed to travel\r\nabroad in order to ease his finances by evading his creditors. This\r\nthe King forbade, and requested him to send in a detailed list of his\r\nexpenses and debts. The result was a statement clear enough in most\r\nitems, but leaving a sum of £25,000 unaccounted for. The King required\r\nan explanation of this, which the Prince as firmly refused to give,\r\nthough he assured Sir James Harris it was a debt of honour. As the King\r\nrefused to pass this sum, the whole matter dragged on, until in April\r\n1785 the debts reached the total of £160,000. To escape the discomforts\r\nof his position, the Prince proposed to his friend, Harris, who was\r\nthen in London, a term of residence at The Hague. The true reason for\r\nthis proposal lies in the fact that the Prince had for some time been\r\ndesperately in love with a fair young widow, Mrs. Fitzherbert, who\r\nwas a Roman Catholic. In vain had he wounded himself as a sign of his\r\nundying passion for her: in vain had four of his friends sought to\r\ninveigle her into a mock marriage. In order to escape his importunities\r\nshe had fled to the Continent; and the King refused him permission to\r\npursue her.\r\n\r\nHere, in truth, was the crux of the relations between father and son.\r\nKing George saw no hope for the youth but in marriage with a Protestant\r\nprincess. Prince George as firmly declared that he would not marry\r\n“some German frow,” and racked his brains with designs to secure the\r\nRoman Catholic of his choice. Mrs. Fitzherbert’s religion, her position\r\nas a commoner, and the anomaly of a morganatic marriage in these\r\nislands, rendered any connection with her odious in the eyes of the\r\nKing. Besides, the Royal Marriage Act of 1772 forbade the marriage of\r\nany prince or princess of the blood under the age of twenty-six without\r\nthe consent of the King. On all sides, then, the King had the Prince in\r\nhis toils.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, realizing this fact, seems to have behaved as recklessly\r\nas possible in the hope of compelling the King to allow him to live\r\nabroad and marry Mrs. Fitzherbert. Such at least is the most charitable\r\nexplanation of his early prodigalities. The debts, surely, were a means\r\nof forcing the hand of his father. But George was not to be gulled\r\nin this way. He, too, held firmly to his views, and the result was a\r\nhopeless deadlock. Pitt and Carmarthen sought to end it in May 1785.\r\nThey threw out hints to Harris that the income of the Prince might be\r\nincreased by Parliament if he would become reconciled to the King,\r\ncease to be a party man, and set about the discharge of his debts.\r\nAccordingly Harris waited on the Prince at Carlton House on 23rd May\r\n1785, and suggested that on these conditions the Ministry would double\r\nhis income, provided also that he set apart £50,000 a year for the\r\ndischarge of his debts. To this the Prince demurred, on the ground that\r\nhe could not desert Fox, and that the King’s unfatherly hatred would be\r\nan obstacle to any such proposal. In support of the latter statement he\r\nrequested Harris to read the King’s letters to him, which were couched\r\nin severe terms, reprobating his extravagance and dissipation.\r\n\r\nWe cannot censure this severity. The gluttonous orgies of Carlton\r\nHouse were a public scandal, especially in hard times, when Parliament\r\nwithheld the money necessary for the protection of Portsmouth and\r\nPlymouth. Both as a patriot and a father, George was justified in\r\ncondemning his son’s conduct; and it is clear that the hatred of the\r\nPrince for his father led him to put the worst possible construction on\r\nthe advice from Windsor. At the close of his interview with Harris he\r\ndeclared vehemently that he never would marry, and that he had settled\r\nwith his brother Frederick, Duke of York, for the Crown to devolve on\r\nhis heirs.[615]\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the relations of father and son, I may quote an\r\nunpublished letter from Hugh Elliot to Pitt, dated Brighthelmstone,\r\n17th October 1785, and endorsed by Pitt--“Shewn to the King.”[616] In\r\nit Elliot states that he went to Brighton merely for bathing, but was\r\nsoon honoured by the Prince’s company and confidence. He had combated\r\nseveral of his prejudices, and this had not offended him; but the\r\nPrince asked him to discuss matters with the King’s Ministers, who\r\nwould then report to the King. He then adds:\r\n\r\n    There is so much difficulty in putting upon paper the secret\r\n    circumstances I have learnt, or in detailing the imminent danger\r\n    to which H.R.H. is exposed from a manner of life that can be\r\n    thoroughly understood only by those who are eye-witnesses of it,\r\n    that, out of respect to the Prince, I shall be justified in not\r\n    dwelling upon so distressing a subject, but that I may be allowed\r\n    to advance, that in my opinion H.R.H. risks being lost to himself,\r\n    his family and his country if a total and sudden change does not\r\n    take place. I will even venture to add that the Prince is at this\r\n    moment not insensible that such a change is necessary and that\r\n    it is one of the motives which make him desirous of visiting the\r\n    Continent under such restrictions as the King may think proper to\r\n    advise.\r\n\r\nElliot adds that the Prince would travel only with Colonels Lee and\r\nSlaughter and himself, if the King and Pitt approved of his going with\r\nhim. The Prince hoped to economize and so win back the good opinion of\r\nthe King and country. He (Elliot) would rejoice if he could further\r\nthis course.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the Prince for foreign travel ended with the return of\r\nMrs. Fitzherbert from her secret tour. The Prince’s pursuit of her now\r\nbecame more eager than ever, and he succeeded in inspiring her with\r\nfeelings of love. Consequently, on 15th December 1785, he secretly\r\nmarried her, having four days previously assured his bosom friend,\r\nFox, that there was no “ground for these reports which of late have\r\nbeen so malevolently circulated.” It is now proved beyond possibility\r\nof doubt that the marriage was legal (except in the political sense\r\nabove noticed), and that the Prince did his wife grievous wrong in\r\npersistently denying the fact.[617] She, with all the proofs in her\r\npossession, refrained from compromising him, and therefore had to\r\nendure endless slights. Many persons had the good sense to place her\r\ndignified silence far above his unblushing denials, and Society was\r\nrent in twain by the great question--“Was he married or not?” In view\r\nof these facts, is it desirable to present a full-length portrait of\r\nHis Royal Highness? The wonder is that even in his Perdita days his\r\nname could ever be compared with the tenderest and most faithful of\r\nShakespeare’s lovers, Prince Florizel. That he allowed himself to be\r\npainted in that guise argues singular assurance. Was not Cloten more\r\nnearly his prototype?\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know whether the King and Queen were aware\r\nof the secret marriage. The Queen in a private interview pressed him\r\nto tell the truth; but he probably equivocated. Their action bespeaks\r\nperplexity. In private they treated Mrs. Fitzherbert kindly, but never\r\nreceived her at Court.[618] That Pitt was not ill-informed on the\r\nsubject appears from the following hitherto unpublished letter from his\r\nbrother, the Earl of Chatham. It is undated, but probably belongs to\r\nthe month of December 1785:\r\n\r\n                                             Hanley, Wednesday.[619]\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n    I have had a good deal of conversation with Sir C---- on the\r\n    subject you wished some information upon. The result of which\r\n    leaves no doubt on my mind of the P[rince] having not only offered\r\n    to marry Mrs. F., but taken measures towards its accomplishment.\r\n    Many circumstances confirm this opinion, but this much is, I think,\r\n    certain information, which is that the letters from the P. offering\r\n    it were shown by himself to Mrs. S---- L----, the mother, from whom\r\n    Sir Carnaby has it immediately, and the letter from Mrs. F. to her\r\n    mother, in which she informs her of her consent. Sir C---- has seen\r\n    an extract of, and is promised a copy of [it], which I shall see.\r\n    It must, however, I think, still remain very doubtful, till the\r\n    step is absolutely taken, whether it ever will, or whether it is\r\n    more than a last effort to gain her without; but Sir C. and all\r\n    her family seem perfectly convinced that he seriously and at all\r\n    events intends it. They are averse to it; but the person in the\r\n    P’^s confidence upon it and most employed in it is Mr. Errington,\r\n    husband of Lady Broughton. He is supposed to be the person who is\r\n    to go over as her relation to be present at the ceremony. I have\r\n    endeavoured to learn what I cou’d as to the point of whether she\r\n    wou’d change her religion or not. She at present says she will not;\r\n    but Sir C---- seems to think that she might be brought to that\r\n    whenever the marriage was declared. The present intention seems to\r\n    be that it should be kept secret, but that, her conscience thus\r\n    satisfied, she is to appear, and be received as, his mistress; and\r\n    I believe it is pretty certain that he has a promise from a certain\r\n    duchess to visit her and go about with her when she comes....\r\n\r\nClearly the Earl of Chatham came very near the truth. Sir Carnaby\r\nHaggerston knew the secret, and chose to reveal a good deal of it.\r\nMr. Errington was the bride’s uncle, and gave her away at the secret\r\nceremony at her house in Park Lane on 15th December.[620] The Duchess\r\nof Devonshire early recognized Mrs. Fitzherbert, and frequently\r\nentertained her along with the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe _liaison_ with Mrs. Fitzherbert (for it was ostensibly nothing\r\nmore) of course did not lessen expenses at Carlton House. The Prince\r\ninsisted on her moving to a larger residence and entertaining on a\r\nlavish scale. As for Carlton House, it “exhibited a perpetual scene\r\nof excess, unrestrained by any wise superintendence.”[621] It was\r\ntherefore natural that the Prince’s friends should ply Parliament with\r\nrequests for larger funds in the spring of 1786. The matter came up,\r\nnot inappropriately, during debates on the deficiency in the Civil\r\nList. That most brilliant of wits and most genial of boon companions,\r\nRichard Brinsley Sheridan, had now espoused the Prince’s cause. With\r\nhis customary charm he dragged in the subject of the monetary woes\r\nof his patron, pointing out that the dignity of the Crown demanded\r\nan ampler provision and the payment of the existing debts. Pitt\r\nreplied that this matter was not before the House, and added that, as\r\nhe had received no instructions on the subject, he would not be so\r\npresumptuous as to offer any private opinion on it.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by this freezing rebuke to Sheridan, Fox on the next\r\nday raised the same question, maintaining that it was a national\r\nadvantage for the Heir-Apparent to be able to live not merely in\r\nease but in splendour. This patriotic appeal fell on deaf ears. The\r\ncountry gentlemen who on the score of expense had lately decided to\r\nleave Portsmouth and Plymouth open to attack, were not likely to\r\nvote away on the orgies of Carlton House an extra sum of £50,000 a\r\nyear, which in fourteen years would have made the two great dockyard\r\ntowns impregnable. Fox wisely refrained from pressing his demand, and\r\nvouchsafed no explanation as to how the nation would benefit from the\r\nencouragement of extravagance in Pall Mall.[622] Clearly the Prince’s\r\nfriends were in a hopeless minority. Accordingly he began more stoutly\r\nthan ever to deny his marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert; but in such a\r\ncase character counts for more than oaths and asseverations.\r\n\r\nSo the miserable affair dragged on. The King refused every request\r\nfor help for the Prince, doubtless in the hope that debt would compel\r\nhim to give up his mistress. The debts therefore grew apace, until\r\nin the summer of 1786 Carlton House was in danger of being seized by\r\nthe brokers. It is clear that Pitt sided with the King. George III\r\nfrequently commended him for his wise advice; but unfortunately nearly\r\nall the letters from Pitt to his sovereign, especially on this topic,\r\nlong ago disappeared from the Library at Windsor, a highly suspicious\r\ncircumstance. We know, however, that, as early as March and April 1785,\r\nthe King approved the messages drawn up by Pitt from the Sovereign to\r\nthe Prince. In general they seem to have been drafted by the Minister;\r\nand the following draft, in Pitt’s writing, but dated by the King\r\nand with one slight correction, remains as proof that Pitt was the\r\nmouthpiece for the royal rebukes. It is endorsed “Draft of Letter from\r\nthe King to the Prince of Wales”:\r\n\r\n                                       WINDSOR, _July 8, 1786_.[623]\r\n\r\n    After so often repeating to the Prince of Wales the same sentiments\r\n    on the subject of his applications, and with so little effect,\r\n    I should add nothing further at present. But I must express my\r\n    surprise at receiving a letter from him in which he states himself\r\n    to be convinced that he has no reason to expect either at present\r\n    or in future the smallest assistance from me. A reference to\r\n    my last letter[624] and to the former correspondence might shew\r\n    him what it was I expected before I could enter further on the\r\n    consideration of the business. If he chooses to interpret what has\r\n    passed into a refusal on my part to take measures in any case for\r\n    his assistance, the consequence of his doing so can be imputed only\r\n    to his own determination.[625]\r\n\r\nThat the details of the expenditure at Carlton House were laid before\r\nPitt is clear from the evidence contained in the Pitt Papers. The\r\npacket entitled “Prince of Wales’s Debts,” affords piquant reading.\r\nFor, be it remembered, at the very time when Pitt was straining every\r\nnerve to lessen the National Debt, to rebuild the navy, and to enable\r\nEngland to look her enemies once more in the face, the Prince was\r\nsquandering money on rare wines, on gilding, ormolu, and on jewellery\r\nfor Mrs. Fitzherbert, £54,000 being considered a “not unreasonable\r\nbill” by her latest biographer.[626] An official estimate fixes the\r\ntotal expenditure of the Prince for the years 1784–86 at £369,977 (or\r\nat the rate of £123,000 a year) and yet there were “arrears not yet\r\nto hand.” Parliament had voted £30,000 for the furnishing of Carlton\r\nHouse; but in 1787 the Prince consulted the welfare of the nation\r\nby accepting an estimate of £49,700 for extensions and decorations;\r\nand late in 1789 he sought still further to strengthen the monarchy\r\nby spending £110,500 on further splendours. They included “a new\r\nthrone and State bed, furniture trimmed with rich gold lace, also\r\nnew decorations in the Great Hall, a Chinese Drawing-Room, etc.” The\r\nPitt Papers contain no reference to the sums spent on the Pavilion at\r\nBrighton in the years 1785, 1786; but, even in its pre-oriental form,\r\nit afforded singular proof of the desire of the Prince for quiet and\r\neconomy at that watering-place.\r\n\r\nMuch has been made of the retrenchments of July 1786, when the works\r\non Carlton House were suspended, and the half of that palatial\r\nresidence was closed. Whatever were the motives that prompted that\r\nnew development, it soon ceased, as the foregoing figures have shown.\r\nThe Prince’s necessities being as great as ever, he found means to\r\nbring his case before Parliament in the debates of 20th, 24th, and\r\n27th April 1787. Thereupon Pitt clearly hinted that the inquiry, if\r\nmade at all, must be made thoroughly, and that he would in that case\r\nbe most reluctantly driven “to the disclosure of circumstances which\r\nhe should otherwise think it his duty to conceal.” The House quivered\r\nwith excitement at the untactful utterance--one of Pitt’s few mistakes\r\nin Parliament. Sheridan, with his usual skill and daring, took up the\r\nchallenge and virtually defied Pitt to do his worst. Pitt thereupon\r\ndeclared that he referred solely to pecuniary matters.\r\n\r\nEveryone, however, knew that the Fitzherbert question was really at\r\nstake; and the general dislike to any discussion, even on the debts,\r\nwas voiced by the heavy Devonshire squire, who was to find immortality\r\nin the “Rolliad.” Rolle asserted on 27th April that any such debate\r\nwould affect the constitution both in Church and State. Undaunted by\r\nSheridan’s salvos of wit, he stuck to his guns, with the result that on\r\nthe 30th Fox fired off a seemingly crushing discharge. As Sheridan had\r\ndeclared that the Prince in no wise shrank from the fullest inquiry,\r\nthe Whig chieftain now solemnly assured the House that the reported\r\nmarriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert was a low and malicious calumny. When\r\nthe tenacious Devonian plied him with the final inquiry whether he\r\nspoke from direct authority, Fox replied with the utmost emphasis that\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nWe now know that Fox had been cruelly deceived by the Prince. But in\r\nthat age the assertion of Fox was considered as almost final, save by\r\nthose who marked the lofty scorn poured by Mrs. Fitzherbert on her\r\nunwitting traducer. In Parliament the victory lay with the Prince; but\r\neven there Rolle firmly refused to comply with Sheridan’s challenging\r\nrequest and declare himself satisfied. To the outside world it was\r\nclear that either the heir to the throne or Fox had lied.\r\n\r\nThe letters of George III to Pitt in May 1787 and Pitt’s suggestions\r\nfor a settlement of the dispute, show that the perturbed monarch placed\r\nabsolute confidence in his Minister. Very noteworthy is the King’s\r\nassertion that there could be no reconciliation until his son consented\r\nto marry and to retrench his expenditure. His letter of 20th May 1787\r\nto Pitt further proves that the proposal to add £10,000 to the Prince’s\r\nincome emanated from Pitt, and was acquiesced in somewhat reluctantly\r\nby the King.[627]\r\n\r\nThis expedient brought about a partial reconciliation between father\r\nand son. On the strong recommendation of Pitt, Parliament allowed the\r\nextra £10,000 a year, besides granting £20,000 on behalf of the new\r\nworks at Carlton House, and paying £161,000 towards the extinction of\r\nthe Prince’s debts, on his express assurance that he would not exceed\r\nhis income in the future. The vote was unanimous. Thereupon the King\r\nwaived the question of the Prince’s marriage; so at least we may infer\r\nfrom the fact that they had a long interview on 25th May 1787 at the\r\nQueen’s House (Buckingham House), at the close of which the Prince\r\nproceeded to greet his mother and sisters. The parents had few happier\r\ndays than that; and their joy was crowned a little later by the return\r\nof Frederick, Duke of York, after a long residence in Germany. Fanny\r\nBurney describes the radiant gladness of the King and Queen as they\r\npaced along the terrace at Windsor with their soldier son; and the\r\ninhabitants of the royal city crowded to witness the pleasing scene.\r\nIt speaks well for the Prince of Wales, that he posted off from\r\nBrighton on the news of his brother’s home-coming, in order to double\r\nthe pleasure of his parents. For a time, too, the Prince thought more\r\nkindly of Pitt; so we may infer from the statement of St. Leger to the\r\nMarquis of Buckingham that his feelings towards him had altered since\r\nthe negotiation on the subject of his debts.[628] But these sentiments\r\nof gratitude soon vanished along with the virtuous and economical mood\r\nof which they were the outcome. Those who break their word naturally\r\nhate the man to whom they had pledged it.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1787–8 the two Princes again abandoned themselves to\r\ndrinking and gambling. The dead set made against Pitt over the Warren\r\nHastings trial and Indian affairs so far weakened his position that\r\nthe Princes counted on his fall and hoped for the advent to power of\r\nthe Fox-Sheridan clique. Certain it is that they drank and played very\r\ndeep. General Grant, writing to Cornwallis, 6th April 1788, says:\r\n\r\n    The Prince [of Wales] has taught the Duke [of York] to _drink_ in\r\n    the most liberal and copious way; and the Duke in return has been\r\n    equally successful in teaching his brother to lose his money at\r\n    all sorts of play--_Quinze_, Hazard, &c--to the amount, as we are\r\n    told, of very large sums in favour of India General Smith[629] and\r\n    Admiral Pigot who both wanted it very much. These play parties have\r\n    chiefly taken place at a new club formed this winter by the Prince\r\n    of Wales in opposition to Brooks’s, because Tarleton and Jack\r\n    Payne, proposed by H.R.H., were blackballed.[630]\r\n\r\nAt this new club, called the Dover House or Welzie’s club, the Prince\r\noften won or lost £2,000 or £3,000 at a sitting. In other ways\r\nFrederick sought to better his brother’s example, so that his company\r\nwas thought _mauvais ton_ by young nobles.[631]\r\n\r\nCompared with these buffooneries, political opposition was a small\r\nmatter. But the King deeply resented the nagging tactics of his son\r\nat any time of crisis. Such a time came in March 1788, when a sharp\r\ndispute arose between Pitt and the East India Company. It originated\r\nin the Dutch troubles of the previous summer. The prospect of war with\r\nFrance was so acute that the India Board sent out four regiments in\r\norder to strengthen the British garrisons in India. At the time the\r\nDirectors of the Company fully approved of this step; but when the\r\nwar-cloud blew over, they objected to pay the bill. Pitt insisted that\r\nthe India Act of 1784 made them liable for the transport of troops when\r\nthe Board judged it necessary; and in February 1788 he brought in a\r\nDeclaratory Bill to that effect.\r\n\r\nAt once the Company flung to the winds all sense of gratitude to its\r\nsaviour, and made use of the men who four years previously had sought\r\nits destruction. Fox and Erskine figured as its champions, and the\r\nPrince of Wales primed the latter well with brandy before he went in to\r\nattack Pitt. The result was a lamentable display of Billingsgate, of\r\nwhich Pitt took no notice, and the Ministry triumphed by 242 against\r\n118 (3rd March).\r\n\r\nBut the clamour raised against the measure had more effect two nights\r\nlater, when Fox dared Pitt to try the case in a court of law. Instead\r\nof replying, Pitt feebly remarked that he desired to postpone his\r\nanswer to a later stage of the debates. This amazing torpor was\r\nascribed to a temporary indisposition; but only the few were aware that\r\nthe Prime Minister had drunk deeply the previous night at the Marquis\r\nof Buckingham’s house in Pall Mall in the company of Dundas and the\r\nDuchess of Gordon--that spirited lady whose charms are immortalized in\r\nthe song, “Jenny o’ Menteith.”[632] Wit and joviality were now replaced\r\nby a heaviness that boded ill for the Ministry, whose majority sank\r\nto fifty-seven. Two days later, however, Pitt pulled himself and his\r\nparty together, accepted certain amendments relating to patronage, but\r\ncrushed his opponents on the main issue. To the annoyance of the Prince\r\nof Wales and Fox, the Government emerged triumphant from what had\r\nseemed to be certain disaster. Wraxall never wrote a truer word than\r\nwhen he ascribed Pitt’s final triumph to his character. Even in his\r\ntemporary retreat he had commanded respect, so that Burke, who hurried\r\nup exultingly from the Warren Hastings trial, was fain to say that the\r\nPrime Minister scattered his ashes with dignity and wore his sackcloth\r\nlike a robe of purple.\r\n\r\nThe prestige of the Ministry shone once more with full radiance on the\r\nBudget night (5th May 1788). Pitt pointed out that the past year had\r\nbeen a time of exceptional strain. The Dutch crisis and the imminence\r\nof war with France had entailed preparations which cost nearly\r\n£1,200,000. The relief of the Prince of Wales absorbed in all £181,000.\r\nThe sum of £7,000,000 had been expended in the last four years on\r\nimprovements in the naval service. He had raised no loan and imposed\r\nno new taxes. Nevertheless, the sum of £2,500,000 had been written\r\noff from the National Debt, and even so, there was a slight surplus\r\nof £17,000. The condition of the finances of France supplied the\r\nMinister with a telling contrast. It was well known that, despite many\r\nretrenchments, the deficit amounted to £2,300,000. In these financial\r\nstatements we may discern the cause of the French Revolution and of the\r\norderly development of England.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Fox and Sheridan seek to dissipate the hopes aroused by the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. So experienced a financier as Pulteney\r\njustified his statement, and the country at large felt assured of the\r\nadvent of a time of abounding prosperity. As for France, the inability\r\nof her statesmen, even of Necker, to avert the crisis caused by\r\nreckless borrowing and stupid taxation, seemed to be the best possible\r\nguarantee for peace. Pitt’s concern at the re-appointment of Necker in\r\nAugust 1788 appears in a letter to Grenville in which he describes it\r\nas almost the worst event that could happen--a curious remark which\r\nshows how closely he connected the power of a State with its financial\r\nprosperity.[633] Thus the year 1788 wore on, with deepening gloom for\r\nFrance, and with every appearance of calm and happiness for the Island\r\nPower, until a mysterious malady struck down the King and involved\r\neverything in confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE REGENCY CRISIS\r\n\r\n  Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair\r\n  That thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honours\r\n  Before the hour be ripe?\r\n\r\n                        SHAKESPEARE, _Henry IV_, _Part II._\r\n\r\n    The line which bounded the royal prerogative, though in general\r\n    sufficiently clear, had not everywhere been drawn with accuracy and\r\n    distinctness.--MACAULAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes of insanity are generally obscure. In the case of George\r\nIII the disease cannot be traced to a progenitor, nor did it descend\r\nto his issue, unless the moral perversity of his sons be regarded as\r\na form of mental obliquity. It is highly probable that the conduct\r\nof the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York produced in their father\r\na state of nervous tension conducive to, if not the actual cause of,\r\nmadness. No proof of this is possible; but having regard to the King’s\r\ndespotic temper, his love of plain living, and his horror of gambling\r\nand debauchery, we may plausibly refer to a private cause the sudden\r\nbreakdown of a strong constitution at a time when public affairs had\r\nbecome singularly calm.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer of 1788 he became steadily weaker. A stay at\r\nCheltenham was of no avail. Indeed, an enemy of that place tried to\r\nassign the King’s malady solely to its waters. The King had to forego\r\nthe long walks and rides which had formerly tired out all his suite;\r\nand in October he returned to Kew much aged and broken. Nevertheless\r\nthe indomitable will asserted itself in one curious detail. He always\r\nremained standing during interviews with his Ministers; and he is\r\nstated by George Rose to have kept on his feet for three hours and\r\nforty minutes during a portentous interview with Pitt, which must have\r\nstrained his strength to the breaking point.[634] At the levee of 24th\r\nOctober at St. James’s, he made a praiseworthy effort to appear well in\r\norder “to stop further lies and any fall of the stocks.” But the effort\r\nwas too great, as Pitt perceived afterwards during a private interview.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the following day the King removed to Windsor. There\r\nthe decline in health continued, so that, after attending a hunt, he\r\nexclaimed to Lady Effingham: “My dear Effy, you see me all at once an\r\nold man.”[635] Even so he continued his correspondence with Pitt much\r\nas usual, until on 5th November there came a sudden collapse.\r\n\r\nAgain we have to confess ignorance as to the final cause. Mrs.\r\nPapendiek, wife of the royal barber, ascribes it to the King’s\r\nannoyance at the endeavour of the Duke of York to introduce Turkish\r\nmilitary instruments into the band of the Guards. Rose mentions a\r\ndiscussion with the Duke at dinner on the 5th, relative to a murder.\r\nAll, however, are agreed that the merest trifles had long sufficed to\r\nmake the King flurried and angry, as had frequently appeared during\r\nthe drives with the princesses. This peculiarity now suddenly rose to\r\nthe point where madness begins. It is even said that at that dinner\r\nhe without provocation suddenly rushed at the Prince of Wales, pinned\r\nhim to the wall, and dared him to contradict the King of England.\r\nThe Prince burst into tears, the Queen became hysterical, and it was\r\nwith some difficulty that the King was induced to retire to his room.\r\nDuring that evening and night he raved incessantly, and the chief\r\nphysician, Sir George Baker, feared for his life. A curious incident\r\nis mentioned by Mrs. Papendiek. She avers that on the following night\r\nthe King arose, took a candle, and went to look at the Queen as she\r\nslept. She awoke in an agony of terror, whereupon he soothed her and\r\nseemed to take comfort himself. We may doubt the authenticity of the\r\nincident, as also the correctness of Mrs. Papendiek’s narrative when\r\nshe describes the offensive air of authority which the Prince of Wales\r\nat once assumed, his demand of an interview with the Queen, even on\r\npolitical affairs, and his striking the floor with his stick to express\r\ndispleasure.[636]\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that the behaviour of the Prince was far\r\nfrom seemly. He took the direction of affairs in the palace with an\r\nabruptness which caused the Queen much pain. “Nothing was done but by\r\nhis orders,” wrote Miss Burney; “the Queen interfered not in anything.\r\nShe lived entirely in her two new rooms, and spent the whole day in\r\npatient sorrow and retirement with her daughters.” Worst of his acts,\r\nperhaps, was the taking possession of the King’s papers, a proceeding\r\nwhich his apologists pass over in discreet silence. Among those\r\ndocuments, we may note, were several which proved that Pitt had not\r\nseldom drafted the royal rebukes. In other respects the exultation\r\nof the Prince at least wore the veil of decency, therein comparing\r\nfavourably with the joy coarsely expressed by his followers at Brooks’s\r\nClub.[637]\r\n\r\nSecret intrigues for assuring the triumph of the Whigs began at once.\r\nIt is significant that that veteran schemer, the Lord Chancellor,\r\nThurlow, proceeded to Windsor on 6th November, at the Prince’s command,\r\nand dined and supped with him. The ostensible object of their meeting\r\nwas to consider the mode of treating His Majesty, who had been violent\r\nduring the night.[638] But the design of the Prince was to detach from\r\nPitt the highest legal authority in the land. To this he was instigated\r\nby Captain Payne, Comptroller of his Household, who wrote to Sheridan\r\nthat Thurlow would probably take this opportunity of breaking with his\r\ncolleagues, if they proposed to restrict the powers of the Regent.[639]\r\nPayne augured correctly. Thurlow had his scruples as to such a\r\nbetrayal; but they vanished at the suggestion that he should continue\r\nin his high office under the forthcoming Whig Ministry.\r\n\r\nThis bargain implied the shelving of Lord Loughborough, who for five\r\nyears had attached himself to the Whigs in the hope of gaining the\r\nwoolsack. Had Fox been in England, it is unlikely that he would have\r\nsanctioned this betrayal of a friend in order to gain over an enemy.\r\nBut, with Sheridan as go-between, and the Prince as sole arbiter,\r\nthe bargain was soon settled. Light has been thrown on these events\r\nby the publication of the Duchess of Devonshire’s Diary. In it she\r\nsays: “He [Sheridan] cannot resist playing a sly game: he cannot\r\nresist the pleasure of acting alone; and this, added to his natural\r\nwant of judgment and dislike of consultation frequently has made him\r\ncommit his friends and himself.”[640] Perhaps it was some sense of\r\nthe untrustworthiness of Sheridan which led Fox, in the midst of a\r\nContinental tour with Mrs. Armstead, to return from Bologna at a speed\r\nwhich proved to be detrimental to his health. After a journey of only\r\nnine days, he arrived in London on the 24th. It was too late to stop\r\nthe bargain with Thurlow, and he at once informed Sheridan that he had\r\nswallowed the bitter pill and felt the utmost possible uneasiness about\r\nthe whole matter.[641]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs now had a spy in the enemy’s citadel. At first Pitt was not\r\naware of the fact. The holding of several Cabinet meetings at Windsor,\r\nfor the purpose of sifting the medical evidence, enabled Thurlow to\r\nhear everything and secretly to carry the news to the Prince. Moreover,\r\nhis grief on seeing the King--at a time when the Prince’s friends knew\r\nhim to be at his worst[642]--was so heartrending that some beholders\r\nwere reminded of the description of the player in “Hamlet”:\r\n\r\n  Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,\r\n  A broken voice, and his whole function suiting\r\n  With forms to his conceit.\r\n\r\nSuch at least was the judgement of the discerning few, who, with Fanny\r\nBurney, saw more real grief in the dignified composure of Pitt after\r\nthat inevitably painful interview. Authority to “inspect” the royal\r\npatient was entrusted to Thurlow, who thus stood at the fountain head\r\nof knowledge. Yet these astute balancings and bargainings were marred\r\nby the most trivial of accidents. After one of the Cabinet Councils\r\nat Windsor, Ministers were about to return to town, when Thurlow’s\r\nhat could not be found. Search was made for it in vain in the council\r\nchamber, when at last a page came up to the assembled Ministers and\r\nexclaimed with boyish frankness: “My Lord, I found it in the cabinet\r\nof His Royal Highness.” The flush which spread over the Chancellor’s\r\nwrinkled visage doubled the effect of the boy’s unconscious\r\nhome-thrust.[643]\r\n\r\nThe question of the Regency has often been discussed on abstract\r\nconstitutional grounds. Precedents were at once hunted up, namely,\r\nthose of the years, 1326, 1377, 1422, and 1455, the last being\r\nconsidered on a par with the present case. But of course the whole\r\nquestion turned primarily on the probability of the King’s recovery.\r\nHere it should be noted that George III had been afflicted by a mental\r\nmalady for a few weeks in the year 1765, and that a Regency Bill was\r\ndrafted but the need for it vanished.[644] This fact was not widely\r\nknown, but it must have come to the knowledge of the Prince of Wales.\r\nIn view of the sound constitution and regular life of the King, there\r\nwere good grounds for hoping that he would a second time recover.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the reports of Sir George Baker, on behalf of Dr. Warren\r\nand the other physicians, as sent to Pitt, were at first discouraging.\r\nAs they have not before been published it will be well to cite them\r\nhere almost _in extenso_ from the Pitt Papers, No. 228. They are dated\r\nfrom the Queen’s Lodge, Windsor:\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 6._ 9 o’clock:--Sir George Baker presents his comp^{ts} to\r\n    Mr. Pitt. He is very sorry to inform Mr. Pitt that the King’s\r\n    delirium has continued through the whole day. There seems to\r\n    be no prospect at present of a change either for the better or\r\n    worse. H.M. is now rather in a quiet state. _Nov. 8, 1788._ 8\r\n    o’clock:--The dose of James’s powder which the King had taken\r\n    before Mr. Pitt left Windsor produced a gentle perspiration but no\r\n    diminution of the delirium; a second dose taken six hours after\r\n    the first, is now operating in the same manner but with as little\r\n    effect upon the delirium. _Nov. 10, 1788._ 8 p.m.:--H.M. has but\r\n    little fever, is very incoherent, but without vehemence or bodily\r\n    efforts, though his strength appears to be very little impaired.\r\n    _Nov. 12, 1788_:--H.M. talked in a quiet but incoherent way the\r\n    whole night and is this morning just as he was yesterday. He has\r\n    eaten a very good breakfast. _Nov. 15, 1788._ 10 p.m.:--H.M. has\r\n    been deranged the whole day, in a quiet and apparently happy way\r\n    to himself. _Nov. 16._ 10 a.m.:--This morning his discourse was\r\n    consistent, but the principle upon which it went for the most part\r\n    founded in error. _Nov. 18_, 10 a.m.:--H.M. had a good night, but\r\n    the disorder remains unabated. _Nov. 21_:--H.M. has been ... more\r\n    than once under the influence of considerable irritation. _Nov.\r\n    22._ 10 a.m.:--H.M. is entirely deranged this morning in a quiet\r\n    good humoured way. _Nov. 22_:--H.M. shewed many marks of a deluded\r\n    imagination in the course of the day. In the evening he was more\r\n    consistent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    [A letter follows from the Queen, that she consents to the calling\r\n    in Dr. Addington.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 24, 1788_:--His Majesty passed the whole day in a perfectly\r\n    maniacal state.[645] _Nov. 25, 1788_:--His Majesty was not enraged\r\n    nor surprised at the strict regimen under which he was put at\r\n    5 o’clock this evening, but grew quieter and went to bed at 9\r\n    o’clock, and is now asleep.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset Pitt viewed the case with grave concern, but by no\r\nmeans hopelessly. This will appear from the following new letters\r\nof Pitt, the former to Bishop Pretyman (Tomline), the latter to the\r\nMarquis of Buckingham:\r\n\r\n                                     Sunday, _Nov. 10, [1788]_.[646]\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR BISHOP,\r\n\r\n    You will have heard enough already of the King’s illness to make\r\n    you very uneasy. The fact is that it has hitherto found little\r\n    relief from medicine, and, what is worst of all, it is attended\r\n    with a delirium the cause of which the physicians cannot clearly\r\n    ascertain. On the whole there is some room to apprehend the\r\n    disorder may produce danger to his life, but there is no immediate\r\n    symptom of danger at present. The effect more to be dreaded is on\r\n    the understanding. If this lasts beyond a certain time it will\r\n    produce the most difficult and delicate crisis imaginable in making\r\n    provision for the Government to go on. It must, however, be yet\r\n    some weeks before that can require decision, but the interval will\r\n    be a truly anxious one....\r\n\r\n    [Private.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                               Downing Street, _Nov. 15, 1788_.[647]\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n    I have not half time [_sic_] to thank you sufficiently for your\r\n    very kind and affectionate letter, and for the communication thro’\r\n    Grenville. You will learn from him that our last accounts begin\r\n    to wear rather a more favourable aspect, tho’ there is not yet\r\n    ground for very confident hope. There is certainly now no danger to\r\n    his life, but the other alternative, which there was some danger\r\n    to apprehend, was, if possible, more distressing. It seems now\r\n    possible that a total recovery may take place, but even on the\r\n    best supposition there must still be a considerable interval of\r\n    anxiety....\r\n\r\nGrenville, a man of singularly calm and equable temperament (which\r\nprocured for him the Speakership of the House of Commons on the decease\r\nof Cornwall early in the next year) waxed indignant as he described\r\nto his brother the tactics of the Opposition. On 20th November he\r\ndeclared: “The Opposition have been taking inconceivable pains to\r\nspread the idea that his [the King’s] disorder is incurable. Nothing\r\ncan exceed Warren’s indiscretion on this subject.”[648] The conviction\r\ngained ground that the Royal physicians were in league with the Prince;\r\nand so high did feeling run that shouts were flung at them--“So much\r\nthe worse for you if he does not recover.” This exasperation of spirit\r\nwaxed apace as the jubilation of the Prince’s friends became insolently\r\npatent. Indeed more terrible than the lunacy itself was the spectacle\r\nof the intrigues to which it gave rise.\r\n\r\nAs the reports privately sent to Pitt by the physicians were far from\r\nhopeless, he determined to await developments as long as possible\r\nbefore taking any decided step. On 12th November he proposed to the\r\nPrince of Wales that Parliament, instead of meeting in the following\r\nweek, should be adjourned for a fortnight, to which there came a ready\r\nassent.[649] On the 17th he asked leave to inform the Prince of what\r\nhe proposed to do on the meeting of Parliament, but an interview was\r\nnot accorded. Eight days later the Prince inquired whether he had any\r\nproposal to make, but was answered by a polite negative. The uneasy\r\ntruce between them evidently neared its end.\r\n\r\nIn his resolve to sift to the bottom the nature of the disease and the\r\nprobability of a cure, Pitt advised the calling in of his father’s\r\ndoctor, Addington, and he carried his point. On the 28th and 29th\r\nthe Prime Minister himself saw the Monarch, who was pleased to see\r\nhim, referred to questions discussed at their last interview, and\r\nshowed incoherence chiefly in wandering incessantly from one topic\r\nto another,[650] a characteristic of the converse of polite Society,\r\nwhich, if judged severely, would warrant the consignment to Bedlam of\r\nhalf of its most cherished talkers.\r\n\r\nAll observers are agreed that the King conversed quite rationally at\r\ntimes, as was also the case in the attack of 1804.[651] Pitt therefore\r\nresolved to do nothing which would distress the King in the event\r\nof his recovery. This it was which led him to decline all idea of a\r\ncoalition with the Whigs, and to insist on restricting the authority of\r\nthe Regent in regard to personal matters on which the King laid stress.\r\nThe removal of the monarch to Kew House seems to have been the wish of\r\nthe Prince as well as of the Cabinet; and it took place without mishap\r\non 29th November.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix days later Parliament re-assembled, and rarely has it had to face\r\nproblems so novel and delicate. In contrast with other nations, England\r\nhad been singularly free from the perplexities attendant on a Regency;\r\nbut now she had to face them in an acute form. The monarch was not\r\nunpopular, and his heir was distrusted. Yet it was indisputable that,\r\nas Regent, he could choose his own Ministers; and his hatred of Pitt\r\nimplied the dismissal of that Minister and the triumph of Sheridan,\r\nFox, and the roystering set at Brooks’s. Pitt felt little doubt on this\r\npoint and calmly prepared to resume his practice at the Bar. The sequel\r\nmust have been a sharp conflict between the Prince’s friends and the\r\nnation; so that the fateful year 1789 would have seen the growth of a\r\npolitical crisis, less complex than that of France, it is true, but\r\nfully as serious as that from which the nation was saved by his timely\r\ndecease in the summer of the year 1830. All this was at stake, and\r\nmuch more. For who shall measure the worth to the nation of the frugal\r\nand virtuous life of George III, and who can count up the moral losses\r\ninflicted on the national life by his son in his brief ascendancy?\r\n\r\nThe King’s physicians having been examined by the Privy Council on 3rd\r\nDecember, their evidence was laid before Parliament on the following\r\nday. While differing at many points, they agreed that recovery was\r\npossible or even probable, but they could not assign a limit of time.\r\nAdopting a suggestion of Fox, Pitt moved for the appointment of a\r\nCommittee of the House for the examination of the physicians. It\r\ncomprised twenty-one members selected from two lists suggested by the\r\nMinistry and the Opposition. The reading out of the final list led to\r\na singular scene. Not much comment was made on the twenty names, but\r\nbefore reading out the last name, Pitt paused for a moment. At once\r\nthe Opposition raised cries of “Burke.” Still Pitt remained silent.\r\nThe cries were renewed more loudly. He then very quietly proposed\r\nLord Gower. Burke threw himself back in his seat, crossed his arms\r\nviolently, and kicked his heels with evident discomposure.[652] The\r\nannoyance of the great Irishman was natural, as Pitt had evidently\r\nprepared to inflict the slight. The Upper House appointed a similar\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe report based on this inquiry was presented by Pitt to the House\r\nof Commons on the 10th. It comprised the evidence, not only of the\r\nroyal physicians, but also of an outsider, the Rev. Dr. Francis Willis\r\nwho, during twenty-eight years had supervised some 900 cases of lunacy\r\nat his residence near Boston. Everyone admitted his success in this\r\ntrying work, which may be ascribed to the influence of a commanding\r\npersonality, and the firm and judicious treatment which he substituted\r\nfor the frequently violent methods then in vogue. He at once pronounced\r\nthe case far from hopeless; and, if we may trust the stories told of\r\nthe King and his new physician, there was even at the outset very much\r\nof method in the madness. Thus, on being informed that Willis was\r\na clergyman, the patient remarked that he could not approve of his\r\ntaking to the practice of medicine. This drew from Willis the remark\r\nthat Christ went about healing the sick, whereupon the retort at once\r\nfollowed--“Yes; but I never heard that he had £700 a year for doing\r\nso.” The acuteness of the King’s faculties also appears in his remark\r\nthat a letter which he had written to the Queen would not reach her, as\r\nhis recent missive to the Duke of York had not been answered. Thereupon\r\nWillis offered to take it himself, and caused great joy to the sufferer\r\nby bringing back an affectionate letter in reply.\r\n\r\nYet the King soon felt the domination of his will. This appeared\r\nwhen the royal patient refused to go to bed. As the King petulantly\r\nresisted, Willis raised his voice in commanding tones which ensured\r\ncomplete submission. The trust which Willis reposed in the King led\r\nhim to lengths that were sharply censured. When the sufferer expressed\r\na desire to shave himself and complained that a razor and even a knife\r\nhad been withheld from him, Willis at once replied that he was sure\r\nHis Majesty had too strong a sense of what he owed to God and man to\r\nmake an improper use of it. He therefore brought a razor, and kept the\r\nmonarch under his eye until the growth of five weeks was removed. This\r\ntactful treatment speedily wrought a marked change. Willis was far more\r\nsanguine than the other attendants.[653] In his evidence before the\r\nCommittee on 9th December, he stated that the irritation was already\r\nsubsiding, and that nine-tenths of his patients who had been similarly\r\nafflicted recovered, generally within three months from their first\r\nseizure.[654]\r\n\r\nWillis’s words aroused the liveliest hopes. In vain did the Prince’s\r\nparty and the physicians scoff at the assurance of the “quack” or\r\n“interloper.” The Queen and the nation believed in Willis; and his\r\nreport greatly strengthened Pitt’s hands in dealing with the Regency.\r\nThe more we know of the motives that influenced votes in Parliament\r\nthe more we see that they turned on the opinions of the doctors. The\r\ndesertion of the Duke of Queensberry to the Prince’s party was due to\r\na long conversation which he had at Windsor with the pessimistic Dr.\r\nWarren.[655]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Prime Minister was cautious and tentative. On\r\n10th December, after presenting the medical evidence, he moved the\r\nappointment of a committee to investigate precedents. At once Fox\r\nstarted to his feet and poured forth a vehement remonstrance. What need\r\nwas there for such an inquiry? It was merely a pretext for delay. The\r\nheir-apparent was of mature age and capacity. He had as clear a right\r\nto take the reins of government and to exercise the sovereign power\r\nduring the King’s illness as he would have in case of death. Parliament\r\nhad only to determine when he had the right to exercise it; and as\r\nshort a time as possible should elapse before the Prince assumed the\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nHere, as so often, Fox marred his case by his impetuosity. Pitt\r\nwatched him narrowly, and remarked exultantly to his neighbour: “I’ll\r\n_un-Whig_ the gentleman for the rest of his life.” With eyes flashing\r\ndefiance, he denounced his assertions of the right of the Prince to\r\nassume the Regency as a breach of the constitution, implying as they\r\ndid that the House could not even deliberate on the question. They must\r\ntherefore in the first place assert their own rights.\r\n\r\nFox at once rose, not to soften, but to emphasize his previous\r\nstatements. He questioned whether Parliament had the power of\r\nlegislating at all until the royal power were made good. Now that\r\nthe King had been admitted to be incapable, their assembly was a\r\nConvention, not a Parliament. He next asserted that the Regency\r\nbelonged of right to the Prince of Wales during the civil death of\r\nthe King; and “that it could not be more legally his by the ordinary\r\nand natural demise of the Crown.” This was tantamount to saying that\r\nEnglish law recognized lunacy as death, in which case an heir could at\r\nonce possess the property of a lunatic father, and a wife be divorced\r\nfrom an insane husband. Of course this is not so.[656] Fox concluded\r\nby asserting that, if Parliament arrogated to itself the power of\r\nnominating the Regent, it would act “contrary to the spirit of the\r\nconstitution and would be guilty of treason.”\r\n\r\nPitt, on the contrary, affirmed that the Prince had no such claim to\r\nthe Regency as would supersede the right of either House to deliberate\r\non the subject. He even ventured on the startling assertion that apart\r\nfrom the decision of Parliament “the Prince of Wales had no more right\r\n(speaking of strict right) to assume the government than any other\r\nindividual subject of the country.”[657] This phrase is generally\r\nquoted without the qualifying clause, which materially alters it.\r\nPitt surely did not mean to deny the priority of the claim of the\r\nPrince, but rather to affirm the supreme authority of Parliament; the\r\nstatement, however was undeniably over-strained. In the main he carried\r\nthe House with him. In vain did Burke declaim against Pitt, styling\r\nhim a self-constituted competitor with the Prince. “Burke is Folly\r\npersonified,” wrote Sir William Young on 22nd December, “but shaking\r\nhis cap and bells under the laurel of genius.”[658] The sense of the\r\nHouse was clearly with the Prime Minister, and the committee of inquiry\r\nwas appointed.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, then, Fox and his friends strained their contentions to\r\nbreaking-point. In a technical sense their arguments could be justified\r\nby reference to the dead past; but they were out of touch with the\r\nliving present. Fox himself had admitted that no precedent could be\r\nfound for this problem. A practical statesman would therefore have\r\nsought to adapt the English constitution (which is a growing organism,\r\nnot a body of rigid rules) to the needs of the present crisis. By his\r\neager declarations he left this course open for Pitt to take; and\r\nthat great parliamentarian took it with masterly power. He resolved\r\nto base his case on the decisions arrived at in the Revolution of a\r\ncentury earlier which had affirmed the ascendancy of Parliament in all\r\nquestions relating to a vacancy in the Crown or a disputed succession.\r\nMen said that he was becoming a Republican, and Fox a Tory.[659]\r\nFortunately he had to do with singularly indiscreet opponents. After\r\nFox had prejudiced the Prince’s cause, Sheridan rushed in to mar its\r\nprospects still further. In the debate of 12th December he ventured to\r\nremind Pitt of the danger of provoking the assertion of the Prince’s\r\nclaim to the Regency. Never did Sheridan’s hatred of Pitt betray him\r\ninto a more disastrous blunder.[660] His adversary at once turned it to\r\naccount:\r\n\r\n    I have now [he said] an additional reason for asserting the\r\n    authority of the House and defining the boundaries of “Right,”\r\n    when the deliberative faculties of Parliament are invaded and an\r\n    indecent menace is thrown out to awe and influence our proceedings.\r\n    In the discussion of the question I trust the House will do its\r\n    duty in spite of any threat that may be thrown out. Men who feel\r\n    their native freedom will not submit to a threat, however high the\r\n    authority from which it may come.[661]\r\n\r\nWe must here pause in order to notice the allegations of Mr. Lecky\r\nagainst Pitt. That distinguished historian asserted that the conduct of\r\nthe Prime Minister towards the Prince “was from the first as haughty\r\nand unconciliatory as possible”; he claims that the plan of a Regency\r\nshould have been submitted to the Prince before it was laid before\r\nParliament; further, that, in defiance of the expressed wish of\r\nthe Prince, “Pitt insisted on bringing the question of the Prince’s\r\nright to a formal issue and obtaining a vote denying it.”[662] It is\r\ndifficult to see on what grounds this indictment rests. Surely it was\r\nthe duty of the Privy Council and Parliament first to hear the medical\r\nevidence and to decide whether the need for the Regency existed. That\r\nwas the purport of the debate of 10th December, the details of which\r\nprove conclusively that it was Fox who first, and in a most defiant\r\nway, brought up the question of the Prince’s right to assume the\r\nRegency. Pitt, in a temperate and non-committal speech, had moved\r\nfor a “Committee of Inquiry,” whereupon the Whig leader flung down\r\nthe gauntlet for the Prince; and two days later Sheridan uttered his\r\nthreat.[663] Their auditors must have inferred that they acted with the\r\nsanction of Carlton House. In any case, the Prince’s friends, not Pitt,\r\nprovoked the conflict. When the glove was twice cast down, the Prime\r\nMinister could do nothing else but take it up and insist on having\r\nthat question disposed of; otherwise Parliament might as well have\r\ndissolved outright. We may admit, however, that the intemperate conduct\r\nof Fox and Sheridan led Pitt to assert the authority of Parliament with\r\nsomewhat more stringency than the case warranted.\r\n\r\nTo the contention, that the Prince ought first to have been consulted\r\non the proposed measure, I may reply that such a course would have\r\nimplied his right to dictate his terms to Parliament; and that was the\r\nvery question which Pitt wished to probe by the Committee of Inquiry.\r\nFurther, the historian’s assertion, that Pitt laid the Regency plan\r\nbefore Parliament before submitting it to the Prince, is disproved by\r\nthe contents of Pitt’s letter of 15th December, published in full by\r\nBishop Tomline.[664] In it the Prime Minister expressed his regret that\r\nhis words and intentions had been misrepresented to His Royal Highness;\r\nfor on several occasions he had offered to wait on him but had received\r\nan answer that he (the Prince) had no instructions for him. He denied\r\nthe accuracy of the report that he was about on the morrow to submit\r\nto Parliament his plan for the Regency. His motion merely affirmed the\r\nright of Parliament to deliberate on the present emergency; but the\r\ncourse of the recent debate had compelled him to outline his ideas.\r\nThey were these: that the Regency should be vested in the Prince,\r\nwith the power of freely choosing his Ministers, unrestrained by any\r\nCouncil. He had declined, and begged still to decline, to detail the\r\nother powers, because the House might reject his opinions as to its\r\nright to deliberate on the present crisis. If he gained its approval,\r\nhe would be honoured by the Prince’s permission to state to him the\r\nopinions which, after due inquiry, Ministers were able to form on the\r\nfurther proposals that might be submitted to Parliament.\r\n\r\nWas this language “arrogant” and “unconciliatory”? Could a Minister\r\nshow more tact in seeking to harmonize the functions of the monarchy\r\nand of Parliament? Far from bringing his scheme cut and dried before\r\nParliament and then foisting it upon the Prince, Pitt was compelled by\r\nthe attack of Fox to outline his plan in Parliament, but he stated his\r\nviews to the Prince courteously, and at the earliest opportunity. The\r\nonly other possible alternative was to allow the Prince to take the\r\nmatter into his own hands and override the powers of Parliament. It is\r\nalso noteworthy that not until the next day (16th December) did Pitt\r\nmove three Resolutions on the subject, and these were of a preliminary\r\ncharacter, affirming the right and duty of Parliament to take steps for\r\nmeeting the present emergency.[665]\r\n\r\nIt should further be noted that the declaration of the Prince of Wales\r\nof his wish not to press his right was not made until the debate of\r\n15th December in the House of Lords. The Duke of York, in a very\r\ntactful speech, said that his brother “understood too well the sacred\r\nprinciples which seated the House of Brunswick on the throne of Great\r\nBritain ever to assume or exercise any power, be his claim what it\r\nmight, not derived from the will of the people, expressed by their\r\nrepresentatives and their Lordships in Parliament assembled.”[666] If\r\nFox and Sheridan had treated the question in this way, there would\r\nhave been no dispute. On the other hand the Prince does not seem to\r\nhave sent a reply to the Prime Minister’s missive; and his discourtesy\r\nprobably led to the discontinuance of further communications from Pitt\r\nuntil that of 30th December, soon to be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe debates in the House of Lords were generally of small interest. But\r\nthat of 15th December was memorable, not only for the tactful speech\r\nof the Duke of York noticed above, but also for the astute balancings\r\nof Thurlow. By the middle of December that political Blondin had seen\r\nthe need of retracing his steps. As has already appeared, Fox strongly\r\ndisapproved of shelving Loughborough in order to win Thurlow; and the\r\nclamour of the Whig peer, added to the arguments of Fox, led the Prince\r\nof Wales to retract his promise to the Chancellor. Even this, perhaps,\r\nwould not have turned him had he not come to believe that Warren was\r\nwrong and Willis was right. Discerning a balance of gain in favour of\r\nfidelity to the King, he played that part with an emotion peculiarly\r\naffecting in so rugged a nature. His shaggy eyebrows rose and fell with\r\ngreat solemnity, as he deprecated these discussions on the “right” of\r\nthis or that member of the constitution. They should await the inquiry\r\ninto the precedents of the case. Meanwhile their duty was to preserve\r\nthe dignities of the monarch intact until he should recover. Feelings\r\nof loyalty and gratitude imposed that duty, and particularly on\r\nhimself, the recipient of so many benefits, “which whenever I forget,\r\nmay God forget me.”[667] Two men who listened to that climax expressed\r\ntheir feelings with diverse emphasis. Pitt, who knew all but the latest\r\ndevelopments of the Thurlow-Sheridan intrigue, exclaimed, “Oh! the\r\nrascal.” In Wilkes a sense of humour, unclouded by disgust, prompted\r\nthe witticism: “Forget you! He’ll see you damned first.”\r\n\r\nOn 30th December, that is, seven days before the preliminary proposals\r\nfor a Regency came before the House of Commons, Pitt drafted his\r\nsuggestions in a most deferential letter to the Prince of Wales. In\r\nbrief they were as follows. Ministers desired that the Prince should\r\nbe empowered to exercise the royal authority, the care of the King\r\nand the control of his household being, however, vested in the Queen.\r\nThe Regent, also, could not assign the King’s property, grant any\r\noffice beyond His Majesty’s pleasure, or bestow any peerage except\r\non the King’s children after attaining their majority--restrictions\r\nwhich merely registered the belief that the King’s illness was only\r\ntemporary. At this time (the dawn of 1789) there were clear signs to\r\nthis effect; and Willis drew up a report laying stress on his partial\r\nrecovery; but, on his pressing Warren to sign it, the Whig practitioner\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThus opened the most fateful of all years of modern history. The\r\nWhigs, the erstwhile guardians of popular freedom and the rights of\r\nParliament, were straining every nerve to prove the King hopelessly\r\ninsane, to foist upon the English people a hated Prince with\r\nunrestrained powers, as if Parliament had no voice in the matter,\r\nand to discredit the Prime Minister by representing his conduct as\r\nunconstitutional, and his letter to the Prince as insolent.\r\n\r\nThe best brains of the party were also concentrated on the task\r\nof inventing for the Prince a telling and dignified rejoinder.\r\nPolitical philosophy, law, and wit, came to his aid in the form of\r\nBurke, Loughborough, and Sheridan. Or, rather, the first two drafted\r\nthe reply, which Sheridan then touched up. The brilliant Irishman\r\npronounced the effusion of his sager compatriot “all fire and tow,”\r\nand that of the jurist “all ice and snow.” Fox, it seems, was to have\r\nrevised the result; but the charms of Devonshire House on New Year’s\r\nDay detained “Sherry” far into the night; and the document, hastily\r\ncopied by Mrs. Sheridan, was hurried off to Carlton House without the\r\npromised recension at Holland House or Brooks’s Club. Fox was furious\r\nat this neglect, and called his friend names which the latter preferred\r\nnot to repeat to the Duchess.[668]\r\n\r\nSuch was this famous concoction. Connoisseurs, unaware of the facts,\r\nhave confidently pronounced it the mellow vintage of Burke. Indeed, it\r\nis probable that the body of it may be his, while the bouquet may be\r\nSheridan’s and the dregs Loughborough’s; but, the personal ingredients\r\nbeing unknown, it is useless to attempt a qualitative analysis. One\r\nthing alone is certain, that the Prince wrote not a word of it, but\r\nmerely signed the fair copy when made out by Mrs. Sheridan. Thereupon\r\nthe expectant Junto planned its public tapping, as an appetizing\r\nforetaste of the political wisdom of the new _régime_, Pitt meanwhile\r\nbeing dubbed a Republican and an insidious weakener of the executive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn more ways than one the situation was piquant. The _volte face_ of\r\nparties was odd enough. Pitt seemed about to impair the strength of the\r\nhereditary principle and to exalt the power of Parliament; while the\r\nWhigs, who vehemently assailed the kingly prerogative in 1784, now as\r\nardently belauded it in the person of the Prince. This contradiction\r\nextended even to details. Amidst all his appeals to precedents\r\nrespecting a Regency, Pitt must in reality have resolved to discard\r\nthem; and all research into the customs of the then almost absolute\r\nmonarchy must have strengthened the case of those who scolded him for\r\nresorting to this device. But, in truth, all these inconsistencies\r\nvanish when we remember that the questions at issue were primarily\r\nmedical and personal. Pitt’s whole policy was therefore one of delay.\r\n\r\nOwing to the death of the Speaker, Cornwall, and the subsequent\r\nelection of William Grenville as his successor, the debates on the\r\nRegency were not resumed until 6th January; and ten more days elapsed\r\nbefore other preliminary questions were disposed of and the ministerial\r\nproposals were laid before the House. They were in substance the\r\nsame as those submitted to the Prince on 30th December, except that\r\na Council was now suggested for the purpose of assisting the Queen\r\nin the guardianship of the King and the regulation of the royal\r\nhousehold.[669] It would be tedious to follow the course of the very\r\nlengthy debates which ensued. Ministers carried the Resolutions in both\r\nHouses; and the Prince somewhat grudgingly consented to act as Regent\r\non the terms now proposed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January Ministers proposed to legalize the proceedings\r\nof Parliament by the issue of letters patent under the Great Seal.\r\nA Commission was also appointed for the purpose of giving the royal\r\nassent and affixing the Seal to measures passed by the two Houses.[670]\r\nIn spite of a vehement protest by Burke, that he worshipped the gods\r\nof our glorious constitution, but would never bow down to Priapus\r\n(Thurlow), these proposals were carried. Not until 5th February were\r\npreliminaries disposed of; and Pitt then produced his Regency Bill. As\r\nit happened, the Opposition marred its own prospects by these dilatory\r\ntactics; for in a fortnight’s time it was known that the need for the\r\nBill had vanished.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these debates centres in the treatment of a very\r\ncomplex question by the two great rivals, Pitt and Fox. The conduct\r\nof the former has been sufficiently outlined. It remains to say a few\r\nwords on that of Fox. Few of his speeches are more ingenious than\r\nthose on the Regency. As a forcible handling of a weak case they have\r\nfew equals. But the House of Commons is rarely won over by a dazzling\r\ndisplay of “tongue-fencing.” It demands to see the applicability\r\nof arguments to the needs of the time. This has been its peculiar\r\nexcellence. Its deliberations are rarely lit up with the radiance of\r\nimmortal truths; but they are suffused with the comforting glow of\r\nthe domestic hearth. Fox forgot this. In contrast with the accepted\r\nWhig doctrine, he put forth claims which, if pressed to their natural\r\nconclusion, would have implied the restoration of monarchy of the\r\npre-Revolution type. If it was true that the Prince of Wales could\r\ndemand the Regency as a right, or even as a “legal claim,” free from\r\nall restrictions, how much more could the King govern independently of\r\nParliament? A Regent is to a King what the moon is to the sun--a merely\r\nborrowed and temporary splendour. Apart, then, from an inconsistency of\r\nconduct highly damaging to a statesman, Fox committed the mistake of\r\npledging himself to a scheme of government which was not only obsolete\r\nbut unworkable.\r\n\r\nThose who plod through the wearisome debates on the Regency must be\r\nconscious of an air of unreality. The references on both sides of the\r\nHouse to the cases of Edward VI or Henry VI were, after all, illusory;\r\nfor in those times the powers of Parliament were ill defined. The\r\nnearest parallel to the present case was supplied by the events of\r\n1688; and though pedants might appeal to certain forms observed by the\r\nConvention of that year, the significance of those events undoubtedly\r\nlay in the assertion of the supremacy of Parliament in all cases of a\r\ntemporary lapse of the royal power. The argument for the supremacy of\r\nParliament in all doubtful cases acquired redoubled strength from the\r\nAct of Settlement of 1701, which set aside hereditary right in favour\r\nof the House of Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe arguments of Fox as to the inherent right of the Prince of Wales to\r\nthe Regency must therefore be pronounced archaically interesting but\r\ninconclusive for any member of the reigning dynasty. The fact that they\r\nwere adopted by the Irish Parliament adds nothing to their force; for\r\nthat body was known to act more from corrupt motives or from opposition\r\nto George III and his Lord-Lieutenant, the Marquis of Buckingham, than\r\nfrom monarchical zeal.[671]\r\n\r\nThe divisions in the Parliament at Westminster were also much\r\ninfluenced by similar considerations. The numbers of those who went\r\nover to the Prince’s side were surprisingly large. Among the Peers, the\r\ncases of the Marquis of Lothian and the Duke of Queensberry attracted\r\nespecial notice, as they had received many benefits from the King. Of\r\nthose helped on by Pitt, Lord Malmesbury and Gerald Hamilton (commonly\r\nknown as “Single-Speech” Hamilton) were the worst defaulters. The\r\nformer, after calling on Pitt to assure him of his devotion, suddenly\r\n“ratted” to the Prince and sent a very lame letter of excuse. To this\r\nPitt replied that he had certainly misunderstood every expression in\r\ntheir late interview, and begged his Lordship to act in any way he\r\nthought fit without troubling to send an apology.[672] Malmesbury\r\nsought to appease his friend Carmarthen by offering to call and discuss\r\nthings in the old way; but, if he had lost his esteem, he would prefer\r\nto retire and feed goats on a mountain “out of the reach of d--d Kings\r\nand d--d Regents.”[673] What Carmarthen thought of the defaulters\r\nappeared in his witty reply to someone who asked how it came about\r\nthat Fox had let the cat out of the bag so soon--“To catch the rats, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet literature that sprang up at this crisis is highly\r\ninteresting. The hacks employed by the Opposition persistently accused\r\nPitt of aiming at dictatorial power--a theme on which they richly\r\nembroidered, despite the well-known fact that he was preparing to\r\nresume his position as a barrister. It is somewhat significant that,\r\nwhile the nation warmly supported Pitt, he was bitterly assailed by\r\nGrub Street and Soho. Anonymous writers confidently foretold his\r\nascendancy and the ruin of England. “A few years, perhaps, and our\r\nboasted commonwealth may be numbered among the governments that\r\ncover the earth--the awful ruins of edifices once consecrated to the\r\nrights and happiness of the human kind.”[674] A “Private Citizen”\r\nurged the drawing up of an address to the Prince begging him to take\r\nthe full regal power as a “simple and obvious mode of restoring the\r\nconstitutional government to its full vigour.”[675] A flurried patriot\r\ndeclared that he knew of “but one alarming Regency, which is that of\r\nambitious Ministers voting themselves in power.”[676] Another citizen,\r\nsurely of Jacobite tendencies, proved that no power in the universe\r\ncould appoint a Regent; for he assumed that office solely by hereditary\r\nright. As for “Regent Ministers,” they would every day prostitute the\r\ndignity of the Crown in the animosities of debate, and the state of\r\nEngland would soon be worse than that of Poland.[677] Similar in tone\r\nis an “Address to those Citizens who had resisted the Claim of the\r\nlate House of Commons to nominate the Ministers of the Crown.” The\r\nwriter asserts that only sophistry can deny that the sole question now\r\nis whether Pitt and his colleagues shall be invested with the regal\r\nauthority with unlimited powers and for an indefinite period.[678]\r\nThese insinuations harmonize with those which Buckingham found in\r\ncirculation at Dublin; that the King had long been insane, but Pitt\r\nhad concealed the fact in order to govern without control; and that\r\nthe plan of a restricted Regency was the outcome of the same lust for\r\npower.[679]\r\n\r\nThe falsity of these charges is obvious. Whether the Regency were\r\na right or a trust, the Prince of Wales in the middle of February\r\nwas about to become Regent; and if he chose to risk a conflict\r\nwith Parliament he might at once dismiss Pitt and summon Fox to his\r\ncounsels. On this all-important question there were no restrictions\r\nwhatsoever. The restrictions solely concerned the relations between the\r\nRegent and the King, with two exceptions. These were the entrusting the\r\nGreat Seal to a Commission, and the forbidding the Regent to create\r\nPeers except among the royal family; and here the aim obviously was to\r\nprevent the Prince obstructing legislation and swamping the House of\r\nLords with his own nominees.\r\n\r\nThat the Prince did not dismiss Pitt was due, not to the lack of legal\r\npower to do so, but to the opportune recovery of the King. As appears\r\nby the reports of Dr. Willis, his health steadily improved throughout\r\nFebruary. It is clear that Fox, who was drinking the waters at Bath,\r\ndisbelieved the official bulletins on this subject and looked forward\r\nto a lease of power; for he wrote to Fitzpatrick on 17th February\r\nin terms of jubilation at the decision of the Irish Parliament, and\r\nadded: “I hope by this time all idea of the Prince or any of us taking\r\naction in consequence of the good reports of the King are at an end:\r\nif they are not, do all you can to crush them.... I rather think, as\r\nyou do, that Warren has been frightened. I am sure, if what I hear is\r\ntrue, that he has not behaved well.... Let me know by the return of\r\nthe post on what day the Regency is like to commence.”[680] From this\r\nit is obvious that the pessimism of Dr. Warren was not uninfluenced by\r\npolitical considerations.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was either better informed or more cautious than his\r\nfavourite. On that same day a bulletin appeared announcing the King’s\r\nconvalescence. The signatories included Dr. Warren, who speedily fell\r\ninto disgrace with the Prince’s friends. On the 19th, at the request of\r\nthe King, Thurlow had an interview with him and informed him of what\r\nhad happened during his illness. We may be sure that the Chancellor’s\r\nnarrative illustrated that power of language to conceal thought which\r\nTalleyrand held to be its choicest function. Thurlow, on his return to\r\ntown, moved the adjournment of the debate on the Regency Bill, which\r\nproved to be the beginning of the end of that measure.\r\n\r\nA still severer test of the King’s powers was afforded by his\r\ninterview four days later with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of\r\nYork. The Queen was present the whole time, and political topics\r\nwere of course avoided. Grenville asserts that after that interview\r\nthe Princes drove straight to Mrs. Armstead’s house in Park Street in\r\nhopes of finding Fox there and informing him of the King’s condition.\r\nCertain it is that, according to Willis’s report to Pitt, “the Princes\r\nexpressed great astonishment and satisfaction to Colonel Digby after\r\ntheir interview with the King, remarking only one or two trifling\r\ncircumstances in which they thought His Majesty was not perfectly\r\nright. The King has been perfectly composed since, and his anxiety\r\nto see Mr. Pitt increases to that degree that probably Mr. Pitt will\r\nreceive a message to that purport to-morrow morning.”[681] Accordingly\r\nPitt saw his sovereign on the 24th, and found him calm and dignified,\r\nwithout the slightest sign of flurry or disorder of mind. He spoke\r\nof his illness as a thing entirely past, and with tears in his eyes\r\nthanked all those who had stood by him. Even his emotion did not\r\nderange his faculties or mar his equanimity.[682]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Westminster the Opposition sought to vie with their\r\nrivals in expressions of loyal joy at the King’s recovery. Viscount\r\nStormont and other deserters to the Prince’s side hastened to avow\r\ntheir satisfaction; and the Duke of York displayed some skill in\r\ndepicting the heartfelt joy which filled his heart and that of his\r\nroyal brother--sentiments which they further proceeded to illustrate\r\nby plunging into a round of orgies.[683] In the Commons Fox sought\r\ndecently to draw a veil over the disappointment of his partisans.\r\n\r\nThe Providence which watches over the affairs of mortals sometimes\r\nwills that the _dénouement_ of a problem shall come with dramatic\r\neffect. It was so now. The recovery of the King occurred in the very\r\nweek to which the Prince’s friends were eagerly looking forward as the\r\ntime of entry into his enchanted palace.[684] Their chagrin, at the\r\nvery moment when the paeans of triumph were on their lips, recalls\r\nthe thrilling scene in “Paradise Lost,” where the fiends are about to\r\nacclaim Satan at the end of the recital of his triumph over mankind,\r\nand raise their throats for the shout of victory, when, lo, the sound\r\ndies away in\r\n\r\n  A dismal universal hiss\r\n\r\nissuing from thousands of forms suddenly become serpentine.[685]\r\n\r\nSuch (if we may compare small things with great) was the swift change\r\nfrom exultation to disgust which came over the Prince’s friends.\r\nShortly before the critical day, the 19th, they had declared that,\r\nwere the Regent in power only for twelve hours, he would make a clean\r\nsweep of all official appointments. Indeed, from the outset, he and his\r\nfollowers had let it be known that no mercy would be shown to the Pitt\r\nAdministration and its officials.[686] There is a manifest absurdity in\r\nthe assertion of Sir Gilbert Elliot, that Ministers and their adherents\r\nlooked on the Prince’s following “as a prey to be hunted down and\r\ndestroyed without mercy.”[687] Up to the 19th of February this phrase\r\naptly described the aim of their rivals. So early as 13th December\r\n1788 Sheridan informed the Marquis of Buckingham that the Prince\r\nintended to dissolve Parliament both at Westminster and Dublin; for the\r\nOpposition “could not go on with the old one in England; and the choice\r\nof a new one in Ireland would give them a lasting advantage, _which\r\nis true_.”[688] The large powers of patronage entrusted to the Regent\r\nwould have influenced very many votes at the General Election, just as\r\nthe prospect of princely rewards caused many place-hunters to change\r\nsides in the two Houses.\r\n\r\nThe lavishness of this form of bribery appears in a letter written\r\nby Sydney to Cornwallis about 20th February, wherein he asserts\r\nthat the following promotions in the army were all but officially\r\nannounced. Four Field-Marshals, thirty-one Generals, twenty\r\nLieutenant-Generals, twelve Major-Generals, besides many Colonels and\r\nlower grades; also ten new Aides-de-camp--almost all for political\r\nreasons. It was further known that Portland would be Prime Minister;\r\nStormont and Fox, Secretaries of State; Loughborough, Chancellor;\r\nSandwich or Fitzwilliam, First Lord of the Admiralty;[689] Spencer,\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland; Northumberland, Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance; Fitzpatrick, Secretary at War; Sheridan, President of the\r\nBoard of Control.[690] We may note here that Northumberland and Lord\r\nRawdon (afterwards the Earl of Moira) with some followers had formed a\r\ngroup standing somewhat apart, but acting with the Prince’s friends on\r\nconsideration of gaining office. They were called the Armed Neutrality;\r\nand their proceedings bore no small resemblance to a political auction,\r\nin which the Prince of Wales knocked down offices at discretion.[691]\r\n\r\nThe abrupt ending to these intrigues and bargains brought intense\r\nrelief to every patriot. Independent observers, like Cartwright and\r\nWyvill, had felt deep concern at the prospect of the rule of the\r\nPrince and Fox. “I very much fear,” wrote the former to Wilberforce,\r\n“that the King’s present derangement is likely to produce other\r\nderangements not for the public benefit. I hope we are not to be sold\r\nto the Coalition faction.” Wyvill also wrote to Wilberforce: “Cabal\r\nI doubt not is labouring under his [Fox’s] direction to overturn the\r\npresent Government, while you and the other firm friends of Mr. Pitt\r\nare making equal exertions to prevent a change of men and measures.\r\nI think the general opinion is that the Prince has acted like a rash\r\nyoung man, that he is capable of being led into dangerous measures, and\r\nthat men whom the nation greatly distrusts have all his confidence and\r\nesteem.”[692]\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was, however, influenced by something more definite than\r\ndistrust of the Prince and his favourites. By this time the nation\r\nconfided entirely in the good sense and disinterestedness of Pitt. The\r\nMarquis of Buckingham expressed the general opinion when he called\r\nPitt “the honestest Minister he ever saw.”[693] Those qualities never\r\nshone more brightly than during the perplexing problem of the Regency.\r\nIf he trammelled the Prince, it was in order to assert the supremacy\r\nof Parliament, and to prevent personal changes at Windsor which would\r\nprobably have brought about a return of the King’s malady. For himself,\r\nhe prepared quietly and with dignity to resume his practice at the Bar.\r\nHad the recovery of George III been delayed another week, the Minister\r\nwould have been found once more at Lincoln’s Inn, looking on with his\r\nwonted serenity at the wholesale changes in the official world brought\r\nabout by the vindictiveness of his rivals. So near was England then to\r\nthe verge of a political crisis which would have embattled the nation\r\nagainst a Government foisted upon it by an unscrupulous Prince and a\r\ngreedy faction.\r\n\r\nFortunately the crisis was averted; and, thanks to the wise measures\r\ntaken by Pitt, the recovery of the royal patient was not interrupted\r\nby the sight of new faces around him at Kew and Windsor. Long and\r\nlaboured explanations were afterwards offered to the King by the Prince\r\nof Wales, in which he had the effrontery to refer to the pain caused\r\nhim when he “saw Her Majesty set up by designing men as the head of\r\na system” which was “a device of private ambition.”[694] After this\r\nhe never was trusted or fully forgiven either by the King or Queen.\r\nTheir confidence and that of the nation was heartily accorded to the\r\nMinister whose conduct had been as loyal and consistent as that of\r\nLaurentius in Pitt’s early dramatic effort. Friends pointed to his\r\nsimple and earnest regard for the public welfare throughout the whole\r\ndispute. By those qualities he peacefully solved a tangled problem and\r\nbound together the King and the people in a union of hearts such as had\r\nnot been known since the accession of the House of Brunswick. On the\r\nevening of the day when George III resumed his regal functions, London\r\nwas ablaze with illuminations which extended from Hampstead to Clapham\r\nand Tooting.[695] The joy of all classes of the people brimmed over\r\nonce more at the Thanksgiving Service held at St. Paul’s Cathedral on\r\n23rd April, when the demonstrations of loyalty were such as to move\r\nthe King to an outburst of emotion. The part played by Pitt was not\r\nforgotten. With difficulty he escaped from the importunities of his\r\nadmirers, who had to content themselves with dragging his carriage\r\nback to his residence in Downing Street. Outwardly, this day marks the\r\nzenith of his career. True, he was to win one more diplomatic triumph\r\nover the House of Bourbon, the importance of which has been strangely\r\nunder-rated. But already there was arising on the horizon a cloud,\r\nalbeit small as a man’s hand, which was destined to overcloud the sky\r\nand deluge the earth. Only ten days after the Thanksgiving Service at\r\nSt. Paul’s there assembled at Versailles the States-General of France,\r\nwhose actions, helped on by the folly of the French princes, led to the\r\nsubversion of that august monarchy. By so short an interval did the\r\nconstitutional crisis in Great Britain precede a convulsion which was\r\ndestined to overturn nearly every Government in the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA AND CANADA\r\n\r\n    The outcasts of an old Society cannot form the foundation of a new\r\n    one.--_Parl. Report of 28th July 1785._\r\n\r\n    The more enormous of our offenders might be sent to Tunis, Algiers,\r\n    and other Mahometan ports, for the redemption of Christian slaves;\r\n    others might be compelled to dangerous expeditions, or be sent to\r\n    establish new colonies, factories, and settlements on the coast\r\n    of Africa and on small islands for the benefit of navigation.--W.\r\n    EDEN, _A Discourse on Banishment_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first settlement of the white man on a Continent where all was\r\nstrange might seem to be a topic more engaging, as well as more\r\nimportant, than the escapades of a selfish young prince and the\r\ninsanity of his father. But the piles of printed paper respecting\r\nthe affairs of Carlton House and the Regency attest the perennial\r\npreference of mankind for personal topics; and its disregard of wide\r\nissues that affect the destinies of nations is seen in the mere scraps\r\nof information concerning the early colonization of Australia. The\r\nstatement of the late Sir John Seeley that the British people founded\r\nan Empire in a fit of absence of mind is nowhere more true than of the\r\nevents of the years 1787, 1788, which marked the beginning of a new\r\nepoch of expansive energy.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious periodicity about the colonizing efforts of\r\nthe British race. At one time the islanders send forth swarms of\r\nadventurers and make wide conquests. At another time the colonies\r\nlanguish for lack of settlers; so that one is tempted to compare these\r\nmovements, albeit slow and irregular, with those of the blood in the\r\nhuman organism. They have had beneficial results. The contracting\r\nimpulse has prevented that untimely diffusion of the nation’s energies\r\nwhich leads to atrophy of the essential organs. But when these are\r\nonce more in full vigour they can do naught else but send forth their\r\nvitalizing streams. By this systole and diastole the nation recovers\r\nstrength and makes use of that strength. The variation of effort is\r\ndoubly beneficent. It prevents the too great effusion of life-blood\r\nwhich enfeebled Portugal in the sixteenth century; and the recurrence\r\nof the colonizing instinct has saved England from the undue absorption\r\nin domestic affairs which until recently narrowed the life of France.\r\n\r\nThe terrible drain of the American War naturally concentrated the\r\nattention of Britons for some time on home affairs. The most imperious\r\nneed of the body politic was rest; and, as we have seen, Pitt used all\r\nhis tact and energy to bestow and prolong that boon. Fortunately, the\r\nloss of life had been slight. Lack of money rather than of men put a\r\nstop to colonizing efforts and induced the belief that they weakened\r\nthe State. But the life-blood was there in abundance, ready to flow\r\nforth as soon as confidence returned and the will was quickened.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for want of a firm and intelligent lead, the experiment\r\nbegan slowly and awkwardly. As is well known, it was excess of\r\npopulation, of a particular type, which led the authorities to take\r\naction. The savage penal code of that age hanged or immured in gaol\r\nnumbers who would now escape with a small fine. As many as 160 offences\r\nwere punishable with death, and this gives the measure of the code, in\r\nits less Draconian enactments. Indeed, but for sleepy Dogberries, and\r\nreluctant jurymen, a tenth part of the population might have lodged\r\nin the filthy gaols which formed the fruitful seed-bed of crime.\r\nGoldsmith in his “Vicar of Wakefield” asks whether the licentiousness\r\nof our people or the stupid severity of our laws was responsible for\r\nthe numbers of our convicts doubling those of continental lands. The\r\nquestion impelled John Howard and Romilly to their life-long efforts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the State continued to avert the need of building\r\nmore gaols by extending its time-honoured methods, hanging and\r\ntransportation.[696] During the years 1714–65 those two cures for\r\novercrowding enjoyed increasing favour. Under the first George any\r\none found guilty of larceny, either “grand” or “petit,” might be\r\ntransported to America for seven years. The same penalty was inflicted\r\nin the next reign on poachers who were caught, with arms in their\r\nhands, in the act of chasing or taking deer in unenclosed forests;\r\nor, again, it fell to be the lot of those who assaulted magistrates\r\nor officers engaged in salving wrecks, and likewise on all who were\r\nmarried without banns or licence. It was reserved for the law makers\r\nof George III to allot seven years of transportation to all who stole\r\nor took fish “in any water within a park, paddock, orchard or yard,\r\nand the receivers, aiders and abettors.” Sir William Eden, in his\r\n“Discourse on Banishment,” cites these offences as about the average\r\nof the crimes punishable by transportation; but he hints that many\r\nless heinous offences led to the same dreary goal. That philanthropist\r\napparently did not think it an ingenious means of torture to send some\r\nof these convicts to Algiers to rescue from life-long slavery the\r\nChristians caught by the Barbary rovers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the United States having closed their doors against\r\npoachers, thieves, and those who married in too great haste, a paternal\r\nGovernment found it necessary either to relax the penal code, to\r\nbuild more prisons, to commission more hulks, or to found new penal\r\nsettlements. Georgian legislators, being practical men, turned their\r\nthoughts to the last alternative. The subject was brought up in the\r\nHouse of Commons by Burke on 16th March 1785. He asserted that as\r\nmany as 100,000 convicts were then liable to transportation; and\r\nprotested against the rigour, cruelty, and expense attending that\r\nmode of punishment. Lord Beauchamp again called the attention of the\r\nHouse to that topic on 11th April, when Pitt admitted the importance\r\nof finding a new penal settlement. The Gambia River in West Africa had\r\nbeen used for that purpose; and Burke now rose to protest against the\r\ninhumanity of sending convicts to any part of that deadly coast. He was\r\ninterrupted by the Prime Minister, who assured him that such a plan was\r\nnot in contemplation, and that a Report would soon be issued.[697]\r\n\r\nParliamentary Papers on this subject appeared on 9th May and 28th\r\nJuly. The latter is remarkable for the statesmanlike utterance, quoted\r\nas a motto at the head of this chapter, which shows that at least\r\nsome of our politicians looked on a new settlement as something more\r\nthan a chapel-of-ease of our prisons. In other respects the Report is\r\nsomewhat puerile. It recommended the need of strict discipline in the\r\nnew settlement, and pointed out the district of the River das Voltas\r\nas desirable. If this were the same as the River Volta of the Gold\r\nCoast, the Committee evidently regarded fever as the most effective of\r\ngovernors.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to speculate on the results that might have attended\r\nthese weak and stumbling moves. Probably the strenuous opposition of\r\nBurke vetoed the Gambia and Gold Coast schemes; but the Government,\r\nstill intent upon the Atlantic coast of Africa, sent a sloop, H.M.S.\r\n“Nautilus,” to survey the south-west coast between 15° 50´ and 33°.\r\nVery fortunately for the future of the British people the whole coast\r\nwas found to be inhospitable. If the _hinterland_ of Walfisch Bay or\r\nAngra Pequeña had been less barren it is almost certain that the new\r\npenal colony would have been formed at one of those spots. Ministers\r\nalso turned their attention to the coasts adjacent to Cape Town; for\r\nwe find Pitt writing to Grenville on 2nd October 1785: “I have desired\r\nDevagnes also to send you some papers relative to a scheme of a\r\nsettlement on the Caffre coast, to answer in some respects the purposes\r\nof the Cape, and to serve also as a receptacle for convicts, which I\r\nhope you will have time to look at.”[698]\r\n\r\nThis points to a plan for settling some point of the coast of\r\nCaffraria, possibly Algoa Bay or what is now East London. There were\r\nspecial reasons for gaining a foothold in that quarter, seeing that the\r\nDutch Republic was falling more and more under the control of France,\r\nand the union of those two Powers in the East would have threatened\r\nthe existence of our Indian Empire. A British stronghold on the South\r\nAfrican coast was therefore highly desirable; but perhaps matters were\r\ntoo strained in the years 1786 and 1787 for this menacing step to be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the cause, Pitt and his colleagues failed to\r\nfind a point on the African coast suitable for their purpose, which\r\nwas to found a penal settlement furnishing relief alike to the prison\r\nsystem and to British ships midway on the voyage to India. Had they\r\ndiscovered such a place the course of history might have been very\r\ndifferent. The English-speaking race would early have taken so firm\r\na hold of South Africa as to press on a solution of the Anglo-Dutch\r\nquestion. But in the meantime the Pacific coast of Australia would\r\nhave gone to France. The one study in which Louis XVI shone, and in\r\nwhich Pitt was most deficient, was geography. The lord of Versailles\r\nfound his chief mental recreation in maps and books of travel. Already\r\nhe had sent out expeditions to rival that of Captain Cook; and, as we\r\nshall see, only by the infinitesimal margin of six days did Britons\r\nsecure a foothold in Australia in advance of their rivals.\r\n\r\nThe honour of turning the attention of Ministers to the Pacific coast\r\nof “New Holland” belongs to Sir Joseph Banks, James Matra, and Admiral\r\nSir George Young. In his description of the voyage of Captain Cook\r\nalong the coast of New South Wales, Banks had spoken of the rich\r\nsoil and wealth of vegetation around Botany Bay, a description which\r\nundoubtedly led Matra and Young to take up the matter. Sir Joseph Banks\r\ndid not pursue the theme. At least in his letters and papers in the\r\nBritish Museum there is no hint that he induced Pitt or Lord Sydney\r\nto people that terrestrial paradise. Perhaps the work of the Royal\r\nSociety, of which he was President, engaged all his attention.\r\n\r\nJames Maria Matra, a Corsican who had long been in the British service\r\nand had accompanied Banks in the memorable voyage of Captain Cook,[699]\r\nwas the first to formulate a definite scheme for the colonization of\r\nBotany Bay. In a long letter, dated 23rd August 1783, he pointed out\r\nto the Coalition Cabinet the great extent of the land, the fertility\r\nof the soil, and the paucity of the natives as marking it out for\r\nsettlement, especially by the American Loyalists, whose dire distress\r\nthen aroused deep sympathy. He also declared that the nearness of\r\nNew South Wales to the Spice Islands, India, China, and Japan, was\r\nfavourable for commerce; that the growth of New Zealand flax would\r\nprovide endless supplies of cordage for shipping; and that, in case of\r\nwar, the harbours of New South Wales would furnish a useful base of\r\nnaval operations against the Dutch and Spanish settlements in the East.\r\nIn his original scheme Matra did not mention settlement by convicts. He\r\ndesired to found a colony either by means of United Empire Loyalists,\r\nor “marines accustomed to husbandry,”[700] a suggestion which recalls,\r\nnot very felicitously, the Roman plan of planting veteran soldiers on\r\nthe outposts of the realm.\r\n\r\nThe discredit of making the first suggestion in favour of a convict\r\nsettlement at Botany Bay probably belongs to Lord Sydney, Secretary of\r\nState for Home Affairs in the Pitt Cabinet. Matra had a conversation\r\nwith him on 6th April 1784, in which the Minister hinted at the\r\ndesirability of relieving the congestion in the prisons, which was\r\ngiving trouble to the authorities. The details of the conversation\r\nare not known; but apparently it led Matra to add a postscript to\r\nhis scheme, in which he referred to the interview and remarked on\r\nthe frightful mortality among the convicts sent to the West Coast of\r\nAfrica. Out of 746 sent there in 1775–6, 334 died, 271 deserted, and\r\nnothing was known of the remainder. Obviously in a distant and healthy\r\nclimate like Botany Bay, men must either work or starve; certainly they\r\ncould not return.[701] Nothing definite seems to have come of Matra’s\r\nconversation with Sydney or his plan, even as now modified.\r\n\r\nScarcely more successful were the efforts of Admiral Sir George Young\r\nto interest Ministers in the subject. His scheme was sent by the\r\nAttorney-General, Sir Richard Pepper Arden, to Sydney on 13th January\r\n1785. The admiral called attention to the facilities which New South\r\nWales would enjoy for a lucrative trade with New Spain, China, and\r\nthe East Indies. He laid stress on the fertility of the soil and the\r\nvariety of climates in the new possession, which would ensure the\r\ngrowth of all tropical and sub-tropical products. New Zealand flax\r\nwould by itself furnish several requisites for ship-building and\r\nrepairing, thereby freeing us from dependence on Russia. Metals would\r\nprobably be found; and thus at a small expense (about £2,000) an\r\nimportant commercial mart might be founded. Sir George Young deprecated\r\nany plan of emigration from Great Britain as weakening to her; but he\r\nsuggested that the distressed American Loyalists should be transferred\r\nto New South Wales, and that labourers might be collected from the\r\nSociety Islands and China. “All the people required from England are\r\nonly a few that are possessed of the useful arts, and those comprised\r\namong the crews of the ships that may be sent on that service.” He,\r\nhowever, added that convict settlements might most suitably be planted\r\nthere. Finally, he claimed that the whole scheme would further the\r\ncause of religion and humanity, and redound to the prosperity and glory\r\nof King George III.[702]\r\n\r\nThe ideas and the phraseology of the Memorandum are so similar to those\r\nused by Matra as to suggest that Sir George Young founded his plan on\r\nthat of the Corsican; and the Admiral at the end of his Plan introduced\r\nthree sentences on the suitability of parts of New South Wales for\r\nconvicts. Possibly this was inserted in order to attract Ministers.\r\nNevertheless they took no action on the matter; and possibly, but for\r\nthe pressure exerted by Lord Beauchamp and Burke on 11th April 1785,\r\nthis vitally important question would have remained in abeyance. Pitt,\r\nhowever, then promised that Government would take it up. The “Nautilus”\r\nwas accordingly sent to the African coast, with the result that we have\r\nseen; and the humiliating truth must be confessed that the Ministry\r\nshowed no sign of interest, if we except the single sentence in Pitt’s\r\nletter of 2nd October 1785, quoted above, respecting a settlement in\r\nCaffraria.\r\n\r\nNot until 18th August 1786 do we find any sign that the Government\r\nsought to redeem its promise to Parliament. The Pitt Papers, however,\r\nafford proof that Ministers had before them at least one other\r\nscheme for the disposing of convicts elsewhere than in New Holland.\r\nOn 14th September 1786 William Pulteney wrote to Pitt an important\r\nletter (quoted in part in Chapter XIV), which concluded as follows:\r\n“I mentioned to Mr. Dundas that a much better plan had been proposed\r\nto Lord Sidney [_sic_] for disposing of our felons than that which\r\nI see is advertised, that of sending them to Botany Bay; but his\r\nLordship had, too hastily I think, rejected it; if you wish to know the\r\nparticulars, Mr. Dundas can in great measure explain them, and I can\r\nget the whole in writing.”[703]\r\n\r\nPitt gave no encouragement to his correspondent, and the official plan,\r\nalready drafted, ran its course. On 18th August 1786, Sydney sent to\r\nthe Lords of the Treasury a statement that, considering the crowded\r\nstate of the prisons and the impossibility of finding a suitable site\r\nfor a settlement in Africa, the King had fixed on Botany Bay, owing to\r\nthe accounts given by those who had sailed with Captain Cook. As many\r\nas 750 convicts would therefore be sent out, along with 180 marines,\r\nprovisions for two years, seeds, tools, and other necessaries for the\r\nfounding of a settlement. The importance of growing New Zealand flax\r\nwas named,--a sign that Ministers had consulted the reports of Matra\r\nand Sir George Young, and saw the need of having a naval station in the\r\nPacific. A fortnight later Sydney sent a similar letter to the Lords of\r\nthe Admiralty.[704]\r\n\r\nIn this halting and prosaic way did Ministers set their hands to one\r\nof the most fruitful undertakings of all time. We do not know which\r\nmember took the initiative. Probably it was Sydney, as Minister for\r\nHome Affairs; but Pitt certainly gave his approval, and there are two\r\nletters which show that he took interest in details. One is his letter\r\nto Evan Nepean, Under Secretary for Home Affairs, requesting him to\r\nobtain from the Secretary of the Admiralty, Sir Charles Middleton,\r\nan estimate of the expenses of the expedition.[705] The second is a\r\nletter from the Lord Chief Justice, Earl Camden, to Pitt, who must have\r\nconsulted him about the legal questions involved in the formation of\r\nthe colony:\r\n\r\n                                    Hill St., _Jany. 29, 1787_.[706]\r\n\r\n    DEAR PITT,\r\n\r\n    ... I have looked over the draught of the Bill for establishing a\r\n    summary Jurisdiction in Botany Bay. I believe such a jurisdiction\r\n    in the present state of that embryo (for I can’t call it either\r\n    settlement or colony) is necessary, as the component parts of it\r\n    are not of the proper stuff to make jurys [_sic_] in capital cases\r\n    especially. However, as this is a novelty in our constitution,\r\n    would it not be right to require the Court to send over to England\r\n    every year a report of all the capital convictions, that we may be\r\n    able to see in what manner this jurisdiction has been exercised?\r\n    For I presume it is not meant to be a lasting jurisdiction; for if\r\n    the colony thrives and the number of inhabitants increase, one sh^d\r\n    wish to grant them trial by jury as soon as it can be done with\r\n    propriety.\r\n\r\nClearly, then, Pitt had a distinct share in the drafting of the Bill\r\nfor establishing the settlement. The general plan had been decided at\r\na Council held at St. James’s Palace on 6th December 1786.[707] The\r\nLetters Patent forming the Courts of Law were issued on 2nd April\r\n1787; but it was not until 12th May that H.M.S. “Sirius” and “Supply,”\r\nescorting the transports “Alexander,” “Charlotte,” “Scarborough,”\r\n“Prince of Wales,” “Friendship,” and “Lady Penrhyn,” set sail from\r\nSpithead on their dreary voyage of eight months. On 20th January\r\n1788 Governor Phillip landed at Botany Bay, and a few days later he\r\ntransferred his strange company to the land-locked and beautiful Port\r\nJackson, on an inlet of which he founded the infant settlement of\r\nSydney. He was just in time to anticipate the French expedition under\r\nLa Pérouse, which sailed into the harbour only six days after Phillip\r\nlanded at Botany Bay. Thus, by extraordinary good luck, despite all\r\nthe delays at Westminster, the British narrowly forestalled their\r\nrivals in the occupation of that magnificent coast. Captain Cook, it is\r\ntrue, had claimed it for the British Crown; but in international law\r\neffective occupation is a necessary sequel to so vague and sweeping a\r\ndeclaration. The choice of the name “Sydney” for the infant settlement\r\nattests the conviction of Governor Phillip that the whole plan owed\r\nvery much to the initiative of that nobleman. It is, however, strange\r\nthat the name of Pitt was not given to some town or river of the\r\ncolony; for he certainly played an important part in the undertaking.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the whole question reflects no great credit either on\r\nPitt or Sydney. Neither of them had shown much insight or eagerness in\r\nthe matter. Especially may they and their colleagues be blamed for not\r\nhaving resolved, though at slightly increased cost, to found the colony\r\nworthily by means of the American Loyalists who had suffered so much\r\nfor their devotion to King and Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe question of the American Loyalists will be referred to later\r\nin this chapter; and it is not here suggested that those Loyalists\r\nwho had migrated to the lands soon to be known as New Brunswick and\r\nOntario should have been sent to the Southern Seas. There were many\r\nothers, who had set sail with the British garrisons leaving New York\r\nand other towns, now available for that experiment. They were living\r\nin England in penury and with hope deferred, while the question of the\r\nindemnity in honour due to them from the United States slowly petered\r\nout. The British Parliament was investigating their claims and finally\r\nacknowledged its obligations to them; but in the meantime they were in\r\nwant. Would not the Ministry have consulted their interests and the\r\nwelfare of the Empire by offering to them to commute their pecuniary\r\nclaims for grants of land and expenses of settlement in New South\r\nWales? The possible objection, that their claims had not been entirely\r\ninvestigated by the year 1787, is trifling. The offer might surely have\r\nbeen made to those whose cases and characters were well known, and who\r\nwere suited to a life of hardship and adventure. There must have been\r\nvery many who would have preferred a free and active life to one of\r\nwretchedness in London; and when we reflect on the great accession of\r\nstrength brought by the Loyalists to Canada and New Brunswick, it will\r\never remain a matter of regret that Ministers acted on the motive which\r\nappealed so forcibly to Lord Sydney, that of easing the pressure on\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nFor the time, it is true, their experiment was highly economical, the\r\ncost of the expedition and settlement at Sydney from October 1786 to\r\nOctober 1789 being only £8,632, or one-eighteenth part of the sum which\r\nin the year 1787 Parliament unanimously voted for the discharge of the\r\ndebts of a spendthrift prince.[708] It is scarcely fair to read the\r\nideas of our age into one from which we have moved very far away, or\r\nto censure Pitt for his complaisance to the future George IV, while\r\nhe pared down the expenses of the greatest colonial experiment of his\r\ngeneration. No one could foresee the splendid future of the “Isle of\r\nContinent.” Even Matra and Sir George Young, who gazed far ahead,\r\nbelieved that the work of the settlement must be done mainly by Chinese\r\nand South Sea Islanders.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, seeing that the advantage of utilizing the energies of\r\nAmerican Loyalists was clearly laid before Ministers, it is astonishing\r\nthat they paid no heed to a plan which might ultimately have proved to\r\nbe more economical even than the export of convicts. Certainly it would\r\nhave furnished the new land with the best of colonists. The kith and\r\nkin of the men who built up Ontario and New Brunswick would have laid\r\nbroad and deep the foundations of New South Wales. The greatest good\r\nfortune of North America was the advent of Puritan leaders as founders\r\nof a State; and the transfer to the Southern Continent of their\r\ndescendants, who rivalled them in the staunchness of their fidelity\r\nto principle, would have been an Imperial asset of priceless worth.\r\nThere are times when the foresight and imagination of a statesman\r\nmean infinitely much to the future of the race; and no action is more\r\nfruitful in results than the settlement of a new Continent. The Greeks\r\ndid well to solemnize the sending forth of colonists by the honours\r\nof the State and the sanction of religion. And what they did for the\r\nfounding of one more Greek city, Great Britain ought to have done for\r\nthe occupation of a coast-line known to possess vast possibilities of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe painful truth must be faced that in this matter Pitt lacked the\r\nImperial imagination. Despite vague assertions to the contrary by\r\nprofessed panegyrists, I cannot find a word in his speeches or letters\r\nwhich evinced any interest in the Botany Bay experiment. Thus, in the\r\ndebate of 9th February 1791, on the condition of the young settlements\r\nand the question of stopping the transportation of 1,850 more convicts,\r\nPitt spoke of that experiment as if it were an improved and economical\r\nprison. His speech did not rise to the level of that of Sir Charles\r\nBunbury and Mr. Jekyll, the mover and seconder of the motion for an\r\ninquiry into the whole subject of transportation. They both pleaded\r\nfor more rational methods of punishment, wherein the depraved would\r\ncease to contaminate the less guilty. Bunbury commented on the alarming\r\nincrease of crime of late years, the number of sentences of death\r\nhaving been doubled, while convictions for felony had quadrupled. Both\r\nhe and Jekyll pressed for the construction of penitentiaries where the\r\nsystem of “that good and useful citizen, Mr. Howard,” might be better\r\nenforced; and they mentioned the report that the settlements in New\r\nSouth Wales were ill-suited to this purpose, owing to the sterility of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nTo this last charge Pitt made no effective answer. So far as we\r\ncan judge from the semi-official reports, he sought refuge in the\r\nmiserable reply that “in point of expense no cheaper mode of disposing\r\nof the convicts could be found,” and that, as the chief cost of\r\nstarting that settlement had been already incurred--how paltry the\r\ncost we have seen--it would be foolish to seek for some other place\r\nwhere those expenses must again be met! He expressed his approval of\r\npenitentiaries, said nothing about that fruitful mother of crime,\r\nthe penal code, and declined to take any steps for stopping the\r\ntransport of the 1,850 convicts. It was something that, amidst these\r\nfrigid negations, he did not oppose the motion for an inquiry into\r\nthe condition of Botany Bay. Curiously enough, he did not once name\r\nthe only considerable settlement, Sydney,[709] so limited was his\r\noutlook on social and colonial problems. Wide as were his views on most\r\nquestions, it must be admitted that here was his blind side; and he\r\nmust be held partly responsible for spreading over new lands a social\r\ntaint which long blighted their progress.\r\n\r\nThat taint was to vanish; and its disappearance in a few generations\r\nis a signal proof that, under fit conditions, the human race does not\r\ndegenerate but wins its way to higher levels. Nevertheless, in view of\r\nthe power of historic ideas and traditions, we must ever regret that\r\nPitt and his colleagues did not resolve to make the new settlement a\r\nliving proof of Britain’s care for the staunchest and truest of her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy a transition which, however abrupt in a geographical sense, is\r\nslight in the sphere of politics, we pass from the settlement of New\r\nSouth Wales to the adjustment of affairs in Canada. Both questions\r\nresulted from the American War. The refugees from the old American\r\ncolonies, who now huddled with their families in the purlieus of Soho,\r\nformed the tough nucleus of what had been a very large and influential\r\nband of men in the States. Writers of the school of Bancroft used\r\nto treat the Loyalists as traitors who richly deserved the hanging\r\nor shooting in cold blood which not seldom befell them at the hands\r\nof righteous patriots. Those, however, who regard history, not as a\r\nmeans of enforcing certain opinions, but of reflecting the life of\r\nthe time, are generally agreed that the Loyalists acted from sincere\r\nconviction, which led them deliberately to face cruel and prolonged\r\npersecution. At the outset of the war they numbered about one third of\r\nthe population of the States; and, at least 20,000 of them joined the\r\nBritish forces.[710] By the end of the war about 60,000 Loyalists were\r\ncompelled to leave the States, of whom nearly one half settled in the\r\nfuture province of New Brunswick; some 10,000 went to found the British\r\npopulation in Upper Canada (Ontario); but many sailed with the retiring\r\ngarrisons to Great Britain.[711]\r\n\r\nIt is with these last that we are here at first concerned. Their number\r\nwas given as 428 in the official inquiry of 1782–3,[712] but that list\r\nwas probably incomplete. Their condition soon became pitiable. By the\r\nTreaty of Versailles (September 1783) the American Congress pledged\r\nitself to recommend the States of the Union to restore the property\r\nconfiscated from the Loyalists. The States ignored the recommendation.\r\nPitt has sometimes been blamed for not doing more to press the\r\nfulfilment of this treaty obligation, which was carried out only by\r\nSouth Carolina. But he seems to have taken the only means possible,\r\nnamely, of refusing to surrender certain of the western forts of the\r\nStates, until satisfaction was accorded on this head.[713] John Adams,\r\nwho arrived in London as ambassador from the United States in 1786,\r\nreceived that answer to his protest, a fact which suffices to disprove\r\nthe statement that the clause of the treaty relating to the Loyalists\r\nwas inserted merely for effect.[714]\r\n\r\nPitt further sought to carry out the stipulations for the collection\r\nof debts due to the Loyalists before the beginning of the war. He sent\r\nout a Mr. Anstey to deal with these thorny and almost hopeless claims.\r\nThe matter dragged on; and a letter forwarded to the Prime Minister on\r\n30th January 1787 refers to the inquiry as still incomplete.[715] In\r\n1785 Pitt offered to grant due compensation to the American Loyalists;\r\nbut long and most discreditable delays ensued. Several petitions\r\nforwarded to Pitt show that payments were either inadequate or were\r\noften deferred, and that the petitioners were in much distress.[716]\r\nThe letter above referred to states that from £60,000 to £80,000 a\r\nyear had been granted in pensions; but that in 1787, owing to deaths\r\nand other causes, the amount fell to £50,000. Even this exceeds\r\nthe average of the official amount by some £7,000.[717] The writer\r\ngoes on to assert that the utmost possible had been done to relieve\r\nthe distress, and shows the unreasonableness of the claim of some\r\nLoyalists for compensation for the loss of their professions. Finally\r\nthe whole matter was cleared up by the proposal of Pitt to the House\r\nof Commons on 6th June 1788 to vote the sum of £1,228,239 to the\r\nLoyalists in proportion to the merits of their cases, and £113,952\r\nto the claimants from West Florida. To this the House agreed, Burke\r\ncommending the proposal as “a new and noble instance of national bounty\r\nand generosity.”[718]\r\n\r\nPitt evidently considered the question as settled by the distribution\r\nof this sum and of certain grants of land in Canada; for in the year\r\n1792, when other claims were forwarded to him through the medium of Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, he replied as follows in a letter of 29th May 1792:\r\n\r\n    On the fullest consideration of the subject, I have not thought\r\n    myself justified in proposing to open the Commission again for\r\n    inquiry into those cases which were not brought forward within any\r\n    of the periods before limited; and under these circumstances it\r\n    seems impossible to give any compensation for particular losses.\r\n    The plan has therefore been adopted of giving some provision by\r\n    grants of land in Canada, to such persons of this description\r\n    as may be willing to accept it; and of advancing them certain\r\n    sums of money (according to the classes in which they have been\r\n    distributed) for the purpose of assisting them in removing and\r\n    in settling themselves. With respect to the three persons whom\r\n    you particularly mention of the name of Plater, Harding and\r\n    Williams, the granting to them the sums recommended by Col.\r\n    Delaney was delayed from its appearing that they had formerly had\r\n    an advance for the purpose of enabling them to go to America; but\r\n    notwithstanding this circumstance it has been determined from the\r\n    nature of their cases and your strong testimony in their favour,\r\n    to comply with this recommendation, which will be immediately\r\n    carried into effect.[719]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Loyalists in Canada and Nova Scotia produced\r\nfar-reaching results. About 28,000 settled in Nova Scotia, the larger\r\nportion of them selecting the banks of the River St. John. Besides\r\nbeing far removed from Halifax, the seat of government, they found\r\nthemselves absolutely without influence in the administration, as\r\nthe Governor refused to enlarge the Legislative Council by admitting\r\none of their number. They therefore petitioned the Home Government\r\nfor separation from Nova Scotia--a request which was at once granted\r\n(1784). Pitt thus showed his complete confidence in the Loyalists and\r\nin the policy of according full liberty in local affairs to a community\r\nwhich obviously needed such a boon.\r\n\r\nNot very dissimilar were the results of the influx of the Loyalists\r\ninto Canada Proper. About 10,000 of them crossed Lake Ontario or the\r\nNiagara River, and formed a thin fringe of settlements along the Upper\r\nSt. Lawrence and Lakes Ontario and Erie. In 1784 Governor Haldimand\r\ngranted to them large tracts of land, generally in proportion to the\r\nservices rendered during the war.[720] In many cases, the settlement\r\nwas of a semi-military character; and everywhere the colonists took a\r\npride in adding to their names “U.E.,” to denote the United Empire for\r\nwhich they had fought and suffered. The lot of many of them was hard\r\nin the extreme; but it seems that even those who had been reared in\r\nluxury preferred the rigours of the Canadian winter in a log-hut to the\r\npersecutions which would have been their lot in the United States.\r\n\r\nA settlement of a very different kind was that of de Puisaye and some\r\nfifty French royalists in the autumn of 1798. Puisaye was a man of\r\nfine physique and perseverance, as appeared in his continuance of the\r\nBreton revolt long after the unmanly departure of the Comte d’Artois\r\nfrom the Ile d’Yeu in 1795 (see Chapter XXXVI). But by the year 1798 he\r\nwearied of that fell work, and proposed with other adventurous spirits\r\nto settle in Canada. The Duke of Portland and Windham favoured the\r\nscheme; and a district named Windham was allotted to them between York\r\n(Toronto) and Lake Simcoe. But the ill-fortune of the French noblesse\r\ndogged them in the New World. They arrived too late. Probably they\r\nknew nothing of the work required of them. Even more probably they\r\nquarrelled, intrigued, and formed factions. Puisaye left the place and\r\nsettled for a time near the Niagara River, until at the Peace of Amiens\r\nhe went back to England. The Windham settlement went to pieces, thus\r\nonce more revealing the incompetence of that product of the _ancien\r\nrégime_, the French _seigneur_.[721]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the United Empire Loyalists altered the political\r\nsituation in Canada in two ways: it provided for the first time a\r\nrelatively large body of English-speaking settlers, and it brought to\r\nthe front the question of representative institutions. Hitherto the\r\nFrench _habitans_, scattered sparsely along the Lower St. Lawrence and\r\nthe Richelieu Rivers, had shown little or no desire in that direction;\r\nbut questions arising out of the war caused some stir in those\r\nprimitive communities. A time of much unrest followed. The British\r\nmerchants and traders at Quebec and Montreal also had their grievances\r\nagainst the Government and the French majority; so that in 1784 a\r\nCommittee comprising men of those towns petitioned the Governor for an\r\nelective House of Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the meaning of this request, we must remember\r\nthat election had no place in the Canadian Government. By the Quebec\r\nAct of 1774, which regulated public affairs for the colony, the\r\nadministration of affairs rested with a Governor representing the\r\nKing, an Executive Council consisting of members selected by him, and\r\na Legislative Council formed on the same basis. The framers of that\r\nmeasure had also frankly recognized the fact that the population of\r\nthe colony was overwhelmingly French. They therefore provided for the\r\ncontinuance of French law and French customs, both religious and\r\nagrarian--a well-meant measure which, while ensuring the loyalty of the\r\nCanadians during the American War of Independence, aroused the anger of\r\nBritish settlers and merchants. The United Empire Loyalists in Upper\r\nCanada found these French customs insufferable. They had not left the\r\nUnited States in order to merge themselves in a community modelled on\r\nthe France of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in other respects, the Quebec Act failed to meet the needs\r\nof the colonists; so that Fox described Canada as having no settled\r\ngovernment.[722] Here he erred. The bane of that land was too much\r\ngovernment. The settlers were beset by too many decrees, several\r\nof which were inapplicable to the needs of the growing mercantile\r\ncommunities at Quebec and Montreal, who found themselves hampered\r\nby the French laws and were in constant friction with the “ancient”\r\ncolonists. They therefore sent the petition of 1784, requesting the\r\nbestowal of representative institutions and of British law, both\r\nmercantile and criminal; but they admitted the need of retaining French\r\nlaws for agriculture, property, religion, and social life. Such an\r\nadmission was repugnant to settlers in the upper districts, who in 1785\r\npetitioned for entire exemption from French laws and customs.[723]\r\n\r\nAs was but natural, Pitt and his colleagues seem to have been perplexed\r\nby the difficulty of this problem, which certainly was one of infinite\r\ncomplexity. It soon appeared, as the outcome of official inquiries,\r\nthat, taking Canada as a whole, there was only one English-speaking\r\ncolonist to fifteen French. The small British population was centred\r\nalmost entirely in Quebec and Montreal (even there it was only a third\r\nof the population), or else straggled along the Upper St. Lawrence into\r\nthe almost unknown wilds between Lakes Ontario and Huron. How was it\r\npossible, at the bidding of so insignificant a minority, to repeal the\r\nFrench laws and enrage the majority? Would not France and the States be\r\ncertain to intervene and thus fill to the full the cup of disaster?\r\n\r\nFor the present the Pitt Cabinet limited its efforts to the\r\nstrengthening of the executive powers at Quebec by enlarging the\r\npowers of the new Governor-General, Lord Dorchester (1786) so that\r\nthey extended over the upper districts, and also over New Brunswick\r\nand Nova Scotia. Meanwhile Pitt and Sydney awaited the results of the\r\ninquiries set on foot in Canada; and, though the resulting delay was\r\nirritating at the time, it proved to be beneficial; for before the\r\nMinistry at home could frame its Bill, the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution had minimized the danger of intervention from France.\r\n\r\nMishaps to the despatches, the substitution of Grenville for Sydney\r\nas Home Secretary, in June 1789, and the General Election of 1790,\r\nfurther retarded legislation on this subject. Twice in the year\r\n1790 Grenville had to apologize to the House for delays due to the\r\nterrible weather of the winter of 1789–90.[724] On the latter occasion\r\nhe described his endeavours to get at the truth of the situation in\r\nCanada, his conferences with his colleagues, and his assiduity in\r\ndrafting the Bill which he promised to place before them as soon as he\r\nreceived Dorchester’s replies to certain questions. This declaration\r\nis interesting as showing that the famous Act of 1791 was really\r\ndrafted by Grenville, and that he considered it his own. In view,\r\nhowever, of his very recent appointment to the Home Office, and of his\r\nintimate relations to Pitt, we may be sure that the spirit informing\r\nthe measure was that of the Prime Minister. We now know, however, that\r\nGrenville was responsible for the proposal to confer hereditary titles\r\non the members of the Governor’s Legislative Council;[725] and it is\r\nsignificant that, while Pitt acquiesced in it, no such creation of a\r\ncolonial nobility ever took place.\r\n\r\nGrenville having been raised to the peerage in November 1790, Pitt\r\nmoved for leave to bring in the Canada Bill to the Lower House (4th\r\nMarch 1791). In an explanatory speech, he stated the aim of the measure\r\nto be “to promote the happiness and internal policy [progress?] of the\r\nprovince and to put an end to the differences of opinion and growing\r\ncompetition that had for some years existed in Canada between the\r\nancient inhabitants and the new settlers from England and America\r\n[_sic_] on several important points, and to bring the government of\r\nthe province, as near as the nature and situation of it would admit,\r\nto the British Constitution.” He therefore proposed to divide Canada\r\ninto an Upper and a Lower Province, “the former for the English and\r\nAmerican settlers, the lower for the Canadians.” The inconveniences\r\nthat might result to the minority in the latter province would, he\r\nhoped, be averted by the election of a House of Assembly, which\r\nwould propose measures, acting therein conjointly with a Legislative\r\nCouncil, of members nominated for life. As it has been stated that Pitt\r\navowed his intention to create two provinces whose mutual jealousies\r\nwould prevent rebellion, it is desirable to notice that in this first\r\nspeech he insisted that separation would be the only means of ending\r\nthe existing strifes and of according to each of them the blessings\r\nof the English Constitution.[726] We may also remark that Pitt seems\r\nto have paid no heed to the suggestion that the Lower Province might\r\nbe governed autocratically, while Upper Canada had representative\r\ninstitutions. This would become impossible when the French _habitans_\r\ngained political consciousness; and Pitt was surely right in rejecting\r\nthat makeshift.\r\n\r\nHis policy was, however, to be sharply criticized, especially by\r\nthe British minority in Lower Canada. In a petition dated London,\r\n15th March 1791 (which is printed in full in “Pitt and Napoleon\r\nMiscellanies”), seven firms engaged in the Canada trade pointed out\r\nthe defects of the measure; and it is highly significant that some of\r\ntheir objections foreshadowed those which were to be so ably set forth\r\nin Lord Durham’s Report on Canada (1839). The petition was drafted\r\nby Lymburner, a Quebec merchant who had drawn up that of 1784. The\r\nMemorialists declared that the Bill before Parliament would perpetuate\r\nmany of the worst evils of the Quebec Act, which sprang from the\r\nattempt to impose one code of laws on two peoples differing widely in\r\ntheir manner of life, customs, and needs. They asserted that the only\r\nmeans of soothing the strifes was to apply English law to the English\r\npopulation and French law to the French; that any division of the\r\ncolony would be artificial and would debar Upper Canada from maritime\r\ntrade. The petition concluded with the statesmanlike suggestion that\r\nthe only cure for the ills of Canada was to merge her two peoples in a\r\nself-governing community.\r\n\r\nAlready Dorchester had offered objections to the proposed division of\r\nCanada; but Grenville in his despatch of 20th October 1789 set aside\r\nhis arguments on the ground that, while weighty as against the present\r\nnon-representative system, they did not apply to that which was about\r\nto be proposed.\r\n\r\n    When (he wrote) the resolution was taken of establishing a\r\n    Provincial Legislature, ... to be chosen in part by the people,\r\n    every consideration of policy seemed to render it desirable that\r\n    the great preponderance possessed in the Upper Districts by the\r\n    King’s antient subjects, and in the lower by the French Canadians,\r\n    should have this effect and operation in separate Legislatures,\r\n    rather than that these two bodies of people should be blended\r\n    together in the first formation of the new Constitution, and\r\n    before sufficient time has been allowed for the removal of antient\r\n    prejudices, by the habit of obedience to the same Government and by\r\n    the sense of a common interest.[727]\r\n\r\nThese words imply not so much distrust of the colonists as a sense of\r\nthe need of proceeding tentatively with what was a novel departure. It\r\nis clear that Ministers looked on the proposed arrangements as more or\r\nless provisional, and in the last phrases we seem to catch a glimpse\r\nof a more peaceful future when reunion would be the natural step. For\r\nthe present, Grenville continued, it would be well to strengthen the\r\nGovernor’s Legislative Council by according to its members some title\r\nof honour (a baronetage was first hinted at) which would attach them\r\nto the new institutions. Another desirable step was the reservation of\r\nCrown Lands in the new districts, in order to provide the Government\r\nwith a fixed and improving revenue. Grenville even suggested that, had\r\nthis been done in the original thirteen colonies, a cause of friction\r\nand revolt would have been removed.\r\n\r\nMinisters must have had a deep sense of the advantages of their\r\nproposal when they disregarded the advice of the Governor-General and\r\nthe firm opposition of the British settlers in Lower Canada and of\r\ntheir connections in London. The measure was pushed on, despite a long\r\nspeech against it by Lymburner at the bar of the House, in which he\r\nasserted that the division of the provinces, when once accomplished,\r\ncould never be reversed--an assertion falsified by facts in 1841. The\r\ndebates on the subject were rendered memorable by an incident which\r\nwill be described later (Chapter XXIV). Burke had persisted in dragging\r\nthe French Revolution into the discussion, and, when interrupted by\r\nFox, passionately declared that the friendship between them was at an\r\nend. As for the question before the House, Fox opposed, while Burke\r\ndefended, the proposed division of Canada. The Whig leader further\r\nobjected to the proposal to make a legislative councillorship an\r\nhereditary honour; and he urged Ministers to increase the size of the\r\nHouses of Assembly. Pitt carried his proposal that they should number\r\nsixteen for the Upper Province and fifty for the Lower. Finally the\r\nHouse agreed to leave open the question of the hereditary tenure of\r\ncouncillorships; and it is noteworthy that no hereditary title was\r\nconferred. The Bill became law on 14th May 1791.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the suitability of this measure to Canada would involve a\r\nrecital of events in that colony down to the time of Lord Durham’s\r\nfamous Report of 1839. All that concerns us here is the question of\r\nPitt’s attitude towards those complex problems. His conduct cannot be\r\npronounced hasty or doctrinaire. Not until official evidence and advice\r\nwere forthcoming did he and his colleagues sketch the first outlines\r\nof the scheme. But when he had made up his mind, he held on his way\r\nwith resolute purpose. This will appear if we remember that three\r\nMinisters were successively responsible for the Bill. Sydney drafted\r\nit. Grenville revised the evidence and recast the Bill;[728] but it\r\nfell to Henry Dundas to amend it and carry it into execution. As the\r\nBill was but little changed, we may infer that one mind was at all\r\ntimes paramount.\r\n\r\nCanadian historians have generally allowed that the motives of Pitt\r\nwere enlightened; and, the assertion sometimes made, that they were\r\nbased on a resolve to make use of the hostility of French and British\r\nsettlers so as to prevent revolt, is contradicted by all that is known\r\nof his manly and hopeful nature. His speeches ring with a feeling of\r\nconfidence in the healing effect of representative institutions; and it\r\nshould be remembered that, if in 1837 they were found inadequate to the\r\nneeds of the progressive Upper Province, they yet nursed that little\r\ncommunity into youth. This is all that can be expected from a measure\r\nwhich was necessarily tentative.[729] The chief objections against his\r\ndivision of the provinces were that it tended to weaken the British\r\ncommunity in the Lower Province, while it also cut off the Upper\r\nProvince from the sea and placed it at the mercy of the Customs’ laws\r\nframed at Quebec.\r\n\r\nTo this it may be replied that, even if the infant settlements of the\r\nUpper St. Lawrence had remained bound up with the French districts,\r\nthe English-speaking population would still have been in a decided\r\nminority, and that it was better to allow the United Empire Loyalists\r\nto carve out their own destiny, as they were doing in New Brunswick,\r\nin the hope that time would bring about an equipoise between the two\r\npeoples. The erection of a new Customs’ barrier was truly a serious\r\nmatter; but it resulted from geographical and racial conditions which\r\nwere irreversible, save by the Act of Union, which, under happier\r\nauspices, came exactly half a century later. In the period 1791–1841\r\nUpper Canada grew from a population of about 10,000 to 465,000; and\r\nin that fact may be found the best justification for Pitt’s Canadian\r\npolicy. When looked at from the point of view of 1791, it seems to\r\ndeserve higher praise than has generally been its meed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE TRADE\r\n\r\n  Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n  Receive our air, that moment they are free;\r\n  They touch our country, and their shackles fall;\r\n  That’s noble, and bespeaks a nation proud\r\n  And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,\r\n  And let it circulate through every vein\r\n  Of all your Empire--that where Britain’s power\r\n  Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.\r\n\r\n                                      COWPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat movements are too often connected with the names of one or two\r\nprominent men, to the neglect of others whose services are highly\r\nmeritorious. Laziness rather than unfairness may be assigned as the\r\ncause of this mistake. The popular consciousness, unable to hold\r\ntogether names, according to gradation of merit, settles on one or two\r\nas convenient pegs for the memory, and discards the remainder. Hence\r\nit comes about that commanders acquire undying fame which may be due\r\nto their chiefs of staff; and statesmen are reputed the authors of\r\nmeasures which they accepted doubtfully from their permanent officials.\r\n\r\nIt is by some such process of hasty labelling that the name of\r\nWilberforce is often affixed alone to the movement for the liberation\r\nof the slaves. True, he deserves to hold a very high place in the\r\nroll-call of the champions of philanthropy. But the following short\r\nsummary will suffice to suggest that many other names, now wellnigh\r\nforgotten, deserve to be held in equal honour. Of those who helped\r\nto arouse public opinion on this question George Fox and William\r\nEdmundson come first in point of time. They lifted up their voice\r\nin and after the year 1671 against the cruelties inflicted on negro\r\nslaves in Barbadoes and elsewhere; but we do not find that their views\r\non slavery affected a large number of their co-religionists until\r\nthe year 1727, when the Society of Friends in their annual meeting\r\nat London passed a resolution condemning both the slave trade and\r\nthe owning of slaves.[730] This conviction spread to the Quakers of\r\nPennsylvania (the “Quaker State”) where worthy members of the Society\r\nsucceeded in arousing public opinion even against the institution of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nReverting to England, with which alone we are concerned, we find the\r\nQuakers striving to stop the worst abuses of the Slave Trade. The\r\nTreaty of Utrecht (1713) had handed over to England a great part\r\nof that traffic; and Chatham himself boasted that his conquests in\r\nAfrica during the Seven Years’ War had placed almost the whole of it\r\nin British hands. When a man of his elevation of thought held this\r\nlanguage, we can imagine that the many looked on the trade as a pillar\r\nof the Empire, and derided its few opponents as lunatics.\r\n\r\nNot that public opinion was wholly blind to its evils. In the year 1750\r\nParliament had passed an Act forbidding the kidnapping of negroes; but\r\nit proved wholly ineffective; and, as the horrors connected with the\r\nSlave Trade became better known, the Society of Friends warned all\r\nits members to abstain from any connection whatever with so unholy\r\na traffic (1758). Three years later it resolved to disown any who\r\nshould disregard this warning.[731] Thus, to the religious zeal and\r\nconsistency of the Friends we are indebted for the first attempts to\r\nabolish this traffic. No small community has ever rendered a greater\r\nservice to the cause of religion and humanity.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted in passing that their action and that of later\r\nabolitionists helped to link together these two ideals in a manner\r\nwhich was to be infinitely fruitful. In this connection Granville\r\nSharp, John Wesley, Clarkson, Paley, Wilberforce, Buxton, Zachary\r\nMacaulay, and many others may be named as proving the close union\r\nthat subsisted between religious conviction and the philanthropic\r\nmovement. The power of religion to impel to good works shone forth in\r\nall of them. Wilberforce gave scarcely a thought to the slaves until\r\nthe work of grace began in his own heart. In 1774 Wesley published his\r\nwork, “Thoughts upon Slavery,” which greatly furthered the cause.\r\nIndeed, it should be noticed as one of the influences marking off the\r\nphilanthropic movement in England from that of France that here for\r\nthe most part it was an offshoot of the Evangelical Revival, whereas\r\nin France the efforts of Voltaire and the Encyclopaedists imparted\r\nto similar efforts a strongly anti-Catholic bias. These facts were\r\ndestined to mould the future of religion and politics in the two lands.\r\nHere philanthropists and statesmen were the mainstay of religion. There\r\nthe slow cessation of persecution and the reluctant abandonment of\r\nprivileges by the Roman Church ranged social reformers against her,\r\nwith results that were to appear in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in England law reinforced the efforts of philanthropists.\r\nIn 1772, Chief Justice Mansfield gave a decision that a slave who\r\nlanded on English soil became a free man. The case arose out of the\r\nconduct of a West India merchant settled in London, who by sheer\r\nbrutality had rendered a slave useless for work, had turned him\r\nadrift, but again claimed him when healed by a kind-hearted physician.\r\nGranville Sharp thenceforth made it the business of his life to see\r\njustice done to the negro race, and was chiefly instrumental in\r\nbringing the whole question to a practical issue by founding in 1787\r\nthe first Abolitionist Society.\r\n\r\nBefore adverting to its labours, with which Pitt so deeply sympathized,\r\nwe may notice a few facts connected with the traffic in human flesh.\r\nThe evidence of Robert Norris, of Liverpool, before a Parliamentary\r\nCommission in the year 1775 showed that of the 74,000 negroes believed\r\nto be taken annually from Africa to the New World, British ships\r\ncarried about 38,000; French, 20,000; Portuguese, 10,000; Dutch, 4,000;\r\nDanish, 2,000. The greater part came from Bonny, New Calabar, the\r\nGold Coast, and Loango. Gambia is credited with exporting only 700,\r\na suspiciously low estimate. The same witness asserted that only one\r\nslave in twenty-seven died on the voyage, while one seaman in sixteen\r\nsuccumbed.[732] Estimates, however, varied very greatly. Macpherson\r\ngave 97,000 as the number of slaves imported into the New World from\r\nAfrica in the year 1768.[733] Efforts were made by merchants to depict\r\nthe passage on the ocean as pleasant, amusements being provided on the\r\nway. But it soon transpired that the chief amusement was compulsory\r\nsinging, while the “dancing” proved to be jumping in chains at the\r\nsound of the lash. It was also known that very many negroes died soon\r\nafter landing during the process known as seasoning to the climate and\r\nwork; that the whip was freely used in the plantations; and that the\r\nmortality among the slaves was extremely heavy. In this connection the\r\nname of Burke deserves to be held in honour; for he proposed that the\r\nAttorney-General in each colony should be empowered to act as Protector\r\nof the negroes.\r\n\r\nThus, even before the Abolitionist Society began its labours, public\r\nopinion was beginning to brand the traffic with infamy. The year 1783\r\nsaw efforts made in Parliament to repress some of its worst abuses;\r\nand the Society of Friends then sent up the first petition for the\r\ntotal abrogation of the traffic in British vessels.[734] The year 1785\r\nwitnessed the publication of Clarkson’s Latin essay on the subject; and\r\na twelvemonth later it came out in English. In 1783 also the efforts of\r\nthe Rev. James Ramsay, Rector of Teston, Kent, who had seen the evils\r\nof slavery during his residence at St. Kitt’s, brought the subject\r\nhome to the mind of his neighbour, Lady Middleton; and she in her\r\nturn impressed it as a Christian duty on Wilberforce to bring forward\r\na motion in Parliament. As this appeal harmonized with the strong\r\nreligious convictions now swaying the nature of the young member for\r\nYorkshire, he felt strongly moved to take up the cause of the negroes.\r\nIn the year 1786 he made many inquiries among African and West India\r\nmerchants, and found much error in their information. After probing the\r\nmatter, he resolved to consult Pitt as to his making this question the\r\nchief object of his life.\r\n\r\nThe conversation took place under an old oak-tree in Pitt’s grounds\r\nat Holwood, above the steep descent into Keston vale. The opinions\r\nof the two friends, as we have seen, had somewhat diverged. Pitt\r\ndid not sympathize with the pietism which now dominated the life of\r\nWilberforce; but his religion was of a working type, and he may have\r\nwelcomed the growth of convictions of a more practical kind, which\r\nwould wean his friend from excessive introspection. Certain it is that\r\nhe urged him to take up the cause of the slaves as one well suited\r\nto his character and talents. Wilberforce therefore resolved to give\r\nnotice of his intention to bring the subject before Parliament. Would\r\nthat we knew the details of that conversation illustrative of the\r\ncharacter of two of the most interesting men of the age. Even so, the\r\nresolve there formed renders illustrious the tree under which it was\r\nformed, fitly called “Wilberforce’s oak.”[735]\r\n\r\nThe three strands of effort which we have traced from their feeble\r\nbeginnings, viz., those originating with the Quakers, Granville Sharp,\r\nand Ramsay, were now to combine. In 1787, as we have seen, Granville\r\nSharp, in connection with London Friends, formed a “Committee for\r\nprocuring Evidence on the Slave Trade,” which was to become the famous\r\nAbolitionist Society. At the first meeting on 22nd May 1787, only ten\r\nwere present. Their names deserve to be recorded. Granville Sharp\r\n(Chairman), J. Barton, Thomas Clarkson, W. Dillwyn, S. Hoare (junr.),\r\nJ. Hooper, J. Lloyd, R. Phillips, P. Sanson, J. Woods. All but two were\r\nQuakers, and the minutes and letters abound in “thous” and “thees.”\r\nOne of the aims of the Committee was to distribute Clarkson’s and\r\nother pamphlets on the subject. In October 1787 the Committee received\r\na letter from Brissot and Clavière, the future leaders of the French\r\nGirondins, expressing the wish to promote their views in France, where,\r\nas is well known, the abolitionists achieved a speedy but illusory\r\ntriumph in 1790.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                              _Emery Walker Ph. sc._\r\n\r\n  _William Wilberforce_\r\n  _from an unfinished painting by Sir T. Lawrence_\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs there has been some controversy respecting the initiation of this\r\nmovement, it is well to note that not until 30th October 1787 did\r\nthe Committee receive a letter from Wilberforce. He then asked for\r\ninformation as speedily as possible. The Minutes of the Committee\r\nshow that he was not a member until the year 1794, and it is an\r\nexaggeration to say that “he directed their endeavours.”[736] Their\r\naim was to stir up the great towns to petition to Parliament. In this\r\nthey achieved a marked success. Indeed, it was rather the formation\r\nof a strong public opinion by the labours of the Committee, than the\r\nmany motions in Parliament, which at last brought triumph to the cause.\r\nManchester and Birmingham soon displayed great interest in the subject.\r\nA kindred society was formed at the latter town. That at London grew\r\nin importance, and funds came in rapidly. Wilberforce wrote to\r\nEden on 18th January 1788: “The fire is kindled in various parts of\r\nthe Kingdom and the flame spreads wider and wider.”[737] One of the\r\npetitions resulting from the labours of the parent committee deserves\r\nmention here. It came from 769 freemen cutlers of Sheffield, was dated\r\n24th April 1789, and stated that, though the exports of petitioners to\r\nthe African coast might fall off if the Slave Trade were abolished, yet\r\nthey were so convinced of its inhumanity that they begged Parliament to\r\nsweep it away.[738]\r\n\r\nPetitions of the same tenour had long been coming in, and Pitt\r\ntherefore instituted an inquiry by the Privy Council respecting\r\nthe whole question, including the condition of the slaves in the\r\ncolonies.[739] One of the replies, that from Bermuda, of 10th June\r\n1788, is typically optimistic. Governor Browne affirmed that the slaves\r\nin those islands were exceedingly well treated. Out of 4,900 slaves not\r\nmore than five a year deserted. During the late war many had served on\r\nprivateers and, when captured and taken to the United States, nearly\r\nall managed to make their way back to their masters. This report is a\r\nspecimen of the arguments which compelled Ministers to some measure of\r\ncaution.[740]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, abundant proof that Pitt, though a recent recruit\r\nto the movement, espoused it with enthusiasm. During the difficult\r\nnegotiations with France in the autumn of 1787, we find Wilberforce\r\ninforming Eden, our envoy at Paris, of Pitt’s interest in the endeavour\r\nto stop the Slave Trade, a matter which would be greatly facilitated\r\nif France would agree to take the same step.[741] On 2nd November Pitt\r\nfollowed up his friend’s letter by another appeal to Eden to induce the\r\nFrench Government “to discontinue the villainous traffic now carried on\r\nin Africa.”[742] The following letter, hitherto unpublished, from Pitt\r\nto Eden, further shows his hope that Eden, who was soon to take the\r\nembassy at Madrid, would be able to influence that Court also:\r\n\r\n                                Downing Street, _Dec. 7, 1787_.[743]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wilberforce has communicated to me your last letter respecting\r\n    the African business. The more I reflect upon it, the more anxious\r\n    and impatient I am that the business should be brought as speedily\r\n    as possible to a point; that, if the real difficulties of it can\r\n    be overcome, it may not suffer from the prejudices and interested\r\n    objections which will multiply during the discussion. Of course it\r\n    cannot yet be ripe for any official communication; and when you\r\n    transmit the memorandum, which I see you were to draw up, I hope\r\n    it will be quite secret for the present. If you see any chance\r\n    of success in France, I hope you will lay your ground as soon as\r\n    possible with a view to Spain also. I am considering what to do in\r\n    Holland, but the course of business there makes the secrecy, which\r\n    is necessary at least for a time, more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the French Government in January 1788 was discouraging.\r\nMontmorin and his colleagues avowed their sympathy with the cause,\r\nbut, fearing that it would not succeed in England, refused to commit\r\nthemselves.[744] The advent of Necker to power in August aroused Pitt’s\r\nhopes;[745] but he too temporized, thereby prejudicing the success of\r\nthe cause in these islands. Spain refused to stir in the matter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wilberforce had given notice of a motion on the subject, but\r\na severe illness in February and March 1788 left him in a state of\r\nweakness which precluded the least effort. Before leaving for Bath, he\r\nbegged Pitt to bring forward the motion for him. The Prime Minister\r\nconsented, says Wilberforce, “with a warmth of principle and friendship\r\nthat have made me love him better than I ever did before.” Nevertheless\r\nhe acted with caution. Up to the beginning of the year 1788, at least,\r\nhe had not brought the matter before the Cabinet, probably because he\r\nknew that most of its members would oppose him. In the country also\r\na formidable opposition was arising, and, as usually happens in such\r\ncases, enthusiasts clamoured at delay as treason to the cause.[746]\r\nPerhaps it was this which led him to request a conference with Sharp.\r\nIt took place on 21st April, and is thus reported in the Minutes of the\r\nCommittee:\r\n\r\n    He [Granville Sharp] had a full opportunity of explaining that\r\n    the desire of the Committee went to a full abolition of the Slave\r\n    Trade. Mr. Pitt assured him that his heart was with us, and that\r\n    he considered himself pledged to Mr. Wilberforce that the cause\r\n    should not sustain any injury from his indisposition; but at the\r\n    same time that the subject was of great political importance,\r\n    and it was requisite to proceed in the business with temper and\r\n    prudence. He did not apprehend, as the examination before the Privy\r\n    Council would yet take up some time, that the subject could be\r\n    fully investigated in the present session of Parliament, but said\r\n    he would consider whether the forms of the House would admit of any\r\n    measures that would be obligatory on them to take it up early in\r\n    the ensuing session.[747]\r\n\r\nOn 9th May Pitt brought his motion before the House, but pending the\r\nconclusion of the official inquiry, he offered no opinion on the\r\nsubject, for which he was sharply twitted by Fox and Burke. His conduct\r\nwas far from pleasing to the more ardent spirits. One of them, the\r\nvenerable Sir William Dolben, member for the University of Oxford,\r\nafter inspecting a slave-ship in the Thames, determined to lose no\r\ntime in alleviating the misery of the many living cargoes that crossed\r\nthe ocean. He therefore brought in a Bill for temporarily regulating\r\nthe transport of slaves in British ships. In the course of the\r\ndiscussions Pitt declared that, even though the proposed regulations\r\ninvolved the trade in ruin, as was maintained, he would nevertheless\r\nvote for them; and if the trade could not be regulated, he would vote\r\nfor its abolition as “shocking to humanity, abominable to be carried\r\non by any country, and which reflected the greatest dishonour on the\r\nBritish Senate and the British nation.” He further startled the House\r\nby proposing that the regulations should become operative from that\r\nday--10th June. The hold which he had on members was shown by the\r\ndivision, fifty-six voting for the measure and only five against it.\r\nIn the Upper House no minister save the Duke of Richmond ventured to\r\ndefend this unusual enactment; and the Chancellor, Thurlow, spoke\r\nstrongly against it. Sydney also opposed it, though with moderation\r\n(25th June). Pitt’s feelings when he heard of their action are shown\r\nin a phrase of his letter to Grenville, dated Cambridge, 29th June,\r\nthat if the Bill failed he and the opposers would not remain members\r\nof the same Cabinet. This declaration does honour to his heart and his\r\njudgement. It proves the warmth of his feelings on the subject and\r\nhis sense of the need of discipline in the Cabinet. Had the measure\r\nfailed to pass the Lords, a Cabinet crisis of the gravest kind would\r\nhave arisen. As it was, however, the great efforts put forth by Pitt\r\namong his friends sufficed to carry the day against Thurlow by a\r\nmajority of two. We catch a glimpse of what an average man thought of\r\nthis incident in the pages of Wraxall. After adverting to the nobility\r\nof Pitt’s motives and the strength of Thurlow’s arguments against the\r\nretrospective action of the Bill, the chronicler thus passes judgement:\r\n“Thurlow argued as a statesman, Pitt acted as a moralist.” We also have\r\nthe warrant of Wraxall for stating that, not until George III gave his\r\nassent to the measure, did Pitt “allow” him to prorogue Parliament.[748]\r\n\r\nShip-owners and slave-owners had, however, been driven only from the\r\nfirst outwork of their citadel, and had time to strengthen their\r\ndefences before the matter came up again in 1789. After a delay, caused\r\nby the King’s malady and by the length of the inquiry into the Slave\r\nTrade by a committee of the Privy Council, Wilberforce brought the\r\nquestion before the House on 12th May in one of the ablest and most\r\neloquent speeches of that age. For three and a half hours he held the\r\nattention of the House as he recounted the horrors which slave-hunting\r\nspread through Africa, and the hell of suffering of the middle passage.\r\nHe showed how legitimate trade would increase with the growth of\r\nconfidence between man and man in that Continent, and he asserted\r\nthat the sympathies of King Louis XVI, Necker, and the French nation\r\nwould probably lead that country to follow our example in abolishing a\r\ntraffic degrading to all concerned in it. He then proved from official\r\ninformation concerning the slaves in our West India islands, that wise\r\ntreatment of them and suppression of vice would ensure a sufficient\r\nincrease of population to meet the needs of the planters. He concluded\r\nby moving twelve resolutions setting forth the facts of the case as\r\ndetailed in the Report of the Privy Council. This mode of procedure\r\nearned general approval. Burke bestowed his blessing on the proposal\r\n(for such it was in effect) to abolish so hateful a traffic. Pitt gave\r\nthe measure his warm approval, but stated that he was prepared to give\r\na hearing to all objections. One such he noticed, namely, that foreign\r\nnations would step in and secretly supply our West India islands with\r\nslaves. He declared that Great Britain was strong enough to prevent\r\nso insidious a device; but he hoped, rather, that other peoples would\r\ndesire to share in the honour of abolishing the trade; and we might\r\nconfidently negotiate with them to that end, or wait for the effect\r\nwhich our example would produce. Fox followed in the same strain, and\r\nprophesied that France would soon “catch a spark from our fire and run\r\na race with us in promoting the ends of humanity.”[749]\r\n\r\nBut these unanswerable arguments were of no avail against shippers,\r\nslave-owners, and colonial traders. In vain did Wilberforce point\r\nout that the prosperity of Liverpool did not depend upon the Slave\r\nTrade; for the tonnage of the slave-ships was only one-fifteenth of\r\nthat of the whole port. Liverpool saw nothing but ruin ahead; and it\r\nmust be admitted that that class of traffic was then by far the most\r\nlucrative to the growing city on the Mersey. It has been computed\r\nthat in the decade 1783–93, Liverpool slave-ships made 878 “round\r\nvoyages” (_i.e._ from Liverpool to the Guinea Coast, thence to the\r\nWest Indies, and back to the Mersey), carried 303,737 slaves and sold\r\nthem for £15,186,850.[750] It is not surprising, then, that Clarkson\r\nwas mobbed when he went there to collect evidence as to the terrible\r\nmortality of our seamen engaged in the trade,[751] and was known to be\r\npurchasing “mouth-openers,” those ingenious devices by which slavers\r\nforced open the mouths of those of their victims who sought release by\r\nvoluntary starvation. Bristol, though it had only eighteen ships in the\r\ntrade, was also up in arms; for it depended largely on the refining of\r\nsugar and the manufacture of rum. Even the veteran reformer, Alderman\r\nSawbridge, foresaw ruin for his constituency, the City of London, if\r\nthe trade were further interfered with. Persons of a rhetorical turn\r\ndepicted in lurid colours the decay of Britain’s mercantile marine,\r\nthe decline of her wealth, and the miseries of a sugar famine. Others\r\nsought to frighten the timid by declaring that, as shippers and\r\nplanters had embarked large sums of money in the trade in reliance\r\non Parliament, they were entitled to absolutely full compensation\r\nfor the heavy losses which must result from its abolition or further\r\ncurtailment.[752] In short, all the menaces, based on assumed legal\r\nrights, were set forth with vehemence and pertinacity.\r\n\r\nThe result was seen in the increasing acrimony of the opponents of\r\nabolition in Parliament. They poured scorn on the evidence adduced\r\nbefore the Privy Council in a way which brought from Pitt a sharp\r\nretort, but they insisted, and with success, on the hearing of evidence\r\nat the bar of the House. These dilatory tactics protracted the\r\ndiscussion until it was necessary to postpone it to the next year.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the session of 1789 an important change came about in\r\nthe Cabinet. Sydney had long disagreed with Pitt respecting the Slave\r\nTrade, and therefore, early in June, offered his resignation. There\r\ncould be but one opinion as to his successor. William Wyndham Grenville\r\nhad long shown high capacity both in diplomatic affairs and more\r\nrecently in his conduct of the Speakership of the House. His speech\r\non the trade marked him out as a strong supporter of Pitt; and on 5th\r\nJune he became Secretary of State for Home Affairs with a seat in the\r\nCabinet. His accession was a gain for the Administration and a further\r\nsource of strength for Pitt, who had long felt great confidence in his\r\njudgement and tact.[753] Henry Addington, son of the physician who long\r\nattended the first Earl of Chatham, was chosen Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons by a large majority over the Whig nominee, Sir Gilbert Elliot.\r\n\r\nOne other change ought to have taken place. The language used by\r\nLord Thurlow against Pitt had long been petulant, and his irritation\r\nagainst the abolitionists led him to strange lengths in the summer\r\nof 1789.[754] Their differences caused an almost complete rupture.\r\nBut, for the present, Pitt could not insist on his resignation. On\r\nthe question now at issue George III agreed with Thurlow.[755] He\r\nalso seems to have been quite unaware of the shifty course adopted\r\nby the Chancellor at the beginning of his late malady and believed\r\nhim to be thoroughly devoted to his person. It argues no small amount\r\nof self-restraint and honourable reticence in Pitt that he should\r\nhave taken no steps to inform the King of the meditated defection of\r\nThurlow. George III therefore continued to believe in the whole hearted\r\ndevotion of the Lord Chancellor; and on two occasions during the year\r\n1789 he wrote to Pitt expressing his desire that the two Ministers\r\nshould endeavour to work together cordially for the good of the\r\nrealm.[756] It is consonant with what we know of Thurlow’s character\r\nthat he presumed on the King’s partiality towards him, and played the\r\npart of the one necessary man in a way highly exasperating to Pitt.\r\nBut the precarious state of the King’s health and his known dislike\r\nof dismissing old servants availed to postpone the inevitable rupture\r\nuntil the year 1792. The retention of Thurlow may be considered one of\r\nthe causes of the failure of the abolitionists at this time.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1790 the champions of the Slave Trade\r\nbelieved that they saw signs of waning enthusiasm on the part of the\r\npublic, and on 23rd April sought to stop the further examination of\r\nwitnesses at the bar of the House. Wilberforce, Fox, and Pitt protested\r\nagainst these tactics, but Pitt intimated that he did not consider the\r\nquestion one which Ministers were pledged to support. The case for a\r\nfree and full inquiry was overwhelming, and it was continued. That Pitt\r\nacted in close connection with Fox on this whole question appears by\r\nhis letter to Wilberforce on 22nd April, which further shows that he\r\nalso considered the evidence so voluminous and important as to afford\r\nlittle hope of the question being disposed of in that session.[757]\r\n\r\nThis was most unfortunate. The friends of abolition never had a better\r\nopportunity than in the early part of 1790. Later on in that year the\r\nrisk of war with Spain (see Chapter XXIV) and the prospect of a revolt\r\nof the slaves in the French West Indies began to turn Britons against a\r\nmeasure which, they were told, would weaken the mercantile marine and\r\nlead to the loss of the West Indies. In this case, as in many others,\r\nthe influence of the French Revolution militated against the cause of\r\nsteady reform in England. The National Assembly had early declared the\r\nprinciple of freedom of the slaves in the French colonies; but owing\r\nto the violent opposition of the planters and merchants, the decree\r\nremained a dead letter. In the spring of 1790 the question came up once\r\nmore; but again the majority sought to shelve the question. Lord Robert\r\nStephen Fitzgerald, the British envoy at Paris, commended the prudence\r\nand self-restraint of the Assembly “in not agitating the two great\r\nquestions concerning the emancipation of the negroes and the abolition\r\nof the Slave Trade, which had at the first setting out raised so\r\nviolent a spirit of party.”[758] The planters and West India merchants\r\nstill threatened that the Colonial Assemblies (established in the year\r\n1787) would declare their independence if those decrees were passed, on\r\nthe ground that they were not bound by the acts of the French Assembly.\r\nMirabeau, along with all practical statesmen, forebore from pressing\r\nthe point; and it is highly probable that the politic caution of the\r\nFrench reformers, despite their sensibility and enthusiasm, told upon\r\npublic opinion in England.\r\n\r\nSuch were the discouraging conditions amidst which a General Election\r\nwas held in the summer of 1790. It increased Pitt’s hold on the House\r\nof Commons; but, as he had refrained from making the Slave Trade\r\na ministerial question, the result did not imply the victory of\r\nabolition. In the month of November he took a step which furthered\r\nthe prospects of the cause. He recommended Grenville for the peerage\r\nas Baron Grenville, partly in recognition of his services, but mainly\r\nbecause he needed a trusty friend and capable debater in the Upper\r\nHouse as a check on Thurlow. He assured Wilberforce that distrust of\r\nthe Lord Chancellor was the true reason that prompted the transfer of\r\nGrenville to the Lords.[759] We find Pitt writing on 24th November\r\n1790 to his mother in high spirits. He hoped for great things from\r\nGrenville in the Upper House. As for “prophets of schisms,” they would\r\nbe refuted. The opening of the new Parliament would find the Ministry\r\nin “more strength than has belonged to us since the beginning of the\r\nGovernment.”[760]\r\n\r\nThe question came before Parliament on 18th and 19th April 1791, when\r\nWilberforce in a masterly way summarized the official evidence and\r\nmoved for leave to bring in a Bill abolishing the Slave Trade. Some\r\nof the arguments on the other side were curious. Grosvenor admitted\r\nthat the trade was an “unamiable” one, but he declined to “gratify his\r\nhumanity at the expense of the interests of his country, and thought we\r\nshould not too curiously inquire into the unpleasant circumstances with\r\nwhich it was perhaps attended.” Less finnikin was the objection raised\r\nby Lord John Russell and others, that, if we suppressed the trade,\r\nFrance, Spain, and Holland would step in to take it up. This and the\r\nquestion of vested interests formed the only reply to Wilberforce,\r\nFox, and Pitt. The Prime Minister declared that he had never been more\r\ninterested in the fate of any proposal than the present one. He brushed\r\naside the pleas of opponents, as wholly untenable, “unless gentlemen\r\nwill in the first place prove to me that there are no laws of morality\r\nbinding upon nations, and that it is no duty of a Legislature to\r\nrestrain its subjects from invading the happiness of other countries\r\nand from violating the fundamental principles of justice.” He then\r\nproved from the statistics then available that the numbers of the\r\nslaves in the West Indies would under proper treatment increase in such\r\na degree as to supply the labour needed for the plantations, without\r\nbringing ruin upon Africa. But argument and reasoning were useless.\r\nMammon carried the day by 163 to 88.[761]\r\n\r\nThe events of the year 1791 further depressed the hopes of\r\nphilanthropists. After much wobbling on the subject the National\r\nAssembly of France passed a decree liberating the slaves in French\r\ncolonies, and granting to them the full rights of citizenship (15th\r\nMay). The results were disastrous. Already there had been serious\r\ntrouble in the French West Indies, owing to the progress of democratic\r\nideas among the mulattos and slaves; and the news that they were\r\nthenceforth politically the equals of planters and merchants, who had\r\never resisted their claims, led to terrible risings of the slaves,\r\nespecially in the west of St. Domingo, where plantations and cities\r\nfelt the blind fury of their revenge. By the end of the year the most\r\nflourishing colony of France was a wreck.[762]\r\n\r\nThe heedless haste of French reformers worked ruin far and wide.\r\nExtremes are fatal to the happy mean; for the populace rarely takes\r\nthe trouble to distinguish between reckless innovation and the healing\r\nof a palpable grievance. Among the unfortunate results of the French\r\nRevolution not the least was the tendency to extremes of feeling\r\nproduced by it in France and all neighbouring peoples. Those who\r\napproved its doctrines generally became giddy with enthusiasm; those\r\nwho disapproved turned livid with hatred. Burke in his “Reflections\r\non the French Revolution” had lately set the example of treating the\r\nwhole subject in a crusading spirit. The flood of sentimentality,\r\nunloosed by that attractive work, was now near high-water mark; and for\r\na space the age of chivalry seemed about to return.\r\n\r\nThe news of the horrors at St. Domingo came opportunely to double\r\nthe force of his prophecies. The cause of the slaves suffered untold\r\nharm.[763] Any change in existing customs was dubbed treason to the\r\nCommonwealth. Men did not stop to contrast the rash methods of the\r\n_Amis des Noirs_ with those advocated by Pitt. Still less did they ask\r\nhow the stoppage of the importation of infuriated negroes into the West\r\nIndian colonies, and the more humane treatment of those who were there,\r\ncould lead to a servile revolt. Wilberforce was fain to exclaim that\r\nnothing was so cruel as sensibility. His campaign against the Slave\r\nTrade made little or no progress in the early part of 1792. “People\r\nhere,” he wrote, “are all panic-struck with the transactions in St.\r\nDomingo and the apprehension, or pretended apprehension, of the like in\r\nJamaica.” Many friends advised him to postpone all further action for\r\na year until the panic was over. Among these was Pitt, so we may judge\r\nfrom the curt reference of Wilberforce to what went on at an informal\r\ncommittee meeting on the subject: “Pitt threw out against Slave motion,\r\non St. Domingo account.” He also speaks of a slackening of their\r\ncordiality.\r\n\r\nThe folly of Clarkson in advocating Jacobinical ideas at a meeting\r\nheld at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand further damaged the\r\ncause. Nevertheless, detestation of the Slave Trade was still very\r\nkeen. Friends of the slaves began to forswear sugar and take to\r\nhoney. Petitions against the traffic in human flesh poured in at St.\r\nStephen’s; and those who spoke of delay were held to be backsliders.\r\nThis is the sense which we must attach to a phrase in a letter sent\r\nto Wilberforce: “From London to Inverness Mr. Pitt’s sincerity is\r\nquestioned, and unless he can convince the nation of his cordiality in\r\nour cause, his popularity must suffer greatly.”[764] The questioning\r\nwas needless. Pitt considered the time inopportune for bringing the\r\nmotion before a Parliament which had already rejected it. When,\r\nhowever, Wilberforce persisted, he gave him his enthusiastic support.\r\n\r\nThe debate of 2nd April 1792 was remarkable in more ways than one.\r\nThe opponents of the measure now began to shift their ground. Colonel\r\nTarleton, member for Liverpool, continued to harp on the ruin that\r\nmust befall his town; but others, notably Dundas, and the Speaker\r\n(Addington) admitted the evils of the trade, and the probability that\r\nin a few years the needs of the planters might be met from the negro\r\npopulation already in the islands. Dundas therefore moved an amendment\r\nin favour of a “moderate” reform, or a “gradual” reform. Fox manfully\r\ncastigated this proposal, which assumed that there might be moderation\r\nin murder. Nevertheless Jenkinson (the future Earl of Liverpool) made a\r\ntrimming speech in favour of regulating, not abolishing, the trade.\r\n\r\nPitt then arose. The rays of dawn were already lighting up the windows\r\non the east when he began his memorable speech. First, he expressed his\r\nsatisfaction that members were generally agreed as to the abolition\r\nof the traffic being only a question of time. Mankind would therefore\r\nbefore long be delivered “from the severest and most extensive calamity\r\nrecorded in the history of the world.” Grappling with the arguments of\r\nJenkinson and Dundas, he proceeded to show that the immediate abolition\r\nof the Slave Trade would in many ways be an advantage to the West\r\nIndies, as it would restrict the often excessive outlay of the planters\r\nand deliver our colonies from the fear of servile insurrections like\r\nthat of St. Domingo. Planters must rely upon the natural increase of\r\nthe black population which would accelerate under good treatment. If,\r\nsaid he, that population decreases, it can be only from ill treatment.\r\nIf it is increasing, there is no need for a trade which involves a\r\nfrightful loss of life both on sea and in the process of “seasoning”\r\nthe human freitage in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nAdverting to the Act of 1750, which was claimed as authorizing the\r\ntrade, Pitt proved from its wording that the supply of negroes for our\r\ncolonies was then deemed to be essential, and that a clause of it,\r\nwhich was continually violated, expressly forbade the use of fraud or\r\nviolence in the procuring of the cargo. But, even if that law rendered\r\nthe trade legal, had any Legislature a right to sanction fraud and\r\nviolence? As well might a man think himself bound by a promise to\r\ncommit murder. He next scouted the argument that, if we gave up the\r\ntrade, other peoples would rush in and take our place. Would France,\r\nnow that she had abolished slavery? Would Denmark, seeing that she had\r\nresolved gradually to abolish the trade? As to other lands, it was more\r\nprobable that they would follow the example soon to be set by this land.\r\n\r\nHaving traversed the statements of opponents, Pitt raised the whole\r\nquestion to a higher level by reminding the House of the export of\r\nslaves from Britain to Rome, and by reconstructing with mordant\r\nirony the arguments of Roman senators on its behalf, as a legitimate\r\nand useful device for using the surplus population of a hopelessly\r\nbarbarous people. Warming to his theme, he thrilled his hearers by\r\ncontrasting the state of these islands, had they continued to supply\r\nthe Roman slave-mart, with the freedom, happiness, and civilization\r\nthat now were their lot. He besought members, as they valued these\r\nblessings, to see to it that they were extended to Africa; and,\r\ncatching inspiration from the rays of the sun which now lit up the\r\nHall, he pictured the natives of Africa in some not distant future\r\n“engaged in the calm occupations of industry, in the pursuits of a\r\njust and legitimate commerce. We may behold the beams of science and\r\nphilosophy breaking in upon their land, which, at some happy period\r\nin still later times may blaze with full lustre; and, joining their\r\ninfluence to that of pure religion, may illuminate and invigorate the\r\nmost distant extremities of that immense Continent. Then may we hope\r\nthat even Africa, though last of all the quarters of the globe, shall\r\nenjoy at length in the evening of her days, those blessings which have\r\ndescended so plentifully upon us in a much earlier period of the world.\r\nThen also will Europe, participating in her improvement and prosperity,\r\nreceive an ample recompense for the tardy kindness (if kindness it\r\ncan be called) of no longer hindering that Continent from extricating\r\nherself out of the darkness, which, in other more fortunate regions,\r\nhas been so much more speedily dispelled:\r\n\r\n  Nos ... primus equis Oriens afflavit anhelis,\r\n  Illic sera rubens accendit lumina Vesper.”[765]\r\n\r\nContinuing in this lofty strain, in which enthusiasm and learning,\r\nreason and art, voice and gestures, enforced the pleadings of a noble\r\nnature, he avowed his faith in the cause of immediate abolition of\r\nthe Slave Trade. The House thought otherwise. By 192 votes to 125 it\r\naccepted Dundas’s amendment in favour of gradual abolition.[766] So\r\nfar do the dictates of self-interest outweigh with many men those of\r\nrighteousness and mercy, even when these are reinforced by the most\r\nmoving appeals. Fox, Grey, and Windham agreed that Pitt’s speech was\r\none of the most extraordinary displays of eloquence ever heard. If such\r\nwas the opinion of opponents, we may imagine the impression produced\r\non friends. Wilberforce declared that the speaker was as if inspired\r\nwhen he spoke of the hope of civilizing Africa--a topic which he\r\n(Wilberforce) had suggested to him on the previous morning.[767]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe outcome was not wholly disappointing. Three weeks later Dundas\r\nbrought forward his resolutions for a gradual abolition of the trade.\r\nWilberforce and Pitt failed to induce the House to fix 1st January\r\n1795; but they carried it with them for 1st January 1796, though Dundas\r\nproposed a date four years later. The House of Lords, however, in\r\ndeference to the speeches of the Duke of Clarence, and Lords Hawkesbury\r\nand Thurlow, proceeded to involve the whole question in uncertainty by\r\ndeciding to hear the evidence on it at their own bar (8th May, 1792).\r\nSome votes were decided by Thurlow’s asseveration that this would\r\nnot involve delay. The Archbishop of Canterbury soon came to see his\r\nmistake; and after a sleepless night he wrote on 9th May to Pitt that\r\nhe was tortured by doubts as to the outcome of the affair. “My vote was\r\ngiven under a strong impression from the Chancellor’s solemn statement\r\nthat an examination before a committee of the whole House would not be\r\na cause of delay.... My conviction of the necessity of the abolition of\r\nthe horrid trade is firm and unshaken.” He adds that he will explain\r\nhis vote on the first possible occasion, and hopes that Pitt will show\r\nthis letter to Grenville and Wilberforce.[768]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop ought to have known that, with Thurlow, solemnity was\r\noften the cloak of maliciousness. It was so now. The examination of\r\nwitnesses proceeded very slowly. On 5th June, after hearing only five\r\nof them, the Lords decided to postpone the hearing of others until the\r\nfollowing year.[769] The dismissal of Thurlow, which (as we see in a\r\nlater chapter) followed on 15th June 1792, was due in the last instance\r\nto his pert censures of Pitt’s finance; but it may be ascribed also to\r\nhis acrimonious opposition to Pitt on the question of abolition, and to\r\nhis underhand means of defeating him in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nOther events also seemed to tell against the philanthropists. The\r\nconnection of some of them with the Radical clubs, and their use of\r\naddresses and petitions to overbear the opposition in Parliament\r\nclearly made a bad impression on Pitt. After issuing the royal\r\nproclamation against seditious writings in May 1792 he showed his\r\ndisapproval of their methods; and during the subsequent negotiations\r\nfor a union with the moderate Whigs, in order to form a truly national\r\nadministration, he confessed to Loughborough that he must make some\r\nconcession to the Whig Houses on the question of abolition.[770] This\r\nis the first clear sign of his intention to shelve the measure until\r\nthe return of more settled times.\r\n\r\nThey were not to come for wellnigh a decade. The declaration of war\r\nby the French Republic on 1st February 1793 turned men’s minds away\r\nfrom philanthropy to destruction. The results were soon visible. A\r\nmeasure proposed by Wilberforce, to prohibit the supply to foreigners\r\nof slaves in British ships, failed to pass the Commons, despite the\r\nable speeches of Pitt, Fox, and Francis in its favour (5th June 1793).\r\nIn the Lords meanwhile the Duke of Clarence (the future William IV)\r\nspoke against the original proposal with great bitterness, denouncing\r\nthe abolitionists as fanatics and hypocrites, and expressly naming\r\nWilberforce among them. This insolence was far from meeting with the\r\nchastisement that it deserved; but his words were taken as a sign that\r\nthe royal family was pledged to the support of the odious traffic.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to notice here a remarkable effort of the chief\r\nabolitionists, and to add a few words about the men themselves. Early\r\nin the year 1791 some of them sought to show that under favourable\r\nconditions negroes were capable of self-government. Accordingly they\r\nformed a Sierra Leone Committee for the purpose of settling liberated\r\nslaves on that part of the coast of West Africa. In the Pitt Papers is\r\na letter of 18th April 1791, from the first overseer, Falconbridge,\r\nto Granville Sharp, which the latter forwarded to Pitt, giving a\r\nheartrending account of the state of the thirty-six men and twenty\r\nwomen who formed the settlement. Fevers and ulcers were rife. Outrages\r\nby white men had made the tribes defiant, and a native chief hard by\r\nwas far from friendly. Falconbridge adds: “That lump of deformity, the\r\nSlave Trade, has so debauched the minds of the natives that they are\r\nlost to every principle of honor and honesty. The scenes of iniquity\r\nand murder I daily hear of, occasioned by this damnable traffic, make\r\nmy nature revolt.” He had named the bay and village Granville Bay and\r\nTown; but, as the latter was already overgrown with bushes, he was\r\nplanting another at Fora Bay. He concludes--“For God’s sake send me a\r\nship of force (warship).”[771] Such were the feeble beginnings of a\r\ncolony of which Zachary Macaulay was to be the first Governor.\r\n\r\nHere, as in other parts of this philanthropic movement, Pitt displayed\r\nlittle or no initiative. To the cause of abolition he gave the support\r\nof his eloquence and his influence in Parliament; but he gave no\r\ndecided lead in these and cognate efforts, a fact which somewhat\r\ndetracts from his greatness as a statesman in this formative period.\r\nThe merit of starting the movement and of utilizing new openings\r\nbelongs to the Quakers, to Granville Sharp, Clarkson, Wilberforce and\r\nhis friends. The member for Yorkshire had grouped around him at his\r\nabode, Broomfield, Clapham Common, or at his town house in Palace Yard,\r\nWestminster, a number of zealous workers, among whom Henry Thornton,\r\nJames Stephen (his brother-in-law), Thomas Babington, and Zachary\r\nMacaulay were prominent. His chief correspondents were Dr. Milner (Dean\r\nof Carlisle), Lord Muncaster, Sir Charles Middleton, Rev. John Newton,\r\nand Hannah More. With these and other members of the Abolitionist\r\nSociety he was in constant touch; and their zeal for social reform and\r\nfor the evangelical creed (which led to his Clapham circle being styled\r\nthe “Clapham Sect”) led to great results. In the religious sphere\r\nWilberforce and his friends were largely instrumental in founding the\r\nChurch Missionary Society (1798) and the Bible Society (1803). Their\r\nefforts on behalf of the poor and the mitigation of the barbarous penal\r\ncode (a matter ever associated with the name of Romilly) were also to\r\nbear good fruit.\r\n\r\nFor the present all their efforts against the Slave Trade seemed to\r\nbe in vain. It was pressed on feverishly in the year 1792. Between\r\n5th January and 4th May of that year there sailed from London 8 slave\r\nships, from Bristol 11, from Liverpool 39. The total tonnage was 11,195\r\ntons. Another official return among the Pitt Papers (No. 310) gives the\r\nfollowing numbers of slaves taken in British ships from West Africa to\r\nthe West Indies in the years 1789 to 1795 (the figures for 1790 are\r\nwanting):\r\n\r\n  -------+---------------+--------------------\r\n   YEAR. | SLAVES TAKEN. | DIED ON THE VOYAGE.\r\n  -------+---------------+--------------------\r\n   1789  |    11,014     |        1,053\r\n   1791  |    15,108     |        1,397\r\n   1792  |    26,971     |        2,468\r\n   1793  |    11,720     |          869\r\n   1794  |    14,611     |          394\r\n   1795  |     7,157     |          224\r\n  -------+---------------+--------------------\r\n   Total |    86,581     |        6,405\r\n  -------+---------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nThese figures suggest a reason for the falling off of interest in\r\nthe question after 1792. The trade seemed to be falling off; and the\r\nmortality at sea declined as the cargo was less closely packed. This,\r\nhowever, was but a poor argument for not abolishing a trade which was\r\ninherently cruel and might revive with the return of peace. In 1794 the\r\nCommons seemed friendly to abolition. Pitt, Fox, Whitbread, and other\r\nfriends of the cause pleaded successfully on behalf of Wilberforce’s\r\nBill of the previous year. Once more, however, the influence of the\r\nDuke of Clarence, Thurlow, and Lord Abingdon availed to defeat the\r\nproposal. Grenville also voted against it as being premature. The Lords\r\nproceeded to illustrate the sincerity of their desire for further\r\ninformation on the topic by shelving the whole inquiry.\r\n\r\nA sense of despair now began to creep over many friends of the\r\nmovement. If abolitionist motions could only just pass the Commons, to\r\nbe at once rejected by the Lords, what hope was there for the slaves?\r\nTheir cause was further overclouded by the sharp disagreement of\r\nWilberforce and Pitt respecting the war with France. As we shall see in\r\na later chapter, Pitt and the majority of his supporters, together with\r\nthe Old Whigs, believed that the war must go on until a solid peace\r\ncould be obtained. Wilberforce and many of the abolitionists thought\r\notherwise. During the latter part of the year 1794 and the first weeks\r\nof 1795 the two friends were scarcely on speaking terms; but even\r\nduring that sad time Pitt wrote to Wilberforce (26th December 1794):\r\n“Nothing has happened to add either to my hopes or fears respecting\r\nthe Slave Question with a view to the issue of it in the next session,\r\nbut I think the turn things take in France may be favourable to the\r\nultimate abolition.” Pitt spoke powerfully against Dundas’s amendment\r\nin favour of gradual abolition at some time after the conclusion of\r\nthe war; but these procrastinating tactics carried the day by 78 to 61\r\n(26th February 1795).\r\n\r\nIn the following year matters at first seemed more hopeful. Twice\r\ndid Pitt and Wilberforce beat the supporters of the trade by fair\r\nmajorities; but on the third reading of the Abolition Bill it was\r\nlost by four votes. Wilberforce noted indignantly that enough of its\r\nsupporters were at the Opera to have turned the scale. The same apathy\r\ncharacterized the session of 1797, when the mutinies in the fleet and\r\nthe sharp financial crisis told heavily against a measure certain to\r\nentail some losses in shipping and colonial circles. At this time Pitt\r\nseems to have lost heart in the matter. This appeared in his attitude\r\ntowards a plausible but insidious proposal, that the Governors of\r\nColonies should be directed to recommend the local Assemblies to adopt\r\nmeasures which would improve the lot of the negroes and thus prepare\r\nthe way for the abolition of the Slave Trade. Than this nothing could\r\nbe more futile; for the Governors and Assemblies were known to desire\r\nthe continuance of the trade. Yet Pitt urged Wilberforce to accept the\r\nmotion if it were modified; but, on Wilberforce refusing, he “stood\r\nstiffly by him.” They were beaten by a majority of thirty-six--a proof\r\nthat the House wished to postpone abolition to the distant future.[772]\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for peace with France, which went on at Lille during\r\nthe summer of that year, offered an opportunity for including a mutual\r\nguarantee of the two Powers that they would abolish the Slave Trade.\r\nPitt seems to have disapproved of introducing this question into the\r\ndiscussions, either from a fear of complicating them, or from a belief\r\nthat it would be treated better after the conclusion of peace.[773] His\r\nreluctance was misconstrued by Wilberforce, who sent him the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n                                          Hull, August 1, 1797.[774]\r\n\r\n    ... I am afraid the negotiation is not in such a state as to render\r\n    the idea I started of negotiating unconditionally for the abolition\r\n    of the Slave Trade a practical question very necessary to be just\r\n    now discussed. But if the negotiation should wear a more promising\r\n    aspect, let me beg you seriously to weigh the matter. Dundas is\r\n    friendly to the notion, as indeed I must do him, and myself too,\r\n    the justice to say that I believe he would. Grenville ought to be\r\n    so, and all the rest except Lord Liverpool are either neutral or\r\n    friendly. I must honestly say, I never was so much hurt since I\r\n    knew you as at your not receiving and encouraging this proposal,\r\n    which even Lord Liverpool himself ought to have approved on the\r\n    ground on which he used to oppose.[775] Do, my dear Pitt, I entreat\r\n    you reconsider the matter. I am persuaded of your zeal in this\r\n    cause, when, amidst the multitude of matters which force themselves\r\n    on you more pressingly, it can obtain a hearing; but I regret that\r\n    you have so been drawn off from it. Indeed regret is a very poor\r\n    term to express what I feel on this subject. Excuse this, from the\r\n    fulness of my heart, which I have often kept down with difficulty\r\n    and grief.\r\n\r\n    My dear Pitt let me intreat you, as I see another bishop is dead,\r\n    to consider well whom you appoint. I am persuaded that if the\r\n    clergy could be brought to know and to do their duty, both the\r\n    religious and civil state of this country would receive a principle\r\n    of life.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of the Lille negotiation by the French falsified these\r\nhopes and served to justify Pitt for not weighting it with a\r\ncontentious proposal. But for the present at least, he had lost hope\r\nin the cause. It is true that he always spoke strongly on its behalf\r\nduring the ensuing efforts put forth by Wilberforce.[776] But the\r\nbuoyancy of his belief was gone, and some even of his friends accused\r\nhim of apathy.[777] This is probably unjust. A man may believe firmly\r\nin a measure, and yet be convinced that it cannot pass under present\r\nconditions. In that case he will do his best, but his efforts will be\r\nthose of an overburdened horse unable to master the load.\r\n\r\nMore than once he annoyed Wilberforce by preventing a useless\r\ndiscussion of the question.[778] Insinuations of insincerity were\r\ntherefore hurled at Pitt. Indeed they seem to have gained wide\r\ncredence. We find his young admirer, Canning, writing at Brooksby,\r\nnear Leicester, on 15th December 1799, that very many friends doubted\r\nwhether he now desired to carry abolition, while some even commended\r\nhis prudence in doing less than he professed in the matter. Canning\r\nfound it far from easy to eradicate this notion from the minds of his\r\nhosts, the Ellises, by informing them of the object of a secret mission\r\nto the West Indies then undertaken by Smith.[779]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be well to postpone to a later chapter the question of Pitt’s\r\nattitude towards abolition in his second Ministry, that of 1804–6. But\r\nwe may notice here certain criticisms which apply mainly, of course,\r\nto the years 1788–1800. He has been censured for not making abolition\r\na Cabinet question.[780] But how could he do so when the majority\r\nof Ministers opposed it? For a short time only the Duke of Richmond\r\nand he favoured abolition. The substitution of Grenville for Sydney\r\nstrengthened his hands; but even then he was in a minority in the\r\nCabinet on this question. Further, the House of Lords consistently,\r\nand by increasing majorities, scouted the measure; and the House of\r\nCommons, even under the spell of Pitt’s eloquence, refused to decree\r\nimmediate abolition, and that, too, before the shadow of the great\r\nwar shrouded the whole subject in disastrous eclipse. After the last\r\nyear of peace of Pitt’s ministerial career, other considerations came\r\nuppermost. The need of keeping up the mercantile marine, both as a\r\nsource of wealth and as a nursery for the royal navy, cooled the zeal\r\nof many friends of the movement. Windham opposed it in a manner that\r\nearned him the title of Machiavelli. Others also fell away; and even\r\nthe eloquence of young Canning on its behalf did not make up for\r\ndefections. The better class of West India planters and merchants\r\ntacitly agreed to the limitation of the Slave Trade; and with this\r\nprospect in view many friends of the cause relaxed their efforts.\r\n\r\nFurther, when the King, a decided majority both in the Cabinet and\r\nin the House of Lords, and a wavering majority in the Commons, were\r\nunchangeably opposed to immediate abolition, what could a Minister\r\ndo? The ordinary course of conduct, resignation, would have availed\r\nnothing. As nearly all the Ministerial bench disliked the proposal, no\r\ncoherent Cabinet could have been formed. True, a Ministry composed of\r\nPitt, Grenville, Fox, Burke, Sheridan, and Wilberforce might perhaps\r\nhave forced the measure through the Commons (to see it fail in the\r\nLords); but so monstrous a coalition could scarcely have seen the\r\nlight; certainly it could not have lived amid the storms of the war.\r\nBesides, the first duty of a Minister after 1792 was to secure for\r\nhis country the boon of a solid peace. As we shall see, that was ever\r\nPitt’s aim; and grief at seeing it constantly elude his grasp finally\r\ncost him his life. Further, the assumption that he could have coerced\r\nthe members of his Cabinet because they differed from him on this\r\nquestion is untenable. He was able to secure the retirement of Sydney\r\nbecause he was not highly efficient, and of Thurlow on the ground\r\nof contumacy. But to compel useful and almost necessary Ministers\r\nlike Dundas or Camden to retire, when the majority in both Houses\r\nagreed with them, would have set at defiance all the traditions of\r\nparliamentary life.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms noticed above are based on the assumption that Pitt\r\nwas all-powerful and could bend the Cabinet and Parliament to his\r\nwill. This is an exaggeration. Where, as in the case of pocket\r\nboroughs and the Slave Trade, members felt their interests at stake,\r\nthey somnolently resisted the charms of his oratory and trooped\r\ninto the opposite lobby. The British people is slow to realize its\r\nresponsibilities, but in the end it responds to them; and in these\r\nyears of defeat at Westminster the efforts of Clarkson, Granville\r\nSharp, and others spread abroad convictions which were to assure an\r\nultimate triumph.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Pitt to carry the abolition of the Slave Trade or\r\nmaterially to improve the condition of the negroes was to have a\r\nsinister influence on our position in the West Indies. While the slave\r\nowners and shippers and their friends at Westminster refused to budge\r\nan inch, the French Jacobins eagerly rushed forward and proclaimed the\r\nequality of all mankind. Therefore early in the course of the Great War\r\nthe slaves rallied to the tricolour; and Toussaint l’Ouverture, the\r\nablest of negro leaders, enthusiastically marshalled their levies in\r\nHayti for the overthrow of British rule. In a later chapter we shall\r\ntrace the disastrous sequel. Colonel (afterwards Sir John) Moore noted\r\nin his Diary that the negroes were for the most part fanatical for\r\nliberty; and, after committing deeds of desperation in its name, died\r\ndefiantly with the cry _Vive la République_ on their lips.[781] Here\r\nwe touch on one of the chief causes for the frightful waste of British\r\ntroops in the West Indies. With discontent rife in our own colonies,\r\nthe struggle against the blacks, especially in Hayti, placed on our\r\nmen a strain unendurable in that pestilential climate. The Hon. J. W.\r\nFortescue, the historian of the British Army, estimates its total\r\nlosses in the West Indies during the war of 1793–1802 as not far short\r\nof 100,000 men. Whatever the total may be, it is certain that at least\r\nhalf of that woeful sacrifice resulted from the crass stupidity and\r\nbrutal selfishness displayed by mercantile and colonial circles on this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the last four chapters we have taken a survey of questions of\r\ngreat interest in British and colonial history, and have therefore\r\ninterrupted the story of Pitt’s dealings with continental affairs.\r\nIt is time now to recur to events of world-wide import, namely, the\r\nambitious schemes of the Sovereigns of the East and the great popular\r\nupheaval in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE SCHEMES OF CATHARINE II\r\n\r\n    I came to Russia poor; but I will not die in debt to the\r\n    Empire; for I shall leave her the Crimea and Poland as my\r\n    portion.--CATHARINE II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1787 the ablest potentate in Europe set\r\nout on a State progress to the newly annexed provinces in the South\r\nof her Empire. It was carried out with an energy and splendour which\r\nillustrated the union of the forethought of the West with the barbaric\r\nsplendour of the East. A great flotilla of galleys bore the Sovereign,\r\nher chief courtiers, the ambassadors of Great Britain, Austria, and\r\nFrance, and numerous attendants down the course of the Dnieper to\r\nthe city of Kherson near its mouth. By day the banks were fringed\r\nwith throngs of the peasants of Little Russia, brought up to order,\r\nwhile ever and anon the shouts of Cossacks, Calmucks, and Circassians\r\nimpressed the beholders with a sense of the boundless resources of\r\nthat realm. By night the welkin flared with illuminations; and the\r\nextent of the resting-places, which had arisen like exhalations at the\r\nbidding of her favourite, Prince Potemkin, promised the speedy inroad\r\nof civilization into the lands over which the Turk still held sway. In\r\ntruth, far more impressive to the mind’s eye was the imperious will\r\nof which these marvels were the manifestation, the will of Catharine\r\nII.[782]\r\n\r\nAt her invitation there joined her near Potemkin’s creation, the\r\ncity of Ekaterinoslav, another monarch of romantic and adventurous\r\ncharacter. Joseph II of Austria, head of the Holy Roman Empire, now\r\nreluctantly turned towards the eastern conquests to which she had\r\nlong beckoned him. Together they proceeded on the progress southwards\r\nto Kherson, which they entered under a triumphal arch bearing the\r\ninscription in Greek, “The way to Byzantium.” A still more impressive\r\nproof of the activity of her masterful favourite awaited them. Potemkin\r\nhad pushed on the work of the new dockyard at Kherson; and as a result\r\nthey witnessed the launch of three warships. The largest, of 80 guns,\r\nwas christened by Catharine herself, “Joseph II.”[783]\r\n\r\nThence the imperial procession wended its way to the much-prized\r\nacquisition, the Crimea. In that Tartar Khanate the fertile brain\r\nand forceful personality of Potemkin had wrought wonders. It was but\r\nfour years since the Empress, in her joy at the annexation of that\r\nvantage-ground, had pointed on the map to the little township of\r\nAkhtiar, re-named it Sevastopol, and ordered the construction of a\r\ndockyard and navy. Now, in June 1787, as the allied sovereigns topped\r\nthe hills which command that port, the Hapsburg ruler uttered a cry of\r\nsurprise and admiration. For there below lay a squadron of warships,\r\nready, as it seemed, to set sail and plant the cross on the dome of St.\r\nSophia at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nHitherto Joseph II had not shown the amount of zeal befitting an ally\r\nand an admirer. True, he had not openly belied the terms of the compact\r\nof the year 1781, which had been his sheet-anchor amid the storms of\r\nhis reign. But that alliance had been the prelude to vast schemes\r\nproductive at once of longing and distrust. They aimed at nothing less\r\nthan the partition of the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The glorious days\r\nof Prince Eugène were to be recalled, and, on the expulsion of the\r\nTartar horde over the Bosphorus, Austria was to acquire the Turkish\r\nlands which that warrior had gained for her by the Peace of Passarowitz\r\n(1718), namely, the Banat of Temesvar, the northern half of Servia, and\r\nthe districts of Wallachia as far as the River Aluta. The only direct\r\ngain to Catharine was to be the Tartar territory north of the Black Sea\r\nas far as the Dniester. As for Moldavia and Wallachia, they were to\r\nform an independent kingdom under a Christian Prince (a plan finally\r\nrealized in 1858); and the remainder of the Balkan Peninsula was to be\r\nruled by the favourite grandson of the Empress, Prince Constantine.\r\n\r\nOutwardly this partition seemed to offer a fair share to Austria. But\r\nit was soon clear that the grasping genius of Muscovy would transform\r\nthe nominally independent kingdoms of Constantinople and Roumania into\r\nfeudatories and bar to Austria the way to the Lower Danube, the Aegean,\r\nand the Lower Adriatic. Not yet were the lessons of the first partition\r\nof Poland forgotten at Vienna.[784] Then, too, the Austro-Russian\r\ncompact had but slightly advanced the interests of Joseph II in\r\nGermany. Catharine had done little to further his pet scheme of the\r\nBelgic-Bavarian Exchange; and, apart from feminine fumings, she had not\r\nseriously counteracted the formation of the League of German Princes\r\nwhereby Frederick the Great had thwarted that almost revolutionary\r\nproposal (1785). Probably this accounts for the reluctance of Joseph\r\nto give rein to the southward impulses of the Czarina in that year.\r\nAt its close Sir Robert Murray Keith, British Ambassador at Vienna,\r\nreported that the Czarina’s tour to Kherson was postponed, and four\r\ndays later he recorded a remarkable conversation in the course of\r\nwhich the Emperor revealed his dislike of the dangerous schemes then\r\nmooted for the partition of the Turkish Empire. “I can tell you for\r\ncertain,” he said, “_que si jamais tous les coquins se rompent avec\r\nl’Empire Ottoman_, France is firmly determined to strike a bold stroke\r\nby making herself mistress of Egypt. This I know with certainty from\r\nmore quarters than one; and M. Tott himself told me at Paris that he\r\nhad travelled through all Egypt by order of his Court to explore that\r\ncountry in a military light and to lay down a plan for the conquest of\r\nit.”[785]\r\n\r\nIn these words we have probably the reason for the deferring of the\r\nRussian schemes against Turkey. They are also noteworthy, as they must\r\nhave tended to deepen the distrust which Pitt and Carmarthen felt\r\nfor France. Her chief Minister, Vergennes, figured as the protector\r\nof Turkey against Russia, recalling thereby the policy of Louis XV’s\r\nreign, which in 1739 availed to tear away from Austria the conquests\r\nof Prince Eugène and restore them to the Sublime Porte. But under this\r\nshow of championship there seems to have lain an alternative policy,\r\nthat of furthering the partition of Turkey, provided that France\r\nacquired Egypt, and some other vantage posts in the Levant. As we have\r\nalready seen, France was busy in Egypt and the Orient with schemes\r\nwhich probably would have startled the world had she rivetted her hold\r\non the Dutch Netherlands in the year 1787.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the facile and dissolute Frederick William to the\r\nPrussian throne in 1786, and the preoccupation of England and France in\r\nthe Dutch crisis which followed, now left Joseph free to comply with\r\nthe request of the Czarina that he would join her in the journey to the\r\nCrimea. After long hesitations he reluctantly gave his assent. His aged\r\nChancellor, Prince Kaunitz, the champion of the connection with Russia\r\nand France, advised him to direct the imperial conferences towards the\r\nBavarian Exchange and the dissolution of the Fürstenbund. Catharine\r\nwilled otherwise. Under her influence the views of Joseph underwent a\r\nnotable orientation. He came back to Vienna virtually pledged to a war\r\nfor the partition of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe change in Joseph’s policy was a tribute to the potency of the\r\nCzarina’s will. In her personality, as we have already seen, there were\r\nsingular powers of fascination and command. Her vivacity and charm,\r\nvaried by moods of petulance or fury, made up a character feminine in\r\nits impulsiveness and of masculine strength. The erstwhile Princess of\r\nAnhalt-Zerbst, who by a series of audacious intrigues, and probably by\r\nthe murder of her consort Peter III, had become the greatest autocrat\r\nof the century, still retained the intellectual freshness of youth.\r\nHer character and career present a series of bizarre contrasts. The\r\npoverty of her upbringing, the dissolute adventures of her early life,\r\nand the outrageous crimes of her womanhood would have utterly tainted\r\na personality less remarkable and attractive. But in the loose society\r\nof St. Petersburg it had long been customary to gloze over lapses of\r\nvirtue by easy descriptions, like that which the stately rhetoric of\r\nBurke applied to the chivalry of Versailles, that “vice itself lost\r\nhalf its evil by losing all its grossness.”\r\n\r\nCertainly the intellectual keenness and social witcheries of the\r\nsorceress threw a charm over her rout. French and German philosophers\r\npraised her learning and wit, but innate shrewdness kept her from more\r\nthan a passing dalliance with the unsettling theories which were to\r\nwork havoc in France. Here as in her amours she observed some measure\r\nof worldly prudence; so that no favourite could count on a long reign\r\nof pillage. Thus, whether by whim or by design, she kept devotion and\r\nhope ever on the stretch; and one might almost apply to her, even at\r\nthe age of fifty-nine, Shakespeare’s description of Cleopatra:\r\n\r\n  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale\r\n  Her infinite variety; other women cloy\r\n  The appetites they feed; but she makes hungry\r\n  Where most she satisfies.\r\n\r\nLike the “serpent of old Nile,” Catharine had many weaknesses; and they\r\nmight have worked her ruin in the more strenuous age which followed;\r\nbut fortune brought her to the front at a time when Frederick the Great\r\ndesired the friendship of Russia, and when Hapsburg policy vacillated\r\nbetween the conservatism of Maria Theresa and the viewiness of her son\r\nJoseph. Thus the Czarina could work her will on the decaying Powers,\r\nTurkey and Poland, and raised the prestige of her Empire to unimagined\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nA few shrewd observers were not dazzled by this splendour. Sir James\r\nHarris, who went as British envoy to Russia in 1778 to cultivate the\r\nfriendship, and if possible the alliance, of Catharine, rightly probed\r\nthe inner weakness of her position. It lay in the suddenness of her\r\nrise, the barbarousness of her people, the unblushing peculations\r\nof Ministers and officials, and the shiftiness of Muscovite policy.\r\nThis last defect he traced to the peculiarities of the Empress\r\nherself, which he thus summed up: “She has a masculine force of mind,\r\nobstinacy in adhering to a plan, and intrepidity in the execution of\r\nit; but she wants the more manly virtues of deliberation, forbearance\r\nin prosperity, and accuracy of judgment, while she possesses in a\r\nhigh degree the weaknesses vulgarly attributed to her sex--love of\r\nflattery and its inseparable companion, vanity; [and] an inattention\r\nto unpleasant but salutary advice.” Six years later he sharpened his\r\ncriticism and described her as led by her passions, not by reason\r\nand argument; her prejudices, though easily formed, were immovable;\r\nher good opinion was liable to constant fluctuations and whims; and\r\nher resolves might carry her to any lengths.[786] Such, too, was the\r\nopinion of the Comte de Ségur, the French ambassador, who wrote about\r\nthe Turkish schemes renewed in 1787: “We are so accustomed to see\r\nRussia throw herself offhand into the most risky affairs, and Fortune\r\nhas so persistently helped her, that there is no accounting for the\r\nactions of this Power on the rules of a scientific policy.”[787]\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity was far from repelling Joseph II. While pluming\r\nhimself on the application of reason to politics, that crowned\r\nphilosopher forgot to take counsel of her twin-sister, prudence. On\r\nhis polyglot Empire, which already felt the first stirrings of the\r\nprinciple of nationality, he imposed centralizing laws, agrarian,\r\nsocial, and religious, which speedily aroused the hostility of those\r\nwhom he meant to uplift. Along with all this he pushed on schemes which\r\nunsettled Germany, Belgium, and Poland; and now, as if all this were\r\nnot enough, he was drawn into the vortex of the Turkish enterprises of\r\nCatharine.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to assume that Joseph had no practical aims in view. He\r\nhoped to acquire from Turkey territories which would open up trade on\r\nthe Adriatic and the Lower Danube, and he counted on strengthening the\r\nRussian alliance to which he trusted for the furtherance of his aims\r\nin Germany and Belgium. Yet rarely has a monarch formed a resolution\r\nmore fraught with peril. In truth it resulted from the mastery gained\r\nby an abler and more determined nature over one that was generous\r\nbut ill-compacted, daring but unsteady. Had the Emperor surveyed the\r\nsituation with care, he must have seen that it favoured Catharine\r\nrather than himself. She was beset by no troubles at home; while his\r\nlands, especially the _Pays Bas_, heaved with disloyal excitement. She\r\nhad appeased the Turcophile feelings of France by granting a favourable\r\ncommercial treaty; and Montmorin, the successor of Vergennes, was\r\nweaker in himself and less able to support the Sultan. In short,\r\nCatharine had her hands free, while Joseph had them full.[788]\r\n\r\nThe alliance between Russia and Poland at this time acquired new\r\nvitality. During her triumphal tour Catharine received the homage of\r\nher former lover, Stanislaus, King of Poland, and received from him\r\nthe promise of the help of 100,000 Polish troops for the Turkish war,\r\nand “likewise for any other contest”--a phrase aimed against Prussia,\r\nif she dared to intervene. The value of the promise soon became open\r\nto doubt. The monarch in Poland had long been a figure-head, while\r\nthe real power lay with the powerful and ambitious nobility, which,\r\nunder the lead of the Czartoryski and Potocki families, ever chafed at\r\nMuscovite ascendancy, and now declined to help Catharine in humbling\r\ntheir natural ally, the Sultan. In 1790 their views were to prevail;\r\nbut, for the present, the resources of Poland seemed at her beck and\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of Catharine therefore were brilliant in the extreme. But\r\nfor once Fortune played her false. After the departure of the Emperor\r\nfrom the Crimea, and while she still fondly surveyed the warlike\r\npreparations at its new dockyard, there came news of the alarming\r\nprospects for the harvest in Russia. “The Empress,” wrote Fitzherbert\r\non 24th July, “almost immediately after leaving the Crimea fell under\r\na great and visible depression of spirits, accompanied at times with\r\nviolent gusts of ill humour; and in this state remained with very\r\nlittle intermission till our arrival here [Czarko-zelo].” He ascribed\r\nthese moody humours to the failure of the corn crop, which necessitated\r\nthe immediate purchase of 5,000,000 roubles’ worth of foreign grain,\r\nand the distribution of Potemkin’s army in widespread cantonments.\r\n\r\nTo wage a great campaign while bread stood at famine prices was\r\nimpossible. In this predicament the Empress decided to hide her\r\nretirement by a parade of diplomatic bluster. She despatched to\r\nConstantinople a special envoy, Bulgakoff, to lay claim to the\r\nPrincipality of Georgia, and to submit this and other matters in\r\ndispute to the mediation of France and Austria. The move was dexterous;\r\nbut in such a case the success of a game of bluff depends on the\r\nadversary not perceiving the weakness of which it is the screen. Now,\r\nthe Sublime Porte, though usually inert, divined the secret, and\r\nresolved to withstand these endless affronts. During thirteen years\r\northodox Moslems had writhed under the humiliations of the Treaty of\r\nKainardji (1774), which acknowledged the complete independence of the\r\nTartar Khans of the Crimea and the Kuban valley, and in vague terms\r\nadmitted the Czarina to be the protectress of the Christian subjects of\r\nthe Porte. In 1783, thanks to Austrian support, Catharine seized the\r\nCrimea; and now she laid claim to Georgia. The cup of humiliation was\r\nfull; and the pride of Moslems scorned to drink it.\r\n\r\nThe despatches of Sir Robert Ainslie, British ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, show clearly enough the motives that prompted that\r\nGovernment to strike an unexpected blow. On 25th June 1787 he reported\r\nto Carmarthen that the Porte looked on the journey of the Czarina and\r\nher warlike preparations as designed to wear out the patience and the\r\nresources of the Turks, who already were said to have 240,000 men ready\r\nnear the Danube, and others in Asia. If, he added, she did not explain\r\nher present conduct, “I am afraid they will commence hostilities,” and\r\n“strike a home blow in the Crimea.” On 10th July he stated that there\r\ncould be no solid peace so long as Russia held the Crimea in defiance\r\nof the Treaty of Kainardji. “The honour of the Sultan, the security of\r\nthis Empire, the interest of the Mahometan religion, and those [_sic_]\r\nof justice all require that ... the independence of the Crimea should\r\nbe re-established. It is true, the Porte agreed to the cession; but\r\nthat act, torn from her weakness, was involuntary and unjust. In short,\r\nit can only be binding until a good opportunity offers to cancel its\r\neffect. This, my Lord, seems the opinion of the Cabinet and the motive\r\nof their extensive preparations, but they are diffident of success and\r\nafraid to attack unless Russia herself furnishes pretext.” He adds that\r\nthe Turkish Ministers believed Bulgakoff’s mission to be designed to\r\n“spin out the summer”; but that the Turkish levies could scarcely be\r\nkept together.[789]\r\n\r\nAs for the temporizing offers of mediation from France and Austria,\r\nthe Porte would have none of them, and refused to accept any in which\r\nGreat Britain had no share. The Grand Vizier cherished the hope that\r\nAustria and Russia were not really united by treaty, and seemed to\r\ndesire, rather than to avoid, a rupture. On 30th July the Reis Effendi\r\nasked our ambassador what England would do in case of a Russo-Turkish\r\nWar. Ainslie replied that she would “keep strict neutrality,” and\r\nstrongly urged the need of peace. “Never will we purchase peace on the\r\ndishonourable terms held out by Russia,” replied the Turkish Minister,\r\nand he added with oriental subtlety that, unless she gave way, war\r\nmust come “before many months are elapsed.” Ainslie thought that this\r\nportended war in the spring of 1788.[790]\r\n\r\nBut on 16th August the Sultan struck swiftly and hard. Doubtless\r\nhe had heard news of the famine in Russia and the dispersion of\r\nPotemkin’s forces. It was clear that for a time the would-be aggressor\r\nwas reduced to the defensive. Was it not well, then, to deliver the\r\nblow rather than wait for it to fall in the next year, and perhaps\r\nfrom both Austria and Russia? True, the Turks were not ready--they\r\nnever were so. But their recent successes over the Mameluke Beys in\r\nEgypt and the rebellious Mahmoud Pacha in Albania emboldened them to\r\ntake a step which completely surprised all the Cabinets of Europe. On\r\n16th August, after a long conference with the Grand Vizier, Bulgakoff\r\nand five members of his suite were apprehended and marched off to\r\nthe Seven Towers, there to be kept in close custody. This was the\r\nTurkish way of declaring war to the knife. The Porte defended it on\r\nthe ground of outrages to its flag at Kinburn and Sevastopol;[791] but\r\nthe incident added rancour to the hatred of Catharine, and she swore\r\nto glut her revenge upon the insolent infidels. Her rage was all the\r\ngreater because for once she was outwitted. Fitzherbert, on hearing of\r\nthe novel declaration of war by the Turks, stated to Carmarthen[792]\r\nthat it must have upset all her calculations, for he knew that the\r\nblustering language used by Bulgakoff “was in fact intended to produce\r\nthe contrary effect.”[793]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese events were destined potently to influence the career of Pitt.\r\nIn one respect they affect his reputation; for Catharine in her fury\r\naccused him of inciting the Turks to attack her.[794] The charge\r\nwas not unnatural. She had long shown her spleen against England\r\nin bitter words and hostile deeds. More than once she thrust aside\r\nPitt’s overtures for an alliance; and she rejected his proposals for\r\na commercial treaty while she granted that boon to France (January\r\n1787). Further, the outbreak of war in the East came very opportunely\r\nfor Great Britain and Prussia at the crisis of the Dutch embroglio and\r\nenabled the Court of Berlin confidently to launch its troops against\r\nthe Patriots in Holland. The tilt given from Constantinople to the\r\ndelicately poised kaleidoscope of diplomacy had startling results. The\r\nmobile Powers--Russia, Austria, and France--were fixed fast, while the\r\nhitherto stationary States, Prussia and England, were set free for\r\nswift action.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is untrue that the tilt came from Pitt and Carmarthen.\r\nThey still clung to the traditional British policy of befriending\r\nRussia, which Fox had enthusiastically supported. Our Government\r\ninstructed Fraser at St. Petersburg to express regret at the outbreak\r\nof war and to offer, conjointly with Prussia, our good services for the\r\nrestoration of peace. Pitt also informed Vorontzoff, Russian ambassador\r\nin London, of his desire for a good understanding with Russia, and\r\nstated that he would not oppose acquisitions of Turkish territory. All\r\nthe evidence tends to prove that he strove to prevent hostilities,\r\nwhich must upset the existing order in the East and probably end in\r\na general war. As the concern of Prussia was equally great (it being\r\ncertain by the end of 1787 that Austria would join in the war) the two\r\nProtestant Powers drew together for joint action though not, as yet,\r\nfor actual alliance.[795]\r\n\r\nIn fact, we find here the reason of the coyness of Pitt in framing that\r\ncompact. He still preferred to have Russia, rather than Prussia, as an\r\nally. But his advances to Catharine ended with the impossible retort\r\nthat he must recall Ainslie from Constantinople. Nevertheless it was\r\nnot till the middle of March 1788 that Pitt took a step displeasing\r\nto her by forbidding her agents to hire Russian transports in\r\nEngland.[796] The Empress showed her annoyance at these strict notions\r\nof neutrality by publicly receiving the famous American privateer, Paul\r\nJones.[797]\r\n\r\nPitt’s attitude towards Austria was at first equally friendly. On\r\n14th September 1787 Carmarthen sent to Vienna assurances that the\r\nRusso-Turkish War would make no difference to the friendship of George\r\nIII for Austria, and that we should maintain “the determined system\r\nof this country to contribute as far as possible to the continuance\r\nof the public tranquillity, or to its speedy restoration if unhappily\r\nit should be interrupted.” By these and other proposals Pitt and\r\nCarmarthen vainly sought to detach Austria from Russia, and also to\r\nconjure away the spectre of a Triple Alliance between France, Russia,\r\nand Austria, which long haunted the courts of Whitehall. Early in\r\n1788, that ghost was laid by the Austrian attack upon the Turks, which\r\nFrance had striven to avert, and Pitt felt free to accept the proffered\r\nalliance of Prussia which, as we saw in Chapter XVI, finally came about\r\nin August 1788.[798]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of that year is devoid of interest. Scarcity of bread on\r\nthe Russian side and the usual unpreparedness of the Turks clogged\r\nthe operations, which led to a sharp conflict only at one point. The\r\nfortress of Kinburn, recently acquired by the Russians, commanded the\r\nestuary formed by the converging Rivers Dnieper and Bug. It stood\r\nopposite the Turkish fortress, Oczakoff, which was deemed the chief\r\nbulwark of the Ottomans in the East. Early in October 1788 they made\r\nan attempt to seize Kinburn as a prelude to the hoped-for conquest of\r\nthe Crimea. But in that fortress was a wizened little veteran, who ate\r\nbread with the soldiers, startled them at dawn by his cock crows, and\r\nsummarized his ideas on tactics by the inspiriting words: “At them with\r\nthe cold steel.” The personality of Suvóroff was worth an army corps,\r\nfor it was bound up with triumph. He now waited within the walls of\r\nKinburn until the Turkish fleet landed 5,000 choice Janissaries below\r\nthe town. Then by a furious sally, flanked by a charge of ten squadrons\r\nof horse on the wings, he broke up that fanatical band and drove it\r\ninto the sea. Only 700 Turks survived. The affair was not of the first\r\nimportance, but it heartened the Russians for the greater enterprises\r\nof the next year.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Catharine, fuming at the sorry beginning of her war of\r\nconquest, upbraided her ally with his tardiness in coming to her help.\r\nBut Joseph was in a difficult situation. The ferment in the Netherlands\r\nand Hungary was increasing. The close union of England and Prussia\r\nin Dutch affairs caused him much concern; and, as we have seen in\r\nChapter XIV, the French Ministry was fain to huddle up the disputes in\r\nHolland, partly in order to be free to support the Sultan. Montmorin\r\nresolved to thwart the partition of the Turkish Empire and brought\r\npressure to bear upon Kaunitz, who ever looked askance on oriental\r\nadventures.[799] Nevertheless, by the month of November Joseph had\r\ndecided on war. The Austrians made a discreditable attempt to surprise\r\nBelgrade; and in February 1788 war was declared.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing campaign was fertile in surprises. As often happens, the\r\nAllies waited for one another to start the campaign, and thus lost the\r\nearly part of the summer. The Russians, owing to the armament of the\r\nSwedes and the incapacity of Potemkin, did far less than was expected;\r\nand the brunt of the Ottoman onset finally fell upon the Austrians.\r\nJoseph was compelled to fall back towards Temesvar on the night of\r\n20th September; and a panic seized the Imperialists. That motley host,\r\nmistaking the shouts of its diverse races for the war cry of the Turks,\r\nfired wildly upon the supposed pursuers; and the Ottomans, hearing\r\nthe babel din, finally pressed on the rout and captured 4,000 men and\r\na large part of the artillery and stores. Pestilence completed the\r\nwork begun by the Moslems; and thus it came about that the efforts of\r\n200,000 Austrians effected nothing more than the surrender of Chotzim\r\nand three other frontier strongholds of the second rank. The disgrace\r\ndimmed the lustre of their arms, undermined the health of the Emperor,\r\nand gave new heart to Hertzberg and the numerous enemies of the\r\nHapsburg realm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of this ignominious failure is ultimately traceable to\r\nan influence that had long been at work far away, namely, the restless\r\nambition of Gustavus III of Sweden. In the summer of the year 1788 that\r\nmonarch suddenly drew the sword against Catharine, and from the vantage\r\nground of his Finnish province marched towards St. Petersburg. This\r\nthreatening move compelled the Empress to recall part of her forces,\r\ncondemned the rest of them to the defensive, and thus exposed the\r\nAustrians to the spirited attack above described.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Pitt was held to be ultimately responsible for these\r\nevents, we must pause here to sketch the character and career of\r\nGustavus III. Of the three monarchs dealt with in this chapter he\r\nis not the least interesting. Rivalling Catharine in intellectual\r\nkeenness and moody waywardness, he excelled her in generosity, virtue,\r\nand chivalry. There is in him the strain of romance which refines\r\nthe schemes, and adds pathos to the failures, of Joseph II; but the\r\nSwede excelled the Hapsburg alike in grit, fighting power, charm, and\r\nversatility. He was a bundle of startling opposites. Slight of figure,\r\nnaturally delicate and pensive, he threw himself eagerly into feats\r\nof daring and hardihood. By turns poet and humourist, playwright and\r\nwarrior, devout but an incorrigible intriguer, he lured, enthralled,\r\nbrowbeat, or outwitted the Swedish people as no one had done since\r\nthe days of Charles XII. In truth he seemed a re-incarnation of that\r\nill-starred ruler, especially in his power of calling forth the utmost\r\nfrom his people, and leading them on to feats beyond their strength.\r\nFrom the midsummer day of 1771 on which the young King opened his\r\nEstates with a speech from the throne, it was clear that his iron will\r\nand captivating address might regain for the Crown the power torn from\r\nit some years before by the Caps, the faction of the opposing nobles\r\nand burghers. Fourteen months later Gustavus struck his blow. Despite\r\nthe Russian gold poured in for the support of the Caps, the King gained\r\nthe people and the army to his side, locked the recalcitrant Senate\r\nin their Chamber, overthrew the usurped authority of the Riksdag,\r\nand thenceforth governed in the interests of his people. It was\r\ncharacteristic of him that he prefaced his _coup d’état_ by the first\r\nperformance of a Swedish opera, the libretto of which he had himself\r\nrevised.[800]\r\n\r\nThenceforth “the royal charmer” governed at will, and Sweden regained\r\nmuch of her old prestige. The traditional alliance with France was\r\nrenewed; and for a time the jealous Catharine seemed to acquiesce in\r\nthe new order of things at Stockholm. In reality she never ceased to\r\nintrigue there, as also at Warsaw, seeking to recall the days of schism\r\nand weakness. The extravagance of Gustavus played into her hands.\r\nLittle by little the factions regained lost ground; the Riksdag of 1786\r\nthrew out all but one of the royal measures; and the King was fain to\r\ngovern more absolutely.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Turkish War now gave him the chance for which his restless\r\nspirit longed, namely, to attempt to recover part at least of\r\nthe trans-Baltic lands ceded to Russia, and to dissolve a secret\r\nRusso-Danish alliance which aimed at the overthrow of the present\r\n_régime_ in Sweden. He therefore allied himself with the Sultan on\r\ncondition of receiving a yearly subsidy of 1,000,000 piastres. He\r\nfurther sounded the Courts of Berlin, Warsaw, and Paris, but received\r\nno encouragement. At London, as we have seen, his overtures at\r\nChristmas 1787 were set aside. They were renewed in the spring of 1788,\r\nand received more attention, it being then the aim of Pitt to bring\r\nsome of the secondary States into the projected Triple Alliance. But\r\nthe ardent spirit of Gustavus far outleaped the mark. His demands for\r\nmoney were suspiciously large. “Sweden,” so Carmarthen wrote to Harris\r\non 20th June 1788, “has a most voracious appetite for subsidies, but\r\nfrom the enormous extravagance of her demand has put it out of our\r\npower to proceed further at present on that head.”[801]\r\n\r\nThis was fortunate; for Gustavus was then preparing to throw down the\r\ngauntlet to Russia. Early in July he set sail for Helsingfors, and\r\nlaunched at Catharine a furious ultimatum, bidding her cede Carelia and\r\nLivonia to the Swedes, and restore the Crimea to the Sultan. On the\r\nreceipt of that astonishing missive the imperial virago raged, wept,\r\nand swore by turns. The crisis was indeed serious. In and near St.\r\nPetersburg were only 6,000 troops.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she acted with her wonted vigour. She called up the\r\nMilitia; and her fleet, commanded by Admiral Greig and officered\r\nlargely by Britons, prepared to dispute with Gustavus the mastery\r\nof the Gulf of Finland.[802] In this it succeeded. It dealt the\r\nsmaller naval force of the Swedes a severe check, and soon cooped\r\nit up in Sveaborg. Meanwhile the advance of the Swedes from their\r\nFinnish province on the Russian capital was stopped by a mutiny of\r\nthe officers, which soon spread to the rank and file. The causes of\r\nthis event are still obscure. The admirers of Gustavus ascribed it to\r\nthe factiousness of nobles and the bribes of Catharine. The Swedish\r\nOpposition, and also Charles Keene, British envoy at Stockholm,\r\nexplained it as the natural outcome of the extravagance and ambition\r\nof the monarch who, not content with violating the constitution and\r\nruining the finances of his realm, wantonly plunged it into a struggle\r\nfor which he had not prepared. Consequently, when his ill-clad and\r\nill-fed militia found that the Russian raids into Finland were a myth,\r\nand that the only enemies were royal ambition and famine, they at once\r\nthwarted the former by constituting the army as a “confederation,” and\r\ndeclaring their resolve for peace. If there must be war with Russia,\r\nlet it be declared legally by a freely elected Diet at Stockholm.[803]\r\nThe Swedish crews at Sveaborg, where food and warlike munitions were\r\nalike wanting, partly joined in the movement; and the universality\r\nof the discontent, which compelled Gustavus to return helplessly to\r\nStockholm, is perhaps sufficient proof that influences were at work\r\nmore widespread than party spirit and more potent than foreign gold.\r\n\r\nHowever the fact may be explained, it is certain that the Swedes, when\r\nalmost within striking distance of the Russian capital, halted, sent\r\noffers of an armistice, and then retreated into Finland. Catharine was\r\nsaved; but after the capture of Oczakoff from the Turks she vented her\r\nspleen in one of her icily brilliant _mots_: “As Mr. Pitt wishes to\r\nchase me from St. Petersburg, I hope he will allow me to take refuge at\r\nConstantinople.”\r\n\r\nIt was natural for the Empress to suspect England and Prussia of\r\ncomplicity in the Swedish enterprise; for she herself in a similar\r\ncase would have egged on Gustavus. But the evidence in the British\r\narchives proves that neither George III nor Frederick William, Pitt\r\nnor Hertzberg, had a hand in the matter. George III and Pitt loved\r\npeace because it was economical. Through the spring and summer they\r\nwere trying to effect a pacification. On 16th May 1788 the Foreign\r\nOffice sent off a despatch to Ainslie urging him to co-operate with\r\nDietz, the Prussian Minister at the Porte, in order, if possible, to\r\npave the way for a joint mediation of England and Prussia with a view\r\nto a pacification in the East; but he was to beware of entering into\r\nother plans that the Court of Berlin might have in view, a hint against\r\nthe ambitious scheme of exchanges now forming in Hertzberg’s brain.\r\nOn Swedish affairs the despatch continued thus: “The Swedish armament\r\ncauses much speculation both in Russia and elsewhere: the avowed\r\npurpose is the necessity of having a respectable force in that Kingdom\r\nwhile Russia is fitting out so formidable a fleet.”[804] From this and\r\nother signs it is clear that Pitt and Carmarthen, far from expecting\r\nwar in the Baltic, were intent on plans for stopping it on the Danube\r\nand Black Sea.\r\n\r\nAs for Frederick William, he did not desire war in the North, because\r\nit must curtail his pleasures; and Hertzberg, because peace would\r\nleave him free to weave his plans more systematically. Ewart, our\r\nactive and zealous envoy at Berlin, who knew Hertzberg thoroughly,\r\ninformed Carmarthen on 19th June that Prussia was very cautious as to\r\nforming any connection with Sweden.[805] Nine days later he reported\r\nthat Gustavus had made an alliance with Turkey, but probably would not\r\nattack Catharine unless she sent a fleet from Cronstadt round to the\r\nMediterranean. On 25th July, after referring to the Swedish declaration\r\nof war against Russia, he added that the Court of Stockholm hoped for\r\nthe support of Prussia only so far as to keep Denmark quiet. As for\r\nhimself, he had rebuked the Swedish envoy.[806]\r\n\r\nIn truth the action of Gustavus annoyed both England and Prussia.\r\nThey expressed to him their disapproval of his conduct in strong\r\nterms. On 29th August Carmarthen wrote to Ewart censuring the action\r\nof Gustavus, but adding that the Allies must intervene to stop the\r\nwar in the Baltic.[807] Pitt also, on hearing of the Danish armament,\r\nresolved to save Gustavus from utter ruin. On 1st September he wrote\r\nas follows to Grenville (not, be it noted, to Carmarthen): “We had\r\nbefore written to Berlin with power to Ewart to send an offer of our\r\njoint mediation if the King of Prussia agreed, and this seems now the\r\nmore necessary. Our intervention may prevent his [Gustavus] becoming\r\ntotally insignificant, or dependent upon Russia, and it seems to me\r\nan essential point.”[808] Eight days later Carmarthen assured the\r\nPrussian Court of his satisfaction that it would join in the proposed\r\nmediation.[809]\r\n\r\nThe crisis was indeed most urgent. Catharine was thinking far less of\r\nflitting to Constantinople than of ousting Gustavus from Stockholm. Her\r\ntreaty with Denmark contained secret clauses which bound that Court to\r\nalliance with her in case of a Russo-Swedish war; and the young Prince\r\nRoyal of Denmark, though by marriage a nephew to Gustavus, was only too\r\neager for a campaign which promised to lead to the partition of the\r\nSwedish kingdom. The excellent navy of the Danes, and their possession\r\nof Norway, gave them great facilities for the invasion of the open\r\ncountry near the important city of Gothenburg; and, that once taken,\r\nthey could easily master the South, and leave the factions at Stockholm\r\nto complete their work.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was at Copenhagen one of the ablest of British\r\nenvoys. Hugh Elliot, brother of Sir Gilbert Elliot, was a man of spirit\r\nand resource. His demeanour and habits of mind were as much those of\r\na soldier as of a diplomatist; and nature had endowed him with the\r\nstately air and melodramatic arts which avail much at a crisis.[810]\r\nFor some time past he had suspected the ambitious views of the Prince\r\nRoyal of Denmark, who despite his minority, ruled the land through\r\nthe all-powerful Minister, Count Bernstorff. Their conduct was now\r\nsinister. Ostensibly they regretted that their treaty with Russia\r\ncompelled them to attack Sweden, and welcomed Elliot’s suggestion\r\nof British mediation as a means of preventing such a calamity.[811]\r\nPossibly this was Bernstorff’s real conviction; for Elliot found out\r\nlater that the Russian party had sworn to ruin him unless he favoured a\r\nwarlike policy.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that Bernstorff had instructed Schönborn, the Danish\r\nenvoy in London, to use honeyed words to Carmarthen, which virtually\r\ninvited England’s friendly mediation. In reply Carmarthen “told him\r\nthat the King lamented extremely the rupture which had taken place\r\nbetween Russia and Sweden, and assured him of His Majesty’s earnest\r\ndesire to contribute as far as possible to the restoration of the\r\ntranquillity of the North.” Carmarthen sent off a special messenger to\r\nElliot to enable him to propose immediately the mediation of England,\r\nPrussia, and Holland between Denmark and Sweden.[812] Bernstorff\r\nreceived this offer on 25th August in the friendliest manner, and\r\npromised to check the warlike ardour of the Prince Royal. Four days\r\nlater Elliot had an interview with the Prince in the hope of refuting\r\nthe persistent rumours that England had incited both the Sultan and\r\nthe King of Sweden to attack Russia. The Prince accepted his denials,\r\nbut assured him that the Danes must fulfil their treaty obligations to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThis serious news led Pitt once again directly to intervene in\r\ndiplomatic affairs, and to draft the despatch of 9th September to\r\nElliot. He there stated that the instructions already sent off to him,\r\nand to Ewart at Berlin, manifested the earnest desire of the British\r\nGovernment for the ending of hostilities in the Baltic, “which might\r\nbe injurious to the balance of power in that part of the world.” He\r\ndeplored the aggressive intentions of the Danish Court, as being alike\r\nopposed to its real interests and certain “to extend the mischiefs\r\nof the present war in a manner which cannot fail to excite the most\r\nserious attention, and to have a great effect on the conduct, of all\r\nthose Courts who are interested in the relative situation of the\r\ndifferent Powers of the Baltic.”[813]\r\n\r\nPitt, then, deeply regretted the outbreak of war in the North, but\r\nnone the less resolved to prevent the threatened dismemberment of\r\nSweden. The Prussian Court held even stronger views on the subject,\r\nand expressed its indignation at the Danish inroad into Sweden “after\r\nthe repeated assurances given by the Danish Minister of pacific and\r\nmoderate dispositions.”[814] So keen was the annoyance at Berlin\r\nthat Frederick William resolved to draw up a Declaration that, if\r\nDenmark attacked Gustavus, 16,000 Prussians would forthwith invade the\r\nDanish Duchy of Holstein. Ewart at once informed Elliot of the entire\r\nconcurrence of Prussia with England, and thus enabled him to play a\r\ndaring game. On the evening of 17th September, acting on the advice\r\nof Ewart, he resolved to take boat for the Swedish shore, and proceed\r\nto the headquarters of Gustavus. The news which finally prompted\r\nthis decision was that the Swedish monarch had decided to accept the\r\nproffered mediation not of the Allies, but of France.[815] Elliot\r\nhoped to reverse this decision and to secure the triumph of British\r\nand Prussian influence at the Swedish Court. He had not, it appears,\r\nreceived Pitt’s despatch cited above, or even the special Instructions\r\nsent a little earlier; but he knew enough to warrant his speaking in\r\nlofty tones, which were destined to dash the hopes of Catharine and the\r\nPrince Royal of Denmark.\r\n\r\nWe left Gustavus at Stockholm. There he did his best to quell the\r\ndiscontent of the burghers; but it is probable that a Revolution\r\nwould have broken out but for the threat of a Danish invasion and the\r\nimpending loss of Gothenburg. The national danger tended to still the\r\nstrife of parties; and the King, commending his queen and children to\r\nhis people, rode away to Dalecarlia in order to arouse the loyal miners\r\nand peasants of that region against the invaders. Though he harangued\r\nthem on the spot where Gustavus Vasa made his memorable appeals, their\r\nresponse was doubtful; but, having raised a small band, he proceeded\r\ntowards the threatened city.[816]\r\n\r\nOn his way he met the British envoy at the town of Carlstadt. For\r\neleven days Elliot had searched for the King, and now found him without\r\ntroops, without attendants, and with a small following of ill-armed\r\npeasants (29th September, 1788). Bitterly the monarch exclaimed that,\r\nlike James II, he must leave his kingdom, a victim to the ambition of\r\nRussia, the treachery of Denmark, the factious treason of his nobles,\r\nand his own mistakes. Thereupon Elliot replied: “Sire, give me your\r\nCrown; I will return it to you with added lustre.” He then told him of\r\nthe offer of mediation by England and Prussia on his behalf. At first,\r\nmindful of his engagements to France, Gustavus hesitated to accept\r\nit. Had he known that Elliot was acting without official instructions\r\nhe might have slighted the offer. In truth, Elliot was acting only\r\non the general direction, that he was “to prevent by every means any\r\nchange in the relative situation of the Northern nations.” If this\r\nformula was vague, it was wide; and it sufficed, along with the more\r\ndefinite support from Berlin, to decide the fate of Sweden. Gustavus\r\nat once resolved to place himself wholly in Elliot’s hands. The\r\nlatter therefore made his way to the Danish headquarters; while the\r\nKing proceeded to Gothenburg.[817] At that fortress the spirit of the\r\ndefenders was as scanty as the means of defence. But affairs took on\r\na new aspect when, at nightfall of 3rd October, a drenched and weary\r\nhorseman sought admittance at their gate. A tumult of joy arose in the\r\ntown when it was known that Gustavus was in their midst, the precursor\r\nof succouring bands. Now there was no thought of surrender.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, things would have gone hard with the burghers had the\r\nDanes pushed their attack home. This they seemed about to do. Elliot\r\nin his interview at their headquarters made little impression on the\r\nPrince Royal and the Commander-in-Chief, the Prince of Hesse. Their\r\nkinship to Gustavus seemed but to embitter their hostility; and they\r\nundoubtedly hoped, after the reduction of Gothenburg, to dismember the\r\nSwedish realm, and aggrandise the closely related houses of Russia and\r\nDenmark. They pressed on to Gothenburg and made ready for an assault.\r\nBut in the meantime Gustavus, receiving help from seamen on British\r\nvessels in the harbour, encouraged the citizens to make ready and man\r\nthe guns. So firm a front did the defenders present that the Danes on\r\n9th October assented to Elliot’s offer of an armistice of eight days.\r\nWithin that time the Prussian Declaration reached their headquarters,\r\nand lust of conquest now gave way to fear of a Prussian invasion of\r\nJutland. Again therefore Elliot succeeded in prolonging the armistice,\r\nwhich finally was extended to six months (13th November–13th May 1789).\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the initiative boldly taken by Ewart and\r\nElliot, backed by the threats from Berlin, saved Sweden from a position\r\nof acute danger. The King of Sweden himself confessed in a letter to\r\nArmfelt that Elliot’s _grand coup_ in effecting an armistice had saved\r\nhis kingdom, had restored the balance of Europe, and covered England\r\nwith glory. Erskine, British Consul at Gothenburg, also declared that\r\nbut for “the spirited and unremitted exertions of Mr. Elliot, there is\r\nnot a doubt but this city and province would have fallen into the hands\r\nof the enemy on their first advancing.”[818] Elliot also described\r\nhis achievements in flamboyant terms, which were called forth by an\r\nunmerited rebuke of our Foreign Office, that his instructions were\r\nto restore peace, not to threaten the Danes with war.[819] His reply\r\nof 15th November ran as follows: “The success of my efforts has been\r\nalmost miraculous.... Had I arrived at Carlstadt twenty-four hours\r\nlater than I did; had I negotiated with less _energy_ or success at\r\nGothenburg than what has drawn upon me the resentment of Russia and the\r\nabettors of the boundless ambition of that Court, the _Revolution_ in\r\nSweden was compleated, and a combination formed in the North equally\r\nhostile to England and Prussia.” He then charged Bernstorff with\r\nduplicity in expressing a desire for peace, “while the Danes were\r\nmarching on an almost defenceless town, the capture of which decided\r\nirrevocably the fate of Sweden and the Baltic.”... “Six weeks after\r\nmy arrival in Sweden a victorious army of 12,000 men, animated by\r\nthe presence of their Prince, in sight of a most brilliant conquest,\r\nwere checked in their progress by my single efforts; were induced to\r\nevacuate the Swedish territories, and consented to a truce of six\r\nmonths.... Perhaps in the annals of history there is not to be found\r\na more striking testimony of deference paid by a foreign prince to a\r\nKing of England than what the Prince Royal of Denmark manifested upon\r\nthis trying occasion.” He then stated that the efforts of the Prussian\r\nenvoy were of no avail owing to the dislike in which he was held; and\r\nthat only his [Elliot’s] influence availed to undo the harm caused by a\r\nviolent action of Gustavus III in the middle of October.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know what Pitt thought of this bombast;\r\nbut on 5th December Carmarthen guardedly commended the magniloquent\r\nenvoy, and urged him to gain over Denmark to the Triple Alliance;\r\nfor, as Catharine had now declined the mediation of the Allies, while\r\nGustavus had accepted it, Denmark could justly refuse her demands for\r\nhelp in the next campaign. Ostensibly Denmark refused; but, owing to\r\nthe profuse expenditure of the Russian Embassy at Copenhagen (estimated\r\nby our _chargé d’affaires_, Johnstone, at £500 a day[820]), Catharine\r\ngained permission to have fifteen warships from the White Sea repaired\r\nin that dockyard.\r\n\r\nGustavus III no sooner found himself safe than he laid his plans for\r\nhumbling his enemies both at home and abroad. He summoned a Diet, and\r\nproceeded to educate the electors in their duties by drawing up a list\r\nof the ten deputies whom the men of Stockholm should choose. They held\r\nother opinions, and sent up six declared opponents of the King.[821]\r\nOn the whole, however, the Estates were with him, and he imposed a\r\nconstitution on the recalcitrant Order of the Nobles, whereby he gained\r\nabsolute control of foreign policy. This triumph for autocracy took\r\nplace at the end of April 1789, only a week before the assembly of the\r\nStates-General at Versailles, which sounded the knell of the House of\r\nBourbon. Gustavus informed Elliot of his resolve to keep at peace with\r\nDenmark, because a war with her “would turn me from my great aim--the\r\nsafety of the Ottomans and the abasement of Russia.” He therefore\r\nbegged Elliot to assure the prolongation of the Danish armistice for\r\nsix months. That envoy had now come to see that the chief danger of\r\nSweden lay in “the romantic projects of glory and aggrandisement formed\r\nby the Sovereign himself”; and he pointed out the need for the Allies\r\nto prescribe the terms of peace before he succumbed to the superior\r\nforces of Russia.[822] Already Catharine had announced her resolve in\r\nthe words--“When Gustavus has had his say to his Diet, I will have my\r\nsay to him.”\r\n\r\nWith Elliot’s view of things Pitt and the Duke of Leeds (formerly\r\nMarquis of Carmarthen) were in complete accord. On 24th June they\r\ninformed him that Gustavus must not expect the Allies to make peace for\r\nhim on his own terms, but only on that of the _status quo ante bellum_.\r\nIn this effort England would cordially join in order to keep the\r\nbalance of power in the Baltic. “I cannot,” continued Leeds, “too often\r\nrepeat the earnest desire of this Government to conciliate the Court of\r\nDenmark in the first instance; nor do we lose sight of another material\r\nobject--I mean, a cordial and permanent connection with Russia.” Above\r\nall, England would not go to war unless the balance of the Baltic\r\nPowers were seriously endangered, to the detriment of the commercial\r\nStates.[823]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have another proof of the peaceful and cautious\r\ncharacter of Pitt’s policy. He distrusted the crowned Don Quixote of\r\nthe North, was resolved to save him only on England’s terms, viz.,\r\nthe _status quo_, and hoped that the pacification might lead up to an\r\nalliance with Denmark and finally with Russia. In fact, he kept in view\r\nthe Northern System which had guided British statesmen of the earlier\r\ngeneration. His aims were frustrated by the shifty policy of Denmark\r\nand the vindictiveness of Catharine. “Hamlet” and “Semiramis,” as\r\nHarris once termed them, thought lightly of England and longed for the\r\npartition of Sweden. Accordingly the Danish fleet convoyed the fifteen\r\nRussian men-of-war, long refitting at Copenhagen, into the Baltic,\r\nuntil they joined the Cronstadt squadron of twenty-six ships near\r\nBornholm, and thereby secured for it a superiority in that sea. The\r\nDuke of Leeds sent a sharp protest to Copenhagen, with the hint that\r\nfurthur actions of this kind might entail disagreeable consequences for\r\nDenmark.[824] Even with this unfair help accorded to Russia, the Swedes\r\nsustained no serious reverse either by land or sea. Gustavus summed up\r\nthe results of the campaign in the words: “After fighting like madmen\r\nabout every other day for two months, here we are at the same point at\r\nwhich we started.” Nevertheless he had clogged the efforts of Catharine\r\nagainst the Turks, and thus enabled his allies to prolong the unequal\r\nstruggle against two great empires. Neither the loss of Oczakoff,\r\nnor the accession of the less capable Sultan, Selim III, daunted the\r\nresolve of the Ottomans to continue a war which was for them an affair\r\nof religious zeal and national honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nPARTITION OR PACIFICATION?\r\n\r\n    He who gains nothing, loses.--CATHARINE II.\r\n\r\n    We cannot be considered as in any degree bound to support a system\r\n    of an offensive nature, the great end of which appears to be\r\n    aggrandisement rather than security.--PITT and the DUKE OF LEEDS,\r\n    24th June 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excess of an evil tends to produce its own cure. The resources\r\nof two great Empires were being used for a partition of the Turkish\r\ndominions, in a way which must have led to a succession of wars\r\nwithout benefiting the Christians of the East. But the prospect of\r\nthe aggrandisement of Russia speedily led the hardy Gustavus to\r\nstrike a blow at her northern capital; and when Catharine incited the\r\nDanes to deal a counterstroke at his unguarded rear, Great Britain\r\nand Prussia intervened to prevent the overthrow of Sweden and of the\r\nbalance of power in the Baltic. Thus, forces which pressed on towards\r\nConstantinople produced a sharp reaction in widening circles and\r\nprompted States to attack or arm against their neighbours--Sweden\r\nagainst Russia, Denmark against Sweden, and England and Prussia against\r\nDenmark. Consequently Gustavus III might claim to have saved the\r\nTurkish Empire; for his action brought into the arena England and, to\r\nsome extent, the Dutch Republic.\r\n\r\nLess obvious but more potent was the influence of Prussia. Her forces,\r\ncantoned along the Austrian and Russian borders, halved the efforts of\r\nthose Empires against the Turks and encouraged the Polish nationalists\r\nto resist Russian predominance at Warsaw. Thus, by the year 1789,\r\ninstead of moving the forces of two Empires and of Poland against the\r\nTurks, Catharine found her energies clogged, her resources strained,\r\nand only one important conquest achieved, that of Oczakoff. Over\r\nagainst this triumph she had to set the menacing attitude of the\r\nTriple Alliance lately framed by Great Britain, Prussia, and the Dutch\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Czarina cherished the hope that the insanity of George\r\nIII, and the accession of the Regent, would lead to the downfall\r\nof Pitt and the reversal of British policy. On 8/19 December 1788\r\nshe wrote to her ambassador at London, Count Vorontzoff (Woronzow),\r\ncharging him to make overtures to Fox and the Dukes of Portland and\r\nDevonshire for the renewal of the Anglo-Russian alliance, which for the\r\nlast five years she had spurned. With a vehemence of style, in which\r\nfeelings figured as facts, she inveighed against Pitt for slighting her\r\nmany offers of friendship, for allowing Ainslie and Elliot to incite\r\nTurkey and Sweden to attack her, and for entangling himself in the\r\ndangerous and visionary schemes of Hertzberg. All this, however, would\r\nbe changed when the Prince of Wales and Fox came to power.\r\n\r\nOn 19/30 January Vorontzoff replied that he had seen Fox, who accorded\r\nhim a hearty welcome, and said that in a fortnight the Regency would\r\nbe established. He (Fox) would then be Foreign Secretary, and would\r\nbe able to speak of England’s treaty obligations to Prussia. The\r\nlanguage of Fox showed some measure of caution, and partly palliated\r\nthe gross imprudence of according an interview at all. A little later\r\n(perhaps before receiving Vorontzoff’s answer) the Empress expressed\r\nher admiration of the reply sent by the Prince of Wales (it was really\r\nBurke’s and Sheridan’s) to Pitt, as it argued distinguished talents.\r\nThe Prince and Fox, she said, would certainly prevent their people\r\nbeing dragged at the heel of Prussia. As for herself, she declared\r\nher wish to grant them a commercial treaty, which she had refused\r\ntwo years before. The correspondence throws a curious light on the\r\nfeline diplomacy of Catharine and on the singular folly of Fox.[825]\r\nIt also prepares us for the unpatriotic part which he played in the\r\nAnglo-Russian dispute of the year 1791. The recovery of George III,\r\nabout the time when Catharine indited the latter epistle, pricked the\r\nbubble, and left Pitt in a position of greater power than ever.\r\n\r\nThus, in the spring of 1789, the general position was somewhat as\r\nfollows. England, Prussia, and Holland, acting in close concert, were\r\nresolved to prevent any revolutionary changes in the Baltic. This\r\nimplied that Denmark could not attack Sweden, and that Gustavus might\r\nwar against Catharine until she chose to accept the mediation of the\r\nAllies for the re-establishment of the _status quo ante bellum_. As for\r\nthe other Powers, France was almost a nullity owing to the internal\r\ntroubles which were leading up to the Revolution. Spain was friendly to\r\nthe Allies and favoured the cause of Sweden and Turkey.[826] Moreover\r\nthe Poles, acting on hints from Berlin, were beginning to shake off\r\nRussian tutelage and to feel their way towards a drastic reform of\r\ntheir chaotic polity. Early in 1789 the Prussian Court sought for a\r\nclose political and commercial union with Poland. The ensuing compact\r\nfreed the Poles from the obligations contracted by King Stanislaus\r\nwith his former mistress, Catharine II; it further promised to bind\r\ntheir realm to England and Holland; above all, it opened up vast\r\npossibilities for the regeneration of that hapless people.\r\n\r\nAs for the concert of the two Empires, discords were already heard.\r\nJoseph II, alarmed at the turmoil in Hungary and Belgium, as well\r\nas disgusted at the results of his first Turkish campaign, talked\r\nof waging merely a defensive war, and of offering easy terms to the\r\nOttomans. Potemkin, puffed up by the capture of Oczakoff, announced\r\nhis resolve that Moldavia and Wallachia should never fall to the\r\nHapsburgs--an aim that had been distinctly formulated at Vienna.\r\nRussia herself, a prey to the greedy gang who fawned on the Empress\r\nand drained her treasury, seemed unable to bear for long the strain of\r\nwar on two frontiers, and of precautionary measures against Prussia.\r\nThe Court of Berlin, as Mirabeau had pointed out, was honeycombed by\r\nintrigues and favouritism; but it was sound at the core compared with\r\nRussia. The French author of the “Secret Memoirs of the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg” states that in the declining years of Catharine the Russian\r\nfinances were exploited in a way more disgraceful than even France\r\nhad seen; that none were so little as the great; and that officers\r\nnotoriously lived on the funds of their regiments. Catharine herself\r\nonce jauntily remarked about a colonel--“Well! If he be poor, it is his\r\nown fault; for he has long had a regiment.” It speaks volumes for the\r\npatriotism and stupidity of the troops that they still had enough of\r\nthe old Muscovite staunchness to carry them to victory over the Turks.\r\nBut such was the case. In the campaigns of 1789 the army of Suvóroff\r\ngained several successes, and the troops of Joseph II, once more urged\r\nonwards by that ruler, also had their meed of triumph.\r\n\r\nThis was partly due to the death of Abdul Hamid I, which brought to the\r\nOttoman throne a feebler successor, Selim III (April 1789). The Grand\r\nVizier, the soul of the war party, was soon overthrown, and the next\r\ncommander-in-chief, the Pacha of Widdin, impaired by his slothfulness\r\nthe fighting power of the Ottomans.[827] Belgrade and Semendria were\r\nlost. But even more serious, perhaps, than these reverses was the\r\nemergence of plans at Berlin which portended gain to Prussia at the\r\nexpense of Turkey. We are concerned here with European affairs only so\r\nfar as they affected British policy, and must therefore concentrate\r\nour attention on the statecraft of the years 1789 and 1790, which\r\nthreatened sweeping changes on the Continent and brought into play the\r\ncautious conservatism of Pitt. The French Revolution and its immense\r\nconsequences will engage our attention later.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in Chapter XVI, the Prussian statesman, Hertzberg, had long\r\nbeen maturing an ingenious scheme for the aggrandisement of Prussia, by\r\na general shuffling together of boundaries in the East of Europe.[828]\r\nOn 13th May 1789 he presented it in its complete form to Frederick\r\nWilliam, who, after long balancings on this question, now accorded his\r\nconsent. The Prussian monarch thereby pledged himself, at a favourable\r\noccasion, to offer his armed mediation to Russia, Austria, and Turkey.\r\nIf the two Empires overcame the Sultan, as seemed probable, Prussia was\r\nto threaten their frontiers with masses of troops and, under threat of\r\nwar, compel them to accept her terms. If, however, victory inclined\r\nto the crescent, Dietz, the Prussian envoy at Constantinople, was to\r\nremind the Sublime Porte that the triumph was largely due to Prussia’s\r\naction in enabling Sweden to continue the war against Russia, and in\r\nthwarting Catharine’s plan of an invasion of Turkey by the Poles.\r\nDietz was also to hint “in a delicate and not threatening manner,”\r\nthat if Prussia threw her weight into the scales against the Turks,\r\nthe new Coalition must speedily overwhelm her. “Therefore the Porte\r\nwill do well not to balance on that point,” but will accept Prussia’s\r\nterms.[829] There was a third alternative, that the war would drag on\r\nindecisively, in which case the exhaustion of the belligerents must\r\nenable Prussia to work her will the more readily.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Hertzberg hoped that, however the fortunes of war inclined,\r\nhe would gain his ends. They were as follows. The Turks, if victorious,\r\nmust sacrifice their gains (the Crimea, etc.) at the demand of Prussia,\r\nand thus enable her to compel Austria to restore to the Poles the great\r\nprovince of Galicia, torn from them in the partition of 1772. The Poles\r\nin their turn were to reward Frederick William by ceding to him the\r\nfortresses of Danzig and Thorn, along with part of Great Poland, which\r\nso inconveniently divided Prussia’s eastern lands.\r\n\r\nThe same general result was to follow in the event of Russia and\r\nAustria driving back the Turks to their last natural barrier, the\r\nBalkans. Prussia was then to draw the sword on behalf of Turkey and\r\nSweden, restore the balance in the South-East, and give the law to all\r\nparties. In that case, it appeared (though Hertzberg wavered on this\r\npoint), Austria might acquire Moldavia and Wallachia from Turkey, and\r\nthereby close against Russia the door leading to the Balkans. At times\r\nHertzberg stated that Austria must in any case gain those commanding\r\nprovinces, which would sever her friendship with Russia.[830] As for\r\nCatharine, she might retain the Crimea, and gain land perhaps as far as\r\nthe Dniester. On the whole, however, Hertzberg hoped that Prussia need\r\nnot go to war, but that the Turks would make a good enough stand at the\r\nDanube to enable the mere appearance of the splendid army of Prussia on\r\nthe frontiers of the two Empires to enforce his demands.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written for and against this scheme. Among the many\r\nprojects of that time it holds a noteworthy place. Certainly it would\r\ngreatly have simplified the boundaries of Eastern Europe. The recovery\r\nby Poland of her natural frontier on the south-west, the Carpathians,\r\nwould strengthen that State, and enable her, with the help of her\r\nPrussian ally, to defy the wrath of the two Imperial Courts. Hertzberg\r\nbelieved that the Poles would gladly accept the offer. For was not\r\nthe great province of Galicia worth the smaller, though commercially\r\nvaluable, districts on the lower Vistula which would go to Frederick\r\nWilliam? Further, would not a good commercial treaty between the Allies\r\n(in which England, it was hinted, might have her share) make up for the\r\nloss of the prosperous city of Danzig? In truth, the proposal reminds\r\none of the schemes for scientific frontiers which Rousseau outlined and\r\nNapoleon reduced to profitable practice.\r\n\r\nIt might have succeeded had nations been mere amoebae, divisible at\r\nwill. Traders and philosophers might acclaim Hertzberg as the Adam\r\nSmith of Prussia and Poland. In truth, his plan was defensible, even\r\non its Machiavellian side--the aggrandisement of Prussia, ultimately\r\nat the expense of the Turks. For it might be argued that the ultimate\r\ntriumph of the crescent was impossible, and that only the action of\r\nSweden, Prussia, and to a less extent England, could avert disaster.\r\nHertzberg also claimed that Prussia and her Allies should guarantee to\r\nTurkey the security of her remaining possessions, and deemed this a\r\nset-off to the disappointments brought by his other proposals.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the balance of argument was heavily against the scheme. As\r\nthe Pitt Cabinet pointed out in a weighty pronouncement on 24th June,\r\nHertzberg proposed to use Turkey as a medium for the attainment of his\r\nends, which were the depression of Austria and the aggrandisement of\r\nPrussia. However well and successfully the Turks fought, the gain was\r\nto accrue to Frederick William, not to the Swedes, who were fighting\r\ndesperately for the Ottoman cause. True, Prussia promised in the last\r\nresort to help the Sultan to recover some of his lost provinces; but\r\neven then, the acquisitions of the two Empires at the end of costly\r\ncampaigns were scarcely to balance those of Prussia and Poland. Well\r\nmight the British Cabinet say of the Turks: “It seems very doubtful\r\nwhether either their power or their inclination would answer the\r\nexpectations of the Court of Berlin.”\r\n\r\nAfter this ironical touch the verdict of the Pitt Ministry was given to\r\nEwart as follows:\r\n\r\n    You will not fail to assure the Ministers at Berlin of the\r\n    satisfaction with which the King will see any real and solid\r\n    advantages derived to His Prussian Majesty by such arrangements\r\n    as may be obtained by way of negotiation and without the danger\r\n    of extending those hostilities [which] it is so much the interest\r\n    of all Europe to put an end to. We cannot but acknowledge the\r\n    friendly attention manifested by His Prussian Majesty towards his\r\n    Allies in taking care not to commit them in the event of the Porte\r\n    acceding to the proposed plan of co-operation, the operations of\r\n    which go so much beyond the spirit of our treaty of Alliance,\r\n    which is purely of a defensive nature, and by which we cannot of\r\n    course be considered as in any degree bound to support a system\r\n    of an offensive nature, the great end of which appears to be\r\n    aggrandisement rather than security, and which from its very nature\r\n    is liable to provoke fresh hostilities instead of contributing to\r\n    the restoration of general tranquillity.\r\n\r\n    In discussing these points, and indeed upon every other occasion,\r\n    I must beg of you, Sir, to remember that it is by no means\r\n    the idea of His Majesty, or of his confidential servants, to\r\n    risk the engaging this country in a war on account of Turkey,\r\n    either directly or indirectly; and I am to desire you would be\r\n    particularly careful in your language, to prevent any intention\r\n    of that nature being imputed to us. I think it necessary to\r\n    mention this distinctly, as I observe in one of your dispatches,\r\n    you state the continuance of the Northern War _as in some degree\r\n    advantageous_, as it would be a powerful _diversion in case the\r\n    Allies should take part in the Turkish War_. This I must again\r\n    observe to you is an object by no means in our view.\r\n\r\n    With respect to any future guarantee of the Ottoman Empire it is\r\n    impossible for us to commit ourselves at present. The consideration\r\n    will naturally arise how far such a guarantee is either necessary\r\n    or beneficial when the terms of peace come under discussion. The\r\n    effect which a guarantee of the Turkish possessions might create\r\n    in Russia likewise deserves some consideration; and I cannot but\r\n    observe that the whole tenor of these Instructions [those sent to\r\n    Dietz] seems likely to throw at a greater distance the chance of\r\n    detaching Russia from Austria and connecting it with us; whereas\r\n    hitherto it has been our object, and, as it appeared to us, that\r\n    of Prussia, while we made Russia feel the disadvantage of being\r\n    upon distant terms with us, and avoided doing anything which looked\r\n    like courting her friendship, still to avoid pushing things to an\r\n    extremity or precluding a future connection.[831]\r\n\r\nAt several points this pronouncement challenges attention. Firstly,\r\nit does not once refer to the feelings and prejudices of the peoples\r\nwho were to be bartered about. Only four days previously the Commons\r\nof France had sworn by the Tennis Court Oath that they would frame a\r\nconstitution for their land--a declaration which rang trumpet-tongued\r\nthrough England; but not the faintest echo of it appears in the\r\nofficial language of Pitt and the Duke of Leeds. Their arguments\r\nare wholly those of the old school, but of the old school at its\r\nbest. For, secondly, they deprecate changes of territory forced by a\r\nmediating Power on the people it ostensibly befriends, which tend to\r\ntheir detriment and its own benefit. They question whether Prussia can\r\npress through these complex partitions without provoking a general\r\nwar--the very evil which the Triple Alliance has sought to avoid.\r\nCertainly England will never go to war to bring them about; neither\r\nwill she draw the sword on behalf of Turkey. On the contrary, she hopes\r\nfinally to regain the friendship of Russia. Most noteworthy of all is\r\nthe central criticism, that the aim of Hertzberg is “aggrandisement\r\nrather than security.” We shall have occasion to observe how often Pitt\r\nused this last word to denote the end for which he struggled against\r\nRevolutionary France and Napoleon; and its presence in this despatch\r\nbespeaks the mind of the Prime Minister acting through the pen of the\r\nDuke of Leeds.\r\n\r\nThe defensive character of Pitt’s policy further appears in a despatch\r\nto Ewart, also of 24th June, cautioning that very zealous envoy that\r\nall possible means are being taken to win over Denmark peacefully to\r\nthe Triple Alliance, in order that it may “command the keys of the\r\nBaltic.” Gustavus is to be warned that the Allies cannot help him\r\nunless he agrees to forego his hopes of gain at the expense of Russia,\r\nand “to act merely upon the defensive.” The _status quo ante bellum_\r\nwould be the fairest basis of peace in the Baltic, and it would prove\r\n“that the real object of our interference was calculated for general\r\nviews of public utility, and not founded upon any motives of partiality\r\nfor one Power or resentment to another.”\r\n\r\nFor a time events seemed to work against the pacific policy of Pitt and\r\nin favour of the schemes of Hertzberg. The summer witnessed not only\r\nthe advance of the Russians and Austrians into the Danubian Provinces,\r\nbut also the wrigglings to and fro of the Danish Court, which enabled\r\nthe Russian squadron at Copenhagen to join the Cronstadt fleet and\r\ncommand the Baltic. Nevertheless, Prussia felt that she had the game\r\nin her own hands, however much her Allies might hold aloof; for the\r\nAustrian Government was distracted by news of the seething discontent\r\nof the Hungarians, of the Poles in Galicia, and, above all, of the\r\nBrabanters and Flemings. Joseph II, too, was obviously sinking under\r\nthese worries, which seemed to presage the break up of his Empire.[832]\r\nThe Prussian Court therefore resolved to concentrate its efforts on\r\nwresting Galicia and the Belgic Provinces from the Hapsburg Power,\r\nespecially as the Porte, despite its recent defeats, refused to listen\r\nto Dietz when he mentioned the cession of Moldavia and Wallachia to the\r\ninfidels.[833] Until the Moslems had learnt the lessons of destiny,\r\nit was obviously desirable to set about robbing Austria by more\r\nstraightforward means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe folly of Joseph II favoured this scheme of robbery. His reforms\r\nin the Belgic Provinces had long brought that naturally conservative\r\npeople to the brink of revolt, so that in the spring of the year 1789\r\nplans were laid not only at Brussels but also at Berlin for securing\r\ntheir independence. Hertzberg sought to work upon the fears of Pitt by\r\nhinting that Austria might call in the French troops to stamp out the\r\ndiscontent--a contingency far from unlikely, were it not that France\r\nwas rapidly sliding into the abyss of bankruptcy and revolution. By a\r\ncurious coincidence the repressive authority of Joseph II was exerted\r\non 18th June, the day after the Third Estate of France defiantly styled\r\nitself the National Assembly. While Paris was jubilant at the news of\r\nthis triumph, the mandates of the Emperor swept away the Estates and\r\nancient privileges of Brabant. As this action involved the suppression\r\nof the ancient charter of privileges, quaintly termed _La Joyeuse\r\nEntrée_, the Brabanters put into practice its final clause, that the\r\ncitizens might use force against the sovereign who infringed its\r\nprovisions. “Act here as in Paris” ran the placards in Brussels and\r\nother cities. The capture of the Bastille added fuel to the fire in\r\nBelgium; and the nationalist victory was completed by a rising of the\r\nmen of Liége against the selfish and deadening rule of their Prince\r\nBishop.[834]\r\n\r\nThe likeness between the Belgian and French Revolutions is wholly\r\nsuperficial. Despite the effort of Camille Desmoulins to link the\r\ntwo movements in sympathy--witness the title of his newspaper “Les\r\nRévolutions de France et de Brabant”--no thinking man could confound\r\nthe democratic movement in France with the narrowly national and\r\nclerical aims of the majority in Brabant and Flanders. True, an attempt\r\nwas made by a few progressives, under the lead of Francis Vonck, to\r\ninculcate the ideas of Voltaire and Rousseau; but the influence of\r\nthe Roman Church, always paramount in Flanders, availed to crush this\r\neffort. Van der Noot and the clericals gained the upper hand, and\r\nfinally compelled the Vonckists to flee over the southern border.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July Van der Noot declared in favour of a Belgian\r\nRepublic under the guarantee and protection of England, Prussia, and\r\nHolland. He set on foot overtures to this end which met with a friendly\r\nresponse at Berlin and The Hague.[835] The Prussian Court sent General\r\nSchliessen to discuss the matter with the British Government; but Pitt\r\nand Leeds behaved very guardedly on a question involving a recognition\r\nof the Belgian revolt and the end of the Barrier System on which we had\r\nlong laid so much stress. Their despatch of 14th September to Ewart\r\nemphasized the difficulties attending Van der Noot’s proposal, even if\r\nhis statements were correct. At the same time Ministers asserted that\r\nthe Allies must at all costs prevent the Belgians becoming dependent on\r\nFrance, a noteworthy statement which foreshadows Pitt’s later policy of\r\nresisting the annexation of those rich provinces to the French Republic\r\nor Empire. For the present, he strongly advised Prussia and Holland to\r\nawait the course of events and do nothing “to threaten the interruption\r\nof that tranquillity it is so much their interest, and, I trust, their\r\nintention, to preserve.” Above all, it would be well to wait for the\r\ndeath of Joseph II, already announced as imminent, seeing that his\r\nsuccessor might grant to the Belgians the needed concessions.[836]\r\n\r\nThe Belgians seem to have trusted the Pitt Cabinet far more than\r\nHertzberg, whose restless policy aroused general distrust. They made\r\ntwo overtures to the British Court. The former of these, strange to\r\nsay, came through a French nobleman, the Comte de Charrot, who called\r\non Lord Robert Fitzgerald, our envoy at Paris, on or about 21st\r\nOctober, and confided to him his resentment against France, his warm\r\nsympathies with the Belgians (he was a descendant of the old Counts of\r\nFlanders), and his fear that France would dominate that land after the\r\ndownfall of Austrian authority. He besought Fitzgerald to forward to\r\nthe Duke of Leeds a letter warning the Cabinet of the efforts of the\r\nNational Assembly to form a party among the Brabanters and Flemings,\r\nwho, however, were resolved not to accept the rule of a foreign prince,\r\nbut to form a Republic under the protection of Great Britain. To this\r\nend they were willing to place in her hands the city of Ostend as a\r\npledge of their fidelity to the British connection. A German prince, he\r\nadded, would never be tolerated, save in the eastern provinces, Limburg\r\nand Luxemburg. His letter, dated Antwerp, 15th October, to the Duke of\r\nLeeds, is couched in the same terms.[837]\r\n\r\nThe proposal opens up a vista of the possibilities of that strange\r\nsituation. By planting the British flag at Ostend, and by allowing\r\nPrussia to dominate the eastern Netherlands, Pitt could have built up\r\nonce more a barrier on the north-east of France. All this was possible,\r\nprovided that Charrot’s proposals were genuine and represented the\r\nreal feelings of the Belgians. Evidently Pitt and Leeds distrusted the\r\noffer, which seems to have been left unanswered.\r\n\r\nEarly in November, when the plans of the Belgian patriots for ousting\r\nthe Austrians were nearing completion, they sent as spokesman Count de\r\nRoode to appeal for the protection of George III. Pitt laid the request\r\nbefore the King; and the result will be seen in Pitt’s letter to the\r\nCount:\r\n\r\n                                        Downing St. _Nov. 13, 1789_.\r\n\r\n    I have received the letter which you honoured me with, informing\r\n    me that you were employed on the part of the people of Brabant\r\n    to solicit the King’s protection, and desiring to see me for the\r\n    purpose of delivering a letter to me on that subject. I thought\r\n    it my duty to lay these circumstances before His Majesty, who has\r\n    not been pleased to authorize me to enter into any discussion in\r\n    consequence of an application which does not appear to be made by\r\n    any regular or acknowledged authority. I must therefore, Sir, beg\r\n    you to excuse me, if, on that account, I am under the necessity of\r\n    declining seeing you for the purpose which you propose.[838]\r\n\r\nSomewhat earlier the Duke of Orleans had come on a mission to London,\r\nostensibly on the Belgian Question, but really for a term of forced\r\nabsence from Paris. It will therefore be well to describe his visit in\r\na later chapter.\r\n\r\nCold as were Pitt’s replies to de Roode, he certainly kept a watchful\r\neye on Belgian affairs. For, on the one hand, if Joseph II succeeded\r\nin establishing despotic power at Brussels, he would gain complete\r\ncontrol over the finances and armed forces of that flourishing land,\r\nwith results threatening to the Dutch and even to Prussia. If, however,\r\nthe Brabanters succeeded as the Flemings had done, French democracy\r\nmight rush in as a flood and gallicize the whole of that land to\r\nthe detriment of England. Pitt therefore approved of the Prussian\r\nproposal to send troops to occupy the Bishopric of Liége, seeing that\r\nthe deposed bishop had appealed to Austria for armed aid. With the\r\nprestige gained by the military occupation of Liége, Hertzberg hoped\r\nto dominate the situation both in the Low Countries and in the East.\r\nMost pressingly did he urge the need of instantly recognizing the\r\nindependence of the Belgian provinces; but after long arguments Ewart\r\nconvinced him that it might be better, even for Prussia, to press for\r\nthe restoration of their old constitution, with all its limitations to\r\nthe power of the Emperor, under the guarantee of the three Allies. If\r\nEwart succeeded with Hertzberg, he failed with Frederick William, who\r\non that and other occasions showed himself “very elated” and determined\r\nto tear from Austria that valuable possession, as well as Galicia.[839]\r\nHertzberg did his utmost to persuade England to combine the two\r\nquestions so as the more to embarrass Austria; but he met with steady\r\nrefusals.\r\n\r\nOn 30th November Pitt took the sense of the Cabinet. It was clearly in\r\nfavour of non-intervention and the restoration as far as possible of\r\nthe previous state of things. Nevertheless, the men of Brabant, in case\r\nof defeat by the Imperialists, were encouraged to hope that the Allies\r\nwould declare for the restoration of the old constitution. On the other\r\nhand, in case of victory, they were to be induced “to take steps for\r\npreventing the prevalence of democratical principles.”[840] Obviously,\r\nthen, Pitt desired to keep out both Prussian and French influence,\r\nand to leave the Belgians free to come to terms with the successor of\r\nJoseph II after the imminent demise of that monarch. Events favoured\r\nthis solution. In December Brussels and all parts of Brabant shook off\r\nthe yoke of the Imperialists, who retired to Luxemburg. Early in the\r\nyear 1790 deputies from the nine Belgic provinces met at Brussels,\r\ndeclared the deposition of Joseph, and formed a Federal Congress for\r\nmutual protection. The clerical and conservative party, headed by Van\r\nder Noot, sent to Paris an appeal for support, which found no favour\r\neither with Louis or the National Assembly, the King desiring not to\r\noffend Austria, and the French deputies distrusting the aims of the\r\nmajority at Brussels.\r\n\r\nPitt and his colleagues were equally cautious. On the news of the\r\nsuccessful revolt of Brussels, they seemed for a time to incline to the\r\nPrussian plan of recognizing the independence of Belgium,[841] and on\r\n9th January 1790 they framed a compact with Prussia and Holland with\r\na view to taking common action in this affair. But the most urgent\r\ndemands from Berlin in favour of immediate action failed to push Pitt\r\non to this last irrevocable step. It does not appear that the King\r\ncontrolled his action; for at that time he was so far absorbed in the\r\nescapades of his sons (those of Prince Edward were an added trouble) as\r\nto be a cipher in all but domestic concerns. Pitt and Leeds therefore\r\nhad a free hand. They were influenced probably by the news that Joseph,\r\ndespite the progress of his mortal disease, had resolved to subdue\r\nthe Netherlands. The tidings opened up two alternatives--war between\r\nAustria and Prussia, or the possibility of a peaceful compromise\r\nafter the death of Joseph and the accession of his far more tractable\r\nbrother, Leopold.\r\n\r\nThese seem to have been the motives underlying the decision of the\r\nPitt Cabinet, early in 1790, to defer any decisive action by the\r\nAllies. The Duke of Leeds pointed out to Ewart on 9th February that\r\nthe feuds between the Belgic provinces made them useless as allies;\r\nthat any immediate recognition of their independence would have\r\n“mischievous effects”; and that a reconciliation between them and their\r\nfuture ruler seemed highly probable. They should, therefore, not be\r\nencouraged to hope for recognition by the Allies. Leeds closed by very\r\npertinently asking the Court of Berlin “how far this new Republic, once\r\nestablished, could be (and by whom) prevented from becoming indirectly,\r\nif not directly, totally dependent upon France.” The argument derived\r\nadded force from the fact that a “French emissary” was then at Brussels\r\noffering the recognition by France of the proposed Belgian Republic,\r\nwith the help of 20,000 troops against any who should oppose it.[842]\r\nThis offer was not official; but as the moods of the National Assembly\r\nvaried day by day, it might at any time become so. Certainly the chance\r\nof French invervention added a sting to the reproaches soon to be\r\nlevelled at Pitt from Berlin.\r\n\r\nThey were called forth by the missive above referred to, and by a\r\n“secret and confidential” despatch of the same date. In the latter Pitt\r\nand Leeds warned Ewart that the proposed armed mediation of Prussia\r\nagainst Catharine and Joseph was outside the scope of the Triple\r\nAlliance. The British Government wished Prussia the success which might\r\nbe expected from the power of her army, the flourishing state of her\r\nrevenue, and the present doubtful condition both of Russia and Austria;\r\nbut it could not participate in “measures adopted without the previous\r\nconcurrence of the Allies.”[843]\r\n\r\nA storm of obloquy broke upon Ewart when he announced these decisions.\r\nThe Court of Berlin insisted on the need of immediately recognizing\r\nBelgian independence, adding a threat that otherwise those provinces\r\nwould do well to throw themselves upon France. Our ambassador partly\r\nsucceeded in stilling the storm, especially when news came of tumults\r\nat Brussels and the uncertainty of the outlook throughout Brabant.\r\nFrederick William then recognized the wisdom of waiting until affairs\r\nwere more settled, but he declared that he “was abandoned by his\r\nAllies,” and that, unless Galicia could be detached from Austria, he\r\nwould prefer to see the Netherlands go to France.[844] This piece of\r\nroyal pettishness served at least to show that his friendship for\r\nEngland depended on her serving his designs against Austria.\r\n\r\nHere was the weakness of the Triple Alliance. The Allies had almost\r\nnothing in common, except that the British and Dutch both wished to\r\nlive in peace and develop their trade. Prussia, on the contrary, saw\r\nin this time of turmoil the opportunity of consolidating her scattered\r\nEastern lands by a scheme not unlike the Belgic-Bavarian Exchange.\r\nOn the score of morality we may censure such plans; but vigorous and\r\ngrowing States will push them on while their rivals are abased, and\r\nwill discard Allies who oppose them. In this contrariety of interests\r\nlay the secret of the weakness of the Anglo-Prussian alliance during\r\nthe upheavals of the near future. It also happened that the House of\r\nHohenzollern matured these plans at the very time when the fortunes\r\nof the House of Hapsburg, after touching their nadir, began once more\r\nto rise; and the revival of Austria under Leopold II helped Pitt\r\nto maintain the existing order of things in Central Europe against\r\nall the schemings of Hertzberg. The success of Pitt in this work of\r\nstatesmanlike conservation marks the climax of his diplomatic career;\r\nand, as it has never received due attention, I make no apology for\r\ntreating it somewhat fully in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nPARTITION OR PACIFICATION (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n    I want the trumpet of an angel to proclaim to the ears of\r\n    sovereigns that it is become their universal interest as well as\r\n    their moral duty to have a period of peace.--LORD AUCKLAND TO SIR\r\n    ROBERT MURRAY KEITH, 7th May 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably at no time in the history of Europe have all the leading\r\nStates been so bent on plans of mutual spoliation as in the closing\r\nweeks of the life of Joseph II of Austria. The failure of his schemes\r\nand the probability of a break up of the Hapsburg dominions whetted\r\nthe appetites of all his neighbours and brought Europe to the verge\r\nof a general war. In these circumstances it was providential that one\r\nGreat Power stood for international morality, and that its counsels\r\nwere swayed by a master-mind. The future of Europe depended on the\r\nintelligent conservatism of Pitt and the duration of the life of his\r\npolitical opposite, Joseph II. That life had long been wearing rapidly\r\naway; and on 20th February 1790 he died, full of pain, disappointment,\r\nand regret that crowned the tragedy of his career.\r\n\r\nHis death brought new life and hopes to the Hapsburg peoples. The\r\nnew sovereign, Leopold II, his brother, soon proved to be one of the\r\nastutest rulers of that race. He has been termed the only ruler of\r\nthat age who correctly read the signs of the times.[845] If Joseph\r\nwas called the crowned philosopher, Leopold may be styled the crowned\r\ndiplomatist. Where the former gave the rein to the impulses of\r\nVoltairian philosophy and romantic idealism, his successor surveyed\r\naffairs with a calculating prudence which resulted, perhaps, from\r\nthe patriarchal size of his family--he had twelve children--and from\r\nhis long rule in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.[846] Certainly he knew\r\nhow impossible it was to thrust advanced Liberal ideas and central\r\ninstitutions on the tough and unenlightened peoples of the Hapsburg\r\nrealm. Above all he discerned the folly of aggressive foreign policy\r\nwhile all was turmoil at home. He therefore prepared to pacify his\r\nsubjects before the war cloud hanging over the Riesengebirge burst upon\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\nHis caution and pliability opened up a new future for Central Europe.\r\nHad the headstrong and pertinacious Joseph lived much longer (though\r\nsome gleams of prudence lighted on him in his last months) revolts\r\ncould scarcely have been staved off in Hungary and the Low Countries,\r\nwhere even his belated concessions inspired distrust. Above all, he\r\ncould never have coped with the forceful policy of Prussia. There is\r\nlittle room for doubt that the continuance of his life would have\r\ninvolved the loss of the Belgic provinces, Galicia, and, perhaps, even\r\nBohemia. The Hohenzollerns would have leaped to heights of power that\r\nwould always challenge to conflict; and Europe, a prey to Revolution\r\nin the West, must have been torn at the heart by deadly strifes, both\r\ndynastic and racial.\r\n\r\nIn closing the sluices against the currents about to be let loose\r\nat Berlin, Pitt had latterly counted on the well-known prudence of\r\nLeopold of Tuscany. On 26th February, before the decease of Joseph was\r\nknown in London, the British Government stiffly opposed the Prussian\r\nplan of acknowledging the independence of the Austrian Netherlands.\r\nGreat Britain--so ran the despatch to Ewart, our envoy to Berlin--had\r\ncovenanted merely to prevent the Emperor making “an unrestrained use\r\nof the wealth and population” of those provinces, and to obviate the\r\npossibility of their going to swell the power of France. England (added\r\nPitt in a side note of his own) must counteract French intrigues in\r\nBrabant; but they were unofficial, and would probably fail.[847] He\r\ntherefore deprecated any action which must lead to a war with Austria;\r\nbut he offered to help Prussia in restoring the former state of\r\nthings in the Low Countries. Stress was then laid on “the necessity\r\nof enabling Sweden to defend herself by another campaign against\r\nRussia”; England would pay her part of the sum needed for the support\r\nof Gustavus, and would also secure the neutrality of Denmark; but war\r\nagainst Russia and Austria was denounced as altogether foreign to our\r\ncardinal principle of restoring the former condition of things. Pitt\r\nand Leeds closed their despatch with the following noteworthy words:\r\n\r\n    The commencement of hostilities against the Imperial Courts, either\r\n    indirectly by an immediate recognition of the Belgic Independence,\r\n    or directly by our joining in the measures of offensive operations\r\n    which Prussia may feel it her interest to adopt, would go beyond\r\n    the line which this country has uniformly laid down, and from which\r\n    it does not appear that the present circumstances should induce her\r\n    to depart. If either the joint representations of the Allies, or\r\n    the subsequent measures such as they have been here stated, should\r\n    be successful in bringing about a peace on the terms of the _status\r\n    quo_, this country would then be willing to include Turkey, Poland,\r\n    and Sweden in the alliance and to guarantee to them the terms of\r\n    that pacification.[848]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the importance of this pronouncement, we must\r\nremember that at this time the chances of success attending the\r\ndismembering schemes of the two Empires and those of Prussia were\r\ncuriously equal. In bulk Russia and Austria had the advantage. Their\r\narmies also seemed likely to drive the Turks over the Balkans in the\r\nnext campaign, unless potent diversions in the rear impaired their\r\nstriking power. But these diversions were imminent. The fate of the\r\nHapsburg dominions still hovered in the balance. Catharine was face to\r\nface with another Swedish campaign which her exhausted exchequer could\r\nscarcely meet. How then could these two Empires withstand the shock of\r\n200,000 trained Prussians, with the prospect that an Anglo-Dutch fleet\r\nwould sweep the Russian warships from the sea? And this was not all.\r\nHertzberg had already detached Poland from the Russian alliance and was\r\non the point of adding the resources of that kingdom to his own;[849]\r\nand the prospect of consolidating Poland, both politically and\r\ngeographically, opened up hopeful vistas for that interesting people\r\nand the whole European polity. Above all it promised to strengthen\r\nPrussia on her weakest flank.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the ambitious and enterprising Dietz\r\nexceeded his instructions by signing a treaty with the Porte on\r\n31st January 1790. He thereby pledged Prussia to make war on Russia\r\nand Austria in the spring, and not to lay down her arms until she\r\nsecured for the Sultan an “honourable and stable peace,” which assured\r\nsafety for Constantinople against an attack by sea. If the Turks were\r\nvictorious, Prussia promised to secure the Crimea for them. The Sultan,\r\non his side, promised to compel Austria to restore Galicia to the\r\nPoles, who were, if possible, to be brought into the Triple Alliance.\r\nFinally Prussia, England, Holland, Sweden, and Poland were to guarantee\r\nthe Turkish possessions as then defined.\r\n\r\nThese grandiose designs were furthered by the Prusso-Polish treaty,\r\nsigned at Warsaw on 29th March. By it Frederick William, in case of\r\nhostilities, would send 18,000 men to assist the Republic, which would\r\nsend 8,000 horsemen and half that number of footmen, or an equivalent\r\nin money or corn.[850] In case of great need the numbers of troops\r\nmight be raised to 30,000 and 20,000 respectively. More important than\r\nthis material succour was the advantage of marching through Polish\r\nVolhynia down the valley of the Dniester to cut the communications of\r\nthe Russian army on the lower Danube. Meanwhile the Poles would overrun\r\nGalicia, and the Prussians invade Bohemia and Moravia for the purpose\r\nof inciting the Czechs and Hungarians to open revolt. On the whole the\r\nchances of war favoured Frederick William and his Allies, especially\r\nwhen the British Government agreed to join with Prussia in subsidizing\r\nSweden for the campaign of 1790. The valour of the Swedes and their\r\nnearness to the Russian capital compelled Catharine to concentrate\r\nher efforts largely against them, and the prospect of a Prusso-Polish\r\nalliance aroused grave fears at Petersburg. “Everyone here wears a\r\nlook of consternation,” wrote the Prussian envoy to his Court on 5th\r\nFebruary. Probably this explains the passing flirtation of Catharine\r\nwith England, which Pitt seems to have taken at its true value, in view\r\nof the exorbitant terms previously offered by her to Gustavus.[851]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the air was charged with insincerity and intrigue. The\r\nPrussian alliance with the Poles, which might have brought salvation to\r\nthat distracted people, was accompanied with extremely hard conditions.\r\nHertzberg saw in it the opportunity of once more forcing on his scheme\r\nof gaining Danzig and Thorn in return for the halving of the Prussian\r\nduties on Polish trade down the Vistula. His Shylock-like insistence\r\non these terms deprived the compact of all worth from the outset; for\r\nthe Poles claimed, and with reason, that the cession of those valuable\r\ndistricts should be bought, not by the halving of certain customs dues,\r\nbut by the recovery of the whole of Galicia from Austria. In these\r\ndemands the Court of Berlin seemed to concur; but ultimately, as we\r\nshall see, it allowed them to be frittered away under pressure from\r\nVienna. As a result, the Poles felt no less distrust of Prussia than\r\nof the two Empires; and our envoy at Warsaw, Daniel Hailes, found that\r\nBritish policy alone inspired a feeling of confidence, and that a keen\r\ndesire prevailed for a close alliance with England.[852]\r\n\r\nPitt also, guided by our naval experts, who wished England to be\r\nfreed from dependence on Russia for naval stores, saw the advantage\r\nof a compact with Poland, provided her trade were freed from Prussian\r\nshackles. But his hands were so far tied by his alliance with Prussia,\r\nthat he supported her demand for Danzig (not Thorn), if it were\r\naccompanied by an enlightened commercial treaty in which England might\r\nhave a share. Events soon proved that greed rather than enlightenment\r\nprevailed at Berlin. That Court clung to its demand for Danzig and\r\nThorn, and its envoy at Warsaw, the subtle, scheming, and masterful\r\nLucchesini, more than once showed a disposition to hark back to the\r\npolicy of Frederick the Great, and to choke the disputes with Austria\r\nand Russia by a partition of Poland.[853]\r\n\r\nFor a time this seemed to be the natural upshot of an _entente_ which\r\nunexpectedly came about between Berlin and Vienna. Not long after\r\nhis accession Leopold wrote to his brother of Prussia in the terms\r\nof sensibility then in vogue. Frederick William answered in equally\r\neffusive strains; and but for the austere domination of the old\r\nChancellor, Kaunitz, at Vienna, and the “turbulent genius” of Hertzberg\r\nat Berlin, there seemed a faint hope of a reconciliation.[854] But\r\nKaunitz knew well how to keep up the bitterness against the upstart\r\nProtestant State; and Hertzberg had resolved to keep his master up to\r\nthe high level of his own ambitions. Ingeniously he sowed the seeds\r\nof discord between the Imperial Courts by suggesting that Catharine\r\nshould accept the mediation of the Allies with a view to a peace with\r\nthe Porte.[855] This would leave Austria at the mercy of Prussia, and\r\ninvolve the loss of Galicia and the Netherlands. This last topic lay\r\nnear to the heart of his Sovereign. Lord Auckland wrote thus on 19th\r\nMarch from his new Embassy at The Hague: “I have the fullest evidence\r\nthat nothing less than absolute and inevitable necessity will induce\r\nhim [Frederick William II] to contribute by word or deed to replacing\r\nthe Netherlands under their old Government.” And three weeks later he\r\nexpressed his astonishment that, in view of the widespread anarchy,\r\nPrussia and all Governments should not feel it their prime duty to\r\nrestore those ideas of order and just subordination to legal authority\r\nwhich the world so urgently needed. Otherwise the European fabric would\r\nbe sapped by French theories and succumb to a new series of barbarian\r\ninvasions.[856]\r\n\r\nThese were the views of Pitt, though he expressed them with less\r\nnervous vehemence. His aim, and that of his colleagues, was to bring\r\nAustria first, and afterwards Russia, to a pacification. They reminded\r\nthe Court of Berlin that Leopold had “neither the same predilection for\r\nRussia, the same jealousy of Prussia, [n]or dislike to the mediation of\r\nEngland” as Joseph had displayed, and that the _status quo_ might now\r\nfind favour at Vienna. Leopold, they added, could not possibly accept\r\nthe last proposal of Hertzberg, of ceding Galicia to the Poles on\r\ncondition of being allowed to regain the Netherlands.[857] The British\r\nCabinet also, on 30th March, charged Keith to press for an immediate\r\narmistice between Austria and Turkey, with a view to summoning a\r\nCongress of the Powers for a general pacification, which Great Britain\r\nearnestly desired. But, they added, with a touch of guile, as it would\r\ntake much longer to communicate with St. Petersburg, they hoped that\r\nAustria would act alone, and immediately grant an armistice to the\r\nTurks. If Austria would further pledge herself to admit the restoration\r\nof the old constitution in the Netherlands, Keith might accept this as\r\nsatisfactory, and send off a courier to Constantinople to warn Ainslie\r\nto bring the Porte to reason.[858]\r\n\r\nThe aim of saving Austria from many dangers is here so obvious that\r\none learns with astonishment that Kaunitz received these offers most\r\nhaughtily. The belated concessions granted by Joseph on his death-bed\r\nto his malcontent subjects had met with his approval, but only, as it\r\nseems, in order to press on the war with Turkey _à outrance_, as if\r\nthat, and that alone, would impose on the Court of Berlin. With senile\r\nobstinacy and old-world _hauteur_, he repulsed Keith, who thereupon\r\nexecuted a skilful flanking move by appealing to the Vice-Chancellor,\r\nCount Cobenzl. This astute diplomat saw the gain that might accrue\r\nfrom the British proposals, and assured Keith that his Sovereign had\r\nreceived them with “very great satisfaction.” Seeing his advantage,\r\nthe British envoy warned Cobenzl against the extravagant claims of\r\nPotemkin, and urged him to work hard for a separate armistice with\r\nTurkey, now that “the most upright Court in Europe” offered its good\r\nservices for that purpose. He further hinted that the recent treaties\r\nof Prussia with Turkey and Poland were a serious menace to Austria, and\r\nthat the British proposal now made to her was “pointed and peremptory.”\r\nFinally they agreed that Kaunitz should so far be humoured as to draft\r\nthe official reply, but that Cobenzl should be its interpreter on\r\nbehalf of Leopold II. With this odd arrangement Keith had to put up\r\nfor some weeks; and in that time the desire for peace grew apace at\r\nVienna.[859]\r\n\r\nAny other way of looking at things was sheer madness. The ablest of\r\nAustrian Generals, Marshal Laudon, warned Leopold of the terrible risks\r\nof a war against both Prussia and Turkey. The Aulic Council also knew\r\nfull well that the almost unbounded influence of Prince Potemkin over\r\nthe Czarina was ever used against Hapsburg interests, that pampered\r\nfavourite having sworn vengeance against all who promoted the erection\r\nof Moldavia and Wallachia, which he coveted for himself,[860] into an\r\nindependent principality. This scheme, so fatal to Hapsburg hopes,\r\nplayed no small part in sundering the two Empires. While, therefore,\r\nLeopold armed, as if for war with Prussia, he was secretly disposed to\r\ntreat for a separate peace with the Turks if they would cede to him the\r\nlimits of the Peace of Passarowitz, namely, North Servia and Wallachia\r\nas far east as the River Aluta. On the other hand he was resolved (so\r\nhe told Keith on 9th May) to fight rather than lose the Netherlands,\r\nand in that case intended to gain the alliance of France by a few\r\ncessions of Belgian land. Still he hoped for a peaceful settlement\r\nthrough “the wise and kind intervention of England.”[861]\r\n\r\nThe position was now somewhat as follows: Leopold had staved off a\r\ngeneral revolt in his dominions by soothing concessions or promises,\r\nbut he insisted on the continuance of hostilities against Turkey in\r\norder, as he said, to predispose her to peace. To the Brabanters and\r\nFlemings he granted an armistice, but seemed about to send forces\r\nthither as if for the restoration of unlimited power. Meanwhile Sweden\r\nand Turkey continued the unequal fight against Russia, and the Triple\r\nAlliance imposed prudence on Denmark. In this uneasy equipoise England\r\noffered her mediation, not only to the belligerents--Russia, Austria,\r\nTurkey, and Sweden--but also to Prussia, with a view to a general\r\narmistice for the discussion of a settlement.[862]\r\n\r\nNowhere did this proposal meet with a cooler reception than at Berlin.\r\nAccordingly, on 21st May, Pitt and Leeds justified their conduct in a\r\ndespatch to Ewart, in which the hand of the Prime Minister is plainly\r\nvisible. He declared his earnest desire for the joint intervention of\r\nthe three Allies, but explained that it was possible only by adhering\r\nto “that system of moderation to which he [His Majesty] has uniformly\r\nendeavoured to adhere.” England desired to see the power of Sweden and\r\nTurkey maintained, and would secretly advance a subsidy to Gustavus,\r\nbut did not feel justified in going to war with the two Empires. If\r\nPrussia drew the sword, England would not only keep France and Denmark\r\nquiet, but would also prevent the march of Austrian troops to the\r\nNetherlands during the armistice there. The earnest hope was expressed\r\nthat Prussia would give up the Galician project, and limit her gains\r\nto the restoration of the former boundaries, with a few reasonable\r\nchanges. Nothing was further from the wish of England than to sacrifice\r\nthe interests of Prussia to those of Austria.[863]\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that Pitt and Leeds were prepared to meet the Court\r\nof Berlin half way. On receiving the curt refusal of Catharine to the\r\nBritish offer of mediation, they admitted that the Prussian plan of\r\nexchanges of territory was not objectionable in itself, if Austria\r\nagreed to it--a large assumption. The arrangement might be that Russia\r\nshould retain the Crimea and all her present conquests up to the\r\nDniester, that is, inclusive of Oczakoff. In that case she must restore\r\nto Sweden the wider Finnish limits of the Peace of Nystadt. As for\r\nAustria, she should gain North Servia and West Wallachia as far as the\r\nRiver Aluta--the Passarowitz limits; and she ought to retain the whole\r\nof Galicia except the districts about Brody, Belez, and Cracow. As a\r\nreward for these services to Poland, Prussia would gain her heart’s\r\ndesire--Danzig, Thorn, and the Wartha territory. These would be “not\r\nsacrifices, but exchanges of territory.”[864]\r\n\r\nThe British Cabinet would clearly have preferred the _status quo_; but\r\nin this alternative scheme it sketched arrangements highly favourable\r\nto Prussia, Austria, Russia, and Sweden, less so to Poland, but wholly\r\nunfavourable to the Turks. Certainly it corresponded more nearly to\r\nthe actual or probable fortune of war, the prospects of the Moslems\r\nbeing at this time gloomy, those of the Swedes doubtful, but those of\r\nPrussia brilliant. The Sultan, it was hinted, might be soothed by the\r\nguarantee of his possessions and the hope of admission to the Triple\r\nAlliance along with Sweden and Poland.[865] This curious despatch shows\r\nthat Pitt and Leeds cared little about Turkey, and that their adhesion\r\nto the _status quo_ was conditioned by a politic opportunism.\r\n\r\nA sudden and perplexing change now came over Hapsburg policy. Possibly\r\nLeopold relied on the wheedling assurances of support received from\r\nCatharine. Certain it is that in the middle of June he demanded\r\n“indemnities” for the proposed gains to Poland and Prussia; and his\r\nhaughty tone was not lowered by the news of a sharp defeat inflicted\r\nby the Turkish garrison of Giurgevo on the Austrian besiegers. Bared\r\nto the waist, and armed with sword and dagger, they suddenly burst\r\nfrom the gates in three uncontrollable torrents, which swept the\r\nImperialists out of trenches and camp, and far on to the plain. In\r\nvain also did Keith warn Cobenzl not to rely on Russia. The Hapsburgs\r\nnow seemed bent on dismembering Turkey and defying their northern\r\nneighbours.[866] At the end of June Leopold declared his resolve not to\r\ntreat with the rebels in the Netherlands, and to denounce the armistice\r\nwith them. Probably this threatening tone was a screen to hide the\r\nweakness of Austria’s position. On all sides her enemies held her fast.\r\nThe Hungarians and Flemings firmly demanded their ancient rights; and\r\npersistence in the game of bluff must have led to the break up of her\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nAnother curious change also came over the scene on the arrival of\r\nnews at Berlin that Potemkin had offered to restore to the Porte all\r\nthe Russian conquests of the present war, on condition of peace. This\r\nsudden adoption of the _rôle_ of peacemaker by that ambitious and\r\nmasterful favourite has never been fully explained.[867] It may have\r\nbeen due either to Turkish bribes or to a crafty resolve to checkmate\r\nHertzberg’s scheme of making Turkey pay for Prussia’s gains. For how\r\ncould the professed friend and ally impose on the Porte sacrifices far\r\ngreater than those demanded by the enemy? The report that Leopold was\r\ndisposed to accept the _status quo_, finding it far less objectionable\r\nthan Hertzberg’s plan of exchanges, also gave food for thought.\r\nAccordingly, Frederick William, before opening negotiations with\r\nAustria, decided that this should form the general basis, but with\r\ncertain modifications. The Turks were to be warned that, as Prussia’s\r\narmaments had saved them from destruction, they would now do well to\r\nconclude an armistice with Austria and hope for admission to the Triple\r\nAlliance. They should also humour their preserver by giving up Western\r\nWallachia to Austria, so that she in her turn might cede the outer\r\ndistricts of Galicia to the Poles, who of course would yield to Prussia\r\nher reward for these troublesome bargainings. As for Great Britain, she\r\nwas expected to favour these scientific readjustments because the trade\r\nof the Vistula would then be freed from obstacles, and be opened to\r\nher by favourable commercial treaties. Such was Hertzberg’s final plan\r\nfor the preservation of the _status quo_.[868] In order to secure the\r\nacquiescence of the Turks, he had long kept the Porte on tenter-hooks\r\nby delaying the ratification of Dietz’s treaty, and by ordering the\r\nrecall of that masterful envoy. On the other hand, the Turks were left\r\nwith a glimmer of hope of eventual assistance from Berlin.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Prussian policy seemed about to win a brilliant triumph at\r\nthe proposed Conference of Reichenbach, where the Triple Alliance and\r\nAustria (Russia having refused Britain’s mediation) were to thrash out\r\nthese questions; and nothing is more curious than to watch the collapse\r\nof Hertzberg’s ingenious web. In order at the outset to settle matters\r\nseparately with the Austrian envoy, Spielmann, the King of Prussia\r\nheld Ewart aloof because the British Ambassador consistently warned\r\nHertzberg against the complicated exchanges projected by him. Thereupon\r\nEwart drew up a Memorial insisting that England must be a principal\r\nparty, and that, as both Austria and Prussia had promised to admit the\r\n_status quo_ as the basis of negotiation, the latter could not make\r\nwar on the former if she consented to it. In that case, or even if he\r\n(Ewart) were excluded from the Conference, Great Britain must cancel\r\nher engagements to Prussia. He further declared his conviction that\r\nAustria would retract her extreme claims and listen to reason.[869]\r\n\r\nThis sharp protest had some effect on Hertzberg; but the chief\r\ndifficulty was now with Frederick William. At the head of his\r\nsplendid army, he seemed to court war. He sent a courier to the Porte\r\nto ratify Dietz’s treaty; and he cut off all communications with\r\nAustria as though hostilities had begun. At the first three sessions\r\nof the Conference (27th-29th June) the Austrian and Prussian envoys\r\nindulged in eager but vague wrangling; but the arrival of news from\r\nConstantinople that the Turks would never concede the Prussian demands\r\nsufficed to depress the bellicose ardour of the monarch. As there was\r\na serious risk of the Porte coming to terms with Russia and Austria,\r\nhe now harked back towards the _status quo_. This move, which the Duke\r\nof Brunswick and Möllendorf heartily supported, gathered strength when\r\nit appeared that Poland would accept none of Hertzberg’s benefits. The\r\narrival of the British note of 2nd July to the same general effect\r\nended the last efforts of Frederick William for Danzig and Thorn.[870]\r\nHe now gave Hertzberg written orders to abandon at once the whole\r\nscheme of exchanges “since it could only serve to commit him with Great\r\nBritain as well as with the Porte and Poland.” Whence it appears that\r\nHertzberg’s scientific and philanthropic plans fell through simply\r\nbecause all the States concerned utterly repudiated them.\r\n\r\nThe renunciation, however, was made not unskilfully. The Prussian and\r\nBritish Ministers were careful to keep secret Hertzberg’s change of\r\nfront and thus prepared a surprise for Spielmann. That envoy having\r\nput forward some equally untenable schemes of aggrandisement, Ewart\r\nrose and read out a Memorial, drawn up in concert with his Prussian and\r\nDutch colleagues, demanding an exact restitution of the old boundaries.\r\nIn vain did the Hapsburg Minister seek to wriggle out of the dilemma by\r\nbetraying Prussia into glaring inconsistency. Prussia stood firm; and\r\nfinally he reduced his demands to Orsova and district. Even this cold\r\ncomfort was denied him. The Triple Alliance was inexorable. Thereupon\r\nhe demanded the dissolution of Prussia’s compacts with Turkey and\r\nSweden, only to meet with the reply that the Austro-Russian alliance\r\nmust first be annulled.[871] Thus Hertzberg, even in the hour of\r\npersonal defeat, brought down the Hapsburg schemes in utter collapse;\r\nand the result of the discussions at Reichenbach was the recurrence to\r\nthe _status quo_--the very same arrangement which Pitt and Leeds had\r\nthroughout declared to be the best of all solutions.\r\n\r\nHertzberg’s annoyance at the destruction of his pet plans must have\r\ndiminished when he heard from Vienna that Austria had secretly\r\nempowered Potemkin to make her peace with the Turks on that same\r\nbasis. If this be true, each of the rivals was playing a game of bluff\r\nat Reichenbach; and the sight of the two Ancient Pistols eating the\r\nleek in turn must have filled Ewart with a joy such as falls to few\r\ndiplomatists. Even as regards the Belgians, the British suggestion\r\nheld good. They were to regain their ancient constitution together\r\nwith an amnesty for past offences, and a guarantee by the three Allied\r\nPowers.[872] Frederick William, in complimenting Hertzberg on the end\r\nof the negotiations at Reichenbach, added that they must now assure\r\nthemselves, through Ewart, of England’s support in imposing the _status\r\nquo_ on Russia.[873] A new chapter in the relations of the Powers and\r\nin the career of Pitt lay enfolded in this suggestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after this happy ending to the disputes in Central Europe\r\ncame the news of a settlement of the war in the Baltic. Once again\r\nGustavus III startled the world. After his sudden and furious attack\r\non Catharine, and her no less fierce counter stroke, it seemed that\r\nthe struggle must be mortal. But many circumstances occurred to allay\r\ntheir hatred. The aims of the Czarina had always trended southwards;\r\nand the war in Finland was ultimately regarded chiefly as an annoying\r\ndiversion from the crusade against the Turks. Moreover the valour of\r\nthe Swedes, who closed the doubtful campaign of 1790 with a decided\r\nsuccess at sea, added to the difficulties of campaigning in Finland,\r\nleft little hope of conquest in that quarter so long as the Triple\r\nAlliance kept the Danes quiet and subsidized Gustavus. Catharine was\r\nin fact fighting against the forces of nature and the resources of\r\nEngland, Prussia, and Holland. Gustavus, too, even in the year 1789\r\nfelt the sobering influences of poverty. In 1790 they threatened him\r\nwith bankruptcy, and at that same time the outlook was far from bright\r\nin Finland. Fortunately, the Russians were not in a position to press\r\nGustavus hard. But nothing could stave off the advent of bankruptcy\r\nunless the Allies promptly advanced a considerable sum. This they were\r\nnot prepared to do, for his unceasing importunities had wearied them\r\nout. The Dutch declined to help in a matter which concerned them but\r\nlittle, and after long negotiations at Stockholm Great Britain and\r\nPrussia agreed on 31st July to advance £200,000, or only two-thirds of\r\nthe minimum named by the King. By the month of August 1790 the treasury\r\nat Stockholm was absolutely empty, so our envoy, Liston, reported.\r\n\r\nWhile Gustavus was chafing at the restraints of poverty, Catharine\r\nheld out to him alluring hopes. So soon as she heard of the turn which\r\naffairs were taking at Reichenbach she resolved to end her quarrel\r\nwith him in order the better to browbeat Prussia and England. Leopold\r\nhad early informed her of his resolve to conclude the Turkish war,\r\nin accordance with the demands of the Allies; and he also warned her\r\nof their intention to deprive Russia of her chief conquest. With a\r\nquickness of insight and a magnanimous resolve instinct with the\r\nhighest statesmanship, she resolved to end the war in the Baltic by\r\noffers which would appeal irresistibly to a knight-errant struggling\r\nwith debts and worries. She therefore despatched a courier to him in\r\nFinland, holding out virtually the same terms which the Allies had\r\nguaranteed to him.\r\n\r\nGustavus did not long hesitate. It is true that he had the promise of\r\nseventeen British battleships, which were in the Downs ready to sail\r\nto his succour; Prussia also had already sent one half of the subsidy\r\nwhich he demanded; and he had pledged his troth to the Allies not to\r\nmake a separate peace with Russia. That step, however, he now decided\r\nto take; and the impression afterwards prevailed at London and Berlin,\r\nthat Russian money had some influence on his decision.[874] However\r\nthat may be, he sent Baron Armfelt to treat for peace. Where both\r\nsides were bent on a speedy settlement, difficulties vanished; and\r\nthus on 14th August 1790, the Peace of Werela was signed. It restored\r\nthe few gains of territory which the belligerents had made, and gave\r\npermission to the Swedes to buy grain in Russian ports. The treaty\r\nwas remarkable chiefly for its omissions. No mention was made of\r\nprevious Russo-Swedish treaties, which gave the Empire some right to\r\ninterfere in Swedish affairs. As Liston pointed out, the absence of any\r\nsuch claim was a personal victory for Gustavus; for it increased his\r\nauthority and depressed that of the Russophile nobles. The King at once\r\nasserted his prerogative by condemning to death, despite the entreaties\r\nof Liston, the ringleader of the mutiny in Finland and by incarcerating\r\ntwo others for life.[875] Events were to show that the faction was\r\ncowed but not wholly crushed. The bullet of Ankerström repaid the debt\r\nof vengeance stored up in September 1790.\r\n\r\nEqually strange was the abandonment of the Turks by their headstrong\r\nally. Gustavus had gone to war ostensibly in order to prevent their\r\noverthrow, and now he left them at the mercy of Catharine. It is true\r\nthat the signature of the Reichenbach Convention three weeks earlier\r\nended their conflict with Austria; but the indignation of the Sultan,\r\nthe wrath of the King of Prussia, and the quiet contempt of Pitt\r\nmanifested the general feeling of the time.[876] Gustavus had salved\r\nhis conscience by requiring Catharine to accord lenient treatment to\r\nthe Moslems. The Czarina was quite ready to make any promises to this\r\neffect, if they formed no part of the treaty with Sweden. She assured\r\nGustavus of her desire to renew the Treaty of Kainardji rather than\r\ncontinue the war; and Gustavus decided, so he informed Liston, “to\r\ntrust to the elevated and honourable character of the Empress” on this\r\npoint. Liston had his doubts. He ventured to express his surprise at\r\nthe generosity of the imperial promises, which implied the restoration\r\nof the Crimea to Turkey, and he remarked that the combined pressure\r\nof Great Britain and Prussia had not availed to extort so great a\r\nboon. Gustavus, however, persisted in his estimate of the character of\r\nCatharine, doubtless because she humoured his latest plan, a crusade\r\nto Paris on behalf of the French monarchy, while she further promised\r\nhim the sum of 2,000,000 roubles for his immediate needs.[877] She,\r\ntoo, sang loudly the praises of the man whom she had sworn to ruin. The\r\ncause of this new-born enthusiasm will appear in due course.\r\n\r\nFrom the Swedish point of view much might be said for the action of\r\nGustavus. He had rid himself and his land from the irksome tutelage of\r\nRussia: he came out of the war with no loss of territory, the first\r\nRusso-Swedish war of the century of which this can be said; his martial\r\nenergy had inspirited his people; and he had overthrown a corrupt and\r\nunpatriotic aristocracy. But, from the standpoint which he took up\r\nat the outset of the war, his conduct had proved him a shifty ally,\r\nwho merited the suspicion of his former comrades. Nevertheless he had\r\nplayed no small part in checking the subversive schemes of Catharine\r\nand Joseph. Thanks to him the Moslems maintained a struggle which\r\ngave time for the army of Prussia and the diplomacy of Pitt to exert\r\nthemselves with effect. Had he stood by his promises, the Triple\r\nAlliance would probably have brought Russia to terms favourable to the\r\ninterests both of Turkey and of Poland.\r\n\r\nEven as matters stood at the end of that year of turmoil, 1790,\r\nPitt might reflect with something of pride that his efforts had\r\ndecisively made for peace and stability. He it was who had been\r\nmainly instrumental in saving Sweden from ruin, the Hapsburg States\r\nfrom partition, and Prussia from Hertzberg’s policy of exchange and\r\nadventure. Moreover, at that same time British policy won another\r\nsuccess at a point which has always been deemed essential to the\r\nmaintenance of equilibrium in Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe recovery of his authority in the Belgic provinces lay near the\r\nheart of Leopold II. His letters and those of Kaunitz show that he\r\nconsented to patch matters up at Reichenbach largely in order that he\r\nmight be free to subdue Brabant and Flanders. True, he admitted the\r\nmediation of the Triple Alliance in those affairs; but his missive to\r\nCatharine shows that he acquiesced in that convention only in order to\r\nprevent the disruption of his dominions, and that he hoped to evade\r\nsome at least of its provisions by means of an “eternal alliance” with\r\nRussia. As will appear in a later chapter, fidelity to Russia involved\r\na policy of procrastination and trickery towards Turkey, Prussia,\r\nEngland, and the Belgians. The conduct of Austria in the Eastern\r\nQuestion helped to checkmate Pitt and secure a diplomatic triumph for\r\nCatharine in the year 1791.\r\n\r\nHere we may notice that Leopold and Kaunitz, so soon as the threat\r\nof war from the Prussian side passed away, and their own troops in\r\nLuxemburg were reinforced, took a stern tone with the men of Brabant\r\nand Flanders. At the Conference held at The Hague for the settlement\r\nof those affairs, the Austrian envoy, Count Mercy, refused to extend\r\nthe time of the armistice in those provinces, and warned the three\r\nmediating Powers that their services would no longer be recognized\r\nby the Viennese Court. Austrian troops also began to march towards\r\nBrussels. Thereupon Lord Auckland hotly protested against this\r\nhigh-handed proceeding; and the British Cabinet threatened to send a\r\nlarge fleet to co-operate with the Prussians and Dutch in preventing\r\nthe re-conquest of Belgic lands by Leopold.[878] This threat,\r\nformidable in view of the large armament kept up by England, even after\r\nthe end of the Spanish dispute, emanated largely from Pitt himself. For\r\nEwart, who was then in London on furlough, wrote to Auckland on 28th\r\nNovember 1790 concerning the opinions of Ministers:\r\n\r\n    Some difference of opinion existed; but I trust Mr. Pitt will write\r\n    to your lordship himself in a satisfactory manner; and you know\r\n    better than I do of what consequence the opinions of others are. I\r\n    confess I am very uneasy about the explosion this affair must have\r\n    produced at Berlin; but I trust the explanations sent from hence\r\n    will have given satisfaction both there and with you on the great\r\n    principle of making the Emperor adhere--_bon gré_, _mal gré_--to\r\n    his engagements for re-establishing the [Belgic] Constitution: and\r\n    it appears impossible he should venture in his present situation to\r\n    risk the consequences of a refusal.[879]\r\n\r\nPitt’s firmness won the day. Leopold shrank from a contest with the\r\nAllies, and consented to a convention which was signed on 10th December\r\nat The Hague. The ancient customs and privileges of the Pays Bas were\r\nto be restored (including those of the University of Louvain and the\r\nCatholic seminaries), and an amnesty granted to all concerned in the\r\nrecent revolt. Leopold promised never to apply the conscription to his\r\nBelgian subjects, and he recognized the guarantee of Great Britain,\r\nPrussia, and Holland for the present arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of Pitt at this turn of affairs appeared in the order\r\nto place the British navy on a peace footing--a measure which we can\r\nnow see to have been premature, in that it encouraged Catharine to\r\nreject the demands of the Allies, and Leopold to display the duplicity\r\nwhich often marred his actions. The failure of Pitt to coerce the\r\nCzarina will engage our attention later; but we may note here that, on\r\nvarious pretexts, Leopold refused to ratify the Hague Convention, and\r\nleft Belgian affairs in a state which earned the hatred of that people\r\nand the suspicion of British statesmen.[880]\r\n\r\nFor the present, as the shiftiness of Leopold and the defiance of\r\nCatharine could not be surmised, there seemed to be scarcely a cloud\r\non the political horizon. By the end of the year 1790, the policy of\r\nPitt, cautious at the beginning of a crisis, firm during its growth,\r\nand drastic at the climax, had raised Great Britain to a state of\r\nprosperity and power which contrasted sharply with the unending turmoil\r\nin France, the helplessness of Spain, the confusion in the Hapsburg\r\nStates, and the sharp financial strain in Russia. In truth, the end\r\nof the year 1790 marks the zenith of Pitt’s career. In seven years,\r\ncrowded with complex questions, he had won his way to an eminence\r\nwhence he could look down on rivals, both internal and external,\r\ngroping their way doubtfully and deviously.\r\n\r\nOf these triumphs, those gained over foreign Powers were by far the\r\nmost important, except in the eyes of those who look at British history\r\nfrom the point of view of party strife. To them the events of this\r\nfascinating period will be merely a confused background to the duel\r\nbetween Pitt and Fox. Those, however, who love to probe the very heart\r\nof events, and to pry into the hidden springs of great movements, which\r\nuplift one nation and depress another, will not soon tire even of the\r\ndry details of diplomacy, when they are seen to be the gauge of human\r\nwisdom and folly, of national greatness and decline.\r\n\r\nIn the seven years now under survey, England emerged from defeat,\r\nisolation, and discredit which bordered on bankruptcy, until she soared\r\naloft to a position of prestige in the diplomatic and mercantile\r\nspheres which earned the envy of her formerly triumphant rivals. Strong\r\nin herself, and strengthened by the alliance of Prussia and Holland,\r\nshe had to all appearance assured the future of the Continent in a\r\nway that made for peace and quietness. Pitt had helped to compose the\r\nstrifes resulting from the reckless innovations of Joseph II, strifes\r\nwhich, had Hertzberg succeeded, must have led to a general war. The\r\nimportance of this work of pacification has escaped notice amidst the\r\ndramatic incidents of the Revolution and Napoleonic Era. For in the\r\npanorama of history, as in its daily diorama, it is the destructive and\r\nsensational which rivets attention, too often to the exclusion of the\r\nhealing and upbuilding efforts on which the future of the race depends.\r\nA more searching inquiry, a more faithful description, will reveal the\r\ntruth, that a statesman attains a higher success when he averts war\r\nthan when he wages a triumphant war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n    A disposition to preserve, and an ability to improve, taken\r\n    together, would be my standard of a statesman. Everything else\r\n    is vulgar in the conception, perilous in the execution.--BURKE,\r\n    _Reflections on the French Revolution_.\r\n\r\n    Ideas rule the world and its events. A Revolution is the passage of\r\n    an idea from theory to practice.--MAZZINI, _The French Revolution\r\n    of 1789_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the career of Pitt is divided into two very diverse portions by\r\nthe French Revolution is almost a commonplace. Macaulay in artful\r\nantitheses has pointed the contrast between the earlier and the later\r\nPitt; poets, who lacked his art but abounded in gall, descanted on the\r\nperversion of the friend of liberty into the reactionary tyrant; and\r\nJacobins hissed out his name as that of “the enemy of the human race.”\r\n\r\nIf we carefully study the attitude of Pitt towards the French\r\nRevolution, we shall find it to be far from inflexible. It changed with\r\nchanging events. It was not that of a doctrinaire but of a practical\r\nstatesman, who judges things by their outcome. He has often been blamed\r\nfor looking at this great movement too much from the standpoint of a\r\nfinancier; and the charge is perhaps tenable as regards the years of\r\nthe Jacobin ascendancy, when the flame kindled by Rousseau shrivelled\r\nup the old order of things. But the ideas prevalent in 1793 differed\r\nutterly from those of 1789, which aimed at reforms of a markedly\r\npractical character.\r\n\r\nThere was urgent need of them. As is well known, the unprivileged\r\nclasses of France were entangled in a network of abuses, social,\r\nfiscal, and agrarian, from which the nobles had refused to set them\r\nfree. Despite the goodwill of Louis XVI, the well-meant efforts of\r\nhis chief minister, Necker, and the benevolent attempts of many of\r\nthe clergy and some nobles, the meshes of Feudalism and the absolute\r\nmonarchy lay heavily on the land up to the time of the Assembly of the\r\nStates-General at Versailles in May 1789. It is of course a gross\r\nerror to assume that the French peasants were more oppressed than those\r\nof other continental lands. Their lot was more favoured than that\r\nof the peasantry of Spain, South Italy, Prussia, and most parts of\r\nGermany, to say nothing of the brutish condition of the serfs of Poland\r\nand Russia.[881] Those of France were more prosperous than Arthur Young\r\nbelieved them to be. They kept on buying up plot after plot in ways\r\nthat illustrate the ceaseless land-hunger of the Celt and his elusive\r\nstubbornness.\r\n\r\nBut he would be a shallow reasoner who argued that, because the poverty\r\nof the French peasants was less grinding than it appeared, therefore\r\nthe old agrarian and fiscal customs were tolerable. The most brilliant\r\ndisplay of what Carlyle called “tongue-fencing” cannot justify a system\r\nwhich compels millions of men to live behind a perpetual screen of\r\nmisery. To notice the case of that worthy peasant whose hospitality\r\nwas sought by Rousseau during his first weary tramp to Paris. The\r\nman gave him only the coarsest food until he felt sure of his being\r\na friend of the people and no spy. Then wine, ham, and an omelette\r\nwere forthcoming, and Jacques Bonhomme opened his heart. “He gave me\r\nto understand,” said Rousseau, “that he hid his wine on account of\r\nthe duties, and his bread on account of the tax; and that he would be\r\na lost man if he did not lead people to suppose that he was dying of\r\nhunger. All that he told me about this subject--of which previously I\r\nhad not had the slightest idea--made an impression upon me which will\r\nnever be effaced. There was the germ of that inextinguishable hatred\r\nwhich developed later in my heart against the vexations endured by\r\nthe poor, and against their oppressors.”[882] Multiply the case of\r\nthat hospitable peasant a million times over, and the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution becomes a foregone conclusion. The only surprising thing is\r\nthat the _débâcle_ did not come far earlier.\r\n\r\nBut the old order rarely breaks up until the vernal impulses of hope\r\nbegin potently to work. These forces were set in motion, firstly, by\r\nthe speculations of philosophers, the criticisms of economists and\r\nthe social millennium glowingly sketched by Rousseau. Ideas which\r\nmight have been confined to the study, were spread to the street by\r\nthe French soldiers who had fought side by side with the soldiers of\r\nWashington, and became on their return the most telling pleaders for\r\nreform. Thus, by a fatal ricochet, the bolt launched by the Bourbons at\r\nEngland’s Colonial Empire, glanced off and wrecked their own fabric.\r\n\r\nThe results, however, came slowly. It is often assumed that the\r\ndestructive teachings of the Encyclopaedists, the blighting raillery of\r\nVoltaire, and the alluring Utopia of Rousseau would by themselves have\r\nbeen the ruin of that outworn social order. But it is certain that no\r\none in France or England, up to the eve of the Revolution, anticipated\r\na general overturn. Ultimately, no doubt, ideas rule the world; but\r\ntheir advent to power is gradual, unless the champions of the old order\r\nallow decay to spread. Furthermore, constructors of ingenious theories\r\nabout the French Revolution generally forget that nearly all the ideas\r\ngiven to the world by Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau, were derived\r\nfrom the works of Hobbes, Locke, and Bolingbroke. The sage of Ferney\r\ndrew his arrows from the quiver of English philosophy, and merely\r\nadded the barbs of his own satire; Montesquieu pleaded on behalf of\r\na balance of political powers like that of England; and all that was\r\nmost effective in the “Social Contract” of the Genevese thinker came\r\nfrom Hobbes and Locke. The _verve_ of Frenchmen gave to these ideas an\r\napplication far wider than that which they had gained in their island\r\nhome. Here the teachings of Locke formed a prim parterre around the\r\npalace of the King, the heir to the glorious Revolution of 1688. When\r\ntransferred to that political forcing-bed, France, they shot up in\r\nbaleful harvests.\r\n\r\nIt is the seed-bed which counts as well as the seed. The harmlessness\r\nof philosophic speculation in England and its destructive activity in\r\nFrance may be explained ultimately by the condition of the two lands.\r\nIn the Island State able Ministers succeeded in popularizing an alien\r\ndynasty and promoting the well-being of the people. Retrenchment and\r\nReform were not merely topics of conversation in _salons_; they were\r\ncarried out in many parts of the administration. This was specially\r\nthe case after the peace of 1783, which left France victorious and\r\nEngland prostrate. There the fruits of victory were not garnered;\r\nand the political fabric, strained by the war, was not underpinned.\r\nThinking men talked of repair, but, thanks to the weakness of the King\r\nand the favouritism of the Queen, nothing was done. Here the ablest\r\nconstructive statesman since the time of Cromwell set about the needed\r\nrepairs; and his work, be it remembered, coincided with the joyous\r\nexperiments of the Court of Versailles to maintain credit by a display\r\nof luxury. The steady recovery of England and the swift decline of\r\nFrance may be ascribed in large measure to Pitt and Calonne.\r\n\r\nIt was against definite and curable ills in the body politic that the\r\nFrench reformers at first directed their efforts. In May–June 1789 the\r\nideals of Rousseau remained wholly in the background. The Nobles and\r\nClergy (as appears in their _cahiers_, or instructions) were, with few\r\nexceptions, ready to give up the immunities from taxation to which they\r\nhad too long clung. Those of the Tiers Etat, or Commons, laid stress on\r\nfair taxation, on the abolition of the cramping customs of Feudalism,\r\nwhether social, agrarian, or judicial, on the mitigation of service in\r\nthe militia, while some even demanded better lighting of the streets.\r\nThe Nobles and Clergy asked for a limitation of the powers of the\r\nCrown; and the Commons desired a constitution; but it was to resemble\r\nthat of England, save that larger powers were left to the King, the\r\nMinisters being responsible to him alone. Few of the _cahiers_ of the\r\nCommons asked for a fusion of the three Orders in one Assembly; and not\r\none breathed the thought of a Republic.[883] Their bugbear was the game\r\nlaws, not the monarchy; the _taille à miséricorde_ and the _corvées_,\r\nnot the Nobles; the burdensome tithes, not the Church.\r\n\r\nAs at Paris and Versailles, so among the peasants. At first, even in\r\ntroublous Franche Comté, their thoughts did not soar beyond taxes and\r\nfeudal burdens. Arthur Young calmed a demonstration against himself by\r\ntelling excited patriots near Besançon of the differences between taxes\r\nin England and France:\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen [he said] we have a great number of taxes in England\r\n    which you know nothing of in France; but the _tiers état_, the\r\n    poor, do not pay them, they are laid on the rich; every window in a\r\n    man’s house pays; but if he has no more than six windows, he pays\r\n    nothing; a Seigneur, with a great estate, pays the _vingtièmes_\r\n    and _taille_, but the little proprietor of a garden pays nothing;\r\n    the rich, for their horses, their carriages, their servants, and\r\n    even for liberty to kill their own partridges; but the poor farmer\r\n    nothing of all this; and what is more, we have in England a tax\r\n    paid by the rich for the relief of the poor.[884]\r\n\r\nWho would not sympathize with these people! They were staggering under\r\nburdens piled up by a monarchy absolute in name, but powerless in all\r\nthat made for reform and retrenchment. Where Louis XVI by his weakness,\r\nand the Queen by her caprice, had failed to right the wrong, the nation\r\nwas bent in succeeding; and it is highly probable that, if the King had\r\nshown more tact in dealing with the Commons, and they a little more\r\npatience, the popular movement might have progressed peacefully for\r\na decade, with wholly beneficent results. We, who know how one event\r\nled on to another, find it difficult to escape from the attractive but\r\nfallacious conclusion that the sequence was inevitable. The mind loves\r\nto forge connecting links, and then to conclude that the chain could\r\nnot have been made otherwise--a quite gratuitous assumption. At several\r\npoints it was the exceptional which happened. A perusal of the letters\r\nof intelligent onlookers shows that they foresaw, and most naturally,\r\na wholly different outcome of events. They looked to see a few drastic\r\nreforms, a time of unrest, and then the remodelling of the monarchy _à\r\nl’Anglaise_.\r\n\r\nAs for Pitt, he waited to see whither all this would tend. His attitude\r\ntowards France in the early part of 1789 was distinctly friendly. He\r\nassured the French ambassador, M. de Luzerne, that France and England\r\nhad the same principles, namely, not to aggrandize themselves and to\r\noppose aggrandizement in others, and he added that he hoped for the\r\nassistance of France to assist Sweden and Turkey against the powerful\r\nEmpires that were seeking their overthrow.\r\n\r\nThis declaration bespoke his fixed resolve to save Europe from the\r\nambitious schemes of the other monarchs; and, now that France accepted\r\nAnglo-Prussian ascendancy in Holland and abandoned her forward policy\r\nin the Orient, she might serve to redress the balance of power. Such\r\nviews were consonant with Pitt’s lofty aim of winning over “the natural\r\nenemy.” In truth, they were the outcome of common sense, even of\r\nself-interest. The suspicion and dislike were all on the side of the\r\nCourt of Versailles. Montmorin and Luzerne were haunted by the fear\r\nthat Pitt meant to pour oil on the smouldering discontent in France,\r\nand shrivel up the Bourbon power. There is not a shred of evidence\r\nthat he ever entertained these notions. That they were harboured\r\nat Versailles merely showed that a Power which has rent another in\r\ntwain cannot believe in the goodwill of the injured nation; and this\r\nsuspicion was one of the many causes begetting irritation and alarm\r\nin Paris. On the other hand it must be remembered, as one of Pitt’s\r\ngreatest services, that his protests against the American War and his\r\nsubsequent efforts for an _entente cordiale_ with France, had so far\r\neffaced resentment on this side of the Channel, that the strivings\r\nof Frenchmen after political freedom and social equality aroused the\r\ndeepest interest. The majority of our people sympathized with Fox,\r\nwhen, on hearing of the fall of the Bastille, he exclaimed: “How\r\nmuch is this the greatest and best event that has happened in the\r\nworld.”[885]\r\n\r\nOfficial prudence or natural reserve kept Pitt silent on these affairs,\r\nand on the horrors of the ensuing Jacquerie, which speedily cooled\r\nthe first transports of Britons. We know, however, that he must have\r\nviewed the financial collapse of France with secret satisfaction; for\r\nin August–September 1788 he wrote to Grenville in terms which implied\r\nthat the recovery of the credit of France, then expected under the\r\nfostering care of Necker, would be a very serious blow, implying as it\r\ndid the resumption of her aggressive schemes in the East.[886] Now,\r\nhowever, the disorders in France aroused his pity; and on 14th July,\r\nbefore he can have heard of the fall of the Bastille, he wrote to his\r\nmother that France was fast becoming “an object of compassion even to\r\na rival.”[887] There is no sign that he feared the spread of democratic\r\nopinions into England. The monarchy had never been so popular as since\r\nthe mental malady of the King. On the whole, then, Pitt surveyed the\r\nfirst events of the Revolution from the standpoint of a diplomatist\r\nand financier. France seemed to him doomed to a time of chastening and\r\nweakness which might upset the uneasy equilibrium of Europe.\r\n\r\nAlready he had come into touch with the French people at a very\r\nsensitive point, and in a way which illustrated their eager expectancy\r\nand his cool and calculating character. On 25th June Necker sent to him\r\nan urgent appeal begging that he would sanction the export of flour\r\nfrom Great Britain to France in order to make good the scarcity which\r\nthere prevailed. If the request must come before Parliament, he trusted\r\nthat the boon would speedily be granted by a generous nation, and by a\r\nstatesman “whose rare virtues, sublime talents, and superb renown have\r\nlong rivetted my admiration and that of all Europe.”[888]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast to this personal and effusive request was the cold\r\nand correct demeanour of Pitt. He sent the following formal reply, not\r\nto Necker, but to the French ambassador, the Marquis de Luzerne:\r\n\r\n                              Downing Street, _3rd July, 1789_.[889]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Pitt presents his compliments to the Marquis de Luzerne. He\r\n    has felt the strongest desire to be able to recommend sending\r\n    the supply of flour desir’d by Mons^r Necker and had hopes from\r\n    the information at first given him by Mr. Wilson that it would\r\n    be practicable; but, having afterwards received some contrary\r\n    information, he thought it necessary that the subject should be\r\n    examined by the Committee of Council for the Affairs of Trade,\r\n    whose enquiry was not clos’d till this morning. Mr. Pitt has now\r\n    the mortification to find that, according to the accounts of the\r\n    persons most conversant with the corn trade, the present supply in\r\n    this country compar’d with the demand, and the precarious prospect\r\n    of the harvest render it impossible to propose to Parliament to\r\n    authorize any exportation.\r\n\r\nThree days later Pulteney brought the matter before the House of\r\nCommons and deprecated the export of 20,000 sacks of flour to France\r\nwhich had been talked of. Pitt thereupon stated that skilled advice was\r\nbeing taken as to the advisability of allowing such an export, in view\r\nof the shortness at home, and the gloomy prospects for the harvest.\r\nWilberforce, Dempster, and Major Scott urged the more generous course\r\ntowards our suffering neighbours; but others pointed out that, as the\r\nprice of home wheat was rising (it rose seven shillings the bushel on\r\nthat very day), any such proposal would enhance that perilous tendency\r\nat home without materially benefiting the French. Even at the present\r\nfigures export was forbidden under the existing Corn Law; but Pitt\r\nmentioned that a curious attempt was on foot at Shoreham to depress the\r\nprice from forty-eight shillings to forty-four in order to procure the\r\nexport of 8,000 sacks of flour to Havre. As the transaction was clearly\r\nfictitious, he had directed the Customs officers to stop the export. On\r\n13th July Grenville, in the absence of Pitt, asked leave to introduce a\r\nBill for the better ascertaining and regulating the export of corn; and\r\nthe House at once agreed.[890]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the beginning of Pitt’s relations to French democracy.\r\nThey are certainly to be regretted. His reply to Necker’s request is\r\nicily correct and patriotically insular; and his whole attitude was a\r\nwarning to the French not to expect from him any deviation from the\r\nrules of Political Economy. Of course it is unfair to tax him with\r\nblindness in not recognizing the momentous character of the crisis.\r\nNo one could foresee the banishment of Necker, the surrender of the\r\nBastille, on the very day after Grenville’s motion, still less the\r\nstories of the _pacte de famine_, and their hideous finale, the march\r\nof the _dames des halles_ to Versailles, ostensibly to get food.\r\nNevertheless, the highest statesmanship transcends mere reason. The\r\ngreatest of leaders knows instinctively when economic laws and the\r\nneeds of his own nation may be set aside for the welfare of humanity.\r\nThe gift of 20,000 sacks of flour outright would have been the best\r\nbargain of Pitt’s career. It would have spoken straight to the heart\r\nof France, and brought about a genuine _entente cordiale_. His conduct\r\nwas absolutely justified by law. The Commercial Treaty of 1786 with\r\nFrance had not included the trade in corn or flour, which had long been\r\nsubject to strict regulations, and therefore remained so. Moreover, the\r\nDublin Government did not allow the export of wheat to Great Britain\r\nuntil home wheat sold at more than thirty shillings the barrel; and\r\nin that year of scarcity, 1789, when the harvest was extremely late,\r\nand the yield uncertain even at the beginning of December, the fiat\r\nwent forth from Dublin Castle that no wheat must for the present cross\r\nthe Irish Sea to relieve the scarcity in England.[891] If that was the\r\ncase between the sister kingdoms, Pitt certainly acted correctly in\r\nforbidding the export of flour to France.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Anglo-French relations were decidedly cool. The Duke of\r\nDorset, our ambassador at Paris, reported that it was not desirable for\r\nEnglish visitors to appear in the streets amid the excitements that\r\nfollowed on the fall of the Bastille; and an agent, named Hippisley,\r\nemployed by him, reported that “the prejudices against the English were\r\nvery general--the pretext taken being our refusal to aid the French\r\nwith grain, and our reception of M. Calonne, which, they contended,\r\nwas in deference to the Polignacs.”[892] The Duke of Dorset also\r\nreferred to the prevalence of wild rumours as to our efforts to destroy\r\nthe French ships and dockyard at Brest, and to foment disorders in\r\nFrance.[893]\r\n\r\nCertainly we were not fortunate in our ambassador. In the year 1786 the\r\nDuke of Dorset had often shown petty touchiness in his relations with\r\nWilliam Eden, besides jealously curbing the superior abilities of his\r\nown subordinate, Daniel Hailes. Now that they were gone, his despatches\r\nwere thin and lacking in balance. After the fall of the Bastille, he\r\nwrote to the Duke of Leeds that “the greatest Revolution that we know\r\nof has been effected with, comparatively speaking, ... the loss of very\r\nfew lives. From this moment we may consider France as a free country,\r\nthe King as a very limited monarch, and the nobility as reduced to a\r\nlevel with the rest of the nation.” He described the tactful visit of\r\nLouis XVI to Paris on 17th July as the most humiliating step he could\r\npossibly take. “He was actually led in triumph like a tame bear by the\r\ndeputies and the city militia.” He added, with an unusual flash of\r\ninsight, that the people had not been led by any man or party, “but\r\nmerely by the general diffusion of reason and philosophy.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though the King’s youngest brother, the Comte d’Artois,\r\nand his reactionary followers were scattered to the four winds, Dorset\r\nhad the imprudence to write to congratulate him on his escape. The\r\nletter was intercepted, and the populace at once raised a hue and cry\r\nagainst the British embassy, it being well known that the Duke was on\r\nthe most familiar terms with the highest aristocracy. Dorset thereupon\r\nwrote to the Duke of Leeds urging the need of stating officially the\r\ngood will of England for France; and that Minister at once expressed\r\n“the earnest desire of His Majesty and his Ministers to cultivate and\r\npromote that friendship and harmony, which so happily subsists between\r\nthe two countries.” Dorset communicated this to the National Assembly\r\non 3rd August; but that was his last official act. He forthwith\r\nreturned to England, presumably because of the indiscretion related\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nDuring the next months the duties of the embassy devolved upon Lord\r\nRobert Stephen Fitzgerald (brother of the more famous Lord Edward), who\r\nwas charged to do all in his power to cultivate friendly relations with\r\nthe French Government, and, for the present at least, to discourage\r\nthe visits of English tourists.[894] The new envoy certainly showed\r\nmore tact than Dorset; but his despatches give the impression that he\r\nlonged for the political reaction which he more than once predicted\r\nas imminent. We may notice here that the Pitt Cabinet showed no sign\r\nof uneasiness as to the safety of its archives at the Paris embassy\r\nuntil 5th March, when orders were issued to send back to London all the\r\nciphers and deciphers. The attitude of Pitt towards French affairs was\r\none of cautious observation.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime affairs at Paris went rapidly from bad to worse.\r\nThe scarcity of ready money, the dearness of bread, and the wild\r\nstories of the so-called _pacte de famine_, for starving the populace\r\ninto obedience, whetted class-hatreds, and rendered possible the\r\nextraordinary scenes of 5th and 6th October. As is well known, the\r\ntactlessness of the Queen and courtiers on the one side, and on the\r\nother the intrigues of the Duke of Orleans and his agents, led up\r\nto the weird march of the market-women and rabble of Paris upon\r\nVersailles, which brought the Royal Family captive into the capital.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the Duke of Orleans being highly desirable, he was sent\r\nto London, ostensibly on a diplomatic mission, but really in order to\r\nget rid of him until affairs should have settled down.[895] The pretext\r\nwas found in the troubles in the Austrian Netherlands. As we saw in\r\nthe previous chapters, nothing could be more unlike the growingly\r\ndemocratic movement in France than the revolt of the Flemings and\r\nBrabanters against the anti-national reforms of Joseph II of Austria.\r\nMen so diverse as Burke and Dumouriez discerned that truth. The great\r\nIrishman in a letter to Rivarol termed the Belgian rising a resistance\r\nto innovation;[896] while to the French free-thinker it was _une\r\nrévolution théocratique_. Nevertheless, as many Frenchmen cherished the\r\nhope of giving a prince to the Pays Bas, it was thought well to put\r\nforth a feeler London-wards; and Philippe Egalité in fancy saw himself\r\nenthroned at Brussels.\r\n\r\nSuch a solution would have been highly displeasing both at Westminster\r\nand at Windsor; and there is no proof that the Duke even mentioned it\r\nat Whitehall. In point of fact his mission was never taken seriously.\r\nGeorge III, with characteristic acuteness in all matters relating to\r\nintrigue, had divined the secret motive of his journey and expressed it\r\nin the following hitherto unpublished letter to the Duke of Leeds:\r\n\r\n                            WINDSOR, _Oct. 19, 1789_. 9.55 a.m.[897]\r\n\r\n    The language held by the Marquis de Luzerne to the Duke of Leeds\r\n    on the proposed journey of the Duke of Orleans does not entirely\r\n    coincide with the intelligence from Lord Robert Fitzgerald of the\r\n    Duke’s message to the States General [_sic_] announcing his absence\r\n    as the consequence of a negotiation with which he is to be employed\r\n    at this Court. I confess I attribute it to his finding his views\r\n    not likely to succeed or some personal uneasiness for his own\r\n    safety....\r\n\r\nThe King argued correctly; and doubtless his suspicions ensured for\r\nthe Duke a chilly reception at the Foreign Office. On 22nd or 23rd\r\nOctober Leeds saw him at his residence in London, but could get from\r\nhim no more than polite professions of regard for England. Leeds\r\nthereupon urged Fitzgerald to find out whether the Duke’s “mission”\r\nwas a plausible pretext for securing his absence from Paris; to\r\nwhich our envoy replied that everyone at Paris spoke of him with\r\nindifference or contempt, and that Lafayette had discovered proofs of\r\nhis complicity in the outrages of 5th to 6th October, and therefore\r\nhad him sent away. On 6th November Fitzgerald added that Louis XVI had\r\ngiven the Duke no instructions whatever. Leeds had already come to\r\nmuch the same conclusion. On 30th October he saw Orleans, who merely\r\nsuggested a close understanding between England and France, especially\r\nif the Emperor should march an army into his Belgic provinces. Leeds\r\ncoolly replied that the desire of Joseph II to crush the revolt was\r\nmost natural, and that France would do well to restore order at home\r\nrather than look with apprehension on events beyond her borders. As he\r\naccompanied these remarks with expressions of sincere commiseration for\r\nLouis XVI, Orleans must have seen that the secret of his involuntary\r\nmission was divined. This seems to be the only notice of it in the\r\nBritish archives. His sinister reputation and his association with\r\nloose company in London soon deprived him of all consequence.\r\n\r\nPitt’s attitude towards the Belgian Question has been already\r\ndescribed. He seems to have given more time and thought to it than\r\nto the French Revolution--a fact which is not strange if we remember\r\nthat the future of the Belgic lands was of untold importance for Great\r\nBritain. To secure their independence from France she had many times\r\npoured out her blood and treasure; and Pitt was destined to spend his\r\nlast energies in the greatest of those efforts. Moreover, as we have\r\nseen, the European polity was far more seriously menaced by the schemes\r\nof Catharine, Joseph, and Hertzberg than by French reformers; and no\r\none expected that in a short time the shifting kaleidoscope of European\r\nStates would be altogether shivered by blows dealt from Paris. We, who\r\nknow the outcome of events, are apt to accuse Pitt of shortsightedness\r\nfor not concentrating his attention on France; but the criticism rests\r\non the cheapest of all kinds of wisdom--wisdom after the event. In\r\nPitt’s mind the advent of militant democracy aroused neither ecstasy\r\nnor loathing. His royalism had nothing in common with the crusading\r\nzeal of Gustavus III, and therefore did not impel him to rescue the\r\nBourbons from the troubles which resulted so largely from their\r\nparticipation in the American War. Here, as everywhere, Pitt allowed\r\ncold reason to rule; and reason suggested that the Bourbons might atone\r\nfor that stupendous blunder as best they could. Besides, the experience\r\nof nations, as of families, forbade the interference of an outsider\r\nin domestic quarrels. Apart from its bearing on Belgian affairs, the\r\nFrench Revolution is scarcely named in Pitt’s correspondence of this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nStill more curious is it that the letters of George III to his\r\nMinister contain not a single reference to the Revolution. This\r\nsilence respecting events of untold import for all crowned heads is\r\nexplicable if we remember that to most men they seemed but the natural\r\noutcome of mismanagement and deficient harvests, which statesmanship\r\nand mother Nature would ere long set right. The proneness of George\r\nto look at everything from his own limited point of view was also at\r\nthis time emphasized by ill health and family troubles, which blotted\r\nout weightier topics. Thus, on 1st May 1789, he declared his annoyance\r\nat the sudden return of Prince William from the West Indies--a proof\r\nthat his paternal commands would never be obeyed. The Prince, he says,\r\nmust now have the same allowance as the Duke of York. “I have,” he\r\nadds, “but too much reason to expect no great comfort but an additional\r\nmember to the opposite faction in my own family.” He concludes with\r\nthe desire that some arrangement may be made for the Queen and the\r\nprincesses in case of his death; for his whole nervous system has\r\nsustained a great shock in the late illness. On 9th June the King again\r\nexpresses to Pitt his regret that Prince William declines to return to\r\nsea. His letters during the rest of that exciting year are devoid of\r\ninterest if we except the effort to reconcile Pitt and Thurlow referred\r\nto in Chapter XX.\r\n\r\nThe King’s domestic dronings are varied on 14th January 1790 by an\r\nexcited declaration that a frigate must be provided at once in order to\r\nconvey Prince Edward, afterwards Duke of Kent, to Gibraltar, as it was\r\nof urgent importance that he should at once leave London.[898] On 3rd\r\nMarch he records his heartfelt joy at the failure of Fox’s attempt to\r\nprocure the repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts; and on the 28th of\r\nthat month occurs the first reference to the French Revolution which\r\nI have found in the King’s letters. He then expresses to Pitt regret\r\nthat the papers forwarded by the Comte d’Artois (younger brother of\r\nLouis XVI) and his political agent, Calonne, contain so little real\r\ninformation about the affairs of France. He continues thus: “Mr. Pitt’s\r\nanswer should be very civil, and may be very explicit as to no money or\r\nother means having been used to keep up the confusion in France; and\r\nM. de Calonne ought to convey those assurances wherever he thinks they\r\nmay be of use.”[899] Readers who have an eye for the ironies of history\r\nmay notice that the first of the myriad stories thrown off by the\r\nperfervid Gallic imagination, as to the ubiquitous potency of British\r\nmoney in creating famines, arming assassins, and trumping up Coalitions\r\nagainst France, originated with the royalist exiles, who saw in the\r\nFrench Revolution the first manifestation of the wonder-working power\r\nof “Pitt’s gold.”\r\n\r\nThat statesman’s opinion concerning the Revolution was first made\r\nknown during the debates on the Army Estimates (5th and 9th February\r\n1790). Having inserted in the King’s Speech a reference to the friendly\r\nassurances which he received from all the Powers, and a guarded\r\nstatement that the internal troubles in certain states engaged the\r\nKing’s “most serious attention,” he was twitted by champions of economy\r\nwith a slight increase in the army. True, the total provided for was\r\nonly 17,448 officers and men; and part of the increase was due to the\r\ndrafting of 200 men to keep order in the infant colony of New South\r\nWales. But even these figures, which\r\n\r\n              barely could defy\r\n  The arithmetic of babes,\r\n\r\naroused the compunctions of Marsham, Fox, and Pulteney. They complained\r\nthat, though most of our Colonial Empire had been lost, yet our army\r\nhad been increased by thirteen regiments since the disastrous peace of\r\n1783. Marsham deemed this increase “alarming,” and wholly needless in\r\nview of the paralysis of France. Fox did not repeat the stale platitude\r\nthat a standing army was a danger to liberty; for, as he pointed out,\r\nthe French soldiers had shown themselves to be good citizens; but he\r\nopposed the present vote on the ground of economy, and because it was\r\nurgently necessary to strengthen the public credit, which could be done\r\nonly by reductions of expenditure. He repeated these arguments in the\r\nsecond debate, that of 9th February.\r\n\r\nOn both occasions Pitt defended the proposed vote for the army, on\r\nthe ground that “a small saving now might prove the worst economy,\r\nby involving us in disputes which might be attended with greater\r\nadditional burthens to the kingdom.” In the latter debate he skilfully\r\nused the admission of Fox, that any one who three years before had\r\nforetold the present convulsions in France would have been deemed\r\na lunatic, in order to enforce the need of preparedness, it being\r\nno excuse for responsible Ministers to exclaim in the midst of\r\ndisasters--“Who would have thought of it?” Then, as was his wont, he\r\nopened up wider vistas in this noble but, alas, less prophetic strain:\r\n\r\n    The present convulsions of France must, sooner or later, terminate\r\n    in general harmony and regular order; and though the fortunate\r\n    arrangements of such a situation may make her more formidable, it\r\n    may also render her less obnoxious as a neighbour.... Whenever the\r\n    situation of France shall become restored, it will prove freedom\r\n    rightly understood; freedom resulting from good order and good\r\n    government; and thus circumstanced France will stand forward as\r\n    one of the most brilliant Powers in Europe; she will enjoy just\r\n    that kind of liberty which I venerate, and the valuable existence\r\n    of which it is my duty, as an Englishman, peculiarly to cherish;\r\n    nor can I, under this predicament, regard with envious eyes, an\r\n    approximation in neighbouring States to those sentiments which are\r\n    the characteristic features of every British subject. Easier, I\r\n    will admit with the right hon. gentleman, is it to destroy than\r\n    rebuild; and therefore I trust that this universally acknowledged\r\n    position will convince gentlemen that they ought, on the present\r\n    question, not to relax their exertions for the strength of the\r\n    country, but endeavour to regain our former pinnacle of glory, and\r\n    to improve, for our security, happiness and aggrandisement, those\r\n    precious moments of peace and leisure which are before us.[900]\r\n\r\nThis statesmanlike utterance was not prompted by considerations of the\r\nmutability of human affairs. The bent of Pitt’s mind was too practical\r\nto be influenced by copy-book maxims. Already, on 21st January, the\r\nfirst rumours had reached the Foreign Office, which portended serious\r\nfriction with Spain. To this question we must devote the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIt will be well, however, to conclude this chapter by a few remarks on\r\nthe standpoints from which Pitt and Burke viewed the French Revolution.\r\nThey were in truth so different as scarcely to admit of comparison.\r\nThe judgements of Pitt were those of a statesman of an objective order\r\nof mind, who weighed events carefully, judged men critically, and\r\nwas content to change his policy as occasion required. In his view\r\ninstitutions were made for men, not men for institutions. But his zeal\r\nfor Reform was tempered by respect for the verdicts of the past and by\r\nthe knowledge that the progress of mankind must be slow if it is to be\r\nsure. He had lost much of his earlier zeal for Parliamentary Reform,\r\nbut only because the people had seemed to care little for it, and\r\nwere sincerely attached to their time-worn institutions. His attitude\r\ntowards this great question during the stormy years of the Jacobin\r\nascendancy will concern us later; and we need only notice here that,\r\neven at that time of political ferment, he never declared that under\r\nno circumstances would he bring in a Reform Bill, but always left open\r\na door of hope in that direction when quieter days should return. For\r\nthe present he repressed all movements which he considered seditious,\r\ndangerous, or likely to cause divisions; and for that alone he may be\r\ncondemned by friends of progress.\r\n\r\nFrom the other side he is censured for his lack of sympathy with\r\nthe woes of a distressed King and Queen. Certainly we miss in his\r\nutterances any gush of genuine feeling on a subject which touched the\r\ninmost springs of emotion in our people. True, he had small ground for\r\nliking Louis XVI and his consort. The King of France had dealt the\r\nBritish Empire a deadly blow in America; and Marie Antoinette was an\r\ninveterate intriguer against England. Even up to the flight to Varennes\r\nat midsummer 1791, she impelled her brother, Leopold II of Austria,\r\nin his anti-English courses, which, as we shall see, cost us so dear.\r\nWhat was worse, she even accused England of having instigated all the\r\ndisorders of which she was the victim. Nevertheless, it would have been\r\ngenerous to attribute this spitefulness to her narrow training and\r\nbitter sorrows. Pitt would have been a more engaging figure if he had\r\noccasionally shown a spark of that indignation which burnt so fiercely\r\nin Burke. If he had any deep feelings on the subject, he chose to\r\nconceal them, perhaps from a conviction that the expression of them\r\nwould do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nWell would it have been for the cause of peace if the champion of\r\nFrench royalism in these islands had obeyed the dictates of reason\r\nwhich held Pitt tongue-tied. Unfortunately sentiment and emotion at\r\nthis time reigned supreme in the great mind of Burke. Every student of\r\nhistory must admire the generous impulses which were incarnate in the\r\ngreat Irishman. They lent colour to the products of his imagination,\r\nand they lit up his actions with a glow which makes his blunders more\r\nbrilliant than the dull successes of mediocre men. Where sentiment\r\nwas a safe guide, there Burke led on with an energy that was not less\r\nconspicuous than his insight. Where critical acumen, mental balance,\r\nand self-restraint were needed, the excess of his qualities often led\r\nhim far astray. The true function of such a man is to interpret the\r\nhalf-felt impulses of the many. If he seek to guide them to definite\r\nsolutions, his ardent temperament is apt to overshoot the mark.\r\nObservers noted how Burke’s vehement conduct of the Warren Hastings\r\naffair injured his cause; and many more were soon to discern the same\r\nfailing when, with Celtic ardour, he rushed into the complex mazes of\r\nthe French Revolution.\r\n\r\nOpinions will always differ as to the merits of his remarkable book on\r\nthat subject. Its transcendent literary excellences at once ensured\r\nit an influence enjoyed by no other political work of that age; but\r\nwe are here concerned with his “Reflections” not as literature, but\r\nas criticism on the French movement. Even in this respect he rightly\r\ngauged some of the weaknesses of Gallic democracy. He was the first of\r\nBritons to discern the peril to the cause of freedom when the brutal\r\nfury of the populace broke forth in the hour of its first triumph,\r\nthe surrender of the Bastille, and still more in the Jacqueries that\r\nfollowed. He also gave eloquent and imperishable expression to the\r\nfeeling of respect for all that is venerable, in which the French\r\nreformers were sadly deficient; and, while he bade them save all that\r\ncould be saved of their richly-storied past, he truly foretold their\r\nfuture if they gave rein to their iconoclastic zeal. In my judgement\r\nthe passage in which Burke foretells the advent of Bonaparte is grander\r\neven than that immortal rhapsody on the fate of Marie Antoinette and\r\nthe passing away of the age of chivalry. The one is the warning of a\r\nprophet; the latter is the wail of a genius.\r\n\r\nEqually profound are his warnings to the French enthusiasts of the\r\ndanger of applying theories to the infinite complexities of an old\r\nsociety. To quote some sentences:\r\n\r\n    The science of constructing a commonwealth, or renovating it, or\r\n    reforming it, is, like every other experimental science, not to be\r\n    taught _a priori_. Nor is it a short experience that can instruct\r\n    us in that practical science, because the real effects of moral\r\n    causes are not always immediate.... The science of government\r\n    being therefore so practical in itself, and intended for such\r\n    practical purposes, a matter which requires experience, and even\r\n    more experience than any person can gain in his whole life, however\r\n    sagacious and observing he may be, it is with infinite caution\r\n    that any man ought to venture upon pulling down an edifice, which\r\n    has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes\r\n    of society, or on building it up again, without having models and\r\n    patterns of approved utility before his eyes.... The nature of man\r\n    is intricate; the objects of society are of the greatest possible\r\n    complexity; and therefore no simple disposition or direction of\r\n    power can be suitable either to man’s nature, or to the quality\r\n    of his affairs. When I hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed\r\n    at and boasted of in any new political constitutions, I am at no\r\n    loss to decide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their\r\n    trade, or totally negligent of their duty.... The rights of men in\r\n    governments are their advantages, and these are often in balances\r\n    between differences of good, in compromises sometimes between good\r\n    and evil, and sometimes between evil and evil.... I cannot conceive\r\n    how any man can have brought himself to that pitch of presumption\r\n    to consider his country as nothing but _carte blanche_, upon which\r\n    he may scribble whatever he pleases.\r\n\r\nWe are here reminded of the saying of Dumont, the friend of Mirabeau,\r\nthat the fear of being thought officious and interfering is as\r\nuniversal among the English as is the desire of the French of taking\r\na prominent part and interfering in everything.[901] This home thrust\r\nby the able Swiss thinker goes far to explain the difference between\r\nthe Revolution of 1688 in England and that of a century later in\r\nFrance. Vanity, love of the sensational, and, a mania for wholesale\r\nreconstruction on geometrical designs largely account for the failures\r\nof the French revolutionists; and Burke’s warnings on these heads were\r\ntreated with the petulant disdain characteristic of clever children.\r\n\r\nBurke also did good service by pointing out the fundamental differences\r\nbetween the general overturn in France and the “glorious Revolution”\r\nof 1688 in England. Slipshod comparisons of the two events were then\r\nmuch in vogue, witness the sermon of Dr. Price in the Old Jewry, on\r\nwhich Burke conferred the fame of a never ending pillory. The Whigs,\r\nwho formed a rapidly thinning tail behind their impetuous leader, were\r\nnever tired of discovering historical parallels; and it is possible\r\nthat Pitt’s sympathy with Whiggism, stunted but not wholly blighted by\r\nParliamentary friction, led him to the hopeful prophecy already quoted.\r\nCertainly very many Frenchmen saw themselves in fancy entering on\r\npeaceful paths of progress under a more genial William III. At the time\r\nwhen Burke was completing his “Reflections,” Wordsworth and his friend\r\nduring a Long Vacation tour in France were met with warmest cheer by\r\n_fédérés_ who had shared in the ecstatic Festival of the Federation\r\n(14th July 1790):\r\n\r\n  And with their swords flourished as if to fight\r\n  The saucy air.\r\n\r\nAt once the Englishmen were greeted as brothers.\r\n\r\n              We bore a name\r\n  Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,\r\n  And hospitably did they give us hail\r\n  As their fore-runners in a glorious course.\r\n\r\nAll this was very pleasing; but it could only end in bitter\r\nestrangement when France was found to be concerned, not with\r\n“preventing a Revolution” (as Burke finely showed that England did in\r\n1688[902]), but in carrying through with unimaginable zeal a political\r\noverturn, along with social, religious, and agrarian changes of the\r\nmost drastic kind. This was evident enough even by the summer of\r\n1790. Feudalism had been swept away root and branch; copy-holders\r\nhad become freeholders; the old taxes were no more--and none had\r\ndefinitely taken their place; titles of nobility were abolished; and\r\nthe Assembly declared war on the discipline and on one of the dogmas of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church. Well might Burke stand aghast and declare\r\nthat this cataclysm had little or nothing in common with the insular,\r\nconservative, and constitutional efforts of Englishmen a century\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the defects of his book arose largely from his\r\nunderrating the differences between the two movements. In his eagerness\r\nto preserve Englishmen from the risk of hazily sympathizing with\r\nFrench democracy, he inveighed against the new doctrines with a zeal\r\nthat was not always born of knowledge. Forgetting his earlier adage\r\nrespecting America--“I will never draw up an indictment against a whole\r\npeople”--he sought to convict Frenchmen of fickleness and insanity. He\r\ncalls the Revolution “this strange chaos of levity and ferocity, and of\r\nall sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies”; and\r\nhe even ventured to prophesy that in France learning would be “trodden\r\ndown under the hoofs of a swinish multitude.” Coming nearer to facts,\r\nhe took the French to task for not repairing their old constitution.\r\nHe likened it to a venerable castle in which some of the walls and\r\nall the foundations were still in existence, and added the surprising\r\nstatement--“you had the elements of a constitution very nearly as good\r\nas could be wished.”\r\n\r\nHere Burke went wholly astray. A constitution, which gave to the King\r\na power limited only by the occasional protests of the Paris and other\r\n“Parlements”; under which the States-General (at best little more than\r\nan advisory body) had not been summoned for 175 years; which assigned\r\nto the “_Tiers Etat_” only one third of the legislative power and no\r\ncontrol over the executive, though the Commons of France paid nearly\r\nall the taxation; and which promised to perpetuate the old division\r\ninto three classes,--such a constitution was merely an interesting\r\nblend of the principles of Feudalism and Absolute Monarchy, but could\r\nnever satisfy a nation which had listened to Voltaire and given its\r\nheart to Rousseau. Sir Philip Francis, with his usual incisiveness,\r\npointed out to Burke that the French could not act as we did in 1688,\r\nfor they had no constitution to recur to, much less one that was “very\r\nnearly as good as could be wished.”\r\n\r\nIn truth, Burke did not know France. Hence his work is of permanent\r\nvalue only where he praises English methods and launches into wise and\r\nnoble generalizations. For his own people it will ever be the political\r\nBook of Proverbs. His indictments against the French people in the main\r\nflew over their heads. On most insufficient knowledge he ventured on\r\nsweeping assertions which displayed the subtlety and wide sweep of his\r\nthought, but convinced only those who did not know the difficulties\r\nbesetting the men of 1789. Nevertheless, as readers are influenced far\r\nmore by emotion than by close and exact reason, the vast majority were\r\ncarried away by the rush of feeling of that mighty soul; and hence\r\nin the view of a philosophic monarchist like Dumont, the publication\r\nof the “Reflections” was destined to be “the salvation of Europe.”\r\nCertainly it was the first noteworthy effort of a literary man to stem\r\nthe tide of democracy; and if the writer had advocated a practicable\r\nscheme for saving the French monarchy--say, on the lines of that of\r\nMirabeau--he would have rendered an inestimable service. As it was,\r\neven the voice of a genius failed to convince the French people that\r\nthey must build their new fabric on the lines laid down by Philip the\r\nFair and Louis the Fourteenth.\r\n\r\nWhile the “Reflections” caused little but irritation in France,\r\nthey also worked some harm in England. Readers by the thousand were\r\ncaptivated by the glamour of Burke’s style, and became forthwith the\r\nsworn foes of the persecutors of Marie Antoinette. The fall of that\r\nerstwhile “morning star, full of life and splendour and joy,” involved\r\nin one common gloom the emotions and the reason of Britons. “It is the\r\nnoblest, deepest, most animated and exalted work that I think I have\r\never read.” So wrote Fanny Burney. The superlatives are significant.\r\nThenceforth events in France were viewed through the distorting medium\r\nof a royalist romance. The change was fatal in every way. England,\r\nwhich heretofore had guardedly sympathized with the French reformers,\r\nnow swung round to antagonism; and the French princes who at Turin and\r\nCoblentz were striving to frame a Coalition against their native land,\r\nsaw in fancy John Bull as the paymaster of the monarchist league, with\r\nBurke as the chief trumpeter.\r\n\r\nIn truth the great writer ran some risk of sinking to this level. He\r\nbecame the unofficial representative of the French princes in this\r\ncountry, while his son, Richard Burke, proceeded to Coblentz to work on\r\nbehalf of that clamorous clique. Memoir after memoir appeared from the\r\npen of Burke himself. Now it was a protest, purporting to emanate from\r\nGeorge III, against despoiling the French monarchy of all its rights,\r\nand asserting that, if this caution were unheeded, our ambassador\r\nwould leave Paris.[903] Now again it was a memorandum of advice to\r\nthe Queen of France, urging her to have nothing to do with traitors\r\n(_i.e._, reformers), to maintain an attitude of silent disdain of their\r\noffered help, and, above all, to induce her consort to refuse the new\r\ndemocratic constitution.[904] Fortunately neither of these documents\r\nwent beyond the doors of Burke’s study; but they survive as curious\r\nproofs of his now distracted mood.\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of Burke at this time that majesty of diction\r\ndeserted him at Westminster, where his speeches and demeanour bore the\r\nimprint of petulance and sourness. This appeared most painfully in the\r\nfamous scene which marked his severance from Fox. It occurred during\r\nthe debates on the Canada Bill in the spring of 1791. The preoccupation\r\nof men’s minds with the French constitution, then slowly taking shape,\r\nhad been apparent in the course of the session. Fox had often dragged\r\nin the subject to express his warm sympathy with the democrats of\r\nParis, and now desired to assimilate the Canada Bill somewhat to the\r\nFrench model. To this Burke offered vehement opposition, out-doing\r\nFox in iteration. On 6th May, when the subject at issue was Canada,\r\nhe defied the rules of the House by speaking solely on France. Six\r\ntimes he was called to order. Still he went on, in more and more\r\nheated tones, until he crowned his diatribe with the declaration that\r\nthe difference between him and his friend involved an end of their\r\nconnection; for with his latest words he would exclaim: “Fly from the\r\nFrench Constitution.” Fox here whispered to him: “There is no loss of\r\nfriends.” “Yes,” retorted Burke, “there is a loss of friends; I know\r\nthe price of my conduct; I have done my duty at the price of my friend;\r\nour friendship is at an end.” A little later, when Fox rose to reply,\r\nwords failed him and tears trickled down his cheeks.[905] No scene in\r\nParliament in that age produced so profound an emotion. It deepened the\r\naffection felt for that generous statesman; while the once inspiring\r\nfigure of Burke now stood forth in the hard and repellent outlines of a\r\nfanatic.\r\n\r\nFar better would it have been had he confined himself to the higher\r\ndomains of literature, where he was at home. His “Appeal from the New\r\nto the Old Whigs,” which appeared in July 1791, is a great and moving\r\nproduction; and his less known “Thoughts on French Affairs” (December\r\n1791) is remarkable for its keen insight into the causes that made for\r\ndisruption or revolt in the European lands, not even excluding Great\r\nBritain.[906] In this one respect Burke excelled Pitt, just as nervous\r\napprehension will detect dangers ahead that are hidden from the serene\r\ngaze of an optimist. Wilberforce judged Pitt to be somewhat deficient\r\nin foresight;[907] and we may ascribe this defect to his intense\r\nhopefulness and his lack of close acquaintance with men in this country\r\nand, still more, on the Continent. Burke found that both the Prime\r\nMinister and Grenville had not the slightest fear of the effect of\r\nrevolutionary ideas in this Kingdom “either at present or at any time\r\nto come.”[908] Here Burke was the truer prophet. But how could Pitt\r\nsift the wise from the unwise in the copious output of Burke’s mind?\r\nThey mingle so closely as to bewilder the closest observer even now,\r\nwhen the mists of passion enveloping those controversies have partly\r\ncleared away. Sentiment palpitated visibly in all Burke’s utterances;\r\nand the teachings of the philosopher were lost amidst the diatribes of\r\nthe partisan.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was difficult for a practical statesman to take the orator\r\nseriously. In April 1791 he had furiously attacked Pitt’s Russian\r\npolicy; and, as we have seen, the differences between them were more\r\nthan political, they were temperamental. No characteristic of Pitt is\r\nmore remarkable than the balance of his faculties and the evenness\r\nof his disposition. No defect in Burke’s nature is more patent than\r\nhis lack of self-control, to which, rather than to his poverty, I am\r\ninclined to ascribe his exclusion from the Whig Cabinets. Irritability\r\nin small things had long been his bane; and now to the solution of\r\nthe greatest problem in modern history he brought a fund of passion\r\nand prejudice equal to that of any of the French _émigrés_ who were\r\npestering the Courts of Europe to crush the new ideas by force.\r\n\r\nYet, however much Pitt mistrusted Burke the politician, he admired\r\nhim as a writer; so at least we gather from a somewhat enigmatical\r\nreference in Wilberforce’s diary. “22nd November (1790): Went to\r\nWimbledon--Dundas, Lord Chatham, Pitt, Grenville, Ryder. Much talk\r\nabout Burke’s book. Lord Chatham, Pitt and I seemed to agree: _contra_,\r\nGrenville and Ryder.”[909] If this entry be correct, Wilberforce and\r\nGrenville were destined soon to change their opinions. It may be that\r\nPitt and Wilberforce agreed with Burke owing to their dislike of the\r\niconoclastic methods of the French democrats, and that Grenville’s cold\r\nnature was repelled by the sentimentalism of the book.\r\n\r\nIn their judgements on the French Revolution Pitt and Burke stood not\r\nfar apart. Pitt knew France no better than the great Irishman, and he\r\ndistrusted theorizers and rash innovators fully as much, especially\r\nwhen their symmetrical notions were carried out by mobs. But the two\r\nmen differed sharply as to the remedy. Burke came to believe more and\r\nmore in armed intervention; Pitt saw in it ruin for French royalists\r\nand turmoil throughout the Continent. Here again the difference was\r\nin the main one of temperament. In Burke’s nature the eagerness and\r\nimpulsiveness of the Celt was degenerating into sheer fussiness, which\r\ndrew him toward the camp of the _émigrés_ who strutted and plotted at\r\nTurin and Coblentz. Pitt’s coolness and reserve bade him distrust those\r\nloud-tongued fanatics, whose political rhapsodies awoke a sympathetic\r\nchord in no ruler save Gustavus of Sweden. True, Catharine of Russia\r\nshrilly bade them Godspeed; but, as we shall see, her distant blessings\r\nwere the outcome of Muscovite diplomacy rather than of royalist zeal.\r\n\r\nPitt and Grenville, who saw other things in life besides the woes\r\nof Marie Antoinette and Jacobin outrages, were resolved not to lead\r\nthe van of the monarchical crusade. They might approve Burke’s sage\r\nproduction, the “Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs,” which won\r\nthe warm commendation of the King, as well as of Grenville, Camden,\r\nand Dundas, but they were bent on maintaining strict neutrality on\r\nthe French Question. Pitt and his cousin met Burke more than once in\r\nthe summer and autumn of 1791; but they kept their thoughts veiled,\r\nprobably because Burke was working hard for the royalist league which\r\nthe French Princes hoped to form. The general impression produced on\r\nBurke was that the Court of St. James would certainly not act against\r\nthe champions of monarchy, but would preserve a benevolent neutrality.\r\nOther observers took a different view. The Russian ambassador,\r\nVorontzoff, declared that Pitt was a democrat at heart, and kept up\r\nthe naval armaments in order to intimidate the royalists, while he\r\nsent Hugh Elliot to Paris to concert measures along with Barnave.[910]\r\nThese stories are of value merely because they illustrate Pitt’s\r\npower of holding back his trump cards and thereby rehabilitating the\r\nnational prestige, which had recently suffered at the hands of the\r\nCzarina. At such a crisis silence is often a potent weapon. The Arab\r\n“Book of Wisdom” asserts that wisdom consists in nine parts of silence;\r\nwhile the tenth part is brevity of utterance. If Burke had realized\r\nthis truth, his political career would not have ended in comparative\r\nfailure. By acting on it, Pitt disconcerted his interviewers and\r\nexasperated his biographers; but he helped to keep peace on the\r\nContinent for nearly a year longer; and he assured that boon to his\r\ncountry for nearly two years. Had Burke been in power, the coalesced\r\nmonarchs would have attacked France in the late summer of 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE DISPUTE WITH SPAIN\r\n\r\n    It is bad economy to tempt an attack, from a state of weakness, and\r\n    thus by a miserable saving ultimately incur the hazard of a great\r\n    expense.--PITT, _Speech of 9th February 1790_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 21st January 1790 there arrived at Whitehall news of an outrage\r\ncommitted by a Spanish officer on the crew of a British vessel trading\r\non the dimly known coast which was destined to be called Vancouver\r\nIsland. The affair became infinitely more serious on 11th February when\r\nthe Spanish ambassador in London, the Marquis del Campo, forwarded to\r\nour Foreign Minister, the Duke of Leeds, an official demand that the\r\nBritish Government should punish certain interlopers who had ventured\r\nto trade and settle at Nootka Sound on that coastline, which Spain\r\nthen considered as part of her Californian domain and for ever closed\r\nto outsiders. This demand produced a state of tension between the two\r\nnations, and subsequent incidents threatened to involve us in war,\r\nnot only with Spain, but with her ally, France. As the outcome of\r\nthis Nootka Sound dispute was the acquisition by Great Britain of a\r\ncoastline of infinite value to Canada and the Empire at large, it will\r\nbe well briefly to describe its origin, its settlement, and its bearing\r\non the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nNootka Sound, a fine natural harbour on the western coast of what is\r\nnow called Vancouver Island, was explored and named by Captain Cook in\r\nthe course of his memorable voyage of the year 1778. He stayed there\r\none month, and bought from the Indians a number of furs which proved\r\nto be of great value in the eyes of the Chinese. In the following\r\nyears British and Spanish ships touched at Nootka; but owing to the\r\nAmerican War, or to the torpor of mercantile enterprise in those days,\r\nnothing definite came of the discovery until the year 1785. Certain\r\nmerchants of the British East India Company trading to China then\r\nresolved to open up trade between that country and the west coast of\r\nAmerica. The commodities sought for the Chinese market were furs and\r\nginseng, a plant used as a drug by the celestials. In the following\r\nyear two small vessels, the “Sea Otter” and the “Nootka,” sailed to the\r\nAmerican coast, and though the former was wrecked, the latter carried\r\nback to China a valuable cargo. The owners replaced her by the “Felice”\r\nand “Iphigenia,” which in 1788 sailed to the same coast. The senior\r\ncaptain, John Meares, a retired lieutenant of the royal navy, bought a\r\npiece of land at Nootka from the Indian chief, Maquilla, formed a small\r\nsettlement, fortified it, and hoisted the British flag. His vessels\r\nthen traded along the coast as far as 60° and 45° 30´, that is, beyond\r\nthe Columbia River on the south, and as far as Mount St. Elias, in what\r\nis now the United States territory of Alaska, but was then recognized\r\nas belonging to Russia’s sphere of influence.[911]\r\n\r\nAt Nootka the adventurous pioneers built a sloop of 40 tons, the\r\n“North-West America,” and bought from Indian chiefs the right of\r\n“free and exclusive” trade with their subjects. As autumn drew on\r\nMeares sailed away to China in the “Felice,” and there persuaded\r\nother merchants to combine in order to form an Associated Company for\r\ndeveloping this lucrative commerce. Accordingly, three more ships,\r\nthe “Prince of Wales,” “Princess Royal,” and “Argonaut,” set sail for\r\nNootka in the spring of 1789 under the command of Captain Colnett,\r\nwho was to reside at that settlement. It is curious to note thus\r\nearly the emergence of the yellow question, for he carried with him\r\nseventy Chinamen who were to settle there under the protection of the\r\nAssociated Company--a proof that the occupation of Nootka was to be\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the Spanish Government, acting through its Viceroy of\r\nMexico, was then bent on the acquisition of this very same district. By\r\nvirtue of the Bull of Pope Alexander VI, and the treaty of Tordesillas\r\n(1494), which speedily followed, Spain claimed exclusive right over\r\nthe Pacific Ocean and all the western coast of America as far north as\r\nlatitude 60°, beyond which were the Russian settlements in Alaska. In\r\nthe year 1774, that is, four years before Cook’s enterprise, a Spanish\r\ncaptain, Perez, had sailed to Nootka and as far north as latitude 55°.\r\nBut no account of his voyage, or of one made in the following year, had\r\nbeen given to the world. Neither had the Spaniards made any attempt\r\nto trade at Nootka, nor to form a settlement, until they heard of the\r\nefforts of the Russians and English to open up trade with the natives.\r\nThen, indeed, they took alarm; and the Viceroy of Mexico despatched\r\ntwo vessels, under the command of Captain Martinez, with orders to\r\nwarn off intruders, and, in case of armed resistance, to use force in\r\nvindicating the claims of Spain. The Viceroy and Martinez knew nothing\r\nconcerning the new developments at Nootka, and had in view the Russians\r\nrather than the British.\r\n\r\nLong before the arrival of Colnett, and while the “Iphigenia” alone\r\nwas at Nootka, there sailed in, on 5th May, a Spanish frigate, the\r\n“Princesa.” Shortly after she was joined by a sloop. Meares had\r\npreviously provided Douglas, the captain of the “Iphigenia,” with\r\npapers proving that she was a Portuguese ship, hailing from Macao,\r\nthe Portuguese settlement near Canton. In reality, however, she was a\r\nBritish ship with a British cargo. Despite the arguments of Douglas,\r\nMartinez soon divined the truth, and took possession of her as well\r\nas the infant settlement of Nootka.[912] A little later he seized the\r\n“North-West America”; and when the “Argonaut” arrived from China, she\r\ntoo fell into his hands by a treacherous ruse, so Colnett averred.\r\nThe “Princess Royal” was the next victim. Fortune certainly favoured\r\nMartinez in having to deal with the British ships as they dropped in\r\nsingly; and he played his game with skill and success.\r\n\r\nThe truth respecting the subsequent occurrences cannot be disentangled\r\nfrom the false or exaggerated accounts of the disputants. Meares,\r\nColnett, and Douglas asserted on oath that they had been treacherously\r\nseized and barbarously treated. Martinez declared that his behaviour\r\nthroughout was humane and considerate. His statements were backed by\r\nthose of certain American traders who were there present; but, as they\r\nfor a time made common cause with Martinez, their evidence is not\r\nconvincing. The assertions of Meares and Colnett on this point are\r\nantecedently credible, it being the habit of Spain to treat interlopers\r\nas little better than privateers. Martinez compelled his prisoners\r\n(so they asserted) to assist in building a stockade, and subsequently\r\ntreated Colnett with so much indignity that he tried to commit suicide,\r\nand Hanson, one of his petty officers, actually did so. The Spanish\r\ncommander then traded with the captured vessels, and finally collected\r\nskins estimated by Meares to be worth about 7,500 Spanish dollars.\r\nThe British ships and crews were afterwards taken to the Spanish port\r\nof San Blas, where the governor treated them with more consideration,\r\nand, though regarding them virtually as privateers, released them and\r\nsubmitted the fate of their ships to an official inquiry. The whole\r\ntruth of the Nootka incident will probably never be cleared up. What\r\nconcerns us here is the impression produced on Pitt by the statements\r\nof Meares. They were set forth in a Memorial, dated London, 30th April\r\n1790. Meares laid stress on the perfidy and cruelty of Martinez, and\r\nestimated his own losses at 500,000 Spanish dollars, apart from the\r\nruin of the trade along the Nootka coast.[913]\r\n\r\nReports of these events filtered through to London very slowly. Merry,\r\nBritish _chargé d’affaires_ at Madrid, sent the first vague rumours of\r\nthem in a despatch which, as we have seen, reached Whitehall on 21st\r\nJanuary; but the situation became fraught with danger on 11th February,\r\nwhen the Spanish envoy in London handed in a despatch drawn up in terms\r\nno less haughty than misleading. After presenting a distorted view of\r\nthe Nootka incident, del Campo asserted the right of Spain to absolute\r\nsovereignty in those districts “which have been occupied and frequented\r\nby the Spaniards for so many years.” He further requested the British\r\nGovernment to punish such undertakings as those of Meares and Colnett,\r\nbut closed with the statement that the British prisoners had been\r\nliberated through the consideration which the King of Spain had for His\r\nBritannic Majesty.\r\n\r\nCompliance with this demand was, of course, out of the question, for\r\nit would have implied the closing of the north-west coast of America\r\nto every flag but the red and yellow ensign of Spain; and the request\r\nfor the punishment of British seamen, whose ships had admittedly\r\nbeen seized, added insult to injury. Pitt and his colleagues as yet\r\nknew very little of the facts of the case. The dimness of the notions\r\nthen entertained about that region appears in a phrase used by Robert\r\nListon, our envoy at Stockholm, that the waters behind Nootka Sound\r\nmay be the opening to the long-sought North-West Passage.[914] In any\r\ncase the demands of Spain carried with them their own condemnation.\r\nAccordingly, on 26th February, the Duke of Leeds replied to del Campo\r\nthat the act of violence committed by Martinez “makes it necessary\r\nhenceforth to suspend all discussion of the pretensions set forth in\r\nthat letter until a just and adequate satisfaction shall have been made\r\nfor a proceeding so injurious to Great Britain.”[915]\r\n\r\nThe writing here was that of Leeds, but the resolve was the resolve of\r\nPitt. The original draft of this despatch is in the handwriting of the\r\nPrime Minister. As at so many crises, he took the conduct of affairs\r\ndirectly into his own hands; and Leeds, though he doubtless agreed with\r\nhim, was only his mouthpiece. George III and Pitt were equally desirous\r\nof peace; but on this occasion their determination was immutable.\r\nSatisfaction must be given for the insult, or else war must ensue. In\r\nhis despatch of the same date to Merry at Madrid, the Duke stoutly\r\ncontested the right of Spain to the exclusive sovereignty, commerce,\r\nand navigation of the coasts north of California, and asserted the\r\ndetermination of the Court of St. James to protect its subjects trading\r\nin that part of the Pacific Ocean.[916]\r\n\r\nWhen the facts stated on oath by Meares were known by Ministers, they\r\nrealized the extreme gravity of the case. Their demand for satisfaction\r\nhaving been ignored by the Court of Madrid,[917] they determined, at a\r\nCabinet Council held on the evening of 30th April, to demand “immediate\r\nand adequate satisfaction for the outrages committed by Mr. de\r\nMartinez,” and to back up that demand by the equipment of several ships\r\nof the line. George III agreed with his Ministers, though with some\r\nreluctance; and the press-gang set to work on 4th May to man the new\r\nsquadron. The affair came as a bolt from the blue. Most of the sailors\r\nin the Thames were seized; and the prospect of war caused Consols to\r\ndrop three per cent. Ministers, however, were justified in taking this\r\nstep. After the Spanish note of 20th April they saw that Spain would\r\nnot renounce her exclusive right to the Pacific Coast of America save\r\nunder pressure of force.[918] The question of peace or war turned on\r\ntwo things; the relative naval strength of the two Powers, and the\r\nability of the Court of Madrid to gain an ally, presumably France.\r\n\r\nDeferring for the present the question of the Franco-Spanish Alliance,\r\nwe notice that on sea Great Britain had a decided superiority over\r\nSpain. Though the Spanish marine was far from weak it could not cope\r\nwith the imposing force which the care and energy of Pitt had amassed\r\nat our dockyards. As has been pointed out in Chapter IX, he frequently\r\ninspected the details of construction, and held the Comptroller of the\r\nNavy personally responsible to him for the due progress of new ships\r\nand the efficiency of the fleet. Thanks to his close supervision, and\r\nthe large sums voted for the navy, there were at this time no fewer\r\nthan ninety-three sail of the line fit for active service.[919]\r\n\r\nThis gratifying result cannot be ascribed to the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty. In July 1788, on the resignation of Lord Howe, Pitt raised\r\nhis brother, Lord Chatham, to that responsible post, Lord Hood being\r\nadded to the Admiralty Board. Chatham was personally popular but proved\r\nto be indolent as an administrator, his unpunctuality earning him the\r\nnickname of “the late Lord Chatham.” That excellent administrator, Sir\r\nCharles Middleton (the future Lord Barham), refused to serve under him\r\nafter the reforms recommended by a Commission of Inquiry were shelved,\r\nand in March 1790 resigned office, pointing out, however, that the\r\nNavy and dockyards were never better prepared for war.[920]\r\n\r\nDespite the formidable strength of the British navy, Spain might have\r\nentered on a contest with some chance of success. We are apt to forget\r\nthat her period of swift decline under Charles IV had only just begun.\r\nHis predecessor, Charles III, who died in 1788, had raised the credit\r\nand power of that land almost to the lofty heights of ancient days. He\r\nhad helped to humble the might of England in the American war, and his\r\narmy and navy were kept in a state of efficiency which enabled Spain to\r\nrank as one of the Great Powers. On his death there came an insidious\r\nchange. In place of vigour and even-handed justice there crept in\r\nall the evils linked with sloth and favouritism. The statesman Count\r\nFloridablanca, who had done much to promote the prosperity of Spain,\r\nsaw his influence sapped by the intrigues of the minions of the Queen,\r\nwho was to be the evil genius of the realm. But in the year 1790 the\r\ndry-rot had not appreciably affected that imposing fabric. Outwardly\r\nSpain appeared to be almost a match for the Island Power. Towards the\r\nend of July 1790, she had at sea thirty-four sail of the line and\r\nsixteen smaller craft.[921]\r\n\r\nThe pride of two of the most susceptible nations having been touched to\r\nthe quick, war seemed inevitable. On 10th May Pitt moved for a vote of\r\ncredit of a million sterling for the necessary armament; this was at\r\nonce agreed to.[922] Parliament also supported the Ministry by large\r\nmajorities whenever the Opposition attempted to censure their action\r\non points of detail. Several pamphlets appeared inveighing against the\r\nmonstrous claims of Spain to the control of the Pacific. There was\r\na weak point in her armour, and at this Pitt aimed a deadly shaft.\r\nAlready the Spaniards of South and Central America were restive under\r\nthe galling yoke of their colonial system, which was so contrived as\r\nto enrich officials and privileged merchants in Spain at the expense\r\nof the new lands. The result was that at Quito a pound of iron sold\r\nfor 4_s._ 6_d._, and a pound of steel for 6_s._ 9_d._[923] It is not\r\nsurprising that the stoutest spirits longed to break loose from a\r\nGovernment by comparison with which that of England in the United\r\nStates had been mildness and wisdom personified.\r\n\r\nThe mouthpiece of the discontent of the land now called Venezuela was\r\na man of strongly marked personality, Miranda by name. An exile from\r\nhis native city of Caracas, he had spent several years wandering about\r\nEurope, until the events at Paris drew him to that focus of enthusiasm\r\nand effort. There he became acquainted with Brissot and others who\r\nwere interested in the emancipation of subject peoples. But now the\r\nprospect of a war between England and Spain attracted him to London.\r\nPitt invited him to a first interview on the evening of 9th May. The\r\ndaring adventurer there unfolded his plan of revolutionizing Spanish\r\nAmerica; and, in case of war, his commanding personality and intrepid\r\nspirit would have stirred up a serious ferment. Here was a formidable\r\nweapon against Spain; and Pitt in the course of several interviews\r\nwith Miranda prepared to use it with effect. Hopes ran high in London\r\nthat Spain would be crippled by the action of her own sons in the\r\nNew World, a fitting return to her for assisting the revolt of the\r\nEnglish colonists a decade before. Auckland, our envoy at The Hague,\r\nwrote on 29th June 1790: “It is believed there are serious troubles\r\nin South America; but that circumstance seems to afford the strongest\r\nreason for avoiding a quarrel with England. It is wonderful to a cool\r\nbystander to see with what infatuated alacrity several sovereigns are\r\nrunning towards the embarrassments which have brought Louis XVI and his\r\ndominions to the distracted and desperate state in which we now see\r\nthem.”[924]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pitt and Leeds had nailed their colours to the mast in the\r\ndespatch of 4th May, which dismissed the reply of the Spanish Court,\r\ndated 20th April, as wholly inadmissible. By way of retort to its claim\r\nof exclusive possession of the seas and coasts north of California\r\nup to latitude 60°, the British Government asserted for its subjects\r\nin those parts the “unquestioned right to a free and undisturbed\r\nenjoyment of the benefits of commerce, navigation, and fishery, and\r\nalso to the possession of such establishments as they may form, with\r\nthe consent of the natives, in places unoccupied by other European\r\nnations.”[925] In this declaration lies the charter of the future\r\ncolony of British Columbia. Alleyne Fitzherbert, who had already had a\r\ncreditable record in diplomacy, now proceeded on a special mission to\r\nMadrid to make good these claims, if possible by peaceable means. Among\r\nthe twenty-two “Instructions” is one bidding him weaken the Family\r\nCompact of 1761, which bound together the Kings of France and Spain in\r\nclose alliance, and point out to the Spanish Ministers the desirability\r\nof substituting for it a friendly understanding with Great Britain both\r\nin political and commercial affairs.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset Pitt and his colleagues realized that the question\r\nof peace or war depended largely on France. Had that Power been in a\r\ncondition to fight, the Bourbon States would certainly have contested\r\nEngland’s claim, and in that case she might have been for ever excluded\r\nfrom the Pacific Coast of America. Fitzherbert therefore stayed a few\r\ndays at Paris (an indisposition afforded a pretext for delay) in order\r\nto fathom those turbid waters. The foreign policy of France was still\r\nnominally in the hands of Montmorin; but that Minister, never strong,\r\nhad been almost cowed by events. Fitzherbert found him most gracious,\r\nbut he could not explain away the recent order for equipping fourteen\r\nsail of the line at Brest. The most threatening symptom, however, was\r\nthe warlike attitude of the royalist side of the National Assembly,\r\nwhich on 20th May he thus described to the Duke of Leeds:\r\n\r\n    ... I can plainly perceive that many other members of the\r\n    aristocratical faction are anxious to avail themselves of the\r\n    opportunity to bring on a war, in the hope that the general\r\n    distress and confusion which must almost inevitably follow, might\r\n    ultimately tend to the re-establishment of the royal authority upon\r\n    its former footing. Many strong indications of this design have\r\n    appeared in the insidious language which they have held of late,\r\n    speaking of Great Britain both in the National Assembly and without\r\n    doors. However, their opponents begin to be aware of their drift,\r\n    and it seems to have been principally with a view of guarding\r\n    against such designs that the latter have chosen the present time\r\n    for carrying into execution their plan of transferring the power\r\n    of making War and Peace from the Crown to the National Assembly.\r\n    It also appears highly probable that, when this question shall\r\n    be disposed of, it will be followed up by some motion tending to\r\n    invalidate, if not entirely to annul, the Family Compact.\r\n\r\nHow curiously the wheels of human action act and interact! The outrage\r\non British sailors on the dimly known coast of Vancouver Island\r\nfurnished French democrats with a potent motive for driving another\r\nnail into the coffin of the old monarchy. In any case the right of\r\nLouis XVI to declare war and make peace would have been challenged--for\r\nhow can Democracy allow a Sovereign wholly to control its policy at the\r\nmost important of all crises--but now the need was overwhelming. If\r\nthe old prerogative held good, the rusty link that bound together the\r\nfortunes of France and Spain would compel free Frenchmen to fight their\r\nEnglish neighbours whenever a Spanish captain thought fit to clap in\r\nirons British voyagers to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe question aroused gusts of passion at Paris. Enormous crowds waited\r\noutside the Tuileries while the deputies hard by were debating this\r\nquestion (16th and 22nd May). To the surprise of the people the royal\r\nprerogative was upheld by Mirabeau. The great orator descanted forcibly\r\non the need of energy and secrecy in the diplomacy of a great nation,\r\nand reminded those who ascribed all wars to the intrigues of Courts\r\nthat popular assemblies had often declared war in a fit of passion.\r\nHe remarked that members had all applauded a speaker who advocated\r\nwar against England if she attacked Spain, and the expenditure of\r\ntheir last man and their last crown in reducing London.[926] Few of\r\nMirabeau’s speeches were more convincing. Nevertheless, on coming forth\r\nfrom the Chamber he was threatened with violence; and a pamphlet,\r\n“Great Treason of Count Mirabeau” was hawked about the streets. His\r\nreasoning, however, ensured the carrying of a compromise on 22nd May.\r\nThe right of declaring war and making peace was vested in the King:\r\nand war was to be decided only by a decree of the Legislature, on “the\r\nformal and necessary proposition of the King, and afterwards sanctioned\r\nby him.”[927] The position was thus left far from clear; and Camille\r\nDesmoulins, referring to the ups and downs of the debate, summarized\r\nit thus: “The question was decided, firstly, in favour of the nation,\r\nsecondly, in favour of the King; thirdly, in favour of both.” The\r\nroyalists were highly displeased. Their best speaker, Cazalès, declared\r\nthat nothing was now left to the monarchy--an exclamation which\r\nprobably revealed his disgust at the passing away of the opportunity of\r\na war with England.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pitt had worked hard to array his allies, Prussia and\r\nHolland, against Spain. In this he succeeded. In particular, he\r\noffered to the Dutch a considerable subsidy for arming a squadron as\r\nif for war. To this topic he referred in a letter of 18th May 1790,\r\nto Auckland. After informing him that the tellership of the Exchequer\r\nwould be reserved for him, or one of his sons, besides a pension of\r\n£2,000 a year on retirement, he continued thus:\r\n\r\n    I cannot help adding how much satisfaction I have felt in your\r\n    account of everything at The Hague. You have done us a most\r\n    essential service in bringing the States into a disposition to act\r\n    at the present moment with a dispatch so unusual to them. This\r\n    messenger carries instructions to you to engage for the expenses\r\n    which you have stated to be likely to be incurred for fitting out\r\n    ten sail-of-the-line. You will, I am sure, take care that the\r\n    expense shall not be swelled beyond what is really necessary;\r\n    but, if even a greater sum should be really wanting, we shall not\r\n    scruple to give it; and, if you find that they can go on to prepare\r\n    a still greater number of ships, it will be so much the better.\r\n    I can hardly form at present a conjecture of the event of our\r\n    preparations, as I can hardly conceive either that the Spaniards\r\n    will ultimately persist, or that they can have gone so far without\r\n    a determination not to recede. I hope we shall be able to send an\r\n    answer about the commercial treaty very soon.[928]\r\n\r\nPitt’s economy is here seen to be far removed from the pennywise and\r\npound-foolish kind. If necessary, he was prepared to lavish subsidies\r\non the Dutch, and on Prussia as well, in order to overawe Spain. The\r\nDuke of Leeds and he were of one mind as to the need of the most\r\nenergetic measures. On 2nd June the Duke wrote to him that the Spanish\r\nproposals were quite inadmissible, and that Great Britain could\r\nnot possibly accept “any measure short of a direct and unqualified\r\nsatisfaction for the insult.” Spain of course would refuse, and\r\ntherefore war must follow: it could not be avoided without disgrace\r\nto one side or the other.[929] This rigid attitude prepares us for the\r\npart which the Duke played in the dispute with Russia nine months later.\r\n\r\nIn this case Pitt agreed with him, apparently because the point at\r\nissue concerned our interests and our honour far more nearly. Indeed\r\nthe tone of the Spanish replies left small hope of peace. Count\r\nFloridablanca protested against the British demand that full reparation\r\nmust be made to the victims of Captain Martinez, before the Spanish\r\nclaims could be considered. “The Spanish Minister,” wrote Merry from\r\nMadrid on 24th May, “is persuaded that we have at all events taken\r\nthe resolution of breaking with this country.... Our tone of language\r\nto this Court he represents as insufferable, and while on his part\r\nhe still wishes to preserve peace, he seems to think that Spain will\r\nunavoidably be driven to the necessity of defending herself.” Spain, he\r\nadds, was arming twenty-five warships, and had already two squadrons at\r\nsea.[930]\r\n\r\nHer pretensions appear in the despatch of the Spanish Governor of\r\nMexico, dated Mexico, 11th May 1790. After stating that he had released\r\nthe “Argonaut” and “Princess Royal” in order to maintain harmony with\r\nEngland, he remarked that Martinez had “acted agreeably to the laws\r\nand royal ordinances, which not only absolutely prohibit any kind of\r\nnavigation, establishment, or commerce of foreigners on our South Sea\r\nCoasts of both Americas, but moreover strictly command they be looked\r\nupon as declared enemies, without considering such treatment a breach\r\nof national faith or contravention of the treaties of peace.” Whence it\r\nfollowed that Martinez might with impunity have hanged Meares, Colnett,\r\nand their crews on his yardarms. These claims were thus endorsed in the\r\nSpanish circular note of 4th June, which based them on the Treaty of\r\nUtrecht (1713):\r\n\r\n    It also appears that, in spite of the attempts of some adventurers\r\n    and pirates of various nations on the Spanish coasts of the said\r\n    South Sea and the adjacent islands, Spain has continued her\r\n    possession, recovering what has been endeavoured to be usurped from\r\n    her, and performing for this purpose the necessary reconnoitres\r\n    and voyages, by the means of which and of repeated acts she has\r\n    preserved her dominion, of which she has always established and\r\n    left signs, which reach to places the nearest to the Russian\r\n    establishments in that part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe efforts which the Court of Madrid then put forth at St. Petersburg\r\nand Vienna showed its resolve to concert a league against England in\r\nwhich Denmark was to be included. This scheme, as visionary as the\r\ngrandiose dreams of Alberoni, caused our Ministers some concern, until\r\nthey found that their Allies, Prussia and Holland, were resolved to\r\nsupport them. On 20th May Hertzberg assured Ewart, that Prussia would\r\nfulfil her engagements, if Spain pushed matters to extremes.[931]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for a time everything portended war. Fitzherbert, after\r\nreaching Aranjuez on 10th June, became convinced that Floridablanca,\r\nfor all his peaceful assurances, intended to force a rupture at the\r\nfirst favourable opportunity. The Spanish Court absolutely refused\r\nto grant satisfaction for the injury done to Meares and Colnett,\r\nbecause that would imply the right of British subjects to be at\r\nNootka.[932] For the very same reason the Pitt Cabinet pressed its\r\npreliminary demand. It also brushed aside the Spanish pretensions\r\nof sole sovereignty on the Nootka coasts, because British and other\r\nseamen had for some little time traded there--an assertion difficult to\r\nmaintain.[933]\r\n\r\nThe deadlock was therefore complete; and, if Spain could have looked\r\nforward to help either from France, Russia, or Austria, war would\r\ninevitably have ensued. It is of interest to observe that, as the\r\ncrisis became acute, Pitt adopted his usual habit of writing the drafts\r\nof the most important despatches; and they were sent off without\r\nalteration. He thus disposed of the suggestion of Floridablanca, that\r\nthe whole matter in dispute should be settled by arbitration. “Your\r\nExcellency will not be surprised that they are such as cannot be\r\nadopted. The idea of an arbitration upon a subject of this nature\r\nmust be entirely out of the question; and a reservation such as\r\nthat contained in the second proposal would render the satisfaction\r\nnugatory, as it would refer to subsequent discussion the very ground on\r\nwhich that satisfaction is demanded.”[934]\r\n\r\nThe outlook was not brightened by the suggestion of Floridablanca,\r\nthat Spain should keep the whole of the coast from California up to\r\nand including Nootka; that from that inlet northwards to 61°, British\r\nand Spaniards should have conjointly the right of trading and forming\r\nestablishments; and that British sailors should enjoy certain fishery\r\nrights in the South Sea on uninhabited islands far removed from Spanish\r\nsettlements.[935] These proposals seemed, as they doubtless were, a\r\ndevice to gain time until France, Austria, or Russia could step forth\r\nand help Spain; and Pitt refused to admit these “chimerical claims\r\nof exclusive sovereignty over the American Continent and the seas\r\nadjacent,” which were to Spain herself “rather matter of useless pride\r\nthan of actual advantage.”[936] Towards the end of July more peaceful\r\ncounsels prevailed at Madrid, probably because the weak and luxurious\r\nKing, Charles IV, disliked war, and dreaded contact with Revolutionary\r\nFrance. Further it must have transpired that Russia and Austria, owing\r\nto their war with Turkey, were not likely to give more than good wishes\r\nto Spain. Either for these reasons, or because he hoped that delay\r\nwould tell in favour of Spain, Floridablanca signed with Fitzherbert\r\non 24th July a Declaration that Spain would give satisfaction for the\r\nseizure of British vessels and their cargoes at Nootka. On 5th August\r\nGrenville informed the King of this auspicious turn of affairs.[937]\r\n\r\nBut now, while the Court of Madrid abated its pretensions, French\r\npatriots began to rattle the sword in the scabbard. For reasons which\r\nare hard to fathom, the Spanish request for armed assistance, which\r\nreached Paris on 16th June, was not presented to the National Assembly\r\nuntil 2nd August. On that day Montmorin informed the deputies of the\r\ncontinuance of naval preparations in England, and declared that,\r\nunless French aid were accorded to Spain, she would seek an ally\r\nelsewhere. The statement was well calculated to awaken jealousy of\r\nEngland; and members came to the conclusion that the islanders were\r\nseeking, in the temporary weakness of France, to bully the Court of\r\nMadrid out of its just rights. Consequently the whole matter was\r\nreferred to the newly appointed Diplomatic Committee which supervised\r\nthe work of the Foreign Office.[938] As this body now practically\r\ncontrolled French diplomacy, everything became uncertain; and it is not\r\nsurprising that Pitt and Leeds declined to disarm now that the question\r\nof peace or war depended on an emotional Assembly and its delegates.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this new controlling body was Mirabeau. As Reporter of\r\nthe Committee he held a commanding position, which was enhanced by his\r\nsplendid eloquence, forceful personality, and knowledge of the shady\r\nby-paths of diplomacy. The Report which he presented to the Assembly\r\non 25th August was, in effect, his. While minimizing the importance of\r\nthe Nootka dispute, scoffing at the old diplomacy, and declaring that\r\nEurope would not need any diplomacy when there were neither despots\r\nnor slaves, he yet proposed that, pending the advent of that glorious\r\nage, France must not abrogate her treaties but continue to respect\r\nthem until they had been subjected to revision. Further, in place of\r\nthe Family Compact of the Kings of France and Spain, he proposed to\r\nsubstitute a National Compact, based on the needs of the two nations.\r\nOn the following day he continued his speech and moved that France\r\nand Spain should form a national treaty in the interests of peace\r\nand conformable to “the principles of justice which will ever form\r\nthe policy of the French.” What was far more significant, he himself\r\nadded a rider for the immediate armament of forty-five sail of the\r\nline and a proportionate number of smaller vessels. This was carried\r\nimmediately.[939]\r\n\r\nSeeing that the Assembly passed this vote at the very time when\r\nthe terrible mutiny at Nancy was at its height, the feelings of the\r\ndeputies must have been of the bellicose order which Mirabeau had\r\npreviously deprecated. Despite the pressing need for peace, France\r\nseemed to be heading straight for war. On ordinary grounds her conduct\r\nis inexplicable. Everywhere her troops were clamouring for arrears\r\nof pay; her sailors could scarcely be kept together; and the virtual\r\nbankruptcy of the State was a week later to be quaintly revealed by the\r\nflight of Necker to Switzerland. The King and his Ministers disapproved\r\nthe arming of so large a fleet; for Montmorin confessed to Gower his\r\nsurprise and regret, adding the comforting assurance that it would\r\nbe done as slowly as possible. The mystery deepens when we know that\r\nFloridablanca continued to speak in peaceful tones. On 19th August he\r\nadmitted to Fitzherbert that he desired help from Russia and Austria,\r\nbut felt complete indifference as to what France might do. Aid from\r\nher, he said, would lead to the introduction of democratic principles,\r\nwhich he was determined to keep out, if need arose, by a cordon along\r\nthe frontier, as one would exclude the plague.[940]\r\n\r\nHere probably we have the key to the enigma. The recent action of\r\nMirabeau (for the arming of the French naval force was his proposal,\r\nnot Montmorin’s) rested on the assumption that Spain did not mean\r\nto draw the sword. His agents at the various Courts kept him well\r\nabreast of events, and doubtless he foresaw that Charles IV’s hatred of\r\ndemocracy would bar the way to an alliance of the two peoples such as\r\nwas now projected. Why, then, should Mirabeau have threatened England\r\nwith war? His reasons seem to have been partly of a patriotic, partly\r\nof a private, nature. He desired to restore the prestige of the French\r\nmonarchy by throwing its sword into the wavering balances of diplomacy.\r\nAs to the expense, it was justifiable, if it tended to revive the\r\nnational spirit and to quell the mutinous feelings of the sailors.\r\nWork, especially if directed against “the natural enemy,” would be\r\nthe best restorative of order at the dockyards, and prevent the\r\ndeterioration of the navy. But apart from these motives Mirabeau may\r\nhave been swayed by others of a lower kind. His popularity had swiftly\r\nwaned during the previous debates. He might revive it by pandering\r\nto the dislike of England now widely prevalent. Manufacturers who\r\nsuffered by English competition and Chauvinists who dreaded her\r\nsupremacy at sea were joining in a hue and cry against Pitt;[941] and\r\nMirabeau gained credit by posing as the national champion. Further,\r\nby holding peace and war, as it were, in the folds of his toga, he\r\nenhanced his value in the diplomatic market. His corruptibility was\r\nnotorious. Even the sums which he drew from the King were far from\r\nmeeting the yawning gulf of his debts.\r\n\r\nIn the present case there was much to tempt him to political\r\nauctioneering. There were present in Paris two political agents to\r\nwhom Pitt had confided the task of humouring the French democrats\r\nand dissolving the Family Compact. These were William Augustus Miles\r\nand Hugh Elliot. The former was a clever but opinionated man, half\r\nstatesman, half busy-body, capable of doing good work when kept well in\r\nhand, but apt to take the bit into his teeth and bolt. He had already\r\nlooked into the affairs of Brabant, Liége, and Frankfurt for Pitt; and\r\nas early as 4th March the Prime Minister summoned him to Downing Street\r\nfor the purpose of sending him to Paris; but not till the middle of\r\nJuly did he finally entrust to him the task of inducing French deputies\r\nto annul the Family Compact. That this was to be done secretly appears\r\nfrom the order that he was to have no dealings whatever with the\r\nBritish Embassy.[942] Unfortunately the letters which passed between\r\nPitt and Miles at this time have all been destroyed.[943] But we know\r\nfrom other sources that Miles was charged to prepare the way for an\r\nAnglo-French _entente_. He certainly made overtures to Talleyrand,\r\nMirabeau, and Lafayette; he was also elected a member of the Jacobins\r\nClub, and worked hard to remove the prejudices against England. These\r\nhe found exceedingly strong, all the troubles in the fleet being\r\nascribed to her. By 11th October he had fulfilled his mission, and\r\ninformed George Rose that Pitt might, if he chose, form a close working\r\nalliance with the French nation. About the same time he conceived for\r\nMirabeau the greatest contempt, and asserted that it was “impossible to\r\nknow him and not to despise him.”[944]\r\n\r\nElliot was a man of far higher stamp than Miles. As we have seen, he\r\nhad had a distinguished diplomatic career, and might be termed the\r\nsaviour of Gustavus III in the acute crisis of 1788. He was brother of\r\nSir Gilbert Elliot (first Earl of Minto), and of Lady Auckland. In the\r\nsummer of 1790 he was home on furlough. On 7th August he wrote from\r\nBeckenham, Auckland’s residence, congratulating Pitt on a favourable\r\nturn in the Spanish dispute. When the outlook once more darkened he\r\nrequested leave to go to Paris in order to use his influence with his\r\nfriend, Mirabeau, in the interests of peace. Pitt must have referred\r\nthe proposal to the King, and received a very guarded reply, dated\r\nWindsor, 26th October. George enjoined great caution, as we had\r\nhitherto held entirely aloof from the French troubles, and must on no\r\naccount be mixed up in them. Yet, for the sake of peace, he did not\r\nobject to this attempt, so long as it was entirely unofficial; but\r\nhe was “not sanguine that Mr. H. Elliot and his French friend” would\r\nsucceed where so much caution and delicacy were necessary.[945]\r\n\r\nAs this affair is wrapped in mystery, and concerns not only the peace\r\nof the world, but also that most interesting personality, Mirabeau, the\r\ndraft of an undated letter of Pitt to the King must be quoted in full:\r\n\r\n    Mr. P. takes the liberty of submitting to your Majesty’s Perusal\r\n    two private letters which he received to-day from Paris, one\r\n    from Lord Gower, and the other from Mr. H. Elliot. The latter\r\n    went thither a short time since, principally from curiosity, but\r\n    previous to his departure, mentioned to Mr. P. that he had formerly\r\n    happened to be in habits of much intimacy with M. de Mirabeau,\r\n    and might probably have an opportunity of learning something from\r\n    him respecting the views of the prevailing party in France on the\r\n    subject of the discussions with Spain. Mr. P. recommends to him to\r\n    be very cautious not to commit anybody by his conversation, but to\r\n    endeavour to find out whether there was any chance of making them\r\n    see in a just light the nature of our disputes with Spain, and of\r\n    thereby preventing or delaying their taking a part in the war, if\r\n    it should take place.\r\n\r\n    The suggestions in Mr. Elliot’s letter seem to furnish matter for\r\n    much consideration; possibly there may be found means of improving\r\n    this opening to some advantage with a view to preserving or\r\n    restoring peace, or to retarding the succours which France might\r\n    furnish to Spain.[946]\r\n\r\nThis letter is undated. George III’s missive of 26th October seems to\r\nbe a reply to it or to one very like it. But Pitt’s letter implies the\r\nreceipt of Gower’s and Elliot’s despatches of 26th October. I have\r\nfound no other despatch from Gower enclosing one from Elliot except of\r\nthat date. Four days previously Gower had written to Pitt:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Elliot’s communication with Mr. de Mirabeau has been more\r\n    successful than I imagined it was likely to be: it has procured\r\n    an easy means of maintaining a good understanding between His\r\n    Majesty’s Ministers and the prevailing party in the National\r\n    Assembly, if such a correspondence should be found necessary.[947]\r\n\r\nIn the letter of 26th October Gower informed Pitt:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Elliot has brought the prevailing party in this country to act\r\n    according to their true interest; and, if they meet with proper\r\n    encouragement from you, they seem ready to go any lengths towards\r\n    enforcing our claims with regard to Spain; and they are, I believe,\r\n    sincere in their desire to promote a real and effectual good\r\n    understanding between the two countries. I shall be extremely happy\r\n    to co-operate with Mr. Elliot in a negotiation which appears to me\r\n    so desirable.[948]\r\n\r\nThe words “proper encouragement” _donnent furieusement à penser_.\r\nElliot in a long letter of 26th October, recounted his interview with\r\na deputation from the Diplomatic Committee, and his success in winning\r\nit over to the British side. In the former of two paragraphs, which\r\nare omitted by Earl Stanhope,[949] Elliot describes the promise given\r\nhim by the Committee, that, even if Spain went to war, and formally\r\ndemanded the aid of France, such aid would not be forthcoming until\r\nthe British case had been fully investigated. The second of the two\r\npassages deserves quotation in full. It occurs near the end of the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n    What has taken place in my more intimate conversations with\r\n    individuals cannot be committed to paper. But I have every reason\r\n    to believe that I am more master of the secret springs of action\r\n    here than anybody else could have been. Everything I have either\r\n    said or done has always been previously concerted and has ever\r\n    answered my most sanguine expectations.... I am inclined to believe\r\n    that, after the disturbances at Brest are known at Madrid, the\r\n    Spaniards will make peace rather than expose their fleets to any\r\n    junction with French ships.[950]\r\n\r\nThe hints here given imply that Mirabeau, and probably other patriots\r\nas well, accepted British money, but both our envoys were discreet\r\nenough to give few details in writing. It is quite probable that\r\nMirabeau first accepted Spanish gold for procuring the vote for the\r\narming of forty-five French sail of the line, and then accepted an\r\nequivalent sum from Miles or Elliot for the decree which rendered that\r\nstep innocuous. His control over the Assembly was scarcely less than\r\nMontmorin’s;[951] and that nervous Minister would certainly welcome\r\na course of action which enhanced the prestige of France, and yet\r\naverted all risk of war. Nevertheless, Pitt did not set much store\r\nby the help of Mirabeau. He decided to bring the whole dispute to an\r\nimmediate issue, without waiting for the issue of the golden proposals\r\nof Elliot and Miles. Possibly he heard from other sources that France\r\nwould do no more than rattle the sword in the scabbard; or else he was\r\nemboldened by the marked success and zeal attending the British naval\r\npreparations, the mutinies in the French fleet, the readiness of our\r\nAllies to play their part, and the unreadiness of Spain. A brief survey\r\nof these considerations will reveal the grounds of his confidence.\r\n\r\nThe chance of hostilities with the two Bourbon Courts was threatening\r\nenough to call forth all the energies of the race. Through the months\r\nof August, September, and October naval preparations went on with\r\nthe utmost vigour. Officers and men vied with one another in zeal to\r\nequip and man the ships with all possible speed and thoroughness. Sir\r\nJohn Jervis afterwards assured the House of Commons that he had seen\r\ncaptains paying out their own money by hundreds of pounds in order to\r\nexpedite the equipment; others sailed their ships down Channel with\r\nmere skeleton crews in order to hasten the rally at Plymouth; and by\r\ndint of drills from sunrise to sunset the crews were hardened to their\r\nwork.[952] In truth, the dominant fact of the situation was England’s\r\noverwhelming supremacy at sea over Spain, and possibly over Spain and\r\nFrance together.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Alliance also proved to be a reality. The prospect of a war\r\nwith Spain was, of course, distasteful both at Berlin and The Hague;\r\nbut our Allies admitted that Spain was the aggressor, and signified\r\ntheir readiness to support us. This should be noted, for it imposed\r\non Pitt a debt of honour to support Prussia when her summons for\r\nhelp against the Czarina arrived at Whitehall in the month of March\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nFurther, the ambitions of the Czarina already threatened the\r\nequilibrium of Europe; and in this fact we find the last, and perhaps\r\nthe most cogent, of the reasons why Pitt and his colleague resolved to\r\nhave done with the Spanish dispute before the Eastern Question came to\r\na crisis. This appears very clearly in Leeds’ despatch of 2nd October\r\nto our ambassador at Madrid, which was in effect an ultimatum to that\r\nCourt. He warned Fitzherbert that the Spanish proposals were quite\r\ninadmissible, and that “neither the circumstances of the negotiation,\r\nnor the relative situation of the two countries and of other Powers\r\nin Europe can allow of any further delay”; he therefore pressed for\r\nthe immediate acceptance of the British demands. An explanatory note\r\naccompanied the ultimatum, stating that Spain ought to desire the\r\npreservation of the existing system in Europe, which was threatened\r\nsolely by the Empress Catharine, who spurned the counsels of moderation\r\noffered by the Allies.[953]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the threatening aspect of affairs in the East\r\nin part accounts for Pitt’s sudden and imperious demand. He resolved\r\nto finish with Spain so as to have his hands free for the Eastern\r\nQuestion. As appeared in an earlier chapter, the Czarina, Catharine II,\r\nhad recently concluded peace with Sweden; and, despite the promised\r\nnegotiations of the Viennese Court for peace with the Turks, she seemed\r\ndetermined to press them hard, and to wring from them a district then\r\ndeemed necessary to the defence of the Ottoman Power. Her dalliance\r\nwith Spain was far from serious; but she might, if allowed time,\r\nconcert a formidable league against England. The voice of prudence,\r\ntherefore, counselled the immediate coercion of Spain, while Russia was\r\nentangled in a still doubtful strife. Machiavelli shrewdly remarked\r\nthat “the Romans never swallowed an injury to put off a war; for they\r\nknew that war was not avoided but only deferred thereby, and commonly\r\nwith advantage to the enemy.”[954]\r\n\r\nBut Pitt needed not to go to Machiavelli. Facts spoke more convincingly\r\nthan words to a nature like his; and the news from Paris and Madrid\r\ncalled aloud for a display of energy. The insubordination at the French\r\ndockyards and the news from Paris had told on the nervous and pedantic\r\nKing of Spain. On 16th September Fitzherbert wrote to the Duke of Leeds\r\nthat that monarch had very decidedly expressed his resolve never to\r\nhave an alliance with France on the basis of a National Compact as\r\nproposed by Mirabeau. It appears, then, that the great orator had a\r\ndecisive effect in working on the fears and scruples of His Catholic\r\nMajesty, and thus assuring the isolation of Spain. If Mirabeau received\r\nBritish money from Miles and Elliot a month or so later, he might\r\nclaim it as payment for valuable services already rendered. However\r\nthat may be, it is certain that Pitt, on receiving the glad news\r\nfrom Fitzherbert on 27th September, decided to take vigorous action.\r\nFitzherbert advised tact and patience in dealing with that proud Court;\r\nbut Pitt and Leeds waived aside the advice and resolved to thrust their\r\nadversary into a corner. In view of the more complaisant attitude of\r\nthe Spanish Government, their action was unchivalrous; but it was\r\njustified by the tidings which had arrived of cruelties perpetrated by\r\na Spanish warship on the captain of a English merchantman in the Gulf\r\nof Florida, who was set in the bilboes in the blazing sun.[955] Public\r\nopinion would certainly have supported Pitt in case of a rupture with\r\nan enemy whose claims and customs were still those of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; and he was resolved to end the dominion of Spain in the North\r\nPacific with as little ceremony as Cromwell had shown in his expedition\r\nagainst Jamaica in 1654.\r\n\r\nNow there was little fear of war. The pride of Charles IV centred in\r\ntrophies of the chase; and his weak and slothful nature revolted at\r\nthe thought of an alliance with France on Mirabeau’s terms. Moreover,\r\nRussia and Austria had paid little heed to the recent appeals of\r\nFloridablanca, and there was war with the Moors outside Tangier. Was\r\nnot this enough? For a few days the Council of Ministers breathed\r\nthreats of war. Floridablanca struggled hard against the relentless\r\ngrip which had closed around him. But he was helpless, and he knew it.\r\nTherefore on Sunday, 24th October, the Spanish Minister, after much\r\nangry remonstrance, gave way, and agreed to the British terms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pitt had allowed Fitzherbert to recede slightly on some of\r\nthe conditions, and urged that Spain should be invited to frame an\r\nalliance with us, both political and commercial. As usual, in affairs\r\nof great moment, he himself wrote the draft of this despatch, which\r\nwas sent off without alteration.[956] This skilful angling was of no\r\navail. Spanish pride was too deeply wounded to admit of any possibility\r\nof alliance, whether political or commercial, for many years to come.\r\nIn other respects Pitt gained his point; and the following letter to\r\nBishop Pretyman (Tomline) shows his relief at the end to the long\r\nstrain:\r\n\r\n                                      Thursday, _Nov. 4, 1790_.[957]\r\n\r\n    DEAR BISHOP,\r\n\r\n    The decisive answer arrived this morning and is perfectly\r\n    satisfactory. The Spanish Minister at last agreed, on the 24th of\r\n    October, to a _projet_ of a Convention containing all we wish, and\r\n    it was settled that it should be actually signed in three days from\r\n    that time. The terms will be found to secure all that we could\r\n    demand in justice, or had any reason to desire.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on 28th October 1790 (after four days, not three), the\r\nCourt of Madrid signed the Convention which opened up a new future for\r\nthe North Pacific. By it Spain agreed to restore the buildings and\r\nlands at Nootka to the British subjects whom Martinez had dispossessed.\r\nReparation was also to be made for any outrages committed by the\r\nsubjects of either Power against those of the other since April\r\n1789.[958] Britons and Spaniards were to have full liberty to trade in\r\nNorth-West America, that is, to the north of the Spanish settlements;\r\nbut of course all the coasts to the south of them were to remain closed\r\nas heretofore. Spain, however, conceded entire freedom of navigation\r\nand fishery in the Pacific Ocean and the South Seas, except that, in\r\norder to preclude all intercourse with her colonies, British ships were\r\nforbidden to approach within a limit of ten maritime leagues.\r\n\r\nThe British public greeted this happy issue of events with\r\ncharacteristic reserve. As Spain stood for commercial monopoly and\r\npolitical reaction, the rebuff dealt to her ought to have pleased the\r\nWhigs. But party rancour increased in proportion to Pitt’s success.\r\nHope deferred made the hearts of his opponents sick; and to this cause\r\nwe may attribute curiously acrid verdicts like that of Auckland’s\r\ncorrespondent, Storer, who exclaimed on 22nd October, with the\r\njauntiness of ignorance: “Here we are, going to war, and for what?\r\nA place, the name of which I can scarcely pronounce, never heard of\r\ntill lately, and which did not exist till t’other day. Pitt is tired\r\nof peace. He bullied France so effectually three years ago that he is\r\ndetermined to try the same thing with Spain.” Storer also says that\r\nour officers were in high spirits at the idea of a voyage to _Mexico_,\r\nand were buying Ulloa’s “Voyage” so as to study the _South Sea_\r\ncoasts.[959] Whence it would appear that geography was not a strong\r\npoint with Storer, and that in his eyes wars were worth waging only on\r\nbehalf of well-known names. How curiously parochial is this habit of\r\nmind. Yet Pitt was destined soon to find out its self-assertiveness\r\nand tenacity in the case of another un-euphonious and dimly-known\r\nplace--Oczakoff.\r\n\r\nThe insular, matter-of-fact way in which the House of Commons viewed\r\nPitt’s diplomatic triumph received apt illustration in the debate of\r\n14th December, when Duncombe and Alderman Watson moved and seconded a\r\nresolution of thanks to His Majesty for the Convention with Spain. They\r\ndwelt on the advantages of the peaceful settlement which it secured,\r\nand augured well for the increase of British trade to the South Seas.\r\nBut Pulteney declared that we had won too much from Spain, and should\r\never feel her ill will. Besides, a Pacific whale was worth only £90,\r\nas against £170 for a Greenland whale. Alderman Curtis fell foul of\r\nthese statements in a maiden speech “which possessed all the blunt\r\ncharacteristics of commercial oratory.” He said that he himself was\r\na fisherman, and gloried in the character. He rejoiced to state that\r\nmore ships than ever before were now fitting out for whaling in the\r\nPacific; and he himself had sold Pacific whale-oil for £50 a ton,\r\nwhile the Greenland oil fetched only £18 or £19 a ton. Mr. (afterwards\r\nEarl) Grey sought to raise the debate from these blubbery platitudes\r\nto the levels of diplomacy; and, differing from his friend Pulteney,\r\ncensured the Convention because it gained us nothing; for it laid down\r\nno definite limits in those new lands, and it granted us access to\r\nthem conjointly with the Spaniards. Consequently, where our traders\r\nsettled on one hill, the Spaniards might build a fort on another close\r\nby. Windham then censured Ministers because they had secured neither\r\nadequate reparation to our outraged honour nor definite rights to our\r\ntraders. Thereupon a General Smith opined that the Convention was of no\r\nadvantage to us, because the people of Nootka Sound were “a species of\r\ncannibals.” In other respects it was “disgraceful to the real interests\r\nof the country”--an assertion which Rolle and Ryder proceeded to\r\nrefute, on the ground that the result had been well worth the three and\r\na half millions spent on naval preparations. (In reality the sum was\r\n£2,821,000.)\r\n\r\nFox also wandered deviously until he caught at a possible clue, that\r\noffended honour was the only justifiable cause for war. In this case,\r\nhe declared, Ministers had not gained for us due reparation. It fell\r\ninfinitely short of what was obtained in the dispute about the Falkland\r\nIslands in 1771.[960] Further, we now gained no material advantage from\r\nSpain; for British ships had sailed into the South Seas despite the\r\nSpanish laws; and the receipts from that trade had grown in five years\r\nfrom £12,000 to £97,000. (He omitted to state that previously that\r\ntrade had been killed by the war with Spain.) He next asserted that\r\nwe secured little or nothing in the North Pacific, because the limits\r\nof Spanish America were still left vague, and we gave up the right of\r\nsettlement on the coasts of South America. In fact, the treaty was\r\none of concessions, not of acquisitions. This, he added, was on a par\r\nwith our foreign policy as a whole; for our new ally, Sweden, had come\r\nto terms with Russia behind our backs, thus lowering us in the eyes\r\nof the world; and we had failed to coerce Russia. “In our words was\r\nconfidence: in our acts was fear.”\r\n\r\nPitt in his reply had little difficulty in proving that the present\r\ncase differed entirely from that of the Falkland Islands, and that the\r\ntreaty secured for us trading rights which Spain had hitherto always\r\ncontested. There was therefore every ground for hoping for a great\r\nincrease of trade to the Pacific. The House agreed with him by 247\r\nvotes to 123. But in Pitt’s speech, as in the whole debate, we find no\r\nwide outlook on events. The arguments are of the Little Peddlington\r\ntype; and, after wandering through those teasing mazes, one feels a\r\nthrill of surprise that the British people ever came out into a large\r\nand wealthy place. The importance of Pitt’s triumph has received scant\r\nnotice at the hands of historians. Macaulay, in his brilliant sketch\r\nof Pitt’s career, dismissed the affair in the clause--“England armed,\r\nand Spain receded.” Lord Rosebery remarks that the settlement of the\r\naffair was honourable for England, and not dishonourable to Spain. Even\r\nStanhope and Lecky on their far ampler canvases merely described the\r\nterms of the settlement without revealing its momentous results.[961]\r\n\r\nFar different were the judgements of enlightened Spaniards. They\r\nsaw in the treaty of 28th October the beginning of the end of their\r\nworld-empire. The official Junta at Madrid protested vehemently against\r\nthe surrender on the ground that it “conceded to England what has\r\nalways been resisted and refused to all Powers since the discovery\r\nof the Indies.” Herein lies the significance of the Spanish defeat.\r\nTheir Empire rested on monopoly. It is little to the point to say that\r\nEnglish traders occasionally ventured into the Pacific. They did so\r\nat their peril; and the recent revival of Spanish power threatened\r\nto rivet once more the chains of privilege on that vast domain. Now\r\nthat they were shattered, the whole cramped system was doomed to fall.\r\nJust as the irruption of Cromwell’s fleet into the Spanish West Indies\r\nin 1654 sounded the knell of Spanish domination in those seas, so\r\ntoo the signing of this Convention presaged the end of their Empire\r\nin the Pacific. The advent of the Union Jack on equal terms with the\r\nred and yellow flag of Spain has always implied the retreat of the\r\nlatter. In religion, commerce, and political life the two ensigns\r\nrepresent ideals so utterly at variance that they cannot wave in\r\nfriendly neighbourhood. One or other must go: and the primacy of Pitt\r\nand Godoy sufficiently explains the advance of the one and the retreat\r\nof the other in the ensuing years. In one other respect the crisis was\r\nimportant. The British archives show that the Courts of Madrid and St.\r\nPetersburg were then making overtures which would probably have led to\r\nthe complete appropriation of that coast-line; and the interlocking of\r\nthose two rigid systems might have implied the exclusion for ever of\r\nthe British flag from the Pacific coast. No one, not even Pitt himself,\r\ncould foresee the rich harvest of results one day to be reaped from\r\nhis action in that summer and autumn. The winning of a few log huts\r\nat Nootka Sound seemed a small thing then. But in this age of the\r\ntriumphs of steam and electricity we can discern its importance in\r\nworld politics. The infant settlement on Vancouver Island, and on the\r\nmainland opposite, inspired the pioneers of Canada with hope as they\r\nthreaded their way through the passes of the Rockies and the Selkirks.\r\nPossibly one of them\r\n\r\n              like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes\r\n  He stared at the Pacific,\r\n\r\ncaught a glimpse of a strange future, when Canada, the child of\r\nRichelieu, would enter into the northern heritage of old Spain, and\r\nbecome a Pacific Power.\r\n\r\nAll this lay enfolded in the winning of that inlet. Nay, more. We can\r\nnow see that British Columbia holds in the West a strategic position\r\nnot unlike that of Egypt in the Orient. Both are vital links in our\r\nchain of communication. Pitt, could he have known it, helped to fashion\r\nthe keystone of the arch of Empire in the Occident. He played his part\r\nmanfully in preparing for a day when Canada would stretch hands across\r\nthe seas to India and Australia; when the vivifying forces of science\r\nand commerce would endow with a common life the conquests of Wolfe and\r\nClive, and the lands discovered by Captain Cook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPITT AND CATHARINE II\r\n\r\n                          Beware\r\n  Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,\r\n  Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee.\r\n\r\n                                SHAKESPEARE, _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the spring of the year 1791 Pitt had achieved a series of\r\nremarkable triumphs in his foreign policy. After lifting his country\r\nfrom the depths of penury and isolation, he seized favourable\r\nopportunities for checkmating French influence in Holland, and framing\r\nthe Triple Alliance with that Republic and the Kingdom of Prussia.\r\nDuring the years 1788–90 this alliance gave the law to Europe. It\r\nrescued Gustavus III from ruin; it prescribed terms to Austria at the\r\nConference of Reichenbach, and thereby saved the Turks from the gravest\r\ndanger; it served to restore the ancient liberties of the Brabanters\r\nand Flemings; it enabled England to overawe Spain and win the coast\r\nof the present colony of British Columbia; last, but not least, Pitt,\r\nby singular skill, thwarted the dangerous schemes of the Prussian\r\nstatesman Hertzberg at the expense of Poland.\r\n\r\nSuccesses like these are apt to beget feelings of jealousy or fear;\r\nfor gratitude rarely figures among the motives that determine the\r\ncourse of national policy. Certainly this is the case in the story now\r\nbefore us, which tells of a rebuff dealt to Pitt, the unweaving of\r\nhis plans for the equitable pacification of Europe, and the formation\r\nof new groupings which leave Great Britain isolated and her statesmen\r\ndiscredited. The importance of the crisis, and the light which it\r\nthrows on the peace-loving character of Pitt, warrant a closer\r\nexamination of details than has yet been given to the subject. We\r\nmust remember that at every emergency the British Foreign Office was\r\ndirected by Pitt, not by its chief, the Duke of Leeds. This appears in\r\na sentence of Ewart’s letter of 28th November 1790 to Lord Auckland--“I\r\ntrust Mr. Pitt will write to your lordship himself in a satisfactory\r\nmanner; and you know better than I do of what consequence the opinions\r\nof others are.” The imperious Minister was now to encounter a will as\r\ntough, and a pride as exacting, as his own. Catharine of Russia stood\r\nin his path, and defied him to apply to her his scheme of pacification,\r\nto which Leopold of Austria had yielded grudging assent.\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons why Pitt should expect from the Czarina a\r\nsimilar acquiescence. Her finances were utterly exhausted by four years\r\nof war. Her favourite, Prince Potemkin, had won victories; but he and\r\nhis dependents had battened on the Treasury, and her triumph heralded\r\nthe approach of bankruptcy. The plague was devastating her armies in\r\nthe south; and even Russia seemed unable to endure the waste of another\r\ncampaign. The Muscovites placed their hopes in a dash of their fleet\r\non Constantinople; but how could that be effected if England sent a\r\nstrong squadron into the Black Sea to help the Turks? And while she\r\nscreened the Moslem capital, the presence of her warships in the Baltic\r\nmust complete the ruin of the Baltic provinces. Two fifths of their\r\nexports by sea went to Great Britain; and they drew thence goods worth\r\n7,308,000 roubles as against 2,278,000 from all other lands.[962] The\r\ninternal state of Russia also gave cause for concern. The extravagance\r\nand licentiousness of the Court, flaunted in face of struggling traders\r\nand half-starved peasants, were a perpetual challenge to discontent;\r\nand the best informed observers believed that, if Prussia and England\r\nheld firm, the Empress must humble her pride and accept their terms.\r\nThey were by no means extravagant. Russia was to give up the conquests\r\nof the present war, particularly the lands east of the Pruth, which\r\nwere virtually in her hands; but she might retain the Crimea--the\r\nobject for which the Sultan had cast down the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when the British demands were nearing the banks of the\r\nNeva, victory crowned the efforts of the Russians on the Lower Danube.\r\nIsmail, the stronghold which commanded the only available entrance into\r\nTurkey, now that the Austro-Turkish armistice kept Wallachia neutral,\r\nfell before the prowess of the assailants (22nd December 1790). After\r\nsome successes against the Turkish flotilla and the batteries fringing\r\nthe river banks, Potemkin began the siege of the city itself; but\r\nits deep fosse, fed from the Danube, and its double line of ramparts\r\ndefied all his efforts. Then he bent his pride and sent for Suvóroff.\r\nThe advent of “the little father” put new heart into the 31,000\r\nbesiegers.--“To-day for prayer: to-morrow for drill: the next day\r\nvictory or a glorious death.”--By these words, and by the contagion of\r\nhis enthusiasm, he worked his men up to a pitch of fury. Skill came\r\nto reinforce their fanaticism. By night a strong flotilla dropped\r\ndown stream to assail the town on that side, while on the other six\r\ncolumns advanced stealthily against the walls. A sharp frost favoured\r\nthe enterprise; and under cover of a misty dawn the assailants rushed\r\nforward at all possible points. The defenders met fury with fury. A\r\nlong day of carnage ensued, the Moslems, men and women alike, fighting\r\ndesperately for creed, country, life, and honour. At last Suvóroff’s\r\nreserves gained a foothold and overwhelmed the exhausted garrison. Then\r\nensued a night of slaughter, plunder, and outrage. Some 30,000 Turks\r\nperished. The consequences of this victory were great. The hold of the\r\nSultan on the Danube was loosened, while the Russians prepared to deal\r\na blow at the heart of the Ottoman dominions. Thus, once again, the\r\npersonality of Suvóroff proved to be worth an army. Indeed, it changed\r\nthe course of history. For now, when the proud Empress held the keys\r\nof the Danube, how could she consent to give back to the infidels\r\nSuvóroff’s former conquest, Oczakoff? Diplomacy also furthered the aims\r\nof Catharine, and told against those of Pitt. Much depended on the good\r\nfaith of Leopold II in keeping his promises to the Triple Alliance,\r\npledged at the Conference of Reichenbach in July 1790. He had agreed to\r\naccept the _status quo ante bellum_ as a basis of settlement for his\r\ndisputes with the Belgians and for his war with Turkey. Now, nothing\r\nought to have been simpler than the restoration of his conquests to the\r\nPorte, provided that the plenipotentiaries of the Powers, who met at\r\nSistova late in 1790 to reduce them to treaty form, were inspired by\r\ngood faith and pacific desires.\r\n\r\nBut distrust and intrigue soon enveloped in mystery phrases that were\r\nclear as day. The Turks opposed to the superior force of Austria all\r\nthe chicanery of oriental delays. Their astrologers discovered that\r\nvery many days were unsuitable for the conduct of business; and their\r\nenvoys often fell ill. Hopes ran high at the Porte that England and\r\nPrussia would draw the sword against the Czarina. The Emperor Leopold\r\nand his equally wily Chancellor, Prince Kaunitz, also saw in delay an\r\nopportunity of wriggling out from the engagements so reluctantly made\r\nat Reichenbach.[963] Scarcely was the ink of that compact dry before\r\nKaunitz bemoaned to his envoy in London the lack of any conquests at\r\nthe end of “a ruinously expensive war.” This magnanimity he ascribed\r\nto his desire to be again on good terms with England, despite her\r\nunjust treatment of a once valued ally. After these crocodile tears\r\nthere came the significant suggestion--Would not England instruct her\r\nenvoy to deal leniently with Austria in the ensuing negotiations with\r\nthe Turks, and allow her to gain a few little advantages?[964] Leopold\r\nalso wrote to his offended ally, Catharine, assuring her that he would\r\nnever really make peace with the Turks until she had secured from them\r\nconquests proportionate to the successes of her troops. Let Austria\r\nand Russia keep in close touch and form an eternal compact.[965] Here,\r\nthen, we probe one of the causes of the defiant rejection by Catharine\r\nof Pitt’s demand for the _status quo_. He believed, and very naturally,\r\nthat the Austro-Russian alliance was wholly severed; while, in point of\r\nfact, Austria was secretly, but effectively, playing the game of her\r\nlate ally.[966]\r\n\r\nBut there was another cause of his failure. The Semiramis of the North\r\ncould at need abase her pride and clasp the hand of a hated foe. As\r\nwe have seen, she had grasped that of Gustavus III; but only for the\r\nmost potent of reasons. She saw in that vain and impulsive sovereign a\r\nconvenient tool, who might serve her well in case of a British naval\r\ndemonstration against Cronstadt. For some time the Swedish monarch held\r\nback his hand. Auckland wrote early in November 1790 that Gustavus\r\neither from vanity or from penury, might once more attack her; but the\r\nprice which he asked from the Allies was enormous:--“I am assured on\r\ngood authority that he talks of 10,000,000 rix dollars for the first\r\ncampaign, and 7,000,000 for every succeeding one.”[967] Rumour, then,\r\nsaw in Gustavus not merely a knight errant, but a shrewd bargainer;\r\nand we now know that he had come to some secret understanding with\r\nCatharine. By methods not very unusual in that age, the British Embassy\r\nat Stockholm managed to procure and decipher a letter of the Swedish\r\nmonarch to his envoy at London, Baron Nolcken, dated 7th December 1790.\r\nIn it he expressed regret and annoyance that England still kept a large\r\nfleet ready for service in the Baltic, and urged Nolcken to point\r\nout that the British ships would find great difficulty in procuring\r\nprovisions in that sea, as Sweden must refuse them.[968] The experience\r\nof our sailors, especially in the years 1810–11, has since corroborated\r\nthat statement.\r\n\r\nThis was not all. Gustavus was then revolving a grandiose project for\r\nthe invasion of Normandy by Swedish and Russian troops, in order to\r\ncrush the French Revolution. Catharine humoured the notion, more, it\r\nwould seem, with the aim of protecting herself from British warships\r\nthan of re-establishing Louis XVI;[969] for, as was often to appear,\r\nher royalist heroics never led to definite action. To the Tancred of\r\nthe North, however, her friendship seemed all important; and it was\r\ntherefore possible that, in the interests of monarchy, he might add his\r\nfleet to hers. Pitt had cause to fear such a hostile combination; for\r\non 11th February 1791 Ewart assured him that the Empress of Russia was\r\nconvinced, “since her peace with Sweden, that no British fleet could\r\noperate in the Baltic with any success, and that the [British] Minister\r\nwould risk the loss of his popularity by such an expedition.”[970] Her\r\nsurmise was to be justified by events. Nevertheless, Pitt cherished the\r\nhope of browbeating Russia; and, as the sequel will show, this would\r\nhave given to the hard-pressed Poles a precious time of reprieve. For\r\nit was not so much Turkey as Poland whose fortunes were at stake. The\r\nevents of the years 1791, 1792, virtually decided the doom of that\r\ninteresting people, and opened to the Muscovites the way into the heart\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in Chapter XXIII, the Prusso-Polish treaty of 29th March\r\n1790 spread dismay at Petersburg. But the lavish use of Russian\r\ngold among the ruck of the Polish nobles in the Diet at Warsaw soon\r\nstrengthened the anti-Prussian prejudices of that impulsive and\r\npassionate body; and the insatiable land-hunger of Hertzberg ere long\r\nbegot a feeling that the ally was the worst enemy. The feeling was not\r\nof recent growth. In the year 1775, that is, three years after the\r\nfirst partition of Poland, Prussia sought to strangle the export trade\r\nof that land by imposing heavy customs dues on all Polish products sent\r\ndown the Vistula, a policy which caused an indignant patriot to declare\r\ntheir removal to be almost as vital as the recovery of Galicia to his\r\ncountry’s welfare.[971] All the more did the Prussians persevere in\r\ntheir policy, which clearly involved the ruin of the trade of the free\r\ncity of Danzig (a close ally of the Polish State) as a prelude to its\r\nannexation.[972] Along with it they hoped to secure the cession of the\r\nPolish fortress and district of Thorn.\r\n\r\nThe Diet at Warsaw hotly resented this conduct, declaring that the loss\r\nof those much prized districts could be compensated by nothing less\r\nthan the whole of Galicia. Accordingly, when Prussia began to bargain\r\nwith Austria for the cession to Poland of only part of Galicia, the\r\nrage of the Poles knew no bounds; and, as we saw, the Court of Berlin\r\nfinally fell back on Pitt’s policy of the _status quo_. Nevertheless,\r\neven after the settlement at Reichenbach, Frederick William and\r\nHertzberg harked back to the former scheme, so that, at the end of\r\nthe year 1790, the Poles decided to ask the British Government for\r\nadvice and help. For this purpose they sent to London as special envoy\r\nCount Oginski, their Minister at The Hague. He had two interviews\r\nwith Pitt, whom he describes as “very polite, speaking French with\r\nan English accent, but fluently enough and with marked precision.”\r\nAt first Pitt let his visitor discourse at length, refrained from\r\ncommitting himself, and then suggested a second meeting. By that time\r\nhe had before him several maps and a memorial from London merchants\r\nagainst throwing open the navigation of the Vistula, as it would end\r\ntheir special privileges. On this he remarked that merchants thought\r\nabout nothing but trade, and launched into an argument on behalf of the\r\nadvantages of the Prussian scheme, as providing Poland with what she\r\nmost needed, a good commercial treaty with Prussia. He also showed to\r\nOginski a letter of the King of Prussia in favour of that proposal.\r\nTurning to wider topics, he urged the Count to press on his people\r\nthe need of better agriculture, an extended system of canals, and\r\nother means of transport and export. England, he said, needed Polish\r\ncorn, timber, flax, and hemp, as a counterpoise to the Russian trade\r\nin those articles; and, as the fortunes of Poland, both political and\r\ncommercial, touched us closely, the Prusso-Polish settlement must not\r\nbe such as to harm our interests. He then charged Oginski to declare\r\nthis to his Government, and expressed his intention of giving similar\r\ninstructions to Hailes at Warsaw.[973] That active and intelligent\r\nenvoy had long been working, in consort with Ewart at Berlin, for\r\nthe inclusion of Poland in the Anglo-Prussian compact, as a means of\r\ndeadening the poison of Russian influence in the Republic; and in a\r\npamphlet which he either wrote or inspired, he depicted in glowing\r\ncolours the results attainable by “a grand federative chain (England,\r\nHolland, Prussia, Poland, and, perhaps, Sweden and Turkey) which would\r\nassure a long time of peace to our hemisphere.”[974]\r\n\r\nSimilar thoughts, though of a more practical trend, were shaping\r\nthemselves in the mind of Pitt. The interview with Oginski and the\r\nreports from Berlin and Warsaw convinced him of the need of a compact\r\nwith Poland and the Scandinavian States as a safeguard against Russia.\r\nConsequently the Foreign Office on 8th January 1791 despatched to\r\nFrancis Jackson at Berlin (then acting as _locum tenens_ for Ewart)\r\ninstructions of far-reaching import. They set forth the reasons why\r\nEngland and Prussia should prepare the way for joint alliances, not\r\nonly with Poland, but also with Denmark and Sweden, if that were\r\npossible. The Court of Berlin, it was hoped, might rise to the height\r\nof the situation and render possible so desirable a consummation.\r\n\r\nAt that time the fortunes of Poland appeared radiant with promise.\r\nLate in the year 1790 the Court of Warsaw sought to free itself from\r\nPrussian dictation and Muscovite intrigue by a compact with the Sultan\r\nwhich would assure a free exit for Polish products down the River\r\nDniester (then in Turkish territory) to the Black Sea. Selim III\r\nwelcomed an offer which promised to strengthen both lands against their\r\ncommon enemy, Russia; and it seemed likely that Poland would gain\r\nthe right of navigation in the Black Sea for fifty of her ships. Had\r\nthis come about, she would have lessened her dependence on Prussia in\r\nthe Vistula valley, besides securing valuable markets in the Levant.\r\nBut it was not to be. The Sultan, then in sore straits for the next\r\ncampaign against Catharine, insisted that the Poles should declare war\r\nupon the Czarina whatever Frederick William might do, and thus ensured\r\nthe failure of a compact which promised to range the two threatened\r\nStates along with England and Prussia.[975] If the Poles had had\r\ntimely support from Berlin and London, there is little doubt that they\r\nwould have clogged the efforts of Catharine, besides escaping from\r\nthe tutelage of St. Petersburg. In that case the league outlined by\r\nHailes and, in part at least, approved by Pitt would have come within\r\nthe bounds of possibility. Other requisites were the abatement of\r\nPrusso-Polish jealousies, and the adoption of a sound and steady policy\r\nby Gustavus III. Such were the difficulties in the way of Pitt. It will\r\never redound to his honour that at this time of intrigue and rapine he\r\nsought to assure the union and the preservation of the lesser States.\r\n\r\nAmong the warping influences of the time not the least was the policy\r\nof Hertzberg. After the success of the Triple Alliance in compelling\r\nAustria to come to terms with Turkey, he pressed England to help\r\nin compelling the Czarina to adopt the same course; and, as he had\r\nrecently supported Pitt in coercing Spain, the latter felt in honour\r\nbound to respond. But Hertzberg had long been shifting his ground. He\r\nvalued the alliance with England and Holland chiefly because it secured\r\nPrussia’s western frontier and coast-line, thereby enabling her to\r\nplay a bold game in the East, and to prepare to round off her then\r\nalmost scattered domains in the valley of the Vistula. There the Polish\r\ndistricts around Danzig and Thorn ate into her lands and might even\r\nbecome a source of danger if that singular Republic once more passed\r\nunder Muscovite control. We may freely admit that to a military State\r\nlike Prussia the situation was annoying, and that Pitt himself, had\r\nhe been in office in Berlin, would have sought to assure her eastern\r\nfrontier by some plan of exchange. In truth, his despatches and his\r\nconverse with Oginski show that he appreciated the difficulties of\r\nthe Court of Berlin and tried to induce the Poles to cede Danzig (not\r\nThorn) to Prussia in exchange for a good commercial treaty. It is\r\ntherefore false to assert, as German writers have done, that he showed\r\nno regard for Prussian interests. Unfortunately his solution of the\r\ndifficulty proved to be impracticable. Polish national sentiment was\r\nvery susceptible on this point; and a special decree of the Warsaw Diet\r\nfinally forbade any cession of the national territory, though (strictly\r\nspeaking) Danzig was only allied to the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut long before the failure of Pitt’s well-meant attempt at compromise\r\nHertzberg had been seeking to compass his aims by secret help from\r\nthe Power which ostensibly he was about to coerce. Seeing that Pitt\r\nhad thwarted his earlier schemes by the pacification of Reichenbach,\r\nhe made covert advances to Russia, and that, too, at the time when\r\nFrederick William had expressly charged him to drop the Danzig-Thorn\r\nproposals. Opening his heart to the Russian envoy, Alopeus, he said\r\nthat, if the Empress limited her claims to such a trifle (_peu de\r\nchose_) as Oczakoff and the land up to the Dniester, the two Powers\r\ncould easily come to a friendly understanding, provided that Russia\r\ndid not thwart the scheme just named. He then suggested that, as he\r\nwas forbidden by the King to make that proposal, it would be well that\r\nit should come from St. Petersburg; in which case he would give it his\r\nhearty support. Indeed, he would find no difficulty in proving that the\r\nsupport of Russia and the gains aforesaid were far more desirable than\r\nthe friendship of England, from whom Prussia had received nothing in\r\nreturn for all the services she had rendered.[976] This is in germ the\r\nSecond Partition of Poland. Betraying his own Sovereign and his allies,\r\nEngland and Poland, Hertzberg invited the Power which he was ostensibly\r\nthreatening, to work her will on Turkey provided that she helped\r\nPrussia to secure the two coveted Polish districts. Even in that age of\r\nduplicity and violence conduct such as this bore the mark of infamy. It\r\nled to the fall of the schemer, but not until his treachery had sapped\r\nPitt’s policy at the base.\r\n\r\nAs chance would have it, this insidious offer was made known at St.\r\nPetersburg on the very day when the British and Prussian envoys\r\npresented their demand for the restitution by Russia of all her\r\nrecent conquests. The result can readily be imagined. Catharine,\r\nknowing the Prussian threats to be mere stage thunder, resolved to\r\ndefy both Powers.[977] To Whitworth the Russian Vice-Chancellor,\r\nOstermann, behaved as much in sorrow as in anger. He complained of the\r\nunprecedentedly menacing tone adopted by the Allies. He declared that\r\nthe Empress would never accept their terms, and would limit herself\r\nstrictly to an acceptance of the good offices of England, “inasmuch as\r\nthey may tend to procure for her the indemnity she requires--Oczakoff\r\nand its district.” Rather than forego this, she would commit her\r\nfortunes into the hand of Providence, braving all perils rather than\r\ntarnish the glory of a long and splendid reign by a craven surrender.\r\nWhitworth saw in this declaration a threat of war, but he little knew\r\nwho was the special Providence of the situation. In fact he flattered\r\nhimself that, despite the news of the capture of Ismail by the\r\nRussians, the Empress must give way under the pressure of the Triple\r\nAlliance. His verdict was as follows:\r\n\r\n    Abandoned by her Allies [Austria and Denmark], destitute of\r\n    internal as well as external resources, without confidence in the\r\n    persons she is obliged to employ at the head of her fleet and army,\r\n    both of which are incapable of acting against a formidable enemy;\r\n    and, added to this, a strong spirit of discontent against the\r\n    Government and its measures prevalent throughout the country--how\r\n    can we suppose it possible that, under such circumstances, pride\r\n    and obstinacy can maintain their ground? These, however, are the\r\n    only motives which influence the Court of Petersburg.[978]\r\n\r\nWhitworth’s forecast deserves to be borne in mind; for he, together\r\nwith Ewart or Jackson at Berlin, and Hailes at Warsaw, was best\r\nqualified to judge of Russia’s power of resisting the British demands.\r\nEwart, our able ambassador at Berlin, spent the winter of 1790–1 in\r\nEngland for the benefit of his health; and there are signs in his\r\ncorrespondence with Pitt that he fully explained to him and to other\r\nMinisters the importance of the issues at stake. He showed that, unless\r\nTurkey retained the Oczakoff district, both she and Poland would be\r\nliable to further encroachments from Russia. He declared that the\r\nBritish demand of a restitution of that district by Russia, sent\r\noff on 14th November, would be firmly supported at Berlin; and, he\r\ncontinued, “though the Empress of Russia may, and probably will, make\r\nsome difficulties at first, there can be little doubt of her accepting\r\nthe terms offered before the spring, since she never can venture to\r\nrisk the consequences of a refusal.” Ewart, then, was more positive\r\nthan Whitworth that Catharine would not risk a war with the Allies; and\r\nPitt, with his sanguine spirit, doubtless had the same expectation.\r\nEwart also opened up wide vistas in the diplomatic sphere. He advised\r\nPitt to bring not only Turkey but also Poland into the Triple Alliance;\r\nfor this step would at once overthrow the influence of the Bourbon\r\nCourts at Constantinople and that of Russia at Warsaw.[979]\r\n\r\nDespite Grenville’s disapproval of the latter proposal, Pitt and Leeds\r\ndecided to act on it; and, as we have seen, sent an offer of alliance\r\nto the Polish Court.[980] The matter was of urgent importance; for\r\nrumours of Hertzberg’s underhand clutches at Danzig and Thorn had\r\nreached Warsaw and gave new strength to Muscovite intrigues. The\r\nprospect of an alliance with England was warmly welcomed by Polish\r\npatriots; and there is little doubt that, had Hertzberg loyally\r\nsupported Pitt’s resolve to check the advance of Russia, a completely\r\ndifferent turn would have been given to national developments in the\r\nEast of Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the British Cabinet had reasons for trusting Hertzberg.\r\nThrough the year 1790 he insisted on the need of strenuous action\r\nagainst Russia. It was his policy rather than that of Pitt, who at\r\nfirst took it up somewhat doubtfully. There is not a sentence in the\r\nBritish despatches which has a warlike ring. In the month of December\r\nthe fleet was placed on a peace footing once more--a grave tactical\r\nerror, for it lessened the effect of the British “Declaration” at\r\nSt. Petersburg; and in the missive of 8th January to Jackson, the\r\nhope is distinctly expressed that war may be avoided. There were good\r\ngrounds for such an expectation. Spain appeared to favour the cause\r\nof the Allies; and Leopold, at the end of a fruitless strife, might\r\nbe expected to oppose the aggrandisement of Russia. Pitt therefore\r\nrefused to prepare for war until the intentions of the doubtful\r\nStates--Austria, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden--were better known.[981]\r\n\r\nThe horizon cleared but slowly. The Danish Court declared its intention\r\nof not breaking with the Empress, who had guaranteed to it the Duchy\r\nof Holstein. Austria, while assuring the Allies that she would not\r\ntake up arms for Catharine, favoured her claims at the Conference of\r\nSistova. As for Gustavus III, he seemed to be holding out for the\r\nhighest bid for his alliance. In the middle of February he assured\r\nListon (it was between the acts of the Opera) that he was not pledged\r\nto Russia, and might join the Allies on consideration of a subsidy of\r\n£1,500,000 for each campaign. Spain also balanced at times, as if her\r\nsole object were to restore her waning prestige; but on the whole she\r\nopposed the threatened entrance of Russia into Mediterranean politics,\r\nas France would probably have done had she been less torn by internal\r\nstrifes.[982]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, the general situation favoured the Allies, provided\r\nthat they were true to one another. But here lay the chief difficulty.\r\nThe divergence of interests between the Maritime States and Prussia\r\ncould be reconciled only by generous forbearance and whole-hearted\r\ngood faith. Britons and Dutchmen wanted peace, provided that their\r\nnavies and their commerce would not suffer from the stride of Russia\r\nsouthwards. The Court of Berlin cared less for commerce (except as a\r\nmeans of coercing Poland), but longed for a better frontier on the\r\nEast. Unfortunately good faith was not then characteristic of Prussian\r\npolicy. Jackson suspected Hertzberg of duplicity, but believed his\r\npower to be on the wane. Moreover, other counsellors, especially the\r\nlatest favourite, Bischoffswerder, seemed true to the British alliance.\r\nThe King probably intended to keep troth; but he either could not or\r\ndid not prevent the secret intrigues of Hertzberg from undermining\r\nthe efforts of the Allies both at Warsaw and St. Petersburg. One of\r\nthe great mistakes of his reign was in not dismissing that statesman\r\noutright; but instead of that he merely ordered him once more to desist\r\nfrom his pet scheme, the acquisition of Danzig and Thorn.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Court of Berlin now took one more turn underground.\r\nThe King, weary of the haughty airs and restless ways of Hertzberg, and\r\ndesirous of putting forth a feeler towards Vienna, sent Bischoffswerder\r\non a secret mission to the Court of Vienna (February 1791). Hertzberg\r\nknew no more of its aims than did Frederick William of the intrigue of\r\nhis Foreign Minister with the Russian Chancery. Thus Prussian policy\r\nwas two-headed. The official head, while echoing the menacing tones\r\nof Pitt to Russia, secretly encouraged that Power to retain all its\r\nconquests, provided that Prussia acquired the two coveted towns on\r\nthe Vistula; and Bischoffswerder sought to allure the Emperor. The\r\nKing’s favourite (a poor Saxon nobleman who had won his way at Court by\r\nchameleonic subservience to all the royal moods) was charged to confer\r\ndirect with Leopold, and to propose that the two States should mutually\r\nguarantee their present possessions and aim at excluding Russian\r\ninfluence from Poland. He was also to suggest the peaceable acquisition\r\nby Prussia of Danzig and Thorn in exchange for commercial privileges\r\ngranted to the Poles.[983] Leopold II smiled so graciously on these\r\nproposals as to elicit from the envoy the ecstatic description:\r\n“_Quelle bonté; quelle clarté: et quelle sérénité!_” This benignity\r\nenticed Bischoffswerder on to make the singular offer that, if the\r\nEmperor granted Prussia her heart’s desire, she on her side would not\r\npersist in applying the strict _status quo_ against Austria at Sistova.\r\n\r\nEven this enticing proposal did not dissolve either the hatred\r\nof Kaunitz for Prussia or the determination of Leopold to favour\r\nCatharine. Both the Emperor and his Chancellor saw that Prussia was\r\nseeking to set them against Russia; and policy prompted them to\r\nwork for a war between those two Powers.[984] No suspicion of these\r\nhidden motives ruffled the equanimity of the amateur diplomatist,\r\nwho flattered himself that he had won over Leopold and assured the\r\nisolation of Russia. Full blown with pride he returned to Berlin, and\r\nadvocated energetic measures against Russia, the result of which will\r\nappear in due course.[985]\r\n\r\nWe must now return to London in order to sift somewhat closely the\r\nevidence which came in from various quarters. In a question of so much\r\nimportance and complexity, which influenced the fate of the East as\r\nwell as the career of Pitt, we cannot proceed too cautiously; and the\r\ninductive method here attempted seems to be the only means of avoiding\r\nhasty decisions, and of re-constructing the history of the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, as might be expected, were far less eager than Prussia for\r\nthe humbling of Catharine’s pride, especially as they had recently lent\r\nher a considerable sum of money. Lord Auckland, our envoy at The Hague,\r\nentered into their views and set them forth with his usual ability.\r\nFrom the beginning of this question he opposed the energetic measures\r\nrecommended by Ewart; and certain expressions in his letters smack of\r\npersonal dislike to that ambassador.[986] His position at The Hague\r\nkept him in touch with the British couriers passing through to the\r\nnorthern and eastern capitals; and his very voluminous papers (a small\r\npart only of which has seen the light) yield proofs of his activity in\r\nurging Pitt and the Duke of Leeds to patch matters up with Russia. In\r\na letter of 2nd February 1791, to Huber, he deprecates any attempt to\r\ncoerce Russia, even though it may be crowned by success:\r\n\r\n    The state of our debt, of our revenue, of our trade, and the\r\n    unsettled disposition of mankind in general, forms altogether a\r\n    great object of importance in my ideas, far beyond that of taking\r\n    a feather out of the cap of an old vixen or of preserving a desert\r\n    tract of ground between two rivers to the Turks, whose political\r\n    existence and safety will probably not be diminished if they are\r\n    obliged to have their barrier upon the Dniester, or even on the\r\n    Danube. Besides I see many symptoms ... which irrefragably prove\r\n    to me that our friends at Berlin are in general at least as much\r\n    afraid of a Russian war as I am....[987]\r\n\r\nIn the following letter, dated The Hague, 7th March, he sought to win\r\nover Lord Grenville to his views:\r\n\r\n    It appears from these despatches that we have nothing to expect\r\n    from the Danish Ministry, which is immoveably devoted to Russia;\r\n    and that Sweden, unless previously purchased by the Empress,\r\n    would possibly undertake one campaign against her upon payment\r\n    of £1,500,000. [He names other expenses amounting to another\r\n    £1,500,000.].... In plain truth, this phantom of Oczakow has\r\n    appeared to me for some time to beckon us towards an abyss of new\r\n    debts and endless difficulties at a moment of general fermentation\r\n    in the world when it may be essential perhaps to the very existence\r\n    of our Government and of many other civilized States that we should\r\n    maintain our own internal peace and the uninterrupted course of our\r\n    prosperity.[988]\r\n\r\nAuckland’s chief opponent, Ewart, now had the ear of the Cabinet. On\r\n8th March he frankly informed Auckland that his health had so far\r\nrecovered as to permit him to return to Berlin; but he believed his\r\nduty to lie in London where he frequently saw the chief Ministers. He\r\nadded that the meeting of the Cabinet, which was to decide as to the\r\nmeans of coercing Russia, would take place very shortly; further, that\r\nMinisters “have admitted my statement of facts to be just; so that\r\nthe whole can be reduced to a simple calculation. I can venture to\r\nassure your Lordship in the most positive manner that nothing is to\r\nbe apprehended from the present state of the Prussian Cabinet; and I\r\nwill answer for its being much better than ever it was, provided we go\r\non.”[989] Clearly, then, Ewart had some difficulty in convincing Pitt\r\nand his colleagues that Russia would give way if the Allies showed a\r\ndetermined front.\r\n\r\nPitt himself was now beset by doubts whether the Oczakoff district was\r\nworth the risk of a war. As will shortly appear, Catharine had left the\r\nextent of her territorial demands discreetly vague, so that the Whigs\r\nwere able to assert that Russia wanted merely the barren strip of land\r\naround Oczakoff. The town itself was held to be a valuable possession\r\nbecause it commanded the entrance to the large estuary called the\r\nLiman, which is formed by the Rivers Dnieper and Bug. Auckland,\r\nhowever, brought to judgement an able witness, a Dutch admiral,\r\nKingsbergen, who, after serving in the Russian navy several years in\r\nthose waters, declared that Oczakoff was of little importance either to\r\nthe Turks or the Russians. Pitt took up this question with alacrity,\r\nand on 7th March wrote to Auckland for definite answers to these\r\ninquiries. Whether the Turks, if they resumed possession of Oczakoff,\r\ncould hinder the junction of Russian squadrons sailing from Kherson\r\nand Sevastopol, and thereby hamper the preparations for an attack on\r\nConstantinople? Whether the retention of Oczakoff by Russia would not\r\nenable her to command the southern exit of Polish commerce, namely,\r\ndown the River Dniester to the Black Sea? Also, whether Oczakoff could\r\nnot be so strengthened (rumour described it as in part demolished) as\r\nonce again to defy a Russian attack?[990]\r\n\r\nTo these searching questions Admiral Kingsbergen made the following\r\nreplies. Oczakoff did not command the entrance to the Liman, as that\r\nwas four cannon-shot wide, and the navigable channel was nearer to the\r\nKinburn, or Russian, side than to Oczakoff. Neither of these places was\r\na port; and the value of Kherson (the naval station on the Dnieper)\r\nwas much overrated. Russia would do well to spend all her energies on\r\nSevastopol or Balaclava, to which places she could easily bring all\r\nthe naval stores from the Don or Dnieper district. Those ports would\r\nbe the best starting points for an attack on Constantinople, which the\r\nTurks, even if masters of Oczakoff, could in no wise prevent. When he\r\n(Kingsbergen) in 1773 prepared a plan for attacking Constantinople he\r\ntook little thought of the Turkish garrison at Oczakoff. Indeed that\r\ntown must always be isolated and a source of expense, even of danger,\r\nto the Porte. The admiral felt unable to say whether the cession of\r\nOczakoff and its district to Russia would adversely affect the trade of\r\nPoland to the Black Sea, and he opined that it would not much extend\r\nthe power and population of Russia in the south.[991]\r\n\r\nIn this last conjecture the admiral was wholly wrong. We can now\r\nsee that the acquisition by Russia of the valuable territory in\r\nquestion, on which now stands the port of Odessa, opened up to her\r\nalmost boundless possibilities of controlling the Balkan Peninsula\r\nand of strangling Poland. On the naval matters referred to by Pitt,\r\nKingsbergen’s answer bore the stamp of experience and authority. It\r\nproved that Oczakoff in itself was of little worth; but it did not\r\nprove that the whole district up to the Dniester was equally valueless.\r\n\r\nWe have proof of Pitt’s anxiety to probe this question thoroughly.\r\nIn the Pitt MSS. is a long memorandum which aims at showing that the\r\ngrowth of Russia’s power and trade in the Baltic was to our advantage,\r\nas she supplied us with much needed naval stores, through a sea over\r\nwhich we could exercise some measure of control. But her progress to\r\nthe Black Sea and the Mediterranean was greatly to be deprecated; for\r\nshe would then furnish those stores to our rivals, France and Spain,\r\nthrough ports which were never blocked by ice. Further, if she gained\r\nthe Oczakoff district, she could shut out the trade of the Poles from\r\nthe Black Sea, while extending her own markets through the Levant and\r\nthe Mediterranean, to our detriment. The prospects of her gaining\r\nConstantinople are also dwelt upon; and the conclusion of the anonymous\r\nwriter is that we ought at all costs to hinder her southward march,\r\neven while we hailed her as a friend in the Baltic.[992] Doubts of\r\nvarious kinds also beset the mind of the Duke of Leeds. On 11th March\r\nhe wrote thus to Auckland:\r\n\r\n    ... The present situation of affairs is, I confess, by no means\r\n    pleasant, and perhaps, all things considered, the most perplexing\r\n    point is to extricate ourselves from the risk of a war, _salvo\r\n    honore_. We are in my opinion so far committed as to render this,\r\n    however desirable, extremely difficult, if not impracticable. [He\r\n    then states that the successes of the Russians make it difficult\r\n    now to insist on the absolute _status quo_, of which he had\r\n    never wholly approved.] Yet in my mind [he continues] it behoves\r\n    us (considering the part we have so decidedly, tho’ perhaps\r\n    not very wisely, taken,) more than ever to abide by our former\r\n    determination, or the Empress’s ambition will be gratified, not\r\n    only at the expense of the Turkish territory, but of the reputation\r\n    of this Government. So much for the engagements (thanks to Prussia)\r\n    we have entered into. I will now beg to call your Lordship’s\r\n    attention to the extent of the Russian conquests, which I think\r\n    deserving the most serious attention on our part. Oczakow and\r\n    its district, it seems is (or at least was) all the Empress in\r\n    her moderation will insist on keeping. This district by the bye\r\n    (according to Woronzow’s language, as well as my own suspicion)\r\n    includes the whole tract of country from the Bog [_sic_] to the\r\n    Dniester. However barren the soil may be, the command of the latter\r\n    river, its _embouchure_ being at the mercy of Russia, will operate\r\n    a considerable change in the influence of that Power in the Black\r\n    Sea, whether with a view to hostile operations or to commercial\r\n    engagements, and completely shut out Poland from her southern\r\n    _débouché_.[993]...\r\n\r\nNothing is more singular in this letter than the confession of the\r\nForeign Minister that he does not know exactly what extent of land the\r\nEmpress demands--a matter infinitely favourable to the Opposition in\r\nParliament. Certainly the Duke of Leeds and Whitworth had not manœuvred\r\nskilfully in leaving this all-important question in doubt.\r\n\r\nTo resume, then, we find that neither Pitt nor his colleague knew the\r\nextent of the Czarina’s demands, which, at the request of Prussia, they\r\nwere about to oppose; that Leeds secretly doubted the wisdom of this\r\npolicy; that Pitt found out by 19th March the comparative unimportance\r\nof Oczakoff itself, however valuable the whole territory might be to\r\nPolish merchants; that the Dutch were most reluctant to take any part\r\nin the dispute; that Austria was playing a dilatory and threatening\r\ngame at Sistova; and last, but not least, that Prussian policy began to\r\nshow signs of weakness and wavering.[994]\r\n\r\nNow, the crux of the whole question was at Berlin. Jackson had not\r\nfathomed the depths of Hertzberg’s duplicity. He did not know of his\r\nhaving prompted Russia to suggest to Frederick William a secret bargain\r\nat the expense of Poland; but on 6th March he stated that Danzig and\r\nThorn still held the first place in that statesman’s thoughts, despite\r\nthe express veto of his master. The Prussian Minister sought to justify\r\nhis behaviour by assuring Jackson that, in case of a war with Russia,\r\nLeopold would step in and dictate his terms to Prussia as a revenge for\r\nher treatment of him at Reichenbach. Accordingly, Hertzberg refused to\r\ntake comfort from Jackson’s remark that the splendid army of Prussia\r\n(numbering 208,000 effectives) would be a match for the exhausted and\r\nbadly led forces of the two Empires, distracted as they would be by the\r\nefforts of the Ottomans in the south. He also affected great concern\r\nlest England should play him false by sending only a small fleet into\r\nthe Baltic. But Jackson saw, rightly enough, that the two phantoms,\r\na triumphant Austria and a skeleton British fleet, were conjured up\r\nmerely as an excuse for doubling back to the forbidden fruit--Danzig\r\nand Thorn. Hertzberg finally suggested the advisability of toning down\r\nthe allied demands in order to mollify the Czarina.[995] Thus the first\r\nsuggestion to this effect came, not from Pitt or Auckland, but from the\r\nman who had first advised the use of coercive measures against Russia.\r\nIs it surprising, then, that up to 20th March 1791 Pitt declined to\r\ntake any vigorous steps against Catharine? The whole trend of events\r\nprescribed caution and delay until the policy of Prussia showed signs\r\nof consistency and firmness. But now the whole situation was suddenly\r\nto change owing to causes which must be set forth in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF CATHARINE II\r\n\r\n    A pretty piece of work Mr. Pitt has made of this Russian war.\r\n    I think all the foxhounds will have a fine chase at him next\r\n    session.--LADY MALMESBURY TO SIR GILBERT ELLIOT, _24th August 1791_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of Pitt in playing the part of Petruchio to Catharine\r\ndepended mainly on the steadiness of the Prussian and British\r\nGovernments, the honest neutrality of Leopold, the goodwill of\r\nGustavus, and the conviction of the Czarina that she was hopelessly\r\noutmatched. We have already seen that the actions of the Austrian and\r\nSwedish sovereigns were ambiguous. It remains to consider the conduct\r\nof the Prussian monarch. On 11th March 1791 Frederick William wrote the\r\nfollowing autograph letter to Count Redern, his Minister in London:\r\n\r\n    [_Translation._]\r\n\r\n    Having a sure belief that Austria desires to draw closer to me and\r\n    my Allies, and that the Emperor has declared to the Empress of\r\n    Russia that he cannot assist her in a war that might result from\r\n    her refusal to accept the _status quo_, I wish England to consider\r\n    whether the best course of action would not be that of inducing\r\n    Russia by means of superior forces, both naval and military, to\r\n    follow the example of the Emperor. But, in case England cannot\r\n    resolve on so vigorous a course of action, the cession of Oczakoff\r\n    would be its natural outcome. It seems to me incontestable that\r\n    Russia by the possession of that place gains over Turkey a\r\n    superiority which may be very prejudicial to the interests even of\r\n    England. As the decisive moment is drawing near, I await a definite\r\n    declaration on this subject.\r\n\r\nHere was a distinct challenge to our good faith as an ally of Prussia.\r\nThe Duke of Leeds received it on 19th or 20th March. Jackson’s covering\r\ndespatch supplied a curious commentary on the royal missive. He had\r\nfound out that Hertzberg’s plan of aggrandisement at the expense of\r\nPoland was much more widely favoured at Berlin than he believed to\r\nbe possible. General Möllendorf feared a war with Russia in view of\r\nthe threatening attitude of Austria. Count Schulenberg thought the\r\nposition very difficult, but hoped that the presence of a “large”\r\nBritish fleet in the Baltic might overawe Catharine and end the\r\ndispute. Even Bischoffswerder, who had returned from his mission to\r\nVienna in the most buoyant spirits, expressed concern at the irresolute\r\nmood of Frederick William; but he promised to report progress after\r\nan interview which he was to have with him at a private dinner on\r\nthat day. Late in the evening the favourite declared that he had\r\nconvinced the monarch of the falseness of Hertzberg’s information\r\nabout Austria. In fact, the dinner and Bischoffswerder’s conversation\r\nbrought Frederick William to see the need of bold measures against\r\nRussia; and he drew up forthwith that inspiriting challenge to England.\r\nBischoffswerder also assured our envoy that the anti-British intrigues\r\nwere the work of Anglophobes like Prince Henry of Prussia, or of those\r\nwho wished to maintain the influence of the reigning favourite, the\r\nCountess Dönhoff, and keep the King immersed in his pleasures.[996]\r\n\r\nA more damning explanation of the King’s action cannot be conceived;\r\nand we learn with some surprise that the royal appeal carried the\r\nday at the British Cabinet’s meetings of 21st and 22nd March, when\r\nMinisters had before them the declaration of the Dutch admiral as\r\nto the comparative uselessness of Oczakoff. The final resolve was\r\nformed on 25th March, when the ultimatum to Russia was drawn up and\r\nsent to the King for his approval.[997] Evidently it was the arrival\r\nof Frederick William’s letter that clinched the matter. On the 27th\r\nthe Foreign Office sent off despatches to Berlin and St. Petersburg,\r\nwarning Jackson and Whitworth of the definite demand of the Allies,\r\nthat Catharine must restore to the Turks all her conquests exclusive of\r\nthe Crimea. The Allies hoped to induce Gustavus by the joint offer of a\r\nsum of £200,000, or even £300,000, to grant the use of his ports to the\r\nBritish fleet destined for the Baltic.[998]\r\n\r\nThe British ultimatum to Russia took the form of a “representation,”\r\nthe original of which is in Pitt’s handwriting. It pointed out that,\r\nthe _status quo_ having been adopted as the basis of the treaties\r\nconcluded between Austria and the Porte and Russia and Sweden, the\r\nAllies had hoped that the Empress of Russia would accept the same\r\nreasonable terms for her peace with the Sultan. But, as this was not\r\nthe case, the two Courts now desired to point out that any further\r\naccession of territory to Russia was far from necessary to her, and\r\nmust seriously weaken the Turkish dominions. They therefore invited\r\nthe Empress to declare her readiness to offer reasonable terms to\r\nthe Sultan. The failure to give a favourable answer within ten days\r\nwould be regarded as a refusal.[999] Pitt also sought to infuse energy\r\ninto the Dutch Government. On the same day he directed Auckland, our\r\nambassador at The Hague, to request the equipment of a Dutch squadron\r\nwith a view to a cruise to the Baltic along with the British fleet,\r\nit being certain that Catharine would give way before so great a\r\nsuperiority of force.[1000]\r\n\r\nIt seemed, then, that Pitt and his colleagues had nailed their colours\r\nto the mast; and their behaviour in Parliament betokened no lack of\r\nresolve. On the day following (28th March) Pitt presented the King’s\r\nmessage as to the need of further naval armaments. Fox, “with more than\r\nusual solemnity,” demanded that Parliament should know the reasons for\r\nthe present request; but Pitt declined to promise any more information\r\nthan that contained in the brief official statement. Fox at once\r\ncensured this refusal as “a very new, violent and extraordinary step\r\nindeed.” Pitt here showed a want of tact. A more sympathetic nature\r\nwould have felt the pulse of the House and discerned feverish symptoms.\r\nAlready members had been alarmed by the outbreak of war against Tippoo\r\nSahib; and though Ministers had convicted that potentate of aggressions\r\nagainst our ally, the Rajah of Travancore, yet the House evinced more\r\nthan its usual jealousy respecting foreign entanglements, and resented\r\nPitt’s demand for warlike preparations. In refusing to explain the\r\ngrounds for his present action the Prime Minister behaved as a correct\r\ndiplomatist, but an indifferent parliamentarian.\r\n\r\nOn 29th March the Whig leaders in the Lords showed their former\r\nfondness for the Russian alliance in a series of startling assertions.\r\nEarl Fitzwilliam denied that the retention of Oczakoff, or even\r\nAkerman, would in the slightest degree injure British interests. Lord\r\nPorchester reprobated the ambitious conduct of the Prime Minister,\r\nwhich almost led him to hope that France might recover her strength,\r\nso as to check his career. The country, he added, was in the deepest\r\ndistress,[1001] and would be ruined by the hostilities now imminent.\r\nThe Earl of Carlisle declared that Russia was naturally our friend, and\r\nthat we ought to have formed alliances that were useful, not such as\r\nwould drag us into a criminal war. The naval armament against Spain had\r\nserved merely to “pillage the public and make a show between Portsmouth\r\nand the Isle of Wight.” Lord Stormont then treated the House to a\r\ndisquisition on Turkish history to prove that the Porte had always been\r\nthe tool of France against the two Empires; and it was her game we now\r\nwere asked to play. For the rest, it would be “extremely disagreeable”\r\nto send a fleet into the Baltic if Sweden, deserted by us, showed\r\nherself unfriendly. The Duke of Richmond damned the proposal with\r\nfaint praise, and he was guardedly followed by the Lord Chancellor,\r\nThurlow. Nevertheless, Ministers held their own by ninety-seven votes\r\nto thirty-four.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Pitt brought the matter before the Commons in a\r\nsomewhat cold and ineffective manner. He showed that the interests of\r\nEurope demanded the restoration of the old boundaries in the East;\r\nand that the weakening of Turkey would undermine the defensive system\r\nwhich we had formed with Prussia. From the meagre report of his speech\r\nit would appear that he did not refer to the importance of upholding\r\nPoland or of hindering the approach of Russia to the Mediterranean.\r\nConsequently all the life and glow of the debate was on the side of\r\nthe Opposition. Coke of Norfolk, in a characteristically acrid speech,\r\ndeclared that he believed neither in the abilities nor the integrity\r\nof the Prime Minister, who now, as in the case of the Spanish dispute,\r\nbade them throw away the nation’s money without showing a single\r\nreason why. Lambton followed in the same vein, asserting that a war\r\nwith Russia would yield no prize in galleons and ingots, but merely in\r\nbear-skins. At what point, he asked, had Russia injured our interests\r\nor insulted our honour? Doubtless Ministers had promised the King of\r\nPrussia to go to war with the Czarina. If so, they should state it\r\nclearly. Other members then demanded more information before they\r\nsupported the administration. For the defence, Steele spoke weakly,\r\nurging that the House must trust the executive.\r\n\r\nFox, on the contrary, declared that Pitt had “enveloped himself in\r\nmystery and importance,” and that his speech was “finely confused but\r\nvery alarming.” The Minister had not shown how the balance of power\r\nwas endangered by the Czarina’s policy. It would be time enough to go\r\nto war when she attacked Prussia, or sought to drive the Turks out\r\nof Europe--a scheme which the orator held up to ridicule. He then\r\nprotested against our attacking Russia “for the recovery of a single\r\ntown [_sic_],” and proceeded to indict Ministers because “they first\r\nstirred up the Turks to their own destruction to war upon Russia: they\r\nnext raised the King of Sweden against the same Power, and afterwards\r\nthey lost the benefit of his arms by shamefully abandoning him.”\r\nFinally they had disarmed, after settling the dispute with Spain,\r\nand thus put the nation to the expense of this new armament. It is\r\ndifficult to think that Fox was so ill informed as to believe these\r\ncharges, the falseness of which has been proved in Chapters XXII and\r\nXXIII. In fact, these indictments merely showed him to be the trustful\r\nreceptacle of the anti-British slanders started by foreign Chanceries.\r\nNevertheless, being urged with his wonted power, they struck home; for\r\nit is ever the bent of a popular Assembly to ascribe the worst motives\r\nfor actions which it dislikes.\r\n\r\nPitt replied with admirable temper. He showed that the recent advance\r\nof Russia southwards brought about a situation wholly different from\r\nthat which existed when Fox was in power; he declared that Russia had\r\nseveral times rejected our proffered friendship, and that our alliances\r\nwith Prussia and Holland were most advantageous. Prussia, however,\r\nwould be seriously weakened if the Muscovites triumphed completely\r\nover the Sultan, and would in that case be unable to cover the Dutch\r\nNetherlands or maintain the independence of Poland. He then showed\r\nhow closely this latter topic touched us; for, if we upheld Poland\r\nand cultivated trade with her, she would send us the naval stores for\r\nthe supply of which we at present depended on Russia. Commercial and\r\npolitical motives, therefore, alike bade us set bounds to the boundless\r\nambitions of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe effect of his statesmanlike speech (the first in which the Eastern\r\nQuestion in its new phase received adequate treatment) was lessened\r\nby a vehement harangue from Burke, who was angry with Ministers for\r\ndiverting attention from French affairs. At that time he and his son\r\nwere striving to prepare the way for an armed intervention of the\r\nmonarchs in the interests of Louis XVI; and he therefore upbraided\r\nthe Cabinet for supporting “a horde of barbarous Asiatics” against\r\nthe Czarina, a declared champion of royalty.[1002] “All that is holy\r\nin religion,” he said, “all that is moral and humane, demands an\r\nabhorrence of everything which tends to extend the power of that cruel\r\nand wasteful Empire.” “Any Christian Power is to be preferred to these\r\ndestructive savages.”... “Why are we to be alarmed at the Russians’\r\ncapture of a town? The Empire of Turkey is not dismembered by that. We\r\nare in possession of Gibraltar, and yet Spain is not dismembered.” This\r\nappeal to sentiment and this fine disregard of the facts of geography\r\n(for the district in question is about the size of Scotland) told\r\nwith much effect; and it was with some difficulty that the Government\r\nmustered 228 votes as against 135 for the Opposition.[1003]\r\n\r\nThe next debates, of 12th and 15th April, brought up Grey, Whitbread,\r\nand Sheridan in their most combative moods. The last taunted Ministers\r\nwith being led at the heel of Prussia, whose only desire was to seize\r\nDanzig and Thorn, and to have the upper hand at Warsaw. While not\r\ncalling the tune, we were to pay the piper. He (Sheridan) was sick of\r\nthe parrot cry, “Confidence! Confidence!” Ministers did not deserve\r\nit. Their conduct in Holland in 1787 had been a blow to popular\r\nliberty. And now the son of Chatham was intriguing in all the Courts of\r\nEurope, and figuring as “the posture-master of the Balance of Power.”\r\nUndismayed by this brilliant invective, Dundas once more appealed for\r\na continuance of the confidence which Ministers had merited by their\r\nconduct; and the House accorded it by 253 votes to 173. On 15th April\r\nthe figures were 254 to 162.[1004]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that Pitt kept his party well together, despite\r\nthe fact that his hands were tied by official reserve, while the\r\nOpposition ramped at large in the unalloyed bliss of ignorance. Storer\r\nmight choose to tell Lord Auckland that “the country throughout have\r\ntold Mr. Pitt that they will not go to war.”[1005] But, apart from an\r\ninfluential deputation from Manchester, there was no decided protest.\r\nSeven weeks later Pitt admitted to Ewart that it would have been\r\ndifficult to keep his party together in the event of war, and if he had\r\n“to state, as would then be indispensable, the precise ground on which\r\nit arose.”[1006] But the news which arrived up to 27th March clearly\r\nwarranted the hope that Russia would give way. Then, however, the\r\ndiplomatic situation underwent a curious change.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, then, that is, on the very day on which the Cabinet sent\r\noff the decisive despatches referred to above, most disconcerting news\r\nfrom Lord Auckland reached the Foreign Office. It was to this effect:\r\n\r\n    With respect to the good disposition of the Count of Vienna, which\r\n    is made the groundwork of His Prussian Majesty’s Instruction of\r\n    the 11th inst. to M. de Redern, I think it material to mention to\r\n    Your Grace that, in a subsequent letter of the 12th, _in cypher_,\r\n    which is gone by this day’s mail to M. de Redern (and which I\r\n    have happened to see), His Prussian Majesty states in terms of\r\n    the strongest uneasiness that the Emperor’s conduct becomes more\r\n    suspicious and that he evidently intends to defeat the whole\r\n    Convention of Reichenbach; that he has given up his own opinion to\r\n    that of Messrs. de Kaunitz and Cobenzl and, particularly, that he\r\n    is collecting large magazines and preparations in the neighbourhood\r\n    of Cologne, which M. de Redern is instructed to mention to Your\r\n    Grace as a subject of just uneasiness.[1007]\r\n\r\nThis sudden transition from a warlike resolve to timorous prudence in\r\npart resulted from the Prussian monarch’s habit of listening to two\r\nsets of advisers. Hertzberg whispered peaceful advice into one ear,\r\nwhile the other took in the bellicose counsels of Bischoffswerder; and\r\nthe royal mind sent forth to London both sets of impressions. Other\r\nproofs were soon at hand betokening a reaction towards pleasure and\r\ninertia. Hertzberg, so Jackson reported, sought to enforce the cession\r\nof Danzig and Thorn as a _sine quâ non_ of Prussia’s acting conjointly\r\nwith England--a step which obviously aimed at hindering such action.\r\n\r\nStill more important was the news that came from Copenhagen. On 27th\r\nMarch there reached the Foreign Office a despatch from Francis Drake,\r\nour envoy at Copenhagen, who was destined one day to win unenviable\r\nnotoriety as the dupe of Napoleon’s secret police, and to figure in\r\nFrench caricatures as a ruffled mallard flying off with bottles of\r\ninvisible ink. At present he merely forwarded a pacific proposal of\r\nCount Bernstorff. In the hope of averting strifes in which Denmark\r\nmust inevitably suffer, that Minister had begged the Czarina to accept\r\nthe terms of the Allies if they were modified in her favour. When\r\nCatharine smiled on the proposal, Bernstorff assured Drake of his\r\ndesire to reconcile the Courts of St. Petersburg and London without\r\ncompromising the dignity of George III. He declared that Catharine\r\nhad eagerly welcomed the prospect of a peaceful arrangement, and\r\nhoped that the Allies would appreciate the force of her reasons for\r\nrejecting the strict _status quo ante_, seeing that she had been\r\nunjustly attacked by the Turks, and had won a brilliant triumph. While\r\nrestoring to them a large part of her conquests, she was determined\r\nto retain “a single fortress and a desert region in order to gain a\r\nsafer frontier.” She therefore hoped that the Allies would show their\r\nmoderation by substituting a limited _status quo_ for their present\r\ndemand. Bernstorff added the suggestion that she should have all the\r\nland up to the Dniester, on condition that the walls of Oczakoff were\r\nrazed for all time, and that no military colonies should be founded in\r\nthe ceded territory, which also should remain waste. He further hinted\r\nthat Russia might be induced to grant England a favourable commercial\r\ntreaty.[1008]\r\n\r\nThis last was added as a bait especially tempting to Pitt, who had\r\nbeen much annoyed by the failure of his efforts in that direction in\r\n1787, and now found the Dutch obdurate to some parts of his proposed\r\ncommercial treaty with them. Is it too much to assume that, if the news\r\nwhich arrived on 27th March concerning the shifting of Prussian policy\r\nand the reasonableness of the Czarina had reached him two or three days\r\nearlier, he would have led the Cabinet to a far different decision?\r\nThe speeches of Ministers in Parliament were now marked by coolness\r\nand caution, characteristics which came out even more strongly on 12th\r\nand 15th April.\r\n\r\nThe searchings of heart in the Cabinet on the anxious days 30th\r\nMarch–10th April are laid bare in the memoranda of the Duke of Leeds.\r\nThe Duke of Richmond and Grenville were opposed to the use of coercion\r\nagainst Russia. Pitt, Leeds, Thurlow, Camden, and Chatham at first\r\nresolutely maintained their position. At the second meeting of the\r\nCabinet, on 31st March, Stafford joined Grenville and Richmond. Pitt\r\nalso heard of the defection of the Duke of Grafton and his sons. Camden\r\nseemed shaken by the news before them; and Thurlow attained a prudent\r\nneutrality by diplomatic slumber. Pitt himself was now impressed with\r\nthe need of circumspection; and, on the ground of the proposals from\r\nDenmark, advised the sending of a special messenger to Berlin, to\r\nrequest Jackson not to forward the ultimatum to Russia. Leeds objected\r\nto the Danish proposal being assigned as the reason for delay, and\r\ndeclared that if the despatch were sent in that form, Grenville must\r\nsign it, for he could not.[1009] Pitt then agreed to tone down the\r\ndespatch into a request for a few days’ delay. This was his first\r\ndecided disagreement with Leeds. He sought to end it by friendly\r\nconversation, but in vain; for the Duke believed the honour of the\r\nCabinet to be tarnished by so unworthy a surrender.\r\n\r\nPitt took a more sanguine view of the situation, as appears in some\r\nhitherto unpublished letters that passed between him and Ewart. That\r\nover-wrought envoy had departed for Buxton in the belief that he had\r\npersuaded the Cabinet of the certainty of Catharine acquiescing in the\r\ndemands of the Triple Alliance. What must have been his chagrin, then,\r\nto receive a letter from Pitt, of 6th April, begging him to return\r\nto town at once. “Events have taken a turn here,” wrote Pitt, “which\r\nseem to leave little or no chance of pushing our Plan to its original\r\nextent, and that the best thing we shall have to --(?) it is some\r\nmodification, which perhaps, however, may be so managed as to provide\r\nmore fully than could have been expected for the general object.”[1010]\r\nThis sounds the hopeful note which was rarely missing from Pitt’s\r\nutterances. Evidently he wished that Ewart should return to Berlin\r\nto make the best of the situation. Ewart had an interview with him,\r\non or about 10th April, which he described in a letter of 14th April\r\nto Jackson, his _locum tenens_ at Berlin. He found Pitt as deeply\r\nimpressed as ever with the importance of the political and commercial\r\nobjects at issue, which were\r\n\r\n    well worthy of every exertion. “But,” continued Pitt, “all my\r\n    efforts to make a majority of the House of Commons understand the\r\n    subject have been fruitless; and I know for certain that, tho’\r\n    they may support me at present, I should not be able to carry the\r\n    vote of credit. In short, Sir, you have seen that they can be\r\n    embarked in a war from motives of passion, but they cannot be made\r\n    to comprehend a case in which the most valuable interests of the\r\n    country are at stake. What, then, remains to be done? Certainly,\r\n    to risk my own situation, which my feelings and inclination would\r\n    induce me to do without any hesitation; but there are unfortunately\r\n    circumstances in the present state of this country which make it\r\n    certain that confusion and the worst of consequences might be\r\n    expected, and it would be abandoning the King.”\r\n\r\n    After stating several facts in confirmation [Ewart says], and\r\n    repeating, even with the tears in his eyes, that it was the\r\n    greatest mortification he had ever experienced, he said he was\r\n    determined not to knock under but to keep up a good countenance:\r\n    that the armaments should therefore continue to be made with\r\n    vigour, and the fleet to be made ready for sailing; and that in the\r\n    meantime he hoped means might be found to manage matters so as not\r\n    to have the appearance of giving up the point, but modifying it so\r\n    as to prevent any serious bad consequences from ensuing, tho’ he\r\n    repeated that he was well aware that the difference between any\r\n    such plan would always be very great and extremely mortifying.[1011]\r\n\r\nThis revelation of Pitt’s feelings and intentions is of the highest\r\ninterest. Nowhere else do we hear of wounded pride bringing tears to\r\nhis eyes; and nowhere do we find a clearer statement of his desire\r\nto resign, were it not that such a course would abandon the King and\r\nthe country to a factious Opposition. He therefore resolved on a\r\ncompromise, the weakness of which he clearly saw, because it would\r\nsatisfy Parliament and his opponents in the Cabinet without too much\r\noffending Prussia or unduly exalting the horn of the Czarina. Ewart\r\ndecided to return to Berlin to help on his chief, to whom he expressed\r\nunfaltering devotion. It is further noteworthy that Pitt at this time\r\ndesired to send the fleet to the Baltic; and we may reasonably infer\r\nthat the subsequent reversal of that salutary resolve was the work of\r\nGrenville.\r\n\r\nOne other detail in Ewart’s letter claims attention. Why did Pitt\r\nassign so great weight to the opposition in Parliament? Had he received\r\nprivate remonstrances? Rumour says that Dundas and others warned him to\r\ndesist from his scheme. But, as we have seen, his majority held well\r\ntogether. On 12th April he beat Fox by eighty votes, and on the 15th by\r\nninety-two. How is it possible to reconcile this increase with wavering\r\nor lukewarmness? I think it probable that Pitt chose now and at a later\r\ndate to ascribe his change of front to parliamentary opposition (on\r\nwhich he could descant), while it really resulted from difficulties\r\nin the Cabinet, on which he had to keep silence. Further, he may have\r\nhoped that if Ewart, the soul of the forward policy, consented to\r\nreturn to Berlin, the Duke of Leeds would find it consonant with his\r\nown dignity to retain office.\r\n\r\nIf so, he was disappointed. Before the Cabinet meeting of 10th April\r\nhe had convinced himself that the pacific overtures of Catharine sent\r\nthrough Bernstorff were genuine and sincere. He also pointed out to\r\nthe Duke that the violent language of the Opposition would certainly\r\nencourage the Empress to reject the absolute _status quo_. The\r\ninference was irresistible, that England and Prussia must be content\r\nwith securing rather less for Turkey. Pitt decided in favour of this\r\ncourse, and on 15th and 16th April, drew up the drafts of despatches to\r\nthis effect, in the hope that Leeds would sign them. The Duke, however,\r\ndeclined to do so, and, by the King’s leave, Grenville appended his\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nThis implied a ministerial change; and on 21st April Leeds returned\r\nthe seals to the King after the Drawing Room at St. James’s Palace.\r\nThus disappeared from the forefront of history a personality whose\r\nsprightliness and charm earned him a high place among the wits and\r\namateur playwrights of that age, and whose jealousy for the honour\r\nof England at this crisis won the regard even of those who differed\r\nfrom him. He was far from being a great Foreign Minister. At every\r\ncrisis Pitt took the reins into his own hands, and at other times\r\nthe business of the Foreign Office went on somewhat loosely, Keith\r\ncomplaining at Vienna that in the year 1788 he received only one reply\r\nto fifty-three despatches sent from that capital.[1012] The Duke’s\r\ntenure of office was marked by two of the greatest triumphs ever won\r\nby peaceful means, namely, over France in 1787 and Spain in 1790;\r\nbut these, as we have seen, were essentially the work of Pitt. There\r\ncould be but one successor to Leeds. Grenville, though a far from\r\nattractive personality, possessed qualities of shrewdness, good sense,\r\nand untiring assiduity. He was strong where Leeds was weak, namely,\r\nin system, thoroughness, and equability; but he was weak where Leeds\r\nwas strong, namely, in managing men. George III certainly approved\r\nof the accession of Grenville to power, and sent to him the seals\r\non the same day. After some delay, arising from Pitt’s desire that\r\nCornwallis should succeed Grenville at the Home Office, Dundas took\r\nthat appointment.[1013]\r\n\r\nOn 20th April, then, Ewart was instructed to return to Berlin for\r\nthe purpose of explaining to Frederick William that the difficulties\r\narising from the trend of public opinion and the opportunity afforded\r\nby the Danish proposals induced the British Government to seek for\r\na peaceful compromise with Russia. Pitt also urged the desirability\r\nof Austria joining the Triple Alliance. As to the new Russo-Turkish\r\nboundary, it should be fixed if possible East of the Dniester, namely,\r\nat Lake Telegul, the lands eastward up to the River Bug being also left\r\na desert.[1014]\r\n\r\nEwart arrived at Potsdam on 29th April (a remarkably quick journey),\r\nand found Frederick William in a gracious mood. The King agreed to\r\nPitt’s new proposals, and highly approved of the overtures to Austria.\r\nWhile expressing mortification at the change of front towards Russia,\r\nhe assured Ewart of his belief in the good intentions of the British\r\nMinistry. It is easy to see that Frederick William felt some relief at\r\nthe prospect of avoiding a war, of which nearly all his counsellors\r\nexpressed disapproval. Hertzberg on 24th April assured Lucchesini\r\nthat a war with Russia would probably be the tomb of the Prussian\r\nmonarchy.[1015] There was, indeed, every need for caution, owing to the\r\ndoubtful attitude of Austria. Lord Elgin followed the Emperor Leopold\r\nto Florence for the purpose of urging him to join the Triple Alliance;\r\nbut, while receiving the overture with Tuscan graciousness, he in\r\neffect waived it aside. In vain did our envoy follow the Emperor from\r\ncity to city for some weeks, and urge him to join the Allies. Leopold,\r\nwith his usual penetration, saw that the situation favoured the two\r\nEmpires, provided that they held together; and Pitt’s offer appeared\r\nto him merely an ingenious means of separating them. Further, Kaunitz\r\ndetected the rift in the Anglo-Prussian concert, and the hatred of\r\nEngland which pervaded the letters of Marie Antoinette to the Emperor\r\nmay also have strengthened his resolve to dally with Pitt’s proposals,\r\neven while he took the most effective means of thwarting them. The\r\nPolish Revolution of 3rd May 1791, soon to be described, also led\r\nLeopold to draw closer to Russia. Thus, despite affable converse with\r\nElgin in the towns of Lombardy, he instructed his envoys at Sistova to\r\nraise their demands and assume an arrogant tone. The Turks received\r\nthis rebuff with oriental composure, and, having the support of Keith\r\nand Lucchesini, resisted this flagrant attempt of Austria to shuffle\r\nout of the Reichenbach compact. Accordingly the early days of June 1791\r\nwitnessed a break in the negotiations and a rapid increase of warlike\r\npreparations on the Danube--a turn of affairs highly favourable to\r\nCatharine.[1016]\r\n\r\nThe indignation of Pitt and Grenville at the double-dealing of Leopold\r\nfinds expression in a note of the latter to Auckland (6th July): “If\r\nthe Emperor does break faith with us at last, he does it in a manner\r\nso directly and personally disgraceful to himself, that it is hard\r\nto suppose he can make up his mind to hear all that he must hear in\r\nsuch a case.”[1017] In these words we see the cause of the distrust of\r\nthe Emperor which clogged all attempts at an Anglo-Austrian compact\r\ndirected against French democracy. Events, therefore, told heavily\r\nagainst Pitt’s efforts to bring about an honourable compromise with\r\nRussia. Nothing, however, is further from the truth than to represent\r\nhis offers to Catharine as a humiliating surrender. The instructions\r\nto Fawkener, the special envoy to St. Petersburg, were as follows:\r\nEither the whole of the Oczakoff territory as far west as the River\r\nDniester should be left neutral and uninhabited; or it should become\r\nRussian on condition of lying waste; or the Russian boundary should be\r\ndrawn east of the Dniester, no fortress being constructed in the ceded\r\nterritory.[1018] It is worth noting that the Turkish envoy at Berlin\r\nthought these terms satisfactory. Fawkener was to agree to the third\r\nand least desirable alternative only in case Austria proved obdurate.\r\nBut in this respect he was allowed a certain latitude, provided that\r\nTurkey retained adequate means of defence on that side. In order to\r\navoid any appearance of menace, the British fleet was not to enter\r\nthe Baltic or the Black Sea, a resolve much resented at Berlin and\r\nWarsaw.[1019]\r\n\r\nFrederick William received Fawkener most cordially at Sans Souci on\r\n11th May. He showed some concern at the Manchester petition to Pitt,\r\nas it would stiffen the tone of the Czarina; he urged the sending of\r\na British squadron to the Black Sea to ward off the threatened attack\r\non Constantinople, and stated his preference for the third of the\r\nalternatives named by Grenville. Fawkener therefore felt bound to place\r\nit first in his proposals to the Czarina: and it is noteworthy that\r\nPrussian diplomacy once again favoured a concession to Catharine larger\r\nthan Pitt was disposed to grant. Inward satisfaction at the course of\r\nevents was, as usual, accompanied by many sneers at the weakness of\r\nBritish policy.[1020] Gustavus of Sweden adopted a similar tone. He\r\nassured Liston of his readiness to receive the British fleet and to arm\r\nagainst Russia, provided that the Allies would grant him the needful\r\nsubsidies. Liston, knowing his shiftiness, received these offers with\r\npolite incredulity. Certainly they had no effect at Whitehall.\r\n\r\nPitt’s change of front ruined his influence in the North;[1021] and in\r\ndiplomacy prestige counts for so much that Catharine had virtually\r\nwon her case by the end of May. Fawkener arrived at St. Petersburg\r\non 24th May, and soon found himself involved in a series of gorgeous\r\nfêtes which proclaimed the wealth and power of the Empress and her\r\nentire indifference to all that England might do. For the irksome\r\ndetails of business he was referred to the Ministers and Prince\r\nPotemkin. The latter boasted in his lordly way of his resolve to seize\r\nConstantinople, wage eternal war on the miscreant Turks, and finally\r\nconquer Egypt. After a delay of three weeks the Empress received\r\nFawkener graciously at a ball; she assured him of her admiration of\r\nBurke’s “Reflections” on the French Revolution, and expressed her\r\nhorror of that event as well as her regret at the sympathy of Fox with\r\nit. She petted her grandson, Alexander, and ostentatiously avoided\r\nall reference to the subject of Fawkener’s mission, except that, when\r\na dog chanced opportunely to bark, she said, “Dogs that bark do not\r\nalways bite.” So matters dragged on, it being the aim of Catharine to\r\ngain another success on the Danube, to win over Leopold definitely to\r\nher side (as Fawkener found to be the case by 21st June), and to sow\r\ndiscord among Britons.[1022]\r\n\r\nIn this last she achieved a startling success. On 17th June there\r\narrived at St. Petersburg Mr. (afterwards Sir) Robert Adair, who later\r\non was to figure as a diplomatist under the Ministry of Fox and that\r\nof All the Talents. We may accept his solemn declaration, in a letter\r\nwritten in the year 1842, that Fox had no hand in sending him on this\r\nso-called “mission”;[1023] but we are able to correct Adair’s version\r\nin several respects, from documents in the “Pitt Papers,” which Bishop\r\nTomline, when challenged by Adair, thought fit to withhold.[1024]\r\n\r\nAdair asserted in 1842 that his object in going to Russia was not to\r\noppose Pitt’s policy of recovering Oczakoff, because that Minister had\r\nalready renounced it in obedience to the mandate of Parliament. This,\r\nas we have seen, is incorrect; for when Adair left England, in May\r\n1791, warlike preparations were still going on.[1025] He admits that\r\nFox said to him before starting, “Well: if you are determined to go,\r\nsend us all the news”; and that Fox provided him with a cipher so that\r\nthat news might elude the prying eyes of British diplomatists. It may\r\nbe, as Adair says, that he and he alone was accountable for this odd\r\nattempt to direct the foreign policy of his country. But it is highly\r\nprobable that Vorontzoff (Woronzow), the Russian ambassador in London,\r\nabetted the scheme. On 2nd May Whitworth wrote that Vorontzoff’s\r\ndespatches had given great satisfaction at the Russian capital. “He\r\nassures his Court that Russia has many friends and partisans in\r\nEngland, and affirms pretty positively that His Majesty’s Ministry will\r\nhave no small difficulty in carrying through their measures contrary\r\nto the interest of the country.”[1026] Further, the account of Adair’s\r\n“mission,” given by William Lindsay, Whitworth’s secretary, states that\r\nAdair came with strong letters of recommendation from Vorontzoff, while\r\nthe Duchess of Devonshire commended him to Whitworth. He travelled\r\n_viâ_ Vienna, where he stayed with the Russian ambassador. At St.\r\nPetersburg he at first received countenance from the British embassy,\r\nowing to the high recommendations which he brought with him, and he was\r\npresented at Court by Whitworth himself!\r\n\r\nThus Adair found his path everywhere strewn with flowers. Catharine\r\nsmiled on him and plied him with important questions, ironically asking\r\nhim whether the British fleet had set sail. Fawkener, on the other\r\nhand, she treated with marked coldness. The British embassy, however,\r\nhad its revenge; for Lindsay opened the letters, which Adair trustfully\r\nasked him to take to London, and apparently was able to decipher the\r\nciphered parts, which gave hints to Fox for an attack on Pitt. But\r\nAdair was more than a purveyor of hints for the Whig orators. It is\r\nclear that he stiffened the resistance of the Russian Government. “He\r\nshows,” so Whitworth wrote privately to Grenville, on 21st July, “the\r\nmost virulent opposition to His Majesty’s measures, and takes great\r\npains to counteract the negotiation.”[1027] In official documents\r\nWhitworth and Fawkener depict him as a vain, meddlesome, ignorant\r\nperson, concerned with stockjobbing no less than with diplomacy. But\r\nit is certain that his presence at St. Petersburg, and the biassed\r\ninformation which he supplied, greatly harmed the cause of the Allies;\r\nand Pitt, after seeing copies of Adair’s letters, was justified in\r\nhinting that his action had prejudiced the success of Britain’s efforts\r\nat St. Petersburg. As for Fox, Catharine showed her regard for him by\r\nplacing his bust between those of Demosthenes and Cicero in her palace;\r\nand Adair, on his departure, received from the hands of Potemkin a ring\r\ncontaining her miniature.[1028]\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of this singular “mission.” Even before its details\r\nwere fully known at Whitehall, Ministers debated whether they should\r\nnot take action against Adair. On 29th July Grenville wrote to\r\nAuckland, _à propos_ also of a recent letter of Fox to Barnave: “Is not\r\nthe idea of Ministers from Opposition to the different Courts of Europe\r\na new one in this country? I never heard of it before, and should think\r\nthat, if it can be proved, I mean legally proved, it would go very near\r\nto an impeachable misdemeanour.”[1029] Ministers, however, decided to\r\ntreat Adair’s “mission” with the silence of contempt. Probably their\r\njudgement was correct; for the _finesse_ of Vorontzoff and Catharine,\r\nif fully revealed to the world, would have covered the Opposition with\r\nobloquy, but the Cabinet with ridicule; and in politics the latter\r\nalternative is more to be feared. Apart, therefore, from one scornfully\r\nvague reference by Pitt to the damage done to the nation’s interests by\r\na partisan intrigue at St. Petersburg, little was heard of the affair.\r\n\r\nThe reader who wades through the dreary debates on the Russian Question\r\nearly in 1792 will probably conclude that Adair’s tour belongs to the\r\nannals, not of diplomacy, but of electioneering.[1030] Fox, Grey,\r\nSheridan, and Whitbread proved to their own satisfaction, from Russian\r\nsources of information, that Pitt, besides wasting the public money on\r\nfutile preparations for war, had been outwitted and publicly flouted\r\nby the Czarina. They did not prove that the occasion called for no\r\neffort to curb her ambition, or that Pitt was not justified in taking\r\nup the challenge which their factious conduct had emboldened her to\r\nfling down. In one sense it is unfortunate that the Foxites did make\r\nfurther diplomatic excursions; for the result might have been the\r\naddition of interesting gargoyles to the edifice of the party system\r\nin the form of Opposition embassies, worked by fallen Ministers,\r\ndisappointed place-hunters, and discharged clerks.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other events were working against Pitt. The successes of the\r\nRussian arms had been crowned by the capture of Anapa, near the River\r\nKuban, and their triumph seemed assured both in Asia and Europe. The\r\nRussian Black Sea fleet was preparing to deal a blow at Constantinople;\r\nand, for a time, as we have seen, the Turks were distracted by the\r\nprospect of the renewal of war with Austria.\r\n\r\nYet here again, by one of those sudden turns of fortune which have\r\nso often saved the Ottoman Empire, the designs of the Viennese Court\r\nwere cut short. At Padua, during his Italian tour, the Emperor Leopold\r\nheard the news of the capture of the King and Queen of France by the\r\nrabble of Varennes. This ignominious ending of his schemes for a\r\ncounter-revolution in France stirred the sluggish blood of the Emperor.\r\nOn 6th July he wrote to his brother Maximilian that it was high time to\r\nsave Marie Antoinette and stifle the French plague. A forward policy\r\nin the West implied moderation in the East, and even the Prussophobe\r\nChancellor, Kaunitz, saw the need of a definite peace with the Sultan.\r\nAccordingly, Austria waived her demands for parts of Wallachia and\r\nServia, and made peace with the Porte at Sistova on 4th August, on\r\ncondition of receiving Old Orsova.[1031] Thus the Varennes incident,\r\nwhich involved the royalist cause in ruin, brought salvation to the\r\nMoslems.\r\n\r\nThe desire of Leopold to crush the French Revolution was to have\r\nfar-reaching consequences, which will concern us later. Here we may\r\nremark that the woes of Marie Antoinette and the _volte-face_ of the\r\nEmperor produced a marked effect at St. Petersburg. Hitherto, all had\r\nbeen bluster and defiance. So late as 15th July Fawkener reported that\r\nthe Empress had lately seemed inclined to conquer and keep all that\r\nshe could; but the news from France impelled the Vice-Chancellor,\r\nOstermann, to declare that all animosities should now be laid aside and\r\n“that every nation in Europe should unite [against France] whenever any\r\nproper plan could be agreed on.”[1032] Thus, here again, the failure\r\nof the royalist attempt in France helped to avert the utter breakdown\r\nof the Anglo-Prussian case. Even so, the Czarina won the day at nearly\r\nevery point. Little by little the Allies gave up all the safeguards\r\non which Pitt had at first insisted; and on 26th July their envoys\r\nconsented to the acquisition by Russia of all the Turkish lands east\r\nof the Dniester, provided that the Czarina agreed not to hinder the\r\nnavigation of that river. On the whole, the Porte sustained no very\r\nserious loss, considering the collapse of its defence, the slight\r\ninterest felt on its behalf both at London and Berlin, and the marked\r\ndislike of Catharine for England and Prussia. She hated Pitt, but she\r\ndespised Frederick William. How then could she, in the midst of her\r\nmilitary triumphs, give way to the demands of the Triple Alliance,\r\nwhose inner weakness she had probed?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the intervention of the Allies was not the failure\r\nthat has often been represented. It checked the soaring ambitions of\r\nPotemkin. The Roumans, Bulgars, and Greeks had to thank the Allies for\r\ndelivering them from this selfish adventurer. Their day of liberation\r\nwas deferred, but it came ultimately in far better guise than as a gift\r\nfrom Catharine and her favourite. Strange to say, he fell a victim to\r\nfever, and expired by the roadside in Moldavia as he was proceeding to\r\nthe front; and this event, which wrung the heart of Catharine, had no\r\nsmall share in facilitating the signature of the Russo-Turkish treaty\r\n(on the terms required by the Allies) at Jassy early in the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOther influences were leading Catharine towards peace. In the spring\r\nof the year 1791 Poland entered on a new lease of life. That the Poles\r\nshould alter their constitution without her permission was a grievous\r\naffront, for which she inveighed against them as rebels. Thenceforth\r\nWarsaw, rather than Constantinople, took the first place in her\r\nthoughts. Apart from this, the prospects of the Poles were radiant\r\nwith promise; and the student who peruses the despatches of Hailes,\r\nBritish envoy at Warsaw, cannot but picture the results that might\r\nhave occurred had the Poles received adequate support from Prussia and\r\nEngland against the Muscovites. The confederated Diet at Warsaw then\r\nshowed a reforming zeal equal to that of the French National Assembly.\r\nIn the middle of April it struck off the shackles from the burghers and\r\nmade them citizens. Early in May, when the political horizon darkened,\r\nfear cowed even the Russophiles, while a storm of patriotic fervour\r\nswayed the Diet, and burst through the two barriers which hemmed in the\r\nnational life. There was no hubbub in this memorable sitting. No swords\r\nflashed forth, as had happened on many a petty pretext. Emotion held\r\nthe Assembly spellbound, while the majority swept away those curses\r\nof the land, serfdom and the elective kingship. Thereupon one of the\r\nleading obstructives aroused general astonishment by proposing that\r\nmembers should swear to uphold the new order of things. King Stanislaus\r\nevinced his patriotic zeal by calling on the Bishop of Cracow to\r\nadminister the oath, which deputies and visitors alike recorded with\r\nshouts of joy. The exulting throng of nationalists and their recent\r\nconverts then sallied forth and took the oath once more at the foot\r\nof the high altar of the Cathedral; and the sullen dissidence of some\r\nthirty of Russia’s henchmen served but to emphasize the overwhelming\r\ntriumph of intelligence and patriotism.[1033]\r\n\r\nSuch was the peaceful Revolution of 3rd May 1791 at Warsaw. It sent\r\na thrill of exultation through France, and moved Burke to a splendid\r\npanegyric, which he crowned with the startling statement that the\r\nevents at Warsaw were probably the purest good ever conferred upon\r\nmankind.[1034] Even Grenville’s cold and insular nature warmed and\r\ndilated at the news; and he bade Hailes express the interest of Great\r\nBritain in the new constitution, especially as it would benefit the\r\ncause of the Allies.[1035]\r\n\r\nBut the ill fortune which dogged the steps of the Poles willed that in\r\nthis time of their revival the Alliance, from which alone they could\r\nhope for safety, should go to pieces. The refusal of England to send a\r\nfleet either to the Baltic or the Black Sea depressed the influence of\r\nEngland at Berlin. “Oh! how my blood boils, my dear Sir,” wrote Ewart\r\nto Keith on 18th June. “Our influence was all powerful so long as it\r\nwas maintained with the necessary vigour; and the moment we flinched,\r\nall the Powers, as if by common consent, turned the tables upon\r\nus.”[1036] This proved to be the case. The web of Ewart’s diplomacy,\r\nthe toil of four years, which connected England with Prussia, Sweden,\r\nPoland, and Turkey, was unravelled in as many weeks. The general trend\r\nof events helped on the work of dissolution; and among the sinister\r\ninfluences at Berlin, jealousy of the reviving power of Poland played\r\nno small part. Hertzberg, whose fortunes were now on the decline,\r\nsought to postpone his fall (it came early in July) by exciting\r\nanimosity against the Courts of London and Warsaw. To his reckless\r\ncharge against Pitt, of seeking to ruin Prussia by a war against the\r\nMuscovites, he now added a jeremiad against the Polish reformers of\r\nWarsaw--“The Poles have just dealt the _coup de grace_ to the Prussian\r\nmonarchy by making their kingdom hereditary and adopting a constitution\r\nbetter than that of England.”[1037] Dislike of its Allies was now\r\nthe prevalent feeling at the Prussian Court, and by the end of June\r\nFrederick William decided to have an interview with Leopold for the\r\npurpose of coming to a friendly understanding.[1038]\r\n\r\nThis resolve, fraught with evil for Poland, was clinched by the news\r\nof the capture of the King and Queen of France at Varennes. Concern\r\nat their ignominious position now began to influence the Central and\r\nEastern Powers. The wrath of the Czarina fell upon French democrats;\r\nfor in the nature of this extraordinary woman sentiment and passion\r\nalways ran an even race with foresight and reason. In her present\r\nmood the French Revolution and all its abettors were anathema. The\r\nresults were curious. The bust of Voltaire was deposed from its place\r\nof honour and huddled away amidst lumber. Within a short space the\r\nbust of Fox, now that he had served her purpose, shared the same fate.\r\nMore important, perhaps, if less striking to the imagination, is\r\nthe fact that she now formed a close alliance with Sweden. Early in\r\nOctober Gustavus III ended his long balancings by espousing the side\r\nof Russia, with a view to eventual action against France.[1039] The\r\ndecline or collapse of the Anglo-Prussian Alliance followed as a matter\r\nof course so soon as Frederick decided to clasp the hand of Leopold.\r\nIt is curious to find Pitt and Grenville, even at the end of August\r\n1791, seeking to include Austria in the Triple Alliance, when statesmen\r\nat Berlin and Vienna were scoffing at England, and were adopting\r\nan offensive policy at variance with the pacific aims cherished at\r\nWhitehall. Kaunitz and Bischoffswerder looked about for a scape-goat,\r\nand found him in Joseph Ewart. Auckland had also been making a dead set\r\nat this able ambassador; and some hitch in the negotiations attending\r\nthe marriage of the Duke of York with the eldest daughter of the King\r\nof Prussia served to increase his troubles at this time. But the\r\nfollowing hopeful letter which Pitt wrote to him on 2nd September must\r\nhave salved his mental wounds:\r\n\r\n    ... Many events have certainly concurred to disappoint the\r\n    accomplishment of very important objects, and to produce in some\r\n    respects an unfavourable change both in Prussia and elsewhere.\r\n    But the general state of Europe, taking in the whole, affords so\r\n    favourable a prospect to this country that we have great reason\r\n    to be contented. Any temporary fluctuation in the disposition\r\n    at Berlin is therefore, at the moment, of less consequence. The\r\n    connection between Prussia and Austria, whatever right we have\r\n    to complain of the steps which have led to it, cannot, I think,\r\n    produce any permanent mischief to our system; and, at least, I\r\n    am convinced that the best chance of preventing it is to mark\r\n    no suspicion on our part to preserve as much good humour and\r\n    cordiality as possible. For the rest, in the singular and uncertain\r\n    state of Europe, our chief business must be to watch events and\r\n    keep ourselves quiet. I have been sincerely concerned not to have\r\n    more favourable accounts of your health....\r\n\r\nThe prospects, so far as concerned the freedom of Poland and the peace\r\nof the West, were worse than Pitt anticipated. Ewart foresaw the course\r\nof events more correctly. A little later he obtained the recall for\r\nwhich he had some time been pressing; but he had the mortification of\r\nseeing Morton Eden, the brother of his rival, Lord Auckland, installed\r\nin his place. He retired to Bath for treatment by his brother, a\r\nmedical man; but an internal disease of long standing developed very\r\nsuddenly on 25th January 1792, and ended his life two days later\r\namidst delirium. The details, as set forth in the family papers, show\r\nthat the delirium of his last hours was the outcome of acute internal\r\ntroubles, which resembled appendicitis. They serve also to refute\r\nthe wild rumours that Ewart went raving mad as a result of political\r\ndisappointments, or that he was poisoned by some Russian agent.[1040]\r\nThe last letter which Pitt wrote to this brilliant but most unfortunate\r\ndiplomatist shows a chivalrous desire to screen him from needless\r\nanxiety:\r\n\r\n                              Downing Street, _Jan. 20, 1792_.[1041]\r\n\r\n    Your letter having come at a time of very particular engagement,\r\n    it was impossible for me to answer it sooner. Your recollection\r\n    of what pass’d between the Duke of York and yourself is certainly\r\n    different from the manner in which I am told that H.R.H.\r\n    understands it; but no difficulty whatever will arise from this\r\n    circumstance in settling the business; nor do I see any reason\r\n    for your entertaining any apprehension of its producing any\r\n    consequences disagreeable to yourself. I am very sorry that you\r\n    should already have felt so much on the subject. The train in\r\n    which the business now is will, I am in hopes, relieve you from\r\n    any further anxiety or trouble respecting it, and makes it wholly\r\n    unnecessary to dwell further upon it.\r\n\r\nWorse than private misfortunes was the blow dealt to the Polish\r\ncause. The rebuff encountered by the Allies at St. Petersburg deeply\r\ndepressed the reformers of Warsaw. On the return of Fawkener through\r\nthe Polish capital, King Stanislaus expressed grave concern at the\r\nabandonment of all the safeguards for Turkey and Poland on which Pitt\r\nhad at first insisted. The cession to Russia of all the land up to\r\nthe Dniester seemed to him to presage ruin to the Poles--“Nor did my\r\npointing out [added Hailes] the attention which had been paid to their\r\ninterests by the preservation of the liberty of the Dniester produce\r\nany advantageous effect.”[1042] In truth, Stanislaus knew Catharine\r\nwell enough to see in her triumph the doom of his kingdom.[1043] Just\r\nas the ascendancy which she acquired over Turkey by the Treaty of\r\nKainardji led naturally, perhaps inevitably, to the First Partition of\r\nPoland, so now the principle of the Balance of Power impelled Austria\r\nand Prussia to look about for lands that would compensate them for the\r\nexpansion of Russia. Those lands could be found most easily in Poland,\r\nless easily in France. So it came about that the principle which Pitt\r\ninvoked for the greater security of the smaller States, became in the\r\nhands of Catharine and her powerful neighbours a pretext for schemes of\r\naggrandisement and pillage.\r\n\r\nThus fell to pieces the “federative system,” whereby Pitt hoped to\r\ngroup the weaker States around England and Prussia. The scheme was due\r\nin the first instance to Ewart. Pitt adopted it when he believed the\r\ntime to be ripe; but he postponed action too long. Had he pushed his\r\nplans forward in the autumn of 1790, as soon as the dispute with Spain\r\nwas settled, and maintained the naval armaments at their full strength,\r\nhe would probably have gained a peaceful triumph over Catharine. In\r\nthat case the accession of Poland, Sweden, and Turkey to the Triple\r\nAlliance would naturally have followed. There would then have been\r\nno invasion of France by Austria and Prussia; still less would there\r\nhave been any spoliation of Poland. The practical manner in which the\r\nPoles reformed their commonwealth opened up vast possibilities for the\r\neast of Europe; and the crushing of those hopes under the heel of a\r\nremorseless militarism is probably the severest loss which the national\r\nprinciple has sustained in modern times.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though Pitt showed a lack of nerve at the crisis, yet, in\r\nview of the duplicity of Prussia, the doubtful attitude of Leopold and\r\nGustavus, the marvellous resourcefulness of Catharine, and the factious\r\nopposition of the Whigs, he cannot be blamed. At times, new and subtle\r\ninfluences warp the efforts of statesmen. This was so in the year 1791.\r\nPitt was striving to build on the basis of the Balance of Power. But\r\nthat well-trodden ground now began to heave under the impact of forces\r\nmightier than those wielded by monarchs and chancellors. Democracy\r\nsent out its thrills from Paris as a centre, and the gaze of statesmen\r\nwas turned from the East to the West. Thenceforth the instinct of\r\nself-preservation or of greed marshalled the continental chanceries\r\nagainst the two reforming States. The “Zeitgeist” breathed against the\r\nplans of Pitt, and they were not. In their place there came others of\r\na far different kind, inspired by hopes of territorial gains in Poland\r\nand the overthrow of liberty in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Baines, “Hist. of Cotton Manufacture,” 226, 232–4.

What an enlargement might\r\nachieve no man can tell.” Later on he notes that Pitt was very little\r\nsupported, but shone marvellously in debate.\r\n\r\n[161] Mr. Sichel (“Sheridan,” ii, 36) admits the strong personal\r\nelement in Sheridan’s opposition to Pitt.\r\n\r\n[162] “Parl.

The letters of the Earl at that time show\r\nthat he declined office because he believed Pitt’s administration must\r\nspeedily fall, whereupon “the virtuous Coalition” would return in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n[203] “Mems. of the Whig Party,” ii, 5–7.\r\n\r\n[204] The Duke of Richmond did not join the Cabinet until 13th January.\r\nSee Lord Carmarthen’s Mem.

These notes on the\r\nCabinet meetings show how long were the discussions there respecting a\r\ndissolution, and Pitt’s anxiety to defer it to a favourable moment.\r\n\r\n[208] Pitt MSS., 353. I cannot accept Mr. Sichel’s statement\r\n(“Sheridan,” ii, 45), that Dundas prescribed Pitt’s India Bill, and\r\nBurke helped in it.

It is endorsed, in Pitt’s hand: “Oct. 12,\r\n1784, Mem^m for Instructions to Mr. Fitzherbert.” Carmarthen’s draft\r\nis almost certainly that which is printed by Mr. Oscar Browning in\r\nthe “Leeds Memoranda,” p. 103 _n._; but the evidence here given shows\r\nthat that draft cannot be Pitt’s, as Mr. Browning at that time (1884)\r\nnaturally inferred.\r\n\r\n[416] This is well set forth in the despatches of Lord Dalrymple,\r\nBritish Ambassador at Berlin, to Carmarthen. The latter wrote to Harris\r\non 24th February 1786, that Vorontzoff would try to persuade Catharine\r\nII to restore the “good system,” and to induce Joseph II to help in the\r\nwork; but nothing came of it (B.M.

Memorandum of 2nd February 1785.\r\n\r\n[418] Even after the disasters of 1813 Napoleon wrote: “Holland is a\r\nFrench country and will remain so for ever” (“Lettres inédites,” 6th\r\nNovember 1813).\r\n\r\n[419] See Colenbrander, “De Patriottentijd,” i, 415, for the Prince’s\r\ndifficulty in forming (February 1784) a permanent force of 8,000\r\nsailors subject to the Council of War and not to the provincial\r\nEstates; also “A View of the Policy ... of the United Provinces”\r\n(Dublin, 1787). As Grenville wrote to Pitt from The Hague on 31st July\r\n1787, that the Dutch understood their Constitution very imperfectly\r\n(“Dropmore P.,” iii, 410), I may be pardoned for not seeking to unravel\r\nit here.\r\n\r\n[420] “Malmesbury Diaries,” ii, 92–4, 222–4.\r\n\r\n[421] B.M.

For Anglo-Prussian relations and Ewart’s work, see Dr.\r\nLuckwaldt’s excellent monograph, “Die englisch-preussische Allianz von\r\n1788,” 51 _et seq._ (Leipzig, 1902). By the kindness of General Sir\r\nSpencer Ewart, I was able to transcribe several of the letters of his\r\nforefather, Joseph Ewart.

George III showed more sagacity than his\r\nMinisters, witness the phrase in his letter of 7th August to Pitt: “An\r\nexperience of twenty years has taught me not to expect any return for\r\nthe great assistance she [Catharine] has received from this country.”\r\n\r\n[440] As late as 5th February 1786 he wrote to Harris: “We are on more\r\nfriendly terms with Russia than for a long time” (B.M. Add. MSS.,\r\n28061).\r\n\r\n[441] I have published this Memorandum along with other documents\r\nbearing on the years 1785–7 in the “Eng. Hist.

French\r\ntroops, disguised as Free Corps, were afterwards captured in Holland\r\nand had on them orders and instructions written by de Ségur, the French\r\nWar Minister, who resigned in August 1787 (“Auckland Journals,” i,\r\n259). It seems probable therefore that some Ministers egged on the\r\nFrench agents and the Patriots, while Montmorin strove to hold them in\r\ncheck. Louis XVI also used his influence to prevent a war with Prussia,\r\nwhich he disliked (see Garden, “Traités,” v, 85 _n._). The appointment\r\nof Loménie de Brienne to a kind of dictatorship seems also to have made\r\nfor peace; it coincides with the resolve, formed about 20th August\r\n(see Barral de Montferrat, _op. cit._, 214), to recall Vérac from The\r\nHague; and on 31st August Montmorin signed with Eden a convention for\r\nending irritating disputes in East Indian affairs. I have no space\r\nto go into that question; but it had been reported (_e.g._, by Eden\r\non 9th November 1786, Pitt MSS., 110) that the French were about to\r\ngain control over Dutch East India ports.

It would\r\nbe difficult to induce Parliament to pay any part of these debts.\r\nMoreover, such a demand “would afford a fresh topic of declamation to\r\nthose who already use the expenses of Royalty as an engine to operate\r\nupon weak minds in order to effectuate their ultimate purpose, the\r\noverthrow of everything dignified, everything sacred, everything\r\nvaluable and respectable in social life.” The anonymous compiler\r\ntherefore suggests the raising of a loan at 3½ per cent., so as to\r\ncover the “urgent” debts amounting to £349,511. Creditors would\r\nprobably consent to the “defalcation” of 20 per cent. from what was\r\nowed them and be content with 3½ per cent. interest on the remainder.\r\n\r\nA Mr. W. Fitzwilliam, of 45, Sloane Street, in May 1795 suggested a\r\nlottery for raising £2,100,000, of which £650,000 should go to the\r\ndischarge of the Prince’s debts, £1,000,000 to the archbishops for the\r\nforming of a fund for raising the stipend of every clergyman to £100 a\r\nyear; £100,000 to be reserved as prizes in the lottery; and £50,000 to\r\nbe set apart for expenses.\r\n\r\n[632] “Buckingham P.,” i, 361; Wraxall, iv, 458; v, 77–9.\r\n\r\n[633] “Dropmore P.,” i, 353.

But they took only the slightest and most perfunctory\r\nsteps in that direction.

Colonel Delancey named by Pitt was probably\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Stephen Delancey (1740–98), who helped to raise a\r\nloyal battalion at New York and finally became Governor of Tobago.

This last is of course\r\nhighly probable; but, as we shall see presently, the journey had been\r\nprojected in 1785.

Keene on 26th August 1788 reported to\r\nCarmarthen the facts so far as he knew them, and also in a later\r\n“Account.” His bias against the King is obvious, and leads me to\r\ndiscount his assertions, _e.g._, that of 9th September, that the war\r\nwith Russia was at an end, owing to the offer of peace to Catharine by\r\nthe Swedish officers, and had become merely “a domestic quarrel between\r\nthe King and nation.” Doubtless it was for this and similar statements\r\nthat Keene was recalled in December 1788, Liston taking his place.\r\n\r\n[804] “F. O.,” Turkey, 9.

For a sharp critique on Ewart’s excess of zeal see Luckwaldt,\r\n“Zur Vorgeschichte der Konvention von Reichenbach” (Berlin, G. Stilke,\r\n1908), 237–9.\r\n\r\n[816] The statements of Keene (“F. O.,” Sweden, 7) imply that the King\r\nwas at the end of his resources at Stockholm, and had but a limited\r\nsuccess among the dalesmen. They rebut the statements in the “Memoir of\r\nHugh Elliot,” 304.\r\n\r\n[817] Keene on 26th September wrote that the Allies’ offer of mediation\r\nhad made a great impression at Stockholm. Count Düben, the Minister,\r\nthanked him for it, but said it would perplex the King, as he did not\r\nwish to disoblige France. A truce of eight months was necessary; but\r\nthe King would not make peace with Russia unless Russian Finland were\r\nrestored to him.\r\n\r\n[818] “F. O.,” Sweden, 7.\r\n\r\n[819] The rebuke may have been due to Elliot’s silence; for in a P.S.\r\nto a letter of 16th October to Ewart, Elliot said: “Write everything\r\nabout me to London; I have never written myself, having acted hitherto\r\nwithout instructions” (“F. O.,” Prussia, 14). As we have seen, he had\r\nacted largely on the advice of Ewart; and Liston, on finding this out,\r\nsuggested to Carmarthen the need of cautioning Ewart not to go too fast\r\n(Luckwaldt, _op. cit._, 238).\r\n\r\n[820] “F. O.,” Denmark, 10. Despatches of 30th November, 5th and 27th\r\nDecember. On 10th April 1789 Carmarthen assured Elliot of the desire\r\nof H.M. for a Danish alliance.

Pitt never recognized\r\nany Belgian envoy as having official powers, and took no step that\r\nimplied Belgian independence.\r\n\r\n[843] “F. O.,” Prussia, 17.\r\n\r\n[844] “F. O.,” Prussia, 17.

Ewart reported on 4th January\r\n1790 that Hertzberg was holding over the Polish treaty, and that it\r\nwould be wholly “vague and ostensible.” Clearly Ewart thought that\r\nHertzberg would leave the door open to coerce Poland into giving up\r\nDanzig and Thorn (“F. O.,” Prussia, 17). Article 2 of the treaty made\r\nthis still possible. See, too, Frederick William’s letter of 11th April\r\n1790 to the King of Poland, and the projected treaty of commerce, in\r\nMartens, iv, 126–35.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the “Ann. Reg.” of 1791 (p. 12), that the Triple\r\nAlliance became “a species of Sextuple Alliance,” by the inclusion of\r\nPoland, the Porte, and Sweden, is incorrect.\r\n\r\n[851] Dembinski, i, 281, 283, 285.\r\n\r\n[852] “F. O.,” Poland, 4.

Gustavus had\r\npressed Prussia to advance to him 8,000,000 Swedish crowns, and\r\n7,000,000 more next year if the war continued. He urged her to attack\r\nRussia at once. Sweden must obtain the wider boundaries of the Peace\r\nof Nystadt (Ewart to Leeds, 10th May). Early in June Prussia advanced\r\n100,000 as a subsidy to Sweden, and as many more on behalf of England,\r\non condition that _Gustavus would not make a separate peace with\r\nRussia_ (Ewart to Leeds, 4th June).\r\n\r\n[864] “F. O.,” Austria, 20.

Add. MSS.,\r\n34438). See, too, Sybel, bk. ii, ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[881] It is too large a topic to discuss here why the Revolution did\r\nnot break out in those lands; but I may hazard these suggestions: (1)\r\nFeudalism was there still a reality. The lords mostly lived on their\r\nestates, spent their money there, and performed the duties which the\r\nFrench nobles delegated to bailiffs, while they themselves squandered\r\nthe proceeds at Paris or Versailles. Hence (2) a perilous concentration\r\nof wealth at those centres, which attracted thither the miserable,\r\nespecially in times of distress like the severe winter of 1787–8. (3)\r\nIn the other lands named above, the barriers of princely and feudal\r\nrule kept the people isolated in small States or domains and prevented\r\ncommon action. (4) Political and social speculations were brought home\r\nto the French as to no other people by the return of the French troops\r\nserving in the United States. (5) The mistakes of Louis XVI and Necker\r\nin May–June 1789, and the precipitation of the reformers at Versailles\r\ncaused a rupture which was by no means inevitable, and which few if any\r\nhad expected.\r\n\r\n[882] Rousseau, “Confessions,” bk. iv.\r\n\r\n[883] Prof. Aulard (“La Rév. Franç.,” chs. iv-vi) has proved that there\r\nwas no republican party in France until December 1790, and that it had\r\nno importance until the flight of the King to Varennes at Midsummer\r\n1791.\r\n\r\n[884] A.

That the commander at Gibraltar, General O’Hara, received\r\na hint to be strict with the young prince seems likely from his rebuke\r\non a trifling occasion: “If you do not do your duty, I will make you do\r\nit” (“Napoleon and Sir Hudson Lowe,” by R. C.

The reverse is\r\nantecedently probable, and is asserted in Meares’ “Memorial.”\r\n\r\n[913] The “Memorial” is among the British archives in “F. O.,” Spain,\r\n17.

I am the more anxious about\r\n    this, as no one would like to give a final opinion on the terms of\r\n    a paper of so much delicacy and importance without having had an\r\n    opportunity of considering them beforehand.”\r\n\r\n[917] See del Campo’s note of 20th April, in Manning, 374, 375.\r\n\r\n[918] “Dropmore P.,” i, 579, 580; “F. O.,” Spain, 17.\r\n\r\n[919] “Journals of Sir T.

On 13th June 1805 he sought to dispel some suspicions which\r\nPitt had formed of him, and added: “Je n’ai jamais départi un instant\r\ndes principes politiques et moraux qui formèrent notre première liaison\r\npolitique en 1790.” See, too, an interesting article on Miranda in the\r\n“Amer. Hist. Rev.,” vol. vi, for proofs of the dealings of Pitt with\r\nMiranda at that time. On 12th September 1791 Pitt wrote to him stating\r\nthat he could not grant him the pension he asked for, or the sum of\r\n£1,000: £500 must suffice for the expenses incurred during his stay in\r\nLondon (Pitt MSS., 102).\r\n\r\n[925] “F. O.,” Spain, 17.\r\n\r\n[926] “Travaux de Mirabeau” (1792), iii, 319.\r\n\r\n[927] W.

Earl\r\nCamden, a valued member of the Cabinet, wrote on 29th June to Pitt\r\nexpressing grave concern at this answer from the Spanish Court. He\r\nadded these words: “War, as I always thought, was inevitable, and\r\nto temporize impossible. The jealousy of that Court gave the first\r\nprovocation, and their pride refuses satisfaction. The consequence is\r\nevident. We have no choice, for the outrage at Nouska [_sic_] cannot be\r\na subject of discussion.

On 13th May 1790 Miles wrote to Pitt\r\nthat George Rose had informed him he could not see how Pitt could\r\nemploy him. Miles begged Pitt for a pension as a literary man. There\r\nis no other letter to Pitt until 10th December 1790, dated Paris:--“My\r\nattachment to your interest and a sincere desire to give every possible\r\nsupport to your Administration induced me to engage without difficulty\r\nin the enterprise proposed by Mr. Rose, and to accept of a salary\r\ninadequate to the expenses of the most frugal establishment,” viz.,\r\n£400 a year.

He referred to the signature of\r\nthe Reichenbach Convention as strengthening our position. On 21st\r\nSeptember he wrote to Auckland of the “intolerable suspense” of the\r\nSpanish affair, and hinted that Spanish gold had probably bought the\r\nrecent peace between Sweden and Russia.

The terms of Fitzherbert’s despatch of 16th September, which Dr.\r\nManning does not notice, surely convinced Pitt that Spain would on no\r\naccount use the French alliance on Mirabeau’s conditions.\r\n\r\n[957] Pretyman MSS.\r\n\r\n[958] “F. O.,” Spain, 49 (Drafts of Lord Grenville), shows that the sum\r\nof £50,000 was finally demanded from Spain as compensation.
