Four centuries have\r\npassed since the Spaniards began that colonization on the main land\r\nwhich has resulted in the growth of the nations of Latin-America. Three\r\ncenturies have passed since, with the settlements on the coasts of\r\nVirginia and Massachusetts, the real history of what is now the United\r\nStates began. All this we ultimately owe to the action of an Italian\r\nseaman in the service of a Spanish King and a Spanish Queen. It is\r\neminently fitting that one of the largest and most influential social\r\norganizations of this great Republic,――a Republic in which the tongue\r\nis English, and the blood derived from many sources should, in its\r\nname commemorate the great Italian. It is eminently fitting to make an\r\naddress on Americanism before this society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nWe of the United States need above all things to remember that, while\r\nwe are by blood and culture kin to each of the nations of Europe,\r\nwe are also separate from each of them. We are a new and distinct\r\nnationality. We are developing our own distinctive culture and\r\ncivilization, and the worth of this civilization will largely depend\r\nupon our determination to keep it distinctively our own. Our sons and\r\ndaughters should be educated here and not abroad. We should freely take\r\nfrom every other nation whatever we can make of use, but we should\r\nadopt and develop to our own peculiar needs what we thus take, and\r\nnever be content merely to copy.\r\n\r\nOur nation was founded to perpetuate democratic principles. These\r\nprinciples are that each man is to be treated on his worth as a man\r\nwithout regard to the land from which his forefathers came and without\r\nregard to the creed which he professes. If the United States proves\r\nfalse to these principles of civil and religious liberty, it will have\r\ninflicted the greatest blow on the system of free popular government\r\nthat has ever been inflicted. Here we have had a virgin continent on\r\nwhich to try the experiment of making out of divers race stocks a\r\nnew nation and of treating all the citizens of that nation in such a\r\nfashion as to preserve them equality of opportunity in industrial,\r\ncivil and political life. Our duty is to secure each man against any\r\ninjustice by his fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things to secure for him is the right to\r\nhold and to express the religious views that best meet his own soul\r\nneeds. Any political movement directed against any body of our fellow\r\ncitizens because of their religious creed is a grave offense against\r\nAmerican principles and American institutions. It is a wicked thing\r\neither to support or to oppose a man because of the creed he professes.\r\nThis applies to Jew and Gentile, to Catholic and Protestant, and to\r\nthe man who would be regarded as unorthodox by all of them alike.\r\nPolitical movements directed against men because of their religious\r\nbelief, and intended to prevent men of that creed from holding office,\r\nhave never accomplished anything but harm. This was true in the days\r\nof the “Know-Nothing” and Native-American parties in the middle of the\r\nlast century; and it is just as true today. Such a movement directly\r\ncontravenes the spirit of the Constitution itself. Washington and his\r\nassociates believed that it was essential to the existence of this\r\nRepublic that there should never be any union of Church and State; and\r\nsuch union is partially accomplished wherever a given creed is aided\r\nby the State or when any public servant is elected or defeated because\r\nof his creed. The Constitution explicitly forbids the requiring of\r\nany religious test as a qualification for holding office. To impose\r\nsuch a test by popular vote is as bad as to impose it by law. To vote\r\neither for or against a man because of his creed is to impose upon\r\nhim a religious test and is a clear violation of the spirit of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is well to remember that these movements never achieve the\r\nend they nominally have in view. They do nothing whatsoever except to\r\nincrease among the men of the various churches the spirit of sectarian\r\nintolerance which is base and unlovely in any civilization but which\r\nis utterly revolting among a free people that profess the principles\r\nwe profess. No such movement can ever permanently succeed here. All\r\nthat it does is for a decade or so to greatly increase the spirit of\r\ntheological animosity, both among the people to whom it appeals and\r\namong the people whom it assails. Furthermore, it has in the past\r\ninvariably resulted, in so far as it was successful at all, in putting\r\nunworthy men into office; for there is nothing that a man of loose\r\nprinciples and of evil practices in public life so desires as the\r\nchance to distract attention from his own shortcomings and misdeeds by\r\nexciting and inflaming theological and sectarian prejudice.\r\n\r\nWe must recognize that it is a cardinal sin against democracy to\r\nsupport a man for public office because he belongs to a given creed or\r\nto oppose him because he belongs to a given creed. It is just as evil\r\nas to draw the line between class and class, between occupation and\r\noccupation in political life. No man who tries to draw either line is a\r\ngood American. True Americanism demands that we judge each man on his\r\nconduct, that we so judge him in private life and that we so judge him\r\nin public life. The line of cleavage drawn on principle and conduct in\r\npublic affairs is never in any healthy community identical with the\r\nline of cleavage between creed and creed or between class and class.\r\nOn the contrary, where the community life is healthy, these lines of\r\ncleavage almost always run nearly at right angles to one another. It is\r\neminently necessary to all of us that we should have able and honest\r\npublic officials in the nation, in the city, in the state. If we make\r\na serious and resolute effort to get such officials of the right kind,\r\nmen who shall not only be honest but shall be able and shall take the\r\nright view of public questions, we will find as a matter of fact that\r\nthe men we thus choose will be drawn from the professors of every creed\r\nand from among men who do not adhere to any creed.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-five years I have been more or less actively engaged in\r\npublic life, in the performance of my political duties, now in a public\r\nposition, now in a private position. I have fought with all the\r\nfervor I possessed for the various causes in which with all my heart I\r\nbelieved; and in every fight I thus made I have had with me and against\r\nme Catholics, Protestants and Jews. There have been times when I have\r\nhad to make the fight for or against some man of each creed on grounds\r\nof plain public morality, unconnected with questions of public policy.\r\nThere were other times when I have made such a fight for or against\r\na given man, not on grounds of public morality, for he may have been\r\nmorally a good man, but on account of his attitude on questions of\r\npublic policy, of governmental principle. In both cases, I have always\r\nfound myself fighting beside, and fighting against men of every creed.\r\nThe one sure way to have secured the defeat of every good principle\r\nworth fighting for would have been to have permitted the fight to be\r\nchanged into one along sectarian lines and inspired by the spirit of\r\nsectarian bitterness, either for the purpose of putting into public\r\nlife or of keeping out of public life the believers in any given creed.\r\nSuch conduct represents an assault upon Americanism. The man guilty of\r\nit is not a good American.\r\n\r\nI hold that in this country there must be complete severance of Church\r\nand State; that public moneys shall not be used for the purpose of\r\nadvancing any particular creed; and therefore that the public schools\r\nshall be non-sectarian. As a necessary corollary to this, not only the\r\npupils but the members of the teaching force and the school officials\r\nof all kinds must be treated exactly on a par, no matter what their\r\ncreed; and there must be no more discrimination against Jew or Catholic\r\nor Protestant than discrimination in favor of Jew, Catholic or\r\nProtestant. Whoever makes such discrimination is an enemy of the public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HYPHENATED AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of creed is no less true of nationality. There is no room\r\nin this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated\r\nAmericans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very\r\nbest Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans\r\nborn abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all. This\r\nis just as true of the man who puts “native” before the hyphen as\r\nof the man who puts German or Irish or English or French before the\r\nhyphen. Americanism is a matter of the spirit and of the soul. Our\r\nallegiance must be purely to the United States. We must unsparingly\r\ncondemn any man who holds any other allegiance. But if he is heartily\r\nand singly loyal to this Republic, then no matter where he was born, he\r\nis just as good an American as anyone else.\r\n\r\nThe one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin,\r\nof preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation\r\nat all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling\r\nnationalities, an intricate knot of German-Americans, Irish-Americans,\r\nEnglish-Americans, French-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans or\r\nItalian-Americans, each preserving its separate nationality, each\r\nat heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality,\r\nthan with the other citizens of the American Republic. The men who\r\ndo not become Americans and nothing else are hyphenated Americans;\r\nand there ought to be no room for them in this country. The man who\r\ncalls himself an American citizen and who yet shows by his actions\r\nthat he is primarily the citizen of a foreign land, plays a thoroughly\r\nmischievous part in the life of our body politic. He has no place\r\nhere; and the sooner he returns to the land to which he feels his real\r\nheart-allegiance, the better it will be for every good American. There\r\nis no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The\r\nonly man who is a good American is the man who is an American and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nI appeal to history. Among the generals of Washington in the\r\nRevolutionary War were Greene, Putnam and Lee, who were of English\r\ndescent; Wayne and Sullivan, who were of Irish descent; Marion,\r\nwho was of French descent; Schuyler, who was of Dutch descent, and\r\nMuhlenberg and Herkemer, who were of German descent. But they were\r\nall of them Americans and nothing else, just as much as Washington.\r\nCarroll of Carrollton was a Catholic; Hancock a Protestant; Jefferson\r\nwas heterodox from the standpoint of any orthodox creed; but these and\r\nall the other signers of the Declaration of Independence stood on an\r\nequality of duty and right and liberty, as Americans and nothing else.\r\n\r\nSo it was in the Civil War. Farragut’s father was born in Spain and\r\nSheridan’s father in Ireland; Sherman and Thomas were of English and\r\nCuster of German descent; and Grant came of a long line of American\r\nancestors whose original home had been Scotland. But the Admiral was\r\nnot a Spanish-American; and the Generals were not Scotch-Americans or\r\nIrish-Americans or English-Americans or German-Americans. They were\r\nall Americans and nothing else. This was just as true of Lee and of\r\nStonewall Jackson and of Beauregard.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1909 our battlefleet returned from its voyage around the world,\r\nAdmirals Wainwright and Schroeder represented the best traditions and\r\nthe most effective action in our navy; one was of old American blood\r\nand of English descent; the other was the son of German immigrants. But\r\none was not a native-American and the other a German-American. Each was\r\nan American pure and simple. Each bore allegiance only to the flag of\r\nthe United States. Each would have been incapable of considering the\r\ninterests of Germany or of England or of any other country except the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nTo take charge of the most important work under my administration, the\r\nbuilding of the Panama Canal, I chose General Goethals. Both of his\r\nparents were born in Holland. But he was just plain United States. He\r\nwasn’t a Dutch-American; if he had been I wouldn’t have appointed him.\r\nSo it was with such men, among those who served under me, as Admiral\r\nOsterhaus and General Barry. The father of one was born in Germany, the\r\nfather of the other in Ireland. But they were both Americans, pure and\r\nsimple, and first rate fighting men in addition.\r\n\r\nIn my Cabinet at the time there were men of English and French,\r\nGerman, Irish and Dutch blood, men born on this side and men born in\r\nGermany and Scotland; but they were all Americans and nothing else;\r\nand every one of them was incapable of thinking of himself or of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, excepting in terms of American citizenship. If any\r\none of them had anything in the nature of a dual or divided allegiance\r\nin his soul, he never would have been appointed to serve under me, and\r\nhe would have been instantly removed when the discovery was made. There\r\nwasn’t one of them who was capable of desiring that the policy of the\r\nUnited States should be shaped with reference to the interests of any\r\nforeign country or with consideration for anything, outside of the\r\ngeneral welfare of humanity, save the honor and interest of the United\r\nStates, and each was incapable of making any discrimination whatsoever\r\namong the citizens of the country he served, of our common country,\r\nsave discrimination based on conduct and on conduct alone.\r\n\r\nFor an American citizen to vote as a German-American, an Irish-American\r\nor an English-American is to be a traitor to American institutions;\r\nand those hyphenated Americans who terrorize American politicians by\r\nthreats of the foreign vote are engaged in treason to the American\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PRINCIPLES OF AMERICANISM.\r\n\r\nNow this is a declaration of principles. How are we in practical\r\nfashion to secure the making of these principles part of the very\r\nfiber of our national life? First and foremost let us all resolve\r\nthat in this country hereafter we shall place far less emphasis upon\r\nthe question of right and much greater emphasis upon the matter of\r\nduty. A republic can’t succeed and won’t succeed in the tremendous\r\ninternational stress of the modern world unless its citizens possess\r\nthat form of high-minded patriotism which consists in putting devotion\r\nto duty before the question of individual rights. This must be done in\r\nour family relations or the family will go to pieces; and no better\r\ntract for family life in this country can be imagined than the little\r\nstory called “Mother,” written by an American woman, Kathleen Norris,\r\nwho happens to be a member of your own church.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the family, the foundation stone of our national\r\nlife, is not less true of the entire superstructure. I am, as you\r\nknow, a most ardent believer in national preparedness against war as\r\na means of securing that honorable and self-respecting peace which\r\nis the only peace desired by all high-spirited people. But it is an\r\nabsolute impossibility to secure such preparedness in full and proper\r\nform if it is an isolated feature of our policy. The lamentable fate\r\nof Belgium has shown that no justice in legislation or success in\r\nbusiness will be of the slightest avail if the nation has not prepared\r\nin advance the strength to protect its rights. But it is equally true\r\nthat there cannot be this preparation in advance for military strength\r\nunless there is a social basis of civil and social life behind it.\r\nThere must be social, economic and military preparedness all alike,\r\nall harmoniously developed; and above all there must be spiritual and\r\nmental preparedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PREPAREDNESS.\r\n\r\nThere must be not merely preparedness in things material; there must\r\nbe preparedness in soul and mind. To prepare a great army and navy\r\nwithout preparing a proper national spirit would avail nothing. And\r\nif there is not only a proper national spirit but proper national\r\nintelligence, we shall realize that even from the standpoint of the\r\narmy and navy some civil preparedness is indispensable. For example, a\r\nplan for national defense which does not include the most far-reaching\r\nuse and co-operation of our railroads must prove largely futile. These\r\nrailroads are organized in time of peace. But we must have the most\r\ncarefully thought out organization from the national and centralized\r\nstandpoint in order to use them in time of war. This means first that\r\nthose in charge of them from the highest to the lowest must understand\r\ntheir duty in time of war, must be permeated with the spirit of\r\ngenuine patriotism; and second, that they and we shall understand that\r\nefficiency is as essential as patriotism; one is useless without the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAgain: every citizen should be trained sedulously by every activity at\r\nour command to realize his duty to the nation. In France at this moment\r\nthe workingmen who are not at the front are spending all their energies\r\nwith the single thought of helping their brethren at the front by what\r\nthey do in the munition plant, on the railroads, in the factories. It\r\nis a shocking, a lamentable thing that many of the trade unions of\r\nEngland have taken a directly opposite view. I am not concerned with\r\nwhether it be true, as they assert, that their employers are trying to\r\nexploit them, or, as these employers assert, that the labor men are\r\ntrying to gain profit for those who stay at home at the cost of their\r\nbrethren who fight in the trenches. The thing for us Americans to\r\nrealize is that we must do our best to prevent similar conditions from\r\ngrowing up here. Business men, professional men, and wage workers alike\r\nmust understand that there should be no question of their enjoying any\r\nrights whatsoever unless in the fullest way they recognize and live up\r\nto the duties that go with those rights. This is just as true of the\r\ncorporation as of the trade union, and if either corporation or trade\r\nunion fails heartily to acknowledge this truth, then its activities\r\nare necessarily anti-social and detrimental to the welfare of the\r\nbody politic as a whole. In war time, when the welfare of the nation\r\nis at stake, it should be accepted as axiomatic that the employer is\r\nto make no profit out of the war save that which is necessary to the\r\nefficient running of the business and to the living expenses of himself\r\nand family, and that the wage worker is to treat his wage from exactly\r\nthe same standpoint and is to see to it that the labor organization to\r\nwhich he belongs is, in all its activities, subordinated to the service\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nNow there must be some application of this spirit in times of peace or\r\nwe cannot suddenly develop it in time of war. The strike situation in\r\nthe United States at this time is a scandal to the country as a whole\r\nand discreditable alike to employer and employee. Any employer who\r\nfails to recognize that human rights come first and that the friendly\r\nrelationship between himself and those working for him should be one of\r\npartnership and comradeship in mutual help no less than self-help is\r\nrecreant to his duty as an American citizen and it is to his interest,\r\nhaving in view the enormous destruction of life in the present war, to\r\nconserve, and to train to higher efficiency alike for his benefit and\r\nfor its, the labor supply. In return any employee who acts along the\r\nlines publicly advocated by the men who profess to speak for the I. W.\r\nW. is not merely an open enemy of business but of this entire country\r\nand is out of place in our government.\r\n\r\nYou, Knights of Columbus, are particularly fitted to play a great part\r\nin the movement for national solidarity, without which there can be\r\nno real efficiency in either peace or war. During the last year and a\r\nquarter it has been brought home to us in startling fashion that many\r\nof the elements of our nation are not yet properly fused. It ought\r\nto be a literally appalling fact that members of two of the foreign\r\nembassies in this country have been discovered to be implicated in\r\ninciting their fellow-countrymen, whether naturalized American citizens\r\nor not, to the destruction of property and the crippling of American\r\nindustries that are operating in accordance with internal law and\r\ninternational agreement. The malign activity of one of these embassies\r\nhas been brought home directly to the ambassador in such shape that\r\nhis recall has been forced. The activities of the other have been set\r\nforth in detail by the publication in the press of its letters in\r\nsuch fashion as to make it perfectly clear that they were of the same\r\ngeneral character. Of course, the two embassies were merely carrying\r\nout the instructions of their home governments.\r\n\r\nNor is it only the German and Austrians who take the view that as a\r\nmatter of right they can treat their countrymen resident in America,\r\neven if naturalized citizens of the United States, as their allies\r\nand subjects to be used in keeping alive separate national groups\r\nprofoundly anti-American in sentiment if the contest comes between\r\nAmerican interests and those of foreign lands in question. It has\r\nrecently been announced that the Russian government is to rent a house\r\nin New York as a national center to be Russian in faith and patriotism,\r\nto foster the Russian language and keep alive the national feeling in\r\nimmigrants who come hither. All of this is utterly antagonistic to\r\nproper American sentiment, whether perpetrated in the name of Germany,\r\nof Austria, of Russia, of England, or France or any other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF CITIZENS.\r\n\r\nWe should meet this situation by on the one hand seeing that these\r\nimmigrants get all their rights as American citizens, and on the other\r\nhand insisting that they live up to their duties as American citizens.\r\nAny discrimination against aliens is a wrong, for it tends to put the\r\nimmigrant at a disadvantage and to cause him to feel bitterness and\r\nresentment during the very years when he should be preparing himself\r\nfor American citizenship. If an immigrant is not fit to become a\r\ncitizen, he should not be allowed to come here. If he is fit, he should\r\nbe given all the rights to earn his own livelihood, and to better\r\nhimself, that any man can have. Take such a matter as the illiteracy\r\ntest; I entirely agree with those who feel that many very excellent\r\npossible citizens would be barred improperly by an illiteracy test. But\r\nwhy do you not admit aliens under a bond to learn to read and write\r\nwithin a certain time? It would then be a duty to see that they were\r\ngiven ample opportunity to learn to read and write and that they were\r\ndeported if they failed to take advantage of the opportunity. No man\r\ncan be a good citizen if he is not at least in process of learning to\r\nspeak the language of his fellow-citizens. And an alien who remains\r\nhere without learning to speak English for more than a certain number\r\nof years should at the end of that time be treated as having refused to\r\ntake the preliminary steps necessary to complete Americanization and\r\nshould be deported. But there should be no denial or limitation of the\r\nalien’s opportunity to work, to own property and to take advantage of\r\ncivic opportunities. Special legislation should deal with the aliens\r\nwho do not come here to be made citizens. But the alien who comes\r\nhere intending to become a citizen should be helped in every way to\r\nadvance himself, should be removed from every possible disadvantage and\r\nin return should be required under penalty of being sent back to the\r\ncountry from which he came, to prove that he is in good faith fitting\r\nhimself to be an American citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PREPARATIVES TO PREPAREDNESS.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should devote ourselves as a preparative to preparedness,\r\nalike in peace and war, to secure the three elemental things; one,\r\na common language, the English language; two, the increase in our\r\nsocial loyalty――citizenship absolutely undivided, a citizenship which\r\nacknowledges no flag except the flag of the United States and which\r\nemphatically repudiates all duality of intention or national loyalty;\r\nand third, an intelligent and resolute effort for the removal of\r\nindustrial and social unrest, an effort which shall aim equally at\r\nsecuring every man his rights and to make every man understand that\r\nunless he in good faith performs his duties he is not entitled to any\r\nrights at all.\r\n\r\nThe American people should itself do these things for the immigrants.\r\nIf we leave the immigrant to be helped by representatives of foreign\r\ngovernments, by foreign societies, by a press and institutions\r\nconducted in a foreign language and in the interest of foreign\r\ngovernments, and if we permit the immigrants to exist as alien groups,\r\neach group sundered from the rest of the citizens of the country, we\r\nshall store up for ourselves bitter trouble in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MILITARY PREPAREDNESS.\r\n\r\nI am certain that the only permanently safe attitude for this country\r\nas regards national preparedness for self-defense is along its\r\nlines of universal service on the Swiss model. Switzerland is the\r\nmost democratic of nations. Its army is the most democratic army\r\nin the world. There isn’t a touch of militarism or aggressiveness\r\nabout Switzerland. It has been found as a matter of actual practical\r\nexperience in Switzerland that the universal military training has made\r\na very marked increase in social efficiency and in the ability of the\r\nman thus trained to do well for himself in industry. The man who has\r\nreceived the training is a better citizen, is more self-respecting,\r\nmore orderly, better able to hold his own, and more willing to respect\r\nthe rights of others and at the same time he is a more valuable and\r\nbetter paid man in his business. We need that the navy and the army\r\nshould be greatly increased and that their efficiency as units and in\r\nthe aggregate should be increased to an even greater degree than their\r\nnumbers. An adequate regular reserve should be established. Economy\r\nshould be insisted on, and first of all in the abolition of useless\r\narmy posts and navy yards. The National Guard should be supervised and\r\ncontrolled by the Federal War Department. Training camps such as at\r\nPlattsburg should be provided on a nationwide basis and the government\r\nshould pay the expenses. Foreign-born as well as native-born citizens\r\nshould be brought together in those camps; and each man at the camp\r\nshould take the oath of allegiance as unreservedly and unqualifiedly\r\nas the men of its regular army and navy now take it. Not only should\r\nbattleships, battle cruisers, submarines, ample coast and field\r\nartillery be provided and a greater ammunition supply system, but\r\nthere should be a utilization of those engaged in such professions\r\nas the ownership and management of motor cars, in aviation, and in\r\nthe profession of engineering. Map-making and road improvement should\r\nbe attended to, and, as I have already said, the railroads brought\r\ninto intimate touch with the War Department. Moreover, the government\r\nshould deal with conservation of all necessary war supplies such\r\nas mine products, potash, oil lands and the like. Furthermore, all\r\nmunition plants should be carefully surveyed with special reference\r\nto their geographic distribution and for the possibility of increased\r\nmunition and supply factories. Finally, remember that the men must be\r\nsedulously trained in peace to use this material or we shall merely\r\nprepare our ships, guns and products as gifts to the enemy. All of\r\nthese things should be done in any event, but let us never forget that\r\nthe most important of all things is to introduce universal military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nBut let me repeat that this preparedness against war must be based upon\r\nefficiency and justice in the handling of ourselves in time of peace.\r\nIf belligerent governments, while we are not hostile to them but merely\r\nneutral, strive nevertheless to make of this nation many nations, each\r\nhostile to the others and none of them loyal to the central government,\r\nthen it may be accepted as certain that they would do far worse to us\r\nin time of war. If they encourage strikes and sabotage in our munition\r\nplants while we are neutral it may be accepted as axiomatic that they\r\nwould do far worse to us if we were hostile. It is our duty from the\r\nstandpoint of self-defense to secure the complete Americanization\r\nof our people. To make of the many peoples of this country a united\r\nnation, one in speech and feeling and all, so far as possible, sharers\r\nin the best that each has brought to our shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AMERICANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe foreign-born population of this country must be an Americanized\r\npopulation――no other kind can fight the battles of America either in\r\nwar or peace. It must talk the language of its native-born fellow\r\ncitizens, it must possess American citizenship and American ideals.\r\nIt must stand firm by its oath of allegiance in word and deed and\r\nmust show that in very fact it has renounced allegiance to every\r\nprince, potentate or foreign government. It must be maintained on an\r\nAmerican standard of living so as to prevent labor disturbances in\r\nimportant plants and at critical times. None of these objects can be\r\nsecured as long as we have immigrant colonies, ghettos, and immigrant\r\nsections, and above all they cannot be assured so long as we consider\r\nthe immigrant only as an industrial asset. The immigrant must not be\r\nallowed to drift or to be put at the mercy of the exploiter. Our object\r\nis not to imitate one of the older racial types, but to maintain a\r\nnew American type and then to secure loyalty to this type. We cannot\r\nsecure such loyalty unless we make this a country where men shall feel\r\nthat they have justice and also where they shall feel that they are\r\nrequired to perform the duties imposed upon them. The policy of “Let\r\nalone” which we have hitherto pursued is thoroughly vicious from two\r\nstandpoints. By this policy we have permitted the immigrants, and too\r\noften the native-born laborers as well, to suffer injustice. Moreover,\r\nby this policy we have failed to impress upon the immigrant and upon\r\nthe native-born as well that they are expected to do justice as well as\r\nto receive justice, that they are expected to be heartily and actively\r\nand single-mindedly loyal to the flag no less than to benefit by living\r\nunder it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to continue to use hundreds of thousands of immigrants\r\nmerely as industrial assets while they remain social outcasts and\r\nmenaces any more than fifty years ago we could afford to keep the black\r\nman merely as an industrial asset and not as a human being. We cannot\r\nafford to build a big industrial plant and herd men and women about\r\nit without care for their welfare. We cannot afford to permit squalid\r\novercrowding or the kind of living system which makes impossible the\r\ndecencies and necessities of life. We cannot afford the low wage rates\r\nand the merely seasonal industries which mean the sacrifice of both\r\nindividual and family life and morals to the industrial machinery. We\r\ncannot afford to leave American mines, munitions plants and general\r\nresources in the hands of alien workmen, alien to America and even\r\nlikely to be made hostile to America by machinations such as have\r\nrecently been provided in the case of the two foreign embassies in\r\nWashington. We cannot afford to run the risk of having in time of war\r\nmen working on our railways or working in our munition plants who would\r\nin the name of duty to their own foreign countries bring destruction\r\nto us. Recent events have shown us that incitements to sabotage and\r\nstrikes are in the view of at least two of the great foreign powers of\r\nEurope within their definition of neutral practices. What would be done\r\nto us in the name of war if these things are done to us in the name of\r\nneutrality?\r\n\r\nJustice Dowling in his speech has described the excellent fourth\r\ndegree of your order, of how in it you dwell upon duties rather than\r\nrights, upon the great duties of patriotism and of national spirit.\r\nIt is a fine thing to have a society that holds up such a standard of\r\nduty. I ask you to make a special effort to deal with Americanization,\r\nthe fusing into one nation, a nation necessarily different from all\r\nother nations, of all who come to our shores. Pay heed to the three\r\nprincipal essentials: (1) The need of a common language, with a minimum\r\namount of illiteracy; (2) the need of a common civil standard, similar\r\nideals, beliefs and customs symbolized by the oath of allegiance to\r\nAmerica; and (3) the need of a high standard of living, of reasonable\r\nequality of opportunity and of social and industrial justice. In every\r\ngreat crisis in our history, in the Revolution and in the Civil War,\r\nand in the lesser crises, like the Spanish war, all factions and races\r\nhave been forgotten in the common spirit of Americanism. Protestant and\r\nCatholic, men of English or of French, of Irish or of German descent\r\nhave joined with a single-minded purpose to secure for the country what\r\nonly can be achieved by the resultant union of all patriotic citizens.\r\nYou of this organization have done a great service by your insistence\r\nthat citizens should pay heed first of all to their duties. Hitherto\r\nundue prominence has been given to the question of rights. Your\r\norganization is a splendid engine for giving to the stranger within our\r\ngates a high conception of American citizenship. Strive for unity. We\r\nsuffer at present from a lack of leadership in these matters.\r\n\r\nEven in the matter of national defense there is such a labyrinth of\r\ncommittees and counsels and advisors that there is a tendency on the\r\npart of the average citizen to become confused and do nothing. I ask\r\nyou to help strike the note that shall unite our people. As a people\r\nwe must be united. If we are not united we shall slip into the gulf of\r\nmeasureless disaster. We must be strong in purpose for our own defense\r\nand bent on securing justice within our borders. If as a nation we are\r\nsplit into warring camps, if we teach our citizens not to look upon one\r\nanother as brothers but as enemies divided by the hatred of creed for\r\ncreed or of those of one race against those of another race, surely\r\nwe shall fail and our great democratic experiment on this continent\r\nwill go down in crushing overthrow. I ask you here to-night and those\r\nlike you to take a foremost part in the movement――a young men’s\r\nmovement――for a greater and better America in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ONE AMERICA.\r\n\r\nAll of us, no matter from what land our parents came, no matter in\r\nwhat way we may severally worship our Creator, must stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder in a united America for the elimination of race and religious\r\nprejudice. We must stand for a reign of equal justice to both big and\r\nsmall. We must insist on the maintenance of the American standard of\r\nliving. We must stand for an adequate national control which shall\r\nsecure a better training of our young men in time of peace, both\r\nfor the work of peace and for the work of war. We must direct every\r\nnational resource, material and spiritual, to the task not of shirking\r\ndifficulties, but of training our people to overcome difficulties.\r\nOur aim must be, not to make life easy and soft, not to soften soul\r\nand body, but to fit us in virile fashion to do a great work for all\r\nmankind. This great work can only be done by a mighty democracy, with\r\nthese qualities of soul, guided by those qualities of mind, which will\r\nboth make it refuse to do injustice to any other nation, and also\r\nenable it to hold its own against aggression by any other nation. In\r\nour relations with the outside world, we must abhor wrongdoing, and\r\ndisdain to commit it, and we must no less disdain the baseness of\r\nspirit which lamely submits to wrongdoing. Finally and most important\r\nof all, we must strive for the establishment within our own borders\r\nof that stern and lofty standard of personal and public neutrality\r\nwhich shall guarantee to each man his rights, and which shall insist\r\nin return upon the full performance by each man of his duties both\r\nto his neighbor and to the great nation whose flag must symbolize in\r\nthe future as it has symbolized in the past the highest hopes of all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n ――Punctuation and spelling inaccuracies were silently corrected.\r\n\r\n ――Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved.",
