Under Cardwell's roof the Irish Question was\r\nfully discussed by able men, Robert Lowe among the number. But I had a\r\nstill greater advantage in constant and lasting intercourse with such\r\nfriends as Lord Chancellor O'Hagan, Sir Alexander Macdonald, the head of\r\nthe Education Department, and other leading Irish Liberals of the moderate\r\nschool, ardent patriots and thoroughgoing reformers though opposed to\r\nviolence and disruption. To the teachings of these men in dealing with the\r\nIrish Question, I have always looked back for my best guidance. I did what\r\nI could generally to acquaint myself with the country and its people. I\r\nhad the opportunity of seeing something of Maynooth as the guest of its\r\nexcellent principal in that day. At that time there was rather a lull in\r\nthe agrarian war, but religious antagonism was still marked. The fruit of\r\nmy studies was a little book entitled \"Irish History and Irish\r\nCharacter,\" in which I tried to show that the sources of Ireland's sorrows\r\nwere to be found in natural circumstance and historical accident as much\r\nas in the crimes or follies of man in recent times. Upon that text I\r\npreached in favour of charity and reconciliation. I am told that a chord\r\nwas touched at the time. But my essay has long been superseded and buried\r\nout of sight by the important works, historical and political, which the\r\ncontroversy has since produced, as well as by the forty eventful years\r\nwhich have elapsed since its publication. The subject, however, has\r\nretained all its interest, and my confidence in the wisdom of my Irish\r\nfriends and instructors has remained the same, or rather has been\r\nstrengthened by the course of events.\r\n\r\nI was in Ireland again a good many years afterwards in connection with the\r\nmeeting of the Social Science Association, and was the guest of Lord\r\nO'Hagan. The Parnellite Movement was then in full activity; American\r\nFenianism was at work; and the soil heaved with insurrection. My friend W.\r\nE. Forster was the Secretary, and, much against his own inclination, was\r\nadministering measures of repression, the only alternative to which\r\nappeared to be the abdication of the government. On this occasion I was\r\nunlucky enough to draw upon myself a thunderbolt hurled through the\r\n_Times_, but evidently from the skies, by hinting in a public speech that\r\nthe Phoenix Park was as worthy to be the occasional residence of royalty\r\nas Osborne or Balmoral. A happy change, attended apparently with the best\r\neffects, has now come in that august quarter.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that this essay does not pretend to be a history of\r\nIreland. It is an attempt to trace the general course of the history as it\r\nleads up to the present situation.\r\n\r\nThe works published in recent years to which I have been chiefly indebted\r\nare: Joyce's \"Social History of Ancient Ireland,\" Richie's \"Short History\r\nof the Irish People,\" Bagwell's \"Ireland under the Tudors,\" Froude's \"The\r\nEnglish in Ireland,\" Lecky's \"Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland,\"\r\ntogether with the special chapters on Ireland in his general history,\r\nIngram's \"Two Chapters of Irish History\" and \"History of the Irish Union,\"\r\nBall's \"Irish Legislative Systems,\" T. P. O'Connor's \"The Parnell\r\nMovement,\" and Sir Horace Plunkett's \"Ireland in the Twentieth Century,\"\r\nwith the comments on it by Father O'Riordan.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Bagwell's \"Ireland under the Tudors\" I am specially indebted for\r\nhis narrative of the Tudor wars. To Mr. T. P. O'Connor I am specially\r\nindebted for the most vivid accounts of the famine and of the evictions,\r\nas well as for an improved insight into the Parnell Movement and of the\r\ndoings which preceded it. Of part of those doings I was myself in some\r\nmeasure a witness, through my social connections with a circle of English\r\npoliticians who were inclining to an Irish alliance.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the Tudor wars are horrible and heartrending. But history\r\ncannot drop the veil over them. They long left their evil traces on Irish\r\ncharacter and sentiment, explaining and extenuating some terrible things\r\nwhich ensued. Nor, in truth, have they become obsolete as warnings to us\r\nin general of the acts into which civilized nations may be betrayed when\r\nthey make wars of conquest on those whom they deem barbarians.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that a brief account of the recent land legislation for Ireland\r\nmight be useful to readers of an essay of this kind. I append one which\r\nhas been prepared for me by my friend, Mr. Hugh J. McCann, B.L., of the\r\nDublin Bar. Its author is in no way committed to any opinion expressed in\r\nthe other part of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            PAGE\r\n\r\n     I FROM EARLY TIMES TO EDWARD I (1272)                     1\r\n\r\n    II EDWARD I TO HENRY VII (1272-1509)                      19\r\n\r\n   III HENRY VIII TO MARY (1509-1558)                         28\r\n\r\n    IV ELIZABETH TO JAMES I (1558-1603)                       37\r\n\r\n     V JAMES I (1603-1625)                                    55\r\n\r\n    VI CHARLES I TO THE PROTECTORATE (1625-1660)              61\r\n\r\n   VII THE RESTORATION (1660)                                 80\r\n\r\n  VIII THE REVOLUTION (1688)                                  86\r\n\r\n    IX THE PENAL CODE (1695-1727)                             91\r\n\r\n     X ANNE TO THE REVOLUTION OF 1782 (1702-1782)            105\r\n\r\n    XI THE REVOLUTION OF 1782 AND THE REBELLION OF 1798      121\r\n\r\n   XII UNION (1801)                                          148\r\n\r\n  XIII DANIEL O'CONNELL (1823-1847)                          164\r\n\r\n   XIV GLADSTONE (1868-1893)                                 191\r\n\r\n    XV THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION                     204\r\n\r\n       ACCOUNT OF THE IRISH LAND CODE                        227\r\n         By HUGH J. MCCANN, B.L., of the Irish Bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH HISTORY AND THE IRISH QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all histories the history of Ireland is the saddest. For nearly seven\r\ncenturies it was a course of strife between races, bloodshed, massacre,\r\nmisgovernment, civil war, oppression, and misery. Hardly even now have the\r\ntroubles of Ireland come to a close, either for herself or for her\r\npartner. Unrest still reigns in her and, embodied in her Parliamentary\r\ndelegation, harasses the Parliament and distracts the councils of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe theatre of this tragedy is a large island lying beside one nearly\r\nthree times larger, which cuts it off from the continent of Europe, while\r\non the other side it fronts the wide ocean. The climate is for the most\r\npart too wet for wheat. The pasture is very rich. Ireland seems by nature\r\nto be a grazing country, and a country of large farms; tillage and small\r\nfarms have been enforced by the redundance of rural population consequent\r\non the destruction of urban industries. In coal and minerals Ireland is\r\npoor, while the sister island abounds in them, and in its swarming\r\nfactories and mines furnishes a first-rate market for the produce of Irish\r\npastures; so that the two islands are commercial supplements of each\r\nother. The progress of pastoral countries, political and general, as they\r\nhave little city life, is slow. With beauty Ireland is well endowed. The\r\ninterior is flat, with large peat bogs and brimming rivers. But the coast\r\nis mountainous and romantic. The western coast especially, where the\r\nAtlantic rolls into deep inlets, has a pensive charm which, when troubles\r\nend and settled peace reigns, may attract the villa as they do the\r\nwanderer now. In early times the island was densely clothed with woods,\r\nwhich, with the broad and bridgeless rivers, operated like the mountain\r\nbarriers of the Scottish Highlands in perpetuating the division of clans,\r\nwith their patriarchal system, their rivalries, and their feuds, thus\r\nprecluding the growth of a nation. In Ireland there was no natural centre\r\nof dominion. Interest of every kind seems to enjoin the union of the\r\nislands. But in the age of conquest the weaker island was pretty sure to\r\nbe marked as a prey of the stronger, while the difficulties of access, the\r\nChannel, broad in the days of primitive navigation, and the Welsh\r\nmountains, combined with the internal barriers of forest and river and\r\nwith the naturally wild habits of the people, portended that the conquest\r\nwould be difficult and that the agony would be long. Such was the mould of\r\nDestiny.\r\n\r\nThe people of Ireland when history opens were Celts, kinsmen of the\r\nprimitive races of Gaul and Britain, remnants of which are left in Wales\r\nand in the Highlands of Scotland. Their language was of that family, while\r\ncognate words connect it with the general Aryan stock. There are traces of\r\na succession of immigrations. Too much, no doubt, has been made of the\r\ninfluence of race. Yet the Teuton is a Teuton and the Celt is a Celt. The\r\nCelt in his native state has everywhere shown himself lively, social,\r\ncommunicative, impulsive, prone to laughter and to tears, wanting,\r\ncompared with the Teuton, in depth of character, in steadiness and\r\nperseverance. He is inclined rather to personal rule or leadership than to\r\na constitutional polity. His poet is not Shakespeare or Milton, but Tom\r\nMoore, a light minstrel of laughter and tears. His political leader is\r\nO'Connell, a Boanerges of passionate declamation. In war he is impetuous,\r\nas was the Gaul who charged at Allia and the Highlander who charged at\r\nKilliecrankie and Prestonpans. His taste as well as his manual skill in\r\ndecoration is shown by the brilliant collection of gold ornaments in the\r\nCeltic Museum at Dublin, as well as in stone carvings and such a paragon\r\nof illuminated missals as the Book of Kells. But it is greater than his\r\naptitude for high art, that art which treats the human form, in which he\r\nhas not shone. His religious tendency, the outcome of his general\r\ncharacter, is either to Catholicism with its fervid faith, its mysteries,\r\nand its ceremonial, as in Ireland; or to the enthusiastic forms of\r\nProtestantism, as in the Highlands and in Wales. Anglicanism, a sober cult\r\nwith a balanced creed, suits him not. It was a cruel decree of destiny\r\nthat the larger island from which the conqueror would come was peopled by\r\nthe Teuton, so that to the usual evils of conquest was added that of a\r\ndifference of character inherent in race.\r\n\r\nThe primitive organization of the Irish Celts was tribal, the underlying\r\nidea being kinship, real or reputed. The ruler with paternal authority was\r\nthe chief of the tribe. To avert strife his tanist, or successor, was\r\nelected in his lifetime. In a community of reputed kinsmen there could be\r\nno aristocracy of birth; but there seems to have been a plutocracy, whose\r\nriches in that pastoral country consisted of cattle, which formed the\r\nmeasure of wealth and command of which made poorer clansmen their\r\nretainers. Under these were the freemen of the tribe. Under the freemen\r\nagain were the unfree, wanderers or captives taken in war or slaves from\r\nthe English slave-market. The unfree appear to have been the only tillers\r\nof the soil. Thus tillage was marked with a bar sinister from its birth.\r\nThe tribal law was a mystical and largely fanciful craft or tradition in\r\nthe keeping of the Brehons, or judges, a hereditary order who, though\r\nrevered as arbiters, were without power of enforcing their judgments. Like\r\nprimitive law in general, it lacked the idea of public wrong. It treated\r\ncrime as a private injury, to be compounded by fine. The land was the\r\ncommon property of the tribe, to which it nominally reverted on the demise\r\nof the holder, though it may be assumed that the chiefs at all events had\r\npractically land of their own and that the tendency in this, as in other\r\ncases, was to private ownership.\r\n\r\nWhat the religion was is not certainly known. Probably it was the same as\r\nthat of the Celts of Great Britain and Gaul, Druidism, wild, orgiastic,\r\nand perhaps sanguinary. But there seem to be no remains clearly Druidic in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nLife was pastoral, roving, probably bellicose. It appears that women\r\nrequired to be restrained from taking part in war. The characteristic garb\r\nof the tribesman was a loose saffron mantle, which served as his dress by\r\nday, his coverlet by night. His favourite weapons, often used, were an axe\r\nand a dart. He drew, it seems, a bow weak compared with the long-bow of\r\nEngland. The gentler side of his character was shown in his passionate\r\nlove of the harp and the reverence in which he held the harper, and which\r\nwas extended to the bard, whose rude lays saluted the intellectual dawn\r\nand whom we find in later times feared as an author of lampoons. Among his\r\nfavourite amusements was chess.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the peculiar system of the Irish, political and legal, is of\r\nmore consequence because the opposite system, that of constitutional\r\ngovernment and feudal ownership, having presented itself to him as that of\r\nalien masters and oppressors, tribal peculiarities and sentiments lingered\r\nlong. The idea of tribal ownership perhaps was a few generations ago still\r\nfaintly present in agrarian agitation. Nor has the general character of\r\nthe tribesman long been, if it yet is, extinct. Tribal feuds were until\r\nlately represented in the strange faction fights of the Caravats and\r\nShanavests, the Two-Year-Olds and Three-Year-Olds, the annual fight of\r\nfactions for a legendary stone, and the encounters between bodies of the\r\npeasantry at Irish fairs. Perhaps another feature of character traceable\r\nto tribalism may be the gregarious habit of Irishmen contrasted with the\r\nEnglishman's isolation and love of his private home.\r\n\r\nConnected apparently with the tribal sentiment were the strange customs of\r\nfosterage and gossipred. Fosterage consisted in putting out the child to\r\nbe reared by a tribesman who became its foster-father. Gossipred, a\r\nChristian addition, was a spiritual kinship formed at the font. Both\r\nrelations had extraordinary force.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, tribal wars. There were leagues or dominations of\r\npowerful tribes which left their traces in the division of the island into\r\nfour or five provinces, once petty kingships. There was a supreme\r\nkingship, the seat of which, sacred in Irish tradition and legend, was the\r\nHill of Tara; but it was probably only when common danger compelled a\r\nunion of forces that this kingship became a real power. The features of\r\nthe country, combined with the character of the tribal organization based\r\non kinship, not on citizenship, would prolong the tribal divisions and\r\nprevent union. Nor had nature anywhere fixed a central seat of command.\r\nOnly when opposed to an invader and struggling against him for the land\r\ndid Celtic Ireland form for the time a united people; even then it could\r\nhardly be called a nation.\r\n\r\nThe Roman conqueror looked, but came not. It might have been better for\r\nIreland if he had come. Yet, when he retired, he would probably have left\r\nthe Romanized provincial, here as in Britain, too unwarlike to hold his\r\nown against the next invader.\r\n\r\nA conqueror of a different kind came. He came in the person, not of a\r\nRoman general, but, if the tradition is true, of a slave. By the preaching\r\nof St. Patrick, according to the common belief, Ireland was added to the\r\nKingdom of Christ. The conversion was rapid and probably superficial, the\r\nchief of the tribe carrying the tribe over with him, as Ethelbert of Kent\r\nand other English kinglets carried over their people, rather to a new\r\nreligious allegiance than to a new faith.\r\n\r\nWithin the Roman Empire the centres of the Church had been the cities.\r\nCities were the seats of its bishoprics. The models of its organization\r\nwere urban. But in Ireland there were no cities. The episcopate was\r\nirregular and weak, denoting rank rather than authority or jurisdiction.\r\nThe life of the Church was monastic and missionary. The weird Round\r\nTowers, believed to have been places of refuge for its ministers and their\r\nsacred vessels, as well as bell-towers, speak of a life surrounded by\r\nbarbarism and rapine as well as threatened by the heathen and devastating\r\nNorthmen. Partly perhaps owing to its comparative isolation and detachment\r\nat home, the Irish clergy was fired with a marvellous and almost\r\npreternatural zeal for the propagation of the Gospel abroad. It crossed\r\nthe sea to Iona, the sacred isle, still to religious memory sacred, from\r\nwhich the light of the Gospel shone to the wild islesmen and to the rovers\r\nof the Northern Sea. Irish missionaries preached to heathen Germany,\r\ncolliding there, it seems, with a more regular episcopate. They played a\r\npart in the conversion of Britain not less important than that of the\r\nmissionaries of Rome, before whose authority, however, the Irish Church in\r\nthe person of Aidan was at last compelled to retire, the decisive struggle\r\ntaking place on the mode of celebrating Easter.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland itself there arose in connection with the Church a precocious\r\nand romantic passion for learning which founded primitive universities.\r\nIts memory lingers in the melancholy ruins of Clonmacnoise. This was the\r\ndelusive brightness of a brief day, to be followed by the darkness of a\r\nlong night.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Ireland seems in its origin to have been national and\r\nneither child nor vassal of Rome. Its theology must have been independent\r\nif Scotus Erigena was its son. But Rome gradually cast her spell, in time\r\nshe extended her authority, over it. Its heads looked to her as the\r\ncentral support of the interests of their order and as their protectress\r\nagainst the rude encroachments of the native chiefs. Norman Archbishops of\r\nCanterbury served as transmitters of the influence. Still, the Irish\r\nChurch was not in Roman eyes perfectly regular. Tithes were not paid, nor\r\nwas the rule of consanguinity observed, or the rite of baptism\r\nadministered in strict accordance with the ordinances of Rome.\r\n\r\nChristianity did not kill the brood of a lively superstition, the fairy,\r\nthe banshee, the spectre, charms, amulets, prophecies, wild legends, which\r\nin the times of gloom that followed strengthened their hold upon Irish\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nHostile invasion came first in the form of the Northmen, whose piracy and\r\nrapine extended to Ireland as well as to Gaul and Britain. Piracy and\r\nrapine we call them now, but to the Northmen they seemed no more criminal\r\nthan to us seems hunting or fishing. The chief objects of the invader's\r\nattack were the monasteries, at once treasuries of Church wealth and\r\nhateful to the people of Odin. Ruthlessly the Northman slew and burned.\r\nHis fleet made him ubiquitous and baffled defence, union for which there\r\nwas not at first among the tribes. Common danger at last enforced it. A\r\nnational leader arose in the person of Brian Boru, who was for Ireland the\r\nmilitary, though not the political, saviour that Alfred was for England.\r\nAt the great battle of Clontarf, the host over which the Danish Raven flew\r\nwas totally overthrown, and Ireland was redeemed from its ravages. The\r\nDane, however, did not wholly depart. Exchanging the rover for the trader,\r\nhe founded a set of little maritime commonwealths at Dublin, Wexford,\r\nWaterford, and Limerick, germs on a small scale and in a rude way of\r\nmunicipal as well as commercial life.\r\n\r\nBut a conqueror, more fell and more tenacious than the Dane, was at hand.\r\nIn 1169 a little fleet of Welsh vessels ran into the Bay of Bannow. From\r\nit landed a band of mail-clad soldiery, men trained to war, with a corps\r\nof archers. They were Normans from Wales under the leadership of the\r\nAnglo-Norman rover Fitzstephen, and were the precursors of a larger body\r\nwhich presently followed, under Richard Strigul, Earl of Pembroke, from\r\nthe strength of his arm surnamed Strongbow. Dermot, an Irish chief,\r\nexpelled for his tyranny, had brought these invaders on his country as the\r\ninstruments of his revenge. Henry II. had, by giving letters of marque,\r\nsanctioned the enterprise, the fruits of which he intended to reap. Early\r\nin his reign the king had obtained from Pope Adrian IV., an Englishman by\r\nbirth, a bull authorizing him to take possession of Ireland, which with\r\nother islands the bull declared of right to be an appanage of the Holy\r\nSee. Here, as in the case of William's invasion of England, the Papacy\r\nused Norman conquest as the instrument of its own aggrandizement. The\r\nauthenticity of the bull is disputed by Irish patriotism, but in vain. No\r\none questions the share of the Papacy in the Norman conquest of England.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of his Norman allies, to whom the Irishman with his naked\r\nvalour was as the Mexican to the Spaniard, Dermot prevailed and glutted\r\nhis revenge by plucking from the triumphal pyramid of hostile heads that\r\nof his chief enemy and tearing it with his teeth. But in this case, as in\r\nthat of the alliance of Cortez with the Tlascalans, the ally had\r\nconquered for himself. Declining to be dislodged, he proceeded to\r\nestablish himself and to organize a Norman principality.\r\n\r\nNow the jealousy of the English king was aroused. He saw an independent\r\nAnglo-Norman kingdom on the point of being founded by Strongbow in\r\nIreland. He published the papal bull, came over to Ireland in his power,\r\nand held his court at Dublin in a palace of wickerwork run up in native\r\nstyle for the occasion, where the Irish chiefs bowed their heads, but not\r\ntheir hearts, before him. He organized a feudal principality with himself\r\nas lord, but having the Pope as its suzerain, and tributary to the Papacy.\r\nHe formally introduced the organization of a feudal kingdom. He held at\r\nCashel a synod like that held by William the Conqueror at Winchester for\r\nthe purpose of reforming, that is thoroughly Romanizing, the Church of\r\nIreland. Irregularities respecting infant baptism and the matrimonial\r\ntable of consanguinity were set right. The payment of tithes, that\r\nparamount duty of piety, was enjoined. Rome was installed in full\r\nauthority, thus in Ireland, as in England, receiving from her Norman\r\nliegemen her share of their prize. With this pious offering to the Papacy\r\nin his hand, Henry departed to meet his responsibility for the slaying of\r\nBecket. He was presently succeeded for a short time in Ireland by his\r\nhopeful boy, John, whose personal behaviour was an earnest of the future\r\ntenour of his reign. Afterward, as king, John paid Ireland another flying\r\nvisit in which, besides pouncing on an enemy, he seems to have made a\r\nfleeting attempt to regulate the government.\r\n\r\nHenry, had he not been called away by the storm following the death of\r\nBecket, might have left things in better shape, but nothing could make up\r\nfor the permanent absence of the king. Two antagonistic systems henceforth\r\nconfronted each other. On one side was the feudal system, with its\r\nhierarchy of land-owners, from lord-paramount to tenant-paravail; its\r\nindividual ownership of land; its hereditary succession and primogeniture;\r\nits feudal perquisites, relief, wardship, and marriage; its tribute of\r\nmilitary service; the loyalty to the grantor of the fief which was its\r\npervading and sustaining spirit; its knighthood and its chivalry; its\r\nGreat Council of barons and baronial bishops; its feudal courts of justice\r\nand officers of state; all however highly rude and imperfect. On the other\r\nside was tribalism, with its tie of original kinship instead of\r\nterritorial subordination; its tanistry; its Brehon law. But the feudal\r\nsystem in Ireland lacked the keystone of its arch. It was destitute of\r\nits regulating and controlling power, the king. A royal justiciar could\r\nnot fill the part. From the outset the bane of the principality was\r\ndelegated rule.\r\n\r\nIreland was a separate realm, though attached to the Crown of England. It\r\nhad a Parliament of its own, which followed that of England in its\r\ndevelopment, being at first a unicameral council of magnates, lay and\r\nclerical; but after the legislation of Edward I. a bicameral assembly with\r\na Lower House formed of representatives of counties and boroughs, whose\r\nconsent would be formally necessary to taxation. Representatives of\r\nIreland were at first called to Edward's Parliament at Westminster, but\r\nthe inconvenience seems to have been found too great. Weak, however, was\r\nthe Parliament of the colony compared with that of the imperial country.\r\nIf the Lords ever showed force, the making of a House of Commons was not\r\nthere. The representation, as well as the proceedings and the records,\r\nappears to have been very irregular. Nothing worthy of the name of\r\nParliamentary government seems ever to have prevailed. Among those who\r\nsigned the Great Charter was the Archbishop of Dublin; but of chartered\r\nrights Ireland was not the scene. There is no appearance of a separate\r\ngrant of subsidies by the clerical estate. The clergy, it seems, were\r\nrepresented by their proctors in the Lower House, as by the bishops and\r\nabbots in the Upper House. The Parliament appears to have been generally a\r\ntool in the hands of the deputy. The irregularity of its composition seems\r\nto have extended to its meetings.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the relation between the feudal realm and that of the\r\ntribes was border war. They were alien to each other in race, language,\r\nand social habits, as well as in political institutions. The Norman could\r\nnot subdue the Celt, the Celt could not oust the Norman. The conquest of\r\nEngland by William of Normandy had been complete, and had given birth to a\r\nnational aristocracy, which in time blended with the conquered race and\r\nunited with it in extorting the Great Charter. The Norman colony in\r\nIreland was left to its feeble resources, and to a divided command, while\r\nthe monarchy was far away over sea, was squandering its forces in French\r\nfields, and could not even project a complete conquest. Besides, there\r\nwere the difficulties which the country, with its broad rivers, its bogs,\r\nits mountains and forests, opposed to the heavy cavalry of the\r\nAnglo-Norman. There was the mobility of a pastoral people, presenting no\r\ncities or centres of any kind for attack, driving its cattle to the woods\r\non the approach of the invader, and eluding his pursuit like birds of the\r\nair. Thus the Anglo-Norman colony failed to become a dominion and\r\npresently dwindled to a pale. Between the Pale and the Celt incessant war\r\nwas waged with the usual atrocity of struggles between the half-civilized\r\nand the savage. Fusion there could be none. There was not the bond of\r\nhuman brotherhood or that of a common tongue. On neither side was the\r\nmurder of the other race a crime. Never was there a more inauspicious\r\nbaptism of a nation.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Norman and Celt, feudalist and tribesman, alike were Catholics. A\r\ncommon religion might have been a bond, a common clergy might have been a\r\nmediating power. But race and language prevailed over religion. The\r\nChurches, though outwardly of the same faith, remained inwardly separate,\r\nand not only separate but hostile to each other, the clergy on both sides\r\nsharing the spirit and the atrocities of race enmity and frontier war. The\r\nChurch of the tribes was still very rough and irregular. The Norman on his\r\npart was devout. He was a founder of monasteries, thereby discharging his\r\nconscience of a load not seldom heavy. Whatever of religious life and\r\nactivity there was in the Pale seems to have been monastic. Our glimpses\r\nof the secular clergy show that they were secular indeed. Among them not\r\nneglect of duty only but criminality appears to have been rife.\r\n\r\nIn the little commercial towns of Danish foundation on the coast which had\r\nbeen taken over by the Norman, life was probably rather more civilized;\r\nbut they were too diminutive to exert any influence beyond their gates.\r\nGalway in time became the port of an active trade with Spain which is\r\nsupposed to have left a Spanish trace on its architecture and a Spanish\r\nstrain in the blood of its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not likely that the colony, in the state in which it was, would\r\ngain by emigration from England. It was probably losing by depletion.\r\nEnglish kings drew soldiers from it for their wars. There being no\r\nuniversity or means of education, youths who wanted to study went to\r\nOxford, where, though they were not native Irish, they seem to have played\r\nin academical brawls the part which native Irish might have played. Thus\r\nthe colony was emptied of its intellect. Fiefs by feudal rule of descent\r\npassed to absentees and to women, weakening its military force. In every\r\nway the life-blood of the English and feudal settlement was being\r\ncontinually withdrawn. Of the kings of England, Richard I. was away on\r\ncrusade, John and Henry III. were wrestling with rebellion at home. The\r\nthoughts of Edward I. were turned to Ireland; but his energies were\r\nabsorbed by Scotland, Wales, and Gascony. He too drew soldiers from\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Norman element, however, was united, while inveterate disunion\r\nreigned among the native tribes. It was occupying the posts of vantage\r\nwith the castles characteristic of its military rule. It seems to have\r\nbeen rather gaining ground when the island was invaded by Edward Bruce,\r\nthe brother of Robert, who, emulous of his brother's success in Scotland,\r\ncame over on the invitation of Irish tribes to carve out a kingdom for\r\nhimself. Bruce gained successes and committed great ravages, but was at\r\nlength met at Dundalk by the Anglo-Norman army under John de Bermingham,\r\noverthrown, and slain. He had estranged his Irish allies. According to one\r\nof their chroniclers, the day on which he was slain was the happiest of\r\ndays for the Irish people. The Irish appeal to the Pope against English\r\nmisrule on this occasion is in form a national manifesto, but was probably\r\nless than national in its source.\r\n\r\nStill Bruce's invasion seems to have dealt the Norman colony a heavy blow\r\nand thrown back into the hands of the native tribes districts which it had\r\nconquered and over which its settlements had spread. Degeneration set in\r\namongst its people. They took to the strange native custom of fosterage,\r\nto the Irishman's saffron mantle and his long moustache, to his weapons,\r\nto his mode of riding, even to his language, and countenanced license by\r\nconfusing the Brehon with the feudal law.\r\n\r\nA strange compound of feudalism with tribalism ensued, in the shape of\r\nmongrel chieftaincies, henceforth the predominant powers. English barons\r\ndoffed their baronial character, donned that of the tribal chief, and made\r\nthemselves independent lords of wide domains peopled by native Irish. It\r\nseems that they retained the Norman instinct of command. Many of them\r\nchanged their Anglo-Norman for Irish names; Bourke, O'Neill, O'Brien,\r\nO'Connor. They kept in their pay troops of bravos, gallowglasses and\r\nkernes. Their rule seems to have combined the extortions of the feudal\r\nlord with those of the native chiefs. Bonaught was a tax imposed by a\r\nchief for the support of his mercenaries. Sorohen was an obligation on\r\nlands to support the chief with his train one day in a quarter or one in a\r\nfortnight. Coshery was a chief's right to sponge upon his vassals with as\r\nmany followers as he pleased. Cuddies, or night suppers, were due by lands\r\nupon which the chief might quarter himself and his train for four days\r\nfour times a year. Shragh and mart were yearly exactions in money and\r\nkine, apparently imposed at will. But worst of all was coyne and livery,\r\nhorse-meat and man-meat taken at will. This, it seems, was not an Irish\r\nbut an Anglo-Norman invention introduced at first as the means of coping\r\nwith Edward Bruce, but, like the income tax, perpetuated when the special\r\nneed was past. The chiefs deemed themselves independent princes,\r\nrenouncing openly or practically allegiance to the English Crown. It is\r\nwith these potentates and the forces which their restless and rebellious\r\nambition could command that the Crown henceforth in its struggle with the\r\nIrish difficulty has to deal. Had they been united, they might have\r\nprevailed; but they were always at feud with each other, while policy,\r\nthough not loyalty, led some of them to side with the Crown. Of the septs,\r\nthe three most powerful were the Geraldines of the north, close to Dublin,\r\nthe head of which became afterward Earl of Kildare; the Geraldines of the\r\nsouth in Munster, the head of which became Earl of Desmond; and the\r\nButlers, also in the south, whose head became the Earl of Ormonde. The\r\nO'Neills in Ulster were another powerful sept. The Butlers, less\r\nHibernized than their rivals, were almost always on the side of the Crown.\r\n\r\nTo put a stop to degeneration and restore order in the Pale by the\r\ntalismanic influence of royalty, Edward III. sent over his son Lionel,\r\nDuke of Clarence. Under the duke's influence the Irish Parliament passed\r\nthe statute of Kilkenny, drawing a sharp line of division between the two\r\nraces; declaring marriage, fosterage, gossipred, and even concubinage with\r\nthe Irish high treason; pronouncing the same penalties against supplying\r\nhorses and armour to Irishmen or furnishing them with provisions in time\r\nof war; commanding Englishmen to speak English, to bear English names\r\nonly, and to ride and dress in the English fashion; providing for the\r\narming of the colony against Irish enemies; separating in every way the\r\nnative Irishman from the Englishman and even forbidding the admission of\r\nIrish priests to livings in the English Church or to the English\r\nmonasteries. There are severe regulations against the entertainment of\r\nIrish story-tellers and bards. An article declaring the English born in\r\nIreland and in England to be equal and forbidding them to call each other\r\nEnglish Hobbe or Irish Dog on pain of a year's imprisonment and a fine at\r\nthe king's pleasure shows that there was a social division in the colony\r\non that line. The statute betrays despair of a fusion of races or of a\r\nsubjection of the whole island to English rule and law. At the same time\r\nit seems to restrain English aggression and decree peace between the\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nPiqued, we are told, by a taunt of his impotence as lord of Ireland which\r\nstung his pride, Richard II. twice came over to Ireland with a large army.\r\nHis armies were wrecked by the difficulties of the country and the\r\npassionate weakness of their commander. From his second visit Richard was\r\nrecalled by the knell of his own doom.\r\n\r\nThe Pale was drawn into the troubles of the Roses. Before the outbreak the\r\nDuke of York had come over to Ireland as vicegerent, won the heart of the\r\npeople, asserted the independence of the Irish Parliament, and seemed\r\ndisposed to make himself king. He had been recalled by the Civil War, but\r\nhe had left behind him a Yorkist party which adhered to the White Rose\r\nafter Bosworth, recognized the two pretenders, Lambert Simnel and Perkin\r\nWarbeck, and fought for the lost cause by the side of Martin Schwartz and\r\nhis German hackbut-men at Stoke.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Norman colony or \"Pale\" was now at its nadir. Much of its\r\nmanhood had been drawn away by the kings to their Scottish and French\r\nwars. It was reduced to a circle of two counties and a half round Dublin,\r\ndefended by a ditch. Had the chiefs of tribes been unanimous, it would\r\nalmost certainly have been destroyed. But the chiefs of tribes were very\r\nfar from being unanimous, and thanks to their dissensions Strongbow in his\r\ntomb at Christ Church still slept undisturbed on the field of his victory.\r\nIn the Pale itself reigned corruption, disorder, and misrule. \"There is no\r\nland in all this world that has more liberty in vices than Ireland and\r\nless liberty in virtue.\" Such, as reported to Henry VIII., was the\r\ninternal condition of the colony; and the description extended in its full\r\nforce to the Church.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the Pale to the Red Rose probably combined with\r\ndistractions at home in leading Henry VII. to try the policy of winning\r\nthe great Irish chiefs to allegiance by marks of confidence and honour and\r\nof governing Ireland through them. He tried it with the Earl of Kildare,\r\nthe head of the great Geraldine clan, saying, as the story went, when he\r\nwas told that all Ireland could not govern that man, \"then that man shall\r\ngovern all Ireland.\" Kildare, deported to England as a suspected traitor,\r\nbut there winning favour and confidence by the artful address in which his\r\nkind were seldom wanting, was sent back to Ireland as lord deputy. The\r\npolicy had a show of success. Kildare as deputy harried the lands of his\r\nown enemies and reported execution done on the enemies of the Crown. He\r\ngained one signal victory of that kind. But the attempt to employ restless\r\nand lawless ambition as the regular mainstay of orderly government could\r\nnot be a permanent success. The sept of Butler alone was true to the\r\nCrown. The next reign saw Kildare's son and successor as deputy in the\r\nTower, and his grandson, Silken Thomas, raising a madcap rebellion which\r\nwas made impious by the murder of an archbishop. The execution of Silken\r\nThomas and his five uncles closed the experiment of governing Ireland\r\nthrough that house. There was left one boy whom faithful guardians carried\r\nabroad and to whom the heart of the sept still turned.\r\n\r\nTo make an end of the aspirations to independent nationality which had\r\nbudded under the Duke of York, and bring Irish legislation completely\r\nunder the control of the Crown, the Lord Deputy Poynings caused to be\r\ncarried through the Parliament of the Pale the pair of acts which bore his\r\nname, subjecting Irish legislation to the control of the English Council.\r\nThe first act ordained that in future no Parliament should be held in\r\nIreland \"but at such season as the King's Lieutenant-in-Council there\r\nfirst do certify the King under the great seal of that land the causes and\r\nconsiderations, and all such acts as then seemeth should pass in the said\r\nParliament.\" Should the king in council approve, the Irish Parliament was\r\nto be summoned under the great seal of England and not otherwise. The\r\nsecond act provided that all public statutes \"late made within the realm\r\nof England\" should be in force in Ireland. This it was decided applied to\r\nall English acts prior to the tenth year of Henry VII. Ireland was thus\r\npractically turned from a separate principality into a political\r\ndependency of England. The work of Poynings was long afterwards completed\r\nby the act of George I. affirming the right of the British Parliament to\r\nlegislate for Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the reign of Henry VIII. the policy of the\r\nEnglish government was a continuation of that of Henry VII. It was a\r\npolicy of conciliation and of ruling through the great Irish chiefs, the\r\nheads of the Butlers, the Geraldines, and the O'Neills, who were gratified\r\nby the bestowal of English titles of nobility, with flattering marks of\r\nconfidence, and by a change in the tenure of their land from tribal to\r\nfeudal, which invested them with full ownership. The Irish chief and the\r\nfeudal baron of the Pale now sat in Parliament together for the first and\r\nlast time. There appears to have been an inclination on the part of the\r\nCrown to favour the native Irish, it being still remembered perhaps that\r\nthe Anglo-Irish had supported the Yorkist pretenders. The king himself\r\npenned a sage and benevolent manifesto, in the shape of a despatch to the\r\nLord Deputy Surrey, on the blessings of civilization. The policy of\r\nconciliation was in fact necessary as well as laudable; for the king,\r\nplunged by his diplomacy into continental embroilments and lavishing his\r\nfather's hoard on a Field of the Cloth of Gold, had not the means of\r\nsubduing Ireland. It would have been vain to look in those days for the\r\nphilosophy which could make allowance for a diversity of national ideas\r\nand habits. The O'Neill, upon his elevation to the earldom of Tyrone, is\r\nrequired with his heirs to forsake the name of O'Neill, to use English\r\nhabits and the English language. The age, however, was one of growing\r\nlight. Education was a passion of the hour. A decree in favour of the\r\nestablishment of a system of free schools in Ireland went forth. Unhappily\r\nit remained a decree. No homilies, no peerages, no flatteries or marks of\r\nconfidence could permanently avail to quiet the intractable ambition of\r\nthe great chiefs. They took the titles, which tickled their vanity; but\r\nthey preferred the state of a chieftain with his gallowglasses and with\r\nhis despotic power over the sept to that of a baron under royal rule, with\r\nfeudal restraints and obligations. They were always at feud with each\r\nother, waging private war and ravaging each others' territories with the\r\nruthlessness of the most cruel invader. Murders among them were frequent.\r\nConspiracies were always on foot. Thus the catastrophe of the house of\r\nKildare ended what may be called the early Tudor policy of native\r\ngovernment and conciliation. The policy of conquest with colonization in\r\nits train prevailed once more.\r\n\r\nThe instrument of that policy was to be a line of English deputies; able\r\nmen on the whole and zealous in the public service, but generally\r\nincapable of understanding any national character or any institutions but\r\ntheir own. A deputy had also to contend with desperate difficulties, utter\r\ninsufficiency of military force, an empty exchequer, a service full of\r\njobbery and corruption, hostile intrigue both at Dublin and in the court\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThe line was opened by Skeffington, a good though somewhat decrepit\r\nsoldier, before whose artillery fell the redoubtable native fortress of\r\nMaynooth. The Crown had now a new and formidable force upon its side in\r\nthe cannon, which it alone could afford to maintain. In Ireland as\r\nelsewhere the end of the feudal fortress had come.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there were forfeited to the Crown great tracts of land\r\nheld by absentees, the feudal principle still prevailing and military\r\nservice being still a condition of the ownership of land. The Crown\r\nthereby became a landowner on a vast scale, with the means of planting\r\nsettlements in all the districts under its power. Thus a wide field was\r\nopened for Crown colonization.\r\n\r\nBut now comes an event most momentous in itself and fraught with future\r\nwoe to Ireland. Henry VIII., enraged at the refusal of the Pope to let him\r\nput away his wife and marry another woman, breaks with the Papacy, carries\r\nhis kingdom out of its dominion, declares himself supreme head of a\r\nnational Church, dissolves the monasteries, seizes their estates, and half\r\nreforms the church in a Protestant sense, breaking the worshipped images,\r\nclosing the shrines, expurgating the liturgy, and licensing the\r\ntranslation of the Bible. He seizes into his own hands under the mask of a\r\n_conge d'elire_ the appointments to the bishoprics. Wavering to the last\r\nin opinion between Catholicism and Protestantism according as the party of\r\nthe old or that of the new aristocracy prevailed in his councils, he in\r\nthe upshot practically ranges his kingdom on the Protestant side in the\r\ngrand struggle that was to come between the Catholic and the Protestant\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland there was one religion but there were two Churches: that of the\r\nPale and that of the native Irish; divided from each other, not by\r\ndoctrine or ritual, but by race and language, practically treating each\r\nother as not within the pale of Christendom, hardly within the pale of\r\nhumanity. No Irishman could be admitted to church preferment or to a\r\nmonastery in the Pale. Nor did the churches ever act together as one\r\nChurch. Both were in a most miserable condition. The edifices were in\r\nruins, the services were unperformed. Monasteries however abounded. They\r\nwere the refuge of the peaceful in that world of strife and blood. That\r\nsome of them were on a large scale stately ruins prove. It is surmised\r\nthat they may have been wealthy, if not in lands, in orchards, fish-ponds,\r\nmills, or the labour which seems to have been sheltered within their ample\r\nwalls. Like the English monasteries, they impropriated the tithes of\r\nparishes, thus helping to kill the parochial system. The character of the\r\nclergy was still scandalously low, not seldom criminal. Among the people\r\nreligion was almost dead; the remnant of it, as well as the remnant of\r\neducation, was kept alive by the poor Franciscan friars. In neither Church\r\nwas there the making of martyrs.\r\n\r\nIn the little maritime towns there was more religion, as well as something\r\nmore like civilization. But in this as in other respects their influence\r\nwas confined to their own gates.\r\n\r\nThere was no opposition in the Irish Parliament to the change of the\r\nking's title from _Dominus_ to _Rex_, whereby the sovereignty of the Pope\r\nwas cancelled, to any article in the king's assumption of autocratic power\r\nover the Church, or to his taking to himself the appointment of bishops. A\r\nshow of resistance made by the proctors of the clergy in the House of\r\nCommons was promptly met by their extrusion. Nor was there the slightest\r\nunwillingness on the part of any lord or chief to take his share of the\r\nplunder of the monasteries, which, as in England, were suppressed, with\r\nconfiscation of revenue and goods, including the impropriated tithes of\r\nparishes which they had served. A plea put in by the deputy on behalf of\r\nsix friaries in consideration of their special services to education and\r\ntheir hospitality was not heard.\r\n\r\nThe iconoclastic part of the revolution, attacking the material objects of\r\npopular worship, relics, wonder-working images, and venerated shrines,\r\nseems to have encountered some natural resistance, and it appears that the\r\ngovernment failed to put an end to pilgrimages, which were the religious\r\npleasure-trips of the people.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Reform movement, and specially of iconoclasm, in\r\nIreland, under Henry VIII., was Archbishop Browne, a fervid but\r\napparently not discreet man. He had a rather restive coadjutor in Bishop\r\nStaples. No counterpart of Cranmer, Latimer, or Ridley appeared.\r\n\r\nThe members of the council of Edward VI., being men of the new official\r\naristocracy, opposed to the old houses, attached themselves to the party\r\nof movement in religion. In England they completed the work of\r\nconfiscation, carried iconoclasm a step farther, and made Protestant\r\nreforms in the religious system, the last in conjunction with foreign\r\nreformers. Their policy in Ireland was the same. They sent over the\r\nprayer-book of Edward. But the effect appears to have been small. The way\r\nhad not been prepared by the advent of Lutheranism or by the use of\r\ntranslations of the Bible. Besides, there was no religious feeling on\r\nwhich it could act. The Deputy St. Leger was a shrewd man of the world,\r\nwho, while he was ready to put the law in force, disliked all religious\r\nagitation. \"Tut, tut,\" he said to the earnest reformer, \"your religious\r\nmatters will spoil all.\" The way of the new liturgy was effectually\r\nblocked by the Erse language, and no missionary effort appears to have\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nThe military policy of Edward's government had a very able though rather\r\ngrim representative in Bellingham, if he had only been backed by a\r\nsufficient force. But the foreign complications of England being what they\r\nwere, no sufficient force could ever be sent. The system of regular\r\nhostings against the natives is now on foot. Bellingham having stormed a\r\nposition, there ensues a butchery of wood kerne, the equal of which\r\nBellingham supposed there had never been. \"Such,\" the deputy says, \"was\r\nthe great goodness of God to deliver them into our hands.\" Puritanism with\r\nits ruthlessness is making its appearance in the lists, on one side, while\r\non the other side enters its mortal foe the Jesuit.\r\n\r\nThe government incurred deserved hatred in Ireland as in England by\r\ncarrying to further lengths the debasement of the coin which had been the\r\ndisgraceful shift of the spendthrift Henry VIII. A petition sent to the\r\nking upon the subject, in setting forth the folly of debasement, stated\r\nwith an accuracy remarkable for the time the function of the precious\r\nmetals as a medium of exchange. Wholesale fraud on the part of government\r\nwas not likely to help the cause of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nBeyond the English Pale the change of religion never reached the people.\r\nAntagonism of religion was henceforth added to estrangement of race.\r\nProtestantism was to be the religion of the conqueror; Catholicism was to\r\nbe the religion of the conquered. The Pope became a rival in sovereignty\r\nto the king of England, claiming the allegiance at once of piety and\r\npatriotism. Instead of the torpid clergy of the old native Church, now\r\ncame upon the scene active emissaries of Rome with the Jesuit, master of\r\nintrigue, at their head, to do the joint work of propagandism and\r\nrebellion. Presently will appear the crusading soldiery of Catholic Spain.\r\n\r\nWith Mary comes an interlude of reaction. The sovereignty was not restored\r\nto the Pope. Grantees of abbey lands in Ireland, as in England, Catholics\r\nthough they might be, held fast their prey. But the old ritual was for a\r\ntime legally revived, and the hand of iconoclasm was stayed. Protestantism\r\nwas rabbled; but Smithfield fires, the martyr's spirit being absent, there\r\nwere none.\r\n\r\nA story is told of an envoy sent by Mary to Ireland with a warrant of\r\npersecution, whose commission a clever Protestant woman, in whose house he\r\nput up by the way, stole and replaced by a pack of cards, so that when the\r\ndeputy opened the wallet at the council board nothing came forth but the\r\npack of cards with the knave of clubs uppermost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the day of the Elizabethan era which dawned so brightly upon England\r\ncame on in heavy clouds for the unhappy dependency. The religious\r\ncompromise which it brought to England was adapted by the English\r\nstatesmen who framed it to the religious condition and temperament of\r\ntheir own people. To the condition and temperament of the Irish people\r\nthere was no such adaptation. To the Catholic lords of the Pale the\r\nElizabethan religion was alien; to the native Celts it was not only alien,\r\nbut utterly abhorrent. It presented itself, not as the religion of\r\nIreland, but as the religion of the conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical polity comprised in the Act of Uniformity and the\r\nThirty-nine Articles was, however, formally extended to Ireland, and the\r\nCrown resumed the powers which it had assumed in the time of Henry VIII.\r\nor his son, including the appointment of bishops, in this case without the\r\nveil, retained in England, of the _conge d'elire_. In the dependency as\r\nin England, the State assumed supreme power of religious legislation,\r\noverriding and almost treating as null the authority of the ecclesiastical\r\nConvocation. Propagation of the Anglican liturgy beyond the Pale continued\r\nto be blocked by the language.\r\n\r\nBurleigh and the other statesmen of Elizabeth's Council could not fail to\r\nturn their minds to the Irish problem, enhanced as its gravity had been by\r\nthe progress of religious revolution in Europe and the danger of a\r\nconflict with the Catholic powers. Trinity College is a noble monument of\r\ntheir policy. In Ireland, as in England, they restored the coin, though\r\nthe benefits of that wise measure were offset by protectionist enactments\r\ncarried in the Parliament of the Pale, which bore the usual fruits. They\r\nsent commissioners of inquiry to give them more trustworthy information\r\nthan they could get from the despatches of the deputies or the tattling\r\nintriguers of the Pale. They formed a plan for the institution of\r\nprovincial presidencies to lengthen the arm of government and form local\r\ncentres of civilization, which, had it taken effect, might have been the\r\nbest solution of the problem. But the necessary means of giving effect to\r\nany policy failed them. Churches and schools, which were named by a\r\nreformer at the time as the indispensable instruments of civilization,\r\ncould in the case of Ireland be named only in mockery. An ordinance for\r\nthe general establishment of schools more than once went forth, but an\r\nordinance still it remained. The Pale, reduced as it was in extent and\r\nweakly defended, was in itself a nest of misrule, jobbery, and corruption.\r\nNothing could have been done without a military force in the hands of the\r\ncentral government sufficient to enforce law and order. Such a force the\r\ncounsellors of Elizabeth had no means of maintaining. Continental war drew\r\nheavily on the exchequer. The queen was unwisely parsimonious. She was\r\nseized with spasms of frugality. Militia on the spot of any value there\r\nwas none. The service was very unpopular in England, and the men enlisted\r\nor pressed for it as soldiers were apt to be of the Falstaffian kind,\r\nbetter at preying on the people for whose protection they were sent and at\r\nindulging in the general license of the camp than at facing the perils and\r\nhardships of \"hostings\" in the Irish wilds. Their pay was almost always in\r\narrears.\r\n\r\nThe service was not inviting. \"The deputy, according to his commission,\r\nmarched into the north. But, alas, he neither found France to travel in\r\nnor Frenchmen to fight withal. There were no glorious towns to load the\r\nsoldiers home with spoils, nor pleasant vineyards to refresh them with\r\nwine. Here were no plentiful markets to supply the salary of the army if\r\nthey wanted, or stood in need; here were no cities of refuge, nor places\r\nof garrison to retire into, in the times of danger and extremity of\r\nweather; here were no musters ordered, no lieutenants of shires to raise\r\nnew armies; here was no supplement of men or provisions, especially of\r\nIrish against Irish; nor any one promise kept according to his\r\nexpectation; here were, in plain terms, bogs and woods to be in, fogs and\r\nmists to trouble you, grass and fern to welcome your horses and corrupt\r\nand putrefy your bodies; here was killing of kine and eating fresh beef,\r\nto breed diseases; here was oats without bread, and fire without food;\r\nhere were smoky cabins and nasty holes; here were bogs on the tops of\r\nmountains, and few passages, but over marshes, or through strange places;\r\nhere was retiring into fastnesses, glens, and no fighting, but when they\r\npleased themselves; here was ground enough to bury your people in being\r\ndead, but no place to please them while alive; here you might spend what\r\nyou brought with you, but be assured there was no hopes of relief; here\r\nwas room for all your losses, but scarce a castle to receive your spoil\r\nand treasure. To conclude: here was all glory and virtue buried in\r\nobscurity and oblivion, and not so much as a glimmering hope that how\r\nvaliantly soever a man demeaned himself it should be registered or\r\nremembered.\"\r\n\r\nThe deputies sent in command might do their best according to their\r\nlights. They generally did. But the lights of all of them were not the\r\nsame, and the web of Penelope woven by one was always in danger of being\r\nunwoven by his successor. One of them only, Sussex, was large-minded\r\nenough to think of acknowledging the Brehon law, reducing it to a system,\r\nand making it a bridge across which the Irish might pass to legal\r\ncivilization. All the deputies had to contend more or less with local\r\nopposition and intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe consequences to Ireland of this policy of government by deputies were\r\ndisastrous. The presence of royalty might have had some effect on the\r\nIrish heart. It could hardly have failed, at all events, to reveal the\r\nreal state of things. But it was never tried.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, Protestant by circumstance and profession, Catholic in her real\r\nleanings, hating nothing so much as a Puritan, unless it were a\r\nclergyman's wife, and an autocrat to the core, had no desire of breaking\r\nwith the Papacy or with Spain. But when a Pope excommunicated and deposed\r\nher, the die was cast. Ireland was drawn into the European war between\r\nCatholicism and Protestantism which was also that between despotism and\r\nfreedom; she became a point of military danger in a national and religious\r\nstruggle for life or death. There is now an end of the policy of\r\nconciliation or of colonization with a civilizing object. The policy\r\nhenceforth is that of conquest, and when resistance is obstinate, of\r\nextermination.\r\n\r\nThe reign was filled with successive wars between the English and the\r\nnatives, the first slightly, the last two more deeply, identified on the\r\nside of the natives with papal suzerainty and the Catholic cause. The\r\nfirst was that with Shane O'Neill, elective head of the great Ulster sept\r\nof O'Neill and pretender to the royal earldom of Tyrone. The tribal\r\nheadship was unquestionably elective; to the earldom Shane's claim was\r\ndoubtful, the question being partly one between the English and the Brehon\r\nlaw. It was presently settled by the murder of Shane's rival. Shane was,\r\nin fact admitted himself to be, a barbarian, brutal, drunken, and cruel,\r\nall in a high degree. He made his prisoners wear an iron collar fastened\r\nby a short chain to gyves on their ankles so that they could neither stand\r\nnor lie. At the same time he was able, crafty, and daring. He made himself\r\nsupreme in Ulster, baffled the English in war, and was so formidable that\r\nthe Lord Deputy Sussex, once at least, if not more than once, attempted to\r\nget rid of him by assassination. He intrigued with Philip of Spain. At\r\nanother time he coquetted with the Queen's government and paid a visit to\r\nthe court, where he and his gallowglasses, with their axes, their Irish\r\nheads of hair and moustaches, their wide-sleeved saffron shirts, short\r\ntunics, and shaggy cloaks of fur or frieze, produced a sensation among the\r\ncourtiers. Master of dissimulation, Shane fell on his knees before the\r\nQueen and confessed his rebellion in the Irish language \"with howling.\"\r\nReturning to Ulster, he recommenced the game there, plundering and\r\nburning, slaying man, woman, and child. He was at last stabbed in a brawl\r\nwith the Scottish raiders with whom he had intrigued. These marauding\r\nimmigrants from the Scottish Highlands and isles were now a formidable\r\naddition to the elements in the cauldron of Irish anarchy and ruin.\r\n\r\nShane was an Irish leader of the thoroughly Celtic type. Perhaps the\r\nnext, though in a widely different guise and sphere, may be said to have\r\nbeen Daniel O'Connell.\r\n\r\nAs a mover of disturbance on a large scale there succeeded James\r\nFitzmaurice, kinsman of the Earl of Desmond, the head of the southern sept\r\nof Geraldines. Fitzmaurice, whether from conviction or policy, gave\r\nrebellion a more religious character and connected it with Rome and\r\nMadrid, which he visited on missions of intrigue. In this work he had a\r\ncompeer in Stukely, an adventurer of the kind then common, who also\r\nintrigued with the Catholic powers. If their aim was an Irish crown on a\r\nCatholic head, it came to nothing. But Fitzmaurice brought with him to\r\nIreland a regular proclamation from the Pope, and had made formidable\r\nheadway in his appeal to the forces of disorder when he was killed. The\r\nleadership of the movement passed to the Earl of Desmond, who with a\r\nlittle aid from Spain raised in Munster a rebellion on a large scale. He\r\nwas a feeble though respectable leader, and his rising in the end bore no\r\nfruits but a renewal of slaughter and devastation.\r\n\r\nThe aid of Rome and Spain promised to the Irish Catholics was long in\r\ncoming. Ever tardy and vacillating was the mind of the Spanish king. But\r\nat the time of Desmond's rebellion the aid came. In concert with the\r\ninsurgent Irish a force of Italians and Spaniards landed and established\r\nitself in a fortalice at Smerwick. The deputy at that time was Lord Grey,\r\na Puritan most pronounced and militant, the Artegal, the Knight of\r\nJustice, in Spenser's \"Faerie Queene,\" bent on the overthrow of the false\r\nDuessa and the extermination of her brood. He invested Smerwick. The Irish\r\nallies of the invader failed to relieve the place, and the garrison was\r\ncompelled to surrender at discretion. Grey then butchered the whole of\r\nthem in cold blood. Raleigh, as the officer in command, it is to be feared\r\ndirected the slaughter. Alva or Parma would have done the same, and\r\nElizabeth in approving incurred no special infamy.\r\n\r\nThe poor Irish in this rebellion showed that fidelity to a chief which was\r\none of their small stock of political virtues. They afterwards showed\r\ntheir love of legend, of melancholy legend especially, by telling that\r\nDesmond's ghost, mounted on a phantom steed with silver shoes, rose at\r\nnight from the water on the bank of which he had been slain, and fancying\r\nthat in the moaning of the wind they heard the Desmond howl.\r\n\r\nThe attainder of the Earl of Desmond was followed by the sweeping\r\nconfiscation of a vast tract of land to the Crown, on the assumption that\r\nas the domain of an earl it had been a fief and the property of its lord;\r\nwhereas under native law and according to native ideas it was the property\r\nof the tribe. Spenser was one of the grantees of the Crown and settlers on\r\nthe conquered land. He had been the secretary of Lord Grey. The author of\r\nthe \"Faerie Queene\" thus encountered the religion of the false Duessa, his\r\nhatred of which was not likely to be diminished when he was afterwards by\r\na great outbreak of insurrection ejected from his grant.\r\n\r\nNow along the dangerous western coast of Ireland were driven in dire\r\ndistress a number of great ships of war, with the troops and much of the\r\npower and chivalry of a mighty kingdom on board. These were the miserable\r\nremnants of the Invincible Armada. About a score of the ships were cast\r\nashore or wrecked. The crews for the most part perished. On one strand of\r\nless than five miles in length were counted above eleven hundred corpses\r\ncast up by the sea. On two miles of strand in Sligo there lay wrecked\r\ntimber enough to build five first-rate ships, besides mighty great boats,\r\ncables and other cordage, and masts of extraordinary size. Of those who\r\nstruggled to land, many were killed by the English, not a few by the\r\nnative Irish, who stripped and robbed those whom they did not kill,\r\nskipping and capering at the sight of such glorious plunder. The Armada\r\nhad come to liberate the native Irish from the heretical yoke; but love of\r\nplunder overcame in their simple souls regard for a political and\r\necclesiastical alliance, their appreciation of which, perhaps, had never\r\nbeen very clear.\r\n\r\nOne Spaniard, Cuellar, after being stripped and narrowly escaping with his\r\nlife, spent some time in an Irish cabin, and has left his notes on native\r\nIrish life and character, valuable as those of a neutral.\r\n\r\n\"The habit of those savages,\" he says, \"is to live like brutes in the\r\nmountains, which are very rugged in the part of Ireland where we were\r\nlost. They dwell in thatched cabins. The men are well made, with good\r\nfeatures, and as active as deer. They eat but one meal, and that late at\r\nnight, oatcake and butter being their usual food. They drink sour milk\r\nbecause they have nothing else, for they use no water, though they have\r\nthe best in the world. At feasts it is their custom to eat half-cooked\r\nmeat without bread or salt. Their dress matches themselves--tight\r\nbreeches, and short hose jackets of very coarse texture; over all they\r\nwear blankets, and their hair comes over their eyes. They are great\r\nwalkers and stand much work, and by continually fighting they keep the\r\nqueen's English soldiers out of their country, which is nothing but bogs\r\nfor forty miles either way. Their great delight is robbing one another, so\r\nthat no day passes without fighting, for whenever the people of one hamlet\r\nknow that those of another possess cattle or other goods, they immediately\r\nmake a night attack and kill each other. When the English garrisons find\r\nout who has lifted the most cattle, they come down on them, and they have\r\nbut to retire to the mountains with their wives and herds, having no\r\nhouses or furniture to lose. They sleep on the ground upon rushes full of\r\nwater and ice. Most of the women are very pretty, but badly got up, for\r\nthey wear only a shift and a mantle, and a great linen cloth on the head,\r\nrolled over the brow. They are great workers and housewives in their way.\r\nThese people call themselves Christians, and say Mass. They follow the\r\nrule of the Roman Church, but most of their churches, monasteries, and\r\nhermitages are dismantled by the English soldiers, and by their local\r\npartisans, who are as bad as themselves. In short there is no order nor\r\njustice in the country, and every one does that which is right in his own\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Savages\" Cuellar calls the natives; what but savages could they be when\r\nnot only had all the means of civilization been withheld from them, but\r\nthey were hunted like beasts of prey? That the women are \"great workers\r\nand housewives in their way\" is a redeeming feature in the picture. The\r\nwhole land, English and Irish alike, was a wreck. The secretary of a lord\r\ndeputy reports that the people had no conscience, but committed crimes\r\nfreely; that they even changed wives among themselves; that bridges were\r\nfalling down, churches roofless; there were no charities, no schools; law\r\nwas jobbery, and the judicial bench was filled with ignorance; every lord\r\nhated the restraints of law and made himself an Irish chief; and disorders\r\nwere as great among English soldiers as among Irish kernes.\r\n\r\nThe third rebellion, and the most formidable of all, was that of the Earl\r\nof Tyrone, head of the O'Neills of Ulster. It stirred the general forces\r\nof revolt, national and religious, beyond Ulster, in Connaught and\r\nelsewhere. Tyrone gave his movement distinctly the character of a holy\r\nwar, and received aid from Spain. Unlike Desmond, he was an able leader.\r\nHe gained a victory over the English at the Yellow Ford which filled\r\nDublin with panic. To put him down, Elizabeth sent her favourite Essex,\r\nwith forces greater than her parsimony allowed to an ordinary deputy.\r\nEssex went forth with great pomp and amidst high expectations. But he\r\ntotally lacked steadiness of character and policy. He failed and went home\r\nto run mad courses and die on the scaffold, faintly recalling the Irish\r\nhistory of Richard II.\r\n\r\nEssex was succeeded by Mountjoy, able, iron-willed, and ruthless, who made\r\nit a war of extermination and devastation. The Spaniards brought tardy aid\r\nto their Irish allies. They landed in force at Kinsale, and for a moment\r\nthe fortune of war seemed to waver, but it soon inclined again to the side\r\nof the deputy and England. The force of the rebellion was broken, and\r\nTyrone was compelled to surrender.\r\n\r\nOf all the wars waged by a half-civilized on a barbarous and despised\r\nrace, these wars waged by the English on the Irish seem to have been about\r\nthe most hideous. No quarter was given by the invader to man, woman, or\r\nchild. The butchering of women and children is repeatedly and brutally\r\navowed. Nothing can be more horrible than the cool satisfaction with which\r\ncommanders report their massacres. \"I was never,\" said Captain Woodhouse,\r\n\"so weary with killing of men, for I protest to God for as fast as I\r\ncould I did but hough and paunch them.\" \"The number of their fighting men\r\nslain and drowned that day,\" says another commander, \"were estimated and\r\nnumbered to be fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred, besides boys, women,\r\nchurls, and children, which could not be so few as many more and upwards.\"\r\nOver and over again massacres of people of both sexes and all ages are\r\nreported with similar coolness. Another ruffian seems to have put to death\r\nchildren who were held as hostages.\r\n\r\nMountjoy especially used famine deliberately as his instrument of war, and\r\nwith signal effect. After his work, multitudes lay dead in the ditches of\r\ntowns and other waste places, with their mouths coloured green by eating\r\ndocks and nettles. Children were seen eating their mother's corpse. Old\r\nwomen, we are told, lit fires in the woods and ate the children who came\r\nto warm themselves. Not only were horses killed and eaten, but cats and\r\ndogs, hawks and kites. The wolves, driven by hunger from the woods, killed\r\nthe enfeebled people. The dead lay unburied or half-buried, the survivors\r\nnot having strength to dig graves, and dogs ate the remains.\r\n\r\nIt must be said that the native Irish not only retaliated these cruelties\r\non the English whenever they could, but committed them on each other.\r\nEdward Butler, for example, invades Arra, the district of another clan,\r\nharries the country far and wide, breaks open the churches to which the\r\nfrightened women had fled in the vain hope of sanctuary, and gives the\r\nregion up for forty-eight hours to plunder and rape, sparing neither age\r\nnor condition. The lately gathered corn is destroyed, and famine stares\r\nthe whole population in the face. The raid is presently repeated, the\r\ncattle are driven off, and a house full of women and children is given to\r\nthe flames. In the English settlement of Munster, overrun by the native\r\nIrish, English children are taken from their nurses' breasts and dashed\r\nagainst walls; an Englishman's heart is plucked out in his wife's\r\npresence, and she is forced to lend an apron to wipe the murderer's\r\nfingers. Of the English fugitives who flocked into Youghal some had lost\r\ntheir tongues and noses. Irish tenants and servants that yesterday fed in\r\nthe settlers' houses were conspicuous by their cruelty.\r\n\r\nWhat was called law was almost as murderous as war. Men were hanged at\r\nassizes by scores, and these massacres were reported by the deputy with\r\nsatisfaction as gratifying proof of the increased influence of public\r\njustice. A bishop witnesses them with complacency. Respect for human life\r\nmust have perished. Such was the training which in the formative period of\r\nnational character the Celtic Irish received, and which must be borne in\r\nmind when we come to atrocities committed by them at a not very much later\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we do not see the back of destiny's cards. The\r\nsubjugation of barbarous clans by a foreign conqueror, himself\r\nhalf-civilized, was horrible. Would a series of tribal wars among the\r\nclans themselves have been less horrible? When Strongbow landed there had\r\nbeen hardly any sign of permanent union or of the foundation of a settled\r\npolity. Nor afterwards does there appear to have been any attempt or\r\ntendency of the kind.\r\n\r\nTyrone, on his submission, had been restored to rank and great part of his\r\nestate. But he, as well as his confederate, the O'Donnell, created Earl of\r\nTyrconnell, afterwards finding themselves objects of aversion and\r\nsuspicion, fled the country. Their flight and the suppression of a futile\r\noutbreak of tribal insurrection under another O'Donnell finished the work.\r\nThe whole island was now conquered, but the heart of the people, as\r\npresently appeared, was very far from being won. The hold of the Papacy\r\nand the Catholic Church upon their liegemen had been growing stronger\r\nunder the long struggle and was not impaired by its close. It formed\r\nhenceforth a religious substitute for nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland, conquered, now became shire land, at least in contemplation of\r\nlaw. The law of England, in the eyes of its professors the consummation of\r\nhuman wisdom, ousted the Brehon law. The feudal system of land tenure\r\nsupplanted the tribal system. Freehold and leasehold, primogeniture and\r\nentail, took the place of tribal ownership and tanistry. Justice was\r\nhenceforth to be administered in English courts, and judges were to go\r\ncircuit as in England. The change at first seemed to be well received.\r\nPerhaps novelty itself impressed. An English chief justice, going circuit\r\nthrough the newly Anglicized districts, could complacently report that\r\nmultitudes had flocked to his court; whence he drew the cheerful inference\r\nthat the Irish after all, like other men, loved justice. So they did, and\r\ndo; but it was not the justice of the king's bench and Coke. Nor did they\r\nlove its administration by an alien conqueror. It was probably curiosity\r\nas much as confidence that drew them to the court of Chief Justice Davies;\r\nso the event proved.\r\n\r\nThe whole machinery of government, as well as the law and the judiciary,\r\nwas at the same time assimilated, formally at least, to the English model.\r\nThe corporate towns received new charters. The place of the military\r\ndeputy was taken by the head of a civil government with his officials.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the ecclesiastical polity of England, with its tests and its\r\nrecusancy law, compelling attendance at the services of the State Church,\r\nwas at the same time thrust upon people to whom it was in itself and in\r\nits associations abhorrent. Under Elizabeth there had been a politic\r\nlaxity. Now fines for recusancy are exacted. Intolerance of Catholic\r\ndissent from the royal religion could not fail to be increased by the\r\nGunpowder Plot.\r\n\r\nJames I., with all his pedantry, his absurdities, and his stuffed\r\nbreeches, was not without something of the largeness of mind which culture\r\ngenerally imparts. He could understand Bacon. His Irish policy, evidently\r\ninspired by Bacon, was colonization, plantation as it then was called. For\r\nthis there was ample room on the forfeited lands of Tyrone and other\r\nattainted chiefs, so far as legal ownership in the contemplation of\r\nEnglish law was concerned. But the attainders of the chiefs had not\r\ncleared the lands of the members of their septs, in whose minds tribal\r\nownership was rooted. This was the weak point of the transplantation\r\npolicy, as in the sequel tragically appeared. Extensive grants, however,\r\nwere made to a colony formed by English and Scottish settlers, undertakers\r\nas they were called. Of Scottish settlers there had before been not a few.\r\nThe city of London invested largely in the enterprise. Thus was formed in\r\nUlster, and in Ulster has continued to exist to the present time, a sort\r\nof Protestant pale. Bacon's philosophic eye ranges complacently over the\r\nprospect of a people of barbarous manners \"brought to give over and\r\ndiscontinue their customs of revenge and blood and of dissolute life and\r\nof theft and rapine, and to give ear to the wisdom of laws and\r\ngovernments; whereupon immediately followeth the cutting of stones for\r\nbuilding and habitation, and of trees for the seats of houses, orchards,\r\nenclosures, and the like.\" Beyond doubt this settlement was an improvement\r\nin material respects. Nor, though the new settlers might domineer, was\r\ntheir domination likely to be more oppressive and insolent than that of\r\nthe native chief, with his gallowglasses and his coyne and livery. The\r\ntribal ownership of land had probably become almost a fiction, the chief\r\ntreating the land as his own. Little, therefore, was actually lost in\r\nthat way by the tribesman, while there was an end of coyne and livery and\r\nthe other extortions of the chiefs. On the other hand the chief, however\r\noppressive, was nominally one of the tribe and a kinsman, and the land was\r\nstill tribal in the fancy of the sept. The tribesman was not liable to\r\neviction. Nor was improvement in agriculture or even in advancement of law\r\nand order likely to be so fascinating to the native Irish, especially to\r\ngallowglasses and kernes, as to Bacon. The adventurers were apt to be of a\r\nsordid class, ravenous, close-fisted, little likely to make themselves\r\nbeloved. The eagles of enterprise spread their wings for the Spanish main;\r\nthe vultures swooped upon Ireland. The medley of Brehon law and English\r\nlaw, with the variety of titles, some by forfeiture for treason, others by\r\nancient grants from the Crown, formed an element in which the art of the\r\npredatory pettifogger had full play. By legal chicane, the chicane of an\r\nalien law, many an Irish Naboth may have been dispossessed. There was,\r\nmoreover, the antagonism of religion, greatly intensified by the long\r\nstruggle in which the natives, fighting for independence, had looked up to\r\nRome for support and been fired at heart by the active zeal of her\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nThe government meant well. It sent over an able lord deputy in the person\r\nof Chichester, who did his best for healing and improvement. In\r\nimprovement he was somewhat hasty and procrustean. He might have done\r\nbetter had he only imbibed Bacon's spirit of philosophic toleration, and\r\nnot fancied that for Irish barbarism Protestantism of the Anglican type\r\nwas the sovereign cure. Bacon, as one of his three specifics for the\r\nrecovery of the hearts of the people, had recommended a toleration,\r\npartial and temporary at least, of the Catholic religion, which was to be\r\ncombined \"with the sending over of some good preachers, especially of that\r\nsort which are vehement and zealous persuaders and not scholastical, to be\r\nresident in principal towns.\" The government issued a politic manifesto,\r\npromising to all native Irish of the poorer class equal protection and\r\ncomplete immunity from any oppressive claims of chiefs. But let the\r\ngovernment charm as wisely as it might, it could not charm away the\r\ndifference of race, language, and character, the antagonism of religion,\r\nthe memories of the long and murderous struggle, the ravenous cupidity and\r\noverbearing attitude of the alien adventurer, the anguish of the native\r\nwho saw the stranger in possession of his land.\r\n\r\nJames called a Parliament for all Ireland, Catholic as well as Protestant.\r\nIt was packed for the Crown, which created boroughs for that purpose.\r\nStill, it was something more like a national assembly than Ireland had\r\never seen or in fact was destined again to see. The elections to it were\r\nfiercely contested between the races and religions. Its first sitting was\r\ncharacteristic. There was a division on the election of a speaker. One\r\nparty went out into the lobby. In its absence the other party seated its\r\nman in the chair. The party which had gone out, returning and finding what\r\nhad been done, seated their man in the other man's lap. The importance of\r\nthis Parliament, however, is extolled by Sir John Davies, and one act, at\r\nall events, stands to its credit. It repealed the statute of Kilkenny and\r\nall other laws recognizing and perpetuating distinctions of race,\r\ndeclaring that their cause had ceased, since the inhabitants of the\r\nkingdom without distinction were henceforth under the protection of the\r\nCrown, and the best way of settling peace was to allow their intercourse\r\nand intermarriage so that they might grow into one nation. There was a\r\ntransient ray of sunlight on the dark scene. Efforts were made to improve\r\nTrinity College, and learning shone forth in the person of Usher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was still in Ireland a mine charged with the wrath of the\r\ndispossessed added to the hatred of race and religion, the religious\r\nhatred being the more deadly because, the Protestants of Ireland being\r\nCalvinist, the antagonism was extreme. The match was applied to the mine\r\nby the outbreak of revolution in England under Charles I. Strafford,\r\nhaving passed from the ranks of patriotism to the place left vacant by the\r\ndeath of Buckingham in the councils of the king, came with his dark look\r\nof command as viceroy to play the part of beneficent despot in Ireland,\r\nand at the same time to raise an army there for his master. The part of\r\ndespot he played to perfection, making the Irish Parliament the tool of\r\nhis will, applying to it and to the government in general his own and\r\nLaud's high royalist policy of Thorough. The part of beneficent despot he\r\nplayed to a considerable extent. He set his heel on the rapacity of the\r\nadventurers, compelling the chief of them, the Earl of Cork, to disgorge.\r\nHe enforced order and put down piracy, which in the general disorder had\r\nbecome rife. He fostered the cultivation of flax and the linen trade,\r\nthough he paid blackmail to English protectionism by prohibiting the\r\nwoollen manufacture. He did his best to reform the State Church, which he\r\nfound sunk in torpor, sinecurism, and simony, while its edifices were\r\nruins and piggeries. Unluckily he was a strict Anglican, whereas the only\r\nProtestantism in Ireland which had life in it was the Calvinistic\r\nProtestantism represented by Usher. He made a mortal enemy by turning the\r\nsumptuous monument of Lady Cork off the place of the high altar. But to\r\nfind means of raising an army for his king he had to resort to violent\r\nmeasures. He dragooned the Parliament into granting extraordinary\r\nsupplies. The king had pledged himself in the form of \"graces\" to respect\r\nand quiet titles to large tracts of land. These graces Strafford thrust\r\naside. By legal chicane and intimidation of juries he, in defiance of the\r\nking's plighted word, confiscated a great part of the land of Connaught. A\r\nlegal raid of the Crown on the estates which the city of London had\r\npurchased in Ulster made the lord deputy another formidable enemy. He\r\nadded to the number by trampling on the pride of men of rank and\r\ninfluence. Strafford had formed his army. That he intended it as a\r\nsupport to the arbitrary government of Charles is beyond question; his\r\nbetrayal of that intention by some loose words uttered in council formed\r\nthe most damaging piece of evidence against him; and though the army broke\r\nup on his departure, fears of it continued to haunt the English mind and\r\nto intensify English feeling against the Irish. The Irish Parliament\r\njoined in the impeachment of the man who had trampled on it, and when\r\nStrafford pleaded in defence of his arbitrary measures, that Ireland was a\r\nconquered country, Pym's retort was, \"They were a conquered nation! There\r\ncannot be a word more pregnant or fruitful in treason than that word is.\r\nThere are few nations in the world that have not been conquered, and no\r\ndoubt but the conqueror may give what law he pleases to those that are\r\nconquered; but if the succeeding pacts and agreements do not limit and\r\nrestrain that right, what people can be secure? England hath been\r\nconquered, and Wales hath been conquered, and by this reason will be in no\r\nbetter case than Ireland. If the king by the right of a conqueror gives\r\nlaws to his people, shall not the people by the same reason be restored to\r\nthe right of the conquered to recover their liberty if they can?\"\r\n\r\nRevolution was in the air. It stirred the heart of the Catholic cowering\r\nunder the penal law, who saw the foot of his arch-enemy the Puritan on the\r\nsteps of power. It stirred still more the heart of the disinherited\r\nnative, especially on the forfeited domain of Tyrone. One of those great\r\npopular conspiracies of which the Irish have the gift was formed under the\r\nleadership of Phelim O'Neill, who ranked among his countrymen as head of\r\nthe great sept of O'Neill, and cherished ancestral traditions of vast\r\ndomains and princely power. With Phelim O'Neill was a better man, Roger\r\nMoore, one of the disinherited, a deadly enemy of England. The rebellion\r\nposed as royalist, declaring for the king against the Puritan and\r\nrevolutionary Parliament; its aims were Ireland for the Irish, and\r\nCatholicism as the Irish religion. Phelim O'Neill was not a man to\r\nrestrain from crime. But the people, once launched in insurrection, were\r\nprobably beyond control. They rose upon the English settlers in Ulster,\r\ndrove them from their homes, and massacred some thousands with the usual\r\ncruelty, women and children taking part in the fiendish work. Many were\r\nstripped naked and exposed to perish in the cold. Dublin was full of\r\nshivering and famished fugitives. The capital itself narrowly escaped\r\nthrough fortunate betrayal of the plot, such as in an Irish conspiracy\r\nseldom fails. It was natural that panic should exaggerate the number\r\nmurdered, as it was that panic and superstition together should see the\r\nspectres of the English who had been drowned by the rebels at Portadown.\r\nThe effect upon the English, above all upon the Puritan mind, was like\r\nthat of the Sepoy mutiny and the massacre of Cawnpore. Ruthless\r\nretaliation followed. Where the Protestants got the upper hand, Irish men,\r\nwomen, and children were butchered without mercy. Thenceforth the Irishman\r\nwas to the Puritan a wild beast or worse. All Irishmen who landed in\r\nEngland to fight for the king, with the women who followed their camps,\r\nwere put to the sword. An Irishwoman left behind by a Munster regiment at\r\nthe siege of Lyme was torn to pieces by the women of the place.\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament at once, being short of money, passed, to provide\r\nfor the Irish war, an act confiscating in advance two and a half millions\r\nof acres of rebel land as security for a loan; a measure, to say the\r\nleast, extreme and sure to make the conflict internecine. The act passed\r\nwithout a dissentient voice, and was one of the last that received the\r\nassent of Charles.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland against the dark clouds of the storm one rainbow appeared. The\r\nProtestant Bishop Bedel, though a proselytizer, had by his beneficence won\r\nthe love of his Catholic neighbours. He and his family were not only\r\nspared by the rebels, but treated with loving-kindness, and when he died a\r\nfarewell salute was fired over his grave.\r\n\r\nThus commenced a course of mutual slaughter which lasted eleven years,\r\nand, according to Sir William Petty, cost, by sword, plague, and famine,\r\nthe lives of a third part of the population. A great pasture country was\r\nreduced to the importation of foreign meat. A traveller could ride twenty\r\nor thirty miles without seeing a trace of human life, and wolves, fed on\r\nhuman flesh, multiplied and prowled in packs within a few miles of Dublin.\r\nNumbers abandoned the country and enlisted in foreign services. Slave\r\ndealers plied their trade and shipped boys and girls to Barbados.\r\n\r\nStrafford's place as deputy not having been filled, the government\r\nremained in the hands of the Puritan Lords Justices Parsons and Borlase,\r\nthe first an intriguer and jobber, the second a worn-out soldier and a\r\ncipher. They had prorogued the Parliament by which they might have been\r\nrestrained. The commander of the army on the king's side and the\r\nrepresentative of the king's interest was Ormonde, the head of the\r\nloyalist house or sept of Butler, a man thoroughly honourable as well as\r\nable and wise, whose character stands out nobly amidst the dark carnival\r\nof evil.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say to which of the contending parties the palm of\r\natrocity is to be awarded. Probably to that of the government, which knew\r\nno measure in the extermination of Catholics and rebels. Where Ormonde\r\ncommanded there was sure to have been comparative mercy. Mercy there\r\ncertainly was on the side of the insurgents when they were commanded by\r\nOwen O'Neill, a genuine soldier trained in foreign service and observant\r\nof the rules of civilized war. But a papal legate who was in the Catholic\r\ncamp gleefully reports that after a battle won by the confederates no\r\nprisoners had been taken. By the soldiery of the government at least\r\nchildren were butchered, the saying being that \"nits make lice.\"\r\n\r\nThe anti-Catholic policy of the Puritan government and the castle had\r\ndriven into the arms of insurrection the Catholic lords of the Pale,\r\nEnglish in blood, normally hostile to the tribes though they were. The\r\nConfederation formed at Kilkenny a provisional government with an assembly\r\nof priests and laity combined, which elected a council of war. The\r\nassembly was presently joined by a papal nuncio, Rinuccini, who brought\r\nmoney from Rome and it seems at the same time encouragement of the\r\nrebellion from Richelieu. The nuncio sought to control everything in the\r\nparamount interest of the Papacy, which thus once more appears as a power\r\nof temporal ambition. The assembly was not unanimous. Of the clergy and\r\nthe nuncio the chief aims were the ascendency of the Catholic Church and\r\nthe recovery of the confiscated Church lands. The chief aims of the lay\r\nlords were lay; they wanted relief from political disabilities and\r\nrecovery of their political power. Restoration to the Church of the abbey\r\nlands, of the grantees of which they were the heirs, was by no means to\r\ntheir mind.\r\n\r\nOf the origin of the rebellion in Ulster King Charles was perfectly\r\ninnocent, though he drew suspicion on himself by some careless words.\r\nNothing worse for his cause could have happened. But when in his wrestle\r\nwith the Puritan he was thrown, he began to cast a longing eye on the\r\nforces in Ireland which, though rebel and Catholic, were at all events\r\nhostile to the Puritan. There ensued a series of tangled intrigues with\r\nthe Confederates, in the course of which Charles showed his usual\r\nweakness and duplicity, while he was fatally committed by the mingled\r\nrashness and tergiversation of his envoy, Glamorgan, the result being a\r\ndisclosure very injurious to the poor king's character and cause. The\r\nConfederacy was divided between a party which was for treating and a party\r\nwhich was for war to the knife. For war to the knife was the nuncio, an\r\necclesiastical termagant of the Becket stamp, inflated with notions of his\r\nown spiritual power and reckless in the pursuit of his own end, which was\r\nto lay Ireland at the feet of the Pope. In all this the high-minded\r\nOrmonde sadly stooped to take a part for his royal master's sake. When the\r\ncause of his royal master was finally lost, he surrendered his command to\r\nthe Parliament and left Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of Charles the scene shifted again. Abhorrence of\r\nregicide brought about a junction of the more moderate Protestants with\r\nthe more moderate Confederates, uniting different parties and sections\r\nunder a common profession of loyalty. Ormonde then returned to lead a\r\nmixed and not very harmonious force against Michael Jones, the Republican\r\ncommander. He advanced to the attack of Dublin, but was totally defeated\r\nby Jones.\r\n\r\nNow on the wings of victory came Cromwell with ten thousand of the New\r\nModel. His proclamation on landing promised to all who would keep the\r\npeace, peace and protection for themselves. That proclamation, the first\r\nutterance of law and order heard in those parts for ten years, was\r\nstrictly carried into effect. A soldier was hanged for robbing a native of\r\na fowl. No disorder, rapine, or outrage upon women is laid to the charge\r\nof the Puritan army in Ireland. Cromwell sat down before Drogheda, which\r\nwas held by a large royalist garrison, partly English. The garrison having\r\nrefused to surrender on summons, he stormed. Two attacks failed; a third,\r\nled by himself, took the town. He put the garrison to the sword. That a\r\ngarrison refusing to surrender on summons and standing a storm might be\r\nput to the sword was the rule of war in those days; it was the law, though\r\nnot the rule, of war even in the days of Wellington. Nevertheless, this\r\nwas a fell act for a commander who was generally humane in war, and at\r\nWorcester risked his life in persuading Royalists to take quarter. Of this\r\nCromwell was himself sensible, and he spoke of it with compunction. \"I am\r\npersuaded,\" he said in his despatch to the Parliament, \"that this is a\r\nrighteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches who have imbrued\r\ntheir hands in so much innocent blood; and that it will tend to prevent\r\nthe effusion of blood for the future; which are the satisfactory grounds\r\nto such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret.\" Were\r\nremorse and regret ever breathed by Alva, Parma, or Tilly? What did the\r\nsoldiery of those Catholic commanders do when it stormed a Protestant\r\ntown? What did the British soldiery, maddened by the recollection of a\r\nmassacre far less than that of 1641 do, not only to the Sepoy mutineer,\r\nbut to the insurgent people of Oude? When Rupert stormed Leicester, the\r\ntown was sacked, and women and children were found among the dead. The\r\nRoyalist Carte, in his life of Ormonde, commenting on the slaughter of the\r\ngarrison of Drogheda, says, \"This was certainly an execrable policy in\r\nthat regicide. But it had the effect he proposed. It spread abroad the\r\nterror of his name; it cut off the best body of the Irish troops and\r\ndisheartened the rest to such a degree that it was a greater loss in\r\nitself and much more fatal in its consequences than the rout at\r\nRathmines.\" This is not a defence, nor much of an excuse. But it testifies\r\nto a motive other than mere thirst of blood and shows that Cromwell spoke\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nThere was cruel slaughter again at the storming of Wexford, but it does\r\nnot appear that it was ordered by Cromwell. The defences having been\r\ncarried, the combat was renewed within the town by the townspeople, who,\r\nit is stated, had provoked wrath by their piracy and by drowning a number\r\nof Protestants in a hulk. The city had been summoned to surrender on fair\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nCromwell was at once called away to the war with Scotland. He left the war\r\nin Ireland to be finished by Ireton and Ludlow, who gradually extinguished\r\norganized resistance, leaving only something between guerilla warfare and\r\nbrigandage called \"Toryism,\" a name presently transmitted to a great\r\npolitical party in England which bore it as a name of honour, in\r\nopposition to that of Whig, on every hypothesis equally humble in its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThe two races and religions had fought for the land, and the Saxon and\r\nProtestant had won. It is surely simple to suggest that the winner ought\r\nto have invited the loser to take the prize, especially after such a\r\ndisplay of that loser's sentiments and intentions as the massacre of 1641.\r\nHad it not been made fearfully clear that the two races and religions\r\ncould not dwell together in peace? The victorious Puritan drove the\r\nCatholic into Connaught. The Catholic, if he could, would have driven the\r\nPuritan into the sea. The original decree of \"To Hell or Connaught,\" the\r\nhateful sound of which still rings in Irish ears, seems to have been\r\nsomewhat mitigated as the wrath of the victor cooled. At all events the\r\nsentence extended to landowners only, not to artisans and labourers, who\r\nwere to remain where they were and to be disciplined and civilized by\r\nEnglish masters. A great number of those who had fought on the losing side\r\nwere sent away to foreign service, ridding Ireland of a manifest danger\r\nand forming the first instalment of the grand Irish element in the armies\r\nof Catholic Europe. There was also a large deportation to Barbados,\r\nincluding probably families left behind by the military emigration. This\r\nwas cruel work, the more so as there was terrible suffering in the\r\npassage. The whole business was horrible and deplorable. But in passing\r\nsentence on the winner we must remember what the loser, had he been the\r\nwinner, would have done. The shadow of an evil destiny was over all.\r\nDeportation was not to slavery for life, but to terminable bondage, one\r\ndegree less cruel.\r\n\r\nTo cast all on Cromwell is most unfair. He had nothing specially to do\r\nwith Ireland till he came to put an end to the war. He left it forever\r\nwhen he had struck his decisive blow. He could no more have given back the\r\ncontested land to the Catholics than he could have turned the Shannon to\r\nits source. The act under which the land had been forfeited in advance and\r\na loan on it raised had been passed by the unanimous vote of Parliament\r\nand had received the assent of the king. The soldiers who held land-scrip\r\nfor their pay presented their claims. As little would it have been\r\npossible for Cromwell, even if he had desired it, to license the\r\ncelebration of the Mass, which in Puritan eyes was a sign, not only of\r\nidolatry, but of allegiance to a foreign power, that power the mortal\r\nenemy, not of the Protestant religion only, but of the Protestant State.\r\nWith liberty of conscience Cromwell declared that he would not interfere.\r\nThis was something in an age when the rack and the stake of the\r\nInquisition were still at work and when Irish troopers in the service of a\r\nCatholic power were butchering the Protestant peasantry of Savoy. If the\r\nNuncio Rinuccini had got the upper hand in Ireland, a retirement of heresy\r\ninto the sanctuary of conscience would scarcely have saved it from the\r\nstake. Cromwell does not appear to have persecuted in Ireland or to have\r\ngiven the word for persecution.\r\n\r\nThe Protector united Ireland as well as Scotland to England, thus bringing\r\nthe factions under the control of a strong government, Ireland's only hope\r\nof peace. Union assured her free trade with Great Britain and the\r\ndependencies, an inestimable boon, not in the way of material wealth only,\r\nbut in that of commercial civilization, as its withdrawal afterwards\r\nfatally proved. Her shipping was at the same time assured of exemption\r\nfrom the disabilities of the Navigation Laws. The Protector sent her a\r\ngood governor in the person of his son Henry, who seems to have identified\r\nhimself with the welfare of her people. He sent her a liberal law reformer\r\nin the person of Chief Justice Coke, proposing to himself to treat her as\r\na blank paper, whereon he could write reforms such as professional bigotry\r\ndebarred him from effecting in England. His mortal enemy Clarendon, after\r\ndilating on the iniquities of the settlement, says, \"And, which is more\r\nwonderful, all this was done and settled within little more than two years\r\nto that degree of perfection that there were many buildings raised for\r\nbeauty as well as use, orderly and regular plantations of trees, and\r\nfences and enclosures raised throughout the kingdom, purchases made by\r\none from the other at very valuable rates, and jointures made upon\r\nmarriages, and all other conveyances and settlements executed, as in a\r\nkingdom at peace within itself, and where no doubt could be made of the\r\nvalidity of titles.\" If these material improvements were at first limited\r\nto the domain and race of the victor, they would in time have spread.\r\n\r\nCromwell's own letter to Sadler on the administration of justice in\r\nIreland breathes anything but the ferocity ascribed to him. About religion\r\nhe speaks in his unctuous Puritan way, but in a tone far from savage.\r\n\"First let me tell you, in divers places where we come, we find the people\r\nvery greedy after the Word, and flocking to Christian meetings; much of\r\nthat prejudice that lies upon poor people in England being a stranger to\r\ntheir minds. And truly we have hoped much of it is done in simplicity; and\r\nI mind you the rather of this because it is a sweet symptom, if not an\r\nearnest of the good we expect.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHis words on the social question in the same letter show tenderness of\r\nfeeling. \"Sir, it seems to me we have a great opportunity to set up until\r\nthe Parliament shall otherwise determine, a way of doing justice among\r\nthese poor people, which for the uprightness and cheapness of it may\r\nexceedingly gain upon them who have been accustomed to as much injustice,\r\ntyranny, and oppression from their landlords the great men, and those that\r\nshould have done them right as (I believe) any people in that which we\r\ncall Christendom.... Sir, if justice were freely and impartially\r\nadministered here, the foregoing darkness and corruption would make it\r\nlook so much the more glorious and beautiful and draw more hearts after\r\nit.\" This is not the language of hatred, much less of extermination.\r\n\r\nCritics of Cromwell fail to notice that his mind opened as he rose,\r\nnotably in the way of religious toleration. The Ironside had now become a\r\ngreat statesman. \"Savage\" the writer of his domestic letters surely can\r\nnever have been.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of Ireland in the Parliament of the Protectorate, it\r\nis true, were nominees. A popular election on the morrow of the Civil War,\r\nand with its embers still glowing, would have been out of the question.\r\nThe union of the Parliaments effected, and representation granted, popular\r\nelection would have come in time. Meantime, there was the sheltering and\r\ncontrolling authority of the Protector and the Council of State.\r\n\r\nTo charge Cromwell with having misunderstood the genius of the Irish\r\nnation and wronged it by his policy seems absurd. There was, in reality,\r\nno Irish nation. There was an island inhabited partly by the wreck of\r\nCeltic tribes, partly by conquerors and colonists of another race, the two\r\nraces differing widely in character, speaking different languages, having\r\nantagonistic religions, not alien only, but desperately hostile to each\r\nother. Deadly experience had shown that, left to themselves, they could\r\nnot live at peace. There was no political union, no attachment to a native\r\ndynasty, no tradition or sentiment truly national among the wreckage of\r\nthe septs. The religious bond, it is true, had been greatly strengthened\r\namong them by the conflict, and formed something like a national tie. But\r\nadaptation of his policy to Catholic character and sentiment could hardly\r\nbe expected of a Puritan chief in the age of the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe European war between Catholicism and Protestantism, and the consequent\r\nmingling of religious with political strife, were everywhere a fatal\r\nstumbling-block to statesmanship in that day. It does not seem that\r\nCromwell dealt with the difficulty in England or Ireland less wisely and\r\nliberally than did statesmanship elsewhere. Perhaps the greater share of\r\nliberality was his. The signs of his personal inclination were certainly\r\non the liberal side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of the Protector before his hour, and the military anarchy which\r\nensued, brought on the Restoration. The Restoration brought claims on the\r\npart of dispossessed Royalism for restitution in both countries. The\r\noccupants of confiscated lands in Ireland, seeing what must come, had\r\nunder the leadership of opportunist politicians, such as Broghill and\r\nCork, worshipped with politic rapture the return of the Royal Sun. The\r\ndisinherited on the other hand clamorously pressed their claim to\r\nrestitution. To that claim honour bade and sympathy inclined Charles II.\r\nto give ear. But the adventurers were a formidable body, and while their\r\nprofessions were fervently loyal their hands were on their swords. Nor did\r\nProtestant England, even in its hot fit of loyalty, love the Irish\r\nCatholic or forget the massacre of 1641. There ensued a vast controversy,\r\ndesperately embarrassing to Clarendon, Charles's chief adviser, to Charles\r\nhimself no doubt an insufferable bore. Intrigue and corruption, in which\r\nthe possessors were strong, contended with argument in the fray. The\r\ngovernment at last took refuge in the appointment of a commission\r\ninstructed to decide claims to restitution on the principle of complicity\r\nor non-complicity in the rebellion of 1641; a criterion rather difficult\r\nof application, since Charles I. had on the one hand assented to the Act\r\nof Forfeiture, and on the other hand by treating with the Confederates had\r\npractically recognized their loyalty to the crown. The upshot was an Act\r\nof Settlement with a supplementary Act of Explanation, under which the\r\npossessors retained about two-thirds of the lands, the disinherited\r\ngetting the other one-third, eked out with scraps, which by escheat or\r\nforfeiture for regicide were at the disposal of the crown. The Act of\r\nSettlement was thenceforth in the eyes of the Protestant possessor the\r\ngreat charter of proprietary right, to be upheld at whatever cost; in the\r\neyes of the dispossessed Catholic, the hateful muniment of proprietary\r\nwrong, to be cancelled whenever he had the power. The net result of the\r\nAct of Settlement and Explanation was that Ulster was left, as it remains,\r\na Protestant pale.\r\n\r\nThe Anglican State Church recovered all its possessions and privileges,\r\nand was once more planted on the neck of a Catholic people. It is sad to\r\nlearn that Jeremy Taylor, who, when under persecution, had eloquently\r\ndefended liberty of prophesying, as a bishop of the restored Irish\r\nestablishment defended that liberty no more. But how could a hierarch of\r\nthe State Church of Ireland fail to don its spirit with his mitre?\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Protector's work was undone. The union of Scotland and\r\nIreland with England was broken. Ireland was again reduced to the state of\r\na dependency, and of a dependency unloved and unrespected, whose interests\r\nwere to be always sacrificed to those of the country which was the seat of\r\npower. Of this she was soon made fatally sensible. Protectionism was the\r\ncreed of that dark age. Ireland as a fine grazing country had been doing a\r\nprofitable export trade with England in cattle, pork, bacon, and dairy\r\nproduce. The English grazier demanded of his Parliament protection against\r\nthe free importation of food, denounced by him as a \"nuisance.\" On his\r\ndemand an act was passed prohibiting the trade. Good sense and the public\r\ninterest struggled hard. The debate was unusually fierce. Ominous\r\nexpressions of contempt for the Irish were heard, and led to a challenge.\r\nThe king had the good sense to disapprove the measure, but gave way, as he\r\nwas sure to do. The patriotic policy of the grazier triumphed. Irish fish\r\nnarrowly escaped prohibition at the same time. This was the first of a\r\nline of prohibitive acts fatal to the commerce of Ireland and to her\r\ncommercial civilization. At the same time she came under the Navigation\r\nLaws, which were fatal to her shipping trade.\r\n\r\nIreland, however, had the good fortune to be during the greater part of\r\nthe reign of Charles II. under the government of that Duke of Ormonde who\r\nhad commanded for the king in the Civil War. The duke was a statesman,\r\nlike Clarendon and Southampton, of the old and honourable cavalier school,\r\nuntainted by the political profligacy or the social dissoluteness of the\r\nmen of the Cabal. He governed as impartially as the anti-Catholic laws and\r\nhis own strict Anglicanism would let him; did his best to keep the peace\r\nbetween the factions, political and religious; promoted manufactures and\r\ntrade, encouraged and endowed education, founded a college of medicine,\r\norganized a national militia. He heartily identified himself with Irish\r\ninterests, and opposed the Cattle Act with an energy and a force of\r\nargument which entitle his memory to the respect of free traders. It is\r\nthe sad truth that of Irish history between the Conquest and the Union the\r\none bright period is the viceroyalty of Ormonde.\r\n\r\nIreland unhappily, though her interests were out of the pale of English\r\ncare, was not out of the pale of English faction and revolution. The\r\nStuart brothers, plotting with their French patron the subversion of\r\nEnglish religion and liberty, looked to Catholic Ireland for help in their\r\nplot. They cultivated the Catholic interest there, and against the law\r\npromoted Catholics to office and command. Richard Talbot, lying Dick,\r\nafterwards Duke of Tyrconnel, one of the lowest of their wonderfully low\r\nagents, as well as about the most violent, appeared upon the scene. It was\r\nprobably by thwarting or refusing to promote this conspiracy that Ormonde,\r\na strict Protestant though of the Anglican school, and constitutional\r\nthough a monarchist, incurred temporary dismissal from his viceroyalty.\r\nPossibly in the same quarter may be sought the explanation of the\r\nmysterious attempt at murdering him by Blood, of the criminal connection\r\nof the court with whom there can be little doubt. On the other hand, the\r\ncruel anti-Catholic panic, created in England by the well-founded\r\nsuspicion of danger to Protestantism from Stuart intrigue with France\r\nwhich gave birth to the Popish plot, extended its rage to Ireland. The\r\nlast and most pitiable of the innocent victims of that frenzy was the\r\nCatholic Archbishop Plunket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSigns of preparation for the Stuart attack on Protestantism and liberty\r\nwere visible in Ireland as well as in England in the last years of Charles\r\nII. But the blow was suspended during the life of the Merry Monarch, who\r\npreferred the calm of the seraglio to the stir of a great enterprise, and\r\ndid not want to go again upon his travels. With the accession of Charles's\r\nfanatical and blundering brother, the crisis came. The Viceroy Clarendon,\r\na Tory of Tories, but an Anglican, was deposed from the viceroyalty, and\r\nquitted Ireland with a stream of Protestant refugees in his train. Into\r\nhis place vaulted Dick Talbot, now Duke of Tyrconnel, drunk with the fury\r\nof Romanizing and despotic reaction. A Catholic reign of terror set in.\r\nProtestants were disarmed; driven from places of authority, political,\r\njudicial, or municipal; practically outlawed, plundered, outraged,\r\ncompelled to fly for their lives. The country seethed with a general orgie\r\nof insurrection and revenge. The people swarmed to the standard of\r\nCatholic and agrarian revolution, rather than to that of the English\r\nking, for whom they cared little and who cared little for them. Presently\r\ncame James, ejected from England, with the power of his French patron at\r\nhis back. Under him a packed Parliament repealed the Act of Settlement by\r\nwhich the Protestants held their lands, proclaiming reconfiscation and\r\nexpulsion on a vast scale. Not satisfied with this, the Parliament passed\r\na monstrous Act of Attainder against a large portion of the Protestant\r\nproprietary. Nor can it be assumed that the frantic hatred which inspired\r\nthis act would have confined itself to spoliation, for which the repeal of\r\nthe Act of Settlement might have pretty well sufficed. A long lifetime had\r\nnot yet passed since 1641. James, who was not an Irish patriot but an\r\nEnglish king out of possession, would have vetoed the Act of Attainder had\r\nhe dared. But he dared not. He even suffered himself in this case to be\r\ndivested of the royal prerogative of pardon. Another prerogative, that of\r\nregulating the coin, he exercised by sanctioning a base issue on a large\r\nscale, which, being made legal tender, completed the ruin of the\r\nProtestant trader.\r\n\r\nBut Protestantism, the stern Protestantism of the Calvinist, rallied on\r\nits own ground, and behind the mouldering walls of Derry made against a\r\nCatholic host one of the heroic defences of history, a worthy theme in an\r\nafter time for the most brilliant of historians. In the battle of Newtown\r\nButler, Protestantism again triumphed over odds. Succour at length came\r\nfrom England. It came first in the person of the renowned Schomberg, whose\r\narmy, however, made up of raw recruits, ill supplied by fraudulent\r\ncontractors, and filled with disease by the moisture of the climate,\r\nmiserably rotted. At last the bonfires of jubilant Protestantism announced\r\nthat William of Orange had landed. On the Boyne he gained a small battle\r\nbut a great victory, which decided that the Protestant Saxon, not the\r\nCatholic Celt, should be master of Ireland. James fled to the luxurious\r\nasylum of his French master, and with him fled the last hope of the\r\nCatholic cause.\r\n\r\nOnce more, however, at Aghrim, the Catholic, under the command of the\r\nFrench General St. Ruth, accepted the wager of battle in open field. He\r\nfought well, and the fortune of the day wavered, when a cannon shot took\r\noff St. Ruth's head. Protestantism owed its victory largely to a regiment\r\nof French Huguenots exiled by the bigoted tyranny of their own king.\r\n\r\nAll was over in the field. The irresistible Marlborough reduced Cork and\r\nKinsale. But in Limerick, by soldiers pronounced untenable, Catholicism\r\nhad its Derry. Its hero Sarsfield, by a daring march, cut off William's\r\nsiege artillery, and, after a fierce assault, gallantly repulsed, William\r\nwas fain to raise the siege. After his departure Ginkell again invested\r\nthe place, and Sarsfield, finding that the last hour of the last Catholic\r\nstronghold had come, capitulated on terms. The military terms of the\r\nsurrender were strictly observed. The political terms, securing a measure\r\nof religious liberty to Catholics, though endorsed by William in his wise\r\nDutch love of toleration, were repudiated by Parliament. The \"violated\r\ntreaty of Limerick\" was an ugly business, though there seems to have been\r\nno protest at the time. But James had fled. The garrison of Limerick had\r\nno status but a military one, to which surrender put an end. Politically\r\nthey were merely insurgents. Could any political terms made with them have\r\nbound the sovereign authority of the Irish and British Parliaments in\r\ndealing with their own citizens forever? Can Sarsfield have thought that\r\nthey did?\r\n\r\nA crowd of Irish women and children lined the shore at Limerick, watching\r\nwith tearful eyes the receding sails of the fleet which bore away their\r\nhusbands and fathers, the garrison of the last Catholic stronghold, to\r\nservice in foreign lands. The defenders of Limerick were thus exchanged\r\nfor the Huguenot exiles who had charged and conquered at Aghrim. Those\r\nmen, with many an exile from Catholic Ireland who followed in their track,\r\nwent to form the Irish brigade and to redeem on foreign fields battles\r\nlost in their own land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that mortal struggle, had the Catholic won, he would have deprived the\r\nProtestant certainly of his land, perhaps of his life. The Protestant,\r\nhaving won, proceeded at once to avenge and secure himself by binding down\r\nhis vanquished foe with chains of iron. Chains of iron indeed they were.\r\nBy the series of enactments called the Penal Code, passed by the Irish\r\nParliament with some assistance from that of England, the Irish Catholic\r\nwas reduced to helotage political and social, while measures were taken\r\nfor the extirpation of his religion. To crush him politically he was\r\nexcluded from Parliament, from the franchise, from municipal office, from\r\nthe magistracy, from the jury box, as well as from public appointments of\r\nall kinds, and even from the police force. To crush him socially he was\r\nexcluded from all the higher callings but that of medicine, from the\r\nbench, from the bar, and from the army. He was denied the armorial\r\nbearings which denoted a gentleman. To divorce him from the land, he was\r\nforbidden to acquire freehold or a lease beneficial beyond a certain\r\nrate; he was debarred from bequeathing his estate; and his estate was\r\nbroken up by making it heritable in gavelkind. The gate of knowledge was\r\nclosed against him. He was shut out of the university; forbidden to open a\r\nschool; forbidden to send his children abroad for education. That he might\r\nnever rise against oppression, he was disarmed and prohibited from keeping\r\na horse of more than five pounds' value. He might not even be a gamekeeper\r\nor a watchman.\r\n\r\nThe law, without actually prohibiting the Catholic religion, provided, as\r\nwas hoped, for its extirpation. All priests were required to be\r\nregistered, and were forbidden to perform service out of their own parish.\r\nAll Catholic archbishops and bishops were banished, and were made\r\npunishable with death if they returned, so that in future there could be\r\nno ordinations. Monks and friars also were banished. Catholic chapels\r\nmight not have bells or steeples. There were to be no pilgrimages or\r\nwayside crosses. Rewards were offered to informers against Catholic\r\nbishops, priests, and schoolmasters, and their trade was lauded as\r\nhonourable service to the state. Marriage of a Catholic with a Protestant\r\nwas prohibited; to perform it was a capital offence; so was conversion of\r\na Protestant to Catholicism. Religious hatred outraged domestic affection\r\nby enacting that if the son of a Catholic turned Protestant the\r\ninheritance should at once vest in him, his father being reduced to a life\r\ninterest; that the wife of a Catholic turning Protestant should be set\r\nfree from her husband's control and entitled to a settlement; that a\r\nCatholic could not be a guardian, so that, dying, he had to leave his\r\nchildren to the guardianship of an enemy of their faith.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the government designated the Catholics officially as\r\n\"our enemies.\" The Irish Parliament was exhorted to put an end to all\r\ndistinctions except that between Protestant and Papist. To such a relation\r\nbetween races under the same government history can scarcely show a\r\nparallel, unless it be the case of the Moriscos in Spain.\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" says Burke, \"a complete system full of coherence and\r\nconsistency; well digested and well composed in all its parts. It was a\r\nmachine of wise and elaborate contrivance and was as well fitted for the\r\noppression, impoverishment, and degradation of a people and the debasement\r\nin them of human nature itself as ever proceeded from the perverted\r\ningenuity of man.\" It was the panic rage of a garrison which had narrowly\r\nescaped extermination, and less cruel than the treatment of the Huguenots\r\nby the Catholic king at the instigation of the Jesuit and with the\r\napprobation of the Catholic Church in France. The fires of the Inquisition\r\nwere still burning, and continued for some time to burn. If the British\r\nParliament shares the guilt of the Penal Code, twice had an army of Irish\r\nCatholics been raised for the destruction of English liberties. When last\r\nthose liberties were in the extremity of peril, a force of Irish Catholics\r\nhad been encamped at Hounslow. Nor was Catholicism merely a religion. It\r\nwas allegiance to a power which claimed the suzerainty of Ireland, which\r\nhad launched the decree of deposition against Elizabeth, which, after the\r\nrising of 1641, had sent its nuncio to the rebel council of Kilkenny.\r\nThese memories on both sides ought long ago to have been consigned to a\r\ncommon grave.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it was deplorable that the settlement of the Catholic\r\nprovinces after their reconquest should have been left to the Protestants\r\nof Ireland, transported with rage and fear. The true course, had it been\r\npossible, was the union of Ireland with England. Representatives of the\r\nloyal districts of Ireland might have been called at once to the\r\nParliament at Westminster. The rest of the island might have been placed\r\nunder a strong government of pacification and settlement, till peace and\r\nthe reign of law had been thoroughly restored. It is needless to say that\r\nsuch a solution could not even suggest itself to the mind of any statesman\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nIn extirpating the Catholic religion the policy of the Penal Code failed.\r\nTo the faith which was their only comfort and sole redemption from utter\r\ndegradation the people more than ever clung. The priests braved the law,\r\ncelebrated mass in hiding-places, furtively ordained, several hands being\r\nlaid on at once that the man ordained might be able to swear that he did\r\nnot know who had ordained him. They taught in hedge schools, and, though\r\nbut coarsely educated themselves, preserved the scantling there was of\r\nknowledge and civilization among the people. In their celibacy they had a\r\ngreat advantage for such work. Interested conversions among Catholics of\r\nthe higher class, especially as passports to the bar, seem not to have\r\nbeen uncommon. An old lady of an ancient line is said to have embraced\r\nProtestantism avowedly against her conscience, saying that it was better\r\nthat one old woman should burn than that the estates of the house of\r\nTomond should go out of the family. But disinterested conversions there\r\nwere none. On the other hand Protestants in isolated settlements were\r\nturned Catholic by social contagion.\r\n\r\nOther parts of the code took deadly effect. The Catholics generally ceased\r\nto own land. Of their landed gentry, some went into exile. The people,\r\nbereft of their natural leaders, sank into apathetic helotage and mute\r\ndespair. Neither in 1715 nor in 1745, when a pretender again unfurled the\r\nbanner of the House of Stuart, was there the slightest political movement\r\namong them. Socially, the iron had entered their souls and they cowered\r\nunder the yoke of the ascendancy. Once, an informer having tendered a\r\nCatholic the legal ten pounds for his pair of fine horses, the Catholic\r\ndrew his pistol and shot the pair. But this was a rare spark of\r\nself-respect on the part of the helot.\r\n\r\nThe cup of woe was not yet full. In England, with revolution principles,\r\nthe mercantile party had mounted to power, and commerce in those days was\r\neverywhere ridden by the fallacy of protectionism, which killed the only\r\ngood articles in the Treaty of Utrecht, those opening free trade with\r\nFrance. Ireland, the English protectionist regarded as a foreign country,\r\nand a particularly dangerous enemy to his interest. The cattle trade\r\nhaving been killed by the act of Charles II., the Irish had taken to the\r\nexport trade in wool and to woollen manufactures. The wool grown on Irish\r\nsheepwalks was of the finest, and was eagerly purchased by France and\r\nSpain. This industry also English monopoly killed by prohibiting the\r\nexportation of wool to foreign countries and the importation of Irish\r\nwoollen goods into England. The same jealous rapacity seems to have\r\nsuccessively killed or crippled the cotton industry, the glove-making\r\nindustry, the glass industry, the brewing industry, to each of which\r\nIreland successively turned; English greed being bent, not only on\r\nexcluding the Irish competitor from its own market, but on keeping the\r\nIrish market to itself. Ireland had been promised free enjoyment of the\r\nlinen trade, which Strafford had encouraged by promoting the growing of\r\nflax while he discouraged the wool trade; yet even this promise Irish\r\nfinanciers could accuse England of eluding by tricks of the tariff.\r\nEngland needing more bar iron than she could produce, the importation of\r\nbar iron from Ireland was allowed; but the consequence was a consumption\r\nof timber for smelting which denuded Ireland of her forests.\r\n\r\nCromwell's union would have secured to Ireland exemption from the\r\ndisabilities of the Navigation Laws. The Restoration imposed them. They\r\nkilled her trade with the colonies and killed her shipping interest at the\r\nsame time. \"The conveniency of ports and harbours,\" said Swift, \"which\r\nnature has bestowed so liberally upon this kingdom, is of no more use to\r\nus than a beautiful prospect to a man shut up in a dungeon.\"\r\n\r\nIn all this Ireland was treated as a colony, meant only to be a feeder to\r\nthe imperial country. But her position was worse than that of the\r\ncolonies, in which commercial restrictions generally were loosely\r\nenforced, and which, when strict enforcement was attempted by Grenville,\r\nrose in arms. The colonies, moreover, were regarded with pride and\r\naffection. Popish Ireland was regarded with contempt and hatred.\r\n\r\nThe lawful trade in wool with foreign countries England had suppressed.\r\nIts place was partly taken by a smuggling trade, for which the inlets of\r\nthe Irish coast afforded the best of havens, and which had the people\r\neverywhere for confederates. Thus, in every line, religious, social,\r\neducational, and commercial, the Irishman found the law his inveterate\r\nenemy. Could he fail to be an inveterate enemy of the law?\r\n\r\nCut off from manufactures and from trade, the people were thrown for\r\nsubsistence wholly on the land, and land for the most part better suited\r\nfor pasture than for tillage. For the land they competed with the\r\neagerness of despair, undertaking to pay for their little lots rents which\r\nleft them and their families less than a bare subsistence. On such a scene\r\nof misery as the abodes of the Irish cotters the sun has rarely looked\r\ndown. Their homes were the most miserable hovels, chimneyless, filthy. Of\r\ndecent clothing they were destitute. Their food was the potato; sometimes\r\nthey bled their cattle and mixed the blood with sorrel. The old and sick\r\nwere everywhere dying by cold and hunger, and rotting amidst filth and\r\nvermin. When the potato failed, as it often did, came famine, with disease\r\nin its train. Want and misery were in every face; the roads were spread\r\nwith dead and dying; there were sometimes none to bear the dead to the\r\ngrave and they were buried in the fields and ditches where they perished.\r\nFluxes and malignant fevers followed, laying whole villages waste. \"I have\r\nseen,\" says a witness, \"the labourer endeavouring to work at his spade,\r\nbut fainting for want of food, and forced to omit it. I have seen the\r\nhelpless orphan exposed on the dunghill, and none to take him in for fear\r\nof infection. And I have seen the hungry infant sucking at the breast of\r\nthe already expired parent.\"[2] There was an enormous amount of vagrancy\r\nand mendicity, as there was in Scotland before the union. This was under\r\nthe government of the first of free nations, and in the era of Newton,\r\nAddison, and Pope.\r\n\r\nReduced to living like beasts, the people multiplied their kind with\r\nanimal recklessness. The result was fatal overpopulation, the pressure of\r\nwhich, aggravated by occasional failures of the treacherous potato, could\r\nbe relieved only by the tragic remedy of emigration on an immense scale.\r\n\r\nOf the landowners, who might have had compassion on their serfs, many were\r\nabsentees; residence in Ireland, especially when agrarian war began, being\r\nhardly pleasant. Their place was taken by the middleman, through whose\r\nruthless agency they extorted their rents and who frequently sublet,\r\nsometimes even three or four deep, so that the cotter groaned under a\r\nhierarchy of extortion. From the ranks of the middlemen were partly drawn\r\nthe upstart gentry, or squireens, a roistering, debauched, drinking, and\r\nduelling crew, whose tyrannical insolence scandalized Arthur Young,\r\nruling with the horse-whip a peasantry cowering under the lash and\r\nhopeless of redress by the law. The peasantry still largely spoke Erse,\r\nanother badge of their social inferiority, and a further barrier between\r\nthem and the ruling class.\r\n\r\nTo the extortion of the middleman was added that, even more hated, of the\r\ntithe proctor. The Protectorate had at all events relieved Ireland of the\r\nAnglican State Church. That incubus the monarchy reimposed, and the\r\npeasant was compelled out of the miserable produce of his potato field or\r\npatch of oats, besides the exorbitant rent, not only to provide for his\r\nown priest, but to pay tithe to a clergy whose mission was to extirpate\r\nthe peasant's religion. The Anglican bishoprics were rich. The rectories\r\nfor the most part were miserably poor, so that pluralism might be\r\nnecessary to make an income. But pluralism of the most scandalous kind\r\nalso prevailed, and we have a dean holding two groups of livings, fourteen\r\nlivings in all, one group twelve miles away from the other. Some of the\r\nclergy, on the plea that there were no glebe houses for them, were drawing\r\ntheir tithes in the pump room and at the card tables of Bath. Bishops were\r\nsometimes non-resident as well as scandalously secular and inert. Most of\r\nthem were English, and appointed to keep up the English interest. There\r\nwere bright exceptions, such as Bolter, King, above all Berkeley, but they\r\nwere few. Swift could say of Irish bishops that government no doubt\r\nappointed good men, but they were always murdered on Hounslow Heath by the\r\nhighwaymen, who took their credentials, personated them, and were\r\ninstalled in their place. There have been worse institutions than the\r\nState Church of Ireland; there was never a greater scandal. Even if\r\nAnglicanism had been less alien to the Irish heart, what chance would such\r\nmissionaries as these have had against the devoted emissaries of Rome?\r\nWhat must have been the feelings of the Irish peasant when of his crop of\r\npotatoes, all too scanty for him and his children, the tithe proctor came\r\nto claim a tenth part in the name of a Christian minister?\r\n\r\nThere were prelates of a better stamp who sought to do well by the people.\r\nUnder their auspices were set up the chartered schools, to give poor Irish\r\nchildren an industrial education. But the work of charity was marred by\r\nbigotry. The children were taken from their Catholic parents and forcibly\r\nbrought up as Protestants, whereby the heart of the Catholic parent was\r\nfilled with anguish, and more bitter offence, it seems, was given than by\r\nany other kind of repression. The schools at last became a sink of abuse,\r\ninhumanity, and corruption.\r\n\r\nRural Ireland was a recruiting ground for the armies of the Continent. On\r\nsome lonely hillside the recruiting agent reviewed the youth of the\r\nneighbourhood, picked out the strong, the flower of the population, and\r\nturned back the feeble to their miserable homes.\r\n\r\nIf anything was to be done for the extension of Protestantism, union among\r\nthe Protestant minority was indispensable, and the enthusiasm of the\r\nCalvinist, sombre as it was, might have had its attractions for the Celt,\r\nas it had for the Celts of the Scottish Highlands, among whom it gave\r\nbirth to the hill preachers, and for those of Wales with whom Calvinistic\r\nMethodism prevailed. But the bishops of the State Church hated the\r\nPresbyterian even more bitterly than they hated the Catholic. After their\r\nbrief and hollow alliance with the Nonconformists, when their own interest\r\nwas threatened, they had speedily relapsed into High Anglicanism, and\r\nunder the not unsuitable leadership of the infidel Bolingbroke had taken\r\nto persecuting Nonconformity in England. They extended the persecution to\r\nIreland, excluding by the Sacramental Test the defenders of Derry from\r\nmunicipal office and military service. They imported the Schism Act,\r\nforbidding Nonconformists to open schools. They threatened interference\r\nwith Presbyterian worship, Ireland having no Toleration Act. They disputed\r\nthe validity of Presbyterian marriage. They thus set flowing a stream of\r\nPresbyterian emigration from the north of Ireland to the American\r\ncolonies. The stream was afterwards swelled by the rapacity of Lord\r\nDonegal and other landed proprietors of Ulster, who, being owners of great\r\nestates, when the leases of their tenants ran out, instead of renewing\r\nthem to the tenant, put them up to the highest bidder. Starving Catholics,\r\nin the desperate competition for land, outbidding the Protestants, a\r\nnumber of Protestant families were driven from their homes. The\r\nconsequence was, first, aggressive insurrection under the names of the\r\nHeart of Oak Boys and the Steel Boys, ultimately emigration to America.\r\nThus the Church and the landlord between them were charging the mine of\r\nAmerican revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, too, inexorable nature made her voice heard, proclaiming that\r\nIreland, with its rich pastures and watery skies, was in the main not an\r\narable but a grazing country. There was a good market for meat.\r\nSpeculators began buying up land and throwing it into large grazing farms.\r\nThe cotter was ejected and driven to the bogs and mountains. This\r\novertaxed even a cotter's submission, and there broke out an agrarian war,\r\nthe most deadly perhaps in history, the canker and disgrace of British\r\ngovernment, protracted in varying phases and with fluctuating intensity\r\nalmost from that day to this. Companies of men, wearing white shirts over\r\ntheir clothes, and thence afterwards called Whiteboys, harried the grazing\r\nfarms by night, and the stillness of the night air was broken by the\r\nbellowings and moanings of hamstrung cattle.\r\n\r\nIrish outrage has been essentially agrarian, rather than religious. The\r\ndivision of churches coincided generally with the social division. The\r\nmiddleman was necessarily Protestant, since, under the penal law, no\r\nCatholic could acquire a beneficial lease; and the antagonism of religion\r\nand language emphasized and embittered that of class and interest. But a\r\nCatholic generally suffered like a Protestant if he provoked the wrath of\r\nthe people. A Protestant settling in a Catholic district, if he was in any\r\nway obnoxious, was especially liable to maltreatment. Later on there was a\r\nhideous instance of this in the case of a Protestant schoolmaster settling\r\nand opening his school in a Catholic district. He and his family were\r\nmangled with horrible cruelty.\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that the landlords as a class were the objects of\r\nhatred and outrage apart from the agrarian quarrel. A landlord who resided\r\nand did not oppress his tenantry, especially if he were affable, jovial,\r\nand hospitable, was generally the object of a clannish affection, though\r\nhis mansion might be a \"Castle Rack-rent\" and his serious duties might be\r\nvery indifferently performed.\r\n\r\nThe commercial restrictions and the Navigation Acts were fatal to the\r\nprosperity of the whole island, while the penal inability of the Catholics\r\nto invest could not fail to lower the value of land. This would be felt\r\nby the conquering as well as by the conquered race and sect. Scotland, cut\r\noff by the repeal of Cromwell's union from trade with England and the\r\ndependencies, had so suffered commercially and industrially that she\r\nswarmed with vagrants, and the ardent patriot, Fletcher of Saltoun,\r\nproposed slavery as a remedy for the evil. The union, opening free trade\r\nwith England, brought commercial prosperity in its train. The English in\r\nIreland stretched out their hands to the British government for a union\r\nlike that which was being made with Scotland, and were coldly repelled. To\r\nEnglish protectionism the chief blame for the refusal no doubt is due. But\r\nunwillingness to incorporate a large Catholic population may also have\r\nplayed its part. Let the cause have been what it may, there is hardly\r\nanything in the records of British statesmanship more deplorable than this\r\nrefusal of union to Ireland. Protectionism here again pleads the excuse of\r\nuniversal delusion, and in no case is the excuse more needed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Protestants of Ireland, British in blood and, as lords over\r\na subject race in their own country, more than British in pride, were\r\ndenied the enjoyment of British freedom. A Parliament they had; but that\r\nParliament could legislate only by grace of the English council and of a\r\ncouncil named by the lord lieutenant in Ireland. Its control even of money\r\nbills was not recognized, while the Crown had a hereditary revenue which\r\nmade it almost independent of Parliamentary grants. In the Upper House,\r\nowing to the large absenteeism of lay lords, the bench of bishops,\r\nnominees of the Crown and agents of the British interest, largely held\r\nsway. Of the three hundred seats in the House of Commons more than half\r\nwere filled by nominees of the patrons of pocket boroughs, which the Crown\r\nhad been always creating at its will, and the nominations were sold like\r\ncommon merchandise. The House, moreover, swarmed with placemen and\r\npensioners. The Parliament was elected for a whole reign, so as to be\r\nscarcely responsible even to such a constituency as it had. The Irish\r\nParliament of George II. continued for thirty-three years. There was a\r\nsession only in every other year. The English House of Lords arrogated to\r\nitself the jurisdiction of final appeal. The judges held only during\r\npleasure. There was no annual Mutiny Act. There was no Habeas Corpus.\r\nThere were large sinecures, instruments of corruption in the hands of the\r\ngovernment. The pension list, swollen beyond bounds, was a privy fund for\r\nkings' mistresses and for jobs too dirty for the English list. The high\r\nappointments, ecclesiastical, administrative, and judicial, were treated\r\nas patronage by the English government and generally reserved for\r\nEnglishmen. The face of their king the Irish never saw. The viceroy\r\nresided only during a small part of his term, and his place was filled in\r\nhis absence by lords justices who were often bishops, English themselves,\r\nand bent above all things on securing the ascendancy of the English\r\ninterest. Three archbishops in succession practically ruled Ireland.\r\nPresbyterians and other Protestant Dissenters, victims of episcopal\r\nintolerance, had crying wrongs of their own.\r\n\r\nUnion with England had been refused, and the protection of England being\r\nno longer so manifestly indispensable to her garrison in Ireland as it had\r\nbeen, a craving for self-government took its place. Molyneux, and after\r\nhim Lucas, alarmed and exasperated authority by writing in favour of the\r\nindependence of the Irish Parliament. But a far more potent artificer of\r\ndiscord appeared in Swift, who, balked of preferment in England by the\r\nwreck of his political party, exiled to a native land which he abhorred,\r\nwas eating his heart, and ripe for mischief, especially for any mischief\r\nwhich could avenge him on the Whig government, above all on Walpole, its\r\nchief, by whom it seems the path of this model Christian and pure writer\r\nto a bishopric had been crossed. That a feeling of justice and of pity for\r\nthe sufferings of the Irish people, which Swift has vividly described, had\r\ntheir place in his heart beside malice and vengeance, may be true; though\r\nhis sense of justice was not strong enough to prevent him, profane and\r\nreally sceptical as he was, from vehemently upholding the Penal Code and\r\nthe Sacramental Test; while his pity for the people led to no\r\nphilanthropic effort of a practical kind, and was not very tenderly\r\nexpressed in his satirical suggestion that they should appease their\r\nhunger by eating their babies. His proposal to exclude English goods would\r\ngratify his malice as well as his patriotism, and had it been adopted\r\nwould probably have led to a large increase of smuggling.\r\n\r\nOne of the grievances of Ireland was that there was no Irish mint. A new\r\ncopper coinage was needed. The contract was given by the English\r\ngovernment to the king's mistress, and by her sold to Wood, a respectable\r\nmanufacturer. As the coinage was approved by Sir Isaac Newton, then master\r\nof the mint, it can hardly have been very bad. But Irish jealousy cast\r\nsuspicion upon its character. Then rose a storm of popular fury, improved\r\nby Swift into a whirlwind on which he rode in his glory. Swift's \"Drapier\r\nLetters\" are monuments of his genius for pamphleteering, his intense\r\nmalice, and his freedom from the restraints of truth. They produced an\r\nimmense effect, made him the idol of Dublin for the rest of his days, and\r\nforced Walpole to give way and call in the halfpence. Their author did not\r\nmention among the evils of an English connection that he and the members\r\nof his State Church were enabled by the support of the British power to\r\nset their feet upon the necks of four-fifths of the Irish people and to\r\nwring from the starving Catholic the income of the dean of St. Patrick.\r\nThe letters ranged far beyond the immediate occasion, and appealed\r\nstrongly to the growing desire of independence, which we may be pretty\r\nsure that Swift, had he been nominated by Bolingbroke to an English\r\nbishopric, would have fiercely opposed. The Parliament to which his\r\nrevolution would have consigned Ireland is described by himself as a den\r\nof thieves of which he devoutly desired the extirpation.\r\n\r\nPresently there arose a patriot party in the Irish Parliament. It found a\r\nleader in Flood, a man of solid ability and powerful in debate, while the\r\npurity of his patriotism was not so clear. At Flood's side, or rather\r\nperhaps, as the event proved, on his flank, there presently arose the far\r\nmore illustrious Grattan, whose purity and patriotism were unquestionable,\r\nwhose oratory was brilliant, his admirers thought divine. The objects\r\nsought by the patriots were reduction of the duration of Parliaments,\r\ncontrol of money bills, an annual Mutiny Bill, Habeas Corpus, tenure of\r\nthe judges during life or good behaviour, reduction of the pension list,\r\nexclusion of placemen and pensioners from the House of Commons, taxation\r\nof the rents of absentees. On the first and most important point they\r\nsucceeded through a bargain with the Crown on the amount of the military\r\nforce. The duration of Parliament was cut down to eight years, that number\r\nbeing preferred to seven, because it was only in alternate years that\r\nParliament sat. This was a very important change. War, with imperfect\r\nsuccess, was waged on the question of money bills. On the other points\r\nreform made no way, the English government clinging obstinately to all its\r\npowers and using its veto, while the lord lieutenant was able to avert a\r\ncrash by buying up a majority in the Irish Parliament. Taxation of the\r\nrents of absentees, a measure very popular and much pressed, was vetoed\r\nby the English government. The protest of the absentees against it was\r\nevidently the work of Burke, whose patron, Lord Rockingham, had an estate\r\nin Ireland. Burke argued that the double land-ownership was a link of\r\nunion between the two countries; which it might have been if the residence\r\nas well as the proprietorship had been shared. The advocates of the tax\r\nmight have cited the original character of land grants to which feudal\r\nservice was annexed and which were forfeited by the failure of absentees\r\nto perform it. Chatham supported the tax. For a moment, unhappily for a\r\nmoment only, his thoughts were turned to Ireland. A far greater service he\r\nwould have rendered his country by pacifying Ireland as he pacified the\r\nHighlands than by his conquest of Canada, of which the loss of the\r\nAmerican colonies was the result. In the background there was a growing\r\nsentiment in favour of independence, the flag of which was by Grattan\r\npresently unfurled.\r\n\r\nIt was not in Ireland as it was in England, where the regular party system\r\nprevailed and the minority changed with the majority in Parliament. The\r\nCastle called to the council whom it pleased, without regard to the\r\nexistence of a political connection among them, though it was, of course,\r\nunder the necessity of calling those who could bring it support at the\r\ntime. The party tie was accordingly very loose and connections were\r\nshifting. Flood had no scruple in providing for himself, apart from his\r\nfriends, by acceptance of a rich sinecure under the government. Hely\r\nHutchinson, a free lance, could use his personal influence in forcing the\r\ngovernment to make him provost of Trinity College.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Castle put itself into the hands of a junto of great lords\r\nand owners of Parliamentary boroughs, who undertook to supply it with a\r\nmajority at the price of patronage and power. To break this ring and\r\nrestore the free action of government, an effort was made by the Lord\r\nLieutenant Townshend. But Townshend's boisterous energy, successful for a\r\ntime, in the end failed, and the Castle fell back into the routine of\r\ngovernment by intrigue and corruption, aided by viceregal dinners and\r\nballs.\r\n\r\nChatham's glory dazzled Ireland as well as England. But presently came the\r\nquarrel ending in war, with the American colonies, whose commercial\r\ngrievances were the same in kind as those of Ireland, practically less\r\nsevere. Ireland at once showed sympathy with American revolt. Presently\r\nthe island was divested of troops by the demands of the war, and its\r\ncoasts were left open to the attacks of privateers. There was no national\r\nmilitia. Under the leadership of Lord Charlemont a body of volunteers,\r\nalmost entirely Protestant, was raised and reached at last the number of\r\nforty thousand. There was, no doubt, in the movement a good deal of claret\r\nand fanfaronade. But it included the leading gentry, and for its purpose\r\nwas very strong. Formed ostensibly, at first really, for defence against\r\nthe Americans, it presently fell politically into their track and demanded\r\nof the British government, now prostrated by misfortune in the war and by\r\nthe combination of European powers against it, first freedom from the\r\ncommercial restrictions, then legislative independence. North made\r\ncommercial concessions; he would have made them on a much more liberal\r\nscale and possibly have satisfied the volunteers. But again monopolist\r\ngreed, strong in the commercial cities of England, vetoed, and Burke lost\r\nhis seat at Bristol for advocating the policy of free trade. The victories\r\nof Rodney and Eliot, had they come in time, might have strengthened the\r\nhands of the British government and saved it from an ignominious\r\ncapitulation. As it was, the British government surrendered at discretion.\r\nFirst the commercial restrictions were swept away; then the legislative\r\nsupremacy of England, embodied in the Poynings Act and the Act of the\r\nSixth of George I., affirming the right of the British Parliament to\r\nlegislate for Ireland, was renounced. Flood, the patriot with a bend\r\nsinister, insisted on pushing the humiliation of England still further and\r\ncompelling her by a declaratory act solemnly to bind her own hands for the\r\nfuture, while Grattan, the patriot without reproach, took the more\r\ngenerous line. Thus England underwent the deepest humiliation in her\r\nhistory at the hands of an Irish party which owed its land, its\r\nascendancy, probably its very existence, to her protecting power. Such was\r\nthe condign punishment of a long course of ignorant, blundering, and\r\ncorrupt misgovernment, a punishment not the less calamitous and degrading\r\nbecause it was deserved.\r\n\r\nSo Grattan in the Irish Parliament was able, in a transport of rhetorical\r\nrapture, to worship \"the newborn nation,\" a nation which comprised a\r\nfraction of the people of the country, the rest being still political\r\nhelots. Had he adored an uncontrolled Ascendancy, his deity would have\r\nbeen real.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers, having felt their strength, were inclined to vote\r\nthemselves permanent, overawe Parliament, and enforce Parliamentary\r\nreform. Flood was so misguided as to take that line. But the incarnation\r\nof violent counsels was the bishop of Derry, an English nobleman holding\r\nan Irish bishopric, a most absurd figure, and probably half insane. His\r\nRight Reverence avowed that he looked forward to blood. He paraded before\r\nthe door of Parliament in a coach and six, dressed in purple with long\r\nwhite gloves and gold tassels depending from them, and with a guard of\r\nhorse, looking as if he meant to be king. But the Parliament was firm, and\r\nLord Charlemont and other sane leaders were able to control the body,\r\nwhich was drawn, not from a Faubourg St. Antoine, but from the\r\nproperty-owning class under aristocratic leading. Still revolutionary\r\nexcitement did not die.\r\n\r\nWhat was now the state of things? There were two independent Parliaments,\r\neach with full powers of legislation, under the same Crown; that Crown not\r\nbeing invested with authority to control and harmonize the action of the\r\ntwo Parliaments, but being a Crown upon a cushion or little more. The\r\ncommercial and even the international relations of the two Parliaments\r\nmight point different ways. There might be a divergence on a question of\r\npeace or war; one Parliament declaring for war, the other refusing to vote\r\nthe supplies. On general questions, such as commercial and criminal law,\r\nopposition was possible to any extent; and considering the feelings\r\ntowards each other with which the partners set out, was not unlikely to\r\noccur. Ireland might even refuse currency to English coin. The monarchical\r\nlink itself was not quite firm. On the question of the regency, when\r\nGeorge III. went mad, the two Parliaments did actually fly apart; the\r\nIrish Parliament recognizing, while the British Parliament refused to\r\nrecognize, the claim of the Prince of Wales to the regency by virtue of\r\nhis birth. Only the king's recovery averted a collision. Adopted in haste\r\nand in a rush of revolutionary ardour, the system was in fact unworkable\r\nand must have ended in confusion. Grattan was unquestionably true to\r\nBritish connection. But Grattan was not Ireland, and even he had led in no\r\nvery loyal attitude the defiance of the British Parliament on the regency\r\nquestion. His statesmanship can hardly have been profound if he fancied\r\nthat the constitution of 1782 would work.\r\n\r\nIt is moreover always to be borne in mind that this Parliament was the\r\nParliament of a Protestant ascendancy, representing not one-quarter of the\r\npeople of Ireland, and that with all its high talk of independence, it\r\nstill owed, and knew that it owed, to British protection its power, its\r\nprivileges, its political pelf, perhaps even the safe possession under the\r\nAct of Settlement of lands on which the disinherited still cast a longing\r\nand vindictive eye.\r\n\r\nHow then was the policy of Ireland to be kept from breaking away from that\r\nof Great Britain? The practical answer was, by corruption, the means of\r\nwhich at the command of the Castle were, besides office, sinecures, some\r\nof them very rich; commands in the army; pensions; bishoprics, with other\r\nChurch patronage; and peerages. The peerages, though lavishly created,\r\nseem to have retained their value. The Parliament, the body on which\r\ncorruption had to operate, was a Parliament of rotten boroughs, the\r\nnominations for which were sold in open market. The House of Commons\r\ncontinued to swarm with placemen and pensioners, whose votes were at the\r\ncommand of government. In the House of Lords the Anglican bishops were\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nAppended to a report made to Pitt on the political situation in Ireland is\r\nthe following schedule of corruption:--\r\n\r\n     \"H---- H----, son-in-law to Lord A----, and brought into Parliament\r\n     by him. Studies the law; wishes to be a commissioner of barracks, or\r\n     in some similar place. Would go into orders and take a living.\r\n\r\n     \"H---- D----, brother to Lord C----. Applied for office; but, as no\r\n     specific promise could be made, has lately voted in opposition. Easy\r\n     to be had if thought expedient. A silent, gloomy man.\r\n\r\n     \"L---- M----, refuses to accept L500 per annum; states very high\r\n     pretensions from his skill in House of Commons management; expects\r\n     L1,000 per annum. N.B.-- Be careful of him.\r\n\r\n     \"J---- N----, has been in the army and is now on half pay; wishes a\r\n     troop of dragoons on full pay. States his pretensions to be fifteen\r\n     years' service in Parliament. N.B.--Would prefer office to military\r\n     promotion; but already has, and has long had, a pension. Character,\r\n     especially on the side of truth, not favourable.\r\n\r\n     \"R---- P----, independent, but well disposed to government. His four\r\n     sisters have pensions; and his object is a living for his brother.\r\n\r\n     \"T---- P----, brother to Lord L----, and brought in by him. A captain\r\n     in the navy; wishes for some sinecure employment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no lack, say apologists of the Irish Parliament, of useful\r\nlegislation on subjects with which a landed gentry was qualified to deal.\r\nThere was a fatal lack of legislation on one momentous subject with which\r\na land-owning gentry ought to be qualified to deal, but from which the\r\nIrish Parliament resolutely turned its eyes. For half a century before the\r\nunion, that body steadfastly abstained from inquiring into the causes of\r\ndisaffection among the peasantry. It even repressed a report upon the\r\nsubject which the chairman of the committee had begun to read.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the peasantry was still horrible and heartrending. The\r\nrevolution of 1782, by loosening the fetters of trade, had brought\r\nincrease of prosperity to the merchant and manufacturer. It had brought no\r\nrelief to the tiller of the soil. A little before this Arthur Young had\r\ntravelled in Ireland and had been shocked at seeing the insolent despotism\r\nof the petty country gentlemen, whom he called the vermin of the kingdom,\r\nover their serfs; the horsewhip freely used, the serf not daring to lift\r\nhis hand in defence, the total denial of legal redress, since a justice of\r\nthe peace presuming to issue a summons would at once have been called out.\r\nLandlords of consequence had assured Young that many of their cotters\r\nwould think themselves honoured by having their wives and daughters sent\r\nfor to the bed of their masters. He had even heard of the lives of people\r\nbeing made free with. The middleman and the tithe-proctor were ruthless as\r\never. To the payment of tithes a drop of bitterness had been added by the\r\nexemption, through an abuse of political influence, of the grazing farms,\r\nwhich left the whole burden of maintaining a hostile Church on the back of\r\nthe cotter. The peasantry, on the other hand, maddened by suffering, took\r\na fearful revenge on the oppressor or his agents. Agrarian murder and\r\noutrage prevailed. There were cruelties worse than murder. Middlemen and\r\ntithe-proctors were \"carded\"; that is, lacerated with boards full of nails\r\ndrawn down their backs, buried up to their necks in pits full of thorns,\r\nmade to ride on saddles stuck with spikes, their ears and noses cut off. A\r\nclergyman was met riding in great agony with his head wrapped up; his ears\r\nand cheeks were found nailed to a post. That the Irish when excited are\r\ncapable of dark atrocities is a feature of their character which it is\r\nuseless to disguise. Debility when excited is apt to be most cruel. The\r\ntrait showed itself plainly in the hamstringing of soldiers and the\r\nhoughing of cattle, as well as in the torturing of middlemen and\r\ntithe-proctors. Law and police were paralyzed. The peasantry were one vast\r\nconspiracy bound together by awful pledges, the betrayal of which was\r\ndeath. No evidence could be obtained though there might be plenty of\r\neye-witnesses. Perjury in the common cause was no sin.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that the Whiteboys had their meetings in Catholic chapels.\r\nBut there is no ground for taxing the Catholic Church as a body with any\r\nshare in the criminal part of the movement. The Catholic clergy of Ireland\r\nwere then, as they are now, a peasant clergy, sympathizing with their\r\nclass. They depended on that class for their stipends. Some of them their\r\nsympathy might betray into complicity, more or less active, with agrarian\r\ncrime. More of them might be guilty of failure to exert their religious\r\nauthority as ministers of the sacraments, the confessional, and death-bed\r\nabsolution, on the side of law. But their record on the whole appears to\r\nhave been as clear as, considering what persecution they had undergone,\r\nand that the law was their enemy as well as the enemy of the peasant, it\r\nwas reasonable to expect.\r\n\r\nThe mansion of an unpopular landlord became a besieged fortress.\r\nAbsenteeism of course increased. To a rather later date belongs the story\r\nof an agent who, having complained to his absentee landlord that his life\r\nhad been threatened, received the reply, \"Tell the villains that they need\r\nnot hope to intimidate me by shooting you.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I am well acquainted,\" said a statesman not oversensitive to popular\r\n     wrongs, \"with the Province of Munster, and I know that it is\r\n     impossible for human wretchedness to exceed that of the miserable\r\n     tenantry of that province. I know that the unhappy tenantry are\r\n     ground to powder by relentless landlords. I know that far from being\r\n     able to give the clergy their just dues, they have not food and\r\n     raiment for themselves; the landlord grasps the whole. Sorry I am to\r\n     add that, unsatisfied with present extortion, some landlords have\r\n     been so base as to instigate the insurgents to rob the clergy of\r\n     their tithes, not in order to alleviate the distresses of the\r\n     tenantry, but that they might add the clergy's share to the cruel\r\n     rack-rents already paid. Sir, I fear it will require the utmost\r\n     ability of Parliament to come to the root of these evils. The poor\r\n     people of Munster live in a more abject state of poverty than human\r\n     nature can be supposed able to bear. Their miseries are intolerable;\r\n     but they do not originate with the clergy; nor can the legislature\r\n     stand by and see them take the redress into their own hands. Nothing\r\n     can be done for their benefit while the country remains in a state of\r\n     anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nThe miseries might not originate with the clergy, but the popular wrath\r\ndid originate specially with the exactions of the tithe-proctor. Grattan\r\nproposed commutation. But then the tithe of pasture agistment, as it was\r\ncalled, could no longer have been evaded. That simple reform was put off\r\nfor more than a generation, with the most calamitous results.\r\n\r\nDublin was gay, mansions rose, claret flowed, wit sparkled, the dance went\r\nround. Nor was there lack of social polish or of culture of the classical\r\nkind. On the other hand, there were extravagance, waste, and debt. Wild\r\nand spendthrift characters appear among the leaders and mirrors of\r\nsociety. Beauchamp Bagenal, as Sir Jonah Barrington tells us, \"had visited\r\nevery capital of Europe, and had exhibited the native original character\r\nof the Irish gentleman at every place he visited. In the splendour of his\r\ntravelling establishment, he quite eclipsed the petty potentates with whom\r\nGermany was garnished. His person was fine, his manners open and generous,\r\nhis spirit high, and his liberality profuse. During his tour, he had\r\nperformed a variety of feats which were emblazoned in Ireland, and\r\nendeared him to his countrymen. He had fought a prince; jilted a princess;\r\nintoxicated the doge of Venice; carried off a duchess from Madrid; scaled\r\nthe walls of a convent in Italy; narrowly escaped the Inquisition at\r\nLisbon; concluded his exploits by a celebrated fencing match at Paris; and\r\nhe returned to Ireland with a sovereign contempt for all continental men\r\nand manners, and an inveterate antipathy to all despotic kings and\r\narbitrary governments.\"\r\n\r\nDuelling was the social law. The attorney-general fought a duel; the\r\nprovost of Trinity College fought a duel. Refusal of a challenge was\r\nsocial death. The viceroy's secretary, when challenged by a disappointed\r\napplicant for place, deemed it necessary to go to the field of honour.\r\nRobert Fitzgerald was so addicted to duelling that he wore a chain shirt\r\nunder his vest.\r\n\r\nWhat can have produced such characters? Was it anything in Irish blood or\r\nair, or was it the absence of the commercial element with its sobering\r\ninfluence? The story of Robert Fitzgerald, nephew of the bishop of Derry,\r\nseems to bespeak a wild domestic despotism exercised by the squires.\r\nFitzgerald is said to have confined his father in a cave with a muzzled\r\nbear. He put to death one of his household, for which, however, he was\r\nhanged. The matrimonial adventurer from Ireland was also a figure well\r\nknown in the sister isle.\r\n\r\nOf intellectual fruit there was not much except oratory, pamphlets, and\r\npasquinades. Swift was an Englishman born in Ireland and banished to the\r\nplace of his birth. Burke's genius as well as his physiognomy was one-half\r\nIrish, and his Irish half had its share in that splendid but mischievous\r\noutburst, his essay on the French Revolution. His heart turned to Ireland,\r\nand some of his best thought was given to her case. But he hardly belongs\r\nto the Irish Pantheon.\r\n\r\nOratory, both Parliamentary and forensic, flourished. Grattan, Flood,\r\nYelverton, Foster, Fitzgibbon (afterwards Lord Clare), Curran, are great\r\nnames in their different ways. Nor was the oratory all in the style\r\nsupposed to be Hibernian. Foster's style, for example, was grave and\r\nweighty. So generally was that of Flood.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament there were lively scenes. Grattan and Flood having parted\r\ncompany in politics, and Flood having defamed Grattan, Grattan poured upon\r\nFlood a furious torrent of the most personal invective; telling him that\r\nhis talents were not so great as his life was infamous; that he had been\r\nsilent for years and silent for money; that he might be seen passing the\r\ndoors like a guilty spirit waiting the moment at which he might hop in and\r\ngive his venal vote; that he was a kettledrum, battering himself into\r\npopularity to catch the vulgar; that he might be seen hovering over the\r\ndome like an ill-omened bird of night, with sepulchral note and broken\r\nbeak (Flood having a broken nose); and winding up by telling him in the\r\nface of the country, before all the world, and to his beard, that he was\r\nnot an honest man. Flood retorted with equal fury, and a wild scene\r\nensued. It is not difficult to believe in the genius or the patriotism of\r\nthese orators; but it is difficult to believe in their unimpassioned\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nThe Penal Code had ere this lost much of its cruelty. Time, security, and\r\nintercourse had softened the feeling of the Protestants against the\r\nCatholics, whose passive loyalty had been proved by their inaction when\r\nGreat Britain was twice invaded by Stuart pretenders. The most odious\r\nenactments of the code, those which involved personal degradation and\r\noutrage on family affection, had fallen into desuetude or been evaded.\r\nProtestant friends would hold land for a Catholic in confidential trust,\r\nand ostensibly assume the guardianship of his children, leaving the real\r\nguardianship to the kin. The attempts of informers to take advantage of\r\nforfeitures were discouraged by the courts. Protestant fanaticism was\r\ndying out everywhere except in rural Ulster, and was giving way among the\r\neducated to indifference and even to scepticism. The spirit of Voltaire\r\nwas abroad. Chesterfield, as viceroy, brought it with him, laughing at\r\nreligious intolerance, and saying that the only Catholic of whom he was\r\nafraid was the reigning beauty of Dublin. The whole system of the Catholic\r\nChurch, though still nominally subsisting only by connivance, was openly\r\nand securely carried on. Conspicuous Mass houses were built. The Catholic\r\nhierarchy and priesthood were forming friendly relations with a government\r\nwhich had once designated all Catholics as enemies. Catholics of the upper\r\nclass educated in France came back from the land of the Encyclopaedists\r\ntinctured with its liberalism. Catholics were admitted by connivance into\r\nTrinity College. A central committee had been formed to guard Catholic\r\ninterests, which in the penal era would have been treason. After 1782,\r\nrelief bills were passed. Catholicism was recognized by law. All\r\nrestrictions upon the maintenance of the hierarchy, freedom of ordination,\r\nor additions to the priesthood were abrogated. Catholics were made capable\r\nof acquiring property in land, though under the guise of leases for nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine years. The Gavelling Act, passed to break up\r\ntheir estates, was repealed. It was unfortunately too late to restore the\r\nCatholic gentry, which had been decimated by the Penal Law. In 1783 a bill\r\nwas passed opening to Catholics the profession of the law in all its\r\nbranches and grades except the rank of king's counsel and the judicial\r\nbench, repealing the law against the intermarriage of Catholics with\r\nProtestants, that against foreign emigration, that making an Anglican\r\nlicense necessary for schools, and that restricting the number of\r\napprentices permitted in Catholic trade. The laws against the possession\r\nof arms and the exclusion from command in the army were left. Otherwise of\r\nthe Penal Code the political disabilities almost alone remained.\r\n\r\nThe principal relief bill was introduced by Sir Hercules Langrishe, the\r\nfriend and correspondent on Irish politics of Burke, who pleaded the cause\r\nof the Irish Catholics with all the vehemence of his nature, a measure of\r\nsympathy with the religion probably mingling in his heart with love of\r\nfreedom and justice. Burke had less feeling for the grievances of\r\nProtestant Dissenters or of Anglican clergymen liberally inclined, who\r\nsought the relaxation of tests. He afterwards sent his son, whose ability\r\nhe fondly overrated, as his representative to Ireland, in the affairs of\r\nwhich the aspiring youth meddled, and with farcical results.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterians of Belfast had before this been relieved of the Test Act\r\nand their other religious bonds and humiliations. But the relief had come\r\ntoo late to turn them into good friends of the Anglican Church or of\r\nBritish connection. Revolutionary and republican sentiment had, with\r\nreligious scepticism, taken root in Belfast.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1782 had not been democratic. The Volunteers were\r\nproperty holders and their leaders were peers. But the withdrawal of the\r\nVolunteers was not followed by political calm. Among the populace of\r\nDublin, especially, excitement continued and showed itself detestably by\r\nhamstringing British soldiers. The cry was now for two drastic measures of\r\nchange: the political emancipation of the Catholics, and a reform of\r\nParliament substituting freedom of election for nomination and clearing\r\nthe legislature of pensioners and placemen. The two combined evidently\r\nmeant death to Protestant ascendancy and to oligarchy, both of which\r\nnaturally shrank from suicide.\r\n\r\nThe struggle grew fierce, and now not only was the American Revolution\r\nfresh in recollection, but the French Revolution, advancing with thunder\r\ntread, was filling the minds of the people everywhere, and especially\r\nthose of the oppressed and suffering, with vague visions and hopes of\r\nchange. Even to the hovel of the Irish serf, a vague hope, not of a\r\nsociety regenerated on the principles of Rousseau, but of deliverance from\r\nthe middleman, from the tithe-proctor, and from the English connection,\r\nwhich he thought was at the bottom of all his sufferings, had begun to\r\nmake its way.\r\n\r\nOf reform, the leader was Grattan. Opposition to reform found a mighty\r\nchampion in Fitzgibbon, afterwards Lord Clare, a strong man, fearless as\r\nhe was able, and a very powerful speaker, but violent and overbearing, as\r\nwell as reactionary to a degree which charms the reactionary historian.\r\nFitzgibbon had a very coarse but rather effective shield-bearer in Dr.\r\nDuigenan, the son of a Catholic farmer intended for the priesthood, but\r\ncaptured by the Protestant clergyman of his parish.\r\n\r\nGrattan and the reform party failed to get admission for Catholics to\r\nParliament. They failed to purify the House itself by substituting free\r\nelection for nomination boroughs, or by the effective exclusion of\r\npensioners and placemen from the House. They succeeded in extending the\r\nelectoral franchise to all holders, whether Catholic or Protestant, of\r\nforty-shilling freeholds. Unfortunately, they could hardly have done worse\r\nthan by giving political power to the mass without its natural leaders.\r\nProtestant demagogues playing for the Catholic vote were certain to\r\nappear. Another bad effect of the measure was the multiplication of cotter\r\nholdings by land-owners who would absolutely control the cotter's vote. On\r\nthe other hand, to ask the Protestant oligarchy to part with its exclusive\r\npossession of Parliament was to ask it, not only to resign power, but even\r\nto cast a shadow on its property, for the Act of Settlement had hardly\r\neven yet become perfectly sacred as the title-deed of proprietary right.\r\nNot all the advocates of Parliamentary reform were in favour of Catholic\r\nemancipation. Flood among others was opposed to it.\r\n\r\nOf the British government Pitt was now absolute master. Early in his reign\r\nhe had glanced at Irish politics and it seems had thought of union. But\r\nthe Channel was still wide and Irish government was still left to the\r\nCastle. Pitt, however, had tendered Ireland a commercial agreement framed,\r\nlike his commercial treaty with France, in the spirit of the first\r\nstatesman who read Adam Smith. Introduced by him with great ability and at\r\nfirst with general acceptance, his measure in the end was wrecked by a\r\ncombination of British protectionism, Whig faction, and Irish jealousy on\r\nthe subject of legislative independence; to the last of which Fox, carried\r\naway by faction, scrupled not to appeal. Commercial union would have\r\nstrengthened the political connection, and by furthering commercial\r\nprosperity might have done something to allay Irish discontent. Latterly,\r\nPitt's thoughts had been engrossed by the struggle with France. They were\r\nnow turned perforce to the political state of Ireland, which was evidently\r\nbecoming very perilous; at that time, unfortunately, with no happy result.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs opposed to the French Revolution, Portland, Spencer,\r\nFitzwilliam, and Windham, had coalesced with Pitt without renouncing their\r\ngeneral principles, which they wished to apply to Ireland, regarding that\r\nfield, it seems, as especially their own. At their instance Fitzwilliam\r\nwas sent over as viceroy, believing, and it seems with reason, that he\r\nbore Catholic emancipation and general reform in his hand; though he had\r\nno written instructions, nor, it appears, any verbal instructions\r\nsufficiently clear. He went hastily to work, opened his budget of\r\nconcessions prematurely, and too promptly brandished the besom of\r\nadministrative reform, dismissing from office one of the great\r\nplace-hunting house of Beresford, which by assiduous intrigue had filled\r\nthe public service with its nominees. The Beresford carried his plaint to\r\nthe headquarters of the Tory party in London, and told Pitt that\r\nFitzwilliam was turning out all the faithful supporters of the government.\r\nWhat followed is still a mystery. There was a long, unaccountable, and\r\napparently inexcusable silence on the part of Portland, broken at last by\r\ndisclaimer, rebuke, and recall. Fitzwilliam, stung to fury at this\r\ntreatment, trampled on official rules and did serious mischief by his\r\npublication of confidential letters betraying an incipient design of\r\nunion, which to Irish patriotism at that time was maddening. At the bottom\r\nof all the misunderstanding and trouble was the king, into whose miserable\r\nmind had been instilled, it appears by Fitzgibbon, the belief that by\r\nconsenting to Catholic emancipation he would break his coronation oath.\r\nThe two great Tory lawyers, Eldon and Kenyon, to their honour, told the\r\nking the truth. It seems probable, however, that the union of the\r\ncoalition government was imperfect, as that of coalition governments is\r\napt to be, and that this may be the account both of the want of clearness\r\nin Fitzwilliam's original instructions and of the strange silence, ending\r\nat last in an abrupt dismissal, which ensued.\r\n\r\nFitzwilliam left Dublin amidst passionate demonstrations of popular\r\ndisappointment and grief. His place was taken by Lord Camden, one of the\r\nTory section of the Pitt government, who came to face Irish rebellion\r\naided by Revolutionary France, while England, placed in extreme peril by\r\nFrench victories and the secession of her allies, was struggling for her\r\nlife and was unable to afford military support to the government of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nCatholic emancipation and reform of Parliament, had Fitzwilliam been\r\nallowed to grant them, would, Grattan thought, have averted the crisis.\r\nThey might have staved it off, but it would probably have come in another\r\nform. That the new power thus called into being would be as loyal as\r\nGrattan himself to British connection was a highly precarious assumption.\r\nThe course of the French Revolution would have not been stayed, nor would\r\nthe wild hopes which it excited have been extinguished. The aspirations of\r\nTom Paine's disciples at Belfast would not have ceased. The cotter's\r\nhunger would not have been appeased nor would he have been reconciled to\r\nthe payment of tithe and Church cess. The blind hatred of British\r\nconnection as the supposed source of all evil to Ireland would have\r\ncontinued to work. The State Church would at once have been attacked. The\r\nCastle government, bereft of its two supports, nomination boroughs and\r\npatronage, would inevitably have lost its hold. Chaos would then have\r\ncome. Material order might have been preserved by a sufficient military\r\nforce. Otherwise there was apparently nothing for it but union.\r\n\r\nIn Presbyterian Belfast, hatred of the State Church and the English\r\ngovernment which supported it, bred by Episcopal intolerance, had\r\ndeveloped, especially among the young men, into rationalism and acceptance\r\nof the doctrines, both religious and political, of Tom Paine. The\r\nconnection of sympathy with the exiles in America had been kept up, and\r\nthe spirit of the American was combined with that of the French\r\nRevolution. Thus was formed the circle of United Irishmen. The professed\r\naim of this association, perhaps originally its real aim, was only the\r\nreform of Parliament. But it soon became revolutionary, aiming at\r\nindependence of England and the foundation of an Irish republic, to be\r\nbrought about by the aid of revolutionary France. Its soul was Wolfe Tone,\r\na young man of talent, literary and practical, and of generous instincts,\r\nwild, dissipated, recklessly adventurous, burning with hatred of England.\r\nOther leading members of the circle were Jackson and Emmett. Most of the\r\nset were plebeian. But there was one recruit from the aristocracy, Lord\r\nEdward Fitzgerald, son of the Duke of Leinster, fired, like Lafayette,\r\nwith the enthusiasm of liberty, but distinguished and made an object of\r\nsentimental interest only by his rank and by his tragical end.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak was now imminent. Grattan, with his few steadfast adherents,\r\nseceded from Parliament, where he had better have stayed to moderate as\r\nfar as he could the fury of repression. This he owed to the country on\r\nwhich he had imposed the constitution of 1782, a system fraught, as he\r\nmight have seen, with disruption and capable of being worked only as it\r\nhad been worked, by Castle influence. The bond of loyalty to England,\r\nwhich was strong in his own breast, he assumed to be general. Neither he\r\nnor, with reverence be it said, Burke, excellent as the general principles\r\nof both might be, correctly read the situation, which was one of a very\r\nspecial kind. Burke's letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe on the subject of\r\nreligious emancipation is accounted one of the greatest of his works. But\r\nFitzgibbon might with reason have replied to it that of the real Irish\r\nproblem it offered no practical solution. It did not show how a national\r\nParliament of Ireland, with a great Catholic majority, and uncontrolled by\r\nCastle patronage and influence, to which reform would have put an end,\r\ncould be kept in secure harmony with the Parliament of Great Britain.\r\nBurke, however, now and then, glances timidly at the policy of union.\r\nGrattan could think of nothing but his two Parliaments linked by eternal\r\naffection. After Grattan's secession, the oligarchy closed its ranks, and\r\nthe Parliament thenceforth went thoroughly with the government, or even\r\nbeyond it, in the policy of repression.\r\n\r\nThe Castle understood its danger. In Irish conspiracies the informer is\r\nnever lacking. Besides, there were Catholics, who though patriots, wishing\r\nto avert civil war, communicated with the government, and furnished it\r\nwith information for that purpose. Among these may fairly be numbered\r\nArthur O'Leary, on whose connection with the government and acceptance of\r\na small pension from it, lately revealed, prejudice pounces as a proof\r\nthat the best reputed and most eminent of Irish Liberals was a rogue.\r\nArthur O'Leary wrote well, and the spirit of his writings was thoroughly\r\nliberal as well as loyal. Nothing seems to have been expected of him\r\nbeyond general information of Catholic tendencies and movements such as\r\none who desired to avert civil war might honestly give. By its secret\r\nintelligence the government was enabled at a critical moment to seize some\r\nof the leaders of the conspiracy, while Lord Edward Fitzgerald met his\r\ndeath in resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nThe fire, smouldering everywhere, burst into a flame in Armagh, a\r\nProtestant district into which Catholics had intruded by outbidding\r\nProtestant holders of farms whose leases had expired. The Protestants,\r\nbanding together under the name of Peep o'Day Boys, proceeded to oust the\r\nintruders, burning some of their houses. The Catholics combined for mutual\r\nprotection under the name of Defenders. Outrages were committed on both\r\nsides. In a pitched battle, on a small scale, called the battle of the\r\nDiamond, the Catholics were worsted and a number of them were killed. Many\r\nCatholics were driven from their homes, and the fugitives spread through\r\nthe country the belief that the Protestants were bent on extermination.\r\n\r\nThe United Irishmen, disciples of Tom Paine, cared nothing for the\r\nquarrels of sects. But disaffection of any kind was grist to their\r\nrevolutionary mill. They coalesced with Defenderism, and by superior\r\nintelligence got control of the movement, which they organized as an\r\nexpectant army of revolution. Their task was made easy by the habits of\r\nconspiracy formed among the peasantry in the agrarian war. There were\r\nsecret oaths, passwords, military gradations of command. There were even\r\nreviews under pretence of digging the potatoes of patriots who were in\r\nprison. Everything was ready for a rising as soon as French succour should\r\nappear. All the blacksmiths were making pike-heads, the young trees were\r\nbeing everywhere cut down for the shafts. Muskets in plenty would come\r\nwith the auxiliary army from France. Wolfe Tone had visited Paris, of\r\nwhich in its revolutionary phase he gives a lively picture, and received a\r\npromise of aid; Hoche, with whom he had an interview, being eager for the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nAmong the people generally the rebellion was agrarian rather than\r\nreligious, religious only as the Catholic peasantry believed that they saw\r\nin Protestantism a badge of general enmity. But that belief made the war\r\nbetween the sects internecine. It does not appear that any but a few of\r\nthe lowest and coarsest of the priesthood took an active part in the\r\nrebellion. The order, as a whole, could hardly look with pleasure for the\r\nconquest of Ireland by an atheist revolution. The French, in fact, had\r\nthey become masters of Ireland for a time, would probably in the end have\r\nfound themselves there, as in Spain, confronted by a hostile priesthood\r\ncarrying with it the people.\r\n\r\nIn the extremity of danger, surrounded by gathering rebellion, Castle\r\ngovernment had now to strike or fall. It struck, practically proclaiming\r\nmartial law. But it was without the only safe means of military\r\nrepression. Of regular soldiers it had few. Those few behaved well. Some\r\nof them earned by their conduct the blessings of the people. But in the\r\nmain repression had to be entrusted to yeomanry and fencibles, little\r\ncontrolled by discipline, and infected, as a militia is always apt to be,\r\nand as in this case they were in an extreme degree, by the passions of the\r\nhour. These men, sent forth to disarm the people, in their search for\r\nconcealed arms burned, slew, pitch-capped, flogged without stint or mercy,\r\nand turned a great district of the north and midland into a hell. The\r\npeople retaliated with equal atrocity where they had the power. A large\r\nnumber of suspects were arbitrarily shipped on board the fleet, where it\r\nwas believed they helped by their infection to beget the mutiny at the\r\nNore. Lord Moira, a patriot Irish nobleman, protested vehemently in the\r\nHouse of Lords, but his exaggeration and partiality broke the force of his\r\nappeal. To control the excesses of repression and restore military\r\ndiscipline, the gallant Abercrombie was put in command; but he lost his\r\nself-control, reviled the troops in an imprudent manifesto, broke with the\r\ngovernment, and left matters worse than they had been before.\r\n\r\nIn Ulster, fraternities of strong Protestants, which had existed\r\ninformally since 1689, were now formally organized as Orange Lodges. They\r\nembodied an intensely sectarian feeling and committed their share of\r\noutrages, but they lent the government powerful aid.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the ruthless agents of repression was the head of the\r\nBeresfords, whose riding-house at Dublin was a daily scene of torture.\r\nConspicuous also was Judkin Fitzgerald, the field of whose operations was\r\nTipperary. Fitzgerald's apologists plead that his policy was successful.\r\nIt might be so, but the cause of public order does not gain in the end by\r\noutraging that law of natural justice on respect for which public order\r\nmust ultimately depend. Fitzgerald, savagely flogging a man on whom he had\r\nfound a note in the French language, which not knowing French himself he\r\ncould not read, was presently assured by one who could read the note that\r\nit was perfectly harmless. He nevertheless continued the torture of the\r\nlash till the victim nearly expired. Such a case seems to defy apology.\r\nFitzgerald, however, was not only protected from question by an Act of\r\nIndemnity, but rewarded with a title. On both sides all hearts were fired\r\nwith the satanic madness of civil war.\r\n\r\nFrench aid had been promised. To the unspeakable discredit of the British\r\nadmiralty, it came. An expedition which had long been in preparation under\r\nHoche was allowed to sail from Brest and unopposed to make the coast of\r\nIreland at Bantry Bay. A storm which prevented a landing, the bad\r\nseamanship of the French, whose naval service had been shattered by the\r\nrevolution, and the separation of the frigate which had the general on\r\nboard from the rest of the fleet, saved Ireland from temporary conquest\r\nand Great Britain from the consequences of that disaster. It is remarkable\r\nthat the peasantry in the neighbourhood of Bantry Bay received the\r\nsoldiers of the government well and shared their potatoes with them. Was\r\nthis loyalty or fear? Had the French landed, would the potatoes have been\r\nstill more hospitably shared? An expedition afterwards fitted out in\r\nHolland, now a vassal of France, at the very crisis of the mutiny at the\r\nNore, was weatherbound till the mutiny was over and was then crushed by\r\nDuncan at Camperdown. A small French force under Humbert afterwards\r\nlanded, and at Castlebar put the militia to shameful flight. But it was\r\npresently surrounded by superior numbers and forced to surrender. There\r\nwere still some faint demonstrations, in one of which the arch-enemy of\r\nEngland, Wolfe Tone, met his doom. He imprudently betrayed his identity to\r\nhis captors. His French commission availed him not. He escaped the gallows\r\nby suicide. He was a genuine enthusiast, and he was at all events on one\r\nof the only two practicable lines of action. Separation was the sole\r\nalternative to union. But had Tone got the upper hand, with his fanaticism\r\nand a savage peasantry thirsting for Protestant and English blood at his\r\nback, the political millennium in Ireland, as in France, would have opened\r\nwith a reign of terror.\r\n\r\nDisappointed of aid from France, the rebellion took the field by itself.\r\nThere was a great rising in Wexford, headed by Father Murphy, a fighting\r\npriest, a compound of Wat Tyler and John Ball, who gave himself out as a\r\nsupernatural personage, and persuaded the people that he could catch\r\nbullets in his hands. The father showed a natural genius for war. His\r\npeasants fought desperately, and the Irish pike proved a formidable weapon\r\nin their hands. The rebels gained one or two successes in the field, and\r\ntook the city of Wexford. They perpetrated fiendish cruelties. At\r\nScullabogue they burned or butchered a barn full of Protestants. At\r\nWexford they dragged their prisoners to the bridge, stripped them naked,\r\nhoisted them up on the points of their pikes, and threw them into the\r\nriver. At Vinegar Hill, a name of ghastly memory, the rebel headquarters,\r\na batch of Protestants was every day brought out after a mock trial to be\r\nmassacred. The people being here under priestly leadership, the character\r\nof a religious crusade was given to their warfare, and every Protestant\r\nwas a mark for their murderous fury. On the other hand, Protestants in the\r\nnorth who at the outset had been revolutionary, seeing the rebellion\r\nassume the character of a Catholic crusade, passed to the side of\r\ngovernment and repression. One or two men of property were forced into\r\nleadership by the rebels; otherwise property was entirely on the side of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nAfter Scullabogue, Wexford, and Vinegar Hill, there could not fail to be\r\na terrible outpouring of vengeance. It came in full measure, as we learn\r\nfrom the correspondence of Cornwallis, a soldier of high distinction and\r\ncharacter, who was sent in place of Camden as viceroy to close the scene.\r\nHe is much afraid, he says, that any man in a brown coat who is found\r\nwithin several miles of the field of action is butchered without\r\ndiscrimination. The Irish militia, he says, are totally without\r\ndiscipline, contemptible before the enemy when any serious resistance is\r\nmade to them, but ferocious and cruel in the extreme when any poor\r\nwretches either with or without arms come within their power. In short,\r\nmurder appears their favourite pastime. The conversation of the principal\r\npersons of the country all tends to encourage the system of blood, and the\r\nconversation even at his own table, where he does all he can to prevent\r\nit, always turns on shooting, burning, hanging. If a priest has been put\r\nto death, the greatest joy is expressed by the whole company. \"Who fears\r\nto speak of '98?\" said a patriot bard in other days. The answer is, every\r\none who is not utterly lost to reason and humanity. These militia men, it\r\nis to be borne in mind, were Irish, not English, and their murderous\r\nenmity was the enmity of one section of Ireland to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nPitt now resolved on a legislative union of Ireland with England and\r\nScotland, thus reverting to the policy of the Commonwealth. But union had\r\nbeen the ideal of Molyneux, and since the revolution of 1782 it had found\r\nmany advocates, among them Adam Smith. An Irish government of sectarian\r\nascendancy and oligarchy combined, controlled, and held in precarious\r\nsubordination to the government of Great Britain by intrigue and\r\ncorruption, had ended in murderous and ruinous conflict of political\r\nparties, social classes, and religious sects. In its realm people had been\r\nrefusing to eat pork because the swine might have fed on human flesh.\r\nForeign invasion had been invited. It had come, and only by repeated\r\nmiracles had Great Britain as well as Ireland been saved in the last\r\nextremity of peril. Nor had that peril ceased. It was much to be deplored\r\nthat Pitt could not, like Cromwell and the Council of State, effect the\r\nunion by simply calling representatives of Ireland to the Parliament at\r\nWestminster. Situated as Pitt was, he had, as Castlereagh laconically put\r\nit, \"to buy the fee simple of Irish corruption.\" The price he paid was\r\ncompensation in money to the owners of pocket boroughs and profuse grants\r\nof peerages. The process was not edifying. Cornwallis, who had come at\r\nonce to put an end to havoc and to carry the union, having a strict sense\r\nof honour, might well recoil from his task. Bribery with money has not\r\nbeen brought home to the government, though in one case at least it has\r\nbeen brought home to the opposition. From that stain the union is free. A\r\npretty large sum was needed to tune the press and for campaign expenses.\r\nPocket boroughs in those days were deemed property, and had been so\r\ntreated in Pitt's Reform Bill for England. The compensation paid the\r\nowners of boroughs was not above the market price, and it was paid to the\r\nopponents as well as to the supporters of the union; Lord Downshire, the\r\nmost powerful opponent of the union, as it happened, receiving the largest\r\nsum of all. Foster, who made the greatest speech in Parliament against the\r\nunion, received seventy-five hundred pounds for his half share of a pocket\r\nborough. In the absence of such compensation the owners of pocket boroughs\r\nand the purchasers of seats for them would have been virtually bribed by\r\ntheir private interest apart from any political consideration to oppose\r\nthe bill. Something was needed to induce a powerful and selfish oligarchy\r\nto part with the field of its ascendancy and its ambition. For that\r\npurpose the lavish creation of peerages was used. It cost the nation\r\nnothing, and titles which had been openly used as bribes were not capable\r\nof much degradation. Pitt is upbraided for not having taken the sense of\r\nthe nation by means of a general election. The sense of a nation of which\r\nat least three-quarters were not eligible to Parliament! The sense of the\r\nproprietors of nomination boroughs on the question of depriving them of\r\ntheir property and its influence! The sense of a nation, the passions of\r\nwhich had not had time to cool after a furious civil war, a civil war the\r\nashes of which still fiercely glowed and might by the excitement of a\r\ngeneral election have been fanned again into a flame! It is ever to be\r\nlamented that the thing could not have been done in a simpler and less\r\nquestionable way. But it had to be done. Venality was venal, and, its\r\nconsent being necessary to the salvation of the state, had to be bought.\r\nThe purity of Pitt's motives or of those of his colleagues cannot be\r\nquestioned. The idea that he had provoked rebellion to make way for union\r\nis a slander which only political frenzy could fabricate or believe.\r\n\r\nWhat was the feeling in Ireland at large it is very hard to determine.\r\nThere were addresses and declarations on both sides, but we cannot tell\r\nhow they were got up. Cornwallis made a canvassing tour. His opinion at\r\nfirst was that Dublin was furiously opposed but the rest of the country\r\nwas favourable. This estimate changed as the struggle went on. Dublin, of\r\ncourse, was the centre of excitement. At the outset it was the scene of a\r\nriot. The capital could not like to lose the seat of government and the\r\nsocial centre; nor could the Irish bar like the transfer of the supreme\r\njurisdiction to Westminster, or the severance of the Parliamentary from\r\nthe forensic career; the two, while Parliament sat in Dublin, having been\r\nhabitually, and often brilliantly, combined. Cork, on the other hand, was\r\nflattered with the prospect of becoming a second Glasgow. It seems strange\r\nthat the Orangemen should then have been against the union, of which they\r\nhave since been the staunchest supporters. But they no doubt scented the\r\napproach, with the union, of Catholic emancipation. The Catholic\r\nhierarchy, headed by Archbishop Troy, was strongly for the union, and\r\nunquestionably drew with it a large following both of clergy and laity.\r\nThe hope was undoubtedly held out of Catholic emancipation, possibly\r\naccompanied by a provision for the Catholic priesthood, as a sequel to the\r\nunion; though no positive pledge was or could be given. At the same time\r\nit is to be borne in mind that the general sympathy of a Catholic\r\npriesthood would be with the British government as the chief antagonist of\r\nan atheist France. The terrible tension of '98 had probably been followed\r\nin many quarters by collapse and readiness to acquiesce in anything that\r\ncould hold out to life and property the protection of a strong government.\r\nThe \"Annual Register\" for 1802 says that at the first election of Irish\r\nmembers to the United Parliament no supporter of the union lost his\r\nelection or was even upbraided on that account; that in the county of\r\nDublin alone did a candidate think his opposition to the union such a\r\nclaim to popular favour as to make it worth his while to allude to it; and\r\nthat some of the largest and most independent counties returned strong\r\nsupporters of the union. Cornwallis reports that in Dublin, the chief\r\ncentre of opposition, when at last the royal assent was given to the bill,\r\nnot a murmur was heard nor, as he believed, was there any expression of\r\nill-humour throughout the whole city.\r\n\r\nThe Established Church of Ireland would be willing to support a measure\r\nwhich, by identifying it with the English establishment, converted it from\r\nthe Church of a small minority into a limb of the Church of a great\r\nmajority, thus giving it a tenable ground of existence and a pledge of\r\nsupport which it fondly hoped would never fail.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of opinion, at all events, was conducted on both sides with\r\nperfect freedom. There is no pretence for alleging that the union was\r\ncarried by military force. The affair at Dublin was a street riot, for the\r\nrepression of which it was necessary to call in the troops. Nothing like\r\nmilitary terrorism in fact is alleged. Twelve months before the passing of\r\nthe union, and in the middle of the struggle, Cornwallis said that \"the\r\nforce remaining in Ireland was sufficient to maintain peace, totally\r\ninadequate to repel foreign invasion.\"\r\n\r\nThere were historic debates in the Irish Parliament. Grand speeches were\r\nmade in the nationalist and patriotic vein by opponents of the union.\r\nGrattan, the author of the constitution of 1782, came in his volunteer\r\nuniform to bedew its hearse with his oratoric tears. The dramatic effect\r\nwas enhanced by the bodily infirmity of the great patriot and orator,\r\nwhich obliged him to speak sitting. Plunket put forth to the utmost those\r\npowers of debate which led Lord Russell to pronounce him of all the many\r\nspeakers whom he had heard the most convincing. Foster produced a profound\r\neffect by his mastery of commercial and financial detail, though in this\r\npart of the field he had to contend with the supreme and unclouded\r\njudgment of Adam Smith left on record in favour of union. As strong an\r\nargument as any was that Ireland would be in danger of losing her leading\r\nmen, who would be drawn away to England. But absenteeism was already rife,\r\nand was likely to be in the main diminished rather than increased by any\r\nmeasure which made Ireland a happier abode. To the spirit of nationality\r\ntelling appeals could not fail to be made; but to what the nationality\r\namounted, whether it was nominal or real, of the heart or merely of local\r\nboundary, had with terrible clearness appeared. In the speeches of the\r\nopposition there seems to have been much more of political argument of a\r\ngeneral kind and of patriotic sentiment than of reference to the actual\r\nworking of the Constitution of 1782 and the consequences to which it had\r\nled.\r\n\r\nOf all the opponents of the union on the high patriotic ground, the most\r\nfervid was Plunket. \"For my own part,\" he exclaimed, \"I will resist it to\r\nthe last gasp of my existence, and with the last drop of my blood, and\r\nwhen I feel the hour of my dissolution approaching I will, like the father\r\nof Hannibal, take my children to the altar and swear them to eternal\r\nhostility against the invaders of their country's freedom.\" It is to be\r\nhoped that Plunket's children, if they took the oath, found absolution;\r\nfor the father soon afterwards, sitting in the united Parliament of which\r\nhe was a distinguished member, had so far changed his sentiments as to say\r\nof the union; \"As an Irishman I opposed that union; as an Irishman I avow\r\nthat I did so openly and boldly, nor am I now ashamed of what I then did.\r\nBut though in my resistance to it I had been prepared to go the length of\r\nany man, I am now equally prepared to do all in my power to render it\r\nclose and indissoluble. One of the apprehensions on which my opposition\r\nwas founded, I am happy to say, has been disappointed by the event. I had\r\nbeen afraid that the interest of Ireland, on the abolition of her separate\r\nlegislature, would come to be discussed in a hostile Parliament. But I can\r\nnow state--and I wish when I speak that I could be heard by the whole of\r\nIreland--that during the time that I have sat in the united Parliament I\r\nhave found every question that related to the interests or security of\r\nthat country entertained with indulgence and treated with the most\r\ndeliberate regard.\"\r\n\r\nGrattan too sat in the united Parliament enjoying a Nestorian dignity and\r\nat first, Parliamentary reformer though he was, for a nomination borough.\r\nHe voted for one of those measures of coercion, the necessity for which\r\nunhappily soon made itself felt. The most telling speech of all against\r\nunion in the Irish Parliament was that of Foster; and Foster too sat in\r\nthe united Parliament, was reconciled to Pitt, was by him made chancellor\r\nof the Irish exchequer, and became a peer of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the union in debate was pleaded by Clare and Castlereagh,\r\ninferior to their opponents in eloquence, though Clare was a very\r\nformidable speaker as well as a very strong man.\r\n\r\nThrough the British Parliament the union was carried by overwhelming\r\nmajorities, though opposed by Grey, who afterwards, as prime minister,\r\nbecame its firm upholder, and by Sheridan, far less sage than brilliant,\r\nwhile Fox refused to attend the debates, throwing out a hint that he\r\npreferred something in the way of federation; what, he did not say. In the\r\nIrish Parliament at first the measure was defeated. It was carried at\r\nlength by dead-lift effort on the part of Clare and Castlereagh, who,\r\nleading for the government, did unquestionably make unlimited and by no\r\nmeans scrupulous use of such expedients as in those days were more freely\r\nemployed by governments to push vital measures through the House. That\r\nsuch expedients should have prevailed is to be deplored as a stain on the\r\norigin of the union. At the same time it proves the rottenness of the\r\nassembly then on trial for its life. Nor should it be forgotten that on\r\nthe side of opposition to the union were arrayed purely local and personal\r\ninterests not more respectable in themselves than were the methods by\r\nwhich their resistance was overcome.\r\n\r\nLet Irish patriots, when they bewail the extinction of the independent\r\nParliament of Ireland, remember that its last days had been marked by\r\neager support of the most ruthless and sanguinary measures of repression.\r\n\r\nNo serious exception appears to have been taken to the political bargain\r\nwhich gave Ireland one hundred representatives in the House of Commons\r\nand thirty-two representatives, including four bishops sitting by\r\nrotation, in the House of Lords. The party system has never been\r\nconstitutionally recognized, and it was not observed that the\r\nrepresentative peers, elected by their own order, would always be Tory, to\r\nthe total exclusion of the other party. About the fiscal bargain questions\r\nare raised. These affect not the political issue.\r\n\r\nViceroyalty, with Castle executive, was retained. This may be said to be a\r\nrelic of dependence. But the need of a separate administration\r\nunfortunately has never ceased. When, in 1850, it was moved to abolish the\r\nlord-lieutenancy, Ireland protested, and in deference to her veto the\r\nmeasure was withdrawn. Ireland retained her separate judiciary and for\r\nsome time her separate department of finance.\r\n\r\nIt was in regard to the religious question that the union was for the time\r\na failure. Pitt kept his word. He proposed Catholic emancipation to his\r\ncabinet and pressed it on the king. He was foiled by the rogue and\r\nsycophant Wedderburn, who for his personal ends played on the king's\r\nmorbid conscience and was aided in his work by the influence of two\r\narchbishops, through whom a state church once more rendered its political\r\nservice to the nation. Pitt paid the debt of honour by resignation. It is\r\nsaid that if he had persevered he would have prevailed, and the king would\r\nhave submitted, as he did in other cases, such as the acknowledgment of\r\nAmerican independence, the dismissal of Thurlow, the permission to Lord\r\nMalmesbury to treat with France, the recall of the Duke of York, and the\r\nadmission of Fox to the government. But not one of these was a case of\r\nreligious conscience, nor in one of them had the king a great body of\r\nnational sentiment on his side, as he had, and knew that he had, in his\r\nresistance to Catholic emancipation. He afterwards turned out the\r\nGrenville ministry, which proposed to admit Catholics to military command,\r\nand in so doing was manifestly sustained by the nation. After all, Pitt\r\nmust have known best what could be done with the king. That his\r\nresignation was less of a sacrifice, because he thus escaped the necessity\r\nof treating for peace with France, is conjecture, and does not affect the\r\nactual propriety of his course. The king having in consequence of the\r\nexcitement been threatened with a recurrence of his malady, Pitt waived\r\nthe Catholic question for the king's lifetime, and, when called by the\r\nextreme need of the country, returned to power on that understanding. He\r\nwould have done little good, and not have gratified the nation by driving\r\nthe king mad and transferring the government in the midst of the great war\r\nto the Prince of Wales as Regent and the revellers of Carlton House. In\r\ncriticising the action of public men at this period, we must always bear\r\nin mind the overmastering exigencies of the war. Pitt, though he waived\r\nhis principle on the subject of Catholic emancipation, never renounced it.\r\nIt passed to his pupil Canning, and within a generation prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe only concession made at this time to the Catholics was the endowment\r\nof Maynooth as a seminary for the Catholic priesthood of Ireland, cut off\r\nfrom the seminaries of the continent by the war.\r\n\r\nSince the union, there has been much that was deplorable in the state of\r\nIreland and in the relations of the two islands, the main source of which,\r\nhowever, as will presently appear, was not political. There has been a\r\nhateful series of coercion acts. But there have been no Tudor hostings;\r\nthere has been no 1641; no 1689; no 1798. No fleet of an invader has\r\nanchored in Bantry Bay. Belfast, once the seed-plot of revolution, has\r\nprospered and been content. Two years afterwards revolution flamed up\r\nagain for a moment in the abortive rising of Emmet. Then it died down, to\r\nbreak forth seriously, at least as civil war, no more.\r\n\r\nThe union must be taken to have been a union in the full sense of the\r\nterm, putting an end to separate identity, not merely a standing contract\r\nbetween two parties, each of which retained the right of enforcing the\r\ncontract against the other. On this understanding Parliament has acted,\r\nand is likely again to act in the case of the representation, as well as\r\nin the disestablishment of the Irish Church. The United Kingdom cannot be\r\nhide-bound forever by the terms which, necessarily having reference to the\r\ncircumstances of its formation, must, like those circumstances, have been\r\ndeemed liable to change.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that no common name for the united nationality could be\r\nfound. \"British\" excludes the Irish, \"English\" both the Irish and the\r\nScotch, and separatist sentiment is fostered by the retention of the old\r\nnational name.\r\n\r\nVictory over the French Revolution and Napoleon was accompanied by an\r\nascendancy of Toryism, which kept Liverpool at the head of the government\r\nfor fourteen years. In this both islands fared alike. But the Cabinet was\r\ndivided on the subject of Catholic emancipation. Plunket, still a Liberal\r\nthough now a Unionist, showed his power as a debater in the Catholic\r\ncause. Castlereagh and Canning were on the Liberal side. Emancipation was\r\ncarried in the Commons, thrown out in the lords, while old Eldon drank to\r\nthe thirty-nine peers who had saved the Thirty-nine Articles, little\r\nthinking how soon he was to be smitten in the house of his friends. On\r\nLiverpool's death there were a few months of Canning and a brief interlude\r\nof Goodrich. Then power reverted to the Tory and anti-Catholic section of\r\nthe Liverpool combination, at the head of which were Wellington and Peel.\r\nPeel, in whom hereditary Toryism was combined with natural openness of\r\nmind and practical sagacity, as well as with supreme skill in\r\nadministration, seemed specially sent to carry England safely by the\r\nbridge of Conservatism over the gulf between the old era and the new. He\r\nhad been one of the anti-Catholic section of the Liverpool government, and\r\nin that character had been elected to Parliament by the clerical and then\r\nProtestant University of Oxford. But he had administered Ireland for six\r\nyears; had seen the state of things there; had been impressed and shown\r\nsymptoms of a change of sentiment. He dealt liberally with Catholics in\r\nthe matter of patronage. He and Wellington now acquiesced in the relief of\r\nthe Dissenters by the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. Probably\r\nthey were hesitating on the brink of Catholic emancipation when they were\r\nimpelled by a new force. The Catholic cause had found for itself a\r\nfirst-rate leader, organizer, and orator, Daniel O'Connell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel O'Connell, whose figure fills the next page in Irish history, was a\r\nDublin barrister who, having gained a unique reputation as a skilful or\r\nmore than skilful winner of verdicts, passed from the forensic to the\r\npolitical field. He was of pure Irish blood, Irish in physiognomy,\r\ntypically Irish in character. Nature had endowed him with all the gifts of\r\na popular leader, bodily as well as mental; for he had a voice of\r\nunrivalled power and compass as well as extraordinary tact in dealing with\r\nthe masses and skill in the conduct of agitation. His oratory was such as\r\nnever failed to tell with his Irish audience, while its violent\r\nexaggeration, its disregard of truth and offensiveness of expression too\r\noften excited the just resentment of those whom he assailed and repelled\r\nall moderate and right-minded men. At the same time he knew how to play\r\nthe courtier, as he showed when George IV. visited Ireland. He entered\r\npublic life without the blessing of the veteran Grattan, who accused him\r\nof setting afloat the bad passions of the people, venting calumny against\r\nGreat Britain, and making politics a trade. That his motives were mixed is\r\nprobable. But of his Irish patriotism there could be no doubt. O'Connell\r\nwas a most devout Catholic, enjoyed the hearty confidence of the\r\npriesthood, and was able to make full use of its influence in calling out\r\nand marshalling the people. He thus opened a new era in the history of\r\nIrish agitation. In return, he supported the priesthood in its extreme\r\npretensions; notably in defeating a proposal for the admission of\r\nCatholics to political power subject to securities for the loyalty of\r\ntheir Church which conflicted with high priestly pretensions, though it\r\nhad been favourably entertained at Rome. It was on this point that he and\r\nGrattan broke. O'Connell, with the aid of his priestly fuglemen, formed a\r\ngreat Catholic association to overawe the government. On the other side,\r\nthe Orangemen, now heartily Unionist, rushed to arms. A fierce conflict\r\nensued in Ireland, with some danger to the peace. In the course of it the\r\nDuke of York, heir presumptive to the Crown, electrified the country and\r\nfilled the heart of Eldon and true blue Protestantism with joy by a solemn\r\ndeclaration that if he became king he would veto Catholic emancipation.\r\nAfter trying his power by carrying some elections, O'Connell determined\r\nto bring the conflict to a head by himself standing for Parliament in\r\ndefiance of the law by which, as a Catholic, he was excluded. He carried\r\nhis election for Clare against the candidate of the gentry by the votes of\r\nthe Catholic peasantry, the forty-shilling freeholders; the influence of\r\nthe Church with its sacraments being openly employed in his support. Peel\r\nand Wellington now gave way and carried the admission of the Catholics to\r\nParliament, only tempering the shock to their Tory supporters by the\r\nabolition of the forty-shilling freehold; no great blow to liberty, since\r\nthe only question was whether the forty-shilling freeholder should be the\r\ntool of the landlord or of the priest. The refusal to O'Connell of the\r\nrank of king's counsel, to which he had become eligible, was defended as\r\nanother sop to the Tories; but it really was a mark of resentment, very\r\nunwise as well as undignified, though partly excused by the offensiveness\r\nof O'Connell's bearing and language. It may have been unwillingness to\r\nconfess change of opinion that led Wellington and Peel to ascribe the\r\nconcession of Catholic emancipation to fear of civil war. O'Connell could\r\nnot have put into the field any force capable of making head against the\r\nforces of the government, Ulster, the Orangemen, and the Irish gentry. He\r\nwas himself utterly unwarlike, and there was no foreign power to come to\r\nhis aid. The measure was a concession of right demanded not only by the\r\nIrish Catholics themselves, but by a large party in England which included\r\nthe best intelligence of the country and the most powerful organs of the\r\npress, without the help of which it could not have been carried. Unhappily\r\nit was made to appear as a concession of fear.\r\n\r\nO'Connell's victory made him the idol and the master of Catholic Ireland.\r\nA large revenue, called his \"rent,\" was thenceforth raised for him by\r\nannual subscription. On this his enemies did not fail to reflect. He\r\ndefended it as the necessary compensation for the sacrifice of a large\r\nprofessional income to the service of the country. At his ancestral\r\nmansion of Darrynane, on the wild, thoroughly Celtic, and Erse-speaking\r\ncoast of Kerry, the \"Liberator\" held a rustic court profusely hospitable,\r\namidst a circle of devoted adherents, with an open table at which as many\r\nas thirty guests were sometimes seated; thus presenting probably the\r\nnearest possible counterpart of the head of a great sept in the tribal\r\ndays. To Darrynane a pilgrimage was made by Montalembert, who fondly\r\nhoped that he had found in its master that union of devotion to the\r\nChurch with liberty which was the ideal of the liberal Catholic school.\r\n\r\nWould Catholic emancipation pacify Ireland? Its authors expected that it\r\nwould. Even Macaulay appears to think that if the popular religion of\r\nIreland had been treated at the union as the popular religion of Scotland\r\nwas treated, all in Ireland, as in Scotland, might have been well. The\r\nresult was disappointing. The Irish cotter had voted and shouted for\r\nCatholic emancipation at the bidding of the priests and the platform; but\r\nwhat he wanted and hoped to get by a revolution of any kind was, not so\r\nmuch political or religious change, as more oats and potatoes. His real\r\ngrievances were hunger and nakedness. To afford those myriads a\r\ntreacherous food, the behest of nature had been too much disregarded;\r\nlands destined for pasture had been turned into potato and oat plots. The\r\nmillions, reduced to an animal existence, had gone on multiplying with\r\nanimal recklessness. The increase was greater since rebellion and\r\ndevastation were at an end. In this sense alone the consequences of the\r\nunion may be said to have been evil. The priest enjoined marriage on moral\r\ngrounds, perhaps not without an eye to fees. Between 1801 and 1841\r\npopulation increased by three millions. More than ever, the homes were\r\nfilthy hovels shared with swine, the beds litters of dirty straw, the\r\ndresses rags, the food the potato, while there was frequent dearth and\r\nsometimes famine. Eviction increased, since, the forty-shilling freehold\r\nfranchise having been abolished, the landlord cared no longer to multiply\r\nholdings for the sake of votes. The land system, with its tiers of\r\nmiddlemen, was as cruel as ever. Tithe, the most odious of all imposts,\r\nwas still collected in the most odious manner. As a consequence, peasant\r\nIreland was still the scene of a vast agrarian war waged by a starving\r\npeople against the landlord and the tithe-proctor. Arson, murder, carding\r\nand mutilation of middlemen and tithe-proctors were rife. Victims leaping\r\nfrom the windows of their burning houses were caught on pitchforks. The\r\nnation was undergoing a baptism of lawlessness and savagery. All the\r\npeasants were in the league of crime and screened the assassin. Law was\r\npowerless. Prosecution was hopeless. Murder was committed in open day and\r\nbefore a number of witnesses, all of whom, if brought into court, would\r\nperjure themselves in the common cause. A deep impression had been made\r\nupon Peel by the horrors of the agrarian war. He had been particularly\r\nmoved by a case showing the transcendent height which social passion had\r\nattained. A party of Whiteboys entered a house in which there were the man\r\nwhom they came to murder, his wife, and their little girl. The man was in\r\na room on the ground floor. His wife and their little girl were in a room\r\nabove, with a closet, through a hole in the door of which the room could\r\nbe seen. The woman heard the Whiteboys enter and knew their errand. She\r\nput the child into the closet, saying to her, \"They are murdering your\r\nfather below, then they will come up and murder me. Mind you look well at\r\nthem and swear to them when you see them in court.\" The child obeyed. She\r\nlooked on while her mother was murdered. She swore to the murderers in\r\ncourt, and they were hanged upon her evidence.\r\n\r\nThe evil had reached such a height that society in Ireland was almost on\r\nthe point of dissolution. Ordinary coercion acts, of which there had been\r\na series, failed and the Liberal government of Grey was compelled to have\r\nrecourse to martial law.\r\n\r\nThe tide of reform, however, which began to flow in 1830, before it ebbed,\r\nbrought to Ireland, besides her share in reform of the Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation, the opening of the municipal councils, which had been\r\nuniversally close and corrupt, and after Catholic emancipation still\r\nexcluded Catholics. It brought commutation of tithe, a measure of immense\r\nvalue, far too long delayed, which shifted the burden of payment from the\r\nshoulders of the cotter to those of the landlord. It brought a poor law,\r\ncruelly needed in the midst of multiplying evictions. Furthermore, it\r\nbrought in 1831-1833 the momentous gift of public education, national and\r\nundenominational, in the inauguration of which the Anglican primate,\r\nArchbishop Whateley, reconciling his advanced liberalism with his\r\nanomalous position, took a leading part. Ireland thus in national\r\neducation preceded England by many years. Whateley had fellow-workers in\r\nliberal Catholics, ecclesiastical as well as lay, but the weight of Roman\r\nauthority and influence was, as it always has been, and still is, against\r\nfree education. The State Church of the minority succeeded in repelling\r\nattack; but it underwent some internal reform, including the suppression\r\nof ten superfluous bishoprics; a sacrilegious act of the state which\r\nhelped to give birth to sacerdotal reaction at Oxford. After the abolition\r\nof the tithe-proctor, the State Church had become less odious to the\r\npeople. The Castle administration was growing more liberal.\r\nLords-lieutenant tried to be fair in distribution of patronage. A Liberal\r\nsecretary, a man of mark, Drummond, warned the Irish landlords that\r\nproperty had its duties as well as its rights. Peel, as Irish secretary,\r\nhad laid the foundation of the Irish constabulary, that noble force of law\r\nand order which combines independent intelligence with the discipline of\r\nthe regular soldier. Drummond rendered a most important service by\r\ncompleting the institution. The Irish constabulary has naturally in the\r\nmain been composed of Protestants. But the Catholic policeman in Ireland\r\nhas in a marked way resisted seditious influence and been true to the\r\ngovernment and his duty. The Irishman follows his commander. Attempts to\r\nseduce Irish soldiers from fidelity to the colours seem to have generally\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nO'Connell, with his following, helped to carry the Parliamentary Reform\r\nBill of 1832, which, in fact, could not have been carried without their\r\nvote. He lent a general though not hearty or unwavering support to the\r\nWhig ministry of Grey, which, though it paid him some deference, was too\r\nstrong to be under his control. But on the passing of a drastic coercion\r\nbill directed against political as well as agrarian disturbance, there was\r\nan angry rupture, and the Whigs became \"base, bloody, and brutal,\" like\r\nall others who crossed O'Connell's will. O'Connell was not handsomely\r\ntreated. His eminence as a lawyer, combined with his influence in Ireland,\r\nentitled him to a high place. But his blustering violence, his unmeasured\r\nvituperation, his venomous abuse of England, and the changefulness of his\r\nmoods made him a dangerous ally for any government. Cobden said,\r\n\"O'Connell always treated me with friendly attention, but I never shook\r\nhands with him or faced his smile without a feeling of insecurity; and as\r\nfor trusting him on any public question where his vanity or passions might\r\ninterpose, I should have as soon thought of an alliance with an Ashantee\r\nchief.\"\r\n\r\nThe Melbourne and Russell ministry was weak and fain to lean on O'Connell\r\nwith his Irish brigade for support and to allow him a voice in\r\nappointments, though it suffered greatly in English eyes by the alliance.\r\nO'Connell shouted with joy when that government was snatched from death\r\nand restored to a feeble existence by the refusal of the queen to change\r\nher bed-chamber women on Peel's demand. But the advent of Peel to power,\r\nwith a strong government, filled him with rage and despair. The two men\r\nhad quarrelled in Ireland, a challenge had passed between them, and Peel\r\nwas the object of O'Connell's bitterest hatred. In principle the new\r\ngovernment was hostile to O'Connell, and its strength placed it wholly\r\nbeyond his influence. His power was threatened with extinction. His rent,\r\nmoreover, since there had been a lull in agitation, was rapidly falling\r\noff, and he was in pecuniary distress. The last, some think, was not his\r\nleast urgent motive for embarking in another agitation. This time it was\r\nfor a repeal of the union, of which he had before only thrown out fitful\r\nhints. He now raised the standard of repeal and issued his mandate to the\r\npriesthood to call out the peasantry in that cause. The priesthood\r\njoyfully obeyed. Monster meetings were held and were addressed by\r\nO'Connell in his most violent strain, with ostensible respect for\r\nconstitutional methods, but with constant appeals to national hatred and\r\nsuggestions of military force. The priests consecrated the meetings and\r\nthe sentiments, celebrating Mass on the grounds. It is surely idle to\r\ncontend that a priesthood acting thus and having its centre in Rome is\r\nonly a Christian ministry, not a power of political disturbance. An\r\noutbreak appeared to be at hand, when the government took direct issue\r\nwith the agitator by proclaiming a monster meeting which he had appointed\r\nto be held at Clontarf; a scene suggestive of military force as it had\r\nbeen the field of the great Irish victory. O'Connell, who, if he was not\r\npacific, was unwarlike, shrank from the conflict and called off the\r\nmeeting. The government followed up the blow by indicting the agitator for\r\nsedition. There was a monster trial at Dublin, in the course of which, to\r\npreserve the Irish character of the scene, the attorney-general challenged\r\nthe counsel on the other side to a duel. O'Connell was found guilty, but\r\nthe verdict was afterwards quashed on appeal to the House of Lords, for\r\nirregularity in the panel, by the judgment of three Whigs against one Tory\r\nand the independent Brougham, though it had been upheld by seven of the\r\nnine judges to whom the case was referred. O'Connell was set free. But the\r\nspell of his ascendancy had been broken. By shrinking from the appeal to\r\nforce he had forfeited the respect of the fighting section of his party.\r\nThe Conservative government was invincibly strong. O'Connell's health and\r\nphysical force had broken down. Thus ended the great Liberator's career.\r\nHe bequeathed his body to Ireland and his heart to Rome. There can be no\r\nquestion about his devotion to either, whatever motives may have mingled\r\nwith his devotion to Ireland. Whether he did more good to the Irish cause\r\nby his patriotism than harm by the passions which he excited and the\r\nenmities he created, is a question about which different opinions have\r\nbeen formed. His blind attachment to the Church, had he been victorious,\r\nwould have put Ireland under the control of a reactionary priesthood.\r\n\r\nFor some time before his death, O'Connell, by shrinking from force, had\r\nbeen losing the hearts and the adherence of a party of force on his own\r\nside called \"Young Ireland,\" a set of young men, some highly gifted as\r\njournalists or poets, whose aim was not repeal but national independence,\r\nand who in their organ, _The Nation_, preached rebellion and revelled in\r\nthe memory of '98.\r\n\r\nPeel, victorious, graced his victory by concession, to which indeed he was\r\nheartily inclined. He saw that \"Ireland was his difficulty,\" and wanted to\r\ntreat the problem as liberally as his following of Protestants and squires\r\nwould let him. He increased the grant to Maynooth, thereby constraining\r\nGladstone, by way of satisfaction to his former self, to go through the\r\nform of resignation. He enabled the Catholic Church freely to receive\r\ncharitable bequests. Not venturing to throw open the fellowships and\r\nscholarships of Trinity College to the Catholics, he founded for their\r\nspecial benefit three undenominational colleges at Belfast, Cork, and\r\nGalway, forming together a university with power of granting degrees. This\r\nmeasure, excellent in its way, was but a partial success. The priesthood\r\nlooked with invincible suspicion on free science, while Catholic\r\nprofessors of science, whom the Church might have trusted, were hardly to\r\nbe found. But Peel touched the real root of the evil, and pointed to\r\neffective reform, when, in 1843, he issued a Commission of Inquiry into\r\nland occupancy in Ireland and the condition of the peasant occupants. The\r\ncommission reported that the agricultural labourer of Ireland continued to\r\nsuffer the greatest privations and hardships; that he was still dependent\r\nupon casual and precarious employment for subsistence; that he was still\r\nbadly housed, badly clothed, and badly fed; and that he was undergoing\r\nsufferings greater than those of the people of any other country in\r\nEurope. Some tentative motions followed, but there had scarcely been time\r\nfor the report of the commission to work, when the sentence of nature was\r\npronounced with awful distinctness in the form of a great famine with\r\npestilence in its train. The population of Ireland at this time was\r\nprobably double that which the island could happily bear. A precarious\r\nsubsistence was afforded by the potato, which, always treacherous, now\r\nsuddenly and completely failed. Peel, warned of impending calamity, at\r\nonce opened the ports for the importation of grain, then grasped the\r\noccasion for the repeal of the Corn Laws, on the policy of which his own\r\nmind had been undergoing change. His administrative power and that of his\r\ncolleagues would probably have done all that was possible to meet and\r\nmitigate the disaster. But at the critical moment his government was\r\nstruck down by a conspiracy of Russell and the Whigs with the ire of the\r\nCorn Law squires and the vengeful ambition of Disraeli. Russell, who took\r\nhis place, was far more an adept in party strategy than a master of\r\npractical administration. There ensued a heartrending scene, the climax of\r\nseven centuries of evil accident, maladministration, and Irish woe.\r\n\r\n\"Famine advances on us with giant strides,\" wrote an official in the\r\nAugust of 1846. \"Towards the end of August,\" says Mr. T. P. O'Connor, \"the\r\ncalamity began to be universal and its symptoms to be seen. Some of the\r\npeople rushed into the towns, others wandered along the highroads in the\r\nvague hope of food. They plucked turnips from the fields, were glad to\r\nlive for weeks on a single meal of cabbage a day, feasted on the dead\r\nbodies of horses and asses and dogs. There was a story of a mother eating\r\nthe limbs of her dead child. Dead bodies were discovered with grass in\r\ntheir mouths and in their bowels; weeds were sought after with desperate\r\neagerness; seaweed was greedily devoured; so were diseased cattle and\r\ndiseased potatoes. Despair fell on all hearts and faces. The ties of\r\nkindred in some cases failed, parents neglecting their children and\r\nchildren turning out their aged parents. On the other hand, there were\r\nstories of parents dying of starvation to save a small store for their\r\nchildren. The workhouses, usually shunned, were overcrowded. In one, three\r\nthousand persons sought relief in a single day. They crowded even into the\r\njails. Driven from the workhouses, people began to die by the roadside or\r\nalone in their despair within their cabins. Roads and streets were strewn\r\nwith corpses. One inspector buried one hundred and forty bodies found on\r\nthe highway. The scenes inside the cabins were even more horrible;\r\nhusbands lay for a week in the same hovels with the bodies of their wives\r\nand children. The decencies of burial were no longer observed. Then came\r\nthe plague, attacking bodies already weakened by hunger.\" \"A terrible\r\napathy,\" says an eye-witness, \"hangs over the poor of Skibbereen;\r\nstarvation has destroyed every generous sympathy; despair has made them\r\nhardened and insensible, and they sullenly await their doom with\r\nindifference and without fear. Death is in every hovel; disease and\r\nfamine, its dread precursors, have fastened on the young and the old, the\r\nstrong and the feeble, the mother and the infant; whole families lie\r\ntogether on the damp floor devoured by fever, without a human being to wet\r\ntheir burning lips or raise their languid heads; the husband dies by the\r\nside of the wife, and she knows not that he is beyond the reach of earthly\r\nsuffering; the same rag covers festering remains of mortality and the\r\nskeleton forms of the living, who are unconscious of the horrible\r\ncontiguity; rats devour the corpse, and there is no energy among the\r\nliving to scare them from their horrid banquet; fathers bury their\r\nchildren without a sigh, and cover them in shallow graves, round which no\r\nweeping mother, no sympathizing friends are grouped; one scanty funeral is\r\nfollowed by another and another. Without food or fuel, bed or bedding,\r\nwhole families are shut up in naked hovels, dropping one by one into the\r\narms of death.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAll the devices of government by relief work and in other ways to grapple\r\nwith the twofold calamity were palliatives and little more. The most\r\neffective measure of relief was a vast emigration to the United States and\r\nCanada, which also had its horrors. Thousands, already weakened by hunger\r\nand suffering, succumbed to the hardships of the passage; another\r\nmultitude died on landing. Canada did all she could for the hapless\r\nstrangers cast upon her shore. But ship-fever followed the fugitives, and\r\ngraveyards were filled with their dead. It was reckoned that more than two\r\nhundred thousand persons died on the voyage or on arrival at their\r\ndestination. Few Irishmen, however prejudiced against England, will deny\r\nthat the people of Great Britain and Canada showed unbounded sympathy with\r\nIreland in her affliction, and did their utmost for her relief. O'Connell\r\nhimself, while he criticised the measures of the government, allowed that\r\nindividual humanity and charity were abundant; that the noblest generosity\r\nwas evinced by multitudes of the English; and that if individual\r\ngenerosity could save a nation, British generosity would do it. He said\r\nthat he was afraid of not finding words sufficient to express his strong\r\nand lively sense of English humanity. To charges of English indifference\r\nto Irish suffering, his words are a sufficient answer.\r\n\r\nClose upon the famine and pestilence came 1848, the year of European\r\nrevolution. Young Ireland, the party of force, did not fail to catch the\r\nflame. Its organ, _The Nation_, cried, \"It is a death struggle now between\r\nthe murderer and his victim. Strike! Rise, men of Ireland, since\r\nProvidence so wills it! Rise in your cities and in your fields, on your\r\nhills, in your valleys, by your dark mountain passes, by your rivers and\r\nlakes and ocean-washed shores! Rise as a nation!\" _The Irish Felon_, a\r\njournal still more advanced, was even more openly for war. But neither in\r\ncity or field, on mountain or in valley, by pass or shore, did the people\r\nrise at the impassioned call. Young Ireland found at once that it was but\r\na knot of literary men whose appeals to national feeling, penned as they\r\nwere with vigour, might be read with sentimental pleasure but would rouse\r\nnobody to arms. O'Connell's mastery of the people depended on the support\r\nof the priesthood, given in a cause originally religious to that zealous\r\nchampion of the Church who, dying, bequeathed his heart to Rome. Young\r\nIreland was more revolutionary than Catholic, as the priests did not fail\r\nto perceive. The desire of political revolution, apart from agrarianism,\r\nwas not strong enough to rouse the peasantry to arms, though they had\r\nlearned to hate England as the supposed source of their sufferings. The\r\npeople, moreover, had hardly recovered from the depression caused by the\r\nfamine. Young Ireland however raised its flag. Smith O'Brien, with a small\r\nparty, made a trial trip, appealing to the people of two or three places,\r\nbut met with no response. A farcical encounter with the police at the\r\nhouse of widow Cormack on the bog of Boulagh, followed by the capture of\r\nSmith O'Brien, was the end. The sentence of death passed on the leader of\r\nthe revolt was wisely commuted by the government.\r\n\r\nThe famine had at least one good effect. It drew attention to the main\r\nsource of the evil in Ireland, which was agrarian and social, not\r\npolitical and religious. But now it was supposed that the mischief lay in\r\nthe inability of the landlords, overwhelmed with debt, burdened with\r\nfamily settlements, and crushed by the demands of the Poor Law, to perform\r\ntheir duty to their tenants. To remedy this evil was created the\r\nEncumbered Estates Court, with power to order the sale of encumbered\r\nproperty on the petition of the creditors and give a clear title to the\r\npurchaser. The policy seemed sound, yet the result was not good. The court\r\ncleared out the old proprietors who lacked means to do their duty; it put\r\nin their place a new class of proprietors who, having been induced to buy\r\nthe land on pure speculation, felt that they had no duty to do, and who,\r\nunlike their predecessors, had no kindly tie to the people. The new owners\r\nnaturally proceeded to make the most of their purchase; and the way to\r\nmake the most of their purchase clearly was to sweep out the cotter\r\ntenants and throw the land into large holdings. This some of them\r\nproceeded to do, and the consequence was a period of evictions almost\r\nvying in cruelty with the famine. Whole districts were cleared and relet\r\nin large holdings. Cabins were being thrown down in all directions. A\r\nthousand of them were levelled in one union within a few months, and the\r\ninmates were cast out helpless, half-naked, starving, to go to the union\r\nor perish. The cabins were burned that the people might not return to\r\nthem. The suffering and misery, says a reporter, attendant upon these\r\nwholesale evictions, is indescribable. The number of houseless paupers in\r\none union is beyond his calculation. Those evicted crowd neighbouring\r\ncabins and villages, and disease is necessarily generated. In April he\r\ncalculates that six thousand houses have been levelled since November, and\r\nhe expects five hundred more by July. Wretched hovels had been pulled\r\ndown, the inmates of which in a helpless state of fever and nakedness were\r\nleft by the roadside for days. While inspecting a stone-breaking depot,\r\nthe reporter observes one of the men take off his remnant of a pair of\r\nshoes and start across the fields. He follows him with his eye, and at a\r\ndistance sees the blaze of a fire in the bog. He sends to inquire the\r\ncause of it and of the man's running from his work, and is told that the\r\nman's house had been levelled the day before, that he had erected a\r\ntemporary hut, and that while his wife and children were gathering\r\nshell-fish on the beach and he was stone-breaking the bailiff fired it.\r\nThis incident was one of several which made a deep impression on Peel, who\r\nwould probably have moved with effect had he remained in power. Pages are\r\nfilled with pictures of this kind. Civilized Europe could show nothing\r\nlike it. It was almost enough to break forever the spirit of the nation,\r\ncertainly to implant the bitterest memories, and here the main cause was\r\nmisgovernment and bad law.\r\n\r\nRelief works were no cure, nor were they in themselves very rational,\r\nsince the people, unfed, half-clothed, and living in pestilential\r\nmud-holes, were really too weak to work. Parliament so far interfered as\r\nto pass an act requiring forty-eight hours' notice of eviction to the\r\nrelieving officers, prohibiting evictions two hours before sunset or\r\nsunrise, and on Christmas Day and Good Friday, and prohibiting the\r\ndemolition of the house of a tenant about to be evicted. But this rather\r\nthrows a lurid light on the state of things than effects a cure. The\r\npublic even might have some reason to complain of the land-owner who\r\nrecklessly cast upon the poor rates or upon public charity the human\r\nencumbrances of his land.\r\n\r\nApart from overpopulation and its effects, the Irish land-law\r\nunquestionably needed reform. The people, struggling with each other for\r\ntheir sole means of subsistence, undertook to pay exorbitant rents, and\r\ntheir improvements, if they made any, became without compensation the\r\nproperty of the landlord. In Ulster, always exceptional, there prevailed a\r\ncertain measure of tenant-right, something like the English copyhold. In\r\nIreland the demand for tenant-right now began to be loudly heard. An\r\nEnglish Radical, Sharman Crawford, brought forward a measure in\r\nParliament, but without effect. For some years nothing effectual was done\r\nin the way of reform. Palmerston, to whom power passed, though in foreign\r\npolicy he dallied with revolution, was conservative, especially on social\r\nsubjects, at home. \"Tenant's right is landlord's wrong\" was his judgment\r\non the agrarian question. On the Irish side there was no leader of worth\r\nor force. Patriotism was in a trance, and the chronicler of the\r\nNationalist party indignantly proclaims that the cause was betrayed by a\r\nseries of low adventurers who embraced it as the way to preferment. \"The\r\nmost common type of Irish politician,\" he says in his anguish, \"in these\r\ndays was the man who entered Parliamentary life solely for the purpose of\r\nselling himself for place and salary.\" \"This,\" he adds, \"was the golden\r\nseason, when every Irishman who could scrape as much money together as\r\nwould pay his election expenses was able after a while to obtain a\r\ngovernorship or some other of the many substantial rewards which English\r\nparty leaders were able to give to their followers.\" The constituencies,\r\nit seems, political feeling being at a low ebb, were ready to elect the\r\nman who could bring them public pelf. Of the adventurers, the worst was\r\nSadleir, who, with his set, attempted to intrigue with the Peelites, and\r\nwho, being a financial swindler as well as a political schemer, became\r\nbankrupt and committed suicide. So the cause of the Three F's--Fixity of\r\ntenure, Free sale, and Fair rents--made no way. English Radicals in\r\nParliament stood all the time ready to move with the Irish on this\r\nquestion or for Disestablishment; but the Irish members were taken up with\r\nintriguing for places for themselves, for appointments of the sons of\r\ntheir constituents to clerkships in Somerset House, or for a government\r\nsubsidy to the Galway Packet contract. Irish writers are bound to remember\r\nthat Englishmen were not responsible for the choice or character of Irish\r\nmembers. They are bound also to remember the impression which the members\r\nchosen by the Irish could not fail to make on English minds. The British\r\nParliament could not justly be said to be \"deaf, blind, and insolently\r\nignorant,\" though it was not on the right track. It might be excused for\r\nbeing a little deaf and blind to the appeals of \"a motley gang of as\r\ndisreputable and needy adventurers as ever trafficked in the blood and\r\ntears of a nation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the union to this time there had been, and long after\r\nthis time continued to be, a series of coercion acts, rendered necessary\r\nby agrarian outrage. There were thirty-two enactments of this kind between\r\nthe union and 1844. It would have been almost better, had it been\r\npossible, frankly to suspend the constitution while the true remedy was\r\nbeing applied.\r\n\r\nLiberal leadership now devolved from Palmerston on Gladstone, thus\r\nbringing on the political field a new and immensely powerful motive power.\r\nGladstone was in opposition. In his mind a natural, and under the party\r\nsystem legitimate, desire of recovering power for his party and himself\r\nperhaps mingled with a sincere though tardily formed conviction of the\r\ninjustice of such an institution as the State Church of a small minority\r\nin Ireland. It was unfortunate that he, like Peel and Wellington, gave\r\nfear of Irish violence as a motive for doing justice. After some\r\npremonitory hints, he, in former days the great champion of state\r\nreligion, declared for disestablishment. His case was overwhelmingly\r\nstrong. Faint and feeble were the arguments on the other side. The\r\ninstitution was an anachronism, an anomaly, and a scandal. Its past had\r\nbeen miserable. It had made no converts; it had made many rebels. By its\r\ntests and its intolerance it had divided the Protestant interest, sending\r\nmany a Presbyterian across the sea to fight for the American Revolution.\r\nIts ministry had been jobbed, its character defiled, by unscrupulous\r\npoliticians. Of late, however, it had been greatly reforming itself, and\r\nit had got rid of its tithe-proctors by the commutation of tithes. Its\r\nclergy generally were now on friendly terms with the people. Its last hour\r\nwas by far its best. Vested interests were respected in the change, and\r\nthe unblest establishment glided quietly and safely into its new and\r\nhappier life as a purely spiritual church. Through the Commons the measure\r\npassed with ease; through the Lords, like other great measures of change,\r\nit was forced by fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom disestablishment of the Church Gladstone, now in the full swing of\r\nhis Liberalism, proceeded next year to reform the land system of Ireland.\r\nTaking his cue from Ulster tenant-right, perhaps also from English\r\ncopyhold, he passed an act, the first of a series which, by giving\r\ncompensation for improvements and for disturbance, restricting eviction,\r\nregulating rents, and furnishing to the tenant by government loans the\r\nmeans of purchasing the fee, has gone far towards transferring the\r\nownership from the landlord to the tenant. Some of these measures have\r\nvirtually involved confiscation, notably in the case of purchasers under\r\nthe Encumbered Estates Act, to whom full ownership had been morally\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nEconomically, the tendency, indeed the aim, of the land acts has been to\r\nmake Ireland a land of peasant proprietors. The social tendency of such\r\nlegislation is to the abolition of the gentry, of the value of whose\r\nleadership to a people eminently in need of leaders, Gladstone,\r\npersonally ignorant of Ireland, might not be a competent judge.\r\nUnquestionably, the relations between landlord and tenant called for\r\nreform. The appropriation of the tenant's improvements by the landlord was\r\nin itself plainly unjust, and the sweeping evictions yielded in cruelty\r\nonly to the famine. But for overpopulation the immediate remedy was\r\ndepletion. Had Gladstone said that the overpopulation was originally the\r\nconsequence of misgovernment and repression of industry which, reducing\r\nthe people to abject misery, had wrecked their self-respect and\r\nself-restraint, he would have been emphatically right, and the fact cannot\r\nbe too constantly kept in mind. Gladstone might also have said with truth\r\nthat emigration was a mournful cure, though it transferred the emigrant to\r\na far happier land and lot. But the overpopulation having taken place,\r\nwhatever the cause, the only remedy was depletion. No expansion of\r\nmanufacturing industry, commerce, or mining adequate to the absorption of\r\nthe surplus population could be expected in time to meet the pressing call\r\nfor relief. Irishmen are sensitive on this point, but no disparagement of\r\nthe Irish race is implied in the recognition of the facts. Overpopulation\r\nwas not the fault of the people, but their misfortune. There has been a\r\nvery large migration of the Irish into England and Scotland as well as\r\ninto the colonies and the United States.\r\n\r\nGladstone's measure, however, fell short of Irish expectation, which was\r\nthe three F's: Fixity of tenure; Fair rent; Freedom of sale. A land war\r\npresently broke out and became combined with a struggle nominally for Home\r\nRule, really for separation from Great Britain. The political part of this\r\nagitation, rebellion as it really was, had its main source and support,\r\nnot in Ireland, but in the Irish population of the United States. Even\r\nbefore the famine there had been an emigration of Irish to America, so\r\nlarge as by its political effects to alarm American patriotism and give\r\nbirth to the great Know-nothing Movement in defence of American\r\nnationality. The Irish, being highly gregarious and unused to large\r\nfarming, settled in cities. When they went out to work on railways or\r\ncanals, it was in large gangs. They were drawn into the vortex of politics\r\nand became the retainers of crafty politicians, who, in secret, smiled at\r\ntheir simplicity. They fell almost invariably into the Democratic party.\r\nThe name may have attracted them; but the Democratic party was that of the\r\nSouthern slave-owner, who was glad to enlist the Irishman as his humble\r\nally at the North and to pay him out of the treasury of political\r\ncorruption. The rank and file of Tammany were largely Irish. O'Connell had\r\nbeen nobly hostile to slavery. His kinsmen and admirers on the other side\r\nof the Atlantic were, on the contrary, vehement supporters of slavery, and\r\njealous assertors of their superiority over the enslaved race. Such is the\r\ntendency of the newly enfranchised. In the war between the North and the\r\nSouth the Irish in New York rose against the draft and committed great\r\noutrages, especially against the negro, among other things setting fire to\r\na negro orphan asylum. They were ruthlessly put down. After the famine,\r\nemigration greatly increased. Family affection among the Irish is\r\nbeautifully strong, and the members of a family who had gone before sent\r\nhome their earnings to pay for the passage of those whom they had left\r\nbehind. It has been reckoned that the Irish have expended twenty millions\r\nsterling in this way. With a passionate love of Ireland the American Irish\r\ncombined a still more passionate hatred of England as Ireland's tyrant and\r\noppressor. Invasion and destruction of England were their dream. Always\r\naddicted to secret fraternities and natural adepts in conspiracy, they\r\nformed associations for war on England; that of the Fenians and that of\r\nthe still more rabid and bloodthirsty Clan-na-Gael, whose utterances were\r\nfrenzies of hatred. Large sums were subscribed; Irish servant-girls, with\r\na patriotism which in any case was honourable to them, giving freely of\r\ntheir wages. American politicians flattered the mania, and harvested the\r\nIrish vote. The war bequeathed to the Fenians some regular soldiers, among\r\nothers, Mitchel, who had been conspicuous in the ranks of slavery. The\r\nFenians invaded Canada and overthrew a corps of Canadian volunteers, but\r\nretired on the approach of regulars; a bad omen for their conquest of\r\nEngland. Conquest of England the Fenians did not attempt, beyond a\r\nfarcical essay at Chester. But they helped greatly to kindle rebellion in\r\nIreland, to provide it with money, and to supply it with assassins. The\r\nNational League, the form which, in Ireland, political combined with\r\nagrarian rebellion assumed, almost ousted the law and the queen's\r\ngovernment. It resisted the payment of rents. Those who opposed its will\r\nwere \"boycotted,\" a term of which this is the origin. Sometimes they were\r\nmurdered. A stripling was murdered for having served a master who had come\r\nunder the ban of the League. A wife was mobbed on her way home from\r\nviewing the body of her murdered husband. Lord Frederick Cavendish, the\r\nIrish secretary, going to Ireland with the kindest intentions, and the\r\npermanent secretary, Mr. Burke, were stabbed to death in the Phoenix\r\nPark. Mr. W. E. Forster, distinguished by his humane efforts at the time\r\nof the famine, was marked for assassination. At the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion a policeman escorting Fenian prisoners had been murdered at\r\nManchester, and an attempt made to blow up Clerkenwell Prison, where a\r\nFenian was confined, had caused the deaths of twelve people and the\r\nmaiming of one hundred and twenty. Gladstone had made the mistake of\r\ntreating the alarm caused by those outrages as a motive for doing justice\r\nto Ireland. The motive for doing justice to Ireland was justice.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Cavendish and Burke, it is right to say, was the act,\r\nnot of the Land League or of any conspiracy in Ireland itself, but of the\r\nInvincibles, a club of frenzied Irish in the United States. By the Irish\r\nleaders it was heartily condemned. That it was regarded with utter\r\nabhorrence in the Irish quarters of English cities was denied by observers\r\nat the time. Fierce and blind were the passions of those days.\r\n\r\nTo repress what was in fact a rebellion fed by foreign aid, to uphold the\r\nlaw, and rescue life and industry in Ireland from the lawless tyranny of\r\nthe National League, as it was called, the government, as was its plain\r\nduty, sought and obtained extraordinary powers, and threw a number of the\r\nleaders of the rebellion into prison. It was time, when loyal citizens\r\nwere joining the League for protection in their callings, which the\r\nqueen's government could no longer afford. When the Irish rose against the\r\ndraft in New York, the Americans shot down several hundreds of them\r\nwithout process of law.\r\n\r\nIn the British Parliament the \"rebel\" party, as Bright justly called it,\r\nhad found a leader of mark in Parnell, a man of great ability and force of\r\ncharacter, incisive and forcible, if not eloquent, as a speaker. He had\r\nsupplanted in the leadership Mr. Butt, a man of social sensibility and\r\nrefinement, unfitted for an aggressive part. The agitation under Parnell\r\ncombined agrarianism with repeal, thus giving the political part of the\r\nmovement a hold upon the people and a force and a formidable extension in\r\nIreland which by itself it had never had. The Land League, becoming the\r\nNational League, almost supplanted the queen's government in Ireland.\r\n\r\nParnell's avowed aim was the foundation of a peasant proprietorship.\r\nNeither he nor any of his party seem to have cared to study\r\ndispassionately the natural aptitudes of the country, and to satisfy\r\nthemselves whether it was capable of supporting the population which\r\ndisastrous events and sinister influences had accumulated upon it. Their\r\nmain object was political. It was, under the guise of repealing the union,\r\nto sever Ireland from Great Britain. As an inducement to the peasantry to\r\nsupport them in that attempt, they offered to transfer the property in the\r\nland from the landlord to the tenant, though with a decorous promise of\r\nindemnity. Mr. Parnell's name was English, and he had been educated at\r\nCambridge. It was understood that his bearing towards his Celtic\r\nassociates was high and that he was peremptory as well as absolute in\r\ncommand. At his side was Mr. Biggar, whose great gift was unparalleled\r\neffrontery. The two undertook to coerce the British Parliament by\r\nobstruction. Had the British Parliament been itself, it would quickly have\r\nasserted its dignity. But it was split into factions, upon the balance of\r\nwhich Parnell and Biggar were able to play. Gladstone succumbed so far as\r\nby an equivocal agreement, nicknamed the Kilmainham Treaty, to release\r\nParnell and his associates from prison. On the other hand, the\r\nConservatives coming into power struck the flag of the law by refusing to\r\nrenew the Crimes Act for the protection of loyalty in Ireland, while they\r\nangled for the Parnellite vote by casting reproach on the conduct of a\r\nlord-lieutenant who had done his duty.\r\n\r\nAt the general election which followed, Gladstone went to the country,\r\nappealing for a majority which should enable him to settle the Irish\r\nquestion independently of Parnell. Parnell passed the word to all his\r\npartisans, both in Ireland and in the Irish quarters of English towns, to\r\nvote against the Liberals. They obeyed. Gladstone was defeated. Then he\r\nwho had denounced Parnell as wading through rapine to dismemberment; who\r\nhad proclaimed his arrest as a rebel to an applauding multitude at\r\nGuildhall; who had thrown him and scores of his followers into prison; who\r\nhad never given to the nation a hint of his sympathy with Parnell's\r\nagitation, suddenly turned round and coalesced with Parnell. He put forth\r\nan apology for his conversion founded on the hidden workings of his own\r\nmind. But what availed the workings of his own mind if all the time he was\r\ncarrying on the policy of repression, misleading the nation thereby? It is\r\ntrue he might have pointed to the coquetting of the other party, or its\r\nleaders, with the Parnellites. He might perhaps with more force have\r\nappealed to his own unquestionably sincere sympathy with all who were\r\nstruggling for independence. His retrospective imagination was strong, and\r\nhaving changed so much he had always present to his mind the possibility\r\nof further change. It made his language sometimes capable of unforeseen\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal party was filled with astonishment, confusion, and dismay. But\r\nthe _Times_ stood fast and rallied the adherents of the union. To the\r\nsteadfastness and power of this great journal the defeat of Gladstone's\r\npolicy and the salvation of the union were largely due. Bright's refusal\r\nto cast in his lot with the \"rebel\" party was also a heavy blow to\r\nGladstone. The political connection between the two men had been growing\r\nclose, and Bright might almost be said to personify justice to Ireland, as\r\nto all the weak and oppressed. If there was a man who would have protested\r\nagainst the sacrifice of Ireland to English interests it was John Bright.\r\nLord Hartington presented himself with unexpected vigour as a Unionist\r\nleader. Gladstone was defeated in the House of Commons and still more\r\nsignally in the general election which followed, Conservative and Unionist\r\nLiberals voting together on the special issue. In the contest Gladstone\r\nlashed himself into fury, appealed to Separatist sentiment, not in Ireland\r\nonly, but in Scotland and Wales, to the prejudice of the masses against\r\nthe classes, of the uneducated against the educated and the learned\r\nprofessions. He was fired with enthusiasm for the right. His instincts\r\nwere always high. But this did not make him a cool-headed statesman warily\r\ndealing with a question which touched the life of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nNow fortune played a strange trick. Parnell, the leader and mainstay of\r\nthe League, Gladstone's ally, was convicted of adultery. Adultery is not\r\npolitical, but it was too much both for the Irish hierarchy and for the\r\nnonconformist conscience. Parnell had to be dragged from the helm of the\r\nIrish party, to which he clung with a frantic tenacity, such as proved him\r\nafter all to be, though a very remarkable, hardly a very great, man.\r\n\r\nRaised once more by another turn of fortune's wheel in the party game to\r\npower, Gladstone again brought forward a Home Rule Bill. This time he,\r\nwith the help of the Irish members, pushed the bill through the House,\r\npartly by closure, in a form already condemned by himself, giving Ireland\r\na separate Parliament for her own affairs, and at the same time retaining\r\nher representation in the British Parliament, with power there to vote\r\nupon all questions. The Irish delegation would have played, as in fact it\r\ndoes now, for its own purposes, on the balance of British parties, and\r\nbaffled any attempt to enforce restrictions on the doings of its own\r\nParliament which the Home Rule Act might have imposed. The majority for\r\nthe bill in the Commons was forty-three, including eighty Irish members.\r\nBritish members of the House of Commons who voted for the bill probably\r\nreckoned on its being killed in the Lords. Killed it was there with a\r\nvengeance. Gladstone appealed to the people against the Lords, but in\r\nvain. Thus ended in disaster his wonderful career. His speeches on Home\r\nRule showed, like all his speeches, vast oratoric power, mastery of\r\ndetails, clearness and liveliness in exposition. But weak points are also\r\napparent. The Irish Parliament cannot have been at once a sink of\r\ncorruption and an institution with which it was sacrilege to interfere.\r\nThe comparison of the union in criminality to the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew must surely have made all hearers but the Irish smile. Upon\r\nthis subject the speaker raves, and generally he forgets that the mission\r\nof reconciliation which he had undertaken would not be furthered by\r\nopening old sores. The examples of Austria-Hungary and the connection of\r\nNorway with Sweden, cited by him as proofs that a conjunction of two\r\nParliaments worked well, would be generally taken not as encouragements\r\nbut as warnings. The case of Norway and Sweden has since become a warning\r\nindeed. The intricate machinery by which the speaker proposes to regulate\r\nthe action of his two Parliaments has too much the look of a speculative\r\nstructure elaborated without reference to the peculiar state of Ireland\r\nand the forces to be encountered there. Of the force of the Catholic\r\npriesthood, nothing is said. In fact, the political architect knew little\r\nof the country with which he was dealing, having been in it only for three\r\nweeks, and then not at a good point of view.\r\n\r\nThus the Irish question, which the greatest among the public men of his\r\ntime had failed to settle, was once more thrown into the cauldron of party\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back on these most melancholy annals, we shall find that for their\r\ngeneral sadness Nature is as much to be blamed as man. She did well in\r\nplacing at the side of a country rich in coal and minerals, destined to be\r\nmanufacturing, one of pasture to supply food. She made a fatal mistake in\r\npeopling them with different and uncongenial races. War, in the age of\r\nwar, and conquest of the weaker by the stronger were sure to be the\r\nresult. For the form in which conquest came, the Papacy has partly to\r\nanswer. It used the sword of the Norman adventurer in this case, as it had\r\nin the case of England, to crush religious independence and force all\r\nchurches to bow to its own dominion, while, as the wails of its own\r\npartisans in the Becket controversy show, it was itself unworthy of the\r\nsovereignty of Christendom. Of this Catholics are bound to take note, as\r\nthey are of the fact that the Papacy at a later day, by inciting the Irish\r\nto rebellion on its own account, brought upon them no small portion of\r\ntheir woes. The Norman conquest of England had incidentally the bad\r\neffect of connecting the English monarchy with dominion in France, and\r\nthus turning the forces of the English kings from Ireland, where they\r\nmight have ended the agony, to a field where they were much worse than\r\nwasted. Things could not have taken a more unfortunate course than that of\r\na colony of half-civilized conquerors carrying on war with barbarous\r\ntribes of a different race and tongue, yet without force to effect the\r\nconquest. The invasion of Edward Bruce, with which England had nothing to\r\ndo, probably did further harm by breaking up whatever there was of\r\nAnglo-Norman order and turning barons into chiefs of Irish Septs. Then the\r\nReformation, a European convulsion involving Ireland, and in the most\r\nunfortunate way, since it identified Protestantism with conquest,\r\nCatholicism with the struggle for independence, introduced another deadly\r\nsource of strife, and made Ireland the point of danger to England in her\r\ndesperate struggle for her own existence and the salvation of the\r\nProtestant cause. Otherwise it seems not impossible that the Tudor\r\nstatesmen, with such a man as Burleigh at their head, might, as they\r\ndesired, have effected a peaceful settlement. Civilization, not\r\nextermination, was their aim. The great Celtic rebellions of Shane\r\nO'Neil, Desmond, and Tyrone, the last two Catholic as well as Celtic,\r\nforced upon them the policy of extermination with all its horrors. The\r\nrising and massacre of 1641 were the sequel. The vengeance of the victor\r\nand the transplantation of the vanquished to Connaught were in their turn\r\nthe sequel of the rising and massacre of 1641. Of these again the rebound\r\nwas the Catholic rising of 1688, which, had it been successful, would have\r\nended certainly in the dispossession, probably in the expulsion, possibly\r\nin the extermination, of the Protestants. English liberty and religion\r\nwere at the same time threatened by an Irish Catholic force encamped at\r\nHounslow. The Penal law was execrable; yet hardly more execrable than the\r\nGreat Act of Attainder. In later days Castle government by corruption was\r\nvile; but it was the inevitable accompaniment of the constitution of 1782,\r\nthe work of Grattan and the Volunteers. Of the master evil of all, the\r\nstate of the masses of the Irish people, English protectionism must share\r\nthe blame with the penal laws. But protectionism was then the delusion of\r\nthe commercial world. Irish patriots were not free from it. To deal with\r\npeasant distress was the immediate duty of the Irish Parliament, which\r\nrefused even to turn its eyes that way. Peasant distress, organized for\r\nrebellion by a revolutionary party at Belfast, itself deriving its\r\ninspiration from the American and French revolutions, produced the rising,\r\never to be accursed and deplored, of 1798.\r\n\r\nIrish patriots are apt to talk of England as a single person or, rather,\r\nfiend, actuated in her dealings with Ireland by hatred and contempt.\r\nEngland is a nation divided into parties and swayed by varying influences\r\nfrom time to time. The England of Peel and Gladstone is not the England of\r\nthe Georges, the Stuarts, the Tudors, the Plantagenets, or responsible for\r\nthe doings of those dynasties. In the evil days of her political history,\r\nEngland, if she oppressed Ireland, also suffered herself. The Liberal\r\nparty in England did its best for Ireland, and if the Irish members had\r\nbeen what they ought to have been and done what they ought to have done,\r\nmore rapid progress might have been made. As it was, Ireland shared the\r\ngreat measures of Parliamentary and municipal reform which there had been\r\nlittle prospect of her achieving by herself. She received the boon of\r\nnational and undenominational education about a generation before England,\r\nand but for the reactionary influence of her own priesthood would have\r\nreceived it in full measure. The same influence maimed as far as it could\r\nthe undenominational colleges. Nothing could be more deplorable than the\r\nlong series of coercion acts. But it was hardly to be expected that the\r\nEnglish government should strike its flag to assassination and boycotting,\r\nor that the British nation would be moved to concession by the inroads of\r\nAmerican conspirators combined with domestic rebellion. It was about 1866\r\nthat Guizot, talking of Ireland as he walked with an English guest,\r\nstopped in his walk and said with an emphatic gesture, \"The conduct of\r\nEngland to Ireland for the last thirty years has been admirable.\" This,\r\nbefore disestablishment, was too strong, as the English guest remarked at\r\nthe time; but as the judgment of a cool-headed foreign statesman, whose\r\ncourse had not been one of unbroken harmony with England, it was likely to\r\nbe more just at least to the motives of England than the invectives of\r\nO'Connell.\r\n\r\nSince the Union there has been no 1641, no 1688, no 1798. The two races\r\nand religions have lived generally at peace if not in concord with each\r\nother. The religious riots at Belfast are a very mitigated relic of the\r\nreligious wars of former days. Reform, though its advance has been slow\r\nand fitful, has advanced. Within a generation from the date of the Union,\r\nCatholic Emancipation was carried. The tithe-proctor did not very long\r\nsurvive. Presently the State Church itself was abolished. Ireland shared\r\nwith Great Britain Parliamentary reform, to which the Irish oligarchy\r\ncould never have consented without political and social convulsion. Not\r\nlong afterwards came national education, bestowed on Ireland before it was\r\nbestowed on England. None of these improvements would directly touch the\r\nagrarian sore, the malignity of which was increased by the growth of the\r\nIrish population under the reign of order, far beyond the power of the\r\nland to maintain it. But relief has been given to famine, and strenuous\r\nefforts have been made and are still being made to effect a radical cure.\r\nIreland has enjoyed free trade with Great Britain and with the whole\r\nBritish Empire. Everything has been open to Irish merit and industry.\r\nMillions of Irish and their children have found homes in Britain and the\r\ncolonies. To sever Ireland from Great Britain is still possible. To divide\r\nthe Irish from the British is not possible. In both islands and in all the\r\ncolonies the two races are now joined and cannot be put asunder.\r\n\r\nBesides, as has already been said, we must always bear it in mind that we\r\ndo not see the other side of Destiny's cards. Suppose Ireland had remained\r\nthe land of the Septs, would her lot certainly have been more happy?\r\nNeither at the time of the Norman Conquest nor afterwards do the Septs\r\nappear to have shown any tendency to a union such as would have given\r\nbirth to a national polity and its attendant civilization. For aught we\r\ncan see, they might have gone on indefinitely, like the clans of the\r\nScottish Highlands, in a state of barbarous strife fatal to progress of\r\nevery kind. Even their common interest in the struggle against the\r\nAnglo-Norman invader produced no general or permanent union. The Brehon\r\nlaw, which was their principal bond, had no executive force and was in\r\nitself barbarous, not distinguishing public from private wrong. The Septs\r\nwarred upon each other not less savagely than the conqueror warred upon\r\nthem all. If anything like union came at last, it was not political but\r\nreligious, and brought with it a fatal share in the European war of\r\nreligions. Nor were conquests other than Anglo-Norman impossible. From the\r\nHighlands and islands of Scotland came bodies of marauding adventurers\r\nwhich might have been reenforced, and, in the North at least, have\r\nprevailed. It is not certain that without the aid of John de Bermingham\r\nand his Anglo-Normans, the Septs would have got rid of Edward Bruce.\r\n\r\nThat the interest of Ireland should be regarded as subordinate to that of\r\nGreat Britain was the principle on which British politicians acted in the\r\ndays that are past. To the past this principle must now be and indeed has\r\nbeen decisively consigned. That union, to be good for either party, must\r\nbe good for both, is the accepted basis of discussion. On the other hand,\r\nit is not to be assumed that the aspirations of Irish politicians\r\nnaturally bent on carving out an independent field of action for\r\nthemselves, are entirely free from the bias of personal ambition or\r\nidentical with a dispassionate view of the interest of the Irish people.\r\nNor is it to be forgotten that Ulster is a part of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere are two questions, perfectly distinct and calling for separate\r\nconsideration, though they have become blended in the course and for the\r\npurposes of the political agitation. One is economical, the other\r\npolitical.\r\n\r\nThe economical question is whether Ireland can support her present\r\npopulation. Patriotic eloquence will not change her skies, or render it\r\notherwise than cruel to induce her people to stay in a land in which they\r\ncannot make their bread. Instances there may be of barren soil made by\r\nthe loving industry of the small owner fruitful and capable of supporting\r\na large population; but the industry of the small owner, though it can\r\nimprove the soil, cannot alter the skies. What is to be desired is a\r\nspecial report, calm and expert, upon this subject. Is Ireland generally\r\ncapable of being turned with advantage into an arable country? Can wheat\r\nor grain of any kind be profitably raised there in face of the competition\r\nof the great grain-growing countries such as that now opened, and bidding\r\nfair to be opened over a much larger area, in the Canadian Northwest? The\r\nsmall farmer to live must have something to sell. Is there reason to look\r\nin any other direction than farming for a speedy extension of Irish\r\nindustries such as would provide bread sufficient for the population? Is\r\nthe water-power of Ireland, now that electricity has been developed,\r\nlikely to do what has been done for England by coal? Is the shipping\r\ntrade, for which the Irishman has had little opportunity of showing a\r\nturn, likely to increase? These are questions which it is for economists,\r\nnot for politicians or patriotic orators, to decide. It is said that there\r\nare tracts of land in Ireland still unoccupied and fit for occupation. If\r\nthere are, the survey will show the fact. Land purchase by government\r\nsubvention is a policy hardly to be pursued unless it is certain that its\r\nresults will not presently be reversed by nature.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of emigration is that it carries away the pith and sinews\r\nof a nation, taking the strong and leaving the weak, the aged, and\r\nunsupported women. It is a pleasant proof, already noticed, of the warmth\r\nof the Irish heart that there has been less of solitary and more of family\r\nemigration in their case than in those of some other emigrating races.\r\nAfter all, how has the earth been peopled, how have all the nations been\r\nformed but by migration?\r\n\r\nTo turn to the political question. The danger of insurrection has probably\r\npassed away. Fenianism has been largely deprived of its trans-Atlantic\r\nbase, and can no longer look confidently to American sympathy for support\r\nand supplies. The Irish vote has less power. Little at least was heard of\r\nit in the last presidential election. Yet the political question is still\r\nmost serious, and presses urgently for settlement; a state of things\r\nlargely due to the division of parties in the British government which\r\nshowed its influence in the abandonment of the Crimes Act by the Salisbury\r\nadministration; in the Maamtrasna debate; and in Mr. Gladstone's sudden\r\ncoalition with Parnell; but above all in the votes of British members of\r\nthe House of Commons for Mr. Gladstone's second Home Rule Bill, giving\r\nIreland a Parliament of her own and representation in the British\r\nParliament at the same time. Parliament still has in it a body of Irish\r\nmembers not only alien but hostile, avowing that their object is not to\r\naid in deliberation but to coerce, playing upon the balance of parties for\r\npurposes of their own, degrading the assembly, and distracting the\r\ncouncils of the nation. Nor is the source of this evil confined to the\r\nconstituencies of Ireland. There is in England and Scotland a large Irish\r\npopulation, which, as was seen in the election of 1885, obeys the voice of\r\nthe Irish leaders and at their command votes inimically to the country in\r\nwhich it lives and earns its bread. In Ireland itself, moreover, the\r\nhell-broth of agitation is kept constantly seething to the inevitable\r\ndetriment of recuperative effort, which cannot do its full work without\r\nsecurity for the future.\r\n\r\nAs the first step it should be calmly settled what are the specific\r\ngrievances under which Ireland labours, and which the Imperial legislature\r\ncannot, but an Irish Parliament could, remove. Historic wrongs are past\r\nremedy. Ireland has more than her share of representation in Parliament.\r\nShe has no established Church. If her priesthood would let her, she would\r\nhave a complete system of national education. Her land law is now far more\r\nfavourable to the tenant than that of the other kingdoms, and she has been\r\nand still is receiving government subventions in aid of the tillers of her\r\nsoil which English and Scotch tenants do not receive and which would cease\r\nif she became independent. Nothing is closed against her people. They have\r\nthe markets of the whole Empire. All its offices, patronage, and services\r\nare perfectly open to them. So long as they will abstain from outrage and\r\nmurder, they enjoy all the personal privileges of British freemen. It\r\ncannot be said that the law has been suspended for any purpose other than\r\nthe repression of outrage. If the ordinary law and government were very\r\nbad, Ulster would hardly have prospered as it has done. If Castle\r\ngovernment is the grievance, abolition of it was offered to Ireland long\r\nago and was by her rejected. Let the existing grievances be specified, and\r\nlet it be seen whether Imperial legislation is incapable of redressing\r\nthem. The truth is that with the Irish leaders it has not been redress of\r\nparticular wrongs and grievances or the introduction of practical\r\nimprovements that has been the object of desire. Their aim has been to\r\ncreate a nationalist feeling which should end in political separation.\r\nSuch has been the constant tenor of their appeals to sentiment and the end\r\nto which their policy has really pointed.\r\n\r\nSuppose Ireland severed from Great Britain, what would be her lot? She\r\nwould then have to assume all the burdens and responsibilities of an\r\nindependent nation, including military and naval defence, as well as the\r\nentire expense of a separate government. As she could not hope to vie in\r\nstrength with her powerful neighbour, she would be at that neighbour's\r\nmercy; nor, considering the temper in which the parting would take place,\r\nwould occasions for quarrel be unlikely to arise. Ireland might have to\r\nseek the protection and become the vassal of some foreign power. Irish\r\ntrade would no longer be free of British markets or of the markets of\r\nBritish dependencies. Irish labour would no longer be free of the British\r\nlabour market. The Indian service and the Imperial services generally\r\nwould be closed against Irishmen.\r\n\r\nNor would Ireland be entirely united in herself or perfectly set free from\r\nthe hated British influence. She would still have in her the men of\r\nUlster, Saxon and Protestant, antagonistic probably to the Catholic\r\nmajority, and if they were pressed in the unequal conflict, stretching out\r\ntheir hands for aid to their fellow-Protestants and kinsmen in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nA mere arm of the sea, such as that which divides Ireland from Great\r\nBritain, is surely not enough in these days of improved navigation, to\r\nform a bar to political union. The distance from London to Dublin is now\r\npractically far less than it was a century ago from London to Edinburgh.\r\nNor does there seem any reason why salt water should be fatal. The Ionian\r\nIslands are in the kingdom of Greece; so probably some day will be Crete.\r\n\r\nIf Ireland were detached from Great Britain, into what hands would she\r\nfall? The gentry would be extinguished. To excite popular hatred of them\r\nas landlords has been the constant aim of the Nationalist leaders. There\r\nwould be a general repudiation of rent, which the Irish government and\r\njudiciary would lack the will, while the British government and judiciary\r\nwould have lost the power, to prevent. The record of Irish landlordism is\r\nnot bright. Absenteeism has been a great evil, though the estates of some\r\nabsentees have been notably well managed. There have been hideously cruel\r\nevictions, especially it seems on the lands purchased by speculators\r\nunder the Encumbered Estates Act. Landlordism, as mere drawing of rent, is\r\nan evil. It is not desirable that any man should own land as a\r\nnon-resident or own more land than he can manage or superintend. The old\r\nfeudal law attaching service to lordship of land was sound in principle.\r\nBut if the Irish gentry would accept that principle, be resident, look\r\nafter their estates, and do their duty to their tenants, they would\r\nprobably be accepted by their people as social leaders, and they might\r\nplay that part with good effect. The life of the French peasant is not the\r\nacme either of civilization or of happiness, even though we may make some\r\nabatement from the picture presented by Zola in \"La Terre.\" Unhappily the\r\ntendency, even in England, seems to be towards the detachment of the owner\r\nfrom his land and the abandonment on his part of every function save that\r\nof receiving the rent and spending it, perhaps in some pleasure city or\r\nabroad. The decadence of the agricultural interest in England is by some\r\nascribed to this cause.\r\n\r\nThe gentry being no more, Catholic Ireland would at first fall into the\r\nhands of the priesthood. The moral character of the Irish priesthood in\r\nthe opinion of impartial judges is high, as is that of the priesthood of\r\nFrench Canada. In both cases ecclesiastical influence is strong, and in\r\nboth a population virtuous after the Catholic model is the result. The two\r\nare probably about the best things that the Roman Catholic Church has to\r\nshow. But the Roman Catholic religion is mediaeval. The training of its\r\nministers inevitably shuts out light which would be fatal to mediaeval\r\nbelief. An Irish peasant lad, having been intellectually secluded for\r\nseven years at Maynooth, comes out proof against the intellectual\r\ninfluences and advancing science of his time. He is the mental liegeman\r\nand the preacher of the Syllabus, which anathematizes freedom of thought\r\nand claims for the Church dominion, not only over the soul but over the\r\nbody, such as was hers in the Middle Ages. He laid his ban on the Queen's\r\nColleges, and has discouraged and thwarted the extension of popular\r\neducation. In regard to education and intelligence, he has been in Ireland\r\nwhat he has been in Spain and other countries subject to his sway. In the\r\nsphere of industry and commerce the influence has generally been the same.\r\nThe religious ideal of life with its Church festivals and Saints' Days has\r\nprevailed. In Ireland as in Canada the priest inculcates early marriages,\r\nthe effects of which may be morally good but are economically perilous.\r\nThe excessive conversion of the fruits of industry to the unproductive\r\npurposes of the Church has already begun to call forth protests.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Roman Catholic priesthood would be encountered by the\r\nstalwart Protestantism of Ulster in the Parliamentary arena as it still is\r\nsometimes in the streets of Belfast. It might presently find itself\r\nencountered by another adversary, revolutionary Nationalism, the heir of\r\nthat party of force which broke away from the leadership of O'Connell, the\r\ndevout son of the Church, and was an object of well-founded suspicion and\r\naversion to the hierarchy of his day. The affinity of this element is to\r\nthe revolutionary party in other countries; and if, like the United\r\nIrishmen of Belfast, it has been willing to act with allies devoted to the\r\nChurch, it is not itself devout, as the Church, if she comes to share\r\npower with it, may be led to feel.\r\n\r\nThe idea of unity of race as a basis of Irish nationality has little\r\nsupport. In the North there is a strong and masterful Saxon element. There\r\nmust be a large Anglo-Saxon and English element in the old Pale. The men\r\nof Tipperary, though characteristically Irish, are believed to be\r\ndescendants of Cromwellians. There is Huguenot blood.\r\n\r\nThe revival of Erse as a national language is surely a patriotic dream.\r\nHow is it possible to revive a language all but dead, with no valuable\r\nliterature or wealth of printed books, in face of a language which has a\r\ngrand literature, is spoken by all the educated classes, indeed almost\r\nuniversally, in Ireland, and is necessary for intercourse with Great\r\nBritain. O'Connell, we are told, had no great sympathy with the revival of\r\nIrish archaeology, and no sympathy at all with the project of reviving the\r\nIrish language. He recognized the superior utility of the English tongue\r\nas the medium of all modern communication, and saw without regret the\r\ngradual disuse of Erse. Fancy and sentiment may prevail among a literary\r\nclass which nevertheless will hardly carry its patriotism so far as to\r\ndarken its own mind by unlearning English.\r\n\r\n\"Ireland ought to be governed in accordance with Irish ideas.\" Such is the\r\ncurrent saying, and it sounds wise. But statesmanship would hardly act\r\nupon it before taking measures to learn what ideas are peculiarly Irish\r\nand whether they are features of national character, innate and indelible,\r\nand not traces of historic accident or fancies instilled in the course of\r\npolitical agitation. The perpetuation of weaknesses accidentally\r\ncontracted cannot be wise for man or nation. The political idea which\r\nseems most characteristic is the tendency to personal leadership rather\r\nthan to self-government or constitutional rule. But this has been common\r\nto all races in early times. It was fostered and prolonged by the\r\ncircumstances of Irish history. It could hardly be pronounced incapable of\r\nmodification by familiarity with free institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the political constitution of an independent Ireland? How\r\nwould its form be settled? The political training of the people generally\r\nsince they came out of political thraldom has been agitation against\r\ngovernment and law; their only notion of rule has been personal. Nor is a\r\nhierarchy friendly to political liberty. To set up a stable democracy in\r\nIreland, if that is the aim of the revolutionary party, would surely be an\r\narduous undertaking.\r\n\r\nAll who look coolly into the matter apart from faction and its necessities\r\nhave pronounced that the choice lies between separation and legislative\r\nunion. Two Parliaments, two nations; so all wisdom says and so experience\r\nbefore the Union proved. The forces which under Grattan's constitution\r\nheld the two Parliaments together in strained and precarious fellowship,\r\nthe nomination boroughs, the pension list, the sinecures, the peerages,\r\nthe bishoprics, would no longer exist. What is even more important, there\r\nwould no longer be an oligarchical and exclusionist Parliament in Ireland\r\ndependent on British support for its ascendency, perhaps even for the\r\nsecurity of its lands. Antagonism would almost inevitably ensue; the more\r\nsurely as the partners would set out with the embitterment of a divorce.\r\nNothing apparently could avert collision; the result of which would be\r\nrepression, making the latter end worse than the first.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of federation is surely preposterous. It would be necessary\r\nfirst to cut the United Kingdom in two and create an Irish government in\r\norder that negotiations for a federal union might be set on foot. But how\r\ncould there be a federation of two states, one of them enormously superior\r\nin power to the other? What sort of deliberative assembly would the\r\nfederal council be?\r\n\r\nAnother plan is to form a federation of the four nationalities, as they\r\nare assumed to be, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales; wrenching apart\r\nthe members of a great nation which have long been united and cancelling\r\nthe highest work of British statesmanship. Here again federation could not\r\nwork. England being so much the predominant partner, the result would\r\nalmost certainly be a perpetual league of the three minor powers against\r\nher domination. The federal system is applicable only to a group of\r\ntolerably equal States. The restoration of the Heptarchy with the addition\r\nof Scotland, divided into Highland and Lowland, and the four provinces of\r\nIreland erected into States, would be a comparatively practicable system.\r\nThe present condition of the Federal system in the United States does not\r\nencourage experiments of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe mildest proposal of all is devolution; in other words, the concession\r\nto Ireland of a larger measure of local self-government. This probably\r\nwould be readily granted to any extent compatible with supremacy of law\r\nand security of life and property, which no government without abdicating\r\nits plainest duty can forgo. Gradual extension of local self-government\r\nwould not entail any acute crisis or bring on any party conflict. The\r\nLord-lieutenancy, Parliament has already shown itself ready to abolish. It\r\nwas in deference to the wish of Ireland that it has been retained. The\r\nonly thing in the way of undue centralization of which, so far as the\r\nwriter remembers, his Irish friends complained, was the necessity of\r\ncarrying Irish causes to Westminster as the final court of appeal.\r\nWhether concession on this point would be feasible it is for legal\r\nauthorities to say.\r\n\r\nHowever, it can hardly be doubted that in the course of this struggle a\r\nsentiment has been cultivated among the people of Ireland for which it is\r\nwise as well as kind in some way to provide satisfaction. The Irishman\r\nbeing of lively sensibility and impressible through sight has never seen\r\nthe power which really governs him. A session or two of the Imperial\r\nParliament held at Dublin for the settlement of Irish questions would\r\nprobably have had a very good effect, but it was thought to entail too\r\nmuch inconvenience. Would there be any objection to empowering the Irish\r\nmembers of both Houses to sit annually at Dublin as a preparatory House of\r\nIrish legislation framing bills to be commended to Parliament? There would\r\nthen be something in College Green. The experiment would involve none of\r\nthe difficulties or perils of a statutory division of the powers of\r\nParliament. It would be at first on the footing of an experiment, nor\r\nwould it preclude further concessions if further concessions should be\r\nfound needful.\r\n\r\nWith the question of national character, social or industrial, and its\r\nspecial requirements, I do not pretend to deal. It has been treated\r\nsystematically, perhaps for the first time, by an excellent authority,\r\nSir Horace Curzon Plunkett, in his \"Ireland in the New Century.\" Of Irish\r\ncharacter a part may be aboriginal and fundamental. A part probably is the\r\nresult of historical accident more or less ingrained, and probably capable\r\nof modification. I am told that Irish character has been even acquiring a\r\nmore serious cast since I watched the Tipperary steeplechases or stood on\r\nthe fair-ground of Ballinasloe. Not a little, so far as the masses are\r\nconcerned, is probably the work of a priesthood strongly and inherently\r\nreactionary, which has exercised the same influence on the ideal of life,\r\ncharacter, mind, and industry here as in other Catholic countries. Ireland\r\nis perhaps happy in having been cut off from the prodigious development of\r\nluxury and dissipation which, as social writers tell us, has been taking\r\nplace on the other side of the Channel as well as from the domination of\r\nthe stock-exchange. She may in this way become a saving element in the\r\nsocial character of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIs it vain to hope that for the settlement of a question so vital party\r\nmay for one short hour suspend its war? What far-off object of\r\naggrandizement can be half so important as a contented and loyal Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE IRISH LAND CODE\r\n\r\nBY HUGH J. MCCANN, B.L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish landlord, poor as his circumstances were before the famine, was\r\nin many instances reduced to sorer straits after the terrible scourge had\r\npassed away. The good landlord, anxious to do his duty by his tenants,\r\nhelped them as far as his mortgages and other financial burdens would\r\nallow. The tyrannical one, regardless of the sufferings of his victims,\r\nsought to extract impossible rents from an unfortunate tenantry who had\r\nscarcely the means of subsistence. The Encumbered Estates Act, it was\r\nthought, would relieve the tension. It empowered a court specially\r\nconstituted for the purpose to order the sale of estates encumbered with\r\ndebt, on the petition of any person sufficiently interested as owner or\r\ncreditor.\r\n\r\nLandlordism, it was thought, would, by this act, be relieved of much that\r\nmade it tyrannical, even when it meant well. But the act was a failure. It\r\nwas worse. It was the means of wrecking many a fortune, and driving many\r\na proprietor to ruin. Men who, in hard times, were doing well for their\r\ntenants and their country under difficult circumstances were driven from\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe act came into operation towards the end of 1849. A wild rush was made\r\nby creditors to the court. Prices fell with amazing rapidity, and landed\r\nproperty became a drug in the market. Valuable properties failed to\r\nrealize sufficient to meet the mortgages, and their owners were inevitably\r\nruined.\r\n\r\nA new class of landlord now appeared on the scene in the person of the\r\nspeculator, who bought up the bankrupt properties as they presented\r\nthemselves. The new proprietors had nothing in common with their tenantry.\r\nThey knew little of their needs and requirements and cared less. They had\r\nbut one interest and that was a commercial one. To make their properties\r\nrealize a good dividend on their outlay was their one concern, and up went\r\nthe rents accordingly. Such was the fate of the unfortunate tenants who\r\nwere allowed to continue as tenants of the new proprietor. This was bad\r\nenough, but those that were given notice to quit were even more cruelly\r\nwronged. Compensation for wrongful disturbance was not recognized in\r\nIreland in 1850, and tenant property amounting to three millions sterling\r\nwas sold to pay the landlord's creditors.\r\n\r\nNothing could demonstrate more clearly how utterly rotten was the whole\r\nland system in Ireland at the time. Landlord and tenant alike were in a\r\nmiserable plight. Rents fell heavily in arrear, and evictions were the\r\norder of the day. The landlord played the bold game, struck hard, and\r\nwithout mercy. The tenant sought protection in combination and conspiracy.\r\nSuch was the condition of Ireland when thoughtful men sought by\r\nlegislation to cure the crying evils of the time. Many remedies were\r\nproposed between 1850 and 1860, but none of them reached the stage of\r\nlegislative enactment. In the latter year, however, Cardwell made an\r\nattempt to place the law of landlord and tenant on a better footing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a good deal of opposition, government succeeded in placing two\r\nimportant measures on the Statute Book, viz.: the Landed Property\r\n(Ireland) Improvement Act, 1860, and the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment\r\nAct (Ireland) of the same year. By the former limited owners were enabled,\r\nsubject to judicial sanction, to charge the inheritance with the cost of\r\nspecified improvements, and to bind their successors for stated periods.\r\nAgricultural leases for a period of twenty-one years or less could be\r\ngiven by the limited owners without judicial intervention, but every\r\nimprovement lease required the sanction of the chairman of the county in\r\nwhich the lands were situated.\r\n\r\nTo tenants the right of compensation was granted for certain specified\r\nimprovements made by them, provided that before entering on the\r\nimprovements they made them the subject of an agreement with the landlord,\r\nor had given notice of his intention to improve, and the landlord had not\r\nnotified his objection within a period of three months from receipt of the\r\nnotice. The principle of retrospective compensation was not, as yet,\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nThe second act consolidated the existing law of landlord and tenant, and\r\nmade some important changes in procedure.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of landlord and tenant, hitherto based on _tenure_, as in\r\nEngland, was henceforth to be founded on _contract_.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to examine its provisions, it might be well to point out\r\nthat the common law rights of Irish agricultural tenants were in the\r\nabsence of special customs governed since the reign of James I. by English\r\ncommon law rules. The English system of land tenure was imposed upon the\r\ncountry by virtue of conquest. But the circumstances of the two countries\r\nwere entirely different.\r\n\r\nIn England the landlord owned the soil and everything on it. The dwelling\r\nhouses and out-offices, the farm roads, the drainage, were built by him or\r\nhis predecessors. He let a holding to a tenant as a going concern, and for\r\nthe holding so equipped he received rent. The relations between landlord\r\nand tenant in England rested on a business footing. If the tenant did not\r\nfeel satisfied with his farm or his lot, he moved on. There were none of\r\nthe ties there, either of attachment or of interest, that existed in\r\nIreland. In Ireland the tenant or his predecessor provided, by his labours\r\nor his savings, the whole equipment of the farm. His family for\r\ngenerations back occupied the same plot, and he dearly learned to know and\r\nlove every stone and hedge about the place. In England the improvements\r\nwere effected by the landlord out of the rent paid him by the tenant, and,\r\nof course, were legally his by the law of the land. In Ireland the\r\nimprovements, almost universally made by the tenant, became at common law\r\nthe property of the landlord, who was under no _legal_ obligation to\r\ncompensate the tenant for them on ejecting him from his holding. The\r\nfollowing extract from the report of the Devon Commission contrasts the\r\npractice in the two countries very well. \"The Commission finds on all\r\nhands, it is admitted, that, according to the general practice in Ireland,\r\nthe landlord builds neither dwelling-house nor farm-offices, nor puts\r\nfences, gates, etc., into good order before he lets his land to a tenant.\r\nThe cases in which a landlord does any of those things are the exceptions.\r\nThe system, however, of giving aid in these matters is becoming more\r\nprevalent. In most cases whatever is done in the way of building is done\r\nby the tenant, and in the ordinary language of the country\r\ndwelling-houses, farm-buildings, and even the making of the fences are\r\ndescribed by the general word 'improvements,' which is thus employed to\r\ndenote the necessary adjuncts to a farm, without which in England or\r\nScotland no tenant would be found to rent it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I have said represents the general, but, I should add, not the\r\nuniversal, condition of things in Ireland at this time.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the country, especially in Ulster, certain customs prevailed\r\nwhich recognized that a tenant was something more than a rent producer.\r\nThey denied the right of the landlord to raise rents by reason of any\r\nvalue added to the soil by the tenant's outlay. They recognized a right of\r\ncontinuous occupancy by the tenant at a fair rent. This right, called\r\ntenant right, became on some properties of immense value, and was often\r\nsold by an out-going tenant at a price exceeding in value the fee simple\r\npurchase of the holding. In Ulster more than anywhere else in Ireland the\r\ncustom was very widely prevalent, but was as yet without the sanction of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nBut I have digressed from the Act of 1860. In dealing with the Act of\r\n1870, what I have just said will be of importance. The Landlord and Tenant\r\nAct, 1860, otherwise known as \"Deasy's Act,\" is a voluminous measure of\r\none hundred and five sections which may be conveniently grouped into three\r\nsections. The first deals with the _Contract of Tenancy_, the second with\r\n_Surrenders and Assignments_, and the third with the _Methods of\r\nProcedure_. Section three enacts that \"the relation of landlord and tenant\r\nshall be deemed to be founded on the express or implied contract of the\r\nparties.\" The conduct of the parties may imply a contract of tenancy,\r\npayment of rent being evidence, but not irrefutable evidence, of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nSection four requires that \"every lease or contract, with respect to\r\nlands whereby the relations of landlord and tenant is intended to be\r\ncreated for any freehold estate or interest, or for any definite period of\r\ntime, not being from year to year, or any lesser period, shall be by\r\n_deed_ executed, or _note in writing_ signed by the landlord or his\r\nagent.\" It is further provided that a tenant may, if there be no agreement\r\nto the contrary, remove his fixtures within two months of its\r\ndetermination by an uncertain event. Two covenants are implied in the\r\ncontract of tenancy by each of the parties thereto. The landlord by his\r\nlease implies an agreement on the part of himself and his successors that\r\nhe has a good title to make it, and that the tenant shall have quiet and\r\npeaceable enjoyment of his holding.\r\n\r\nThe tenant agrees to pay rent, taxes, and impositions payable by the\r\ntenant, and to keep the premises in good and substantial repair and\r\ncondition; and, secondly, to give up peaceable possession of the demised\r\npremises in good and substantial repair and condition on the determination\r\nof the lease, subject to any right of removal or of compensation for\r\nimprovements that may have lawfully arisen in respect of them, and to any\r\nright of surrender in case of the destruction of the subject-matter of the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n_Surrenders and Assignments_ may be made (1) by deed, (2) by a note in\r\nwriting, or (3) by operation of law.\r\n\r\nSections forty-five to one hundred and two deal with actions for the\r\nrecovery of rent and actions of ejectment. The most important provision is\r\nthat which provides that if a tenant has had a decree given against him in\r\nan action of ejectment, he may be restored to his holding on applying to\r\nthe court within six months, and paying the rent with arrears and costs.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main features of Deasy's Act. Beyond consolidating and\r\nregularizing the existing law it achieved nothing. A decided advance,\r\nhowever, was made in the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870, which\r\nwas restricted in its operation to agricultural and pastoral tenancies. We\r\nhave seen how there existed in Ulster and other parts of the country\r\ncertain customs favourable to the tenant. To the Ulster custom, as it was\r\ncalled, Ulster was indebted for exceptional prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe contentment of its agricultural population was in strange contrast to\r\nthe seething discontent of the other parts of the country. Much of the\r\nthrift and plenty that exists in parts of Ulster to-day can be traced back\r\nto the exceptional treatment accorded to the tenants of Ulster long\r\nbefore legislation came to the aid of their less fortunate brethren south\r\nof the Boyne. The aim of the Land Act of 1870 was to place the latter\r\nclass in a similar position to the Northerns. The act legalized the Ulster\r\ncustom and similar usages. It gave tenants not subject to these a right to\r\nbe compensated for their improvements on quitting their holdings, and\r\nguaranteed a measure of security by providing compensation for\r\ndisturbance. What is \"disturbance\" is a question for the court, and must\r\nbe decided on the facts of each particular case.\r\n\r\nAgreements not to improve the holding, or not to claim for improvements,\r\nare declared void. If the holding be subject to the Ulster custom, there\r\nis a general presumption that the improvements belong to the tenant.\r\n\r\nThe term \"improvements\" shall mean in relation to a holding (1) any work\r\nwhich, being executed, adds to the letting value of the holding, on which\r\nit is executed and is suitable to such holding; and (2) tillages, manures,\r\nor other like farming works, the benefit of which is unexhausted at the\r\ntime of the tenant quitting his holding.\r\n\r\nWe have not proceeded far before it becomes apparent that to secure to the\r\ntenant the full enjoyment of his own property was the line along which\r\nland legislation was travelling. The Act of 1870 went some distance in\r\nthis direction. But the great advance was not made till ten years after,\r\nwhen Gladstone proposed to establish a tribunal which would assess and fix\r\nthe property of the two partners in the dual ownership of land in Ireland.\r\nThe act recognized and legalized dual ownership. It created a partnership\r\nbetween two parties whose interests were hostile. It was a great act, and\r\ndid incalculable good, but many years were not to elapse until it became\r\nevident that a return to single ownership--but this time by the\r\ntenant--was absolutely necessary. The endeavours to work dual ownership\r\nirretrievably broke down.\r\n\r\nBoth parties had little confidence in the Land Court established by the\r\nAct of 1881.\r\n\r\nThe landlord complained that his property was being confiscated; the\r\ntenant believed that he was still paying rent on his own improvements. The\r\nact was meant to give tenants fixity of tenure, fair rent, and free sale.\r\nA new judicial body, the Irish Land Commission, with jurisdiction to hear\r\nand determine all matters of law or fact arising under the act, was\r\nestablished. The commission consists of three commissioners--one a\r\njudicial commissioner and numerous assistant commissioners appointed by\r\nthe lord lieutenant for the time being with the approval of the treasury.\r\nThis is not the place to examine the provisions of this complicated\r\nmeasure minutely, but as it is the foundation of much of the land\r\nlegislation that followed, it is important that its main provisions be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe act distinguishes between \"present\" tenancies and \"future\" tenancies,\r\na \"present\" tenancy being \"a tenancy subsisting at the time of the passing\r\nof the act, or created before the first day of January, 1883, in a holding\r\nin which a tenancy was subsisting at the time of the passing of the act,\r\nand every tenancy to which the act applies shall be deemed to be a present\r\ntenancy until the contrary is proved.\"\r\n\r\nA \"future\" tenancy means a tenancy beginning after the passing of the act.\r\nThe act applies only to agricultural and pastoral holdings. It gives\r\nqualified powers to both \"present\" and \"future\" tenants to dispose of\r\ntheir holdings for the best price they can get, or to mortgage them if\r\nthey think fit.\r\n\r\nFixity of tenure was secured by enabling a tenant to convert his interest\r\ninto what is called in the act a _statutory term_. Such a term may be\r\ncreated by an agreement between the landlord and tenant for an increased\r\nrent, or by having a fair rent fixed, or by filing in court an agreement\r\nfor a judicial rent. A _statutory term_ can be created only in respect of\r\na \"present\" tenancy except when in regard to a \"future\" tenancy the tenant\r\nhas agreed with the landlord to an increased rent. The provisions as to\r\nthe fixing of a fair rent apply only to \"present\" tenancies. Section three\r\nof the act gives a tenant power to dispose of his holding by bequest.\r\nPerhaps the most important provisions of the act are those enabling a\r\nlandlord or tenant to have a \"fair rent\" fixed.\r\n\r\nEither party may apply to the court to have the rent made a _judicial\r\nrent_. The court fixes this rent after considering all the circumstances\r\nof the case, holding, and district, and having regard to the interests of\r\nboth parties. No rent shall be payable in respect of improvements made by\r\nthe tenant unless he has been already compensated for them by the\r\nlandlord. In the administration of the act the word \"improvements\" has\r\ngiven rise to endless litigation. In the now famous case of Adams _v._\r\nDunseath it was held that \"improvements\" meant improvement works and not\r\nincreased letting value. It was also held in a case affecting the same\r\nholding that a tenant is entitled to \"a fair return by way of annual\r\nallowance in respect of the present capital value of his improvement works\r\nwhich may be estimated by way of percentage on such capital value; and if\r\nafter making this percentage there is still a surplus of increased letting\r\nvalue, it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Land Commission to\r\ndetermine whether, and in what proportions, such surplus shall be divided\r\nbetween landlord and tenant.\" It was further laid down that the Land\r\nCommission was to treat \"the latent and dormant resources of the soil, as\r\nlet by the landlord to the tenant, as the property of the landlord, and\r\nthe development of those resources by the tenant as the act of the\r\ntenant.\"\r\n\r\nThis act was undoubtedly a great charter for the tenants and created\r\nsomething like a revolution in Ireland. It contained many defects, and was\r\nmarred by many blemishes, but on the whole it was a masterly attempt to\r\nsettle the question. Like much of the land legislation for Ireland, most\r\nof its shortcomings were due to a reckless disregard on the part of\r\nBritish ministers for Irish opinion. Indeed, this was the cause of most of\r\nthe amending legislation that followed.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act of 1881 \"fair rents\" were fixed for periods of fifteen\r\nyears, when they were again ripe for revision. Roughly speaking, the old\r\nnon-judicial rents were reduced by twenty per cent on an average to\r\nconvert them into first term rents. These again were further reduced by\r\ntwenty per cent on an average for the second term. This, of course, played\r\nhavoc with the landlord's income, and did not materially benefit the\r\ntenant, the prices of the produce of whose farm was falling with even\r\ngreater rapidity. The experiment of dual ownership had been tried and was\r\nfound wanting; a return to single ownership was sought for by the series\r\nof acts known as the Land Purchase Acts.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1885 that the experiment of land purchase was seriously\r\ntried in Ireland, but it is right to say that the question first came\r\nbefore the public in a practical form so far back as 1869 in the\r\ndiscussions on the disestablishment of the Irish Episcopal Church. At that\r\ntime Mr. Bright proposed to increase the number of owners of land in\r\nIreland by allowing the glebe tenants to purchase the property attached to\r\nthe glebes. The idea was embodied in the Irish Church Act, and over six\r\nthousand occupying owners were thus created. Under this act three-fourths\r\nof the purchase money was advanced by the State, and the balance paid in\r\ncash by the purchasers. The money was advanced by the State for\r\nthirty-two years, the shortest period allowed by any of the acts. From the\r\ntenant's point of view this act cannot be said to have been an unqualified\r\nsuccess. The price of land was high at the time, and the purchasers having\r\nbought high sustained the whole burden of the sudden fall in the prices of\r\nproduce which almost immediately succeeded the conclusion of their\r\nbargains. In 1870 and in 1881 there were embodied in the acts of these\r\nyears provisions to enable tenants to purchase their holdings; but the\r\nprocedure to be followed was made so complicated that the tenants did not\r\navail themselves of the purchase clauses to any great extent. The\r\ninsignificant number of sixteen hundred sales were completed under the two\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 a Conservative government came into power, and though their term\r\nof office was of short duration, they introduced and passed a measure\r\nwhich, by its marvellous and, I might add, its unexpected success, pointed\r\nthe direction and paved the way for all future legislation for the\r\nsettlement of the land problem in Ireland. Back to single ownership was\r\nthe keynote of the measure. Hitherto the credit or discredit of all\r\nlegislation on the land problem belonged to the Liberals. They strove to\r\nmake dual ownership a possibility. Conservative statesmen sought for a\r\nsettlement in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIn sales under all the purchase acts from 1885 to the Act of 1903 all the\r\npurchase money is advanced by the State to the selling landlord, and is\r\ncharged by the State to the tenant who purchases. The tenant repays the\r\namount borrowed or \"advanced,\" to use the language of the acts, in annual\r\ninstalments, which instalments clear off not only the original \"advance,\"\r\nbut the accumulated interest.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the procedure is this. The landlord and tenant, having\r\nagreed on a price, sign an agreement for sale, and file it with the Land\r\nCommission, which body has the carriage, so to speak, of all purchase\r\ntransactions, as well as all other transactions under the land acts. The\r\nholding is inspected by the Land Commission which, having been satisfied\r\nthat the land in question is security for the \"advance,\" pay the purchase\r\nmoney to the landlord and collect from the tenant the annual instalments\r\nnecessary to repay it to the State.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Act of 1885, better known as the Ashbourne Act from the\r\nfact that it was Lord Ashbourne who introduced the measure to the lords,\r\nwas simple in the extreme, and to this is due, in no small measure, its\r\nrapid success. It was easily understood by the people, and so popular did\r\nit become that in three years the money provided by it was completely\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a second bill was passed under which an additional sum of five\r\nmillions--this was the amount provided by the Ashbourne Act--was set aside\r\nfor purchase. Under the two measures 25,368 owners were created.\r\n\r\n\"Almost from the start,\" writes Mr. George Fottrell (a gentleman well\r\nqualified to discuss the question of land purchase in Ireland) in the\r\n_Morning Post_, \"the Ashbourne Act was a success. During the first five\r\nyears of its working, the 'advances' actually paid over by the Land\r\nCommission to landlords amounted annually on an average to L1,250,000\r\nsterling. The 'applications' represented a considerably larger sum. By\r\n1887 they had more than exhausted the L5,000,000 which had been voted by\r\nParliament for the Ashbourne Act, in 1885, and thereon a further sum of\r\nL5,000,000 was voted. The scheme continued to work well; the\r\n'applications' came in steadily but with no feverish haste, the largest\r\ntotal sum applied for under the Ashbourne Act in any one year being in\r\n1887 when it reached L3,700,000. In each of the next two years it reached\r\njust two millions. In 1890 it had dropped to less than a million and a\r\nhalf; in 1891 it was slightly in excess of that amount. By 1891 it was\r\nplain that the second vote of five millions had been virtually absorbed,\r\nand that Parliament must be applied to for further money. To cool-headed\r\npeople in Ireland it seemed that the obvious course was to ask for a small\r\ngrant, say of ten millions, so as to continue to test cautiously the\r\nusefulness of an act which had so far worked well, while by the very\r\nsmallness of the grant keeping in reserve a check on the expansion of the\r\nact if it should prove to work mischievously.\r\n\r\n\"This course was not taken. In 1891 Parliament was asked to make a much\r\nlarger grant. Over thirty millions were voted, but coupled with conditions\r\nwhich made the money useless.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour's act, the Purchase Act of 1891, was extremely complicated.\r\nUnder it Ireland was entitled to draw upon Imperial credit to the extent\r\nof L33,000,000. The rate of interest payable by the purchasers was\r\nsubstantially the same as under the acts of 1885 and 1888, the period of\r\nrepayment in the three cases being forty-nine years.\r\n\r\nBut a change was made in the method of payment to the landlord. Previous\r\nto 1891, he had been always paid in cash. Under the Balfour Act he was\r\npaid in guaranteed land stock. There were many complicated provisions in\r\nregard to the creation of a guarantee fund, an insurance fund, and other\r\nsafeguards. The complexity of the measure and the procedure under it, and\r\nthe consequent delays in completing any transactions in a reasonable time,\r\nacted as a deterrent to intending purchasers and the act was virtually a\r\nfailure. At this point it is well, perhaps, to summarize the results of\r\nthe working of land purchase under the acts already dealt with. We have\r\nseen that a total sum of (say) L44,000,000 was made available by the\r\nvarious acts for land purchase. Out of this a total sum of L21,182,268 has\r\nbeen expended, leaving about twenty-three millions still available. Under\r\nall the acts up to and including that of 1891, 62,241 tenants purchased\r\ntheir holdings, 6057 under the Church Act, 877 under the Land Act of 1870,\r\n731 under the Act of 1881, 25,368 under the Purchase Acts of 1885 and\r\n1888, and the balance of about 30,000 became purchasers by means of the\r\nAct of 1891.\r\n\r\nNumerous and extensive as these operations were, it is satisfactory to\r\nnote, and it redounds to the credit of the Irish people, that Mr.\r\nWyndham, when introducing his Land Bill of 1902, was able to assure the\r\nHouse of Commons that Irish Land Purchase had this one merit that the\r\nState had incurred no loss under it and was exposed to no risk. In no case\r\ndid an Irish tenant break his bargain. There was no case of bad debt to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nOne of the first stumbling-blocks to a tenant proposing to purchase under\r\nthe Act of 1891 was that he was unable to know, or even approximately\r\ngauge, what was the actual sum he would have to pay, by way of annuity,\r\neach year. This was a serious flaw, and helped more than anything else\r\nperhaps to clog the wheels of purchase. This state of things, however, was\r\nremedied by the Purchase Act of 1896, by which the maximum sum payable in\r\nany year was an instalment at the rate of L4 per cent on the purchase\r\nmoney, no matter at what number of years' purchase of his rent the tenant\r\nmight buy. Most of the cumbrous restrictions of the Act of 1891 were\r\nremoved, and once more the applications began to tumble in. In 1895-1896\r\nthe applications received numbered less than half a million. In 1897-1898\r\nand in 1898-1899 they reached nearly two millions. A steady decrease then\r\nset in, but on the whole purchase proceeded at a satisfactory pace.\r\n\r\nA strange condition of things now existed in Ireland, and a condition of\r\nthings that could not last. Here and there over the country there existed\r\na contented peasantry, the virtual owners of their holdings, paying a\r\nreasonable annuity for a definite period to the State. If they had not the\r\nsense of complete ownership, they had the very next best thing to it. They\r\nknew that if they themselves were not the absolute owners of their\r\nholdings during their lives, their children and their children's children\r\nwould be, and they set to work with a heart and a will to work and improve\r\ntheir farms, knowing full well that the results of their labour would, at\r\nlast, be theirs, and could not be wrung from them by the whims or\r\nexigencies of the landlord. On the other side of the fence, or river, the\r\ntenant who had not purchased and, perhaps, could not purchase, for his\r\nlandlord would not sell, continued to pay a rent sometimes exorbitant, but\r\nalways higher than his friend the purchaser close by. Such was the\r\nposition of the tenant's side of the question. Now let us examine the\r\nlandlord's.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act of 1896 the landlord was paid in government stock. Between\r\nthe years 1891 and 1896 government stock rose from 96 to 110. A premium of\r\nten per cent was a strong incentive to the landlord to sell. If he had an\r\nestate worth L5000, he received in reality for it L5500, for he was\r\ncredited with L5000 stock which, sold on change, realized L5500 in cash.\r\nIn some cases, where the estate was mortgaged, the gain was even more.\r\nThis was gold finding for the landlord until the price of stock fell,\r\nwhich it did and with a vengeance. Stock which in 1897 stood at 113 fell\r\nin 1901 to 91. The fall again clogged the wheels, and the question once\r\nagain became the burning question of the hour. It is right to say here\r\nthat there were other forces at work which made the landlord anxious to\r\nget out, if he could at all, on reasonable terms. The fall in the price of\r\nproduce continued, and the Land Commission, which had under the Act of\r\n1881 twice revised the rentals, and reduced them each time by twenty per\r\ncent on an average, were preparing for the third revision. The landlords\r\nlooked forward to 1911 with fear and trembling. With their estates mostly\r\nheavily mortgaged, and the third revision at hand, they were as anxious as\r\nthe tenants, if not more so, that Parliament should step in to their\r\nmutual aid. It did so in the Land Act of 1903. The introduction of this\r\nmeasure was preceded by a conference of landlords and tenants,\r\nrepresentatives in Ireland which met in the Mansion House, Dublin, and\r\nafter five sittings reported as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it is expedient that the land question in Ireland be settled so\r\nfar as it is practicable and without delay,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas the existing position of the land question is adverse to the\r\nimprovement of the soil of Ireland, leads to unending controversies and\r\nlaw-suits between owners and occupiers, retards progress in the country,\r\nand constitutes a grave danger to the state,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas an opportunity of settling once for all the differences\r\nbetween owners and occupiers in Ireland is very desirable,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas such settlement can only be effected upon a basis mutually\r\nsatisfactory to the owners and occupiers of the land,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas certain representatives of owners and occupiers have been\r\ndesirous of endeavouring to find such basis, and for that purpose have met\r\nin conference together,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas certain particulars of agreement have been formulated,\r\ndiscussed, and passed at the conference, and it is desirable that the same\r\nshould be put into writing and submitted to his Majesty's government,\r\n\r\n\"After consideration and discussion of various schemes submitted to the\r\nconference, we are agreed:--\r\n\r\n\"1. That the only satisfactory settlement of the land question is to be\r\neffected by the substitution of an occupying proprietary in lieu of the\r\nexisting system of dual ownership.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the process of direct interference by the State in purchase and\r\nresale is in general tedious and unsatisfactory; and that, therefore,\r\nexcept in cases where at least half the occupiers or the owners so desire,\r\nand except in districts included in the operations of the congested\r\ndistricts board, the settlement should be made between owner and occupier,\r\nsubject to the necessary investigation by the State as to title, rental,\r\nand security.\r\n\r\n\"3. That it is desirable in the interests of Ireland that the present\r\nowners of land should not as a result of any settlement be expatriated,\r\nor, having received payment for their land, should find no object for\r\nremaining in Ireland, and that as the effect of a far-reaching settlement\r\nmust necessarily be to cause the sale of tenancies throughout the whole of\r\nIreland, inducements should, wherever practicable, be afforded to selling\r\nowners to continue to reside in that country.\r\n\r\n\"4. That for the purpose of obtaining such a result, an equitable price\r\nought to be paid to the owners, which should be based upon income.\r\n\r\n\"Income, as it appears to us, is second term rents--including all rents\r\nfixed subsequent to the passing of the Act of 1896--or their fair\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\n\"5. That the purchase price should be based upon income as indicated\r\nabove, and should be either the assurance by the State of such income, or\r\nthe payment of a capital sum producing such income at three per cent or at\r\nthree and one-fourth per cent, if guaranteed by the State, or if the\r\nexisting powers of trustees be sufficiently enlarged.\r\n\r\n\"Costs of collection where such exist, not exceeding ten per cent, are not\r\nincluded for the purpose of these paragraphs in the word 'income.'\r\n\r\n\"6. That such income or capital sum should be obtainable by the owners:--\r\n\r\n\"(_a_) Without the requirement of capital outlay upon their part, such as\r\nwould be involved by charges for proving title to sell. Six years'\r\npossession, as proposed in the bill brought forward in the session of\r\n1902, appears to us a satisfactory method of dealing with the matter.\r\n\r\n\"(_b_) Without the requirement of outlay to prove title to receive the\r\npurchase money.\r\n\r\n\"(_c_) Without unreasonable delay.\r\n\r\n\"(_d_) Without loss of income pending reinvestment.\r\n\r\n\"(_e_) And without leaving a portion of the capital sum as a guarantee\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n\"7. That, as a necessary inducement to selling owners to continue to\r\nreside in Ireland, the provision of the bill introduced by the chief\r\nsecretary for Ireland in the session of 1902 with regard to the purchase\r\nof mansion houses, demesne lands, and home farms by the State, and resale\r\nby it to the owners, ought to be extended.\r\n\r\n\"8. We suggest that in certain cases it would be to the advantage of the\r\nState as insuring more adequate security, and also an advantage to owners\r\nin such cases, if upon the purchase by the State of the mansion house and\r\ndemesne land and resale to the owner, the house and demesne land should\r\nnot be considered a security to the mortgages.\r\n\r\n\"9. That owners wishing to sell portions of grazing land in their own\r\nhands for the purpose of enlarging neighbouring tenancies should be\r\nentitled to make an agreement with the tenants, and that in the event of\r\nproposed purchase by the tenants such grazing land may be considered as\r\npart of the tenancies for the purpose of purchase.\r\n\r\n\"10. That, in addition to the income, or capital sum producing the income,\r\nthe sum due for rent from the last rent day till the date of the agreement\r\nfor purchase and the hanging gale should be paid by the State to the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n\"11. That all liabilities by the owner which run with the land, such as\r\nhead-rents, quit-rents, and tithe-rent charge, should be redeemed, and the\r\ncapital sum paid for such redemption deducted from the purchase money\r\npayable to the owner. Provided always that the price of redemption should\r\nbe calculated on a basis not higher, as regards annual value, than is used\r\nin calculating the purchase price of the estate. In any special cases\r\nwhere it may have to be calculated upon a different basis, the owner\r\nshould not suffer thereby. Owners liable to drainage charges should be\r\nentitled to redeem same upon equitable terms, having regard to the varying\r\nrates of interest at which such loans were made.\r\n\r\n\"12. That the amount of the purchase money payable by the tenants should\r\nbe extended over a series of years, and be at such a rate, in respect of\r\nprincipal and interest, as will at once secure a reduction of not less\r\nthan fifteen per cent, or more than twenty-five per cent on second term\r\nrents or their fair equivalent, with further periodical reductions as\r\nunder existing land purchase acts until such time as the treasury is\r\nsatisfied that the loan has been repaid. This may involve some assistance\r\nfrom the State beyond the use of its credit, which, under circumstances\r\nhereinafter mentioned, we consider may reasonably be granted. Facilities\r\nshould be provided for the redemption at any time of the purchase money or\r\npart thereof by payment of the capital or any part thereof.\r\n\r\n\"13. That the hanging gale, where such custom exists, should be included\r\nin the loan and paid off in the instalments to be paid by the purchasing\r\noccupier, and should not be a debt immediately recoverable from the\r\noccupier, but the amount of rent ordinarily payable for the period between\r\nthe date when the last payment fell due and the date of agreement for sale\r\nshould be payable as part of the first instalment.\r\n\r\n\"14. That counties wholly or partly under the operations of the congested\r\ndistricts board, or other districts of a similar character (as defined by\r\nthe Congested Districts Board Acts and by section four, clause one, of Mr.\r\nWyndham's Land Purchase Amendment Bill of last session), will require\r\nseparate and exceptional treatment with a view to the better distribution\r\nof the population and of the land, as well as for the acceleration and\r\nextension of these projects for migration and enlargement of holdings\r\nwhich the congested districts board, as at present constituted and with\r\nits limited powers, has hitherto found it impossible to carry out upon an\r\nadequate scale.\r\n\r\n\"15. That any project for the solution of the Irish Land Question should\r\nbe accompanied by a settlement of the evicted tenants' question upon an\r\nequitable basis.\r\n\r\n\"16. That sporting and riparian rights should remain as they are, subject\r\nto any provisions of existing Land Purchase Acts.\r\n\r\n\"17. That the failure to enforce the Labourers Acts in certain portions of\r\nthe country constitutes a serious grievance, and that in districts where,\r\nin the opinion of the local government board, sufficient accommodation has\r\nnot been made for the housing of the labouring classes, power should be\r\ngiven to the local government board, in conjunction with the local\r\nauthorities, to acquire sites for houses and allotments.\r\n\r\n\"18. That the principle of restriction upon subletting might be extended\r\nto such control as may be practicable over resales of purchasers' interest\r\nand mortgages, with a view to maintaining unimpaired the value of the\r\nState's security for outstanding instalments on loans.\r\n\r\n\"And whereas we are agreed that no settlement can give peace and\r\ncontentment to Ireland or afford reasonable and fair opportunity for the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the country, which fails to satisfy the\r\njust claims of both owners and occupiers,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas such settlement can only be effected by the assistance of the\r\nState, which, as a principle, has been employed in former years,\r\n\r\n\"And whereas it appears to us that, for the healing of differences and the\r\nwelfare of the country, such assistance should be given, and can be given,\r\nand can effect a settlement without either undue cost to the treasury or\r\nappreciable risk with regard to the money advanced, we are of opinion that\r\nany reasonable difference arising between the sum advanced by the State,\r\nand ultimately repaid to it, may be justified by the following\r\nconsiderations:--\r\n\r\n\"That for the future welfare of Ireland, and for the smooth working of any\r\nmeasure dealing with the transfer of land, it is necessary:--\r\n\r\n\"1. That the occupiers should be started on their new career as owners on\r\na fair and favourable basis, insuring reasonable chances of success, and\r\nthat in view of the responsibilities to be assumed by them they should\r\nreceive some inducement to purchase.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the owners should receive some recognition of the facts that\r\nselling may involve sacrifice of sentiment, that they have already\r\nsuffered heavily by the operation of the land acts, and that they should\r\nreceive some inducement to sell.\r\n\r\n\"3. That for the benefit of the whole community it is of the greatest\r\nimportance that income derived from sale of property in Ireland should\r\ncontinue to be expended in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"And we further submit that, as a legitimate setoff against any demand\r\nupon the State, it must be borne in mind that, upon the settlement of the\r\nland question in Ireland, the cost of administration of the law and the\r\ncost of the Royal Irish Constabulary would be materially and permanently\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\n\"We do not, at the present time, desire to offer further recommendations\r\nupon the subject of finance which must necessarily be regulated by the\r\napproval of the government to the principles of the proposals above\r\nformulated except that, in our opinion, the principles of reduction of the\r\nsinking fund in the event of loss to the State by an increase of the\r\nvalue of money should be extended by the inclusion of the principle of\r\nincrease of the sinking fund in favour of the purchasers in the event of\r\ngain to the State by decrease in the value of money.\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as one of the main conditions of success in reference to any\r\nland purchase scheme must be its prompt application and the avoidance of\r\nthose complicated investigations and legal delays which have hitherto\r\nclogged all legislative proposals for settling the relations between Irish\r\nlandlords and tenants, we deem it of urgent importance that no protracted\r\nperiod of time should ensue before a settlement based upon the\r\nabove-mentioned principles is carried out; that the executive machinery\r\nshould be effective, competent, and speedy, and that investigations\r\nconducted by it should not entail cost upon owner or occupier; and, as a\r\nfurther inducement to despatch, we suggest that any state aid, apart from\r\nloans which may be required for carrying out a scheme of land purchase as\r\nherein proposed, should be limited to transactions initiated within five\r\nyears after the passing of the act.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to place on record our belief that an unexampled opportunity is\r\nat the present moment afforded his Majesty's government of effecting a\r\nreconciliation of classes in Ireland upon terms which, as we believe,\r\ninvolve no permanent increase of Imperial expenditure in Ireland; and that\r\nthere would be found on all sides an earnest desire to cooperate with the\r\ngovernment in securing the success of a Land Purchase Bill, which, by\r\neffectively and rapidly carrying out the principles above indicated, would\r\nbring peace and prosperity to the country.\r\n\r\n\"Signed at the Mansion House, Dublin, this third day of January, 1903.\r\n\r\n    \"DUNRAVEN (_Chairman_)     JOHN REDMOND\r\n    \"MAYO                      WM.

HARRINGTON\"\r\n\r\nIt soon transpired that the idea of a conference between landlords' and\r\ntenants' representatives was the government plan for laying the foundation\r\nof the bill that they contemplated introducing as a government measure\r\nlater on. The tenants' representatives, who, in the then position of the\r\nland question, with prices falling and the third revision term looming in\r\nthe distance, had all the trumps in their hands, were hopelessly\r\noutmanoeuvred by the landlord section.\r\n\r\nThe question to be discussed was largely a financial one, but still the\r\ntenants had not a man of financial ability at the board. It is true the\r\nmembers of the conference were nominated, and not selected by their\r\nrespective sides, though afterwards, for reasons easily understood, the\r\nnominations were ratified by the parties concerned. But nominated by whom?\r\nBy a Captain Shawe Taylor, a personage popular with all parties, but in\r\nthis matter undoubtedly the agent of the government. The conference sat\r\nfive times, and all through the proceedings the nationalist\r\nrepresentatives were rubbing their hands with glee, for they thought the\r\nmillennium had come.\r\n\r\nThe landlord party, on the other hand, were in nightly communication with\r\nthe Castle. Treasury experts were drafted over to Dublin, and no stone was\r\nleft unturned to secure for the landlords a measure which would satisfy\r\nthe most exacting. They succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. On the 3d\r\nof January, 1903, the land conference issued its report. Clear-headed\r\npoliticians saw at once that the tenants had played the game and lost.\r\nEvery advantage or benefit that the landlord sought or claimed was secured\r\nto him by this treaty, as it was afterwards styled, in terms that could\r\nnot be gainsaid. The tenants' clauses in the report were mostly pious\r\nexpressions of opinion, which were afterwards, when the Land Bill came to\r\nbe drafted, brushed aside, or quietly ignored. But all was not yet lost.\r\n\r\nThe _Freeman's Journal_, under the able guidance of Mr. Thomas Sexton, in\r\na series of powerful articles, reviewed the whole position. It boldly but\r\ntemperately pointed out the defects in the conference report. It refused\r\nto shout with the crowd. It could not see that much was gained. It clearly\r\nsaw that a great deal had been lost. The bill, a large and complicated\r\nmeasure of eighty-nine clauses, was shortly afterwards introduced. It was\r\na great measure and aimed at the final settlement of the land question.\r\nAnd, indeed, such an end, devoutly to be wished, would certainly have been\r\nattained had the amendments pressed on the government during the passage\r\nof the bill by the organ of the tenants been accepted and embodied in the\r\nact.\r\n\r\nClause after clause was closely examined, and the defects exposed by Mr.\r\nSexton in a series of articles, inspired if not actually written by him in\r\nthe _Freeman_. He had done much service for Ireland in the past, but I\r\ndoubt if his great abilities had ever been better applied than to the work\r\nof examination, elucidation, and amendment of the Land Bill of 1903.\r\n\r\nHis criticisms culminated in the publication of a schedule of amendments\r\nwhich he claimed were necessary to the final settlement of the question.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while now putting them on record, for they have a true\r\nhistorical value. It is now seen in the working of the act, that the\r\nacceptance of some of the amendments contained in the schedule materially\r\nimproved the bill, while the omission of the others explains the necessity\r\nfor still further legislation on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the amendments referred to:--\r\n\r\n1. The rights of tenants under the Fair Rent Laws should be maintained\r\nintact.\r\n\r\n2. No non-judicial tenant should be excluded from purchase by reason\r\nmerely of his tenure. Caretakers of holdings of which they had previously\r\nbeen tenants should have the rights of tenants for the purpose of\r\npurchasing such holdings.\r\n\r\n3. As a condition precedent to purchase, non-judicial rents and first term\r\nrents fixed or agreed upon down to the end of 1896 should be reduced to\r\nthe average level, substantially of second term rents, and purchase should\r\nnot be transacted in the cases of non-judicial rents, or of such first\r\nterm rents, except upon this basis.\r\n\r\n4. The purchase system being voluntary, the compulsory limits of price in\r\nthis bill should be struck out.\r\n\r\n5. The aim of the system being to extinguish dual ownership and equal\r\ntreatment being essential both as between past and future transactions,\r\nand also between the tenant who buys his holding and the landlord who buys\r\nback his land sold by him to the State, no rent charge should be reserved.\r\nSuch a reservation would forever exclude the tenant from ownership, by\r\nerecting a new and perpetual system of landlordism in the place of the\r\nold.\r\n\r\n6. The rate of interest on consols being now two and one-half per cent,\r\nthe new guaranteed stock might be issued at two and one-half, instead of\r\ntwo and three-fourths as proposed, and by this means the decadal\r\nreductions, instead of being abolished as the bill provides, might be\r\nallowed at the rate of eight per cent; or, at the option of the purchaser,\r\nthe period during which his annuity would be payable could be shortened by\r\nabout ten years. If the annuity rate were three and one-half, the\r\npurchaser might be allowed to choose between decadal reductions at the\r\nrate of eleven per cent, and a term of redemption shorter by nearly\r\ntwenty years than that prescribed in the bill.\r\n\r\n7. Sales of untenanted land, and, in particular, resales of demesne or\r\nother land to vendors, should be subject to the needs of migration, of\r\nenlarged holdings, and of making provision for evicted tenants, in the\r\ncase of each estate or district, and no evicted farm should be resold to\r\nthe vendor, or sold to a new tenant, if the evicted tenant, or his\r\npersonal representative, is willing to become the purchaser.\r\n\r\n8. The cost of improvement of estates and untenanted land, being charged\r\nto every purchaser and repaid by his annuity, should be provided for as\r\npart of the advances required for the purposes of this act, leaving the\r\nreserve fund available to the estates commissioners for cases of\r\nexceptional need.\r\n\r\n9. It is necessary to maintain the existing satisfactory condition that\r\nthe holding, or other land purchased, is to be sufficient security for the\r\nrepayment of the advance.\r\n\r\n10. The Purchase Aid Fund should be increased to not less than twenty\r\nmillions; and distributed either in inverse ratio to the number of years'\r\npurchase in each case, or by a uniform grant of a fixed number of years'\r\npurchase to every selling landlord.\r\n\r\n11. A term of years should be fixed in the bill, on the expiration of\r\nwhich term the provisions for grants from the Purchase Aid Fund, resales\r\nto landlords, and distribution of purchase money free of cost should cease\r\nto operate.\r\n\r\n12. The subject of sporting and mineral rights calls for clear provision\r\ndictated in the public interest, instead of the ambiguous, loose, and\r\ninconclusive proposals which appear in the bill.\r\n\r\n13. It is requisite that the limit of advance to an evicted tenant be not\r\nless than the ordinary limits; also, that provision be made for restoring\r\nevicted tenants to their former holdings when vacant; for making\r\narrangements to that end when the holdings are occupied; and for stocking\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n14. The cramping restrictions imposed on the congested districts board,\r\nwhich have effectually prevented that body from dealing with the great\r\nagrarian evil of the West, would not be removed or substantially\r\ndiminished by the meagre proposals of the bill; nor can the privations and\r\nmiseries endured in the congested districts be sufficiently abated in any\r\nother way than by such a redistribution of grazing ranches as will provide\r\nthe people of those districts with land enough to yield them the means of\r\nliving. As the guarantee fund--now ample enough for every purpose--is\r\nhenceforth to apply alike to congested and other districts, and as\r\nadvances for land purchase are seen to be free from risk, and special\r\ntreatment is to be applied to congested estates throughout the country, it\r\nis evident that the time has come for a uniform system of land purchase,\r\nand that this is to be secured, either by investing the congested\r\ndistricts board, for all the purposes of land purchase in their particular\r\nareas, with powers corresponding to those of the estates commissioners, or\r\nelse by giving the estates commissioners jurisdiction for land purchase in\r\nthe congested districts, and authorizing the board to apply its income\r\nwholly to its various other objects of expenditure.\r\n\r\n15. The proposals with regard to the Labourers' Acts are so trivial that\r\nthey cannot be amended. The government should be asked to appoint a\r\ncommission to inquire and report, this year, how the question may be\r\nadequately dealt with; and a bill directed seriously to that end should be\r\npassed into law next session.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Land Act, 1903, otherwise known as the Wyndham Act, from the\r\nname of the Irish chief secretary who introduced it, came into force on\r\nthe 1st of November, 1903. This is not the place to set forth its\r\nprovisions, but the principal advantages which accrue to a selling\r\nlandlord and a purchasing tenant availing of its provisions may be briefly\r\nstated. The entire purchase money agreed upon is paid to the landlord in\r\ncash. No part of the purchase money is retained as a guarantee deposit.\r\nFor the purchase of a single holding the limitations of preceding acts are\r\nextended to L7000.\r\n\r\nThe vendor of an estate shall receive in addition to the purchase money\r\nfrom the tenants a bonus for his own immediate benefit. The landlord is\r\nenabled to sell his demesne, and repurchase it at a profit. The landlord\r\nmay sell his estate direct to estate commissioners appointed by the act,\r\nor to the congested districts board, and these bodies are enabled to\r\nresell to the tenants after readjustment and partition of the holdings on\r\nthe estate if necessary. Enlarged powers of investment of purchase money\r\nare conferred upon trustees. The principal advantages secured to the\r\ntenant are as follows: At the end of sixty-eight and one-half years, a\r\ntenant becomes owner in fee of his holding. As soon as the agreement to\r\npurchase is signed, he ceases to be liable for rent. He is enabled to\r\nrepay the advance at the rate of three and one-fourth per cent of his\r\npurchase money. (Though the reduction of the annuity rate from four per\r\ncent under the previous act to three and one-fourth per cent under the\r\nWyndham Act is an undoubted advantage to a tenant, it is certainly to his\r\ndisadvantage that the amount set aside towards the sinking fund should be\r\nreduced from one and one-fourth per cent and one per cent to one-half per\r\ncent.) In congested districts the land commission, or congested districts\r\nboard, may purchase lands under certain conditions to enable them to deal\r\nwith the problem of congestion.\r\n\r\nThe greatest blot on the measure is undoubtedly what is known as the\r\n\"Zones.\" The act provides that if the price agreed upon between the\r\nparties allows a reduction of not less than ten per cent nor more than\r\nthirty per cent on a tenant's existing rent, in the case of a second term\r\nrent, and a reduction of not less than twenty per cent nor more than forty\r\nper cent in the case of a first term tenant, the bargain _must_ be\r\nsanctioned by the commissioners without inquiring whether the land in\r\nquestion is security for the \"advance.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this provision is that tenants have been wheedled or cajoled\r\ninto agreeing to bargains which they will find it difficult or impossible\r\nto keep. The price of land became artificially inflated, and the average\r\nof eighteen years' purchase paid for land in Ireland under the previous\r\nPurchase Acts has been raised by five to seven years' purchase. It is\r\nessential that free bargaining should be restored if purchase is to\r\nproceed on sound economic lines. In spite of the efforts of the wisest of\r\ntheir leaders, the Irish tenantry are rushing into bargains under the\r\nWyndham Act that may eventuate in dire consequences for themselves and for\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe importation of Canadian cattle when it comes will have a serious\r\neffect on the Irish produce market, and a further decline in produce\r\nprices may be expected.\r\n\r\nWill the Irish tenant be then able to discharge his liability to the State\r\nand have sufficient margin for living? That is the question for the\r\nfuture. The answer to it alone can settle whether we have yet reached\r\nfinality in the Irish Land Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] Carlyle, Appendix, No. 17.\r\n\r\n[2] See Lecky, II., 216 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[3] T.
