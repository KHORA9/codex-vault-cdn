Slavery, in its political power, has steadily\r\nbecome more aggressive in its demands. A morbid jealousy of Northern\r\nenterprise and thrift, with the contrast more vivid from year to year,\r\nof the immeasurable superiority of free labor, has brought about a\r\ngrowing aversion, in the South, to the free States, until with every\r\nopportunity presented for pro-slavery extension, there has resulted the\r\npresent organized combination of slave States that have seceded from the\r\nUnion. When the mind goes back to the early formation of our Government\r\nand the adoption of the Constitution, it will be found that an entire\r\nrevolution of opinion and feeling has taken place upon the subject of\r\nslavery. From being regarded, as formerly, an evil by the South, it is\r\nnow proclaimed a blessing; from being viewed as opposed to the whole\r\nspirit and teachings of the Bible, it is now thought to be of divine\r\nsanction; from being regarded as opposed to political liberty, and the\r\nelevation of the masses, the popular doctrine now is, that slavery is\r\nthe corner-stone of republican institutions, and essential for a manly\r\ndevelopment of character upon the part of the white population. Formerly\r\nslavery was looked upon as peculiarly pernicious to the diffusion of\r\nwealth and the progress of national greatness; now the South is\r\nintoxicated with ideas of the profitableness of slave labor, and the\r\npower of King Cotton in controlling the exchanges of the world. And the\r\nsame change has taken place in relation to the African slave-trade.\r\nWhile the laws of the land brand as piracy the capture of negroes upon\r\ntheir native soil, and the transportation of them over the ocean, it is\r\nnevertheless true that a mighty change in Southern opinion has taken\r\nplace in respect to the character of this business. It is not looked\r\nupon with the same horror as formerly. It is apologized for, and in some\r\nplaces openly defended as a measure indispensable to the prosperity of\r\nthe cotton States. As a natural inference from the theory of those who\r\nhold to the views of Calhoun upon State sovereignty, the doctrine of\r\ncoercion in any form by the Federal Union is denounced, and to attempt\r\nto put it in practice even so far as the protection of national property\r\nis concerned, is construed into a war upon the South. Thus, while it is\r\nperfectly proper for the slave States to steal, and plunder the nation\r\nof its property, to leave the Union at their pleasure, and to do every\r\nthing in their power to destroy the unity of the National Government, it\r\nis made out that to attempt to recover the property of the Federal Union\r\nis unjustifiable aggression upon the slave States. Thus we see eleven\r\nStates in a confederate capacity openly making war upon the Federal\r\nGovernment, and compelling it either into a disgraceful surrender of its\r\nrights as guaranteed by the Constitution, or war for self-defense. Fort\r\nSumter was not allowed to be provisioned, nor was there any disposition\r\nmanifested to permit its possession in any manner honorable to the\r\nGovernment, although its exclusive property. It must be surrendered\r\nunconditionally, or be attacked.\r\n\r\nThe worst feature connected with the secession movement is the hot haste\r\nwith which the most important questions connected with the interests of\r\nthe people are hurried through. The ordinance of secession is not fairly\r\nsubmitted to the people, but a mere oligarchy of desperate men\r\nthemselves assume to declare war, and exercise all the prerogatives of\r\nan independent and sovereign government. And yet the terms submitted in\r\nthe Crittenden Resolutions as a peace-offering to the seceding States to\r\nwin them back by concessions from the North, present a spectacle quite\r\nas mournful for the cause of national unity and dignity as the open\r\nrebellion of the seceding States. The professed aim of these States is\r\neither a reconstruction of the Constitution in a way that shall\r\nnationalize slavery and give it supreme control, or a forcible\r\ndisruption of the Union. What are the terms proposed that alone appear\r\nto satisfy the South? They may be briefly comprehended in a short\r\nextract from a speech delivered by Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts,\r\nFebruary 21, 1861:\r\n\r\n     'But the Senator from Kentucky asks us of the North by irrepealable\r\n     constitutional amendments to recognize and protect slavery in the\r\n     Territories now existing, or hereafter acquired south of thirty-six\r\n     degrees, thirty minutes; to deny power to the Federal Government to\r\n     abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, in the forts,\r\n     arsenals, navy-yards, and places under the exclusive jurisdiction\r\n     of Congress; to deny the National Government all power to hinder\r\n     the transit of slaves through one State to another; to take from\r\n     persons of the African race the elective franchise, and to purchase\r\n     territory in South-America, or Africa, and send there, at the\r\n     expense of the Treasury of the United States, such free negroes as\r\n     the States may desire removed from their limits. And what does the\r\n     Senator propose to concede to us of the North? The prohibition of\r\n     slavery in Territories north of thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\n     minutes, where no one asks for its inhibition, where it has been\r\n     made impossible by the victory of Freedom in Kansas, and the\r\n     equalization of the fees of the slave Commissioners.'\r\n\r\nHere we have the true position in which the free States are placed\r\ntoward the slaveholding States. Seven States openly throw off all\r\nallegiance to the Federal Union, do not even profess to be willing to\r\ncome back upon any terms, and then such conditions are proposed by the\r\nother slaveholding States as leads to the repudiation of the\r\nConstitution in its whole spirit and import upon the subject of slavery.\r\nThe alternative, in reality, is either civil war or the surrender of the\r\nConstitution into the hands of pro-slavery men to be molded just as it\r\nmay suit their convenience. The price they ask for peace is simply the\r\nliberty to have their own way, and that the majority should be willing\r\nto submit to the minority. They aim for a reconstruction of the Union\r\nthat shall incorporate the Dred Scott decision into the whole policy of\r\nthe Government and make slavery the supreme power of the country, and\r\nall other interests subservient to it. The North has its choice of two\r\nevils--unconditional and unqualified submission to the demands of\r\nslavery, or civil war. It is expected, since the country has yielded\r\nstep by step to the exactions of slavery ever since the Government was\r\ninstituted, that the free States will keep on yielding until the South\r\nhas nothing more to ask for, and the North has nothing more to give.\r\nWith such a servile compliance, the free States are assured that they\r\nwill have no difficulty in keeping the peace. But the question to be\r\ndecided is: Is such a kind of peace worth the price demanded for it? May\r\nit not be true that great as is the evil of civil war, it is less an\r\nevil than an unresisting acquiescence to the exactions of slavery, and\r\nthe admission that any State that pleases can leave the Union? The\r\ntheory of secession involves, if admitted, a greater disaster to the\r\nFederal Union than even the slow eating at its vitals of the cancer of\r\nslavery. National unity, one country, the sovereignty of the\r\nConstitution, are all sacrificed by secession. It involves in it either\r\nthe worst anarchy or the worst despotism. United, the States can stand,\r\nand command the respect of the world, but secession is an enemy to the\r\ncountry, the most cruel. Rev. Dr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, most\r\nforcibly says:\r\n\r\n     'Every man who has any remaining loyalty to the nation, or any hope\r\n     and desire for the restoration of the seceding States to the\r\n     Confederacy, must see that what is meant by the outcry against\r\n     coërcion is in the interest, of secession, and that what is meant\r\n     is, in effect, that the Federal Government must be terrified or\r\n     seduced into complete coöperation with the revolution which it was\r\n     its most binding duty to have used all its power and influence to\r\n     prevent.'\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, in his late message, says: 'Let us alone, let us go,\r\nand the sword drops from our hands.' But what does this involve? The\r\nadmission of the right of secession, which, as has been proved, is fatal\r\nto all national unity and preservation. Even if this arrogant demand was\r\ncomplied with, would peace be thus possible? Would not the breaking up\r\nof the Union involve the people in calamities that no patience, or\r\nwisdom upon the part of the North could avert? Remember a long border in\r\nan open country, stretching from the Atlantic, possibly even to the\r\nPacific, is to be defended. Will the bordering people sink down from\r\nwar, and all its exasperations, and become as peaceful as lambs?\r\nConstituted as human nature now is, will the dissolution of the Union\r\ncreate with the great North and South the experience of millennium\r\nprediction, 'The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall\r\nlie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and fatling\r\ntogether; and a little child shall lead them'? Here is a line crossed by\r\ngreat rivers; we are to shut up the mouth of the Chesapeake bay, on Ohio\r\nand Western Virginia; we are to ask the Western States to give up the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi to a foreign power. Is it reasonable to suppose\r\nthat no provocation will occur on this long frontier? Will no slaves run\r\naway? What is to be gained by a dissolution of the Union? Not peace; for\r\nif, when united, there exists such cause of dissension, the evil will be\r\ntenfold greater when separated. Not national aggrandizement, for\r\ndivision brings weakness, imbecility, and a loss of self-respect; it\r\ninvites aggressions from foreign powers, and compels to submission to\r\ninsults that otherwise would not be given. Not general competence, for\r\nthe South is quite as dependent upon the North as the North upon the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nDisunion is a violent disruption of great material interests that now\r\nare wedded together. The dream of separate State sovereignty, our great\r\nUnion split into two or more confederacies, prosperous and peaceable, is\r\nUtopian. So far from the secession doctrine carried out leading to peace\r\nand prosperity, it can only lead to perpetual war and adversity. The\r\nrequest to be 'let alone,' is simply a request that the nation should\r\nconsent to see the Constitution and Union overthrown, slavery\r\ntriumphant, and the great problem that a free people can not choose its\r\nown rulers against the will of a minority prove a disgraceful failure.\r\nIt is a request that a nation should purchase a temporary peace at the\r\nprice of all that is dear to its liberty and self-respect. The arrogance\r\nof the demand '_to be let alone_,' is only equaled by the iniquity of\r\nthe means resorted to, to break up the best Government under the sun.\r\nThe question of disunion, of separate State sovereignty, was fully\r\ndiscussed by our fathers. Thus Hamilton, whose foresight history has\r\nproved to be prophetic, says:\r\n\r\n     'If these States should be either wholly disunited, or only united\r\n     in partial Confederacies, a man must be far gone in Utopian\r\n     speculations, who can seriously doubt that the subdivisions into\r\n     which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests\r\n     with each other. To presume a want of motives for such contests, as\r\n     an argument against their existence, would be to forget that men\r\n     are ambitious, vindictive, and rapacious. To look for a\r\n     continuation of harmony between a number of independent,\r\n     unconnected sovereignties, situated in the same neighborhood, would\r\n     be to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to set at\r\n     defiance the accumulated experience of ages.'\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of the true import of the Constitution, in relation\r\nto slavery and the fallacy and wickedness of the doctrine of Secession,\r\nwe are now prepared to deduce, from what has been said, the following\r\nreflections: First, the war in which the nation is now plunged should\r\nhave strictly for its great end, the restoration of the Constitution and\r\nthe Union to its original integrity; all side issues, all mere party\r\nquestions should be now merged in one mighty effort, one persevering and\r\nself-sacrificing aim to maintain the Constitution and the Union. As\r\nessential for this purpose, it is indispensable that all the rights\r\nguaranteed to loyal citizens in the slave States should be respected.\r\nThe reason is two-fold. First, this war, upon the part of the North, is\r\nfor the maintenance of the Constitution as our fathers gave it to us.\r\nIts object is not a crusade against slavery. What may be the results of\r\nthe war in relation to slavery is one thing; what should be the simple\r\npurpose of the North is another. That this war, however it may turn,\r\nwill be disastrous to slavery, is evident from a great variety of\r\nconsiderations. But that we should pretend to fight for the Constitution\r\nand the Union, and yet against its express provisions, in respect to\r\nthose held in bondage by loyal citizens, is simply to act a part\r\nsubversive of the true intent of the Constitution. To violate its\r\nprovisions, in relation to loyal citizens South, is in the highest\r\ndegree impolitic and suicidal. It is the constant aim of the enemies now\r\nin armed rebellion against the Union, to misrepresent the North upon\r\nthis very point. By systematic lying, they have induced thousands South\r\nto believe that the election of Lincoln was designed as an act of war\r\nupon slave institutions, and to subvert the Constitution that protects\r\nthem in all that they call their property.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that the rebels South are more anxious to see than the\r\nGovernment adopting a policy that will give them a plausible pretense\r\nfor continuing in rebellion. The Constitution places the local\r\ninstitution of slavery under the exclusive control of those States where\r\nit exists. Its language, faithfully interpreted, is simply this: Your\r\nown domestic affairs you have a right to manage as you please, so long\r\nas you do not trespass upon the Union, or seek its ruin. All loyal\r\ncitizens should be encouraged to stand by the Union in every Southern\r\nState, with the unequivocal declaration that all their rights will be\r\nrespected, and that their true safety, even as noblest interests, must\r\nlie in upholding the North in the effort made to put down the vilest\r\nrebellion under the sun. My second reflection is, that those South, who\r\nare in armed rebellion against the Constitution and the Union, must make\r\nup their minds to take what the fortune of war gives them. This\r\nrebellion should be bandied without gloves. The North should permit\r\nnothing to stand in the way of a complete and permanent triumph. As\r\nNorthern property is all confiscated South; as Union men there are\r\ntreated with the utmost barbarity; as nothing held by the lovers of the\r\nUnion is respected, the greatest injury in the end to the Constitution\r\nand the Union is, an unwise clemency to armed rebellion. In this\r\ndeath-struggle to test the vital question, whether the majority shall\r\nrule, let there be no holding back of money or men. Dear as war may be,\r\na dishonorable peace will prove much dearer. Great as may be the\r\nsufferings of the camp and the battle-field, yet the prolonged tortures\r\nof a murdered Union, a violated Constitution, and Secession rampant over\r\nthe country, will be found to be greater. My third reflection is, that\r\nthe main cause of our civil war is slavery. It has now assumed gigantic\r\nproportions of mischief, and with its hand upon the very throat of the\r\nConstitution and the Union, it seeks its death. The worst feature\r\nconnected with it has ever been, that it is satisfied with no\r\nconcession, and the more it has, the more it asks. By the very admission\r\nof the chiefs of this rebellion, it is confessedly got up for the sake\r\nof slavery, and to make it the corner-stone of the new Confederacy of\r\nStates. The real issue involved by the rebellion is, complete\r\nindependence of the North, the dissolution of the Union, and exclusive\r\npossession of all the territories south of Mason and Dixon's line; or\r\nreconstruction upon such conditions as would result in the repudiation\r\nof the old Constitution, the nationalization of slavery, and giving\r\ncomplete political control to a slaveholding minority of the country.\r\nThis rebellion has placed the North where it must conquer, for its own\r\nbest interests, and dignity, and the salvation of free institutions. It\r\nmust conquer, to command future friendship and that respect without\r\nwhich Union itself is a mockery. Let the South see that the North can\r\nnot be beaten, and the universal consciousness of this fact will command\r\nan esteem, and the useful fear of committing offense, that will do more\r\nto keep the peace than all the abject professions or humble submissions\r\nin the world. Having found out that the North not only is conscious of\r\nits rights, but has the willingness and the ability to defend them, it\r\nis certain that the country will yet have as much peace, general thrift,\r\nand noble enterprise with the onward march of virtue and intelligence,\r\nas may be reasonably expected of any community upon the face of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            BONE ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Silent the lady sat alone:\r\n        In her ears were rings of dead men's bone;\r\n        The brooch on her breast shone white and fine,\r\n        'Twas the polished joint of a Yankee's spine;\r\n        And the well-carved handle of her fan,\r\n        Was the finger-bone of a Lincoln man.\r\n        She turned aside a flower to cull,\r\n        From a vase which was made of a human skull;\r\n        For to make her forget the loss of her slaves,\r\n        Her lovers had rifled dead men's graves.\r\n        Do you think I'm describing a witch or ghoul?\r\n        There are no such things--and I'm not a fool;\r\n        Nor did she reside in Ashantee;\r\n        No--the lady fair was an F.F.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOLLY O'MOLLY PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Hearts are trumps,' is a gambler's cant phrase. That depends on the\r\ngame you are playing. In many of the games of life the true trump cards\r\nare Diamonds; which, according to the fortune-teller's lore, stand for\r\nwealth. Indeed, Hearts are by many considered so valueless that they are\r\nthrown away at the very outset; whereas they should, like trumps, only\r\nbe played as a last resort. No trick that can be won with any other\r\ncard, should be taken with a heart--the card will be gone and nothing to\r\nshow for it. If you wish wealth, win it if you can--honestly, of\r\ncourse--but don't throw in the heart. Are you ambitious--would you win\r\nhonor? Very well, if for political honor you can endure it to be spit\r\nupon by the crowd, to have all manner of abuse heaped on you and your\r\n_forbears_ to the remotest generation--a ceremony that in Africa follows\r\nthe election, but is 'preliminary to the crowning,' but in this country\r\nis preliminary to the election--but if you can make up your mind to pass\r\nthrough this ordeal, well and good--but don't throw in the heart.... Yet\r\nin games on which is staked all that is worth playing for, 'hearts _are_\r\ntrumps;' and he who holds the lowest card, stands a better chance of\r\nwinning than he who has none, though in his hand may be all the aces of\r\nthe others, diamonds included. But, lest I go too far beyond the\r\nanalogy--as I might ignorantly do, being unskilled in the many games of\r\ncards--I will drop the figurative.... Keep your heart for faith, love,\r\nfriendship, for God, your country, and truth. And where the heart is\r\ngiven, it should be unreservedly. Its allegiance is too often withheld\r\nwhere it is due, yet this is better than a half-way loyalty; there\r\nshould be no _if_, followed by self-interest.... The seal of confederate\r\nnobles, opposed to some measures of Peter IV. of Aragon, 'represents the\r\nking sitting on his throne, with the confederates kneeling in a\r\nsuppliant attitude, around, to denote their loyalty and unwillingness to\r\noffend. But in the back-ground, tents and lines of spears are\r\ndiscovered, as a hint of their ability and resolution to defend\r\nthemselves.' ... This kind of allegiance no true heart will ever give.\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that you have a heart--not merely anatomically\r\nspeaking, an organ to circulate the blood, but a something that prompts\r\nyou to love, to self-sacrifice, to scorn of meanness, and, it may be, to\r\ngood, honest hatred. All metals can be separated from their ores; but\r\nmeanness is inseparable from some natures, so it is impossible to hate\r\nthe sin without hating the sinner; we can't, indeed, conceive of it in\r\nthe abstract. I don't mean hate in a malignant sense--here I may as well\r\nexpress my scorn of that sly hatred that is too cowardly to knock a man\r\ndown, but quietly trips him up.\r\n\r\nIt is well enough for those who think that 'life is a jest,' (and a\r\nbitter, sarcastic one it must be to them,) to mock at all nobler\r\nfeelings and sentiments of the heart. None do they more contemn than\r\nfriendship. I would not 'sit in the seat' of these 'scornful,' however\r\nthey may have found false friends. Yet every man capable of a genuine\r\nfriendship himself, will in this world find at least one true friend.\r\nOxygen, which comprises one fifth of the atmosphere, is said to be\r\nhighly magnetic; and any ordinary, healthy soul can extract magnetism\r\nenough from the very air he breathes to draw at least one other soul.\r\nSome people have an amazing power of absorption and retention of this\r\nmagnetism. You feel irresistibly drawn toward them--and it is all right,\r\nfor they are noble, true souls. There is a great difference between\r\ntheir attractive force and that kind of 'power of charming' innocence\r\nthat villainy often has--just as I once saw a cat charm a bird, which\r\ncircled nearer and nearer till it almost brushed the cat's whiskers--and\r\nhad he not been chased away, he would have that day daintily\r\nlunched--and there would have been one songster less to join in that\r\nevening's vespers.\r\n\r\nFalse----s there are--I will not call them false _friends_--this noun\r\nshould never follow that adjective. To what shall I liken them--to the\r\nyoung gorilla, that even while its master is feeding it, looks\r\ntrustingly in his face and thrusts forth its paw to tear him? Who blames\r\nthe gorilla? Torn from its dam, caged or chained, it owes its captor a\r\ngrudge. To the serpent? The story of the warming of the serpent in the\r\nman's bosom, is a mere fable. No man was ever fool enough to warm a\r\nserpent in his bosom. And the serpent never crosses the path of man if\r\nhe can help it. The most deadly is that which is too sluggish to get out\r\nof his way--therefore bites in self-defense. And the serpent generally\r\ngives some warning hiss, or a rattle. Indeed, almost every animal gives\r\nwarning of its foul intent. The shark turns over before seizing its\r\nprey. But the false friend (I am obliged to couple these words) takes\r\nyou in without changing his side.... In truth, a man, if he has a vice,\r\nbe it treachery or any other, goes a little beyond the other animals,\r\neven those of which it is characteristic. We say, for instance, of a\r\ntreacherous man, _He is a serpent_; but it would be hyperbole to call a\r\nserpent _a treacherous man_.\r\n\r\nBut these false friends, who deceive you out of pure malignity, who\r\nwould rather injure you than not, who, perhaps, have an old, by you\r\nlong-forgotten, grudge, and become your apparent friends to pay you\r\nback--these are few. Human nature, with all its depravity, is seldom so\r\ncompletely debased. But there are many who are only selfishly your\r\nfriends. When you most need their friendship, where is it? When some\r\ngreat calamity sweeps over you, and, bowed and weakened, you would lean\r\non this friendship, though it were but a 'broken reed,' you stretch\r\nforth your hand--feel but empty space.\r\n\r\nThen there are some who let go the hand of a friend because they feel\r\nsure of him, to grasp the extended hand of a former enemy. Politicians,\r\nespecially, do this. An enemy can not so easily be transformed into a\r\nfriend. As in those paintings of George III., on tavern-signs, after the\r\nRevolution changed to George Washington, there will still be the same\r\nold features.... The opposite of this is what every generous nature has\r\ntried. To revive a dying friendship, this is impossible. If you find\r\nyourself losing your friendship for a person, there must be some reason\r\nfor it. If the former dear name is becoming indistinct on the tablet of\r\nyour heart, the attempt to re-write it will entirely obliterate it. It\r\nis said that a sure way to obliterate any writing, is to attempt to\r\nre-write it.... But it is not true that 'hot love soon cools.' With all\r\nmy faults--and to say that I am an O'Molly is to admit that I have\r\nfaults, and I am not sure that I would wish to be without them. To speak\r\nparadoxically, a fault in some cases does better than a virtue--as on\r\nsome organs 'the wrong note in certain passages has a better effect than\r\nthe right.' But, as I was saying, with all my faults, I have never yet\r\nchanged toward a friend; I will not admit even to the ante-chamber of my\r\nheart a single thought untrue to my friend. Though it is true my friends\r\nare so few that I could more than count them on my fingers, had I but\r\none hand.... And these few friends--what shall I say of them? They have\r\nbecome so a part of my constant thoughts and feelings, so a part of\r\nmyself, that I can not project them--if I may so speak--from my own\r\ninterior self, so as to portray them. Have you not such friends? Are\r\nthere none whom to love has become so a _habit_ of your life that you\r\nare almost unconscious of it--that you hardly think of it, any more than\r\nyou think--_'I breathe'_?\r\n\r\nThere is probably no one who has not some time in his or her life felt\r\nthe dreariness of fancied friendliness. I can recall in my own\r\nexperience at least one time when this dreary feeling came over me. It\r\nwas during a twilight walk home from a visit. I can convey to you no\r\nidea of the utter loneliness of the unloved feeling; it seemed that not\r\neven the love of God was mine, or if it was, there was not individuality\r\nenough in it; it was so diffused; this one, whom I disliked--that\r\ninsignificant person, might share in it. I know not how long I indulged\r\nin these thoughts, with my eyes on the ground, or seeing all things 'as\r\nthough I saw them not,' but when I did raise them to take cognizance of\r\nany thing, there was, a few degrees above the horizon, the evening star;\r\nit shone as entirely on me as though it shone on me _exclusively_. It is\r\nthus, I thought, with _His_ love; thus it melts into each individual\r\nsoul. Such gentle thoughts as these, long after the star had sunk behind\r\nthe western mountains, were a calm light in my soul. And I awoke the\r\nnext morning, the old cheerful\r\n\r\nMOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have often thought what splendid members of the diplomatic corps women\r\nwould make, especially married women. As much delicate management is\r\nrequired of them, they have as much financiering to do as any minister\r\nplenipotentiary of them all. Let a woman once have an object in view,\r\nand 'o'er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense or rare; with\r\nhead, hands, or feet, _she_ pursues _her_ way, and swims, or sinks, or\r\nwades, or creeps, or flies;' but _she attains her object_.\r\n\r\nYou poor, hood-winked portion of humanity--man--you think you know\r\nwoman; that she 'can't pull the wool over your eyes.' Just take a\r\nretrospective view. Did your wife ever want any thing that she didn't\r\nsomehow get it? Whether a new dress, or the dearest secret of your soul,\r\nshe either, Delilah-like, wheedled it out of you, or, in a passion, you\r\nalmost _flung_ it at her, as an enraged monkey flings cocoa-nuts at his\r\ntormentor.\r\n\r\nAnd how she has changed your habits, has turned the course of your life,\r\nmade it flow in the channel _she_ wished, instead of, as heretofore,\r\n'wandering at its own sweet will,' as the gently-winding but useless\r\nbrook has been converted into a mill-race.\r\n\r\nThere is Mr. Jones. Before he married, as free and easy a man as ever\r\nsmoked a meerschaum. Mrs. Jones is considered a pattern woman; but of\r\nthat you can judge for yourself. Her first reformation was in regard to\r\nhis club, from which he returned home late, redolent of brandy-punch,\r\nand lavish of _my dears_. All she could say to him had no effect, till,\r\nafter the birth of little Nellie, she joined a Ladies' Reading Society,\r\nmeeting on his club evening; he wouldn't leave the baby to the care of a\r\nservant, consequently staid at home himself.\r\n\r\nHe was also in the habit of resorting to the gymnasium, ostensibly for\r\nexercise, as he was dyspeptic; but his wife suspected it was more to\r\nmeet his old cronies. Finding retrenchment necessary, and looking on\r\ngymnastics somewhat as a Yankee looks on a fine stream that turns no\r\nmill, she dismissed one of the servants, and so arranged it that the\r\nsurplus strength that formerly so ran to waste should make the fires,\r\nrock the cradle, and split certain hickory logs. Very soon Mr. Jones,\r\nwho is a lawyer, found his business so much increased that he was\r\nobliged to remain in his office all day, except at meal-time; after\r\nwhich, however heartily he might have eaten, he never complained of\r\nindigestion. With this, thrifty Mrs. Jones was delighted, till one day\r\nshe surprised him in his office, enveloped in tobacco-smoke, with\r\nelevated feet, reading a nice new novel; you may be sure that after\r\nthat, she insisted on the exercise. As their family increased, thinking\r\nstill further retrenchment necessary, she gently broached the\r\nrelinquishing of the meerschaum. Finding him obstinate in his\r\nopposition, she one day accidentally broke it. It was one that he had\r\nbeen coloring for years; he had devoted time and attention to it, that,\r\nif properly directed, might have made him a German philosopher, an\r\nantiquary, or a profound theologian; or, if devoted to his law studies,\r\nwould have fitted him for Chief-Justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe countryman who mistook for a bell-rope the cord attached to a\r\nshower-bath, was not more astonished at the result of pulling it, than\r\nshe was at the result of this trifling accident. Such an overwhelming\r\ntorrent of abuse as was poured on her devoted head; such an array of\r\noffenses as was marshaled before her; Banquo's issue wasn't a\r\ncircumstance to the shadowy throng. She had recourse to woman's only\r\nmeans of assuaging the angry passions of man--tears, (you know the\r\nregion of constant precipitation is a perpetual calm;) but these,\r\ninstead of operating like oil poured on the troubled waters, were rather\r\nlike oil thrown on the fire. Pleading her delicate health, she hinted\r\nthat his unkindness would kill her, and that, when she was gone, her\r\nsweet face would haunt him. Muttering something about one consolation,\r\nghosts couldn't speak till spoken to, and he was sure he wouldn't break\r\nthe spell of silence, he picked up his hat and strode out of the house,\r\nslamming the door after him. For a while, Mrs. Jones was struck with\r\nconsternation; she felt somewhat as the woman must have felt who, in\r\nattempting to pull up a weed, overturned the monument that crushed her;\r\nand, though not quite crushed by the weight of Mr. Jones's indignation,\r\nshe only resolved to give no more tugs at the weed that had taken such\r\ndeep root in his heart; and that, if he brought home another meerschaum,\r\n(which he did that evening,) it was best to ignore its existence. Mrs.\r\nJones says she believes that the meerschaum absorbs 'the disagreeable'\r\nof a man's temper, as it is said to absorb that of tobacco; at least,\r\nher husband is never so serene as when smoking one. Indeed, it is said\r\nthat the fiercest birds of prey can be tamed by tobacco-smoke.\r\n\r\nDon't think that after this little _contretemps_ all Mrs. Jones's\r\nauthority was at an end; no, indeed; though she had, by stroking the\r\nwrong way the docile, domestic animal, roused him into a tiger, she\r\nhastened to smooth him down; and time would fail me to give even a list\r\nof her reforms.\r\n\r\nAfter having heard her story, as I did, chiefly from her own lips, my\r\nwonder at the immense Union army, raised on such short notice, was\r\nconsiderably diminished. 'Extremes meet.' Probably Union and disunion\r\nsentiments met in the mind of many a volunteer Jones. Then, too, I used\r\nto wonder at the ease with which men apparently forget their buried\r\nwives, and marry again; and, as I then had a great respect for the race,\r\nthought their hearts must be very rich, new affections spring up with\r\nsuch amazing rapidity; like the soil of the tropics, whose vegetation is\r\nhardly cut down before there is a new, luxuriant growth. I've, however,\r\nsince come to the conclusion, that the poor man, somehow feeling that he\r\nmust marry, chooses in a manner at random, having, the first time, taken\r\nthe greatest care, and 'caught a Tartar,' in the same sense that the man\r\nhad with whom the phrase originated, that is, _the Tartar had caught\r\nhim_.\r\n\r\nIn my childhood I was particularly fond of the hoidenish amusement of\r\njumping out of our high barn-window, and landing on the straw\r\nunderneath. The first few times I went to the edge--then drew\r\nback--looked again--almost sprang--again stepped back--till finally I\r\ntook the leap. Thus old bachelors take the matrimonial leap--not so\r\nwidowers--how is it to be accounted for? Well, brother man, (for this is\r\nthe nearest relationship to you that I can claim,) you do about as well\r\nin this way as in any other. You are destined to be taken in as\r\neffectually as was Jonah, when he made that 'exploration of the\r\ninterior,' or, as was the fly, when Dame Spider's 'parlor' proved to be\r\na dining-room.\r\n\r\nSam Slick says that 'man is common clay--woman porcelain.' Alas! there\r\nis but little genuine porcelain. It is a pity that you couldn't contrive\r\nto have a few jars before matrimony, to crack off some of the glazing,\r\nand show the true character of the ware.\r\n\r\nAnd you, sister woman, learn a lesson from the 'tiny nautilus,' which,\r\n'by yielding, can defy the most violent ragings of the sea.' And, though\r\nman is so nicely adapted to your management that it is obviously the end\r\nof his creation, remember Mrs. Jones's trifling miscalculation in regard\r\nto the meerschaum, and--_'N'évéillez pas le chat qui dort.'_\r\n\r\nAbruptly yours, MOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLANCES FROM THE SENATE-GALLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comparative excellence of different periods of eloquence and\r\nstatesmanship affords a subject of curious and profitable contemplation.\r\nThe action of different systems of government, encouraging or depressing\r\nintellectual effort, the birth of occasions which elicit the powers of\r\ngreat minds, and the peculiar characteristics of the manner of thinking\r\nand speaking in different countries, are observable in considering this\r\ntopic. A pardonable curiosity has led the writer frequently to visit the\r\nUnited States Senate Chamber, and to place mentally the intellectual\r\ngiants of that body in contrast with their predecessors on the same\r\nscene, and with the eminent orators and statesmen of other countries and\r\nother ages; and the result of such comparisons has always been to awaken\r\nnational pride, and to convince that the polity bequeathed us by our\r\nfathers, no less than the distinctive genius of the race, have\r\npractically demonstrated that a free system is the most prolific in the\r\nproduction of animated oratory and vigorous statesmanship. Undoubtedly,\r\nthe golden age of American eloquence must be fixed in the time of\r\nGeneral Jackson, when Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Rives, Woodbury, and Hayne\r\nsat in the Upper House; and whatever may be our wonder, when we\r\ncontemplate the brilliant orations of the British statesmen who shone\r\ntoward the close of the last century, if we turn from Burke to Webster,\r\nfrom Pitt to Calhoun, from Fox to Clay, and from Sheridan to Randolph\r\nand to Rives, Americans can not be disappointed by the comparison. Since\r\nthe death of the last of that illustrious trio, whose equality of powers\r\nmade it futile to award by unanimity the superiority to either, and yet\r\nwhose greatness of intellect placed them by common assent far above all\r\nothers, the eloquence of the Senate has been less brilliant and less\r\ninteresting. And yet it has not fallen below a standard of eloquence\r\nequal, if not superior, to that of any other nation. Unlike the English\r\nand the French, who have to go back more than half a century to deplore\r\ntheir greatest Senators and Ministers, the grave closed over the\r\ngreatest American intellects within the memory of the present\r\ngeneration; and the contrast between the Senate of to-day and the Senate\r\nof a score of years ago, is too striking, perhaps, to give us an\r\nimpartial idea of the abilities which now guide the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Senate which is at present deliberating on the gravest questions\r\nwhich our legislature has been called upon to consider since the\r\nestablishment of the Constitution, is, without doubt, inferior in point\r\nof eminent talent, to the Senate of Webster's time, and even to the\r\nSenate which closed its labors on the day of Mr. Lincoln's inauguration.\r\nIn this latter body were three men, who, though far below the great trio\r\npreceding them, still occupied in a measure their commanding influence\r\non the floor and before the country: one of whom now holds an Executive\r\noffice, another sits in the Lower House, and the third has passed away\r\nfrom the scenes of his triumphs forever. Mr. Seward, whose keen logic,\r\naccurate statement of details, and imperturbable coolness, remind one of\r\nPitt and Grey, was considered, while Senator from New-York, as the\r\nleading Statesman of the body, and was the nucleus around which\r\nconcentrated the early adherents of the now dominant party. Mr.\r\nCrittenden's fervent and earnest declamation, wise experience, and\r\ngood-nature, gave him a high rank in the respect and esteem of his\r\ncolleagues, while his age and life-long devotion to the service of the\r\nstate, endowed him with unusual authority. The lamented Douglas, who\r\nsurpassed every other American statesman in casual discussion, and whose\r\nname will rank with that of Fox, in the art of extempore debate, could\r\nnot fail to be the leader of a large party, and the popular idol of a\r\nlarge mass, by the manly energy of his character, his devotion to\r\npopular principles, and a rich and sonorous eloquence, which convinced\r\nwhile it delighted.\r\n\r\nIt must also in candor be admitted, that the secession of the Southern\r\nSenators from the floor, made a decided breach in the oratorical\r\nexcellence of that body. However villainous their statesmanship, and to\r\nwhatever traitorous purposes they lent the power of their eloquence,\r\nthere were several from the disaffected States who were eminent in a\r\nskillful and brilliant use of speech. Probably the man who possessed the\r\nmost art in eloquence, and who united a keen and plausible sophistry\r\nwith great brilliancy of language and declamation with the highest\r\nskill, was Benjamin, of Louisiana. Born a Hebrew, and bearing in his\r\ncountenance the unmistakable indications of Jewish birth, his person is\r\nsmall, thick, and ill-proportioned; his expression is far less\r\nintellectual than betokening cunning, while his whole manner fails to\r\ngive the least idea, when he is not speaking, of the wonderful powers of\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nShrewd and unprincipled, devoting himself earnestly and without the\r\nleast scruple of conscience to two objects--the acquisition of money and\r\nthe success of treason--he yet concealed the true character of his\r\ndesigns under an apparently ingenuous and fervent delivery, and in the\r\ngarb of sentiments worthy a Milton or a Washington. His voice, deeply\r\nmusical, and uncommonly sweet, enhanced the admiration with which one\r\nviewed his matchless delivery, in which was perfect grace, and entire\r\nharmony with the expressions which fell from his lips. How mournful a\r\nsight, to see one so nobly gifted, leading a life of baseness and vice,\r\ndevoting his immortal qualities to the vilest selfishness, and to the\r\nbetrayal of his country and of liberty! Should the descendant of an\r\noppressed and persecuted race take part with oppressors? Senator\r\nBenjamin is a renegade to the spirit of freedom which animated his\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nHe who, among the Southern Senators, ranked as an orator next to\r\nBenjamin, now leads the rebellious hosts against the flag under which he\r\nwas reared, and lends his unquestioned powers to the demolition of the\r\ngreat Republic of which he was once a brilliant ornament. Certainly\r\nendowed with more forethought and practical wisdom than any of his\r\nDemocratic colleagues, well qualified by his calm survey of every\r\nquestion and every political movement, to lead a large party, and\r\nforcible and ironical in debate, Jefferson Davis stood at the head of\r\nthe disaffected in the Senate, as he now does in the field. Cautious and\r\ndeliberate in speech, he yet never failed to launch out in strong\r\ninvective, and to make effective use of irony in his attacks. He is in\r\npersonal appearance, rather small and thin, with a refined and decidedly\r\nintellectual countenance, and a not unamiable expression. His health\r\nalone prevented his rising to the first rank of American orators; and\r\nwhat of his statesmanship was not directed to the accomplishment of\r\npartisan purposes, gave him much consideration. He was incapable, from\r\na weak constitution, of sustaining, at great length, the vivacity and\r\nenergy with which he commenced his speeches; and therefore, their sharp\r\nsarcasm and great power, made them appear more considerable in print\r\nthan in the delivery. Even after he had enlisted all his energies in the\r\ndetestable scheme which he is now trying to fulfill, his prudence halted\r\nat the rash idea he had embraced; and he attempted for a moment to stem\r\nthe torrent, by voting for the Crittenden propositions. His delivery was\r\ngraceful and dignified, his manner sometimes courteous, often\r\ncontemptuous, and always impressive. His eloquence consisted rather in\r\nthe lucid logic and deliberate thought evinced than for rhetorical\r\nbeauty or range of imagination; occasionally, however, he would diverge\r\nfrom the plain thread of argument, and rise to declamation of striking\r\nbrilliancy and power. Over-quick, with all his natural phlegm, to\r\ndiscern and to resent personal affronts--oftentimes when there was no\r\noccasion therefor--he was a favorable exemplar of that peculiar, and to\r\nour mind, somewhat incomprehensible quality, which the Southern people\r\nglory in, and which they dignify by the stately epithet of 'chivalry.'\r\nOn the whole, he must be regarded as the ablest, and therefore the most\r\nculpable and dangerous of the insurgent leaders; and he may, perhaps, be\r\nconsidered the first of Southern statesmen since the time of Calhoun.\r\n\r\nAnother Senator who occupied a high rank as a partisan and statesman\r\namong the Southern Democracy, was Hunter, of Virginia. He is a\r\nthickly-built person, with a countenance possessing but little\r\nexpression, and far from intellectual; and would rather be noticed by\r\none sitting in the gallery for the negligence of his dress, utter want\r\nof dignity, and exceedingly unsenatorial bearing, than for any other\r\nexternal qualities. But when he had spoken a few moments, a decided\r\nsoundness of head, and shrewdness, appeared to enter into the\r\ncomposition of his mind. No man in the Senate had a juster idea of\r\nfinancial philosophy; and his services on the Committee devoted to that\r\ndepartment, were highly appreciated by every one. He was, however,\r\nlittle trusted by loyal Senators, and his frequent professions of\r\ndevotion to the Union, failed to conceal the bent of his mind toward\r\nthose with whom he is now in intimate concert. Sincerity had least place\r\nof all the virtues in his breast; and his hypocrisy, somewhat hidden by\r\nthe apparent ingenuousness and conciliatory address of his manner,\r\nbecame manifest in actions and votes, rather than in words. He was, so\r\nfar as can now be ascertained, one of the prime movers of the Senatorial\r\ncabal, or caucus, which was devoted either to the complete dominance of\r\nthe Southern element in the Union, or to their forcible secession from\r\nthe Union; and was probably as active and earnest a traitor, long before\r\nthe doctrine of secession was ventured upon, as the most fiery of\r\nSouth-Carolina fire-eaters. Mr. Hunter is, in private, courteous and\r\naffable, and, indeed, in the debates in which he took part, he never\r\ntransgressed the rules of respect due to his colleagues, or violated the\r\ndicta of parliamentary etiquette.\r\n\r\nHis colleague, Mason, is an irritable, petulant, arrogant man, not\r\nwithout a certain ability in debate, but censorious, and unconfined by\r\nthe restraints of decency in his tirades against the North. He was 'one\r\nof the finest-looking men,' if we speak phrenologically, in the last\r\nSenate; and would always be noticed for his dignified manner and fine\r\nhead, by a stranger visiting the Chamber for the first time. We have\r\nbriefly noticed him, rather on account of the notoriety recently\r\nattached to his name by the 'Trent' affair, than from his prominence\r\namong Southern orators and statesmen--his talent, being, in fact, of a\r\ndecidedly mediocre description.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of Mason, it will be _apropos_ to allude to his late\r\ncompanion in trouble, John Slidell, who was certainly the shrewdest\r\npolitician and party tactician among his friends on the north side of\r\nthe chamber; he is indeed the Nestor of intriguers. From the time when,\r\nearly in life, he aspired to, and in a degree succeeded in controlling\r\nthe politics of the Empire City, up to this hour, when he is with\r\nsnake-like subtleness attempting to poison French honor, his career has\r\nbeen a series of successful intrigues. Utterly devoid of moral\r\nprinciple, he resembles his late colleague, Benjamin, in the immorality\r\nof his life, and the baseness of his ends, attained by as base means. He\r\nis rather a good-looking man, short, with snowy-white hair and red face,\r\nhis countenance indicative of the secretiveness and cunning of his\r\ncharacter. He was rather the caucus adviser and manager than one of the\r\norators of his party; seldom speaking, and never except briefly and to\r\nthe point. Imagination in him has been warped and made torpid by a life\r\nof dissipation, as well as by his practical tendencies. He is, like many\r\nother Southern statesmen, courteous and pleasing in social conversation;\r\nbut is heartless, selfish, and malignant in his enmities.\r\n\r\nRobert Toombs stood deservedly high in the traitorous cabal in the\r\nSenate; for, to a bold and energetic spirit, great arrogance of manner,\r\nand activity, he added a powerful mind and a clear head. In the street,\r\nhe would strike you as a self-conceited, bullying, contemptuous person,\r\nwith brains in the inverse proportion to his body, which was large and\r\napparently strong. His manner, when addressing the Senators, had indeed\r\nmuch of an overbearing and insolent spirit; but the impression, in\r\nregard to his character, after hearing him speak, was much better than\r\nbefore. There was an indication of strength behind the bullying,\r\nblustering air which he put on, which raised one's respect for his\r\nattainments. One of the most rabid and uncompromising of secession\r\nleaders, and bigoted in his hatred of the North, he was yet, in private,\r\na courteous and hospitable gentleman, and, apparently at least, frank in\r\nthe expression of opinion. Probably he had as little principle in\r\npolitical and social life as most of his associates in treason; while\r\nhis great self-reliance, activity, and mental ability gave him a very\r\nhigh position in their confidence. He was tall and stout, though not\r\ncorpulent; and was very negligent of his toilet and dress. Self-conceit\r\nwas written on his countenance, and displayed itself in his arrogant\r\nassumptions of superiority. But his method of dealing with his Northern\r\nopponents was open and bold, although insolent and overbearing, and not\r\nlike Hunter, Davis, and Benjamin, using ingenious sophistry and hidden\r\nsarcasm, cautiously smoothing over their real purpose, by rhetoric and\r\nelegant sentiment. Mr. Toombs became early an object of peculiar dislike\r\nto Northern men, by the rude ingenuousness with which he announced the\r\nlast conclusions of his political creed, and the intolerable insolence\r\nwith which, not heeding the admonitions of his more cautious\r\nconfederates, he thundered out his anathemas of hatred and vengeance on\r\nwhat he was pleased to call 'Northern tyranny.' It was only when the\r\ncrisis came, that others unfolded together their base character and\r\ntheir hypocrisy. Davis, who had been fondled by New-Englanders but a\r\nyear or two since, and Hunter, who had cried for peace and compromise,\r\nstanding forth at last in the true light of traitors, and thereby\r\nproclaiming their past life a game of hypocrisy. Toombs, therefore, who\r\nwas an original fire-eater, and hence could not be called a hypocrite,\r\nhas become less an object of hatred to us of the loyal States, than\r\nthose who, while they sat at the cabinet councils, or were admitted to\r\nthe confidence of the Executive, or were sent to foreign courts, or\r\npresided over the Upper House, were using the power of such high trusts\r\nfor the consummation of a conspiracy against their country, yet\r\nretaining the cant of patriotism and feigning a devotion to the Union.\r\nWe have dwelt almost exclusively, in the present chapter, upon Senators\r\nwhose highest honors have been tarnished or obliterated by the gravest\r\nof crimes, that of treason toward a vast community. But it has been\r\nwith the idea that the least should be presented first, and that the\r\ngreater should close the scene; as in royal processions, the monarch\r\nalways brings up the rear. We conceive that the great talents which we\r\nhave acknowledged, and which doubtless all will agree with us in\r\nacknowledging, the leaders of the Southern rebellion to possess, only\r\nenhance the magnitude of their offense, and serve to illustrate with\r\ngreater force the enormity of their purposes. That a brainless fanatic\r\nlike Lord George Gordon, or the Neapolitan fisherman, Massaniello,\r\nshould stir up tremendous agitation, may be matter for critical study,\r\nbut is hardly a subject of wonder. But that men gifted with exalted\r\nability, undoubted caution, well-balanced intellect, and apparently\r\nrefined reason, all of which have been appreciated and acknowledged,\r\nshould propound an erroneous doctrine of a chaotic system, and proceed\r\nto the violence of civil war, on what they must know to be a false and\r\nheretical plea, can only remind us of those devils who have been\r\npictured by the matchless art of Milton, of Dante, and of Goethe, as\r\npossessing stately intellects with perfectly vicious hearts. We propose,\r\nin a future number, if these remarks on public characters are\r\nacceptable, to continue our remarks, by introducing the loyal Senators\r\nof the last Congress, a band of men who will be found to equal in\r\ntalent, and immeasurably to surpass in moral rectitude and earnest\r\npatriotism, the bad company from whom we now part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE GRECO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Café Greco, like the belle of many seasons, lights up best at night.\r\nIn morning, in _deshabille_, not all the venerability of its age can\r\nmake it respectable. Caper declares that on a fresh, sparkling day, in\r\nthe merry spring-time, he once really enjoyed a very early breakfast\r\nthere; and that, with the windows of the Omnibus-room open, the fresh\r\nair blowing in, and the sight of a pretty girl at the fourth-story\r\nwindow of a neighboring house, feeding a bird and tending a rose-bush,\r\nthe old café was rose-colored.\r\n\r\nThis may be so; but seven o'clock in the evening was _the_ time when the\r\nGreco was in its prime. Then the front-room was filled with Germans, the\r\nsecond room with Russians and English, the third room--the Omnibus--with\r\nAmericans, English, and French, and the fourth, or back-room, was brown\r\nwith Spaniards. The Italians were there, in one or two rooms, but in a\r\nminority; only those who affected the English showed themselves, and\r\naired their knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon tongue and habits.\r\n\r\n'I habituate myself,' said a red-haired Italian of the Greco to Caper,\r\n'to the English customs. I myself lave with hot water from foot to head,\r\none time in three weeks, like the English. It is an idea of the most\r\nsuperb, and they tell me I am truly English for so performing. I have\r\nnot yet arrive to perfection in the lessons of box, but I have a smart\r\ncove of a bool-dog.'\r\n\r\nCaper told him that his resemblance to an English 'gent' was perfect, at\r\nwhich the Italian, ignorant of the meaning of that fearful word, smiled\r\nassent.\r\n\r\nThe waiter has hardly brought you your small cup of _caffe nero_, and\r\nyou are preparing to light a cigar, to smoke while you drink your\r\ncoffee, when there comes before you a wandering bouquet-seller. It is,\r\nperhaps, the dead of winter; long icicles are hanging from fountains,\r\nover which hang frosted oranges, frozen myrtles, and frost-nipped\r\nolives, Alas! such things are seen in Rome; and yet, for a dime you are\r\noffered a bouquet of camellia japonicas. By the way, the name camellia\r\nis derived from _Camellas_, a learned Jesuit; probably _La Dame aux\r\nCamélias_ had not a similar origin. You don't want the flowers.\r\n\r\n'Signore,' says the man, 'behold a ruined flower-merchant!'\r\n\r\nYou are unmoved. Have you not seen or heard of, many a time, the\r\nheaviest kind of flour-merchants ruined by too heavy speculations, burst\r\nup so high the crows couldn't fly to them; and heard this without\r\nchanging a muscle of your face?\r\n\r\n'But, signore, do buy a bouquet to please your lady?'\r\n\r\n'Haven't one.'\r\n\r\n'_Altro_!' answers the man, triumphantly, 'whom did I see the other day,\r\nwith these eyes, (pointing at his own,) in a magnificent carriage,\r\nbeside the most beautiful _Donna Inglesa_ in Rome? _Iddio giusto_!'....\r\nAt this period, he sees he has made a ten strike, and at once follows it\r\nup by knocking down the ten-pin boy, so as to clear the alley, thus:\r\n'For _her_ sake, signore.'\r\n\r\nYou pay a paul, (and give the bouquet to--your landlady's daughter,)\r\nwhile the departing _mercante di fiori_ assures you that he never, no,\r\nnever expects to make a fortune at flowers; but if he gains enough to\r\npay for his wine, he will be very tipsy as long as he lives!\r\n\r\nThen comes an old man, with a chessboard of inlaid stone, which he\r\nhasn't an idea of selling; but finds it excellent to 'move on,' without\r\nbeing checkmated as a beggar without visible means of s'port. The first\r\ntime he brought it round, and held it out square to Caper, that cool\r\nyoung man, taking a handful of coppers from his pocket, arranged them as\r\ncheckers on the board, without taking any notice of the man; and after\r\nhe had placed them, began playing deliberately. He rested his chin on\r\nhis hand, and with knitted brows, studied several intricate moves; he\r\nfinally jumped the men, so as to leave a copper or two on the board; and\r\nbidding the old man good-night, continued a conversation with Rocjean,\r\ncommenced previous to his game of draughts.\r\n\r\nNext approaches a hardware--merchant, for, in Imperial Rome, the peddler\r\nof a colder clime is a merchant, the shoemaker an artist, the artist a\r\nprofessor. The hardware-man looks as if he might be 'touter' to a\r\nbroken-down brigand. All the razors in his box couldn't keep the small\r\npart of his face that is shaved from wearing a look as if it had been\r\nblown up with gunpowder, while the grains had remained embedded there.\r\nHe tempts you with a wicked-looking knife, the pattern for which must\r\nhave come from the _litreus_ of Etruria, the land called the _mother of\r\nsuperstitions_, and have been wielded for auguries amid the howls and\r\ngroans of lucomones and priests. He tells you it is a Campagna-knife,\r\nand that you must have one if you go into that benighted region; he says\r\nthis with a mysterious shake of his head, as if he had known Fra Diavolo\r\nin his childhood and Fra 'Tonelli in his riper years. The\r\ncrescent-shaped handle is of black bone; the pointed blade long and\r\ntapering; the three notches in its back catch into the spring with a\r\nnoise like the alarum of a rattle-snake. You conclude to buy one--for a\r\ncuriosity. You ask why the blade at the point finishes off in a circle?\r\nHe tells you the government forbids the sale of sharp-pointed knives;\r\nbut, signore, if you wish to _use it_, break off the circle under your\r\nheel, and you have a point sharp enough to make any man have an\r\n_accidente di freddo_, (death from cold--steel.)\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo might have taken his character of Quasimodo from the wild\r\nfigure who now enters the Greco, with a pair of horns for sale; each\r\nhorn is nearly a yard in length, black and white in color; they have\r\nbeen polished by the hunchback until they shine like glass. Now he\r\napproaches you, and with deep, rough voice, reminding you of the lowing\r\nof the large grey oxen they once belonged to, begs you to buy them. Then\r\nhe facetiously raises one to each side of his head, and you have a\r\nfigure that Jerome Bosch would have rejoiced to transfer to canvas. His\r\nportrait has been painted by more than one artist.\r\n\r\nCaper, sitting in the Omnibus one evening with Rocjean, was accosted by\r\na very seedy-looking man, with a very peculiar expression of face,\r\nwherein an awful struggle of humor to crowd down pinching poverty\r\ngleamed brightly. He offered for sale an odd volume of one of the early\r\nfathers of the Church. Its probable value was a dime, whereas he wanted\r\ntwo dollars for it.\r\n\r\n'Why do you ask such a price?' asked Rocjean, 'you never can expect to\r\nsell it for a twentieth part of that.'\r\n\r\n'The moral of which,' said the seedy man, no longer containing the\r\nstruggling humor, but letting it out with a hearty laugh; 'the moral of\r\nwhich is--give me half a baioccho!'\r\n\r\nEver after that, Caper never saw the man, who henceforth went by the\r\nname of _La Morale é un Mezzo Baioccho_! without pointing the moral with\r\na copper coin. Not content with this, he once took him round to the\r\n_Lepre_ restaurant, and ordered a right good supper for him. Several\r\nother artists were with him, and all declared that no one could do\r\nbetter justice to food and wine. After he had eaten all he could hold,\r\nand drank a little more than he could carry, he arose from table, having\r\nduring the entire meal sensibly kept silence, and wiping his mouth on\r\nhis coat-sleeve, spoke:\r\n\r\n'The moral this evening, signori, I shall carry home in my stomach.'\r\n\r\nAs he was going out of the restaurant, one of the artists asked him why\r\nhe left two rolls of bread on the table; saying they were paid for, and\r\nbelonged to him.\r\n\r\n'I left them,' said he, 'out of regard for the correct usages of\r\nsociety; but, having shown this, I return to pocket them.'\r\n\r\nThis he did at once, and Caper stood astonished at the seedy-beggar's\r\nphraseology.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these characters, wandering musicians find their way into\r\nthe café, jugglers, peddlers of Roman mosaics and jewelry, plaster-casts\r\nand sponges, perfumery and paint-brushes. Or a peripatetic shoemaker,\r\nwith one pair of shoes, which he recklessly offers for sale to giant or\r\ndwarf. One morning he found a purchaser--a French artist--who put them\r\non, and threw away his old shoes. Fatal mistake. Two hours afterward,\r\nthe buyer was back in the Greco, with both big toes sticking out of the\r\nends of his new shoes, looking for that _cochon_ of a shoemaker.\r\n\r\nTo those who read men like books, the Greco offers a valuable\r\ncirculating library. The advantage, too, of these artistical works is,\r\nthat one needs not be a Mezzofanti to read the Russian, Spanish, German,\r\nFrench, Italian, English, and other faces that pass before one\r\npanoramically. There sits a relation of a hospodar, drinking Russian\r\ntea; he pours into a large cup a small glass of brandy, throws in a\r\nslice of lemon, fills up with hot tea. Do you think of the miles he has\r\ntraveled, in a _telega_, over snow-covered steppes, and the smoking\r\n_samovar_ of tea that awaited him, his journey for the day ended? Had he\r\nlived when painting and sculpture were in their ripe prime, what a fiery\r\nlife he would have thrown into his works! As it is, he drinks cognac,\r\nhunts wild-boars in the Pontine marshes--and paints Samson and Delilah,\r\nafter models.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish artist, over a cup of chocolate, has lovely dreams, of burnt\r\number hue, and despises the neglected treasures left him by the Moors,\r\nwhile he seeks gold in--castles in the air.\r\n\r\nThe German, with feet in Italy and head far away in the Fatherland,\r\nfrequents the German-club in preference to the Greco; for at the club is\r\nthere not lager beer?.... In imperial Rome, there are lager beer\r\nbreweries! He has the profundities of the esthetical in art at his\r\nfinger-ends; it is deep-sea fishing, and he occasionally lands a whale,\r\nas Kaulbach has done; or very nearly catches a mermaid with Cornelius.\r\nLet us respect the man--he _works_.\r\n\r\nThe French artist, over a cup of black coffee, with perhaps a small\r\nglass of cognac, is the lightning to the German thunder. If he were\r\nasked to paint the portrait of a potato, he would make eyes about it,\r\nand then give you a little picture fit to adorn a boudoir. He does every\r\nthing with a flourish. If he has never painted Nero performing that\r\ncelebrated violin-solo over Rome, it is because he despaired of\r\nconveying an idea of the tremulous flourish of the fiddle-bow. He reads\r\nnature, and translates her, without understanding her. He will prove to\r\nyou that the cattle of Rosa Bonheur are those of the fields, while he\r\nwill object to Landseer that his beasts are those of the guinea\r\ncattle-show. He blows up grand facts in the science of art with\r\ngunpowder, while the English dig them out with a shovel, and the Germans\r\nbore for them. He finds Raphael, king of pastel artists, and never\r\nmentions his discovery to the English. He is more dangerous with the\r\n_fleurette_ than many a trooper with broadsword. Every thing that he\r\nappropriates, he stamps with the character of his own nationality. The\r\nEnglish race-horse at Chantilly has an air of curl-papers about his mane\r\nand tail.\r\n\r\nThe Italian artist--the night-season is for sleep.\r\n\r\nThe English artist--hearken to Ruskin on Turner! When one has hit the\r\nbull's-eye, there is nothing left but to lay down the gun, and go and\r\nhave--a whitebait dinner.\r\n\r\nThe American artist--there is danger of the youthful giant kicking out\r\nthe end of the Cradle of Art, and 'scatterlophisticating rampageously'\r\nover all the nursery.\r\n\r\n'I'd jest give a hun-dred dol-lars t'morrow, ef I could find out a way\r\nto cut stat-tures by steam,' said Chapin, the sculptor.\r\n\r\n'I can't see why a country with great rivers, great mountains, and great\r\ninstitutions generally, can not produce great sculptors and painters,'\r\nsaid Caper sharply, one day to Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'It is this very greatness,' answered Rocjean, 'that prevents it. The\r\naim of the people runs not in the narrow channel of mountain-stream, but\r\nwith the broad tide of the ocean. In the hands of Providence, other\r\nlands in other times have taken up painting and sculpture with their\r\nwhole might, and have wielded them to advance civilization. They have\r\nplayed--are playing their part, these civilizers; but they are no longer\r\nchief actors, least of all in America. Painting and sculpture may take\r\nthe character of subjects there; but their rôle as king is--played out.'\r\n\r\n'Much as you know about it,' answered Caper, 'you are all theory!'\r\n\r\n'That maybe,' quoth Rocjean; 'you know what THEOS means in Greek, don't\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE WILD BEASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came to Rome, in the autumn, along with the other travelers, a\r\ncaravan of wild beasts, ostensibly under charge of Monsieur Charles, the\r\ncelebrated Tamer, rendered illustrious and illustrated by Nadar and\r\nGustave Doré, in the _Journal pour Rire_. They were exhibited under a\r\ncanvas tent in the Piazza Popolo, and a very cold time they had of it\r\nduring the winter. Evidently, Monsieur Charles believed the climate of\r\nItaly belonged to the temperance society of climates. He erred, and\r\nsuffered with his '_superbe et manufique_ ÉLLLLLÉPHANT!' 'and when we\r\nreflec', ladies _and_ gentlemen, that there _are_ persons, forty and\r\neven fifty years old, who have never seen the Ellllephant!!!...and who\r\nDARE TO SAY so!!!...' Monsieur Charles made his explanations with teeth\r\nchattering.\r\n\r\nCaper, anxious to make a sketch of a very fine Bengal tiger in the\r\ncollection, easily purchased permission to make studies of the animals\r\nduring the hours when the exhibition was closed to the public; and as\r\nhe went at every thing vigorously, he was before long in possession of\r\nseveral fine sketches of the tiger and other beasts, besides several\r\nsecrets only known to the initiated, who act as keepers.\r\n\r\nThe royal Bengal tiger was one of the finest beasts Caper had ever seen,\r\nand what he particularly admired was the jet-black lustre of the stripes\r\non his tawny sides and the vivid lustre of his eyes. The lion curiously\r\nseemed laboring under a heavy sleep at the very time when he should have\r\nbeen awake; but then his mane was kept in admirable order. The hair\r\nround his face stood out like the bristles of a shoe-brush, and there\r\nwas a curl in the knob of hair at the end of his tail that amply\r\ncompensated for his inactivity. The hyenas looked sleek and happy, and\r\ntheir teeth were remarkably white; but the elephant was the constant\r\nwonder of all beholders. Instead of the tawny, blue-gray color of most\r\nof his species, he was black, and glistened like a patent-leather boot;\r\nwhile his tusks were as white as--ivory; yea, more so.\r\n\r\n'I don't understand what makes your animals look so bright,' said Caper\r\none day to one of the keepers.\r\n\r\n'Come here to-morrow morning early, when we make their toilettes, and\r\nyou'll see,' replied the man, laughing. 'Why, there's that old hog of a\r\nlion, he's as savage and snaptious before he has his medicine as a\r\ncorporal; and looks as old as Methusaleh, until we arrange his beard and\r\nget him up for the day. As for the ellllephant ... ugh!'\r\n\r\nCaper's curiosity was aroused, and the next morning, early, he was in\r\nthe menagerie. The first sight that struck his eye was the elephant,\r\nkeeled over on one side, and weaving his trunk about, evidently as a\r\nsignal of distress; while his keeper and another man were--blacking-pot\r\nand shoe-brushes in hand--going all over him from stem to stern.\r\n\r\n'Good day,' said the keeper to him, 'here's a pair of boots for you! put\r\noutside the door to be blacked every morning, for five francs a day.\r\nIt's the dearest job I ever undertook...and the boots are ungrateful!\r\nHere, Pierre,' he continued to the man who helped him, 'he shines\r\nenough; take away the breshes, and bring me the sand-paper to rub up his\r\ntusks. Talk about polished beasts! I believe, myself, that we beat all\r\nother shows to pieces on this 'ere point. Some beasts are more knowing\r\nthan others; for example, them monkeys in that cage there. Give that big\r\nfool of a shimpanzy that bresh, Pierre, and let the gentleman see him\r\noperate on tother monkeys.'\r\n\r\nPierre gave the large monkey a brush, and, to Caper's astonishment, he\r\nsaw the animal seize it with one paw, then springing forward, catch a\r\nsmall monkey with the other paw, and holding him down, in spite of his\r\nstruggles, administer so complete a brushing over his entire body that\r\nevery hair received a touch. The other monkeys in the cage were in the\r\nwildest state of excitement, evidently knowing from experience that they\r\nwould all have to pass under the large one's hands; and when he had\r\ngiven a final polish to the small one, he commenced a vigorous chase for\r\nhis mate, an aged female, who, evidently disliking the ordeal, commenced\r\na series of ground and lofty tumblings that would have made the fortune\r\nof even the distinguished--Léotard. In vain: after a prolonged chase, in\r\nwhich the inhabitants of the cage flew round so fast that it appeared to\r\nbe full of flying legs, tails, and fur, the large monkey seized the\r\nfemale and, regardless of her attempts to liberate herself, he brushed\r\nher from head to foot, to the great delight of a Swiss soldier, an\r\ninfantry corporal, who had entered the menagerie a few minutes before\r\nthe grand hunt commenced.\r\n\r\n'Ma voi!' said the Swiss, pronouncing French with a broad German accent,\r\n'it would keef me krate bleshur to have dat pig monkey in my gombany. He\r\nwould mak' virst rait brivate.'\r\n\r\nThe keeper, who was still polishing away with sand-paper at the\r\nelephant's tusks, and who evidently regarded the soldier with great\r\ncontempt, said to him:\r\n\r\n'He would have been there long since--only he knows too much.'\r\n\r\n'_Ma voi_! that's the reason you're draining him vor a Vrench gavalry\r\ngombany. Vell, I likes dat.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no,' said the keeper, 'his principles an't going to allow him to\r\nenter our army.'\r\n\r\n'Vell, what are his brincibles?'\r\n\r\n'To serve those who pay best!' quoth the Frenchman, who, in the firm\r\nfaith that he had said a good thing, called Pierre to help him adorn the\r\nlion, and turned his back on the Swiss, who, in revenge, amused himself\r\nfeeding the monkeys with an old button, a stump of a cigar, and various\r\nwads of paper.\r\n\r\nThe keeper then gave the lion a narcotic, and after this medicine,\r\ncombed out his mane and tail, waxed his mustache, and thus made his\r\ntoilette for the day. The tiger and leopards had their stripes and spots\r\ntouched up once a week with hair-dye, and as this was not the day\r\nappointed, Caper missed this part of the exhibition. The hyenas\r\nsubmitted to be brushed down; but showed strong symptoms of mutiny at\r\nhaving their teeth rubbed with a toothbrush and their nails pared.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more, the keeper's labors were over, and Caper, giving\r\nhim a present for his inviting him to assist as spectator at _la\r\ntoilette bien béte_, or beastly dressing, walked off to breakfast,\r\nevidently thinking that _Art_ was not dead in that menagerie, whatever\r\nRocjean might say of its state of health in the world at large.\r\n\r\n'To think,' soliloquized Caper, 'to think of what a bootless thing it\r\nis, to shoe-black o'er an elephant!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN MODELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveler visiting Rome notices in the Piazza di Spagna, along the\r\nSpanish steps, and in the Condotti, Fratina and Sistina streets, either\r\nsunning themselves or slowly sauntering along, many picturesquely-dressed\r\nmen, women, and children, who, as he soon learns, are the\r\nprofessional models of the artists. For a fee of from fifty\r\ncents to a dollar, they will give their professional services for a\r\nsitting four hours in length, and those of them who are most in demand\r\nfind little difficulty during the 'business season,' say from the months\r\nof November to May, in earning from one and a half to two dollars, and\r\neven more, every day. Many of them, living frugally, manage to make what\r\nis considered a fortune among the _contadini_ in a few years; and Hawks,\r\nthe English artist, who spent a summer at Saracenesca, found, to his\r\nastonishment, that one of the leading men of the town, one who loaned\r\nmoney at very large interest, owned property, and who was numbered among\r\nthe heavy wealthy, was no other than a certain Gaetano, he had more than\r\nonce used as model, at the price of fifty cents a sitting.\r\n\r\nThe government prohibiting female models from posing nude in the\r\ndifferent life-schools, it consequently follows that they pose in\r\nprivate studios, as they choose; this interdiction does not extend to\r\nthe male models; and when Caper was in Rome, he had full opportunities\r\noffered him to draw from these in the English Academy, and in the\r\nprivate schools of Gigi and Giacinti. Supported by the British\r\ngovernment, the English artist has, free of all expense, at this truly\r\nNational Academy, opportunities to sketch from life, as well as from\r\ncasts, and has, moreover, access to a well-chosen library of books. With\r\na generosity worthy of all praise, American artists are admitted to the\r\nEnglish Academy, with full permission to share with Englishmen the\r\nadvantages of the life-school, free of all cost; a piece of liberality\r\nthat well might be copied by the French Academy, without at all\r\nderogating from its high position--on the Pincian Hill.\r\n\r\nIf Gigi's school is still kept up, (it was in a small street near the\r\nTrevi fountain,) we would advise the traveler in search of the\r\npicturesque by all means to visit it, particularly if it is in the same\r\nlocation it was when Caper was there. It was over a stable, in the\r\nsecond story of a tumble-down old house, frequented by dogs, cats,\r\nfleas, and rats; in a room say fifty feet long by twenty wide. A\r\nsemi-circle of desks and wooden benches went round the platform where\r\nstood the male models nude, or on other evenings, male and female models\r\nin costumes, Roman or Neapolitan. Oil lamps gave enough light to enable\r\nthe artists who generally attended there to draw, and color in oils or\r\nwater-colors, the costumes. The price of admittance for the costume\r\nclass was one paul, (ten cents,) and as the model only posed about two\r\nhours, the artists had to work very fast to get even a rough sketch\r\nfinished in that short time. Americans, Danes, Germans, Spaniards,\r\nFrench, Italians, English, Russians, were numbered among the attendants,\r\nand more than once, a sedate-looking English-woman or two would come in\r\nquietly, make a sketch, and go away unmolested and almost unnoticed.\r\n\r\nMore than three-quarters of the sketches made by Caper at Gigi's\r\ncostume-class were taken from models in standing positions. At the end\r\nof the first hour, they had from ten to fifteen minutes allowed them to\r\nrest; but these minutes were seldom wasted by the artist, who improved\r\nthem to finish the lines of his drawing, or dash in color. The powers of\r\nendurance of the female models were better than those of the men; and\r\nthey would strike a position and keep it for an hour, almost immovable.\r\nNoticeable among these women, was one named Minacucci, who, though over\r\nseventy years old, had all the animation and spirit of one not half her\r\nage; and would keep her position with the steadiness of a statue. She\r\nhad, in her younger days, been a model for Canova; had outlived two\r\ngenerations; and was now posing for a third. If you have ever seen many\r\nfigure-paintings executed in Rome, your chance is good to have seen\r\nMinacucci's portrait over and over again. Caper affirms that of any\r\npainting made in Rome from the years 1856 to 1860, introducing an\r\nItalian head, whether a Madonna or sausage-seller, he can tell you the\r\nname of the model it was painted from nine times out of ten! The fact\r\nis, they do want a new model for the Madonna badly in Rome, for Giacinta\r\nis growing old and fat, and Stella, since she married that cobbler, has\r\nlost her angelic expression. The small boy who used to pose for angels\r\nhas smoked himself too yellow, and the man who stood for Charity has\r\ngone out of business.\r\n\r\n'I have,' said Caper to me the other day, 'too much respect for the\r\npublic to tell them who the man with red hair and beard used to pose\r\nfor; but he has taken to drinking, and it's all up with him.'\r\n\r\nSpite of fleas, rats, squalling cats, dog-fights, squealing of horses,\r\nand braying of donkeys, lamp-smoke, and heat or cold, the hours passed\r\nby Caper in Gigi's old barracks were among the pleasantest of his Roman\r\nlife. There was such novelty, variety, and brilliancy in the costumes to\r\nbe sketched, that every evening was a surprise; save those nights when\r\nStella posed, and these were known and looked forward to in advance. She\r\nalways insured a full class, and when she first appeared, was the beauty\r\nof all the models.\r\n\r\nCaper was sitting one afternoon in Rocjean's studio, when there was a\r\ntap at the door.\r\n\r\n'_Entrate_!' shouted Rocjean, and in came a female model, called Rita.\r\nIt was the month of May, business was dull; she wanted employment.\r\nRocjean asked her to walk in and rest herself.\r\n\r\n'Well, Rita, you haven't any thing to do, now that the English have all\r\nfled from Rome before the malaria?'\r\n\r\n'Very little. Some of the Russians are left up there in the Fratina; but\r\nsince the Signore Giovanni sold all his paintings to that rich Russian\r\nbanker, _diavolo_! he has done nothing but drink champagne, and he don't\r\nwant any more models.'\r\n\r\n'What is the Signore Giovanni's last name?' asked Caper.\r\n\r\n'Who knows, Signore Giacomo? I don't. We others (_noi altri_) never can\r\npronounce your queer names, so we find out the Italian for your first\r\nnames, and call you by that. Signore Arturo, the French artist, told me\r\nonce that the English and Russians and Germans had such hard names they\r\noften broke their front-teeth out trying to speak them; but he was\r\njoking. _I_ know the real, true reason for it.'\r\n\r\n'Come, let us have it,' said Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'_Accidente_! I won't tell you; you will be angry.'\r\n\r\n'No we won't,' spoke Caper, 'and what is more, I will give you two pauls\r\nif you will tell us. I am very curious to know this reason.'\r\n\r\n'_Bene_, now the _prete_ came round to see me the other day; it was when\r\nhe purified the house with holy water, and he asked me a great many\r\nquestions, which I answered so artlessly, yes, so artlessly! whew! [here\r\nMiss Rita smiled artfully.] Then he asked me all about you heretics, and\r\nhe told me you were all going to--be burned up, as soon as you died; for\r\nthe Inquisition couldn't do it for you in these degenerate days. After a\r\ngreat deal more twaddle like this, I asked him why you heretics all had\r\nsuch hard names, that we others never could speak them? Then he looked\r\nmysterious, so! [here Miss Rita diabolically winked one eye,] and said\r\nhe: 'I will tell you, _per Bacco_! hush, it's because they are so\r\nabominably wicked, never give any thing to OUR Church, never have no\r\nholy water in their houses, never go to no confession, and are such\r\nmonsters generally, that their police are all the time busy trying to\r\ncatch them; but their names are so hard to speak that when the police go\r\nand ask for them, nobody knows them, and so they get off; otherwise,\r\ntheir country would have jails in it as large as St. Peter's, and they\r\nwould be full all the time!'\r\n\r\n'H'm!' said Rocjean, 'I suppose you would be afraid to go to such\r\nhorrible countries, among such people?'\r\n\r\n'Not I,' spoke Rita,'didn't Ida go to Paris, and didn't she come back to\r\nRome with such a magnificent silk dress, and gold watch, and such a\r\nbonnet! all full of flowers, and lace, and ribbons? Oh! they don't eat\r\n'nothing but maccaroni' there! And they don't have priests all the time\r\nsneaking round to keep a poor girl from earning a little money honestly,\r\nand haul her up before the police if her _carta di soggiorno_ [permit to\r\nremain in Rome] runs out. I wish [here Rita stamped her foot and her\r\neyes flashed] Garibaldi would come here! Then you would see these black\r\ncrows flying, _Iddio giusto_! Then we would have no more of these\r\n_arciprete_ making us pay them for every mouthful of bread we eat, or\r\nwine we drink, or wood we burn.'\r\n\r\n'Why,' said Caper, 'they don't keep the baker-shops, and wine-shops, and\r\nwood-yards, do they?'\r\n\r\n'No,' answered Rita, 'but they speculate in them, and Fra 'Tonelli makes\r\nhis cousins and so on inspectors; and they regulate the prices to suit\r\nthemselves, and make oh! such tremen-di-ous fortunes. [Here Rita opened\r\nher eyes, and spread her hands, as if beholding the elephant.] Don't I\r\nremember, some time ago, how, when the Pope went out riding, he found\r\nboth sides of the way from the Vatican to San Angelo crowded with people\r\non their knees, groaning and calling to him. Said he to Fra 'Tonelli:\r\n\r\n''What are these poor people about?'\r\n\r\n''Praying for your blessed holiness,' said he, while his eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n''But,' said the Pope, 'they are moaning and groaning.'\r\n\r\n''It's a way the _poblaccio_ have,' answered 'Tonelli, 'when they pray.'\r\n\r\n'The Pope knew he was lying, so, when he went home to the Vatican, he\r\nsent for one of his faithful servants, and said he:\r\n\r\n''Santi, you run out and see what all this shindy is about?'\r\n\r\n'So Santi came back and told him 'Tonelli had put up the price of bread,\r\nand the people were starving. So the Pope took out a big purse with a\r\nlittle money in it, and said he:\r\n\r\n''Here, Santi, you go and buy me ten pounds of bread, and get a bill\r\nfor it, and have it receipted!'\r\n\r\n'So Santi came back with bread, and bill all receipted, and laid it down\r\non a table, and threw a cloth over it. By and by, in comes 'Tonelli.\r\nThen the Pope says to him, kindly and smiling:\r\n\r\n''I am confident I heard the people crying about bread to-day; now, tell\r\nme truly, what is it selling for?'\r\n\r\n'Then 'Toneli told him such a lie. [Up went Rita's hands and eyes.]\r\n\r\n'Then the Pope says, while he looked so [knitting her brows]:\r\n\r\n''Oblige me, if you please, by lifting up that cloth.'\r\n\r\n'And'Tonelli did.\r\n\r\n'Bread went down six _baiocchi_ next morning!'\r\n\r\n'By the way, Rita,' asked Rocjean, 'where is your little brother,\r\nBeppo?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! he's home,' she answered, 'but I wish you would ask your friend\r\nEnrico, the German sculptor, if he won't have him again, for his model.'\r\n\r\n'Why, I thought he was using him for his new statue?'\r\n\r\n'He was; but oh! so unfortunately, last Sunday, father went out to see\r\nhis cousin John, who lives near Ponte Mole, and has a garden there, and\r\nBeppo went with him; but the dear little fellow is so fond of fruit,\r\nthat he ate a pint of raw horse-beans!'\r\n\r\n'Of all the fruit!' shouted Caper.\r\n\r\n'_Si, signore_, it's splendid; but it gave Beppo the colic next day, and\r\nwhen he went to Signore Enrico's studio to pose for Cupid, he twisted\r\nand wrenched around so with pain, that Signore Enrico told him he looked\r\nmore like a little devil than a small love; and when Beppo told him what\r\nfruit he had been eating, Signore Enrico bid him clear out for a savage\r\nthat he was, and told him to go and learn to eat them boiled before he\r\ncame back again.'\r\n\r\n'I will speak to the Signore Enrico, and have him employ him again,'\r\nsaid Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Oh! I wish you would, for the Signore Enrico was very good to Beppo;\r\nbesides, his studio is a perfect palace for cigar-stumps, which Beppo\r\nused to pick up and sell--that is, all those he and father didn't smoke\r\nin their pipes.'\r\n\r\n'Make a sketch, Caper,' said Rocjean, 'of Cupid filling up his quiver\r\nwith cigar-stumps, while he holds one between his teeth. There's a model\r\nlove for you! Now, give Rita those two pauls you promised her, and let\r\nher go. _Adio_!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            GIULIA DI SEGNI.\r\n\r\n\r\n            (_Lines found written on the back of a sketch\r\n                in Caper's portfolio._)\r\n\r\n            By Roman watch-tower, on the mountaintop,\r\n            We stood, at sunset, gazing like the eagles\r\n            From their cloud-eyrie, o'er the broad Campagna,\r\n            To the Albanian hills, which boldly rose,\r\n            Bathed in a flood of red and pearly light.\r\n            Far off, and fading in the coming night,\r\n            Lay the Abruzzi, where the pale, white walls\r\n            Of towns gleamed faintly on their purple sides.\r\n\r\n            The evening air was tremulous with sounds:\r\n            The thrilling chirp of insects, twittering birds,\r\n            Barking of shepherds' fierce, white, Roman dogs;\r\n            While from the narrow path, far down below,\r\n            We heard a mournful rondinella ring,\r\n            Sung by a home-returning mountaineer.\r\n\r\n            Then, as the daylight slowly climbed the hills,\r\n            And the soft wind breathed music to their steps,\r\n            O'er the old Roman watch-tower marched the stars,\r\n            In their bright legions--conquerors of night--\r\n            Shedding from silver armor shining light;\r\n            As once the Roman legions, ages past,\r\n            Marched on to conquest o'er the Latin way,\r\n            Gleaming, white-stoned, so far beneath our gaze.\r\n\r\n            GIULIA DI SEGNI, 'mid the Volscians born,\r\n            Streamed in thy veins that fiery, Roman blood,\r\n            Curled thy proud lip, and fired thy eagle eyes.\r\n            Faultless in beauty, as the noble forms\r\n            Painted on rare Etrurian vase of old;\r\n            How life, ennobled by thy love, swept on,\r\n            Serene, above the mean and pitiful!\r\n\r\n            Stars! that still sparkle o'er old Segni's walls,\r\n            Oh! mirror back to me one glance from eyes\r\n            That yet may watch you from that Roman tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BROWN BUYS A PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaper's uncle, from St. Louis, Mr. William Browne, one day astonished\r\nseveral artists who were dining with him:\r\n\r\n'My young men,' said he, 'there is one thing pleases me very much about\r\nyou all, and that is, you never mention the word Art; don't seem to care\r\nany thing more about the old masters than I would about a lot of old\r\nworn-out broom-sticks; and if I didn't know I was with artists in Rome,\r\nthe crib--no, what d' ye call it?'\r\n\r\n'The manger?' suggested Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' continued Uncle Bill, 'the manger of art, I should think I was\r\namong a lot of smart merchants, who had gone into the painting business\r\ndetermined to do a right good trade.'\r\n\r\n'Cash on delivery,' added Caper.\r\n\r\n'Yes, be sure of that. Well, I like it; I feel at home with you; and as\r\nI always make it a point to encourage young business men, I am going to\r\ndo my duty by one of you, at any rate. I shan't show favor to my nephew,\r\nJim, any more than I do to the rest. And this is my plan: I want a\r\npainting five feet by two, to fill up a place in my house in St. Louis;\r\nit's an odd shape, and that is so much in my favor, because you haven't\r\nany of you a painting that size under way, and can all start even. I'll\r\nleave the subject to each one of you, and I'll pay five hundred dollars\r\nto the man who paints the best picture, who has his done within seven\r\ndays, _and puts the most work on it_! Do you all understand?'\r\n\r\nThey replied affirmatively.\r\n\r\n'But what the thunder,' asked Caper, 'are those of us who don't win the\r\nprize, going to do with paintings of such a size, left on our hands?\r\nNobody, unless a steamboat captain, who wants to ornament his berths,\r\njust that size, and relieve the tedium of his passengers, would ever\r\nthink of buying them.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' replied Uncle Bill, 'I don't want smart young men like you all,\r\nto lose your time and money, so I'll buy the balance of the paintings\r\nfor what the canvas and paints cost, and give two dollars a day for the\r\nseven days employed on each painting. Isn't that liberal?'\r\n\r\n'Like Cosmo de Medici,' answered Rocjean; 'and I agree to the terms in\r\nevery particular, especially as to putting the most work on it! There\r\nare four competitors--put down their names. Légume, you will come in,\r\nwon't you?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly I will, by Jing!' answered the French artist, who prided\r\nhimself on his knowledge of English, especially the interjections.\r\n\r\n'Then,' continued Rocjean, 'Caper, Bagswell, Légume, and I, will try for\r\nyour five hundred dollar prize. When shall we commence?'\r\n\r\n'To-day is Tuesday,' replied Uncle Bill; 'say next Monday--that will\r\ngive you plenty of time to get your frames and canvases. So that ends\r\nall particulars. There are two friends of mine here from the United\r\nStates, one, Mr. Van Brick, of New York, and the other, Mr. Pinchfip, of\r\nPhiladelphia, whom I think you all met here last week.'\r\n\r\n'The thin gentleman with hair very much brushed, be Gad?' asked Légume.\r\n\r\n'I don't remember as to his hair,' answered Uncle Bill, 'but that's the\r\nman. Well, these two I know will act as vampires, and I am sure you will\r\nbe pleased with their verdict. Monday after next, therefore, we will all\r\ncall, so be ready.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe four artists took the whole thing as a joke, but determined to paint\r\nthe pictures; and at Caper's suggestion, each one agreed, as there was a\r\nplay of words in the clause, 'most work on it,' to puzzle Uncle Bill,\r\nand have the laugh on him.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed to decide the prize, Uncle Bill, accompanied by\r\nMessrs. Van Brick and Pinchfip, called first at Légume's studio; they\r\nfound him in the Via Margutta, (in English, Malicious street,) in a\r\nlight, airy room, furnished with a striking attention to effect. On his\r\neasel was a painting of the required size, representing Louis XV. at\r\nVersailles, surrounded by his lady friends. By making the figures of the\r\nladies small, and crowding them, Légume managed to get a hundred or two\r\non the canvas. A period in their history to which Frenchmen refer with\r\nso much pleasure, and with which they are so conversant, was treated by\r\nthe artist with professional zeal. The merits of the painting were\r\ncarefully canvassed by the two judges. Mr. Pinchfip found it exceedingly\r\ngraceful, neat, and pretty. Mr. Van Brick admired the females, remarking\r\nthat he should like to be in old Louis's place. To which Légume bowed,\r\nasserting that he was sure he was in every way qualified to fill it. Mr.\r\nVan Brick determined in his mind to give the artist a dinner, at\r\nSpillman's, for that speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinchfip took notes in a book; Mr. Van Brick asked for a light to a\r\ncigar. The former congratulated the artist; the latter at once asked him\r\nto come and dine with him. Mr. Pinchfip wished to know if he was related\r\nto the Count Légume whom he had met at Paris. Mr. Van Brick told him he\r\nwould bring his friend Livingston round to buy a painting. Mr. Pinchfip\r\nsaid that it would afford him pleasure to call again. Mr. Van Brick gave\r\nthe artist his card, and shook hands with him:...and the judges were\r\npassing out, when Légume asked them to take one final look at the\r\npainting to see if it had not the _most work_ on it. Mr. Van Brick\r\ninstantly turned toward it, and running over it with his eye, burst into\r\nan uncontrollable fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n'If the others beat that, I am mistaken,' said he. 'Look at there!'\r\ncalling the attention of Uncle Bill and Mr. Pinchfip to a fold of a\r\ncurtain on which was painted, in small letters,\r\n\r\n'MOST WORK.'\r\n\r\n'I say, Browne,' continued Mr. Van Brick, 'he is too many for you; and\r\nif the one who puts 'most work' on his painting is to win the five\r\nhundred dollars, Légume's chance is good.'\r\n\r\n'Very ingenious,' said Mr. Pinchfip, 'very; it is a legitimate play upon\r\nwords. But legally, I can not affirm that I am aware of any precedent\r\nfor awarding Mr. Browne's money to Monsieur Légume on this score.'\r\n\r\n'We will have to make a precedent, then,' spoke Van Brick, 'and do it\r\nillegally, if we find that he deserves the money. But time flies, and we\r\nhave the other artists to visit.'\r\n\r\nThey next went to Bagswell's studio, in the Viccolo dei Greci, and found\r\nhim in a large room, well furnished, and having a solidly comfortable\r\nlook; the walls ornamented with paintings, sketches, costumes, armor;\r\nwhile in a good light under its one large window, was his painting. They\r\nfound he had left his beaten track of historical subjects, and in the\r\n_genre_ school had an interior of an Italian country inn--a\r\nkitchen-scene. It represented a stout, handsome country girl, in\r\nCiociara costume, kneading a large trough of dough, while another girl\r\nwas filling pans with that which was already kneaded, and two or three\r\nother females were carrying them to an oven, tended by a man who was\r\npiling brush-wood on the fire. The painting was very life-like, and for\r\nthe short time employed on it, well finished. It wanted the fire and\r\ndash of Légume's painting, but its truthfulness to life evidently made a\r\ndeep impression on Uncle Bill. Stuck on with a sketching-tack to one\r\ncorner was a piece of paper, on which was marked the number of hours\r\nemployed each day on the work; it summed up fifty-four hours, or an\r\naverage each day of nearly eight hours' work on it.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinchfip's note-book was again called into play. Mr. Van Brick had\r\nanother cigar to smoke, remarking that the artist had triple work in his\r\npicture--head, bread, and prize-work: his picture representing working\r\nin, over, and for bread!\r\n\r\nThey next went to see Rocjean, in the Corso; they found him in a\r\nbournouse, with a fez on his head, a long chibouk in his mouth, smoking\r\naway, extended at full length on a settee, which he insisted was a\r\ndivan. There was a glass bottle holding half a gallon of red wine on a\r\ntable near him, also a bottle of Marsala, and half a dozen glasses.\r\nThere was a roaring wood-fire in his stove--for it was December, and the\r\nday was overcast and cool.\r\n\r\n'This is the most out and out comfortable old nest I've seen in Rome,'\r\nsaid Mr. Van Brick, as they entered; 'and as for curiosities and\r\nplunder, you beat Barnum. _Will I take a glass of wine_? I am there!'\r\n\r\nRocjean filled up glasses. Mr. Pinchfip declining, as he never drank\r\nbefore dinner, neither did he smoke before dinner. He told them that the\r\nlate Doctor Phyzgig, who had always been their (the Pinchfips') family\r\nphysician, had absolutely forbidden it.\r\n\r\nNo one made any remark to this, unless Mr. Van Brick's expressive face\r\ncould be translated as observing, in a quiet manner, that the late\r\nDoctor was possibly dyspeptic, and probably nervous.\r\n\r\nRocjean's painting represented a view of the Claudian aqueduct,\r\nmountains in the distance; bold foreground, shepherd with flocks, a\r\nwayside shrine, peasants kneeling in front of it. Over all, bold cloud\r\neffects. A very ponderous volume balanced on top of the picture, and\r\nleaning against the easel, invited Uncle Bill's attention, and he asked\r\nRocjean why he had put it there? The artist answered that it was a folio\r\ncopy of _Josephus_, his works, and, as he was anxious to comply with the\r\nterms of Mr. Browne, he had placed it there in order to put the _most\r\nwork_ on it.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinchfip having asked Rocjean why, in placing that book there, he\r\nwas like a passenger paying his fare to the driver of an omnibus?\r\n\r\nThe latter at once answered:\r\n\r\n'I give it up.'\r\n\r\n'So you do,' replied Pinchfip. 'You are quick, sir, at answering\r\nconundrums.'\r\n\r\nMr. Brick saw it. Finally Uncle Bill was made to comprehend.\r\n\r\n'Very excellent, sir; very ingenious! Philadelphians may well be proud\r\nof the high position they have as punsters, utterers of _bon mots_ and\r\nconundrums,' said Rocjean; 'I have had the comfort of living in your\r\ncity, and thoroughly appreciating your--markets.'\r\n\r\nAfter Rocjean's the judges and Uncle Bill went to Caper's studio. As\r\nthey entered his room they found that ingenious youth walking, in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, in as large a circle as the room would permit, bearing on\r\nhis head a large canvas, while a quite pretty female model, named\r\nStella, sat on a sofa, marking down something on a piece of paper, using\r\nthe sole of her shoe for a writing-desk.\r\n\r\n'We-ell!' said Uncle Bill.\r\n\r\n'One more round,' quoth Caper, with unmoved countenance, 'and I will be\r\nwith you. That will make four hundred and fifty, won't it, Stella?'\r\n\r\n'_Eh, Gia_, one more is all you want.' And making an extra scratch with\r\na pencil, the female model surveyed the new-comers with a triumphant\r\nair, plainly saying: 'See there! I can write, but I am not proud.'\r\n\r\n'What are you about, Jim?'\r\n\r\n'Look at that painting!' answered Caper. 'The Blessing of the Donkeys,\r\nHorses, etc.; it is one of the most imposing ceremonies of the Church.\r\nAs my specialty is animal, I have chosen it for my painting; and not\r\ncontented with laboring faithfully on it, I have determined, in order to\r\nput the thing beyond a doubt as to my gaining the prize, to put the\r\n_most work_ on it of any of my rivals; so I have actually, as Stella\r\nwill tell you, carried it bodily four hundred and fifty times round this\r\nstudio.'\r\n\r\n'Instead of a painting, I should think you would have made a panting of\r\nit,' spoke Mr. Van Brick.\r\n\r\n'The idea seems to me artful,' added Mr. Pinchfip, 'but after all, this\r\npedestrian work was not on the painting, but under it; therefore,\r\naccording to Blackstone on contracts, this comes under the head of a\r\nconsideration _do, ut facias_, see vol. ii. page 360. How far moral\r\nobligation is a legal consideration, see note, vol. iii. p. 249\r\nBossanquet and Puller's Reports. The principle _servus facit, ut herus\r\ndet_, as laid down by....'\r\n\r\n'Jove!' exclaimed Uncle Bill, 'couldn't you stop off the torrent for one\r\nminute? I'm drowning--I give up--do with me as you see fit.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'And now,' said Mr. Van Brick, 'that we have seen the four paintings,\r\nlet us, Mr. Pinchfip, proceed calmly to discover who has won the five\r\nhundred dollars. Duly, deliberately, and gravely, let us put the four\r\nnames on four slips of paper, stir them up in a hat. Mr. Browne shall\r\nthen draw out a name, the owner of that name shall be the winner.'\r\n\r\nIt was drawn, and by good fortune for him, Bagswell won the five hundred\r\ndollars. Thus Uncle Bill Browne bought one painting for a good round\r\nsum, and three others at the stipulated price. Which one of the four had\r\nthe _most work_ on it, is, however, an unsettled question among three of\r\nthe artists, to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            FOR THE HOUR OF TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Victory comes with a palm in her hand,\r\n              With laurel upon her brow;\r\n            Cypress is clinging about her feet,\r\n            But its dark blossoms are red and sweet,\r\n              And the weeping mourners bow.\r\n\r\n            It is well. Through her tears, the widow smiles\r\n              To the child upon her knee;\r\n            'Thou'rt fatherless, darling; but he fell\r\n            Gallantly fighting, and long and well,\r\n              For the banner of the free!'\r\n\r\n            Then, weeping: 'Alas! for my lost, lost love;\r\n              Alas! for my own weak heart;\r\n            I know, when the storm shall pass away,\r\n            My boy, in manhood, would blush to say:\r\n              'My blood had therein no part.\"\r\n\r\n            The maiden her lover weeps, unconsoled,\r\n              So desolate is her gloom;\r\n            But a voice falls softly through the air,\r\n            Whispering comfort to her despair,\r\n              'Love _here_ hath fadeless bloom.'\r\n\r\n            The father laments for his boy, who fell\r\n              By Cumberland's river-side;\r\n            The sister, her brother loved the best,\r\n            Whose blood, in the dark and troubled West,\r\n              The father of waters dyed.\r\n\r\n            The mother--oh! silence your Spartan tales--\r\n              Says bravely, hushing a moan:\r\n            'I have yet _one_ left. My boy! go on;\r\n            Rear freedom's banner high in the sun!'\r\n              Then sits in the house alone.\r\n\r\n            To die for one's country is sweet, indeed!\r\n              To fight for the right is brave;\r\n            But there are brave hearts who vainly wait\r\n            Till triumph shall find them desolate,\r\n              Their hopes in a far-off grave.\r\n\r\n            O mourners! be patient; the end shall come;\r\n              The beautiful years of peace.\r\n            Remember! though hearts rebel the while\r\n            You hide your tears with a mournful smile,\r\n              That tyranny soon shall cease.\r\n\r\n            For victory comes, a palm in her hand,\r\n              Fresh garlands about her brow;\r\n            But the cypress trailing under her feet,\r\n            With crimson blossoms, by tears made sweet,\r\n              Shall wreathe with the laurel now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IN TRANSITU.\r\n\r\n\r\n            When the acid meets the alkali,\r\n            How they sputter, snap, and fly!\r\n            Such a crackling, such a pattering!\r\n            Such a hissing, such a spattering!\r\n\r\n            All in foaming discord tossed,\r\n            One would swear that all is lost.\r\n            Yet the equivalents soon blend,\r\n            All comes right at last i' the end.\r\n\r\n            Country mine!--'tis so with thee.\r\n            Wait--and all will quiet be!\r\n            Men, while working out a mission,\r\n            Must not fear the fierce transition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE PINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sauntered out, after the events recorded in the last paper, to inhale\r\nthe fresh air of the morning. A slight rain had fallen during the night,\r\nand it still moistened the dead leaves which carpeted the woods, making\r\nan extended walk out of the question; so, seating myself on the trunk of\r\na fallen tree, in the vicinity of the house, I awaited the hour for\r\nbreakfast. I had not remained there long before I heard the voices of my\r\nhost and Madam P---- on the front piazza:\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Alice, I can not--must not do it. If I overlook this, the\r\ndiscipline of the plantation is at an end.'\r\n\r\n'Do what you please with him when you return,' replied the lady, 'but do\r\nnot chain him up, and leave me, at such a time, alone. You know Jim is\r\nthe only one I can depend on.'\r\n\r\n'Well, have your own way. You know, my darling, I would not cause you a\r\nmoment's uneasiness, but I must follow up this d----d Moye.'\r\n\r\nI was seated where I could hear, though I could not see the speakers,\r\nbut it was evident from the tone of the last remark, that an action\r\naccompanied it quite as tender as the words. Being unwilling to overhear\r\nmore of a private conversation, I rose and approached them.\r\n\r\n'Ah! my dear fellow,' said the Colonel, on perceiving me, 'are you\r\nstirring so early? I was about to send to your room to ask if you'll go\r\nwith me up the country. My d----d overseer has got away, and I must\r\nfollow him at once.'\r\n\r\n'I'll go with pleasure,' I replied. 'Which way do you think Moye has\r\ngone?'\r\n\r\n'The shortest cut to the railroad, probably; but old Cæsar will track\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nA servant then announced breakfast--an early one having been prepared.\r\nWe hurried through the meal with all speed, and the other preparations\r\nbeing soon over, were in twenty minutes in our saddles, and ready for\r\nthe journey. The mulatto coachman, with a third horse, was at the door,\r\nready to accompany us, and as we mounted, the Colonel said to him:\r\n\r\n'Go and call Sam, the driver.'\r\n\r\nThe darky soon returned with the heavy, ugly-visaged black who had been\r\nwhipped, by Madam P----'s order, the day before.\r\n\r\n'Sam,' said his master, 'I shall be gone some days, and I leave the\r\nfield-work in your hands. Let me have a good account of you when I\r\nreturn.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, you shill dat,' replied the negro.\r\n\r\n'Put Jule--Sam's Jule--into the field, and see that she does full\r\ntasks,' continued the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Hain't she wanted 'mong de nusses, massa?'\r\n\r\n'Put some one else there--give her field-work; she needs it.'\r\n\r\nI will here explain that on large plantations the young children of the\r\nfield-women are left with them only at night, being herded together\r\nduring the day in a separate cabin, in charge of nurses. These nurses\r\nare feeble, sickly women, or recent mothers; and the fact of Jule's\r\nbeing employed in that capacity was evidence that she was unfit for\r\nout-door labor.\r\n\r\nMadam P----, who was waiting on the piazza to see us off, seemed about\r\nto remonstrate against this arrangement, but she hesitated a moment, and\r\nin that moment we had bidden her 'Good-by,' and galloped away.\r\n\r\nWe were soon at the cabin of the negro-hunter, and the coachman\r\ndismounting, called him out.\r\n\r\n'Hurry up, hurry up,' said the Colonel, as Sandy appeared, 'we haven't a\r\nmoment to spare.'\r\n\r\n'Jest so, jest so, Cunnel; I'll jine ye in a jiffin,' replied he of the\r\nreddish extremities.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the shanty with provoking deliberation--the impatience of\r\nmy host had infected me--the clay-eater slowly proceeded to mount the\r\nhorse of the negro, his dirt-bedraggled wife, and clay-incrusted\r\nchildren, following close at his heels, and the younger ones huddling\r\naround for the tokens of paternal affection usual at parting. Whether it\r\nwas the noise they made, or their frightful aspect, I know not, but the\r\nhorse, a spirited animal, took fright on their appearance, and nearly\r\nbroke away from the negro, who was holding him. Seeing this, the Colonel\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Clear out, you young scarecrows. Into the house with you.'\r\n\r\n'They hain't no more scarecrows than yourn, Cunnel J----,' said the\r\nmother, in a decidedly belligerent tone. 'You may 'buse my old man--he\r\nkin stand it--but ye shan't blackguard my young 'uns!'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel laughed, and was about to make a good-natured reply, when\r\nSandy yelled out:\r\n\r\n'Gwo enter the house and shet up, ye ---- ----.'\r\n\r\nWith this affectionate farewell, he turned his horse and led the way up\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nThe dog, who was a short distance in advance, soon gave a piercing howl,\r\nand started off at the speed of a reindeer. He had struck the trail, and\r\nurging our horses to their fastest speed, we followed.\r\n\r\nWe were all well mounted, but the mare the Colonel had given me was a\r\nmagnificent animal, as fleet as the wind, and with a gait so easy that\r\nher back seemed a rocking-chair. Saddle-horses at the South are trained\r\nto the gallop--Southern riders deeming it unnecessary that one's\r\nbreakfast should be churned into a Dutch cheese by a trotting nag, in\r\norder that one may pass for a good horseman.\r\n\r\nWe had ridden on at a perfect break-neck pace for half an hour, when the\r\nColonel shouted to our companion:\r\n\r\n'Sandy, call the dog in; the horses won't last ten miles at this\r\ngait--we've a long ride before us.'\r\n\r\nThe dirt-eater did as he was bidden, and we soon settled into a gentle\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nWe had passed through a dense forest of pines, but were emerging into a\r\n'bottom country,' where some of the finest deciduous trees, then brown\r\nand leafless, but bearing promise of the opening beauty of spring,\r\nreared, along with the unfading evergreen, their tall stems in the air.\r\nThe live-oak, the sycamore, the Spanish mulberry, the mimosa, and the\r\npersimmon, gayly festooned with wreaths of the white and yellow\r\njessamine, the woodbine and the cypress-moss, and bearing here and there\r\na bouquet of the mistletoe, with its deep green and glossy leaves\r\nupturned to the sun--flung their broad arms over the road, forming an\r\narchway grander and more beautiful than any the hand of man ever wove\r\nfor the greatest heroes the world has worshiped.\r\n\r\nThe woods were free from underbrush, but a coarse, wiry grass, unfit for\r\nfodder, and scattered through them in detached patches, was the only\r\nvegetation visible. The ground was mainly covered with the leaves and\r\nburs of the pine.\r\n\r\nWe passed great numbers of swine, feeding on these burs, and now and\r\nthen a horned animal browsing on the cypress-moss where it hung low on\r\nthe trees. I observed that nearly all the swine were marked, though they\r\nseemed too wild to have ever seen an owner, or a human habitation. They\r\nwere a long, lean, slab-sided race, with legs and shoulders like a deer,\r\nand bearing no sort of resemblance to the ordinary hog except in the\r\nsnout, and that feature was so much longer and sharper than the nose of\r\nthe Northern swine, that I doubt if Agassiz would class the two as one\r\nspecies. However, they have their uses--they make excellent bacon, and\r\nare 'death on snakes;' Ireland itself is not more free from the\r\nserpentine race than are the districts frequented by these long-nosed\r\nquadrupeds.\r\n\r\n'We call them Carolina race-horses,' said the Colonel, as he finished an\r\naccount of their peculiarities.\r\n\r\n'Race-horses! Why, are they fleet of foot?'\r\n\r\n'Fleet as deer. I'd match one against an ordinary horse at any time.'\r\n\r\n'Come, my friend, you're practicing on my ignorance of natural history.'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit of it. See! there's a good specimen yonder. If we can get him\r\ninto the road, and fairly started, I'll bet you a dollar he'll beat\r\nSandy's mare on a half-mile stretch--Sandy to hold the stakes and have\r\nthe winnings.'\r\n\r\n'Well, agreed,' I said, laughing, 'and I'll give the pig ten rods the\r\nstart.'\r\n\r\n'No,' replied the Colonel, 'you can't afford it. He'll _have_ to start\r\nahead, but you'll need that in the count. Come, Sandy, will you go in\r\nfor the pile?'\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that the native would not have run a race with Old Nicholas\r\nhimself, for the sake of so much money. To him it was a vast sum; and as\r\nhe thought of it, his eyes struck small sparks, and his enormous beard\r\nand mustachio vibrated with something that faintly resembled a laugh.\r\nReplying to the question, he said:\r\n\r\n'Kinder reckon I wull, Cunnel; howsomdever, I keeps the stakes, anyhow?'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' said the planter, 'but be honest--win if you can.'\r\n\r\nSandy halted his horse in the road, while the planter and I took to the\r\nwoods on either side of the way. The Colonel soon maneuvered to separate\r\nthe selected animal from the rest of the herd, and, without much\r\ndifficulty, got him into the road, where, by closing down on each flank,\r\nwe kept him till he and Sandy were fairly under way.\r\n\r\n'He'll keep to the road when once started,' said the Colonel, laughing,\r\n'and he'll show you some of the tallest running you ever saw in your\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\nAway they went. At first the pig seemed not exactly to comprehend the\r\nprogramme, for he cantered off at a leisurely pace, though he held his\r\nown. Soon, however, he cast an eye behind him--halted a moment to\r\ncollect his thoughts and reconnoiter--and then, lowering his head and\r\nelevating his tail, put forth all his speed. And such speed! Talk of a\r\ndeer, the wind, or a steam-engine--their gait is not to be compared with\r\nit. Nothing in nature I have ever seen run--except, it may be, a\r\nSouthern tornado, or a Sixth Ward politician--could hope to distance\r\nthat pig. He gained on the horse at every pace, and I soon saw that my\r\ndollar was gone!\r\n\r\n'In for a shilling in for a pound,' is the adage, so turning to the\r\nColonel, I said, as intelligibly as my horse's rapid steps, and my own\r\nexcited risibilities would allow:\r\n\r\n'I see I've lost, but I'll go you another dollar that you can't beat the\r\npig!'\r\n\r\n'No--sir!' the Colonel got out in the breaks of his laughing explosions;\r\n'you can't hedge on me in that manner. I'll go a dollar that _you_ can't\r\ndo it, and your mare is the fastest on the road. She won me a thousand\r\nnot a month ago.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll do it; Sandy to have the stakes.'\r\n\r\n'Agreed,' said the Colonel, and away we went.\r\n\r\nThe swinish racer was about a hundred yards ahead when I gave the mare\r\nthe reins, and told her to go. And she did go. She flew against the wind\r\nwith a motion so rapid that my face, as it clove the air, felt as if\r\ncutting its way through a solid body, and the trees, as we passed,\r\nseemed taken with a panic, and running for dear life in the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments I thought the mare was gaining, and I turned to the\r\nColonel with an exultant look.\r\n\r\n'Don't shout till you win, my boy,' he called out from the distance\r\nwhere I was fast leaving him and Sandy.\r\n\r\n_I did not shout_, for spite of all my efforts the space between me and\r\nthe pig seemed to widen. Yet I kept on, determined to win, till, at the\r\nend of a short half-mile, we reached the Waccamaw--the swine still a\r\nhundred yards ahead! There his pig-ship halted, turned coolly around,\r\neyed me for a moment, then quietly and deliberately trotted off into the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nA bend in the road kept my companions out of sight for a few moments,\r\nand when they came up I had somewhat recovered my breath, though the\r\nmare was blowing hard, and reeking with foam.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said the Colonel, 'what do you think of our bacon 'as it runs'?'\r\n\r\n'I think the Southern article can't be beat, whether raw or cooked,\r\nstanding or running.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment the hound, who had been leisurely jogging along in the\r\nrear, disdaining to join in the race in which his dog of a master and I\r\nhad engaged, came up, and dashing quickly on to the river's edge, set up\r\na most dismal howling. The Colonel dismounted, and clambering down the\r\nbank, which was there twenty feet high, and very steep, shouted out:\r\n\r\n'The d--d Yankee has swum the stream!'\r\n\r\n'Why so?' Tasked.\r\n\r\n'To cover his tracks and delay pursuit; but he has overshot the mark.\r\nThere is no other road within ten miles, and he must have taken to this\r\none again beyond here. He's lost twenty minutes by that maneuver. Come,\r\nSandy, call on the dog, we'll push on a little faster.'\r\n\r\n'But he tuk to t'other bank, Cunnel. Shan't we trail him thar?' asked\r\nSandy.\r\n\r\n'And suppose he found a boat here,' I suggested, 'and made the shore\r\nsome ways down?'\r\n\r\n'He couldn't get Firefly into a boat--we should only waste time in\r\nscouring the other bank. The swamp this side the next run has forced him\r\ninto the road within five miles. The trick is transparent. He took me\r\nfor a fool,' replied the Colonel, answering both questions at once.\r\n\r\nI had reined my horse out of the road, and when my companions turned to\r\ngo, was standing at the edge of the bank, overlooking the river.\r\nSuddenly I saw, on one of the abutments of the bridge, what seemed a\r\nlong, black log--strange to say, _in motion!_\r\n\r\n'Colonel,' I shouted, 'see there! a living log, as I'm a white man!'\r\n\r\n'Lord bless you,' cried the planter, taking an observation, 'it's an\r\nalligator!'\r\n\r\nI said no more, but pressing on after the hound, soon left my companions\r\nout of sight. For long afterward, the Colonel, in a doleful way, would\r\nallude to my lamentable deficiency in natural history--particularly in\r\nsuch branches as bacon and 'living logs.'\r\n\r\nI had ridden about five miles, keeping well up with the hound, and had\r\nreached the edge of the swamp, when suddenly the dog darted to the side\r\nof the road, and began to yelp in the most frantic manner. Dismounting,\r\nand leading my horse to the spot, I made out plainly the print of\r\nFirefly's feet in the sand. There was no mistaking it--that round shoe\r\non the off fore-foot. (The horse had, when a colt, a cracked hoof, and\r\nthough the wound was outgrown, the foot was still tender.) These prints\r\nwere dry, while the tracks we had seen at the river were filled with\r\nwater, thus proving that the rain ceased while the overseer was passing\r\nbetween the two places. He was then not far off.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel and Sandy soon rode up.\r\n\r\n'Caught a living log! eh, my good fellow?' asked my host, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n'No; but here's the overseer as plain as daylight; and his tracks not\r\nwet!'\r\n\r\nQuickly dismounting, he examined the ground, and then exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'The d--l! it's a fact--here not four hours ago! He has doubled on his\r\ntracks since, I'll wager, and not made twenty miles--we'll have him\r\nbefore night, sure! Come, mount--quick.'\r\n\r\nWe sprang into our saddles, and again pressed rapidly on after the dog,\r\nwho followed the scent at the top of his speed.\r\n\r\nSome three miles more of wet, miry road took us to the run of which the\r\nColonel had spoken. Arrived there, we found the hound standing on the\r\nbank, wet to the skin, and looking decidedly chop-fallen.\r\n\r\n'Death and d--n!' shouted the Colonel; 'the dog has swum the run, and\r\nlost the trail on the other side! The d--d scoundrel has taken to the\r\nwater, and balked us after all! Take up the dog, Sandy, and try him\r\nagain over there.'\r\n\r\nThe native spoke to Cæsar, who bounded on to the horse's back in front\r\nof his master. They then crossed the stream, which there was about fifty\r\nyards wide, and so shallow that in the deepest part the water only\r\ntouched the horse's breast, but it was so roiled by the recent rain that\r\nwe could not distinguish the foot-prints of the horse beneath the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe dog ranged up and down on the opposite bank, but all to no purpose:\r\nthe overseer had not been there. He had gone either up or down the\r\nstream--in which direction, was now the question. Calling Sandy back to\r\nour side of the run, the Colonel proceeded to hold a 'council of war.'\r\nEach one gave his opinion, which was canvassed by the others, with as\r\nmuch solemnity as if the fate of the Union hung on the decision.\r\n\r\nThe native proposed we should separate--one go up, another down the\r\nstream, and the third, with the dog, follow the road; to which he\r\nthought Moye had finally returned. Those who should explore the run\r\nwould easily detect the horse's tracks where he had left it, and then\r\ntaking a straight course to the road, we could all meet some five miles\r\nfurther on, at a place indicated.\r\n\r\nI gave in my adhesion to Sandy's plan, but the Colonel overruled it on\r\nthe ground of the waste of time to be incurred in thus recovering the\r\noverseer's trail.\r\n\r\n'Why not,' he said, 'strike at once for the end of his route? Why follow\r\nthe slow steps he took in order to throw us off the track? He has not\r\ncome back to this road. Six miles below there is another one leading\r\nalso to the railway. He has taken that. We might as well send Sandy and\r\nthe dog back at once, and go on by ourselves.'\r\n\r\n'But if bound for the Station, why should he wade through the creek\r\nhere, sis miles out of his way? Why not go straight on by the road?' I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n'Because he knew the dog would track him, and he hoped by taking to the\r\nrun to make me think he had crossed the country instead of striking for\r\nthe railroad.'\r\n\r\nI felt sure the Colonel was wrong, but knowing him to be tenacious of\r\nhis own opinions, I made no further objection.\r\n\r\nDirecting Sandy to call on Madam P---- and acquaint her with our\r\nprogress, he then dismissed the negro-hunter, and we once more turned\r\nour horses up the road.\r\n\r\nThe next twenty miles, like our previous route, lay through an unbroken\r\nforest, but as we left the water-courses, we saw nothing but the gloomy\r\npines, which there--the region being remote from the means of\r\ntransportation--were seldom tapped, and presented few of the openings\r\nthat invite the weary traveler to the dwelling of the hospitable\r\nplanter.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the sky, which had been bright and cloudless all the\r\nmorning, grew overcast and gave out tokens of a coming storm. A black\r\ncloud gathered in the west, and random flashes darted from it far off in\r\nthe distance; then gradually it neared us; low mutterings sounded in the\r\nair, and the tops of the tall pines a few miles away, were lit up now\r\nand then with a fitful blaze, all the brighter for the deeper gloom that\r\nsucceeded. Then a terrific flash and peal broke directly over us, and a\r\ngreat tree, struck by a red-hot bolt, fell with a deafening crash,\r\nhalf-way across our path. Peal after peal followed, and then the\r\nrain--not filtered into drops as it falls from our colder sky, but in\r\nbroad, blinding sheets, poured full and heavy on our shelterless heads.\r\n\r\n'Ah! there it comes!' shouted the Colonel. 'God have mercy upon us!'\r\n\r\nSuddenly a crashing, crackling, thundering roar rose above the storm,\r\nfilling the air, and shaking the solid earth till it trembled beneath\r\nour horses' feet, as if upheaved by a volcano. Nearer and nearer the\r\nsound came, till it seemed that all the legions of darkness were\r\nunloosed in the forest, and were mowing down the great pines as the\r\nmower mows the grass with big scythe. Then an awful, sweeping crash\r\nthundered directly at our backs, and turning round, as if to face a\r\nfoe, my horse, who had borne the roar and the blinding flash till then,\r\nunmoved, paralyzed with dread, and panting for breath, sunk to the\r\nground; while close at my side the Colonel, standing erect in his\r\nstirrups, his head uncovered to the pouring sky, cried out:\r\n\r\n'THANK GOD, WE ARE SAVED!'\r\n\r\nThere--not three hundred yards in our rear, had passed the\r\nTORNADO--uprooting trees, prostrating dwellings, and sending many a soul\r\nto its last account, but sparing us for another day! For thirty miles\r\nthrough the forest it had mowed a swath of two hundred feet, then moved\r\non to stir the ocean to its briny depths.\r\n\r\nWith a full heart, I remounted, and turning my horse, pressed on in the\r\nrain. We said not a word till a friendly opening pointed the way to a\r\nplanter's dwelling. Then calling to me to follow, the Colonel dashed up\r\nthe by-path which led to the mansion, and in five minutes we were\r\nwarming our chilled limbs before the cheerful fire that roared and\r\ncrackled on its broad hearth-stone.\r\n\r\nThe house was a large, old-fashioned frame building, square as a\r\npacking-box, and surrounded, as all country dwellings at the South are,\r\nby a broad, open piazza. Our summons was answered by its owner, a\r\nwell-to-do, substantial, middle-aged planter, wearing the ordinary\r\nhomespun of the district, but evidently of a station in life much above\r\nthe common 'corn-crackers' I had seen at the country meeting-house. The\r\nColonel was an acquaintance, and greeting us with great cordiality, our\r\nhost led the way directly to the sitting-room. There we found a bright,\r\nblazing fire, and a pair of bright, blazing eyes, the latter belonging\r\nto a blithesome young woman of about twenty, with a cheery face, and a\r\nhalf-rustic, half-cultivated air, whom our new friend introduced to us\r\nas his wife.\r\n\r\n'I regret not having had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. S---- before, but\r\nam very happy to meet her now,' said the Colonel, with all the\r\nwell-bred, gentlemanly ease that distinguished him.\r\n\r\n'The pleasure is mutual, Colonel J----,' replied the lady, 'but thirty\r\nmiles in this wild country should not have made a neighbor so distant as\r\nyou have been.'\r\n\r\n'Business, madam, is at fault, as your husband knows. I have much to do;\r\nand besides, all my connections are in the other direction--with\r\nCharleston.'\r\n\r\n'It's a fact, Sally, the Colonel is the d----st busy man in these parts.\r\nNot content with a big plantation and three hundred niggers, he looks\r\nafter all South-Carolina, and the rest of creation to boot,' said our\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n'Tom will have his joke, madam, but he's not far from the truth.'\r\n\r\nSeeing we were dripping wet, the lady offered us a change of clothing,\r\nand retiring to a chamber, we each appropriated a suit belonging to our\r\nhost, giving our own to a servant to be dried.\r\n\r\nArrayed in the fresh apparel, we soon rejoined our friends in the\r\nsitting-room. The new garments fitted the Colonel tolerably well, but\r\nthough none too long, they were a world too wide for me, and, as my wet\r\nhair hung in smooth, flat folds down my cheeks, and my limp shirt-collar\r\nfell over my linsey coat, I looked for all the world like a cross\r\nbetween a theatrical Aminadab Sleek and Sir John Falstaff, with the\r\nstuffing omitted. When our hostess caught sight of me in this new garb,\r\nshe rubbed her hands together in great glee, and, springing to her feet,\r\ngave vent to a perfect storm of laughter--jerking out between the\r\nexplosions:\r\n\r\n'Why--you--you--look jest like--a scare-crow.'\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking that hearty, hoidenish manner; and seizing both\r\nof her hands in mine, I shouted: 'I've found you out--you're a\r\n'country-woman' of mine--a clear-blooded Yankee!'\r\n\r\n'What! _you_ a Yankee!' she exclaimed, still laughing, 'and here with\r\nthis horrid 'seceshener,' as they call him.'\r\n\r\n'True as preachin', ma'am,' I replied, adopting the drawl--'all the way\r\nfrom Down East, and Union, tu, stiff as buckram.'\r\n\r\n'Du tell!' she exclaimed, swinging my hands together as she held them in\r\nhers. 'If I warn't hitched to this ere feller, I'd give ye a smack right\r\non the spot. I'm _so_ glad to see ye.'\r\n\r\n'Do it, Sally--never mind _me_,' cried her husband, joining heartily in\r\nthe merriment.\r\n\r\nSeizing the collar of my coat with both hands, she drew my face down\r\ntill my lips almost touched hers, (I was preparing to blush, and the\r\nColonel shouted, 'Come, come, I shall tell his wife,') but then, turning\r\nquickly on her heel, she threw herself into a chair, exclaiming, 'I\r\nwouldn't mind, but the _old man would be jealous;_' and adding to the\r\nColonel, 'You needn't be troubled, sir; no Yankee girl will kiss _you_\r\ntill you change your politics.'\r\n\r\n'Give me that inducement, and I'll change them on the spot,' said the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\n'No, no, Dave, 'twouldn't do,' replied the planter, 'the conversion\r\nwouldn't be genuwine--besides, such things arn't proper, except with\r\nblood-relations--and all the Yankees, you know, are first-cousins.'\r\n\r\nThe conversation then subsided into a more placid mood, but lost none of\r\nits genial good-humor. Refreshments were soon set before us, and while\r\npartaking of them I gathered from our hostess that she was a Vermont\r\ncountry-girl, who, some three years before, had been induced by liberal\r\npay, to come South as a teacher. A sister accompanied her, who, about a\r\nyear after their arrival, had married a neighboring planter. Wishing to\r\nbe near the sister, our hostess had also married and settled down for\r\nlife in that wild region. 'I like the country very well,' she added;\r\n'it's a great sight easier living here than in Vermont; but I do hate\r\nthese lazy, shiftless, good-for-nothing niggers; they are _so_ slow, and\r\n_so_ careless, and _so_ dirty, that I sometimes think they will worry\r\nthe very life out of me. I du believe I'm the hardest mistress in all\r\nthe district.'\r\n\r\nI learned from her that a majority of the teachers at the South are from\r\nthe North, and principally, too, from New-England. Teaching is a very\r\nlaborious employment there, far more so than with us, for the\r\nSoutherners have no methods like ours, and the same teacher usually has\r\nto hear lessons in branches all the way from Greek and Latin to the\r\nsimple A B C. The South has no system of public instruction; no common\r\nschools; no means of placing within the reach of the sons and daughters\r\nof the poor even the elements of knowledge. While the children of the\r\nwealthy are most carefully educated, it is the policy of the ruling\r\nclass to keep the great mass of the people in ignorance; and so long as\r\nthis policy continues, so long will that section be as far behind the\r\nNorth as it now is in all that constitutes the elements of prosperity\r\nand true greatness.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore rapidly and pleasantly away in the genial society of\r\nour wayside friends. Politics were discussed, (our host was a Union\r\nman,) the prospects of the turpentine crop talked over, the recent news\r\ncanvassed, the usual neighborly topics touched upon, and--I hesitate to\r\nconfess it--a considerable quantity of corn-whisky disposed of, before\r\nthe Colonel discovered, all at once, that it was six o'clock, and we\r\nwere still seventeen miles from the railway station. Arraying ourselves\r\nagain in our dried garments, we bade a hasty but regretful 'good-by' to\r\nour hospitable entertainers, and once more took to the road.\r\n\r\nThe storm had cleared away, but the ground was heavy with the recent\r\nrain, and our horses were sadly jaded with the ride of the morning. We\r\ntherefore gave them the reins, and as they jogged on at their leisure,\r\nit was ten o'clock at night before we reached the little hamlet of\r\nW----Station, in the State of North-Carolina.\r\n\r\nA large hotel, or station-house, and about a dozen log-shanties made up\r\nthe village. Two of these structures were negro-cabins; two were small\r\ngroceries, in which the vilest alcoholic compounds were sold at a bit\r\n(ten cents) a glass; one was a lawyer's office, in which was the\r\npost-office, and a justice's court, where, once a month, the small\r\noffenders of the vicinity 'settled up their accounts;' one was a\r\ntailoring and clothing establishment, where breeches were patched at a\r\ndime a stitch, and payment taken in tar and turpentine; and the rest\r\nwere private dwellings of one apartment, occupied by the grocers, the\r\ntailor, the switch-tender, the post-master, and the negro _attachés_ of\r\nthe railroad. The church and the school-house--the first buildings to go\r\nup in a Northern village, I have omitted to enumerate, because--they\r\nwere not there.\r\n\r\nOne of the natives told me that the lawyer was a 'stuck-up critter;' 'he\r\ndon't live; he don't--he puts-up at th' hotel.' And the hotel! Would\r\nShakspeare, had he known of it, have written of taking one's _ease_ at\r\nhis inn? It was a long, framed building, two stories in hight, with a\r\npiazza extending across its side, and a front door crowded as closely\r\ninto one corner as the width of the joist would permit. Under the\r\npiazza, ranged along the wall, was a low bench, occupied by about forty\r\ntin wash-basins and water-pails, with coarse, dirty crash towels\r\nsuspended on rollers above them. By the side of each of these towels\r\nhung a comb and a brush, to which a lock of every body's hair was\r\nclinging, forming in the total a stock sufficient to establish any\r\nbarber in the wig business.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, ten o'clock when we reached the station.\r\nThrowing the bridles of our horses over the hitching-posts at the door,\r\nwe at once made our way to the bar-room. That apartment, which was in\r\nthe rear of the building, and communicated with by a long, narrow\r\npassage, was filled almost to suffocation, when we entered, by a cloud\r\nof tobacco-smoke, the fumes of bad whisky, and a crowd of drunken\r\nchivalry, through whom the Colonel with great difficulty elbowed his way\r\nto the counter, where 'mine host' and two assistants were dispensing\r\n'liquid death,' at the rate of ten cents a glass, and of ten glasses a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n'Hello, Colonel! how ar' ye?' cried the red-faced liquor-vender, as he\r\ncaught sight of my companion, and--relinquishing his lucrative\r\nemployment for a moment--took the Colonel's hand.\r\n\r\n'Quite well, thank you, Miles,' said the Colonel, with a certain\r\npatronizing air, 'have you seen my man Moye?'\r\n\r\n'Moye, no! What's up with him?'\r\n\r\n'He's run away with my horse, Firefly--I thought he would have made for\r\nthis station. At what time does the next train go up?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, it's due half arter 'leven, but 'taint gin'rally 'long till nigh\r\none.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was turning to join me at the door, when a well-dressed\r\nyoung man of very unsteady movements, who was filling a glass at the\r\ncounter, and staring at him with a sort of dreamy amazement, stammered\r\nout: 'Moye--run--run a--way, zir! that--k--kant be--by G--d. I\r\nknow--him, zir--he's a--a friend of mine, and--I'm--I'm d--d if he an't\r\nhon--honest.'\r\n\r\n'About as honest as the Yankees run,' replied the Colonel: 'he's a d--d\r\nthief, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Look here--here, zir--don't--don't you--you zay any--thing 'gainst--the\r\nYankees. D--d if--if I an't--one of 'em mezelf--zir,' said the fellow\r\nstaggering toward the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'_I_ don't care _what_, you are; you're drunk.'\r\n\r\n'You lie--you--you d--d 'ris--'ristocrat--take that,' was the reply, and\r\nthe inebriated gentleman aimed a blow, with all his unsteady might, at\r\nthe Colonel's face.\r\n\r\nThe South-Carolinian stepped quickly aside, and dexterously threw his\r\nfoot before the other, who--his blow not meeting the expected\r\nresistance--was unable to recover himself, and fell headlong to the\r\nfloor. The Colonel turned on his heel, and was walking quietly away,\r\nwhen the sharp report of a pistol sounded through the apartment, and a\r\nball tore through the top of his boot, and lodged in the wall within\r\ntwo feet of where I was standing. With a spring, quick and sure as the\r\ntiger's, the Colonel was on the drunken man. Wrenching away the weapon,\r\nhe seized the fellow by the necktie, and drawing him up to nearly his\r\nfull hight, dashed him at one throw to the other side of the room. Then\r\nraising the revolver he coolly leveled it to fire.\r\n\r\nBut a dozen strong men were on him. The pistol was out of his hand, and\r\nhis arms were pinioned in an instant; while cries of 'Fair play, sir!'\r\n'He's drunk!' 'Don't hit a man when he's down,' and other like\r\nexclamations, came from all sides.\r\n\r\n'Give _me_ fair play, you d--d North-Carolina hounds,' cried the\r\nColonel, struggling violently to get away, 'and I'll fight the whole\r\nposse of you.'\r\n\r\n'One's 'nuff for _you_, ye d--d fire-eatin' 'ristocrat,' said a long,\r\nlean, bushy-haired, be-whiskered individual who was standing near the\r\ncounter: 'ef ye wan't ter fight, _I'll_ 'tend to yer case to onst. Let\r\nhim go, boys,' he continued as he stepped toward the Colonel, and parted\r\nthe crowd that had gathered around him: 'give him the shootin'-iron, and\r\nlet's see ef he'll take a man thet's sober.'\r\n\r\nI saw serious trouble was impending, and stepping forward, I said to the\r\nlast speaker: 'My friend, you have no quarrel with this gentleman. He\r\nhas treated that man only as you would have done.'\r\n\r\n'P'raps thet's so; but he's a d--d hound of a Seseshener thet's draggin'\r\nus all to h--l; it'll do th' cuntry good to git quit of one on 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Whatever his politics are, he's a gentleman, sir, and has done you no\r\nharm--let me beg of you to let him alone.'\r\n\r\n'Don't beg any thing for me, Mr. K----' growled the Colonel through his\r\nbarred teeth, 'I'll fight the d--d corn-cracker, and his whole race, at\r\nonce.'\r\n\r\n'No you won't, my friend. For the sake of those at home you won't,' I\r\nsaid, as I took him by the arm, and partly led, partly forced, him\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\n'And who in h--l ar ye?' asked the 'corn-cracker,' planting himself\r\nsquarely in my way.\r\n\r\n'I'm on the same side of politics with you, Union to the core!' I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n'Ye ar! Union! Then giv us yer fist,' said he, grasping me by the hand,\r\n'by----it does a feller good to see a man dressed in yer cloes thet\r\nhaint 'fraid ter say he's Union, so close to South-Car'lina, tu, as this\r\nar! Come, hev a drink: come, boys--all round--let's liquor!'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me now, my dear fellow--some other time I'll be glad to join\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'Jest as ye say, but thar's my fist, enyhow.'\r\n\r\nHe gave me another hearty shake of the hand, and the crowd parting, I\r\nmade my way with the Colonel out of the room. We were followed by Miles,\r\nthe landlord, who, when we had reached the front of the entrance-way,\r\nsaid: 'I'm right sorry for this row, gentlemen; but th' boys will hev a\r\ntime when they git together.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! never mind,' said the Colonel, who had recovered his coolness; 'but\r\nwhy are all these people here?'\r\n\r\n'Thar's a barbecue cumin' off to-morrer on the camp-ground, and the\r\nhouse is cram full.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so?' said the Colonel, then turning to me he added, 'Moye has\r\ntaken the railroad somewhere else; I must get to a telegraph-office at\r\nonce, to head him off. The nearest one is Wilmington. With all these\r\nrowdies here, it will not do to leave the horses alone--will you stay\r\nand keep an eye on them over to-morrow?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I will, cheerfully.'\r\n\r\n'Thar's a mighty hard set round har now, Cunnel,' said the landlord;\r\n'and the most peaceable git inter scrapes ef they han't no friends.\r\nHadn't ye better show the gentleman some of your'n, 'fore you go?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, I didn't think of that. Who is here?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, thar's Cunnel Taylor, Bill Barnes, Sam Heddleson, Jo' Shackelford.\r\nAndy Jones, Rob Brown, and lots of others.'\r\n\r\n'Where's Andy Jones?'\r\n\r\n'Reckon he's turned in; I'll see.' As the landlord opened a door which\r\nled from the hall, the Colonel said to me: 'Andy is a Union man, but\r\nhe'd fight to the death for me.'\r\n\r\n'Sal!' called out the hotel-keeper.\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, I'se har,' was the answer from a slatternly woman, awfully\r\nblack in the face, who soon thrust her head from the door.\r\n\r\n'Is Andy Jones har?' asked Miles.\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, he'm turned in up thar on de table.'\r\n\r\nWe followed the landlord into the apartment. It was the dining-room of\r\nthe hotel, and by the dim light which came from a smoky fire on the\r\nhearth, I saw it contained about a hundred people, who, wrapped in\r\nblankets, bed-quilts and traveling-shawls, and disposed in all\r\nconceivable attitudes, were scattered about on the hard floor and\r\ntables, sleeping soundly. The room was a long, low apartment--extending\r\nacross the whole front of the house--and had a wretched, squalid look.\r\nThe fire, which was tended by the negro-woman, (she had spread a blanket\r\non the floor, and was keeping a drowsy watch over it for the night,) had\r\nbeen recently replenished with green wood, and was throwing out thick\r\nvolumes of black smoke, which, mixing with the effluvia from the lungs\r\nof a hundred sleepers made up an atmosphere next to impossible to\r\nbreathe. Not a window was open, and not an aperture for ventilation\r\ncould be seen!\r\n\r\nCarefully avoiding the arms and legs of the recumbent chivalry, we\r\npicked our way, guided by the negro-girl, to the corner of the room\r\nwhere the Unionist was sleeping. Shaking him briskly by the shoulder,\r\nthe Colonel called out: 'Andy! Andy! wake up!'\r\n\r\n'What--what the d----l is the matter?' stammered out the sleeper,\r\ngradually opening his eyes, and raising himself on one elbow, 'Lord\r\nbless you, Cunnel, is thet you? what in----brought _you_ har?'\r\n\r\n'Business, Andy. Come, get up, I want to see you, and I can't talk\r\nhere.'\r\n\r\nThe North-Carolinian slowly rose, and throwing his blanket over his\r\nshoulders, followed us from the room. When we had reached the open air\r\nthe Colonel introduced me to his friend, who expressed surprise, and a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure, at meeting a Northern Union man in the Colonel's\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n'Look after our horses, now, Miles; Andy and I want to talk,' said the\r\nplanter to the landlord, with about as little ceremony as he would have\r\nshown to a negro.\r\n\r\nI thought the white man did not exactly relish the Colonel's manner, but\r\nsaying: 'All right, all right, sir,' he took himself away.\r\n\r\nThe night was raw and cold, but as all the rooms of the hotel were\r\noccupied, either by sleepers or carousers, we had no other alternative\r\nthan to hold our conference in the open-air. Near the railway-track a\r\nlight-wood fire was blazing, and, obeying the promptings of the frosty\r\natmosphere, we made our way to it. Lying on the ground around it,\r\ndivested of all clothing except a pair of linsey trowsers and a flannel\r\nshirt, and with their naked feet close to its blaze--roasting at one\r\nextremity, and freezing at the other--were several blacks, the\r\nswitch-tenders and woodmen of the station--fast asleep. How human beings\r\ncould sleep in such circumstances seemed a marvel, but further\r\nobservation convinced me that the Southern negro has a natural aptitude\r\nfor that exercise, and will, indeed, bear more exposure than any other\r\nliving thing. Nature in giving him such powers of endurance, seems to\r\nhave specially fitted him for the life of hardship and privation to\r\nwhich he is born.\r\n\r\nThe fire-light enabled me to scan the appearance of my new acquaintance.\r\nHe was rather above the medium height, squarely and somewhat stoutly\r\nbuilt, and had an easy and self-possessed, though rough and unpolished\r\nmanner. His face, or so much of it as was visible from underneath a\r\nthick mass of reddish gray hair, denoted a firm, decided character; but\r\nthere was a manly, open, honest expression about it that won your\r\nconfidence in a moment. He wore a slouched hat and a suit of the\r\nordinary 'sheep's-gray,' cut in the 'sack' fashion, and hanging loosely\r\nabout him. He seemed a man who had made his own way in the world, and I\r\nsubsequently learned that appearances did not belie him. The son of a\r\n'poor white' man, with scarcely the first rudiments of book-education,\r\nhe had, by sterling worth, natural ability, and great force of\r\ncharacter, accumulated a handsome property, and acquired a leading\r\nposition in his adopted district. Though on 'the wrong side of\r\npolitics,' his personal popularity was so great that for several\r\nsuccessive years he had been elected to represent his county in the\r\nState Legislature. The Colonel, though opposed to him in politics--and\r\nparty feeling at the South runs so high that political opponents are\r\nseldom personal friends--had, in the early part of his career, aided him\r\nby his indorsements; and Andy had not forgotten the service. It was easy\r\nto see that while two men could not be more unlike in character and\r\nappearance than my host and the North-Carolinian, they were warm and\r\nintimate friends.\r\n\r\n'So, Moye has been raisin h--l gin'rally, Cunnel,' said my new\r\nacquaintance after a time. 'I'm not surprised. I never did b'lieve in\r\nYankee nigger-drivers--sumhow it's agin natur for a Northern man to go\r\nSouthern principles quite so strong as Moye did.'\r\n\r\n'Which route do you think he has taken?' asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Wal, I reckon arter he tuk to the run, he made fur the mountings. He\r\nknow'd you'd head him on the traveled routes; so he's put, I think, fur\r\nthe Missusippe, where he'll sell the horse and make North.'\r\n\r\n'I'll follow him,' said the Colonel, 'to the ends of the earth. If it\r\ncosts me five thousand dollars, I'll see him hung.'\r\n\r\n'Wal,' replied Andy, laughing, 'if he's gone North, you'll need a\r\nextradition treaty to kotch him. South-Car'lina, I b'lieve, has set up\r\nfur a furrin country.'\r\n\r\n'That's true,' said the Colonel, also laughing, 'she's 'furrin' to the\r\nYankees, but not to the old North State.'\r\n\r\n'D----d if she han't,' replied the North-Carolinian, 'and now she's got\r\nout on our company, I swear she must keep out. We'd as soon think of\r\ngoin' to h--l in summer time, as of joining partnership with her.\r\nCunnel, you're the only decent man in the State--d----d if you\r\nhan't--and your politics are a'most bad 'nuff to spile a township. It\r\nallers seemed sort o' queer to me, thet a man with such a mighty good\r\nheart as your'n could be so short in the way of brains.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you're complimentary,' replied the Colonel, with the utmost good\r\nnature, 'but let's drop politics; we never could agree, you know. What\r\nshall I do about Moye?'\r\n\r\n'Go to Wilmington, and telegraph all creation: wait a day to har, then\r\nif you don't har, go home, hire a native overseer, and let Moye go to\r\nthe d---l. Ef it'll du you any good, I'll go to Wilmington with you,\r\nthough I did mean to give you secesheners a little h--l here to-morrer.'\r\n\r\n'No, Andy, I'll go alone. 'Twouldn't be patriotic to take you away from\r\nthe barbecue. You'd 'spile' if you couldn't let off some gas soon.'\r\n\r\n'I du b'lieve I shud. Howsumdever, thar's nary a thing I wouldn't do for\r\nyou--you knows thet?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I do, and I wish you'd keep an eye on my Yankee friend here, and\r\nsee he don't get into trouble with any of the boys--there'll be a hard\r\nset 'round, I reckon.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I will,' said Andy, 'but all he's to du is--keep mouth shet.'\r\n\r\n'That seems easy enough,' I replied, laughing.\r\n\r\nA desultory conversation followed for about an hour, when the\r\nsteam-whistle sounded, and the up-train arrived. The Colonel got on\r\nboard, and bidding us 'good-night,' went on to Wilmington. Andy then\r\nproposed we should look up sleeping accommodations. It was useless to\r\nseek quarters at the hotel, but an empty car was on the turn-out, and\r\nbribing one of the negroes, we got access to it, and were soon stretched\r\nat full length on two of its hard-bottomed seats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe camp-ground was about a mile from the station, and pleasantly\r\nsituated in a grove, near a stream of water. It was in frequent use by\r\nthe camp-meetings of the Methodist denomination, which sect, at the\r\nSouth, is partial to these rural religious gatherings. Scattered over\r\nit, with an effort at regularity, were about forty small but neat log\r\ncottages, thatched with the long leaves of the turpentine-pine, and\r\nchinked with branches of the same tree. Each of these houses was floored\r\nwith leaves or straw, and large enough to afford sleeping accommodations\r\nfor about ten person, provided they spread their bedding on the ground,\r\nand lay tolerably close together. Interspersed among the cabins were\r\nabout a dozen canvas tents, which evidently had been erected for this\r\nespecial occasion.\r\n\r\nNearly in the centre of the group of huts, a rude sort of scaffold, four\r\nor five feet high, and surrounded by a rustic railing, served for the\r\nspeaker's stand. It would seat about a dozen persons, and was protected\r\nby a roof of pine-boughs, interlaced together so as to keep off the sun,\r\nwithout affording protection from the rain. In the rear of this stand\r\nwere two long tables, made of rough boards, and supported on stout\r\njoists, crossed on each other in the form of the letter X. A canopy of\r\ngreen boughs shaded the grounds, and the whole grove, which was\r\nperfectly free from underbrush, was carpeted with the soft, brown leaves\r\nof the pine.\r\n\r\nBeing fatigued with the ride of the previous day, I did not awake till\r\nthe morning was well advanced, and it was nearly ten o'clock when Andy\r\nand I took our way to the camp-ground. Avoiding the usual route, we\r\nwalked on through the forest. It was mid-winter, and vegetation lay dead\r\nall around us, awaiting the time when spring should breathe into it the\r\nbreath of life and make it a living thing. There was silence and rest in\r\nthe deep wood. The birds were away on their winter wanderings; the\r\nleaves hung motionless on the tall trees, and nature seemed resting from\r\nher ceaseless labor, and listening to the soft music of the little\r\nstream which sung a cheerful song as it rambled on over the roots and\r\nfallen branches that blocked its way. But soon a distant murmur arose,\r\nand we had not proceeded far before as many sounds as were heard at\r\nBabel made a strange concert about our ears. The lowing of the ox, the\r\nneighing of the horse, and the deep braying of another animal, mingled\r\nwith a thousand human voices, came through the woods. But above and over\r\nall rose the stentorian tones of the stump speaker,\r\n\r\n    'As he trod the shaky platform,\r\n    With the sweat upon his brow.'\r\n\r\nAbout a thousand persons were already assembled on the ground, and a\r\nmore motley gathering I never beheld. All sorts of costumes and all\r\nclasses of people were there; but the genuine back-woods corn-crackers\r\ncomposed the majority of the assemblage. As might be expected, much the\r\nlarger portion of the audience were men; still I saw some women and not\r\na few children, many of the country people having taken advantage of the\r\noccasion to give their families a holiday. Some occupied benches in\r\nfront of the stand, though a larger number were seated around in groups,\r\nwithin hearing of the speaker, but paying very little attention to what\r\nhe was saying. A few were whittling, a few pitching quoits, or playing\r\nleap-frog, and quite a number were having a quiet game of whist, euchre,\r\nor 'seven-up.'\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a well-dressed, gentlemanly-looking man, and a tolerably\r\ngood orator. He seemed accustomed to addressing a jury, for he displayed\r\nall the adroitness in handling his subject, and in appealing to the\r\nprejudices of his hearers, that we see in successful special pleaders.\r\nBut he overshot his mark. To nine out of ten of his audience, his words\r\nand similes, though correct and sometimes beautiful, were as\r\nunintelligible as the dead languages. He advocated immediate,\r\nunconditional secession; and I thought from the applause which met his\r\nremarks, whenever he seemed to make himself understood, that the large\r\nmajority of those present were of the same way of thinking.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by a heavy-browed, middle-aged man, slightly bent, and\r\nwith hair a little turned to gray, but still hale, athletic, and in the\r\nprime and vigor of manhood. His pantaloons and waistcoat were of the\r\ncommon home-spun, and he used, now and then, a word of the country\r\ndialect; but as a stump-speaker, he was infinitely superior to the more\r\npolished orator who had preceded him.\r\n\r\nHe, too, advocated secession as a right and a duty--separation, now and\r\nforever from the dirt-eating, money-loving Yankees, who, he was ashamed\r\nto say, had the same ancestry, and worshiped the same God as himself. He\r\ntook the bold ground that slavery is a curse to both the black and the\r\nwhite, but that it was forced upon this generation before it was born,\r\nby these same greedy, grasping Yankees, who would sell not only the\r\nbones and sinews of their fellowmen, but--worse than that--their own\r\nsouls, for gold. It was forced upon them without their consent, and now\r\nthat it had become interwoven with all their social life, and was a\r\nnecessity of their very existence, the hypocritical Yankees would take\r\nit from them, because, forsooth, it was a sin and a wrong--as if _they_\r\nhad to bear its responsibility, or the South could not settle its own\r\naccount with its Maker!\r\n\r\n'Slavery is now,' he continued, 'indispensable to us. Without it,\r\ncotton, rice, and sugar will cease to grow, and the South will starve.\r\nWhat if it works abuses? What if the black, at times, is overburdened,\r\nand his wife and daughters debauched? Man is not perfect any\r\nwhere--there are wrongs in every society. It is for each one to give his\r\naccount, in such matters, to his God. But in this are we worse than\r\nthey? Are there not abuses in society at the North? Are not their\r\nlaborers overworked? While sin here hides itself under cover of the\r\nnight, does it not there stalk abroad at noonday? If the wives and\r\ndaughters of blacks are debauched here, are not the wives and daughters\r\nof whites debauched there? and will not a Yankee barter away the\r\nchastity of his own mother for a dirty dollar? Who fill our brothels?\r\nYankee women! Who load our penitentiaries, crowd our whipping-posts,\r\ndebauch our slaves, and cheat and defraud us all? Yankee men! And I say\r\nunto you, fellow-citizens,' and here the speaker's form seemed to dilate\r\nwith the wild enthusiasm which possessed him, ''come out from among\r\nthem; be ye separate, and touch not the unclean thing,' and thus saith\r\nthe Lord God of hosts, who will guide you, and lead you, if need be, to\r\nbattle and to victory!'\r\n\r\nA perfect storm of applause followed. The assemblage rose, and one long\r\nwild shout rent the old woods, and made the great trees tremble. It was\r\nsome minutes before the uproar subsided; when it did, a voice near the\r\nspeaker's stand called out: 'Andy Jones!' The call was at once echoed by\r\nanother voice, and soon a general shout for 'Andy!' 'Union Andy!' 'Bully\r\nAndy!' went up from the same crowd which a moment before had so wildly\r\napplauded the secession speaker.\r\n\r\nAndy rose from where he was seated beside me, and quietly ascended the\r\nsteps of the platform. Removing his hat, and passing to his mouth a huge\r\nquid of tobacco, from a tin box in his pantaloons-pocket, he made\r\nseveral rapid strides up and down the speaker's stand, and then turned\r\nsquarely to the audience.\r\n\r\nThe reader has noticed a tiger pacing up and down in his cage, with his\r\neyes riveted on the human faces before him. He has observed how he will\r\nsingle out some individual, and finally stopping short in his rounds,\r\nturn on him with a look of such intense ferocity as makes a man's blood\r\nstand still, and his very breath come thick and hard, as he momentarily\r\nexpects the beast will tear away the bars of his cage and leap forth on\r\nthe obnoxious person. Now, Andy's fine, open, manly face had nothing of\r\nthe tiger in it, but for a moment, I could not divest myself of the\r\nimpression, as he halted in his walk up and down the stage, and turned\r\nfull and square on the previous speaker--who had taken a seat among the\r\naudience near me--that he was about to spring upon him. Riveting his eye\r\non the man's face, he at last slowly said:\r\n\r\n'A man stands har and quotes Scriptur agin his feller-man, and forgets\r\nthet 'God made of one blood all nations thet dwell on the face of the\r\n'arth.' A man stands har and calls his brother a thief, and his mother a\r\nharlot, and axes us to go his doctrines! I don't mean his brother in the\r\nScriptur' sense, nor his mother in a fig'rative sense, but I mean the\r\nbrother of his own blood, and the mother that bore him; for HE,\r\ngentlemen, (and he pointed his finger directly at the recent speaker,\r\nwhile his words came slow and heavy with intense scorn,) HE is a Yankee!\r\nAnd now, I say, gentlemen, d--n sech doctrins; d--n sech principles; and\r\nd--n the man thet's got a soul so black as to utter 'em!'\r\n\r\nA breathless silence fell on the assemblage, as the person alluded to\r\nsprang to his feet, his face on fire, and his voice thick and broken\r\nwith intense rage, and yelled out: 'Andy Jones, by ----, you shall\r\nanswer for this!'\r\n\r\n'Sartin', said Andy, coolly inserting his thumbs in the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat; 'eny whar you likes--har--now--ef 'greeable to you.'\r\n\r\n'I've no weapon here, sir, but I'll give you a chance mighty sudden,'\r\nwas the fierce reply.\r\n\r\n'Suit yourself' said Andy, with perfect imperturbability; 'but as you\r\nhan't jest ready, s'pose you set down and har me tell 'bout your\r\nrelation: they're a right decent set--them as I knows--and I'll swar\r\nthey're 'shamed of you.'\r\n\r\nA buzz went through the crowd, and a dozen voices called out, 'Be civil,\r\nAndy'--'Let him blow'--'Shet up'--'Go in, Jones'--with other like\r\nelegant exclamations.\r\n\r\nA few of his friends took the aggrieved gentleman aside, and, soon\r\nquieting him, restored order.\r\n\r\n'Wal, gentlemen,' resumed Andy, 'all on you know whar I was raised--over\r\nthar in South-Car'lina. I'm sorry to say it, but it's true. And you all\r\nknow my father was a pore man, who couldn't give his boys no chance--and\r\nef he could, thar warn't no schules in the district--so we couldn't hev\r\ngot no book-larning ef we'd been a minded to. Wal, the next plantation\r\nto whar we lived was old Cunnel J----'s, the father of this Cunnel. He\r\nwas a d--d old nullifier, jest like his son--but not half so decent a\r\nman. Wal, on his plantation was an old nigger called Uncle Pomp, who'd\r\nsumhow larned to read. He was a mighty good nigger, and he'd hev been in\r\nheaven long afore now ef the Lord hadn't a had sum good use for him down\r\nhar--but he'll be thar yet a d--d sight sooner than sum on us white\r\nfolks--that's sartin. Wal, as I was saying, Pomp could read, and when I\r\nwas 'bout sixteen, and had never seed the inside of a book, the old\r\ndarkey said to me one day--he was old then, and thet was thirty years\r\nago--wal, he said to me: 'Andy, chile, ye orter larn to read--'twould be\r\nob use to ye when you're grow'd up, and it moight make you a good and\r\n'spected man. Now, come to ole Pomp's cabin, and he'll larn you, Andy,\r\nchile.' I reckon I went. He hadn't nothin' but a Bible and Watts' Hymns;\r\nyet we used to stay thar all the long winter evenings, and by the light\r\nof the fire--we war both so durned pore we couldn't raise a candle\r\natween us--wal, by the light of the fire he larned me, and 'fore long I\r\ncould spell right smart.\r\n\r\n'Now, jest think on thet, gentlemen! I, a white boy, and, 'cordin' to\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, jest as good blood as the old Cunnel,\r\nbein' larned to read by an old slave, and that old slave a'most worked\r\nto death, and takin' his nights, when he orter hev been a restin' his\r\nold bones, to larn me! I'm d--d if he don't get to heaven for that one\r\nthing, if for nothin' else.\r\n\r\n'Wal, you all know the rest--how, when I'd grow'd up, I settled har, in\r\nthe old North State, and how the young Cunnel backed my paper and set\r\nme a runnin' at turpentinin'. P'r'aps you don't think this has much to\r\ndo with the Yankees, but it has a durned sight, as ye'll see raather\r\nsudden. Wal, arter a while, when I'd got a little 'forehanded, I begun\r\nshippin' my truck to York and Bosting; and at last my Yankee factor, he\r\ncome out har, inter the backwoods, to see me, and says he: 'Jones, come\r\nNorth and take a look at us.' I'd sort o' took to him. I'd had lots to\r\ndo with him afore ever I seed him, and I allers found him as straight as\r\na shingle. Wal, I went North, and he took me round, and showed me how\r\nthe Yankees does things. Afore I knowed him, I allers thought--as\r\np'r'aps most on ye do--that the Yankee war a sort o' cross atween the\r\ndevil and a Jew; but how do you s'pose I found 'em? I found that they\r\n_sent the pore man's children to schule_. FREE--and that the\r\nschulehouses war a d--d sight thicker than the bugs in Miles Privett's\r\nbeds! and thet's saying a heap, for ef eny on you kin sleep in his\r\nhouse, excep' he takes to the soft side of the floor, I'm d--d. Yas, the\r\npore man's children are larned thar FREE!--all on 'em--and they've jest\r\nso good a chance as the sons of the rich man! Now, arter that, do you\r\nthink that I--as got all my schulin' from an old slave, by the light of\r\na borrored pine-knot--der you think that _I_ kin say any thing agin the\r\nYankees? P'r'aps they _do_ steal--though I don't know it--p'r'aps they\r\n_do_ debauch thar wives and darters, and sell thar mothers' vartue for\r\ndollers--but ef they do, I'm d--d ef they don't send pore children ter\r\nschule--and that's more'n we do--and let me tell you, until we do, we\r\nmust count on thar bein' cuter and smarter nor we are.\r\n\r\n'This gentleman, too, my friends, who's been a givin' sech a hard\r\nsettin' down ter his own relation, arter they've broughten him up and\r\ngivin' him sech a good schulein' for nothin', he says the Yankees want\r\nto interfere with our niggers. Now, thet han't so, and they couldn't ef\r\nthey would, 'cause it's agin the Constitution--and they stand on the\r\nConstitution a durned sight solider nor we do. Didn't thar big\r\ngun--Daniel Webster--didn't he make mince-meat o' South-Carolina Hayne\r\non that ar subject? But I tell you they han't a mind to meddle with our\r\nniggers; they're a goin' ter let us go ter h--l our own way--and we're\r\ngoin' thar mighty fast, or I hevn't read the last census.'\r\n\r\n'P'r'aps you han't heerd on th' Ab'lisheners, Andy?' cried a voice from\r\namong the audience.\r\n\r\n'Wal, I reckon I hev,' responded the orator. 'I've heerd on 'em, and\r\nseed 'em, too. When I was North I went ter one on thar conventions, and\r\nI'll tell you how they look. They've all long, wimmin's hair, and thin,\r\nshet lips, with big, bawlin' mouths, and long, lean, tommerhawk\r\nfaces--'bout as white as vargin dip--and they all talk through the nose,\r\n[giving a specimen,] and they look for all the world jest like the\r\nSouth-Car'lina fire-eaters--and they _are_ as near like 'em as two peas,\r\nexcep' they don't swar quite so bad, but they make up for that in\r\nprayin'--and prayin' too much, I reckon, when a man's a d--d hippercrit,\r\nis 'bout as bad as swearin'. But I tell you, the decent folks up North\r\nhan't ab'lisheners. They look on 'em jest as we do on mad dogs, the\r\nitch, or the nigger-traders.\r\n\r\n'Now, 'bout this secession bis'ness--though tan't no use ter talk on\r\nthet, 'cause this State never'll secede--South-Car'lina has done it, and\r\nI'm raather glad she has, for though I was born thar, I say she orter\r\nhev gone to h--l long ago, and now she's got thar--_let her stay!_ But,\r\n'bout thet bis'ness, I'll tell you a story.\r\n\r\n'I know'd an old gentleman once by the name o' Uncle Sam, and he'd a\r\nheap o' sons. They war all likely boys--and strange ter tell, though\r\nthey'd all the same mother, and she a white woman, 'bout half on 'em war\r\ncolored--not black, but sorter half-and-half. Now, the white sons war\r\nwell-behaved, industrious, hard-workin' boys, who got 'long well,\r\nedicated that children, and allers treated the old man decently; but the\r\nmulatter fellers war a pesky set--though some on 'em war better nor\r\nothers. They wouldn't work, but set up for airystocrocy--rode in\r\nkerriges, kept fast hosses, bet high, and chawed tobaccer like the\r\ndevil. Wal, the result was, _they_ got out at the elbows, and 'cause\r\nthey warn't gettin' 'long quite so fast as the white 'uns--though that\r\nwar all thar own fault--they got jealous, and one, on 'em, who was\r\nblacker nor all the rest--a little feller, but terrible big on\r\nbraggin'--he packed up his truck one night, and left the old man's\r\nhouse, and swore he'd never come back. He tried ter make the other\r\nmulatters go 'long too, but they put thar fingers ter thar nose, and\r\nsays they: 'No you don't!' _I_ was in favor o' lettin' on him stay out\r\nin the cold, but the old man was a bernevolent old critter--so _he_\r\nsays: 'Now, sonny, you jest come back and behave yourself, and I'll\r\nforgive you all on your old pranks, and treat you jest as I allers used\r\nter; but, ef you won't, why, I'll make you--that's all!'\r\n\r\n'Now, gentlemen, that querrelsome, oneasy, ongrateful, tobaccer-chawin',\r\nhigh-bettin', hoss-racin', big-braggin', nigger-stealin',\r\nwimmin-whippin', yaller son of the devil, is South-Car'lina; and ef she\r\ndon't come back and behave herself in futur', I'm d--d ef she won't be\r\nploughed with fire, and sowed with salt, and--Andy Jones will help ter\r\ndo it.'\r\n\r\nThe speaker was frequently interrupted in the course of his remarks by\r\nuproarious applause--but as he closed and descended from the platform,\r\nthe crowd sent up cheer after cheer, and a dozen strong men, making a\r\nseat of their arms, lifted him from the ground, and bore him to the head\r\nof the table, where dinner was in waiting.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the large assemblage then fell to eating. The dinner was\r\nmade up of the barbecued beef and the usual mixture of viands found on a\r\nplanter's table, with water from the little brook hard by, and a\r\nplentiful supply of corn-whisky. (The latter beverage, I thought, had\r\nbeen subjected to the rite of immersion, for it tasted wonderfully like\r\nwater.)\r\n\r\nSongs and speeches were intermingled with the masticating exercises, and\r\nthe whole company were soon in the best of humor.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal I was introduced by Andy to a large number of the\r\n'natives,' he taking special pains to tell each one that I was a Yankee,\r\nand a Union man, but always adding, as if to conciliate all parties,\r\nthat I was also a guest and a friend of _his_ very particular friend,\r\n'that d--d seceshener, Cunnel J----.'\r\n\r\nBefore we left the table, the secession orator happening near, Andy rose\r\nfrom his seat, and extended his hand to him, saying:\r\n\r\n'Tom, you think I 'sulted you--p'r'aps I did--but you 'sulted my Yankee\r\nfriend har, and your own relation, and I hed to take it up, jest for the\r\nlooks o' the thing. Come, thar's my hand; I'll fight you ef you want\r\nter, or we'll say no more 'bout it--jest as you like.'\r\n\r\n'Say no more about it, Andy,' said the gentleman, very cordially; 'let's\r\ndrink and be friends.'\r\n\r\nThey drank a glass of whisky together, and then leaving the table,\r\nproceeded to where the ox had been barbecued, to show me how cooking on\r\na large scale is done at the South.\r\n\r\nIn a pit about eight feet deep, twenty feet long, and ten feet wide,\r\nlaid up on the side with stones, a fire of hickory had been made, over\r\nwhich, after the wood had burned down to coals, a whole ox, divested of\r\nits hide and entrails, had been suspended on an enormous spit. Being\r\nturned often in the process of cooking, the beef had finally been 'done\r\nbrown.' It was then cut up and served on the table, and I must say, for\r\nthe credit of Southern cookery, that it made as delicious eating as any\r\nmeat I ever tasted.\r\n\r\nI had then been away from my charge--the Colonel's horses--as long as\r\nseemed to be prudent. I said as much to Andy, when he proposed to\r\nreturn with me, and turning good-humoredly to his reconciled friend, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Now, Tom, no secession talk while I'm off.'\r\n\r\n'Nary a word,' said Tom, and we left.\r\n\r\nThe horses had been well fed by the negro who had them in charge, but\r\nhad not been groomed. Andy, seeing that, stripped off his coat, and,\r\nsetting the black at work on one, with a handful of straw and\r\npine-leaves commenced operations on the other, and the horse's coat was\r\nsoon as smooth and glossy as if recently rubbed by an English groom.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day passed without incident till eleven at night,\r\nwhen the Colonel returned from Wilmington.\r\n\r\nMoye had not been seen or heard of, and the Colonel's trip was\r\nfruitless. While at Wilmington, he sent telegrams, directing the\r\noverseer's arrest, to the various large cities of the South, and then\r\ndecided to return, make some arrangements preliminary to a protracted\r\nabsence from the plantation, and proceed at once to Charleston, where he\r\nwould await replies to his dispatches. Andy agreed with him in the\r\nopinion that Moye, in his weak state of health, would not undertake an\r\noverland journey to the free States, but would endeavor to reach some\r\ntown on the Mississippi, where he could dispose of the horse, and secure\r\na passage up the river.\r\n\r\nAs no time was to be lost, it was decided that we should return to the\r\nplantation on the following morning. Accordingly, with the first streak\r\nof day, we bade 'good-by' to our Union friend, and started homeward.\r\n\r\nNo incident worthy of mention occurred on the way, till about ten\r\no'clock, when we arrived at the home of the Yankee schoolmistress, where\r\nwe had been so hospitably entertained two days before. The lady received\r\nus with great cordiality, forced upon us a lunch to serve our hunger on\r\nthe road, and when we parted, enjoined on me to leave the South at the\r\nearliest possible moment. She was satisfied it would not for a much\r\nlonger time be safe quarters for a man professing Union sentiments.\r\nNotwithstanding the strong manifestations of loyalty I had observed\r\namong the people, I was convinced that the advice of my pretty\r\n'countrywoman' was judicious, and I determined to be governed by it.\r\n\r\nOur horses, unaccustomed to lengthy journeys, had not entirely recovered\r\nfrom the fatigues of their previous travel, and we did not reach our\r\ndestination till an hour after dark. We were most cordially welcomed by\r\nMadam P----, who soon set before us a hot supper, which, as we were\r\njaded by the long ride, and had fasted for twelve hours on bacon\r\nsandwiches and cold hoe-cake, was the one thing needful for us.\r\n\r\nWhile seated at the table, the Colonel asked:\r\n\r\n'Has every thing gone right, Alice, since we left home?'\r\n\r\n'Every thing,' replied the lady, 'except,' and she hesitated as if she\r\ndreaded the effect of the news; 'except--that Juley and her child have\r\ngone.'\r\n\r\n'Gone!' exclaimed my host, 'gone where?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. We have searched every where, but have found no clue to\r\nthem. The morning you left, Sam set Juley at work among the pines; she\r\ntried hard, but could not do a full task, and at night was taken to the\r\ncabin to be whipped. I heard of it, and forbade Sam's doing it. It did\r\nnot seem to me to be right to punish her for not doing what she had not\r\nstrength to do. When she was released from the cabin, she came to thank\r\nme for having interfered for her, and talked with me awhile. She cried\r\nand took on fearfully about Sam, and was afraid you would punish her on\r\nyour return. I promised you would not, and when she left me, she seemed\r\nmore cheerful. I supposed she would go directly home, after getting her\r\nchild from the nurse's quarters; but it appears she then went to\r\nPompey's, where she staid till after ten o'clock. Neither she nor the\r\nchild have since been seen.'\r\n\r\n'Did you get no trace of her in the morning?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but soon lost it. When she did not appear at work, Sam went to her\r\ncabin to learn the cause, and found the door open, and her bed\r\nundisturbed. She had not slept there. Knowing that Sandy had returned, I\r\nsent for him, and with Jim and his dog, he commenced a search. The hound\r\ntracked her directly from Pompey's cabin to the run near the lower\r\nstill. There all trace of her disappeared. We dragged the stream, but\r\ndiscovered nothing. Jim and Sandy then scoured the woods for miles in\r\nall directions, but the hound could not recover the trail. I hope\r\notherwise, but I fear some evil has befallen her.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, there's no fear of that,' said the Colonel; 'she is smart--she\r\nwaded up the run far enough to baffle the dog, and then made for the\r\nswamp. That is why you lost her tracks at the stream. Rely upon it, I am\r\nright; but she shall not escape me.'\r\n\r\nWe shortly afterward adjourned to the library. After being seated there\r\na while, the Colonel, rising quickly, as if a sudden thought had struck\r\nhim, sent for the old preacher.\r\n\r\nThe old negro soon appeared, hat in hand, and taking a stand near the\r\ndoor, made a respectful bow to each one of us.\r\n\r\n'Take a chair, Pompey,' said Madam P---- kindly.\r\n\r\nThe black meekly seated himself, when the Colonel asked: 'Well, Pomp,\r\nwhat do you know about Jule's going off?'\r\n\r\n'Nuffin', massa; I 'shures you, nuffin'. De pore chile say nuffin' to\r\nole Pomp 'bout dat.'\r\n\r\n'What did she say?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, you see, massa, de night arter you gwo 'way, and arter she'd\r\nworked hard in de brush all de day, and been a strung up in de ole cabin\r\nfor to be whipped, she come to me wid her baby in her arms, all a-faint\r\nand a-tired, and her pore heart clean broke, and she say dat she'm jess\r\nready to drop down and die. Den I tries to comfut her, massa; I takes\r\nher up from de floor, and I say to har dat de good Lord he pity her--dat\r\nhe doan't bruise de broken reed, and woan't put no more on har dan she\r\nkin b'ar--dat he'd touch you' heart, massa--and I toled har you's a\r\ngood, kine heart at de bottom--and I knows it, 'case I toted you 'fore\r\nyou could gwo, and when you's a bery little chile, not no great sight\r\nbigger'n her'n, you'd put your little arms round ole Pomp's neck, and\r\nsay dat when you war grow'd up, you'd be bery kine to de pore brack\r\nfolks, and not leff 'em be 'bused like dey war in dem days.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind what _you_ said,' interrupted the Colonel, a little\r\nimpatiently, but showing no displeasure; 'what did _she_ say?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, massa, she took on bery hard 'bout Sam, and axed me ef I raily\r\nreckoned de Lord had forgib'n him, and took'n him to heseff, and gib'n\r\nhim one of dem hous'n up dar in de sky. I toled har dat I _know'd_ it;\r\nbut she say it didn't 'pear so to har, 'case Sam had a been wid har out\r\ndar in de woods, all fru de day; dat she'd a _seed_ him, massa, and\r\ndough he hadn't a said nuffin', he'd looked at har wid sech a sorry,\r\ngrebed look, dat it went clean fru har heart, till she'd no strength\r\nleff, and fell down on de ground a'most dead. Den she say big Sam come\r\n'long and fine har dar, and struck har great, heaby blows wid de big\r\nwhip!'\r\n\r\n'The brute!' exclaimed the Colonel, rising from his chair, and pacing\r\nrapidly up and down the room.\r\n\r\n'But p'raps he warn't so much ter blame, massa,' continued the old\r\nnegro, in a deprecatory tone; 'may be he s'pose she war shirking de\r\nwork. Wal, den she say, she know'd nuffin' more, till byme-by, when she\r\ncome to, and fine big Sam dar, and he struck har agin, and make her gwo\r\nto de work; and she did gwo, but she feel like as ef she'd die. I toled\r\nher de good ma'am wudn't leff big Sam 'buse har no more 'fore you cum\r\nhum, and dat you'd hab 'passion on har, and not leff har out in de\r\nwoods, but put har 'mong de nusses, like as she war afore.\r\n\r\n'Den she say it 'twarn't de work dat trubble har--dat she orter work,\r\nand orter be 'bused, 'case she'd been bad, bery bad. All she axed was\r\ndat Sam would forgib har, and cum to har in de oder worle, and tell har\r\nso. Den she cried, and took on awful; but de good Lord, massa, dat am so\r\nbery kine to de bery wuss sinners, he put de words inter my mouf, and I\r\ntink dey gabe har comfut, fur she say it sort o' 'peared to har den dat\r\nSam _would_ forgib har, and take har inter his house up dar, and she\r\nwarn't afeard ter die no more.\r\n\r\n'Den she takes up de chile and gwoes 'way, 'pearin' sort o' happy, and\r\nmore cheerful like dan I'd a seed har eber sense pore Sam war shot.'\r\n\r\nMy host was sensibly affected by the old man's simple tale, but\r\ncontinued pacing up and down the room, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n'It's plain to me, Colonel,' I remarked, as Pompey concluded, 'she has\r\ndrowned herself and the child--the dog lost the scent at the creek.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no,' he replied, 'I think not. I never heard of a negro committing\r\nsuicide--they've not the courage to do it.'\r\n\r\n'I fear she _has_, David,' said the lady. 'The thought of going to Sam\r\nhas led her to it; yet we dragged the run, and found nothing. What do\r\nyou think about it, Pompey?'\r\n\r\n'I dunno, ma'am; but I'se afeard ob dat. And now dat I tinks on it, I'se\r\nafeard dat what I tole har put har up to it,' replied the old preacher,\r\nbursting into tears. 'She 'peared so happy like, when I say she'd be\r\n'long wid Sam in de oder worle, dat I'se afeard she's a gone and done it\r\nwid har own hands. I tole har, too, dat de good Lord oberlooked many\r\ntings dat pore sinners does when dey can't help 'emseffs, and it make\r\nhar do it, oh! it make har do it!' and the old black buried his face in\r\nhis hands, and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n'Don't feel so, Pomp,' said his master _very_ kindly. 'You did the best\r\nyou could; no one blames you.'\r\n\r\n'I knows _you_ doan't, massa--I knows you doan't, and you's bery good\r\nnotter; but oh!' and his body swayed to and fro with the great grief; 'I\r\nfears de Lord do, massa, for I'se sent har to him wid har own blood and\r\nde blood of dat pore, innercent chile on har hands. Oh! I fears de Lord\r\nneber'll forgib me--neber'll forgib me fur _dat_.'\r\n\r\n'He will, my good Pomp, he will!' said the Colonel, laying his hand\r\ntenderly on the old man's shoulder. 'The Lord will forgive you, for the\r\nsake of the Christian example you've set your master, if for nothing\r\nelse;' and then the proud, strong man's feelings overpowering him, his\r\ntears fell in great drops on the breast of the old slave, as they had\r\nfallen there when he was a child.\r\n\r\nSuch scenes are not for the eye of a stranger, and turning away, I left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe family met at the breakfast-table at the customary hour on the\r\nfollowing morning; but I noticed that Jim was not in his accustomed\r\nplace behind the Colonel's chair. That gentleman exhibited his usual\r\ngood spirits, but Madam P---- looked sad and anxious, and I had not\r\nforgotten the scene of the previous evening.\r\n\r\nWhile we were seated at the meal, the negro Junius hastily entered the\r\nroom, and in an excited manner exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'O massa, massa! you muss cum ter de cabin--Jim hab draw'd his knife,\r\nand he swar he'll kill de fuss un dat touch him!'\r\n\r\n'He does, does he!' said his master, springing from his seat, and\r\nabruptly leaving the apartment.\r\n\r\nRemembering the fierce burst of passion I had seen in the negro, and\r\nfearing there was danger a-foot, I rose to follow, saying as I did so:\r\n\r\n'Madam, can not you prevent this?'\r\n\r\n'I can not, sir; I have already done all I can. Go and try to pacify the\r\nColonel. Jim will die before he'll be whipped.'\r\n\r\nJim was standing at the farther end of the old cabin, with his back to\r\nthe wall, and the large spring-knife in his hand. Some half-dozen\r\nnegroes were in the centre of the room, apparently cowed by his fierce\r\nand desperate looks, and his master stood within a few feet of him.\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Cunnel,' cried the negro, as I entered, 'you touch me at\r\nyour peril.'\r\n\r\n'You d--d nigger, do you dare to speak so to me?' said his master,\r\ntaking a step toward him.\r\n\r\nThe knife rose in the air, and the black, in a cool, sneering tone,\r\nreplied: 'Say your prayers 'fore you come ony nigher, for, so help me\r\nGod, you're a dead man!'\r\n\r\nI laid my hand on the Colonel's arm, to draw him back, saying as I did\r\nso: 'There's danger in him! I _know_ it Let him go, and he shall ask\r\nyour pardon.'\r\n\r\n'I shan't ax his pardon,' cried the black, 'leff him and me be, sar;\r\nwe'll fix dis ourselfs.'\r\n\r\n'Don't interfere, Mr. K----,' said my host, with perfect coolness, but\r\nwith a face pallid with rage. 'Let me govern my own plantation.'\r\n\r\n'As you say, sir,' I replied, stepping back a few paces; 'but I warn\r\nyou--there is danger in him!'\r\n\r\nTaking no notice of my remark, the Colonel turned to the trembling\r\nnegroes, and said: 'One of you go to the house and bring my pistols.'\r\n\r\n'You kin shoot me, ef you likes,' said Jim, with a fierce, grim smile;\r\n'but I'll take you to h--l wid me, _shore_. You knows WE won't stand a\r\nblow!'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, at the allusion to their relationship, started as if shot,\r\nand turning furiously on the negro, yelled out: 'I'll shoot you for\r\nthat, you d--d nigger, by----.'\r\n\r\n'It 'pears ter me, Cunnel, ye've hed 'bout nuff shootin' 'round har,\r\nlately; better stop thet sort o' bis'ness; it moight give ye a sore\r\nthroat,' said the long, lean, loose-jointed stump-speaker of the\r\nprevious Sunday, as he entered the cabin and strode directly up to my\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n'What brought you here, you d--d insolent hound?' cried the Colonel,\r\nturning fiercely on the new-comer.\r\n\r\n'Wal, I cum to du ye a naboorly turn--I've kotched two on yer niggers\r\ndown ter my still, an' I want ye ter take 'em 'way,' returned the\r\ncorn-cracker, with the utmost coolness.\r\n\r\n'Two of my niggers!' exclaimed the Colonel, perceptibly moderating his\r\ntone, 'which ones?'\r\n\r\n'A yaller gal, and a child.'\r\n\r\n'I thank you, Barnes; excuse my hard words--I was excited.'\r\n\r\n'All right, Cunnel; say no more 'bout thet. Will ye send fur 'em? I'd\r\nhev fotched 'em 'long, but my waggin's off jest now.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I'll send at once. Have you got them safe?'\r\n\r\n'Safe? I reckon so! Kotched 'em las' night, arter dark, and they've kept\r\nright still ever sense, I 'sure ye--but th' gal holes on ter th' young\r\n'un ter kill--we couldn't get it 'way no how.'\r\n\r\n'How did you catch them?'\r\n\r\n'The' got 'gainst my turpentime raft--th' current driv 'em down, I\r\ns'pose.'\r\n\r\n'What! are they dead?' exclaimed the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Dead? Deader'n drownded rats!' was the native's reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--_Goethe_.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary._\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     The people are anxious for the _detail_ of sentiments, not for\r\n     general results.'--_Lamartine._\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram exhibited almost from his boyhood a fondness for female society.\r\nEven when at the district-school, he preferred spending 'noon-time'\r\namong the girls to racing around with the boys, pitching quoits,\r\nwrestling at 'arm's-end,' 'back-hold,' or playing base-ball and goal.\r\nHis mother was careful to encourage Hiram's predilections. She remarked\r\nthat nothing was so well calculated to keep a young man from going\r\nastray as for him to frequent the society of virtuous females.\r\n\r\nBefore Hiram had got into his teens, he appeared to be smitten with at\r\nleast half a score of little girls of his own age. As he grew older, his\r\nfondness for the sex increased. I do not record this, as any thing\r\nextraordinary, except that in his case a characteristic selfishness\r\nseemed to be at the bottom even of these manifestations. Hiram was not\r\ninfluenced by those natural emotions and impulses which belong to youth,\r\nand which, unless kept under proper restraint, are apt frequently to\r\nlead to indiscretions. For there ran a vein of calculation through all\r\nhe did, whose prudent office it was to minister to his safety.\r\n\r\nAfter Hiram joined the church he was regular in his attendance on the\r\nevening meetings. He always went to these meetings with some young girl,\r\nwhom, of course, he accompanied home after the services were over. As I\r\nhave said, he was a handsome fellow, and bestowed particular care on his\r\ndress and his appearance generally. He was good-natured and obliging,\r\nand withal sensible, so that the young men who envied him and might be\r\ninclined to call him a fop or a dandy, could not prefix 'brainless' to\r\nthese epithets and thus ridicule on him. The fact is, he was shrewder\r\nthan any of them, and he knew it. They soon discovered it, and so did\r\nthe girls, to the utter discomfiture of his rivals.\r\n\r\nAt all the village gatherings, including the sewing-societies, and the\r\nlectures, the prayer-meetings, and meetings of Sunday-school teachers,\r\nand so forth, Hiram was not only a favorite, but _the_ favorite with the\r\nother sex. He had a winning, confidential manner, when addressing a\r\nyoung lady even for the first time, which said very plainly, 'We know\r\nall about and appreciate each other,' and which was very taking. He\r\nassumed various little privileges, such as calling the girls by their\r\nfirst name, giving notice that a curl was about to fall, and offering to\r\nfix it properly, picking up a bow which had been brushed off, and\r\npinning it securely on again, holding the hand with a kind and amiable\r\nsmile for a brief space after he had shaken it, and sometimes, when he\r\nhad occasion to see one of his friends home, keeping her hand in his all\r\nthe way after it was placed within his arm.\r\n\r\nYou may ask why such liberties were permitted. Simply because they were\r\nso very equally distributed they had come to be regarded as a matter of\r\ncourse. In fact, Hiram was a privileged person. He was so polite, so\r\nattentive, so considerate, what if he did have his peculiarities--how\r\nridiculous to make a fuss about such trifles! So the 'trifles' were\r\nacquiesced in. Besides, I am inclined to think each fair one supposed\r\nshe was the especial object of Hiram's regard, and that his attentions\r\nto others were mere civilities. I do not say Hiram so announced it. I\r\nknow he did not; for he was not a person, even when a youth, to commit\r\nhimself foolishly. Yet if they _would_ mistake general politeness for\r\nparticular attentions, surely it was not his fault--oh! no.\r\n\r\nThere were those who refused to give their adherence to Hiram's almost\r\nunlimited sway. And as parties generally proceed to extremes, the girls\r\nwho formed the opposition generally declared him to be a pusillanimous,\r\nmean-spirited fellow; they detested the very sight of his smooth,\r\nhypocritical face; he had better not come fooling around them--no,\r\nindeed! Let him attempt it once, they would soon teach him manners. It\r\nis to be observed that these remarks did not emanate from the prettiest\r\nor most attractive girls of the village--all of whom were decidedly and\r\nemphatically on Hiram's side. They seemed to enjoy the excitement under\r\nwhich their adversaries were laboring, and retorted by exclaiming, 'Sour\r\ngrapes!' asserting that those who so shamefully vilified Hiram, would be\r\nglad enough to accept his attentions if--they only had the opportunity.\r\n\r\nHiram, meantime, pursued the even tenor of his way, secure in his\r\nposition, enjoying to the full extent of his selfish nature all his\r\n'blessings and privileges,' for which he thanked God twice daily,\r\nwondering how men could be so blind and misguided as to turn their backs\r\non religion when there was such happiness and peace in giving up all to\r\nGod!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett was correct in his surmise that there were two stores in the\r\nlittle village of Hampton. Of one of these Thaddeus Smith was\r\nproprietor. He was one of the solid men of the place, and had 'kept\r\nstore' there for the last forty years, succeeding his father, who was\r\none of the early settlers in the town. He had continued on with his\r\ncustomers in the good old fashion, extending liberal credits and\r\ncharging a regular, undeviating profit of thirty-three and a third per\r\ncent. About five years previous to Hiram Meeker's leaving school, Mr.\r\nSmith's peace was greatly disturbed by the advent of a rival, in the\r\nperson of Benjamin Jessup, who took possession of an advantageous\r\nlocality, and after a week's bustle with teams and workmen transporting,\r\nunpacking, and arranging, displayed his name, one fine morning, in large\r\ngilt letters to the wondering inhabitants of Hampton, and under it the\r\ncabalistic words: 'CHEAP CASH STORE.' A large number of handbills were\r\nposted about the village, informing the good people of the opening of\r\nthe aforesaid 'cash store,' and that the proprietor was prepared to sell\r\nevery variety of goods and merchandise 'cheap for cash or ready pay,' by\r\nwhich last expression was meant acceptable barter. Of course, the whole\r\ntown flocked to inspect Mr. Jessup's stock and price his goods. The\r\ncunning fellow had valued them only at about cost, while he declared he\r\nwas making a living profit at the rates charged, and a living profit was\r\nall he wanted. Furthermore, he allowed the highest prices for the\r\ncommodities brought in by the farmers, and gave them great bargains in\r\nreturn. He was especially accommodating to the ladies, permitting them\r\nto tumble his whole stock of dry goods for the sake of selecting a\r\npretty pattern for an apron, or finding a remnant which they were\r\n'welcome to.'\r\n\r\nMr. Smith was sadly grieved. Although some very old-fashioned people\r\nstuck sternly to him, refusing to be allured by the bait of great\r\nbargains, and so forth and so forth, yet his store was nearly deserted.\r\nThaddeus Smith was a perfectly upright man. It is true, he charged a\r\nlarge profit on his goods--this was because it had always been his\r\nhabit, and that of his father before him. But he was accommodating in\r\nhis credit and lenient to debtors in default. His word could be relied\r\non implicitly, and his dealings were marked by scrupulous honesty.\r\n\r\nOn this trying occasion he called his son, who was supposed to be his\r\npartner, into consultation, and asked him what he thought of the state\r\nof things.\r\n\r\n'I think this, father,' was the reply, 'that we can not expect to go on\r\nlonger in the old style. We must reduce our profits one half, and to do\r\nthis, we must be more particular in our credits, and buy with more care\r\nand of different people. In this way I will engage--by pursuing a\r\nstraightforward, energetic course, we shall hold our own against the\r\ncash-man over the way.'\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Mr. Smith, Senior, could be persuaded. It was\r\nnot just the thing, taking advice from a 'boy,' although the boy was\r\npast thirty, and had a family of his own. He yielded, however, and\r\nThaddeus, Junior, was permitted to carry out his plan. He made a trip to\r\nNew-York and purchased goods, instead of sending an order for them as\r\nhad been their habit, where he could find the best bargains at least ten\r\nper cent cheaper than his father was in the habit of buying, came home,\r\ngot out handbills in his turn, requesting the people to call at the 'old\r\nstand,' look at the fresh stock, selected personally with great care,\r\nand bought cheap _for_ cash, but which would be sold as usual on\r\napproved credit. This gave the tide a turn in the old direction, and Mr.\r\nJessup had to set to work anew. He was not a bad man in his way, but\r\nneither was he a good one. He was not over-scrupulous nor severely\r\nhonest. His prices varied, so the folks discovered, and he, or rather\r\nhis clerks, sometimes made mistakes in the quality of articles sold.\r\nAfter a while the cash system sensibly relaxed, and at last both\r\nestablishments settled down into a severe and uncompromising opposition.\r\nThere was a pretty large back country which received its supplies from\r\nHampton, and so both stores managed to do a thriving trade. The Smiths\r\nretaining as customers the large portion of the staid and respectable\r\npopulation, while Mr. Jessup's business depended more on his dealings\r\nwith the people from the surrounding country. There was a very different\r\natmosphere around the stores of these two village merchants. The Smiths\r\nwere religious people, father and son, not merely so in name, but in\r\nreality. A child could have purchased half their stock on as favorable\r\nterms as the shrewdest man in the place. Mr. Jessup, on the contrary,\r\nvaried as he could light of chaps, that is, according to circumstances.\r\nHe was, however, an off-hand, free-and-easy fellow, with many generous\r\nqualities, which made him popular with most who knew him. He did not\r\nhesitate to declare that his views on religious subjects were liberal--a\r\nbold announcement for a man to make in Hampton. Indeed, his enemies put\r\nhim down for a Universalist, or at best a Unitarian, for which they\r\nclaimed to have some reason, since he seldom went to church, although\r\nhis wife was a communicant, and very regular in her attendance.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in describing the two rival establishments\r\nbecause Hiram Meeker is to enter one of them. The reader will naturally\r\nsuppose there can be little doubt which, and he has a right to exhibit\r\nsurprise on learning that Hiram decided in favor of Mr. Jessup. I say\r\nHIRAM decided. His father preferred that he should go with the Smiths.\r\nHis mother was of the same opinion, but she permitted her son, who now\r\nwas very capable of acting for himself, to persuade her that Jessup's\r\nwas the place for him: 'More going on--greater variety of business--much\r\nmore enterprise,' and consequently more to be learned. It would be\r\ndifficult to follow closely the train of reasoning which led Hiram to\r\ninsist so perseveringly in favor of Mr. Jessup. For the reasons he gave\r\nwere on the surface, while those which really decided him were keen and\r\nsubtle, based on a shrewd appreciation of the position of the two\r\nmerchants, and his probable relation to one or the other. With the\r\nSmiths, Hiram saw no room for any fresh exhibition of talent or\r\nenterprise; in the other place he saw a great deal.\r\n\r\nOnce decided on, he was speedily settled in his new abode, where he\r\nformed a part of the household of the proprietor, together with the\r\nhead-clerk, a 'cute fellow of five and twenty, who was reported to be as\r\n'keen as a razor.' It was evident Mr. Jessup valued him highly, from the\r\nrespect he always paid to his advice and from his giving up so much of\r\nthe management of the business to him. Besides, it was rumored he was\r\nengaged to Mr. Jessup's oldest daughter, a handsome, black-eyed girl of\r\neighteen, a little too old for the 'meridian' of Hiram; but who, with\r\nher mother, was on excellent terms with the Meeker family. The name of\r\nthe head-clerk was Pease--Jonathan Pease; but he always wrote his name\r\nJ. Pease. There was also a boy, fourteen years old, called Charley, who\r\nboarded at home. This, with Mr. Benjamin Jessup, constituted the force\r\nat the 'cash store.'\r\n\r\nHiram had taken the place of a pale, milk-and-water-looking youth, with\r\nweak lungs, who had been obliged to quit on account of poor health. This\r\nyouth had been entirely under the control of Pease, so much so that he\r\ndared not venture an opinion about his own soul or body till he was\r\nsatisfied Pease thought just so. All this helped add to the importance\r\nof the head-clerk, so that even Mr. Jessup unconsciously felt rather\r\nnervous about differing with him. Indeed, Pease was fast becoming master\r\nof the establishment. This Hiram Meeker knew perfectly well before he\r\nentered it.\r\n\r\nWhen Pease ascertained that Hiram was about to come there as clerk,\r\nwithout his advice being asked, he regarded it as an invasion of his\r\nrights. He did not hesitate to speak his mind on the subject to Mr.\r\nJessup. He tried strongly to dissuade him from taking a gentleman-clerk,\r\nand declared it would require an extra boy to wait on him and another to\r\ncorrect his blunders. It was of no use; Mr. Jessup had not the slightest\r\nidea of the peculiar qualities of Hiram, but he knew if he received him,\r\nit would be the means of making an inroad into the conservative quarter,\r\nand he should secure the trade and influence of the Meekers beside. He\r\nwent so far as to explain this to Pease, in the most confidential and\r\nfriendly manner; but the latter was not to be persuaded or mollified. As\r\nhe could not prevent the advent of Hiram, he resolved to make his\r\nposition just as uncomfortable as he possibly could. But he little knew\r\nthe stuff he had to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe first morning after he had taken possession of his new quarters--his\r\nsleeping-room was over the store--Hiram rose early, and was looking\r\ncarefully about the place, when Pease came in and asked him why he did\r\nnot sweep out.\r\n\r\n'I have not yet learned the regulations, Mr. Pease, but am ready to\r\nbegin any time,' was Hiram's quiet reply.\r\n\r\nNow, Pease had purposely sent Charley away on an early errand, so as to\r\nbe able to put this work on the new-comer. He simply replied, in an\r\narrogant tone, that it was his business every morning to sweep out the\r\nstore, and then sand the floors, adding, in order to preserve a\r\nsemblance of truth: 'When the boy happens to be here, he will help you.'\r\n\r\nPease was a little astonished to see how readily Hiram set to work. The\r\nstore was not only carefully swept, and the floors sanded, but many\r\narticles which were scattered about were put in their place, and\r\ncarefully arranged, so that after breakfast, when Mr. Jessup came in, he\r\nremarked on the neat appearance of the store, without knowing to what it\r\nwas owing. Thus was the first attempt of J. Pease to annoy Hiram\r\ncompletely foiled. Furthermore, Hiram kept on sweeping and sanding,\r\nalthough Charley was present; indeed, he declined his assistance\r\naltogether, and once, when Mr. Jessup remarked (he had observed to whom\r\nthe change in the appearance of the store was due) that it was quite\r\nunnecessary for him to do the boy's work, Hiram quietly answered, that\r\nhe much preferred to do it to seeing the store look as it did when he\r\nfirst came there.\r\n\r\nIt took our hero but a short time to familiarize himself with the\r\nminutiæ of Mr. Jessup's business. It was not long before Pease began to\r\nfeel that there was a person every way his superior who was fast\r\nacquiring a more thorough insight into affairs than he had himself. He\r\nbegan to fear that certain private transactions of his own would not\r\nescape Hiram's observation. He felt magnetically that instead of\r\nbullying and domineering over the new-comer, Hiram's eyes were on _him_\r\nwhatever he did. This was insupportable; but how could he help it? The\r\nmore work he imposed on Hiram, the better the latter seemed to like it,\r\nand the more he accomplished.\r\n\r\n'Damn him!' said Pease between his teeth; but cursing did not help the\r\nmatter, so Pease discovered.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, several young ladies who were not in the habit of calling at\r\nJessup's began to drop in to look at the dry-goods. It was in vain Pease\r\nstepped briskly forward to wait on them, with his most fascinating\r\nsmile; they wanted to see Mr. Meeker. Pease was bursting with rage, but\r\nhe was forced to restrain his passion. On one occasion, on seeing two\r\nattractive-looking girls approaching, he sent Hiram to the cellar to\r\ndraw a gallon of molasses, and as the weather was cold, he calculated he\r\nwould have to wait at least a quarter of an hour for it to run. When the\r\nyoung ladies entered, they inquired for Hiram; Pease reported Mr. Meeker\r\nas particularly engaged, and offered his services in the most pathetic\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n'Oh! we are in no hurry,' was the reply, 'we can wait.'\r\n\r\nAnd they did wait, greatly to Pease's disgust, and to Mr. Jessup's\r\ndelight, who happened to come in at that moment, for he knew Hiram would\r\nbe sure to make some handsome sales to them. At length came poor Pease's\r\ncrowning misfortune. Mary Jessup began to give token that she was not\r\nslow to discover Hiram's agreeable qualities, and his superiority in\r\nevery respect over his rival. Now, if there is any one thing which the\r\nsex admire in a man more than another, it is real ability. Mary Jessup\r\nwas a quick-witted girl herself, and she could not fail to perceive this\r\nquality in Hiram. She had heretofore regarded him as a boy; but the boy\r\nhad grown up almost without her observing it, and now stood, with his\r\nfull stature of medium hight, admirably proportioned. It was not long\r\nbefore she consented to accompany Hiram to the Thursday-evening lecture.\r\nWhat a pleasant walk they had each way, and how gracefully he placed her\r\nshawl across her shoulders. Pease was furious. 'How absurd you act,'\r\nthat was all Mary Jessup said in reply to his violent demonstrations,\r\nand she laughed when she said it. What _could_ Pease do for revenge? He\r\nthought, and cogitated, and dreamed over it; it was of no use. He began\r\nto feel himself under the fascination of Hiram's calm, persevering,\r\ndetermined manner, a manner distinguished by tokens of latent power. For\r\nno one in praising him ever made the ordinary exclamations, 'Such a\r\nsmart, energetic fellow,' 'So active and efficient,' 'A driving business\r\nchap.' No; on the contrary, one would set him down as quite the reverse,\r\nfor he was always very quiet, never in a hurry, and by no means rapid in\r\nhis motions. Yet he impressed you with an idea of his superiority, which\r\nhis peculiar repose of manner served to highten. It can easily be\r\nguessed that Mary Jessup and J. Pease quarreled, at last seriously, and\r\nthe engagement, if there had been any, was broken. The next evening, on\r\nher return from the sewing-society with Hiram, he ventured to retain her\r\nhand in his, and from that time she felt that there was an\r\n'understanding' between them. She would have found it difficult to say\r\nwhy, for Hiram had never spoken sentimentally to her. His conversation\r\nwas on ordinary topics, yet always in a low, meaning, confidential tone.\r\n\r\n[Has the reader any desire that I should lay bare the innermost thoughts\r\nand feelings of this youth not yet eighteen? Would you like to be told\r\nhow curiously he smiled to himself as he continued to sweep out and sand\r\nthat little village store? Would you care to know how he gloated over\r\nthe discomfiture of his rival? Shall I endeavor to depict his feelings\r\nwhen he saw he had actually gained the affections of Mary Jessup, for\r\nwhom, beyond a sensuous enjoyment of her presence and her society, he\r\ndid not care a fig? Shall I explain how, while acting for his employer\r\nquite as a good, honest man would act, his motive was to serve self and\r\nself only? or shall I permit the reader gradually to acquire a knowledge\r\nof Hiram's characteristics as the narrative proceeds?]\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the end of Hiram's first year with Mr. Jessup. He had\r\naccomplished nothing rapidly, but he had kept on accomplishing something\r\nevery day. He had not made a single false step. The consequence was, he\r\nhad not a single step to retrace. The end of the year found him already\r\nvery high in Mr. Jessup's esteem. Hiram had proved his value by\r\nincreasing his employer's business at least ten per cent in the village,\r\nwhile he was daily becoming more popular with all who traded at the\r\nstore. To Pease this was an enigma, for Hiram never volunteered to wait\r\non a customer, when the former was present, and only stepped forward\r\nwhen specially sought. Even with the young ladies who came to the place,\r\nwith whom he was on intimate terms of acquaintance, Hiram found no time\r\nto laugh and talk, although he always managed to say an agreeable word\r\nin a quiet, low tone. Toward Pease, Hiram's conduct was always the same,\r\nperfectly respectful; as if never losing sight of the situation of the\r\none as head-clerk and of the other as subordinate. But by continually\r\nmaking himself so useful in the establishment, he was gradually\r\nundermining his comrade's position, and Pease felt his influence\r\ndissolving, he hardly knew how or why; but he felt it all the more\r\nforcibly for not knowing.\r\n\r\nThus the commencement of the new year found the occupants of the cash\r\nstore. Hiram's situation had become very agreeable. He was putting into\r\npractice the theories of his education. He was high in favor with his\r\nemployer, and whenever he entered the house, which was but a few steps\r\nfrom the store, he was greeted by Mary Jessup with that peculiar welcome\r\nso charming between those who love each other, yet which to him was\r\npleasing only because it gratified his animal nature and his self-love.\r\n\r\nEarly in the second year, an incident occurred which served to bring out\r\nHiram's character, and change decidedly the state of affairs. One\r\nmorning, while he was engaged with a customer, Mrs. Esterbrook entered\r\nthe store. Now, that lady was the wife of Deacon Esterbrook, one of the\r\nmost substantial men of the town, and a strong supporter of the Smiths.\r\nIn fact, she had never set foot in Mr. Jessup's place before that\r\nmorning, but certain goods, lately ordered by the Smiths, were\r\nunaccountably delayed, while Mr. Jessup's were fresh from the city and\r\njust opened. The dress-maker had been engaged, and could not come again\r\nfor she did not know how long, and Ellen must have a nice school-dress\r\nready forthwith. So the lady determined for once to break over rule, and\r\nstep into the opposition store. No doubt the fact that so respectable\r\nand pious a young man as Hiram was a clerk there had its influence in\r\nthe decision; it made the place itself more reputable, many said. And\r\nnow she came slowly in, a little distrustful, as if entering on\r\nforbidden ground, and expecting to see some extraordinary difference\r\nbetween the place of business of an ungodly person like Jessup and that\r\nof the honest-minded Smith. Thanks, however, to Hiram's persevering\r\nindustry, it was a model of neatness and order, and Mrs. Esterbrook, who\r\nwas herself a pattern in that way, found her harsh judgment insensibly\r\nrelaxing, as she stepped to the counter where Pease stood, and asked\r\nquite amiably to see some of the best calicoes, just in from New-York.\r\nPease, the narrow-minded idiot, thought this a good time to play off a\r\nsmart trick on one of Smith's regular customers. So he paraded a large\r\nvariety of goods before her, and took occasion to recommend a very\r\npretty article, for which he charged a monstrous price, because he said\r\nit was a very scarce pattern, and it was with great difficulty they had\r\nsecured a single piece. As the lady herself could perceive, it had not\r\nbeen opened before; not a soul in the village had even seen the outside\r\nof it. Now, it must not be supposed that Mrs. Esterbrook was different\r\nfrom the rest of her sex, and insensible to the pleasure of having the\r\nfirst dress cut from the piece. Indeed, she determined, on this\r\noccasion, to take two dresses instead of one; Emily was coming home, and\r\nwould want it. Just as Pease was about to measure off the desired\r\nquantity, Mrs. Esterbrook exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'You are sure those colors are fast?'\r\n\r\n'Fast, ma'am! fast as the meeting-house round the corner. We will\r\nwarrant them not to run nor change. Why, for color, we have nothing like\r\nit in the store.'\r\n\r\nAll this time, Hiram had been serving his customer; but with both ears\r\nand at least one eye attentive to what was going on near him.\r\n\r\nAgain Pease commenced to measure, when Hiram stepped deliberately\r\nforward and said:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Pease is mistaken, Mrs. Esterbrook, those colors are _not_ fast.'\r\n\r\n'What the----' hell do _you_ know about it? Pease was going to say; but\r\nhe stopped short at the second word, utterly abashed and confounded at\r\nthe extraordinary assumption of the junior clerk. Never before had Hiram\r\nmade such a demonstration. Now he stood calm and composed, firmly\r\nfortified by the truth. He looked and acted precisely as if he were the\r\nprincipal, and the objurgation of Pease died on his lips. He attempted\r\nto cast on Hiram a contemptuous glance, as he managed to say:\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you know more about it than I do,' and turned away to attend to\r\na new-comer.\r\n\r\n'I am much obliged to you, Mr. Meeker, I declare,' said Mrs. Esterbrook.\r\n\r\n'On the contrary, it is I who should be obliged to you for looking in.\r\nYou must excuse the mistake. Mr. Pease is not so familiar with calicoes\r\nas I am. But I will now wait on you myself. We have a box of goods in\r\nthe back-store, not yet open, and I am sure I can find in it just what\r\nyou want.'\r\n\r\nAny one who had seen Hiram's air, and heard him speak, would have taken\r\nhim for the proprietor. With what a low, respectful tone he addressed\r\nthe lady. How pleasantly it fell on the ear. An immense box of\r\nmerchandise to be opened and all the contents overhauled to please her!\r\nCharley was summoned, hammer and hatchet freely used, and the goods\r\ndisplayed. Hiram, who knew much better what Mrs. Esterbrook wanted than\r\nshe knew herself, selected something very acceptable. The price he put\r\nat first cost. Not content with that, he actually sold the lady silk for\r\na dress, putting it at cost also, and no human being could have been in\r\nbetter humor than she.\r\n\r\n'I am very sorry, Mrs. Esterbrook, for your disappointment about the\r\nfirst calico you selected,' continued Hiram. 'I do hope you and other\r\nmembers of your family will look in often, even if you do not purchase;\r\nit sometimes helps one to form a judgment to look at different stocks.\r\nBut I must be perfectly frank with you. We profess to sell cheap, very\r\ncheap, but I can never offer you similar articles at the price you have\r\nthese; they are given you precisely at cost, as a slight compensation\r\nfor your trouble in having to look a second time. Besides, it is a\r\nmatter of mere justice to those worthy people, the Smiths, to say we do\r\nnot sell our goods at these prices, and I beg you not to so report it.'\r\n\r\n'What an excellent young man you are,' said good Mrs. Esterbrook, in the\r\nfullness of her heart.\r\n\r\n'My dear madam, really I can not see any special excellence in simply\r\ndoing my duty.'\r\n\r\nHiram smiled one of his amiable, winning smiles, and bowed his new\r\ncustomer politely out of the store.\r\n\r\nBy this time the dinner-hour had arrived. Not a word had been spoken by\r\nPease to Hiram since the scene just recounted. Not a syllable did he\r\nutter at table. Hiram, on the contrary, entered into familiar\r\nconversation, placid as usual, and enjoyed his dinner quite as well as\r\nhe ever had done. When the meal was over, Pease asked Mr. Jessup if he\r\nwould step into the store a few minutes. Mr. Jessup accordingly walked\r\nover.\r\n\r\n'I want to know, Mr. Jessup,' he demanded, when all were together,\r\nincluding Charley, 'whether you are the owner in here or Hiram Meeker?'\r\n\r\n'Why do you put such a question, Pease?'\r\n\r\nThereupon Pease told the whole circumstances very much as they occurred.\r\nMr. Jessup made no reply. He was taken aback himself. Hiram said not a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n'It's so, an't it, Charley?' cried Pease.\r\n\r\n'I've nothing to say about it,' answered the boy. He liked Hiram, and\r\ndetested Pease, and was glad to see him humiliated.\r\n\r\n'It is so,' observed Hiram.\r\n\r\nMr. Jessup was astounded.\r\n\r\n'I shall think the matter over seriously, young men, and make up my mind\r\nabout it this evening. Now let us attend to business.'\r\n\r\nMr. Jessup had decided in his own mind that Hiram's conduct was very\r\nreprehensible--not that he cared about Pease being snubbed, _that_ he\r\nrather enjoyed than otherwise, but he thought what Hiram had done would\r\nserve to cast discredit on the establishment. Before, however, deciding\r\nto censure him in presence of his fellow-clerks, he determined to speak\r\nwith him privately. He took occasion without the knowledge of Pease, to\r\nask Hiram to step to the house, and once there, he requested him to give\r\nhis version of the affair. Hiram replied that Pease had stated it very\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n'What could be your object,' asked Mr. Jessup, 'in doing what would\r\nthrow disgrace on my store, for you know such an admission would\r\ndisgrace us?'\r\n\r\n'To serve your interests, as in duty bound,' replied Hiram.\r\n\r\nMr. Jessup could not so understand it, and Hiram undertook calmly to\r\nexplain how dishonest it was for Pease to do as he did. It had very\r\nlittle effect on Mr. Jessup. His nerves were too strong to be unsettled\r\nby a moral appeal. He told Hiram he was to blame, and said he should be\r\nobliged to so express himself, when they all met, and he must add a\r\ncaution for the future.\r\n\r\n'Fool!' exclaimed Hiram, startled out of his usual calm propriety, 'do\r\nyou not comprehend if that woman had gone out of your store with the\r\ncalico, that she not only would never enter it again, but she would\r\npublish your name over town as a swindler and a cheat, and you never\r\nwould hear the end of it. Pease had charged her double prices, and the\r\ngoods would not stand a single washing. And you know whether or not you\r\nare ready to pay off the mortgage Deacon Esterbrook holds on this\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\nMr. Jessup colored deeply. When he purchased his house he left a pretty\r\nlarge mortgage on it, which the owner had sold to Deacon Esterbrook, who\r\nwas a moneyed man, and who now held it quite content with his yearly six\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n'You seem to interest yourself in my private affairs,' said Mr. Jessup\r\nin a sarcastic tone.\r\n\r\n'Why shouldn't I, sir, so long as I am in your employ,' answered Hiram,\r\nwithout noticing the irony.\r\n\r\n'You're a devilish strange fellow, any how,' said Mr. Jessup, musingly,\r\n'but I confess I never had a person about me half so useful.'\r\n\r\n'I could be of much more service to you if you would conduct your\r\nbusiness on strict mercantile principles.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what would you have me do different from what I am doing?'\r\n\r\n'I would have every thing done straight and HONEST, Mr. Jessup,' said\r\nHiram firmly.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to say I am not honest?'\r\n\r\n'It is not necessary for me to say any thing on the subject. I am only\r\ntalking about the management of your business. You censure me for not\r\nstanding still and seeing one of your neighbors grossly cheated, by\r\nwhich you would have lost some of the best customers in town, to say the\r\nleast. By taking the course I did, I saved the credit of the concern\r\ninstead of injuring it, and I even spoke of it as a mistake of Pease,\r\ninstead of a deception.'\r\n\r\nMr. Jessup was already convinced, as indeed, his petulance proved, that\r\nHiram was right, but he had some pride in not appearing to yield too\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n'I understand the matter better now, and really, Hiram, you did just\r\nabout the right thing, that's a fact. Honesty is the best policy, after\r\nall. I shall tell Pease he did very wrong to attempt any of his tricks\r\non such a person as Mrs. Esterbrook, and in future--'\r\n\r\n'In future one of us must be an absentee from the premises,' said Hiram\r\ncoolly.\r\n\r\n'Why, what do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Just this. Pease's year is up next week, and then one of us must\r\nleave.'\r\n\r\nMr. Jessup fell into a brown study. He reflected on the admirable manner\r\nHiram had performed his duties; he could not shut his eyes to the fact\r\nthat several excellent customers had been secured through his influence;\r\nhe considered the respectability of the Meeker family, and called to\r\nmind how indifferent Mary had become to Pease, while she seemed\r\ngratified when Hiram was near. Again, Pease, when measured by Hiram's\r\nmore comprehensive tact and shrewdness, seemed a booby, a nobody, and\r\nMr. Jessup wondered how he ever acquired such an influence over him, and\r\nhe was the more disgusted with himself the more he thought about it.\r\n\r\n'It is working right, after all,' he said to himself. 'I shall be well\r\nrid of Pease, and Hiram shall take his place.' Then rising from his\r\nseat, he observed: 'I will think the matter over carefully, and you\r\nshall have my decision on the day. Now set to work as if nothing had\r\nhappened.'\r\n\r\nHiram went back to the store as certain of the fate of Pease as if he\r\nwas himself to decide it. 'Check-mated'--something like that passed from\r\nhis lips. His countenance, however, gave no sign of triumph, nor,\r\nindeed, of any feeling.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. Jessup announced that, after due consideration, he\r\nwas of opinion the conduct of Pease was so censurable that the\r\ninterference of Hiram was very proper, if not, indeed, praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you would like to settle with me?' said Pease ferociously.\r\n\r\n'Just as you please,' replied Mr. Jessup.\r\n\r\n'Well, I guess I have staid about long enough in this place when I've\r\nlived to see you coming the honest dodge so strong as that--darned if I\r\nhan't!'\r\n\r\nNext week Pease had quit, and Hiram Meeker was head-clerk.\r\n\r\nGreat was the astonishment through the town when it was ascertained that\r\nPease had been 'discharged from Jessup's store for cheating'--so the\r\nstory went. Mr. Jessup was too shrewd not to make the most of the\r\ncircumstance. He declared, in his off-hand manner, that he never\r\nprofessed to have the strait-laced habits of some people; he confessed\r\nhe did not like a fellow the less for his being 'cute in a trade, and\r\neyes open, but when it came to lying and cheating, then any of _his_\r\nfolks must look out if he caught them at it, that's all.\r\n\r\nWith most of the people this frank, open avowal was very convincing; but\r\nthere were certain obstinate persons such as are every where to be\r\nfound, and who are fond of going against the general opinion, who did\r\nnot hesitate to declare this was all gammon. They knew Jessup too well\r\nto 'allow' he cared any thing about it, not he. Nothing but the fear of\r\nthat honest young Meeker led to the disgrace of Pease, who no doubt\r\nwould now be made the scape-grace for all Jessup's shortcomings in the\r\nstore-way. So it went. But in the balance of accounts Jessup was a great\r\ngainer. Of course, numerous were the questions put to Hiram. He\r\npreserved great discretion--would say little. It did not become him to\r\nspeak of Mr. Jessup's private matters. Good Mrs. Esterbrook was not\r\nsilent, however. The story was repeated and repeated. It reached the\r\nparsonage; it found its way among the customers of the Smiths. Mrs.\r\nEsterbrook felt herself a good deal raised in her own importance, that\r\nthe head-clerk of a store she was never in before should be summarily\r\ndismissed for misconduct toward her. She began rather to like that Mr.\r\nJessup, (the calicoes and silk proved such bargains, and just what she\r\nwanted,) a man to do as he did was not so very far out of the way, and\r\nas for his wife, she was a charming woman, she always said so. Mary,\r\ntoo, what a sweet girl! Well, she should at least divide her custom\r\nbetween the two stores if the Deacon was willing--and the Deacon was\r\nwilling, for he wanted Jessup to do sufficiently well to keep up his\r\ninterest money prompt. Not only did Mrs. Esterbrook call frequently, but\r\nso did many others of the Smith faction. I need not say that Hiram was\r\nindefatigable. He secured the services of a nice, active young fellow,\r\nwhom he took great pains to teach, and every thing went on like\r\nclock-work. Mr. Jessup was content, for he saw he was constantly gaining\r\ncustom, but, in fact, he was a good deal confused, and hardly felt at\r\nhome in his own place, so completely did Hiram bring it under his own\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he undertook was an entire overhauling of the stock, and\r\na close examination of its value. Then he insisted, yes, insisted that\r\nthe prices should be marked in plain figures on the goods, so every body\r\ncould see for themselves.\r\n\r\nJessup remonstrated: 'Thunder! what will become of us at this rate? I\r\ntell you there are some it won't do to be frank with. Even old Smith\r\nnever undertook to expose his marks!'\r\n\r\n'The very reason why we should do so,' said Hiram. '_We_ are honest.'\r\n\r\nI wish you could have heard the tone in which Hiram said that, and have\r\nseen the expression of his countenance. It made Jessup's flesh creep, he\r\ndid not know why. So Hiram, as usual, had his own way, and overhauled\r\nevery thing. Lots of old goods piled away out of sight, as unsalable,\r\nwere brought forward, carefully examined, and marked down, on an\r\naverage, to half cost. Then appeared hand-bills to the effect that Mr.\r\nJessup had determined, prior to getting in a complete new, fresh,\r\nfashionable lot of dry goods, to dispose of the stock on hand at a\r\ntremendous sacrifice. These were sent all over the country into the\r\nadjoining villages, every where within twenty miles. How the people\r\nrushed to buy, and when they came, and found really that great bargains\r\nwere to be had, they resolved to come again when the new goods should\r\narrive.\r\n\r\nThus Hiram triumphed. In six months after J. Pease left, Benjamin\r\nJessup's store was _the_ store of Hampton, and Benjamin Jessup himself\r\non the road to prosperity and wealth.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker was sitting alone in his room over the store, late one\r\nevening. He had been with Mr. Jessup a year and eleven months. Another\r\nmonth, and the second year would be completed.\r\n\r\n'I believe,' so ran the current of his thoughts, 'I have learned pretty\r\nmuch all there is to be found out here; have not done badly, either.\r\nCousin Bennett's advice to mother was right. I am not ready to go to\r\nNew-York yet. There is much country knowledge to be gained. Let me see,\r\nI will drive over to Burnsville next week. Joel Burns is carrying every\r\nthing before him, they say. All sorts of business. A first-class man;\r\nneither a Smith nor a Jessup. I met Sarah Burns last week at a party\r\nover at Croft's--lovely girl. I think Burnsville will suit me.'\r\n\r\nThereupon Hiram Meeker took up his Bible, which lay on the table near\r\nhim, drew himself a little closer to the fire, moved the lamp into a\r\nconvenient position, and read one chapter in course; it was in\r\nDeuteronomy. Then he kneeled in prayer for about five minutes. As soon\r\nas he had finished, he went to bed, equally satisfied with his labors\r\nand his devotions; complacently he laid his head on the pillow, and was\r\nsoon asleep,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'I _am_ sorry to go, Mr. Jessup, but I have my fortune to make yet, you\r\nknow, and I must look a little to my own interests.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but confound it, Meeker, what is it you want? I expected to raise\r\nyour salary; in fact, it's no account what you charge me, you mustn't\r\ngo, that's settled.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed I must.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what is the matter? If you say so, I will take you into\r\npartnership, though you are not one and twenty. Really, Hiram, don't\r\nleave us in this way.'\r\n\r\n'I repeat, I am sorry to do so, but as I have no intention of living in\r\nHampton, it is now time I should quit.'\r\n\r\n'But what on earth am I to do without you?'\r\n\r\n'Persevere in the course you are now pursuing. Stick honestly to good\r\nprinciples, Mr. Jessup, and you will continue to prosper.'\r\n\r\n'Damn it, I know better,' exclaimed Jessup pettishly; 'I mean--I swear I\r\ndon't know what I mean, [Hiram's cold blue eye was fixed calmly on him,]\r\ncussed if I do; but I say 'tan't honesty which has done the thing for\r\nme. No; old Smith is honest--so is his son; I respect both of them for\r\nbeing so, yes I do. You are honest, too, Hiram; straight as a\r\nshingle--have always found you so; but I can't tell why, yours seems\r\nanother sort of honesty from Smith's honesty, and that's a fact.'\r\n\r\nBenjamin Jessup had a dim perception of the truth, but the more he tried\r\nto explain, the more he floundered, till Hiram came to his relief and to\r\nhis own also, for he did not greatly enjoy the comparison Jessup was\r\nattempting to institute.\r\n\r\n'I think I understand you. The fact is, in the management of your\r\nbusiness, I have endeavored to combine what tact and shrewdness I am\r\nmaster of with scrupulous fair dealing and integrity.'\r\n\r\n'That's it, Hiram, now you've hit it, but it's the shrewdness that's\r\ndone the work. Oh! I shall never get a man who can fill your place.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn due course, Hiram left for Burnsville. The prayers and good wishes of\r\nthe village went with him. Mary Jessup was disconsolate; but why? Hiram\r\nhad never committed himself. All the girls said: 'What a fool she is to\r\nthink he was going to marry any body older than himself!' and they\r\nlaughed about Mary Jessup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWBERN AS IT WAS AND IS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat part of North-Carolina borders on the Sound, has within the past\r\nsix months became the theatre of events of the most exciting nature, in\r\nwhich Newbern, its principal town, has borne a prominent part.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to review its history. The earliest notice of it\r\ndates back to the explorations of Raleigh's colony in 1584, when they\r\nvisited an Indian town named Newsiok, 'situated on a goodly river called\r\nthe Neus,' but the adventurers did not examine the river, and more than\r\na century elapsed before any further record of the visit of white men\r\noccurred. The north-eastern counties had, however, been partially\r\nsettled by refugees from Virginia, where in the absence of law and\r\ngospel they became as degraded a community as there was on the\r\ncontinent. Their descendants have, to a considerable extent, overrun the\r\nSouth to the Mississippi and on to Texas.\r\n\r\nBut it was the good fortune of the counties on the Neuse to derive their\r\nimmigrants from and to have their institutions formed by a better class\r\nthan the inferior families of Virginia, further degraded by a residence\r\nin Eastern North-Carolina, at that period known as the harbor for rogues\r\nand pirates.\r\n\r\nThe earliest settlers on the Neuse were French Huguenots, who first\r\nlocated on the James River, in Virginia, but were afterwards induced by\r\nthe proprietors of Carolina to accept grants of land in what is now\r\nknown as Carteret County, to which place they removed in 1707. In 1710\r\na colony from Switzerland and Germany, under the management of Baron de\r\nGraffenreid and Louis Michell arrived, and were settled between the\r\nNeuse and the Trent, and in the triangle formed by these rivers, laid\r\nout a town with wide streets and convenient lots, which in remembrance\r\nof the capital in the Old World, was called New-Bern.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who already resided north of New-Bern soon rebelled against\r\ntheir local government, and by continued depredations on the Indian\r\ntribes in their vicinity at last brought on a fearful war, during which\r\na large part of both the white and red men were exterminated, so that\r\nmany of the poor Swiss and German Protestants found they had only\r\nescaped their vindictive persecutors at home to find a bloody grave in\r\nthe forests of Carolina.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of their grant to the crown by the lords proprietors\r\nof Carolina, in 1729, a better state of affairs succeeded, and a more\r\nenergetic government, with its blessings and prosperity was the result.\r\nThe country was then settled and Newbern gradually rose to be a place of\r\nimportance, and subsequently the capital of the province.\r\n\r\nThe first printing-press in the province was established in 1764, and\r\nthe first periodical, _The North-Carolina Magazine_, issued the same\r\nyear, but it is doubtful if any book excepting the State laws was ever\r\npublished there. A public school was incorporated the same year, and\r\nNewbern became the principal seat of education and social intelligence\r\nin the province. As the seat of government and the residence of the\r\nroyal Governors, it attracted much wealth, and developed a degree of\r\nculture which it has retained to a later day.\r\n\r\nArthur Dobbs, for a long period the Colonial Governor, was at this time\r\nclosely identified with the history of Newbern. He was 'by birth an\r\nIrishman, and by nature an aristocrat.' He died at an advanced age in\r\n1764.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, William Tryon succeeded Dobbs as Governor of North-Carolina. He\r\nfirst resided at Brunswick, on the Cape Fear River, then a town of note,\r\nbut now a complete ruin, and where among its remains are still seen the\r\nmassive walls of St. Philip's Church, built by his request, at the\r\nexpense of the British government.\r\n\r\nAs Newbern was a more central position, and possessed more social\r\nadvantages, Tryon took up his abode there, not, however, till he had\r\nmade himself odious by irritating the people of the western part of the\r\nprovince into a rebellion, and had butchered many who were contending\r\nonly for justice and their rights.\r\n\r\nTryon was aristocratic, tyrannical, and vindictive. To gratify his pride\r\nhe conceived the idea of erecting a magnificent palace, and to obtain an\r\nappropriation from the Provincial Assembly he exhausted all his promises\r\nand intrigues. In this effort on the legislators he was aided by the\r\nblandishments of his lady and her sister, Miss Wake, relatives of Lord\r\nHillborough, and he was finally successful. The result was, that he\r\nerected in Newbern, in 1770, the most elegant and expensive building on\r\nthe continent, the cost of which was far beyond the resources of the\r\nprovince. The plans of it, which are still preserved, show that the old\r\ndescriptions of its splendor are not overwrought. Its foundations can\r\nstill be traced, and a part of one of the wings, though in a dilapidated\r\nstate, is yet in existence.\r\n\r\nA Provincial Congress was held at Newbern, in August, 1774, of which\r\nJohn Harvey was President. In April, 1779, they elected delegates to the\r\nfamous Continental Congress which met at Philadelphia, and Newbern was\r\nfor some time the most important place in the province.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution, the State was twice invaded by the British, and\r\nmany towns suffered severely, but Newbern being remote from the seat of\r\nwar, did not particularly feel its effects.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange that in Newbern secession once found its\r\nstrongest opposition, and finally its death-blow. It will be\r\nrecollected that North-Carolina once extended to the Mississippi, and\r\nincluded all of what is now the State of Tennessee, the whole of which\r\nterritory was ceded to the United States in 1784. It was then partially\r\nsettled, and before the general Government had accepted the grant, the\r\nresidents established a temporary government, and formally seceding from\r\nNorth-Carolina, formed 'the State of Franklin.'\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June, 1785, the Legislature assembled at Newbern, when\r\nGovernor Martin addressed them on this subject. Declaring that 'by such\r\nrash and irregular conduct a precedent is formed for every district and\r\neven for every county in the State, to claim the right of separation and\r\nindependence for any supposed grievance as caprice, pride, and ambition\r\nmay dictate, thereby exhibiting to the world a melancholy instance of a\r\nfeeble or pusillanimous government, that is either unable or dares not\r\nrestrain the lawless designs of its citizens,' he advocated putting down\r\nthe movements by force if necessary. But the leaders were not to be\r\ndissuaded from their ambitious purpose, and being joined by a few\r\nadjoining counties in Virginia, they elected General Sevier, a hero of\r\nthe Revolution, as Governor, and the insurrection assumed a formidable\r\nshape. But the old State met the trouble energetically, and after\r\nexhausting all proper conciliatory measures, Sevier, with several of the\r\nleaders, was arrested, their councils became divided, and the rebellion\r\nwas crushed. The leaders asked and obtained pardon, and an act of\r\namnesty was passed, so that in the subsequent political changes the\r\nmatter was forgotten.\r\n\r\nFor a long period Newbern has been the residence of wealthy and\r\ninfluential families. George Pollock, a descendant of one of the\r\noriginal proprietors, who died some thirty years ago, dwelt there. He\r\nowned immense tracts of the best land in the State, and over a thousand\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nThere, too, was the home of Judge Gaston, a learned lawyer and a most\r\nestimable man, who, though a Roman Catholic, was respected by all sects\r\nand conditions, even in those days of fierce sectaries. John Stanly for\r\na long time gave celebrity to Newbern as a lawyer and legislator, his\r\noratorical powers being second to those of no man in the State. He was\r\nthe father of Edward Stanly, now appointed to act as military Governor\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nThe country around Newbern was originally moderately fertile, but much\r\nof it has become exhausted by reason of improper tillage. The forests\r\nwhich were once a vast extent of stately pines, and from which great\r\nquantities of turpentine and tar were for a century and a half exported,\r\nare now little better than barren fields. Pine lumber and staves have\r\nlong been a large article of export, which with corn and cotton make up\r\nnearly all the articles sent abroad. But the pines are now nearly\r\nexhausted, the trade in naval stores and lumber lessened, and in\r\nconsequence a better state of agriculture has commenced. It is found\r\nthat by the aid of fertilizers good crops of cotton can be raised on the\r\npine lands and the fields kept in an improving condition. For the last\r\nthirty years it can hardly be said that the town has improved; indeed,\r\nas a whole it has hardly held its own. Still it is a place of wealth and\r\ncomfort. There is an air of respectability in its ancient and stately\r\nbuildings, its wide streets, and abundant shade-trees, and it is as\r\nhealthy as any Southern town can be.\r\n\r\nSome twenty years ago Newbern had what no other Southern town possessed,\r\na commerce of its own, that is, vessels built, owned, and sailed by its\r\nown people. Many of these--then engaged in the West-India trade--were\r\npartly manned by slaves who belonged to the proprietors of the vessel or\r\nits captain, and at times, when other seamen could not be procured,\r\nthese slaves were allowed to make a voyage to a Northern port, but as\r\ntheir value yearly augmented, and the risk of their suddenly\r\ndisappearing, not again to visit 'Dixie,' increased in a corresponding\r\nratio, they gradually retired to other duties where their services were\r\nless precarious.\r\n\r\nAnd here I will relate an anecdote which an old salt once told me when I\r\nwas strolling along the wharves of this ancient town in his company.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a bar, or 'swash,' which stretches inside Ocracoke\r\nInlet, (at that time the only passage to the sea,) the vessels take in\r\nbut a part of their cargoes at Newbern, while lighters with the\r\nremainder accompany them across the 'swash,' where the lading is\r\ncompleted. Quite a number of small craft are thus constantly employed,\r\nand they are generally manned and commanded by slaves. In this trade was\r\nonce engaged 'Jack Devereaux,' an intelligent black man who formerly\r\nbelonged to the Devereaux family--one of the F.F.s of Newbern--but who\r\nhad latterly become the property of H---- & C----, a mercantile firm\r\nthen doing a flourishing business there. He was captain of a famous\r\nlighter, which for its enormous carrying capacity had received the\r\ncognomen of 'Hunger and Thirst.' In due time the firm of H---- &\r\nC----dissolved, and C---- 'moved West,' leaving an undivided half of\r\nCaptain Jack in the hands of his attorney. Jack had sailed the craft 'on\r\nshares,' and compromised his services by monthly wages to his masters,\r\nand so had gradually accumulated some hundreds of dollars. Not fancying\r\nhis new share-holder, he concluded to invest his hard-earned dollars in\r\nhis own bone and muscle, or in other words, buy half of himself. After\r\nconsiderable higgling, he made the bargain, paying five hundred dollars\r\nfor the share. On the next trip to the bar, as the entrance to the sea\r\nis usually called, there came up one of those sudden hurricanes known as\r\na Southeaster, whose force nothing can withstand. The small craft was\r\nfoundered, and Jack, after floating for a long time on a plank, finally\r\ndrifted on to a sand-spit, and was saved.\r\n\r\nFinding a passage home, he landed on the 'old County Wharf,' a\r\nmelancholy, disheartened, and depressed individual, and without\r\nconferring with a single person, made his way to the attorney, from whom\r\nhe had so lately purchased himself, and by dint of persuasion succeeded\r\nin having the trade canceled and his money returned. Jack was then\r\nhimself again. He recounted over and over his adventures by flood and\r\nfield to his wondering friends, and said no man, white or black, could\r\nimagine the trouble he felt when floating on that plank, the waves\r\nbreaking over him every moment, when he considered he had just bought\r\nhalf of 'dat nigger' that was now going to destruction, and paid all the\r\nmoney he had for him. But he had 'traded back,' and then if he was\r\ndrowned, 'he wouldn't lose a cent by it.' It was long after this event\r\nwhen he told me he would never again risk a cent in 'nigger' property,\r\nit was too 'onsartin' entirely. Jack was a good deal of a wag, and told\r\nthis story with a gusto I can not describe.[A] But if Captain Jack is\r\nstill on this 'side of Jordan,' he has doubtless ere this found 'nigger'\r\nproperty still more 'onsartin.'\r\n\r\nLet us, however, turn from the past to the present condition of affairs\r\nin Newbern. Secession would never have originated there. When\r\nSouth-Carolina passed its act of folly and madness, it met with a firm\r\nopposition from the old Whig party, which still had here a vital\r\nexistence. Every exertion was made throughout the State to repel the\r\ninsidious influences of the demagogues of South-Carolina and Virginia,\r\nand but for the Jesuitical management of the politicians at Richmond,\r\nthe 'Old North' would have remained loyal. But all the efforts of the\r\ntrue Union men could not avail in warding off the storm that swept over\r\nthe South; and the Convention at Raleigh passed, or rather was forced to\r\nassent to, the Act of Secession, on the twentieth of May, 1861. In\r\nAugust the fortifications below Newbern were commenced, and continued\r\nfor some months, and well garrisoned, till they were supposed capable\r\nof defending the town against any force that might be brought against\r\nit. General Burnside, however, attacked them on the fourteenth of March,\r\n1862, and after a sharp battle the rebels fled, and he occupied the old\r\nplace as a military conquest. All the wealthy and prominent citizens\r\nfled, and have not returned.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of things will not long continue; a more permanent\r\ngovernment, either civil or military, will soon be established, and with\r\nit must come a new era which will settle for all time the destiny of\r\nNewbern.\r\n\r\nShould the leading men of the town and all Eastern North-Carolina make\r\nan effort and throw off the incubus that slavery has for a century\r\nplaced over it, a bright career of prosperity would open before them. A\r\nnew emigration, bringing energy and industry, would restore their\r\nworn-out lands, drain their swamps, educate their youth, and make\r\nNewbern echo with the hum of manufactures and commerce. The enterprise\r\nof such a people would soon open a channel from the Neuse to Beaufort\r\nharbor, and so avoid the shoals and dangers of Ocracoke and Hatteras,\r\nand with the present railroads, make it the port of exchange for a wide\r\nextent of country. The times are propitious; already the true men of the\r\nState--and their name is legion--are anxiously awaiting the fall of\r\nRichmond, when they will decide for the old flag and the Union, never\r\nagain to repudiate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR BRAVE TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if we, as a people, have any conception of the grandeur and\r\nglory of the Times in which we are living; if we at all appreciate the\r\nimportance of the history which is being lived all around us; if we feel\r\nthe colossal magnitude of the every-day events which so crowd upon us\r\nthat we have hardly time to grasp them; if we are fully aware of the\r\ninfinite possibilities of what has been so well called this 'fearfully\r\nglorious present'? I think not, and I do not know that it is possible\r\nfor us to do so. Only when we look back upon it from the hight of the\r\nfar-off future, shall we see the country through which we are journeying\r\nin all its grand, sweeping outlines, its majestic proportions, and its\r\nimperial tints of coloring. The days of peace and tranquillity in a\r\nnation as in a life are robed in colors sweet and grateful to the\r\neye--softened hues of green and gold--but the days of war and\r\ntribulation are days of scarlet and crimson, and all that can be seen in\r\nheaven and earth is black and flame; but the days when Right achieves\r\ngreat triumphs, even through bloodshed and desolation, are days of\r\nimperial purple, hues royal in their magnificence. Thank Heaven that,\r\nthrough the days of blood and black, we have at last reached the purple\r\ndays of life as a nation. A little more than a year of war, and now the\r\nskies are brightening. Thank God! for they have been black, black, black\r\nwith horror and suffering and crime. And yet such a year as this, I am\r\nalmost persuaded, is worth a score of years of peace. It certainly has\r\nachieved more for truth and humanity and God than the score of years\r\nwhich preceded it. As a nation, we had become almost despicable. Such\r\nsupple, yielding slaves of 'Democratic' demagogues; such cringing,\r\nfawning, knee-bending, hand-kissing agents of the diabolical, traitorous\r\nSlave-Power; such apologists and supporters of Wrong; such\r\npusillanimous, weak-hearted advocates of the unpopular Right; such\r\nslaves to Cotton and its threats, that we had almost lost the God-given\r\nindependence of American freemen, and seemed--thank God! events have\r\nproved only _seemed_--to be entirely given up to money and mechanics,\r\nto have become, indeed, a nation of peddlers. So much so, indeed, that\r\nour prophets were stoned in their own lands, our apostles stricken down\r\nin the national councils, and the few voices that were raised for God\r\nand humanity, from out the miry slough of a trafficking age, were almost\r\nunheard in the general din which went up from all the nations, and the\r\nburden of whose song seemed to be: 'There is no God but Cotton, and we\r\nare all his prophets.' But the moment the first gun was fired, how all\r\nthis changed! How regally the whole nation rose up! How magnificently\r\nshe threw off the garment of rags and filth which had hidden her fair\r\nproportions, and donned the imperial toga of humanity, and wrapping the\r\nrich folds of the gorgeous mantle around her, stood out before the world\r\nin all the dignity of freedom and virtue--a form which made the whole\r\nearth glad and the heavens clap their hands in exultation. What giant\r\nleaps the nation made in manhood and heroism, strides following each\r\nother thick and fast, until the most cynical of the doubters of humanity\r\nbegan to open their eyes, and acknowledge that they would not have\r\nthought her capable of such unexampled deeds. The national heroism which\r\nthe Northern people have displayed is indeed unparalleled. They have\r\nrisen up as one man to the support of the Government. They have offered\r\nproperty and life and the most sacred treasures of the heart upon the\r\nshrine of constitutional liberty. At the sound of the drum, they have\r\nleft the farm and the barn, the anvil and the mill, the church and the\r\nforum, and formed into the grand army of invincibles which, at the word\r\nof command, have marched forward, conquering and resistless. They have\r\nborne patiently with delay and defeat, with blunders and crimes, with\r\nhumiliation and taxation, and have, in short, proved themselves\r\n_Americans_ worthy of the name. Of course, national heroism has inspired\r\nindividual heroism, and to-day the country blazes from frontier to\r\nmetropolis with gallant records of daring deeds. Their number is\r\ninfinite; they can not be individually remembered, but only massed\r\ntogether, one sublime mosaic by which the gallantry and heroism of the\r\nfree, untrammeled North is proved. We doubt not there is a leaf for each\r\nhero in the heroic record of heaven, and the due share of hero-worship\r\npaid to each by those angels who love to pore over the chronicles of\r\nearth. And we mourn less over the coming of this war at the present time\r\nthan we should, did we not perceive that sooner or later it was\r\ninevitable. It was written in the fate-book of God. Never before was war\r\nso emphatically a war of principle. It mitigates the suffering much to\r\nknow this. It is something to know that all the brave men who have\r\nfallen have fallen for the right; and when we believe so, we do firmly\r\nbelieve that their death will give liberty and happiness to millions yet\r\nto be. We can not think but that their lives are well spent. There are\r\nsome who are written upon God's muster-scroll as martyrs to liberty. Who\r\nwould not esteem it a happiness and a glory to belong to this Old Guard,\r\nwho from age to age have rallied and rallied and rallied to the support\r\nof liberty, to the rescue of this holy sepulchre from the hands of\r\ndesolators and barbarians, who have ever fought where the fight was\r\nthickest, have ever been the advance-guard of the world in its onward\r\nprogress, and been enshrined in the great heart of the world, there to\r\nglow like the stars forever and ever? Is it a hardship to die that one\r\nmay live forever? Is it a hardship to die that millions who now live in\r\nwailing and woe, in chains and degradation, may live in happiness and\r\nfreedom in all time to come? The voice of the great army of American\r\nfreemen rolls back the answer, like the majestic anthem of the sea, No!\r\na deep, continuous no, which echoes from the broad Atlantic to the\r\nsunset-dyed Pacific, from the summits of Nevada to the great lakes of\r\nthe North. Yes, I tell you the whole people feel the depth and\r\nsacredness of this war; they feel it to be, as Carlyle said of the\r\nFrench Revolution, 'truth, though a truth clad in hell-fire.'\r\n\r\nThen forward, noble army of the brave and true! Rally and forward, and\r\nforward again, until every Malakoff of Wrong is reduced, and every\r\nsuffering Lucknow of our country hears the slogan of deliverance. You\r\nhave glorious successes to cheer you now. You can think of Somerset and\r\nDonelson, and all the glorious battles of the war--of forts taken, of\r\nenemies driven, of towns evacuated, of the great cities of the enemy in\r\nour hands, of all the stirring, glorious successes of our army and our\r\nflag--and even had you none of these to think of, you could think of our\r\ncause, and this would be enough. Then let the bugles sound, the trumpets\r\nclang, the drums beat, the cannons roar, and we will march, and rally,\r\nand forward, and charge and charge and charge, until victory or death\r\ncrown our labors; and if death to us, so let it be--it will be victory\r\nto our successors. This is the spirit of our Northern army. Sing\r\nplaudits to it, ye sons of song. Let your eloquence be inspired by it,\r\nye golden-mouthed men--ye Everetts and Sumners. Write of them, ye gifted\r\nwho would live in the coming time. Weave garlands for them, ye\r\nwhite-handed and lily-browed. Write anthems and oratorios for them, ye\r\nmen of music. Pray for them, each and all of you, night and day, with\r\nheart and voice. But we can not, if we would, overlook the desolation\r\nwhich the war has brought and must bring upon our favored land. We can\r\nnot conceal from ourselves the fact that, end when it will, or how it\r\nmay, it must bring desolation to thousands of happy households, and\r\ninflict never-healing wounds upon thousands of happy hearts. For every\r\nman who falls in battle some one mourns. For every man who dies in\r\nhospital-wards, and of whom no note is made, some one mourns. For the\r\nhumblest soldier shot on picket, and of whose humble exit from the stage\r\nof life little is thought, some one mourns. Nor this alone. For every\r\nsoldier disabled; for every one who loses an arm or a leg, or who is\r\nwounded or languishes in protracted suffering; for every one who has\r\n'only camp-fever,' some heart bleeds, some tears are shed. In far-off\r\nhumble households, perhaps, sleepless nights and anxious days are\r\npassed, of which the world never knows; and every wounded and crippled\r\nsoldier who returns to family and friends, brings a lasting pang with\r\nhim. Oh! how the mothers feel this war! If ever God is sad in heaven, it\r\nseems to me it must be when he looks upon the hearts of mothers. We who\r\nare young, think little of it, know nothing of it; neither, I think, do\r\nthe fathers or the brothers know much of it; but it is the poor mothers\r\nand wives of the soldiers. God help them! But the theme is too sad--let\r\nus leave it. And amid this wild rush of war, let us not forget our\r\nindividual duties and responsibilities. Carlyle truly says: 'Each of us\r\nhere, let the world go how it will, and be victorious or not victorious,\r\nhas he not a little life of his own to lead? One life--a little gleam of\r\nlife between two eternities--no second chance to us for evermore.' Let\r\nus not forget the loves, the amenities and charities of social life. Let\r\nus not forget that the education of the world must go on as ever, that\r\nthe great virtues of charity and self-denial must more than ever be\r\nexercised, and that the discipline and perfection of our own characters\r\nis as ever our grand life-work. Then let the angry waves of tumult dash\r\nup and froth at our feet, let the skies blacken and the tempest roar,\r\nGod is over all. This one thing we are to remember, and be cheerful.\r\nBrowning says:\r\n\r\n    'God's in his heaven--\r\n    All's right with the world.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS AND THE PARTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom two points of view, the great and preëminently _American_ nation\r\nvibrates at present in a crisis of immense historical significance. The\r\nfirst is, that of the war between the United and so-called Confederate\r\nStates, which is virtually a strife between Free Labor seeking to\r\nenlarge its sphere and retain its power against agricultural aristocracy\r\nmaintained by slave labor. All the energies and theories of industrial\r\nprogress, of science, and of constant intellectual development; in a\r\nword, all that is most characteristic of 'the spirit of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury,' is enlisted on the one side; all that is fading out and\r\nwearing away, with all that characterizes the unwisest conservatism has\r\ntaken its last stand on the other. It is the old story of 'the\r\ngeneration which comes and of that which goes,' reduced to the intense\r\nform of a fierce fight. All of this--but little understood within a very\r\nfew years--has been of late made generally intelligible on this side of\r\nthe border, thanks, perhaps, as much to Mr. Hammond's word 'mudsill' as\r\nto any other cause. In the short sentence which declared that there\r\nshould always exist, in every community, one ever-sunken and permanently\r\ndegraded class, the great point of difference between the South and\r\nNorth was set forth in a form intelligible to the humblest capacity, and\r\nit _was_ understood--how well has been shown in many a bloody field.\r\n\r\nThe other crisis in which we are at present involved is domestic and\r\npurely political. It is the growth of opposing political parties, and\r\nits existence is undoubtedly to be regretted, if we take only a\r\n_superficial_ view of the causes of its birth. We could all wish for\r\nsome time to come--perhaps forever--to see only a single Union-party,\r\nwith all men, looking neither to the right nor the left, pushing\r\nsteadily on to the great goal of unity, commercial development, and\r\nsocial progress. But we forget that so surely as night follows day, even\r\nso surely, in every community, will there be a conservative section and\r\na progressive; the 'extreme right' of the former consisting of frozen\r\nconservatives, advocating the preservation of every antiquated evil,\r\nbecause it has acquired in their eyes a halo of 'respectability,' while\r\non the 'extreme left' of their opponents will be found the radical\r\ninnovators, for whom no extravagance of reform is too great; so that as\r\neach molecule or group of atoms has its positive and negative electrical\r\npoint, and as each atom in turn obeys the same law, so we see the\r\npositive and negative poles of North and South again reflected in the\r\nrapidly increasing divisions among us of Conservatives, who, by a\r\nsingular fatality, still indicate the plebeian origin which they would\r\nnow so gladly disown by the term Democrats; and, on the other hand, of\r\nRepublicans, nick-named at present Radicals--somewhat unjustly; since\r\nthe term is strictly applicable only to a very limited portion of their\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThere were men of high intelligence among the founders of the _old_\r\nDemocratic party; men who understood in many respects the true interests\r\nof humanity and its inevitable tendency, under the influences of free\r\nlabor, free schools, and science. But with the masses, it owed its\r\ngrowth to the old assumed 'natural antagonism' of labor to capital, or\r\nof 'the poor against the rich.' It was essentially the same party as\r\nthat which was played upon by low demagogues like Cleon in the old Greek\r\nday; by men who stirred up the poor and ignorant against the privileged\r\nand rich, for their own selfish advantage. Of late years, more\r\nenlightened and intelligent views have prevailed in all parties, and the\r\nCleons of the present day have been compelled to adventure more and more\r\namong the lowest and most ignorant for dupes. For the workman is\r\ngradually learning with his employer that there is a harmony of\r\ninterests and a gradual adjustment of the prices allotted to the\r\nrelative values of time, labor, brains, and capital, and that the most\r\nserious obstacle to this adjustment is, the keeping up of a constant\r\nwarfare between laborers and employers. It is the skilled _employé_ who\r\nbecomes himself the capitalist in due time, under a peaceable and\r\nwell-organized system, as labor and brains rise in value, and the\r\ngreatest impediment to his rise is a settled state of war between\r\nhimself and the employer. Education and political equality, the\r\ncompetition of capital, and the ever-increasing appreciation of\r\nintelligence, are constantly promoting this harmony and enabling labor\r\nto secure its rights.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how the ancient Democracy, or rather its leaders,\r\nhaving for many years held political supremacy and shared the spoils,\r\nactually took the place of their opponents, and, in their decline,\r\nnaturally enough, formed a coalition with the intensely aristocratic\r\nSouth. Meanwhile, what became of the once aristocratic Opposition, with\r\nits 'silk-stocking gentry,' as they were termed? Like the Democracy, it\r\ndied a natural death, so far as the active enforcement of its principles\r\nwas concerned, after those principles had no longer a foundation in the\r\nsocial developments of the age. Here and there, an old and incurable\r\ndevotee to mere forms or party shibboleth, who could not comprehend the\r\nnew order of thought, went over to the 'Democratic' conservatives. Of\r\nsuch were the old gentlemen who, in Philadelphia, voted for the white\r\nwaistcoat and immaculate snowy neck-tie of James Buchanan. They fled to\r\ntheir ancient foes, that they might die happily in the holy odor of\r\nrespectability, quite ignorant that a new gospel of what may be termed\r\nRespect Ability was being preached, and building up a higher and grander\r\norder of nobility than they had ever dreamed of.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the arrogance of the South and its desperate struggle to\r\nsecure political preponderance, by extending slavery to the territories,\r\ndeveloped in the North a free-soil and free-labor party, which received,\r\nmost appropriately, the name of Republican. The doctrine of free-labor\r\nbeing intimately allied to every other form of social freedom, and of\r\nactive thought and social science, had a natural affinity for\r\n'intellect.' The old Opposition, which had boasted, or been taunted\r\nwith, possessing 'all the dignity,' including that of superior culture,\r\nswelled the ranks of this new party with writers and thinkers of\r\neminence. So it grew in power, taking in, of course, many varied\r\nelements, both good and bad.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the proper conduct of the war, and the\r\ndisposal of the enemy in case of victory, soon led to decided\r\ndifferences between the Democracy, who could not--owing to ancient\r\ncustom--throw aside their love for the name, or their antipathy to the\r\nnew doctrines which threatened their power. The mass of them had grown\r\nup in firm alliance with the South, and duped and cat's-pawed as they\r\nhad been--irritated as they were at the treachery of their old allies\r\nand despite the noble service which many of them rendered, in fighting\r\nthe common foe--many have never been able to hate _ab imo pectore_ the\r\nmen of that false and foul feudal party which, when the rupture fairly\r\ncame, expressed for their old allies a scorn and contempt deeper even\r\nthan they felt for 'the Abolitionists.' In vain the South protested\r\nfiercely that it meant disunion and nothing but disunion, and made its\r\nwords good by offering, both in Europe and in its own press, to\r\nsacrifice, if need be, even slavery, rather than be longer bound to the\r\nNorth; still, the remaining ultra Democracy could not, would not, even\r\nnow _will not_ believe that the South would or could be so unfriendly.\r\nIt was this hope of compromise and conciliation which lost us forts, and\r\nships, and millions of dollars in munitions of war; for it was said:\r\n'The South is only boasting, and must not be driven to extremes.' With\r\neyes wide open to the thefts, the Democratic leaders smiled a languid,\r\ncowardly assent, and let the enemy prepare for war. And war came. It\r\nmight have been prevented; it might, beyond all doubt, have been limited\r\nand crushed; but the hand of the braggart South had been so long on the\r\nthroat of the doughfaces, that they dared not move, and the doughfaces\r\nwere in power. The country at large has had to pay dearly for that old\r\ndoughface love for the South; it is paying every day in lives and money.\r\n\r\nEven now, it is amazing to see how the leaders among the Democracy,\r\nwhile pecking the South with the bill, continue to fondle it with the\r\nwing. Again and again, since the war began, they have humiliated the\r\nNorth and encouraged the desperate foe by efforts at peace-parties,\r\nconciliations, outcries for amnesty, and entreaties not to 'exasperate'\r\nthe enemy. They have urged and advocated the maintenance of slavery, the\r\ngreat cause of Southern arrogance and secession, with as much zeal as\r\nany Southron of them all, and fiercely deprecated any allusion to a\r\nsubject which can no more he kept from consciousness than can a deadly\r\nand madly irritating cancer. Every suggestion, even the mildest and most\r\nequitable, for arranging this difficulty, has been stigmatized by them\r\nas out of place and time, while their press has, without exception, as\r\nwe believe, given currency to statements denouncing directly as\r\nswindlers and prostitutes the innocent and well-meaning men and women\r\nwho went South with the sole object of clothing, nursing, and teaching\r\nthe disorganized masses of blacks set free by our army. In all of this,\r\nwe have a melancholy illustration of the difficulty with which\r\nunthinking men of the blind mass which rolls itself away into 'parties,'\r\nand follows its leaders, embrace new truths or shake off old habits of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nWhile the modern Democratic party firmly believed--as its majority still\r\nseems to--that all this trouble was caused solely by the Abolitionists,\r\nand simply for the sake of liberating some four millions of blacks, they\r\nhad at least some color for their iron conservatism. European humanity\r\ndid not agree with us; but we of America are more tropical in our\r\nfeelings, and so we made up our minds that it _was_ too bad to cut one\r\nanother's throats for the sake of benefiting certain 'fat and lazy\r\nniggers,' who were probably rather better off as chattels than as free\r\nmen. But it is not from this point of view that the world is now\r\nbeginning to view the subject. Common-sense has ascertained clearly\r\nenough that without the agitation of Abolition, the South would have\r\nbecome intolerable and tyrannical--it was imperious, sectional, and\r\narrogant in the days of its weakness, while the Abolitionists scarcely\r\nexisted, and given to secession for any and every cause. The insolent,\r\nindividual independence which prompted the wearing of weapons, wild law\r\nand wild life, free from mutual social obligations, contained within\r\nitself the germs of withdrawal from a civilized and superior people and\r\na stable government. For such men, one pretense served as well as\r\nanother. They of South-Carolina employed Nullification long before they\r\ndreamed of Anti-Abolition.\r\n\r\nStill more absurd is the 'Democratic' opposition, since Abolition for\r\nthe sake of the Negro has been changed into the cry of _Emancipation for\r\nthe sake of the White Man_. Before this cry, before the inevitable and\r\nmighty demand of the free white labor of the future on the territories\r\nof the South, all protestations against 'meddling' with emancipation\r\nshrivel up into trifles and become contemptible. The prayer of the ant\r\npetitioning against the removal of a mountain, where a nation was to\r\nfound its capital, was not more verily frivolous and inconsiderable than\r\nare these timid ones of 'let it alone!' And _why_ let it alone? The\r\nEmancipation-for-the-sake-of-the-white-man party, as represented by\r\nPresident Lincoln's Message, commending remuneration, asks for no undue\r\nhaste, no violent or sudden aggressive measures. It is satisfied to let\r\nthe South free itself when it shall be disposed so to do; simply\r\noffering it a kindly aid when this measure shall become popular and\r\nexpedient. More than this we have never asked for in these columns; yet\r\nit would be hard to imagine a term of 'newspaper abuse,' which has not\r\nbeen given us by the 'Democratic' press. Yes, at a time when ninety-nine\r\nmen in a hundred in the free States avow that they would like to see\r\nslavery 'out of the way,' if only to avoid the endless war which its\r\ncontinuance _must_ entail, all mention of it is tabooed by the men who\r\nclaim to head the party of the virtual majority! No matter how far off\r\nthe friends of Emancipation and of the Administration are willing to\r\npostpone the practical execution of the measure, 'it must not be\r\nmentioned.' For the greater part, these Northern friends of the South at\r\npresent still earnestly desire the perpetual establishment of slavery\r\n'on a constitutional basis.'\r\n\r\nThe contemptible efforts at Washington to build up a separate and\r\ndistinct Democratic party, when no party save that of the Union existed,\r\nwill condemn to everlasting opprobrium the Vallandighams, Carlisles,\r\nGarret Davises, and other false friends of freedom, who at such a time\r\ncrowded together like hungry political cormorants, to hatch out the egg\r\nof faction, and secure a prospective share of the spoils. Have these\r\n'Conservatives' reflected on the disgraceful show which their names will\r\nmake _in history_, in after-years, when freedom shall have been\r\nproclaimed throughout the land, and when those who opposed its progress\r\nwill appear like nothing else than traitors! Heaven help the men who, at\r\na time when others were gathering in full measure of glory in a holy\r\ncause, were piling up naught but shame for their posterity. For it is\r\nnot more certain that God is just, than that the full measure of\r\niniquity will be heaped upon their names in the after-chronicles of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nEven to the present moment, the 'Conservative' alias the\r\n'Democratic'--or the Black, alias the White--party struggles with might\r\nand main to defend and protect its old Southern whippers-in, even at the\r\nrisk of dividing and distracting the Union. To effect this, it\r\nhas--almost successfully--insolently thrust the Commander-in-chief\r\nforward as _its_ centre, and broadly slandered the Secretary of War and\r\nPresident in no measured terms, as having toiled to defeat McClellan and\r\nprolong the war. Through all the glossy web of lies, the light of truth\r\nshines or will shine to their disgrace.\r\n\r\nChiefly and most unwisely is the conservative hand shown at present in\r\nopposition to every proposition for confiscation or punishing the\r\nrebels. After having hurried us by their cowardice and Southern\r\ntoad-eating into this war; after urging it by their contemptible\r\nprocrastination to its present tremendous proportions, they cry out\r\n'humanity!' for the men who have murdered our relatives, and shake the\r\nConstitution for protection over estates which have been directly used\r\nto contribute to Southern war! While every mail from the South gives\r\nfresh instances of desperation, and while we search in vain for a trace\r\nof proof that there is the slightest hope of reconciliation, we are\r\nstill entreated to restore every thing in _statu quo ante bellum_, and\r\nbear all the results of the war ourselves, as if forsooth we had been\r\nafter all in the wrong. And so the Vallandighams and Davises declare\r\nthat we were. 'Abolitionism caused it all,' they say, 'nothing but\r\nAbolition.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the question urges itself on us every day with more pressing\r\npower, how we are really to settle the whole difficulty? We see but one\r\ncourse--the 'Northing' of the South. We are content to waive for the\r\npresent all theory or project of confiscation, save so far as promoting\r\nthe settlement of those soldiers and emigrants who may wish to settle in\r\nthe South is concerned. _This_ question demands consideration, and must\r\nhave it. Whether the lands to be appropriated for this purpose come\r\nfrom rebel estates which have ministered to the war, or whether they are\r\nto be taken from State property, they must be had; for the settlement of\r\nthe South and the proper rewarding of the army are matters of paramount\r\nimportance. The South can no longer exist in its present social\r\ncondition. People who believe, to use the language of their most\r\nrespectable journal, the Richmond _Whig_, that:\r\n\r\n     'Yankees are the most contemptible and detestable of God's\r\n     creation; vile wretches, whose daily sustenance consists in the\r\n     refuse of all other people; for they eat nothing that any body else\r\n     will buy;... who have long very properly looked upon themselves as\r\n     our social inferiors, as our serfs:'\r\n\r\nPeople, we say, who believe this of us, must be taught to think\r\ndifferently and truthfully. If they lived in China, it would be\r\notherwise; but linked to us as they are, we can no longer tolerate such\r\noutrageous superciliousness as they manifest. Those among them who will\r\nlearn, may be taught; those who will not, must be supplanted by people\r\nwho are not too proud to work, who do not 'abominate the system of free\r\nschools, because the schools are free,'[B] and revile free labor,\r\nbecause it consists of 'greasy mechanics, filthy operatives, and\r\nsmall-fisted farmers.' The task is great; but it must be accomplished.\r\nThe war is drawing to an end; but a greater and nobler task lies before\r\nthe soldiers and the free men of America--the extending of\r\n_civilization_ into the South. Let us lift our minds above the narrow\r\nlimits of 'party,' and realize the mighty work which we have in hand.\r\nLet the introduction of free labor to the South be in future the subject\r\nto which every thinking American mind shall be devoted. Let them stream\r\nin by millions!--the free laborers of all the world!--there is room for\r\nthem all; and the right of man to work never yet had such fair and just\r\nopportunity to have justice done it. Agricultural aristocracy, supported\r\nby involuntary servitude and unsupported by manufactures, has been\r\ntried, and found worse than wanting. Let its place be filled as promptly\r\nas possible by that truly higher aristocracy of industry and of culture\r\nwhich is at present common to Europe and our own portion of America. The\r\nturn of the North to rule has at length come. Let its reign be\r\ninaugurated by great, noble, and philanthropic efforts to extend the\r\nblessings of true civilization to all the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                I WAIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I wait--watching and weary, I wait;\r\n      You wander from the way!\r\n    My heart lies open, however late,\r\n      However you delay!\r\n\r\n    I wait--watching and weary, I wait;\r\n      But day must dawn at last!\r\n    Together, beyond the reach of fate,\r\n      Love shall redeem my past.\r\n\r\n    I wait, ah! forever I can wait;\r\n      Forever? I am brave:\r\n    Time can not fathom a love so great--\r\n      It waits beyond the grave!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING THE CENSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses Grant sat in his vine-grown arbor one fine afternoon in August. A\r\nfine afternoon, I call it--a little sultry, to be sure, which made Moses\r\nGrant's eyes heavy; but the hum of the bees that played around the white\r\nclover-blossoms, and the sound of the leaves as they rustled in the warm\r\nwind, and the richly colored clouds that floated around in the deep,\r\ndeep blue of the summer sky, and a thousand other things which I will\r\nnot pause to note, but which every observing reader has noted on many an\r\nAugust day, made the afternoon I speak of as glorious as any afternoon\r\ncould be in all our glorious summer.\r\n\r\nMoses Grant's eyes were heavy--or eye-lids, if the reader should be a\r\ncritic. He had brought a book from his daughter's book-case. He\r\nremembered the volume--it was called _A Book of a Thousand Stories_--as\r\nthe one his daughter Mary read aloud one evening, when the witty turns\r\nof speech put all the company into the best of humor. But, somehow, the\r\nwit had now lost its point--the joke had lost its zest--and let him try\r\nas he would to collect his scattered thoughts, and let him set his eyes\r\non his book never so firmly, his fancy would go on long journeys into\r\nthe past, and come back again, wearied more and more with each journey,\r\ntill at last it had sunk to rest, and Moses Grant's eyes were closed.\r\nThe bees buzzed on, the leaves quivered as before, and the great world\r\nmoved in its wonted way, yet our hero did not heed it; the world moved\r\non just the same, O reader! as it will one day move--one long, long\r\nday--when you and I will not heed it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Moses Grant heard his name spoken. When aroused, he saw his\r\nneighbor, Johnson, seated in the rustic chair that mated the one in\r\nwhich he himself sat.\r\n\r\n'Good-day, neighbor Johnson,' said Moses Grant. 'What in the world are\r\nyou doing with that great book?'\r\n\r\n'I am taking the census.' And he began turning the leaves as if\r\nsearching for a lost place, remarking, laconically: 'Sultry.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, a very close afternoon. But is it ten years since the census was\r\ntaken? It seems but as many months. Oh! well, time flies!'\r\n\r\nAnd he looked at the beautiful sky and at the beautiful landscape, and\r\nlingeringly at his own stately mansion, guarded by venerable trees that\r\nhis own hand had transplanted from the forest--and the great truth,\r\nhalf-realized, yet almost as common as our daily life, that time was\r\nsweeping all things into the dead past, day by day and year by year,\r\ngave him a passing thought of how much he loved them.\r\n\r\nThe name of Moses Grant was duly inscribed in the book. Then the\r\nquestion was asked by neighbor Johnson:\r\n\r\n'When were you born?'\r\n\r\n'In the year 1800--sixty years ago the day before yesterday--though I\r\ndeclare I forgot all about my birthday.'\r\n\r\n'Well, how much real estate shall I set down to you?'\r\n\r\n'I _have_ said that I owned about fifty thousand dollars in that kind of\r\nproperty, perhaps a little more, but not half as much as some persons\r\nestimate.'\r\n\r\n'Well, how much personal property?'\r\n\r\n'I guess about twenty thousand will not go far out of the way, reckoning\r\nmortgages and all.'\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, which neighbor Johnson occupied by telling how Sime\r\nJones tried to get the appointment of census-taker by wriggling about in\r\nan undignified way, and in talking about the prospects of his political\r\nparty, the visitor left the old man, (such we have a right to call him\r\nsince he has confessed his age,) and the old man (he would not thank us\r\nfor using the term so often, for he tries to think he is still\r\nyoung--the old man, I must again repeat) fell a thinking. His eyes were\r\nno longer closed, although his book _was_; he leaned forward in his\r\nrustic chair, and commenced to talk aloud--which is said to be a growing\r\nhabit with most old men:\r\n\r\n'Sixty years of human life!' The words were uttered slowly, as though\r\ntheir full meaning were felt in the speaker's heart. After a little\r\nwhile they were repeated: 'Sixty years of human life!' There was a\r\nmournfulness in his voice now; it had sunk to the low, tender tones\r\nthat, years before, when his faithful wife vanished from earth, revealed\r\nto all his friends that there was sadness in his heart, while there\r\nseemed cheerfulness in his words. 'Welladay!' he continued; 'I have, at\r\nany rate, been a _successful_ man. My business has prospered beyond my\r\nexpectations, and I am what people call a rich man. There was a time\r\nwhen I feared I should come to want; but now, if I could but think so, I\r\nhave enough. And mine has been an industrious life. When I was elected\r\nto the State Senate wasn't my name held up in the newspapers as an\r\nexample for young men? Wasn't my reputation admitted to be spotless?\r\nYes, I _have_ been a successful man--more successful than nearly all who\r\nstarted with me.'\r\n\r\nAnd he began to look more cheerful and contented. He again looked at his\r\nmansion and broad fields, and again he opened his book. The jokes were\r\nbetter now than a little while before.\r\n\r\nBut the bees buzzed on; the trees sang their old soothing song; the air\r\nremained warm; and soon Moses Grant began to nod assent to his book,\r\nthough the matters it contained were not of opinion, but of fancy. By\r\nwhich I mean that he grew sleepy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSudden darkness fell upon the earth. The sun, after sending its rays to\r\nglitter in the river so brightly that Moses Grant put his hand over his\r\neyes as he looked from his arbor-door, went out, and the blackness of\r\nnight wrapped itself about the world. The elms, that had rattled their\r\ndeep green leaves in the wind, and the birch, that had so gracefully\r\nbowed its slender, yellowish head, were all colorless now. There was no\r\nstorm-cloud to veil the heavens, and yet the sad-faced moon came not out\r\nto remind the world of their lost loves and deferred hopes--nor the\r\nstars, to twinkle in their silence, as though there were a great Soul in\r\nthe skies that longed to speak to men, but had no utterance save a\r\nthousand love-lit eyes. All was darkness--dense, universal.\r\n\r\nYet Moses Grant had sat unmoved in his vine-grown arbor. His soul was\r\npassionless, his face was calm. His book had fallen to the ground, and\r\nhis head rested on the back of his chair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a visitor to the arbor. Moses raised his head and\r\nsaw a being--whether man or woman I can not tell--with a face, oh! so\r\nbright and calm, with eyes that looked from the deepest soul, and a pure\r\nforehead that spoke of unworldly rest--a face that shone in its own\r\nvista of light when all around was dark. The Presence bore an open book\r\nin its hands, and came and stood before Moses Grant and looked earnestly\r\ninto his face.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' he cried, half in fear, before the calm look of his\r\nvisitor, and half in confidence, because of the look of love.\r\n\r\n'I am the census-taker.'\r\n\r\n'No, no; it was he who came a little while ago.'\r\n\r\n'He was one census-taker--he came to learn how much you _seemed_ to\r\npossess; I come to learn your _real_ possessions. I am the real\r\ncensus-taker.'\r\n\r\nMoses Grant knew not what it meant; he sat speechless, in wonder. He\r\nwould have fled, but he knew not where he could flee in the darkness; he\r\nmust remain with his strange visitor, as all men must one day stand\r\nalone with an awakened Conscience.\r\n\r\n'When were you born?' asked the Presence.\r\n\r\n'Sixty years ago,' answered Moses.\r\n\r\n'You understand me not. I do not ask for the time when you were born\r\ninto your outward show of life, but when you commenced to live.'\r\n\r\n'Still I do not know your meaning,' said Moses.\r\n\r\n'Then you have not yet been born. You exist--you do not live. Say not\r\nagain that you have lived sixty years, for your being has not yet\r\nexpanded into life.'\r\n\r\nOh! what great thoughts and dark memories came into the mind of Moses\r\nGrant! Great thoughts of a nobler life of love than he had ever\r\nknown--of realities to which he was fast approaching--and a thousand\r\ndark memories that he had often tried to obliterate from his mind. A\r\nlittle while before, he thought he possessed a spotless reputation--and\r\nso he did possess a spotless reputation when judged by human law. No man\r\never knew him to steal; no man ever knew him to transgress any important\r\nlaw. Nevertheless, he had had his own ends to gain, and he had gained\r\nthem. Yes--we might as well confess it--Moses Grant had lived a selfish\r\nlife. He knew how to take advantage of the technicalities of law, and he\r\nknew how to be severe and unmerciful toward the poor. He remembered how,\r\nyears before, his son had longed for an education, and how the mother\r\nhad pleaded that he might go to school and to college, and how sternly\r\nhe said, 'No, I want him in my business;' and he remembered how he kept\r\nhim slaving at his uncongenial tasks, how he scolded because he still\r\npored over his books, until at last the mother had laid the poor boy in\r\nthe grave before he had attained to manhood. He remembered how the\r\nmother grew paler day by day--she who had been such a help-meet in all\r\nhis selfish schemes of hoarding and saving; how she had talked more and\r\nmore about her 'dear lost boy,' till he, Moses Grant, commanded her\r\nnever to utter that name again in his presence; how the mother still\r\nfaded and faded, till at last she too, was laid in a quiet grave beside\r\nher boy. All this came into the mind of Moses Grant. And then he\r\nremembered how he had taken a poor widow's cottage, because his\r\nmortgage-deed gave him the privilege--he never thought the _right_--to\r\ntake it; he remembered her sad face, that told of silent suffering, when\r\nshe moved with her children from the cottage her husband had built.\r\n'How,' he asked, in the silence of his own mind, 'oh! how could they say\r\nmy reputation was unspotted?' Yet he had transgressed no outward law,\r\nhad forged no mortgage-deed. He only acted like a man who thought that\r\nthis world could only be enjoyed when he possessed a title-deed to it\r\nall; like one who thought that above and beyond this world there was\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAll this time has the Presence stood before Moses Grant, looking into\r\nhis troubled face with its piercing eyes, and reading his every thought.\r\n\r\n'Answer me now,' it said, 'have you yet begun to live?'\r\n\r\nThen there was another and greater struggle in the mind of Moses. Pride\r\nsaid to him: 'Send this intrusive visitor away, or flee yourself.' But\r\nstill the visitor stood there, waiting so calmly, and again Moses\r\nrealized that the great world had faded from his vision; so he could\r\nneither send away the intruder, nor fly himself. Still those calm eyes\r\nlooked into his inmost soul.\r\n\r\n'Oh!' he cried at last, 'you have searched me through and through. No, I\r\nhave not lived--I have not been born, I have no life for you to record\r\nin your book. Now, pray leave me--leave me in peace!'\r\n\r\n'That were impossible,' said the Presence, 'you know not peace. You\r\npride yourself on your possessions; but how can you have life or\r\npossessions, if they are not recorded in my book? The earth, that you\r\nlove so well, has faded away. It will return to you for a brief moment,\r\nand then it will fade forever. What you now possess is but a shadow,\r\nlike a sun-gilt cloud in a summer sky--changing and changing, and fading\r\nand fading, till at last it disappears. You have, if God wills, a few\r\nmore years of mortal existence, and then, oh! then, you must exchange\r\nshadows for realities.'\r\n\r\n'Leave me, oh! leave me!' cried Moses.\r\n\r\n'Not yet; my mission is not fulfilled. Here in this book your name was\r\nwritten sixty years age, as one _to be_ born. Here your ledger has been\r\nkept, though you knew it not. Read the pages with your soul, and see how\r\nyour account stands.'\r\n\r\nOh! how dark the page. A line was drawn through the middle, from top to\r\nbottom, and the good deeds were recorded on one side, in letters of\r\ngold, and the bad deeds on the other side in letters of ink. As the\r\npages were turned, Moses looked eagerly for the bright letters, but they\r\nwere few--too few; while every page was almost filled with the black\r\nrecords of selfish and sinful deeds. Every page made Moses Grant sicker\r\nat heart, and he would gladly have withdrawn his eyes from the book, but\r\nthey were riveted, and he could not.\r\n\r\n'O poor man!' exclaimed the Presence, in pity; 'how poor do you find\r\nyourself, you who were a little while ago so rich! But you must read no\r\nmore, lest you sink in despair.'\r\n\r\nAnd the book was closed. Moses Grant said not a word; his heart was too\r\nfull to speak--too full of grief--too empty of hope.\r\n\r\n'Despair not,' continued the strange Presence. 'Your record is not yet\r\ncompleted. You may yet cancel all those black letters by writing golden\r\nones over them--which is to pray with your remaining strength and days\r\nfor forgiveness. You have been a hard, selfish man, for sixty years.\r\nMen, for their own interests, have called you respectable; but before\r\nGod you have merited displeasure and disapprobation. In the little time\r\nyou have left, perhaps you may not be able to leave the world as pure as\r\nyou began it; but you may hope for wonderful mercy and forbearance from\r\nGod our Father. Have courage, and faith, and hope, and you will yet be\r\nrich indeed--rich in love and joy and peace undefiled, that fadeth not\r\naway.'\r\n\r\nThen the Presence vanished. Still Moses sat in his chair. But a hand was\r\nlaid on his forehead, and he awoke as he heard Mary say: 'Father, supper\r\nis ready.' He drew his hand across his eyes, and arose from his chair.\r\nHe looked from his arbor-door. The world was all bathed in the light of\r\nthe declining sun. As he came out and looked on the landscape, he\r\nthought that never before had he seen it so dreamy--never before had he\r\nseen it so beautiful and so glorious, for never before had he so felt\r\nthe use of this world as a place in which to attain to the good and to\r\nshun the evil, to overcome temptation and to aspire to life.\r\n\r\nHis daughter wondered what caused his tone to be so tender that night;\r\nthe next day his neighbors wondered that he visited a certain poor,\r\nstruggling widow, and gave her the house her husband once owned; and in\r\nthe months that have since passed, many a poor family has wondered what\r\nhas turned their former oppressor into such a provident friend.\r\n\r\n_I_ only wonder that so old and selfish a man could have had so bright\r\nand heavenly a dream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n            A SENSIBLE EPITAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Reader, pass on: ne'er waste your time\r\n    On bad biography or bitter rhyme:\r\n    For what I _am_, this cumbrous clay insures,\r\n    And what I _was_, is no affair of yours.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELOPONNESUS IN MARCH.\r\n\r\n    'Fair clime I where every season smiles.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There, mildly dimpling, Ocean's check\r\n    Reflects the tints of many a peak\r\n    Caught by the laughing tides that lave\r\n    These Edens of the Eastern wave.\r\n    And if, at times, a transient breeze\r\n    Break the blue crystal of the seas,\r\n    Or sweep one blossom from the trees,\r\n    How welcome is each gentle air\r\n    That wakes and wafts the odors there!'\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with thoughts like these running in our heads, that we found\r\nourselves, at about half-past four o'clock, on a dark, cloudy, windy\r\nmorning, March fifteenth, 18--, rolling slowly along the uneven road\r\nthat leads from Athens to the Piraeus. Our guide was Dhemetri, of\r\ncourse--who ever heard of a guide that was not named Dhemetri? An\r\nexcellent guide he was, too, never missing his way, answering correctly\r\nall our questions to which he knew the answers, and fabricating answers\r\nto the rest as near the truth as his moderate knowledge of antiquity\r\nwould permit; providing us sedulously with creature comforts, and\r\nbesieging our hearts daily with delicious omelettes and endless strings\r\nof figs. Arrived at the Piraeus, we were transferred, with beds, cooking\r\napparatus, and baggage, to the Lloyd steamer, whose cloud of steam and\r\nsmoke was seen dimly in the gray morning. At a reasonable time after the\r\nhour advertised, we sailed into the open bay, passed near enough the\r\nisland of Ægina to see the ruined temple on one of its hights--almost to\r\ncount its columns--then coasted along the rugged shores of Argolis,\r\nwhich we eagerly studied with the aid of a map. Here was the peninsula\r\nMethana, and half hiding it, the island Calauria, where Demosthenes put\r\nan end to his life, once the seat of a famous Amphictyony. Then the bold\r\npromontory which shuts in the fertile valley of Troezer, then the\r\nterritory of Hermione, stretching between the mountains and the sea. We\r\ntouched at Hydhra, famed in the history of the Greek Revolution, a\r\nstrange, rambling town, picturesquely situated on a cleft in a bare\r\nisland of gray rock, and shortly after at Spetzia, a town of much the\r\nsame character; then toward night sailed into the beautiful bay of\r\nNapoli, or Nauplia, once the capital of Greece.\r\n\r\nIt had been our intention to procure horses that night, and ride as far\r\nas Mycenæ, but we were too late, so contented ourselves with a walk to\r\nTiryus, and a rapid examination of its ruins. The massive walls of this\r\nvenerable town--they were a wonder in the age of Pericles as in\r\nours--still stand in their whole circuit, and here and there apparently\r\nin their whole hight. It is a small, steep, mound-like hill--you can\r\nwalk around it in fifteen minutes--and within the walls the terraced\r\nslope, thickly sprinkled with fragments of ruins, is grown over with the\r\ntall purple flowers of the asphodel--a fit monument to the perished\r\ncity. From the citadel of Tiryus the view over the wide plain of the\r\nInachus, the broad bay beyond, covered with sails, the bold headland of\r\nNapoli crowned with the ruined castle, the noble citadel of Argos, and\r\nthe mountain ranges on every side, made a picture beautiful even under\r\nthe dull sky of that March evening. Our walk--quickened by the fear that\r\nthe city gates would be found closed--gave us a hearty appetite, and a\r\nclassic smack was imparted to our modest viands by the fact that Orestes\r\nhimself waited on our table. We slept well, notwithstanding the\r\nuncomfortable reputation of the inn, and set off early the next morning\r\nupon our wanderings.\r\n\r\nTraveling in Greece is no child's play. Roads there are none, except\r\nbetween some large towns; indeed, the nature of the country hardly\r\nallows of them, as it is made up chiefly of mountain ridges and ravines.\r\nNeither would the poverty-stricken inhabitants be able at present to\r\nmake much use of them. When I expressed to Dhemetri the great benefits I\r\nconceived that roads would confer upon the community, he asked\r\ncontemptuously: 'What good would roads be to them, when they have no\r\ncarriages?' Inns, too, there are none, or almost none; after leaving\r\nNapoli we found none until we returned to Athens. In their stead, each\r\nvillage has its _khan_, a house rather larger than ordinary, and\r\ncontaining one large unfurnished room for guests. Here a fire is made on\r\nthe hearth, (the smoke escaping, or intended to escape, through a hole\r\nin the roof, for chimneys do not exist,) and the traveler pitches his\r\ntent metaphorically in this apartment. The beds, which he carries with\r\nhim, are spread on the floor, to do double duty as seats during the\r\nevening and beds by night. Thus the accommodations are reduced to their\r\nlowest terms--shelter and fire; to which add a lamb from the flock, eggs\r\nin abundance, or sometimes a chicken, loaf of bread, or string of figs.\r\nWine, too, flavored with resin in true classic style, and tasting like\r\nweak spirits of turpentine, is to be had every where. But for any\r\nentertainment beyond this, the host is no-way responsible. If you do not\r\nchoose to sleep on the bare floor, you must bring beds and bedding with\r\nyou. If you wish the luxury of a knife and fork, you must furnish them\r\nyourself. Kettles, plates, saucepans, cups, coffee, sugar, salt,\r\ncandles, all came from that mysterious basket which rode on the\r\npack-horse with the baggage. Were I visiting Greece again, I would\r\neschew all these vanities--carry nothing but a _Reisesack_, or\r\ntravel-bag, as the Germans are wont to call every variety of knapsack--a\r\nshawl, and a copy of _Pausanias_, and live among the Greeks as the\r\nGreeks do; but I was inexperienced then.\r\n\r\nSo we set out with great pomp and circumstance, each on his\r\nbeast--_alogon_, the Unreasonable Thing, is the word for horse--while a\r\nfifth, with two drivers, carried our goods. A ride of about three\r\nhours--passing the silent and deserted Tiryus--brought us to the village\r\nof Charváti, the modern representative of the 'rich Mycenae.' Here,\r\nwhile Dehmetri prepared our breakfast, we followed a villager, who led\r\nus by rapid strides up the rocky hill toward the angle formed by two\r\nmountains. As we rose over one elevation after another, he plucked his\r\nhands full of dry grass and brush, and then leading us into a hole in\r\nthe side of the hill, informed us in good classic Greek that it was the\r\ntomb of Agamemnon. It is a large, round apartment, rising to the hight\r\nof forty-nine feet, and of about the same width, the layers of masonry\r\ngradually approaching one another until a single stone caps the whole;\r\nnot conical in shape, however, but like a beehive. A single monstrous\r\nstone, twenty-seven feet long and twenty wide, is placed over the\r\ndoorway. The whole is buried with earth, and covered with a growth of\r\ngrass and shrubs, and a passage leads from it into a smaller chamber\r\nhewn in the solid rock, in which our guide lighted the fuel he had\r\ngathered. The gloomy walls were lighted up for a moment, then when the\r\nfire died away, we returned to the open air. A little further on is the\r\nfamous gateway with two lionesses carved in relief above--the armorial\r\nbearings, we may call it, of the city--and in every direction are seen\r\nmassive walls, foundation-stones, ruins of gates and of subterraneous\r\nchambers like the first we visited, conical hillocks, probably\r\ncontaining others in equally good preservation, and other marks of the\r\nbusy hand of man--'_Spuren ordnender Menschenhand unter dem Gesträuch_.'\r\nSidney Smith says: 'It is impossible to feel affection beyond\r\nseventy-eight degrees or below twenty degrees of Fahrenheit.... Man only\r\nlives to shiver or to perspire.' I think it is so with the sublime and\r\nbeautiful, and deeply as I felt in the abstract the privilege I enjoyed\r\nin standing on the citadel of Agamemnon, and seeing the most venerable\r\nruins that Europe can boast, that keen March wind was too much for me,\r\nand I was not sorry to return to the khan, where, sitting cross-legged\r\non the floor, we ate with our fingers a roast chicken dissected with the\r\none knife of the family, and drank a bumper of resinous wine.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we remounted and rode back through the broad plain to\r\nArgos, traversed its narrow, dirty streets, stared at by the Argive\r\nyouth, examined its grass-grown theatre, cast wistful eyes at the lofty\r\ncitadel of Larissa, which time forbade us to ascend, then wound along\r\nthe foot of the mountain-range, saw at a distance on the seashore a spot\r\nof green, which we were told was Lerna, where Hercules slew the hydra,\r\nand near the road an old ruined pyramid, which we afterward examined\r\nmore closely, then followed a mountain-path, catching now and then a\r\nglimpse of the bay, following the crest of the ridge into the valley\r\nbeyond. On one of the undulations of the path we passed over the site of\r\nan ancient city, evidenced only by that most sure sign, a soil thickly\r\ncovered with potsherds. No classic writer mentions it, no inscription\r\ngives it a name; perhaps the careless traveler would pass without a\r\nsuspicion that he was treading on the street, or forum, or temple of a\r\nonce thriving town. Striking soon into the carriage-road from Napoli to\r\nTripolitza, and descending into a charming little valley with the\r\neuphonious name of Achladhókamvo, we were not sorry to find a khan, and\r\ntake up our quarters for the night. We found the family sitting on the\r\nfloor around a fire blazing on a hearth in the middle of a room, and\r\nhere we placed ourselves, watching the women spinning and Dhemetri\r\nmaking his preparations for supper. Out of the afore-mentioned basket\r\nquickly came all the afore-mentioned articles. A lamb was killed, and\r\nshortly an excellent supper was served up to us. Soon the guest-chamber\r\nwas announced to be ready for us, a large open room having a fire at one\r\nend, and containing our beds, spread on the floor, a cricket three\r\ninches high, that served as a table, two windows closed by shutters\r\ninstead of glass, and a large quantity of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a steep and picturesque path over Mount Parthenion--the\r\nsame path, I suppose, on which Phidippides had his well-known interview\r\nwith the god Pan--brought us to Arcadia. And at the name of Arcadia let\r\nnot the fond mind revert to scenes of pastoral innocence and enjoyment,\r\nsuch as poets and artists love to paint--a lawn of ever-fresh verdure\r\nshaded by the sturdy oak and wide-spreading beech, watered by\r\nnever-failing springs, swains and maidens innocent as the sheep they\r\ntend, dancing on the green sward to the music of the pipe, and snowy\r\nmountains in the distance lending repose and majesty to the scene.\r\nNothing of this picture is realized by the Arcadia of to-day, but the\r\nsnowy mountains, and they, indeed, are all around and near. No, let your\r\ndream of Arcadia he something like this: A bare, open plain, three\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea, fenced in on every side by\r\nsnow-topped mountains, and swept incessantly by cold winds, the sky\r\nheavy with clouds, the ground sown with numberless stones, with here and\r\nthere a bunch of hungry-looking grass pushing itself feebly up among\r\nthem. Not a tree do you behold, hardly a shrub. You come to a river--it\r\nis a broad, waterless bed of cobble-stones and gravel, only differing\r\nfrom the dry land in being less mixed with dirt, and wholly, instead of\r\npartly, destitute of vegetation. But your eye falls at last on a sheet\r\nof water--there is surely a placid lake giving beauty and fertility to\r\nits neighborhood. No, it is a _katavothron_, or chasm, in which the\r\naccumulated waters of the plain disappear. For as these Arcadian valleys\r\nare so shut in by mountains as to leave no natural egress to the water,\r\nit gathers in the lowest spot it can reach, and there stagnates, unless\r\nit can wear a passage for itself, or find a subterraneous channel\r\nthrough the limestone mountain, and come to light again in a lower\r\nvalley. Such a reäppearance we saw near Argos, a broad, swift\r\nstream--the Erasmus--rushing from under a mountain with such force as to\r\nturn mills; it is believed to come from a _kalavothron_ in the northern\r\npart of Arcadia. And not far from thence a fountain of fresh water\r\nbubbles up in the sea a few yards from the shore; this is traced to a\r\nsimilar source. In some parts of Greece the remains may still be seen of\r\nthe subterranean channels by which in ancient times the _katavothra_\r\nwere kept clear, and thus prevented from overflowing. In this way much\r\nland was artificially redeemed to agriculture.\r\n\r\nIf, now, you seek for the dwellers in this paradise, behold them in yon\r\nshepherd and his faithful dog--_Arcades ambo_--the shepherd muffled\r\nagainst the searching wind in hood and cloak, under his arm a veritable\r\ncrook, while his sheep and goats are browsing about wherever a blade of\r\ngrass or a green leaf can be found. His invariable companion is--I was\r\nabout to say a tamed wolf; but in reality, an untamed animal of wolfish\r\naspect and disposition, always eager to make your acquaintance. These\r\ncreatures are the torment of the traveler throughout Greece, and most of\r\nall in Arcadia. If on foot, he can pick up a stone, at sight of which\r\nthe enemy will beat a hasty retreat. Greece seems to have been\r\nbountifully supplied with loose stones of the right size for this very\r\npurpose, just as the rattlesnake-plant is said to grow wherever the\r\nrattlesnake itself is found. If on horseback, he can easily escape,\r\nalthough the animal will not scruple to hang to the horse's tail or bite\r\nhis heels. Such was Arcadia in March. No doubt, at another season it is\r\na delightful retreat from the overpowering heat of the Greek summer. It\r\nmay have a beauty of its own at that season; but there can be little of\r\nthat quiet rural landscape which we call Arcadian.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing this plain, visiting by the way the ruins of Tegea, which\r\nconsisted of a potato-field, sprinkled with bits of brick and marble,\r\nand a medieval church, with some ancient marble built into its walls, we\r\ncame to a broad river, the Alpheus, whose water, when it has any,\r\nempties in a _katavothron_ which we left on our right; followed it up in\r\na southerly direction until we came to a little water in its bed, then\r\ncrossing over some rolling land which divides the water-courses of\r\nArcadia from those of Laconia, we found ourselves in a country of a very\r\ndifferent character. The land was better, and was covered with a low\r\ngrowth of wood; we could even see extensive forests on the sides of\r\nParnon. The scenery became highly picturesque, and the weather, although\r\nstill rigorous, was more comfortable than in the morning. Night came on\r\nus long before we reached our journey's end, the wayside khan of\r\nKrevatá. There was a little parleying at the door, and Dhemetri seemed\r\ndissatisfied with what he saw, and disposed to carry us on to another\r\nresting-place. But thoroughly benumbed as we were, the blaze of light\r\nthat fell upon us from the half-open door quite won our hearts, and we\r\nfelt willing to risk whatever discomforts the place might have rather\r\nthan go further. As we entered the door, the scene was striking. A large\r\nfire was roaring in the middle of the room, filling it with smoke. On\r\ncushions and scraps of carpet, disposed about the fire, were crouched\r\nsix or eight men and women, dressed in their national costume, very\r\ndirty and equally picturesque. Two or three children were among them, or\r\nlay stretched at random on the floor asleep. A large, swarthy man\r\nopposite us held a child of two or three years, now nestling in its\r\nfather's arms, now climbing over to its mother, now gazing bashfully and\r\ncuriously at the strangers. Basil, ever ready on occasion, seized his\r\npencil and soon transferred the group to paper, to the admiration of\r\nthem all. They moved to right and left as we came in, and made room for\r\nus on the side next the door, where our faces were scorched, Our backs\r\nshivering, and our eyes smarting with the smoke. An old woman who sat\r\nnext me eyed us inquisitively, and would gladly have entered into\r\nconversation; but almost our sole Greek phrase, 'It is cold,' (_eeny\r\nkrió_), we had exhausted immediately on entering the room. Basil\r\nessayed Italian, having a vague idea that it would pass any where in\r\nGreece, as French does in Italy, but with no success. Neither was our\r\nconversation among ourselves brilliant. We were tired, cold, sleepy, and\r\nhungry, and we thought despairingly on the long miles back that we had\r\nlast seen our baggage. At length a shout at the door gladdened our\r\nhearts; our beds and that ever-welcome basket were handed in, and\r\nDhemetri was soon deeply engaged in preparing supper. Meanwhile, a fire\r\nhad been built in the upper room, and we went up by a ladder. But here\r\nwe were worse off than below. Roof, floor, walls, and (wooden) windows,\r\nall were amply provided with cracks and knot-holes, through which the\r\nwind roved at its will. A wretched fire was smoldering on the hearth,\r\nand a candle was burning in a tin cup hanging by its handle on a nail in\r\nthe wall, which, set it where we would, flickered in the wind. And when\r\nour supper came, fricassee, boiled chicken, roast hare, omelette, bread,\r\ncheese, figs, and wine--for such a bill of fare had Dhemetri made ready\r\nfor us--we swallowed it hastily, huddled our beds about the fire,\r\nwrapped ourselves in our blankets, and lay down at once. The inquisitive\r\nold lady below, on seeing the extensive preparations for the supper of\r\nthree fellow-mortals, was struck with reverence for us, and expressed\r\nher belief that those, who lived on such marvelous and unheard-of\r\ndelicacies would never die. We, indeed, had requested Dhemetri to cater\r\nmore simply for us; but his professional pride would not suffer it.\r\n\r\nWe were right glad when morning came, and after a mug of thick coffee, a\r\nbit of bread, and a handful of figs, we bid farewell to Krevatá with no\r\nregrets. A short ride brought us to the brow of the range on which we\r\nwere traveling, and there lay the valley of Sparta at our feet, and\r\nbeyond it the Taygetus, if not the highest, the boldest and sharpest\r\nmountain-range in Greece. Its white and jagged crest was still tipped\r\nwith clouds, and it appeared to rise from the valley of Sparta in an\r\nalmost unbroken ascent to its hight of seven thousand feet. This was the\r\nfinest single prospect of our journey; but we gladly left it, after a\r\nshort pause, to push on to the warmth and sunshine of the valley below.\r\nThe precipitous descent was soon accomplished; we forded the Eurotas, a\r\nbroad, clear, shallow stream, the only real river we saw in Greece, and\r\nstood in Sparta, its site marked by a group of low hills and a few\r\nunimportant ruins. The ground is good, and was then green with young\r\nwheat; the valley was sheltered from the winds which had persecuted us\r\non the highlands, and for a few hours in the middle of the day, the\r\nclouds were scattered, and we basked in the sun's rays. It seemed an\r\nElysium. A small and thrifty village has recently sprung up south of\r\nthis group of hills, still within the limits of the ancient city, and\r\nhere we dined in a café (_kapheterion_) kept by one Lycurgus, not on\r\nblack broth, but on roast lamb, omelette, figs, oranges, and wine.\r\nTruly, if national character depended wholly on physical geography, we\r\nshould be inclined to look in the valley of the Eurotas for the rich and\r\nluxurious Athens, and seek its stern and simple rival among the bleak\r\nhills and sterile plains of Attica. We had a short ride that afternoon\r\nup the valley of the Eurotas, with a keen north wind in our faces, and\r\nwere not sorry to reach Kalyvia at an early hour.\r\n\r\nDhemetri had sent the pack-horse with our baggage across by a shorter\r\npath, and now announced that we were to sleep to-night in a house\r\ninstead of a khan, that the mayor (_demarchos_) of Kalyvia had consented\r\nto receive us. Great was our exultation at the prospect of spending a\r\nnight in this aristocratic mansion, and in truth we found the\r\naccommodations here much the most comfortable--nay, we reckoned them\r\nluxurious--which we had on our journey. We were first shown into a small\r\nroom with one glass window, with tight walls, and a chimney. A fire was\r\nburning cheerfully on the hearth--that is to say, a stone platform\r\nslightly elevated above the floor. The floor around the fire was spread\r\nwith mats, and in one corner the lady of the house was--what shall I\r\nsay?--squatted upon the floor, engaged in domestic work. Her daughter, a\r\npretty, blue-eyed maiden, of some fourteen years, named Athena,\r\nglaykhôpis Hathhêna, was working by her side, and the demarch himself,\r\nwith his stalwart son, were similarly seated on the opposite side of the\r\nhearth. Three rough, unpainted stools, an extra luxury for guests, were\r\nbrought in for us, and we at once plunged into conversation.\r\n\r\n'_Eeny kriho_!' said we.\r\n\r\n'_Mhalista, mhalista, eeny krio_!' was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\nStimulated by our success, we made another attempt, and were overwhelmed\r\nby a flood of Romaic, to which we could only nod our heads gratefully,\r\nwith 'Málista, málista, charí, charí,' (certainly, certainly, thank you,\r\nthank you.) When we retired to our room, we found our beds laid on a\r\nsort of shelf along the wall, instead of on the floor, and our supper\r\nwas served on a table instead of in our laps, as we were used. The\r\nfamily shook hands with us cordially when we took leave, in the morning,\r\nplacing their hands on their hearts.\r\n\r\nThis day we rode through a rolling country, quite well watered and\r\nwooded, separating the waters of the Eurotas from those of the Alpheus,\r\nLaconia from Arcadia. As we reached the highest point, and were about to\r\ndescend, Dhemetri pointed out a village, distinguished by a single tall,\r\nslender cypress, with the words; 'There is Megalopolis.' This is the\r\ncity founded by Epaminondas, almost the only statesman of antiquity who\r\nseems to have had a dim conception of the modern policy of the balance\r\nof power, as a point of union for the jealous and disunited States of\r\nArcadia, and as a sentinel stationed at a chief entrance to Laconia. The\r\nwhole of his great project was not realized, and Megalopolis, instead of\r\nbecoming 'the great city' of Arcadia, was only a mate to Tegea and\r\nMantinea. Even thus, the work was by no means lost; a Spartan army, to\r\nreach Messenia, whose independence was to be secured, must pass through\r\nthe territory of Megalopolis, and even a second-rate city would answer\r\nas a guard. But not even Epaminondas could make of Arcadia a first-class\r\npower, and a sufficient counterpoise to Sparta. Megalopolis is now\r\nwholly deserted, and represented only by the little village of Sinanu,\r\nhalf a mile distant, where we stopped at a khan kept by an old soldier\r\nof Colocotroni, and ran, while dinner was preparing, to examine the\r\nscanty ruins of the great city--interesting only from their association\r\nwith a great name.\r\n\r\nReluctantly, we now turned our backs upon Messene, with its renowned\r\nfortress of Ithome, the sacred Olympia, and the beautiful temple of\r\nPhigalia, and began our homeward journey. Passing over a mountain from\r\nwhich we had a wide and beautiful view, we rode through a barren and\r\nuninteresting plain to the lonely khan of Frankovrysi, and early the\r\nnext day arrived at Tripolitza. We had had a clear sky at Megalopolis\r\nand Frankovrysi, but here, in the high table-land of Arcadia, we found\r\nthe self-same leaden sky and bleak winds we left three days before. This\r\nvalley or table-land stretches from north to south, nearly divided in\r\ntwo by the approach of the mountains from east and west. Thus the valley\r\ntakes the shape rudely of the figure eight; the southern part, through\r\none corner of which we had passed before, being occupied by Tegea, the\r\nnorthern by Mantinea. Tripolitza, to the northwest of Tegea, represents\r\nthe ancient Pallantium, the birthplace of Evander. Here Dhemetri brought\r\nus bad news. We had intended to go to Mantinea, thence north through\r\nOrchomenus, Stymphalus, and Sicyon, to Corinth; but the passes, we\r\nlearned, were impracticable for the snow, and we must recross Mount\r\nParthenion, and revisit Achladhokamvo and Argos. First, however, we took\r\na rapid ride to Mantinea, about eight miles through a level, tolerably\r\nwell-cultivated country. At the narrow passage between the mountains,\r\nthere stood in ancient times a grove of cork-trees, called 'Pelagus,'\r\nthe sea. Epaminondas, warned by an oracle to beware of the 'Pelagus,'\r\nhad carefully avoided the sea. But it was just in this spot that he drew\r\nup his troops for the great battle which cost him his life. When\r\nmortally wounded, he was carried to a high place called\r\n'Skope'--identified with the sharp spur of Mount Mænalus, which projects\r\njust here into the plain, and from this he watched the battle, and here\r\nhe died, like Wolfe, at the moment of victory. The well-built walls of\r\nMantinea still stand in nearly their entire circuit, built in the fourth\r\ncentury before Christ, after Agesipolis of Sparta had captured the city,\r\nby washing away its walls of sun-burnt brick, and had dispersed the\r\ninhabitants among the neighboring villages. The restoration of the city\r\nwas a part of the great system of humbling Sparta, set on foot by\r\nEpaminondas after the battle of Leuctra.\r\n\r\nAfter spending the night at Achladhokamvo, where we visited the ruins of\r\nHysiæ close by, we went next day through Argos, passing within sight of\r\nMycenæ, to Nemea, where, in a beautiful little valley, three Doric\r\ncolumns, still standing, testify to the former sanctity of the spot.\r\nThen to Kurtissa, the ancient Cleonæ, to pass the night. When Dhemetri\r\npointed it out to us from the hill above, it looked like a New-England\r\nfarm-house, a neat white cottage peeping out from among the trees, and\r\nwe rejoiced at the prospect. But lo! the neat white cottage was a\r\nguardhouse, and our khan was the rude, unpainted, windowless barn. It\r\nwas, nevertheless, very comfortable. There was a ceiling to the room,\r\nand the board windows were tight. The floor, to be sure, gaped in wide\r\ncracks; but as there was a blazing fire in the room beneath, the cracks\r\nlet in no cold air, nothing but smoke, a sort of compensation, as it\r\nseemed, for our having a chimney, lest we should be puffed up with pride\r\nand luxury. For we not only had a chimney, but a table and two stools,\r\none sitting on an inverted barrel spread with a horse-blanket. Here\r\nDhemetri concocted for our supper an Hellenic soup, of royal flavor, the\r\nrecollection of which is still grateful to my palate. And here a youth,\r\nnamed Agamemnon, son of George, came and displayed to us his\r\nschool-books, a geography, beginning with Greece and ending with\r\nAmerica, where Bostônia as put down as capital of Massachoytia. Longing\r\nto hear a Greek war-song, we requested him to sing, at which he warbled\r\nDehyte pahides tôn Hellhênôn to a tune which we strongly suspected he\r\ncomposed for the occasion, following it up with others, with such\r\ndelight that we were fain at last to plead sleepiness and let him\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\nWe were up betimes the following morning, for we had a long day's work\r\nbefore us. We were approaching Corinth, and knew that from the\r\nAcrocorinthus, a very high and steep hill over-hanging it, a prospect\r\nwas to be had inferior to none in Greece. The morning, though not\r\nactually unpleasant, was chill and hazy, and Dhemetri tried to dissuade\r\nus from wasting the time. But we were determined to see what there was\r\nto be seen, and after a ride of two or three hours over a rough country,\r\nwe entered the fortifications of this chief citadel of Greece. It is now\r\nguarded by a handful of soldiers, two or three neglected cannons thrust\r\ntheir muzzles idly over the rampart, and shepherds with their flocks\r\nroam at will within. A sharp wind was sweeping over the summit, and the\r\nmountains and islands--Parnassus, Cyllene, Helicon, Pentclicon, Salamis,\r\nÆgina--were veiled with a dull, opaque haze. While Basil, with stiff\r\nfingers, was sketching the view from the top, I wandered about with my\r\nother companion, picking spring flowers, reading the descriptions of\r\nPausanias, and studying the distant landscape. There is a thriving town\r\nat the bottom of the hill, and hither we descended, asking for the inn\r\n(Xenodhekeon) where Dhemetri had told us to meet him. But alas! modern\r\nCorinth can not sustain an inn; and we were obliged to eat our dinner in\r\na grocery, stared at by all the youth of Corinth. Half a dozen Doric\r\ncolumns, belonging to a very old temple, are the only considerable\r\nrelics of ancient Corinth. And as we had a long afternoon's work before\r\nus, we set off before twelve. We galloped at good speed across the\r\nIsthmus, about an hour's ride; Dhemetri, who understood the management\r\nof Greek horses, driving us before him like a flock of sheep. We paused\r\na moment at the Isthmic sanctuary of Poseidon, passed through the\r\nvillage of Kalamáki, whence steamers run to Athens, then continued along\r\nthe shore between Mount Geroneia and the sea, through a low, uneven\r\ncountry, well grown with pine, heather, arbute, gorse in the full\r\nsplendor of its yellow blossoms, and sweet-smelling thyme. The afternoon\r\nwas warm and bright. Here and there were flocks of long-haired sheep and\r\nsturdy black goats, cropping the grass and the shrubs, and it was well\r\nin keeping with the scene when we passed a shepherd, with his cloak\r\nthrown carelessly aside, leaning on his crook, and playing a few simple\r\nnotes--not a _tune_--on his flageolet to while away the time. We delayed\r\nhalf an hour at the miserable hamlet of Kineta, to rest one of the\r\nhorses, exhausted with our fast riding, then began the ascent of our\r\nlast mountain-pass. A spur of Mount Geroneia runs boldly into the sea,\r\nforming a wall between the territories of Corinth and Megara. It is\r\ncalled 'Kake-Scala,' 'Bad Ladder,' an odd mixture of Greek and Italian.\r\nHere, as the ancients fabled, dwelt the robber Skiron, plundering and\r\nmutilating all wayfarers, and throwing them into the sea; but Theseus\r\nsubdued him and subjected him to a like treatment, and thereafter\r\ntraveling was secure. No doubt Theseus crowned his labors by building a\r\nroad, as we know one existed here in antiquity, but it has long since\r\ndisappeared, and King Otho was then imitating him, as we found,\r\npresently, to our cost. The sun had already set, when the road became\r\nimpassable, and shouts from two men some distance above, informed us\r\nthat the building of the new road had rendered the old bridle-path\r\nimpracticable. We had to urge our horses down a steep, narrow path to\r\nthe water's edge, then as the beach was blocked up with huge rocks, to\r\nride a rod or two through the water, then climb up the steep rocks on\r\nthe other side, where one horse slipped and came near tumbling with his\r\nrider into the sea below. Ten minutes later, and we must have returned\r\nto Kineta, or waited an hour or two for the moon, for as soon as we were\r\nover this dangerous spot it became quite dark; but the path was now safe\r\nand easy to find. The full moon was up when we reached the top of the\r\ncliff, and the valley of Megara, the mountains, the bay, and the islands\r\nof Ægina and Salamis lay distinctly before us. We made all speed to\r\nMegara, cheered by the fame of its khan as one of the best in Greece,\r\nand by the certainty that there was now a good road all the way to\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested that we should take a carriage the rest of the way, but\r\nas our horses were hired to Athens, we decided not to incur the extra\r\nexpense. Soon after arriving, however, while Dhemetri was making us a\r\nsoup, and Diomedes was taking care of our horses, and Epaminondas was\r\nroasting us a joint of lamb, while we were squatting half-asleep on\r\nbolsters on the floor, hugging our knees, looking dreamily at the fire,\r\nand longing for supper and bed, the driver of the carriage came in, and\r\naddressed us in recommendation of his establishment in his choicest\r\nFrank, \"_Carrozza-very good-ye-e-e-s_!' then squatted down on the hearth\r\nbeside us, hugged his knees, and looked at the fire with infinite\r\nself-satisfaction. Whether it was his eloquence that prevailed on our\r\nattendants, I know not, but it was determined to provide us with a\r\ncarriage the next day, at no extra expense. The day was perfect, and the\r\nluxury of an easy drive of four hours was very grateful to us after our\r\nuncomfortable ride in the Peloponnesus. We dined at Eleusis, and reached\r\nAthens early in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ADONIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Far dimly back in distant days of eld,\r\n              There lived a pretty boy, as parchments tell,\r\n              As formed for love and life in lonely dell,\r\n            With mien as fair as never eyes beheld;\r\n            Because who saw, to love him was compelled\r\n              Straightway, so wizardly he wielded Beauty's spell.\r\n\r\n            His name Adonis--sad of memory!\r\n              Whose life, though fair, his death was fairer still,\r\n              In dying for a cause, or good or ill;\r\n            For he heart-crazed the daughter of the sea,\r\n            Who loved him well, though wisely loved not she:\r\n              True hearts are never wise, as worldlings selfish will.\r\n\r\n            Him Venus loved--Love's cherished creatures they!\r\n              And Venus wooed with perseverance sore,\r\n              Till weary was the lad, the wooing o'er;\r\n            And while he, hiding in the forest lay,\r\n            O'ershaded from the sun's unfriendly ray,\r\n              Ah me! there came to kill a maddened, foaming boar!\r\n\r\n            Oh! see! from limbs too fair for touch of earth,\r\n              As tusk and tusk is savage through them drove,\r\n              While rain their dainty power 'fending strove,\r\n            The pure red liquid life all wasting forth!\r\n            All wasted, lost? Nay! thence, thence took its birth\r\n              ADONIUM, eternal bloom of martyred Love!\r\n\r\n            Love's martyr is a-bleeding now again;\r\n              Sweet Liberty, beloved of earth, doth bleed:\r\n              The maddened, foaming boar hath come indeed,\r\n            And tears our life on many a gory plain;\r\n            But we--as bled the boy--bleed not in vain:\r\n              Our blood-drops--our sons--will be Adonium seed!\r\n\r\n            Who die for Liberty--they never die!\r\n              Adonis, dead for Love, doth live anew!\r\n              They bloom blood-flowers in the tearful dew,\r\n            Forever falling on their memory!\r\n            In veins that are and veins that are not to be,\r\n              They ever coursing live, the right, the good, the true!\r\n\r\n            Where sinks the martyr's blood within the sod,\r\n              A spirit-plant of universal root,\r\n              Divinely radiant, doth upward shoot,\r\n            Appealing from a wicked world to God!\r\n            And seen for once, down drops the tyrant's rod;\r\n              For men at last have tasted of a heavenly fruit.\r\n\r\n            All good and beautiful of soul thus sprung\r\n              From blood, e'en as the Adonium I sing;\r\n              And where the blood is purest, thence doth spring\r\n            Such flowers as by heavenly bards are sung;\r\n            For since from Christ the fierce blood-sweat was wrung,\r\n              Have growths of nobler fruit on earth been ripening!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYTECHNIC INSTITUTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is positively no class of writers entitled to higher praise, or\r\nactuated by nobler motives, than those who are now distinguishing\r\nthemselves by their labors for Education. They have laid their hands on\r\nwhat is to be the great social motive power of the future--the great\r\nsubject of the politics of days to come--and are working bravely in the\r\nsacred cause.\r\n\r\nYet it can hardly be denied that amid the vast mass of every practical\r\nobservation and suggestion contained in the educational works with which\r\nwe are familiar, or even among the really _scientific_ contributors to\r\nit, there is very little founded on the great social wants and\r\ntendencies of the age. Education is, at present, merely an _art_; it has\r\na right, in common with every conceivable department of knowledge, to be\r\nraised to the rank of a _science_. This can only be done by putting it\r\non a progressive basis, and placing it in such a position as to aid in\r\nsupplying some great demand of the age.\r\n\r\nThe great fact of the time is, the advance from mere art upward to\r\nscience, from the blossom to the fruit. Practical wants, 'the greatest\r\ngood for the greatest number,' the fullest development of free labor,\r\nthe increase of capital, the diminution of suffering, the harmony of\r\ninterests between capital and labor--all of these are the children of\r\nScience and Facts. During the feudal age, nearly all the resources of\r\ngenius--all the capital of the day--was devoted to mere Art, for the\r\nsake of setting off social position and 'idealisms.' As with the\r\nnobility and royalty of England at the present day, society enormously\r\noverpaid what is, or was, really the police--whose mission it was to\r\nkeep it in order. But from Friar Bacon to Lord Bacon, a movement was\r\nsilently progressing, which the present century has just begun to\r\nrealize. This movement was that of the development of all human ability\r\nand natural resources, guided by science. It was a tendency toward the\r\npractical, the positive, which is destined in time to bring forth its\r\nown new art and literature, is breaking away from the trammels of the\r\nold literary or imaginative sway.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, up to the present hour, Education--especially the\r\nhigher education, destined to fit men for leading positions--is still\r\nunder the old literary regime. We laugh when we read of the two first\r\nyears of medical study at the school of Salerno being devoted to dry\r\nlogic, yet the four years' course at nearly all our modern Universities,\r\nor, in fact, the course of almost any 'high-school,' is as little\r\nadapted to the real wants of the practical leading men of this age as a\r\nstudy of the Schoolmen would be. The 'literature' of the past still\r\nrules the practical wants of the present. It is not that the study of\r\nthe thought of the past is not noble, nay, essential, to the highly\r\ncultivated man; but it should be pursued on a large, scientific scale.\r\nThe study of Greek and Latin, as languages, is not so disciplining nor\r\nso valuable as that of the science of language, as taught by Max\r\nMüller; and if these languages must be learned, (and we do not deny that\r\nthey should,) they can better be studied in their relations to all\r\nlanguages than simply by themselves. And as if to make bad worse, the\r\ngenial and strictly scientific use of literal translations, advocated by\r\nMilton and Locke, and generally employed at the Revival of Letters, and\r\nduring the days when Europe boasted its greatest classic scholars, is\r\nprohibited. 'A college education' suggests the employment of the best\r\nyears of life in studies of little practical use in themselves, and\r\nseldom revived, save for pleasure, after graduation. And even where such\r\nstudies are exceptionally practical; nay, where science and a free\r\nchoice of languages and literature are left to the somewhat advanced\r\nstudent, we still find the shadow of the past--of the old, formal, and\r\nrapidly growing obsolete literature--overawing the more enlightened\r\neffort. Deny it as we may, the University is still a feudal institution.\r\nWithin the memory of man, there existed in England positively no school\r\nwhere the would-be engineer or manufacturer could be fitted for his\r\ncareer and at the same time be 'well educated.' George Stephenson was\r\nobliged to send his son to an 'University,' where some scraps of\r\npractical science--scanty scraps they were--most insufficiently repaid\r\nthe expense of education.\r\n\r\nThe great want of the age is the Polytechnic School, or more correctly\r\nspeaking, of the Technological Institute, in which the labors of the\r\nSociety of Arts, aided by the Museum and Library, may serve the two-fold\r\nobject of informing the public on all matters of science and industry\r\nand of aiding the School of Industrial Science. Developed on its largest\r\nscale, such an institute should be devoted to the acquisition and\r\ndissemination of all knowledge, but under strictly scientific guidance\r\nand influences. Literature should there be taught historically, in close\r\nconnection with mental philosophy, a system which, it may be observed,\r\nresults in interesting the pupil more in details than the old plan\r\ndevoted to a few mere details ever did. Art should there be taught, not\r\nin rhapsodies over Raphael, Turner, and the favorite fancies of an\r\nindividual, but according to its unfoldings in human culture, based on\r\narchitecture as an illustrative medium. 'The lines of connection'\r\nbetween these and the exact sciences should be ever kept in sight, so\r\nthat the student may never forget 'the countless connecting threads\r\nwoven into one indissoluble texture, forming that ever-enlarging web\r\nwhich is the blended product of the world's scientific and industrial\r\nactivity.'\r\n\r\nThe great aim of such an institute should be the aiding of industrial\r\nprogress, and the application of generous, intelligent culture to\r\npractical pursuits--the whole to be based on exact science. When we look\r\ninto this community, and see the vast demand for talent in its\r\nmanufactures, and see how many thousands there are who would gladly be\r\n'liberally educated' men, if the education could only be allied to\r\npractically useful knowledge, we at once feel that the time has come for\r\nthe establishment of such institutes. The demand exists on every side;\r\nthe supply must come, and that speedily. England, France, and Germany\r\nare rapidly improving their manufactures by scientifically educating\r\ntheir master-workmen--the Conservatoire des Arts, and Ecole Centrale, of\r\nParis, the art-schools of the British capital and provinces, the many\r\nmuseums devoted to scientic collection, are all keeping up their\r\nfactories--shall we be behind them? Let Capital consult its interests,\r\nand answer.\r\n\r\nWe have been induced to put the query, from a perusal of two pamphlets,\r\nboth directly bearing on this subject. The first is the _Ninth Annual\r\nAnnouncement of the Polytechnic College of the State of Pennsylvania,\r\nSession_ 1861-1862, _and Catalogue of the Officers and Students_; while\r\nthe second sets forth the Objects and Plan of an Institute of\r\nTechnology, including a Society of Arts, a Museum of Arts, and a School\r\nof Industrial Science, proposed to be established in Boston.'[C] This\r\nlatter, it may be added, was prepared by direction of the Committee of\r\nAssociated Institutions of Science and Arts, and is addressed to\r\n'manufacturers, merchants, agriculturists, and other friends of\r\nenlightened industry in the commonwealth.'\r\n\r\nThe Polytechnic College of Philadelphia, now in its ninth year, is a\r\ntruly excellent institution, the practical results of which are shown in\r\nthe fact that its students, immediately on graduating, have generally\r\nreceived appointments as civil and mechanical engineers, or otherwise\r\nstepped at once into active and remunerative employment. Its object, as\r\nwe are told, is to afford to the young civil, mining, or mechanical\r\nengineer, chemist, architect, metallurgist, or student of applied\r\nscience, every facility whereby he may perfect himself in his destined\r\ncalling. It is, in fact, a collection of technical schools, or schools\r\nof instruction in the several departments of learned industry. It\r\ncomprises the school of mines, for professional training in\r\nmine-engineering, in the best methods of determining the value of\r\nmineral lands and of analyzing and manufacturing mine products. Also the\r\nschools of civil engineering, of practical chemistry, of mechanical\r\nengineering, architecture, general science, and agriculture. To these is\r\nadded a military department, now under superintendence of a former\r\ninstructor in West-Point, with the use of the State armory near the\r\ncollege, generously granted by the State, with a supply of arms. We are\r\nglad to say that in all these schools the instruction is thorough, not\r\nonly in theory but in actual _practice_. The course of the school of\r\nchemistry, for instance, comprehends the principles of the science and\r\ntheir actual application to agriculture, to the arts, and to analysis;\r\nto the examination and smelting of ores; to the alloying, refining, and\r\nworking of metals; to the arts of dyeing and pottery; to the starch,\r\nlime, and glass manufacture; to the preparation and durability of\r\nmortars and cements; to means of disinfecting, ventilating, heating, and\r\nlighting. Its students are also practiced in manipulations, testing in\r\nthe arts qualitative and quantitative; in analysis of minerals and\r\nsoils, and in many other important practical matters.\r\n\r\nThe students of geology and mining, of machinery and metallurgy, make,\r\nwith their professors, frequent visits to the many interesting\r\nlocalities in Pennsylvania or New-Jersey, to the many large\r\nmachine-shops with which Philadelphia abounds, visit mines and furnaces,\r\nand are in every way practically familiarized with their future\r\ncallings. Instruction in languages and literature, in drawing and in the\r\nelements of practical law is, we believe, given in common to all. It is\r\nthe first, we may say, _unavoidable_, characteristic of a _scientific_\r\nschool, that its work is always well done. Other schools may or may not\r\nbe specious contrivances, well or ill managed; but the very nature of\r\nscience is to _clear itself_ in whatever it touches, and be honest and\r\npractical. Its tendency is to classify and select, to cast away the\r\nobsolete and test and adopt the new and true. Such is by no means an\r\nexaggerated statement of the real condition of the excellent college to\r\nwhich we refer, which testifies, by its success, to the excellence of\r\nits plan and the competency of its teachers, especially to the\r\nadministrative ability of its worthy President, Dr. Alfred L. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied, that for many years, radicals have inveighed\r\nagainst 'Greek and Universities,' but it has been in a narrow, vulgar,\r\nand simply destructive manner, with no provision to substitute any\r\nthing better in their place. The growth of science, of the knowledge of\r\nhistory, of culture in every branch, has, however, of late, so vastly\r\nincreased, that the proposition to reform the old system of study is\r\nreally one not to tear it down, but to build it up, to extend it and\r\ndevelop it on a grand scale. Since, for example, the influence of\r\nscience has been felt in philology, how inconsiderable do the Bruncks\r\nand Porsons of the old school, appear before the Bopps, Schlegels,\r\nBurnoufs, and Müllers of the new! For as yet, even where here and there\r\nin colleges a liberal and enlightened method is partially attempted,\r\nstill the old monkish spirit appears, driving away with something like a\r\n'mystery' or 'guild' feeling the merely practical man, and interposing a\r\nmass of 'dead vocables,' which must be learned by years of labor,\r\nbetween him and the realization of an education. The young man who is to\r\nbe a miner, a cotton-spinner, an architect, or a merchant, may possibly\r\nfind here and there, at this or that college, lectures and instruction\r\nwhich may aid him directly in his future career, but he soon realizes\r\nthat the general tendency and tone of the college is entirely in favor\r\nof abstract studies quite useless out in the world, and apart from\r\npreparation for one of 'the three professions.' He himself is as a\r\n'marine' among the regular sailors, a surgeon among 'regular doctors,'\r\nor as a dentist among surgeons. And this in an age when we may say that\r\nwhat is not to be studied scientifically is not _worth_ studying. As our\r\nprincipal object in writing these remarks has been to assert that the\r\nPolytechnic Institute, in its either partial or entire form, should\r\nexist entirely independent of all other influences, we might be held\r\nexcused from any mention of such scientific schools as are attached to\r\nour Universities. That of Cambridge, Massachusetts, would, however,\r\ndeserve special mention, from the celebrity of its teachers. In this\r\ninstitute, which has between seventy and eighty students, we have a\r\nsingle school divided into the following departments: that of Chemistry,\r\nunder supervision of Professor Horseford, in which instruction is both\r\ntheoretical and practical; that of Zoölogy and Geology, in which the\r\nteaching consists alternately of a course of lectures by Professor\r\nAgassiz, on Zoology, embracing the fundamental principles of the\r\nclassification of animals as founded upon structure and embryonic\r\ndevelopment, and illustrating their natural affinities, habits,\r\ndistribution, and the relations which exist between the living and\r\nextinct races, and a course of geology, both theoretical and practical.\r\nTo this are added the departments of Engineering under Professor Eustis,\r\nthat of Botany, under Professor Gray, that of Comparative Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology, under Professor J. Wyman, that of Mathematics, under\r\nProfessor Peirce, and that of Mineralogy, under Professor Cooke. It is\r\nneedless to speak in praise of a school boasting men of such world-wide\r\nnames as teachers, or to commend it as affording facilities for\r\nbestowing a sound education. We do it no injustice, however, in\r\nasserting that its tendency is to develop students of abstract science\r\nand teachers, while the aim of the _Polytechnic_ school proper is, in\r\naddition to this, to supply the manufactures of the country with\r\n_working men_, and the country at large, including those already engaged\r\nin labor, with technological information of every kind. It should be a\r\nvast reservoir of practical knowledge, where the man of the\r\n'print-works,' in search of a certain dye or of a new form of machinery,\r\nmay apply, certain that all the latest discoveries will be found\r\nregistered there. It should be a place where capitalists may go as to an\r\nintelligence-office, confident of finding there the assistants which\r\nthey may need. It should be, in fact, in every respect, an institute\r\nsimply and solely for the people, and for the development of\r\n_manufacturing industry_. If, as we have urged, it should embrace\r\neventually thorough instruction in _every_ branch of knowledge, this\r\nshould be because experience shows that the most commonplace branches\r\nrequire the stimulus of genius, which can only be fairly developed by\r\nuniversal facilities. No young man, however practical, could have his\r\n_Thätigkeit_ or 'available energy' other than stimulated by even an\r\nextensive familiarity with every detail of philosophy, literature, and\r\nart, provided that these were properly _scienced_, or taught strictly\r\naccording to their historical development.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, needless to say that we welcome with pleasure the plan\r\nof An Institute of Technology, which it is proposed to establish in\r\nBoston, and which, to judge from its excellently well prepared\r\nprospectus, will fully meet, in every particular, all the requirements\r\nwhich we have laid down as essential to a perfect Polytechnic Institute.\r\nIndeed, the wide scope of this plan, its capacity for embracing every\r\nsubject in the range of science, and of communicating it to the public\r\neither by publication, by free lectures, by a museum of reference, or by\r\ncollegiate instruction, leaves but little to be desired. That there is\r\ngreat need of such an institution in this State is apparent from many\r\ncauses. In the words of the prospectus, we feel that in New-England, and\r\nespecially in our own Commonwealth, the time has arrived when, as we\r\nbelieve, the interests of Commerce and Arts, as well as General\r\nEducation, call for the most earnest cooperation of intelligent culture\r\nwith industrial pursuits. It is no exaggeration to state that probably\r\nno project was ever before presented to the wealthy men of Massachusetts\r\nwhich appealed so earnestly to their aid or gave such fair promise of\r\ndoing good. The institute in question is one which will in every\r\nrespect, socially and mentally, elevate the business man or practical\r\nman to a level with the college graduate or the practitioner in the\r\nthree learned professions. It will stimulate progress by still further\r\nrefining industry, and ally the action of capital to the advance of\r\nintellect. It will perform a noble and distinguished part in the great\r\nmission of the age and of future ages--that of vindicating the dignity\r\nof free labor and showing that the humblest work may be rendered\r\nhigh-toned and raised to a level with the calling of scholar or\r\ndiplomatist through the influence of science. If we were called on to\r\nset forth the noble spirit of the _North_ with all its free labor and\r\nall its glorious tendencies, we should, with whole heart and soul,\r\nchoose this magnificent conception of an institute whose aim is to\r\nconfer dignity on what the wretched and ignorant slaveocracy believe is\r\ncursed into everlasting vulgarity. It is fitting that this practical and\r\neminently intelligent and progressive community should build up, on a\r\ngrand scale, an institution which will be not only eminently useful and\r\nprofitable, but serve as a culminating exponent of the great and liberal\r\nideas for which the North has already made in every form the most\r\nremarkable sacrifices.\r\n\r\n     'While the vast and increasing magnitude of the industrial\r\n     interests of New-England furnishes a powerful incentive to the\r\n     establishment--within its borders of an institution devoted to\r\n     technological uses, it can not be doubted that the concentration of\r\n     these interests in so great a degree, in and around Boston, renders\r\n     the capital of the State an eligible site for such an undertaking.\r\n     Indeed, considering the peculiar genius of our busy population for\r\n     the Practical Arts, and marking their avidity in the study of\r\n     scientific facts and principles tending to explain or advance them,\r\n     we see a special and most striking fitness in the establishment of\r\n     such an Institution among them, and we gather a confident assurance\r\n     of its preëminent utility and success. Nor can we advert to the\r\n     intelligence which is so well known as guiding the large\r\n     munificence of our community, without taking encouragement in the\r\n     inception of the enterprise, and feeling the assurance, that\r\n     whatever is adapted to advance the industrial and educational\r\n     interests of the Commonwealth will receive from them the heartiest\r\n     sympathy and support.'\r\n\r\nAs we have stated, the plan proposed is to establish an Institution to\r\nbe devoted to the practical arts and sciences, to be called the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, having the triple organization of\r\na Society of Arts, a Museum or Conservatory of Arts, and a School of\r\nIndustrial Science and Art. Under the first of these three\r\ndivisions--that of the Society of Arts--the Institute of Technology\r\nwould form itself into a department of investigation and\r\npublication--devoting itself in every manner to collecting and rendering\r\nreadily available to the public all such information as can in any way\r\naid the interests of art and industry. If our manufacturers will reflect\r\nan instant on the vast amount of knowledge relative to their specialties\r\nextant in the world, which they have as individuals great difficulty in\r\nprocuring, and which would be useful, but which an Institute devoted to\r\nthe purpose could furnish without difficulty, they will at once\r\nappreciate the good which may be done by it. For many years the only\r\ncomprehensive summaries of American Manufactures were a German work by\r\nFleischmann, _On the Branches of American Industry_, to which was\r\nsubsequently added Whitworth and Wallis's Report--drawn up for the\r\nBritish government, and Freedley's Philadelphia Manufactures--to which\r\nwe should in justice add the invaluable series of Hunt's _Merchant's\r\nMagazine_, and the Patent Office Reports. The community needs more,\r\nhowever, than books can furnish. It requires the constant accumulation\r\nand dissemination of technological knowledge of every kind. It is\r\nproposed in the new Institute to effect this partly by publication and\r\nin a great measure by the labor of committees, devoted to the following\r\nsubjects:\r\n\r\n1. _Mineral Materials_--having charge of all relating to the mineral\r\nsubstances used in building and sculpture, ores, metals, coal, and in\r\nfact, all mineral substances employed in the useful arts, as well as\r\nwhat pertains to mining, quarrying, and smelting.\r\n\r\n2. _Organic Materials_--embracing whatever is practically interesting in\r\nall vegetable and animal substances used in manufacturing, having in\r\nview their sources, culture, collection, commercial importance and\r\nqualities as connected with manufacturing. This department presents a\r\nvast field of immense importance to every merchant and importer of raw\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n3. _On Tools and Instruments_--devoted to all the implements and\r\napparatus needed in all processes of manufacture.\r\n\r\n4. _On Machinery and Motive Powers._\r\n\r\n5. _On Textile Manufactures._\r\n\r\n6. _On Manufactures of Wood, Leather, Paper, India-Rubber, etc._\r\n\r\n7. _On Pottery, Glass, and Precious Metals._\r\n\r\n8. _On Chemical Products and Processes._\r\n\r\n9. _On Household Economy._ This department would embrace attention to\r\nwhatever relates to warming, illumination, water-supply, ventilation,\r\nand the preparation and preservation of food, as well as the protection\r\nof the public health.\r\n\r\n10. _On Engineering and Architecture._\r\n\r\n11. _On Commerce, Navigation, and Inland Transport._ This department\r\nalone, developed in detail, and on the scale proposed, would of itself\r\namply repay any amount of encouragement and investment. To collect and\r\nclassify for the use of the public all available information on the\r\nsubject of shipping, the improvement of harbors, the construction of\r\ndocks, the location and efficiency of railroads, and other channels of\r\ninland intercourse; 'keeping chiefly in view the economical questions of\r\ntrade and exchange, which give these works of mechanical and engineering\r\nskill their high commercial value,' is a project as grand as it is\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n12. _On the Graphic and Fine Arts._\r\n\r\nOf the importance of the proposed Museum of Industrial Science and Art,\r\nit is needless to speak. It would be for the public the central feature\r\nof the Institute, and of incalculable value not only to it, but to all\r\nengaged in all active industry whatever.\r\n\r\nAs regards the School of Industrial Science and Art, with its divisions,\r\nwe see no occasion for material cause of difference between its\r\nconstitution and that of the excellent Polytechnic College in\r\nPhiladelphia. New departments of instruction could be added as the means\r\nand power of the Institute increased, until it would ultimately form\r\nwhat the world needs but has never yet seen--a thoroughly _scientific_\r\nUniversity, in which every branch of human knowledge should be _clearly_\r\ntaught on a positive basis--a school where literature and art would be\r\nennobled and refined by elevation from mysticism, 'rhapsody,' and\r\nobscurity, to their true position as historical developments and indices\r\nof human progress. We are pleased to see that in the plan proposed,\r\nprovision would be made for two classes of persons--those who enter the\r\nschool with the view of a progressive scientific training in applied\r\nscience, and the far more numerous class who may be expected to resort\r\nto its lecture-rooms for such useful knowledge of scientific principles\r\nas they can acquire without continually devoted study, and in hours not\r\noccupied by active labor.\r\n\r\nThis whole plan, though in the highest degree practical, has, it will be\r\nobserved, 'no affinity with that instruction in mere _empirical routine_\r\nwhich has sometimes been vaunted as the proper education for the\r\nindustrial classes'--an absurd and shallow system which has been urged\r\nby quacks and dabblers in world-bettering, and which has been exhausted\r\nwithout avail in England--the system dear to single-sided Gradgrinds and\r\nilliterate men who grasp a twig here and there without knowing of the\r\nexistence of the trunk and roots. It lays down a perfectly scientific\r\nand universal basis, believing that the most insignificant industry, to\r\nbe perfectly understood and pursued, must proceed from a knowledge of\r\nthe great principles of science and of all truth.\r\n\r\nUnder the charge of Professor W.B. Rogers, Messrs. Charles H. Dalton,\r\nE.B. Bigelow, James M. Beebee, and other members of a committee\r\nembracing some of the most public-spirited men of Boston, this plan has\r\nbeen thus far matured, and now awaits the sympathy, aid, and counsel of\r\nthe friends of industrial art and general education throughout the\r\ncommunity. We have gladly set forth its objects and claims, trusting\r\nthat it may be fully successful here, and serve as an exemplar for the\r\nestablishment of similar institutions in every other State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY AND NOBILITY vs. DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew political convulsions have hitherto transpired, which have so much\r\npuzzled the world to get at the entire motives of the revolt, as the\r\npresent insurrection in this country. Were public opinion to be made up\r\nfrom the political literature of Great Britain, or its leading journals,\r\nvery little certainty would be arrived at as to the merits or demerits\r\nof the attempted revolution. The articles of De Bow's _Review_ smack\r\nlittle more of a secession origin than the late dissertations on\r\nAmerican politics appearing in the British periodicals. The statements\r\nof most of the leading English journals are quite in keeping. Any one\r\naccustomed to the 'ear-marks' of secession phraseology and declamation\r\nwould be at little loss to identify the Southern emissary in connection\r\nwith the periodicals and press of the British islands. Hence the\r\nhypocrisy and studied concealment of those hidden motives necessary to\r\nbe made apparent, in order to judge of the merits of secession.\r\n\r\nThe world has known that for thirty years past there has been a feverish\r\nand jealous discontent expressed in the cotton States. It had its first\r\nebullition in 1832, when South-Carolina assumed the right to nullify the\r\nrevenue laws of Congress. Since that time the North has continually been\r\naccused of an aggressive policy. Various extravagant pretenses have\r\nfrom time to time been raised up by the South, and urged as causes for\r\ndissolving the Union. They have always, until recently, been met by\r\nforbearance and compromise.\r\n\r\nThe extension and perpetuation of slavery has been prominent as the open\r\nmotive for Southern political activity; and equally prominent as one of\r\nthe motives for dismembering the Union. There has been another project,\r\nhowever, in connection with the attempted dissolution of the Union, of a\r\nmost alarming nature: that project was the intended prostration of the\r\ndemocratic principle in Southern politics. While a privileged order in\r\ngovernment was made the basis of political ambition by the aspirants or\r\nleading spirits, it was also to be made the means of perpetuating the\r\ninstitution of slavery. Whether these adjuncts, slavery perpetuation,\r\nand government through a privileged class, were twins of the same birth,\r\nis not very material; but whether they existed together as the joint\r\nmotive to overthrow the national jurisdiction, involves very deeply the\r\npresent and continuing questions in American politics.\r\n\r\nTo many gentlemen of intelligence and high standing in the South, the\r\nintended establishment of a different order of government, based on\r\nprivilege of class, has appeared to be the ruling motive. They have set\r\ndown the expressed apprehension as to the insecurity of slavery as a\r\nhypocritical pretext for revolution; believing that the more absorbing\r\nmotive was to establish an order of nobility, either with or without\r\nmonarchy. There is some plausibility for giving the ambitious motive the\r\ngreater prominence; but a more severe analysis of the whole question\r\nwill, it is believed, place slavery perpetuation in the foreground as\r\nthe origin of all other motives for the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIn classifying slaveholders, it is undoubtedly true that a small portion\r\nof them were Democrats in principle, and ardently attached to the\r\nNational Government--perhaps would have preferred the abolition of\r\nslavery to the subversion of its jurisdiction. Another class, composing\r\na majority, though distrusting the National Government, connected as it\r\nwas and must be with a voting power representing twenty-six or seven\r\nmillions of free labor, yet more distrusted the attempt at revolution.\r\nThis class saw more danger in the proposed revolt than from continuing\r\nin the Union. Another class were politically ambitious; had ventured\r\nupon the revilement of the Democratic principle; had become\r\nsecessionists _per se_, and were the instruments and plotters of the\r\ntreason. This was substantially the condition of public opinion among\r\nslaveholders at the time of the election of Mr. Lincoln to the\r\nPresidency. These three classes, embracing the slaveholders and their\r\nfamilies, composed about one million five hundred thousand of the white\r\npopulation of the South.\r\n\r\nOf the seven millions non-slaveholding population South, a small portion\r\nwas engaged in trade and commerce, and naturally inclined to oppose\r\nsecession; but timid in its apprehensions as to protection, was ready to\r\nacquiesce in the most extravagant opinions; in other words, like trade\r\nand commerce every where, too much disposed to make merchandise of its\r\npolitics. The balance of the non-slaveholding population, if we except a\r\nvenal pulpit and press, had not even a specious motive, pecuniary or\r\npolitical, moral or social, that should have drawn it into rebellion. It\r\nwas a part and portion of the great brother-hood of free labor, and could\r\nnot by any possibility raise up a plausible pretense of jealousy against\r\nits natural ally--free labor in the North.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the strength of a cause, we are obliged to take into\r\naccount the actually existing reasons in favor of its support. Delusion,\r\nfounded on a fictitious cause of complaint, is but a weak basis for\r\nrevolution. It may have an apparent strength to precipitate revolt, but\r\nhas no power of endurance. There is a reflection that comes through\r\ncalamity and suffering that rises superior to sophistry in the most\r\ncommon minds. If not already, this will soon be the case with the whole\r\nSouthern population. The slaveholder and the man of trade and commerce\r\nwho feared the tumult, and would have avoided it, will have seen their\r\napprehensions turned into the fulfillment of prophecy. The\r\nnon-slave-holding farmer, mechanic, or laborer, will be made to see\r\nclearly that his interest did not lie on the side of treason. The\r\npolitical adventurer who planned the conspiracy, is already brought to\r\nsee the fallacy of his dream. He may now consider the incongruous\r\nmaterials of Southern population. He may view that population in\r\nclasses. He may contemplate it through the medium of its natural motives\r\nof fidelity to the Government on the one hand, and of its artificial\r\ndelusion on the other. He may now go to the bottom of Southern society,\r\nand find in its conflicting elements the antagonistic motives that\r\nrender the plans of treason abortive. These will be sure to continue,\r\nand sure to strengthen on the side of fidelity to the National\r\nGovernment. When the South is made a solid, compact unit in political\r\nmotive, it will become so, disarmed of all purposes of treason.\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly asserted that the South was a political unit on\r\nthe question of the attempted revolution. This declaration has been\r\nreïterated by the Southern press, by travelers, and by all the\r\ninfluences connected with the rebellion. It is not now necessary to\r\ndelineate the _quasi_ military organization of the Knights of the Golden\r\nCircle, or their operations in cajoling and terrorizing the Southern\r\npopulation into acquiescence. Much unanimity through this process was\r\nmade to appear on the surface; but it is more palpable to the analytic\r\nmind acquainted with Southern society, that the very means employed to\r\nenforce acquiescence afforded also the evidence that there was a strong\r\nunder-current of aversion. Willing apostasy from allegiance to the Union\r\nneeded no terrorizing from mobs or murders. The ruffianism of the South\r\nhad been fully armed in advance of the full disclosure of the plot to\r\nsecede. Loyalty had been as carefully disarmed by the same active\r\ninfluences. It had nothing to oppose to arms but its unprotected\r\nsentiments. As soon as the law of force was invoked by the conspirators,\r\nthe day of reasoning was wholly past. Flight or conformity became the\r\ncondition precedent of safety, even for life. The bulk of the Southern\r\npopulation was as much conspired against as the Government at\r\nWashington; and force against the same population was rigorously called\r\ninto requisition to consummate what fraud and political crime had\r\nconcocted. This was the boasted unity of the South.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is often made: 'How was it possible to have inaugurated the\r\nrebellion, without the bulk of the slaveholders, at least, acting in\r\nconcert?' This inquiry is not easily answered, unless its solution is\r\nfound in the fact that slaveholders, through jealousy, had parted with\r\ntheir active loyalty to the National Government. This was generally the\r\ncase. Whilst the bulk of them hesitated for a little to take the fearful\r\nstep of revolt, their hesitation was more connected with apprehension of\r\nits consequences than with any attachment to the Government. The\r\ndeceptive idea of peaceable secession first drew them within the lines\r\nof the open traitor. The supposed probability of success made them\r\nallies in rebellion. As a general sentiment, they made their imaginary\r\nadieux to the Government of their fathers without apparent regret.\r\n\r\nThere has been much misapprehension as to the process of reasoning that\r\nbrought slaveholders in the main to repudiate their Government. They\r\nwere influenced by no apprehension of present danger to the institution\r\nof slavery. It was something far beyond the power of any party to\r\nstipulate against. Their apprehensions were connected with the laws of\r\npopulation and subsistence and the certain motive to political\r\naffiliation that underlies the platform of free-labor society. When\r\nindulging in the belief of peaceable secession, they expressed their\r\nsentiments truly in the declaration that 'they would not remain in the\r\nUnion, were a blank sheet of paper presented, and they permitted to\r\nwrite their own terms.' This declaration merely characterized the\r\nforegone conclusion. It was the evidence of a previous determination,\r\nmerely withheld for a season, in order to gain time.\r\n\r\nBut to come to a more definite delineation of the reasons that operated\r\nto raise up the conspiracy. There was a partial feud that had long\r\nexisted in the mutual jealousies between the slaveholders and\r\nnon-slaveholding population. Nothing very remarkable, however, had\r\ntranspired to indicate an outbreak. Southern white labor was continually\r\nannoyed with the appellation of 'white trash,' and other contemptuous\r\nepithets; but still was obliged to toil on under the continuous insult.\r\nThe habits and usages of slaveholders and their families, indicated by\r\nmanners toward white labor, that white labor did not command their\r\nrespect. Too many of the accidental droppings of foolish and stupid\r\narrogance were let fall within the hearing of white labor to make it\r\nfully reconciled to the pretended monopoly of respectability by\r\nslaveholders. Under this corroded feeling, much of the white labor of\r\nthe South had emigrated to the free States. In 1850, seven hundred and\r\nthirty-two thousand of these emigrants were living. Their communications\r\nand intercourse showed to their old friends, relatives, and\r\nacquaintances, that they had found homes and friendly treatment on\r\nNorthern soil; and in addition thereto, a much better and more\r\nencouraging condition of society for the industrious white man. The\r\nfeeling reflected back from the free to the slave States was analogous\r\nto that thrown back from the United States to Ireland. Its effect was\r\nalso the same. Under its influence, nearly two millions are now living\r\nin the free States, who are the offshoot and increase of a Southern\r\nextraction. Slaveholders merely complained of this flow of population,\r\non the ground that it contributed to overthrow the balance of political\r\npower. It would not, perhaps, be amiss to conclude that they saw with\r\nequal clearness the incentives that induced the emigration--a silent\r\nlogic of facts against slavery.\r\n\r\nThe census statistics, commencing with 1840, have contributed much to\r\nplay the mischief with the equanimity of slaveholders. They have always\r\nknown that thorough education in the South was mainly confined to their\r\nown families. When, however, the discovery was made public that only one\r\nin seven of the aggregate white population of the South was receiving\r\ninstruction during the year, the disclosure became alarming.[D] It stood\r\nlittle better than the educational progress of the British Islands,\r\nwhich had crept up, under the fight with Toryism, to the alarming\r\nextent of one in eight. That one in four and a half of the aggregate\r\npopulation of the free States was receiving school instruction, made the\r\ncontrast unpleasant to the mind of the slaveholder. He knew that the\r\nfact was 'world--wide,' that slaveholders had always controlled the\r\npolicy of Southern legislation. He was aware that slaveholders had made\r\nthemselves responsible for this neglect of the children of the South;\r\nand knew also that public opinion would visit the blame where it\r\nlegitimately belonged. Pro-slavery sagacity was quick-sighted in its\r\napprehensions that it could not dodge the inquiry, 'Whence comes this\r\ndisparity?'\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the two sections presented a still more obnoxious\r\ncomparison to the pro-slavery sensibilities, as it respects the physical\r\ncondition of the respective populations. The cotton States have mostly\r\nbeen the advocates of '_free trade_,' some of them tenaciously so. They\r\ndeemed it impossible to introduce manufacturing, to much extent, into\r\nsections where the yearly surpluses in production were wholly absorbed\r\nby investment in land and negroes. The consequence has been, want of\r\ndiversified industry and want of profitable occupation for the poorer\r\nclasses. In the Northern and in some of the Border States, a different\r\nindustrial policy has been pursued. Diversified occupation has raised up\r\nskilled labor in nearly every branch of industry. Notwithstanding the\r\ngreater rigor of climate, adult labor on the average, under full and\r\ncompensated employment, performs nearly three hundred solid days' work\r\nin the year. The eight millions of white population in the South, in\r\nconsequence of this want of profitable occupation, perform much less,\r\nperhaps not one hundred and fifty days' work on the average. The\r\nfollowing table, published in 1856-1857, by Mr. Guthrie, then Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, discloses a condition of things very remarkable; but no\r\nwise astonishing to those who have investigated the causes of the\r\ndisparity. The ratio of annual _per capita_ production to each man,\r\nwoman, and child, white and black, in the respective States, exclusive\r\nof the gains or earnings of commerce, stood as follows:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nMassachusetts, $166 60  | Indiana,              $69 12\r\nRhode-Island,   164 61  | Wisconsin,             63 41\r\nConnecticut,    156 05  | Mississippi,           67 50\r\nCalifornia,     149 60  | Iowa,                  65 47\r\nNew-Jersey,     120 82  | Louisiana,             65 30\r\nNew-Hampshire,  117 17  | Tennessee,             63 10\r\nNew-York,       112 00  | Georgia,               61 45\r\nPennsylvania,    99 80  | Virginia,              59 42\r\nVermont,         96 62  | South-Carolina,        56 91\r\nIllinois,        89 94  | Alabama,               55 72\r\nMissouri,        88 66  | Florida                54 77\r\nDelaware,        85 27  | Arkansas,              52 04\r\nMaryland,        83 85  | District of Columbia,  52 00\r\nOhio,            75 82  |\r\nMichigan,        72 64  | Texas,                 51 13\r\nKentucky,        71 82  | North-Carolina,        49 38\r\nMaine,           71 11  |\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is seen by this table that the income, or product of the\r\nnon-slaveholding population South, mainly disconnected as it is with\r\nmechanical industry, is reduced to the extreme level of bare\r\nsubsistence, while the population of the States which have introduced\r\ndiversified industry stand on a high scale of production. Contrast\r\nMassachusetts and South-Carolina, the two leading States in the\r\npromulgation of opposite theories. These two States have often been\r\ncensured for the contumelious manner in which they have sometimes sought\r\nto repel each other's arguments. The one is in favor of 'free trade.'\r\nThe other says: 'No State can flourish to much extent without\r\ndiversified industry.' The one says: 'Open every thing to free\r\ncompetition.' The other replies: 'Are you aware that the interest on\r\nmanufacturing capital in Europe is much lower; that skilled labor there\r\nis more abundant; and that it would dash to the ground most of the\r\nmanufacturing we have started into growth under protection through our\r\nrevenue laws?' 'Let it be so,' says Carolina; 'what right exists to\r\nadopt a national policy that does not equally benefit all sections?'\r\n'The very object of the policy,' replies Massachusetts, 'is, that it\r\n_should_ benefit all sections; and the most desirable object of all, in\r\nthe eye of beneficence, would be, that it _should_ benefit the laboring\r\nwhite population of the cotton States, as well as others.' 'But,' says\r\nCarolina, 'this diversified industry can not be introduced, to much\r\nextent, where slavery exists.' 'That is an argument by implication,'\r\nsays Massachusetts, 'that you more prize slavery than you do the\r\ninterests and welfare of the bulk of your white population.' 'Who set\r\nyou up to be a judge on the question of the welfare of any part of the\r\npopulation South?' says Carolina. 'I assume to judge for myself,'\r\nreplies Massachusetts, 'as to that national policy which is designed to\r\naffect beneficially the twenty-seven millions of people who are obliged\r\nto obtain subsistence through personal industry; theirs is the great\r\ncause of white humanity in its shirt-sleeves; and it behooves the\r\nNational Government to take care of that cause, and to foster it; and\r\nnot to submit to the narrow selfishness of a few slaveholders.'\r\n\r\nIt may readily be seen that this controversy, growing out of the\r\nopposite theories of selfish slaveholders on the one hand, and a spirit\r\nof beneficence, blended with the idea of a wide-spread advantage on the\r\nother, not only involves directly the demerits of slavery, in its\r\nprejudicial effect on the non-slaveholding population South, but also\r\nthe great question of raising up skilled labor in all the States. It is\r\nthus clearly demonstrated that our national policy should be exempt from\r\nthe control of an arrogant and selfish class. Slaveholders have had\r\nlittle sympathy with the great bulk of the white people in the Union; at\r\nmost, they have never manifested it. Few of them can be trusted\r\npolitically, where a broad industrial policy is concerned. No one is\r\nbetter aware than the political slaveholder of the crushing effect of\r\nslavery on the interests of the non-slaveholding population in the slave\r\nStates: hence their jealousy of this population as a voting, governing\r\npower. The Southern political mind, connected with slaveholding, is\r\nastute when sharpened by jealousy. There is no phase in political\r\neconomy, bearing on the disparity of classes in the South, that has not\r\nbeen taken into the account and analyzed. The fear with slaveholders has\r\nbeen, that the great majority, composed of the white laboring population\r\nSouth, would become able to subject matters to the same scrutinizing\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to convince the American people that slavery is\r\nnot 'the skeleton in their closet.' Any one who has encountered for\r\nyears the pro-slavery spirit; who has watched it through its\r\nunscrupulous deviations from rectitude, morally, socially, and\r\npolitically, will have been dull of comprehension not to have\r\nappreciated its atrocious disposition. Its great instrumentality in the\r\nmanagement of Southern masses, consists not only of a disregard, but of\r\na positive interdict of the principles of civil liberty, in all matters\r\nwherein the prejudicial effects of slavery might directly, or by\r\nimplication, be disclosed. It is true, people are permitted to adulate\r\nslavery--so they are allowed to adulate kings, where kings reign. No one\r\nin recent years has been allowed the open expression of opinion or\r\nargument as to the bad effect of a pro-slavery policy on the great\r\nmajority of Southern white population. This would bring the offender\r\nwithin the Southern definition of an 'incendiary,' and the offense would\r\nbe heinous. The pro-slavery spirit has always demanded sycophancy where\r\nits strength was great enough to enforce it, and has ever been ready to\r\ninvoke the law of force where its theories were contradicted. Even the\r\nfundamental law of the South, contained in Southern State Constitutions\r\nin favor of the 'freedom of speech, and freedom of the press,' is mere\r\nrhetorical flourish, where slavery is concerned. It means that you must\r\nadulate slavery if you speak of it; and woe to the man that gives this\r\nfundamental law any broader interpretation. In its amiable moods, the\r\npro-slavery spirit is often made to appear the gentleman. In its angry,\r\njealous moods, it is both a ruffian and an assassin. Mr. Sumner, of the\r\nSenate, once sat for its picture--twice in his turn he drew it--each\r\nportrait was a faithful resemblance.\r\n\r\nHad we been exempt from slavery and its influences, it is difficult to\r\nconceive what possible pretense could have been raised up for\r\nrevolution. What position could have been taken showing the necessity of\r\ndisenthrallment from oppressive government? There would have existed no\r\nelement of political discontent that could by any possibility have\r\nculminated in rebellion, aside from the active, jealous, and\r\nunscrupulous influence of slaveholders. Rebellion and treason required\r\nthe lead and direction of an ambitious and reckless class; a class\r\nactuated by gross and selfish passions, in disconnection with sympathy\r\nfor the masses. It required a class stripped and bereft by habits of\r\nthinking of the spirit of political beneficence, devoid of national\r\nhonor, national pride, and national fidelity. Nothing less unscrupulous\r\nwould have answered to plot, to carry forward, and to manage the\r\nincidents of the attempted dismemberment of the Union. It required\r\nsomething worse in its nature than Benedict Arnold susceptibility. His\r\nmight have been crime, springing from sudden resentment or imaginary\r\nwrong. The other is the result of thirty years' concoction under adroit,\r\nhypocritical, and unscrupulous leaders. The slaveholders' rebellion has\r\nassumed a magnitude commensurate only with long contemplation of the\r\nsubject. Making all due allowance for the honorable exceptions, this is\r\nsubstantially the phase of pro-slavery infidelity to the Union.\r\n\r\nWere further argument needed to establish this position, it is found in\r\nthe fact that the seeds of rebellion are wanting in proportion to the\r\nabsence of slavery. There is no reason to believe that Kentucky or\r\nMaryland, without slavery, would have been less loyal than Ohio. In\r\nEastern Kentucky, Western Virginia, Eastern Tennessee, Western\r\nNorth-Carolina, a small portion of Georgia, and Northern Alabama, the\r\nUnion cause finds a friend's country. These sections, in the main,\r\ncontain a population dependent upon its own labor for subsistence.\r\nSchooled by diligent industry to habits of perseverance, and learning\r\nindependence and manhood by relying on itself, it has preserved its\r\npatriotism and attachment to the Government under which it was born. It\r\nsaw no cause of complaint, imaginary or real. Six or seven per cent of\r\nslave population has not proved sufficient as a slave interest, to\r\nprostrate or corrupt its national fidelity, nor to undermine its\r\nnational pride. It still retains its representation in Congress against\r\nthe influences of surrounding treason. There is a cheering satisfaction\r\nin the belief that this plateau of civil liberty and freedom, even\r\nunassisted, could not have been permanently held in subjection by the\r\nmyrmidons of rebellion. The secessionists themselves bestow a high\r\ncompliment to the patriotism of this people, when they complain of its\r\n'idolatrous attachment to the old Government.'\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the American people, from necessity, must analyze\r\nto their root the whole aptitudes and incidents of slavery. They are now\r\nobliged to deal with it, unbridled by the check-rein of its apologists.\r\nUnder the best behavior of slaveholders, the institution could not rise\r\nabove the point of bare toleration. There is so much inherent in the\r\nsystem that will not bear analysis, so much of collateral mischief, so\r\nmuch tending to overturn and discourage the principles of justice that\r\nought to be interwoven into the relationships of society, that it is\r\nimpossible for the ingenuous mind to advocate slavery _per se_. It is\r\nnot, however, to the bare dominion itself, that the objection is\r\nexclusively raised up. It is the inevitable result of that dominion, in\r\nconnection with the worst cultivated passions of human nature, that the\r\nexception is more broadly taken. The dominion of the master over the\r\nslave involves in a great measure the necessary dominion over the\r\npersons and interests of the balance of society where it exists. The\r\nlust of power on the part of slaveholders, and on the part of the\r\nprivileged classes in Europe, in nature, is the same. The determination\r\nthrough the artificial arrangements of power, to subsist on the toil of\r\nothers, is the same. The arrogant assumption of the right to maintain as\r\nprivilege what originated in atrocious wrong, is the same. The\r\ndisposition to crush by force any attempt to vindicate natural rights,\r\nor to modify the status of society under the severity of oppression, is\r\nthe same; and no tyranny has yet been found so tenacious or\r\nobjectionable as the tyranny of a class held together by the 'bond of\r\niniquity.' Our forefathers had a just conception of the nature of the\r\ncase, on one hand, when they interdicted by fundamental law the\r\nestablishment of any order of nobility. Many of them were sorely\r\ndistressed at the contemplation of slavery on the other hand, in\r\nconnection with its probable results upon the national welfare. Our\r\ncalamity is but the fulfillment of their prophecies. They well knew the\r\nnature of the evil we have to deal with.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of astonishment to most minds that slaveholders should have\r\ncontemplated the bold venture of subordinating the Democratic principle\r\nin government. It will be less astonishing, however, when it is duly\r\nconsidered that it is utterly impossible for Democracy and Slavery to\r\nabide long together. The one or the other must ere long have been\r\nprostrated under the laws of population, and it is not very likely that\r\nthe twenty-seven millions and their increase would consent to be\r\nsubordinated to the policy of three hundred and fifty thousand\r\nslaveholders. Slavery must exist as the ruling political power, or it\r\ncan not long exist at all. This the slaveholders well knew; hence the\r\nnecessity of fortifying itself through some political arrangement\r\nagainst the Democratic power of the masses.\r\n\r\nThe South-Carolina platform for a new government had close resemblance\r\nto the ancient Roman--a patrician order of nobility, founded on the\r\ninterested motive to uphold slavery; but allowing plebeian\r\nrepresentation, to some extent, to the non-slaveholding classes. Others\r\nin the South had preference for constitutional monarchy, with a class of\r\nprivileged legislators, and House of Commons, composing a government of\r\nchecks and balances, analogous to the English government. Whatever the\r\nplan adopted, the leading idea was to institute a government that should\r\nbe impervious, through one branch, to the future influence of the\r\nnon-slaveholding majority.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to make entirely clear the ambitious motives and mixed\r\napprehensions that have combined to precipitate the Southern\r\nslaveholders into rebellion. The defectiveness of the educational system\r\nof the South, and the known responsibility of slaveholders for such\r\ndefect and its consequences; the defect in the industrial policy, and\r\nthe responsibility of slavery itself for the depressing consequences to\r\nthe non-slaveholding population, were fearful charges. A knowledge that\r\nthe causes of depression must soon be brought to the examination of\r\nSouthern masses, in contrast with a better state of things in the North,\r\nfilled the minds of slaveholders with jealous and fearful apprehensions\r\ntoward the non-slaveholding population. They knew that its interests\r\nwere identified with the Northern educational and industrial policy.\r\nThey appreciated fully that through these interests, free labor in the\r\nSouth had every motive to affinity with the North, educationally,\r\npolitically, and industrially. They were astute in the discovery that\r\nunder the operation of the Democratic principle, free discussion, and\r\nfair play of reason, the pro-slavery prestige must soon go down in the\r\nSouth before the greater numerical force of Southern masses. It was,\r\ntherefore, not only necessary, as supposed, to overturn the power of the\r\nmasses in the South, but also to make them the instruments of their own\r\noverthrow as to political power.\r\n\r\nThe measurable acquiescence of the non-slaveholding population was\r\nindispensable to the revolutionary project. Without it, there was but\r\nlittle numerical force. It was, therefore, of entire consequence to make\r\nthis population hate the North--to hate the National Government, and to\r\ntrain it for the purposes of rebellion. The press was suborned wherever\r\nit could be. The pulpit manifested equal alacrity, in order to keep pace\r\nwith the workings of the virus of treason. Leading men, assuming to be\r\nstatesmen and political economists, taxed their ingenuity in the\r\ninvention of falsehood. The effort of the press and politicians was\r\ndirected to misrepresenting and disparaging the condition of free labor\r\nin the North; whilst the Southern pulpit was religiously engaged in\r\nestablishing the divinity of slavery. It would require a volume to\r\ndelineate the arts and hypocrisy resorted to, and the false reasoning\r\nemployed, to impose upon the masses of white labor South, and to make\r\nthem contented with their disparaged condition. It is needless to say,\r\nthe work of imposition was too effectually accomplished. It must be\r\nconfessed that too much of the non-slaveholding population had been\r\ninduced to follow the political Iagos of the South, and thus to assist\r\nthe first act in the plan for its own subversion--separation from the\r\nNorth. The next step in the plan of subversion, the 'abrogation of a\r\ngovernment of majorities,' was carefully kept from the public view.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry naturally arises, as to how or why this design for the\r\narrangement of political power in the Southern Confederacy has been\r\nconfined within such narrow degrees of disclosure. The answer is plain.\r\nA bold proposition to change the principles of their government would\r\nhave alarmed the people of the South into an intensified opposition. The\r\npoliticians of South-Carolina, more open and frank in the exposition of\r\ntheir views than other leaders in the South, have been obliged to submit\r\nthe control of their discretion to the more crafty and subtle influences\r\nof other States. Policy required that the contemplated new form of\r\ngovernment should be confined to the knowledge of the leading spirits\r\nonly. It would not bear the hazards of submission to the people as a\r\nbasis of revolution. Its success depended upon secresy and coupling the\r\nadoption of the plan with a sudden _denouement_ after revolution. Any\r\none conversant with the pages of De Bow's _Review_ for the last ten\r\nyears, and who has watched the drift of argument in reviling the masses,\r\nand contemning their connection with government; and accustomed also to\r\nthe 'accidental droppings' from secessionists in their cups, has had\r\nlittle difficulty in determining the ultimatum in the designs of\r\ntreason. He will have become convinced that it is nothing less than a\r\nwarfare against the continuation of Democratic government in the\r\nSouth--that this warfare is stimulated by the fixed belief that a\r\ngovernment of majorities must be superseded, in order to perpetuate the\r\ninstitution of slavery.\r\n\r\nWere argument wanting to force this conclusion on the mind, it would be\r\nsupplied in the established affinity between the emissaries of secession\r\nin Europe and the virulent haters of Democratic government there found.\r\nThe liberalists of England and elsewhere have been sedulously avoided;\r\nnot so those who would connive to bring Democratic government into\r\ndisrepute. With these last-mentioned classes, the secessionists have met\r\nwith a ready sympathy and encouragement, almost as much so, as if\r\ntreason in America involved directly the stability of privileged power\r\non that continent. The Tories of England, the Legitimists of France, the\r\nnauseous ingredients of the House of Hapsburg, the degenerate nobility\r\nof Spain, and from that down to the 'German Prince of a five-acre\r\npatch,' have been the congenial allies of secession emissaries in\r\nEurope. It mattered not to these haters of enfranchised masses how much\r\nmisery might be inflicted on the American people. They cared little for\r\nthe anguish of mind that was being every where felt by the supporters of\r\nliberalized opinions. They rejoiced at the supposed calamities of that\r\ngovernment whose beneficent policy had always been to keep the peace, to\r\navoid the necessity of standing armies, to foster industry and\r\neducation, and in addition thereto, to encourage the depressed of Europe\r\nto come and accept homes and hospitable treatment on the soil of the\r\ncountry. These revilers of Democracy in Europe were long advised with,\r\nwere consulted beforehand, and knew the plottings of the pro-slavery\r\nspirit, in its preparation for rebellion. They were indifferent as to\r\nthe character or hateful deformity of the agency to be employed,\r\nprovided it could be made instrumental in breaking the jurisdiction of a\r\ngovernment, heretofore more esteemed by the enlightened liberalists of\r\nthe world than any other that ever existed. Neither the secessionists\r\nnor their co-plotters in Europe required seducing or proselyting. They\r\nstood on the same level of affinity, the moment the secessionists\r\nproposed the overthrow of the Democratic principle. This was the\r\npromise, the condition precedent, and this the basis of alliance between\r\nthe plotters of treason in free America and their coädjutors abroad. It\r\nwould be both shallow and useless to charge the origin of sympathy with\r\nrebellion projects, expressed by political circles in Europe, to the\r\nmercenary motives of commerce, trade, or manufactures. Those were\r\nstanding on a broad foundation of contented reciprocity, and were the\r\nfirst to dread the tumult that could not fail to prove prejudicial. We\r\nshall hunt in vain to find the motive for European sympathy in\r\nrebellion, elsewhere than in hatred of Democracy. We shall also search\r\nin vain to find the motive for the wide-spread sympathy expressed by the\r\nliberalists of Europe in the Union cause, elsewhere than in their\r\nattachment to liberalized institutions.\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the compound motive for establishing the Southern\r\nConfederacy, that is, slavery perpetuation through prostration of the\r\nDemocratic principle, it may not be amiss to refer to the contemplated\r\nmanagement of its _politico-economic_ interests. These were to be built\r\nup, of course; but not through a system of diversified industry; for\r\nfree trade, as is well known, would have the effect to prostrate what\r\nlittle manufacturing had been commenced in the South, and afford a\r\nperpetual bar to the success of future undertakings. It was believed\r\nthat the foul elements North and South, and the illicit traders of the\r\nworld beside, could be brought together in the business of free trade\r\nand smuggling. The immense frontier would render it impossible for the\r\nNorthern States to protect themselves to much extent from illicit trade,\r\nthrough any preventive service possible to be adopted. The Mexican\r\nfrontier would be entirely helpless. Thus reasoned _Secesh_. This was to\r\nhave been the basis of competition with Northern mechanism. The\r\nreasonings of the conspirators were consistent with the merits and\r\nmorals of the conspiracy. They calculated upon the active coöperation of\r\nthe mercenary in the North, and actually believed that the temptation to\r\ngain would prove predominant over any efforts the Northern Government\r\ncould make to protect its revenue policy. They boldly ventured upon the\r\nassumption that the influences of illicit traffic would soon become too\r\nstrong to be resisted, and that in this manner, in conjunction with the\r\nagency of 'King Cotton,' the commerce of the North would be transferred\r\nto the South.\r\n\r\nAnother item in Southern political economy was the project of reöpening\r\nthe African slave-trade. The leaders of the secession programme had made\r\nthis a prominent feature in starting the rebellion into growth. The\r\nvarious phases which this branch of the question afterward underwent,\r\nwas owing to the opposition of the Border States. So much were the\r\npeople of the Border States averse to being brought into competition\r\nwith slave-breeding in Dahomey, that the original conspirators were\r\nobliged to forego, for a time at least, this incident in the motives of\r\nthe earlier revolutionists.\r\n\r\nA government founded on the supremacy of a class, and that class to be\r\ncomposed of slaveholders; a political economy founded on slave labor,\r\nfree trade, illicit trade, and African kidnapping, were associations\r\nthat would require great strength and influence to sustain them. The\r\nstrongest military organization was therefore contemplated. In this,\r\nmuch employment could be given to the non-slaveholding masses, while\r\nmilitary qualities of supposed superiority would enable the Southern\r\nConfederacy to enter into a successful contest with the North for\r\nempire. The potency of 'King Cotton' was to be made the powerful agency\r\nwith which the rest of the civilized world was to be dragooned into\r\nacquiescence. On this delusive dream was built the fabric of that mighty\r\nempire, whose history, from its origin to its subversion, is nearly\r\nready to be written.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the leading influences of the rebellion\r\nwere as sharp-sighted as political vice, or political immorality is ever\r\ncapable of becoming. Like all other vice, however, it based its\r\nreasonings and supposititious strength exclusively on its powers of\r\ndeception, in conjunction with the iniquitous aptitudes of itself and\r\nits coadjutors. It found co-plotters in Mozart Hall, in the stockholders\r\nof the African Slave-trade Association, scattered from Maine to Texas,\r\nand in its suborned press in New-York, Baltimore, Charleston, and\r\nNew-Orleans. It had bargained with the politically vitiated portion of\r\nthe Northern Democracy for assistance, and had received a wicked though\r\nfallacious assurance from the Northern kidnappers, to the effect, that\r\nthe Democracy of the North would neutralize any attempt to oppose\r\nsecession by force. They had arranged for their diplomatic influence on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and bargained for the subversion of\r\nDemocracy in the South. It planned beforehand for arming treason and\r\ndisarming the Union, and most adroitly were its plans in this respect\r\ncarried into effect. It had gained over to its side most of the Southern\r\nmaterial in the little army and navy of the country, and prepared it for\r\nperfidy, in committing devastation or theft on the public property. Thus\r\nallied and thus equipped, in the confidence of its pernicious strength,\r\nit commenced its warfare on society.\r\n\r\n'How much injury can we inflict upon the North? How much of the debts\r\nowing to Northern citizens can we confiscate? How much property in the\r\nSouth owned by Northern men can we appropriate? How much can we make\r\nNorthern commerce suffer by depression of business, privateering, or\r\notherwise? To what extent can we paralyze Northern mechanical industry,\r\nsubvert Northern trade, and lay it under disabilities? How much can we\r\ndistress the laboring classes in England, in France, in other countries\r\nin Europe, whereby we may compel them to clamor for the intervention of\r\ntheir respective governments against the North, and against its attempts\r\nto uphold the Union?' The whole reasoning of the conspirators was based\r\non the supposed power, coupled with the intent and effort to inflict\r\nwide-spread and common injury. The scheme and all its contemplated and\r\nattempted incidents of management were such as the pro-slavery spirit in\r\npolitics only could engender.\r\n\r\nIt required many years of gradual development, in connection with the\r\nultimate culmination of treason, to shake the confidence of the North in\r\nthe disposition of the people of the South. There was, and could be, no\r\npossible intelligent motive for the masses of the South to change their\r\nform of government, or to enter into rebellion against it. The arguments\r\nof the plotters of treason against a 'government of majorities'--the\r\ndoctrine of 'State rights,' with the right to secede at the option of a\r\nState--the _quasi_ repudiation of the 'white trash,' so called, as an\r\nelement of political equality, were regarded as the ebullitions of a\r\npolitically vitiated class who would be willing to overthrow the\r\nNational Government, but who were supposed to be too few in numbers to\r\ntaint with poisonous fatality the political mind of the South. It is not\r\nestablished as yet that the Southern political mind in the main has\r\nbecome depraved. It is, however, established, that the leading political\r\ninfluences South have cajoled and terrorized the bulk of the Southern\r\npopulation into apparent acquiescence in treason. It yet remains to be\r\nseen what disposition will be disclosed by the Southern people, as soon\r\nas protection is guaranteed to them against the tyranny and usurpations\r\nof the rebel influence. It is prophesied that there will be found a\r\nheart in the bulk of the Southern population; that it will still cling\r\nwith affection and pride to that government which was their guarantee,\r\nand which no power now on earth is competent to shake. It is not against\r\nthe deluded, the timid, or the helpless of the South that we would make\r\nthe indictment for political crime. It is the perfidious pro-slavery\r\nspirit in politics that we seek to arraign.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of developed motives in which the slaveholders' rebellion\r\nhad its origin, must naturally excite the inquiry in the American mind,\r\nas to how far the slaveholding element can be trusted. As a political\r\nforce, we find it sowing the seeds of political discontent. As an\r\nanti-democratic element, we find it plotting the overthrow of democratic\r\ngovernment. In its efforts to denationalize republican government in\r\nAmerica, it has not scrupled to seek aid from, and alliance with, the\r\nhaters of republican institutions every where. Under such calamitous\r\nteachings as it has inflicted, can we longer conclude that it can, from\r\nits aptitudes and nature, be converted into an element of national\r\nstrength? There is a South, and a great South, and would continue to be,\r\nwere there not a negro or slaveholder sojourning there. The seven\r\nmillions non-slaveholding population in the Southern States have rights,\r\nsocial and political, based on the motive to maintain republican\r\ngovernment. The Constitution of the Union, as the highest principle of\r\nfundamental law, guarantees in express terms, to every State, the form\r\nof a republican government; and not less by implication, the essential\r\nqualities of an actual one. It matters not how much the non-slaveholding\r\npopulation of the South may have been deluded, nor how much it may have\r\nbeen incited, under that delusion, to act as the instrument of its own\r\noverthrow. This population is not less the object of just political\r\nsolicitude than any equal number of people North. That its general\r\neducation has not been advanced to the appreciative point, is its\r\nmisfortune. That it has been surrounded by a pro-slavery influence,\r\nselfish, arrogant, and contemptuous of the interest of the masses, is\r\nequally so. That it has been less favored than its brother-hood of free\r\nlabor in the North--that it has been placed under disabilities in the\r\ncomparison, are only additional reasons for increased solicitude for the\r\nwelfare and future advancement of this portion of Southern population.\r\nWhile it has been imposed upon, and much of it deluded in its motives to\r\naction, its actual condition is in reality coupled with every natural\r\nincentive to alliance and adhesion to the National Government. It has\r\ndrunk the bitter cup of calamity in rebellion. It has tasted the dregs\r\nof treason that lie at the bottom of political vice, and been victimized\r\nby destitution, by the diseases of camp-life, by the casualties of the\r\nbattle-field, and by the widowhood and orphanage that have followed the\r\ntrain of rebellion. This population is a natural element of national\r\nstrength, having the same incentives as its brotherhood in the North.\r\nArms will soon remove the blockade to its intercourse with the North,\r\nand civil liberty once established, will most likely secure it to the\r\nside of national patriotism.\r\n\r\nThere is a question of equal magnitude respecting the colored\r\npopulation, not only of the South, but of the whole country. It is\r\ninvolved in the inquiry: Can the colored population be converted into an\r\nelement of national strength? Physiologically and mentally, the native\r\nnegro race stands as the middle-man in the five races--the Caucasian and\r\nMalay being above, and the American aborigines and the Alforian below.\r\nThe mixture of blood with the Caucasian in America, places the negro\r\nelement of the United States at least upon a level with the Malay race\r\nin natural powers, and from association, much the superior in practical\r\nintelligence. Notwithstanding the crushing laws designed by slaveholders\r\nto perpetuate the ignorance and helplessness of the negro, he _would_\r\nimprove. Notwithstanding the brutal and studied policy of slaveholders\r\nto slander and disparage the negro capacity for improvement, all the\r\narts of lying hypocrisy have occasionally been set at naught by some\r\nconvincing exhibition of truth, springing from a fair experiment on the\r\ncolored man's susceptibilities. The white man's dishonoring inclination\r\nto strike the helpless--made helpless by brutal laws--has occasionally\r\nrecoiled in an exposure of the atrocious practice. The late attempt to\r\nintroduce a bill into the South-Carolina Legislature, providing for the\r\nsale of the free negroes of the State into slavery, led to a disclosure\r\nworthy of contemplation. The Committee to whom the bill was referred\r\nstated that--\r\n\r\n     'Apart from the consideration that many of the class were good\r\n     citizens, patterns of industry, sobriety, and irreproachable\r\n     conduct, there were difficulties of a practical character in the\r\n     way of those who advocated the bill. The free colored population of\r\n     Charleston alone pay taxes on $1,561,870 worth of property; and the\r\n     aggregate taxes reach $27,209.18. What will become of the one and a\r\n     half millions of property which belongs to them in Charleston\r\n     alone, to say nothing of their property elsewhere in the State? Can\r\n     it enter into the mind of any Carolina Legislature to confiscate\r\n     this property, and pot it in the Treasury? We forbear to consider\r\n     any thing so full of injustice and wickedness. While we are\r\n     battling for our rights, liberties, and institutions, can we expect\r\n     the smiles and countenance of the Arbiter of all events, when we\r\n     make war on the impotent and unprotected, enslave them against all\r\n     justice, and rob them of the property acquired by their own honest\r\n     toil and industry, under your former protection and sense of\r\n     justice?'[E]\r\n\r\nThis slight exhibition in the Carolina Legislature presents an epitome\r\nof the whole argument of cultivated brutality on the one hand, and of\r\nhumane sense and rationality on the other. What were the protection and\r\nsense of justice here spoken of; and what the sequences flowing from\r\nsuch protection and justice? The whole question is answered in three\r\nwords: Improvement, following encouragement. What was the 'robbery'\r\nproposed by the bill, other than the concomitants of slavery, that have\r\nrobbed the colored man from generation to generation, not only of his\r\ntoil, but of every practical motive TO BE A MAN? It would be needless,\r\nhowever, to discuss the question of the colored man's capacity to\r\nimprove, were it not for considerations that now make it necessary,\r\nunder national calamity, to take it into truthful account. The white\r\nman's cultivation of barbarity under the teachings of slaveholders has\r\nhitherto proved an overmatch for the colored man's claims in the\r\nabstract. Things and conditions are now changed. The slaveholders'\r\nrebellion has softened the obduracy of manufactured prejudice, and\r\nnecessity has become allied with humanity. Tho pro-slavery spirit in\r\npolitics is now discovered to be little short of a demon--a snake's egg\r\nthat hatches treason. The American mind is nearly forced to the\r\nconclusion, that as long as colored women are compelled to breed slaves,\r\ntheir white mistresses will continue to breed rebels. Slavery, of\r\ncourse, must yield to the necessity of national security. A remnant may\r\nexist for a while, and linger through modifications of a broken and\r\nhopeless pro-slavery prestige, the duration depending entirely upon the\r\ndisposition of slaveholders to become subordinated to law. Perpetuation,\r\nhowever, has become a word that has no meaning in connection with the\r\nduration of slavery. The word in that sense has become obsolete; and\r\nwhat shall become of the colored man, and how shall he be treated, is,\r\nand is to be, the sequence of the conspiracy to overthrow the\r\njurisdiction of the Government. It being established that the\r\npro-slavery spirit, by nature, is the antagonist of the democratic\r\nprinciple--the antagonist of the interests of the masses, the hot-bed\r\nfor the cultivation of brutality, devoid of fidelity, and a rebel by\r\npractice, it has become an intolerable element of national weakness. We\r\ncan not avoid the inquiry, now to be made on the basis of humanity: Can\r\nthe colored man, by proper and just encouragement, be converted into an\r\nelement of patriotism and national strength?\r\n\r\nWhat is the solution of the riddle as it respects the strength of\r\ndemocratic government? It has heretofore been said by the revilers of\r\nthe masses in America, that 'for two hundred years the scum, the crime,\r\nand poverty of Europe have been cast upon the shores of the Atlantic.'\r\nIt is immaterial to the question of humanity, whether such has been the\r\nseed from which a new nation has been raised up in the wilderness. A few\r\nmonths since, 'Democracy on its trial,' was the favorite theme of\r\ndemocracy-haters in Europe. The indictment against our free institutions\r\nwas freighted with fearful charges. The government of the Union was a\r\n'delusive Utopia.' 'The people of the North had degenerated into a mob.'\r\n'Society was drifting into the maelstrom of anarchy, and law and order\r\nbecoming extinct.' A little time, and an apparently unwarlike people had\r\nchanged into an astonishing organization, disciplined for warfare. Seven\r\nhundred thousand bayonets, as if by enchantment, bristled in menace to\r\nthe slaveholders' rebellion. The navy-yards and arsenals resounded with\r\nthe clang of hammers, and soon the suddenly created armaments appeared\r\non the waters. Power in finance exhibited by the Government, based on\r\nthe confidence and patriotism of the people, was no less astonishing.\r\nNew inventions of warfare changed the scoffings in Europe into alarm for\r\ntheir own security. The trans-Atlantic revilers of republicanism in\r\nAmerica have discovered a people who had a heart in them. Patriotism in\r\nAmerica is reassured of success by the exhibition of a deep-seated\r\nattachment on the part of the Northman to his Government. Seven words\r\nsuffice to solve the riddle of free democratic strength--THE MASSES\r\nCONVERTED INTO BEINGS OF POWER. This is the theory, the basis, the\r\nstrength of free institutions in America. They have no other foundation.\r\nThey have nothing else to rely on for enduring support.\r\n\r\nLet the Southern rebel attempt to disguise it as he may, the colored man\r\nof the South is already a patriot on the side of the Union. He has heard\r\nof a people in the North who believed that every human being, by nature,\r\nwas entitled '_to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness_.' He\r\nknows that his oppressor hates this people of the North, and for the\r\nsole reason that they entertain this generous sentiment. While the\r\nPharisaic theologian of the Southern pulpit is expounding his\r\nBible-doctrine in justification of kidnapping, and appealing to Heaven\r\nfor assistance, the colored man turns in disgust at the impiety, and\r\nturns into secret places to beseech Omnipotence to favor the success of\r\nthe national arms. Perhaps there is an interfering Providence already\r\nmanifest in results. If the plagues of Egypt had been visited on the\r\nrebellious States by an overruling Power, they would scarcely have\r\nafforded a parallel to the calamity which rebel slaveholders have\r\ninflicted on their country. They have exhausted and destroyed much of\r\nwhat the long toil of the colored man South had assisted to raise up.\r\nDevastation has followed the train of rebellion. The blood of the first\r\nand of the second-born has been the sacrifice on the altar of slavery.\r\nThe brutal ruffianism of the pro-slavery spirit has far enough disclosed\r\nits natural aptitudes to have become disgustingly odious in comparison\r\nwith the positively better characteristics of the colored man. The rebel\r\nhimself has taught a lesson to the world, which he can never unteach.\r\nThe twenty-seven millions of free labor in the Union have learned a\r\nlesson through the teachings of slaveholders in rebellion, which they\r\ncan not forget. This teaching is nothing less than that the colored man\r\nis capable, by protection and encouragement, of being converted into a\r\nbetter element of national strength and national prosperity than\r\nslaveholders, as _such_, would ever become.\r\n\r\nCould any contemplative mind doubt for a moment the ability of the white\r\npopulation of the Union, if justly disposed, to raise the colored\r\npopulation of the country, in a short time, to the platform of a decent\r\nrespectability? With unjust prejudice laid aside, and the work of\r\nbeneficence acquiesced in, no one could reasonably doubt it. Who\r\ndeserves best at the hands of the nation's power, the oppressor or the\r\noppressed? The one that grasps at the throat of the nation and attempts\r\nits overthrow merely to perpetuate his power of oppression, or the other\r\nwho is crying to humanity for protection? The voice of nature, if\r\nundefiled, will answer this question on the side of humanity--if not,\r\nNECESSITY WILL.\r\n\r\nThe democratic theory which seeks to absolve humanity from oppression,\r\nis not confined to the resistance of a single despot. It goes in the\r\nsame degree to a privileged class that arrogates to itself the right to\r\noppress; nor does it stop at the half-way house of mere negative\r\nprotection. It allows in its onward course the full fruition of\r\n'EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.' In theory, the law is the sovereign, and we\r\nseek to attach such qualities to that sovereign as are compatible with\r\nthe general good of society. That theory places no man above the law,\r\nnor any man below its protection. As soon as the individual in society\r\nis raised to the point of negative protection, he is in a measure\r\nconverted into a being of power. He can then appeal to his sovereign,\r\nTHE LAW, for the vindication of his rights. Experience is continually\r\ndemonstrating that men are respected in proportion to their power to\r\ncommand respect. The very existence of slavery requires and demands the\r\nbrutalization of the governing power that upholds it. Were society\r\nabsolved from this tyranny, matters would begin to mend. Equalized\r\nprotection would be the consequence. Protection, not only to the colored\r\nman, but protection in an almost equal degree to the non-slaveholding\r\nwhite population, hitherto brought under the ban of disability by a\r\ndepressing pro-slavery policy.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, when the colored race in the United States was spoken of\r\nin connection with the subject of its release from oppression, it was\r\nsubjected to the same arguments that kept the white men in slavery in\r\nolden times. The arguments of slaveholders were never truthful, and only\r\nconvenient for themselves. They damaged the slave; they damaged every\r\ncollateral interest; they damaged the strength of nationality; and more\r\nthan all, they damaged every humane principle of civilization. The whole\r\nreasoning in favor of slaveholding has been a vicious fallacy; and\r\nperhaps the time has come, attended by sufficient calamity, to set the\r\nAmerican population to thinking and acting in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe colored people South are better fitted for freedom than is commonly\r\nimagined. They are quite well skilled in practical industry, more\r\nespecially in agricultural pursuits. There are many of them qualified in\r\nskilled labor in the coarser mechanic arts. The whole of this population\r\nhas been trained to diligent labor, under habits of continuous toil. It\r\nhas acquired patience in performing labor, by the discipline which\r\nunremitting labor gives. The colored man South has not been brought up\r\nin idleness, or with habits calculated to make him a renegade. Were he\r\npermitted to enjoy the fruits of his industry, there can be no doubt of\r\nhis disposition and patience to toil on. In case his rebel master would\r\nnot hire him for wages, there would be enough amongst the\r\nnon-slaveholding population who would. Production in the South, under\r\nemancipation of the slaves of rebel masters, would not materially fall\r\noff. Give to colored men the fruits of their industry, and many of them\r\nwould soon set up for themselves. Perhaps in connection with the soil of\r\nthe South, that yields most abundantly in annual value of product, the\r\nrest of the colored population would soon get to emulate the free\r\ncolored people of Charleston. The law of subsistence would as much\r\ncompel the South to go on without compulsory labor as it does the North,\r\nand there are just as many reasons for it in one section as in the\r\nother; that is, just none at all. Under emancipation, there is little\r\ndoubt that actual production could and would soon be put on the\r\nincrease, with better distribution of wealth, more widely diffused\r\ncomforts, and a broader and better public policy. The only things that\r\nwould be curtailed in their proportions would be slave-breeding,\r\nrebel-breeding, and ruffian cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, continue to be easier for a time to strike the colored\r\nman than to strike off his shackles. There is a mean and low side of\r\nhumanity, a sort of defiled infirmity, that runs into a disposition to\r\nstrike the helpless. This is the bravery of ruffianism. There is apt to\r\nbe a shrinking away from duty, when the contest involves a conflict with\r\narrogant power. This is the cowardice of pusillanimity. The American\r\ncitizen has been noted for his superior bravery. He has certainly shown\r\nhimself brave in the battle-field, and more brave and determined than\r\nany other nation in the vindication and maintenance of the natural\r\nrights of the white man; but he is not done with the business of\r\ndisenthrallment. His language is the language of liberty. It must not,\r\nit will not long continue to be spoken by slaves. This was the meaning\r\nof Jefferson, when he penned the _text-words_ of disenthrallment: 'All\r\nmen are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable\r\nrights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'\r\nWhere is to be found the evidence that these rights have been forfeited?\r\nWho dare deny the right of the colored man morally, religiously, or\r\npolitically, to assert them? It is true, we have hitherto acted in\r\ndefiance of these acknowledged rights. We have outraged them. We have\r\nwaged a shameful and shameless warfare against them. The sequences of\r\nthat warfare are now upon us. The sin is now being atoned for in blood.\r\nIt has not yet been ordained that the principles of injustice should\r\nhave permanent duration. If not restrained by humane rationality, they\r\nwill culminate in convulsion. The light is now breaking upon the\r\nheretofore obscured vision of the American people. We can now begin to\r\nsee with clearness that the colored man's disenthrallment is to become\r\nthe white man's future security. This would almost seem to be the\r\nharmony of divine justice in the affairs of men.\r\n\r\nNo substantial amelioration in the depressed condition of race or class\r\nhas yet been brought about in disconnection with the powerful agency of\r\nsuch race or class. Human nature forbids it. The selfish tenacity of\r\nadvantage, resting on what is misnamed 'vested rights,' but having its\r\nfoundation in vested wrongs, yields only on compulsion. It is only when\r\nthe depressed race or class, acting in somewhat intelligent concert,\r\nexhibits the disposition to aid in the purposes of protection, that the\r\nmercenary power succumbs to necessity. History furnishes no examples to\r\nthe contrary. It may not be impossible that our own times may make\r\nhistory to corroborate the truth of these premises.\r\n\r\nWhen it is asserted that the colored man is wanting in bravery, and is\r\nnot endowed with the natural courage to assert and maintain his rights,\r\nwe are apt to forget that physical bravery is a thing of cultivation.\r\nThere is not the least evidence that, with military discipline and\r\nsomething to fight for, the colored population of the United States\r\nwould not prove as brave as the black regiment of the Revolution. With\r\nsuch bravery as that regiment exhibited, the four millions and their\r\nprospective increase would require a gigantic force to make profitable\r\nslaves of them. Again, there is something beyond the protection from\r\ndomestic violence that demands consideration, in connection with the\r\nmilitary discipline of the colored man. We may reasonably expect that a\r\nlarge colonization in some quarter will soon take place, and be carried\r\nforward. Education and military discipline, in addition to knowledge in\r\npractical industry, are necessary concomitants to successful\r\ncolonization. With these qualities, the colored man will cease to feel\r\nhelpless, and be fitted for enterprise, he will have the confidence to\r\ngo forward, and the aspirations to impel him. It may be the lot of the\r\ncolored man to encounter in some foreign land powers and influences\r\nquite as barbarous as those he has hitherto encountered in the white\r\nman's prejudices. If he is armed for the encounter, he will have little\r\ninclination to shrink from it. Every humane consideration clusters to\r\nthe policy of disenthralling the colored man, and of making him a being\r\nof power. Nothing can oppose it but the pro-slavery spirit that seeks to\r\nenslave the American mind to barbarism and the colored millions and\r\ntheir increase to perpetual bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               WATCHING THE STAG.\r\n\r\n        [AN UNFINISHED POEM, BY FITZ-JAMES O'BRIEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n        Hela and I lie watching here,\r\n        Above us the sky and below the mere.\r\n                                     long\r\n        Through distant gorges the-b-l-u-e-moors loom\r\n        Till the heath looks blue in the endless gloom.\r\n\r\n        The eagle screams from the misty cliff,\r\n        With a quivering lamb in his taloned griff.\r\n        And the echoes leap over hill and hollow,\r\n        As the old stag bells to the herd to follow.\r\n\r\n        The purpled heather is wet with mist,\r\n        Till it shines like a drownèd amethyst,\r\n        And the old, old rocks with furrowed faces\r\n        Start up like ghosts in the lonely places.\r\n\r\n        With forefeet crossed, stanch Hela lies\r\n        Watching my face through her half-closed eyes,\r\n                      -u-s-\r\n        -B-e-t-w-e-e-n--i-s--i-s--s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d-deer\r\n        While ^ I pillow my head on the stiffening-s-t-a-g-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYARD TAYLOR'S PROSE WRITING'S. Vol. V. A Journey to Central Africa,\r\nwith a Map and Illustrations by the Author. New-York: G.P. Putnam.\r\nBoston: A.K. Loring.\r\n\r\nThis work deservedly ranks as among the best, if not the best, by Bayard\r\nTaylor. The East, as we feel in his poems, was full of the scenes of his\r\nwidely varied travels, that which most aroused his sympathy and stirred\r\nhis artistic creative powers, and it is of the East that he speaks most\r\nfreely and brilliantly. It was in Central Africa that he encountered his\r\nmost thrilling adventures, and forgot, as we can there only do, the\r\ncivilization of the Western World. Something we would say of the\r\nbeautiful typography and paper of this series. If the term _mise en\r\nscène_ were as applicable to books as to dramas, it might be truely said\r\nof Mr. Putnam's that they appear as well between boards as other works\r\ndo upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEL DORADO. PROSE WRITINGS OF BAYARD TAYLOR. Vol. IV. New-York: G.P.\r\nPutnam. Boston: A.K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nPossibly some twenty years hence 'El Dorado' will be regarded as by far\r\nthe best of Bayard Taylor's works--certain it is that in it he is among\r\nthe pioneer describers of a land the early accounts of which will be\r\ncarefully investigated and duly honored. In picturing lands, where\r\nothers have been noting and sketching before, he is strong indeed who is\r\nnot driven into mannerism; but in fresh fields and pastures new there is\r\nless danger of seeing through thrice-used spectacles. It is this\r\nconsciousness of being the first that ever burst into their silent seas\r\nthat made Herodotus and Tudela and Rubriquis and Mandeville so fresh and\r\nvigorous--and there is much of the same peculiar inspiration due to\r\nfirst-ness perceptible in this volume, which we cordially commend to all\r\nwho would be California-learned or simply entertained. Somewhat we must\r\nsay however of the fine paper, exquisite typography, and two neat steel\r\nengravings with which this 'Caxton' edition is made beautiful and most\r\nsuitable either for a lady's _étagere_-book-shelf or the most elegant\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nLES MISERABLES. I. FANTINE. BY VICTOR HUGO. Translated by CHARLES E.\r\nWILBOUR. New-York: Carleton. Boston: Crosby and Nichols. 1862.\r\n\r\nA novel written twenty-five years ago by Victor Hugo is a curiosity. The\r\npresent was kept in reserve because the sordid publisher, who had a\r\ncontract for all of Hugo's works, would not give the sum demanded--the\r\nauthor kept raising his price--it was like Nero and the Sybil, or the\r\nconverse of the conduct of the damsel who annually reduced her terms to\r\nMartial:\r\n\r\n    'Millia viginti quondam me Galla poposcit;\r\n    Annus abit: bis quina dabis sestertia? dixit.'\r\n\r\nFinally the publisher died, the work was printed, and its first section\r\nnow appears in 'Fantine'--a capital picture of life, manners, customs,\r\nin fact of almost every thing in France in 1817. It deals with much\r\nsuffering, many sorrows, as its title indicates--for it is easier to\r\nmake sensations out of pains than pleasures, and M. Hugo is preëminently\r\nand proverbially 'sensational.' Still it is deeply interesting,\r\nextremely well managed in all art-details, and above all things, is\r\nextremely humane--as a book by Victor Hugo could hardly fail to be. And\r\nas every page bears the impress of a certain characteristic originality\r\nof thought and of observation, we may safely predict that 'Fantine' will\r\ndeservedly prove a success. We like the manner in which Mr. Wilbour has\r\ntranslated it--neither too slavishly nor too freely, but in one word,\r\n'admirably.'\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEMUS WARD HIS BOOK. New-York; Carleton. Boston: N. Williams and\r\nCompany. 1862.\r\n\r\nOnce in five or six years we have a new humorist--at one time a Jack\r\nDowning, then a Doesticks, then again a Phoenix-Derby. Last on the list\r\nwe have 'Artemus Ward,' as set forth in letters to the Cleveland\r\n_Plaindealer_ and _Vanity Fair_, purporting to come from the proprietor\r\nof a 'side-show,' as cheaper, or less than twenty-five cent exhibitions,\r\nare called in this country. To say that they are excellent, spirited,\r\nand racy--full of strong idioms of language and character, and abounding\r\nin novelties in type which are no novelties to those familiar with\r\npopular life--would be doing them faint justice. They embody a new and\r\nperfectly truthful conception of one of the multitude, and have nothing\r\nthat is hackneyed in them.\r\n\r\nIt is a great test of real stuff in a writer when he dashes off, or\r\npicks up, phrases which are at once taken up by the people. 'Artemus\r\nWard' has originated many of these, and is perhaps at the present day as\r\nmuch quoted 'in the broad and long' as any man in the country. It is\r\nneedless to say that all who relish broad eccentric humor will find his\r\nBook very well worth reading. We regret that it does not embrace certain\r\nother excellent sketches which we know he has written, but trust that\r\nthese will appear in due time in a second part or in a new edition. The\r\nvolume before us is very neatly got up, well illustrated, and tastefully\r\nbound.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYRICS FOR FREEDOM AND OTHER POEMS. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE\r\nCONTINENTAL CLUB. New-York: Carleton, 413 Broadway, Boston; Crosby and\r\nNichols.\r\n\r\nAt a regular meeting of the 'Continental Club,' held at their rooms in\r\nNew-York, it was resolved and carried that a volume of poems written by\r\ncertain of the younger members be published 'under its auspices.' As a\r\nnoted Democratic sheet, the Boston _Courier_, has declined to notice the\r\nvolume on the plea that the name of the society from which it sprung\r\nsuggested too forcibly the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, possibly a favorable\r\nmention by us of our young New-York brother-in-literature may seem\r\npartial and too en-famille-iar to be fair. Be this as it may, we can not\r\nresist the expression of the honest conviction, for which we have many a\r\ngood indorser, that while it would be a matter of some difficulty to\r\ncompile a better collection of lyrics from the vast number which the war\r\nhas thus far called forth, its production by a limited number of a\r\nsingle association is indeed remarkable. There is the right ring and the\r\ntrue feeling perceptible in all of them; earnest enthusiasm flowing\r\nbravely on the tide of musical words, and a clear conviction of the\r\njustice of our cause springing from liberal and progressive political\r\nviews. It is enough indeed to say of most of the lyrics that they are\r\nwritten from a principle, and with faith in the necessity of\r\nEmancipation, and are not mere war-songs, full of commonplace, as\r\napplicable to one cause as another. They are songs of the American war\r\nof freedom in 1861, and as such will rank high in our literary history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REJECTED STONE; OR, INSURRECTION VERSUS RESURRECTION IN AMERICA. By\r\na Native of Virginia. Second Edition, Boston: Walker, Wise and Company.\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nWe are as gratified at the reappearance of this glorious work as we are\r\nastonished to learn that it has only reached a second edition. As it is\r\nbeyond comparison the most remarkable literary result thus far of the\r\nwar, as it has made a strong sensation in very varied circles, as it is\r\na book which has given rise to anecdotes, and as its wild eloquence,\r\nbizarre humor and intense earnestness, have caused it to be read with a\r\nrelish even by many who dissent from its politics, we had supposed that\r\nere this its sale had reached at least its tenth edition. Meanwhile we\r\ncommend it to all, assuring them that as a fearless, outspoken work,\r\ngrasping boldly at the exciting questions of the day, it has not its\r\nequal. We should mention that in the present edition we find given the\r\nname of its author, the well-known and eloquent Rev. Moncure D. Conway,\r\nformerly of Virginia, now of Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FLAG: A Poem in Four Cantos. By T.H. UNDERWOOD. New-York: Carleton.\r\nBoston: N. Williams. 1862.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year Mr. Underwood has published several poems of\r\nremarkable merit, referring to the war. In the present we have a work of\r\nhigher ambition, and one which is truly well done. In it the horrors of\r\nslavery, the iniquitous abuses to which it so often gives rise--the\r\ntortures, vengeances, murders, and fiendish punishments, which in their\r\nturn follow the crime--are portrayed with striking truthfulness and real\r\npower. The author is evidently no Abolitionist on hear-say--the whole\r\npoem gives evidence of practical familiarity with 'the institution,' and\r\nthe sense of truth has inspired his pen in many passages with wonderful\r\npower. The terrible sufferings of an _almost_ white man and slave as\r\nhere portrayed, his revenge and punishment at the stake, are as moving\r\nas they are manifestly true to life. We commend this little\r\npamphlet-poem to every friend of freedom, and sincerely trust that it\r\nwill attain the large circulation which it deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF THE RISE, PROGRESS, AND DECLINE OF SECESSION. With a\r\nNarrative of Personal Adventures among the Rebels. By W.G. BROWNLOW,\r\nEditor of the _Knoxville Whig_. Philadelphia: Geo. W. Childs. 1862.\r\n\r\nA decided character this 'Parson Brownlow,' and a representative man;\r\ntruly and bravely American, very Western in his traits; a man fond of\r\nfierce argument and tough antagonisms, and not fearing the death either\r\nby halter or revolver, which he will probably meet some day, for the\r\nsake of Jehovah and his own stern convictions. Not exactly a man of\r\n_salons_ and elegant _réunions_--yet full of real courtesies and gifted\r\nwith the kind heart of a true hater of wickedness, which flashes into\r\nfury at witnessing deeds of cruelty and shame. And he has seen many\r\nsuch--seen what few have done and lived--he has passed through a life's\r\nwarfare with men of his own grim obstinacy without his own honesty and\r\nstern Puritan-like morality. We have followed his course for years--we\r\nhave met him 'afore-time,' when quite other subjects of quarrel engaged\r\nhim, and could have prophesied then with tolerable accuracy what part he\r\nwould play when it came to a question between bayonets and prisons for\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nAs we have hinted, he is a splendid hater, and a ferocious antagonist, a\r\nprince of vituperators and a very vitriol-thrower of savage sarcasms at\r\nhis enemies and those of humanity. And why should he not be all of this,\r\nwhen we consider that in the stage whereon his part of life is played a\r\nmore delicate student of all the proprieties would have about the same\r\nchances of success as attended the unfortunate cat which ventured\r\nwithout claws among panthers. Measure such men by their moral worth and\r\nby the good they do, and do not require of the hard-shell Methodist\r\npreacher and tough polemical grappler with Satan in his most bristly and\r\nthick-skinned Western incarnations that he display too much delicacy.\r\nThose who will read his book may gather from it, beyond the interesting\r\npersonal and political narrative of which it consists, many useful and\r\ncurious hints as to the social development of America and of what men\r\nthe country is truly made. It is a _real_ work--one of value--interesting\r\nto all, and very truly one of the monuments of this war and\r\nof the scenes which preceded it in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of President Lincoln in reference to General Hunter,\r\nand the bold measures of the latter calling forth Executive\r\ninterference, form one of the most interesting episodes of the war of\r\nFreedom. Regarded from the high standpoint whence acts are seen as\r\ncontrolled by circumstances and formed by events, the conduct of the one\r\npublic functionary, as of the other, will appear to the future historian\r\nin a very different light from that in which it has been presented by\r\neither the radical or democratic journals of the day. He will speak of\r\nthe one as a military chieftain under the influence of worthy motives,\r\ncutting a Gordian knot which the higher and controlling diplomatic and\r\nexecutive superior wished should be cautiously untied. The one has acted\r\nwith a view to promptly settling a great trouble within his own\r\nsphere--the other wisely comprehending that the action was premature,\r\nhas decisively countered it. By attempting to free the slaves, General\r\nHunter has shown himself a friend of freedom and a man of bold measures;\r\nby annulling his acts Mr. Lincoln has availed himself of an excellent\r\nopportunity of proving to the South and to the world that he is not, as\r\nwas said, a sectional or an Abolition President, and that with the\r\nstrongest sympathies for freedom, he is determined to respect the rights\r\neven of enemies, and leave behind him a clear record, as one who did\r\nnothing wrongly, and who with keen and wide comprehending glance took in\r\nthe times as they were, and acted accordingly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile to the most prejudiced vision it is apparent that the great\r\ncause of Emancipation has gained vastly by this little struggle between\r\nthe shepherd and that unruly member of the flock who _would_ dash a\r\nlittle too impetuously ahead of his fellows. The proclamation of\r\nPresident Lincoln contains but cold comfort for the pro-slavery\r\ndemocracy, although they affect to rejoice over it. In vain may they\r\ndeclare, as they did of the celebrated 'remunerating message,' that it\r\nis very palatable, and vow that it 'creates fresh hope and gives a new\r\nand needed assurance to the conservative men of the nation.' The sour\r\nfaces of their pro-slavery, Southern-adoring, English-ruled, traitorous\r\nfriends is an effectual answer to their hypocrisy. We have not forgotten\r\nhow warmly the Democratic press indorsed the message of January 6th, or\r\nhow the Democratic multitude kicked against it in public meetings.\r\n\r\nLet the Democratic tories of the day who find this message so\r\nconsolatory, duly weigh the following extract from it:\r\n\r\n     'I further make known that whether it be competent for me as\r\n     Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to declare the slaves of\r\n     any State or States free, and whether at any time or in any case it\r\n     shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of\r\n     the Government to exercise such supposed power, are questions which\r\n     under my responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I can not\r\n     feel justified in leaving to the decisions of commanders in the\r\n     field. These are totally different questions from those of police\r\n     regulations in armies and camps. On the sixth day of March last, by\r\n     a special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a\r\n     joint resolution to be substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the United States ought to co-operate with, any\r\n     State which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to\r\n     such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its\r\n     discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and\r\n     private, produced by such change of system.'\r\n\r\n     'The resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large\r\n     majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an\r\n     authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the Nation to the\r\n     States and people moat immediately interested in the\r\n     subject-matter. To the people of those States, I now earnestly\r\n     appeal. I do not argue, I beseech you to make the arguments for\r\n     yourselves. _You can not, if you would, be blind to the signs of\r\n     the times._ I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them,\r\n     ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics.\r\n     _This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no\r\n     reproaches upon any._ It acts not the Pharisee. The change it\r\n     contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending\r\n     or wrecking any thing. Will you not embrace it? So much good has\r\n     not been done by one effort in all past time as in the providence\r\n     of God it is your high privilege to do. May the vast future not\r\n     have to lament that you have neglected it.'\r\n\r\nIf any one can see in this aught save the clearest sympathy with the\r\ngradual advance of Emancipation, he must be indeed gifted with a strange\r\nfaculty of perversion. If, however, the Democrats indorse the\r\nPresident's recommendation and approve the Executive policy of gradual\r\nemancipation for the sake of the white man, why do they continue to\r\nabuse so fiercely presses which agree exactly with the Administration,\r\nand ask for nothing more than a recognition of the great principle and\r\nits realization according to circumstance?\r\n\r\nA more contemptible and pitiable political spectacle was never yet\r\npresented than that which may now be witnessed in the actions and words\r\nof the 'Conservative' Democracy. Driven day by day nearer into their\r\ntrue light of sympathizers at heart with the enemy--upholding the\r\ninstitution for which it fights--obliged to bear the odium of its\r\nancient opposition to protection, disgraced by its enmity to American\r\nmanufacturing interests--apologizing in a thousand shuffling, petty ways\r\nfor English arrogance--this wretched fragment of a faction, after\r\nassuring the South that the North would not fight, and persuading the\r\nNorth that the South was quite in the right in every thing, now appears\r\nas constant meddler and mischief-maker in the great struggle going on,\r\ngiving to it those elements of darkness, disgrace, and treason which,\r\nunfortunately, are always to be found in the greatest struggles for\r\nfreedom and right, and which, when history is written, give such grounds\r\nto the carper, the sophist, and skeptic to ridicule the noblest efforts\r\nof humanity. Such are the self-called Conservatives in this great\r\nbattle--men hindering and impeding the great cause, eagerly grasping at\r\nevery little premature advance--as in the case of General Hunter's\r\naction, to scream out that all will be lost, and exult over its\r\ncorrection by the leading power as though they had gained a victory!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is a matter of no small import to observe that there has\r\nbeen a vast increase in the mass of indorsement of General Hunter's\r\nconduct compared to what there would have been a few months ago. However\r\nit interfered with the general policy of the Executive, no one doubts\r\nthat as a military and local measure it was eminently wise. Sooner or\r\nlater it will be adopted--meanwhile what has been done has been\r\nproductive of results which can not be undone. The great cause is the\r\ncause of God--and every struggle only aids it onward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London Times of May 10th contained a long editorial leader on\r\nAmerican affairs, beginning in the following manner:\r\n\r\n     'It will have been noticed as a singular feature of the American\r\n     quarrel, that no intervention is thought probable or practicable,\r\n     except in favor of the South. Mediation, in whatever form or under\r\n     whatever name it is to be offered, is universally taken to imply\r\n     some movement in behalf of the Confederates. So completely, indeed,\r\n     are the belligerents themselves impressed with this idea, that the\r\n     South casts it in our teeth as a scandal and a blunder that no\r\n     European arbitration has been yet interposed; while the President\r\n     of the Northern States actually proclaims a day of thanksgiving for\r\n     the deliverance of the country from 'foreign intervention,' which\r\n     he identifies with nothing less than 'invasion.' The instincts of\r\n     the combatants have undoubtedly led them to correct decisions on\r\n     this point, but the fact is not a little curious. We need not\r\n     dissemble the truth about certain prepossessions current in\r\n     Europe. It is beyond denial that, in spite of the slavery question,\r\n     the Southerners have been rather the favorites, partly as the\r\n     weaker side, partly as conquerors against odds, and partly because\r\n     their demand for independence was thought too natural to be\r\n     resisted at the sword's point by a Government founded on the right\r\n     of insurrection only. To these merely sentimental and not very\r\n     cogent considerations was added the more potent and weighty\r\n     reflection that what the Southerners had done no Power, whether\r\n     American or European, could succeed in undoing.'\r\n\r\nThe rest of the article, as the reader may recall, was devoted to\r\nsneering at the North and in commending intervention; the whole being\r\ncharacterized by an underhand, venomous, and latent treacherous tone,\r\nmuch more becoming a vindictive and vulgar Oriental than a civilized and\r\nChristian European.\r\n\r\nA little while before the _Times_ leader appeared, the London _Morning\r\nHerald_ had informed the world that\r\n\r\n     France and England suffer more than neutrals ever suffered from any\r\n     contest, and both begin to regard the war as interminable and\r\n     atrocious.'\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the great majority of the British press and people\r\nshould dare to talk so glibly of intervention in this our civil war,\r\nwhen we consider what their intermeddling may cost them. Cotton they may\r\nor may not get, but no intervention can compel us to buy their goods,\r\nand, as we have already pointed out in our columns, the entire loss of\r\nthe free States market involves a disaster which will be permanent and\r\nterrible. Apart from the danger attendant upon insolently threatening a\r\nnation amply capable of mustering an army of a million on its own\r\nsoil--two thirds of them practiced in war--there remains to be\r\nconsidered the utter loss of all American custom. We buy much more than\r\nany other nation whatever. Worse than this, for Europe, there would\r\nfollow Such a development of our home-manufactures as would seriously\r\nthreaten to drive England and France from a hundred markets. Let them\r\nthink twice ere they intervene. But the people, it is said, are\r\nstarving; and it may be, for this is one of the occasional and\r\nunavoidable results of England's endeavoring to become the workshop of\r\nthe world. By _over-manufacturing_, she has brought it to such a pitch\r\nthat one fourth of her population live on _imported food_--such as do\r\nnot starve outright--for be it remembered that in Great Britain one\r\nperson in eight is buried at the public expense, while one in every\r\ntwelve or fourteen is a constant pauper. They are starving at present\r\nmore than usual, simply because the North is buying less; but to turn\r\naway any popular opposition to government, and suppress riots, they and\r\nthe world are told that the trouble all comes from the closing of\r\nSouthern ports and _the want of cotton_! This, too, when published facts\r\nshow that the stock of goods and cotton on hand far exceeds the demand,\r\nand is likely to exceed it for a long time to come. It is not cotton\r\nthat England or France want, but _customers_. How are they to obtain\r\nthese? By exasperating their best buyers beyond all reconciliation? The\r\nday that witnesses British or French meddling in our war, sees the\r\ninauguration of such hostility to their manufactures as they little\r\ndream of. There will be leagues formed to enforce this to the letter. It\r\nwill be treason to wear an inch of English cloth or of French silk, and\r\nwhat lie will they say to their starving operatives then?\r\n\r\nAlready within the past year, great advances have been made in\r\nmanufacturing, especially in silks. A little closing of us up would be\r\nthe worst experiment for England that she ever yet tried. She may\r\npossibly get cotton from the South, but not a customer from the North.\r\nYou may lead a horse to water, but it is another affair to make him\r\ndrink. And no one who can recall the prompt resolve not to use English\r\ngoods, and the beginning of leagues to that effect, of which we lately\r\nheard so much, can doubt that in case we hear much more of this\r\nimpertinence of intervention, the American market would immediately be\r\nlost to the insolent meddlers. It is only of late that the free States\r\nhave shaken off their Democratic, pro-slavery, anti-tariff tyrants, and\r\nlearned to be free. England has groaned and howled at our freedom; now\r\nshe goes so far as to threaten; but unless she soon stop _that_, we\r\nshall promptly show her where the strength lies. While we were under a\r\nhalf-Southern, half-British tyranny, we could do nothing. And be it\r\nremembered that from the days of the New-York _Plebeian_, when British\r\ngold was spent literally by the million in this country, to strengthen\r\nthe Democratic party and build up free trade, slavery and English\r\ninterests always went hand in hand to oppress the interests of American\r\nfree labor. But we shall soon change all that. It is in our power to\r\nchastise British impudence most effectually, and we shall probably soon\r\nbe called upon to do it, by buying nothing from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe inhuman, inconsistent, and cynically selfish conduct of England\r\ntoward the North in this war, whenever we have been threatened by\r\nreverses, should not be forgotten. It has been literally devilish in its\r\ngrossness and meanness. Whatever wickedness the South has been guilty of\r\nwas at least barefaced and bold. The South had not for years labored to\r\nbuild up an Abolition party in the North, as England did. For well nigh\r\nhalf a century has England howled, wailed, whined, and canted over\r\nslavery; but at the first pinch of the pocket, away goes the previous\r\nphilanthropy, and John Bull stands revealed, the brutal, cruel,\r\ntreacherous, lying savage that he is at heart, under all his\r\naristocratic feudal trash and gilding. Well, we know him at last, and\r\nwill _remember_ him. His conduct toward us has put hay on his\r\nhorns--_foenum habet in cornu_--and we shall avoid him. Let the\r\nmanufacturers of America watch this intolerably insolent intervention\r\nclosely, and lose no opportunity to turn it to their own advantage, that\r\nis to say, to the advantage of the whole nation. Let them, by means of\r\njournal and pamphlet, profusely scattered, explain to the people the\r\nenormous wrong which England is seeking to do us, and the deliberate, we\r\nmay truthfully say, the official falsehood on which it is based. They\r\nhave it in their power to make our country literally _free_--will they\r\nhesitate to use that power?\r\n\r\nThe reliance of England is, by returning to her sweet, stale flatteries,\r\nafter the establishment of the Confederacy, to be friends as of old with\r\nthe North. It is, she thinks, easily done. Our servants abroad and their\r\nfriends are to be a little more favored with levee tickets and access to\r\nnoble society; a few dozen more of the rank and file will be marched\r\nalong or 'presented' before her Majesty, and thereby sworn in to endless\r\nadmiration of all that is Anglican; venerable gentlemen in white\r\nwaistcoats will make sweet speeches, after public dinners, of the beauty\r\nof Union, just as they made them here a year ago, in reference to the\r\nSouth, when the tiger was on the spring. The old see-saw of 'nations\r\nunited in language and customs--brothers at heart,' will be set to\r\nvibrating, and all, as they believe, must jog along merrily as of old.\r\nFor it is with a very little regularly organized stuff of this kind,\r\nturned on or off as from a hydrant, and always in dribbling drops at\r\nthat, that England has, when necessary, pacified and delighted a great\r\nnumber of Americans, semi-insane to be received on terms of equality by\r\nthe 'higher classes,' whom they worshiped at heart, while they affected\r\nall manner of bold Americanisms to hide the truth. It is time to end all\r\nthis. We have come to serious and terrible days, and must be free from\r\nall such flunkeyism. In our hour of trouble, the English press boldly\r\nproclaimed that its sympathy was with the South. Let it be remembered!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our June number we gave the Kansas John Brown song, for the benefit\r\nof those who collect the more curious ballads of the war. We are\r\nindebted to Clark's _School-Visitor_ for the following song of the\r\nContrabands, which originated among the latter, and was first sung by\r\nthem in the hearing of white people at Fortress Monroe, where it was\r\nnoted down by their chaplain, Rev. L.C. Lockwood. It is to a plaintive\r\nand peculiar air, and we may add has been published with it in\r\n'sheet-music style,' with piano-forte accompaniment, by Horace Waters,\r\nNew-York:\r\n\r\n                   OH! LET MY PEOPLE GO.\r\n\r\n                THE SONG OF THE CONTRABANDS.\r\n\r\n    The Lord, by Moses, to Pharaoh said: Oh! let my people go;\r\n    If not, I'll smite your first-born dead--Oh! let my people go.\r\n      Oh! go down, Moses,\r\n      Away down to Egypt's land,\r\n      And tell King Pharaoh\r\n      To let my people go.\r\n\r\n    No more shall they in bondage toil--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    Let them come out with Egypt's spoil--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    Haste, Moses, till the sea you've crossed--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    Pharaoh shall in the deep be lost--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    The sea before you shall divide--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    You'll cross dry-shod to the other aide--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    Fear not King Pharaoh or his host--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    For they shall in the sea be lost--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    They'll sink like lead, to rise no more--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    An' you'll hear a shout on the other shore--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    The fiery cloud shall lead the way--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    A light by night and a shade by day--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    Jordan shall stand up like a wall--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    And the wails of Jericho shall fall--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    Your foes shall not before you stand--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    And you'll possess fair Canaan's land--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    Oh! let us all from bondage flee--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    And let us all in Christ be free--Oh! let my people go.\r\n\r\n    This world's a wilderness of woe--Oh! let my people go;\r\n    Oh! let us all to glory go--Oh! let my people go.\r\n      Oh! go down, Moses,\r\n      Away down to Egypt's land,\r\n      And tell King Pharaoh\r\n      To let my people go.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the interview some weeks since between M. le Comte Henri de\r\nMercier with the extremely 'honorable' J.P. Benjamin, the secession\r\nSecretary of State, the Petersburg (Virginia) _Express_ uses the\r\nfollowing elegantly accurate language:\r\n\r\n     'It is said that these two distinguished functionaries spoke the\r\n     French dialect altogether, the gallant Frenchman not having yet\r\n     been enabled to master the good old Anglo-Saxon idiom.'\r\n\r\nWhat, to begin with, is _the_ French dialect? The Provencal, the Gascon,\r\nthe Norman, are tolerably prominent French dialects, but which of them\r\nis preëminently _the_ dialect we will not decide--nor why the diplomatic\r\ngentlemen selected a dialect instead of French itself as a medium of\r\nconversation. It is, however, possible that Comte de Mercier having\r\nheard of little Benjamin's antecedents, talked to him in _argôt_ or\r\nthieves' slang. It may be that in the school of Floyd and Benjamin argôt\r\nis _the_ dialect.\r\n\r\nAgain, we learn that the gallant Frenchman spoke 'the French dialect'\r\nbecause he has not as yet mastered 'the good old Anglo-Saxon idiom.'\r\nThis is even more puzzling than the dialect-question. Why the\r\nAnglo-Saxon idiom? Suppose Count Mercier wished to say that he was sorry\r\nthat his tobacco had been captured by the foe, why should he couch it in\r\nsuch language as, 'Thá mee ongan hréowan thaet mín _tobacco_ on feónda\r\ngeweald feran sceolde'--which is the good _old_ Anglo-Saxon idiom.' We\r\n_can_ imagine that thieves' slang would have the place of honor in\r\nSecessia, but why the old Anglo-Saxon idiom should be so esteemed,\r\npuzzled us for a longtime. At last we hit it. The Southrons have long\r\nbeen told--or told themselves--that they are Normans, while we of the\r\nNorth are Saxon--and hoping to acquire a little Anglo-Saxon\r\nintelligence, prudently begin by studying the language which they\r\nbelieve is in common use among our literati.\r\n\r\nSeriously, it is not merely to stoop to such small game as the grammar\r\nof a secession newspaper that we notice these amusing mistakes. There\r\nare many persons-we are sorry to say many clergymen among others--here,\r\neven in the free States, who, in attempting to write elegantly, use\r\nwords very ridiculously. They say 'dialect' and 'idiom' when they mean\r\n'language;' they use 'donate' for 'give;' 'transpired' for 'happened;'\r\n'paper' for 'newspaper,' and describe various events as taking place in\r\n'our midst'--all because they think that these vulgarisms are really\r\nmore correct than the words or terms in common use.\r\n\r\nWe wish, however, that Anglo-Saxon--joking apart--were more generally\r\nstudied. When we remember that the very great majority of good _words_\r\nin English are of Saxon origin, and with them all that is characteristic\r\neither in our grammar or modes of expression, it becomes evident that\r\nthe most certain and shortest method of arriving at a thorough and\r\ncorrect comprehension of English is by the study of its most important\r\nelement--one which, as a writer has well said, bears the same relation\r\nto our mother-tongue as oxygen does to water. It is not fair to speak as\r\nsome do of the Latin and Saxon wings of the English bird--the bird\r\nitself is Saxon--head and tail included. English has been but little\r\nbenefited by its Latin and Greek additions--the old tongue had excellent\r\nsynonyms or creative capacity like German--to fully equal every new need\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has time for study, would do well to obtain the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Grammar of Louis Klipstein, published by G.P. Putnam,\r\nNew-York, which is by far the most practical and easiest work of the\r\nkind with which we are acquainted. A few days' study in it will be time\r\nwell invested by any one desirous of really _understanding_ English.\r\nWhen we reflect that many boys study Latin for years 'because it enables\r\nthem to understand the structure and derivation of their own language,'\r\nwhile the extremely easy Anglo-Saxon is almost entirely neglected, we\r\nsmile at the ignorance of the first principles of education which\r\nprevails. But we advise the reader who may have a few shillings and a\r\nfew hours to spare to invest them in a 'KLIPSTEIN,' and _know_--what\r\nvery few writers do--something of the roots of English. Our word for it,\r\nhe will not regret following the advice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a Dawfuskie Island correspondent for the following\r\ndetails relative to\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF PULASKI.\r\n\r\n     'Come and dine with me next Sunday in Pulaski?' said the commandant\r\n     of a detachment of the Volunteer Engineer corps located on Tybee\r\n     Island, one bright morning in the early part of April. As the\r\n     invitation was given in all sincerity, and the officer who thus\r\n     spoke was assisting in the erection of the batteries commanding\r\n     that fort, the question which had so long occupied my mind, as to\r\n     when the bombardment would begin, was now, I fondly hoped, near its\r\n     solution. Time and again had rumor fixed the period of that event;\r\n     but as often were we disappointed. Nor was _the_ day now fixed; at\r\n     least, if so, it was not communicated to me; but as the coming\r\n     Friday of that week would be the anniversary of the attack on Fort\r\n     Sumter, the natural inference was, that on the morning of that day,\r\n     we should witness the opening of the long and anxiously-looked for\r\n     engagement.\r\n\r\n     Sad rumors had come to our camp, that eighteen soldiers who had\r\n     gone out skirmishing within the rebel lines, on Wilmington Island,\r\n     had been captured, and were prisoners within the walls of Pulaski.\r\n     How far this event may have hastened the attack, we know not; but\r\n     on Thursday, the tenth, instead of Friday, the eleventh, the\r\n     bombardment began, and the thunder of our mortars shook the earth\r\n     and rent the heavens with their roar. Pulaski returned the fire\r\n     with a promptness and energy that seemed to bid defiance to our\r\n     batteries. Throughout the whole day, the storm beat unceasingly\r\n     upon the doomed fort, raining shot and shell like hail against its\r\n     walls and upon its ramparts. Solid steel-pointed shot, from\r\n     columbiads and Parrotts, aimed with a precision that indicated not\r\n     only great skill but a knowledge of the point of danger in the\r\n     fort, perforated the walls and buried themselves in the thick and\r\n     heavy masonry. Once, twice, thrice, four times was the rebel flag\r\n     shot away; but as often was it replaced. At seven o'clock in the\r\n     evening, the firing ceased, and there was a lull in the storm,\r\n     only, however, to be renewed again at midnight, and kept up at\r\n     regular intervals until sunrise, when the engagement increased in\r\n     greater vigor than throughout the preceding day.\r\n\r\n     The morning was clear and beautiful, but not calm. A stiff breeze\r\n     came from the East, as if to bear the terrific reports of the\r\n     cannonading to Savannah, whose distant spires and towers gleamed in\r\n     the sun. Our blockading fleet, with accompanying transports, lay at\r\n     anchor in Tybee harbor. Here and there a gunboat, firing occasional\r\n     shots, could be seen moving about in Wilmington sound, while the\r\n     Unadilla, Hale, and Western World occupied their positions in\r\n     Wright and Mud rivers. Tatnall's fleet was no where to be seen, and\r\n     all things in the direction of Savannah seemed as quiet as though\r\n     that city was peacefully and securely reposing, as in other days,\r\n     under the broad folds of the American Union.\r\n\r\n     It was a sad and woful day to the cities of the South, when her\r\n     rebel princes renounced their allegiance to the government, and\r\n     raised the traitor arm of rebellion against its authority. Imagined\r\n     evils, in connection with the Union, were then converted into real\r\n     ones, and these have been augmented a thousand-fold in the\r\n     severance from that Union. When the South shall 'come to\r\n     herself'--if she ever does--like the prodigal son, she will find\r\n     her condition quite as pitiable, and in rags and wretchedness, she\r\n     will seek her father's house, willing, no doubt, to occupy a\r\n     servant's place in the national household. Nor until true and\r\n     genuine repentance shall come to her, can she hope for a father's\r\n     forgiveness and a prodigal's reception and restoration.\r\n\r\n     Boom! boom!! boom!!! as if the last great day of vengeance had\r\n     come, and you could hear the screeching of a thousand fiends in the\r\n     air hastening to their destiny, come upon the ear, as Tybee utters\r\n     her thunders, and pours out her vials of wrath. See that cloud of\r\n     dust which shoots up like a volcano, and looks as though the whole\r\n     east side of the fort had fallen in! Bolts of iron, like winged\r\n     battering-rams, are ploughing fearfully through her belabored side.\r\n     Before this cloud has passed away, you see, just above it, another,\r\n     not dark and angry, but in appearance white and spherical as the\r\n     moon. A shell has exploded, and rained its iron fragments into the\r\n     fort.\r\n\r\n     It is now past meridian of the second day. Pulaski still fires her\r\n     heaviest guns; but at greater intervals. The batteries from Tybee\r\n     have obtained so exact a range that nearly every shot does\r\n     execution. At length a breach is made in the vicinity of the\r\n     magazine. The fate of the fort and all its inmates is now suspended\r\n     upon a single, well-directed shot. There is but a step between the\r\n     besieged and death, and as all hope of raising the siege is\r\n     abandoned, the rebel flag is hauled down, and a white flag of\r\n     submission waves in its stead. Pulaski falls, and the day is ours.\r\n     The hope of Georgia is gone. In vain did the citizens of Savannah\r\n     offer a prize of one hundred thousand dollars for the relief of the\r\n     fort. Had that sum been increased to a million, it would have been\r\n     quite as unavailing. The same inevitable doom awaits all the other\r\n     forts and intrenchments of the rebel confederacy. With some of\r\n     these, the event may be delayed; but the day of doom will come, and\r\n     the broad flag of the Union will float over every inch of territory\r\n     from the hills of the Aroostook to the waters of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n     Just as the fort struck her flag, an incident occurred which was\r\n     somewhat remarkable. A sloop, which had been at anchor in Tybee\r\n     harbor, was broken from her moorings by the violence of the wind,\r\n     and driven by wind and tide, she floated up the Savannah river.\r\n     With her Union down, she passed immediately in front of Pulaski,\r\n     and turned into Wright river, where she was run ashore. Twenty\r\n     minutes earlier, and she would have been blown to atoms by the guns\r\n     of the fort.\r\n\r\n     An almost incredible amount of work has been done by our investing\r\n     army, in accomplishing this glorious result. Rivers and creeks had\r\n     to be sounded, obstructions removed, roads made through swamps on\r\n     marshy islands, where our officers and men had to work day and\r\n     night, often up to their waists in mud and water; heavy Parrotts\r\n     and columbiads had to be carried by hand across these swamps, and\r\n     erected on platforms inundated by rising tides; dykes and ditches\r\n     had to be made, while all the time our men were exposed to the fire\r\n     of the rebel fleet. When all this was accomplished, and\r\n     communication was cut off from Pulaski, then the nearest points on\r\n     Tybee were reached by our forces located on that island, and four\r\n     or five batteries were planted, which, in turn, have done their\r\n     work, and the result shows how wise were the plans and how\r\n     successful was the execution. The stars and stripes now float over\r\n     Pulaski, and may they never again be polluted by the touch of\r\n     traitor hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose persons who 'collect' street literature (there be such) may be\r\npleased with the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTENTOUS PLACARDS.\r\n\r\n_New-York, May, 1862._\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the 'Bill-Poster's Dream,' and of the extracts\r\nfrom Richmond papers containing the prophecies of the handwriting on the\r\nwall relative to the accomplice States of America, few things have so\r\ngenerally attracted pedestrian attention in our down-town streets as two\r\nenormous placards. The first bore the following legend:\r\n\r\nTHERE'S\r\nA TEMPEST\r\nBREWING.\r\n\r\nPersons given to cryptical studies were inclined to consider this an\r\nesoteric form of advertisement, intended to convey to the initiated the\r\ninformation that A.

But having some doubt as to the first\r\n     word in the Greek line, by using which instead of the article 'O,\r\n     the writer has shown not merely unconsciousness of the Greek\r\n     particle, but ignorance of a particle of Greek, I put the first\r\n     Hibernian who passed to the test of reading the sentence, which I\r\n     am forced to say the indignant Milesian scornfully declined.

Wolcott; Tenth Regiment\r\n\r\nNot long ago I happened to be one of a number of fair ladies and brave\r\nmen assembled at what is called a 'surprise-party.' It was my fortune to\r\nbe the attendant cavalier, for the time, of a damsel of romantic\r\ndisposition, and, I fear, of somewhat impaired digestive powers. And she\r\nwas lamenting, not boisterously, but in a subdued, conversational\r\nmanner, that the good old days were gone, 'the days of Chivalry,' when\r\nmy lady had her nice little _boo-dwah_ (for the life of me, I didn't\r\nknow whether that was something nice to eat or to wear; but I have since\r\nlearned that it is something French, and spelt, _b-o-u-d-o-i-r_,) and\r\nwas waited upon by handsome pages, and took her airing on a dappled-gray\r\npalfrey, attended by trusty and obsequious grooms; when Sir Knight,\r\nfollowed by his sturdy henchmen, rode forth in gay and gaudy attire,\r\nwith glittering helmet and cuirass, and entered the lists, and bravely\r\nfought for his fair lady's fame. She spoke with fervid eloquence, and\r\nwith a glibness that betrayed a very recent perusal of the\r\ntournament-scene in _Ivanhoe_. I was about to reply, and say something\r\nin behalf of modern chivalry; but just then a gentleman claimed her hand\r\nfor a quadrille that was forming, and my remarks were cut short.\r\n\r\nIf my readers will bear with me, I will attempt to tell them what I was\r\ngoing to say to my romantic young friend. The days of chivalry are _not_\r\ngone. Let me remark that this assertion does not apply to the blatant,\r\nnigger-driving article that whilom flourished in Dixie, for that is\r\nabout 'played out,' though they still rant and prate about the 'flower\r\nof chivalry.' At Fort Lafayette, there is an herbarium of choice\r\nspecimens (rather faded and seedy) of that curious 'yarb;' and at the\r\nold Alton Penitentiary, and at Camp Douglas, Chicago, there are\r\ncollections, not so choice and a great deal more seedy. Though\r\nSimon--not he of other notoriety, but another man--Simon Bolivar\r\nBuckner, a sweet-scented pink of Southern chivalry; though he must have\r\nhis little fling at us, and call General Grant 'ungenerous and\r\nunchivalrous,' it does not strike me with stunning force that he,\r\ningrate that he is, and traitor to the government that educated him, is\r\nexactly the one to teach us what chivalry is, or how it ought to treat\r\nvanquished rebels. No, the days of chivalry are _not_ gone. While the\r\nbase counterfeit that has so often been thrust upon us by Southern\r\nbraggadocios, and indorsed by Northern sneaks and doughfaces, has been\r\ndetected, and, thank God! is being thrown out as fast as shot and shell\r\ncan knock it out, there never was a greater abundance of the genuine\r\nmetal than there is now and here in this land of ours.\r\n\r\nNot alone in war and warlike deeds does modern chivalry show itself.\r\nThere is a chivalry in religion, that, in spite of the howlings of\r\ncreed-worshipers, dares to throw off the shackles of antiquated and\r\nintolerant dogmas, and believe and teach the religion of humanity, of\r\n'peace on earth and good-will to men.' It is the chivalry in religion\r\nthat has smitten and is daily smiting with its gleaming lance the host\r\nof old prejudices, letting in upon us the glorious golden sunshine,\r\nallowing us to revel in it and to see this world as it is, joyous and\r\nbeautiful. True, some of the old superstitions that burned the witches\r\nlinger in the path, like grim dragons, to frighten us. But they are weak\r\nand toothless, and are fast losing their terrors; and the spirit of\r\nchivalry in religion is marching on, and smiting them one by one, and\r\none by one they fall. But while men are emancipating themselves from the\r\nancient errors, it is sad to see that the same bugbears that infested\r\nthe path of our great grandparents in the pinafore period of their\r\nexistence, are brought to bear upon our children. Especially in\r\nSabbath-school literature is this manifest. Impossible patterns of piety\r\nand propriety are set before a stout, healthy boy, and he, in the flush\r\nof his lusty life, is taught to believe that the only road to paradise\r\nlies through some pulmonary affection. For the sake of all these dear\r\nlittle ones, and for the sake of the Master who loved them so well, do\r\nlet them have some more natural and healthy mental and moral food!\r\n\r\nAnd this leads me to speak of literature in general. And have we not a\r\nchivalry here that is working a revolution? And who is the bravest\r\nknight in the field? Who but our own genial Meister Karl-Mace Sloper?\r\nIsn't it glorious though, the way he rides into the lists, and with his\r\ndiamond-pointed lance pricks the tender skins of the lackadaisical\r\npoetasters and lachrymose prosy-scribblers of our day! Again, O gallant\r\nleader! smite them again. And fall in, ye who wield the pen! Let the\r\nbugles sound the charge, and let our literature be cleared of Laura\r\nMatildas and Martin Firecracker Splutters forever!\r\n\r\nWe approach now a topic that was once nauseating in the extreme, but\r\nwhich is now robbed of many of its disagreeable features--medicine. Let\r\nit be understood in the beginning, disciple of Hahnemann, I am not\r\nupholding you and your pellets of sugar; by no means. But there have\r\nbeen some knights of the pill-box who, without rushing into folly, have\r\nleaped the barriers of ignorance and ancient custom that kept them in an\r\natmosphere odorous of villainous drugs and combinations of drugs, and,\r\nuntrammeled by old traditions, have sought and are seeking milder means\r\nof mitigating our bodily ills. All honor to them. They have driven away\r\nthe old doctor of our childhood, whose most pleasant smile resembled the\r\namiable leer that a cannibal might be supposed to bestow upon a plump\r\nmissionary. The old curmudgeon, with his huge bottles of mixtures and\r\nhis immense boulders--I beg pardon, I should say, _boluses_ of\r\nnastiness--has vanished like a surly ghost at the approach of daylight,\r\nand in his stead we have a gentleman, placid and self-poised, with a\r\nvelvet touch and a face beaming with cheerful smiles. And if they have\r\nnot made the measles a luxury, they have given us a syrup that children\r\nare said to cry for.\r\n\r\nIn the industrial arts, too, there is a spirit of chivalry that is\r\nmarching bravely on, overthrowing old notions. What knight of the olden\r\ntime ever did as much for his ladye fayre as he did for all womanity who\r\nwrought out the problem of the sewing-machine? How many aching hands and\r\neyes and hearts has that little instrument, with its musical\r\n_click-click, click-click_, relieved! No more songs of the shirt, no\r\nmore wearying of hands and curving of spines over the inner vestments of\r\nmankind. We have changed all that. And every stroke of the pioneer's ax,\r\nas he fells the mighty forest-trees, is a blow struck by the honest and\r\nearnest chivalry of labor, battling with wild nature, carving a way for\r\ncivilization's triumphal march. And the cheery whistle of the plowboy,\r\nas he drives his team a-field; the ring of the hammer on the anvil; the\r\nclatter of the busy loom; the scream of the locomotive, as it sweeps\r\nover the land, plunging through the mountains and dashing out across the\r\nprairies--all these are the clarion-notes of modern chivalry's bugles,\r\nringing through the world in joyous and triumphant tones.\r\n\r\nAnd this war--who shall tell; what historic pen can record its grand and\r\nglorious chivalry? Is not every one, from the pale young student, fresh\r\nfrom the breast of _Alma Mater_, to the large-handed and larger-hearted\r\nrustic, with the hay-seed yet in his hair, and the rugged bod-carrier,\r\nredolent of sweat and brick-dust--are not all these, who have come forth\r\nfrom the field and the workshop, the office and the lecture-room, to\r\ndefend the dear old flag, true and gallant knights? There is a boy out\r\nthere in the woods, on picket, slowly pacing his lonely beat, with the\r\ntender-eyed stars for company. And as the silent hours pass by, slowly\r\nhe turns the leaves of memory's record, lingering over its cherished\r\npictures, the home-scenes, the fond father and mother, the dear sister,\r\nand the dearer some-one-else's sister. The snapping of a twig startles\r\nhim, and hastily brushing away a tear--fond memory's tribute--he\r\ninstantly closes the book, and stands, with every sense on the alert,\r\nunflinching, though he knows that each moment may be his last, only\r\nremembering that it is his duty to be faithful, watch well, and fire\r\nlow. And though this boy, fair-haired and beardless, may not have passed\r\nthe stern ordeal of the battle's fierce shock, though his heart softens\r\nat the thought of his far-off home in the North, yet his young soul is\r\nthat of a hero, brave and chivalrous, and in due time his spurs will be\r\nnobly won. Yes, this war is bringing out the grand, heroic traits of our\r\nAmerican character, traits that years of rapid, busy, money-getting life\r\nhave thrown into the background, till it really did seem that we were\r\naltogether sordid and selfish.\r\n\r\nIn the year that I have been in the service, I have seen and heard of\r\nmore individual chivalrous deeds than my romantic and dyspeptic young\r\nfriend will find in all the books, from _Amadis de Gaul_ down. Every day\r\nwitnesses them. Private letters speak of them as ordinary incidents; a\r\nfew get before the public, enjoy a brief newspaper notoriety, and are\r\nforgotten--no, not forgotten entirely; for every brave action lives\r\nsomewhere, though it may not be in an official report. A mother's or a\r\nsister's memory cherishes it, and it is handed down to other\r\ngenerations, an example and an incentive to other brave deeds.\r\n\r\nThen let us have no more sentimental lamentation over the decadence of\r\nchivalry. There is a broad field open to us, for deeds of chivalrous\r\ndaring, now, upon the battle-field, amid the fierce clashing of arms.\r\n\r\n    'And many a darkness into the light shall leap,\r\n    And shine with the sudden making of splendid names.'\r\n\r\nAfterward, when holy peace shall smile again, there are the pulpit and\r\nthe rostrum, the workshop and the forest; and whether we wield the pen,\r\nor the hammer, or the ax, according as we strive to make ourselves and\r\nthe world better, so shall we bear the palm of chivalry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Democratic press made itself convulsively merry over Governor\r\nAndrew, of Massachusetts, for having called out the militia promptly in\r\nthe flurry of May 26th. After fairly exhausting its jeering and sneering\r\non this subject, that portion of the Northern Fourth Estate which would\r\nbe termed Satanic and traitorous were it not too utterly white-livered\r\nand cowardly to be complimented with such forcible indices of even bad\r\ncharacter, had a cruel extinguisher clapped upon it on May 29th, by a\r\nletter to the Boston _Journal_ from Lieutenant-Colonel Harrison Kitchie,\r\nA.D.C., in which Governor Andrew is most effectually vindicated by the\r\nsimple publication of four telegrams received from Secretary\r\nStanton--the first two of which were as follows:\r\n\r\n     [TELEGRAM I.-COPY]\r\n\r\n     'Washington, May 25th, 1862.\r\n\r\n     'To--GOVERNOR ANDREW: Send all the troops forward that you can\r\n     immediately. Banks is completely routed. The enemy are in large\r\n     force advancing upon Harper's Ferry.\r\n\r\n     EDWIN M.

You will please organise and forward\r\n     immediately all the volunteer and militia force in your State.\r\n\r\n     'EDWIN M. STANTON, 'Secretary of War.'\r\n\r\nHow Governor Andrew could have been true to his duty and have acted\r\notherwise than he did after receiving such commands, must be settled by\r\nthose 'gossips of the mob' who, incapable of appreciating the nobility\r\nof a prompt fulfillment of duty, measure every thing military by the\r\namount of melo-dramatic _denouement_ to which it leads. We trust that\r\nafter this effectual 'counter' we may hear a little less carping at\r\nGovernor Andrew, who has shown from the beginning an energy and\r\nperseverance, a promptness in emergency, and a patriotism which, when\r\nthe history of this war comes to be written, will reflect the highest\r\nhonor upon his name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe who sends us the following, is worthy to bear a crow-sier as one of\r\nthe Faithful:\r\n\r\nBOTH BARRELS INTO 'EM:\r\n\r\nIf old Squire Price had any one bump of phrenology developed more than\r\nanother, it was CORVICIDE, or, KILL-CROWATIVENESS. From corn-planting to\r\nhusking-time, from dewy morn until evening more than due, he might be\r\nseen dodging behind fences, crawling around barns, stalking along in the\r\nhigh grass, with a long single-barreled old gun, trying to get a shot at\r\nthe black thieves of crows that were forever at work on his old, sandy\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n'What cause have you, my aged friend,' Brother Hornblower once said to\r\nhim, '_What_ cause have _you_ to molest these birds, as 'toil not,\r\nneither do they spin'?'\r\n\r\n'I tell yer what,' answered the Squire, shaking his head with savage\r\njerks, 'come down to my house ary moruin' airly, you'll hear _caws_!'\r\n\r\nBrother Hornblower smiled grimly and walked gently away, after that, to\r\nget the evening paper at the grocery-post-office. He set his face\r\nagainst jokes--unless they were serious ones.\r\n\r\nWhether it was Brother Hornblower's words, or more crows than usual, the\r\nneighbors around Squire Price's farm were regaled for two days after the\r\nabove talk, with such constant explosions of gunpowder that it was\r\nsurmised the Squire must have bought 'a hull kag o' powder, and got some\r\nfeller to help him shoot.' The consequence of this energy was, that the\r\npersecuted devil's-canaries flew away to other farms where powder was\r\nscarce-first and foremost descending in flocks on Brother Hornblower's\r\nlands, and digging up his young corn--it was in the month of May--until\r\neven _he_ found cause to go at these birds as don't spin; for he found\r\nout that they toiled most laboriously. Being a man of peaceful\r\ndisposition, and opposed to the use of fire-arms, he thought over a plan\r\nby which fire-logs might be used with great advantage to his own\r\nbenefit, by destroying a large number of crows at one fell blow. How he\r\nsucceeded in this _fell_-blow, was told a few evenings afterward in the\r\ngrocery-post-office, by young Tyler, a promising youth who had not, as\r\nthey say of other sad dogs, 'quite got his set yet,' that is, attained\r\ncompletion in figure and carriage. Seated on the edge of a barrel\r\nhalf-filled with corn, and cutting a piece of pine-wood to one sharp\r\npoint only to be followed by another sharp point, he was talking to\r\nanother youth in a desultory manner, about his intentions 'to go by\r\nwater,' in old Bizzle's schooner, next trip she took, when Squire Price\r\ncame in to get his daily newspaper, _The Beantown Democrat_.\r\n\r\n'You bin givin' them crows partikler hail, hain't you, Squire?' asked\r\nTyler the youthful.\r\n\r\n'Wal, about as much as they kin kerry,' answered the Squire. 'They\r\nhain't bin squawkin' round my prem'ses none to speak of lately.'\r\n\r\n'They bin roond Brother Horublower's, thick as pison, though,' said\r\nTyler. 'He counted on killin' 'bout a milyon on 'em yesserday--on-ly he\r\ndidn't quite come it.'\r\n\r\n'Thought he wouldn't never fire no guns at 'em!'\r\n\r\n'Put a couple o' barrils into 'em yesserday.'\r\n\r\n'Why, how you talk! You don't mean it?'\r\n\r\n'Honor bright! He got a big travers on 'em--leastwise, thought he had.\r\nHis brindle kaow, she got pizened night afore last, down there in the\r\nwoods; couldn't do nuthin with her, and she died same night. So he goes\r\nand skins her, and throws her out into that gully down there, back o'\r\nBizzle's wood, and says he to me--for I was over there workin' for\r\nhim--says he, 'There'll be a power o'crows onto her t'morrer, and I\r\ncalc'late I'll fix a few on 'em--I will!' So next mornin'-that was\r\nyesserdoy-we went out bright and airly, and rigged up a kind o' blind at\r\nthe side of the gully, right over the old carcass, Then we got our\r\namminishun all ready--both barrils all loadid.'\r\n\r\n'By jing!' said the Squire, rubbing his hands, 'I wish I'd bin there.'\r\n\r\n'Got all ready. Purty soon up comes one crow, sails round and round,\r\nthen two or three more, then a few more; they begun to smell meat. Then\r\nthey flew lower and lower; bime by one settles onto an old dead cedar\r\nand begins cawin' for dear life. Then down he comes, then more and more\r\nof 'em. Round they come, cawin' and flappin' their wings, clouds of 'em.\r\nGuess there was 'bout two hundred settled onto that old kaow.'\r\n\r\n'Wish I'd bin there with my gun!' spoke the Squire, intensely excited.\r\n'A feller could have made the most biggest kind of a shot.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, we waited, and waited, till the old kaow was black as pitch with\r\n'em. Then Hornblower he nudges me. We got both barrils all ready--big\r\nloads in 'em. 'Fire!' says he. I braced my leg up agin my barril; he\r\nbraced his leg up agin his barril--'\r\n\r\n'W-w-what?' said the Squire.\r\n\r\n'We give the most all-firedest shove--and over we went, barrels, stones,\r\ndirt, and gravil, head-fo'most, spang into them crows and dead kaow! I\r\ntell you, for about five minutes I calc'late I never seed sitch fuss,\r\nfeathers, dirt, and gravil, and kaow-beef flyin' as I did then. Things\r\nwas mixed up most promiscussedly, you can bet yer life on it! Bime by I\r\nsort o' come to, and when I raised up I found I was sittin' onto four\r\ndead, crushed crows, Brother Hornblower, and kaow-meat gin'rally. So I\r\ndug out and lifted up the game--Brother Hornblower first off. When he\r\ncum round a little, says he:\r\n\r\n\"T-T-Tyler, I con-ceive somethin's give way 'bout these parts!'\r\n\r\n\"You air about right in your suppostishuns,' says I; 'the gravil bank's\r\nbusted, and it's a marcy we an't in kingdom kum!'\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk that way,' says he; 'let's go up and fire a cupple barrels\r\nmore into the blastid rebbils, fur vengenz.'\r\n\r\n\"No yer don't, this mornin', as I knows on,' said I; 'I've got enough\r\nshootin craws your fashun. Next time I go shootin' crows 'long any\r\nboddy, I'm goin' to do it Christian-fashun, with gun-barrils, and not\r\nblastid old flour-barrils filled with gravil.

Soe thatt itt often comes to passe thatt whenn walkyng in ye\r\nBroade Waye of New-Yorke, yee can tell a Philadelphienne by hir sober\r\nyet rich garbe, so that ye Cosmopolite sayth: '_Per ma fe!_ thatt is a\r\nladye, I know shee is, by the waye shee lookes.'

Listen!\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: 'Twas in the merry summer-tide, some seven years\r\nsince, when I went with a friend catching trout and sketching scenery in\r\nthe valley of the Connecticut.\r\n\r\nWe thought we knew the value of a lovely view.\r\n\r\nWe didn't.\r\n\r\nTrue, we could appreciate it to a dollar, when transferred to canvas.\r\nOtherwise we had much to learn.\r\n\r\nC. Pia, Esq., and myself were hard at it one morning--making such\r\nbeautiful sketches, and doing it all with nothing but just a\r\nlead-pencil and some paper--as a young admirer of our works was wont to\r\nassure her friends. Suddenly appeared a man of great muscle, with pie\r\ndish shirt-collar, and a canister-shot-eyed bull-terrier, gifted with\r\nseven-tiger power of biting.\r\n\r\n'Stop that are!' was his courteous salutation.\r\n\r\n'Stop what?'\r\n\r\n'Stop making them are d--d picters. I don't have no such doings reound\r\nhere!'\r\n\r\nI looked at C. Pia--he was venomous and unterrified, and I felt\r\nencouraged. So I firmly asked the intruder what he meant.\r\n\r\n'I mean what I say. There's property there that I'm a goin' to buy. I\r\nknow what you're arter. You're makin picters of the place for that are\r\nin-fernal Kernal Smith who owns the land, so's he can show 'em round and\r\npint out the buildin' lots. And I'll jest lick you like ---- if you dror\r\nanother line!'\r\n\r\n'See here, young man,' quoth I, 'I've something to say to you. In the\r\nfirst place you're a scamp who would keep a gentleman from getting a\r\nfair price for his own property. Secondly, you're an ignorant fellow and\r\ndon't know what you're talking about. I never heard of your Colonel\r\nSmith--I'm not drawing up real estate lots or plots of any kind.\r\nThirdly, I solemnly swear by Minos, Alianthus, Rhododendron,\r\nNebuchadnezzar, and all the infernal gods, that if you touch a hair of\r\nour heads I'll see Colonel Smith--I'll map the whole property and\r\nadvertise it in every newspaper in New-York and Boston till it brings\r\nten thousand dollars an acre. Now sail in--dog or no dog--we'll settle\r\n_you_, any how.'\r\n\r\nThe glare of fury in our visitor's eyes died away as he listened to this\r\noration.\r\n\r\n'_Thunder!_' he exclaimed; 'what a lot you city fellers with l'arnin'\r\ninto you _do_ know! Ten thousand dollars an acre! Ad-ver-ti-sin'! What\r\nan idee! I guess I'll buy the land on a morgidge right away. _Hee, hee,\r\nhee_--it's a first-rate notion--and I _a-dopt_ it. Mister, if you want a\r\ndrink o' cider, you can get it at that are red house you see down\r\nyander. Good-mornin'!'\r\n\r\nAnd off he went.\r\n\r\n'You've made that fellow's fortune--when you ought to have caved his\r\nhead in,' remarked C. Pia as the two brutes disappeared.\r\n\r\n'It is the mission of the artist to benefit every body except himself,'\r\nI rejoined. And refilling my pipe I went on with my 'picter.'\r\n\r\nYours truly, GALLI VAN T.\r\n\r\nTruly 'Art is--well--a--it's a great thing, and hath its many lights and\r\nshadows,' as Phoenix or some body once ascertained. And we trust that\r\nGalli Van T. will continue to depict the same in his peculiarly\r\naffecting style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of literature which the war has brought forth, one\r\nof the most piquant is a little pamphlet entitled, _Southern Hatred of\r\nthe American Government, the People of the North, and Free\r\nInstitutions_, recently published by R.F. Wallcut, of Number 221\r\nWashington street, Boston. It consists entirely of selections from the\r\ncolumns of Southern newspapers--all of them rabid, and we may very truly\r\nadd, ridiculous; especially since the fortunes of war have made so much\r\nof their Bobadil bluster appear like the veriest folly. Many of them are\r\nold acquaintances--who, for instance, can have forgotten the following,\r\nfrom the Richmond _Whig_?\r\n\r\n     'This war will test the physical virtues of mere numbers. Southern\r\n     soldiers ask no better odds than one to three Western and one to\r\n     six of the Eastern Yankees. Some go so far as to say that, with\r\n     equal weapons, and on equal grounds, they would not hesitate to\r\n     encounter twenty times their number of the last.'\r\n\r\nAs regards those who go so far, it may be remarked that by this time\r\nthey have illustrated Father O'Leary's remark of the people who, not\r\n'belaving in Purgathory, wint further and fared worse.' But there is\r\nmore of this 'chivalric' spirit in the same article. For instance, it\r\ndoubts 'whether any society since that of Sodom and Gomorrah' [Paris is\r\nentirely too mild an example] 'has been _more thoroughly_ steeped in\r\n_every_ species of vice than that of the Yankees.' Infanticide is hinted\r\nat as prevailing as extensively as in China. The Yankees 'pursue with\r\nenvy and malignity every excellence that shows itself among them\r\nunconnected with money; and a gentleman there stands no more chance of\r\nexistence than a dog does in the Grotto del Cano!'\r\n\r\nThe elegance and refinement of the same editorial from the _Whig_,\r\nappears from the following. A portion, which we omit, is too foully\r\nindecent for republication:\r\n\r\n     ' ... The Yankee women, scraggy, scrawny, and hard as whip-cord,\r\n     breed like Norway rats, and they fill all the brothels of the\r\n     continent.... But they multiply--the only scriptural precept they\r\n     obey--and boast their millions. So do the Chinese; so do the\r\n     Apisdæ, and all other pests of the animal kingdom. Pull the bark\r\n     from a decayed log, and you will see a mass of maggots full of\r\n     vitality, in constant motion and eternal gyration, one crawling\r\n     over one, and another creeping under another, all precisely alike,\r\n     all intently engaged in preying upon one another, and you have an\r\n     apt illustration of Yankee numbers, Yankee equality, and Yankee\r\n     greatness.\r\n\r\n     'We must bring these unfranchised slaves--the Yankees--back to\r\n     their true condition. They have long, very probably, looked upon\r\n     themselves as our social inferiors--as our serfs; their mean,\r\n     niggardly lives--their low, vulgar, and sordid occupations, have\r\n     ground this conviction into them. But of a sudden, they have come\r\n     to imagine that their numerical strength gives them power--_and\r\n     they have burst the bonds of servitude_, and are running riot with\r\n     more than the brutal passions of a liberated wild beast. Their\r\n     uprising has all the characteristics of a _ferocious, fertile\r\n     insurrection_.... They have suggested to us the invasion of their\r\n     territory, and the robbery of their banks and jewelry-stores. We\r\n     may profit by the suggestion, so far as the invasion goes--_for\r\n     that will enable us to restore them to their normal condition of\r\n     vassalage, and teach them that cap in hand is the proper attitude\r\n     of a servant before his master_.'\r\n\r\nThese extracts are from the Richmond _Whig_--a paper beyond all\r\ncomparison the most respectable and moderate in the whole South, and by\r\nno means of so little weight or character that its remarks can be passed\r\nby as mere Southern vaunt and idle bluster signifying nothing. It speaks\r\nthe deep-seated belief and heartfelt conviction of even the most\r\nintelligent secessionists--for the editor of the _Whig_ is not only one\r\nof these, but one of the most honest and upright men to be found in\r\nDixie.\r\n\r\n'But,' the reader may ask, 'if the man really _believes_ that Yankees\r\nare serfs, slaves, vassals of the South, where are his eyes, ears, and\r\ncommon-sense?' Gently, dear reader. When we reflect on the toadying to\r\nthe South by Northern doughface Democrats in by-gone years--when we\r\nrecall the abominable and incredible servility with which every thing\r\nSouthern has been hymned, homaged and exalted--when we remember how\r\nvulgar, arrogant, ignorant Southrons have been adored in doughface\r\nsociety where gentlemen whom they were not worthy of waiting on were of\r\nbut secondary account--when we think of the shallow, pitiful meanness\r\nwhich induces Northern men to rant in favor of that 'institution' which\r\nthey, at least, _know_ is a curse to the whole country--when we see even\r\nnow, how, with a baseness and vileness beyond belief, 'democratic'\r\neditors continue to lick the hands which smite them, we do _not_ wonder\r\nthat the Southerner, taking the doughface for a type of the whole North,\r\ncharacterizes all Yankees as serf-like, servile cap-in-hand crawlers and\r\nbeggars for patronage. For if we were all of the pro-slavery Democracy,\r\nand especially of those who even now continue to yelp for Southern\r\nrights and grinningly assure patriots that 'under the Constitution they\r\ncan do nothing to the South,' we should richly deserve all the scorn\r\nheaped on us by the 'chivalry.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe doubt not that, during this bitter war, many incidents have occurred,\r\nor will occur, quite like that described in the following simple but\r\nlife-true ballad:\r\n\r\n                         FRANK WILSON.\r\n\r\n            'Twas night at the farm-house. The fallen sun\r\n              Shot his last red arrow up in the west;\r\n            Shadows came wolfishly stealing forth,\r\n              And chased the flush from the mountain's crest.\r\n\r\n            Night at the farm-house. The hickory fire\r\n              Laughed and leaped in the chimney's hold,\r\n            And baffled, with its warm mirth, the frost,\r\n              As he pried at the panes with his fingers cold.\r\n\r\n            The chores were finished; and farmer West,\r\n              As he slowly sipped from his foaming mug,\r\n            Toasted his feet in calm content,\r\n              And rejoiced that the barns were warm and snug.\r\n\r\n            Washing the tea-things, with bared white arms,\r\n              And softly humming a love refrain;\r\n            With smooth brown braids, and cheeks of rose,\r\n              Washed and warbled his daughter Jane.\r\n\r\n            She was the gift that his dear wife left,\r\n              When she died, some nineteen Mays before;\r\n            The light and the warmth of the old farm-home,\r\n              And cherished by him to his great heart's core.\r\n\r\n            A sweet, fair girl; yet 'twas not so much\r\n              The fashion of feature that made her so;\r\n            'Twas love's own tenderness in her eyes,\r\n              And on her cheeks love's sunrise glow.\r\n\r\n            Done were the tea-things; the rounded arms\r\n              Again were covered, the wide hearth brushed;\r\n            Then from the mantle she took some work,\r\n              'Twas a soldier's sock, and her song was hushed.\r\n\r\n            Her song was hushed; for tenderer thoughts\r\n              Than ever were bodied in word or sound,\r\n            Trembled like stars in her downcast eyes,\r\n              As she knit in the dark yarn round and round.\r\n\r\n            A neighbor's rap at the outer door\r\n              Was answered at once by a bluff 'Come in!'\r\n            And he came, with stamping of heavy boots,\r\n              Frost-wreathed brow and muffled chin.\r\n\r\n            Come up to the fire!

'Twas another man--\r\n              There were two Frank Wilsons in Company K.'\r\n\r\n            The one church-bell in the distant town\r\n              Chimes softly forth for twelve o'clock;\r\n            Another clang of the door-yard gate,\r\n              A sudden hush in the tender talk.\r\n\r\n            She flies to meet him--the transformed child!--\r\n              Her heart keeps time to her ringing tread;\r\n            'O father! he's come!' and she needs no more\r\n              To pinch her cheeks to make them red.\r\n\r\n            MARIE MIGNIONETTE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA friend who doth such things has kindly jotted down for us the\r\nfollowing 'authentics':\r\n\r\n     Sometimes I have thought that the reply our Irish girl gave the\r\n     other day, was of the nature of her usual blunders, and again that\r\n     it meant a good deal. On her return from a funeral, where a man,\r\n     who had previously lost his wife, had buried his only child, an\r\n     infant a few weeks old, I asked her how the father appeared?\r\n\r\n     'Oh! he was a dale sorry; but I guess _he's glad to get rid of\r\n     it_!'\r\n\r\n     _It was only a_ WAY _he had._--Whiggles, on being told that a boy\r\n     down-town, only sixteen years old, weighed six hundred and fifty\r\n     pounds, was further enlightened by the information that he weighed\r\n     that amount of coal on a platform Fairbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southern press has proposed that, even in case of defeat, the\r\nwealthy class shall retire to their plantations, 'live comfortably' on\r\nwhat they can raise, let cotton go for two years, and thereby starve\r\nEurope and the North into a conviction that Cotton is King.\r\n\r\nBut how will the poor whites of the South like this? What is to become\r\nof _them_? Or what, indeed, is to become of us, if no cotton be\r\nforthcoming? The truth is, and every day makes it more apparent, _the\r\nraising of cotton must pass into other hands_. The _army_ has its\r\nrights--the right to land-grants--and the _only_ effectual means of\r\nputting an end to our dependence on the South will be found in settling\r\nsoldiers in the cotton country. Texas would be, perhaps, best suited for\r\nthe purpose, and other regions may be selected as opportunity may\r\nsuggest. With this course fully determined on, it would hardly be\r\nnecessary to further agitate Emancipation, it would come of itself, and\r\nslave-labor would yield to the energy of the free Northern farmer.\r\n\r\nVery little has been said as yet on this subject of properly rewarding\r\nour troops. But it is destined to rise into becoming the great question\r\nof the day; and if the Democratic pro-slavery party sets itself in\r\nopposition to it, it will be ground to powder. Events are tending to\r\nthis issue with irresistible and tremendous power, and the days of\r\nplanterdom are numbered.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This anecdote has frequently gone the rounds in an\r\nabbreviated form.

It was started at a period when\r\nany new literary enterprise was deemed almost foolhardy, but the\r\npublisher believed that the time had arrived for just such a Magazine.\r\nFearlessly advocating the doctrine of ultimate and gradual Emancipation,\r\nfor the sake of the UNION and the WHITE MAN, it has found favor in\r\nquarters where censure was expected, and patronage where opposition only\r\nwas looked for. While holding firmly to _its own opinions_, it has\r\nopened its pages to POLITICAL WRITERS of _widely different views_, and\r\nhas made a feature of employing the literary labors of the _younger_\r\nrace of American writers. How much has been gained by thus giving,\r\npractically, the fullest freedom to the expression of opinion, and by\r\nthe infusion of fresh blood into literature, has been felt from month to\r\nmonth in its constantly increasing circulation.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of our Statesmen have furnished THE CONTINENTAL many of\r\nits political articles, and the result is, it has not given labored\r\nessays fit only for a place in ponderous encyclopedias, but fresh,\r\nvigorous, and practical contributions on men and things as they exist.\r\n\r\nIt will be our effort to go on in the path we have entered, and as a\r\nguarantee of the future, we may point to the array of live and brilliant\r\ntalent which has brought so many encomiums on our Magazine. The able\r\npolitical articles which have given it so much reputation will be\r\ncontinued in each issue, and in this number is commenced a new Serial by\r\nRichard R. Kimball, the eminent author of the 'Under-Currents of Wall\r\nStreet,' 'St. Leger,' etc., entitled,\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\nAn account of the Life and Conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading\r\nmen in the mercantile community, and 'a bright and shining light' in the\r\nChurch, recounting what he did, and how he made his money. This work\r\nwhich will excel the previous brilliant productions of this author.\r\n\r\n     The UNION--The Union of ALL THE STATES--that indicates our\r\n     politics. To be content with no ground lower than the highest--that\r\n     is the standard of our literary character.\r\n\r\nWe hope all who are friendly to the spread of our political views, and\r\nall who are favorable to the diffusion of a live, fresh, and energetic\r\nliterature, will lend us their aid to increase our circulation. There is\r\nnot one of our readers who may not influence one or two more, and there\r\nis in every town in the loyal States some native person whose time might\r\nbe profitably employed in procuring subscribers to our work.
