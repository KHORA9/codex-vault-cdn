He assures me it is not\r\nintended for publication, but only for your perusal and for such\r\nfriends of the family as may now or hereafter deem it interesting to\r\nknow something of those of the family who have preceded them.\r\n\r\nIn Washington county, in the state of Maryland, near the little stream\r\nof Antietam creek, where was fought one of the memorable battles of our\r\nCivil War, there is located a quaint, old fashioned village called\r\nSharpsburg. The inhabitants of the village and neighborhood were in a\r\nlarge part Germans or of German descent.\r\n\r\nOn one corner of the public square there still remains, in fairly good\r\nrepair, an old fashioned stone dwelling house. In this house on the\r\nfirst day of April, A.D. 1829, I was born, as were also my two older\r\nbrothers, Joseph Gabriel and John Daniel, born respectively June 25,\r\n1826, and November 30, 1827. This stone house at one time belonged to\r\nmy grandfather, Gabriel Nourse, who was the son of James Nourse. The\r\nancestors of the latter are given in a book now in the possession of\r\nyour mother, entitled _James Nourse and his Descendants_.\r\n\r\nIn the basement or first story of this stone building my father taught\r\nschool about the time of the birth of his three boys, given above. At\r\nthat early day the people of the village and surrounding country were\r\nnot supposed to be very highly educated. If children were taught to\r\nread and write indifferently and something of arithmetic, at least as\r\nfar as the single rule of three, their education was supposed to be\r\nsufficient for the practical purposes of life. My father has related to\r\nme that when he first commenced teaching in the village, in the\r\npresence of such a company as usually assembles around a country store,\r\na wise man of the village explained to his admiring hearers that the\r\ncause of the changes of the moon resulted from the fact that the earth\r\ncame between the sun and the moon and hence obstructed the light in\r\nsuch a way as to produce the new moon and the various changes until the\r\nfull moon. My father rashly attempted to suggest that the wise man was\r\nmistaken, for the obvious reason that the moon in its first quarter\r\ncould be seen in the heavens at the same time as the sun could be\r\nobserved, and it was impossible that the moon could be partially\r\ndarkened by the shadow of the earth. The wise man was rather mortified\r\nby this exposure of his ignorance, but did not acknowledge his error,\r\nbut angrily reproved a young man for presuming to differ with him.\r\n\r\nIn this stone building also my grandfather, Gabriel, died in April,\r\n1839, and was buried in the village churchyard. This stone house is\r\nstill standing at the date of this writing, and the basement room where\r\nmy father taught school is occupied as a store-room for vending relics\r\nand curiosities gathered from the battle-fields of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThree miles from the village of Sharpsburg, on the Virginia side of the\r\nPotomac river, there is another quaint, old fashioned village called\r\nShepherdstown. Here my mother, Susan Cameron, was born October 25,\r\n1803, and was married to my father, Charles Nourse, June 10, 1825. Here\r\nin this village my mother died October 10, 1835. There is still\r\nstanding in this town the old Methodist church, surrounded by a village\r\nchurchyard, where will be found modest tombstones marking the graves of\r\nmy mother, and of many of her brothers and sisters, and also her\r\nmother, Susan Cameron, who died at Shepherdstown, Virginia, July 20,\r\n1855. My mother's father's name was Daniel Cameron, born in Scotland,\r\nOctober, 1753. His wife was also of Scotch descent. Her family name was\r\nClinton, which name was bestowed upon me, and in honor of my\r\ngrandmother and to please her I have always been known in the family by\r\nthe name of Clinton, my first name being Charles, so named after my\r\nfather. My father, Charles Nourse, was born at Frankfort, Kentucky,\r\nApril 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nSeveral years before my mother's death my father had removed from\r\nSharpsburg to Frederick City, Maryland, where he taught school for\r\nseveral years, and while living there, to-wit, August 9, 1833, your\r\nmother's mother was born.\r\n\r\nMy recollections of my mother are not very distinct, as I was only six\r\nyears old at the time of her death. Only one incident of my early\r\nchildhood I call to mind very clearly. I had been induced by my older\r\nbrothers and some neighbor boys, whilst playing in the market square at\r\nFrederick City, to attempt to imitate them in the use of chewing\r\ntobacco, which resulted in making me very sick. Whilst lying upon the\r\ntrundle bed in the room upstairs of the house where we resided, I\r\nvomited very freely, and as I lay back upon my pillow, pale and weak\r\nfrom the effort, I remember a kind face of one stooping over me and\r\nsympathizing deeply, not knowing the cause of my illness, and I\r\nremember how guilty I felt at being the object of so much undeserved\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nThe last two years of our residence in Maryland we lived at a little\r\nvillage at the foot of the Blue Ridge mountains called Burkettsville,\r\nand during part of these two years my grandmother Cameron kept house\r\nfor us and had charge of her four grandchildren. I remember her very\r\ndistinctly, the most affectionate and patient woman it was ever my\r\nfortune to know.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1841, my father, with his four children then living, took\r\nthe old fashioned stage-coach at Boonesboro, Maryland, crossing the\r\nAllegheny mountains, coming on to Wheeling, crossing the Ohio river,\r\nand thence via Zanesville and Somerset, Ohio, to the little village of\r\nEast Rushville in Fairfield county, Ohio. After teaching school in East\r\nRushville during the summer of that year, my father with myself and\r\nsister Susan removed to Lancaster, the county seat of Fairfield county,\r\nOhio, leaving my two older brothers as heavy clerks in country\r\nstores--my brother Joseph with a man named Clayton and my brother John\r\nwith a man named Paden, in two separate villages in the county of\r\nFairfield. My father taught school in Lancaster, Ohio, for four years,\r\nI think most of the time for a compensation of $300 a year. As this sum\r\nwas hardly sufficient to support him and his two children at a\r\nrespectable boarding house, it became necessary for me to relieve the\r\nsituation and to start out in the world for myself. My first attempt\r\nwas in a country store at East Rushville with a man by the name of\r\nCoulson. After four months heavy clerking with this man, he failed in\r\nbusiness and sold out his stock of remnants, and I returned to\r\nLancaster to my father. After a few months I again attempted to do\r\nbusiness in support of myself, and I hired out to another village\r\nstore-keeper, without any fixed compensation further than that I was to\r\nhave my board and clothes for my services. My duties consisted of\r\nweighing out groceries, taking in eggs, butter, and feathers, and\r\npacking and preparing for shipment the butter and eggs, for which there\r\nwas not sufficient local market. I also sold goods through business\r\nhours, made fires both in the store and for the family, sawed wood,\r\nmilked the cow, and in the fall and winter fed, curried, and cared for\r\na half dozen horses that were shipped in the spring for the eastern\r\nmarket. At the end of sixteen months of this kind of service my\r\nemployer advised me and also my father that I would never make a\r\nmerchant. I had positively refused to conform to his instructions in\r\ndoing business in the manner in which he thought was most for his\r\ninterest. He was engaged also at that time in buying leaf tobacco that\r\nwas raised in the Hocking hills, for which he paid about one-third\r\ncash, one-third on short time, and one-third in goods out of the store.\r\nHe had three prices or more for nearly everything he had to sell,\r\ndepending, of course, on the character of his customer and the kind of\r\npay he was to receive. For instance: his cash customers, of whom there\r\nwere very few, received four pounds of coffee for a dollar. His long\r\ncredit customers, of whom there were many, received three pounds of\r\ncoffee for a dollar, whilst his trade customers, especially those who\r\ntook goods out of the store for tobacco, received two and a half pounds\r\nof coffee for a dollar. It was not easy for a young boy, or as young a\r\nboy as I was at that time, always to understand the exact standing of\r\nthe customers, and it was necessary to watch carefully the old man who\r\nwas proprietor of the store, who indicated by signs upon his fingers,\r\nwhich I too frequently misunderstood, just exactly how much coffee for\r\na dollar a customer was entitled to. One remarkable incident of the\r\nmanner in which my employer did business I remember very distinctly.\r\nDuring the day our little store was crowded with customers who had sold\r\ntobacco to our employer and had to take their pay in part out of the\r\nstore. A young man by the name of Johnnie, who was a year or two older\r\nthan myself and a favorite with the proprietor of the store, had during\r\nthe day sold to a German woman a large red and yellow cotton\r\nhandkerchief for the sum of thirty-seven and a half cents that was\r\nmarked twelve and a half cents and had cost us eight and a third cents.\r\nThe next day she returned with one of her neighbors who also had to\r\ntake her pay out of the store for tobacco, and she wanted another of\r\nthose red and yellow cotton handkerchiefs, which Johnnie sold her of\r\ncourse at the same price. In the evening Johnnie and myself had to go\r\nover to the old gentleman's residence before we retired for the night\r\nand attend family prayers. During the evening the old gentleman recited\r\nJohnnie's exploits in selling those cotton handkerchiefs for three\r\ntimes the marked price, and then chuckled gleefully, praising Johnnie\r\nfor his success and how he would make a merchant, but that I would\r\nnever learn; and then turning to his eldest daughter he said: \"Hand me\r\nthe bible, dear, we will have prayers.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst living with this old gentleman I became thoroughly disgusted\r\nwith mercantile life, as I then saw it and witnessed it, and cast about\r\nin my own mind seriously to know what I should do for the future. I\r\nrealized that I neglected my opportunities whilst attending school\r\nunder my father's instructions, and I resolved, as far as I could under\r\nthe circumstances, to supply the omission. I got out my old Kirkham's\r\ngrammar and my arithmetic and algebra, and spent many of my nights\r\nafter the store closed in study. At the end of sixteen months of this\r\nlife I returned again to my father, who was still at Lancaster. During\r\nthe last year that I lived at Lancaster I assisted my father in his\r\nschool, teaching the younger children, and still to a limited extent\r\npursuing my own studies.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1844 my father determined to remove to Kentucky, leaving\r\nmy sister Susan, your mother's mother, with Mrs. Catherine Sumner, a\r\nmost excellent Presbyterian lady with whom my father had boarded for\r\nseveral years during his stay in Lancaster. My father first stopped at\r\nMillersburg, Bourbon county, and took up school, but only remained\r\nthere a few months, having in the meantime heard of a vacancy in the\r\nposition of principal of the public school in Lexington. Having secured\r\nthis position at a salary then of only $600 a year, we removed to\r\nLexington in the early part of 1845.\r\n\r\nI became one of the assistant teachers in this school at a salary of\r\ntwenty dollars a month for the first year, but subsequently was\r\npromoted to the position of first assistant at a salary of thirty\r\ndollars per month, and continued to occupy that position until the fall\r\nof 1849, when I secured, by courtesy of the city council of the city of\r\nLexington, the favor of entering the law school of Transylvania\r\nUniversity, the city having a number of scholarships in that\r\ninstitution at its gratuitous disposal. During the four years that I\r\ntaught school as an assistant in the city school, I still pursued my\r\nown private studies at night, reciting to my father in the morning\r\nbefore school hours, until about the year 1848, when I had saved money\r\nenough from my meager salary to procure some text books of the law, and\r\ncommenced reading law. In the meantime I had formed the acquaintance of\r\na young lawyer, Abraham S. Drake, who became a very devoted friend of\r\nmine and superintended my reading, giving me such instructions as were\r\nnecessary. My situation as a teacher in the public school in Lexington\r\nwas very trying upon my health. I had an average of about fifty small\r\nchildren in a small room not more than twenty feet square, about six\r\nhours a day except Saturday, and had to occupy myself with my private\r\nstudies when I ought to have had the privilege of and needed exercise\r\nin the open air. I had some satisfaction, however, in the success of my\r\nscholars, making it a specialty to teach them the art of reading well\r\nand reading aloud, an art which in the subsequent years I have found\r\nour public schools are sadly neglecting. I hope, dear Joe, you will\r\nsucceed while you are going to school in learning to read, that being a\r\nneglected and almost a lost art in this day and generation.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1846, my father returned to Lancaster, Ohio, and married\r\nMiss Hetty Herron, an adopted child of Mrs. Catherine Sumner's with\r\nwhom my sister Susan had been living. Returning to Lexington, he\r\ncontinued teaching until 1850, when he removed to Millersburg,\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1849 I entered the senior class of the law department of\r\nTransylvania University, and in March, 1850, graduated and received my\r\ndiploma from that school. My preceptors were two very able judges of\r\nthe supreme court of Kentucky, to-wit, Judge Robinson and Judge\r\nMarshall. I had first taken up the idea of becoming a lawyer during my\r\nresidence in Lancaster, Ohio, where I frequently spent my Saturdays in\r\nattendance upon the courts, listening with great interest to the\r\nspeeches and discussions of the eminent men who constituted the bar at\r\nthat place, among them Henry Stansbury, afterwards Attorney General of\r\nthe United States, Thomas Ewing, afterwards Secretary of the Treasury\r\nof the United States during General Harrison's administration, Hocking\r\nH. Hunter, afterwards one of the judges of the supreme court of Ohio.\r\nWhilst residing in Lexington, Kentucky, I pursued the same course,\r\nvisiting the courts whenever opportunity offered, hearing such men as\r\nHenry Clay and Thomas F. Marshall, and other distinguished lawyers of\r\nKentucky, arguing their cases.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I had joined the Methodist Episcopal church on\r\nprobation, and made the acquaintance of Miss Rebecca A. McMeekin.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1850, after my graduation in the law department of\r\nTransylvania University, I determined to visit Ohio. I had some idea of\r\nsettling in that state, as my two brothers who remained in Ohio were\r\nthen in business in Fairfield county, my oldest brother Joseph having\r\ncommenced the mercantile business on his own account at New Salem,\r\nOhio, and my brother John had commenced the practice of medicine in the\r\nvillage of New Baltimore in the same county. Before leaving Lexington,\r\nhowever, I felt it due to myself and to Miss McMeekin to explain to her\r\nmy frequent visits to her house. I wrote her a letter telling her of my\r\nhopeless condition financially and of the uncertain prospects of my\r\nsuccess in my profession, but protesting my affection for her and my\r\ngood faith in the attentions that I had paid her, and asking her to\r\ndecide our future for herself. She made no reply in writing, but in my\r\nnext visit to her she simply expressed her faith in my ultimate success\r\nin my profession, and her entire willingness to risk the future, so\r\nthat when I left Lexington for Ohio, which I did in April, 1850, I was\r\nsimply engaged to be married.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Lancaster I entered the office of John D. Martin, an\r\neminent lawyer of that place, in pursuance of a previous correspondence\r\nwith him. He had been a particular friend of my father and an assistant\r\nto him in his school during my father's residence in Lancaster in\r\n1842-3. He already had his nephew, Charles Martin, as an assistant in\r\nhis office and could not offer me any compensation or any work. After\r\ntwo months I found it necessary to do something to replenish my\r\nexhausted finances. I first took a select school in Millersport a small\r\ntown on the canal a few miles north of New Baltimore. After teaching\r\nhere for three months I took the winter school in New Baltimore at a\r\nsalary of $30 a month. In the meantime, through the acquaintances of my\r\nbrother Joseph, located at New Salem, and my brother John, located at\r\nNew Baltimore, I became known throughout that part of the country as an\r\nembryo lawyer. Although not admitted regularly to the practice of law,\r\nin the courts of record, I had the right to practice before the\r\njustices of the peace of the county, and during that summer I tried\r\nsome seventeen cases before these inferior courts. I still continued my\r\nstudies of the law, using very frequently a book known there as\r\n_Swan's Treatise_, compiled for the benefit of the justices of the\r\npeace of the state by Judge Swan, of Ohio. This book also contained\r\nmany references to the supreme court decisions of the state, and I was\r\naccustomed after school hours to walk to Lancaster and borrow these\r\nreports from my friend, Mr. Martin, frequently taking them home and\r\nusing them upon the trial of my cases, which always occurred on\r\nSaturdays when I had no school.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Ohio, I read carefully and with much profit to\r\nmyself, the daily reports of the proceedings of the state convention\r\nthat was then forming a new constitution for that state.\r\n\r\nMany eminent lawyers were members of the convention, among them Mr.\r\nStansbury, afterwards Attorney General of the United States, and Mr.\r\nRaney, afterwards Judge of the supreme court of the state of Ohio.\r\nOccasionally the learned men of the convention indulged their sense of\r\nhumor, and among other incidents of the debates I recall the following:\r\n\r\nAmong other members of the convention there was an uneducated man by\r\nthe name of Sawyer. Mr. Stansbury, of the committee on the judiciary,\r\nreported a provision relating to the powers of certain courts,\r\nauthorizing them to issue writ of habeas corpus, procedendo, quo\r\nwarranto, and mandamus.\r\n\r\nMr. Sawyer objected to these Latin terms being in the constitution on\r\nthe ground that many of his constituents could not understand the\r\nmeaning of such terms and he wanted the committee to put the words into\r\nEnglish language, and also asked for an explanation of the meaning of\r\nthese words.\r\n\r\nMr. Stansbury very courteously explained that the difficulty was not in\r\nthe use of the terms proposed, but it was because his friend did not\r\nunderstand the nature of these writs. For the benefit of Mr. Sawyer he\r\nexplained their meaning, but suggested that the use of any English\r\nterms or words would not make the character of the writs any better\r\nunderstood to those who are not familiar with the law. He said that the\r\nliteral meaning of the words \"habeas corpus\" was to have the body, and\r\nthe writ was issued in case any one complained of being illegally\r\nimprisoned, or restrained of their personal liberty, and was intended\r\nfor the purpose of having the body of the person in whose behalf the\r\nwrit was issued brought before the court, in order that the cause of\r\nhis restraint or imprisonment might be inquired into and its legality\r\nor illegality be determined; that to call the writ, a writ to have the\r\nbody, would not make the term any more intelligent than to use the\r\nwords \"habeas corpus.\"\r\n\r\nThat the word \"procedendo\" simply meant to proceed or go ahead, and was\r\na name of a writ that was issued by the appellate court to an inferior\r\ntribunal, authorizing them to proceed in accordance with the opinion of\r\nthe appellate court. Out of respect to the character of a man who had\r\nbecome famous in the west, of an early day, he would suggest to his\r\nfriend Sawyer that this writ might be called a writ of \"David Crocket,\"\r\nas it was a favorite motto of that individual to \"Be sure you are right\r\nand then go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThat the literal meaning of the words \"quo warranto\" was, \"Why do you\r\ndo it?\" It was a writ issued by some superior court to an inferior\r\ncourt or tribunal, corporation or officer, to ascertain by what\r\nauthority they exercised certain powers; that the only term in English\r\nthat would express the particular character of the writ would be the\r\nwords, \"Why do you do it?\"\r\n\r\nThe writ of \"mandamus\" was a writ issued by the court commanding some\r\ninferior tribunal or officer to do and perform certain duties which\r\nwere required by law and which he had refused to perform. That the only\r\nwords in the English language that would properly define the character\r\nof this writ would be, \"Do it, damn you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to add that Mr. Sawyer gave the convention no\r\nfurther trouble in regard to the Latin names of these writs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY EXPERIENCES IN IOWA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1850 I had determined to seek a location for the\r\npractice of law in some western state. I first thought of migrating to\r\nOregon, but gave up that idea for the reason that I feared if I\r\ntraveled that far from my intended I might never have the means to go\r\nback to Kentucky to claim her. So, finally, I fixed upon the idea of\r\nremoving to Iowa. Before deciding this important question, however, I\r\nwrote to my intended wife explaining to her the situation and again\r\ncalling her attention to the uncertainties of the future. As she was\r\ntwo years older than myself I felt that it was hardly justice to her to\r\ninsist upon our engagement if she felt that my future was too\r\nuncertain. I received in answer to this letter a kind assurance that\r\nher faith would not fail, and she cited that beautiful passage of\r\nscripture containing the answer of Ruth to Naomi: \"Entreat me not to\r\nleave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou\r\ngoest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people\r\nshall be my people, and thy God my God: where thou diest, will I die,\r\nand there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if\r\naught but death part thee and me.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1851 I returned to Kentucky for a short visit, my brother\r\nJoseph having loaned me fifty dollars in money and trusted me for a new\r\nsuit of clothes. In the meantime my father had removed to Millersburg,\r\nKentucky, and commenced teaching there, a branch of what I think was\r\nknown as Johnson's Military Academy, the principal school being at Blue\r\nLicks, Kentucky, in charge of James G. Blaine, afterwards a republican\r\ncandidate for President of the United States. The lady he afterwards\r\nmarried also assisted my father, and received visits from Mr. Blaine on\r\nSaturdays and Sundays. It was whilst residing here that my sister Susan\r\nbecame acquainted with your grandfather, William Vimont, whom she\r\nmarried in January, 1853.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Old Stone House on Public Square,\r\n  Sharpsburg, Md._\r\n  Birthplace of Charles Clinton Nourse]\r\n\r\nIt was the latter part of May, 1851, when I started west \"to grow up\r\nwith the country.\" We had then no railroads reaching the Mississippi\r\nriver from the east, and I took the steamer at Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nfor St. Louis, Missouri. At St. Louis I took the steamer for Iowa, not\r\nyet determined as to my landing. The waters of the river were at flood\r\ntide, and on our passage up we saw frame houses floating past us. I\r\nlanded in Burlington the last day of May, and stopped at the Barrett\r\nHouse. I was not acquainted with a single person in the state of Iowa,\r\nhad no relative, kindred, or friend to whom I could apply for advice or\r\nassistance. After a hearty dinner I retired to my room, took a chair,\r\nput my feet up on my trunk, and held a consultation with myself. The\r\nquestion before the house was, what to do next. I had with me a general\r\nletter of recommendation from Professor Dodd, then president of\r\nTransylvania University, and a particular friend of my father, and\r\nanother from Dr. T. O. Edwards of Lancaster, Ohio, an ex-member of\r\ncongress from that state, and also my letter as a member of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church, and my diploma signed by the law faculty\r\nand trustees of Transylvania University. After proper consideration I\r\ninquired of the landlord of the hotel where I could find a Methodist\r\npreacher, as I was satisfied there must be such a person in the city.\r\nHe directed me to the parsonage. I called upon the minister and made\r\nhis acquaintance, the Reverend Mr. Dennis, who afterwards obtained some\r\nnotoriety as a pastor in Kansas at the time of the Kansas troubles. He\r\nwas a tall, white haired man of pleasant countenance and affable\r\nmanners. I showed him my papers and told him my object in calling upon\r\nhim was, through him, to make the acquaintance of some of the leading\r\nlawyers of the city from whom I could obtain information and determine\r\nwhat part of the state I would attempt to locate in. At that time the\r\nsupreme court of the state of Iowa was in session in Burlington,\r\nconsisting of Joseph Williams, Chief Justice, George Greene and John F.\r\nKinney, justices. Mr. Dennis informed me that the judges were boarding\r\nat the same hotel, the Barrett House, and he made an appointment to go\r\nwith me to their consultation room that afternoon and introduce me. We\r\nmade the visit and I found the judges of the court very cordial, and at\r\ntheir request I produced my diploma from the law school, told them who\r\nI was and where I was from, and that I desired some information in\r\nregard to the best possible location for a young attorney. They\r\nrequested me to call at their courtroom the next morning at the opening\r\nof the court, and they would have me admitted to the practice of law in\r\ntheir court and throughout the state. The next morning I went to the\r\ncourt, and at the request of Judge Kinney, Mr. Dickson, of Keokuk, who\r\nwas then in attendance at the court, made a motion for my admission to\r\nthe bar, and suggested the appointment of a committee to examine me as\r\nto my qualifications. The Chief Justice announced that an examination\r\nwas unnecessary--the court had already examined the applicant and was\r\nentirely satisfied with his qualifications, and requested me to come\r\nforward and take the oath of office, which I did. I made the\r\nacquaintance of the clerk of the court, then \"Old Timber,\" as we\r\nafterwards called him, his real name being James Woods. That evening\r\nJudge Kinney asked me to take a walk with him, and told me he had a\r\nbrother-in-law, Augustus Hall, living at Keosauqua, Iowa, who was\r\ndesirous of having a young lawyer associated with him in his office,\r\nand if I would go to Keosauqua he would give me a letter of\r\nintroduction. I ascertained that the stage fare to Keosauqua would be\r\nsix dollars. Upon taking an inventory of my pocket-book I found I only\r\nhad about eight dollars left of the money my brother had loaned me. I\r\nhad with me two trunks, one full of my law books, the other containing\r\nmy clothing, etc. I interviewed the landlord and told him my situation\r\nfinancially, and proposed to him that I would leave my books in his\r\ncustody as I was still uncertain where I should settle, and leave my\r\nbill unpaid, if agreeable to him, until such time as I could send for\r\nmy books. He readily agreed to the arrangement, but proposed that I\r\nshould take my books and he would risk my sending the amount of my\r\nbill, which, however, I declined to do. The next morning Judge Kinney\r\ncalled me to one side, kindly suggesting that it was not unusual for\r\nyoung men to visit Iowa for the purpose of locating who were short of\r\nfunds, and he would be glad to loan me a small amount if I would accept\r\nit. This kindness I also declined. I had no doubt that he had been\r\nadvised by the landlord of my situation, and he was kind enough to\r\nattempt to help me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I took the stage-coach for Keosauqua, but owing to the\r\ncondition of the roads, and particularly of Skunk river, I was taken to\r\nKeokuk where I had to stay all night. After paying my bill the next\r\nmorning I found I had only twenty cents left. The next day the\r\nstage-coach took me to The Divide, as we called it, as far as Utica\r\npostoffice in Van Buren county, and there left me. The hack that should\r\nhave taken me from there to Keosauqua had already gone before our\r\narrival. I could not stay here all night because I had no money to pay\r\nany bill, so I left my one trunk in charge of the postoffice to be sent\r\nto Keosauqua the next day on the hack, and I started to walk, then\r\nabout ten miles, to reach Keosauqua. I had not walked far before I\r\nfound that I had sprained my ankle slightly in jumping from the coach\r\nthat morning. The walking became very painful, but I managed to reach\r\nKeosauqua about sundown that evening. The first building that looked\r\nlike a hotel or public house was a frame building that stood southeast\r\nof the court house. The high waters of the Des Moines river had flooded\r\nthe lower part of the town, and I found this house was a boarding\r\nhouse, at that time full of guests. I inquired for the lady of the\r\nhouse and took my seat on a bench on the porch near the front door.\r\nPresently the lady of the house appeared, and looking at me very\r\ninquiringly wanted to know who I was, where I was from, what was my\r\nbusiness, and where I was going. I was a sorry looking subject, having\r\nwaded through the mud for ten miles, and I presume I looked as I\r\nfelt--very tired. I gave her my real name, told her I had no business,\r\nthat I did not know where I was going, and that I had come from Keokuk\r\nthat day. She told me her house was full and she did not believe she\r\ncould accommodate me with a night's lodging. I then asked her very\r\npolitely for permission to remain upon the porch until I was\r\nsufficiently rested so I could go further down town and obtain lodging,\r\nbut I asked her about the town, its population, and about the high\r\nwaters. The lady turned out to be Mrs. Obed Stannard, the mother of Ed\r\nStannard, afterwards Lieutenant Governor of Missouri, and a very\r\nsuccessful business man of St. Louis. She was a good talker, and after\r\nconversing with her about twenty minutes I got up to leave, thanking\r\nher very cordially for her kindness in permitting me to rest on the\r\nporch. She relented and told me she thought if I would stay that she\r\ncould find accommodations for me. I told her no, that I could not put a\r\nlady to any inconvenience when it was unnecessary and I must go, so I\r\nleft and went down to the front street in the town to the Keosauqua\r\nHouse, kept then by \"Father Shepherd,\" as we always called him, with\r\nwhom I boarded until after I was married in 1853.\r\n\r\nKeosauqua, at that time, as indeed it has been ever since, was a small\r\ntown of about 1,500 inhabitants, the county seat of Van Buren county,\r\nlocated on the Des Moines river. It possessed one of the best bars of\r\nthe state, and among its inhabitants were men who afterwards became\r\ndistinguished in the history of the state. The men more actively\r\nengaged in practice were George G. Wright, for many years afterwards a\r\njudge of the supreme court of the state, Joseph C. Knapp, judge of the\r\ndistrict court of that district and afterwards United States District\r\nAttorney, and Augustus Hall, afterwards a member of congress from that\r\ndistrict and appointed by Mr. Buchanan United States District Judge in\r\nNebraska. The courts of this county were also visited by J. C. Hall,\r\nafterwards one of the judges of the supreme court. The pastor of the\r\nMethodist church at that time was Henry Clay Dean, who afterwards\r\nbecame chaplain of the United States Senate, and a notorious political\r\norator. One of his converts was Delizon Smith, who had been an infidel\r\nlecturer and prominent politician in the state, and was afterwards\r\nelected for a short term to the United States Senate from the state of\r\nOregon. The next year after I settled in Keosauqua, Henry Clay\r\nCaldwell, then a student in the law office of Judge Wright, was\r\nadmitted to the bar, and after the Civil War was appointed United\r\nStates District Judge and afterwards United States Circuit Judge, being\r\nlocated during his official career as judge at Little Rock, Arkansas,\r\nnow retired by reason of age and continued service, and residing at Los\r\nAngeles, California.\r\n\r\nThe state of Iowa at that time in its politics was democratic, and the\r\ndemocratic party numbered a majority of about two hundred in Van Buren\r\ncounty. Delizon Smith, however, had failed to obtain a nomination by\r\nhis party for the office of Governor, and had organized what was called\r\n\"The Young Democracy of Van Buren County,\" numbering about two hundred\r\nvoters. This left the party badly demoralized in the county, and in\r\nAugust, 1852, I had so far succeeded in making the acquaintance of the\r\npeople of the county that I was elected on an independent ticket to the\r\noffice of county attorney, which then paid a salary of about three\r\nhundred dollars a year.\r\n\r\nAfter I had boarded with Father Shepherd for a few weeks I received\r\nfrom my brother Joseph a small remittance. I sent for my books that I\r\nhad left at Burlington and took Father Shepherd, the landlord, into my\r\nconfidence, told him my situation financially, and paid my bill up to\r\nthat date. Father Shepherd at that time was himself a justice of the\r\npeace, and his hotel was the stopping place of most of the people who\r\nacted as guardians and administrators, and who attended once a month\r\nsessions of the county court that then had jurisdiction in probate\r\nmatters. I told Father Shepherd of my desire to make the acquaintance\r\nof these officials as they visited his hotel from time to time, and\r\nthat his pay for my board depended largely upon my success in business,\r\nand I asked him to be my friend, and at least let people know why I was\r\nthere and what my proposed business was. He became my fast friend and\r\nhelped me to make very many valuable acquaintances. Father Shepherd was\r\nthe father-in-law of Delizon Smith, and a leader of the faction known\r\nas the \"Young Democrats\" of that county.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1853 I received a letter from my then intended\r\nwife, suggesting that my success in business she thought gave\r\nsufficient promise for the future, and that it was not necessary for us\r\nto wait longer. Accordingly I got together one hundred dollars in\r\nmoney, made a trip around the river to Louisville, Kentucky, and thence\r\nvia rail to Lexington for the purpose of realizing something of the\r\ndeferred hope. We were married on the 15th of April of that year, my\r\nfather in the meantime having removed from Millersburg to Winchester,\r\nKentucky. I made him a visit in company with my bride and had the\r\npleasure of meeting there my sister Susan and her husband, William\r\nVimont, your mother's father and mother. Before going to Kentucky and\r\nclaiming my bride I purchased from the Reverend Daniel Lane a house and\r\ntwo lots in Keosauqua at the price of three hundred and fifty dollars,\r\nand borrowed fifty dollars from Thomas Devon to make the first payment.\r\nI had also attended several auction sales and bought some chairs and\r\ntables, a cook stove and a few dishes. My wife's mother had packed a\r\nfeather bed, some pillows and bed clothes, and quilts of the old style\r\nin a store box, and we returned to Iowa the latter part of April, 1853.\r\nThe expense of my trip and marriage left me only two dollars of the one\r\nhundred dollars I had when I started for my bride. We arrived in\r\nKeosauqua on Sunday in a slight April shower. On Monday we proceeded to\r\nthe house I had purchased, which was in need of repair. We whitewashed\r\nthe walls and my wife washed the windows. The next day we made a bill\r\nof about forty dollars at the store for additional house-keeping\r\nfacilities. I bought a sack of flour and a ham of meat, and on Tuesday\r\nevening we took tea at home. It was the first home I had had (in the\r\nproper sense of the term) since we left Maryland, and when we sat down\r\nat our own table to drink our cup of tea and eat the new made biscuit\r\nbaked by my own wife, I could not repress the tears that came to my\r\neyes, and I thanked God for the mercy that he had bestowed upon us.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1853 I made a trip west through the southern tier of\r\ncounties, attending the courts at Davis, Appanoose, Wayne, and Decatur\r\ncounties. I made the trip on horseback with a pair of saddle-bags that\r\ncontained my necessary baggage.\r\n\r\nFrom Bloomfield I was accompanied by several attorneys of that bar, and\r\nat Centerville two or three additional lawyers joined our party. The\r\ncounties west of Centerville were very sparsely settled and the road\r\nconsisted merely of two paths worn by the horses and wagon wheels on\r\nthe prairie grass. In Wayne county we applied at one settler's house\r\nfor accommodations for the night, but the housewife informed us that\r\nher husband was away from home, had gone to mill, and that she had\r\nnothing in the house to eat save a little bacon. She said if we would\r\nremain she would entertain us with such accommodations as the place\r\nafforded. The corn was hardly yet ripe enough to feed our horses, but\r\nshe told us if we would select the ripest and use some salt in feeding\r\nwe were welcome to do so. We also, at her request, plucked some of the\r\nsofter ears of the corn, and these she grated upon a large tin grater,\r\nand frying some of the bacon in her skillet she made cakes of the\r\ngrated corn and fried them in the fat. She also gave us a cup of good\r\ncoffee, and with the appetites we had acquired in our day's travel we\r\nmade a very hearty and palatable meal.\r\n\r\nWhen bedtime came she made some kind of a bed upon the floor. The next\r\nmorning we had a breakfast of the same corn and bacon and coffee. The\r\nlady made a very reasonable charge for our entertainment, and she had\r\nno reason to doubt the sincerity of our compliments upon our fare, as\r\nthe avidity with which we had eaten what she had supplied gave full\r\nevidence that we had appreciated our entertainment. The next morning we\r\nrode into Corydon, the county seat of Wayne county. The only hotel in\r\nthe place was a small one and one-half story frame house, with a shed\r\naddition for kitchen and dining hall.\r\n\r\nOur bed room was the upstairs, and our beds were in two rows, with our\r\nheads under the eaves and our feet touching each other in the center of\r\nthe room. We had no separate apartment or separate beds, our wearing\r\napparel furnishing the pillows.\r\n\r\nThe court was held in a frame school house on the public square. The\r\nboundaries of the public square were ascertained by a lot of wooden\r\nstakes or pegs. There was no general store in the place for the sale of\r\ngoods. An enterprising peddler with two large peddling wagons came\r\nthrough with us from Centerville and erected a large tent in the center\r\nof the square for the display and sale of his goods, and whenever the\r\ncourt was not in actual session his store was opened for business.\r\n\r\nJudge Townsend, of Monroe county, was the judge of the court.\r\n\r\nFrom Wayne county we went to Decatur, the peddler also keeping us\r\ncompany with his itinerant dry goods establishment. During this trip I\r\nmade the acquaintance of very many young men who afterwards became\r\ndistinguished as lawyers, legislators, and judges. The only lawsuit in\r\nwhich I was consulted was a slander case tried in Wayne county. The\r\nsuit was brought in behalf of a young woman for damages because of\r\nwords spoken against her reputation by the defendant. Amos Harris, a\r\nlawyer from Centerville, was engaged as attorney for the defendant.\r\nWhen the case was about to be called for trial Harris expressed his\r\nwish to have my advice in regard to the course to be pursued, and at\r\nhis request I retired with him to the shady side of the school house\r\nfor consultation. He told me that his client was a man of some property\r\nand that the plaintiff had some witnesses who would testify clearly and\r\npositively to the slanderous words spoken by the defendant of and\r\nconcerning the young lady. He said his client really had not injured\r\nthe reputation of the young woman at all because nobody believed any\r\nthing that he said as he had a very bad reputation for veracity. He\r\nsaid they could make no defense whatever, as the girl's character was\r\ngood, and he was afraid of a large verdict for damages against his\r\nclient, and asked me if I could think of any way that he could help his\r\nclient out of the difficulty. I asked him if he could prove that nobody\r\nbelieved what his client said on account of his bad character. He said\r\nyes, there were plenty of persons that would testify to that, but he\r\ncould not see how that was any defense. I told him it was no defense\r\nagainst the slander, but it might be proved with advantage in\r\nmitigation of damages, provided his client would be willing that he\r\nshould undertake to do so. He called his client out and explained to\r\nhim the situation as I had advised, and asked him if he was willing to\r\nsave his money at the expense of his reputation. The fellow winced, but\r\nfinally consented that Harris might make the proof. I suggested that as\r\nthe plaintiff's witnesses were all friendly to the young lady Harris\r\nmight on cross-examination prove by them that they did not at the time\r\nor ever believe the slander that the defendant had uttered against the\r\nplaintiff, and that they had never repeated it to anyone except\r\naccompanied by their statement of their belief that it was all false,\r\nand Harris introduced several other witnesses to prove the bad\r\nreputation of his client for truth and veracity. The plaintiff's\r\nattorneys objected and the court first hesitated to allow the witnesses\r\nto so testify, but upon the suggestion that it was the best thing for\r\nthe plaintiff's reputation, and that as nearly the whole population of\r\nthe county was there upon attendance of the court, it was better to\r\nclear up her reputation by this testimony than to give her money to\r\nheal her wounded feelings, the court finally took this view of the case\r\nand permitted the evidence to go to the jury in mitigation of damages.\r\nThe jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against the\r\ndefendant for the sum of only twenty dollars. The young woman went home\r\nwith her character thoroughly vindicated and her reputation restored,\r\nand the only one unhappy over the result of the trial appeared to be\r\nthe attorney for the plaintiff, who was undoubtedly expecting a\r\nhandsome recovery as the only means of compensating him for his\r\nprofessional work.\r\n\r\nFrom Decatur county I returned home, having learned much of the country\r\nand its people, and having made many interesting acquaintances among\r\nthe members of the bar.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must tell you something of my political career, which\r\nproperly begins at about this date. I had been made chairman of the\r\ncounty committee of the fast dissolving organization known as the whig\r\nparty. In the fall of 1854 I was a candidate for re-election as county\r\nattorney. We had nominated a county ticket of two candidates for the\r\nstate senate and four representatives, what we then called the\r\nanti-Nebraska whigs. James W. Grimes was the candidate for Governor of\r\nthe state. The democratic party had passed what was called the\r\n\"Kansas-Nebraska Bill,\" containing a clause repealing the Missouri\r\nCompromise measure, adopted in 1820, that prohibited slavery and\r\ninvoluntary servitude north of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes of\r\nnorth latitude in the territories of the United States, acquired by the\r\nLouisiana Purchase. This had resulted in the partial disorganization of\r\nthe democratic party throughout many of the northern states. I had left\r\nKentucky because of my opposition to slavery, and especially to what I\r\nregarded as the baleful influence of that institution upon the white\r\npopulation. I had settled in Iowa because it was a free state and\r\nbecause I felt that the opportunities for success in life would be\r\ngreater than in a slave state. I had observed whilst in Kentucky that\r\nfixed conditions of political, social, and business life made the\r\nsuccess of the young man, depending only on his own energies and\r\nabilities, always doubtful and difficult.\r\n\r\nUpon my defeat as prosecuting attorney in 1854, at the suggestion of\r\nthe members elected to the legislature from Van Buren county I went to\r\nIowa City in their company at the beginning of the session, and through\r\ntheir influence I was elected clerk of the house of representatives of\r\nthe state of Iowa. I found this position of great advantage and help,\r\nnot only pecuniarily, but I made the acquaintance of public men of all\r\nparties during the session. Afterwards in 1856-7 I was elected\r\nsecretary of the senate of the state.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, at the dissolution of the old whig party there existed a\r\npolitical organization in many of the states of the Union called \"The\r\nKnow-Nothings.\" It was a secret political organization, having for its\r\nprincipal doctrines opposition to the Roman Catholics and to the\r\nforeign-born citizens of the United States. I refused to affiliate with\r\nthis \"Know-Nothing\" organization for the reason that I did not believe\r\nin secret political societies or organizations in this country, and I\r\ndid not believe in making the religious faith or affiliations of any\r\nman a test for office, neither did I believe that anyone should be\r\nexcluded from the confidence and respect of his fellow men because of\r\nthe place of his birth. As county chairman of the expiring whig party I\r\nissued to the people of Van Buren county a circular stating my position\r\nand declining to call any convention to coöperate with the\r\n\"Know-Nothing\" organization. I did this for the further reason that the\r\nopposition to the extension of slavery into the territories was\r\nbecoming every day more and more pronounced in the northern states of\r\nthe Union, and the nucleus of what was afterwards the republican party\r\nhad already been formed in many of the northern states.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to you to have the history of how Henry Clay Dean\r\nbecame a democrat, and how a little thing may change the destiny and\r\nfortune of a man in this life. In the fall of 1854 the Methodist annual\r\nconference for Iowa met at the city of Dubuque. It was the custom at\r\nthat early day for the members of the conference to become guests of\r\nthe citizens of the locality where the conference had its meetings.\r\nDean was then a member of the conference, and had been receiving and\r\nfilling regular appointments as a pastor. At Dubuque resided Honorable\r\nGeorge W. Jones, then a democratic United States Senator from Iowa.\r\nJones maintained a good table and was a good liver, and his wife an\r\nexcellent, hospitable lady. In assigning the members of the conference\r\nto the different citizens, Dean was assigned as the guest of Senator\r\nJones and his wife. After the conference had been in session a few\r\ndays, the \"Know-Nothings\" having been secretly organized in the city of\r\nDubuque became very active in obtaining the names of the Methodist\r\nministers attending the conference, and in initiating them into their\r\norder. Among other names presented and favorably acted upon was that of\r\nHenry Clay Dean, my former pastor and friend. After he had been elected\r\nand the time appointed for his initiation a few nights hence, one of\r\nthe over zealous ministers represented to Brother Dean that as he had\r\nnow been elected a member of the \"Know-Nothing\" organization it was not\r\nproper for him to continue to be the guest of and accept of the\r\nhospitality of the wife of George W. Jones, who was a Roman Catholic.\r\nDean was an enormous eater, and the suggestion that he should give up\r\nhis nice boarding place greatly offended him, and he denounced the\r\nsuggestion as bigotry and presumption inexcusable. He at once went to\r\nSenator Jones and told him of the proposition that had been made to him\r\nand the cause of it, and denounced the \"Know-Nothing\" organization in\r\nmost uncompromising terms. The Senator was pleased with Brother Dean's\r\nzeal in the matter, and induced him on the succeeding Sabbath to preach\r\na sermon on \"Know-Nothingism\" and to denounce it from the pulpit. Dean\r\nwas a man of more than ordinary ability, with a wonderful command of\r\nlanguage. Upon the adjournment of the conference Senator Jones wrote to\r\nJudge Knapp at Keosauqua stating the situation and suggesting that Dean\r\nbe employed in the political canvass against the \"Know-Nothings\" that\r\nfall, and be encouraged in his opposition to that order. Dean returned\r\nto Keosauqua, and I had a long conference with him upon this matter. I\r\nknew that he had been engaged several years before that in collecting\r\nthe most learned and effective arguments in favor of protective tariff\r\nas delivered in congress from time to time, especially from whig\r\nmembers from the state of Pennsylvania. I also knew that he had\r\npreached some of the bitterest sermons against human slavery that I had\r\never heard from the pulpit or from any source, and I urged upon him\r\nthat he could not consistently coöperate with the democratic party\r\nbecause of his views in regard to the tariff and because of his\r\nopposition to slavery. I pointed out to him that the organization of\r\nthe republican party was then proceeding in most of the states and that\r\nhis feelings, sentiments, and views would be better expressed by the\r\nposition of that organization; that the \"Know-Nothing\" party was a mere\r\ntemporary passion and would effervesce and disappear in a short time,\r\nand that his efforts in opposition to them would be wholly unnecessary\r\nand gratuitous. But he was too wroth and anxious for his revenge\r\nagainst those who suggested that he decline the hospitality and good\r\ndinners of Senator Jones. He accordingly entered the canvass, and that\r\nfall there being the election in Virginia in which Henry A. Wise was a\r\ndemocratic candidate for Governor and was opposed by the\r\n\"Know-Nothings,\" Dean with letters of recommendation from Jones and\r\nSenator Dodge and other leading democrats of Iowa went to Virginia and\r\nentered the political canvass in favor of Wise and in opposition to the\r\n\"Know-Nothings.\" Wise was elected, and Dean then went to Washington\r\nCity. With the influence of Dodge and Jones and the Virginia delegation\r\nhe was elected chaplain of the United States senate, and thereafter,\r\nand especially during the Civil War, he made himself notorious as a\r\ndemocratic orator.\r\n\r\nWithout observing the exact chronology of events, it would be well here\r\nto recite certain facts and incidents that had a material influence\r\nupon my mind, and determined my action in regard to the question of\r\nhuman slavery. While residing in Kentucky and boarding in the family of\r\nmy friend, Abraham S. Drake, I had frequent conversations with him in\r\nregard to the subject. He was at that time decidedly opposed to the\r\ninstitution, regarding it as morally wrong and detrimental in its\r\neffect upon the white as well as the slave population of the state.\r\n\r\nSlavery at that time existed in Kentucky in its most modified and\r\nhumane condition, but the system itself and the law gave to the slave\r\nowner a power over the slave that was too frequently abused. One\r\ninstance I recall that made a powerful impression upon my mind. On a\r\nbeautiful Sabbath morning in the early part of the summer I was taken\r\nsick, while in attendance upon religious services at the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church, and was compelled to leave the church and go home,\r\nsoon after the singing of the opening hymn. On the way to my boarding\r\nhouse I passed near what was known as the \"Watch-house\" or headquarters\r\nof the police, and was shocked to hear the cries of a negro woman who\r\nwas maid to some wealthy mistress, who had become offended at her that\r\nmorning, and had sent for the police and given orders that her servant\r\nbe taken to the police quarters and given a certain number of lashes,\r\nadministered in expiation of her offense.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the quiet worshipers at the church and their\r\nseeming devotion, and the horrible cries that filled the air from the\r\nunfortunate negro slave woman was a comment upon the injustice and\r\nbrutality of the institution, that made an impression upon my mind that\r\nhas never been erased.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 when I went to Kentucky for the purpose of being married I was\r\nthe guest of my friend Drake for several days. While sitting upon the\r\nveranda one evening one of his children was playing upon the lawn in\r\nfront of the house, with a little negro tot two or three years of age.\r\nHe called my attention to the colored child, stating that that was his\r\n\"carriage driver\" and that he was a child of one of the negro women\r\nthat his wife had inherited a few years before, and he remarked that\r\nthe child was worth then $600. I reminded him of our former\r\nconversation and discussion in regard to slavery and expressed my\r\nsurprise that he would have any pleasure in calculating the money value\r\nof this child. He informed me that his views on the subject of slavery\r\nhad undergone quite a change, and upon investigating the subject he was\r\nsatisfied that the Bible fully justified the institution of slavery,\r\nand he thought it was right morally as well as legally to own and enjoy\r\nthe possession of such property. I said but little in response to these\r\narguments, but could not but reflect and be convinced that it was\r\npecuniary investment that had its baleful influence upon the conscience\r\nof my friend and perverted his moral sense, and this was only to me an\r\nadditional reason for hating the institution.\r\n\r\nWhen returning from Kentucky with my bride we stayed over a day at\r\nLouisville, as my wife desired to visit some old friends and former\r\nneighbors who had resided near them in Lexington. We accordingly made a\r\ncall upon her friends, and while sitting in the parlor conversing about\r\nold times a colored woman about the age of my wife came into the room,\r\nand greeting us begged to inquire of my wife in regard to her husband,\r\nit appearing from her story the family had moved from Lexington to\r\nLouisville about two years before, and that the woman had been\r\nseparated from her husband, who still resided in Lexington and was the\r\nproperty of another party. In the meantime the slave woman had given\r\nbirth to a child, and amid her tears told how she longed to see her\r\nhusband and have him see her young babe. The interview was cut short\r\nwhen the slave woman was remanded to the kitchen, and the cheerful\r\nrecall of pleasant reminiscences became rather sad. The family insisted\r\nupon my wife and myself remaining to dinner and pressed upon us with\r\ngreat earnestness their hospitality. My wife was disposed to accept of\r\nthe invitation, but having only been married the week before, I was not\r\nprepared to accept of the hospitality of people who separated a husband\r\nand wife thus ruthlessly, and I retired with thanks, and we took our\r\ndinner at the hotel.\r\n\r\nAfter I settled in Keosauqua, Iowa, I became a subscriber to and a\r\nconstant reader of the New York _Tribune_, and in due time also read\r\nwith much interest that wonderful book written by Harriet Beecher\r\nStowe, called _Uncle Tom's Cabin_.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1857, whilst I was secretary of the state senate,\r\nI enjoyed the pleasure of hearing Wendell Phillips deliver his lecture\r\nupon the \"Lost Arts.\" At the close of his lecture Hon. J. B. Grinnell,\r\nthen a member of the state senate from Poweshiek county, rose in the\r\naudience and requested Mr. Phillips to give us his views upon the\r\nsubject of slavery, and especially called his attention to the fact\r\nthat Mr. Phillips had been represented by the public press as favoring\r\na dissolution of the American Union. Mr. Phillips courteously complied\r\nwith the request, and proceeded to say that when the constitution of\r\nthe United States was formed it contained within its provisions, as he\r\nbelieved, the germ of human liberty. That the declaration of American\r\nindependence had declared that all men were entitled to the inalienable\r\nrights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He said that he\r\nwas in favor of the development of this germ to its fullest extent;\r\nthat the constitution of the United States might be compared to a box\r\nin which was planted an acorn; the acorn would grow in the very nature\r\nof things and become an oak, but whether or not the box in which the\r\nacorn was planted was sufficient to contain the development and growing\r\ngerm, he could not say. He was not concerned in regard to the safety of\r\nthe box, but he was anxious that the germ should develop and that the\r\ntree should grow. That whether or not the constitution of the United\r\nStates could survive the development and growth of this germ of human\r\nliberty that had been planted therein, he could not say, and upon that\r\nquestion he did not feel any very great anxiety; all he had to say in\r\nregard to the matter was that he was in favor of the growth of the\r\ngerm, and he believed that the acorn would grow and ought to grow.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips was one of the most eloquent and graceful public\r\nspeakers it was ever my privilege to listen to. I had expected from his\r\nreputation as a reformer and abolitionist to hear a man with loud voice\r\nand vehement gesticulation, but instead he proved to be mild, quiet,\r\nself-possessed, delivering his utterances in the clearest, mildest, and\r\nmost persuasive tones, commanding the respect of his audience and\r\nalmost fascinating them with his words.\r\n\r\nDuring the same session I also had the pleasure of hearing at\r\nDavenport, Iowa, a lecture from Horace Greeley, the great editor of the\r\nNew York _Tribune_. I was greatly disappointed in Mr. Greeley's\r\nlecture. As a writer I knew him to be the clearest and most incisive in\r\nhis utterances. His manner on the platform and his speech were those of\r\na drony, sing-song, intonating Episcopal minister, devoid of life and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly of 1854-5 elected George G. Wright, then of Van\r\nBuren county, Norman W. Isbell, and Wm. G. Woodard, judges of the\r\nsupreme court of the state to fill the vacancies caused by the\r\nexpirations of the terms of Judges Williams, Kinney and Greene. At this\r\nsession also occurred the first election of James Harlan as United\r\nStates Senator. Mr. Harlan was not permitted to take his seat under\r\nthis election, for the reason that at the adjourned joint session at\r\nwhich he was elected the senate as an organized body with their\r\npresident, Maturin L. Fisher, had not participated in the election, but\r\nhad previously adjourned the session of the state senate. Mr. Harlan\r\nwas again elected in the session of 1856-7, and his right was\r\nrecognized by the senate.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1856 a republican convention was called for\r\nthe state to be held at Iowa City, for the organization of that party,\r\nin sympathy with other state organizations of like name and principles.\r\nAs the sole surviving official of the old whig party of Van Buren\r\ncounty, I called a county convention to meet at Keosauqua for the\r\npurpose of appointing delegates to the state convention to be held at\r\nIowa City. I wrote a letter to my friend, H. C. Caldwell, asking him to\r\nwrite a letter to Judge Wright and urge upon him the propriety, as he\r\ncould not be present at this county convention, of writing a letter\r\nendorsing and encouraging the movement. Judge Wright declined to write\r\nany such letter, and simply wrote to Mr. Caldwell that he hoped we were\r\ndoing right in calling the county convention.\r\n\r\nI was present at the county convention and started the movement with\r\nsuch enthusiasm as we were able to awaken. Delegates were duly\r\nappointed, but the attendance at Iowa City required of them an overland\r\ntrip of some seventy-five miles.\r\n\r\nI then owned what was called a \"democrat wagon,\" having two seats, and\r\na small gray mare and mustang pony. With this team and wagon, when the\r\ntime came, I furnished the transportation for the delegation, and Van\r\nBuren county was represented in the state convention by Abner H.\r\nMcCrary, our state senator from Van Buren county, Dr. William Craig,\r\nGeorge C. Duffield, and myself. I had the honor also to be appointed\r\none of the secretaries of this state convention. This was the first\r\nrepublican state convention held in the state, and was the beginning of\r\nthe political organization that has ever since, with the exception of a\r\nperiod of four years, controlled the legislation and policy of the\r\nstate of Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe first national republican convention met at Philadelphia in the\r\nfall of 1856 and nominated General John C. Fremont as its candidate for\r\nPresident. I took an active part in the campaign in Iowa that ensued.\r\nAt the request of the central committee of the state I spent several\r\nweeks in canvassing Davis county. Many of the settlers in the southern\r\ntier of townships, both in Van Buren and Davis counties, instead of\r\nfinding themselves in a slave state, in the state of Missouri, were\r\nreally citizens of the free state of Iowa. It was much easier to\r\nascertain the true southern boundary of our state than it was to remove\r\nthe prejudices of the benighted citizens who had by mistake settled in\r\nIowa, so when I went into Davis county in 1856 to make republican\r\nspeeches opposed to the existence and extension of slavery in our free\r\nterritory, I met with small encouragement. We were courteously called\r\n\"black republicans,\" and frequently designated as \"damn black\r\nrepublicans.\" At one point where I had an appointment to make a\r\npolitical speech I found an audience assembled that had armed\r\nthemselves with rotten eggs, with the intention of driving me out of\r\ntheir locality. It so happened that the year before most of these men\r\nhad been indicted for libel in accusing their school-master of burning\r\ndown a school house in the township, notifying him publicly to leave\r\nthe county or suffer mob violence. A civil suit was also instituted\r\nagainst them for damages. I had been employed by them and succeeded in\r\ngetting them off with the reasonable sum of eight hundred dollars, for\r\nwhich they were truly grateful, and when they found that I was to be\r\nthe \"black republican\" orator advertised for the occasion, they\r\ngenerously assured me that if it had been anybody else they would not\r\nhave permitted him to speak, but as I had stood by them in their\r\ntrouble I might go on and say just what I pleased. They were a\r\nwarm-hearted, hot-headed, impulsive set of men. Just how many converts\r\nI made during the two weeks that I was engaged in speaking in Davis\r\ncounty I cannot say. We had no republican organization in the county,\r\nand the leading men who took any active part in politics in opposition\r\nto the democratic party were running Bell and Everett as their\r\ncandidates. Davis county, at the ensuing election, gave Fremont\r\nelectors only two hundred and fifty votes, and the vote in the state of\r\nIowa stood as follows: Fremont, 43,954; Buchanan, 36,170; Fillmore,\r\n9,180.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nREMOVED TO DES MOINES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of law in Van Buren county did not prove very remunerative.\r\nThe district court met only twice a year. The business of the term\r\nsometimes occupied only two or three days, seldom beyond one week, and\r\nnever beyond two weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring the time I had continued to reside in Van Buren county one of\r\nthe most important cases in which I was retained was a contest over the\r\nlegality of a will in which the deceased had made a bequest of a small\r\ntract of land to the Methodist Episcopal church, organized out on what\r\nwas called \"Utica Prairie.\" The will provided that the land should be\r\nsold by the trustees of the church and a fund created out of which\r\nshould be paid so much a year to the missionary cause and so much to\r\nthe support of the minister. The remainder should be expended by the\r\ntrustees in erecting a house of worship. The trustees of the church had\r\nnot been incorporated, and the heirs sought to set aside the will on\r\nthe ground that there was no legal capacity in the trustees to receive\r\nthe bequest, and on the further ground of the uncertainty of the\r\nbeneficiaries under the will. I was retained in the case in behalf of\r\nthe trustees, and had them immediately adopt articles of incorporation\r\nand file the same as provided by the statutes of the state. I filed an\r\nanswer in the case, setting forth with particularity the character of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church's organization, with proper averments as\r\nto the certainty of the continued existence of the beneficiaries under\r\nthe will. The case was tried upon demurrer to this answer, and upon\r\nappeal to the supreme court of Iowa the will was sustained. The opinion\r\nof the court is fully reported in the case of Johnson et al. vs. Mayne\r\net al., Trustees, 4th Iowa, 180.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Charles Clinton Nourse_\r\n  From an air brush copy of an old photograph loaned by\r\n  D. W. Nourse, Kenton, Ohio.]\r\n\r\nI charged and received from the trustees the sum of $200 for my\r\nservices in the case, being the largest amount that I received in my\r\npractice from any one case during the seven years I remained in\r\nKeosauqua.\r\n\r\nThe railroad up the Des Moines valley from Keokuk had been located some\r\nthree or four miles north of the town of Keosauqua, and I saw no\r\nimmediate prospect of any improvement or growth in the town. Added to\r\nthese discouragements, my wife and myself in the fall of 1857 were both\r\ntaken down with the fever and the ague. On advice of our physician we\r\nmade a visit to Kentucky and also to Ohio to visit our relatives,\r\nhoping by some means to escape or shake off the dreaded disease, but\r\nthe more we shook the stronger the ague kept its hold. I had during\r\nthat year (1857) been employed by Edwin Manning, the commissioner of\r\nthe Des Moines River Improvement, to represent the interest of the\r\nstate in certain suits commenced against him by the Des Moines\r\nNavigation & Railroad Company, for the purpose of compelling him to\r\ncertify to the company certain lands belonging to the state under the\r\ngrant of congress, made for the purpose of aiding in the improvement of\r\nthe navigation of the Des Moines river, the company claiming that they\r\nwere entitled to certain of these lands at the rate of $1.25 per acre\r\nfor moneys expended in the building of locks and dams upon the river,\r\nwhich expenditure had been certified by the state engineer. The general\r\nassembly of the state of Iowa was to meet for the first time in the\r\ncity of Des Moines on the first day of January, 1858, and I went to Des\r\nMoines in company with Mr. Manning at that time for the two-fold\r\npurpose of calling the roll of senators upon the organization of the\r\nsenate, that being my duty as the secretary of the past session, and\r\nalso to look after the interest of the state in the settlement that was\r\nthen to be made between the state and the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany, the supreme court having decided the suit, to which I have\r\nreferred, in our favor. I found Des Moines to be a thriving young city\r\nof something less than five thousand inhabitants, but with great\r\nexpectation for the future as the permanent capital of the state of\r\nIowa. I was introduced after a few days' stay in the city to Judge W.\r\nW. Williamson, an old time lawyer with a good collecting business, who\r\noffered me a full partnership in his business, and I finally\r\ndetermined, after transacting the business I had in Des Moines, to\r\nreturn to Keosauqua and dispose of my affairs there and remove to this\r\ncity, which I finally did, and on the 6th day of March, 1858, with my\r\nwife and household goods and the ague, we came to Des Moines.\r\n\r\nAbout a year or more before we left Keosauqua I had traded off the\r\nhouse I had first purchased in the village for a very beautiful home\r\nthat had been built by L. J. Rose. It had about a full block of ground\r\nwell planted with young fruit trees and vines and shrubbery and rose\r\nbushes. The house was well located on the hill in the northwest part of\r\nthe village, and my wife as well as myself had become fondly attached\r\nto the place. During our five years of residence we had many friends in\r\nthe town, and we found it hard to leave them. My wife shed many tears\r\nat the thought of leaving the place, but the largest amount that my\r\npractice had yielded in any one year whilst in Keosauqua was $800, and\r\nI was satisfied that our best interests would be promoted by our new\r\nlocation. The location of the permanent capital of the state at Des\r\nMoines, and the fact that our supreme and United States courts would be\r\nlocated there, and that it would necessarily become a railroad center\r\nand build up and become one of the chief cities of the state, had\r\nattracted many other young men of the profession. Within twelve months\r\nbefore the time I settled in Des Moines probably a dozen well educated,\r\nenterprising young lawyers had preceded me. The result was a fierce\r\ncompetition and struggle for business, every young man realizing that\r\nit was a question of the survival of the fittest, and that his success\r\ndepended upon himself. Before arriving in the city I had secured a\r\nsmall house of two rooms and a shed kitchen on Sixth street, at a\r\nrental of twenty dollars per month. We moved our goods into this house\r\non Saturday, and on Sunday morning after a light breakfast both my wife\r\nand myself went to bed with the ague. The chill was succeeded, of\r\ncourse, by the usual high fever, and in the middle of the afternoon we\r\nwere delighted by a call from an old acquaintance, a girl that had been\r\nraised at Keosauqua and who had married Mr. R. L. Tidrick, of Des\r\nMoines. She made us a cup of tea, and we came out of the fever\r\nencouraged and contented.\r\n\r\nThe first two years of my practice in Des Moines were not remunerative.\r\nIn addition to our earnings we spent $1500 in our living, having saved\r\nthat amount from the proceeds of the property that we disposed of at\r\nKeosauqua.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1859 I took an active part in the political campaign\r\nthat resulted in the election of Samuel J. Kirkwood for Governor and\r\nthe defeat of Augustus Ceasar Dodge, former democratic Senator from\r\nIowa. As I had become interested in and contemplated taking an active\r\npart in the politics of the state and nation, I occupied my leisure\r\ntime in more serious and thoughtful consideration of the grave\r\nquestions that were soon to confront the nation. I read with great\r\ninterest and studied with great care the debates between Stephen A.\r\nDouglas and Abraham Lincoln that had taken place in the state of\r\nIllinois, and the struggle between those parties for a seat in the\r\nUnited States senate. I also read with some care and great interest the\r\ngreat questions that had divided those who had framed the constitution\r\nof the United States. I became thoroughly grounded in the theory that\r\nour fathers in forming our national constitution had established a\r\ngovernment with all the essential attributes of sovereignty. Whilst\r\nthere is a limitation upon the subjects over which the government\r\nshould exercise jurisdiction, yet within the sphere over which it might\r\nexercise any power it was absolutely sovereign and supreme; that the\r\nconstitution was not a compact or treaty between sovereign states, but\r\nthat it was a government, deriving its powers directly from the people,\r\nwith power to make its own laws and through its courts to interpret and\r\nadminister its own laws, and through its executive and his appointees\r\nhad the power to execute its own laws; that the relation between the\r\nnational government and the individual was direct, with power over his\r\nperson and his property so far as it was necessary to assert and\r\nmaintain its jurisdiction; and that it collected and disbursed its own\r\nrevenues, enlisted and maintained its own armies, built and maintained\r\nits own navies, and that its constitution and laws, by the very terms\r\nof its organization, constituted the supreme law of the land. That the\r\nassumption that it was a mere treaty between the sovereign states, from\r\nwhich any state might at any time secede at its pleasure, was an\r\nerroneous assumption, and inimical to our national existence and\r\nprosperity. I found upon examination of the decisions of the supreme\r\ncourt of the United States that these views of our national government\r\nand its powers had been fully sustained by the supreme court of the\r\nUnited States by the most eminent jurists of the land. Particularly I\r\nstudied with great care the decisions of the supreme court of the\r\nUnited States, and the opinions of the Chief Justice Marshall of that\r\ncourt, delivered in the early history of our government.\r\n\r\nThe same fall of 1859 I made a trip through Warren, Madison, Dallas,\r\nGuthrie, and Union counties, at the request of the republican state\r\ncentral committee. They furnished me with a covered buggy and pair of\r\nhorses, without any expense to myself, and loaded me down with a lot of\r\npolitical campaign documents which I undertook to distribute, making\r\npolitical speeches also at the county seats in each of the above named\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nIn crossing from Winterset over to Redfield one afternoon I found the\r\nroad becoming very obscure, and a smoke arising from some burning\r\nprairie northwest of me so darkened the way that I became apprehensive\r\nof losing my road. There was no settlement in sight and no one from\r\nwhom I could inquire the way. While I was seriously pondering upon the\r\ndifficulty, a half dozen or more fine short horn cows crossed my path\r\nahead of my team and I thought the safest way out of the difficulty\r\nwould be to follow the cows, as they probably knew better than I where\r\nwe were going. I had not followed these cows more than a few hundred\r\nyards before the owner of them appeared. He was a young Quaker about\r\nthirty years of age, named Wilson. I told him who I was and what my\r\nbusiness was and he cordially invited me to go home with him. He lived\r\nin a small board shanty, one large room and an attic, situated under\r\nthe hill. After sheltering his cows in a shed-barn covered with hay he\r\ntook me to his house. I thought the chances for accommodations rather\r\nmeager, but I noticed that he had a small yard fenced in front of his\r\nhouse, with a path of flagstones from the gate to the door, and on\r\neither side was planted quite a show of flowers and rose bushes. As we\r\nneared the house a very handsome young Quaker woman, his wife, with a\r\nlittle girl about three years of age, appeared at the door. Inside it\r\nwas neat and tidy. The little Quaker wife prepared us a supper of\r\nsnow-white biscuits and a plate of beautiful honey. She told me that\r\nthey had attended the county fair that day and had taken a premium upon\r\ntheir honey. I spent a pleasant evening discussing politics with Mr.\r\nWilson and supplying him with political speeches and documents, which I\r\nurged upon him to distribute among his neighbors. When bed-time came I\r\nclimbed a ladder to the attic in which there was just room enough under\r\nthe shingles for a clean sweet bed where I had a delightful night's\r\nrest. After a good breakfast in the morning, Wilson accompanied me on\r\nmy way. We soon came to a well-beaten road and I found I was on what\r\nwas called \"The Quaker Divide.\" Near a large Quaker meeting house we\r\nmet one of Mr. Wilson's relatives, a fine looking old fashioned Quaker\r\ngentleman, to whom he introduced me, and I stated my business. I had an\r\ninteresting interview with the old Quaker and also supplied him with a\r\nnumber of congressional speeches, and before I left him he looked at me\r\nvery earnestly and asked, how much pay I received for the work I was\r\ndoing. I told him nothing for my own services, but my team and buggy\r\nwere furnished by the state central committee free of charge to myself.\r\nAt first he appeared a little incredulous that I should be working for\r\nnothing and traveling at my own expense, but after further talk with\r\nhim he seemed to have every confidence in me and remarked very\r\nearnestly, \"Thee must be a very good man to do this work without pay.\"\r\nI told him we must all \"cast our bread upon the waters,\" and possibly\r\nit might return to us after many days; that this would indeed be a poor\r\nworld if none of us were willing to make some sacrifices for the good\r\nof the country. I bid the two Quakers an affectionate good-bye and went\r\non my way much gratified. The prairie was dotted here and there with\r\ncomfortable, well kept homes. It was a beautiful October morning, what\r\nwe then and always called in Iowa \"Indian Summer.\" A slight haze rested\r\nupon the horizon, and here and there the ripening corn gave a glow and\r\nvariety to the landscape. I was deeply impressed with the beauty and\r\nglory of my adopted state of Iowa, and I thought then, as I afterwards\r\nexpressed the thought in my centennial address at Philadelphia. \"When\r\nin the plentitude of His goodness the Divine Hand formed the great\r\nmeadow between the Mississippi and Missouri, and the finger of Divine\r\nLove traced the streamlets and rivers that drain and fertilize its\r\nalmost every acre, He designated it not for the place of strife, but\r\nfor the home of peace and plenty, and intended that the ploughshare and\r\npruning hook should here achieve their greatest triumphs.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the year 1859, I bought from Dr. William P. Davis a\r\nquarter acre of ground just north of Bird's Addition in the city of Des\r\nMoines, having upon it an old square frame house without foundation or\r\ncellar, which I afterwards repaired and moved into with my family. My\r\nwife's sister Julia had been with us during the summer and became\r\nengaged to be married to Mr. John Alexander Woodard, a bachelor who had\r\nbeen engaged in the mercantile business and failed in the hard times of\r\n1856. He was then clerking and selling goods for Mr. Reuben Sypher. I\r\nthought it prudent and made condition with Mr. Woodard that he should\r\nmake it a part of the marriage contract with my sister-in-law that he\r\nwould purchase from Mr. Sypher in part payment of his wages the lot on\r\nthe corner of Fourth street and Crocker, and build them a house\r\nthereon. He readily agreed with this proposition, and the deed was made\r\nto Julia E. McMeekin, and the marriage took place on the first of\r\nDecember following, and a house was built on the lot the ensuing\r\nsummer, where they had their home for many years free from any\r\nannoyance from his creditors. When the bankrupt law took effect after\r\nthat, I obtained for him a discharge in bankruptcy from his old debts.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 I was chosen by the republican state convention of Iowa one of\r\nthe thirty-two delegates that represented our state in the great\r\nnational convention that met at Chicago and nominated Abraham Lincoln\r\nas its candidate for President. I attended that convention and had the\r\nhonor of being one of the eight original Lincoln men of the delegation,\r\nand voted for Mr. Lincoln on every ballot. That convention was perhaps\r\nthe greatest and most important that was ever convened in the history\r\nof our nation. The entire New York delegation was urging the nomination\r\nof William H. Seward. I was opposed to Mr. Seward's nomination, first,\r\nbecause I preferred Mr. Lincoln and had the most unbounded confidence\r\nin his honesty and patriotism, and secondly, because I disliked many of\r\nthe men who were urging Mr. Seward's nomination. The reputation of\r\nThurlow Weed and that class of New York politicians created in my mind\r\na distrust, and I felt that we had arrived at a crisis in our national\r\nhistory where we should take no chances.\r\n\r\nAfter the nomination of Mr. Lincoln at Chicago the republican state\r\nconvention met at Iowa City. I was a candidate before the convention\r\nfor nomination for the office of Attorney General of the state. Only\r\nthree of the delegates from my own county voted for me in that contest.\r\nMy principal opponent was John A. Kasson of Des Moines. He had been\r\nchairman of the republican central committee of the state for the\r\ncurrent year, and without my knowledge had been secretly corresponding\r\nwith various republicans of the state, soliciting their support for the\r\nnomination, and secretly hiding the fact from me, and professing to be\r\nmy friend and in favor of my nomination. Mr. H. M. Hoxie, also one of\r\nthe delegates of that convention from Polk county, had been a secretary\r\nof the state committee and was also secretly working for and with Mr.\r\nKasson for my defeat. I had many warm friends and supporters in the\r\nconvention, particularly from Lee and Van Buren counties and the\r\nsouthern part of the state, and many from other parts of the state with\r\nwhom I had formed a personal acquaintance whilst filling the offices\r\nrespectively of clerk of the house and secretary of the senate. There\r\nwere three other candidates for the nomination besides Mr. Kasson and\r\nmyself, and I received the nomination on the third ballot.\r\n\r\nAfter my return home I arranged my affairs so as to make an extensive\r\ncanvass of the state. I exchanged a small tract of land I had in the\r\nwestern part of Van Buren county with Mr. Manning for a covered buggy\r\nand harness and a pair of horses, and in the latter part of September\r\narranged a series of appointments, the first of which was at Newton, in\r\nJasper county. As my team was somewhat unaccustomed to the road I\r\nstarted one Sunday afternoon and drove east as far as Mitchellville,\r\nand stayed all night with my friend Thomas Mitchell of that place. On\r\nMonday morning I started early for Newton. I filled my satchel with\r\npolitical documents and occupied my time during the drive in trying to\r\narrange my speech. I never wrote out my speeches or attempted to commit\r\nanything to memory. My plan was to study the subject thoroughly that I\r\nproposed discussing, and simply arrange the order of its presentation.\r\nWhile absorbed in this work I reached Skunk river, drove up on the\r\ncauseway to the bridge, which at the entrance of the bridge was about\r\nsix feet above the level of the surface of the ground. As my off horse\r\nput his foot upon the first plank of the bridge it proved to be loose\r\nand the plank flew up, striking the shin of the other horse. At this my\r\nteam became frightened and commenced backing to the south of the\r\ncauseway, and for a moment I apprehended that I should be precipitated\r\nover the causeway with the horses and buggy falling upon me. I\r\ncollected the reins hastily in my left hand, seized the whip, yelled to\r\nthe horses, struck the off horse violently with the whip, using my left\r\nhand at the same time to draw them around onto the road so that they\r\nwould not take me over to the other side of the causeway. I felt the\r\nnear hind wheel of the buggy falling over the embankment, but the\r\nhorses sprang forward, unfortunately breaking the axle, and as I\r\nbrought them around into the road I stepped out of the buggy, threw the\r\nlines onto the wheel, and let them run. They did not run more than one\r\nor two hundred yards before the lines, which had caught in the wheel,\r\nwound them up, and the lines being strong it stopped them. I followed\r\nhastily, detaching the horses from the buggy, tied them to the trees,\r\nthen walked about two miles to a farm house where I engaged a farmer\r\nwith his farm wagon to take my buggy to Newton and to lend me a saddle\r\nupon which I rode one horse and led the other. In this way I reached\r\nNewton for late dinner, and taking my broken buggy to a blacksmith\r\nengaged for its immediate repair, as it was necessary for me to take\r\nthe road again early next morning to meet my next appointment, which\r\nwas at Grinnell, in Poweshiek county. I had a small audience that\r\nafternoon at two o'clock in the court house, and made them a short\r\nspeech, appointing another meeting for 7:30 that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning my vehicle was in good order and I took the road,\r\nreaching Grinnell in good time for my meeting, which was at night.\r\n\r\nIn arranging my appointments I reached the Mississippi river at\r\nClinton. Crossing the river I drove over to Mt. Carroll, Illinois, for\r\nthe purpose of a day's rest and to visit my relatives at that place. I\r\nfound there my aunt, Ann Austin, and her two boys, also her oldest\r\ndaughter, married to a man by the name of William Brotherton. Mr.\r\nBrotherton and the two boys were ardent republicans, and being advised\r\nof my coming, they had advertised me for a speech on Saturday night. I\r\nspoke to a crowded house for nearly three hours amid great enthusiasm.\r\nThe next day, Sunday, the county central committee waited on me and\r\ninsisted that I should arrange a week with them and speak at various\r\npoints in their county, which I necessarily declined to do.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon I drove north to a little mining village called\r\nElizabeth where my aunt, Sarah Nourse, a maiden sister of my father,\r\nwas then living and teaching school. I stayed all night at this town of\r\nElizabeth, and my aunt entertained me during the evening until nearly\r\neleven o'clock with an account of the various propositions of marriage\r\nshe had had from some half dozen bachelors and widowers, all of which\r\nshe had declined, giving as an all-sufficient reason for it that her\r\nsuitors were not men of education and sufficient intelligence to make\r\ncompanions for her, and she suspected them of wanting what little money\r\nand property she had.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Monday afternoon, I drove to Galena where I remained all\r\nnight and heard the cheering news of the result of the state elections\r\nof Ohio and Indiana, both states giving handsome republican majorities.\r\nThis really assured the success of Mr. Lincoln at the approaching\r\nNovember election.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Tuesday, I crossed the Mississippi river at Dubuque,\r\nhaving had an appointment to speak in Dubuque that day. It so happened\r\nthat the democrats had prepared for a grand democratic rally that day,\r\nat which Mr. Douglas, their candidate for President, expected to be\r\npresent. At the suggestion of my friends I stayed over until the next\r\nday. I was anxious to hear Mr. Douglas, and attended his meeting, which\r\nwas well attended by his followers and friends. I could not but feel\r\nsorry for and have some sympathy with the man when he came upon the\r\nplatform to speak. He had of course heard the news of the result of the\r\nelections in Ohio and Indiana, and knew that the hopes and aspirations\r\nof his life were forever blighted. Douglas was called \"the little\r\ngiant,\" and he truly was a brave man. He stood before the audience,\r\nknowing that his fate as a candidate for the presidency was forever\r\nsealed, but he never flinched or gave any evidence whatever of his\r\ndisappointment. I wished to hear Mr. Douglas, not because I expected to\r\nhear anything new, for I had studied well his speeches and knew his\r\nviews upon the subjects about which he was to talk, but I wished to\r\nstudy his method and manner, for I knew he was an experienced man upon\r\nthe platform. He never spoke a sentence without first inhaling a full\r\nbreath. He made his sentences short and never uttered a word when his\r\nlungs were exhausted. He always expressed himself in clear and concise\r\nlanguage, and I think never changed the construction of his sentences\r\nor attempted their construction after he had commenced their utterance;\r\nhence there was no confusion, no hesitancy, and no exertion of the\r\nvoice beyond what he anticipated when he began his utterances. I\r\nlearned much from his manner of speaking, and after that tried to\r\npractice his art and skill in the management of my voice, and I think\r\nwith some success, for during that canvass I frequently met our\r\nrepublican speakers with their throats inflamed and bandaged and so\r\nhoarse that they scarcely could be heard, whilst during the seven weeks\r\nthat I was engaged in speaking, I spoke on an average once or twice a\r\nday without any difficulty or hoarseness or inflammation in my throat.\r\nI frequently relieved my voice by dropping into a conversational tone,\r\nfinding this much easier for myself and much more agreeable to my\r\nhearers. I indulged frequently in anecdotes and amusing illustrations,\r\nand endeavored not only to convince the people by arguments but at the\r\nsame time to entertain them.\r\n\r\nI remained at Dubuque and spoke in the German theater on Wednesday\r\nnight. The republicans, of course, were enthusiastic and joyous. The\r\nresult of the elections in Ohio and Indiana had aroused and confirmed\r\ntheir hopes of success. I spoke from the stage of the theater for three\r\nlong hours. I interspersed my remarks with frequent anecdotes that were\r\nreceived by the audience with shouts of applause. At one time after the\r\ngeneral applause had partially subsided, some gentleman near the\r\norchestra box was seized with a second paroxysm of laughter, and\r\nactually rolled off his seat to the floor shouting and screaming with\r\ndelight. The entire audience arose to their feet, looking over the\r\nheads of those in front to see what had happened. I beckoned to them to\r\nplease be seated, that it was only one of the new converts that was\r\nshoutingly happy. This awakened another round of laughter and applause,\r\nand I think everyone, unless it might have been some disappointed\r\ndemocrat present, was uproariously happy.\r\n\r\nIt would not be profitable to undertake to give an account of my many\r\nmeetings during that canvass. I traveled about fifteen hundred miles,\r\nspoke in more than fifty counties of the state, continuing my labors up\r\nto the night before the November election.\r\n\r\nOne incident I recall that probably is worth recording: I spoke at\r\nGlenwood, in Mills county, to a large audience of ladies and gentlemen,\r\nand after discussing the political issues of the day I told them that\r\nthere was a matter of a personal nature that I had not yet mentioned\r\nand that I would communicate to them in confidence: that I had been\r\nnominated by the republican state convention as their candidate for\r\nAttorney General of the state, that after my nomination I was somewhat\r\ndoubtful as to the course I ought to pursue, whether or not it would be\r\nbest to stay at home and trust to the strength of my party, or whether\r\nI ought to go over the state and discuss the political questions of the\r\nday and let the people know and hear for themselves what manner of man\r\nI was, that they might judge for themselves as to my competency to fill\r\nthe important office for which I was a candidate. That in all cases of\r\ndoubt or difficulty I had made it a rule to consult my wife, and I laid\r\nthe matter before her, asking her advice as to what she thought it was\r\nbest for me to do; that she immediately decided that I must go and\r\nspeak to the people and let them see and hear me, adding that I could\r\ntrust the people, that the people of Iowa beyond question knew and\r\nappreciated a good man when they could see and hear him. The audience\r\nshouted their applause at this conclusion of my address, and when I\r\ncame down from the platform many friends came and shook hands with me,\r\nand especially the ladies, assuring me that the decision of my wife was\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election is a matter of history. Mr. Lincoln received\r\nthe electoral vote of Iowa by some fifteen thousand majority, as did\r\nalso every candidate on the republican ticket, including myself. At the\r\nclose of my first term I was renominated and re-elected without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe duties of my office as Attorney General of the state consisted in\r\nadvising the Governor and state officers when called upon by either of\r\nthem for my opinion, and also when requested by that body to give my\r\nopinion to the general assembly, also to represent the state in all\r\ncriminal cases appealed to the supreme court of the state. Our supreme\r\ncourt at that time met twice a year; to-wit, in April and October, in\r\nthe city of Davenport, Iowa, and my duties required me to attend there\r\nduring the sessions of the court. The judges of the court, a reporter,\r\nand myself, and most of the attorneys visiting the court from time to\r\ntime, boarded at the Burtis House, an excellent hotel kept by Dr.\r\nBurtis at that time. It made up a pleasant party, and it was rather a\r\npleasant episode in my professional life. The only important opinion I\r\nwas called upon to give to the general assembly was as to the\r\nconstitutionality of the proposed law providing for the soldiers' vote.\r\nThe supreme court of Pennsylvania had held a similar statute under\r\ntheir constitution to be unconstitutional and void. I examined the\r\nquestion carefully, because it was one of great importance. So many of\r\nour loyal voters in the state were absent from the state as soldiers in\r\nthe Civil War, and there was a great danger that those who sought to\r\nembarrass the prosecution of the war might place in control of our\r\nstate affairs men inimical to the cause of the Union and nation. I gave\r\nan opinion to the legislature that the proposed law was constitutional.\r\nIt was passed and afterwards sustained by the unanimous opinion of the\r\njudges of our supreme court, and from that time forward there was no\r\nquestion about the political status and conduct either of our state\r\nlegislatures or our representatives in the national congress.\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of the Civil War the legislature of Iowa was\r\ncalled together in extra session, and enacted a law providing for the\r\nissuing of $800,000 of war defense bonds to be sold for the purpose of\r\nproviding means to equip and muster into service the troops to be\r\nfurnished by Iowa for the national cause. It also provided for three\r\nstate commissioners with authority to put these bonds upon the market\r\nand sell the same at the best rate they could obtain. A number of other\r\nstates in the Union had also provided for the issuing of bonds and the\r\nraising of means to arm and equip their soldiers. Hence when these\r\ncommissioners went to New York for the purpose of putting our bonds\r\nupon the market, no desirable bids could be obtained. Our Secretary of\r\nState, Elijah Sells, had been ordered or requested by Governor Kirkwood\r\nto take these bonds to New York in order that they might be ready for\r\ndelivery in case of sale. There was danger to be apprehended that the\r\ncommissioners might attempt to hypothecate these bonds, or pledge them\r\nfor a loan of money. The bonds bore eight per cent interest per annum,\r\nand they would constitute a great prize if the money sharks could get\r\nhold of them and sell them at any price they might bring in a money\r\nmarket then flooded with similar paper. Being advised of the situation,\r\nI accompanied the Secretary of State to New York, at my own instance\r\nand expense, for the purpose of advising the Governor and commissioners\r\nthat under the law they had no authority to pledge or hypothecate these\r\nbonds, but could only sell them in the manner expressly provided by the\r\nstatute. I had an opportunity of giving this advice, which I did very\r\nreadily in New York, and I had the satisfaction of seeing the bonds\r\nbrought back to our state and sold at a fair price to our own people.\r\n\r\nMy salary as Attorney General was one thousand dollars a year and a\r\ncontingent fund of four hundred dollars additional each year. My\r\nofficial duties occupied about one-half of my time, and I continued in\r\nthe general practice, except as to criminal cases, which yielded me\r\nabout fourteen hundred dollars additional, making my income during\r\nthese four years about twenty-eight hundred dollars which was rather\r\nmore than any state officer or even judge of the supreme court received\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nUpon the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln in 1860 John A. Kasson, the man\r\nwhom I had defeated for the nomination of Attorney General of the\r\nstate, went to Washington City and secured the appointment as Second\r\nAssistant Postmaster General, which position he held until the fall of\r\nthe year 1862, when he secured the nomination for congress from the\r\nrepublican congressional convention of this, the then fifth\r\ncongressional district.\r\n\r\nUpon the election of Mr. Lincoln in 1865 for his second term, I became\r\nan applicant for the position of United States District Attorney,\r\nputting my application in the hands of Senator Harlan. I also had\r\nletters from all of our members of congress and from Senator Grimes\r\nfavoring my appointment. Mr. Kasson claimed that the appointment fell\r\nin his congressional district and he was entitled by courtesy to\r\nnominate the person who should receive it. Mr. Withrow, who was still a\r\npersonal and political friend of Mr. Kasson, came to me personally and\r\nstated that if I would write to Mr. Kasson and signify my willingness\r\nto receive the appointment as coming through him, that Mr. Kasson would\r\nhave the appointment made. I accordingly wrote to Mr. Kasson, stating\r\nthat if he was disposed to recommend my appointment upon considerations\r\nof my fitness for the office and without reference to any supposed\r\npersonal obligations to favor his political aspirations for the future,\r\nthat I would be willing so to receive it. Upon receiving this letter,\r\nMr. Kasson immediately went to the President and presented to him the\r\nname of Caleb Baldwin, of Council Bluffs, stating that Senator Harlan\r\nhad been consulted and had agreed to Mr. Baldwin's appointment. Mr.\r\nHarlan, upon being advised of what Mr. Kasson had done, immediately\r\nwent to the President, and at his request the appointment was\r\nsuspended. On the 14th day of April ensuing, Mr. Lincoln was\r\nassassinated and Andrew Johnson, the Vice President, succeeded to the\r\npresidency. I immediately requested Mr. Harlan to pursue the subject of\r\nmy appointment to the office no farther, and there the controversy\r\ndropped. I have regarded my disappointment in this matter as rather\r\nfortunate than otherwise, as I was not in harmony with the\r\nadministration of Andrew Johnson and should not have cared to have held\r\noffice under his administration.\r\n\r\nPending the presidential election the people of Iowa were fully advised\r\nas to the threats that were made that in case of Mr. Lincoln's election\r\nthe southern states would secede from the Union. They were also fully\r\naware of the fact that the then national administration was doing all\r\nit could to encourage the southern politicians who were uttering these\r\nthreats. The position of Mr. Buchanan's administration was that the\r\nconstitution of the United States conferred on the National Government\r\nno power to coerce a state, or, in plain terms, to preserve the nation\r\nand prevent its disintegration. The fact that civil war might be\r\ninaugurated and was threatened in case Mr. Lincoln was elected was well\r\nunderstood and duly considered. The people of Iowa indulged in no\r\nfeelings of hatred toward the people of any state or section of the\r\nUnion. There was, however, on the part of the majority a cool\r\ndetermination to consider and decide upon our national relations to the\r\ninstitution of slavery, uninfluenced by any threat of violence or civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of Mr. Lincoln and the call for troops to aid in\r\nputting down the rebellion, I visited Washington City for the first\r\ntime in my life. The rebel troops occupied the entire country between\r\nRichmond and Manassas and menaced the national capital. On the Saturday\r\nbefore the battle of Bull Run, so-called, I went in company with some\r\nfriends in a carriage as far as Fairfax Court House. I saw there a\r\nnumber of Union soldiers that had been wounded the day before in the\r\nartillery engagement with the rebel general, Beauregard. I returned to\r\nWashington Saturday night and arranged with General Curtis, then our\r\nmember of congress from Iowa, to go out in the morning by rail to the\r\nplace of the anticipated battle. I remained at Alexandria until after\r\nnoon on Sunday with the hope of getting transportation on the railway.\r\nWe could hear the booming of the cannon during the afternoon. I\r\nremained in Alexandria till about two o'clock. On finding the expected\r\ntransportation on the railway delayed and doubtful, I returned to\r\nWashington. About midnight we received news of the disastrous results\r\nof the engagement that day. The next morning, Monday, I started home on\r\nan early train, as my professional engagements that week required my\r\npresence in Des Moines. During the great struggle that followed for the\r\npreservation of our nation I spent much of my time and all of my income\r\nin traveling over the state and attending public meetings, and made\r\nfrequent addresses in behalf of the Union cause. I did not enter the\r\nvolunteer service as a soldier or officer of the Union army for the\r\nreason that I was satisfied I could do more good to the cause in the\r\nposition I then occupied as Attorney General of the state. I did at one\r\ntime apply to Governor Kirkwood for a military appointment as a major\r\nin the Third Iowa Cavalry. He very bluntly told me that he did not\r\nthink he could spare me from the place that I then filled, and he did\r\nnot think it good policy to spoil a good lawyer for the sake of making\r\na poor soldier. I had no military education and no knowledge of\r\nmilitary affairs, and my health was such that I could not have been of\r\nany use to the service except in a position where I could take better\r\ncare of myself than was possible as a soldier in the ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRESUMES THE PRACTICE OF LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of my second term of office, to-wit, January, 1865, I\r\nresumed the practice of law. The firm of Williamson & Nourse, which had\r\nexisted since my settlement in Des Moines in 1858, had taken into\r\npartnership Jacob M. St. John, formerly of Keosauqua, Iowa. As I now\r\nhad to depend entirely upon my practice for my income I dissolved\r\npartnership with Messrs. Williamson and St. John and commenced to\r\npractice alone.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1865 Judge Gray, the judge of our district court, died,\r\nand Governor William M. Stone, without any solicitation upon my part,\r\nat the request of a number of the members of the bar of Polk county,\r\nOctober 16, 1865, appointed me to fill the unexpired term of Judge\r\nGray, deceased. The salary of this position at that time was only $1300\r\na year, and I accepted of it after considerable hesitation. At the\r\nfirst term of court I held in the city of Des Moines it became my duty\r\nto try a number of cases for a violation of the laws of the state\r\nprohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, except beer or wine made\r\nfrom grapes or other fruit grown in this state. This wine and beer\r\nclause of the law had been adopted by the legislature by way of an\r\namendment to what was called the Maine law that had been enacted by the\r\nlegislature at its session in 1854-5. A number of saloons had been\r\nestablished in Des Moines and licensed to sell native wine and beer,\r\nbut in fact they all sold whiskey and other spirituous liquors. The\r\ngrand jury had indicted some seventeen of these saloons as public\r\nnuisances under the law. The courts in Iowa prior to this time had\r\nadopted the policy of imposing slight fines upon these saloons about\r\nonce a year, thereby establishing the very worst and the most\r\nreprehensible kind of a license. The sheriff and other officers of the\r\ncounty, elected by the people from time to time, were largely under the\r\ninfluence of these saloons and their patrons. When I called the first\r\nof these cases for trial it became necessary to fill up the jury panel\r\nfrom the bystanders, and when the sheriff called the name of a person\r\nthat he directed to take a place upon the jury, I accidentally noticed\r\nthat the next case for trial was a case against a defendant of the same\r\nname of the person called into the jury-box. I privately called the\r\nsheriff to my side and asked him if the person that he had placed upon\r\nthe jury was the same person as the defendant in the next case, accused\r\nof a like offense of the one we were to try. After some hesitation he\r\nsaid he thought he was the same person. I told him that was not a\r\nproper discharge of his duties, that he must fill up the panel of the\r\njury with good, law-abiding citizens, and not from those who stood\r\ncharged with crime on the records of the court. He suggested that I\r\nshould excuse the juror. I told him no, the mistake was his and not\r\nmine, and that he must correct his own mistakes, that he should go to\r\nthe juror himself and tell him and have him stand aside, and that he\r\nmust be very careful whilst I presided in that court not to make any\r\nmore such mistakes. The result was that he filled up the panel with\r\ngood law-abiding citizens, and that defendant and sixteen others were\r\ntried and convicted within the next ten days. I did not pass sentence\r\nupon any of the defendants until all the trials were completed. In the\r\nmeantime I was visited by a number of temperance men who felt anxious\r\nto know what character of sentence I was going to give to these\r\npersons. I told them it was not proper for me to receive any\r\nsuggestions out of court, and if they had any to make it must be made\r\nin open court in the presence of the defendants themselves or their\r\ncounsel. I did, however, give the matter very grave and serious\r\nconsideration. This law in its spirit and in its letter was intended to\r\nprohibit the sale or establishing or keeping a place for the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors, other than the wine and beer excepted by the\r\nprovisions of the law. The slight fines that had theretofore been\r\nimposed for this offense had simply been tolerated, and amounted in\r\npractice to a system of licensing these violations of the law. I felt\r\nit my duty to do something that should prohibit what the law\r\nprohibited. After the trials were all over I had the defendants all\r\nbrought into court and gave them my views concerning the law and\r\nconcerning the duty of every good citizen to obey and observe the law\r\nstrictly and in good faith; that this law existed upon the statute\r\nbooks by the same authority as the law that protected them in their\r\npersons and in their property, and that the disregard of it was simply\r\nto set at defiance the authority from which all our laws eminated. The\r\nman who kept the poorest and meanest of these saloons I fined only the\r\nsum of one hundred dollars, stating as a reason therefor that the\r\nwitnesses upon the trial had said they were ashamed to be seen in his\r\nsaloon and hurried away as soon as possible; that probably the class of\r\nmen of whom he was making drunkards were not our most valuable\r\ncitizens. I graded the fines against the others of the sixteen\r\naccording to the class of persons I thought they were injuring, and the\r\nhighest fine I imposed was five hundred dollars, against the man who\r\nhad taken the trouble to prove in the trial that he kept a most\r\nrespectable resort and that none but the very best citizens of the city\r\nwere in the habit of drinking at his bar. This action upon my part not\r\nonly created an excitement locally, but the news of it spread rapidly\r\nthroughout the state and a number of our district judges followed my\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Charles Clinton Nourse_\r\n  From an air brush copy of an old photograph loaned by\r\n  D. W. Nourse, Kenton, Ohio]\r\n\r\nWhen I assumed the duties of judge of the district I found the dockets\r\nmuch crowded with cases that had been delayed, chiefly because of the\r\nunnecessary consumption of time by attorneys in the trial of their\r\ncauses. For instance, one case in Polk county that involved only the\r\nquestion of the identity of a calf worth three or four dollars had\r\noccupied two weeks of the time of the court in its former trial. When I\r\ncalled the case for trial a number of attorneys suggested to me that\r\nthe case would probably consume the balance of the term, and they might\r\nas well dismiss their witnesses and continue their causes. I told them\r\nthat they were probably mistaken as to the time that would be occupied\r\nin the trial of that case. The first witness in behalf of the plaintiff\r\nwas a timid young girl about fourteen years of age, a daughter of the\r\nplaintiff. She told in a simple straightforward way what she knew about\r\nthe marks on the calf that her father had claimed, and her belief that\r\nit was her father's calf. The attorney for the defendant unfortunately\r\nwas somewhat under the influence of liquor, and putting both heels up\r\non the trial table, he leaned back and in a very rude, aggressive\r\nmanner addressed the young girl, saying, \"I suppose you put in about\r\nall of your time examining the calves on your father's farm, don't\r\nyou?\" I immediately reproved the attorney and asked him if he had any\r\nquestions to ask the witness in regard to the marks upon the calf or\r\nits identity. He replied in a haughty manner that he supposed he could\r\nexamine the witness in his own way and ask his own questions. I\r\nimmediately told the witness to stand aside and asked the plaintiff to\r\ncall the next witness. The attorney then said he had not cross-examined\r\nthe witness and wished to do so. I merely remarked that I had given him\r\nan opportunity to do so and he had not improved it, and he could save\r\nhis strength for the next witness. The result of this kind of\r\ndiscipline was that the case was tried within two days instead of two\r\nweeks, and the great calf case was disposed of. I only give this as a\r\nspecimen of the reforms that I tried to introduce into our courts.\r\n\r\nIn the most of the counties of our district, which embraced seven at\r\nthat time, we had no court houses. My first court in Warren county had\r\nto be held in the old Methodist church. It had been the custom to fill\r\nthe aisles and the space about the altar with saw-dust, with one table\r\nas the trial table for the attorneys, and four or five rickety chairs.\r\nThis saw-dust when it became heated, as it did in the winter time from\r\nthe large stoves used in heating the room, filled the air with very\r\nfine particles of dust that often settled upon the lungs of the members\r\nof the bar and the court, and was itself injurious to health. After\r\nimpaneling the grand jury on the first day of the term at Indianola I\r\nannounced that the court would adjourn until Tuesday and that the\r\nsheriff would clean the room of this sawdust and furnish matting for\r\nthe aisles and the place about the platform, and also furnish an\r\nadditional table for the use of the attorneys and a dozen good\r\nsubstantial chairs. The sheriff informed me in open court that the\r\nboard of supervisors had refused to furnish such conveniences, and\r\nprobably would not allow the bills if he should purchase these\r\narticles. I advised him that it was his duty to obey the orders of the\r\ncourt, and to present his bill to the supervisors and if they failed to\r\nallow the bill to take his appeal to the district court and I would see\r\nthat he recovered judgment and got his pay. Sufficient to say that the\r\nnext morning the matting was laid, the table and chairs were furnished\r\nin good order, and I never heard of any difficulty about the allowance\r\nof the bills by the board of supervisors. I pursued the same policy in\r\nMadison and several other counties of the district, and never heard\r\nthat I lost favor with anybody because I insisted on having a decent\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March, 1866, at a subsequent term of the court held in\r\nWarren county, Mr. Thomas F. Withrow, an attorney of the Polk county\r\nbar and my neighbor, came into court one morning just before noon in\r\ncompany with John A. Kasson, then a representative in congress from\r\nthis district and a resident of the city of Des Moines. Mr. Withrow\r\nfiled with the clerk of the court a petition for divorce in behalf of\r\nMr. Kasson's wife, and asking for a divorce on the grounds that Mr.\r\nKasson had been guilty of adultery. To this petition Mr. Kasson filed\r\nan answer admitting his guilt, and both parties asked for an immediate\r\nhearing of the cause. I dismissed the jury then impaneled and announced\r\nthat the court would not adjourn but remain open for business, asking\r\nthe clerk and sheriff to remain, and that the bystanders and others\r\nwere at liberty to retire. I read over the papers carefully and told\r\nMr. Withrow that I could not grant the petition upon the answer; that\r\nif he had any evidence it must be produced in open court as I must be\r\nsatisfied of the existence of the facts alleged in the petition. Mr.\r\nWithrow said he had the letters of the defendant written to his wife\r\nfrom time to time, fully acknowledging his guilt, and he would return\r\nto the hotel and get his satchel containing these letters and produce\r\nthem in open court if I required it. Mr. Kasson then begged of Mr.\r\nWithrow not to produce those letters, and turning to me said he would\r\nhimself be a witness as to the facts and thought that ought to be\r\nsufficient. I told him I could not grant a divorce that would have the\r\nappearance of being granted merely upon the consent of the parties,\r\nthat I wished to be satisfied fully that there was no collusion in the\r\nmatter between himself and wife, and that he was in fact guilty as\r\ncharged. He assured me that there was no collusion, that the charge was\r\nactually true and that the facts actually existed as charged against\r\nhim. At this he broke down and professed almost to cry, and I told Mr.\r\nWithrow to prepare the decree of divorce. It was accordingly prepared,\r\nreciting that it was granted upon evidence of the truth of the\r\nallegations of the petition, and I accordingly signed the decree.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Des Moines at the close of the session, the\r\nlegislature then being in session, I was waited upon by one or more\r\nmembers of the general assembly, suggesting that there was a rumor that\r\nthe divorce of Mr. Kasson's wife had been procured and granted simply\r\nby consent of parties, and they proposed to introduce a bill for an act\r\nto prevent such divorces in the future. I explained that the rumor was\r\nentirely unfounded and that the divorce had been granted upon\r\nsatisfactory evidence offered in open court. I recite these facts at\r\nsome detail because of their importance with reference to results, and\r\nwhat occurred that fall, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson was a candidate for re-nomination to congress. The opposing\r\ncandidate was General G. M. Dodge, then a resident of Council Bluffs. I\r\ndid not take any active part in this contest further than to express my\r\npreference for General Dodge, and that I could not consistently, with\r\nmy views of propriety, support Mr. Kasson under the circumstances. When\r\nthe conventions were held that fall for nominating delegates to the\r\nconvention that should nominate congressmen, district judge, and\r\nprosecuting attorney, the Polk county convention, being under the\r\ncontrol of Kasson's friends, nominated the same set of delegates to\r\nattend both the congressional and the district conventions. After very\r\nheated contests in the convention for nomination of congressmen, Mr.\r\nKasson was defeated, and I was informed by the delegation that they\r\nwould not support me for the nomination for district judge because I\r\nhad refused to help them in the matter of nominating Mr. Kasson. The\r\nnext day when the convention met for the nomination of judge and\r\ndistrict attorney I went before the convention in person and withdrew\r\nmy name from the convention, stating as a reason therefor that I could\r\nnot with propriety be a candidate before that convention without the\r\nsupport of the delegates from my own county. The convention nominated\r\nMr. Maxwell, then district attorney, for judge. My office did not\r\nexpire until the ensuing January, but I at once sent my resignation to\r\nthe Governor of the state, thus terminating my judicial career on\r\nAugust 1, 1866.\r\n\r\nIn this contest for congress, Mr. H. M. Hoxie and Mr. Thomas F.\r\nWithrow, formerly warm friends and supporters of Mr. Kasson, had\r\nabandoned him and were active supporters of General Dodge.\r\n\r\nUpon my retirement from the bench, the members of the Polk county bar\r\nhad a meeting and adopted very complimentary resolutions which they had\r\nenrolled and were kind enough to present to me as a testimonial of\r\ntheir approval of the manner in which I had discharged my duties as\r\njudge of the court.\r\n\r\nThe salary of judge of the district court at that time was the meager\r\nsum of thirteen hundred dollars a year, out of which I paid my own\r\nexpenses on the district. During my term of office as Attorney General\r\nI had spent a considerable part of my income in attending public\r\nmeetings and traveling through the state, addressing public assemblies\r\nupon the issues growing out of the war. I had not accumulated\r\nsufficient means to pay for my homestead and I now determined, as far\r\nas practicable, to devote myself to my practice as an attorney and\r\naccumulate something for the future.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Governor William M. Stone, his private\r\nsecretary had endorsed a number of warrants issued by the Treasurer of\r\nthe United States in favor of the state of Iowa, known as \"swamp land\r\nwarrants.\" Governor Stone had entrusted the detail of the business of\r\nhis office to his private secretary. These warrants came into the hands\r\nof the secretary and he assumed the responsibility of endorsing the\r\nGovernor's name upon them from time to time, and having them cashed at\r\nthe Second National Bank. At first he paid this money over to the State\r\nTreasurer, but as no inquiry was made as to the transactions and\r\nGovernor Stone was paying but little attention to the details of\r\nbusiness in the office, he cashed a number of these warrants and\r\nappropriated the money to his own use and purchased considerable real\r\nestate in his own name.\r\n\r\nOn the first of January following, these transactions became public and\r\nthe Governor repudiated the authority of the secretary to make the\r\nendorsements upon the drafts. He procured from the secretary mortgages\r\nupon considerable of the property purchased by him to secure so much of\r\nthe proceeds of these drafts as remained unaccounted for. The grand\r\njury indicted the secretary for a number of these transactions for\r\nforging the Governor's signature. This secretary applied to me through\r\nMr. Withrow, about the time of my resignation as judge, to employ me as\r\ncounsel to assist in his defense. The secretary had no money or means\r\nto pay me for my services and as he already had able and efficient\r\ncounsel, I declined the employment.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time suits were brought to foreclose these mortgages\r\ngiven by the secretary, and also to hold the bank responsible for the\r\nmoneys that had not come into the hands of the State Treasurer. Pending\r\nthese suits of a civil character, by agreement of the parties and their\r\ncounsel, the case was referred to me as referee. During the summer I\r\noccupied several weeks in taking the testimony carefully before a\r\nstenographer and reported the same with my conclusions of fact and law\r\nto the district court, which report was confirmed by the district court\r\nand upon appeal to the supreme court by the secretary, that court also\r\naffirmed my decision, and under these judgments the property was sold\r\nand the state partly remunerated for the loss.\r\n\r\nGovernor Stone also solicited me to act as special prosecutor in\r\nprosecuting the indictments against the secretary for forgery, but in\r\nconsideration of the fact that the secretary had failed to obtain my\r\nservices in his defense because of his poverty, I declined to take any\r\nretainer or part in the prosecutions.\r\n\r\nI only recite these matters here because the secretary for his own\r\npurposes saw proper to make a number of virulent attacks upon me in\r\nvarious scurrilous articles that he published. As he was a man of no\r\nreputation and soon after left the state and died in obscurity and\r\npoverty, it is not necessary here to notice them.\r\n\r\nThe indictments against the secretary were never tried, I think, for\r\nthe reason that the trial would necessarily have exposed the fact of\r\nthe Governor's carelessness and inattention to the detail of his\r\nofficial duties. The Governor was otherwise not to blame for these\r\nunfortunate results and was himself free from any taint of dishonesty\r\nor corruption.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my determination to retire from politics and devote\r\nmyself entirely to the practice of law, the republican state\r\nconvention, in the fall of 1867, without any procurement or\r\nsolicitation upon my part, selected me as chairman of the state central\r\ncommittee. I conducted the canvass that resulted in the election of\r\nColonel Samuel Merrill. The entire cost of this canvass, including the\r\nemployment of a secretary to the committee, was only the sum of $800,\r\none-fourth of which the candidate for Governor contributed. I make note\r\nof this, for the reason that in later years, and at the time of the\r\npresent writing, these central committees of the states and of the\r\nnation, are expending thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars\r\nupon the election of the candidate of their party.\r\n\r\nI also at the time I was chairman of the state central committee,\r\nfurnished a team to Messrs. Thomas F. Withrow and F. W. Palmer, the\r\nlatter then editor of the _Register_, to make a political canvass\r\nthrough the western half of the state. The very next year, 1868, Mr.\r\nPalmer became a candidate for congress in this district, Mr. Kasson\r\nbeing again a candidate for a seat in congress and again defeated in\r\nthe nomination. I attended the congressional convention which was held\r\nat Council Bluffs that year, and was well satisfied with the result.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1869 Judge George G. Wright, before that time one of\r\nthe judges of the supreme court of the state of Iowa, and who had\r\nremoved from Keosauqua and become a permanent citizen of Des Moines,\r\ncalled upon me to confer with me upon the subject of his election to\r\nthe United States Senate. He was fearful that Mr. John A. Kasson, who\r\nhad been a member of the house of representatives of the state the last\r\nprevious session, would be a candidate for the state senate. He\r\nexpressed himself as having no confidence whatever in Mr. Kasson's\r\nfriendship toward him, and he desired me to be a candidate and seek the\r\nnomination for the position of state senator. I peremptorily declined,\r\nfor the reason that I did not want to engage in any political fight or\r\ndifference with Mr. Kasson, and I could not afford at that time to\r\nleave my practice for a place in the state senate. Judge Wright\r\ninsisted that he must have a friend in the senate from Polk county upon\r\nwhom he could rely, and urged me to name some one who could be\r\nnominated and elected. After canvassing the names of several gentlemen,\r\nI suggested the name of B. F. Allen, then the leading banker in western\r\nIowa, giving as my reason for urging Mr. Allen's name that the friends\r\nof Mr. Kasson would not present Mr. Kasson's name in opposition to Mr.\r\nAllen at that time, and the further reason that the people of Des\r\nMoines would at the then coming session of the general assembly ask for\r\nan appropriation to commence the building of a permanent capitol, and\r\nthat Mr. Allen by virtue of his influence through the western part of\r\nthe state especially could probably do more than any other man to\r\nsecure such an appropriation. Judge Wright replied that the name of Mr.\r\nAllen had been suggested, but that he was satisfied that that gentleman\r\nwould not accept of the nomination because his business required his\r\nundivided attention. I suggested to Judge Wright that I thought I was\r\nbetter acquainted with Mr. Allen than himself, and that if a number of\r\nour friends would call upon Mr. Allen, one at a time, suggesting and\r\nurging him to be a candidate for the senate, in less than ten days he\r\nwould not only be willing but anxious to receive the nomination. We\r\naccordingly pursued that course, and my prediction was verified. Mr.\r\nAllen became a candidate and received the nomination, but this did not\r\nprevent Mr. Kasson from again being a candidate for the nomination to\r\nthe lower house.\r\n\r\nAt the ensuing session of the legislature the desired appropriation for\r\na permanent capitol at Des Moines was secured and Judge Wright was\r\nelected to the United States Senate, defeating William B. Allison who\r\nwas then, for the first time, a candidate for that position.\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson worked diligently to secure the appropriation for the\r\ncapitol, as did also Mr. Allen in the senate and George W. Jones, Mr.\r\nKasson's colleague, in the house.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Des Moines were very deeply interested in this\r\nappropriation for the permanent capitol, and every one, including the\r\nladies, brought to bear all proper influence upon the members to secure\r\ntheir votes for it. The great event of the winter socially was a grand\r\nparty given by Mr. Allen in the splendid mansion which he had just\r\nfinished, situated on Terrace Hill, now the property of Mr. F. M.\r\nHubbell. The ladies of the town also gave an old fashioned concert at\r\nMoore's Hall, and an amateur theatrical performance at its close, of\r\nwhich I had the honor to be the author. The play was a farce\r\nillustrating the absurd features of a general assembly of the state of\r\nIowa whose members were one-half ladies and the other half gentlemen.\r\nThe play represented a session of the general assembly of the state of\r\nIowa in the year 1900. The old capitol building, then occupied by the\r\nlegislature, was supposed to have fallen down and to have killed a\r\nnumber of the members of the sitting general assembly, and one of the\r\nbills discussed by the mock legislature was a proposed appropriation\r\nfor the benefit of the surviving families of the members who had lost\r\ntheir lives in the destruction of the old capitol. The great discussion\r\narose upon a motion to strike out the sum of sixty-two and one-half\r\ncents, and many of the speeches that had been made against the\r\nappropriation for the new capitol upon the question of economy were\r\nlargely quoted from, by those opposed to the sixty-two and one-half\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nAnother point made in the play was that upon the question of woman's\r\nrights. Dubuque county was supposed to be represented by a lady\r\nweighing over two hundred pounds, and her husband, a dwarf, then\r\nresiding in the city, who weighed about seventy pounds. Whenever a vote\r\nwas taken upon any question respecting the rights of their sex the\r\nlegislature divided, the men voting on the one side and the women\r\nalways on the other. The lady who was supposed to be the wife of the\r\ndwarf, whenever a rising vote was taken upon a question of this nature,\r\nseized her supposed husband by the coat collar and tried to compel him\r\nto stand up and be counted on the side with the ladies. The frantic\r\nefforts of the little fellow to desist and to vote with those of his\r\nown sex created uproarious applause and amusement for the audience, as\r\ndid also the following part of the play:\r\n\r\nThe lady supposed to be the wife of the dwarf arose and addressed the\r\nspeaker upon a question of privilege. She said she had just received a\r\ntelegram from home, stating that her youngest child was taken suddenly\r\nill, and she requested the house to grant leave of absence for her\r\nhusband, as it was very desirable that he should return home and care\r\nfor the sick child. Another member of the house, a gentleman, arose and\r\ninquired whether the sick child was a boy or a girl. The lady responded\r\nwith some acrimony that all her children were girls of whom she boasted\r\nshe had seven, and was proud of it.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the city entered into this play with much spirit and\r\nperformed their parts so admirably that it furnished a very rich\r\nentertainment for the winter.\r\n\r\nThe bill making the appropriation for the erection of the permanent\r\ncapitol finally became a law, and Mr. Kasson attempted to monopolize\r\nfor himself all the glory of the achievement. He had a brass band\r\nserenade him at his house, and John P. Irish of Iowa City make a\r\ncongratulatory speech to him as the hero that had accomplished so much\r\nfor the city of Des Moines.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1874 Mr. Kasson was again nominated as the republican\r\ncandidate for congress and was successful in the election. In this\r\ncontest he was opposed by the then editors of the _Register_, a\r\nnewspaper at that time published by the Clarkson brothers.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of September, 1874, Mr. J. C. Savery, a citizen of\r\nDes Moines at that time, and for several years a client of mine, called\r\nupon me and showed me several letters in manuscript, relating to Mr.\r\nKasson's conduct while a member of the legislature of Iowa, and while\r\na member of congress, and stated that he proposed to publish those\r\nletters as he was opposed to Mr. Kasson's election. He asked my advice\r\nas his attorney as to whether or not there was anything in the letters\r\nthat would make him liable to a civil suit for damages in case of their\r\npublication. I advised him that if the letters were published and any\r\nsuit was brought against him it would be necessary to show either the\r\nabsolute truth of them or that they were published from proper motives\r\nand that he had a good reason to believe that the statements were true.\r\nAs Mr. Savery had been my friend and client, and had not been at all\r\nprominent in political life, I advised him as a friend not to mix up in\r\nthe contest and not to publish the letters, as he was a private citizen\r\nhaving no special interest in the question as to who would or would not\r\nbe elected to congress. He, however, determined that the letters should\r\nbe published and he gave them to the _Register_ for publication. These\r\nletters were a very severe arraignment of Mr. Kasson's political\r\ncareer, and he thought proper to commence suit in the district court of\r\nPolk county against Mr. Savery and the editors of the _Register_ for\r\nlibel. Such a suit was brought October 21, 1874. Mr. Savery requested\r\nme to meet Mr. Clarkson for the purpose of consultation and with a view\r\nto my employment, in connection with Colonel Gatch, to defend the suit.\r\nI stated to them that the trial of the cause would involve a good deal\r\nof labor and time, that in the then state of political excitement, it\r\nwould be very difficult to obtain a favorable result as the partisans\r\nof Mr. Kasson, if they secured a place upon the jury, would hardly give\r\nmuch weight to the testimony that might be produced. I signified,\r\nhowever, that I was willing to take the employment, provided I was paid\r\nliberally for my professional services. To this Mr. Richard Clarkson\r\ndemurred very strongly, insisting that as Mr. Kasson was at least a\r\npolitical opponent and enemy of mine I ought to be willing to defend\r\ntheir case for an opportunity to ventilate the character of the\r\nplaintiff in the suit. I stated to Mr. Clarkson that if I engaged in\r\nthat suit it would be for the purpose of performing my duty as an\r\nattorney and officer of the court, and that I should under no\r\ncircumstances allow any personal matters of my own to influence what I\r\nmight have to do or say in regard to the case; that the court room was\r\nnot the place for a lawyer to gratify his personal feelings toward any\r\nof the parties to the litigation. This conference terminated without\r\nany agreement as to my employment. Afterwards, Mr. Savery came to me to\r\nsee me alone and stated that Colonel Gatch had named a very small sum\r\nthat he was willing to accept as compensation for assisting in the\r\ntrial of the case. Mr. Savery urged upon me that he was then in poor\r\ncircumstances financially and not able to pay any large fee; that he\r\nhad been my client and paid me considerable sums of money in times past\r\nand urged upon me that I ought to stand by him now in the time of his\r\ntrouble; that if I would accept of a like amount that Colonel Gatch had\r\nagreed to take for his services, he, Mr. Savery would pay half, and the\r\nClarksons would pay the other half. I finally agreed to these terms. I\r\ntried the case. It consumed very considerable time in its preparation\r\nand trial. I copy here for information as to the character and scope of\r\nthis case the opening statement that I made to the jury in regard to\r\nthe issues involved, and the evidence that the defendants would offer\r\nin support of their defense. I always regarded the opening statement of\r\na case as very important and that it should give to the jury a clear\r\nidea of the case they were to try, and of the facts upon which my\r\nclient relied. I always believed strongly in the importance of first\r\nimpressions, and I give this as a specimen of my skill in that behalf\r\nand for the further purpose of showing that it is utterly free from\r\npersonal feeling or ill will toward the plaintiff. The following is the\r\nopening statement as made and reported and published at that time:\r\n\r\n    With permission of the Court, Gentlemen: In a case like this, it is\r\n    hard for jurors to divest themselves entirely of their relations,\r\n    politically and socially, to parties, and come to the consideration\r\n    of it as a dry question of fact under the instruction of the court.\r\n\r\n    The petition that has been read to you selects from certain\r\n    articles that were published during the political canvass last\r\n    fall, three certain items of charges made against Mr. Kasson that\r\n    it is supposed by Mr. Kasson and his friends cannot be proved. Why\r\n    those three particular charges out of quite a number should have\r\n    been selected and the others passed by, I do not know. Probably any\r\n    one of the other charges damaged him as much as any one of these.\r\n    But for some reason best known to the plaintiff, he has been\r\n    willing to stand all the injury and all the damage they did;\r\n    because he didn't care about having them investigated in court. (He\r\n    has a right to pick out and say this one is not true, and the other\r\n    is not true, I put you on the proof of this.) These three\r\n    particular charges are set out, and they claim so much damages for\r\n    saying these particular things about this particular individual.\r\n    The answer I will read to you and then try to give you some idea of\r\n    the evidence that will be introduced on the part of the defendants.\r\n    [Here Mr. Nourse read the answer relating to the first charge, and\r\n    continued.]\r\n\r\n    The facts are, these articles were written by Mr. Savery, and\r\n    published in the _Register_, which was conducted and published\r\n    by the defendants, Mr. R. P. Clarkson and Mr. J. S. Clarkson.\r\n\r\n    [Reads from petition again, beginning with the words: \"Now, sir,\r\n    this was the way you played your hand.\"]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Nourse continued: That is the answer we make to the first\r\n    charge, relating to what is called the Smoky Hill route. I will\r\n    say, in order that you may understand the evidence, and the facts\r\n    in reference to that business, that Mr. Kasson was our member of\r\n    congress in 1866, as will appear by the testimony, living and\r\n    residing in this town, having for his colleagues Messrs. Price,\r\n    Wilson, Allison, Judge Hubbard, and Mr. Grinnell. At that time one\r\n    of the most vital questions to the people of Iowa, especially to\r\n    the people of this congressional district, was whether or not the\r\n    roads running east and west through Iowa should connect with, and\r\n    become a part of the great Pacific route, extending from the\r\n    Atlantic to the Pacific ocean. Prior to 1866 congress had passed a\r\n    law to aid the construction of the Pacific Railway. That law\r\n    provided for several Iowa branches, and provided for a branch\r\n    connecting with the St. Louis roads through Kansas, and provided\r\n    that all these branches should unite at what is known as the one\r\n    hundredth meridian, some distance west of Omaha. And a further\r\n    provision in that bill was that the Union Pacific Railroad Company\r\n    should build from the one hundredth meridian westward, meeting the\r\n    road that should be built from California eastward. That was the\r\n    Union Pacific Railroad proper. It will appear in evidence,\r\n    gentlemen, that Mr. Kasson, up to the very moment, the very day and\r\n    hour on which he gave this vote in congress, had publicly and\r\n    privately expressed himself in favor of the Omaha route, and\r\n    delivered a public lecture against the Smoky Hill route, and\r\n    explaining to the people of this locality the great advantages they\r\n    were to derive from being upon the main line of this great\r\n    thoroughfare. It will further appear in evidence, gentlemen, that\r\n    the Kansas company, with the Pennsylvania Central road--in\r\n    combination with the St. Louis interests--devised a scheme, in the\r\n    winter of 1866, whereby they proposed to make the Kansas road,\r\n    connecting with St. Louis, the main branch of the Pacific road, and\r\n    thus entirely defeat the building of the roads westward to the\r\n    hundredth meridian, connecting with the Iowa roads. That was the\r\n    scheme that was undertaken, and a bill having that object was\r\n    rushed through the senate and came to the house of representatives,\r\n    when Thaddeus Stevens took charge of it. The friends of the bill\r\n    made a strong combination, refused to let it be referred to a\r\n    committee, and refused even to allow it to be printed for the\r\n    information of the house, and put it upon its passage under the\r\n    spur and whip, crushed out debate, and crushed out explanation\r\n    and discussion. Mr. Kasson was the only member of the house of\r\n    representatives from Iowa that was permitted by Thaddeus Stevens,\r\n    who had the floor, to occupy the time of the house, and to the\r\n    surprise of everyone Mr. Kasson was found to have gone over to the\r\n    enemy. We have the depositions of Hiram Price and James F. Wilson,\r\n    and the _Congressional Globe_ that will explain to you his false\r\n    position. Mark the explanation Mr. Kasson attempted to make on the\r\n    floor of congress. He based his defense simply on the claim that\r\n    the Kansas branch road would make a _rival road_ and afford\r\n    competition.\r\n\r\n    This, gentlemen, will appear in evidence when we come to\r\n    investigate this matter. It does not answer the proposition and but\r\n    for the fact that the money was speedily raised and the road built\r\n    from Omaha to reach the hundredth meridian, before the Kansas\r\n    branch got their road built there, we would have lost everything;\r\n    we would have lost all that congress had granted to us, to build\r\n    the road up the Platte Valley. This has been carefully concealed by\r\n    Mr. Kasson in all his explanations and in all his discussions and\r\n    he has, with his oily, deceptive subterfuges, tried to hide this\r\n    enormity of his past life from his constituents. We hope,\r\n    gentlemen, aided by the evidence of these members of congress,\r\n    intelligent men, honest men, who have stood by the people of\r\n    Iowa--we hope, with their depositions and the circumstances, and\r\n    the evidence contained in the _Congressional Globe_, to show this\r\n    matter up to you. We will prove to you by men who were on the\r\n    ground that no sufficient motive could honestly have induced that\r\n    man to have cast his vote in the way he did; that it was a surprise\r\n    upon every intelligent man that knew what his pledges and promises\r\n    and professions had been up to that time. Now, when this man\r\n    offered himself as a candidate for congress last fall a year ago,\r\n    one of the defendants in this case, who never was a candidate for\r\n    office in his life, who had no interest in politics whatever,\r\n    except as a citizen interested in our material interests, in our\r\n    city, in our state, took the responsibility upon himself to ask Mr.\r\n    Kasson through the public press to explain this, his extraordinary\r\n    conduct and his treachery to his constituents; he got no answer\r\n    except the insufficient one, the deceptive one, that Mr. Kasson\r\n    wanted a rival railroad. Again, gentlemen, it will further appear\r\n    in evidence that this was an additional subsidy of lands, that\r\n    instead of connecting with the main line at the one hundredth\r\n    meridian, this Kansas company was authorized to change its route\r\n    and build the road to Denver, from Denver up to Cheyenne, and\r\n    receive all the lands on either side of whatever route they may fix\r\n    upon, and not requiring them to unite with the main line until they\r\n    got fifty miles west of Denver. That they received on the line from\r\n    Denver to Cheyenne the heart of the Territory of Colorado. That was\r\n    a subsidy, and that the road got that subsidy, and that the parties\r\n    who passed the bill undertook to deceive the members of congress in\r\n    regard to it.\r\n\r\n    Now, gentlemen, this is all there is on this first matter. This\r\n    publication was made, public attention was called to the fact that\r\n    one of our members of congress, when asked how he would explain Mr.\r\n    Kasson's vote, said he didn't know; but he could have taken\r\n    twenty-five thousand dollars for his vote. That statement was made\r\n    public by Mr. Savery in this communication to the citizens of this\r\n    congressional district. Now this is the first matter which Mr.\r\n    Kasson has chosen to bring before you, and to make an issue, and\r\n    claim for damages to his character. Now we cannot prove--Mr. Kasson\r\n    knows--we have no facilities for proving who was around there, or\r\n    what money they had, or the means by which that bill was passed by\r\n    congress. We can show you, gentlemen, only this one thing, that as\r\n    a citizen of Iowa and as a representative of Iowa he betrayed his\r\n    constituents wantonly; that he was in a scheme in which there was\r\n    money; that is all; that this communication was made to the public,\r\n    stating the bare facts at a time when it was necessary for the\r\n    public to know them and by a man who had no interest in maligning\r\n    Mr. Kasson, or injuring him. Savery had no personal feeling, and\r\n    had no personal animosity towards him, but he felt, as a citizen,\r\n    some indignation towards the man for the course he had pursued in\r\n    congress. So much, gentlemen, for the first charge that was made.\r\n    You are to judge whether that communication at the time it was\r\n    made, and under the circumstances it was made, was justifiable. You\r\n    are to take all the facts, and all the testimony with regard to it.\r\n    Now as to the second matter that is set out in the answer.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Barcroft: Will you just tell the jury whether the bill that Mr.\r\n    Kasson voted for under the Iowa Railroad were not built on the\r\n    continuous line?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Nourse: I have already stated, that but for the extraordinary\r\n    efforts by which money was raised, and the road pushed to the\r\n    hundredth meridian first and this scheme defeated, we would never\r\n    have been on the main line. But no thanks to Mr. Kasson for it. We\r\n    are on the main line because these men went to work with superhuman\r\n    energy to get to the hundredth meridian first, and they got there\r\n    first, and that is the reason we are on the main line. If we had\r\n    not reached it before they did, we would not have had a dollar of\r\n    money with which to have built our line, and the other would have\r\n    been the main line. That is the fact as it will appear conclusively\r\n    from the testimony in this case. Gentlemen, I invite your special\r\n    attention to the second charge, for if I can succeed in getting the\r\n    jury to understand this question it is the end of the plaintiff's\r\n    case. Fortunately for us on this question we have pretty conclusive\r\n    proof, and with all the gentleman's ingenuity and that of his\r\n    counsel, he will not be able to escape. We will show you,\r\n    gentlemen, that in the year 1868 the old Des Moines Valley Railroad\r\n    Company had forfeited her rights to the grant of lands that had\r\n    been granted to her in the year 1858, by reason of not building the\r\n    road as the original act required. The people of Boone county were\r\n    dissatisfied because the Des Moines Valley Railroad Company had\r\n    surveyed their road west up by Grand Junction, instead of going up\r\n    the Des Moines river. Mr. Orr introduced a bill called the\r\n    resumption bill, No. 139, in the house of representatives. That\r\n    bill was read the first and second times, was ordered to be\r\n    printed, and was referred to the railroad committee, of which Mr.\r\n    Kasson was a member. The railroad committee prepared a substitute\r\n    for that bill, as is set out here, in which they provided for a\r\n    release of the company from all forfeitures and still allow them to\r\n    have the lands and to build their road upon certain terms and\r\n    conditions, and reported that bill back to the house of\r\n    representatives as a substitute for house file No. 139. That\r\n    substitute, gentlemen, is in Mr. Kasson's own handwriting, and we\r\n    will be able to produce it here and show you the bill as he\r\n    reported it originally to the house of representatives.\r\n\r\n    The records will show you, gentlemen, that after that bill came in,\r\n    after this substitute was reported, Wilson of Tama county, with\r\n    another gentleman constituting a minority of the committee on\r\n    railroads, made a minority report in which they recommended what\r\n    was called the \"Doud amendment,\" or the Granger clause of that\r\n    bill, in which they provided as set out in the answer: \"that the\r\n    company accepting the provisions of this act was at all times to be\r\n    subject to legislative control.\" I will give you the very language\r\n    of the amendment as it now appears in the law, so you may get the\r\n    idea fully. [Reads.] \"The company accepting the provisions of this\r\n    act shall at all times be subject to such rules, regulations and\r\n    rates of tariff for transportation of freight and passengers as may\r\n    from time to time be enacted by the General Assembly of the State\r\n    of Iowa.\" The minority of the committee recommended that amendment,\r\n    and it was adopted; and it was the only amendment that ever was\r\n    adopted by the legislature.\r\n\r\n    We will prove to you, gentlemen, that a forgery was committed, and\r\n    the following words interpolated into that bill: \"But the\r\n    non-acceptance by the Des Moines Valley Railroad Company of this\r\n    act shall not prevent all the foregoing provisions thereof from\r\n    having the same operation and effect as if the same had been\r\n    accepted by said company;\" and we will prove to you that these\r\n    words were agreed upon between Mr. Kasson and the railroad\r\n    company's attorney, in a private room in the Savery House, and that\r\n    he agreed to put them in the bill, and the attorney testifies that\r\n    the provision escaped criticism. And this is the second charge: We\r\n    charge him with so manipulating that bill as purposely to defeat\r\n    the will of the legislature. That he did it fraudulently, and that\r\n    he did it corruptly will be proved to you beyond a doubt; that this\r\n    charge was made, honestly believing it to be true, in order that\r\n    the people of this congressional district might know the character\r\n    of the man that was asking for their suffrages. After he voted\r\n    against Wilson's amendment, and failed to honestly defeat it, we\r\n    are prepared to show that by an agreement between him and the\r\n    general attorney of the road, he undertook to get this nullifying\r\n    clause into the bill, and that he did get it in the bill, and that\r\n    he did not get it there by the vote of the house.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Barcroft: You do claim that you have any such allegation in\r\n    your answer?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Nourse: I claim that what we charge Kasson with was that he\r\n    manipulated that proviso through the legislature, and we propose\r\n    to prove it. We propose to prove that it came _from him_ and\r\n    originated _with him_. We may have other evidence on this point\r\n    more full and complete that it is not necessary now to take the\r\n    time to detail.\r\n\r\n    The third specification, gentlemen, relates to the vote of Mr.\r\n    Kasson and his conduct with reference to the C., R.I. & P.R.R.\r\n    Co. And here, fortunately, I can say to you that we are not without\r\n    direct and satisfactory testimony. We thought that we could prove\r\n    that he had taken money on both sides from both parties in the\r\n    case, but we haven't succeeded fully. We have evidence, however, of\r\n    this state of facts: That Mr. Kasson in the early part of that\r\n    session voted for a bill that had for its purpose and object the\r\n    helping of Tracy, who was then the president of the road, to retain\r\n    his power and his place as president, and to complete the road from\r\n    here to Council Bluffs; that a bill for that purpose was passed in\r\n    the early part of the session and approved on the 11th of February,\r\n    and that Mr. Kasson voted for it. Thus far all was right. It will\r\n    further appear by the evidence that the legislature had a recess of\r\n    a few weeks after that, and that Kasson disappeared from here and\r\n    turned up in Wall street, New York; that he was found in conference\r\n    with the men connected with the Northwestern Railroad and who had\r\n    bought up the stock of the Rock Island road, with a view of\r\n    obtaining control of it, who were anxious to secure the repeal of\r\n    the Tracy bill. We will prove to you that Kasson promised these men\r\n    his influence to have that bill repealed; that he came back to Des\r\n    Moines and was in conference with them, promising them his aid,\r\n    that he subsequently changed his mind and abandoned them, that they\r\n    didn't succeed; and that Mr. Tracy out of sheer gratitude, as\r\n    Kasson claims, offered him five hundred dollars in money; that he\r\n    (Kasson) took the money, but stipulated that it should be called a\r\n    retainer.\r\n\r\n    In his own deposition Kasson swears he got the money. But he says\r\n    he didn't get the money until after the legislature adjourned, and\r\n    when it was offered to him as a present, he said he couldn't accept\r\n    of it unless it was offered to him as a retainer; and that Mr. B.\r\n    F. Allen, who offered him the money, went away and came back again,\r\n    and said that he could take it as a retainer; and that he supposed\r\n    that Allen had seen Mr. Tracy. This is the way Kasson gets out of\r\n    this. We will prove to you by Mr. Tracy that he never had retained\r\n    Mr. Kasson, or authorized anybody else to retain him for the\r\n    company; that he never requested Kasson to perform any professional\r\n    services for that road; that he never performed any professional\r\n    services for the road, and that he had been out of the practice of\r\n    the law for years. It will further appear in evidence that Mr.\r\n    Kasson has not practiced law since 1860; that this attempt to make\r\n    it a retainer is simply a subterfuge to cover up the taking of pay\r\n    for his services in the legislature, to a railroad corporation.\r\n    Now, this all came to the knowledge of these defendants, and they\r\n    proposed, in good faith, to publish to the community the facts in\r\n    regard to Mr. Kasson's conduct. It is said by plaintiff's attorney\r\n    that they will show to you that the Clarksons were the personal\r\n    enemies of Mr. Kasson. I will say to you, gentlemen, that it is not\r\n    true, and that I don't believe they will prove it; I don't believe\r\n    in this community they can prove a thing that is not true. On the\r\n    contrary, the Clarksons never had any personal or political\r\n    difficulty with Mr. Kasson whatever. Every motive on earth that\r\n    could induce men to act through favoritism was upon the other side\r\n    of the question.\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson had no desire to face his accusers, or subject himself to an\r\nexamination before the jury. He was not present at the beginning of the\r\ntrial and had taken the precaution to have his own deposition taken in\r\nNew York upon interrogatories doubtless prepared carefully by himself,\r\nas the interrogatories disclosed nothing as to the explanation he had\r\ninvented for the purpose of rebutting the testimony against him. This\r\nwould avoid any cross-examination.\r\n\r\nAfter the defendant's testimony had been introduced in part, however,\r\nthe evidence seemed to make quite an impression against the plaintiff's\r\ncause and his counsel in desperation telegraphed to him requiring him\r\nto come at once to Des Moines. After a few days, he put in his\r\nappearance and I immediately had a subpoena issued and served upon him,\r\nrequiring his attendance as a witness. After we closed our evidence,\r\nMr. Kasson disappeared between two days and we searched for him in vain\r\nin the state. His counsel, Mr. Barcroft, offered his deposition taken\r\nin New York, then as rebutting testimony, when the following colloquy\r\noccurred, which I here quote from the notes of the official reporter:\r\n\r\n    Judge Nourse, for the defense, asked to have Mr. Kasson brought\r\n    into court, stating that a subpoena had been issued for him, and as\r\n    he was not present, asking an attachment for him. Mr. Barcroft\r\n    replied: \"Whether he will be here or not, I don't know. I think he\r\n    is out of the state. I don't know that he will be here, and I don't\r\n    know that he will not, but think the probabilities are that he will\r\n    not. We don't claim the right to read his deposition if he is\r\n    present. He is not present, and is not in the state. I don't expect\r\n    him to be here.\"\r\n\r\nThe deposition was then read.\r\n\r\nAs already anticipated, the jury could not agree upon a verdict. Six of\r\nMr. Kasson's political friends upon the jury insisted on finding in his\r\nfavor, and six who were not his political supporters and friends, some\r\nbeing democrats and some republicans, insisted on not finding a verdict\r\nin his favor. The case went over the term and was afterwards\r\ncompromised upon what terms I never understood, except that the\r\nplaintiff dismissed his suit and probably paid the costs, and Mr.\r\nSavery advised me that as part of the terms upon which the suit was to\r\nbe dismissed, Mr. Kasson was to make a political speech at Moore's\r\nOpera House and Colonel Gatch and the Clarksons were to occupy the\r\nplatform as indicative of their friendly appreciation of that\r\ngentleman, and I also with Mr. Savery was entitled to a like honor. Mr.\r\nSavery did not appear upon the platform and I utterly refused to\r\nrecognize the right of anyone to contract for my appearance there, and\r\nI was conspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nMr. Savery paid me his half of the fee that I was to receive for my\r\nservices, and upon presenting my bill for the other half to Mr. Richard\r\nClarkson, I found he had charged me up for printing the speech I had\r\nmade to the jury, having at my request printed the revised copy of the\r\nspeech in pamphlet form, and thus he squared the account, never paying\r\nme one cent for my services in the case.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _707 Fourth Street, Des Moines_,\r\n  For twenty-seven years the home of Charles Clinton Nourse]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSOME IMPORTANT LAW SUITS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope or purpose of this writing to enter into or\r\ndiscuss the merits of the various suits in which I was employed. I\r\ncannot, however, give any idea of the fifty years of my life during\r\nwhich I was engaged in a number of important suits, without reference\r\nto their nature and character, and the management to which I attributed\r\nimportant results.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year 1864, whilst in attendance at the\r\nsupreme court at Davenport, I was retained by the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern Railroad Company, in company with Mr. Thomas F. Withrow,\r\nto assist the general counsel of that corporation in a suit, then\r\nrecently brought in the United States circuit court for the southern\r\ndistrict of Iowa, enjoining the company and its agents and employees\r\nfrom putting a certain span of their bridge across the Mississippi\r\nriver at the town of Clinton, Iowa. Mr. James Grant of Davenport and a\r\nMr. Lincoln of Cincinnati had been employed by the river interests to\r\nprevent the completion of this bridge on the ground that it would prove\r\nan obstruction to the navigation of the river. Mr. Withrow and myself\r\nspent a day in examining the alleged obstruction to navigation, the\r\ncompany furnishing us a steamboat in which we passed through the piers\r\non which the drawbridge was to be placed. We returned to Des Moines\r\nlate Saturday evening. The United States circuit court at Des Moines\r\nmet the following Monday. On Sunday Mr. Withrow went to his office and\r\ncarefully examined the statutes of the United States relating to the\r\npowers of the court in granting injunctions. He sent for me in the\r\nafternoon. On examination we ascertained that the statute of the United\r\nStates contained a peculiar provision, not known to the practice in our\r\nstate courts. It provided that when an injunction was granted in\r\nvacation by the judge of the district court of the United States, it\r\nshould remain in force only until the close of the ensuing term of the\r\ncircuit court; that if the injunction was granted by one of the judges\r\nof the supreme court or a judge of the circuit court of the United\r\nStates, it should remain in force until it was dissolved by the order\r\nof the court. We immediately opened telegraphic communication with\r\nGeneral Howe, who was then attorney of the Chicago & Northwestern\r\nRailroad Company, and had in charge the defense of the case. He and\r\nJudge Grant, it seems, had been engaged in taking depositions and\r\nprocuring evidence with reference to the question of obstruction of the\r\nnavigation by the existence of these piers in the river, and both\r\nGeneral Howe and Mr. Grant appeared to be acting upon the hypothesis\r\nthat it was necessary for the defense to make a motion and showing for\r\nthe dissolution of the injunction. We called the attention of General\r\nHowe to the provisions of the United States statute, and as we were\r\nwell acquainted with the peculiarities of Judge Grant we advised that\r\nif we did nothing upon the part of defense at the ensuing term of\r\ncourt, it was probable that Grant would take no action in the matter\r\nand the injunction would stand dissolved at the close of the term by\r\noperation of law. On examination of the question General Howe agreed\r\nwith our conclusions, and we then arranged that he take the train on\r\nMonday morning and come as far as Ames, Iowa, bringing with him all\r\nevidence, depositions, and papers that we might need in case there was\r\nto be any hearing before the court; that General Howe should occupy a\r\nboxcar at Ames and not subject himself to personal observation, whilst\r\nwe would take charge of the interests of our client at Des Moines and\r\ndo nothing save to let the law take its course, and we would advise\r\nGeneral Howe by telegram if Judge Grant woke up and attempted to obtain\r\nany order of court continuing the injunction. Judge Grant was in\r\nattendance upon the court, and several times inquired after General\r\nHowe, stating that he was expecting him daily. Day after day of the\r\nterm passed and nothing was done. Finally, the business of the term\r\nbeing disposed of, Justice Miller, then justice of the supreme court of\r\nthe United States and presiding, announced that if there was no further\r\nbusiness before the court the term would be adjourned. Judge Grant\r\naddressed the court and stated that he had been waiting during the\r\nentire term expecting the appearance of General Howe; that he\r\nunderstood that Messrs. Nourse and Withrow had been employed in behalf\r\nof the defendants, but no motion had been filed with reference to the\r\ninjunction in the case against the bridge company or railroad company,\r\nand he wished to know whether or not we intended to do anything. Mr.\r\nWithrow looked at me and placed upon me the responsibility of replying\r\nto judge Grant's remarks. I said that it was true that Mr. Withrow and\r\nmyself had been employed in the case, but only as local counsel and the\r\nonly authority we had was to act under the instructions of the general\r\ncounsel of the railroad company, General Howe; that we had no authority\r\nor direction to file any motion in the case, and I added very meekly\r\nthat if any harm should come to our clients by reason of any neglect in\r\nthe matter the responsibility would rest entirely with General Howe and\r\nnot with my Brother Withrow and myself. Upon this Judge Grant announced\r\nthat he had to go to Washington City upon professional business\r\nimmediately upon adjournment of the court, and he would not consent\r\nthat any motion would be heard in regard to the injunction matter in\r\nvacation. This closed the event and the court adjourned sine die. As\r\nJudge Miller passed out of the court house down the stairs, Judge Grant\r\nhaving previously left the room, Mr. Withrow could hardly contain\r\nhimself and burst into uproarious laughter and attracted the attention\r\nof Judge Miller, who looked over his shoulder and remarked\r\ngood-naturedly that he supposed Judge Grant did not understand us. As\r\npreviously arranged, the mechanics engaged in the bridge construction\r\nhad carefully prepared their timber and every bolt necessary for the\r\nspan that should make up the drawbridge between these two piers. Judge\r\nGrant went his way to Washington, and upon his return to Iowa three\r\nweeks afterwards he found the cars in operation crossing the bridge. He\r\nimmediately went to Judge Love, and making the necessary affidavits for\r\ncontempt of court, obtained warrants for the arrest of the parties\r\nengaged in constructing the bridge. Without disclosing what our\r\nknowledge and view of the law was upon the subject, the parties at once\r\ngave bond and security for their appearance at the next term of court\r\nto answer the charge of contempt. When the next term of court convened,\r\nJustice Miller and Judge Love presiding, I made the necessary motion to\r\ndischarge the defendants upon the ground that the injunction had been\r\ndissolved by operation of law immediately upon the adjournment of the\r\nprior term of court, and there being no injunction in force, the\r\ncompletion of the bridge did not constitute any contempt of court. The\r\nmotion was sustained and the defendants discharged.\r\n\r\nJudge Howe and Judge Blodgett of Chicago were so delighted with the\r\nresult, that they telegraphed to Chicago for a case of wines and\r\ninviting Judge Grant and Mr. Lincoln of Cincinnati, who represented the\r\nplaintiffs in the case, into our room, we spent a very merry evening\r\ntogether and all seemed to enjoy the evening save Judge Grant who could\r\nhardly forgive himself for his over-confidence which had resulted\r\nfatally to his clients.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening many excellent anecdotes were indulged in: among\r\nothers was one by Judge Blodgett for the benefit of plaintiff's\r\ncounsel. He said in the early history of the lawyers who were in the\r\nhabit of traveling the circuit in Illinois, they had a gentleman come\r\namong them who would never admit that he had made a mistake. The\r\nattorneys were accustomed to amuse themselves in the evening at the\r\nhotel, and among other amusements they had a game called \"kicking the\r\nslipper,\" which consisted in inducing some green victim to put a\r\nslipper upon one foot and attempt to throw it into the air and kick the\r\nslipper with the other foot before it reached the floor. One evening\r\nthey induced the over confident attorney to undertake the experiment,\r\nwith the result that he came flat upon the floor in the attempt to kick\r\nthe slipper with the other foot. The other lawyers thereupon greeted\r\nhim with a hearty round of laughter, but he sprang to his feet and said\r\nto them, \"Now, gentlemen, you needn't laugh, you needn't think you\r\nfooled me, for I want you to understand that I had no sooner struck the\r\nfloor before I understood that it was a trick.\" Mr. Lincoln was a\r\nmerry, good-natured man and enjoyed this anecdote at his expense very\r\nmuch, but Judge Grant hardly saw the application of Judge Blodgett's\r\nanecdote.\r\n\r\nAt the next session of congress the railroad company obtained the\r\npassage of a law constituting the bridge a part of the mail route of\r\nthe United States, and the court subsequently dismissed the plaintiff's\r\ncase. Thus we were successful in gaining our case by knowing when it\r\nwas best to do nothing. The use of the bridge was invaluable to our\r\nclients, and the railroad company sent me a draft for two hundred\r\ndollars as compensation for the short speech I had made advising Judge\r\nGrant in the court that we had no instructions to do anything in the\r\ncase, and the responsibility of our failure to do anything, if\r\ninjurious to our client, would rest with General Howe, attorney in\r\nchief of the road.\r\n\r\nWhilst upon this question of management I will give you an account of\r\nanother case of some importance that resulted in our complete success\r\nbecause we did something that we did not learn out of any of our law\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nA certain young woman in the last stages of consumption had been turned\r\nout of the house of her near relatives, and compelled to take up her\r\nquarters in a second-class hotel in Des Moines during her last\r\nsickness. She had made a will in which she willed to the Catholic\r\npriest of the city, Father Brazil, a valuable tract of land for the use\r\nand benefit of the Catholic church. After her death her relatives, who\r\nhad neglected her shamefully during her sickness, brought suit to\r\ncontest the validity of this will upon the ground of undue influence on\r\nthe part of Father Brazil, and mental incapacity on the part of the\r\ndeceased. Judge Kavanaugh, a young bachelor then about thirty years of\r\nage and a member of the Catholic church, and since then judge of the\r\ncourt in Chicago, Illinois, had been employed by Father Brazil to\r\ndefend the suit, and he subsequently came to me and retained me to\r\nassist him in the trial of the cause. During the sickness of the\r\ndeceased she had employed a professional nurse, a young woman about\r\nthirty years of age. We were informed before the trial came on that the\r\nrelatives who were contesting the will had been very courteous and kind\r\nand generous toward this young nurse woman, and during the holidays had\r\nmade her valuable presents in consideration of her kindness to the\r\ndeceased. At the opening of the term I noticed this young woman came\r\ninto court, receiving the courtesies and attention of Judge Cole, who\r\nwas counsel for the relatives that were contesting the will. She was\r\nrather a handsome woman, evidently intelligent and quick-witted, rather\r\nfond of admiration, and as she was to be the star witness for the other\r\nside of the case, I at once made up my mind that the whole case must\r\nturn upon her testimony. As the deceased had been frequently under the\r\ninfluence of opiates, administered by the physician for the purpose of\r\nrelieving her suffering from time to time, it would be a very easy\r\nmatter for a young woman gifted as this one was with facility of\r\nspeech, to make the most of the incoherent utterances of the patient\r\nwhile under the influence of opiates. I foresaw that it would not do to\r\nsubject this young woman to a severe cross-examination or say anything\r\nthat implied that we doubted her honesty or veracity, and yet something\r\nmust be done or we were sure to lose our case. I took my young bachelor\r\nfriend, Judge Kavanaugh, to one side and told him wherein we were in\r\ndanger, and as he was a member of the same church and was himself an\r\nIrishman, and had no doubt \"kissed the Blarney stone,\" it was\r\nabsolutely necessary for him to cultivate the acquaintance of this\r\nwitness, even to the very verge of proposing matrimony. I told him I\r\ncould easily attend to the law of the case, the cross-examination of\r\nthe witnesses, but this witness was outside my jurisdiction. He readily\r\nagreed to undertake the part of the case that I assigned to him. He\r\naccompanied the lady to and fro from her hotel at every adjournment or\r\nsitting in the court, and she evidently was very much pleased with his\r\nattentions. I cautioned him not to talk too much about the case, but\r\ntalk of other things that he would find probably more agreeable\r\nsubjects of conversation to the witness and to himself. He performed\r\nhis part so admirably that when Judge Cole called upon his star witness\r\nshe proved a flat failure upon his hands. She said yes in answer to his\r\nquestions, that when the deceased was under the influence of her\r\nopiates she was a little flighty, but that amounted to nothing, that\r\nwhen the influence of the opiate was gone she was perfectly rational\r\nand capable of understanding what she was doing at all other times. The\r\nresult was that the jury found a verdict in our favor and the will was\r\nsustained. Judge Given, however, who was a member of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch, seemed to be disappointed at the result of the suit, and set\r\naside the verdict and granted the parties a new trial. From this action\r\nof the court we took an appeal to the supreme court, and the supreme\r\ncourt reversed Judge Given's decision, holding that there was no\r\nevidence that would have justified the jury in finding against the\r\nvalidity of the will, and they remanded the cause with orders to the\r\ndistrict court to render judgment in our favor. In conversation with\r\nFather Brazil after the case was over we were discussing the probable\r\nreasons that induced Judge Given to set aside the verdict of the jury.\r\nI suggested that perhaps he had been reading Eugene Sue's remarkable\r\nwork called _The Wandering Jew_. I asked Father Brazil if he had\r\never read that book. He smiled pleasantly and said yes, and when I\r\nexpressed my surprise that he should indulge in such literature, he\r\nremarked very calmly that he always thought best to know what the world\r\nwas saying about his church and people.\r\n\r\nI will give here also next an account of the most important criminal\r\ncase I ever defended. A man by the name of Yard had shot and killed a\r\nparty by the name of Jones. He claimed that he pointed a shotgun over\r\nthe shoulder of his wife at the time Jones was approaching his wife\r\nabout to commit an assault upon her for an illegal purpose, when he\r\nfired the gun and Jones fell dead as a result. Jones had come onto the\r\npremises where Yard and his wife resided, having in each hand a bucket\r\nwith which he was supposed to be intending to go to a well for water.\r\nThe buckets were found some distance, probably twenty-five or thirty\r\nsteps from the door, and the prosecution claimed that the buckets\r\nindicated the place at which the deceased was at the time he was fired\r\nupon and killed. Yard and his wife were both in jail at the time I was\r\nsent for, and the first thing I did was to enjoin upon them the\r\nnecessity of absolute silence and refusal to answer any questions or to\r\ncommunicate with any party or parties who might possibly thereafter\r\ntestify against them. Upon a preliminary trial before the justice I\r\nwaived an examination of the case and had the defendants enter bail for\r\ntheir appearance at court. A man by the name of Smith, who was the\r\nowner of the gun with which the deceased was shot and who had loaned it\r\nto Yard only a few days before, was indicted with Yard and his wife as\r\naccessory to the crime. As the defense in this case would depend\r\nentirely upon the testimony of Yard and his wife I at once appreciated\r\nthe absolute importance of having these parties tell the exact truth\r\nwithout equivocation or invention. My experience as a lawyer had taught\r\nme that persons deeply interested in the result of the trial,\r\nparticipating in a transaction such as the killing of another, are\r\nsubject to such a state of nervous excitement that they frequently do\r\nnot remember with any degree of accuracy the collateral facts and\r\ncircumstances attending the more important events, and persons of\r\nordinary intellect imagine it is important that they should be able to\r\nrecollect and answer accurately every question that is made in regard\r\nto the collateral facts and circumstances attending the principal\r\nevent, and almost invariably they invent answers to such questions and\r\npretend to know what really they do not know and do not recollect. The\r\nresult is that they involve themselves in contradictions and\r\nimpossibilities, and let confusion destroy even the reliable and\r\ntruthful parts of their evidence, and this was what I feared in this\r\ncase. I was accused by some members of the bar and outsiders of\r\ntraining these parties as witnesses in their own behalf, and in one\r\nsense of the word it was true, but I only trained them to tell the\r\ntruth, carefully eliminating from their story and had them eliminate\r\neverything that I was satisfied upon thorough examination was the\r\nresult of their invention instead of their recollection. I first\r\nexamined each of the parties separately and took down their statements\r\ncarefully, and after comparing them tried to make up my mind as to what\r\nwas absolutely true and as to what part of their story was invention. I\r\nthen brought the parties together and discussed with them such parts of\r\ntheir story as I was satisfied had been supplied by them and had them\r\nadmit and concede that they did not distinctly recollect the matter as\r\nstated. I repeated this process the third time. In some manners the man\r\nand his wife differed as to their recollections as to some things that\r\nhad happened, and when I was satisfied that the difference was honest I\r\nmade no effort to correct or to reconcile their statements, for my\r\nexperience also taught me that absolute coincidence in every particular\r\nof their statements would tend rather to discredit than to confirm the\r\ntruth of what they related. Another difficulty in the trial of the case\r\nwas the excitable temperament of Mrs. Yard, and what I feared most was\r\nthat the prosecutor by severe cross-examination might make her angry\r\nand she would display some temper and make some statement that would\r\ninjure her case. When she was upon the stand under cross-examination by\r\nJudge Given, who was then the prosecuting attorney, I kept my eye upon\r\nthe woman carefully. She was under examination at least three hours,\r\nand only once did the prosecutor succeed in exciting her so that she\r\ndeveloped any passion. He said to her in a very abrupt and preëmptory\r\nmanner, \"Now please turn and face that jury and tell them that you\r\nremoved those buckets from the doorstep to the place where they were\r\nfound.\" As she turned in a passion to face the jury, flushed with\r\nexcitement, I was fortunate enough in catching her eye and fixing her\r\nattention a moment, when her passion subsided, and in a very calm\r\nlady-like way she said, \"Gentlemen, I did remove those buckets from the\r\ndoorstep and place them out in the yard just as I have heretofore\r\nrelated.\" She said this in such a calm lady-like way that I was\r\nsatisfied we had gained our case. I proved, of course, the bad\r\ncharacter of the deceased and that he was a bad and dangerous man, and\r\nalso the good character and reputation of the husband, which indeed had\r\nbeen and was unimpeachable up to that time. I examined in this case\r\nover seventy witnesses in behalf of the defense. The jury retired and\r\nwere only out an hour or less, when they returned a verdict of not\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the administration of Cyrus Carpenter as Governor\r\nof the state, the State Treasurer was also treasurer of the Board of\r\nTrustees of the Agricultural College. The two offices had no legal\r\nconnection, and it was merely an incident that the same man had been\r\nelected to both positions--the one by the people of the state, and the\r\nother by the Board of Trustees of the college. The Trustees of the\r\ncollege in making their annual report to the legislature reported that\r\ntheir treasurer had proved a defaulter to the sum of about $27,000, and\r\nthat they had, in order to secure the college, taken from him deeds for\r\nall his real estate including his homestead--all of the property save\r\nhis homestead having, as they understood, been purchased by their\r\ntreasurer with funds belonging to the college. About nine o'clock one\r\nevening I received a visit from the deputy treasurer of state who\r\ninformed me that the legislature, then in session, had passed a joint\r\nresolution, appointing a committee for the purpose of investigating the\r\nquestion as to what funds of the Agricultural College had been used,\r\nand also as to the proper administration of the funds belonging to the\r\nstate in the state treasury; that the Treasurer of State and of the\r\nAgricultural College, being the same person, was about to be examined\r\nthe next day by this committee of investigation, and upon advice of his\r\nfriends he wished to employ counsel, and wished that I would act as his\r\ncounsel in the matter, and particularly the deputy wished me that night\r\nto go with him and have a consultation with the treasurer. I\r\naccordingly accompanied him to the house of the party. I found him to\r\nbe an old man probably between sixty and seventy years of age, white\r\nhair and beard, blue eyes, a fine stalwart frame, but laboring under\r\nintense excitement. I listened carefully to his story, in which the\r\ndeputy frequently interpolated or supplemented the statements. The care\r\nwith which both parties persisted that the funds were not state funds,\r\nbut it was only the funds of the Agricultural College that had been\r\nwrongfully used or appropriated, made me fear that neither the\r\nprincipal nor his deputy were telling me all that they knew. I felt as\r\nShakespeare says in one of his plays, \"Methinks the person doth protest\r\ntoo much.\" We were standing in front of the fireplace and the light of\r\nthe fire threw a peculiarly bright light upon the countenance of the\r\ntreasurer, and the deputy remarked, \"Now you understand these funds\r\nwere in the hands of the treasurer of the Agricultural College, and\r\nthat he did not use the state funds. If he was defaulter as Treasurer\r\nof State he could be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary, but\r\nif he was only defaulter as treasurer of the Agricultural College that\r\nwould be a different affair. Is it not so?\" The State Treasurer was\r\neyeing me very earnestly and watching carefully for my answer to the\r\ndeputy's question. My answer was that I was not prepared to say that\r\nthat was true, and the State Treasurer turned still paler and more\r\nnervous because my answer was not satisfactory. My conference lasted\r\nuntil after midnight. I returned home feeling very anxious for the old\r\nman, but still satisfied in my own mind that I had not heard the entire\r\ntruth. The next day the committee of investigation, consisting of\r\nmembers of the house and senate, convened, and I was present when the\r\nState Treasurer was examined by them. The story was told very much as\r\nit was told to me the night before, some questions of a general nature\r\nwere asked, but nobody seemed to understand the importance of knowing\r\nwhen and what particular fund had come into the hands of the treasurer\r\nas custodian of the funds of the college, or when or what particular\r\namounts had been used or confiscated by him. The committee adjourned\r\nuntil next morning. That afternoon the house of representatives had\r\npassed a joint resolution requesting the Attorney General to give an\r\nopinion as to whether or not a defalcation by the treasurer of the\r\nAgricultural College funds constituted a crime, and also instructed him\r\nthat in case it constituted an offense he should at once commence a\r\nprosecution against the party in question. Fortunately, this action of\r\nthe house of representatives offered me a good excuse or pretext at\r\nleast, to have the treasurer refuse to answer any further questions by\r\nthe investigating committee, and we accordingly withdrew him from the\r\nwitness stand. Within the next day or two the deputy came to me and\r\nshowed me a lot of memoranda made on slips of paper in his handwriting,\r\ncontaining certain figures, the aggregate of which amounted to the sum\r\nfor which it was claimed the treasurer of the Agricultural College\r\nfunds was in default. The deputy advised me that these slips had been\r\nkept in the state treasury vault and had been counted as cash items\r\nfrom time to time. Within a few days after that I had an interview with\r\nDr. Welch, the president of the Agricultural College, and he stated to\r\nme that he was not satisfied that the funds that had been used by the\r\ntreasurer were Agricultural College funds at all, and that the loss was\r\nsaddled onto the college very much to the embarrassment of that\r\ninstitution, as they now had to wait for their money until such time as\r\nthe property which had been turned over to the trustees could be turned\r\ninto cash. He said he had a letter in his possession written by the\r\ndeputy stating that the treasurer was away from home at that date and\r\nthat he had not drawn the $30,000 theretofore appropriated by the\r\nlegislature for the benefit of the college, but that the treasurer\r\nwould return in a short time and that he would advise the president on\r\nhis return. At my request the president furnished me this letter and\r\nits date, and I found upon comparing it with the date of the warrant\r\ndrawn in favor of the treasurer of the Agricultural College for the\r\n$30,000 and the cancellation of that warrant; that is, when it was\r\nmarked paid, that there was a wonderful correspondence between the date\r\nof the letter and the date when the warrant was marked paid. The\r\ndeputy, at my request, had given me these slips of paper containing\r\nthis memoranda and I had carefully locked them away in my iron safe,\r\nthinking that possibly they might be of future use. At the next term of\r\nthe district court of Polk county the grand jury found two indictments\r\nagainst the State Treasurer, one as defaulter to the state of Iowa as\r\nTreasurer of State, and the other as defaulter to the State\r\nAgricultural College, but examining the minutes of the grand jury, I\r\nfound that there was no evidence whatever before the grand jury that\r\nthe State Treasurer had used any state funds at any time for any\r\npurpose, and the indictment of him as such a defaulter was not\r\njustified by any testimony taken by the grand jury. I immediately\r\nsuspected that there was a secret hand at work intending that this old\r\nman should be convicted, if not of one offense, then of the other. Upon\r\ninvestigation I found that there had been some informality and\r\nillegality in drawing and impaneling the grand jury that found these\r\nindictments. On proper motion in court I had both indictments quashed\r\nand the matter continued for the action of the grand jury at the\r\nsucceeding term of court. At the next term of court a new grand jury\r\nwas impaneled, the foreman of which was a personal friend of the\r\ntreasurer and a very honorable gentleman. He took occasion to suggest\r\nto me that it was very painful to him to have to find indictments\r\nagainst my client, the treasurer, but that he should certainly perform\r\nhis duty in that respect. I said to him that that was all right, but it\r\nwas not right for a grand jury to find an indictment against any man\r\nwithout some evidence before it, tending to show he was guilty of the\r\nparticular crime for which they found their indictment, and told him\r\nthat the former grand jury had indicted my client for defalcation as\r\nTreasurer of State without a particle of evidence, save and except that\r\nas treasurer of the Agricultural College board he had made default as\r\nto that fund. The result was that this grand jury brought in an\r\nindictment only against my client as defaulter as treasurer of the\r\nAgricultural College, and for unlawfully using and converting to his\r\nown use the funds of that institution. The case was continued from term\r\nto term for several years, and in the meantime the property that had\r\nbeen turned over to the trustees had been converted into money, and the\r\nloss of the State Agricultural College had been made entirely good.\r\nStill the indictment remained against my client and had to be tried and\r\ndisposed of. The old man had given up his house and his home and there\r\nwas much sympathy existing in the community for him, and a general\r\nimpression got abroad that he was the victim of others who had unloaded\r\nsome very unprofitable property upon him and induced him to invest in\r\nit with the expectation that it could be re-sold to advantage and the\r\nmoney refunded before it should be called for. Whether this was true or\r\nnot and who the parties were that had induced the old gentleman to\r\nbetray his trust, I do not know and have never tried to ascertain. The\r\ntime came finally that the man was to be put upon his trial. He came\r\ninto my office the day before the case was to be called for trial,\r\nlooking pale and haggard, told me he had bid his wife good-bye and his\r\nboys and that he was prepared for the worst, that he supposed there was\r\nno hope for him, that he could endure it but it was hard on the family\r\nat home. I invited him into my private room and seating him at the\r\nopposite side of my table I said to him that for the sake of his wife\r\nand children I had made up my mind that he should be acquitted. He\r\nlooked at me incredulously and asked what I meant, and how it was\r\npossible for him to escape conviction. He said he had already confessed\r\nhis fault and they had his confession all taken down in writing before\r\nthe investigating committee. I stepped to my safe and took out the\r\nmemoranda that I had obtained from his deputy and laid them down before\r\nhim. Looking him fully in the face, I said, \"Tell me what those papers\r\nmean?\" He asked me where I got them, and said he supposed they had been\r\ndestroyed long ago. I told him no, that I carefully preserved them\r\nbecause it might be, as I thought, for his interest at some time or\r\nother to tell the truth, that there had been enough lies told about the\r\nbusiness, and now probably the truth might save him. He asked what I\r\nmeant. I said to him, \"Here is a memoranda of the amounts that you took\r\nout of the safe that belonged to the state of Iowa. They never were in\r\nyour hands as treasurer of the Agricultural College and you know it and\r\nyou have known it all the time. You thought I was deceived, but I was\r\nnot. I have known the truth and I hoped the time might come when the\r\ntruth might benefit you more than the falsehood.\" I showed him the\r\nletter written by the deputy to President Welch. I had a memoranda of\r\nthe date of the cancellation of the $30,000 warrant issued to him as\r\ntreasurer of the Agricultural College. I looked him fully in the face\r\nand said, \"You never had that money in your hands, you never received\r\nit, you were not at home when that warrant was cancelled, and you know\r\nit.\" He sighed deeply and said, \"That is true, but I told a different\r\nstory and now what am I to do?\" I said to him, \"All you have to do is\r\nto tell the truth.\" The old man took courage and told me that I had\r\nguessed the truth and it was true that he had never used a dollar of\r\nAgricultural College funds. Upon the trial I introduced in evidence the\r\nmemoranda that had been kept in the safe of the State Treasurer, I\r\nintroduced the warrant that had been issued by the auditor to the\r\ntreasurer for Agricultural College funds, I proved by Dr. Welch the\r\nletter that had been written him by the deputy and the date of the\r\ntransaction, and I satisfied the jury beyond a doubt that my client was\r\nnot guilty of the only crime for which he then stood indicted, to-wit,\r\ndefaulter to the Agricultural College funds. Judge Leonard, then upon\r\nthe district bench, had been former prosecutor in the district and did\r\nnot listen with complaisance to any defense which tended to acquit an\r\naccused person, but after wrestling with him for quite awhile he\r\nfinally admitted my defense and the testimony sustaining it, and\r\ninstructed the jury flatly that the defendant was not on trial as\r\ndefaulter to the funds of the state of Iowa, but as defaulter as\r\ntreasurer of the Agricultural College funds, and they must find him\r\nguilty of the latter or they must acquit him, and the jury brought in a\r\nverdict of not guilty. This result created quite an excitement in the\r\ncommunity and throughout the state, and I acquired some reputation as a\r\ncriminal lawyer, but few persons understood the real nature of the\r\ndefense that was made or how it was that the defendant was acquitted in\r\nthe case, and attributed it to some extraordinary ability upon my part,\r\nwhereas in truth and in fact I only gained my case by insisting upon my\r\nclient telling and proving that which was true and abandoning a\r\nfalsehood that I suspected then and have ever since believed was\r\ninvented for him in order that other persons should not be suspected of\r\nany guilty knowledge of what had really occurred. My client returned to\r\nhis home, to his wife and children, at least free from a record of\r\nconviction for a felony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nVISITS VIRGINIA RELATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the close of the Civil War I went to Washington, D.C., for\r\nthe purpose of arguing a case then pending in the supreme court of the\r\nUnited States. The court made an order advancing some important cases\r\nin which I think the government was interested, and this necessarily\r\ndelayed the hearing of the cause in which I was engaged and left on my\r\nhands a week or more of leisure. I determined to improve the\r\nopportunity by going to Harper's Ferry and to Shepherdstown, West\r\nVirginia, for the purpose of finding and visiting some of my mother's\r\nrelatives. I had an uncle, Charles Cameron, who had lived at Harper's\r\nFerry when we left Maryland in 1841. I took the train to Harper's\r\nFerry, and upon my arrival there ascertained from the hotel clerk that\r\nmy uncle Charles had died a short time before the Civil War and that\r\nhis family had removed to Washington. I asked the clerk if he could\r\npoint out to me some old resident of the place from whom I could obtain\r\ninformation. Whilst talking with him a man entered the office to whom\r\nhe recommended me as a person that could tell me all about Harper's\r\nFerry before the war. From this gentleman I learned that my uncle, John\r\nCameron, was living with a married daughter several miles over on the\r\nMaryland side, just under Maryland Heights. I walked out to the place\r\nand had a most delightful visit with him and his daughter, and\r\nson-in-law and family. My uncle was a tall, splendidly framed man, a\r\nfine specimen of the old Virginia gentleman, over six feet in height,\r\nwith his faculties unimpared, a fine physique, and was then\r\nninety-three years of age. He went with me the next day over to\r\nShepherdstown, West Virginia, where we found still living and in fine\r\nhealth my uncle, Daniel Cameron, and wife, their daughter, their\r\ngranddaughter, and their great-granddaughter, all living under the same\r\nroof. When Sunday came I went with my cousin to church and she took me\r\nto the Methodist Church South. At dinner that day I asked my uncle John\r\nif he had been to church. He said, \"Certainly, sir.\" I asked him what\r\nchurch he attended. He answered, \"The Methodist church.\" I turned to my\r\ncousin Susan and asked her if we had been to the Methodist church. She\r\nsaid, \"Yes, _the_ Methodist Church South.\" I said to my uncle, \"Then\r\nyou were at the Methodist Church North?\" \"I attended, sir, the\r\nMethodist church of the United States of America.\" My cousin stepped\r\nupon my toes about this time under the table, from which I took the\r\nhint that the question of church north and _the_ Methodist church\r\nwas rather a delicate subject to discuss in the family. I was pleased\r\nto find that my relatives had all been true to the cause of the United\r\nStates and were earnest Union people, except the sons-in-law, who,\r\nbeing young men, were compelled to go into the rebel army.\r\n\r\nI visited some of the old places where my father had formerly resided\r\nand where he had taught school, and I also visited the grave of my\r\nmother and grandmother Cameron in the village churchyard adjacent to\r\nthe old brick building where I had attended Sunday school when a child.\r\nI had arranged with a gentleman who had married my cousin, Ann Cameron,\r\nto go with him the next day by way of Sharpsburg, over to Boonesboro,\r\nMaryland, but that evening I received a telegram from the clerk of the\r\nsupreme court advising me that my case would probably be called Monday\r\nor Tuesday, and I hastened back to Washington. After disposing of my\r\nbusiness in Washington I made a visit to my brothers at Rushville,\r\nOhio. Whilst here we received news of the nomination of General George\r\nB. McClelland as democratic candidate for the presidency in opposition\r\nto Mr. Lincoln, who had been nominated for his second term. An old\r\nacquaintance, Charles Wiseman, who was postmaster at Lancaster, came to\r\nsee me at Rushville and told me they had posted me for a political\r\nspeech that night, and he compelled me to go with him and fill the\r\nappointment. I found in Lancaster many old friends and acquaintances,\r\nboys who had been with me at school, and they gave me a hearty\r\ngreeting. The old court house was filled to overflowing that night and\r\nI dispensed to them for over two hours the gospel of true Republicanism\r\nand loyalty to the country. We had a very enthusiastic meeting, and my\r\nold friend, John D. Martin, especially gave me a very hearty\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nBefore my return home I also visited Millersburg, Kentucky, to see my\r\nsister Susan and her family. Her husband, William Vimont, had suffered\r\nsome during the war. His negro cook and her grown boy had been\r\nemancipated by their own will, the fugitive slave law being then\r\npractically inoperative. Morgan, in his raid through the country, had\r\nalso stolen Vimont's fine horse, which served somewhat as an antidote\r\nfor the wrong that he felt had been visited upon him by the Union\r\npeople. In passing over from his house to the village of Millersburg\r\ntwo incidents occurred which served to illustrate the state of affairs\r\nat that time in Kentucky. Upon reaching the turnpike near Mr. Vimont's\r\nhouse we met one of his uncles riding in a buggy, just coming out of\r\nthe gate which led to his residence, and he informed us with much\r\nfeeling and passion that when he woke up that morning he discovered\r\nthat there was not a nigger on his place, that he had no nigger at home\r\nto cook his breakfast for him, and that he had to \"hitch up his own\r\nhorse, sah.\" This last item appeared to be the culmination of his\r\ngrief. A few hundred yards further we passed a blacksmith shop, and\r\nupon the large door that constituted the entrance to the shop we found\r\nin red chalk the image of a man drawn, and the door within the lines of\r\nthis image was full of bullet holes. Mr. Vimont informed me that the\r\nblacksmith, who was a violent secessionist, had been accustomed to\r\namuse himself by drawing upon the door of the shop the outline of a\r\nperson, calling it Lincoln, and then standing a short distance away,\r\nrevolver in hand, gratifying his rebel heart by filling the image full\r\nof bullet holes.\r\n\r\nIt was during this visit to my brother-in-law that I urged upon him the\r\npropriety of selling his little farm and purchasing land in some\r\nwestern state and removing his family thither, which he finally did a\r\nfew years later, when he removed to Tuscola, Illinois.\r\n\r\nI attended religious services in the village on the Sabbath, and was\r\nmuch interested in hearing a sermon from the text, \"Be not deceived,\r\nGod is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also\r\nreap.\" The sermon that the minister preached was by no means the same\r\nas my thoughts framed from this text when I thought of the desolation\r\nthat I had witnessed through this state, and the effects of the dark\r\nshadow that was just then lifting from one of the fairest lands that a\r\nbenevolent Creator had ever prepared for a people, but which the\r\nstupidity and cupidity of man had cursed with human slavery. The\r\npreacher appeared to be perfectly blind as to the crop that his\r\naudience had reaped from the fearful sowing of their fathers, or dared\r\nnot mention even had he thought of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPLEASURE TRIP TO COLORADO\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1872 I joined a party of friends for the purpose of\r\nvisiting Colorado. The party consisted of Judge Byron Rice, Doctor\r\nWard, Alexander Talbott, Mr. Weaver, a druggist, and Monroe, a clothing\r\nmerchant, and myself. We went by rail to Denver. We took with us a tent\r\ncloth, some blankets, buffalo robes, and bedding. At Denver we\r\npurchased a three-seated spring wagon and a pair of good mules. We also\r\nhired a teamster with another pair of mules and wagon, and bought a\r\ncamping outfit, cooking utensils, and provisions. From Denver we went\r\nsouth to Colorado Springs. Our first camp south of Denver was at a\r\nplace called Haystack Ranch, so called because there had never been a\r\nhaystack on the ranch, but three immense boulders bore a striking\r\nresemblance to three haystacks, in the vicinity of which a settler had\r\nerected his buildings. A small mountain stream supplied him with the\r\nfacilities of irrigating his land. He had built a fine large milk\r\nhouse, paved with flagstones and so arranged that he could turn the\r\nmountain stream of ice cold water on the floor of the building and thus\r\nregulate its temperature. He also had built an overshot water wheel\r\nwith a small trough or flume and through this trough he turned the\r\nwater onto his wheel from time to time as he wished it, and utilized\r\nits power to churn his butter. He milked about thirty cows, which he\r\ntold us were fed entirely upon the buffalo grass in the valley near by\r\namong the foothills, and that he sent his butter twice a week to the\r\ncity of Denver. The man was evidently living an easy, pleasant life,\r\nand getting rich without any severe toil or drudgery. The town of\r\nColorado Springs was then a single street with a few straggling houses.\r\nWithin a few miles of it we found the newly laid out city of Manitou.\r\nThe surveyors were still at work surveying the streets. One large hotel\r\nwas in course of erection and the valley up Cheyenne canyon contained\r\nabout two hundred tents filled with invalids and health seekers. In\r\nthis canyon could be found mineral waters of any temperature and almost\r\nany ingredients; principally iron, sulphur, lime, and soda. On a\r\nbeautiful plateau of ground near where the hotel was being erected we\r\npitched our tent and made our camp for several days. We finally\r\nconcluded to make the ascent of Pike's Peak. Besides the two mules that\r\nwe had bought, we hired some ponies accustomed to the trail, except\r\nthat Mr. Monroe, one of our party, declared that he was able to walk,\r\nand refused to be provided with other transportation. We proposed to go\r\nup the mountain to the timber line the first day, and stay all night,\r\nand the next morning attempt to reach the summit by sunrise, for the\r\npurpose of enjoying what we were assured would be a most magnificent\r\nview of the country. Judge Rice and myself were a little late in\r\nprocuring our ponies, and the other four of the party started in\r\nadvance of us, Monroe on foot. \"Halfway,\" as it was called, up the\r\nmountain, we stopped for rest and refreshment at a little log shanty\r\nerected by two enterprising young men, who there supplied luncheon and\r\nsleeping accommodations to the traveling public. The trail at that time\r\nwas barely visible to the naked eye, and the climbing was difficult and\r\nsomewhat dangerous even with our trained animals. Several hundred yards\r\nbefore we reached the timber line, so-called, we found Monroe lying in\r\nthe path and apparently almost lifeless. The rare mountain air had\r\nscarcely left him oxygen enough to preserve life, and he had succumbed\r\nto the inevitable. We found near the timber line a shelving rock or\r\nrather a large cavity in the rock, where we took up our quarters for\r\nthe night. Carrying Monroe to this place and wrapping him in blankets,\r\nwe infused life into him by administering several doses of brandy, of\r\nwhich Judge Rice fortunately had a small flask. A large pine tree had\r\nfallen across the outer edge of this rock against which we could place\r\nour feet to prevent slipping over its edge, and here we all tried to\r\nsleep. A fearful thunder storm came up in the night, but fortunately\r\nthe storm was below us. It was indeed a grand sight to see the forked\r\nlightnings darting through the clouds below us, without any\r\napprehension of their finding our retreat. Our sleep, however, was very\r\nindifferent. We had been in the territory only about ten days and our\r\nbreathing apparatus had not adjusted itself to the necessities of a\r\nlife in these altitudes. We fairly gasped for breath. In the morning\r\nwhen we awoke we found that we could take our ponies no farther on the\r\ntrail, for there was none visible to the eye. The remainder of the\r\njourney to the top of the peak was necessarily a climbing over huge\r\nrocks scattered here and there without reference to the convenience of\r\nadventurers. We could walk or rather climb about one hundred feet\r\nbetween rests and then fall down under the shadow of a great rock to\r\nrecuperate enough strength for a venture of perhaps a hundred feet\r\nmore. After climbing about four or five hundred feet or more in this\r\nmanner we each began to feel a roaring in the ears and a nausea of the\r\nstomach, and at last had the discretion to call council in which we\r\nunanimously concluded with old Falstaff, one of Shakespeare's heroes,\r\nthat the better part of valor was discretion, and we concluded to\r\nreturn to the valley below and forego the magnificence of a sunrise\r\nview from the top of Pike's Peak. When we got back upon our way as far\r\nas the timber line where we had hitched our ponies, I found my pony had\r\ntaken \"French leave\" and gone down on the trail without waiting for my\r\nvaluable company. I was doubtful at first whether I should be able to\r\nwalk to camp, which was then over eight miles from the place of our\r\nnight's adventure, but I had not proceeded down the mountain a mile\r\nbefore my strength returned to me and my lungs filled with sufficient\r\noxygen to restore my vigor. We all got back to camp safely, even\r\nincluding the dilapidated Monroe, and the consensus of opinion was that\r\nwe were glad we went up Pike's Peak, but were more satisfied with the\r\nreflection that we did not have to go again. After another day's rest\r\nwe took to the road with our mule teams and wagons, passing over a\r\nbeautiful mountain road up Cheyenne canyon. Every few hundred yards we\r\npassed some beautiful cascade or water fall, formed by the dashing\r\nwaters of some mountain stream supplied from the eternal snows that\r\ncrowned the mountain peaks around us. Our road lay through the\r\nso-called South Park. On the high table lands before we reached this\r\npark we passed through a forest of petrified wood. At one cabin,\r\noccupied by a gentleman who kept a small hotel, we found the foundation\r\nof his house made of this petrified timber, and his chimney and\r\nfireplace of the same material. We gathered a few specimens that we\r\nafterwards brought home with us. In South Park we passed what was\r\ncalled the salt works. Here some English capitalist had built an\r\nimmense plant for manufacturing salt. A natural spring that threw a\r\nconstant stream of salt water, probably ten or twelve inches in\r\ndiameter, supplied the water from which the salt was to be made. Large\r\nand commodious buildings with evaporating apparatus had been erected.\r\nAn expenditure of probably fifty or one hundred thousand dollars had\r\nbeen made. There was only one difficulty about this Utopian enterprise\r\nand that was that the salt had to be manufactured so far from\r\ncivilization that it cost more to transport it than it would be worth\r\nwhen it reached the market, hence the enterprise had been an\r\nignominious failure and had been abandoned.\r\n\r\nLeaving this point we passed through the South Pass of the Rockies and\r\non to the headwaters of the Arkansas river. We went up this river to\r\nthe town of Granite, that had been a thriving mining village when\r\nplacer mining in these parts was profitable; thence we went to Twin\r\nLakes, two small beautiful lakes of water among the mountains, where we\r\ncamped and supplied ourselves with mountain trout. On the way we\r\nfrequently shot mountain grouse. With our breakfast bacon and most\r\nexcellent flour and potatoes, and our own improvised cooking and our\r\nexcellent appetites, we all fared sumptuously every day. We returned\r\nvia another route, passing through Fairplay. Returning to Denver we\r\nsold our team and wagon for just its original cost, and paid our\r\nteamster with his outfit four dollars a day. We had kept an accurate\r\naccount of our expenditures and found that $1.50 a day for each of us\r\nhad paid all of our expenses, including our transportation, for our\r\nthree weeks' trip. We made a trip then by rail and stage line, going\r\nfirst over to Idaho Springs, visiting that beautiful little valley, and\r\nsome of our party going as far as Georgetown. Returning to Denver, we\r\nall came home by rail well satisfied with our trip, but when we struck\r\nthe blue grass regions of Iowa and its fields of ripening corn, with\r\nthe memories of the homes that we were nearing our hearts were made\r\nglad that we lived in a land of civilization and plenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCENTENNIAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1876 the patriotic citizens of the state of Pennsylvania,\r\nand especially of the old city of Philadelphia, had conceived the idea\r\nof a world's fair to commemorate the great event of the world; to-wit,\r\nthe declaration of the independence of the American colonies from the\r\nmother country. In planning this great exhibition the managers had\r\ninvited the governors of the several states of the Union to appoint,\r\neach, one of their citizens to deliver an address in behalf of their\r\nstate, giving something of its history and settlement, its resources\r\nand possibilities. In pursuance of this plan Governor Samuel J.\r\nKirkwood of Iowa did me the honor to appoint me to make the address in\r\nbehalf of Iowa. I prepared such an address with considerable care, and\r\ndelivered the same upon the exposition grounds on the 7th day of\r\nSeptember, 1876. My cousin, Henry Clay Cameron, who was then professor\r\nof Greek at Princeton University, did me the honor to visit me at\r\nPhiladelphia at this time and took luncheon with my wife and myself\r\nupon the exposition grounds; also Samuel F. Miller, justice of the\r\nsupreme court of the United States came from Washington and was present\r\non that occasion, and many other distinguished men. Among other\r\ngentlemen present were official representatives of a number of the\r\ngovernments and nations of Europe. The legislature of Iowa printed at\r\nthe state expense some twenty thousand copies of this address, that\r\nwere thereafter distributed among the people of the state. I have sent\r\nat their request to a number of the libraries in the different states\r\nprinted copies of this address, and now the supply has been about\r\nexhausted and the document is about out of print, and I think I should\r\ngive here a short synopsis of it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Charles Clinton Nourse_\r\n  From Photograph by W. Kurtz,\r\n  Madison Square, New York, 1876]\r\n\r\nThe following is the introductory matter, stating something of the\r\ndiscovery of the territory that now constitutes our state:\r\n\r\n    Mr. President, and Ladies and Gentlemen: On the 13th of May, A.D.\r\n    1673, James Marquette and Louis Joliet, under the direction of the\r\n    French authorities of Canada, started from the Straits of Mackinaw,\r\n    in their frail bark canoes, with five boatmen, \"to find out and\r\n    explore the great river lying on the west of them, of which they\r\n    had heard marvelous accounts from the Indians about Lake Michigan.\"\r\n\r\n    From the southern extremity of Green bay they ascended the Fox\r\n    river, and thence carried their boats and provisions across to the\r\n    Wisconsin. Descending that stream, they reached the Mississippi on\r\n    the 17th of June, and entered its majestic current, \"realizing a\r\n    joy,\" wrote Marquette, \"that they could not express.\" Rapidly and\r\n    easily they swept down to the solitudes below, and viewed on their\r\n    journey the bold bluffs and beautiful meadows on the western bank\r\n    of the stream, now revealed for the first time to the eyes of the\r\n    white man. This was the discovery of Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe address then proceeds to give a short account of the first\r\nsettlements in Iowa at Keokuk, Burlington, Davenport, and Dubuque, and\r\nalso the settlements afterwards made at Council Bluffs and Sioux City,\r\nand cites the various treaties made from time to time between the\r\ngovernment of the United States and the Indians, extinguishing the\r\nIndian title. It also gives something of the topography of the country,\r\nand in regard to its resources and the natural fertility of the soil it\r\ncontains the following:\r\n\r\n    We have now on exhibition in the Centennial buildings 15,000 pounds\r\n    of Iowa soil, selected from forty-five different counties of our\r\n    state. This exhibition shows a vertical section of the natural\r\n    formation of the earth to the depth of six feet from the surface.\r\n    The selection has been made from _five_ several _groups_ of _seven_\r\n    counties each. The counties have been classified according to their\r\n    contiguity, or natural location, as the northwest, northeast,\r\n    southwest, southeast, and central. These specimens of strata are\r\n    exhibited just in the condition they existed in the earth. The\r\n    strata, undisturbed, have been transferred to glass tubes six\r\n    inches in diameter and six feet in length. These tubes are encased\r\n    in black walnut, and each labeled with the name of the county from\r\n    which the strata have been taken. The object has been in good faith\r\n    to show the world what Iowa really is, without exaggeration, and\r\n    without room for cavil. Here is the formation from nature's own\r\n    laboratory. Behold, what hath God wrought!\r\n\r\nThe address also particularly gives an account of our school system,\r\nour state university and agricultural college, our benevolent\r\ninstitutions for the unfortunate classes, also the extent of our\r\nnewspaper publications. It discusses to some extent the questions\r\narising out of the Civil War and the heroism of our troops. On this\r\nsubject the address contains the following:\r\n\r\n    It is impossible, in the reasonable length to which this paper\r\n    should be limited, to write even a summary of the battles in which\r\n    Iowa soldiers took part. The history of her troops would be\r\n    substantially a history of the war in the south and west. To\r\n    recount a portion of those battles and sieges would be to give a\r\n    partial history to the neglect of others, equally deserving of\r\n    honorable mention. A task alike impossible would be to give here\r\n    the names of the heroes, living and dead, who distinguished\r\n    themselves by their courage and valor. Our efficient Adjutant\r\n    General has preserved in the archives of his department, the\r\n    material from which this glorious history will one day be written,\r\n    for the honor of the state and the inspiration of the generations\r\n    that shall come after us. In the adjutant's department at Des\r\n    Moines are preserved the shot-riddled colors and standards of our\r\n    regiments. Upon them, by special authority, were inscribed, from\r\n    time to time during the war, the names of the battle fields upon\r\n    which these regiments gained distinction. These names constitute\r\n    the geographical nomenclature of two-thirds of the territory lately\r\n    in rebellion. From the Des Moines river to the Gulf, from the\r\n    Mississippi to the Atlantic, in the mountains of West Virginia, and\r\n    in the Valley of the Shenandoah, the Iowa soldier made his presence\r\n    known and felt, and maintained the honor of the state and the cause\r\n    of the nation. They were with Lyon at Wilson's Creek, with Tuttle\r\n    at Donelson. They fought with Siegel and with Curtis at Pea Ridge;\r\n    with Crocker at Champion Hills; with Reid at Shiloh. They were with\r\n    Grant at the surrender of Vicksburg. They fought above the clouds\r\n    with Hooker at Lookout Mountain. They were with Sherman in his\r\n    march to the sea, and were ready for battle when Johnston\r\n    surrendered. They were with Sheridan in the Valley of the\r\n    Shenandoah, and were in the veteran ranks of the nation's\r\n    deliverers that stacked their arms in the national capital at the\r\n    close of the war.\r\n\r\nThe address concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    Iowa hails with joy this centennial of our nation's birth. She\r\n    renews her vows of devotion to our common country, and looks with\r\n    hope to the future. The institution of slavery, that once rested as\r\n    a shadow upon the land, that was fast producing a diverse\r\n    civilization dangerous to our unity and nationality, has been\r\n    forever abolished.\r\n\r\n    This centennial exhibition of our national greatness and material\r\n    progress must re-awaken in the mind and heart of every American\r\n    emotions of profound love for his country, and of patriotic pride\r\n    in her success. Surely no American would consent that such a\r\n    civilization as is evidenced here should perish in the throes of\r\n    civil war. If there be anything in the history of Iowa and its\r\n    wonderful development to excite a just pride, the other, and\r\n    especially the older states of the Union may justly claim to share\r\n    in it. Such as we are, the emigration from the other states made\r\n    us. Our free soil, free labor, free schools, free speech, free\r\n    press, free worship, free men and free women, were their free gift\r\n    and contribution. Iowa is the thirty-year old child of the republic\r\n    that celebrates the first centennial of its birth. Our state is\r\n    simply the legitimate offspring of a civilization that has found\r\n    its highest expression in building up sovereign states. Iowa was\r\n    not a colony planted by the oppressions of the parent government,\r\n    and that threw off her allegiance as soon as she gained strength to\r\n    assert her independence; but she was the outgrowth of the natural\r\n    vitality and enterprise of the nation, begotten in obedience to the\r\n    divine command to multiply and replenish--born a sovereign by the\r\n    will and desire of the parent, and baptized at the font of liberty\r\n    as a voluntary consecration of her political life. Not a sovereign\r\n    in that absolute sense that would make the federal government an\r\n    impossibility, but sovereign within her sphere and over the objects\r\n    and purposes of her jurisdiction, with such further limitations\r\n    only upon her powers as render an abuse of them impossible, to the\r\n    end that the personal liberty and private rights of the citizen\r\n    should be more secure.\r\n\r\n    This wonderful exhibition of mechanical skill, of cunning\r\n    workmanship, and of the fruits of the earth, is but the evidence\r\n    of the existence and character of the people that have produced\r\n    them. The great ultimate fact that America would demonstrate is\r\n    the existence of a people capable of attaining and preserving\r\n    a superior civilization, with a government self-imposed,\r\n    self-administered, and self-perpetuated. In this, her centennial\r\n    year, America can exhibit nothing to the world of mankind more\r\n    wonderful or more glorious than her new states--young empires,\r\n    born of her own enterprise, and tutored at her own political\r\n    hearthstone. Well may she say to the monarchies of the old world,\r\n    who look for evidences of her regal grandeur and state, \"Behold,\r\n    these are my jewels.\" And may she never blush to add: \"This one in\r\n    the _center_ of the diadem is called IOWA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTEMPERANCE AND PROHIBITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn giving a further account of the activities of subsequent years it\r\nwill be almost impossible to preserve anything like a chronological\r\norder of events, and it will be necessary to take up certain subjects\r\nor topics that employed much of my time and energies, and probably as\r\nimportant as any other part of my life was my connection with the\r\nsubject of temperance and prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe code of Iowa enacted in 1850 took effect July 1, 1851. Under the\r\nhead of \"Intoxicating Liquors\" it enacted as follows: \"The people of\r\nIowa will hereafter take no part in the profits of the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors.\" It then provided that the establishment of any\r\nplace for the sale of intoxicating liquors to be drank on or about the\r\npremises should constitute a public nuisance, and enacted penalties\r\nagainst the sale of intoxicating liquors to be drank on or about the\r\npremises, and provided for the abatement of such nuisances and the\r\npunishment of all persons violating the provisions of this statute.\r\nThis code was very excellent in the principle upon which the law was\r\nbased; to-wit, that the people and government ought not to be a party\r\nto or share the profits of the sale of that which was the cause of so\r\nmuch poverty and crime, and the statute aimed at the destruction of the\r\nplaces of resort where the habit of drinking such liquors was\r\ncontracted and promoted; but in its practical operation the law itself\r\nand its provisions were a failure. The words, \"To be drank on or about\r\nthe premises,\" involved two uncertainties--first, as to the meaning of\r\nthe words \"on or about,\" and secondly, as to the guilty knowledge or\r\nintent of the vendor of the liquors when he made his sale, as to the\r\nmanner and where the purchaser intended to drink. Courts and juries\r\ngave very different and very liberal interpretation in the application\r\nof this law to different cases, and many of our judges and justices\r\nwere not well educated in the idea that the sale of intoxicating\r\nliquors as a beverage was really a crime against the community and\r\nagainst humanity. As a result of these uncertainties of the law, the\r\npeople of the state in 1854 elected a legislature, the majority of the\r\nmembers of which were pledged to enact a statute of absolute\r\nprohibition. Such a statute passed both branches of the general\r\nassembly, and was approved by Governor Grimes. The settlements in the\r\nlarger towns along the Mississippi river and in several of the interior\r\ncounties embraced very many Germans and other persons of foreign birth,\r\naccustomed to the use, not only of intoxicating liquors, but to places\r\nof resort where the same could be drank at their leisure and pleasure.\r\nThe result of this foreign demand was a fatal amendment to the statute\r\nof 1854-5 known as the \"Wine and Beer Clause,\" which permitted the\r\nlicensing and sale of beer and native wine made from the grapes or\r\nother fruits grown within the state. The practical result of this law\r\nwas the establishment of the saloon in charge of keepers who paid no\r\nrespect to the law and sold all kinds of intoxicating drinks under\r\npretense of beer and native wine.\r\n\r\nDuring our Civil War the people of the state were so absorbed in the\r\nprogress of events that involved the existence of our nationality that\r\nthey gave but little attention to local state and police legislation,\r\nbut soon after the close of the war, the thought of the people was\r\ndirected to the great curse of the licensed saloon and its effects upon\r\nthe morals and habits of our people. In order that the policy of the\r\nstate with reference to this matter might not be subjected to the\r\ncaprice of political party conventions and elections, the people\r\ndemanded and sought to enact an amendment to the constitution of the\r\nstate that should embrace to its fullest extent a provision prohibiting\r\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage within the state,\r\nincluding not only alcoholic liquors, but also malt liquors. In order\r\nto secure such a provision by way of amendment to the constitution it\r\nwas necessary to secure the election of two successive general\r\nassemblies to pass upon such an amendment, and to secure a vote of the\r\npeople endorsing and adopting the same at a subsequent election. The\r\nprovisions of our constitution on the subject of amending the same were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    Any amendment or amendments to this constitution may be proposed in\r\n    either house of the general assembly; and if the same shall be\r\n    agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each of the two\r\n    houses, such proposed amendment shall be entered on their journals,\r\n    with the yeas and nays taken thereon, and referred to the\r\n    legislature to be chosen at the next general election, and shall be\r\n    published, as provided by law, for three months previous to the\r\n    time of making such choice; and if, in the general assembly so next\r\n    chosen as aforesaid, such proposed amendment or amendments shall be\r\n    agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to each house,\r\n    then it shall be the duty of the general assembly to submit such\r\n    proposed amendment to the people in such manner, and at such time\r\n    as the general assembly shall provide; and if the people shall\r\n    approve and ratify such amendment or amendments by a majority of\r\n    the electors qualified to vote for members of the general assembly,\r\n    voting thereon, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of\r\n    the constitution of this state.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the provisions of this constitution the eighteenth\r\ngeneral assembly of the state of Iowa, to-wit, in the year 1880,\r\nadopted as an amendment to the constitution of the state the following:\r\n\"No person shall manufacture for sale, or sell, or keep for sale as a\r\nbeverage, any intoxicating liquors whatever, including ale, wine and\r\nbeer. The general assembly shall by law prescribe regulations for the\r\nenforcement of the prohibition herein contained, and shall thereby\r\nprovide suitable penalties for the violation of the provisions hereof.\"\r\nThis amendment, by omission of the clerk of the house of\r\nrepresentatives, was not entered in full upon the journals of that\r\nbody. It was, however, embraced in a joint resolution of the two houses\r\nand fully identified by its title upon the journal of the house and\r\nsenate, and the vote adopting the same was duly recorded by yeas and\r\nnays as required by the constitution. The publication of this action of\r\nthe eighteenth general assembly was duly made in the newspapers prior\r\nto the election of the nineteenth general assembly, and at the session\r\nof that body another joint resolution was passed in both houses\r\nembracing the amendment and reciting the action of the eighteenth\r\ngeneral assembly thereon, and this joint resolution passed both houses,\r\nand the yeas and nays were fully recorded, and proclamation was made by\r\nthe Governor of the state, and the people of the state at a subsequent\r\nelection held on June 27, 1882, after a vigorous canvass of the merits\r\nof the question, endorsed and adopted the amendment by nearly thirty\r\nthousand majority.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of August, 1882, a pretended suit was brought in the\r\ndistrict court of Scott county by a brewing establishment owned and\r\noperated by Koehler & Lange against a saloon keeper by the name of\r\nHill, in the city of Davenport, upon an account for beer sold by the\r\nbrewer to the saloon keeper, and the saloon keeper set up by way of\r\ndefense that he bought the beer and it was sold to him for the purpose\r\nof being sold as a beverage and that the sale was unlawful and contrary\r\nto the provisions of the amendment to the constitution. That this suit\r\nwas a mere conspiracy for the purpose of having the amendment to the\r\nconstitution declared void there can be no question. The judge of the\r\ndistrict court of Scott county was opposed to the amendment personally\r\nand politically, as were also the attorneys that conducted these\r\nproceedings. The principal answer of the saloon keeper was to set up\r\nthe constitutional amendment and the brewer replied stating that the\r\nconstitutional amendment was not legally adopted, especially because\r\nthe amendment had not been spread upon the journals of the house of\r\nrepresentatives of the eighteenth general assembly verbatim, but that\r\nit had only been embraced in a certain joint resolution of the two\r\nhouses. The judgment of the district court was against the brewer for\r\nthe beer, and he took a pretended appeal therefrom to the supreme court\r\nof the state. When the case reached the supreme court J. A. Harvey,\r\nEsq., who had been an active man in the general assembly in favor of\r\nthe amendment, and who was also an avowed prohibitionist and friend of\r\nthe amendment, was employed by the Women's Temperance Union of the\r\nstate to appear in the case and argue the matter before the supreme\r\ncourt, involving the legality of the amendment. The Women's Temperance\r\nUnion also employed Judge William E. Miller, an ex-judge of the supreme\r\ncourt of our state, who prepared and filed in the case a printed\r\nargument. I was at that time absorbed in my own private practice and\r\nhad a case on trial in the district court, and was unable to attend the\r\nsession of the court at which the case was argued. I had been very\r\nactive in the canvass pending the adoption of this amendment at the\r\npopular election, and had spent much time in making speeches before the\r\npeople in its behalf. I had promised Mr. Harvey that if my other\r\nprofessional engagements would admit of it I would assist him in the\r\noral argument before the supreme court. To my great surprise, and to\r\nthe surprise and consternation of the people of the state, the majority\r\nof the judges of the supreme court decided that the amendment had not\r\nbeen legally adopted, giving as their chief reason therefor the failure\r\nof the eighteenth general assembly to have spread upon the house\r\njournal a verbatim copy of the constitutional amendment at the time it\r\nwas adopted by that house. As soon as this decision was made known I\r\nprepared and filed in the supreme court of the state a petition for a\r\nre-hearing of the case. This re-hearing was granted. The Governor of\r\nthe state employed Senator James F. Wilson of Fairfield, and Hon. John\r\nF. Duncombe, of Fort Dodge, to appear and make oral argument in behalf\r\nof the amendment. I also appeared in the case at my own request and\r\nupon my own motion and argued the case orally at Davenport on the final\r\nhearing. Two of the judges of the supreme court; Judges Seevers and\r\nRothrock, were not friends of the amendment, and I think, in sentiment,\r\nwere opposed to it. Judge Day's action in the matter in agreeing with\r\nMessrs. Seevers and Rothrock was a surprise to his friends, but I have\r\nno doubt his decision was honestly made. I think this re-hearing might\r\npossibly have resulted in a favorable opinion from a majority of the\r\ncourt had it not been for the intemperate zeal of a portion of the\r\npublic press, particularly the Des Moines _Register_ edited by the\r\nClarksons in which the majority opinion of the supreme court was\r\ndenounced. The judges who constituted the majority of the court could\r\nscarcely be expected to change their views and opinions under the\r\npressure of the brutal attacks that were made upon them through the\r\npress. Judge Beck, the fourth judge of the court, had delivered a very\r\nable dissenting opinion sustaining the constitutional amendment. That\r\nthe decision of the supreme court upon this question was radically\r\nwrong, I have never entertained the least doubt in my own mind. The\r\nsupreme court in its majority opinion recognized the fact that the only\r\nproper and legal evidence of the final action of the legislative body\r\nin the enactment of its laws must be found in its enrolled bills, duly\r\ncertified by the presiding officers of the senate and house of\r\nrepresentatives respectively. The authorities were uniform, and no\r\ncourt had ever before undertaken to examine the journals of a\r\nlegislative assembly for the purpose of contradicting and falsifying\r\nthe duly certified action of the legislature by its presiding officer.\r\nEvery bill that passes the general assembly of the state is duly\r\nenrolled by the clerk elected for that purpose by the house in which\r\nthe bill originated. It is then supposed to be carefully examined by\r\nthe committee on enrolled bills and reported in open session of the\r\nhouse, and is then presented by the clerk or secretary to the several\r\npresiding officers in open session for their signatures, and thence in\r\nthe care of the proper committee on enrolled bills is presented to the\r\nGovernor for his approval. To go behind this official action of the two\r\nbranches of the legislature and undertake to examine and criticise the\r\naction of the clerk in recording or failing to record any part of its\r\nproceedings, by the courts of the state, is simply to destroy the\r\nindependence of the law-making power, and is nothing more or less than\r\nusurpation on the part of a coördinate branch of the government. The\r\nconstitution of Iowa in its provisions in regard to an amendment of\r\nthat instrument selects, first, the two houses of the general assembly,\r\nsecondly, the executive of the state, and thirdly, the people of the\r\nstate, the source of all political power, and entrusts to them and them\r\nalone the power to amend its organic law. This amendment originated\r\nwith and was carefully prepared by and approved by both branches of the\r\neighteenth general assembly, and subsequently by the nineteenth general\r\nassembly, there can be no question; that it was then submitted to a\r\nvote of the people, voted and approved by the people by a large\r\nmajority, was then proclaimed by the Governor of the state in his\r\nproclamation as part of the organic law of the state, there was no\r\nquestion, and I do not hesitate to say, after years of thought and\r\ndeliberation upon this matter, that the decision of the supreme court\r\nof the state in the case of Koehler & Lange against Hill was simply\r\nusurpation. During the pendency of this re-hearing and before the final\r\narguments in the case Mr. Hill, the saloon-keeper of Davenport,\r\nattempted to defeat the re-hearing by asking the court to strike from\r\nthe files the petition for rehearing and denying the authority of the\r\nattorneys who had filed the same to act in his name. The Governor of\r\nthe state, after the final disposition of the cause, appropriated $750\r\nto the three principal counsel engaged in the re-hearing, and sent me\r\none-third of the amount; to-wit, $250 for my services in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional amendment thus attempted to be rendered null and\r\nvoid by the opinion of the supreme court in the case of Koehler & Lange\r\nagainst Hill was really only an amendment to the constitution enjoining\r\nupon the legislature the duty of enacting a prohibitory liquor law, and\r\nforbidding the enactment of any statute authorizing the license and\r\nsale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage. The immediate effect of the\r\ndecision of the supreme court was to arouse the people of the state to\r\nan assertion of their rights in regard to these matters; consequently\r\nthey elected a general assembly in the fall of 1883, a large majority\r\nof whose members were pledged to give the people, by legislative\r\nenactment, a law such as the constitutional amendment required, and in\r\npursuance of that purpose the twentieth general assembly enacted the\r\nprohibitory law, chapter 143, page 146 of the laws of that session.\r\nThis law was popularly known as the Clark law, taking its name from the\r\nfact that it was introduced into the senate by Senator Clark of Page\r\ncounty. He was not, however, the author of the law, and was only\r\nentitled to the credit of having introduced it as a member of the\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nSome time before these events there had been organized in the state of\r\nIowa a temperance league, with its headquarters at Des Moines. Mr. J.\r\nA. Harvey, before referred to, and myself, with Louis Todhunter of\r\nIndianola, had been appointed by the Temperance League a committee to\r\ndraft a prohibitory law and secure its passage by the twentieth general\r\nassembly. Another effect of the decision of the supreme court in the\r\nKoehler & Lange case was the retirement of Judge Day from the supreme\r\nbench of the state, and the election of Judge Read of Council Bluffs in\r\nhis stead. I was a delegate to the republican state convention from\r\nPolk county. I did not sympathize with the idea of the defeat for\r\nrenomination of a judge of the court on the simple ground that his\r\ndecision or action as judge did not meet with the approval of the\r\npeople, but I could not, with my ideas of right and justice, approve\r\nof the renomination of any judge of the court that had assumed the\r\nprerogative attempted to be exercised by the majority of judges in the\r\nKoehler & Lange case, and I cordially supported Judge Read for the\r\nnomination. I had assisted Mr. Harvey in framing the prohibitory law\r\nthat was enacted by the twentieth general assembly, part of which was\r\nwritten by myself. I did not entirely agree with the committee,\r\nhowever, in providing as that statute does that the prosecuting witness\r\nor party filing informations for a violation of the law should take to\r\nhis personal use any part of the fines or penalties provided for in the\r\nstatute. I disliked that feature of the law for the reason that I\r\nanticipated that bad men, for the sake of personal profit and gain,\r\nwould bring the law into disrepute. The State Temperance League\r\nundertook to provide, to a greater or less extent, for the prosecution\r\nof offenders under this law of the twentieth general assembly. I was on\r\nthe committee appointed by the League and was chairman of the committee\r\nthat had advisory powers in regard to prosecutions undertaken or\r\npromoted by the officers of the League, and as chairman of that\r\ncommittee I had occasion, a number of times, to defeat the purposes and\r\nplans of those who sought to use the authority of the League for some\r\nulterior purpose. The most serious case of this kind that arose during\r\nmy administration related to the effort of a certain whiskey trust to\r\nuse the prohibitory law as a means of destroying an industry\r\nestablished in Des Moines by invitation of its business men just prior\r\nto the taking effect of this prohibitory law of 1884. One of the chief\r\nmen in encouraging the establishment of the International Distillery in\r\nDes Moines, so-called, was J. S. Clarkson, editor-in-chief then of the\r\nDes Moines _Register_. This International Distillery was an alcohol\r\nmanufactory, established by a man by the name of Kidd. Before he\r\ninvested his money in the plant he had taken the precaution to consult\r\nwith a number of prominent citizens and prohibitionists of the city of\r\nDes Moines, to know whether or not his enterprise would at all be\r\naffected by the constitutional amendment or the statute that might be\r\npassed in pursuance thereof. Pending the action of the general assembly\r\nupon the constitutional amendment, the Des Moines _Register_ had\r\ninsisted upon some legislative interpretation of the meaning and effect\r\nof the proposed amendment upon the question of the manufacture of\r\nalcohol within the state as an article of commerce, for the purpose of\r\nshipping the same to the markets abroad and not to be sold within the\r\nstate. In pursuance of the suggestion of the Des Moines _Register_, the\r\nstate senate of Iowa in 1882 adopted the following explanatory\r\nresolution as to the meaning and intent of the amendment then pending,\r\nand thereafter to be voted upon by the people, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Whereas, doubts have been suggested as to the true intent and\r\n    meaning of the joint resolution agreed to by the 18th general\r\n    assembly, and by this general assembly, as proposing to amend the\r\n    constitution of the state so as to prohibit the manufacture and\r\n    sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage within this state; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, it is desirable that such doubts should be removed as far\r\n    as practicable before said proposed amendment is voted upon by the\r\n    people; therefore,\r\n\r\n    Be it resolved by the senate, that said proposed amendment was and\r\n    is designed and intended to prevent the manufacture within this\r\n    state, for sale within this state, as a beverage, all intoxicating\r\n    liquors, including ale, wine and beer, and to prohibit the selling\r\n    of such liquors within this state for use as a beverage, and to\r\n    prohibit the keeping of such liquors for sale as a beverage within\r\n    this state; and was not designed to prohibit the manufacture for\r\n    sale, or keeping for sale, of such liquors for any or all other\r\n    purposes.\r\n\r\nA short time before this resolution was passed a meeting of the board\r\nof trade of the city of Des Moines was held with reference to the same\r\nmatter. It was attended by many of the most prominent prohibitionists\r\nof the city, and all concurred in the view of the amendment afterward\r\ntaken by the senate. The sense of the meeting was expressed by a\r\nresolution reported by a committee, consisting of T. S. Wright, J. S.\r\nPolk, and J. S. Clarkson, and adopted with but one dissenting vote. The\r\nresolution is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Whereas, the agitation of the proposed amendment to the\r\n    constitution of this state, prohibiting the manufacture of\r\n    alcoholic liquors for sale, is creating doubt and uncertainty in\r\n    the minds of capitalists proposing to invest a large amount of\r\n    means in the manufacture of alcohol in this city; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, we are satisfied the great majority of the people of the\r\n    state do not construe such amendment as prohibiting the manufacture\r\n    of alcohol for exportation, but that it simply prohibits its\r\n    manufacture for sale as a beverage in the state, a view in which\r\n    the leading friends and the most of the supporters of the amendment\r\n    concur; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, we are sure the people of the state would vote down\r\n    overwhelmingly any amendment absolutely prohibiting the manufacture\r\n    of alcohol; therefore be it\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that the Des Moines Board of Trade accept the\r\n    interpretation of the leading friends and supporters of the\r\n    amendment, that it intends only to prohibit the manufacture for\r\n    sale of alcoholic liquors in the state as a beverage, pledges\r\n    itself to the support and defense of capitalists investing in such\r\n    manufacturing as against all doubts as to the real meaning of the\r\n    amendment, and further, that we will lend our active influence\r\n    toward securing such legislative expression as will put upon the\r\n    amendment the construction that it will only prohibit the\r\n    manufacture of such liquors for sale as a beverage in the state.\r\n\r\nThis meeting of the board of trade, which was attended by many of the\r\nprominent prohibitionists of the city and of the state, I did not\r\nattend, though invited to be present.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the encouragement thus given to Mr. Kidd, and prior to\r\nthe taking effect of the prohibitory law of 1884, Mr. Kidd expended\r\nseveral hundred thousand dollars in the building of his plant for the\r\nmanufacture of alcohol at the city of Des Moines, Iowa, and continued\r\nsuch manufacture without interruption until certain prosecutions were\r\ncommenced against him at the instance of the Western Export\r\nAssociation, a whisky trust organized by the distillers of the United\r\nStates to prevent an excess of alcohol being manufactured, and by this\r\nmeans to regulate and keep up the price of the article. After the\r\ndecision of the principal suit undertaken in this behalf, in which I.\r\nE. Pearson and a man by the name of Loughran were nominal plaintiffs\r\nand the International Distillery and Mr. Kidd were defendants, a\r\ndecision adverse to the distillery was obtained and the defendants took\r\nan appeal to the supreme court of the state. Mr. Kidd and his attorney\r\ncalled upon me and reminded me of the fact that our firm, consisting of\r\nB. F. Kauffman and myself, had given them a written opinion to the\r\neffect that the law of 1884 did not make it unlawful to manufacture\r\nalcohol in this state as an article of merchandise, to be shipped and\r\ndisposed of beyond the limits of the state, and Mr. Kidd appealed to me\r\nto know if I was willing to accept of a retainer to argue that question\r\nin the supreme court of the state on his appeal, suggesting that he\r\nthought it my duty to do so as a lawyer, and asked if I was afraid to\r\nperform my duty in that behalf. I told him that I was not afraid and\r\naccepted of the employment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this became known to the Des Moines _Register_, its editors\r\ncommenced a series of abusive articles against me, containing\r\nmisrepresentations and insinuations, and for some reasons best known to\r\nthe editors of that paper and of which I am not advised, they became\r\nvery active in trying to promote the success of this prosecution\r\nagainst the distillery and to destroy the same. These articles of the\r\nState _Register_ created, of course, quite an inquiry among the friends\r\nof prohibition in the state, and they wrote a number of letters to Mrs.\r\nA. E. McMurray, secretary of the State Temperance League, making\r\ninquiry in regard to the matter of my employment. She accordingly wrote\r\na letter to me upon the subject and I answered the same very fully,\r\ngiving a history of the whole controversy, and particularly the motives\r\nof the men that were trying to destroy Kidd and his enterprise. Though\r\nthe letter is somewhat in detail, yet, as it is a complete answer to\r\nall of the criticisms that have been made of my professional conduct in\r\nthis matter, I give it here in full:\r\n\r\n    DES MOINES, IOWA, MARCH 19, 1887.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. E. A. McMurray, Secretary of Iowa State Temperance Alliance:\r\n\r\n    I have your communication of the 17th inst., and appreciating the\r\n    motives that have prompted it, I take pleasure in responding to\r\n    your inquiries.\r\n\r\n    The case of I. E. Pearson and S. J. Loughran against John S. Kidd,\r\n    now pending upon appeal in the supreme court of the state, and in\r\n    which I have been retained for the defendant, involves only the\r\n    question as to the right of the defendant to manufacture alcohol in\r\n    this state, under the permit granted him by the board of\r\n    supervisors of Polk county, for the purpose of export. There is no\r\n    pretense that Mr. Kidd, since the taking effect of our present\r\n    statute, has ever sold any intoxicating liquors, or alcohol, within\r\n    the state of Iowa, for any purpose whatever. The only evidence\r\n    offered to sustain the petition is contained in the official\r\n    reports of Mr. Kidd to the auditor of the county, by which it\r\n    appears that he has manufactured alcohol and shipped it out of the\r\n    state. The article manufactured by Mr. Kidd and put upon the market\r\n    is not itself a beverage, and is not and cannot be used as such in\r\n    the form in which he has produced and sold it. The case was first\r\n    tried in the circuit court of Polk county, before Judges Given and\r\n    Henderson, upon an application for a preliminary injunction. In\r\n    December last those two judges delivered an opinion in the case,\r\n    deciding that Mr. Kidd had not in any manner violated the\r\n    prohibitory law, and they refused an injunction. At the present\r\n    term of the district court Judge Conrad, our newly-elected district\r\n    judge, put a different construction upon the law and held, that by\r\n    the amendment made to the prohibitory law by the legislation of\r\n    1884 it was unlawful to manufacture alcohol in the state for\r\n    export; and this is the sole question to be determined by the\r\n    supreme court upon the appeal. This answers the first inquiry in\r\n    your letter, as to what is involved in the case.\r\n\r\n    Your next question is whether or not my employment in this case is\r\n    consistent with my past record; and whether or not it is calculated\r\n    to impair my influence and usefulness for the cause of prohibition\r\n    in the future.\r\n\r\n    I was one of the committee appointed by the State Temperance\r\n    Alliance to prepare a bill to be presented to the legislature for\r\n    its consideration, in 1884, that should carry out the will of the\r\n    people of Iowa, as expressed in the amendment to the constitution,\r\n    which amendment the supreme court of the state had then decided was\r\n    not operative, by reason of the failure of the eighteenth general\r\n    assembly to properly enter the same upon their journals.\r\n\r\n    As early as the 31st of May, 1881, I prepared and delivered\r\n    before the Methodist state convention that was held in Des Moines\r\n    at that date an address on the legal phase of the prohibitory\r\n    amendment. This address was afterwards printed in pamphlet form\r\n    by the _Prohibitionist_, and was circulated during the amendment\r\n    campaign as a campaign document, and seemed to meet with the\r\n    views of the friends of prohibition at that time. In that address\r\n    I took occasion to discuss the meaning and scope of the proposed\r\n    amendment, and in it occurs the following passage, defining my\r\n    view of the legislation that would be required by that amendment,\r\n    if adopted. I quote:\r\n\r\n        We have, in regard to spirituous liquors, laws upon our statute\r\n        books designed to prohibit their manufacture or sale, except\r\n        for medicinal, mechanical, culinary and sacramental purposes.\r\n        For these lawful purposes certain persons are authorized to\r\n        sell. They must obtain a permit, give bonds, keep books, etc.,\r\n        and are subject to the supervision and control of the\r\n        authorities. The manufacturer could be required to sell only to\r\n        persons thus authorized to sell for lawful purposes; if sold\r\n        _within the state_, otherwise than as permitted by the\r\n        statute, the act could be punished by fine or confiscation.\r\n\r\n    May 12, 1881, I attended a meeting of the State Bar Association of\r\n    Iowa, the proceedings of which are reported in the Des Moines\r\n    _Register_ of May 13, 1881. That meeting discussed the meaning\r\n    and interpretation of the proposed prohibitory amendment to the\r\n    constitution. Mr. Cummins, an attorney of this city, offered a\r\n    resolution at that meeting as follows:\r\n\r\n        Resolved, That the proposed amendment prohibits the manufacture\r\n        of intoxicating liquors within the state for sale as a beverage\r\n        without the state.\r\n\r\n    The _Register's_ report says that \"Judge Nourse arose and stated\r\n    that Iowa had no control over the liquor after it left the state.\"\r\n\r\n    From the above it will appear that my interpretation of the\r\n    constitutional amendment and of the efforts that we were about to\r\n    make at that time to control the manufacture of intoxicating\r\n    liquors within this state, did not contemplate any interference\r\n    with the manufacture of alcohol for the purpose of export. That\r\n    this view was in entire harmony with the views and opinions of the\r\n    great mass of the people then favoring legislation upon this\r\n    subject, is conclusively shown by the following extracts taken from\r\n    the _Iowa State Register_ of the following dates:\r\n\r\n        THE AMENDMENT'S MEANING\r\n\r\n        (_Iowa State Register_, February 3, 1882)\r\n\r\n        Nine-tenths of the mass of the supporters of the amendment that\r\n        we know of hold the view that it is to deal with liquors only\r\n        so far as forbidding their sale for use as a beverage in this\r\n        state. So it is not a \"Des Moines idea\" at all, but the view of\r\n        the great body of supporters of the amendment itself.\r\n\r\n        The truth is, then, as shown by the records of the supporters\r\n        of the submission of the amendment in the legislature, and by\r\n        the testimony of nine-tenths of the supporters of it among the\r\n        people who have publicly expressed themselves, that the\r\n        amendment was not intended to prohibit manufactures for export.\r\n        The State Bar Association at its last meeting discussed the\r\n        meaning of it, and failed to agree upon it, opinion being about\r\n        equally divided as to whether it means absolute and total\r\n        prohibition or only as to manufacture and sale as a beverage in\r\n        this state. We do not doubt that the original friends of the\r\n        amendment intended to have it go no further than to make it\r\n        deal with liquor as a beverage in Iowa. Nor do we doubt that\r\n        the great body of them hold to the view now that it is intended\r\n        to go no further than that. They know that the state has no\r\n        power to go beyond that, and they realize that to attempt to\r\n        carry the amendment, with the interpretation of total\r\n        prohibition or manufacture given to it, it would be defeated.\r\n\r\n        For the people of Iowa will never consent, in our judgment, to\r\n        prohibit the manufacture of their greatest staple into alcohol\r\n        for export. In that form Iowa corn can be sent into South\r\n        America and to the ports of the Mediterranean Sea, while in its\r\n        raw form it can only go there by taking from five to ten\r\n        bushels to pay the freight on one. This alcohol trade must be\r\n        supplied, and will be supplied, and Iowa corn will inevitably\r\n        supply a good deal of it, whether it is made up into alcohol\r\n        for this purpose in Iowa, to the profit of the Iowa farmer, or\r\n        whether it be shipped to Chicago and St. Louis, or elsewhere,\r\n        at the loss of the Iowa farmer, and made into form there.\r\n\r\n        We do not ask that the amendment itself shall be tinkered with.\r\n        But we do ask that the same majority which shall vote to submit\r\n        it to the people shall put on record the true interpretation of\r\n        its meaning. From this position we do not intend to be driven\r\n        either by the ridicule of whisky rings or whisky papers, nor by\r\n        the sneers of temperance papers, which have not yet examined\r\n        into the question themselves, and would have every body else as\r\n        stupid about it as they are themselves.\r\n\r\n        THE AMENDMENT'S MEANING\r\n\r\n        (_Iowa State Register_, February 7, 1882)\r\n\r\n        The truth is, and all who have watched the progress of this\r\n        contest know that it was never intended to make this amendment\r\n        aim to do more than it was possible to do, namely, to exercise\r\n        police power in its own state, and not aim to attempt to stop\r\n        inter-state commerce, nor try and prohibit the use of liquor in\r\n        other states.\r\n\r\n        (Appended is a letter from Hon. L. S. Coffin, supporting the\r\n        _Register's_ view.)\r\n\r\n        THE AMENDMENT'S MEANING\r\n\r\n        (_Iowa State Register_, February 21, 1882)\r\n\r\n        We plainly told members of the convention before it met, in\r\n        order that they might be warned in time, that thousands and\r\n        thousands of voters were waiting for the true interpretation\r\n        of the amendment before deciding as to their position toward\r\n        it--_The Register_ as a paper, among them. When they\r\n        adjourned, evading and ignoring a question on which probably\r\n        hung, and still hangs, the fate of the amendment at the polls,\r\n        we held that the legislature should take some action to\r\n        ascertain the real meaning of the amendment before ratifying\r\n        it. This we held could be done by asking the attorney general,\r\n        the lawyer and adviser of the state, to give his views as to\r\n        its actual meaning.\r\n\r\n        These stills, encouraged by the government laws and by the\r\n        people of Iowa, have begun their manufacture in the state. If\r\n        Iowa is ever to be anything of a manufacturing state, it can\r\n        hope to be so mostly, and will be profited mostly by\r\n        manufactures from its own staple crop. This can go into\r\n        alcohol, and always be sold, and yet rarely if ever, be used as\r\n        a beverage. For alcohol is used in thousands of mechanical\r\n        ways. It is made into varnish by putting gums and resins with\r\n        it. It is mixed with spirits of turpentine, and makes camphene\r\n        and burning fluids in endless quantities, used all over South\r\n        America and Europe. It is made into cologne and other perfumed\r\n        spirits by flavoring it with different kinds of oil, and all\r\n        over Europe, when fuel is scarce, it is used in vast quantities\r\n        for cooking and heating stoves. Millions and millions of\r\n        gallons of it are used for other mechanical purposes. Very\r\n        little of it in this form is ever used for a beverage. To say\r\n        that Iowa corn should be made into this form in Illinois, or in\r\n        Cincinnati, or New York, or Liverpool, but not in Iowa, is to\r\n        still leave it to be so converted, and with Iowa bearing the\r\n        whole loss and reaping none of the gain.\r\n\r\n        So we say, let us have the amendment's real meaning, so that it\r\n        may be fully understood by the people, and voted up or down as\r\n        it shall deserve to be.\r\n\r\n    As a member of the committee appointed to prepare a bill for the\r\n    action of the general assembly of 1884, I can say that there was at\r\n    no time any thought by the majority of that committee of asking any\r\n    legislation that would prohibit the manufacture of intoxicating\r\n    liquors for medicinal and mechanical purposes or for export and\r\n    sale beyond the jurisdiction of our laws. That committee was\r\n    composed of lawyers who fully understood that any legislation that\r\n    we could obtain must be based upon the police power of the state to\r\n    regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors within its jurisdiction.\r\n    The Utopian idea that the legislature of Iowa could control the use\r\n    to which intoxicating liquors, manufactured and sold as an article\r\n    of commerce in the markets of the world, might be applied in\r\n    another state, I do not think was at all entertained by the members\r\n    of that committee, save perhaps one of them, Mr. Todhunter. The\r\n    bill that was prepared by the committee and presented to the\r\n    legislature was not enacted into a law in the form in which we\r\n    originally presented it; but house file No. 516-1/2 was reported by\r\n    the committee as a substitute for that and other bills that had\r\n    been introduced on the subject and was passed in both the house and\r\n    the senate in the form in which it came from the committee, and\r\n    constitutes chapter 143 of the acts of the twentieth general\r\n    assembly. And it is this law upon which Judge Conrad bases his\r\n    opinion. That the friends of this law never intended or believed\r\n    that it would prohibit the manufacture of alcohol in this state for\r\n    export clearly appears from the record. Pending the vote upon the\r\n    passage of this bill in the house the friends of the bill indulged\r\n    in very little speech-making, and Governor Carpenter and Mr. Kerr\r\n    were the only members who undertook to reply to the assaults of its\r\n    opponents. The first effort of the opponents of the bill was to try\r\n    and load it down with amendments and thereby secure its defeat. An\r\n    amendment was offered by Mr. Bolter, of Harrison, making the bill\r\n    an absolute prohibition of the manufacture of intoxicating liquors\r\n    in this state, and this amendment came within one vote of being\r\n    adopted. The vote stood fifty votes against the amendment and\r\n    forty-nine for it. The entire fifty members that voted _against_\r\n    this amendment of Mr. Bolter, voted _for_ the passage of the bill\r\n    the next day, while of the forty-nine that voted for Mr. Bolter's\r\n    amendment nearly all of them voted against the passage of the bill.\r\n    The _Iowa State Register_ the morning after this vote was taken\r\n    contained the following leading editorial giving an account of this\r\n    attempt to kill the bill. I quote from the _State Register_ of\r\n    February 29, 1884, as follows:\r\n\r\n        The house spent the day yesterday on the prohibition bill. Our\r\n        report in detail shows how desperately the democrats are\r\n        fighting the inevitable.\r\n\r\n        The spectacle of the democrats voting at one time yesterday,\r\n        for dishonest purposes, for absolute prohibition, and next\r\n        ranging themselves on the side of the low license or\r\n        practically no temperance law at all, is a vivid illustration\r\n        of the insincerity of that party on the temperance question.\r\n        Their attitude is insincerity itself, and they are ready to do\r\n        anything to defeat honest temperance measures. The only test\r\n        vote had yesterday was on the Bolter absolute prohibition bill\r\n        (amendment) which was defeated by forty-nine yeas to fifty\r\n        nays; all the democrats and all the greenbackers and one\r\n        republican, Mr. Schee, voting for the amendment. Fifty\r\n        republicans voted in the negative.\r\n\r\n    During the pendency of the discussion the _Register_ of the\r\n    same date contains a report of the speeches of Governor Carpenter\r\n    and Mr. Kerr in favor of the bill. The following is the full text\r\n    of Mr. Kerr's speech as reported in the _Register_ of February\r\n    28, 1884. Mr. Kerr said:\r\n\r\n        The opponents of the bill were wonderfully afraid it would not\r\n        prohibit. There had never been any question as to the\r\n        constitutionality of the amendment passed in 1882. It was only\r\n        the manner of its enactment by the nineteenth general assembly\r\n        that had rendered it invalid. He agreed with Mr. Dabney that\r\n        the manufacture of liquors for any purpose was wrong. What was\r\n        it the people of the state wanted to prohibit? The saloons;\r\n        those hot-beds of infamy that were constantly bringing disgrace\r\n        upon the state and misery upon the people. Any representative\r\n        who fails to crystallize into form of law the will of the\r\n        people fails to do his duty. How are we to know this sentiment,\r\n        if not by the votes of the people? There is no better way. Mr.\r\n        Bolter was eloquent in his denunciations of the evils of\r\n        intoxication and he agreed with that gentleman and hoped when\r\n        the time came the man from Harrison would vote in accordance\r\n        with that sentiment. There are no interests in the state,\r\n        vested or otherwise, that are higher than the interests of the\r\n        whole people of the state, and it was better for a few to lose\r\n        a few dollars than to entail and fasten upon the state an\r\n        industry that directly or indirectly injures every man in it.\r\n        It is best for all to have the business wiped out. Mr. Merrill\r\n        asked Mr. Kerr if the bill permitted the manufacture of liquors\r\n        for export. Mr. Kerr replied that the bill had been prepared by\r\n        its friends and it was not intended to have it loaded down by\r\n        its enemies. _The intention of the law was not to prohibit\r\n        the manufacture for exportation, as there were some doubts as\r\n        to whether that could be done._\r\n\r\n    This law as it passed the house was published in full in the\r\n    _Register_ of the 28th of February, and on the 29th of February\r\n     wehave this leading editorial in the same paper:\r\n\r\n        The _Iowa City Press_ tries to prove the impossible thing\r\n        that the proposed prohibitory law in Iowa will discriminate\r\n        against Iowa brewers and in favor of Iowa distillers. The same\r\n        stale cry of the democratic campaign. We have heretofore shown\r\n        that the proposed interdiction treats distillery and brewery\r\n        alike _and leaves both free to manufacture for export_.\r\n\r\n        As to the vineyards of Johnson and other Iowa counties, their\r\n        products ought to be able to ship as far and sell as well as\r\n        the product of the Iowa distillers, and it will do so if it is\r\n        a good article; if it is not a good article it will find no\r\n        buyer at home now or abroad hereafter.\r\n\r\n    I have quoted the above remarks of Mr. Kerr, for the reason that\r\n    Mr. Kerr was one of the most staunch and extreme prohibitionists on\r\n    that he was in favor of absolute prohibition; but at the same time\r\n    he distinctly repudiates the idea that the legislation which he was\r\n    then advocating was intended to accomplish any such end. The state\r\n    temperance convention had simply demanded of the legislature that\r\n    the will of the people of Iowa as expressed in the vote upon the\r\n    constitutional amendment should be embodied in a law of the state.\r\n    Or as Mr. Kerr very significantly remarks, should be \"crystallized\r\n    into law.\" It is well known as a part of the history of this\r\n    temperance movement that the _Iowa State Register_, the leading\r\n    journal of the state that advocated the constitutional amendment,\r\n    demanded of the nineteenth general assembly, as one of the\r\n    conditions upon which it would support the amendment, that it\r\n    should adopt a joint resolution defining the meaning and intent of\r\n    that proposed amendment, and that it should declare that it was not\r\n    intended to prevent the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for the\r\n    purpose of export and sale beyond the state boundaries. That\r\n    resolution, with the vote by which it was adopted, is on page 501\r\n    of the senate journal, 1882, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n        Whereas, doubts have been suggested as to the true intent\r\n        and meaning of the joint resolution proposing to amend the\r\n        constitution of this state, etc.; therefore be it\r\n\r\n        _Resolved by the senate_, that said proposed amendment was and\r\n        is designed and intended to prohibit the manufacture within\r\n        this state _for sale within this state_ as a beverage, of all\r\n        intoxicating liquors, including ale, wine and beer, and to\r\n        prohibit the selling of such liquors _within this state_ for\r\n        use as a beverage, and prohibit the keeping of such liquors,\r\n        for sale as a beverage _within this state_; and was not\r\n        designed to prohibit the manufacture, sale or keeping for sale\r\n        of such liquors for any or all other purposes.\r\n\r\n        The yeas were: Senators Abraham, Arnold, Boling, Brown of\r\n        Keokuk, CLARK OF PAGE, Cotton, Dashiel, Gillet, Greenlee,\r\n        Huston, Hartshorn, HEMMINGWAY, Johnson, Kamrar, Logan,\r\n        Marshall, Nichols of Benton, Nichols of Guthrie, NICHOLS OF\r\n        MUSCATINE, Parker, Patrick, Poyneer, Prizer, Russell of Greene,\r\n        Russell of Jones, Sudlow, Terrill, Wall, Whaley, Wilson,\r\n        Wright--31.\r\n\r\n    All republicans and all _prohibitionists_, except Wall, who was a\r\n    greenbacker. Those who think that it is disloyalty to the cause in\r\n    me to advocate this same doctrine now should reflect that Clark of\r\n    Page, and Hemmingway, and Pliney Nichols, are all in the same\r\n    boat--to say nothing of the _Iowa State Register_, at whose\r\n    special procurement this resolution was passed. The next morning\r\n    after this resolution was adopted, March 18, 1882, the _Register_\r\n    contained the following editorial:\r\n\r\n        The senate defined the meaning of the proposed prohibitory\r\n        amendment and gave to it the beverage interpretation for which\r\n        the _Register_ has so steadily and persistently contended. So\r\n        that now the people of Iowa have the true definition of the\r\n        amendment, which is, that it is to deal with liquors in\r\n        manufacture and sale only as a beverage _in the state of\r\n        Iowa_. It was this interpretation that the _Register_ asked\r\n        for in order to support it.\r\n\r\n    But the meaning of this law is, in my judgment, clear, from the\r\n    text of the act itself without reference to this legislative\r\n    history. This law left in full force section 1542 of the code,\r\n    which defines the offense of keeping intoxicating liquors with\r\n    intent to sell the same in the following terms:\r\n\r\n        No person shall own and keep, or be in any way concerned,\r\n        engaged or employed in owning or keeping intoxicating liquors\r\n        _with intent to sell the same within this state_, or\r\n        permit the same to be sold therein, in violation of the\r\n        provisions hereof.\r\n\r\n    This is in entire harmony with two decisions of our supreme court\r\n    rendered prior to 1884, declaring that alcohol was an article of\r\n    commerce that might be lawfully held and owned and kept within this\r\n    state and for sale and export beyond the state. The prohibition\r\n    contained in this section, 1542, against keeping intoxicating\r\n    liquors with intent to sell the same within the state, is a clear\r\n    declaration of the legislature that to keep or own the same with\r\n    intent to sell it beyond the bounds of the state is not a violation\r\n    of the law. And the amendment of 1884 in regard to the\r\n    transportation of liquors, an amendment which I prepared myself and\r\n    which was incorporated in the law in the very language in which I\r\n    wrote it, prohibits any railroad company or common carrier from\r\n    knowingly \"bringing into the state\" or \"transporting intoxicating\r\n    liquors between points within the state\" without first having been\r\n    furnished with a certificate from the county auditor certifying\r\n    that the consignee or person for whom the liquor is to be\r\n    transported is authorized to sell the same within the state. It is\r\n    very evident, that if this provision of law, which is section 1553,\r\n    was intended to prohibit the export of intoxicating liquors, it\r\n    would not have been so careful to limit the prohibition to\r\n    importation and to transportation between points within the state.\r\n    The section was written with express reference to the theory that\r\n    the manufacture of intoxicating liquors in this state for purposes\r\n    of export was not prohibited by law.\r\n\r\n    After this law of 1884 took effect, it will be remembered, that we\r\n    organized in Iowa county alliances for the purpose of prosecuting\r\n    offenders and enforcing its penalties. Such an organization was\r\n    effected in Polk county, and I had the honor of being nominated as\r\n    the chairman of the judiciary committee of such organization, which\r\n    committee was charged with the duty of employing attorneys and\r\n    enrolling prosecutions under the law. In May, 1884, Judge C. C.\r\n    Cole, of this city, received from the Western Export Association of\r\n    Distillers in the United States a claim against the International\r\n    Distillery for $17,499.68, which it was claimed Mr. Kidd owed the\r\n    pool, on account of over-production. It will be necessary to give\r\n    some explanation of the character of this claim. The Western Export\r\n    Association is an association of the alcohol distillers of the\r\n    United States, chiefly located at Peoria, Illinois, whereby they\r\n    undertake to control the manufacture of alcohol and limit its\r\n    production in relation to the demand, and thus control and keep up\r\n    the price of the article. The entire scheme is an unlawful one as\r\n    against public policy, in that it establishes a monopoly and\r\n    prevents competition in the production of a legitimate article of\r\n    commerce and sale. Judge Cole was too good a lawyer to go into\r\n    court with a suit upon such a demand, and he conceived the idea of\r\n    using the criminal processes of the law against Mr. Kidd for the\r\n    purpose of extorting from him this demand of the whisky pool. In\r\n    accordance with this purpose Mr. J. S. Clark, his partner and\r\n    afterwards one of the plaintiffs in this present suit, Mr. S. J.\r\n    Loughran, was induced to appear before the county alliance and\r\n    offer the services of Mr. Cole free of any charge to the alliance,\r\n    for the purpose of prosecuting the International Distillery and\r\n    harassing them with prosecutions upon alleged violation of the law,\r\n    and asking that the secretary of our association, Mr. Littleton,\r\n    give the use of his name for the purpose of filing complaints. The\r\n    proposition was referred to the judiciary committee of the county\r\n    alliance, of which I was chairman, and was duly presented to me by\r\n    the secretary. It is hardly necessary for me to say that I refused\r\n    to enter into such a conspiracy or to favor the use of the alliance\r\n    for any such purpose. We had organized in good faith in this county\r\n    for the purpose of enforcing the prohibitory law in the interest of\r\n    the cause of temperance, and not for the purpose of collecting the\r\n    illegal demands of the whisky pool and the distillers of Illinois.\r\n    The following is a literal copy of Judge Cole's letter to Mr. John\r\n    S. Kidd, in relation to this claim:\r\n\r\n        DES MOINES, IOWA, MAY 24, 1884.\r\n\r\n        John S. Kidd, Esq., President International Distillery Company,\r\n        Des Moines, Iowa.\r\n\r\n        Dear Sir: The Western Export Association has placed in my hands\r\n        for collection by immediate suit a claim of $17,499.68 against\r\n        the International Distillery Company, and you as its president.\r\n        My pleasant personal associations with you have prompted me to\r\n        ask and obtain permission for my client to delay the actual\r\n        bringing of the suit till noon of Monday next, May 26th. I\r\n        could not obtain leave for further delay because certain\r\n        members of the association, who also have retained me to bring\r\n        suit if this is not settled, claim that they are being further\r\n        damaged to the extent of thousands of dollars daily, by the\r\n        course of your company. Hoping to see you and to receive\r\n        payment of the claim before Monday noon, I remain as ever\r\n\r\n        Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n        C. C. Cole\r\n\r\n    To this very remarkable epistle Mr. Kidd made response of the same\r\n    date as follows:\r\n\r\n        Permit me to suggest that you should not allow personal\r\n        considerations to interfere with professional duties. This bit\r\n        of advice is given gratis and by way of friendly return for the\r\n        favor of your grace over Sabbath on the modest demand you make.\r\n\r\n        Yours truly,\r\n\r\n        John S. Kidd\r\n\r\n    It is unnecessary to say in this connection that Judge Cole never\r\n    filed any petition in court on this modest demand. After the county\r\n    alliance refused the use of its name or influence for the purpose\r\n    of extorting this money out of Mr. Kidd, a clerk in Judge Cole's\r\n    law office filed complaint against Mr. Kidd and procured warrants\r\n    for the seizure of alcohol manufactured and shipped for export\r\n    beyond the bounds of the state. All of these prosecutions proved\r\n    ignominious failures. The present suit against Mr. Kidd was\r\n    commenced in December, 1885, Lewis Todhunter appearing of record as\r\n    attorney for the plaintiff, and I. E. Pearson and S. J. Loughran as\r\n    the nominal plaintiffs.\r\n\r\n    In October, 1885, Mr. Loughran, at a meeting of the county\r\n    alliance, offered a resolution instructing its officers to commence\r\n    suit against the International Distillery, _provided evidence\r\n    could be found against it_. I was not present at the meeting,\r\n    and on motion of Mr. Lee the resolution was referred to the\r\n    judiciary committee.\r\n\r\n    Upon inquiry of Mr. Harvey, the then president, and Mr. Littleton,\r\n    the secretary, I found that neither of those officers had any\r\n    information upon which a suit could be predicated, and neither\r\n    would advise a prosecution. Mr. Loughran nor any one else ever\r\n    approached the committee on the subject, or furnished the alliance\r\n    any evidence.\r\n\r\n    The statement has been made that I was at this time the attorney\r\n    for Mr. Kidd. This is wholly untrue. It is true, however, that\r\n    early in 1884 the firm of Nourse & Kauffman was called upon by Mr.\r\n    Kidd, for a consultation with the attorneys, Messrs. Lehmann &\r\n    Park, in regard to his business affairs, and upon the matter of the\r\n    construction of the act of 1884, Mr. Kidd advising us at that time\r\n    that he desired strictly to observe the law in the manufacture of\r\n    alcohol. We gave him our opinion at the time, and he paid our firm\r\n    a fee of fifty dollars. I have had no business connection with Mr.\r\n    Kidd or the International Distillery since that time, until my\r\n    employment in this case, after the decision of Judge Conrad a few\r\n    weeks ago.\r\n\r\n    Early in the year 1886 the secretary of the Polk county alliance\r\n    reported that the funds of the organization and the available\r\n    subscriptions were exhausted, and that liabilities had been\r\n    incurred that we were unable to meet. Several unsuccessful efforts\r\n    to have the subscriptions to our funds renewed were made. Mr.\r\n    Harvey, on account of other engagements, declined a re-election as\r\n    president of the county alliance in June, 1886. It seemed\r\n    impossible to get a responsible person to accept of the position.\r\n    Under these circumstances I. E. Pearson succeeded to that office.\r\n    Though a gentleman of elegant leisure, he has never, since his\r\n    election, been able, by his influence or exertions, to put a dollar\r\n    into the treasury of the alliance.\r\n\r\n    He has, however, been operating quite extensively on \"his own\r\n    hook,\" as he says. His principal enterprise, apart from his present\r\n    suit against Mr. Kidd, has been to watch the incoming of the\r\n    monthly reports that the law requires the druggist to make to the\r\n    county auditor, and whenever, by any misadventure, their reports\r\n    have been delayed a few days beyond the time fixed by the law,\r\n    Pearson has brought suit against them for the one hundred dollars\r\n    penalty provided by the statute, and then compromised for the\r\n    largest amount he could get out of the defendant. In this way he\r\n    has made hundreds of dollars for himself and has been able to\r\n    support such an improved style of personal appearance that it has\r\n    attracted public attention and newspaper comment.\r\n\r\n    In this new _role_ of \"affidavit maker\" to the _State Register_ he\r\n    has already attained distinction. Whether this enterprise will\r\n    prove a financial success I do not know, as I am not advised as to\r\n    the terms of the new partnership. It is not yet known whether\r\n    Pearson has taken the _State Register_ into partnership, or\r\n    whether the _Register_ has taken in Pearson.\r\n\r\n    It has always been my fortune in life to antagonize men of this\r\n    stamp. If I have not as many friends as some men of less positive\r\n    opinions, I have the consolation to know that I have reason to be\r\n    proud of the character of my enemies.\r\n\r\n    By what means he has induced eminent counsel, backed by the active\r\n    influence of the _Iowa State Register_, to prosecute this case\r\n    against Mr. Kidd, remains a mystery. To the oft-repeated inquiries\r\n    of members of the alliance for information on this subject his\r\n    answers have been evasive and entirely unsatisfactory. Judge Cole\r\n    in his letter to Mr. Kidd mentions that certain members of the\r\n    export association were being damaged \"to the extent of thousands\r\n    of dollars daily\" by the course pursued by the International\r\n    Distillery. \"Thousands of dollars daily\" is a large amount of\r\n    money, and a very grave apprehension exists in the minds of many of\r\n    the temperance men of this community that these \"certain other\r\n    individuals\" are not idle spectators in this contest. When or how\r\n    Judge Cole and Mr. Runnells or the _Iowa State Register_ came\r\n    into the case I do not know--I only know that they \"got there.\"\r\n\r\n        \"... he has no wings at all,\r\n        But he gets there all the same.\"\r\n\r\n    Judge Cole and Mr. Runnells are also defending Hurlbut, Hess & Co.,\r\n    and the six thousand dollars of intoxicating liquors condemned by\r\n    the jury in that case. They are also attorneys for Rowe, the man\r\n    who shot down Constable Logan. No one, I believe, has questioned\r\n    their right to act as counsel for the defense in these matters or\r\n    even suggested the impropriety of their employment. I certainly\r\n    would not do so. The _Iowa State Register_ has besought the\r\n    public to suspend any judgment as to the guilt or innocence of\r\n    Rowe, but to await the judicial investigation of the case. This is\r\n    certainly commendable forbearance, but why the same spirit of fair\r\n    play should not be manifested toward Mr. Kidd pending the judicial\r\n    determination of his rights, I cannot understand. Does it make any\r\n    difference because Mr. Runnells is defending in the one case and\r\n    prosecuting in the other? Surely a man who has invested two hundred\r\n    and fifty thousand dollars in manufacturing in our city, by the\r\n    advice and encouragement of the _Register_, is entitled to as\r\n    much consideration as the man who takes the life of a public\r\n    officer whilst in the discharge of an official duty. The statement\r\n    that the State Temperance Alliance has ever favored or endorsed the\r\n    prosecution of Mr. Kidd is wholly without foundation.\r\n\r\n    I have now answered very fully all of the inquiries in your letter\r\n    save, perhaps, the last, and that is as to the relation and effect\r\n    of the present suit to the cause of prohibition in Iowa. Permit me\r\n    to say to you, and through you to the true friends of prohibition\r\n    in this state, that we have now upon our statute books a most\r\n    excellent law, that is every day gaining favor with the people, and\r\n    that has survived all open warfare upon it. In my humble judgment\r\n    the most we now have to fear is not the open opposition of its\r\n    enemies, but the follies and indiscretions of its friends. As I\r\n    have already conclusively shown in this communication, we procured\r\n    the enactment of this law by assuring the people of this state that\r\n    we did not intend to interfere with the manufacture of alcohol or\r\n    intoxicating liquors for medicinal or mechanical purposes, nor as\r\n    an article of commerce for export. The question is, have we\r\n    anything to gain by duplicity and insincerity, and by now claiming\r\n    for this law what we did not claim for it when we procured its\r\n    enactment by the general assembly? Above all things, have we, as\r\n    prohibitionists, anything to gain by entering into an alliance with\r\n    the distillers of other states who are making war upon a productive\r\n    industry in our own state, for the sole purpose of promoting their\r\n    own pecuniary interests in destroying competition in their\r\n    business? Have we anything to gain by turning aside from the great\r\n    work that we have undertaken of destroying the saloon as a place of\r\n    resort where our young men are taught the habit of intoxication,\r\n    and engaging in the Utopian scheme of regulating the supply of\r\n    alcohol in the markets of the world, the use of which it is\r\n    impossible for us to control after it passes beyond the\r\n    jurisdiction of our laws?\r\n\r\n    There is another very grave and important question that the true\r\n    friends of prohibition in Iowa should stop to consider. The courts\r\n    of the United States have more than intimated that if the\r\n    prohibitory law of Iowa does in fact destroy the value of property\r\n    built for a use which was lawful at the time of its erection, that\r\n    such a law is a violation of the constitution of the United States,\r\n    unless it also makes provision for compensation to the owner.\r\n\r\n    This International Distillery was built and in full operation\r\n    before the amendment of 1884 was enacted. By virtue of its\r\n    provisions a limitation only, in my humble judgment, was placed\r\n    upon the uses for which alcohol might be sold within the state. The\r\n    answer to the position that our law is unconstitutional because it\r\n    affects the value of this property is, that it does not prevent the\r\n    manufacture of alcohol for export or for sale within the state for\r\n    lawful purposes. But if we propose to destroy the value of this\r\n    property by this new interpretation of our statute, and say that it\r\n    is our purpose and intent to prevent its use for the manufacture of\r\n    alcohol for export, then may we not seriously apprehend that our\r\n    law will be held unconstitutional, and may we not, in attempting\r\n    too much, lose all? The fable of the dog crossing the log over the\r\n    stream, that dropped the meat from his mouth in order that he might\r\n    grasp the shadow, I would recommend to the careful study and\r\n    perusal of some of our pretended friends.\r\n\r\n    But there is still another political phase of this question that we\r\n    ought to carefully consider. Heretofore we have put the opponents\r\n    of this law upon the necessity of defending the saloon as an\r\n    institution; we have made the suppression of these places of resort\r\n    the war-cry of our campaign. Is it the part of wisdom to change\r\n    this issue and assume the affirmative of the proposition that the\r\n    good order and peace of society requires that we should ship our\r\n    corn to Peoria to be manufactured into alcohol rather than have it\r\n    manufactured in our own state, either for medicinal or mechanical\r\n    purposes or for export? For one I fail to see any wisdom in such a\r\n    proceeding. I am not prepared to join in or acquiesce in such a\r\n    folly. In accepting a retainer from Mr. Kidd in the case now\r\n    pending in the supreme court I did so because it was my plain duty,\r\n    as a lawyer, to defend the legal rights as I believe them to be, of\r\n    a man whose property was unjustly and illegally assailed. I was not\r\n    employed in the case until after Judge Conrad's decision. That the\r\n    temperance people of Iowa will find any fault with me for\r\n    presenting to the supreme court the question of law involved in\r\n    this appeal I cannot well believe. How will these questions be\r\n    answered?\r\n\r\n    _First._ Do they ask or desire that the property of any citizen\r\n    shall be destroyed and condemned without a fair and full trial\r\n    before the appellate court?\r\n\r\n    _Second._ Does not a fair trial also involve the right of the\r\n    citizen to have the aid of a counsel?\r\n\r\n    _Third._ If the defendant is to have the aid of counsel, can my\r\n    employment be any more objectionable than the employment of one\r\n    who is an enemy of the law?\r\n\r\n    _Fourth._ Is it not true that the view of the statute that I\r\n    propose to present to the court, is the view that we nearly all\r\n    _pretended_ to have when we procured the passage of the law?\r\n\r\n    The decision of Judge Conrad, though made no doubt with the utmost\r\n    sincerity and good faith on his part, I regard as a mistake, and an\r\n    unfortunate one for the cause of prohibition. In the interview\r\n    published by the _Register_ I said that neither the decisions\r\n    of courts nor the conduct of lawyers or newspapers would defeat the\r\n    ultimate triumph of prohibition. I still have faith in that\r\n    proposition. If I have erred, or if the courts shall decide too\r\n    much or too little, yet legal prohibition as a principle is right,\r\n    and I believe will ultimately triumph. I do not believe the present\r\n    prosecution of Mr. Kidd is justified by the law or the facts, and\r\n    injustice and illegal prosecutions are not in my judgment the means\r\n    of success in a good cause. Whatever personal malice may originate\r\n    of misrepresentation or abuse of me in this matter, gives me no\r\n    concern. I am used to this kind of thing and have never turned\r\n    aside from my professional duty because of attempted newspaper\r\n    intimidations. I am now in the thirty-sixth year of my practice in\r\n    Iowa, and can afford, I think, to perform a plain professional\r\n    duty. Asking pardon for the extent of this communication, which I\r\n    have necessarily made somewhat in detail in order that your\r\n    questions might be fully answered, I remain as I have ever been, an\r\n    earnest friend and co-worker in the cause of prohibition, and\r\n\r\n    Most truly your humble servant,\r\n\r\n    C. C. NOURSE\r\n\r\nThe case of Pearson & Loughran against the International Distillery and\r\nJ. S. Kidd was submitted to the supreme court upon oral and printed\r\nargument at the June term, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe republican state convention that was to nominate a supreme judge\r\nmet at Des Moines, August 24th of that year. The supreme court at that\r\ntime consisted of W. H. Seevers, Joseph Reed, Jos. M. Beck, James H.\r\nRothrock, and Austin Adams. The latter named judge's term expired the\r\nfirst of January, 1888, and either his renomination or the nomination\r\nof some one in lieu of him came before the republican convention to be\r\nheld in August. J. S. Clarkson, the editor of the _Register_, and\r\nMr. John Runnells, Esquire, the attorney of record nominally of Pearson\r\nand Loughran, but in fact acting for the whisky trust; to-wit, the\r\nWestern Export Association, secured their nomination as delegates to\r\nthe republican state convention. During the sitting of the court and\r\nbefore any opinion was announced it was well understood in the\r\ncommunity that Judges Seevers and Reed had written an opinion reversing\r\nthe decision of Judge Conrad, and that Judges Beck and Rothrock had\r\nwritten an opinion affirming the case, and that the fifth judge;\r\nto-wit, Judge Adams, had not yet officially concurred in either opinion\r\nand that the result of the case would rest with Judge Adams as he might\r\nconcur with one or the other of these opinions. J. S. Clarkson and Mr.\r\nJohn Runnells, just prior to the meeting of the state convention, asked\r\nfor a private interview with Judge Adams, which was accorded them. Just\r\nwhat was said or done in that interview and what subjects were\r\ndiscussed between these gentlemen and Judge Adams I do not know. It is\r\npossible they talked about the weather and that the question of the\r\nrenomination of Judge Adams, and his views and opinions or inclinations\r\nwith reference to the distillery, may not have been mentioned between\r\nthem. Very considerable opposition to Judge Adams's renomination had\r\ndeveloped throughout the state, principally upon the ground of his\r\nalleged favoritism to the railroad interests, and his renomination was\r\nin great doubt; indeed, when the convention met Judge Adams failed to\r\nget the nomination, and his friends, Clarkson and Runnells, only\r\nsucceeded in controlling thirteen votes in his favor in the Polk county\r\ndelegation. After the convention and the defeat of Judge Adams, Mr.\r\nClarkson wrote a very mournful howl over Judge Adams's defeat,\r\nexceedingly regretting the result. Still there was no opinion filed in\r\nthe distillery case until the night of the 10th day of September\r\nfollowing, when Judge Adams's name appears as concurring in the opinion\r\nwritten by Judge Beck. These two opinions are very remarkable. The\r\nopinion written by Judge Beck and concurred in by Rothrock and Adams\r\nassumes the extraordinary position that inasmuch as the law in\r\nexpressed terms permitted the manufacture of alcohol within the state\r\nfor medicinal, mechanical, and sacramental purposes, and did not in\r\nterms provide for the manufacture within the state for export,\r\ntherefore it was prohibited by the law.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the minority of the court written by Judge Seevers, and\r\nconcurred in by Judge Reed, assumes the position that inasmuch as the\r\nmanufacture for the purpose of export was not prohibited, therefore, it\r\nwas lawful. The opinion of the majority of the court, it was claimed,\r\nwas contrary to the language and decision of our supreme court in the\r\ncases theretofore decided by the court in Niles v. Fries, 35 Iowa, 41,\r\nand Becker v. Betten, 39 Iowa, 668. In the former case in 35 Iowa,\r\nJudge Beck himself in delivering the opinion of the court uses the\r\nfollowing language: \"Intoxicating liquors in the possession of a\r\ncitizen who holds them for the purpose of selling them lawfully,\r\n_within the state_, or for transporting them without the state for\r\nlawful traffic, are not, under the statute, subject to seizure.\" Judge\r\nBeck gets rid of the force and effect of his prior decision by saying\r\nthat his language was \"obiter dicta.\" When, however, the opinion comes\r\nto wrestle with the question as to confining the police power of the\r\nstate, to matters that concern the good order of society and the health\r\nof the people of the state, but did not extend to the inhabitants of\r\nthe other states of the Union, Judge Beck gets rid of this suggestion\r\nby claiming that there is a sort of comity between the states by which\r\nthe legislature of one state ought to consider the well being and\r\nhappiness of the people of the other states. This suggestion is rather\r\nfanciful than otherwise, particularly as applied to this case, for that\r\nthe other states, particularly New York to which this alcohol was\r\nexported, have never undertaken to control either the manufacture,\r\nsale, or use of alcoholic spirits. In the interpretation of all\r\nstatutes and in case of doubt it is a well recognized rule of\r\ninterpretation that the court must consider what evil it was existing\r\nprior to the enactment of the statute that the statute was intended to\r\ncorrect or remedy. The idea that the people of Iowa were seized with a\r\ndesire to limit the manufacture of alcohol in order to prevent it being\r\ntaken to New York was simply Utopian and had no real existence. The\r\nreal parties that were attempting to limit the manufacture of alcohol\r\nin Iowa for export was the whisky trust that desired to keep up the\r\nprice of the article in the New York market, and this fact was well\r\nknown to the supreme court and to the three judges that concurred in\r\nthe opinion of the majority. Judge Beck's opinion, aside from the\r\nquestion of law involved, was a very excellent temperance speech\r\nagainst the use of alcohol as a beverage, but had no relation whatever\r\nto the case. I write thus freely upon this subject for the reason that\r\nMr. Kauffman and myself had given a written opinion as to the\r\nreasonable construction of this law, relying upon the former decisions\r\nof our own supreme court and the language of Judge Beck himself. Mr.\r\nKidd had made his investment in good faith in a manufacturing industry,\r\nmanufacturing an article that was recognized as useful for many\r\npurposes, both as a medicine and for mechanical purposes, and there was\r\nnothing in the article itself to determine the use for which it was\r\nintended when it was manufactured. Whilst it might be used for the\r\npurpose of making a beverage destructive to human life and happiness,\r\nyet, so far as the law was concerned, it was only by restricting the\r\nsale of it for the destructive uses to which it might be applied that\r\nany remedy could be made effectual.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this decision politically, as a means of destroying the\r\nfaith of the people in a law that the legislature had wisely passed,\r\nwas soon made manifest. There was at this time in the city of Des\r\nMoines a young lawyer, then attorney for the Chicago and Rock Island\r\nRailroad Company, ambitious for political preferment, by the name of A.\r\nB. Cummins. His partner in business was Mr. Carroll Wright, the son of\r\nex-Chief Justice Wright who was attorney for Koehler & Lange in\r\nsecuring the opinion of the supreme court that destroyed legally the\r\nconstitutional amendment. A meeting of anti-prohibition republicans was\r\ncalled and held at the city council chamber in the city of Des Moines\r\nabout August 25, 1887, in which certain resolutions were adopted\r\ndenouncing the prohibitory law and favoring local option and licensing\r\nof the sale of intoxicating liquors. The resolutions of that convention\r\nwere signed by ninety-two nominal republicans, and they nominated as\r\ntheir candidates for the legislature A. B. Cummins and Adam Baker. Mr.\r\nCummins accepted the nomination in a letter dated August 25, 1887,\r\nwriting a letter joining in the denunciations against the prohibitory\r\nlaw of Iowa and the fraudulent practices of the constables who had\r\ntaken advantage of the law to make profit to their own use.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work of the enemies of prohibition in Iowa,\r\nperformed as its pretended friends and advocates, there were several\r\nother causes at work to weaken the confidence of the people in the\r\nstatute. Two constables of the city of Des Moines set about to make\r\nmoney out of the enforcement of the law. They entered into a conspiracy\r\nwith the persons who were selling intoxicating liquors, inducing them\r\nto put one or two bottles of liquor in a convenient place in their\r\nestablishments, and then filing information under the law against the\r\nplace, procuring a search warrant, searching the place and finding\r\nthese few bottles, prosecuting and destroying the two bottles, no one\r\nappearing to claim the same, and then having the costs of the\r\nproceedings all taxed up against the county. These bills ran up to\r\nhundreds of dollars, and the enemies of the law were loud in their\r\ndenunciations of the statute, but had little to say against the\r\ncriminal practices of those whose duty it was to observe and enforce\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nMr. Cummins made a vigorous canvass of the county, receiving in\r\naddition to the nomination of these so-called republicans, the\r\nnomination of the democratic convention, and by the aid of the\r\ndemocratic party and the whisky interests of the county he succeeded in\r\nbeing elected a member of the next general assembly under his\r\noft-repeated pledge during the canvass to secure if possible the repeal\r\nof the prohibitory law, and the enactment of the license law.\r\n\r\nWith all these influences, however, operating against the law, the next\r\ngeneral assembly made no serious attempt to repeal the act. By an act\r\napproved January 29, 1857, the legislature had attempted to establish\r\nwhat was known as local option in Iowa. The act of 1857 provided for\r\nthe license and sale of intoxicating liquors in any county of the state\r\nwhere the people by majority vote of the electors adopted the same, and\r\nby such adoption that the provisions of the act of 1854 would stand\r\nrepealed as to that county. Our supreme court held this act of 1857 to\r\nbe unconstitutional for the reason that our constitution required that\r\nall laws should be of uniform operation, and upon this subject of\r\nuniformity the court uses the following language:\r\n\r\n    The sixth section of the bill of rights declares, that \"all acts of\r\n    a general nature shall have a uniform operation.\" Constitution,\r\n    Article I. Recognizing as we do the distinction between laws of a\r\n    general nature and those of a special or local character, we\r\n    understand by the \"operation\" of a law is meant its practical\r\n    working and effect. It is not, in our opinion, a sufficient\r\n    compliance with the requirements of the constitution, that under\r\n    the provisions of the act of the 29th of January, 1857, the\r\n    question of licensing the sale of spirituous liquors is to be\r\n    submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of all the counties\r\n    of the state. Something more is contemplated by the constitution,\r\n    in the words \"uniform operation.\" We must look further, and to the\r\n    effect of such submission to the vote of the people, and to the\r\n    consequences to result from the adoption of the law. The\r\n    prohibitory liquor law is a law of a general nature, and its\r\n    operation must be uniform throughout the state. Can we say that\r\n    such is the case, if it remains in full force in one county, while\r\n    it is repealed in others by a vote of the people, and a license law\r\n    adopted in its stead? And is the act of 1857, if the effect of it\r\n    is to bring about this want of uniformity in the operation of a law\r\n    of a general nature, to be deemed constitutional and valid? We\r\n    think not.\r\n\r\n    The vote authorized to be taken upon the adoption of the act, while\r\n    it is objectionable in a constitutional point of view, as\r\n    transferring the law-making powers from the legislature to the\r\n    people, is further objectionable in view of the possible, not to\r\n    say the probable, result of such vote. We cannot undertake to\r\n    determine, nor can it, under any circumstances, be foreseen, that\r\n    the result of the vote will be uniform in all the counties of the\r\n    state, either in favor of license or against it. In some of the\r\n    counties the vote may not be taken; in others, the majority may be\r\n    against license; while in others, the majority may be in its favor.\r\n    Unanimity of sentiment, either one way or the other, can hardly be\r\n    reckoned upon. These views, we think, add weight to the argument\r\n    against the constitutionality of submitting the act to a vote of\r\n    the people. We do not, however, base wholly upon them our\r\n    conclusion against the validity of the act in question, nor upon\r\n    the fact that the result of the vote upon the question of adopting\r\n    it may not be uniform throughout the state. Upon this latter branch\r\n    of the subject, the members of the court are not unanimous in\r\n    opinion.\r\n\r\n    The majority of the court are of the opinion, that while the act\r\n    must without doubt be deemed to be a law of a general nature, it is\r\n    liable to objection, as prescribing no uniform rule of civil\r\n    conduct to the people of the state, and as not providing of itself\r\n    for its uniform operation. The legislative power must command. It\r\n    must not leave to the people the choice to obey or not to obey its\r\n    requirements. It is not a law enacted according to the requirements\r\n    of the constitution, if there is left to the action and choice of\r\n    the people upon whom it is to operate the determination of a\r\n    question which may result in a want of uniformity in the operation\r\n    of a law of a general nature.\r\n\r\nI shall take occasion to refer to this decision of the supreme court\r\nhereafter when I come to notice the passage by the legislature of the\r\nmiserable subterfuge now known as the \"mulct law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nREGULATION OF FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TARIFFS\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the subject of temperance and prohibition for the present, the\r\nnext important question of a public nature in which I became interested\r\nprofessionally was the question of the regulation of freight and\r\npassenger tariffs by the general assembly of the state. The general\r\nassembly of 1888 enacted a law providing for the election of three\r\nRailroad Commissioners, and gave them authority to prepare schedules of\r\nrates that might be charged by the railroads of the state for the\r\ntransportation of freight and passengers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Charles Clinton Nourse_\r\n  From Photograph by Pearson.\r\n  Des Moines]\r\n\r\nUnder this statute the people elected as Commissioners Frank T.\r\nCampbell, Peter A. Dey, and Spencer Smith. In pursuance of the\r\nauthority of the statute these Commissioners proceeded to formulate\r\nschedules of rates to be charged by the several railroads of the state.\r\nThe law required the Commissioners to publish for three successive\r\nweeks in certain newspapers the date at which these rates should take\r\neffect. Before the third publication was made the attorneys of the\r\nNorthwestern Railroad Company telegraphed to the Railroad Commissioners\r\nrequesting a change of the date of the taking effect of their proposed\r\nschedule of rates, and received from the secretary of the board, under\r\nthe instructions of Mr. Dey, an answer that the time of the taking\r\neffect would be changed accordingly. A new advertisement was prepared\r\nand published, but before the three insertions were completed three of\r\nthe principal railroad companies operating in the state; to-wit, the\r\nNorthwestern, Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, and the Milwaukee & St.\r\nPaul filed their petitions with the circuit court of the United States\r\nfor an injunction against the further publication of the notice, on the\r\nground that the rates fixed by the Railroad Commissioners were not\r\n_compensatory_. The hearing of this application was had before\r\nJustice Brewer at his residence in Leavenworth, Kansas. I was employed\r\nby the Railroad Commissioners to appear in their behalf, and Mr. James\r\nT. Lain, of Davenport, was employed by certain shippers of that place\r\nto appear with me in the case. We argued the case before Justice\r\nBrewer, and he granted the injunction on the 28th of July, 1888. This\r\ninjunction in large part was based upon the evidence of the\r\ncomplainants' general manager to the effect that the Commissioners had\r\nadopted a classification known as the western classification, which, as\r\ncompared with the classification known as the Illinois classification\r\nmade a difference against the railroads of fifty per cent. Subsequent\r\nto the granting of these injunctions, upon complaint of certain\r\nshippers the Railroad Commissioners, after a hearing before them,\r\nproceeded to formulate new schedules, and in pursuance of what appeared\r\nto be the principal objection at the former hearing they adopted a\r\nclassification more favorable to the railroad companies known as the\r\nIllinois classification. Immediately upon this action of the Railroad\r\nCommissioners the railroad companies filed a supplemental bill asking a\r\nfurther injunction to restrain the Railroad Commissioners from putting\r\ninto effect these new rates with the new classification. Mr. Campbell\r\nof the Railroad Commissioners immediately waited on me asking my\r\nfurther appearance in the cause to argue the question of a further\r\ninjunction as against their new schedules and classification. He\r\nexpressed a doubt as to whether or not it was worth our efforts to\r\ndefeat this new application as he was disposed to think that Judge\r\nBrewer would grant whatever the railroad companies might ask in this\r\nbehalf. I told him that he had a duty to perform as a public officer,\r\nin my opinion, and if the Commissioners did their duty in making the\r\nproper resistance to this new application, the responsibility would\r\nrest with Judge Brewer if he failed in his duty. We accordingly made\r\nthe necessary preparation for a hearing, which was finally had at St.\r\nPaul, Minnesota. In the argument of this case the attorneys for the\r\nthree railroads applying for the injunction made a very formidable\r\narray of distinguished counsel embracing the ablest lawyers of Chicago\r\nand Milwaukee. A. J. Baker was then Attorney General of the state of\r\nIowa and nominally appeared with me for the Commissioners, but gave me\r\nno assistance whatever. We had for an audience in the argument of the\r\ncase many leading men of Minnesota, members of the State Grange of that\r\nstate, which association was then in session at St. Paul. I took into\r\nthe court-room a blackboard that I extemporized for the occasion and\r\ntaking several copies of the official reports of the railroads in\r\nquestion, I put one copy in the hands of Justice Brewer, holding\r\nanother copy in my hand and putting the figures upon the blackboard,\r\nshowing the earnings of these railroads and what they were pleased to\r\ncall their fixed charges, and demonstrating beyond question that the\r\ncomplaints made of the proposed railroad rates were without foundation.\r\nThe same person who had made an affidavit in regard to the difference\r\nbetween the Illinois and the western classification had made a new\r\naffidavit stating that there was an error in his former computation. I\r\ncriticised with some severity the reliability of the affidavits in\r\nwhich mistakes occurred according to the convenience and exigencies of\r\nthis litigation. I had not much confidence in the result, however, but\r\nI felt quite complimented when a number of the leading men of the\r\nMinnesota Grange, who were present at the argument, made me a\r\ncomplimentary visit at the hotel that evening. The attorney for the\r\nrailroad company who was expected to make the closing argument in the\r\ncase complained that he did not feel very well and only spoke about\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes in a general way, without going into the\r\nfacts or figures in the case. My supposed assistant, the Attorney\r\nGeneral of the state of Iowa, took no part in the argument, and on my\r\nway home that night I learned that he had been in conference with Mr.\r\nStickney of the Chicago Great Western Railroad Company, and had made an\r\narrangement with that gentleman for employment as attorney for that\r\ncorporation, to take effect at the close of his then official term\r\nwhich was to occur in a few months. On the 2nd day of the ensuing\r\nFebruary, 1889, Justice Brewer filed in the circuit court his opinion\r\nrefusing the injunction on the supplemental bill and entering an order\r\ndissolving the injunctions theretofore granted, at the cost of the\r\ncomplainants. The railroad companies made no further fight against the\r\naction of the Railroad Commissioners but acquiesced therein, and found\r\nthe earnings of their several roads \"compensatory.\"\r\n\r\nConcurrent with this proceeding on the part of the Northwestern\r\nRailroad Company and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, and Milwaukee &\r\nSt. Paul, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company and the\r\nBurlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern applied to and obtained from Judge\r\nFairall, of Iowa City, district judge of Johnson county, an injunction\r\nagainst the Railroad Commissioners to the same effect as that issued by\r\nJustice Brewer. I appeared with Mr. Lain before the district court and\r\nargued a motion to dissolve this injunction before Judge Fairall, which\r\nwas refused, and from his order refusing to dissolve the injunction we\r\nat once took an appeal to the supreme court of Iowa. This appeal was\r\nheard and submitted to the supreme court by both printed and oral\r\nargument, but after the action of Justice Brewer upon the supplemental\r\nbill in the federal court, the attorneys for the Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific Railroad Company and the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern\r\ndismissed their suit in the district court of Johnson county, and then\r\napplied to the supreme court for an order dismissing the appeal in that\r\ncourt. We resisted this application, but the court held that as the\r\noriginal suit was dismissed the injunction itself necessarily was\r\ndissolved, and as the appeal was only from an interlocutory order, the\r\ncourt had no occasion to deliver an opinion upon the merits of the\r\ncontroversy. The opinion of the court permitting these parties to\r\ndismiss their suit in this manner will be found in 76th Iowa, 278.\r\n\r\nMr. A. B. Cummins, since Governor of the state of Iowa, has lately been\r\nposing as the original friend of the people in this fight against\r\nrailroad injustice. It would be well to state here that I do not know\r\nwhen he became a convert to the importance of regulating the action of\r\nrailroads in justice to the people, but as the foregoing was the first\r\ngreat contest we had in Iowa on this subject, I give here a speech\r\ndelivered by that gentleman as late as December 22, 1891, at a banquet\r\nof the Railroad Employees' Club, as follows:\r\n\r\n    It is the railroad, it is the spirit that has moved and stimulated\r\n    that property which has made it possible to people in the valley of\r\n    the Mississippi, which has made it possible to create within the\r\n    limits of the United States a greater wealth than has any other\r\n    nation on the face of the earth. I speak of the transportation\r\n    industry as limited to railways, and so limited, it is instructive\r\n    to reflect that the railways of the earth are now of the value of\r\n    something near $33,000,000,000, an appalling sum that no human mind\r\n    can appreciate, save when compared with some other species of\r\n    property. The railways of the earth, without reckoning either \"wind\r\n    or water,\" are equal to one-tenth of all the property of the world.\r\n    The railways represent substantially one-third of all the invested\r\n    capital of mankind; and if all the currency of the civilized world\r\n    and its gold and all its silver and its currency in paper; all its\r\n    precious stones, its diamonds and rubies were heaped together in\r\n    such places as would contain them, they would still represent less\r\n    than one-half of the railway property of the world. The comparisons\r\n    indicate in what a stupendous enterprise you are now engaged. I\r\n    have no disposition, whatever, to convert a single sentiment\r\n    suggested by my brother Wallace, I do not recognize a conflict\r\n    between the farmers of the nation or the state of Iowa and the\r\n    railways. No fair man ought to recognize any such conflict, but\r\n    THAT THE STATE OF IOWA OR THAT HER ORGANIZED TRIBUNALS HAVE DONE\r\n    INJUSTICE TO THE RAILWAYS AND THROUGH THEM TO THE RAILWAY\r\n    EMPLOYEES, NO FAIR MINDED MAN CAN DISPUTE. These systems grew up;\r\n    they most naturally fall into the hands best adapted to organize\r\n    and handle them, and I would be the last man in the world to claim\r\n    that, as they grew up, as they were systemized and organized, that\r\n    wrong was not done here or wrong was not done there. I know too\r\n    well that there were grievous complaints justly made against the\r\n    management of railways not only in this state, but in many others.\r\n    But I beg the people of Iowa to remember, and the railway employees\r\n    to remember that, although railway managers and railway presidents\r\n    may sometimes be unjust, that affords no excuse whatever for the\r\n    sovereign power of the state of Iowa in being unjust. The wrongs of\r\n    capital produce, it is said, the anarchist--so it is with respect\r\n    to the wrongs perpetrated by the railway companies, the railway\r\n    organizations. They created a prejudice which, in its impetus, has\r\n    carried the attack made upon the railway property far beyond what\r\n    is justified by the sober second thought and judgment of those who\r\n    instituted it, and far beyond the limits which the fair-minded\r\n    people of Iowa now justify.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the United States in express terms gives to the\r\ncongress of the United States the power to regulate commerce between\r\nthe states and with foreign nations. In pursuance of this power and\r\nduty imposed by the constitution, the congress of the United States in\r\nFebruary, 1887, enacted a statute defining the duties and obligations\r\nof common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight and\r\npassengers between the states, and by express terms gave to the people\r\na right of action in the federal courts against any railroad company\r\nviolating its duty as defined by the act. This right of action was by\r\ncivil suit for such damages as inured to the party by reason of a\r\nwrongful act of a common carrier.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago & Northwestern Railroad Company had a main line of road\r\nextending from Chicago, in the state of Illinois, located through the\r\nstate of Iowa to Council Bluffs on the Missouri river. From the main\r\nline of this road at Carroll, in Carroll county, this company had\r\nconstructed a number of branches running northwest from that point,\r\nknown as the Sac City Branch and the Sioux City and Mapleton Branch.\r\nDuring the year 1890 we brought a number of suits against the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern Railroad Company for unjust discrimination and overcharge\r\nfor shipments of corn and oats from various points on these branch\r\nroads to Chicago, and also a number of suits for shipments made at\r\nCarroll and points west on the main line of its road. The cases for\r\nshipments on the branch lines of its road were settled by the company,\r\nand we collected for our clients about $75,000. Suits for shipments on\r\nthe main line of its road were contested by the railroad company. We\r\ntried two of these cases before the United States circuit court at Des\r\nMoines, Judge Shiras presiding, and obtained verdicts and judgments in\r\nthe causes. The railroad company took a writ of error to the United\r\nStates court of appeals, and these causes were submitted to that court\r\nupon both oral and printed arguments at the May term, 1892, of that\r\ncourt, sitting at St. Louis, Missouri. After the causes had been so\r\nsubmitted, Judge N. M. Hubbard who had made the argument in behalf of\r\nthe railroad company, left St. Louis and went to Chicago for\r\nconsultation with the general solicitor of that road, Mr. Goudy. After\r\na few days, the court of appeals still being in session at St. Louis,\r\nJudge Hubbard appeared before the court, without any notice to me, and\r\nhad the order submitting the causes set aside and dismissed his appeal\r\nor writ of error. After a few weeks had elapsed he sued out another\r\nwrit of error in the same cases to the United States court of appeals,\r\nwhich, according to the arrangements for the sitting of that court,\r\nwould be held at St. Paul in the state of Minnesota, and Justice Brewer\r\nof the supreme court of the United States would be in attendance as the\r\npresiding judge of that court.\r\n\r\nIt would be too long and too tedious a story to enter into particulars\r\nin regard to these suits, and the questions of fact and law involved in\r\nthem. The unusual and unwarranted conduct of the attorneys for the\r\nNorthwestern road in getting these cases before Justice Brewer for his\r\ndecision and determination was by no means a compliment to the judge\r\nfor whom they manifested such a strong partiality. Neither would I\r\nindulge in any surmise as to the grounds for their partiality. It is\r\nsufficient to say they were not disappointed in the result and that\r\nJudge Brewer reversed both of these judgments.\r\n\r\nI afterward determined if possible to obtain the opinion of the supreme\r\ncourt of the United States upon the questions of law involved in these\r\ncases. I accordingly brought another suit for another client; to-wit,\r\none E. M. Parsons, in a case involving an amount sufficient to entitle\r\nme to an appeal directly to the supreme court of the United States,\r\nhaving previously attempted to get the supreme court of the United\r\nStates to review the decision of Justice Brewer in the former cases\r\nupon writs of certiorari, the same being denied by the supreme court.\r\nJudge Shiras, presiding in the circuit court at Des Moines, in view of\r\nthe action of the circuit court of appeals in the other cases,\r\nsustained a demurrer pro forma to my amended petition filed in the\r\nParsons case, and it was upon demurrer admitting the averments and\r\nallegations in this petition that the case was heard before the supreme\r\ncourt of the United States. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion in the\r\nParsons case in which he held that the statements of the petition did\r\nnot entitle the plaintiff to recovery. The opinion discloses the fact\r\nthat Judge Brewer was somewhat offended at my attempt to have the\r\nsupreme court pass upon the questions of law involved in the cases that\r\nhe had disposed of as the presiding judge in the court or appeals. I\r\nhad supposed that a judge of the supreme court of the United States\r\nwould regard it rather as a compliment than otherwise to his sense of\r\nfairness to believe that he was capable of impartially and without\r\nprejudice, sitting with his brother judges, to review one of his own\r\ndecisions, but the opinion shows plainly that I overestimated that\r\ndistinguished jurist, and that he thought more of his infallibility\r\nthan I did of his impartiality. This opinion of the court will be found\r\nin the case of Parsons vs. The Chicago & Northwestern Railroad Company\r\nin volume 167, _United States Reports_, 324. The court in this\r\nopinion asserts the very extraordinary position that the Interstate\r\nCommerce Law in providing a remedy whereby a shipper of grain might\r\nrecover his actual damages for a refusal of the railroad company to\r\ncomply with the law which was enacted for his protection, was in the\r\nnature of a penal statute, and that the petition of the plaintiff in\r\nsuch a case must expressly aver and negative the existence of any\r\npossible excuse for the wrong committed by the railroad company.\r\n\r\nOne great benefit to the public of these suits against the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern Railroad Company was to arouse public attention to the\r\nnecessity of further legislation by congress in order to carry out the\r\ndesign of the original act for the protection of the public. Congress\r\nhad already by amendment to the act provided for penalties against any\r\nparties violating its provisions, but the suits that I brought were\r\nsimply for actual damages and injuries, and not for any penalty\r\nwhatever under the law. The penal clause in the act as amended March 2,\r\n1889, reads as follows: \"That any common carrier subject to the\r\nprovisions of this act, or, wherever such common carrier is a\r\ncorporation, any director or other officer thereof, or any receiver,\r\ntrustee, lessee, agent, or person, acting for or employed by such\r\ncorporation, who, alone or with any other corporation, company, person,\r\nor party, shall willfully do or cause to be done, or shall willfully\r\nsuffer or permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this act\r\nprohibited or declared to be unlawful, or who shall aid or abet\r\ntherein, or shall willfully omit or fail to do any act, matter, or\r\nthing in this act required to be done, or shall cause or willfully\r\nsuffer or permit any act, matter or thing so directed or required by\r\nthis act to be done not to be so done, or shall aid or abet in such\r\nomission or failure, or shall be guilty of any infraction of this act,\r\nor shall aid or abet therein, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,\r\nand shall, upon conviction thereof in any district court of the United\r\nStates within the jurisdiction of which such offense was committed, be\r\nsubject to a fine of not to exceed five thousand dollars for each\r\noffense: Provided, that if the offense for which any person shall be\r\nconvicted as aforesaid shall be an unlawful discrimination in rates,\r\nfares, charges, for transportation of passengers or property, such\r\nperson shall, in addition to the fine herein provided for, be liable to\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of not exceeding two years,\r\nor both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"\r\nThe charge of Judge Shiras to the jury in the two cases tried before\r\nthe United States circuit court, before referred to, will be found in\r\nfull in volume 48 of the _Federal Reporter_, commencing on page 50,\r\nand the opinion of Justice Brewer, presiding in the circuit court of\r\nappeals, before referred to, in which he reverses these judgments,\r\nwill be found in the 10 U.S. court of appeals on page 430.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to any law student and to anyone who desires to\r\ndetermine where right and justice should have prevailed, to compare the\r\ncharge of Judge Shiras to the jury and the principles of law recognized\r\nby Judge Shiras, with the opinion of Justice Brewer. It is not within\r\nmy purpose to re-argue any of my causes in this paper.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to say that the supreme court held the provisions of\r\nthe inter-state commerce law, that gave to shippers a remedy for unjust\r\ndiscrimination by a civil suit for damages, to be a penal statute upon\r\nthe ground that if the railroad company discriminated by charging one\r\nperson ten dollars for a particular service and charged another person\r\ntwenty dollars for a like service, then a suit to recover back the ten\r\ndollars thus unjustly demanded and received by the railroad company was\r\nin the nature of a statute to recover a penalty. Upon this mode of\r\nreasoning a suit against any person or corporation who unjustly and\r\nunlawfully gets possession of my money, for the purpose of recovering\r\nback what they illegally obtained, would come under the head of a suit\r\nto recover a penalty. The trouble with the supreme court of the United\r\nStates has been that they have uniformly regarded this legislation by\r\ncongress to protect the people against unjust charges and\r\ndiscriminations as intended to punish the railroad companies of the\r\ncountry, and the court has felt called upon to protect the railroads\r\nfrom legislation interfering with their absolute control over their\r\nfreight and passenger traffic. The court has assumed the role of a\r\nconservative element in the government, intended for the protection of\r\nrailroad property against the legislative power of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDES MOINES RIVER LAND TITLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next important litigation in which I was engaged during my\r\nprofessional career, of public interest, was my engagement by Roswell\r\nS. Burrows, one of the original stockholders of the Des Moines\r\nNavigation Company, in suits growing out of his ownership of certain\r\nlands belonging to the Des Moines river grants, so-called. I will not\r\nundertake in this paper to go into a detailed history of the Des\r\nMoines river titles, so-called. Colonel C. H. Gatch some years ago\r\nprepared for publication a series of articles that were published in\r\nthe _Annals of Iowa_, Volume I, that gives a detailed account and\r\nhistory of the land grant by congress, and the various decisions of\r\nthe United States land department construing the original grant of\r\n1846, and also the decision of the supreme court of the United States\r\nin the numerous cases from time to time decided by that court. I deem\r\nthis the most correct and just account of this important litigation\r\nthat has ever been given to the public. Honorable B. F. Gue also\r\npublished in his _History of Iowa_ what purports to be an account of\r\nthe various decisions and rulings of the land department and of the\r\nactions of the courts with reference to these lands. A part of his\r\nhistory is correct, but in treating of the rights of certain of the\r\nsettlers he has done great injustice to the stockholders of the Des\r\nMoines Navigation Company who furnished the money to the company for\r\nthe purchase of these lands. The first unwarranted statement contained\r\nin Mr. Gue's history is that persons who brought and maintained suits\r\nfor possession of their lands against certain settlers were mere\r\nspeculators who had bought a doubtful title to these lands for a song.\r\nThe contract between the state of Iowa and the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany, whereby that company became interested in certain lands of\r\nthis grant, was made in 1853, after the state had disposed of the\r\nlarger part of the lands lying below the Raccoon fork of the Des\r\nMoines river, and was made at a time when there was no question as to\r\nthe right of the state to the lands above the Raccoon fork to the\r\nnorthern boundary of the state. Under this contract the company paid\r\nto the state, upon the execution of the agreement, over $60,000 in\r\ncash for the purpose of enabling the state to pay the indebtedness\r\nthat had been incurred by the board of public works up to that time.\r\nThe contract provided that the company should continue the work under\r\nsupervision of a state engineer and commissioner, chosen by the state\r\nof Iowa, and should advance the money to pay, as the work progressed,\r\na specific amount per cubic foot for stone work, excavation, timbers,\r\nand other material furnished in the construction of the locks and\r\ndams. Estimates were to be made from time to time by the engineer of\r\nthe work of the amount expended by the company at the prices named in\r\nthe contract, and as fast as $30,000 was so expended the company was\r\nto receive lands at $1.25 per acre. At the time this contract was made\r\nit had been found impossible to sell and dispose of the lands by the\r\nstate commissioners rapidly enough to get money to pay the contractors\r\nwho theretofore had been doing the work under contracts with the\r\ncommissioners. The only difference between the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany and the contractors engaged in this work was that the former\r\nnow agreed to furnish money in advance to pay off the old unpaid\r\nobligations of the commissioners, and agreed to advance money as it\r\nwas needed and take the lands in gross at $1.25 per acre as fast as\r\neach additional $30,000 were advanced and expended on the work. In the\r\nsummer of 1857 the company made a demand on Mr. Manning, commissioner\r\nof the Des Moines River Improvement, to certify to them additional\r\nlands on certain estimates made by the engineer, which Mr. Manning\r\nrefused. They accordingly brought suit against the commissioner asking\r\nof the court a writ of mandamus to compel him to certify the lands\r\nshown to be due them by the certificate of the engineer. I have\r\nalready referred to this suit in the former part of this paper. I was\r\nemployed by Mr. Manning and defended against it upon the ground\r\nchiefly that before the company could maintain suit for specific\r\nperformance it was necessary for them to show that they had in all\r\nrespects complied with their various contract obligations toward the\r\nstate. The main provision of the contract that the commissioner\r\nclaimed had not been complied with related to the progress of the\r\nwork; that is to say, one-fourth of the entire contemplated\r\nimprovement between the Raccoon fork of the Des Moines river and the\r\nMississippi river had not been completed. The company, being defeated\r\nin this application for mandamus, ceased work upon the improvement,\r\nand in the winter of 1858 a settlement was made between the state and\r\nthe company. This settlement was more especially brought about by\r\nthose who had organized a railroad company for the purpose of building\r\na railroad from Keokuk up the valley of the Des Moines river. This\r\norganization was known as the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota\r\nRailroad Company, and they desired a grant from the state of the\r\nremaining lands of the grant to aid them in the construction of their\r\nrailroad. The basis of the settlement between the state and the Des\r\nMoines Navigation Company was simply that the company should receive a\r\nconveyance from the state for the lands that had been certified to the\r\nstate under the grant up to that time, and that had not been\r\nheretofore disposed of by the state, or certified to the company,\r\namounting to about 37,500 acres, and should pay to the state $20,000\r\nin addition to the money already paid and expended on the improvement,\r\nand should surrender and cancel their contract and right to any\r\nfurther lands of the grant. (The terms of this settlement are\r\ncontained in a joint resolution of the seventh general assembly, found\r\non page 425 of the acts of that session.) At the time of this\r\nsettlement there was no question by anyone as to the extent of the\r\ngrant and the validity of the title of the state to the alternate\r\nsections five miles on either side of the river up to the northern\r\nboundary of the state.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the settlement proposed by the joint resolution which\r\nwas accepted by the company, Governor Lowe on May 3, 1858, executed\r\nfourteen deeds or patents to the Navigation Company, conveying by\r\nparticular description the lands to which the company was entitled\r\nunder the resolution of compromise; and on May 18, 1858, a general deed\r\nconveying the same and any previously omitted lands by general\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAnother disturbing element in regard to the title to the lands arose\r\nunder the grant of congress made in 1856 to the state of Iowa, to aid\r\nin the construction of certain lines of railroad crossing the state and\r\nhaving their initial point at the Mississippi river, and crossing the\r\nDes Moines river at various points between the Raccoon fork and the\r\nnorthern boundary of the state. These railroad companies raised the\r\nquestion as to the validity of the title of the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany to the lands they had purchased from the state north of the\r\nRaccoon fork of the river. The Dubuque & Sioux City Railroad Company\r\nbrought suit, or rather induced Litchfield to bring suit against them\r\nfor lands lying within the line of their grant under act of 1856, or\r\nrather that would have been within their grant if not reserved from its\r\noperation or that had not been granted for the improvement of the Des\r\nMoines river. This suit was adroitly managed on the part of the\r\nrailroad company so as to avoid testing any question of its title, and\r\ncontained a stipulation that the company was in possession of the land\r\nunder their grant and the court was only called upon to decide the\r\nextent of the grant under the act of 1846 to the state for the\r\nimprovement of the river, and the supreme court of the United States\r\ndecided that the act of 1846 did not grant to the state for the\r\nimprovement of the river any lands north of the Raccoon fork. This\r\ndecision was made at the December term, 1859, and is found reported in\r\n23 Howard, S.C.U.S., page 66. The act of 1856, making the grant to the\r\nstate for the purpose of aiding in the construction of these railroads,\r\nin express terms reserved from the operation of the grant any lands\r\nthat had been theretofore reserved by any competent authority under any\r\nother grant of congress. The announcement of this decision created\r\nconsiderable excitement in the Des Moines valley, and the river lands\r\nabove the Raccoon fork that had theretofore been deeded by the state to\r\nthe Des Moines Navigation Company and had been by that company divided\r\namong its stockholders in consideration of the moneys that they had\r\nadvanced to the company, and had been paid by the company to the state\r\nas before stated, were considered the lawful prey of every adventurer\r\nwho could induce the local land offices to allow them to locate a land\r\nwarrant upon any of these lands.\r\n\r\nAnother class of persons, however, were deeply interested in the\r\nquestion of this title. Prior to the contract made with the Des Moines\r\nNavigation Company the state of Iowa had sold some fifty thousand acres\r\nor more of these lands located above the Raccoon fork of the river, and\r\nmany of these lands were occupied by actual settlers who had made\r\nimprovements thereon and had paid the state valuable considerations for\r\ntheir title. To avoid the hardships that must otherwise have resulted\r\nfrom the decision of the supreme court, congress on March 2, 1861,\r\npassed the following joint resolution: \"Resolved, that all the title\r\nwhich the United States still retain in the tracts of land along the\r\nDes Moines river, above the mouth of the Raccoon fork thereof, which\r\nhave been certified to said state improperly by the department of the\r\ninterior as a part of the grant by act of congress approved August 8,\r\n1846, and which are now held by bona fide purchasers under the state of\r\nIowa, be, and the same is hereby relinquished to the state of Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nThe congress of the United States further on the 12th of July, 1862,\r\npassed an act in express terms extending the grant to the northern\r\nboundary of the state, and providing that such lands \"be held and\r\napplied in accordance with the provisions of the original grant, except\r\nthat the consent of congress is hereby given to the application of a\r\nportion thereof to aid in the construction of the Keokuk, Fort Des\r\nMoines & Minnesota Railroad, in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nact of the general assembly of the state of Iowa, approved March 22,\r\n1858.\"\r\n\r\nAt the December term, 1866, the supreme court of the United States, in\r\nthe case of Samuel Wolcott vs. The Des Moines Navigation Company,\r\nreported in 5 Wallace, page 681, made a further decision confirming the\r\ntitle of the Des Moines Navigation Company under the acts of congress\r\nof 1861-2, to the lands that had been deeded to them by the state of\r\nIowa as before recited, and further deciding that the lands within the\r\nfive mile limits of the Des Moines river had been reserved by competent\r\nauthority for this work of internal improvement at the time of the\r\npassage of the railroad grant of 1856.\r\n\r\nMr. Gue in his history of Iowa unfortunately attempts to disparage the\r\ntitle of the stockholders of the Des Moines Navigation Company by\r\nstating they were mere speculators who had purchased an impaired title,\r\nand were therefore entitled to no consideration. On the contrary, the\r\nmen who received these deeds directly from the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany were stockholders who had advanced their money in payment of\r\ntheir stock, which money had been paid over by that company directly to\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nSoon after the decision of the supreme court in the Litchfield case in\r\n1859, a suit was brought in the circuit court of the United States for\r\nthe southern district of Iowa, asking an injunction against the local\r\nUnited States land officers at Fort Dodge and at Des Moines, to prevent\r\nthem from receiving and recognizing any location or purchase of these\r\nreserved lands. The reservation of the land affected not only the lands\r\nwithin the railroad grant, but affected the right of any person to\r\nlocate upon or purchase these lands from the United States, as they\r\nwere not lands subject to settlement or entry. Justice Miller heard\r\nthis application for an injunction, and an argument was filed by the\r\nauthorities in Washington claiming that the proper officers of the land\r\ndepartment had the sole authority to determine the question as to\r\nwhether or not these lands were subject to location and entry, and that\r\nthe question of the effect of such location and entry could only be\r\ndecided by the courts, after entries were made and patents granted;\r\nthat if the lands were not legally subject to entry as to any person\r\nclaiming them, the action of the land officers would be void, and a\r\ncourt, if called upon by the owner, could cancel any patent or other\r\nevidence of title illegally issued. Justice Miller, after the full\r\nargument of the case, sustained this view of the case and held that the\r\nonly remedy for parties claiming these lands under the act of 1846, and\r\nthe subsequent act of 1861-2, was to apply to the court for the\r\ncancellation of any titles wrongfully issued by the land department or\r\nby the President. In accordance with this view of the case a number of\r\nsuits were brought by the grantees of the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany, who received their titles from the company in consideration of\r\nthe moneys they had advanced as stockholders, and the supreme court of\r\nthe United States, upon appeal to that court, cancelled a number of\r\nentries and patents that had been wrongfully issued. An attempt was\r\nmade to make a distinction between the Des Moines Navigation Company\r\nand individuals who had purchased the lands from the state of Iowa, and\r\nsettled thereon.\r\n\r\nMr. Gue in his history of Iowa claims that the act of congress of 1861\r\nwas only intended for the protection of those purchasers from the state\r\nwho had actually settled upon their lands and made improvements\r\nthereon, and that congress in using the words \"bona fide purchasers\r\nfrom the state of Iowa\" did not include in those words citizens or\r\nresidents of the state of New York who had bought their lands in good\r\nfaith from the state of Iowa. The supreme court of the United States in\r\nthe very purpose of its organization was intended by the constitution\r\nto organize a judicial body or tribunal before which all citizens of\r\nthe United States should be equal before the law, without regard to the\r\nstate in which they had their residence or location. There was no\r\nquestion about the fact that the Des Moines Navigation Company was a\r\nbona fide purchaser of these lands. At the time that they paid their\r\nmoney and took a conveyance from the state of Iowa, the stockholders of\r\nthat company honestly believed they were getting a good and perfect\r\ntitle and were paying out their money for same in the utmost good\r\nfaith. The statement of Mr. Gue in his history before referred to, that\r\nthe persons who received deeds for these lands from the Des Moines\r\nNavigation Company were mere speculators, purchasing for a song a\r\ndoubtful and disputed title, is wholly without foundation and fact, and\r\nthe denunciation of the supreme court of the United States because the\r\ncourt made no distinction between bona fide purchasers because of their\r\nlocation or residence, very greatly mars the reliability and\r\nimpartiality that ought to have been characteristic of this history of\r\nIowa. Mr. Gue was a resident of Fort Dodge, where for years the\r\natmosphere of that locality was permeated by the passion of men who had\r\nbeen disappointed in their attempt to secure a title to lands that they\r\nall knew before and at the time of the location and attempted entry on\r\nthe same, had already been sold for a valuable consideration by the\r\nstate of Iowa. The opinion of the supreme court, delivered by Justice\r\nMiller in the case of Williams vs. Baker, reported in 17 Wallace, 144,\r\ncontains an accurate and clear exposition of this entire controversy,\r\nwhich fortunately was settled by the supreme court of the United\r\nStates, and to which they have continuously and consistently adhered.\r\nLong after the diversion of the remaining lands of this grant to the\r\nKeokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad Company, the Iowa\r\nHomestead Company, grantee of the Dubuque & Sioux City Railroad Company\r\nbrought suit for a portion of these lands embraced in the river grant\r\nabove the Raccoon fork, and attempted to disturb the title. In the\r\nmeantime the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad Company had\r\nmortgaged these lands for the purpose of continuing their road from Des\r\nMoines to Fort Dodge. On the foreclosure of this mortgage these\r\nremaining lands were sold to a company known as the Des Moines & Fort\r\nDodge Railroad Company, organized for the purpose of owning and\r\noperating that portion of the old Des Moines Valley road that had been\r\nconstructed between Des Moines and Fort Dodge. On the foreclosure of\r\nthis mortgage I had represented Martin Flynn and a number of the other\r\ncontractors, for whom I had filed a mechanics' lien for work done and\r\nmaterial furnished in the construction of the road north of Gowrie. I\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a provision in the decree of foreclosure making\r\nthese liens paramount to that of the mortgage, and when the road was\r\npurchased by the new organization called the Des Moines & Fort Dodge\r\nRailroad Company they were compelled to pay off Flynn and these other\r\nlien holders in order to secure their title. This new railroad\r\norganization elected Mr. Charles Whitehead, an attorney of New York\r\nCity, its president, and I received from Mr. Whitehead a telegram\r\nasking if I could be retained as general attorney of their road. I\r\nreplied that upon the receipt of a draft for five hundred dollars I\r\nwould accept of the same as a general retainer. One object, I think,\r\nthat the company had in desiring my services was to secure some one\r\nfamiliar with the question of the title of these Des Moines river lands\r\nthat the new organization had bought in connection with this other part\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\nThe last contest over the title was the case of the Iowa Homestead\r\nCompany claiming the title under the railroad grant of 1856. It was the\r\ncase of the Iowa Homestead vs. The Des Moines & Fort Dodge Railroad\r\nCompany, reported in 17 Wallace, 84. Mr. Gue, in his history of Iowa,\r\nmakes a special point as to the hardship visited on one of the settlers\r\nby the name of Crilley. I was attorney for Mr. Burrows in that case.\r\nMr. Crilley first attempted to locate a warrant upon a tract of land\r\nnear Fort Dodge prior to the decision of the supreme court of the\r\nUnited States in the Striker case. He was refused permission to make\r\nany such location or entry and was distinctly informed by the local\r\nland officers that the lands belonged to the Des Moines river grant.\r\nAfter the decision in the Striker case in 1859 and after the settlement\r\nbetween the state of Iowa and the Des Moines Navigation Company and the\r\npayment of the last $20,000 of the consideration, and after the\r\nexecution of the deeds and patents by the state to the Des Moines\r\nNavigation Company, Crilley succeeded in inducing the local land\r\nofficers to allow his location, and ultimately obtained a patent\r\nthrough their influence, signed by the President. The circuit court of\r\nthe United States declared his patent void and decreed cancellation of\r\nthe same. He took his appeal to the supreme court at Washington and\r\nthat court affirmed the decree. The judges of the circuit court at Des\r\nMoines permitted Mr. Crilley, by his attorney, then to file a claim for\r\nhis improvements under the occupying claimant law of Iowa.\r\nCommissioners were appointed and his improvements were valued at a very\r\nliberal amount, far in excess of their real value or cost. Mr. Burrows\r\npaid the money into court and Crilley received the same, but after he\r\nreceived pay for his improvements he still refused to vacate the land.\r\nA writ was issued to dispossess him, and upon the service of the writ\r\nby the United States marshal, Mr. Crilley presented a loaded revolver\r\nto the deputy marshal and threatened his life. The marshal thereupon\r\nreturned to Des Moines and secured authority to arrest Mr. Crilley,\r\nwhich he did, and Mr. Crilley was actually detained in prison for\r\nseveral weeks and until he agreed peaceably to surrender possession of\r\nthe land. This is the whole story of the inhumanity out of which Mr.\r\nGue's history of Iowa makes a case of such extreme cruelty and\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\nThat this controversy over the title of the Des Moines river grant was\r\na most unfortunate one, both for those who purchased the lands from the\r\nstate and those who attempted to purchase them from the general\r\ngovernment after the state had sold them, there can be no question. It\r\nwas also very detrimental to the settlement of that part of the state.\r\nThe squatters or settlers made very indifferent improvements and very\r\nindifferent cultivation of the land, and seldom if ever paid any taxes.\r\nAfter the title of the Des Moines Navigation Company and its\r\nstockholders and grantees had become fully settled, the counties where\r\nthese lands were located levied taxes upon the same, and suits were\r\nbrought against the Des Moines Navigation Company and its grantees. The\r\nsupreme court of Iowa held that from the date of the joint resolution\r\nof 1861 the title to these lands inured to and became perfect in those\r\nwho had purchased and taken their deeds from the Des Moines Navigation\r\nCompany, and held them liable for the taxes that had been assessed from\r\nthe date of that joint resolution of 1861.\r\n\r\nI continued to act as attorney for the Des Moines & Fort Dodge Railroad\r\nCompany for about ten years. I was not, however, employed upon a\r\nsalary, but only after my general retainer charged that company from\r\ntime to time for services actually rendered, and charged them as I did\r\nany other client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA. O. U. W. CONTROVERSY\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other case of some notoriety and public interest in which I was\r\nengaged in the latter years of my practice was the controversy between\r\nthe two branches of the Ancient Order of United Workmen. It seems that\r\nthe Grand Lodge of this organization had adopted an amendment to their\r\nplan of organization by which in case of extraordinary loss and\r\nliability occurring in any locality, and within the jurisdiction of\r\nsome subordinate state lodge, the members of lodges in other states\r\nmight be assessed and required to contribute for the payment of such\r\nextraordinary losses. A portion of the members in the state of Iowa\r\nrefused to recognize this requisition and seceded from the organization\r\nas a national body, and organized another state lodge by the same name,\r\nAncient Order of United Workmen, and incorporated themselves under the\r\ngeneral provisions of the law of Iowa for the organization of\r\nbenevolent societies, repudiating any connection with the national\r\nlodge. Those who adhered to the national organization still continued,\r\nhowever, to do business by their old name and under their former\r\norganization as adherents of the national body. The new organization,\r\nrelying upon their incorporation as giving them some special advantage,\r\nbrought suit in the district court of Dubuque county for an injunction\r\nagainst this old organization adhering to the national body, and sought\r\nto perpetually enjoin them from the use of the name \"Ancient Order of\r\nUnited Workmen,\" or the initials \"A.O.U.W.\" Upon the trial of this\r\ncase on demurrer in the district court in Dubuque, I sought to obtain a\r\ncontinuance of the hearing on the ground of my ill health, having been\r\nconfined to my room and my bed for some three weeks. The judge of the\r\ndistrict court granted a continuance only for a few days. I went to\r\nDubuque, however, and made a three hours' argument in the case, sitting\r\nin my chair, not having strength to stand upon my feet. The court\r\ngranted a perpetual injunction against my client. An appeal was taken\r\nimmediately to the supreme court and an interlocutory order obtained\r\nstaying the injunction until the case could be heard in that court. On\r\nthe final hearing and trial the injunction was dissolved, and the right\r\nof my client to use and do business under the title of \"Ancient Order\r\nof United Workmen\" was successfully maintained. This decision is fully\r\nreported in supreme court reports, 96 Iowa, 592.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT EVENTS IN CAREER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary now to go back a few years in order to record\r\ncertain events important in my personal career.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1880 James A. Garfield received from the republican\r\nnational convention at Chicago the nomination as candidate for\r\nPresident of the United States. At that time the states of Indiana and\r\nOhio continued to hold their state elections early in the month of\r\nOctober, and the result of the elections in those two states in October\r\nhad a most important and almost controlling influence upon the result\r\nof the presidential contest at the ensuing November election.\r\n\r\nEarly in September of that year I received from the state central\r\ncommittee of the state of Indiana an invitation to accompany\r\nex-Governor Kirkwood of Iowa in a canvassing tour of two weeks, which\r\ninvitation I accepted. We had a very agreeable and enjoyable trip.\r\nGovernor Kirkwood was a very companionable man and was received with\r\nmuch honor and enthusiasm, and our meetings were largely attended and\r\nwere quite successful. Part of the time we did not speak together at\r\nthe same meetings, but had separate appointments assigned us. At one\r\npoint where there existed a considerable manufacturing industry, the\r\nlocal committee waited upon us at our hotel before the speaking, and\r\nsuggested that they desired us to especially discuss the tariff\r\nquestion and its effect upon our American manufacturers. After the\r\ncommittee had retired Governor Kirkwood walked the floor of the room\r\nfor a few minutes, and turning suddenly upon me he said, \"Charlie, do\r\nyou understand this tariff question?\" I told him no, I knew very little\r\nabout it. \"Well,\" he said, \"I was raised a democrat and am not much of\r\na tariff man anyhow, and I want you to take up this tariff question if\r\neither of us must.\" I told him that I could talk about the general\r\neffect of protecting American labor and the duty of the American\r\ncongress to so arrange the tariff upon imports as to relieve our people\r\nfrom competition with the low wages paid in Europe; that the American\r\nlaborer must receive higher wages than the European laborer for he must\r\neducate his children and must enjoy better conditions in life, and as\r\nour free institutions were based upon the intelligence of the voter, we\r\ncould not afford to allow the laboring man to occupy the position\r\nsocially or politically of the European laborer; that I could talk\r\nalong that line all they wanted, but when it came to discussing\r\nschedules or specific duties I should not venture upon any such\r\ndiscourse; in fact, I was satisfied that few people understood the\r\nsubject sufficiently to discuss the detail of tariff duties with\r\nintelligence. I filled the bill accordingly, as Governor Kirkwood\r\nplaced that part of the program in my charge, but he himself did not\r\nsay \"tariff\" once.\r\n\r\nAt Indianapolis we attended a grand rally at which Roscoe Conkling, of\r\nNew York, was the principal orator of the day. The managers had\r\narranged for a grand parade, and the Governor with myself and several\r\nother gentlemen were assigned to a carriage that was to take prominent\r\npart in the procession. Conkling had arrived, it seems, early in the\r\nday, and the procession was delayed for over an hour waiting for that\r\ndistinguished gentleman to complete his toilet before making his\r\nappearance in public. The streets and the balcony of the hotel were\r\nlined with ladies in their holiday attire, and as the procession passed\r\nby we heard frequent inquiries from the finely dressed maidens as to\r\nwhich was Conkling, and when he was pointed out to them they were\r\nenthusiastic in their declarations that he was a handsome man. I was\r\nintroduced to Mr. Conkling in the corridor of the hotel, after his\r\nspeech, and was shocked and surprised at his want of courtesy and\r\ndecent manners. He was there for the purpose of advocating the election\r\nof Mr. Garfield, and adding if possible enthusiasm to the occasion, and\r\nyet openly in the hearing of the crowd he was cursing the folly of the\r\nconvention in nominating Mr. Garfield instead of renominating Grant for\r\nthe third term. A more arrogant and conceited public man it has never\r\nbeen my misfortune to meet.\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred the following Sunday morning more pleasant to\r\nrecord. I got up very early, and going down to the lower portico of the\r\nhotel I found a few persons astir. I felt somewhat lonesome and seeing\r\na well dressed, intelligent looking colored man on the pavement, I\r\nentered into conversation with him in regard to the political\r\nsituation, and asked him whether or not the colored men of the city\r\nwould not all support Mr. Garfield, the republican nominee. To my\r\nsurprise he said, \"No, sah, some of them will vote the democratic\r\nticket.\" I said to him, \"How is it possible for a colored man to\r\nsupport the democratic ticket in view of the history of the past\r\ntwenty-five years? The colored race have been emancipated and\r\nenfranchised and made equal before the law through the efforts of the\r\nrepublican party of the nation. How, then, can any of your people\r\nsupport the democratic party?\" \"Well, sah,\" said he, \"in some respects\r\na colored man is very much like a white man.\" Said I, \"What do you mean\r\nby that?\" \"Well, sah,\" said he, \"I'll tell you. Occasionally, sah, you\r\nwill find a colored man that is a damn fool.\" I saw a twinkle in his\r\neye and realized that he was intending his reply for a joke. I\r\nimmediately offered him my hand and shook hands with him heartily,\r\ntelling him that since there were so many white men of that kind I\r\nsupposed it would be unreasonable not to expect occasionally a colored\r\nman that was a fool.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Iowa after the October election in Indiana I made a\r\nspeech in the opera house at Oskaloosa, Iowa, and the gallery was\r\nfilled with colored men, many of them from What Cheer, a mining\r\ndistrict near Oskaloosa. I related to them the particulars of my\r\ninterview with the colored gentleman of Indianapolis. They enjoyed it\r\nhugely and gave me rounds of applause, and I told them I hoped that in\r\nsome respects they would not be like the few that were back in Indiana.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of Mr. Garfield, Governor Kirkwood was appointed\r\nSecretary of the Interior, and as I had official business before the\r\nsupreme court that summer I visited Washington City in company with my\r\nwife, and spent a pleasant two weeks admiring the wonders of the\r\nnational capital. Bishop Andrews, of the Methodist Episcopal church,\r\nhad been for a number of years a resident of Des Moines and our near\r\nneighbor on Fourth street, and in company with his excellent wife Mrs.\r\nNourse had a very enjoyable time. Governor Kirkwood also arranged that\r\nwe should attend a private reception of the President and his wife, and\r\nMrs. Nourse enjoyed the privilege of quite a tete a tete with the\r\nPresident's lady, officially known as the first lady of the land. When\r\nmy wife bid her good evening she shook hands with her and expressed the\r\nhope that she would be very happy in her new position. Mrs. Garfield\r\nwas rather a sad faced person and responded in a tone almost prophetic,\r\n\"I hope so. We do not know.\" Afterwards upon the assassination of Mr.\r\nGarfield I was called upon to take part in a meeting held in the\r\nBaptist church in Des Moines, commemorating the memory of that\r\nexcellent man. I found in my wife's scrap book some years afterwards a\r\nnewspaper clipping containing a report of the remarks I made on that\r\noccasion which I here insert:\r\n\r\n    For the past five days our nation has been in mourning and the\r\n    Christian civilization of the world has sympathized with us in our\r\n    bereavement. By official proclamations, by public meetings and\r\n    resolutions, by draping our homes and places of business and houses\r\n    of worship with the emblems of mourning, we have sought to give\r\n    expression to our sorrow and to testify our appreciation of our\r\n    noble dead.\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow the whole nation is to attend upon his burial and the day\r\n    is set apart as sacred to his memory. And yet with all this we\r\n    cannot restore the life that has been so wantonly destroyed. Death\r\n    is inexorable, and we can do nothing for him who has gone out from\r\n    the shores of time forever.\r\n\r\nBut in a better sense of the word Garfield is not dead. So long as we\r\ncherish the manly virtues of which his life was the exponent, so long\r\nas we remember the trials and sacrifices of his boyhood, the labors and\r\nsuccesses of his riper years, the heroism, faith, fidelity of his life,\r\nand the calm triumphant heroism of his death, so long will he live to\r\nus and to the nation, and so long may we be profited by his life.\r\n\r\nI can think of no better text this morning for profitable consideration\r\nthan one of the many rich gems of thought he has left us out of the\r\nstorehouse of this great heart and intellect. At the graves of the\r\nfallen heroes of the late war he expressed this sentiment, \"I love to\r\nbelieve that no heroic sacrifice is ever lost, that the characters of\r\nmen are molded and inspired by what their fathers have done, that\r\ntreasured up in American souls are all the unconscious influences of\r\nthe great deeds of the Anglo Saxon race, from Agincourt to Bunker\r\nHill.\"\r\n\r\nIn the oldest book of the Book of Books the patient man in his deep\r\naffliction asks the question, \"If a man dies shall he live again?\" This\r\nquestion refers primarily to man's immortality, but we may dwell upon\r\nit in its other meaning, this morning, as relating to the silent and\r\nunconscious power and influence of the life and example of the one whom\r\nwe say is dead.\r\n\r\nAnd think what a treasure we have in the memory of this man. Others\r\nhave challenged the admiration of the world because of their great\r\nabilities. Others have been brave in war and wise in counsel. Others\r\nhave been heroes and statesmen, and we have honored them and done\r\nhomage to their greatness, but this man was not only great and wise and\r\nbrave, but a good, true and pure man also, and the nation loved him. We\r\ngive honor to his greatness, we give the tribute of praise to his great\r\nabilities and his great achievements, but we bring tears and heart\r\nthrobs to the tomb where manly virtue, purity, and faith are to be\r\nenshrined. How much there is in the life of this man that we would wish\r\nto bring into the everyday life of our homes. Here is the model of a\r\nlife from which we would have our children mold their own future, no\r\nblemishes to record, nothing to apologize for, nothing to cover up--it\r\nstands out in its moral perfection and beauty--in its intellectual\r\nstrength and greatness--in its religious faith and fervor, a fully\r\ndeveloped manhood--a complete character--a perfect pattern.\r\n\r\nDo you want an inspiration for your child? Repeat to him the story of\r\nthis man's youth, of his struggle with poverty and adversity, without\r\ninfluential friends or fortune. Do you want to teach the young men of\r\nthe nation the value of sincerity, honesty, earnestness, and\r\ntruthfulness in the affairs of life? Here is the demonstration and the\r\nproof that even in American politics and American statesmanship,\r\ndishonesty, deceit, and duplicity are not necessary to success. Do you\r\nwant to rebuke the conceit of the would-be learned who teach our young\r\nmen that the religious faith that their mothers taught them is somehow\r\na reproach to their intellectual progress--we have here a man of the\r\nbroadest culture, of the strongest intellectual grasp and development,\r\nwhose religious faith was the very basis and strength of his greatness\r\nand intellectual power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN IMPEACHMENT CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of law cases and the questions of fact and of law that\r\nthey involved may be a little tedious to a non-professional reader, but\r\nthey constituted so large a part in my life that it is impossible to\r\ngive much of an account of myself and what I have been doing for so\r\nmany years past, without at least a brief account of the nature of the\r\nsuits in which I was engaged as counsel.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important case in which I was engaged during my\r\nprofessional career was the celebrated impeachment case against John L.\r\nBrown, Auditor of the state of Iowa.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was first elected to the office of Auditor of State in\r\nOctober, 1882, and took his office the following January. One of the\r\nimportant duties of this office was the duty of having the insurance\r\ncompanies, organized under the laws of Iowa and doing business in the\r\nstate, examined from time to time to ascertain if they complied\r\nstrictly with the law, and if their reports made to his office were\r\njust and true, and their business conducted in such a manner as to\r\ninsure their solvency and ability to pay the losses of their policy\r\nholders. There had been in the state of Iowa for a number of years a\r\nnumber of failures of companies that were organized without capital and\r\nwithout experience or strict integrity upon the part of those who\r\nsought to insure the property of others, some of them having none of\r\ntheir own. I remember one insurance company organized in Des Moines by\r\nan enterprising young lawyer, without means, who obtained the names of\r\na number of persons that he claimed had subscribed stock to his\r\ncompany. The law required twenty-five per cent of this stock to be paid\r\nup before the company was entitled to do business. The gentleman, of\r\ncourse, elected himself president of the company, and he drew his\r\ndrafts upon the supposed subscribers to stock for the twenty-five per\r\ncent that the law required should be paid up, to constitute the capital\r\nof the company. He took these drafts to B. F. Allen, then a prominent\r\nbanker in western Iowa and doing business in Des Moines, and deposited\r\nhis drafts and obtained from Allen a certificate of deposit for so much\r\nmoney. This he exhibited to the Auditor of State, and upon the faith of\r\nthis certificate of deposit obtained authority to transact business.\r\nHis drafts were all dishonored so that he was proceeding to do business\r\nwithout any capital whatever, and actually issued some policies. It was\r\nonly necessary to incur a loss to complete the bankruptcy of the\r\nconcern. Of course the foregoing is an extreme case, but it illustrates\r\nhow easily the law was evaded and how absolutely necessary it was to\r\nhave a strict supervision of these companies that could incorporate\r\nthemselves under the general insurance company laws of the state.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown had been a soldier in the Civil War and had lost an arm in\r\nits service, was very upright, and a downright man, and did not depend\r\nupon his suavity of manner for his success in life. He was a man of\r\nquick temper and abrupt manners, but was sensitive of his honor and at\r\nall times conscious of his integrity of purpose. In pursuance of his\r\nofficial duty he felt the necessity of strict supervision and a\r\nthorough examination of the insurance companies of the state, that had\r\nsprung up in almost every important town and city in the state, and the\r\nofficers and directors of the different companies were not paying much\r\nattention to the detail of the affairs of their companies and would\r\ngenerally entrust the business to the persons who had organized the\r\ncompany and become its president and secretary. In selecting a person\r\nwho could make these examinations with fidelity and thoroughness he\r\ndeemed it necessary to engage some one who was not a resident of the\r\nstate and who would not probably be influenced by local or political\r\nconsideration in the discharge of his duties. He employed as chief\r\nexaminer of these companies a gentleman who resided in Chicago, and\r\nwhose reputation was beyond question as an expert, by the name of H. S.\r\nVail. This gentleman charged for his services twenty-five dollars a day\r\nfor the time actually engaged, and in addition thereto some five to ten\r\ndollars for assistant accountants. The law provided that the expenses\r\nof these investigations should be approved by the Auditor, and upon his\r\ncertificate the several companies examined were required to pay the\r\nbill. These examinations proved to be very expensive in some cases, and\r\nperhaps in a few cases an unnecessary burden and expense to the\r\ncompanies, but the real cause of complaint was that the expert found\r\nmany irregularities, and without fear or favor, reported them in\r\nwriting to the Auditor for his action. In one case the president of an\r\ninsurance company had been electing his board of directors by stock\r\nissued to himself, upon which he had not paid a dollar into his\r\ntreasury, and was paying himself out of the limited income of the\r\ncompany the handsome sum of ten thousand dollars a year as president,\r\nand his son-in-law three thousand dollars a year as attorney of the\r\ncompany. In a number of cases the president of the company was found to\r\nhave issued to himself stock upon which he had not paid a dollar, and\r\nthe Auditor required all of these and many other like delinquencies to\r\nbe corrected.\r\n\r\nHe was visited by the friends and attorneys of these officers who were\r\nthus disturbed in their operations, and the Auditor was not found to be\r\na very complacent or accommodating individual, but on the contrary an\r\noutspoken, determined, and unyielding man in the discharge of what he\r\nconceived to be his duties. The last resource of these afflicted\r\ninsurance officers was an appeal to Buren R. Sherman, then Governor of\r\nIowa, formerly filling the office of Auditor of State and under whose\r\nadministration these insurance men had been undisturbed. He found Mr.\r\nBrown equally obdurate and unwilling to palliate or in any way overlook\r\nthe delinquencies of these insurance companies, but he determined to\r\nafford his friends some relief, and upon the re-election of Mr. Brown\r\nas Auditor of State in the fall of 1884, he sought an excuse for\r\nrefusing to approve of the official bond that Mr. Brown presented to\r\nhim and which was necessary to the qualification of the Auditor for his\r\nsecond term of office. The first pretense of Sherman for refusing to\r\napprove the Auditor's bond was that Mr. Brown had not complied with the\r\nlaw in making report to the Treasurer of State as the law required of\r\nthe fees of his office. As it turned out in the evidence on the trial,\r\nand as Sherman well knew the fact to be, the fees of the office had\r\nbeen reported and accounted for as the statute required, save only that\r\nthe aggregate amount of the fees as shown by the fee-book in the\r\nAuditor's office had been reported and accounted for at the end of each\r\nmonth, and the details specifying from what source each item was\r\nreceived was not copied from the fee-book in the Auditor's office and\r\nfiled with the State Treasurer. In addition to this the Governor also\r\nobtained information from a discharged clerk in the Auditor's office\r\nthat the clerks in the office frequently received compensation of small\r\nsums for giving information and collecting statistical matter at the\r\nrequest of individuals where no official duty was enjoined by law upon\r\nthe Auditor or his assistants and no fee was prescribed. As no account\r\nwas kept of these small sums of money and they were paid to the clerk\r\nwho did the voluntary work for persons requesting it, no statement\r\ncould be made of the amounts or dates, or the services rendered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the controversy spread, the insurance companies through\r\ntheir officers and agents taking an active part as against Mr. Brown,\r\nand Mr. Sherman becoming more and more arrogant. He finally determined\r\nto remove Mr. Brown from office.\r\n\r\nWe had upon the statute book a law whereby the Governor of the state\r\nwas authorized to suspend a subordinate officer, if indeed there was\r\nany such thing as a subordinate officer under our constitution, by\r\nappointing a commission to examine his books and papers and the affairs\r\nof his office, and if, upon making such report to the Governor, it was\r\napparent that the public safety required a suspension of the officer\r\nfrom official duties, he might issue such order of suspension. Sherman\r\nfound three men willing to do his bidding in this respect and appointed\r\nthem commissioners to examine the affairs of all the state officers.\r\nThe commissioners understood that this meant only Brown and meant only\r\nthat they should put into form Sherman's side of his controversy with\r\nthe Auditor. The committee accordingly performed what was required of\r\nthem and reported to the Governor that the public safety and public\r\ngood required the suspension of the Auditor. They reported no facts in\r\naddition to those already recited in regard to the money received by\r\nthe clerks in the office for matters outside of their official duties,\r\nsave and except fees paid by certain banks for bank examinations under\r\nthe law, for which no fee was provided by law, and which they advised\r\nthe Governor that the Attorney General claimed did not belong to the\r\nstate treasury, but were illegally charged and paid. They also informed\r\nthe Governor that in the year of 1883, the correspondence notifying the\r\nAuditor of the requirements of the insurance companies in regard to the\r\nappointment of agents had been destroyed. As all of these appointments\r\nwere matters of record and the fees for their issuing were also\r\nregularly entered upon the books of the Auditor, this was one of the\r\nextraordinary finds of this extraordinary committee. They also advised\r\nthe Governor in this report that the law required the reports of fees\r\nshould be sworn to, and their interpretation of the law was that the\r\nAuditor himself should have made the affidavit, and instead thereof it\r\nwas made by a clerk in the office.\r\n\r\nUpon this remarkable report of this remarkable commission Sherman at\r\nonce made an order, not suspending but removing Mr. Brown from office,\r\nand appointing J. W. Cattell, formerly Auditor of State, to take his\r\nplace. Mr. Cattell was in no very great haste to do this, but after the\r\norder was served by the sheriff upon Mr. Brown he very wisely entered\r\ninto a negotiation with Brown to see if the difficulty could not in\r\nsome way be adjusted, and have Brown make such reports to the Governor\r\nas would be satisfactory. Mr. Cattell was an honorable and honest man,\r\nand really desired that these matters should be satisfactorily\r\narranged, but this was not the purpose of the Governor as manifested by\r\nhis conduct, and he determined to have his own way. He accordingly\r\nfiled information before a justice of the peace accusing Brown of a\r\nmisdemeanor in holding the office after his order of suspension or\r\nremoval, and upon this affidavit he obtained a warrant for the arrest\r\nof Mr. Brown. The constable served the warrant upon Brown, and Mr.\r\nBrown was about to give bond for his appearance to answer the charge,\r\nwhen the Governor, having previously ordered and arranged with the\r\nAdjutant General so to do, appeared with an armed force of the\r\nGovernor's Guards, so-called, who, with set bayonets and loaded muskets\r\ntook charge of the Auditor's office. Hearing that something of an\r\nextraordinary nature was transpiring at the capitol, I left my office\r\nand went over to the state house to see what could be done for my\r\nclient, and was proceeding to the Auditor's office when I was stopped\r\nby two of the soldiers crossing bayonets in front of me, one of them\r\ncocking his rifle and threatening to shoot me if I proceeded any\r\nfurther. Fortunately the captain commanding the squad had a little\r\nsense left and told the soldier to put up his gun, and so my life was\r\nsaved. The Governor in addition to the use of the militia as above\r\nrecited, also employed ex-Governor William M. Stone to assist Mr.\r\nGalusha Parsons, and they filed a petition in the name of Jonathan W.\r\nCattell against John L. Brown in the district court of Polk county\r\nunder the provision of the statute for proceedings in \"quo warranto\" by\r\nwhich the right and title to an office could be tested. We were\r\nfortunate in having for district judge at that time William Connor, a\r\ngood lawyer and an honest man. Mr. Parsons and Governor Stone attempted\r\nupon the presentation of their petition to get some peremptory order\r\nfor the removal of Mr. Brown from office, but the court called their\r\nattention to the express provision of the statute that he had no\r\nauthority to make any order in the premises until the final trial, and\r\nthat the case must go upon the docket and be tried upon its merits\r\nbefore any order or removal could be made. Upon the impeachment trial\r\nSherman under oath denied that he had employed counsel to commence this\r\nsuit, and Mr. Cattell testified that he had nothing to do with the\r\nemployment of any counsel to bring the suit. The suit was finally\r\ndismissed, nobody appearing to care about any investigation of the\r\nmerits of the proceeding. We accordingly had Mr. Brown, who had given\r\nbail, surrender himself to his bondsmen, and we applied to the supreme\r\ncourt of the state, then sitting at Davenport, for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus to test the constitutionality of the statute under which,\r\nwithout trial and without investigation and without hearing, the\r\nGovernor had attempted to deprive Mr. Brown of his office. The supreme\r\ncourt decided this case at the Dubuque term in 1885, Seevers, judge,\r\ndelivering a dissenting opinion, and Beck, judge, taking no part in the\r\ndecision as he was not present at the submission of the cause. Adams,\r\njudge, delivered the opinion of the three remaining judges; to-wit,\r\nhimself, Rothrock, and Reed. The majority of the court held that the\r\nlaw under which the Governor acted did not authorize any removal from\r\noffice, and that it was only constitutional upon the hypothesis that\r\nBrown should have a hearing and trial. The dissenting opinion of Judge\r\nSeevers holds that as the law made no provision for any hearing or\r\ntrial, and the suspension was for an indefinite time and might at the\r\npleasure of the Governor be perpetual, it was therefore void and did\r\nnot authorize the proceedings. Thus matters stood until the fall of the\r\nyear 1885, when the people elected William Larrabee as Governor instead\r\nof Sherman, whose term of office would expire on the first of January\r\nensuing.\r\n\r\nThe presumption indulged in by the majority of the court in its opinion\r\nthat Mr. Brown's removal from office was only a temporary suspension,\r\nand that the Governor certainly would give him a hearing as to the\r\nmatters complained of and found by the special commission, is made to\r\nappear more absurd by the subsequent action of Mr. Sherman himself,\r\nwho, on the 9th of December, 1885, made the following entry in the\r\nexecutive journal, and assumed to appoint J. W. Cattell to fill what he\r\nwas pleased to call a vacancy in the office of the Auditor of State.\r\nThe entry is as follows:\r\n\r\n    DECEMBER, 9, 1885.\r\n\r\n    Whereas, at the general election held on the 4th day of November,\r\n    1884, J. L. Brown was re-elected to the office of Auditor of State;\r\n    and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, the said J. L. Brown, re-elected as aforesaid, neglected\r\n    and refused to qualify as such re-elected officer, and because\r\n    thereof his official bond as such officer was not approved nor\r\n    filed, and continued in such refusal until the 3rd day of March,\r\n    1885, and unto this time, and on account thereof on the day last\r\n    aforesaid Jonathan W. Cattell was duly appointed as Auditor of\r\n    State and immediately qualified by giving bond and taking the oath\r\n    of office as required by law, which said bond was duly approved\r\n    according to law; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, at the general election held on the 3rd day of November,\r\n    1885, there was no person elected to the said office of Auditor of\r\n    State, as ascertained by the official canvass this day concluded by\r\n    the state board of canvassers; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, it is incumbent upon me to fill the vacancy in said office\r\n    now held under appointment; therefore\r\n\r\n    Jonathan W. Cattell is hereby appointed Auditor of State, to have\r\n    and to hold the same until the next general election in November,\r\n    1886; and upon his qualifying thereto by giving bond and taking the\r\n    oath of office, as required by law, he will be obeyed and respected\r\n    accordingly.\r\n\r\n    BUREN R. SHERMAN\r\n\r\nA legislature was elected that fall, and as the only opportunity for a\r\nhearing and a vindication of Mr. Brown, he sent a communication to the\r\nhouse of representatives requesting an investigation and an\r\nimpeachment, to the end that he might have a trial before the senate.\r\n\r\nThe insurance agents of the state who had been wounded by the\r\ninvestigation of their affairs, Sherman and his political adherents\r\nfilled the lobbies of the legislature, and were anxious also for\r\nBrown's impeachment. Finally the house of representatives brought in\r\narticles of impeachment, containing thirty counts, and the senate\r\nordered Mr. Brown arrested and brought before them for trial. As I had\r\nbeen Mr. Brown's counsel throughout all of these difficulties, he came\r\nto me for aid and wished me to act as his counsel. In the meantime he\r\nhad received a number of letters from \"Tom, Dick, and Harry\" throughout\r\nthe state, lawyers who wished to do some cheap advertising of\r\nthemselves, offering to attend to his case without compensation. I told\r\nMr. Brown that I would undertake his case on condition that I might\r\nselect my own assistants. I realized that the court, to-wit, the fifty\r\nsenators then entitled to seats in the senate, was of rather peculiar\r\nconstruction. We had in the first place a large majority of\r\nrepublicans, but we also had a number of very able and influential\r\ndemocrats in the senate. We had some Germans and some opposed to\r\nprohibition. It was necessary, in selecting attorneys, to consult the\r\npeculiar constitution of the senate and its make-up, and political\r\npartialities and proclivities. Mr. Brown agreed to my terms and I named\r\nMr. J. C. Bills, of Davenport, and Mr. Fred W. Lehmann, of Des Moines,\r\nas the attorneys I desired to assist me in his defense. Mr. Lehmann was\r\nan excellent lawyer and a rising young man, very popular at that time\r\nwith the democrats of the state. Mr. Bills was then nominally a\r\nrepublican, but had opposed the prohibitory law and stood well with\r\nthat political element, besides being a good lawyer.\r\n\r\nActing upon my theory as to first impression, I made an opening\r\nstatement to the senate giving them a very careful and detailed history\r\nof the case, and of the facts that we expected to prove upon the\r\nseveral counts of the indictment or impeachment. In addition to these\r\ntwo counsel we also had the assistance of E. S. Huston, of Burlington,\r\na relative of S. F. Stewart, the deputy auditor. Mr. Huston especially\r\nlooked after and cared for the interests of the deputy during the\r\ntrial. The managers upon the part of the house of representatives were\r\nMessrs. S. M. Weaver, John H. Keatley, L. A. Riley, G. W. Ball, J. E.\r\nCraig, R. G. Cousins, E. C. Roach. The trial continued about three\r\nmonths. I found I had made no mistake in selecting my assistant\r\nattorneys. We had a room set apart for us in the capitol, where we were\r\nin counsel arranging the program for the day's work before the senate,\r\nand assigning to each attorney his particular share of the work of the\r\nday. I always dreaded in coöperating with attorneys in the trial of\r\ncauses, having some one to assist me who would be an annoyance and a\r\ndrawback rather than a help, but I found in Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Bills\r\ntwo good lawyers and men of good judgment and discretion, and we had a\r\nmost agreeable as well as a successful time of it on our side of the\r\ntrial table.\r\n\r\nThe trial had not progressed more than a few weeks before we were able\r\nto turn the tide of feeling and sentiment in our favor, or rather in\r\nfavor of our client, and the case, instead of being a prosecution of\r\nJohn L. Brown, actually became an exposure of the petty tyranny and\r\nfoolishness of Buren R. Sherman, and the managers on the part of the\r\nhouse were forced into the position of recognizing Sherman as their\r\nclient and recognizing the necessity of defending his conduct rather\r\nthan of convicting Mr. Brown of any serious offense against the law.\r\n\r\nIt also was apparent before we had proceeded very far in the case that\r\nthe managers of the prosecution did not entirely agree from time to\r\ntime between themselves as to the part that each should take in the\r\nproceedings. Some of the men had evidently hoped to make a great\r\nreputation for themselves as lawyers, and were being disappointed in\r\nthe result as to that particular.\r\n\r\nWe had one serious hindrance and drawback in our case. F. S. Stewart,\r\nthe deputy auditor, proved a very heavy load to carry. He had many\r\nwinning ways by which he made no friends, and his conduct proved him to\r\nbe a greedy, grasping man, and if the impeachment had been against him\r\ninstead of Mr. Brown we should have found \"Jordan a hard road to\r\ntravel.\" In addition to his regular salary he had drawn a very\r\nconsiderable sum of money for extra pay and compensation for work he\r\nhad done in the Auditor's office, as he claimed, out of regular hours.\r\nHe had also collected as bank examiner from the various banks he\r\nexamined a considerable amount of fees for which there was no provision\r\nor warrant of law, and had taken the money to his own use. The only\r\nserious charge against Mr. Brown and the only one from which we\r\napprehended any danger, grew out of the examination of the Bremer\r\nCounty Bank, situated in Waverly, Bremer county, Iowa. That bank had\r\nfor its rival another bank in the locality, that probably would have\r\nprofited by having it go out of business, and they were entirely\r\ndisappointed and dissatisfied because the examination of the bank by\r\nMr. Brown in person and by an assistant proved the bank to be a solvent\r\nconcern. After the examination of the bank and after Mr. Brown had\r\ngiven in for publication a certificate of their solvency, and without\r\nany previous request for compensation or suggestion of payment from any\r\nsource, the cashier of the bank had paid to Mr. Brown voluntarily the\r\nsum of one hundred dollars as compensation for his extra services and\r\nexpenses during the investigation of the affairs of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe charge in the articles of impeachment was that this was a bribe to\r\nMr. Brown that had induced him to certify fraudulently and falsely to\r\nthe solvency of the bank. We proved beyond controversy that the bank\r\nwas solvent and continued to be so for several years after the\r\ninvestigation, and that the certificate of solvency given to it was\r\njust and right and proper, and there was no foundation for the charge\r\nthat it was given from any corrupt motive. This matter of the Bremer\r\nCounty Bank did not constitute any part of the original trouble or\r\naccusation against Brown by the Governor, but it was trumped up by\r\nBrown's enemies and was soon gathered in by the Governor's \"muck-rake.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all the evidence had been put in, both upon the part of the\r\nprosecution and the defense, there remained one important question for\r\nus to decide--as to whether or not we would put Mr. Brown upon the\r\nstand as a witness in his own case. The only thing we had to fear from\r\nour client as a witness was his sensitiveness and pride and his\r\ndetermination to resent any insult or imputation against his honesty\r\nand integrity in office. We knew he had some enemies in the senate who\r\nwere at the same time his judges and were to vote upon the question of\r\nhis guilt, and these senators had the right to ask him any questions\r\nupon cross-examination they might see proper. It would not do for his\r\ncounsel to object to the relevancy or propriety of any questions that\r\nmight be asked, as it might appear if we did so that we had something\r\nto hide or from which to shield our client. We had a long conference\r\nwith Mr. Brown before we decided what course to pursue upon this\r\nquestion of making him a witness. He continued to vow to us that he\r\nwould not consent to submit to any insulting interrogatories, no matter\r\nfrom whom they came, and that he would talk back if any such were\r\npropounded. I finally had a private conference with Mr. Brown and urged\r\nupon him the absolute necessity that if he went upon the stand as a\r\nwitness, of being perfectly cool and dispassionate and not manifesting\r\nany passion or resentment toward any of the senators who might question\r\nhim. After a long conference upon this point, he finally promised me\r\nthat he would do his best to suppress his indignation and his feelings,\r\nand would quietly answer any questions that might be asked him. The\r\nnext day we put Mr. Brown upon the stand as a witness, and to his\r\ncredit it may be said that he behaved himself most admirably, and won\r\nthe respect and esteem of the senate by his dignified and courteous\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the state required, in order to convict the\r\ndefendant, a vote of guilty by two-thirds of the members of the senate.\r\nInstead of this the highest vote against the defendant upon any article\r\nwas fifteen votes, or less than one-third, and upon the first, second,\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth articles that embraced the original\r\ncontroversy with Governor Sherman, upon which he refused to approve the\r\nAuditor's bond and appointed his subservient commission, there was not\r\na single vote of guilty against the Auditor, but he was unanimously\r\nacquitted. Upon several of the articles it appears that some of the\r\nsenators voted \"guilty\" upon a very slim and unwarranted basis. For\r\ninstance one of the articles of impeachment was against the Auditor for\r\ndrawing a warrant in behalf of his clerk for the month's salary, the\r\nwarrant specifying the particular section and chapter of the law that\r\nmade an appropriation for the purpose of paying this clerk. The fact of\r\nthe service being within the personal knowledge of the Auditor, and the\r\nreceipt of the clerk being upon the stub of the warrant issued, and yet\r\nthe managers insisted that there ought to have been a paper filed\r\nstating the account as between the clerk and the Auditor, and because\r\nit was not drawn out and filed among the papers of the office, six of\r\nthe senators voted to find him guilty and to impeach him. It was a mere\r\ntechnicality, extremely, finely drawn out, and showed a disposition to\r\ntry and ruin a man and his reputation without conscience or any regard\r\nto their duty as men and their oath as senators. The vote of fifteen\r\nupon the Bremer County Bank question against the Auditor may be\r\njustified upon the theory that a public officer situated as the Auditor\r\nwas, having an important duty to perform, should not accept of any gift\r\nor favor or money that might be construed as something he had hoped for\r\nor expected when he performed his official duty. The act of receiving\r\nthe money under the circumstances, though not criminal, was one of\r\nthose acts of doubtful propriety that could scarcely be justified in a\r\npublic officer.\r\n\r\nThe acquittal of Mr. Brown was beyond question a righteous and just\r\nact. Governor Larrabee, the newly elected Governor, had already\r\nrestored Mr. Brown to his office and discharged the appointee to fill\r\nthe created vacancy, and the people of the state retired Mr. Sherman\r\nfrom public employment permanently. After retiring from office he\r\nengaged in managing an insurance company at his former place of\r\nresidence in the state, in which he was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe state of Iowa paid to the attorneys in the case selected by Mr.\r\nBrown the sum of six dollars a day. I charged Mr. Brown, however, one\r\nthousand dollars for my entire services in connection with his\r\nimpeachment, and he gave me his note for the balance, deducting the\r\namount I had received from the state. This note was signed by S. F.\r\nStewart. Some months afterwards I received from Stewart's wife a very\r\nremarkable letter, full of tears and sympathy for Brown, begging me to\r\nremit the amount on the note as Mr. Brown was poor and had been much\r\nwronged and abused. I ascertained that Stewart at or about the time he\r\nsigned the note, had obtained from Mr. Brown a transfer to some\r\nvaluable stock in the _Iowa Homestead_ newspaper at much less than\r\nthe real value of the stock, and that they had counted the amount due\r\nme on this note as part of the consideration of the transfer.\r\nEstimating Mrs. Stewart's sympathy for Mr. Brown at its true value, I\r\ninsisted on my note being paid in full, which Mr. Brown cheerfully did.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was further vindicated by the subsequent action of the\r\ngeneral assembly of the state in making a reasonable appropriation to\r\nreimburse him for his expenses and attorney's fees paid out in making\r\nhis defense against the articles of impeachment. The result of the\r\ninvestigation before the senate also had a very beneficial effect upon\r\nthe home insurance companies in that it gave public confidence as to\r\ntheir solvency, and gave assurance that the proper department of state\r\nwould make the investigation of their transactions from time to time\r\nthorough and real, and not as before merely nominal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMORE LAW CASES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1874 the city of Des Moines was thrown into a state of\r\nconsiderable excitement by the fact of finding the body of a murdered\r\nman on the sidewalk near the corner of Walnut and Second street. There\r\nwas a house of bad repute in the vicinity, and the coroner's jury made\r\na thorough investigation, seemingly as far as practicable, as to the\r\ncause and origin of the death. The inhabitants of the house referred to\r\nwere examined under oath, and the women who boarded there denied any\r\nknowledge whatever of the cause of the man's death. The Governor of the\r\nstate offered a reward of five hundred dollars for the discovery and\r\nconviction of the murderer. At the next session of the grand jury of\r\nPolk county two of the women boarders at the house of bad repute\r\nreferred to, and who had denied all knowledge of the murder, appeared\r\nbefore the grand jury and testified with much detail that Charles\r\nHoward, a man who had frequented their house, had been guilty of the\r\nmurder and had carried out the dead body and laid it upon the sidewalk.\r\nThe grand jury indicted Howard accordingly for murder in the first\r\ndegree. The trial came on at the December term of the Polk county\r\ndistrict court, and in view of the public excitement, which was largely\r\nkept alive by the daily press, Howard, by his attorney, made a motion\r\nfor a change of venue on the ground of prejudice of the inhabitants of\r\nthe county. Under the peculiar provisions of our statute, counter\r\naffidavits were permitted for the purpose of showing that there was no\r\nfeeling in the community that would prevent Howard from receiving a\r\nfair trial. The sheriff informed me that in walking two squares from\r\nthe court house he had met two hundred men who were willing to sign\r\nsuch counter affidavits, and had obtained a large number of them, which\r\nwere filed accordingly. The district judge, H. W. Maxwell, overruled\r\nthe motion for a change of venue, and the trial proceeded. The only\r\ntestimony introduced in the conviction of Howard was that of the two\r\nbad women who had testified before the coroner's jury that they had no\r\nknowledge whatever in regard to the killing of Johnson. I was not\r\npersonally engaged in any way as an attorney in this case, but about\r\nten o 'clock at night after the jury had retired to consider their\r\nverdict, Judge Maxwell sent for me to come to the court house for\r\nconsultation. I found he had also sent for a like purpose for Mr. D. O.\r\nFinch, one of the oldest members of the Polk county bar. The judge\r\nadvised us that the jury had not agreed upon their verdict, but that\r\nsome one had through the bailiff sent a note in to the jury room\r\nthreatening the jury with violence in case they failed to convict the\r\ndefendant. Judge Maxwell was much excited and asked Mr. Finch and\r\nmyself what he ought to do under the circumstances. We advised him by\r\nall means to have the defendant conveyed for safe keeping to some place\r\noutside of the county, in charge of the sheriff, and to have it done\r\nsecretly and immediately lest the mob might seize the accused and\r\ncommit violence. We also advised him to discharge the jury from a\r\nfurther consideration of the case, as their verdict found under the\r\ninfluence of threats would be worthless, and that he ought also in\r\nvindication of his own court to thoroughly investigate the question as\r\nto who was guilty in sending or permitting a threat to be communicated\r\nto the jury. Instead of being influenced by our advice Judge Maxwell\r\nhad the jury brought into the courtroom for further instructions, and\r\ntold them that great excitement and feeling prevailed in the community\r\nin regard to the case, and that it was important that the jury should\r\nnot disagree but should find a verdict in the case. The next morning\r\nthe jury brought in a verdict of guilty, and the defendant waiving time\r\nfor sentence, Judge Maxwell had the prisoner brought into court. The\r\ncourtroom was crowded by an excited mob, and the judge took occasion to\r\nharangue the prisoner, denouncing his conduct in the most vehement\r\nmanner. He then sentenced the prisoner to imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary for life. That night the excited mob broke open the jail,\r\ntook the prisoner from his cell with a rope tied around his neck, and\r\nhung him to a lamp post in the court house square. The opinion of most\r\nof the persons who paid any attention to this trial was that there was\r\nno reliable evidence of Howard's guilt, and that the probabilities were\r\nthat the whole case was manufactured for the purpose of securing the\r\nreward offered for his conviction. Whether or not the reward was ever\r\npaid I have not been able to ascertain, but certain it is that the\r\ncowardice of the court and the indiscretion of the public press were\r\nresponsible for the murder of a man who, to say the least of it, was\r\nnever proved guilty by any competent evidence.\r\n\r\nWe had among the distinguished judges that acted as teachers in our law\r\nschool at Transylvania University a very eminent jurist who sometimes\r\nwhen he felt merry treated the class to that which was not only\r\ninstructive but also entertaining. On one occasion he delivered to the\r\nclass the following:\r\n\r\n    Young Gentlemen: You will find that the general principles of the\r\n    law are few and easily comprehended, but in their application to\r\n    the ever-varying transactions of human life the best of minds will\r\n    differ, hence arises what we denominate the glorious uncertainties\r\n    of the law whereby we have our bread.\r\n\r\nThe case that I am about to cite would satisfy the most credulous that\r\nthere are other causes that produce uncertain results besides the\r\ndifference in applying the general principles of the law to different\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nSection 3, article XI of the constitution of the state of Iowa,\r\nprovided as follows: \"No county or other political or municipal\r\ncorporation shall be allowed to become indebted in any manner or for\r\nany purpose to an amount in the aggregate exceeding five per centum on\r\nthe value of the taxable property within such county or corporation, to\r\nbe ascertained by the last state or county tax list previous to the\r\nincurring of such indebtedness.\" In November, 1870, the taxable\r\nproperty, real and personal, within and subject to taxation by the said\r\ncity of Des Moines, as ascertained by the last state and county tax\r\nlist, amounted to the sum of $3,140,805 and no more, and that five per\r\ncentum on said amount was only the sum of $157,040.25. In the month of\r\nMay, 1869, the city had by ordinance authorized the issuing of bonds to\r\nthe amount of $50,000 for the purpose of funding outstanding warrants,\r\nand afterwards in May, 1870, they had enacted a further ordinance\r\nauthorizing the issuing of bonds for funding outstanding warrants on\r\nthe city treasurer to the amount of $75,000, all of which bonds had\r\nbeen duly issued and were outstanding at the time of the commencement\r\nof the suit hereinafter mentioned. In addition to these bonds\r\naggregating $125,000 there were also outstanding warrants upon the\r\ntreasury to the amount of $55,000, making an aggregate indebtedness of\r\nthe city $180,000. On the 7th of July, 1870, the city passed a further\r\nordinance authorizing the issuing of bonds to the amount of $130,000\r\nfor the building and repair of certain bridges across the Des Moines\r\nand Raccoon rivers, thus exceeding the constitutional limit upon the\r\ncity's indebtedness.\r\n\r\nGeorge Sneer, a citizen and taxpayer of the city of Des Moines, applied\r\nto me to bring a suit to test the validity of this last bond issue of\r\n$130,000, informing me that the bonds had been placed in the hands of\r\nB. F. Allen, then a banker of the city of Des Moines. I informed him I\r\nwas willing to take the case provided that the suit should be\r\nmaintained in good faith, that I was satisfied that the bonds were\r\nabsolutely void whether in the hands of Allen or any other person,\r\nbeing issued in plain violation of the constitution of the state, and\r\nthat every person purchasing any evidence of indebtedness against the\r\ncity was bound to take notice of the existing indebtedness of the city\r\nand was charged with knowledge thereof, as it was a matter of record\r\nand easily ascertained. Mr. Sneer informed me that he desired the\r\nquestion of the validity of the bonds tested in good faith, and that if\r\nI undertook the case I might prosecute it to the end. He contracted to\r\npay me the sum of two hundred dollars for my services, and I\r\naccordingly prepared the bill for a perpetual injunction against the\r\ncity council, city treasurer, and B. F. Allen. No one was made\r\ndefendant to the petition except Allen and members of the city council\r\nand the city treasurer. Answers were filed by Mr. Withrow for B. F.\r\nAllen and by Seward Smith, his partner, for the city of Des Moines and\r\nmembers of the city council, and the case was submitted on bill and\r\nanswer. There was no denial of the facts set forth in the petition in\r\nregard to the indebtedness of the city, nor did anyone appear in the\r\ncase claiming to be bona fide purchasers of the bonds, but the answer\r\nof Allen was to the effect that he acted as agent for the city and had\r\nsold the bonds to one George P. Opdike & Co. of New York City. Maxwell\r\nwas judge of the district court, and to my surprise entered the\r\nfollowing decree in the case:\r\n\r\n    This cause coming on for final hearing on the plaintiff's petition,\r\n    and answer made thereto, and the defendant's answer and cross\r\n    petition, and thus heard upon the pleadings alone, and the court\r\n    having heard the argument of counsel, inspected the said record and\r\n    being fully advised in the premises, doth order, adjudge and\r\n    decree, that the plaintiff's bill be dismissed; that the bridge\r\n    bonds described therein be treated as in every respect binding\r\n    obligations of the city of Des Moines according to the tenor\r\n    thereof, and that the parties thereto and those in privity with\r\n    them be forever concluded from asserting or maintaining any defense\r\n    against the payment of said bonds, and the interest thereon, on the\r\n    grounds that the same were irregularly issued in excess of the\r\n    constitutional limitation upon the power of the said city to become\r\n    indebted; that the money now in possession of the defendant Allen,\r\n    be applied by the proper officers of the city of Des Moines to the\r\n    purposes for which the same was raised; and that the defendant have\r\n    and recover the costs herein taxed at ---- dollars, and that\r\n    execution issue therefor. To which plaintiff excepts.\r\n\r\nUpon the rendition of this decree I immediately entered an appeal in\r\nbehalf of George Sneer, and perfected the same by filing the proper\r\nabstract of record in the supreme court of the state. The cause was\r\nsubmitted to the supreme court on printed arguments on April 4, 1871.\r\nAt the October term of the supreme court, being an argument term held\r\nat Davenport at that date, the supreme court really decided the case by\r\nan opinion written by Judge Beck in behalf of a majority of the court,\r\nand the opinion was sent by Justice Day to the clerk about the time the\r\ncourt was to adjourn, with orders to file the same, and Mr. Charles\r\nLinderman, the clerk of the court, informed me that he had actually\r\nmarked the opinion \"Filed,\" and that about the time that the filing was\r\ncompleted Judge C. C. Cole, then one of the judges of the supreme\r\ncourt, entered the clerk's office and filed with him a paper signed by\r\nGeorge Sneer dismissing his appeal, and that he entered upon the\r\nrecords of the court the following entry: \"On application of appellant,\r\nit is ordered by the court that the appeal herein be, and the same is\r\nhereby dismissed.\"\r\n\r\nAt the ensuing regular term of the supreme court held at Des Moines,\r\nDecember 5, 1871, the following entry was made in the case: \"At the\r\nargument term held at Davenport in October last, on application of\r\nGeorge Sneer per se, appellant herein, the court ordered that the\r\nappeal be dismissed.\" Before this dismissal either at Davenport or at\r\nDes Moines Sneer had settled with me and paid me the fee agreed upon,\r\nand I had nothing further to do with the case except to reproach him\r\nfor violating his agreement with me that I should prosecute the case to\r\na final result.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from the sequel that Judge Cole had also prepared a\r\ndissenting opinion in the case, and these two opinions, that written\r\nby Judge Beck as the opinion of the court, and the one written by\r\nhimself were both published in the _Western Jurist_ the ensuing\r\nJanuary, the one marked \"B\" and the other marked \"C,\" but suppressing\r\nthe fact that the opinion marked \"B\" was the opinion of a majority of\r\nthe court, and that none of the judges, except Judge Cole, agreed with\r\nthe opinion marked \"C;\" and having the following extraordinary note\r\nprinted in connection with the opinions, Judge Cole being then the\r\neditor of the _Western Jurist_: \"These two articles, this and the\r\nfollowing which advocates a different view of the same question, are\r\nfrom members of the profession in Iowa occupying equal prominence\r\nbefore the public, and whose opinions are entitled to consideration.\"\r\nWhilst these opinions do not give the detail of the case that was\r\nsubmitted to the court and to which they relate, yet by carefully\r\nreading them you can easily see that they refer to an actual\r\ncontroversy that had been pending before the supreme court. The\r\nsupreme court of Iowa subsequently decided the question that was\r\ninvolved in the case of Sneer vs. the City of Des Moines, establishing\r\nthe principle as applied to this transaction to the effect that the\r\nbonds were absolutely void in the hands even of an innocent purchaser\r\nif such had been the case. See\r\n\r\n    McPherson vs. Foster, 43 Iowa, page 48.\r\n    Mosher vs. Independent School Dist., 44 Iowa, page 122.\r\n    French vs. Burlington, 42 Iowa, page 614.\r\n    Andrews vs. Orient Fire Ins. Co., 88 Iowa, page 579.\r\n    Holliday vs. Hildebrandt, 66 Northwestern Reporter, page 89.\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of the appeal by Sneer left the decree entered by Judge\r\nMaxwell in full force as though no appeal had ever been taken, and the\r\nparties procuring this result, after they had full knowledge of the\r\nfact that the majority of the judges of the supreme court held the\r\nbonds void, are fully entitled to all of the credit that their conduct\r\nmerits, and I only record the matter here as a matter of history and as\r\nvindication of myself and to exonerate myself from any responsibility\r\nfor the final result, as I had no knowledge of the dismissal of the\r\nappeal until long after the thing was done.\r\n\r\nI have within the past few weeks examined the archives of the supreme\r\ncourt, and find that the original opinion of the court written by\r\nJudge Beck signed \"B\" and printed in the _Western Jurist_ (see Vol.\r\nVI-1872) cannot be found, and also the paper signed by George Sneer\r\ndismissing the appeal is missing from the files of the court. I\r\npresume the city council, as they had by their attorney asked to be\r\nenjoined from disputing the validity of these bonds, had obtained a\r\ndecree against themselves to that effect, very willingly paid the\r\nbonds when they matured, but of this I have no actual knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF A SON AND PERSONAL INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the history of political and professional for the present, it\r\nwill now be necessary to revert and give in some detail matters more\r\npersonal and affecting more nearly my own private life. I have already\r\ngiven an account of my marriage and removal to Des Moines.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February, 1863, my wife and myself were made happy by\r\nthe birth of our only child. This hope deferred came after ten years of\r\nwaiting. Whilst the child was still an infant I was compelled to be\r\nabsent on professional business at Indianola in Warren county. I\r\nconcluded my business as soon as possible and hurried home, feeling an\r\nunpleasant premonition that everything was not all right with the\r\nmother and the child. Heavy rains had swollen the streams between\r\nIndianola and Des Moines, and as I approached the small bridge crossing\r\nthe creek about four miles south of Des Moines, I found the water\r\nrunning several feet deep over the floor of the bridge. I knew this\r\nmade the passage very dangerous because frequently such floods took\r\naway the flooring and made it probable that the horse and buggy in\r\nwhich I was riding might be cast into the flood of the stream. After\r\nsome hesitation, however, I determined to take the risk and plunged\r\ninto the stream accordingly. I got safely over and was much relieved\r\nwhen I found myself again on solid ground. I got home a little after\r\ndark and found an old lady who had been employed as nurse to the little\r\none, who was squalling violently, engaged in trotting the infant upon\r\nher knee, as my wife lay on the bed on the very verge of hysterics. The\r\nnext morning early I put out to find a nurse woman possessed of more\r\nflesh and patience, and the domestic trouble subsided. The first six\r\nmonths after the arrival of the little stranger my wife could scarcely\r\nobtain an hour's consecutive rest. The normal condition of the child\r\nappeared to be colicky. As I had to be engaged throughout the day in my\r\nbusiness we finally established a second bedroom and I divided the time\r\nat night as well as I could with my wife, taking my turn at walking the\r\nfloor at \"half dress.\" The child, however, proved a great comfort to us\r\nand a pleasure, though for many months it was the pursuit of pleasure\r\nunder difficulties.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of the following year we were surprised by a visit from\r\nthe wife of Mr. Charles McMeekin, my wife's brother, who then resided\r\nat Cincinnati, Ohio. His wife brought with her two children, a boy and\r\na girl, she herself being something of an invalid. It was very\r\ndifficult at that time, as it has been ever since, to obtain competent\r\ndomestic help, and after entertaining this lady and her two children\r\nfor several months I found it necessary to notify my brother-in-law\r\nthat situated as I was it was no longer convenient for me to entertain\r\nhis family, and they accordingly left us and went to live at a boarding\r\nhouse kept by Mrs. Washburn on Fourth street. The next summer, at the\r\nrequest of my wife, I consented to take one of the sons of her sister\r\nEliza, and I furnished the means for his transportation from Newport,\r\nKentucky, to Des Moines. I tried to give this boy instructions in\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, but found him not inclined to study,\r\nand especially disinclined to afford any help or assistance about the\r\nhouse. He had been raised under the shadow of a peculiar institution\r\nand had imbibed a strong prejudice against anything like work. After\r\nworrying with him for three or four months and being unable to make\r\nanything out of him, I sent him home to his mother.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 I purchased two lots on the northeast corner of Center and\r\nFifth streets and removed my old buildings from my place on Fourth\r\nstreet to the lots so purchased, making some improvements on the\r\nbuildings. These lots and buildings I afterwards sold and built a new\r\nhouse on the old place on Fourth street.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1877, whilst on a visit to Ohio, my half-brother,\r\nCharles R. Nourse, invited me to a private interview in which he\r\ndisclosed the fact to me that he was engaged to be married and wanted\r\nme to do something to help him start in life in some kind of business.\r\nThe young man had not improved his opportunities for an education and\r\nhad spent several winters doing farm work. Before I had left home on\r\nthat occasion Sylvanus Edinburn had proposed to exchange a small farm\r\nthat he had in the suburbs of the city, of eighty-eight acres, for some\r\nproperty I had acquired in town. It occurred to me that I might help\r\nthe boy by making the trade for this farm, and I accordingly told him\r\nif he would have his mother send an invitation to his intended to come\r\nand take dinner with us, and I liked the looks of the proposed wife I\r\nwould do something for him. He readily consented to this arrangement,\r\nas did also his intended, and as she appeared to be an industrious and\r\nbright young woman I came home and completed the purchase of the farm\r\nwhich I obtained a deed for in March, 1878. There was no building on\r\nthe farm fit to live in. I had the old house moved onto the barn-lot\r\nand fixed up for a granary, and built a new house at the expense of\r\nabout fifteen hundred dollars. In the following spring Charles R. with\r\nhis bride put in an appearance and I settled them in their new home,\r\nwhere they lived happily for a number of years, but finally after about\r\nfifteen years that most fatal of all curses, strong drink, got\r\npossession of the young man and he went to the bad.\r\n\r\nIn the year of 1875 while visiting my sister at Tuscola, Illinois, I\r\nfound her in possession of a very large and increasing family. I was\r\nespecially pleased with her second daughter, Rose, then a young lady\r\nabout twenty years of age, and suggested to my sister that if she would\r\nconsent I would take Rose home with me and help her to an education.\r\nAccordingly in 1876 Rose came to Des Moines and made her home with us.\r\n\r\nMy oldest brother, Joseph G. Nourse, had died at Cincinnati, Ohio, in\r\nMarch, 1863, and about the year of 1876 I had induced his widow with\r\nher three boys to remove to Des Moines, her oldest daughter Susan\r\nhaving previously married to Mr. J. A. Jackson. I had before that time\r\ninduced Mr. Jackson and his wife also to remove to Des Moines and had\r\ngiven Mr. Jackson employment in my office as an assistant. I had also\r\nbuilt on Fourth street a one story cottage of three rooms and a\r\nkitchen, which they occupied for a year or two.\r\n\r\nAfter my niece, Rose Vimont, had been with us for probably a year I\r\nbecame satisfied that she had not succeeded in winning the affections\r\nof my wife. Dr. C. R. Pomeroy had been our pastor at the Centenary\r\nMethodist church for several years and had removed to Emporia, Kansas,\r\nand taken charge of the State Normal School at that place. As Rose\r\ndesired to prepare herself for a teacher I went with her to Emporia in\r\nthe spring of 1877 and placed her at the institution under the care of\r\nDr. Pomeroy and his wife, where she remained for twelve months, when\r\nschool was suspended by reason of a fire which destroyed the buildings.\r\nRose returned to Des Moines and the following year, 1878, she taught a\r\nsmall school in the brick schoolhouse on the northwest corner of my\r\nfarm, and had a room and boarded with my half brother, Charles R.\r\nAfterwards she obtained a situation in the public schools of the city\r\nof Des Moines and became a very successful teacher, remaining in the\r\ncity some fifteen years or more.\r\n\r\nSoon after the purchase of my farm, in order further to promote the\r\ninterests of my brother and give him employment, I became interested in\r\nthe purchase and raising of pure bred short-horn cattle, committing to\r\nmy brother the immediate supervision and care of them on the farm, and\r\nbuilding some extensive barns and other out-buildings. I subsequently\r\nbought from George Sneer 126 acres of valuable land in section 20,\r\ntownship 79, range 24, and afterwards in July, 1879, bought\r\nthirty-seven acres adjoining the tract that I had purchased of\r\nEdinburn, making a part of the home farm. I also bought adjoining the\r\nsame original tract eleven acres from a man by the name of Parks.\r\n\r\nSubsequently I contracted with a man by the name of Miller to put down\r\na bore hole on my land near the barns, with the hope of procuring\r\nartesian water for my cattle and a flowing well. In this I was\r\ndisappointed, but I required the man to keep an accurate journal of the\r\ndifferent strata through which he bored, and at the distance of about\r\n140 feet below the surface he went through a valuable strata of coal\r\naveraging from four and one-half to six feet in thickness. I\r\nsubsequently leased the right to take coal from these lands to the\r\nKeystone Coal Company, under which lease they sunk a shaft and operated\r\na mine on the home place for about thirteen years. The royalty from the\r\ncoal during these thirteen years more than paid the original purchase\r\nprice of this land, which cost me originally only about fifty dollars\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1878 I received a letter from my old friend, Amos\r\nHarris, formerly a resident of Centerville, Iowa, then living at\r\nWichita, Kansas, informing me of the death of a man by the name of\r\nLoring, who had been a former client of mine, residing at Indianola,\r\nIowa. He stated that Mr. Loring had left a widow and some five little\r\nchildren, all girls, the youngest an infant only a few months old, and\r\nthat the family was left in a destitute condition; that upon\r\nquestioning Mrs. Loring she had told him that I had transacted some\r\nbusiness as attorney for herself and husband, and had sold a house and\r\nlot in Indianola that they had deeded to me, with a promise upon my\r\npart that after paying certain debts for the collection of which I was\r\nattorney, if there was anything left they should have it. I had\r\nrealized about one hundred dollars over and above the amount paid out\r\nand I immediately sent Mrs. Loring fifty dollars for the relief of her\r\nimmediate necessities, and afterwards paid her the balance. Some four\r\nor five years after this Mrs. Loring came to Des Moines, bringing with\r\nher this young child then about four or five years of age, stating that\r\nshe had a short time before that married a man by the name of Gregory,\r\nthat he was a man of considerable means but refused to support her\r\nfirst husband's children, that she wished to make some arrangement to\r\nhave this young child cared for, that she had already disposed of her\r\nolder girls among her relatives. I introduced her to Mrs. Winkley, then\r\na resident of Des Moines, who kept a school for small children and\r\nboarded and cared for them, a lady to whom my son had been going to\r\nschool and who was held in high estimation by her many friends. Mrs.\r\nGregory, as she then was, arranged with Mrs. Winkley to leave her\r\nyoungest child with her to be cared for, and left with me some money to\r\npay Mrs. Winkley from time to time, and also any other expenses that\r\nmight be incurred in the care of the child. Mrs. Winkley lived on Third\r\nstreet within a block or two of our residence, and I frequently had\r\nthis child visit our home. My wife seemed to be interested in the child\r\nand became attached to her, as I did also myself. Along about the first\r\nof February, 1882, Mrs. Gregory came into my office in Des Moines,\r\nstating that she had come to take her child Susie, as she could no\r\nlonger afford to bear the expense of her keeping with Mrs. Winkley. I\r\nasked her if that was the only objection to the child remaining where\r\nit was, and she said yes, she was very well satisfied but she was then\r\nseparated from her husband and was not able to pay the expense incident\r\nto the child's keeping in her present situation. I asked her if she had\r\nany home to which she could take the child, and she said no, that she\r\nhad employment at some sanitary institution but it really was not a\r\nhome for the little one. Upon the impulse of the moment and without any\r\nvery considerable thought upon the subject and having no consultation\r\nwith my wife, I told Mrs. Gregory to leave the child where it was and I\r\nwould bear the expense of caring for her. My income from my practice at\r\nthat time was averaging about $10,000 a year and I saw nothing very\r\nserious about this undertaking, but upon reporting it to my wife she\r\nexpressed herself very much dissatisfied. Upon further reflection I\r\nfeared that after the child became older the mother might claim its\r\ncustody, and for my own protection I wrote out articles of adoption and\r\nsent it to the mother, which she duly executed and returned it to me,\r\nsurrendering to me the full care, custody and control of the child,\r\nwhich articles were duly recorded in Polk county, Iowa, on the 8th of\r\nFebruary, 1882. After remaining for several years with Mrs. Winkley I\r\nsent this child to Chicago to the school of Miss Rebecca Rice, where\r\nshe remained for a number of years and received a very satisfactory\r\neducation. The enterprise, however, of caring for and educating this\r\nchild was not a success. My wife imbibed a strong prejudice against her\r\nand never received her as a member of the family. When she was about\r\nseventeen years of age she became dissatisfied and I sent her to her\r\nmother, who was then living in California. She did not remain with her\r\nmother, but afterwards came back to me and by her own wish and desire I\r\narranged to have her taught telegraphy by the superintendent of city\r\ntelegraphs at Chicago. In the meantime I ascertained that while she was\r\nin California she had engaged herself to be married to a man by the\r\nname of Guldager. I tried to dissuade her from this early and\r\ninconsiderate engagement but she had not learned the lesson of\r\nobedience and was not easily controlled by good advice or counsel. Her\r\nCalifornia lover furnished her the means and she left without my\r\nknowledge or consent and went to California to him when she was about\r\neighteen years of age, and was married.\r\n\r\nAfter the dissolution of my partnership with Williamson & St. John in\r\n1865, I continued the practice of law without any partner in business,\r\nreceiving assistance from time to time from young men who were studying\r\nlaw in the office or who were beginners in the profession. None of\r\nthese, however, proved entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1870 Benjamin F. Kauffman, then a young man recently\r\ngraduated in the law department of the State University, came to me\r\ndesiring a situation in my office. I had been so disappointed in the\r\nyoung men who had preceded him that I hesitated about making any\r\nfurther engagement in that direction. Judge George G. Wright, however,\r\nwho had been one of Mr. Kauffman's preceptors at the law school, warmly\r\nrecommended him and urged me to give him a position in the office. He\r\nwas entirely without means and I offered finally to pay his board for\r\nsix months and take him upon trial. He asked me what he could expect\r\nafter the expiration of the six months. I told him that after six\r\nmonths if I found that I could get along without him I should\r\ndiscontinue the arrangement. He replied that that was a very hard\r\nproposition. I told him no, that he was a young man in good health,\r\nfull of energy, and if he could not make himself a necessity to my\r\nbusiness in six months there was no reason why I should continue even\r\nto pay his board. He said if he accepted my proposition, what would I\r\ndo for him at the end of the six months. I told him that if he made\r\nhimself a necessity to my business so that I could not get along\r\nwithout him, he would then be master of the situation and I thought\r\nthere would be no trouble about arranging terms that would be entirely\r\nsatisfactory to him. He came into the office accordingly and applied\r\nhimself diligently to business. I occasionally stated to him some\r\nquestion involved in cases I had pending and desired him to examine the\r\nauthorities and make a brief upon the question involved. He proved to\r\nbe of very material assistance, very industrious, with a clear mind\r\ncapable of understanding and analyzing and applying the cases he found\r\nin the books bearing upon the question under investigation. At the end\r\nof six months I arranged a partnership with him and he continued in\r\nthat relation for seventeen years, with much profit pecuniarily both to\r\nhimself and myself.\r\n\r\nIn the year of 1874 I exchanged a lot that I owned on Center street\r\nwith Mrs. McCauley for property on Fifth street, taking the deed in the\r\nname of the firm of Nourse & Kauffman, upon which we built the\r\nsubsequent year a two story brick building, occupying the south half of\r\nthe first story for our law offices. We subsequently bought from Thomas\r\nBoyd the forty-four feet on the east end of this purchase, giving us\r\nthe entire forty-four south feet of lot 2, block 22, of the original\r\ntown, and in the year 1886 we built a four story brick building\r\ncovering the entire surface of the lot.\r\n\r\nOn the dissolution of my partnership with Mr. Kauffman I formed a\r\npartnership with my nephew, Clinton L. Nourse, and we removed into the\r\nnew building and occupied the front rooms of the second story. Mr.\r\nKauffman in the meantime entered into partnership with one N. T.\r\nGuernsey and occupied rooms on the fourth floor of the building.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of January, 1880, I received information that my\r\nfather, who had removed to and was then residing at Reynoldsburg, Ohio,\r\nwas very ill and not expected to live. I immediately went to\r\nReynoldsburg. My father was still conscious and able to recognize me,\r\nbut was very nearly approaching the end. My brother, John D., who\r\nresided then at Lancaster, Ohio, was in attendance upon my father but\r\nunable to arrest the disease. On the 3rd of January my father passed\r\naway. After his death in conference with my step-mother in regard to\r\nher future, I found she was disposed to join her sister, Mary Herron,\r\nin building a small house in West Rushville and making her home there.\r\nI was satisfied that this arrangement would not last. My step-mother\r\nwas a self-sacrificing woman and I knew her sister's disposition was\r\nvery exacting. It was also arranged that my half-sister Mary should\r\nlive with them. When I bid my step-mother good-bye I told her that I\r\nhad no confidence in the permanency of the arrangement she had made\r\nwith her sister, but in view of her faithfulness to my father during\r\nhis old age I wanted her to feel that she should have a home, and if\r\nthe arrangement she had made to live with her sister did not prove\r\nsatisfactory, not to hesitate about advising me of the fact, and I\r\nwould provide her a home on the farm where her youngest boy Charles R.,\r\nwas then living. As I anticipated, after a few years I received\r\ninformation that mother and sister Mary both desired to come to Iowa\r\nand avail themselves of my proffered help. They came accordingly and\r\nthe first year resided with my half-brother Charles. Mother then had\r\nabout twelve-hundred dollars of the small means left, and I proposed to\r\nborrow this money and build her a house which she should have rent\r\nfree, and I would pay her interest on the twelve-hundred dollars which\r\nwould enable her to live comfortably on the farm. I accordingly built\r\nthe cottage for herself and her daughter Mary, which they continued to\r\noccupy for several years. In the meantime sister Mary taught a Sunday\r\nSchool class in the neighborhood, and among her scholars was one Chris\r\nMathes. This rude uneducated boy, seventeen years younger than herself,\r\npretended to fall in love with her and on the first of January, 1889,\r\nshe became his wife. In March, 1896, my step-mother died, leaving what\r\nlittle means she had to her daughter Mary, and what was left of the\r\nmoney she had advanced to me for building the house she had occupied on\r\nthe farm, which I afterwards paid over to Mary in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBREEDER OF SHORT HORN CATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy half-brother, Charles R., continued on the farm in my employment and\r\nin the care of my short-horn cattle business until the year 1889, when\r\nI sold out my entire herd. During the ten years I was in the business I\r\nenjoyed the recreation and attention to my stock, finding it a great\r\nrelief from my nervous tension and anxiety incident to an extensive\r\npractice of the law. Soon after I commenced the business I attended a\r\nmeeting of the short-horn breeders of the state at West Liberty, Iowa,\r\nat which time there was organized a Short-Horn Breeders' Association of\r\nthe state of Iowa, and I was elected president of the association and\r\ncontinued in that office for seven years and until I retired from the\r\nbusiness. In the meantime we had also organized a national association\r\nat Chicago for the purpose of purchasing the short-horn herd books\r\npublished in New York, Ohio, and Kentucky, and establishing the\r\n_American Short-Horn Herd Book_, which became the only authentic\r\npublication of pedigrees of short-horn cattle in the United States. I\r\nwas made a member of this board of control and continued in that\r\nrelation for a number of years, until I declined a further election\r\nbecause of my retirement from the business. Our board of directors\r\nrepresented some eleven different states of the Union with one director\r\nfrom Canada. Our annual meetings were held at the time of the annual\r\nFat Stock Show in Chicago, and the gentlemen with whom I was associated\r\nin that capacity were among the most pleasant acquaintances I ever made\r\nduring my lifetime. I found them intelligent, broad-minded men,\r\nentirely unselfish and devoted to the interests of the Association.\r\nDuring my connection with the board we paid off the entire indebtedness\r\nincurred in the purchase of the _Short-Horn Herd Book_ as theretofore\r\npublished by Mr. Allen of New York, and also the indebtedness incurred\r\nin the purchase of the _Kentucky Herd Book_ and the _Ohio Herd Book_.\r\nOur state association also met once a year in connection with the\r\nImproved Stock Breeders' Association of the state. We generally wound\r\nup these sessions of our meetings with a banquet given us by the\r\ncitizens of the place where we held our meetings. At these banquets we\r\nhad a number of toasts and speeches, rather of the humorous than of the\r\ninstructive kind. I give herewith a specimen that I find printed with\r\nthe proceedings of the association held at Ottumwa on the 4th day of\r\nDecember, 1885.\r\n\r\n    The Short-horn and Improved Stock Breeders' associations of Iowa\r\n    were intended in a great measure by their founders as missionary\r\n    societies. It was contemplated that they would hold their\r\n    conventions in the smaller towns and more sparsely settled portions\r\n    of the state, where their discussions upon breeds and breeding\r\n    would educate the farmers around in these great and important\r\n    industries.\r\n\r\n    A feast like this in one of the thriving and finest cities of the\r\n    state is hardly consistent with this benevolent and\r\n    self-sacrificing purpose, and I have reason to fear for the\r\n    consequences; we may fall from grace. At a recent session of the\r\n    New York Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church, it is\r\n    said that the bishop had great difficulty in satisfying the\r\n    preachers about their appointments. One of the elders gravely\r\n    informed the bishop, that the preachers in his district had two\r\n    ambitions; one was to get to heaven, and the other was to be\r\n    stationed in the city of New York, and if they were to miss either,\r\n    he thought they would prefer to go to New York!\r\n\r\n    Now I know many of these self-sacrificing gentlemen I see around me\r\n    have in the past of their lives been trying to do good, looking for\r\n    their reward largely in the next world; but I fear in the future,\r\n    when we come to fix the place of our next annual meeting, they will\r\n    forget the spirit of self-sacrifice and the world to come, and say,\r\n    \"Let us go to Ottumwa!\" [Great laughter.]\r\n\r\n    I wish I could express to the citizens of Ottumwa the genuine\r\n    appreciation that I know these my brethren feel for them. It could\r\n    not be otherwise than that they should love you. You have\r\n    appreciated us and we must ever appreciate you. Your example also\r\n    may be valuable to us; others may hear of your good works and may\r\n    be thereby moved to be equally mindful of our necessities.\r\n    [Applause.]\r\n\r\n    My first knowledge of Ottumwa was in the year 1851. It was then a\r\n    straggling village of one street lined on either side with wooden\r\n    shanties. It would have been impossible for me to have imagined\r\n    then that in a few short years, whilst I am yet a young man\r\n    [laughter], there should be built here a substantial city of\r\n    fifteen thousand inhabitants. This goodly town is indeed a proud\r\n    monument to the thrift, enterprise, intelligence, and taste of its\r\n    inhabitants. Its commercial and manufacturing interests, and its\r\n    tasteful architecture you may justly be proud of.\r\n\r\n    Iowa is indeed a remarkable state and her people a peculiar people.\r\n    We have but few drones in the hive. Our population is made up of\r\n    simply the young and the strong and the enterprising of the other\r\n    states that have come hither to build up their personal fortunes,\r\n    and who have at the same time laid well and strong the foundations\r\n    of a great state. There is scarcely a college or university of any\r\n    of the older states that is not well represented in our men and\r\n    women. We have come together here and what one did not know he has\r\n    learned from his next door neighbor. All have contributed something\r\n    to the common fund of knowledge and enterprise. We have now built\r\n    our own schoolhouses and colleges, and today we have a less per\r\n    cent of illiteracy than any other state in the Union. But there is\r\n    one burden on my heart and one thought I desire to express: What is\r\n    the future to be? Are we giving to the state the children that may\r\n    worthily fill our places and take up and carry forward the work\r\n    that we have begun? The highest duty that we owe to the state is to\r\n    furnish to it in our children that perfect type of manhood that\r\n    will constitute its true glory. What signifies this accumulation of\r\n    wealth, these fine buildings, this beautiful architecture, if our\r\n    sons are to be profligates and the accursed saloon is to destroy\r\n    all the fruit of our toil. The time has come when as citizens and\r\n    as fathers we must seriously address ourselves to this problem of\r\n    our civilization.\r\n\r\n    I came to Iowa more than thirty years ago. I formed many warm\r\n    attachments among the young men, then just beginning life. I\r\n    remember the pride and hope that these young men and their then\r\n    young wives had in their children. As I visit the older towns where\r\n    these men have lived and won honorable distinction I have inquired\r\n    for their children. Alas! Too often it is a sad story and a painful\r\n    remembrance, and I have asked myself the question, is this always\r\n    to be so? And is there no help?\r\n\r\n    But enough of this; I forget I was not appointed to preach a\r\n    sermon, but to respond to a toast, and to express the appreciation\r\n    of these stockbreeders for your kindness. You have done well. The\r\n    scriptures exhort \"that we should not be forgetful to entertain\r\n    strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.\" Now I\r\n    am willing to admit that it would be a violent imagination that\r\n    would mistake one of these lusty stockbreeders for an angel. It\r\n    will probably be some time before even the pin-feathers will sprout\r\n    from their shoulder blades. But they are susceptible and under\r\n    proper influences and conditions I don't know what may happen. I\r\n    remember in the early days of Des Moines, when we were dependent\r\n    upon ourselves entirely for amusements, the ladies got up a public\r\n    entertainment consisting chiefly of tableaux. I had the honor of\r\n    officiating as stage manager. One representation was of a good and\r\n    an evil spirit, representing an angel and a devil. The ladies were\r\n    quite tardy in getting ready. I went into the green room to hurry\r\n    matters and found the ladies dressing [great applause and continued\r\n    interruption]. Do not interrupt in the middle of a sentence. I was\r\n    saying I found the ladies dressing the angel--a young lady to whom\r\n    they were attaching a pair of wings. I chided their delay and\r\n    unfortunately remarked, \"that it took a long time to make an angel\r\n    out of a woman.\" The man who was to represent the evil spirit was\r\n    sitting by, all ready, with blackened face and horns, and one of\r\n    the ladies, pointing to him instantly remarked, \"that it took but\r\n    little time to make a devil out of a man.\" Of course it is only a\r\n    question of time with all of this crowd. We all expect to be angels\r\n    but it will take time and good feeding.\r\n\r\n    I believe I have fully exhausted the subject assigned to me, to say\r\n    nothing of the audience. It is sad to have to make a speech when\r\n    you don't know beforehand what you are going to say and nobody\r\n    knows after you are done what you have said. Brethren we have cast\r\n    our bread upon the waters--and it has returned to us after many\r\n    days, literally and substantially.\r\n\r\n    I cannot conclude without thanking you for your quiet and\r\n    uninterrupted attention.\r\n\r\nDuring my visit to Emporia, Kansas, with my niece, Rose Vimont, I found\r\na volume written by Alexander H. Stephens, evidently for the purpose of\r\njustifying the attempt that had been made to destroy the government of\r\nthe United States by the disintegration of the government and the\r\nestablishment of the doctrine of the right of secession. That fall I\r\nwas invited by the president of the faculty of Simpson Centenary\r\nCollege at Indianola, Iowa, to deliver an address at the college\r\ncommencement. I accordingly prepared with considerable care a lecture\r\nupon the constitutional relations of the national and state\r\ngovernments, in which I endeavored to combat the heresies contained in\r\nStephens's book, and the great truth that the national government was\r\nnot a compact between sovereign states, but was what it purported to\r\nbe--a government emanating from the source of all power: to-wit, the\r\npeople. The trustees and faculty of the college, after this lecture,\r\nhonored me by conferring upon me the degree of Doctor of Laws. This\r\nlecture I afterwards delivered, upon the invitation of the president\r\nand faculty of Drake University, before the students of that\r\ninstitution, and also before the law class of the State University at\r\nIowa City.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I also prepared and delivered on several occasions a\r\nlecture upon the legal rights of married women, containing some sarcasm\r\nand criticism upon the advanced legislation by which under our laws a\r\nwife could bring suit in the courts and obtain judgment upon a\r\npromissory note executed by her husband and payable to herself, citing\r\nan instance in which this doctrine had actually been put in practice,\r\nand remarking upon the right of the wife to issue execution against her\r\nhusband and cause a levy to be made upon his personal property for the\r\npayment of the judgment, stating, however, that the law in its humanity\r\nand pity for the husband had fortunately exempted the husband's wearing\r\napparel, including his pantaloons, from execution. This lecture I also\r\ndelivered, at the request of several local institutions in several\r\nparts of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nB. F. ALLEN'S BANKRUPTCY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd day of January, 1875, the citizens of Des Moines were\r\nstartled by the news that the Cook County Bank of Chicago, Illinois, of\r\nwhich bank B. F. Allen was president, had closed its doors. A meeting\r\nof the citizens was called and held for consultation to ascertain what\r\neffect this would have on the local affairs of our city. Impressions\r\nseemed to prevail at first that the failure of the Cook County Bank did\r\nnot necessarily involve the failure of B. F. Allen or of his private\r\nbank in the city of Des Moines, or of the National Bank of this city,\r\nof which he was president. The great question before the meeting was to\r\nascertain \"where we were at.\" A committee was appointed for that\r\npurpose. I had the temerity to suggest that this committee could easily\r\nascertain what we all desired to know by examining the bills receivable\r\nin Mr. Allen's bank. I was decidedly of the opinion that the Cook\r\nCounty Bank had never failed and closed its doors while Mr. Allen\r\ncontrolled the means to avoid such a result. Some months before this\r\ntime, on my return home from business out of the state, my partner, Mr.\r\nKauffman, informed me that he had purchased a certificate of deposit on\r\nB. F. Allen's bank at a liberal discount from one J. C. Taylor. The\r\ncertificate of deposit was of recent date, payable twelve months after\r\ndate. It occurred to me a very strange performance that Mr. Taylor\r\nshould deposit fifteen hundred dollars in the bank and take a\r\ncertificate payable twelve months after date, and then go into the\r\nmarket and sell such a certificate at a liberal discount. As I then\r\nsuspected, and afterwards ascertained the fact to be, Taylor had not\r\ndeposited fifteen hundred dollars in the bank, but had furnished the\r\nbank his promissory note payable to the Cook County Bank and had\r\nreceived in exchange for it a certificate of deposit payable twelve\r\nmonths after date, and this note of Taylor's had been endorsed by Allen\r\nas president of the Cook County Bank, and had been sent to New York as\r\nan asset upon which to raise money. Fortunately this little transaction\r\ncoming to my knowledge induced me to remove my business from B. F.\r\nAllen's bank and I lost nothing by his failure.\r\n\r\nA short time after this; to-wit, about the 26th of January, 1875, a\r\ngentleman from New York, to-wit, A. N. Denman, formerly a clerk in the\r\noffice of Allen, Stephens & Co., came into my office and put in my\r\nhands for suit and foreclosure the following remarkable document:\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK, 18 NOV., 1874.\r\n\r\n    I hereby acknowledge the receipt of $465,000 of advances to the\r\n    Cook County National Bank of Chicago for my account, same being\r\n    made by Allen, Stephens & Co. in money, paper, and endorsements. I\r\n    have arranged with them for additional advances. In consideration\r\n    thereof I hereby grant and convey to Allen, Stephens & Co. by way\r\n    of mortgage and as security for such advances, all my real estate\r\n    of every kind and description, and wherever situated.\r\n\r\n    B. F. ALLEN.\r\n\r\nThis mortgage was not filed for record with the recorder of deeds of\r\nPolk county until the 19th of January, 1875. On the 30th of November,\r\n1874, it had been placed in a sealed package and intrusted to Mr.\r\nDenman in the city of New York with sealed instructions and directions\r\nfor him to proceed with the package to Chicago and there await further\r\ninstructions. He was not even informed of the contents of the package\r\nand was instructed not to open it until he received advices from New\r\nYork as to further proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Des Moines began to realize that B. F. Allen had\r\nreally become a bankrupt they were ready to believe almost any theory\r\nthat would exonerate him from the censure that he deserved in risking\r\nthe money of his depositors in wild and foolish speculation. One theory\r\npromulgated and believed was that he had been deceived in the value of\r\nthe assets of the Cook County Bank when he purchased the same. On the\r\ncontrary the evidence taken in the suit to which I have alluded shows\r\nthat he did not pay a dollar of his own money for the stock of the Cook\r\nCounty Bank. Several years before his failure and before his purchase\r\nof the Cook County Bank, or a controlling interest in it, he had been\r\nappointed by the United States Circuit Court of Des Moines receiver in\r\na litigation that had been commenced against the Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific Railroad Company. As such receiver he had come into possession\r\nof about $800,000 of bonds issued by the Rock Island Company. These\r\nbonds he had hypothecated in New York City for money with which he\r\ncarried on his speculations, and as the time approached for him to make\r\nsettlement of his receivership he found it necessary to do something in\r\norder to save the sureties on his bond. He accordingly went to Chicago\r\nand in May, 1873, he purchased the controlling interest in the Cook\r\nCounty Bank, giving a draft for the larger part of it on Allen,\r\nStephens & Co., and his note for the balance, all of which was\r\nultimately paid out of the money of the depositors of the Cook County\r\nBank. The funds that he came in control of by this means enabled him to\r\nsettle his receivership. Mr. Allen, in his testimony in the case\r\nreferred to gives the following account of his losses by speculation:\r\n\r\n    As a member of the firm of B. F. Murphy & Co., Chicago   $200,000\r\n    H. M. Bush & Co., Grain Speculation                        75,000\r\n    Lewis & Stephens, speculators (grain)                      30,000\r\n    Swamp Land speculation                                     18,000\r\n    San Pete Coal Co. of Utah                                  18,000\r\n    Denver Coal Lands                                           5,000\r\n    Kentucky Lands                                             25,000\r\n    South Evanston property                                    40,000\r\n    Building on So.

Co.                          35,000\r\n    Speculation Stock Exchange                                150,000\r\n\r\nThese losses only foot up $779,000, whereas in truth and in fact the\r\ndepositor's accounts in his private bank in Des Moines alone amounted\r\nto $800,000 at the time of his failure, and his indebtedness to the\r\nCharter Oak Life Insurance Company for money procured by Blennerhassett\r\nfrom that institution amounted to over one-half million dollars, and a\r\ndraft of the Iowa State National Bank $100,000 not credited to that\r\nbank until after the failure. In May 1874, one Warren Hussey, of Utah,\r\nvisited Blennerhassett & Stephens in New York City and induced them to\r\nprocure a pretended loan of $400,000 from the Charter Oak Life\r\nInsurance Company, then represented by its vice-president, a man by the\r\nname of White. The money was advanced as a pretended loan to one\r\nMatthew Gisborn without any security whatever save the personal\r\nsecurity of Gisborn & Hussey, with a private understanding that Mr.\r\nWhite and Messrs. Blennerhassett & Stephens should have the benefit of\r\nanticipated dividends on the stock of the mine, a large share of which\r\nwas in the hands of Warren Hussey for his commission as procurer; in\r\nother words, it was a speculation on the part of Allen, Stephens & Co.\r\nand White, the vice-president of the Charter Oak Life Insurance\r\nCompany, being one of the causes of the failure thereafter of the\r\nCharter Oak Life Insurance Company, as the stock proved to be entirely\r\nworthless and the security of Gisborn & Hussey was of no value\r\nwhatever. On April 22, 1875, B. F. Allen was adjudged a bankrupt on the\r\npetition of his creditors filed on the 23rd of February, 1875, and Hoyt\r\nSherman, of Des Moines, was appointed assignee in bankruptcy. Mr. Jeff\r\nS. Polk and Mr. Bisbee, an attorney of Chicago, were employed by the\r\nassignee in bankruptcy to defeat the suit for the foreclosure of the\r\nmortgage. The main ground of defense to this mortgage was that at the\r\ntime of its execution there was an agreement between Allen and Stephens\r\n& Blennerhassett that it should be withheld from record, and that\r\nbetween the time of its execution and the time that it was recorded\r\nStephens & Blennerhassett represented that Allen was solvent and\r\npossessed of large properties in real estate, and they caused him to be\r\nrated by the commercial bureaus of the country as worth one million\r\ndollars, and at the same time knew that he was in fact insolvent, and\r\nthis defense was held to be abundantly proved by the testimony taken in\r\nthe case, and the supreme court of the United States decided that as\r\nagainst the creditors and the assignee in bankruptcy the mortgage was\r\nabsolutely void. After the original petition was filed for the\r\nforeclosure of the mortgage I filed a supplemental bill making the\r\nCharter Oak Life Insurance Company the plaintiff and Hoyt Sherman, the\r\nassignee in bankruptcy, the respondent. After several months had\r\nelapsed from the time the suit was begun I concluded to make a personal\r\nvisit to Blennerhassett & Stephens, of New York City, and try to\r\nunderstand the real situation and facts in the case. I spent some two\r\nweeks interviewing the two men who constituted the firm, but for some\r\nreason not known to me I never could obtain from them any very accurate\r\naccount or reliable statement of the facts necessary to be understood\r\nto make the proper presentation of the case. Mr. Blennerhassett\r\nespecially appeared to be a very peculiar man and his desire for\r\nconcealment amounted to a controlling passion. The books of the firm of\r\nAllen, Stephens & Co. had locks upon their lids and Blennerhassett\r\ncarried the key. No attempt was made to inform me of the detail of the\r\ntransaction between them and the Cook County Bank, and I never became\r\nfully advised as to these matters except as they were developed by the\r\ntestimony afterwards taken. The evidence showed that the correspondence\r\nbetween the house in New York and Mr. Allen was carried on by means of\r\na cipher or fictitious word. Allen was represented as \"head,\"\r\nBlennerhassett as \"arm,\" and Stephens as \"leg\" of some imaginary\r\nperson. The transmission of the mortgage itself to Chicago in a sealed\r\npackage with sealed instructions, and the manner in which the business\r\nwas transacted were well calculated to excite suspicion, or in other\r\nwords give the impression that there was something that it was\r\nnecessary to conceal. That Allen was insolvent and had been for several\r\nyears prior to his actual failure the testimony left no doubt, and the\r\nmanner in which he conducted his business in connection with the house\r\nin New York was overwhelming proof that the parties knew that he could\r\nnot promptly meet his pecuniary obligations. The real interested party\r\nin the transaction was the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company. Mr.\r\nWhite, the vice-president, proved to be under the influence of\r\nBlennerhassett and obtained the money of the company in matters of loan\r\nand discount to an extent that was wholly unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nMy visit to New York, however, was a very profitable one to myself. The\r\nCharter Oak Life Insurance Company and several of the banks to whom\r\nAllen's mortgages and bills receivable had been negotiated from time to\r\ntime, including $100,000 of bonds of the Des Moines Gas Company, placed\r\nin my hands their collections, and I think that the securities that I\r\nbrought home with me amounted to one half million dollars, and in the\r\nsuit and foreclosure of these collaterals the firm of Nourse & Kauffman\r\nmade very handsome profits. The litigation lasted a number of years and\r\na final result was not obtained until the decision of the supreme court\r\nof the United States at the April term, 1882. The opinion is reported\r\nin United States Supreme Court Reports, Volume 105, page 100. After\r\nthis decision was made we filed a claim of the Charter Oak Life\r\nInsurance Company against the bankrupt estate as a general creditor. In\r\nthe meantime the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company itself had gone\r\ninto bankruptcy. We had some doubt as to whether our claim would be\r\nallowed as we had insisted on a preference that the court had decided\r\nwas fraudulent. Mr. J. S. Polk and Mr. Bisbee, of Chicago, finally\r\nbought the claim of the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company against the\r\nbankrupt estate, and had no difficulty in having it allowed by Mr.\r\nSherman, the assignee. These men also bought large and valuable\r\nportions of the real estate from Mr. Sherman, the assignee, and\r\nreceived a conveyance accordingly. The estate paid to the general\r\ncreditors only, as we were advised, about fifteen cents on the dollar.\r\nAnother interesting feature of the transaction was that Mr. Allen\r\nclaimed the benefit of the homestead law of Iowa and claimed the fine\r\nresidence on Terrace Hill with forty acres of land as exempt from his\r\ndebts. The homestead law of Iowa, however, only exempted a homestead in\r\nfavor of a resident of the state. Mr. Allen had been for a number of\r\nyears a resident of Chicago, had purchased a home there, and had paid\r\nout $31,000 on the purchase. We also proved that he had voted as a\r\ncitizen of Chicago, I think at the city, county, and state elections,\r\nand that he had offered the property on Terrace Hill for sale and had\r\ncaused a number of articles to be published in the city papers claiming\r\nthe property to be worth $100,000. A compromise, however, was made by\r\nthe assignee in bankruptcy by which Mr. Allen was allowed the buildings\r\nand a limited amount of ground, and Mr. F. M. Hubbell purchased the\r\nsame for $40,000. This $40,000 did him no good, for within a year or\r\ntwo he lost it in another grain speculation on the board of trade in\r\nChicago. In the meantime his wife, who was a daughter of Captain F. R.\r\nWest, had become insane and imagined that her husband's creditors were\r\npursuing her because of their losses, and she died within a few months\r\nafter losing her reason. Mr. Allen a few years afterwards removed to\r\nCalifornia, where he still lives at the time of the present writing,\r\nholding some employment from the United States government in connection\r\nwith the business of preserving the timber on the public lands in that\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Charles Clinton Nourse_\r\n  From Photograph by I. W. Kramer, Des Moines]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nABOUT PROHIBITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1889, the democratic party of the state of\r\nIowa, for the first time since the election of Governor Grimes in 1854,\r\nsucceeded in electing their candidate for governor; to-wit, Horace\r\nBoies. This was brought about by a singular combination between the\r\nrailroad and the saloon interests of the state. I have already given\r\nsome account of the effect upon the question of prohibition of the\r\nfoolish policy pursued by the pretended friends of temperance in\r\nsecuring from the supreme court of the state a decision against the\r\nright to manufacture alcohol within the limits of the state for the\r\npurpose of export, and also the foolishness and wickedness of certain\r\npretended friends of prohibition in instituting fraudulent prosecutions\r\nwith a view to making costs and fees for their own personal profit.\r\nDuring the administration of Governor Larrabee the railroads of the\r\nstate had become very restive under the control exercised by the\r\nRailroad Commissioners of the state under the law of 1888. In the month\r\nof August, 1888, some thirty suits were commenced in the district court\r\nof Polk county against the Rock Island, Northwestern, and \"Q\" railroads\r\nfor penalties incurred in failure to make their reports to the\r\nCommissioners as required by the statute. The railroads of Iowa had\r\nbecome a very potent political power. We had five railroads extending\r\nfrom the Mississippi to the Missouri river, and in every county of the\r\nstate in which these roads were located the railroads had one or more\r\nactive attorneys to look after their interests, and under such\r\ncaptaincy as Blythe, of Burlington, and Hubbard, of Cedar Rapids, they\r\nexercised a very important influence over the politics of the state,\r\ncontrolling to a large extent the nomination of supreme judges and\r\ndistrict judges and other state officers. The people of the state had\r\nbecome restive under the domination of this power. The open and\r\nshameless peddling of railroad passes to the members of the general\r\nassembly had begun to lose its power as against the rising indignation\r\nof the people. In the counties of Lee, Des Moines, Muscatine, Scott,\r\nand Dubuque on the Mississippi river, and such interior counties as\r\nJohnson and Crawford, with their foreign population, the saloon power\r\nof the state, uniting with the railroads, was sufficient to cause a\r\nsuccessful revolt against the party in power. Horace Boies, the\r\ndemocratic candidate for governor, openly and shamelessly declared the\r\nprohibitory law to be cruel and unjust in its provisions, and his\r\nutterances in this behalf encouraged the violators of the law to\r\nbelieve what they afterwards realized, that though the courts might\r\nassess penalties, yet an executive who believed the penalty to be\r\nunjust could easily be persuaded to exercise pardoning power in their\r\nremission, and such was the result. For four years during the\r\nadministration of Horace Boies the effort to enforce the prohibitory\r\nlaw was almost paralyzed. After incurring all the expense and trouble\r\nincident to the conviction of any one violating the prohibitory law,\r\nthe people had the mortification of seeing the judgments of the courts\r\nrendered nugatory by the wrongful exercise of the pardoning power,\r\nvested by the constitution in the governor for wise and proper\r\npurposes, prostituted by an unscrupulous politician for his own\r\npolitical advancement and that of his party.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of this successful revolution in the politics of the\r\nstate arose from the absolute cowardice of the leading republicans of\r\nthe state in not defending the legislation for which they were\r\nresponsible. During the candidacy of Boies for his second term, a\r\ngentleman who was a candidate on the state ticket for a state office\r\napplied to me and asked my consent to publicly discuss the question of\r\nprohibition with Mr. Boies in case the state central committee of the\r\nparty would arrange for such discussion. I gave my consent to such an\r\narrangement, provided the committee would agree to the same, but he\r\nafterwards reported to me that the committee did not think it\r\nadvisable. On the part of the public speakers in behalf of the\r\nrepublican cause the only discussion of the question of prohibition was\r\nan apology for the enactment of the law. They did not attempt to\r\ndiscuss the question of right or wrong, but only that the law was\r\nenacted because the people by their vote upon the constitutional\r\namendment had signified their approval of prohibition. The result of\r\nthis cowardice and the four years' domination of the democratic party\r\nhad its result in the platform adopted by the republican state\r\nconvention in the year 1893. Only the year before this the republican\r\nstate convention had adopted a resolution promising the people of the\r\nstate that the party would take no backward step on the subject of\r\nprohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, and at this\r\nconvention in 1893 they adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That prohibition is not a test of republicanism. The\r\n    general assembly has given to the state a prohibitory law as\r\n    strong as any that has been enacted in any country. Like any other\r\n    criminal statute, its retention, mitigation or repeal must be\r\n    determined by the general assembly, elected by and in sympathy\r\n    with the people and to it is relegated the subject, to take such\r\n    action as they may deem best in the matter, maintaining the\r\n    present law in those portions of the state where it is now or can\r\n    be made efficient, and giving to other localities such methods of\r\n    controlling and regulating the liquor traffic as will best serve\r\n    the cause of temperance and morality.\r\n\r\nUnder this platform, which merely meant the return of the open licensed\r\nsaloon to Iowa in such localities in which the people would tolerate\r\nthem, Mr. A. B. Cummins and his followers were all received back with\r\nopen arms as prodigal sons and became at once important leaders\r\npolitically in the republican party. The friends of prohibition were\r\nshocked and alarmed at this result and at once the prominent and more\r\ncourageous prohibitionists of the state joined in a call for an\r\nindependent republican convention favorable to prohibition. At the\r\nsolicitation of a number of prohibitionists in the city of Des Moines I\r\nprepared the following address and call for a state convention, which\r\naddress was adopted by a public meeting, held in the city of Des Moines:\r\n\r\n    When, through the machinations of men who, in their desire for\r\n    success, have lost sight of principle, causes dear to humanity are\r\n    about to be sacrificed, it becomes the duty of patriotic citizens\r\n    to make an organized effort to rescue their imperiled rights.\r\n\r\n    As republicans we assert our unqualified devotion to the doctrines\r\n    and principles of the republican party as heretofore set forth in\r\n    our national platform, and as declared by republican state\r\n    conventions and put in practical effect in the state of Iowa by\r\n    republican legislators prior to the meeting of the republican state\r\n    convention, held at Des Moines on the sixteenth inst. We declare\r\n    that through the patriotic efforts of the republican party of Iowa\r\n    prohibition had become the settled policy of the state, and that\r\n    any attempt on the part of the politicians to induce the party to\r\n    take a backward step on that question is to repudiate a past\r\n    honorable record and to uselessly endanger future success by a base\r\n    imitation of a hitherto despised opposition.\r\n\r\n    More than forty years ago the people of Iowa without distinction of\r\n    party declared through the enactment of their general assembly,\r\n    that the \"people of this state would hereafter take no part in the\r\n    profits of the retail of intoxicating liquors.\" This principle was\r\n    again approved by the people of the state in the adoption of the\r\n    act of 1855, approved by Governor Grimes, and more recently the\r\n    people again endorsed the principle by adopting a constitutional\r\n    amendment prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors for the\r\n    purpose of a beverage. The people of the state of Iowa have never\r\n    indicated any desire for a change of policy on this question, but\r\n    on the contrary through the action of their representatives\r\n    expressly elected upon this issue, they have constantly and\r\n    consistently adhered to our present law.\r\n\r\n    The declarations of the recent republican convention have not been\r\n    brought about by any change of sentiment on the part of the\r\n    republicans of the state, but in our judgment its action is the\r\n    result of a combination of politicians who had other and ulterior\r\n    purposes at heart, and have failed to realize that whatever may\r\n    have been their own want of convictions upon the question, the\r\n    great mass of people have been honest and sincere. The honest\r\n    voters of the republican party are not \"clay in the hands of the\r\n    potter,\" to be molded into any fashion that may suit the\r\n    professional politician. The battle that for the past quarter of a\r\n    century they have been waging against the liquor power and\r\n    influence, and in which they have gained so many signal triumphs,\r\n    has not been prompted by a mere desire for office or place, nor\r\n    have our forces been kept together by the mere \"cohesive power of\r\n    the hope of public plunder.\" Hence if the defeat of 1891 could in\r\n    any measure have been attributed to the position of the party on\r\n    the question of prohibition, it would not constitute a valid reason\r\n    for a shameful surrender and retreat. When the republican party\r\n    declared for the maintenance of the prohibitory law, and promised\r\n    that the party would take no backward step on this question, the\r\n    earnest and honest men of the party did not mean that the party\r\n    would only pursue that policy so long as it would win, but they\r\n    meant that prohibition was right and that they would maintain the\r\n    right, and that they intended to fight it out on that line, not\r\n    only that summer, but until the saloon should make an unconditional\r\n    surrender.\r\n\r\n    We have reasons to believe and do believe that the platform of the\r\n    convention of the sixteenth inst., on the subject of temperance,\r\n    was brought about by the same combination of railroad and saloon\r\n    influence that defeated our party in the election of 1891, aided by\r\n    the timid and half-hearted defense of our platform through the\r\n    weakness of our state central committee.\r\n\r\n    The implied threat of the same combination to repeat their\r\n    opposition in the approaching election, induced the republican\r\n    state central committee to unite in accomplishing this surrender.\r\n    It is said and often repeated that there is no hope for the cause\r\n    of prohibition except through the success of the republican party.\r\n    This was undoubtedly true so long as the state platform pledged the\r\n    party to maintain and enforce the law.\r\n\r\n    The platform adopted on the sixteenth inst. not only does not\r\n    promise to maintain prohibition as a state policy, but expressly\r\n    declares in favor of \"something else\" in those localities where the\r\n    prohibitory law was not enforced. This \"something else\" in the\r\n    pretended \"interest of true temperance\" can deceive no man who does\r\n    not desire to be deceived. It is a base imitation of democratic\r\n    state platforms, and intends merely the \"Schmidt bill\" or the\r\n    \"Gatch bill\" or some other equally objectionable attempt to abandon\r\n    prohibition as a principle and as a state policy.\r\n\r\n    We believe in the sovereignty of the state of Iowa, and in its\r\n    undivided sovereignty over every foot of territory within its\r\n    boundaries. We do not believe the general assembly should attempt\r\n    to exercise the power to make an act criminal in one part of the\r\n    state and license the same act in another part of the state. The\r\n    constitution of our state requires that all laws enacted by the\r\n    general assembly \"shall have a uniform operation.\" If the state\r\n    shall concede that the sale of intoxicating liquors may be licensed\r\n    in one part of the state and saloons may be lawfully established in\r\n    one city or county, with what consistency can the state punish such\r\n    acts as criminal when done in another locality within her\r\n    jurisdiction. The establishment of a saloon for the propagation of\r\n    drunkenness is either innocent or a criminal act. We recognize no\r\n    middle ground. We do not believe in compromising with criminals or\r\n    commuting offenses committed against the best interests of\r\n    humanity. Neither do we believe the republican party of Iowa can\r\n    ever survive an act so inconsistent with principle and her former\r\n    professions, as would be the repeal of our present prohibitory law\r\n    or the enactment of a license system for any part of the state.\r\n\r\n    We do not propose or recommend opposition to the election of any\r\n    candidate for the general assembly on the republican ticket who is\r\n    in favor of maintaining and enforcing our present law. The election\r\n    of such is consistent with our past history and policy and will\r\n    secure a republican United States senator. If, however, any\r\n    candidate for the general assembly on the republican ticket shall\r\n    declare for a saloon as against what has heretofore been recognized\r\n    as republicanism, the responsibility of his defeat, with all its\r\n    political consequences, will be upon him, and not upon those who\r\n    are true to their convictions and principles and the past policy of\r\n    the party.\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, the republicans of Polk county in mass convention\r\n    assembled, at the instance and with the coöperation of the\r\n    republicans of Sac and other counties of the state, who protest and\r\n    dissent from the action of the state convention of the sixteenth\r\n    inst., with the view of an organized effort that may save our party\r\n    from committing the great wrong and outrage attempted, do hereby\r\n    invite all citizens who agree with us in sentiment and purpose to\r\n    meet in delegate convention in Calvary Tabernacle at Des Moines,\r\n    Iowa, on Tuesday the fifth day of September, A.D. 1893, at 10 A.M.,\r\n    to take such steps and devise such measures as\r\n\r\n    _First._ Will secure the election to the general assembly at the\r\n    November election of such candidates only as will maintain the\r\n    present prohibitory law.\r\n\r\n    _Second._ As will secure such action and such an expression of\r\n    the will and wishes of the people of the state as will convince the\r\n    republican managers that the path of honor is the only path of\r\n    safety.\r\n\r\nThe call for this convention alarmed the leaders of the republican\r\nparty in the state, and they were very active in their efforts to\r\ncounteract its effect. The convention was held according to the call on\r\nthe 5th of September, 1893, and we had a very large representation and\r\na very enthusiastic convention. We adopted a platform embracing the\r\nprinciples indicated in the call for the convention and nominated a\r\nstate ticket. Our candidate for Governor, Mr. L. S. Coffin, was not\r\npresent in the convention, but Doctor Fellows, a prominent\r\nprohibitionist of the state, vouched for his entire sympathy with the\r\nmovement and his acceptance of the nomination. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster,\r\nwho had been president of the national W.C.T.U., was sent by\r\npoliticians from Washington, D.C., and was present at the convention,\r\nfor the purpose, if possible, of alienating such as she could influence\r\nfrom taking part in or endorsing the movement. She seated herself in\r\nthe gallery over against the chair occupied by the president and\r\nscowled and looked vengeance at those who took an active part in its\r\nproceedings. When I read the call for the convention before set out she\r\nlooked for all the world like Tam O'Shanter's wife when waiting for\r\nTam's return, \"Knitting her brows like a gathering storm and nursing\r\nher wrath to keep it warm.\" During the recess of the convention she was\r\nvery busy button-holing first one and then another of the prominent\r\nprohibitionists in attendance, taking them to a private parlor in the\r\nhotel and laboring with them to convince them that the success of the\r\nrepublican party was more important than the question of prohibition.\r\nAfter our nomination of Coffin as our candidate for Governor, Mr. Lafe\r\nYoung, editor of the _Capital_, made a visit to Mr. Coffin at his\r\nhome at Fort Dodge. Mr. Coffin had prepared his letter of acceptance of\r\nour nomination, but Young induced him to cut it in two and change the\r\nlatter half of it so that it would read a declination of the\r\nnomination, and by some means unknown to the public induced Mr. Coffin\r\nto take the stump and make a number of speeches on the tariff question\r\nduring the political canvass that year. By some means unknown also to\r\nme, the leading railroad lawyers of the state who had supported Boies\r\nwere induced to return to their allegiance to the republican party, and\r\nthe party succeeded in electing Jackson their candidate for governor,\r\nand also electing a legislature in sympathy with their saloon platform.\r\nThe general assembly that met in January, 1894, accordingly passed the\r\nact known as the mulct law, being chapter 62 of the laws of the 25th\r\ngeneral assembly of the state. This act does not in terms attempt to\r\nrepeal the prohibitory law then in force in the state. On the contrary,\r\nsection 16 of the act expressly provides: \"Nothing in this act\r\ncontained, shall be in any way construed to mean that the business of\r\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors is in any way legalized, nor is the\r\nsame to be construed in any manner or form as a license, nor shall the\r\nassessment or payment of any tax for the sale of liquors as aforesaid,\r\nprotect the wrongdoer from any penalty now provided by law, except that\r\non conditions hereinafter provided certain penalties may be suspended.\"\r\n\r\nThe next section of the act provides for the circulation of a petition,\r\nand by obtaining a certain majority or percentage of the voters to sign\r\na petition to that effect the penalties provided in the prohibitory\r\nliquor law shall not be enforced against the offender. Under this law\r\nthe brewers of St. Louis and Milwaukee employed men to circulate\r\npetitions, paying them five dollars a day for their services in\r\nobtaining signatures to petitions in certain counties of the state,\r\nunder which the parties who paid the required tax were secured against\r\nany prosecutions for violations of the law. I tried several cases in\r\nthe district and supreme court of the state for the purpose of testing\r\nthe constitutionality of this act of the legislature. It placed the\r\npardoning power theretofore exercised by the Governor of the state in\r\nthe hands of the brewers of Milwaukee and St. Louis and their\r\nemployees, provided they could by such means as they might adopt,\r\nobtain the required number of signatures to such petitions. It clearly\r\nrecognized that what was a crime under the law in one part of the\r\nstate, might be committed provided the necessary amount was furnished\r\nand paid into the public treasury as a commutation for the offense, and\r\nthat payment should be made in advance without reference to the number\r\nof offenses that might be committed. It was clearly not a law of\r\nuniform operations under the decisions of our supreme court as\r\ntheretofore held, for it was a crime in one city or county in the state\r\nand not a crime in another city or county of the state; notwithstanding\r\nthe law making it a crime was still left in full force and effect,\r\nexcept as it was abrogated in a particular locality by the signing of\r\ncertain petitions. Strange to say the supreme court of Iowa,\r\nnotwithstanding their former decisions to which I have heretofore\r\nreferred, sustained this law and its constitutionality, and under it in\r\nall of the counties of the state where we had any considerable foreign\r\npopulation the legalized saloon has returned to do its deadly work and\r\nthe only compensation for it is that men who call themselves\r\nrepublicans have been able to hold and enjoy the honors of public\r\noffice. After the decision of our supreme court upon the question of\r\nthe constitutionality of this act I received from the editors of a law\r\npublication east a communication requesting my views and opinions for\r\npublication in their law magazine, and I simply wrote upon the letter\r\naddressed to me the statement that the decision made by our supreme\r\ncourt under this law was a political necessity and that it was an old\r\nand true adage that necessity knew no law, and I had no further\r\ncomments to make upon it.\r\n\r\nSince the prominent part that I took in this canvass of 1893 my\r\nstanding with the republican party has been rather impaired;\r\nnevertheless, subsequently in the campaigns of Mr. Wm. Jennings Bryan\r\ninvolving the national policy of the republican party, I have taken\r\nvery active part. The free coinage of silver heresy of Mr. Bryan I\r\nregarded as a serious menace to the integrity and honor of the nation,\r\nand I spent very considerable time and my own private means in making\r\npublic speeches condemning that wild and visionary scheme. In state\r\npolitics I have taken no active part since 1894. I never belonged to or\r\ncoöperated with what has been known as the \"Third party\" or the\r\nprohibition party as a national organization. When the prohibitionists\r\nof Iowa united with the national organization I strongly advised\r\nagainst it. I could not see any hope of accomplishing anything by such\r\nan organization. The states of Kansas, Iowa, and the Dakotas had become\r\nprohibition, and in my judgment the only effectual way of reaching the\r\nquestion of prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage,\r\nor the establishment of places of resort for such sale, was by the\r\nexercise of the police power of the states in the management of their\r\nown domestic affairs. The congress of the United States had no control\r\nover the subject, except in the matter of revenue laws or the taxing of\r\nthe manufacture or sale of liquors. Our courts and the supreme court of\r\nthe United States had agreed that the payment of taxes under these\r\nrevenue laws and the issuing of what has been called a license, was\r\nreally no protection as against the state law and its penalties. The\r\ngeneral government does not exercise police power within the state but\r\nit may enforce penalties for the violation of revenue laws or enact\r\nlaws regulating commerce within the states, but it cannot prohibit the\r\nestablishment of the saloon or the maintenance of such a place merely\r\nupon the ground of preserving public order and morality. I could not\r\nand never have been able, therefore, to see the propriety of a national\r\norganization based upon the idea of prohibiting the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors as a beverage, or establishing places of resort\r\nfor such sale.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to this third party, the national prohibition party,\r\nso-called, has been the adoption of a platform favoring universal\r\nsuffrage without reference to sex. This also is a question over which\r\nthe congress of the United States have not heretofore exercised any\r\njurisdiction. The question of suffrage or the right to vote has been a\r\nmatter peculiarly within the control of each state of the Union and its\r\nlocal constitution and laws, and is not and never has been a matter of\r\nnational politics. I have always believed and still believe that if the\r\nprohibitionists had confined their efforts to the several states,\r\ncapturing those in which they had some prospect of success, their cause\r\nwould have grown and become stronger each year. The great centers of\r\npopulation such as New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and St. Louis,\r\nand such other cities filled as they are with foreign population, who\r\nhave no sympathy with the manners and customs pertaining to these\r\nagricultural states, cannot in my judgment be brought under the control\r\nof prohibition at any time during the present or next generation of\r\nmen, and I regard it as foolish to spend our time and our money in such\r\nquixotic efforts. My hope in inaugurating the movement that we made in\r\n1893 was simply to teach the republicans of Iowa the lesson that\r\nsuccess politically was not to be attained in this state by\r\nsubservience to the saloon power, and that defeat in the election of\r\nthat year might result in a return of the party to its better and\r\nhigher purposes in maintaining that which was right and just and\r\nhumane. That we were defeated in that effort at that time was most\r\nunfortunate, but the domination of the political power of the saloon, I\r\nstill have faith to believe, will work its own destruction, and that\r\nthe people of this state will return to their former convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nPERSONAL INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1888 I sold my home, 707 Fourth street, and\r\nbuilt a house for my residence on my farm. We left the old home with no\r\nlittle regret. It had been our place of residence since the fall of\r\n1859, with the exception of two years in which we fitted up the\r\nproperty temporarily on the corner of Fifth and Center, while we built\r\nthe new house on Fourth in the old location. We had planted the shade\r\ntrees of hard and soft maple. Here our child had been born and had\r\ngrown to manhood, here we had celebrated our silver wedding in 1878,\r\nand had enjoyed the society of many kind friends and persons of\r\ndistinction and influence in the state. Bishop Andrews, the bishop of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal church, with his family, resided nearly\r\nopposite to our house, and Bishop Hearst and his family had lived on\r\nThird street nearby, and our excellent neighbors, A. Y. Rawson and his\r\nfirst wife, Thos. F. Withrow and his family, had been our kind friends\r\nthrough many years. Here we had entertained such men as Governor Grimes\r\nand Governor Kirkwood and his wife, Senator Harlan and his wife, Bishop\r\nWaldron, Bishop Simpson, and other distinguished men of the state and\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult problem in my life that I had to solve was the care\r\nand education of my son. I felt that everything was at stake in his\r\nproper discipline and education. During his early childhood we sent him\r\nto school as already mentioned to Mrs. Winkley, afterwards for some\r\nyears to the public school and still later to Callanan College, an\r\ninstitution taught by Dr. Pomeroy. When the time came for him to go\r\nfrom home and attend college my first thought was to send him to Iowa\r\nCity to the State University, but I had grave fears in regard to the\r\ninfluence that prevailed in that city. The college campus was environed\r\nby saloons and public sentiment of that town was far from being what it\r\nought to have been. Attorneys had been mobbed in the streets of the\r\ncity for the offense of prosecuting the violators of the prohibitory\r\nlaw, and there had been no proper expression of public sentiment\r\ncondemning the outrage. I consulted with a number of the best citizens\r\nof Iowa City in regard to the matter of sending my son there for his\r\neducation, but I became satisfied that they knew but very little of\r\nwhat was transpiring in the city after bedtime. I thought it prudent to\r\nmake an investigation on my own account. I accordingly took the train\r\nthat left Des Moines at five o'clock in the afternoon, arriving at Iowa\r\nCity about half past nine. I went to the St. James Hotel and quietly\r\nregistered my name and engaged a room for the night, but did not go to\r\nbed. I waited until about half past ten or eleven o'clock, and took my\r\nhat and started out on a tour of inspection. I visited a number of the\r\nsaloons on the public square and found them filled with young men, no\r\ndoubt students of the college, and I met several crowds of these young\r\ngentlemen on the street headed by one of the trustees of the college in\r\nnot a very sober condition. I returned to my hotel with my mind fully\r\nmade up that my boy should go without an education before I would\r\nsubject him to the risk of being educated in such a town. Subsequently\r\nI visited Ames in company with my wife and selected a proper room in\r\nthe dormitory for my son's occupancy, and we sent him to Ames\r\naccordingly. He afterwards spent a year in California before settling\r\ndown to business as an architect in Des Moines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rebecca A. McMeekin Nourse_ From Photograph by\r\nEdinger]\r\n\r\nHe was anxious to design a country farm house that should be a credit\r\nto his own skill and ability. Our new house was completed in the latter\r\npart of July of that year. We found it somewhat inconvenient to be so\r\nfar away from our church privileges and from business, but took great\r\npleasure in improving our grounds and setting out fruit and ornamental\r\ntrees for our new home. I had the old road changed so as to run east of\r\nthe house. My wife soon became very much attached to the new home and\r\nhere we had many pleasant reunions with our old friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 I rented the farm, including the land in section 20 bought of\r\nSneer, to Mr. Charles West for the term of three years, he carrying on\r\na dairy farm on the place, reserving from his lease the right to occupy\r\nthe orchard as well as my own residence, and also the right of pasture\r\nfor a team of horses and a couple of cows. The next year, 1889, my son\r\ncontracted marriage with Miss Elizabeth Baehring, and here were born my\r\ntwo grandchildren, Clinton Baehring Nourse on April 14, 1890, and\r\nLawrence Baehring Nourse on October 5, 1893. My son and his wife and\r\nfirst child made a trip to Europe in the year 1892. In 1895 my son\r\npurchased a property on Fifth street and removed to the city and\r\noccupied the same until the fall of the year, when the children were\r\nboth taken down with diphtheria. He put them both at once in a carriage\r\nand brought them out to our country home, where the oldest of the two\r\nchildren died September 10th. This was the first death we had in the\r\nfamily, and I purchased a lot in Woodland Cemetery where the little one\r\nwas laid away.\r\n\r\nThe following year my health became somewhat impaired and I had a\r\nserious attack of what they called la grippe. I was somewhat overworked\r\nat that time, and under the advice of my physician I went with my wife\r\nto the state of Florida and spent the winter in St. Petersburg in that\r\nstate, returning early in the spring and resuming my practice. For\r\nseveral successive years since then I have spent my winters in St.\r\nPetersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1902 my son's health became seriously impaired, and early\r\nthat fall with his wife and child he visited California, and in\r\nDecember of that year my wife and myself joined them. My son suffered\r\nfrom severe nervous condition that made it impossible for him to sleep\r\nonly a few hours out of each twenty-four. He was reduced in flesh to\r\nabout 117 pounds weight and I became seriously concerned for his\r\nfuture. Finding outdoor travel to agree with him better than treatment\r\nof the doctors, we finally in the month of April, 1903, determined upon\r\na camping expedition and a visit to the Yosemite valley. We fitted out\r\ntwo teams with camp wagons and tent, and started from Long Beach about\r\nthe 26th of April, traveling about twenty miles a day, going first via\r\nthe coast to Santa Barbara and thence via Merced over to the Yosemite\r\nvalley. At Santa Barbara my wife concluded she would not go any further\r\nwith us on the trip. Our roads over mountains were very narrow, the\r\nouter wheel of the wagon only three or four feet from the precipice,\r\nand she suffered nervous apprehension that deprived her of any real\r\nenjoyment of the trip. I secured the services of a young man to\r\naccompany us on the further trip and to aid in the work incident to\r\ncamp life. My son's wife had suffered from a spell of nervous\r\nindigestion and was scarcely able to do the cooking for her husband and\r\nchild. I became the cook for myself and my assistant and acquired\r\nconsiderable skill in making coffee and flapjacks and frying breakfast\r\nbacon. The scenery upon this trip and in the valley of the Yosemite has\r\nbeen described by many writers more skilled than myself in putting\r\ntheir impressions upon paper. I can only say that we all enjoyed the\r\ntrip exceedingly and were strongly impressed with these wonderful\r\nmountains and valleys and great trees that have acquired a world-wide\r\nreputation. My wife and myself returned to Iowa and to our home early\r\nin July, 1903.\r\n\r\nDuring the second year of the tenancy of Mr. Chas. West I had the\r\nmisfortune of losing all of my barns and outbuildings by fire. The loss\r\namounted to about $3,500 and I only had $500 insurance on one of the\r\nbarns. I immediately rebuilt the barns and granary and corn cribs,\r\ntaking the precaution also to build a separate barn for my own use. A\r\nfew months after my return from California in that year I discovered\r\nthat one of my eyes had failed, supposed to be caused by a callous\r\ncondition of the optic nerve. Soon after the other eye became affected\r\nin the same way, and later in the fall I was unable to read. I first\r\napplied to and received treatment from Dr. Pearson; afterwards I\r\nvisited Chicago and took treatment of an oculist of some reputation\r\nthere. The following winter I took treatment from Dr. Amos of Des\r\nMoines, and spent two weeks in the Methodist Hospital without receiving\r\nany relief or seeming benefit. These physicians were all candid enough\r\nto confess their inability to do me any good, and since that time I\r\nhave been partially deprived of the use of my sight, and have not been\r\nable to read or write. My physicians promised me several years ago that\r\nI should lose my sight entirely, but in this I am happy to say they\r\nwere wrong. I can still see imperfectly to get about and avoid\r\ncollision with objects, but I am not able to recognize the features of\r\nfriends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nI have continued every year to visit St. Petersburg during the winter\r\nseason, and have made many pleasant and interesting acquaintances among\r\nthe tourists who visit annually that place.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of November, 1906, my beautiful home was totally\r\ndestroyed by fire. We lost all our furniture and clothing, except my\r\nprivate library and furnishings on the first floor of the house, which\r\nwe succeeded in rescuing from the flames. The previous winter my wife\r\nhad accompanied me to Florida and remained with me there during the\r\nseason. After our house was destroyed we removed to the city and\r\noccupied apartments with my son and his wife in a block of flats then\r\nbelonging to my son on Fifth street. The following winter, 1906-07, I\r\nspent in St. Petersburg, returning home in April of that year. I had\r\nbeen home only a few days before we made the sad discovery that my\r\nwife's health was fast failing. At her earnest solicitation, however,\r\nwe rebuilt our house on the farm and in August of that year\r\nreëstablished ourselves in the location of our old home.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the saddest event of my life. On the 11th day of\r\nNovember, succeeding, my wife passed away. The previous 21st of March\r\nwas her eightieth birthday. A short time before that date while at St.\r\nPetersburg, Florida, I received from my daughter Elizabeth a letter\r\nstating that she intended to have some friends spend an evening with my\r\nwife to have a birthday celebration, and requesting me to write some\r\nverses and also to send a new silk dress pattern to be presented to my\r\nwife on the occasion. I had a premonition that the sad event that later\r\ntranspired in the fall was not far off. I wrote as cheerfully as I\r\ncould under the circumstances and sent my daughter a check with which\r\nto purchase the silk dress pattern, and the following verses I composed\r\nas well as I could with my defective sight. They were read on the\r\noccasion, and those present assure me that my wife was cheerful and\r\nenjoyed their visit very much:\r\n\r\n    My Dear Wife:--\r\n    Elizabeth, our daughter, writes to me\r\n    That she intends to have some friends to tea;\r\n    She says she can't invite them all,\r\n    Because our house is much too small,\r\n    But she selected just a few,\r\n    The ones she thinks are dearest most to you.\r\n    She intends to celebrate, for mother dear,\r\n    The birthday of her eightieth year,\r\n    And she requests that I shall write to thee,\r\n    What she is pleased to call some poetry,\r\n    And that because I can't be there\r\n    She'll read it from my vacant chair.\r\n    She also writes, that while your health is good,\r\n    That very lately she has understood\r\n    That you are suffering some distress,\r\n    And I must buy for you a new silk dress,\r\n    And send it there together with the poetry,\r\n    That she could have them both in time for tea.\r\n\r\n    The journey has been very long my dear,\r\n    And you have safely reached your eightieth year,\r\n    But you will never seem so old to me,\r\n    I still recall your face just as it used to be.\r\n    Your brow is smooth, your eyes are bright,\r\n    You still retain your appetite.\r\n    This human life doth now as ever\r\n    Depend so much upon the liver.\r\n    Some sixty years ago, I knew\r\n    A fair young girl, she looked like you.\r\n    We fell in love, a youthful dream,\r\n    But even now, this world would seem\r\n    A barren waste, if I could doubt\r\n    The love I could not live without.\r\n    'Tis more than fifty years since we were wed,\r\n    How rapidly the time has fled.\r\n    The way has not been always smooth,\r\n    I only cite the fact to prove\r\n    Our love was true. That is to say\r\n    We found some shadows o'er our way.\r\n    But they were shadows only, and did not bother,\r\n    For reaching out our hands to touch each other\r\n    We kept the path until the light\r\n    Shone out again and all was right.\r\n    We've had our joy, our grief and sorrow,\r\n    Differed today, agreed tomorrow,\r\n    Forgave each other and repented,\r\n    Firm one day, the next relented,\r\n    But after all the truth to tell\r\n    I think we've averaged very well.\r\n    'Tis almost four and fifty years\r\n    Since you, with many sighs and tears,\r\n    Bade farewell to home and friends,\r\n    Not knowing what your life might be,\r\n    With only faith in God and love for me.\r\n    I'm thinking of the time gone by,\r\n    When from your home, both you and I\r\n    Came west to seek and make a home\r\n    That we might claim and call our own.\r\n    Without our kindred, friends or wealth,\r\n    We started forth with youth and health.\r\n    Whate'er we have, whate'er we've gained\r\n    We know we've honestly obtained,\r\n    And we grew strong in faith and hope,\r\n    And never thought of giving up.\r\n    To our store we added day by day,\r\n    And faithful friends have joined us on our way.\r\n    No woman ever bore a son\r\n    More true and faithful than our one,\r\n    And when he grew to man's estate\r\n    And sought and found a worthy mate,\r\n    We got our daughter ready grown\r\n    And took and loved her for our own.\r\n    But there's another blessing yet\r\n    And one we never can forget:\r\n    Our dearest Laurence--\r\n    The only grandchild we have left,\r\n    Since of the other one bereft;\r\n    But there is also present here\r\n    A cherub from another sphere.\r\n    He comes to us from realms above,\r\n    Drawn hither by the power of love.\r\n    We can but feel his presence here\r\n    To honor Grandma's eightieth year.\r\n    I do not know how many more\r\n    Of birthdays you may have in store.\r\n    It is not within our ken to know,\r\n    Just how much further you may have to go\r\n    Before you reach the end.\r\n    But whether near or far,\r\n    We all will meet you at the \"Gates Ajar.\"\r\n\r\nIn my younger days I had been accustomed somewhat occasionally to\r\nindulge myself in the attempt of writing what out of courtesy to my\r\nliterary qualifications might be called poetry, though my life was too\r\nbusy a life to indulge much in sentiment or even to indulge much in\r\nimagination. Some time the year before I wrote this for my wife's\r\nbirthday, I composed and wrote the following for the benefit of the\r\nEarly Settler's Association of Polk county, which was sung with\r\nconsiderable enthusiasm at several of their picnic celebrations. The\r\nsong is sung to the tune of \"John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the\r\ngrave,\" and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    The early settlers' picnic has come around again,\r\n    And here we are together the few that still remain,\r\n    To exchange our hearty greetings and to join in this refrain,\r\n        As we go marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--Glory, glory, hallelujah,\r\n                      Glory, glory, hallelujah,\r\n                      Glory, glory, hallelujah,\r\n                      We still are marching on.\r\n\r\n    'Tis many years ago since we all came out west\r\n    To grow up with the country that is now the very best.\r\n    God gave the soil and climate and the settlers did the rest\r\n        When they came marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--\r\n\r\n    We left our homes in yonder for the far off Iowa.\r\n    We came and saw her beauty and settled down to stay,\r\n    And there's not a soul among us that has ever rued the day\r\n        When we came marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--\r\n\r\n    This is the land of promise where the milk and honey flow,\r\n    With corn and pumpkin plenty, and where pies and puddings grow,\r\n    With every other blessing that nature can bestow\r\n        As we go marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--\r\n\r\n    We may seem a little older for our heads are silvered o'er,\r\n    But our hearts are still as young as they were in days of yore,\r\n    And we still recount the blessings the future has in store\r\n        As we go marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--\r\n\r\n    This is a goodly land where we have lived and loved together;\r\n    We have borne the heat of Summer and faced the coldest weather.\r\n    Glory, hallelujah! our Iowa forever!\r\n        We still are marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--\r\n\r\n    Our nation is united as it never was before,\r\n    All are happy and contented with old glory floating o'er.\r\n    We are coming Father Abraham with many millions more,\r\n        We all are marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--\r\n\r\n    Our column is unbroken though some have gone before,\r\n    They have passed across the river and have reached the shining shore,\r\n    And are waiting there to greet us as they did in days of yore\r\n        When we were marching on.\r\n\r\n              Chorus--",
