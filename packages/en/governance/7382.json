DILKE\r\nBART., M.P.\r\n\r\nBEGUN BY STEPHEN GWYNN, M.P.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETED AND EDITED BY\r\nGERTRUDE M. TUCKWELL.\r\n\r\nIN TWO VOLUMES\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Life of Sir Charles W. Dilke consists mainly of his own\r\nMemoirs and of correspondence left by him or furnished by his friends.\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs were compiled by Sir Charles Dilke from his private diaries\r\nand letters between the years 1888 and his return to Parliament in 1892.\r\nThe private diaries consisted of entries made daily at the dates dealt\r\nwith. Of the Memoirs he says: \"These notes are bald, but I thought it best\r\nnot to try, as the phrase goes, 'to write them up.'\" In some cases the\r\nMemoirs have been condensed into narrative, for Sir Charles says of the\r\nperiods his \"notes\" cover: \"These chapters contain everything that can be\r\nused, and more than is needed, and changes should be by way of 'boiling\r\ndown.'\" The Memoirs were unfinished. He writes in May, 1893: \"From this\r\ntime forward I shall not name my speeches and ordinary action in the\r\nHouse, as I had now regained the position which I held up to 1878, though\r\nnot my position of 1878-1880, nor that of 1884-85;\" and as from this point\r\nonwards there are few entries, chapters treating of his varied activities\r\nhave been contributed by those competent to deal with them.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's will, after giving full discretionary powers to his\r\nliterary executrix, contains these words: \"I would suggest that, as\r\nregards those parts relating to Ireland, Egypt, and South Africa, the same\r\nshall be made use of (if at all) without editing, as they have been agreed\r\nto by a Cabinet colleague chiefly concerned.\" A further note shows that,\r\nso far as Ireland was concerned, the years 1884-85 cover the dates to\r\nwhich Sir Charles Dilke alludes. The part of the Memoirs dealing with\r\nthese subjects has therefore been printed _in extenso_, except in the case\r\nof some detailed portions of a discussion on Egyptian finance.\r\n\r\nThe closing words of this part of Sir Charles Dilke's will point out to\r\nhis executrix that \"it would be inconsistent with my lifelong views that\r\nshe should seek assistance in editing from anyone closely connected with\r\neither the Liberal or Conservative party, so as to import into the\r\npublications any of the conventional attitude of the old parties. The same\r\nobjection will not apply to members of the other parties.\" In consequence\r\nof this direction, Mr. Stephen Gwynn, M.P., whose name was among those\r\nsuggested by Sir Charles Dilke, was asked to undertake the work of\r\narranging the Memoirs, and supplementing them where necessary. This work\r\nwas already far advanced when Mr. Gwynn joined the British forces on the\r\noutbreak of the War. His able and sympathetic assistance was thus\r\nwithdrawn from the work entailed in the final editing of this book--a work\r\nwhich has occupied the Editor until going to press.\r\n\r\nA deep debt of gratitude is due to Mr. Spenser Wilkinson, who has\r\ncontributed the chapters on \"The British Army\" and \"Imperial Defence.\" Sir\r\nGeorge Askwith was good enough, amidst almost overwhelming pressure of\r\npublic duties, to read and revise the chapter entitled \"The Turning-\r\nPoint.\" Sir George Barnes and Sir John Mellor have also freely given\r\nexpert advice and criticism. Mrs. H. J. Tennant, Miss Constance Smith, Mr.\r\nE. S. Grew, Mr. H. K. Hudson and Mr. John Randall have given much valuable\r\nassistance. The work of reading proofs and verifying references was made\r\neasy by their help.\r\n\r\nWhile thanking all those who have placed letters at her disposal, the\r\nEditor would specially acknowledge the kindness with which Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain has met applications for leave to publish much correspondence.\r\n\r\nMr. John Murray's great experience has made his constant counsel of the\r\nutmost value; and from the beginning to the close of the Editor's task the\r\nliterary judgment of the Rev. W. Tuck well has been placed unsparingly at\r\nher service. Sir H. H. Lee and Mr. Bodley, who were Sir Charles Dilke's\r\nofficial secretaries when he was a Minister, have given her useful\r\ninformation as to political events and dates.\r\n\r\nTo the many other friends, too numerous to name, who have contributed\r\n\"recollections\" and aid, grateful acknowledgments must be made.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Editor expresses her warmest thanks to Lord Fitzmaurice, who\r\nhas laid under contribution, for the benefit of Sir Charles Dilke's Life,\r\nhis great knowledge of contemporary history and of foreign affairs,\r\nwithout which invaluable aid the work of editing could not have been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papers from which the following Memoir is written were left to my\r\nexclusive care because for twenty-five years I was intimately associated\r\nwith Sir Charles Dilke's home and work and life. Before the year 1885 I\r\nhad met him only once or twice, but I recall how his kindness and\r\nconsideration dissipated a young girl's awe of the great political figure.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1885, when my aunt, Mrs. Mark Pattison, married Sir Charles,\r\nI was constantly with them, acting from 1893 as secretary in their trade-\r\nunion work. Death came to her in 1904, and till January, 1911, he fought\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days there was much young life about the house. Mrs. H. J.\r\nTennant, that most loyal of friends, stands out as one who, hardly less\r\nthan I, used to look on 76, Sloane Street, as a home. There is no need to\r\nbear witness to the happiness of that home. _The Book of the Spiritual\r\nLife_, in which are collected my aunt's last essays, contains also the\r\nMemoir of her written by her husband, and the spirit which breathes\r\nthrough those pages bears perfect testimony to an abiding love.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the house was one of work, and the impression left upon\r\nthe mind was that no life was truly lived unless it was largely dedicated\r\nto public service. To the labours of his wife, a \"Benedictine, working\r\nalways and everywhere,\" Sir Charles bears testimony. But what of his own\r\nlabours? \"Nothing will ever come before my work,\" were his initial words\r\nto me in the days when I first became their secretary. Through the years\r\nrealization of this fact became complete, so that, towards the last,\r\nremonstrances at his ceaseless labour were made with hopeless hearts; we\r\nknew he would not purchase length of life by the abatement of one jot of\r\nhis energy. He did not expect long life, and death was ever without terror\r\nfor him. For years he anticipated a heart seizure, so that in the complete\r\nordering of his days he lived each one as if it were his last.\r\n\r\nThe house was a fine school, for in it no waste of force was permitted. He\r\nhad drilled himself to the suppression of emotion, and he would not\r\ntolerate it in those who worked with him except as an inspiration to\r\naction. \"Keep your tears for your speeches, so that you make others act;\r\nleave off crying and think what you can do,\" was the characteristic rebuke\r\nbestowed upon one of us who had reported a case of acute industrial\r\nsuffering. He never indulged in rhetoric or talked of first principles,\r\nand one divined from chance words of encouragement the deep feeling and\r\npassion for justice which formed the inspiration of his work.\r\n\r\nHe utilized every moment. The rapidity of his transition from one kind of\r\nwork to another, and his immediate concentration on a subject totally\r\ndifferent from that which he had previously handled, were only equalled by\r\nthe rapidity with which he turned from work to play.\r\n\r\nWith the same unerring quickness he would gather up the contents of a book\r\nor appreciate the drift of a question. This latter characteristic, I fear,\r\noften disconcerted disputants, who objected to leave their nicely turned\r\nperiods incomplete because he had grasped the point involved before they\r\nwere halfway through a sentence; but his delight in finding this same\r\nrapidity of thought in others was great, and I remember his instancing it\r\nas a characteristic of Mr. Asquith.\r\n\r\nHis wide grasp of every question with which he dealt was accompanied by so\r\ncomplete a knowledge of its smallest details that vague or inaccurate\r\nstatements were intolerable to him; but I think the patience with which he\r\nsifted such statements was amongst the finest features in the discipline\r\nof working under him. One felt it a crime to have wasted that time of\r\nwhich no moment was ever deliberately wasted by himself.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which he approached his work was one of detachment from all\r\npersonal considerations; the introduction of private feuds or dislikes\r\ninto public service was a thing impossible to him and to be severely\r\nrebuked in those who helped him. He never belittled antagonists,\r\nunderrated his opponents' ability, or hesitated to admit a mistake. Others\r\nwill testify in the pages which follow to the warmth and generosity of his\r\nfriendship, but that which stands out in memory is his forbearance to his\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nJust as his knowledge was complete in its general grasp as in its smallest\r\ndetail, so was his sympathy all-embracing. No suffering, says the\r\nSecretary of the Anti-Sweating League, was too small for his help; the\r\nearly atrocities of Congo misrule did not meet with a readier response\r\nthan did the wrongs of some heavily fined factory girl or the sufferings\r\nof the victim of a dangerous trade.\r\n\r\nFor his own achievements he was curiously regardless of fame. He gave\r\nungrudgingly of his knowledge to all who claimed his help and direction,\r\nand he trained many other men to great public service. In Mr. Alfred\r\nLyttelton's happy phrase, he possessed \"rare self-effacement.\" There are\r\nmany instances in his early career of this habit of self-effacement, and\r\nthe habit increased with years. Remonstrance met with the reply: \"What\r\ndoes it matter who gets the credit so long as the work is done?\"\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that we who love him shall ever bear in affectionate\r\nmemory those who brought his laurels home to him in their celebration of\r\nthe passing of the Trade Boards Act in 1910--that first instalment of the\r\nprinciple of the minimum wage, on which he united all parties and of which\r\nhe had been the earliest advocate.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of his public life that he knew too much and interested\r\nhimself in too many things; but those coming after who regard his life as\r\na whole will see the connecting link which ran through all. I can speak\r\nonly of that side of his activities in which I served him. He saw the\r\ncause of labour in Great Britain as it is linked with the conditions of\r\nlabour throughout the globe; his fight against slavery in the Congo, his\r\nconstant pressure for enlightened government in India, his championship of\r\nthe native races everywhere, were all part and parcel of the objects to\r\nwhich he had pledged himself from the first. For progress and development\r\nit is necessary that a country should be at peace, and his study of\r\nmilitary and naval problems was dictated by the consideration of the best\r\nmeans under existing conditions to obtain that end for England.\r\n\r\nYet to imagine that his life was all work would be to wrong the balance of\r\nhis nature. He turned from letters and papers to his fencing bout, his\r\nmorning gallop, or his morning scull on the river, with equal enthusiasm,\r\nand his great resonant boyish laugh sounded across the reach at Dockett or\r\nechoed through the house after a successful \"touch.\" His keenness for\r\nathletic exercises, dating from his early Cambridge days, lasted, as his\r\nwork did, to the end. In spite of the warnings of an overtaxed heart, he\r\nsculled each morning of the last summer at Dockett, and in Paris he handed\r\nover his foils to his fencing-school only a month before his death,\r\nleaving, like Mr. Valiant-for-Truth before he crossed the river, his arms\r\nto those who could wield them. It was well for him; he could not have\r\nborne long years of failing strength and ebbing mental energy. Anything\r\nless than life at its full was death to him.\r\n\r\nReleased from work, he was intensely gay, and his tastes were sufficiently\r\nsimple for him to find enjoyment everywhere. He loved all beautiful\r\nthings, and, though he had seen everything, the gleam of the sinking sun\r\nthrough the pine aisles at his Pyrford cottage would hold him spellbound;\r\nand in summer he would spend hours trying to distinguish the bird notes,\r\nnaming the river flora, or watching the creature life upon the river\r\nbanks. So in the Forest of Dean, that constituency which he loved well and\r\nwhich well deserved his love, his greatest pleasure was to set himself as\r\nguide to all its pleasant places, rehearsing the name of each blue hill on\r\nthe far horizon, tracing the windings and meeting of the rivers, loving\r\nall best, I think, when the ground was like a sea of bluebells and\r\nanemones in the early year. He watched eagerly each season for the first\r\nsigns of spring, and when he was very ill he told me that it must ever be\r\na joy untouched by advancing years. But indeed he had in him the heart of\r\nthe spring. I think it was largely this simple love of nature which kept\r\nhim always strong and sweet even after the deep blow of his wife's death\r\nin 1904.\r\n\r\nWherever he was, life took on warmth and colour. Travel with him was a\r\nrevelation, trodden and hackneyed though the road might be. In his vivid\r\nnarrative the past lived again. Once more troops fought and manoeuvred as\r\nwe passed through stretches of peaceful country which were the\r\nbattlefields of France; Provence broke on us out of a mist of legendary\r\nlore, the enchantment deepening as we reached the little-traversed\r\nhighlands near the coast--those Mountains of the Moors where in past days,\r\n_connu comme le loup blanc_ among the people, he had wandered on foot with\r\nhis old Provençal servant before motors and light railways were.\r\n\r\nHis care for the _Athenaeum_, inspired by the more than filial love he\r\nbore his grandfather, its earlier proprietor, led to continual reading and\r\nreviewing, and he would note with interest those few Parliamentarians who,\r\nkeeping themselves fresh for their work of routine by some touch with the\r\nworld of Literature, thereby, as he phrased it, \"saved their souls.\"\r\n\r\nOf the events which cut his public life asunder it is sufficient to say\r\nhere that those nearest him never believed in the truth of the charges\r\nbrought, finding it almost inconceivable that they should have been made;\r\nwhile the letters and records in my hands bear testimony to that great\r\nouter circle of friends, known and unknown, who have expressed by spoken\r\nor by written word, in public and in private, their share in that absolute\r\nbelief in him which was a cardinal fact of our work and life.\r\n\r\nThe fortitude which gave to his country, after the crash of 1886, twenty-\r\nfive years of tireless work, was inspired, for those who knew him best, by\r\nthat consciousness of rectitude which holds a man above the clamour of\r\ntongues, and finds its reward in the fulfilment of his life's purpose.\r\n\r\n\"To have an end, a purpose, an object pursued through all vicissitudes of\r\nfortune, through heart's anguish and shame, through humiliation and\r\ndisaster and defeat--that is the great distinction, the supreme\r\njustification of a life.\" So wrote his wife in her preface for _The Shrine\r\nof Death_.\r\n\r\nThe service of his country was the purpose of his life. Nor was that life\r\njustified alone by his unswerving pursuit of its great aim; it was\r\njustified also in its fulfilment, for his service was entirely fruitful--\r\nhe wrested success from failure, gain from loss.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that in 1886 the nation lost one who would have been\r\namong its greatest administrators. Yet when we look back on all that was\r\ninspired and done by him, on the thousand avenues of usefulness into which\r\nhis boundless energy was directed, there is no waste, only magnificent\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nAn independent critic both by pen and speech inside and outside the House\r\nof Commons, the consolidator of whatever Radical forces that chamber held,\r\nthe representative of labour before the Labour Party was, he stood for all\r\nthe forces of progress, and when his great figure passed into the silence\r\nhis place was left unfilled.\r\n\r\nOne writing for an African journal the record of his funeral, dreamed that\r\nas the strains of the anthem poured their blessings on \"him that hath\r\nendured,\" there rose behind the crowd which gathered round him dead a\r\ngreater band of mourners. \"A vast unseen concourse of oppressed mankind\r\nwere there, coming to do homage to one who had ever found time, amidst his\r\nmanifold activities, to plead their cause with wisdom, unfailing\r\nknowledge, and with keen sympathy of heart.\"\r\n\r\nI commit his memory to the people whom he loved and served.\r\n\r\nG.

That bare justice may be done, it is necessary not only\r\nto follow out his openly recorded successes, things done in his own name\r\nand of his own right, but also to disentangle, as far as may be, the part\r\nwhich his authority, his knowledge, and his ceaseless industry played in\r\nframing and securing measures whose enactment redounded to the credit of\r\nother men. But above all, since a man's personality signifies far more\r\nthan his achievements, and this man stands before the world overshadowed\r\nby a dishonouring accusation, it is necessary to establish by facts and by\r\ntestimony not so much what he did as what he was.\r\n\r\nYet it must not be supposed that he himself counted his career among\r\nlife's failures. The record will tell of close and affectionate family\r\nties; of a wonderfully vivid and varied experience acquired in many lands\r\nand through many phases of activity; and, even in his blackest hour, of a\r\nnoble love retained and richly repaid. No trace will be found of a nature\r\nsoured or warped by balked ambition, nor any resentful withdrawal from the\r\npublic stage.\r\n\r\nIn the story that has to be told, proof will emerge indisputably that,\r\nwithout affected indifference to the prizes of a public career, his\r\npassion was for work, not for its attendant honours; that he valued office\r\nas an opportunity to advance, not himself, but the causes which he had at\r\nheart; and that when further tenure of power was denied him, he abated no\r\njot of his lifelong labours. The main purpose of his life was 'to revive\r\ntrue courage in the democracy of his country,' [Footnote: Throughout these\r\nvolumes single quotation marks without further indication signify an\r\nexcerpt from the Manuscript Memoir (compiled by Sir Charles, as explained\r\nin the Preface, from original diaries and letters), or (as here) from\r\nnotes left with that document, but not embodied in it. Double quotation\r\nmarks signify Correspondence and Memoranda found in the despatch-cases and\r\nletters sent by correspondents, etc.] and his immediate object always and\r\neverywhere to defend the weak. For the protection of toilers from their\r\ntaskmasters at home and abroad, in the slums of industrial England and in\r\nthe dark places of Africa, he effected much directly; but indirectly,\r\nthrough his help and guidance of others, he effected more; and in the\r\nrecognition of his services by those for whom he worked and those who\r\nworked with him he received his reward.\r\n\r\nCharles Wentworth Dilke was born into a family of English gentlefolk,\r\nwhich after a considerable period of comparative obscurity had won back\r\nprosperous days. The baronetcy to which he succeeded was recent, the\r\nreward of his father's public services; but a long line of ancestors\r\nlinked him to a notable landed stock, the Dilkes of Maxstoke.\r\n\r\nThis family was divided against itself in the Civil Wars; and the brother\r\nof the inheritor of Maxstoke, Fisher Dilke, from whom Sir Charles\r\ndescended, was a fanatical Puritan, and married into a great Puritan\r\nhouse. His wife, Sybil Wentworth, was granddaughter to Peter Wentworth,\r\nwho led the Puritan party of Elizabeth's reign: she was sister to Sir\r\nPeter Wentworth, a distinguished member of Cromwell's Council of State.\r\nProperty was inherited through her under condition that the Dilke heirs to\r\nit should assume the Wentworth name; and in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies Fisher Dilke's descendants were Wentworth Dilke or Dilke\r\nWentworth from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn George II.'s reign one Wentworth Dilke was clerk to the Board of Green\r\nCloth at Kew Palace: his only son, Wentworth Dilke Wentworth, was\r\nsecretary to the Earl of Litchfield of the first creation, and left an\r\nonly son, Charles Wentworth Dilke, who was a clerk in the Admiralty. This\r\nDilke was the first of five who successively have borne this combination\r\nof names. [Footnote: For convenience a partial table of descent is\r\ninserted, showing the five Dilkes who bore the same combination of names.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE, b. 1742, d. 1826.\r\n    ---------------------------------------------\r\n    |                                           |\r\nCharles Wentworth Dilke = Maria Dover   William Dilke, b. 1796,\r\nb. 1789, d. 1864.      |     Walker.                    d. 1885.\r\n                       |\r\n                       |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  |                                                     |\r\nCharles Wentworth Dilke = M.

So\r\npotent was this influence in moulding the life which has to be chronicled,\r\nthat it is necessary to give some clear idea of the person who exercised\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. Dilke--who shall be so called to distinguish him from his son\r\nWentworth Dilke, and from his grandson Charles Dilke--at an early period\r\nadded the pursuit of literature to his duties as a civil servant. By 1815,\r\nwhen he was only twenty-six, Gifford, the editor of the _Quarterly\r\nReview_, already spoke highly of him; and between that date and 1830 he\r\nwas contributing largely to the monthly and quarterly reviews. In 1830 he\r\nacquired a main share in the _Athenaeum_, a journal 'but just born yet\r\nnevertheless dying,' and quickly raised it into the high position of\r\ncritical authority which it maintained, not only throughout his own life,\r\nbut throughout his grandson's. So careful was Mr. Dilke to preserve its\r\nreputation for impartial judgment, that during the sixteen years in which\r\nhe had virtually entire control of the paper, he withdrew altogether from\r\ngeneral society \"in order to avoid making literary acquaintances which\r\nmight either prove annoying to him, or be supposed to compromise the\r\nindependence of his journal.\" [Footnote: From _Papers of a Critic_, a\r\nselection of Mr. Dilke's essays, edited, with a memoir, by Sir Charles\r\nDilke, See _infra_, p. 184.]\r\n\r\nAfter 1846 the editorship of the _Athenaeum_ was in other hands, but the\r\nproprietor's vigilant interest in it never abated, and was transmitted to\r\nhis grandson, who continued to the end of his days not only to write for\r\nit, but also to read the proofs every week, and repeatedly for brief\r\nperiods to act as editor.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1846 Mr. Dilke curtailed his work on the _Athenaeum_, it was to\r\ntake up other duties. For three years he was manager of the recently\r\nestablished _Daily News_, working in close fellowship with his friends\r\nJohn Forster and Charles Dickens.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when he gave up this task till his death in 1864 Mr. Dilke's\r\nlife had one all-engrossing preoccupation--the training of his grandson\r\nCharles. But to the last, literary research employed him. In 1849 he\r\nhelped to establish _Notes and Queries_ 'to be a paper in which literary\r\nmen could answer each other's questions'; and his contributions to this\r\npaper [Footnote: Its founder and first editor, Mr. W. J. Thorns\r\n(afterwards Librarian of the House of Lords), had for three years been\r\ncontributing to the _Athenaeum_ columns headed \"Folk-Lore\"--a word coined\r\nby him for the purpose. The correspondence which grew out of this\r\nthreatened to swamp other departments of the paper, and so the project was\r\nformed of starting a journal entirely devoted to the subjects which he had\r\nbeen treating. Mr. Dilke, being consulted, approved the plan, and lent it\r\nhis full support. In 1872, when Mr. Thorns retired from control of the\r\npaper, Sir Charles Dilke bought it, putting in Dr. Doran as editor; and\r\nthenceforward it was published from the same office as the _Athenaeum_.]\r\nand to the _Athenaeum_ never ceased; though so unambitious of any personal\r\nrepute was he that in all his long career he never signed an article with\r\nhis own name, nor identified himself with a pseudonym. A man of letters,\r\nhe loved learning and literature for their own sake; yet stronger still\r\nthan this love was his desire to transmit to his heirs his own gathered\r\nknowledge, experience, and convictions.\r\n\r\nHe had become early 'an antiquary and a Radical,' and this combination\r\nrightly indicated unusual breadth of sympathy. The period in which he was\r\nborn favoured it: for, keen student as he was of the eighteenth century--\r\npreserving in his own style, perhaps later than any other man who wrote in\r\nEngland, that dignified but simple manner which Swift and Bolingbroke had\r\nperfected--he yet was intimately in touch with the young genius of an age\r\nin revolt against all the eighteenth-century tradition. Keats, only a few\r\nyears his junior, was his close friend; so was John Hamilton Reynolds, the\r\ncomrade of Keats, and author of poems known to every student of that\r\nliterary group. Thomas Hood and Charles Lamb had long and near association\r\nwith him. Lover of the old, he had always an open heart for the new; and,\r\nbookish though he was, no one could be less a bookworm. The antiquary in\r\nhim never mastered the Radical: he had an unflagging interest in the large\r\nfacts of life, an undying faith in human progress. Slighting his own\r\nlifework as he evidently did--for he never spoke of it to his son or his\r\nson's son--he was yet prompted by instinct to kindle and tend a torch\r\nwhich one after him should carry, and perhaps should carry high. It would\r\nbe difficult to name any man who had a stronger sense of the family bond.\r\n\r\nHe had married very young--before he was nineteen--Maria Dover Walker, the\r\nbeautiful daughter of a Yorkshire yeoman, still younger than he. This\r\ncouple, who lived together \"in a most complete happiness\" for forty years,\r\nhad one child only, born in 1810, Charles Wentworth Dilke, commonly called\r\nWentworth. [Footnote: _Papers of a Critic_, vol. i., p. 13.] Mr. Dilke\r\nsent his son to Westminster, and removed him at the age of sixteen,\r\narranging--because his theory of education laid great stress on the\r\nadvantage of travel--that the lad should live for a while with Baron\r\nKirkup, British Consul and miniature painter, in Florence, as a\r\npreparatory discipline before going to Cambridge. What he hoped and\r\nintended is notably expressed in a letter written by him at Genoa on his\r\nreturn journey to his son in Florence in 1826: [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 18.]\r\n\r\n    \"I ought to be in bed, but somehow you are always first in my thoughts\r\n    and last, and I prefer five minutes of gossiping with you.... How,\r\n    indeed, could it be otherwise than that you should be first and last\r\n    in my thoughts, who for so many years have _occupied all_ my thoughts.\r\n    For fifteen years at least it has been my pleasure to watch over you,\r\n    to direct and to advise. Now, direct and personal interference has\r\n    ceased.... It is natural, perhaps, that I should take a greater\r\n    interest than other fathers, for I have a greater interest at stake. I\r\n    have _but one _son. That son, too, I have brought up differently from\r\n    others, and if he be not better than others, it will be urged against\r\n    me, not as a misfortune, but as a shame. From the first hour I never\r\n    taught you to believe what I did not myself believe. I have been a\r\n    thousand times censured for it, but I had that confidence in truth\r\n    that I dared put my faith in it and in you. And you will not fail me.\r\n    I am sure you will return home to do me honour, and to make me respect\r\n    you, as I do, and ever shall, love you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a singular letter for a man of thirty-seven to write--singular in\r\nits self-effacement before the rising generation, singular, too, in the\r\nintensity of its forecast. Yet, after all, a measure of disappointment was\r\nto be his return for that first venture. The son to whom so great a cargo\r\nof hopes had been committed was a vigorous lad, backed when he was fifteen\r\n'to swim or shoot or throw against any boy of his age in England,' and he\r\ndeveloped these and kindred energies, accepting culture only in so far as\r\nit ministered to his fine natural faculty for enjoyment. He acquired a\r\nknowledge of Italian and of operatic music at Florence; but when\r\nafterwards at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he was, to his father's despair,\r\nvery idle, and during his early years in London 'was principally known to\r\nhis friends for never missing a night at the Opera.'\r\n\r\nThat interest in things of the mind which he could hardly have failed to\r\ninherit had made of him a dilettante rather than a scholar; but later he\r\nbecame very active in promoting those ideals which appealed to his taste.\r\nHe had a shrewd business eye, and showed it in founding the _Gardeners'\r\nChronicle_ and the _Agricultural Gazette_, both paying properties. He had,\r\nmoreover, a talent for organization, and a zeal in getting things done,\r\nacknowledged in many letters from persons of authority in their\r\nrecognition of those services to the International Exhibitions of 1851 and\r\n1862 which were rewarded by his baronetcy. An interesting National\r\nExhibition of 'Art Manufactures' had already been held by the Society of\r\nArts, on whose Council Wentworth Dilke was an active worker, at the time\r\nwhen he, with two other members of the Council and the secretary, Mr.\r\nScott Russell, met the Prince Consort on June 30th, 1849, and decided to\r\nrenew the venture on a scale which should include foreign nations. When\r\nthe executive committee of four (to whom were added a secretary and a\r\nrepresentative of the contractors) was named in January, 1850, the work\r\npractically fell on three persons--Sir William Reid communicating with the\r\npublic departments, Mr. Henry Cole settling questions of space and\r\narrangement, [Footnote: Mr. Cole, afterwards Sir Henry Cole, K.C.B., was,\r\nsays the Memoir, 'commonly known as King Cole,' and was afterwards\r\nsecretary to the South Kensington School of Design.] and Wentworth Dilke\r\n'having charge of the correspondence and general superintendence,' and\r\nattending 'every meeting of the executive except the first.'\r\n\r\nWentworth Dilke worked hard for this and for other objects. But his public\r\nactivities had to be fitted in with a great deal of shooting and other\r\nsport at Alice Holt, the small house in Hampshire, with adjacent\r\npreserves, which he rented, and which became the family's country home.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 he married, and, after the birth of Charles Wentworth Dilke, the\r\nsubject of this Memoir, on September 4th, 1843, all the grandfather's\r\nthought centred on the child. His daughter-in-law became, from then till\r\nher death, his chief correspondent, and the master of the house was\r\n'completely overshadowed' in the family group.\r\n\r\nThat group was so large as to be almost patriarchal. Wentworth Dilke, when\r\nhe married, and established himself at 76, Sloane Street, took under his\r\nroof his wife's mother, Mrs. Chatfield, her grandmother, Mrs. Duncombe,\r\nand also her unmarried cousin, Miss Folkard. All these ladies lived out\r\ntheir lives there, Mrs. Chatfield and Miss Folkard surviving till Charles\r\nDilke had become a Minister of State.\r\n\r\nUp to 1850 old Mr. Dilke and his wife lived at their house in Lower\r\nGrosvenor Place, which was a second home for their grandson Charles. But\r\nin 1850 the wife died, and Mr. Dilke 'spent sixteen months in wandering\r\nthrough the remoter parts of Scotland, and along the north and west coast\r\nof Ireland, but corresponded ceaselessly with his daughter-in-law, to whom\r\nhe was much attached.' During a great part of this time he was accompanied\r\nby his grandson. Mrs. Wentworth Dilke, after giving birth in 1850 to her\r\nsecond child, Ashton Dilke, had 'fallen into a deep decline'; and Charles\r\nDilke, at the age of seven, was handed over to his grandfather's charge,\r\npartly to solace the old widower's loneliness, partly to relieve the\r\nstrain on his mother.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar relation between grandfather, mother, and son, stands out\r\nclearly from the letter which that mother wrote shortly before her death\r\nin September, 1853, to be delivered to the boy Charles. After some tender\r\nexhortation, she added:\r\n\r\n    \"But moral discipline your grandfather will teach you. What I wish\r\n    particularly to impress on you is the _necessity_ of worshipping God.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the end:\r\n\r\n    \"My own boy, there is another thing still to name, for none can say\r\n    whether this letter may be required soon, or whether I may have the\r\n    delight of seeing my children grow up, but this last and cherished\r\n    subject is my little Ashton. When he is old enough, dear, to\r\n    understand, let him read this letter, and by his mother's blessing\r\n    teach him to think and feel that all that I have said applies equally\r\n    to him. Set him a good example in your own conduct, and be always\r\n    affectionate brothers.\"\r\n\r\nOf the father, not a word--and for care of the younger boy, the dying\r\nwoman's hope is in his brother. It will be shown how studiously the ten-\r\nyear-old boy, on whom his mother so leant, fulfilled that charge. But he\r\nhimself felt, in later life, that scant justice had been done to the man\r\nwho was 'overshadowed' in his home, and wrote in 1890:\r\n\r\n    'My father loved my grandfather deeply, but my grandfather was greatly\r\n    disappointed in him, and always a little hard towards him: my father\r\n    suffered through life under a constant sense of his inferiority. He\r\n    suffered also later from the fact that while his elder son was the\r\n    grandfather's and not the father's boy, his younger son was as\r\n    completely under my influence in most matters, as I was under the\r\n    influence of my grandfather.'\r\n\r\nYet in a sense the relation between old Mr. Dilke and the son whom he\r\nunconsciously slighted was strangely intimate and confiding. For in 1853\r\nthe elder man gave up his own house in Lower Grosvenor Place, made over\r\nall his money to his son, and came to live under the son's roof in Sloane\r\nStreet for the remainder of his life. His confidence in the patriarchal\r\nprinciple justified itself. 'My father,' writes Sir Charles, 'for eleven\r\nyears consulted his father--dependent on him for bread--in every act of\r\nhis life.'\r\n\r\nTo the world at large, Wentworth Dilke was a vastly more important person\r\nthan the old antiquary and scholar. After his services in organizing the\r\nGreat Exhibition of 1851, he declined a knighthood and rewards in money;\r\nbut he accepted from the French Government a gift of Sèvres china; from\r\nthe King of Saxony, the Collar of the Order of Albertus Animosus; from the\r\nKing of Sweden and from the Prince Consort, medals; and from Queen\r\nVictoria, a bracelet for his wife. These remained among the treasures of\r\n76, Sloane Street. But he acquired something far more important in the\r\nestablishment of friendly relations with persons of mark and influence all\r\nover the Continent; for these relations were destined to be developed by\r\nCharles Dilke, then a pretty-mannered boy, who was taken everywhere, and\r\nsaw, for instance, in 1851, the Duke of Wellington walk through the\r\nExhibition buildings on a day when more than a hundred thousand people\r\nwere present. He could remember how the Duke's 'shrivelled little form'\r\nand 'white ducks' 'disappeared in the throng which almost crushed him to\r\ndeath' before the police could effect his rescue.\r\n\r\nWentworth Dilke's association in the Prince Consort's most cherished\r\nschemes had brought him on a footing of friendship with the Royal Family;\r\nand on July 25th, 1851, his wife wrote that the Queen had come over and\r\ntalked to her in the Exhibition ground. Long afterwards, when the pretty-\r\nmannered boy had grown into a Radical, who avowed his theoretical\r\npreference for republican institutions, Queen Victoria said that \"she\r\nremembered having stroked his head, and supposed she had stroked it the\r\nwrong way.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Charles as a child from the miniature by Fanny Corbin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest memory that Sir Charles Dilke could date was 'of April 10th,\r\n1848, when the Chartist meeting led to military preparations, during which\r\nI' (a boy in his fifth year) 'saw the Duke of Wellington riding through\r\nthe street, attended by his staff, but all in plain clothes.' In 1850 'No\r\nPopery chalked on the walls attracted my attention, but failed to excite\r\nmy interest'; he was not of an age to be troubled by the appointment of\r\nDr. Wiseman to be Archbishop of Westminster. In 1851 he was taken to a\r\nmeeting to hear Kossuth.\r\n\r\nFrom this year--1851--date the earliest letters preserved in the series of\r\nthirty-four boxes which contain the sortings of his vast correspondence.\r\nThere is a childish scrap to his grandfather, and a long letter from the\r\ngrandfather to him written from Dublin, which lovingly conjures up a\r\npicture of the interior at Sloane Street, with 'Cousin' (Miss Folkard)\r\nstirring the fire, 'Charley-boy' settling down his head on his mother's\r\nlap, and 'grandmamma' (his mother's mother, Mrs. Chatfield) sitting in the\r\nchimney-corner.\r\n\r\nFor the year 1852 there are no letters to the boy; it was the time of his\r\nmother's failing health, and he was journeying with his grandfather all\r\nover England, 'reading Shakespeare, and studying church architecture,\r\nespecially Norman.' It was a delightful way of learning history for a\r\nquick child of nine:\r\n\r\n'We followed Charles II. in his flight, and visited every spot that has\r\never been mentioned in connection with his escape--a pilgrimage which took\r\nme among other places to my future constituency of the Forest of Dean. We\r\nwent to every English cathedral, and when my grandfather was at work upon\r\nhis Pope investigations, saw every place which was connected with the\r\nhistory of the Carylls.' [Footnote: John Caryll suggested to Pope the idea\r\nof the \"Rape of the Look\"; and many of the poet's letters were written to\r\nhis son, a younger John Caryll. They were an ancient and distinguished\r\nRoman Catholic family, devoted partisans of, and centres of correspondence\r\nwith, the exiled Stuarts.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dilke combined his desire to instruct the child with the frankest\r\ninterest in his play. Here, for instance, is a letter to Charles of\r\nOctober 15th, 1853:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR OLD ADMIRAL,\r\n\r\n    \"Hope you found all right and tight: a gallant vessel--tackle trim--\r\n    noble crew of true blue waters--guns shining and serving for looking--\r\n    glasses to shave by--powder dry--plenty in the locker. Wishing you\r\n    favourable gales,\r\n\r\n    \"I remain,\r\n\r\n    \"Your old friend and rough and tough\r\n\r\n    \"GRANDFATHER.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth while giving the reply--precocious for a boy of ten:\r\n\r\n    \"BEDHAMPTON,\r\n    \"HAVANT,\r\n    \"_October 16th, 1853._\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR GRANDPAPA,\r\n\r\n    \"We arrived quite safely on Friday night, and were astonished to find\r\n    that my Aunt and Uncle and Cousin Letitia were gone to Brighton and\r\n    then to Hastings, and Godpapa had a letter this morning to say that\r\n    they found it so hot at Hastings that they went on to Folkestone, and\r\n    they are there now. The Admiral has to report for the information of\r\n    his Cockney readers that he hoisted his Flag yesterday at the main\r\n    peak. The weather was, however, so windy and wet that after hiding\r\n    himself with his honoured father under the cuddy for half an hour, the\r\n    Admiral thought that prudence was part of his duty, therefore struck\r\n    his Pocket-handkerchief and retired to luncheon. A Salute from a black\r\n    cloud hastened his departure.\r\n\r\n    \"Your affectionate grandson,\r\n\r\n    \"C. W. DILKE.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was his grandfather's to educate, and there has not often been\r\nsuch an education. A man ripe in years, still vigorous--for Mr. Dilke was\r\nonly fifty-three when his elder grandson was born--yet retired from the\r\nbusiness of life, and full of leisure, full of charm, full of experience,\r\nfull of knowledge, devoted his remaining years to the education of his\r\ngrandson. It may be held that he created a forcing-house of feeling, no\r\nless than of knowledge, under which the boy's nature was prematurely drawn\r\nup; but there can be no doubt as to the efficacy of the method. It was not\r\ncoddling--Mr. Dilke was too shrewd for that--and if at a certain stage it\r\nseemed as though excessive stimulus had been given, maturity went far to\r\ncontradict that impression.\r\n\r\n    'After my mother's death I began classics and mathematics with Mr.\r\n    Bickmore, at that time a Chelsea curate and afterwards Vicar of\r\n    Kenilworth. At the same time I took charge of teaching letters to my\r\n    brother. I had few child friends, and used to see more of grown-up\r\n    people, such as Chorley, [Footnote: Musical critic for the\r\n    _Athenaeum._] Thackeray, and Dickens, of whom the latter was known to\r\n    us as \"young Charles Dickens,\" owing to my great-grandfather having\r\n    known \"Micawber.\"'\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Dilke's father had been employed in the Admiralty along with the\r\nfather of Dickens. As for Thackeray, it was probably about this time that\r\nhe came on the boy stretched out upon grass in the garden of Gore House,\r\nresting on elbows, deep in a book, and looked over his shoulder. \"Is it\r\nany good?\" he asked. \"Rather!\" said the boy. \"Lend it me,\" said Thackeray.\r\nThe book was _The Three Musketeers_, and we all know _The Roundabout\r\nPapers_ which came out of that loan.\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke had his free run of novels as a boy, and not of novels only.\r\nIn 1854, when he was only eleven:\r\n\r\n    'I began my regular theatre-going, which became a passion with me for\r\n    many years, and burnt itself out, I may add, like most passions, for I\r\n    almost entirely ceased to go near a theatre when I went to Cambridge\r\n    at nineteen. Charles Kean, and Madame Vestris, and Charles Mathews,\r\n    were my delight, with Wright and Paul Bedford at the Adelphi, Webster\r\n    and Buckstone at the Haymarket, and Mrs. Keeley. Phelps came later,\r\n    but Charles Kean's Shakespearian revivals at the Princess's from the\r\n    first had no more regular attendant. My earliest theatrical\r\n    recollection is Rachel.\r\n\r\n    'I was a nervous, and, therefore, in some things a backward child,\r\n    because my nervousness led to my being forbidden for some years to\r\n    read and work, as I was given to read and work too much, and during\r\n    this long period of forced leisure I was set to music and drawing,\r\n    with the result that I took none of the ordinary boy's interest in\r\n    politics, and never formed an opinion upon a political question until\r\n    the breaking-out of the American Civil War when I was eighteen. I then\r\n    sided strongly with the Union, as I showed at the Cambridge Union when\r\n    I reached the University. Even in this question, however, I only\r\n    followed my grandfather's lead, although, for the first time, in this\r\n    case intelligently. So far indeed as character can be moulded in\r\n    childhood, mine was fashioned by my grandfather Dilke.'\r\n\r\nIt was not only character that Mr. Dilke formed. He made the boy the\r\nconstant companion of his own intellectual pursuits, imbued him deeply\r\nwith his own tastes, his own store of knowledge. In the summer of 1854 he\r\nhad taken his pupil to 'Windsor, Canterbury, Rochester, Bury St. Edmunds,\r\nSt. Albans, and many other interesting towns.' That autumn the pair went\r\nto France together--apparently the beginning of Charles Dilke's close\r\nacquaintance with that country, which was extended in the following year,\r\n1855, when Wentworth Dilke was named one of the English Commissioners for\r\nthe French International Exhibition, and took his family to live in Paris\r\nfrom April to August.\r\n\r\n    'We were all with him at Paris for some time, and I acquired a\r\n    considerable knowledge of the antiquities of the town, before the\r\n    changes associated with the name of Haussmann, by rambling about it\r\n    with my grandfather, who, however, soon got sick of Paris and went\r\n    home to his books, while we remained there for four months. I was at\r\n    the party given at the Quai d'Orsay by Walewski, the son of Napoleon;\r\n    at that given at the \"Legion of Honour\" by Flahaut, the father of\r\n    Morny; at the Ball at the Hôtel de Ville to the Emperor and Empress\r\n    and Queen Victoria; at the review; and at the Queen's entry and\r\n    departure. The entry was the finest display of troops which I ever\r\n    witnessed, as the National Guard of the City and its outskirts turned\r\n    out in great form, and raised the numbers to 120,000, while the\r\n    costumes both of the Guard and of the National Guard were very showy.\r\n    There paraded also two hundred veterans of the wars of the First\r\n    Empire in all the uniforms of the period. I heard Lablache in his last\r\n    great part, and in this year I think I also saw Rachel for the last\r\n    time; but I had seen her in England, I believe, in 1853. I certainly\r\n    had seen her in a part in which many years later I remember Sarah\r\n    Bernhardt, and can recall Rachel well enough to be able to institute a\r\n    comparison entirely to Rachel's advantage.\r\n\r\n    'After our visit to Paris in 1855 my brother and I had taken to\r\n    speaking and to writing to one another in French, and this practice we\r\n    kept up until his death, even when he was Member of Parliament for\r\n    Newcastle-on-Tyne, and I a member of the Government.'\r\n\r\nOne memory of that year never left Sir Charles Dilke. In the evenings he\r\nused to go to the Place Vendôme to hear the Guards' combined tattoo. Every\r\nregiment was represented, and the drummers were a wonderful show in their\r\ndifferent brilliant uniforms--Chasseurs of the Garde, Dragoons, Lancers,\r\nVoltigeurs, and many more. In the midst was the gigantic sergeant-major\r\nwaiting, with baton uplifted, for the clock to strike. At the first stroke\r\nhe gave the signal with a twirl and a drop of his baton, and the long\r\nthundering roll began, taken up all round the great square. Sir Charles,\r\nas he told of this, would repeat the tambour-major's gesture; and the\r\nboy's tense, eager look of waiting, and flash of satisfaction when the\r\nroll broke out, revived on the countenance of the man.\r\n\r\n    'In 1856 I became half attached to a day-school, which had for its\r\n    masters, in mathematics a Mr. Acland, a Cambridge man, and in classics\r\n    a Mr. Holme, a fellow of Durham, and for several years I used to do\r\n    the work which they set in the school without regularly attending the\r\n    school, which, however, my brother attended. My health at that time\r\n    was not supposed to be sufficiently strong to enable me even to attend\r\n    a day-school, and still less to go to a public school; but there was\r\n    nothing the matter with me except a nervous turn of mind,\r\n    overexcitable and overstrained by the slightest circumstance. This\r\n    lasted until I was eighteen, when it suddenly disappeared, and left me\r\n    strong and well; but the form which this weakness took may be\r\n    illustrated by the fact that, although I did not believe in ghosts, I\r\n    have known myself at the age of sixteen walk many miles round to avoid\r\n    passing through a \"haunted\" meadow.'\r\n\r\nAlso he made the experiments in literature common with clever lads:\r\n\r\n    'In 1856 I wrote a novel called _Friston Place_, and I have a sketch\r\n    which I made of Friston Place in Sussex in August of that year, but\r\n    the novel I have destroyed, as it was worthless.'\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of his education is recalled by drawings preserved in the\r\nboxes from 1854 onwards--conscientious delineations of buildings visited,\r\nrepresenting an excellent training for the eye and observation.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 his grandfather took him to Oxford (where he rambled happily about\r\nthe meadows while Mr. Dilke read in the Bodleian) and to Cambridge, going\r\non thence to Ely, Peterborough, and Norwich. Later in the same year the\r\npair travelled all over South Wales, everywhere rehearsing the historical\r\nmemories of the place, everywhere mastering the details of whatever\r\narchitecture presented itself.\r\n\r\nEach return home brought experiences of a different kind. 'I have known,'\r\nhe says, 'everyone worth knowing from 1850 to my death.' At seven years\r\nold he was seeing and hearing the famous persons of that time, either at\r\nthe home in Sloane Street, to which Wentworth Dilke's connection with the\r\nExhibition drew men eminent in the world of physical science and\r\nindustrial enterprise, as well as the artists with whom his\r\nconnoisseurship brought him into touch; or else at old Mr. Dilke's house\r\nin Lower Grosvenor Place. He remembered visits with his grandfather to\r\nGore House, 'before Soyer turned it into the Symposium,' and to Lady\r\nMorgan's. The brilliant little Irishwoman was a familiar friend, and her\r\npen, of bog-oak and gold, the gift to her of the Irish people, came at\r\nlast to lie among the treasures of 76, Sloane Street. Also there remained\r\nwith him\r\n\r\n    \"memories from about 1851 of the bright eyes of little Louis Blanc, of\r\n    Milner-Gibson's pleasant smile, of Bowring's silver locks, of\r\n    Thackeray's tall stooping figure, of Dickens's goatee, of Paxton's\r\n    white hat, of Barry Cornwall and his wife, of Robert Stephenson the\r\n    engineer, to whom I wanted to be bound apprentice, of Browning (then\r\n    known as 'Mrs. Browning's husband'), of Joseph Cooke (another\r\n    engineer), of Cubitt the builder (one of the promoters of the\r\n    Exhibition), of John Forster the historian, of the Redgraves, and of\r\n    that greater painter, John Martin. Also of the Rowland Hills, at\r\n    Hampstead.\r\n\r\n    \"1859 was the height of my rage for our South Kensington Trap-Bat\r\n    Club, which I think had invented the name South Kensington. It was at\r\n    it that I first met Emilia Francis Strong. We played in the garden of\r\n    Gore House where the Conservatory of the Horticultural Society, behind\r\n    the Albert Hall, was afterwards built.\"\r\n\r\nIn the memoir of the second Lady Dilke, prefixed to _The Book of the\r\nSpiritual Life_, Sir Charles writes of this time, 1859 to 1860, when he\r\n\"loved to be patronized by her, regarding her with the awe of a\r\nhobbledehoy of sixteen or seventeen towards a beautiful girl of nineteen\r\nor twenty.\" But at one point she bewildered him; for in those days Emilia\r\nStrong was devout to the verge of fanaticism:\r\n\r\n    \"We were all puzzled by the apparent conflict between the vitality and\r\n    the impish pranks of the brilliant student, expounding to us the most\r\n    heterodox of social views, and the 'bigotry' which we seemed to\r\n    discern when we touched her spiritual side.\" [Footnote: _Book of the\r\n    Spiritual Life_, Memoir, p. 10.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the fastings and mortifications which Emilia Strong practised at\r\nthat period of her youth would seem 'bigotry' to a lad brought up under\r\ninfluences which, in so far as theology entered into them, had an\r\nEvangelical bent. Charles Dilke thus summed up his early prepossessions\r\nand practices in this respect:\r\n\r\n    'My mother had been a strong Low Church woman, and those of her\r\n    letters which I have destroyed very clearly show that her chief fear\r\n    in meeting death was that she would leave me without that class of\r\n    religious training which she thought essential. My grandfather and my\r\n    father, although both of them in their way religious men (and my\r\n    grandfather, a man of the highest feeling of duty), were neither of\r\n    them churchgoers, nor of her school of thought; and ... as I was till\r\n    the age of twenty a regular church attendant and somewhat devout for a\r\n    boy of that age, it was a grief to me to find that my brother's turn\r\n    of mind as he grew up was different, and that he naturally thought his\r\n    judgment on the subject as good as that of the mother whom he had lost\r\n    at three years old, and could hardly be said to have known.'\r\n\r\nBut the true spiritual influence on Charles Dilke's early life was derived\r\nfrom his grandfather, whose nature had in it much of the serenity and wise\r\nhappiness which go to the making of a saint. This influence was no doubt\r\nethical in its character rather than religious; but it can be traced, for\r\nexample, in a humane scruple which links it with Dilke's affectionate cult\r\nof St. Francis of Assisi:\r\n\r\n    'In 1856 I had begun to shoot, my father being passionately fond of\r\n    the sport, and I suppose that few people ever shot more before they\r\n    were nineteen than I did. But about the time I went to Cambridge I\r\n    found the interference with my work considerable, and I also began to\r\n    have doubts as to considerations of cruelty, and on points affecting\r\n    the Game Laws, which led me to give up shooting, and from 1862 I\r\n    hardly ever shot at all, except, in travelling, for food.'\r\n\r\nThe taste for travel, always in search of knowledge, but followed with an\r\nincreasing delight in the quest, began for him in the rovings through\r\nEngland with his grandfather. As early as his seventeenth year he was out\r\non the road by himself; and this letter written from Plymouth, April 5th,\r\n1860 after a night spent at Exeter, indicates the results of his training:\r\n\r\n    \"This morning we got up early, and went to the Northerny [Footnote:\r\n    Northernhay, or Northfield, a pleasure-ground at Exeter.] and\r\n    Cathedral. Nothing much. Took the train at quarter before ten. Railway\r\n    runs along the shore under the cliffs and in the cliffs. We saw a\r\n    rather large vessel wrecked on the sands. Teignmouth pretty. Got to\r\n    Totnes before twelve. Hired a boat and two men, 10s. 6d. Down the\r\n    river to Dartmouth, twelve miles. The Dart is more like a series of\r\n    lakes than a river; in some of the reaches it is impossible to see\r\n    what way you are to get out. Very like the Wye until you get low down,\r\n    then it opens into a lake about two miles across, free from all mud,\r\n    nothing but hills and cliffs. Then it again contracts, and passes\r\n    through a gorge, which is said to be very like parts of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n    \"The scene here is splendid. Dartmouth now comes, but the river,\r\n    instead of spreading and becoming ugly, as most tidal rivers do,\r\n    remains narrow and between cliffs, until you have the great sea waves\r\n    thundering up against them. Dartmouth contains a church more curious\r\n    than half the cathedrals in the kingdom: Norman (Late), fine brasses,\r\n    barrel roof with the paint on, and stone pulpit painted, etc., etc.\r\n    There are some very fine old houses also. The place is the most lovely\r\n    by far of any that I ever saw--Paradise.\r\n\r\n    \"We have had a bad day--real Devonshire--where they say that they must\r\n    have one shower every day and two on Sundays. 'Shower' means about six\r\n    hours' quiet rain, _vide_ 'Murray' and our experience of to-day. The\r\n    boatmen say 'it rains most days.' I hope Mrs. Jackson is going on\r\n    well. Trusting you are all well, I send my love to all and remain\r\n\r\n    \"Your affectionate grandson,\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES W. DILKE.\"\r\n\r\nA scrap from one of the grandfather's letters, April 25th, 1859, which\r\npoints to the terms of intellectual equality that existed in the\r\ncorrespondence between the two, has also some historical interest:\r\n\r\n    \"Hope your news of the French troops landing in Genoa is premature.\r\n    War, however, seems inevitable; but I hope on, hope ever. I should be\r\n    sorry to see the Austrians triumph over the Sardinians, for then they\r\n    would fasten the chains on Italy tighter than ever. Yet I cannot hope\r\n    that the worst man in Europe, the Emperor of the French, should\r\n    triumph.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1860, the lad set out on a more adventurous excursion to\r\nFrance, in a storm of snow so tremendous that trains were blocked in many\r\nplaces. However, he reached Amiens safely, saw and described it dutifully,\r\nthen made for Paris.\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke's familiarity with France was destined to be extended year\r\nby year till the end of his life. This visit of Christmas 1860 was the\r\nfirst which he made alone to that country; but part of the summer of 1859\r\nhad been spent by him with his family at Trouville, whence he wandered\r\nover Normandy, adding detail to his knowledge of Norman architecture.\r\n\r\nBut even stronger than the interest in historic architecture which his\r\ngrandfather had imparted to him was the interest in men and affairs; above\r\nall, in those men who had assisted at great events. Throughout his life\r\nhis love of travel, his taste for society, and his pursuit of first-hand\r\ninformation upon political matters helped to enlarge his list of\r\nremarkable acquaintances; and during this stay in France a new name was\r\nadded to the collection of celebrities:\r\n\r\n    'At Havre I got to know King Jerome, father to \"Plon-Plon\" and father-\r\n    in-law to my friend Princess Clothilde, and was duly interested in\r\n    this last of the brothers of Napoleon. The ex-King of Westphalia was a\r\n    wicked old gentleman; but he did not let a boy find this out, and he\r\n    was courteous and talkative. We long had in both years, I think, the\r\n    next rooms to his at Frascati's; and he used to walk in the garden\r\n    with me, finding me a good listener. The old Queen of Sweden was still\r\n    alive, and he told me how Désirée Clary [Footnote: Eugénie Bernardine\r\n    Désirée Clary married, August 16th, 1798, Marshal Jean-Baptiste\r\n    Bernadotte, afterwards Charles XIV., King of Sweden. Her elder sister\r\n    Julie had become the wife of Joseph Bonaparte in 1794.] had thrown\r\n    Bonaparte over for him, and then had thrown him over for Bernadotte.\r\n    He also described riding through Paris with Bonaparte on the day of\r\n    Brumaire.'\r\n\r\nHaving completely outgrown the nervous invalidishness of his earlier\r\nboyhood, Dilke at eighteen years of age was extending his activities in\r\nall directions.\r\n\r\n    'In 1861 I find by my diaries that I was at the very height of my\r\n    theatre-going, attending theatres in Paris and in London with equal\r\n    regularity; and in this year I wrote an elaborate criticism of\r\n    Fechter's Hamlet, which is the first thing I ever wrote in the least\r\n    worth reading, but it is not worth preservation, and has now been\r\n    destroyed by me. At Easter, 1861, I walked to Brighton in a single day\r\n    from London, and the next day attended the volunteer review. I was a\r\n    great walker, and frequently walked my fifty miles within the day. My\r\n    interest in military affairs continued, and I find among my letters of\r\n    1861 passages which might have formed part of my writings on military\r\n    subjects of 1887 to 1889. I went down to see the new Tilbury forts,\r\n    criticized the system of the distribution of strength in the Thames\r\n    defences, advocated \"a mile of vigorous peppering as against a slight\r\n    dusting of feathers every half-hour\"; and went to Shoeburyness to see\r\n    the trial of the Whitworth guns.'\r\n\r\nHis cousin, William Wentworth Grant Dilke, was Captain and Adjutant of the\r\n77th Regiment, and Charles Dilke remembered the young officer's visit to\r\nbid good-bye before he departed for the Crimea, where he met his death.\r\n\r\nThough old Mr. Dilke had sympathized with the wonderful manoeuvres of the\r\nchild's armies of leaden soldiers, and had added to them large\r\nreinforcements, he became troubled by his grandson's keen and excited\r\nfollowing of all the reports from the Crimea. He had a terror of the boy's\r\nbecoming a soldier, and 'used to do his best to point out the foolish side\r\nof war.' But this, as the passage already quoted shows, did not deter his\r\npupil from beginning, while still a growing youth, detailed study of\r\nmilitary matters.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, an undergraduate going up to an English\r\nUniversity without public school friendships is at a disadvantage: and\r\nthis was Charles Dilke's case. But he went to his father's college,\r\nTrinity Hall; and his father was a very well known and powerfully\r\nconnected man. Offer of a baronetcy had been made to Wentworth Dilke in\r\nvery unusual and gratifying terms. General Grey, the Queen's secretary,\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    \"ST. JAMES'S PALACE,\r\n    \"_January 1st_, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR DILKE,\r\n\r\n    \"The Queen cannot forget for how many years you have been associated\r\n    with her beloved husband in the promotion of objects which were dear\r\n    to his heart; and she would fain mark her sense of the valuable\r\n    assistance you have ever given him in his labours in some manner that\r\n    would be gratifying to your feelings.\r\n\r\n    \"I am therefore commanded by Her Majesty to express the hope that the\r\n    offer of a Baronetcy which she has informed Lord Palmerston of her\r\n    desire to confer upon you, coming direct from Her Majesty herself, and\r\n    as her own personal act, may be one which it will be agreeable to you\r\n    to accept.\"\r\n\r\nProof of the Queen's strong feeling for the man who had been so closely\r\nassociated with the Prince Consort in his work of popularizing the arts\r\nand crafts had already been given by the fact that Wentworth Dilke was,\r\nexcept for those whom she was obliged to meet on business, the first\r\nperson from the outside world whom she saw after the Prince Consort's\r\ndeath. And indeed, but for his sense of a personal graciousness in the\r\noffer, Wentworth Dilke would scarcely have departed from his lifelong\r\nhabit of deference to his father's wish and judgment. Old Mr. Dilke,\r\nthough gratified by the compliment, wrote to a friend:\r\n\r\n    \"My son's fortune is not strong enough to enable his children to carry\r\n    such a burthen with ease; and as to the waifs and strays which it may\r\n    help them to, I would rather see them fight their good fight\r\n    unshackled.\"\r\n\r\nThere came a time when the baronetcy was something of an encumbrance to\r\none of these children:\r\n\r\n    'When I was accused of attacking the Queen, which I never did,\r\n    somebody--I forget who--went further, and said I had \"bitten the hand\r\n    which fed me,\" and I really believe that this metaphor expressed\r\n    publicly a private belief of some people that my father had made money\r\n    by his labours. All I can say is that he never made a farthing by them\r\n    in any form at any time, and that in '51 and in '62 he spent far more\r\n    than his income on entertainments.... He wished for no reward, and he\r\n    knew the conditions under which his life was given to public rather\r\n    than to private service: but he killed himself at it; he left me much\r\n    less rich than I should otherwise have been, and it is somewhat hard\r\n    to find myself told that if I call attention to notorious illegalities\r\n    I am \"biting the hand that fed me.\" The Queen herself has, as I happen\r\n    to know, always spoken in a very different sense.'\r\n\r\nThe newly made Baronet, in the course of his labours for the second\r\nGreat Exhibition, added to his already very numerous friendships.\r\n\r\n    'My father's chief foreign friends in '62 were Prince Napoleon,\r\n    Montésinos, Baron Schwartz (Austria), Baron von Brünen von Grootelind\r\n    (Holland), Prince Oscar (afterwards King of Sweden), and Senator\r\n    Fortamps (Belgium).'\r\n\r\nFinally, there is this entry, written in 1890:\r\n\r\n    'Just as I had made the acquaintance of the Duke of Wellington through\r\n    father in the Exhibition of 1851, so I made that of Palmerston in the\r\n    Exhibition of 1862. He was still bright and lively in walk and talk,\r\n    and was extremely kind in his manner to me, and asked me to one of\r\n    Lady Palmerston's Saturday nights at Cambridge House, to which I duly\r\n    went. I should think that there is no one living but myself who was at\r\n    the Ball to the Queen at the Hotel de Ville in 1855, at the famous\r\n    Guards' Ball in 1862, and also at one of Lady Palmerston's evenings.'\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke matriculated at Trinity Hall in October 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke was sent in 1862, as in later days he sent his own son, to\r\nhis father's college. Trinity Hall in the early sixties was a community\r\npossessing in typical development the combination of qualities which\r\nCambridge has always fostered. Neither very large nor very small, it had\r\ntwo distinguishing characteristics: it was a rowing college, and it was a\r\ncollege of lawyers. Although not as a rule distinguished in the Tripos\r\nLists, it was then in a brilliant period.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir will show that in Dilke's first year a Hall man was Senior\r\nWrangler, and that the boat started head of the river. Such things do not\r\nhappen without a cause; and the college at this moment numbered on its\r\nstaff some of the most notable figures in the University. The Vice-Master,\r\nBen Latham, for thirty-five years connected with the Hall, was of those\r\nmen whose reputation scarcely reaches the outside world; but he had found\r\nthe college weak, he had made it strong, and he was one of the\r\ninstitutions of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAmong the junior Fellows were Fawcett and Leslie Stephen. Both were\r\nprofound believers in hard tonic discipline of mind and body, inculcating\r\ntheir belief by doctrine and example; and both, with great diversity of\r\ngifts, had the rough strong directness of intellectual attack which\r\nCambridge, then perhaps more than at any other time, set in contrast to\r\nthe subtleties of Oxford culture.\r\n\r\nLeslie Stephen in particular, who had been a tutor and who was still a\r\nclerical Fellow, made it his business to meet undergraduates on their own\r\nground. Hard work and hard bodily exercise--but, above all, hard bodily\r\nexercise--made up the gospel which he preached by example. No one ever did\r\nmore to develop the cult of athletics, and there is no doubt that he\r\nthought these ideals the best antidote to drunkenness and other vices,\r\nwhich were far more rife in the University of that day than of this.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Fawcett were strenuous Radicals, and contact with them was\r\nwell fitted to infuse fresh vitality into the political beliefs which\r\nCharles Dilke had assumed by inheritance from his grandfather. In these\r\nways of thought he met them on ground already familiar and attractive to\r\nhim. His introduction to Fawcett was at the Economics and Statistics\r\nSection of the British Association, which he attended at Cambridge in the\r\nfirst week of his first term. \"I am one of the few people who really enjoy\r\nstatistics,\" he said, long years after this, in a presidential address to\r\nthe Statistical Society. But it was early at nineteen to develop this\r\nexceptional taste.\r\n\r\nIn another domain of modern thought these elder men affected his mind\r\nconsiderably and with a new order of ideas. Old Mr. Dilke seems to have\r\nleft theology out of his purview altogether; and it was at Cambridge that\r\nCharles Dilke first met the current of definitely sceptical thought on\r\nreligious matters.\r\n\r\nFawcett was aggressively unorthodox. But far more potent was the influence\r\nof Leslie Stephen, then with infinite pain struggling under the yoke that\r\nhe had taken on himself at ordination, and had not yet shaken off. The\r\neffect of Stephen's talk--though he influenced young men as much by his\r\ndry critical silence as by his utterances--was heightened by admiration\r\nfor his athletic prowess. He coached the college Eights: anyone who has\r\nbeen at a rowing college will realize how commanding an ascendancy is\r\nimplied. But his athletics covered every phase of muscular activity; and\r\nFawcett joined him in encouraging the fashion of long walks.\r\n\r\nAnother of the long-walkers whom the Memoir notes as among the chief\r\ninfluences of those days was Leslie Stephen's pupil Romer, the Admirable\r\nCrichton of that moment--oarsman, cricketer, and Trinity Hall's hope in\r\nthe Mathematical Tripos. The future Lord Justice of Appeal was then\r\nreading for the Tripos, in which he was to be Senior Wrangler; and,\r\naccording to Cambridge custom, took a certain amount of coaching as part\r\nof his work. Charles Dilke was one of those whom he instructed, and it was\r\nthe beginning of a friendship which lasted many years.\r\n\r\nLooking back, Sir Robert Romer says that most undergraduates are simply\r\ngrown-up boys, and that at Trinity Hall in his day there was no variation\r\nfrom this type till Dilke came there--a lad who, to all appearance, had\r\nnever associated with other lads, whose companions had been grown-up\r\npeople, and who had mature ideas and information on everything. But,\r\nthrown among other young men, the young man found himself with surprising\r\nrapidity. Elements in his nature that had never been brought out developed\r\nat once; and one of these was a great sense of fun. Much stronger than he\r\nlooked, he plunged into athletics with a perfectly simple delight.\r\n\"Nobody,\" says Sir Robert Romer, \"could make more noise at a boating\r\nsupper.\" This frank natural glee remained with him to the end. Always\r\ndisputatious, always a lover of the encounter of wits, he had none the\r\nless a lifelong gift for comradeship in which there was little clash of\r\ncontroversy and much hearty laughter.\r\n\r\nOne of the eight-and-twenty freshmen who matriculated at Trinity Hall\r\nalong with Charles Dilke in 1862 was David Fenwick Steavenson, a dalesman\r\nfrom Northumberland, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. The two had\r\nseemingly little in common. Dilke to all appearance was \"very serious,\"\r\nand in disposition of mind ten years older than his fellows, while the\r\nyoung Northumbrian's whole preoccupation was to maintain and enlarge the\r\nfame of his college on the river. If the friendship was to develop,\r\nSteavenson must undoubtedly become interested in intellectual matters, but\r\nnot less certainly Dilke must learn to row. It was a very useful\r\ndiscipleship for the future politician. Sloping shoulders, flat and narrow\r\nchest, height too great for his build: these were things that Cambridge\r\nhelped to correct. Dilke, a willing pupil, was diligently coached by the\r\nstronger man, until he became an accomplished and effective oar. In\r\ngeneral Judge Steavenson's recollection confirms Sir Robert Romer's, and\r\ngives precision to one detail. In their second year, upon the occasion of\r\nsome triumph on the river, there was to be a bump supper, but the college\r\nauthorities forbade, whereupon an irregular feast was arranged--this one\r\nbringing a ham, that a chicken, and so on. When the heroes had put from\r\nthem desire of eating and drinking, they sallied out, and after a vigorous\r\ndemonstration in the court, proceeded to make music from commanding\r\nwindows. It was Charles Dilke who had provided the whistles and toy drums\r\nfor this ceremony, and Judge Steavenson retains a vision of the future\r\nstatesman at his window [Footnote: Dilke's rooms were on Staircase A, on\r\nthe first floor, above the buttery. They have not for very many years been\r\nlet to an undergraduate, as they are too near the Fellows' Combination\r\nRoom.] blowing on a whistle with all his might. The authorities were\r\nvindictive, and Dilke suffered deprivation of the scholarship which he had\r\nwon at the close of his freshman year.\r\n\r\nSuch penalties carry no stigma with them. It should be noted, too, that at\r\na period of University history when casual excess in drink was no\r\nreproach, but rather the contrary, Charles Dilke, living with boating men\r\nin a college where people were not squeamish, drank no wine. Judge\r\nSteavenson adds that the dislike of coarse talk which was marked with him\r\nlater was equally evident in undergraduate days.\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke's own ambition and industry were reinforced by the keen\r\nanxiety of his people. Concealing nothing of their eagerness for him to\r\nwin distinction, those who watched his career with such passionate\r\ninterest set their heart, it would seem, on purely academic successes. Sir\r\nWentworth Dilke may well have feared, from his own experience, that old\r\nMr. Dilke's expectations might again be disappointed by a student who\r\nfound University life too full of pleasure. At all events it was to his\r\nfather that the freshman wrote, October 24th, 1862, a fortnight after he\r\nhad matriculated:\r\n\r\n    \"I am very sorry to see by your letter of this morning that you have\r\n    taken it into your head that I am not reading hard. I can assure you,\r\n    on the contrary, that I read harder than any freshman except Osborn,\r\n    who takes no exercise whatever; and that I have made the rowing-men\r\n    very dissatisfied by reading all day three days a week. On the other\r\n    three I never read less than six hours, besides four hours of lectures\r\n    and papers. I have not missed reading a single evening yet since I\r\n    have been here; that is, either from six, or seven, till eleven,\r\n    except Saturday at Latham's. This--except for a fourth-year man--is\r\n    more than even the tutors ask for.... I hope I have said enough to\r\n    convince you that you are entirely wrong; what has made you so has\r\n    been my account of breakfasts, which are universal, and neither\r\n    consume time nor attract attention. I was at one this morning--I left\r\n    my rooms at twenty-five minutes to nine, and returned to them at five\r\n    minutes to nine, everything being over.\"\r\n\r\nThis scrupulous economy of time was to be characteristic of Charles\r\nDilke's whole life, and nothing impressed his contemporaries more at all\r\ntimes than the \"methodical bee-like industry\" attributed to him by the\r\npresent Master of Trinity Hall. Mr. Beck, who came up to the college just\r\nafter Dilke left it, thus expands the impression:\r\n\r\n    \"There remained in Trinity Hall in 1867 a vivid tradition that he was\r\n    one of the few men who never lost a minute, would even get in ten\r\n    minutes of work between river and Hall (which was in those days at\r\n    five o'clock); and much resembled the Roman who learned Greek in the\r\n    time saved from shaving. On the doorpost inside his bedroom over the\r\n    Buttery there remained in pencil the details of many days of work thus\r\n    pieced together.\" [Footnote: _Cambridge Review_, February 2nd, 1911.]\r\n\r\nJudge Steavenson recalls how he used to be \"bundled out\" of his friend's\r\nrooms the instant that the appointed hour for beginning to read had\r\narrived, and he did his best to mitigate the strenuousness of that\r\napplication. But there were stronger influences at work than his: Sir\r\nWentworth Dilke was fully satisfied with the assurance he had received, as\r\nwell he might be; but the grandfather never ceased to enforce the claims\r\nof study. He wrote ceaselessly, but with constant exhortations that he\r\nshould be answered only when work and play allowed.\r\n\r\nWhen the letters from Cambridge told of success in athletics, he\r\nresponded, but with a temperate rejoicing. Here, for instance, is his\r\nreference to the news that the freshman had rowed in the winning boat of\r\nthe scratch fours on March 14th, 1863:\r\n\r\n    \"I am glad that you have won your 'pewter'--as I was glad when you\r\n    took rank among the best of the boating freshmen--although I have not\r\n    set my heart on your plying at Blackfriars Bridge, nor winning the\r\n    hand of the daughters of Horse-ferry as the 'jolly young waterman,' or\r\n    old Doggett's Coat and Badge. But all things in degree; and therefore\r\n    I rejoice a hundred times more at your position in the college Euclid\r\n    examination.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking old Mr. Dilke's distaste for all these athletics,\r\nand it was to his father, on this one point more sympathetic, that the\r\nfreshman wrote this characteristic announcement of a great promotion:\r\n\r\n    \"Edwards\" (captain of the Trinity Hall Boat Club) \"has just called to\r\n    inform me that I am to row in the head-of-the-river boat to-\r\n    morrow, and to go into training for it.\r\n\r\n    \"The time wasted if I row in it will not be greater than in the 2nd,\r\n    but there is one difference--namely, that it may make me more sleepy\r\n    at nights. I must read hard before breakfast. Romer--who is my master\r\n    and pastor--tells me of all things to row in it,--this year at all\r\n    events.\"\r\n\r\nHe did row in the May races of his first year, and with so little\r\ndetriment to his work that in the following month he secured the first\r\nmathematical scholarship in the college examination. This triumph may well\r\nhave disposed old Mr. Dilke to accept a suggestion which is recorded in\r\nthe correspondence. On June 2nd it was decided that Trinity Hall should\r\nsend an eight to Henley, and the letter adds: \"I should think my\r\ngrandfather would like to come and stay at or near Henley while I am\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the date fixed, the oarsman had been inducted scholar, and so Mr.\r\nDilke could go with a free heart to see his grandson row in the Grand\r\nChallenge against Brasenose and Kingston, where Trinity Hall defeated\r\nKingston, but were themselves defeated by Brasenose in a very fast race.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in the examination halls and on the river that Charles\r\nDilke was winning reputation. He had joined the Volunteers, and proved\r\nhimself among the crack rifleshots of the University corps; he had won\r\nwalking races, but especially he had begun to seek distinction in a path\r\nwhich led straight to his natural goal.\r\n\r\nThe impression left on Sir Robert Romer's mind was that Dilke came up to\r\nthe University elaborately trained with a view to a political career. This\r\nis to read into the facts a wrong construction; the purpose, if it existed\r\nat all, was latent only in his mind. The training which he had received\r\nfrom his grandfather lent itself admirably, it is true, to the making of a\r\nstatesman; but it was the pupil's temperament which determined the\r\napplication of that rich culture.\r\n\r\nThe first debate which he had the chance to attend at the Union was on\r\nOctober 28th, 1862, the motion being: \"That the cause of the Northern\r\nStates is the cause of humanity and progress, and that the widespread\r\nsympathy with the Confederates is the result of ignorance and\r\nmisrepresentation.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion gained in actuality from the fact that the President of the\r\nUnion was Mr. Everett, son of the distinguished literary man who had been\r\nAmerica's representative in London, and was at this time Secretary of\r\nState in the Federal Government. But the South had a notable ally. Mr.\r\nGeorge Otto Trevelyan, author of some of the best light verse ever written\r\nby an undergraduate, was still in residence, though he had before this\r\ntaken his degree; and he shared in those days the sentimental preference\r\nfor the South. Dilke reported to his grandfather: \"Trevelyan's speech was\r\nmere flash, but very witty.\" \"Mere flash\" the freshman was likely to think\r\nit, for he shared his grandfather's opinions, and gave his first Union\r\nvote for the North--in a minority of 34 against 117. \"Very witty\" it was\r\nsure to be, and its most effective hit was a topical allusion. The Union\r\nSociety of those days had its quarters in what had originally been a\r\nWesleyan chapel--a large room in Green Street, the floor of which is now\r\nused as a public billiard saloon, while the galleries from which applause\r\nand interruption used to come freely now stand empty. There had long been\r\ncomplaint of its inadequacy; Oxford had set the example of a special\r\nedifice, and as far back as 1857 a Building Fund had been started, which,\r\nhowever, dragged on an abortive existence from year to year, a constant\r\nmatter of gibes. 'Can the North restore the Union?' Mr. Trevelyan asked.\r\n'Never, sir; they have no Building Fund'; and the punning jest brought\r\ndown a storm of applause.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Trevelyan, after a year spent in India, came back to England\r\nand to Cambridge gossip in the beginning of 1864, he learnt that this\r\ndespised Building Fund had been taken seriously in hand, that one\r\nundergraduate in particular was corresponding with all manner of persons,\r\nand that this Union also was going to be restored. That was how the\r\npresent Sir George Trevelyan first heard the name of Charles Dilke.\r\n\r\nEven in his earliest term Dilke soon passed out of the rôle of a mere\r\nlistener and critic. The Commissioners of the International Exhibition of\r\n1862 were then being sharply criticized, and on November 25th \"a man of\r\nthe name of Hyndman\" (so the undergraduate's letter described this other\r\nundergraduate, afterwards to be well known as the Socialist writer and\r\nspeaker) moved \"a kind of vote of censure\" upon them. It was natural\r\nenough that Sir Wentworth Dilke's son should brief the defence, and among\r\nthe papers of 1862 is a bundle of \"Notes by me for Everett's speech.\" Next\r\nhe was trying his own mettle; and opposed a motion \"that Prince Alfred\r\nshould be permitted to accept the throne of Greece.\" His own note is:\r\n\r\n    'On the 8th December I made my first speech, advocating a Greek\r\n    Republic, and suggesting that if they must have a King, they had\r\n    better look to the northern nations to supply one. I was named by\r\n    Everett, the President, as one of the tellers in the Division.'\r\n\r\nProbably the speech had been no more of a success than most maiden\r\nspeeches, for Mr. Dilke's letter reads like a consolation:\r\n\r\n    \"The Greek debate I care little about. I would much rather have _read_\r\n    a paper on the subject. _Till a man can write he cannot speak_--\r\n    except, as Carlyle would say, 'in a confused babble of words and\r\n    ideas.'\"\r\n\r\nThe main part of the grandson's letters were concerned with the topics\r\nhandled and the speeches made at the Union.\r\n\r\n    \"_November 7th_, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"How wavering and shortsighted the policy of England in Turco-Grecian\r\n    matters has been of late! Compare Navarino and Sebastopol. Palmerston\r\n    will, if he has his way, oblige the Greeks to continue in much the\r\n    same state of degradation as hitherto, and will go on holding up the\r\n    crumbling Turkish Empire till some rising of Christians occurs at a\r\n    time when we have our hands full and cannot afford to help our 'old\r\n    friend.' Then Turkey-in-Europe will vanish. I do not myself believe in\r\n    the Pan-Slavonic Empire. The Moldavians, Hungarians, and Greeks could\r\n    never be long united; but I think that Greece might hold the whole of\r\n    the coast and mountain provinces without containing in itself fatal\r\n    elements of disunion.\r\n\r\n    \"Brown--No. 3 of our four--broke from his training to-day, and spent\r\n    the whole day with the hounds. That will never do.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dilke in reply did not conceal the amusement which was awakened in him\r\nby the rowing man's deadly seriousness:\r\n\r\n    \"_November 9th_, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"I agree with you. No Browns, no hunting fellows, no divided love!! If\r\n    'a man' goes in 'our boat' he goes in to win. \"Broke from his\r\n    training!\" Abominable! Had he 'broke from his training' when standing\r\n    out for Wrangler, why so be it, _his_ honour only would be concerned;\r\n    but here it is _our_ honour, T. H. for ever, and no fox-hunting!\r\n\r\n    \"After this, the Greek question falls flat on the ears, but I will\r\n    suggest...\"\r\n\r\nand thereupon he goes into hints for research, very characteristic in\r\ntheir thoroughness, ending with a practical admonition:\r\n\r\n    \"Now comes 'The Moral.' As you could not speak on the great Ionian\r\n    question, why not _write_ on it? Write down what you would or could\r\n    have said on the subject. Take two or three hours of leisure and\r\n    quiet; write with great deliberation, but _write on_ till the subject\r\n    is concluded. No deferring, no bit by bit piecework, but all offhand.\r\n    No _correction_, not a word to be altered; once written let it stand.\r\n    Put the Essay aside for a month. Then criticize it with your best\r\n    judgment--the order and sequence of facts, its verbal defects, its\r\n    want or superabundance of illustration, its want or superabundance of\r\n    detail, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter of Dilke's in his freshman year concerns the art of debate:\r\n\r\n    \"What is wanted is common-sense discussion in well-worded speeches\r\n    with connected argument, the whole to be spoken loud enough to be\r\n    heard, and with sufficient liveliness to convince the hearers of the\r\n    speaker's interest in what he is saying. So far as this is oratory, it\r\n    is cultivated (with very moderate success) at the Union.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the ideal here indicated--an accurate analysis of 'the House of\r\nCommons manner'--Charles Dilke never departed, and his grandfather in\r\nreplying eagerly reinforced the estimate:\r\n\r\n    \"I agree to all you say about that same Union, and about the Orators\r\n    and Oratory. I should have said it myself, but thought it necessary to\r\n    _clear the way_. I rejoice that no such preliminary labour was\r\n    required. I agree that even Chatham was a 'Stump'--what he was in\r\n    addition is not our question. I hope and believe he was the last of\r\n    our Stumpers. Burke, so far as he was an Orator, was a Stump and\r\n    something more, and the more may be attributed to the fact that he was\r\n    a practised _writer,_ where Chatham was not, and that he reported his\r\n    own speeches. Latterly his _writings_ were all Stump. I had not\r\n    intended to have written for a week or more, for you have so many\r\n    correspondents and are so punctual in reply that I fear the waste of\r\n    precious time; but I am as pleased with your letter as an old dog-\r\n    fancier when a terrier-pup catches his first rat--it is something to\r\n    see my boy hunt out and hunt down that old humbug Oratory.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke's own mature judgment on the matters concerned was expressed\r\nin a letter to the _Cantab_ of October 27th, 1893:\r\n\r\n    \"The value of Union debates as a training for political life? Yes, if\r\n    they are debates. There is probably little debate in the Union. There\r\n    was little in my time. There is little real debating in the House of\r\n    Commons. But debating is mastery. The gift of debate means the gift of\r\n    making your opinion prevail. Set speaking is useless and worse than\r\n    useless in these days.\"\r\n\r\nDilke was elected to the Library Committee of the Union in his second\r\nterm, and in his third to the Standing Committee. At this moment a\r\ndecision was taken to make a determined effort for new buildings, and it\r\nwas suggested that he should stand for the secretaryship. Declining this\r\nas likely to engross more time than he could spare, he was put forward for\r\nthe Vice-Presidency, and elected at the beginning of October, 1863. His\r\nprominence in the negotiations which followed may be inferred from the\r\nfact that he was re-elected. This was in itself a rare honour; but in his\r\ncase was followed by election and re-election to the Presidency, a record\r\nunique in the Society's annals.\r\n\r\nIt was through this phase of his activity that Charles Dilke took part in\r\nthe general life of the University. At the Union he was closely associated\r\nwith men outside his own college, one of whom, Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice,\r\nwas destined to be a lifelong friend and fellow-worker. But his College\r\nmeant more to him than the University. A conservative in this, he\r\nresented, and resisted later on, all tendencies to make the teaching of\r\nthe place communal by an opening of college lectures to students from\r\nother colleges; he valued the distinctiveness of type which went with the\r\nolder usage, under which he himself was nurtured. Trinity Hall was a\r\nlawyers' college; it had a library specially stored with law books, and it\r\nwas early determined that he should conform to the _genius loci_ so far at\r\nleast as to be called to the Bar. In his first Christmas vacation he began\r\nto eat his dinners at the Middle Temple, where his nomination paper was\r\nsigned by John Forster; and in June, 1863, after he had spent a year at\r\nmathematics and won his college scholarship, he took stock of his\r\nposition, and felt clear as to his own powers. He might, he thought,\r\nattain to about a tenth wranglership in the Mathematical Tripos, which\r\nwould insure him a fellowship at his college; but this, although he valued\r\nacademic distinctions very highly, did not seem an end worth two years of\r\nwork, and he determined to devote the remainder of his time at the\r\nUniversity to the study of law and history.\r\n\r\nHe had not at any time limited himself to mathematics. Both before his\r\nfreshman year and during it he had read hard and deeply on general\r\nsubjects. His habit was to analyze on paper whatever he studied, and he\r\nhad dealt thus in 1861 (aged eighteen) with all Sir Thomas More,\r\nBolingbroke, and Hobbes. Among the papers for 1862 there is preserved such\r\nan analysis of Coleridge's political system; a note on the views of the\r\nAbbé Morellet, with essays on comparative psychology, the association of\r\nideas, and the originality of the anti-selfish affections. These are\r\ndeposits of that course of philosophic reading over which, says the\r\nMemoir, 'I wasted a good deal of time in 1862, but managed also to give\r\nmyself much mental training.'\r\n\r\nThe determination to abandon mathematics for a line of study more germane\r\nto that career of which he already had some vision met with no resistance\r\nfrom his people; but it did not altogether please the college authorities.\r\nHe wrote to old Mr. Dilke:\r\n\r\n    \"When I told Hopkins\" (his tutor) \"that I was not going out in\r\n    mathematics, he was taken aback, and seemed very sorry. He urged me to\r\n    _read law_, but still to go out as a high senior optime, which he says\r\n    I could be, without reading more than a very small quantity of\r\n    mathematics every day. My objection to this was that I knew myself\r\n    better than he did; that were I to go in for mathematics, I should be\r\n    as high in that tripos as my talents would let me, and that my law and\r\n    my life's purpose would suffer in consequence.\r\n\r\n    \"He said--'You will be very sorry if it happens that you are not first\r\n    legalist of your year--that is the only place in the Law Tripos that\r\n    you can be content with--and yet remember you have Shee in your year,\r\n    who is always a dangerous adversary, and who starts with some little\r\n    knowledge on the subject.'\r\n\r\n    \"I said I should read with Shee, and make him understand that I was\r\n    intended by Nature to beat him.\"\r\n\r\nThe dangerous Shee had been thus announced in a letter of February, 1863:\r\n\"Shee--son of the well-known Serjeant, [Footnote: Mr. Serjeant Shee was\r\nlater a Judge--the first Roman Catholic since the time of the Stuarts to\r\nsit on the English Bench.] has come up and taken the rooms over me. He\r\nseems a nice kind of fellow; of course, a strong Romanist.\"\r\n\r\nShee remained till the end Dilke's chief competitor, and he was also one\r\nof the band of friends who met each other incessantly, and incessantly\r\ntalked over first principles till the small hours of morning. Perhaps it\r\nis not without importance that Charles Dilke should have had the\r\nexperience, not very common for Englishmen, of living on terms of intimacy\r\nwith an Irish Roman Catholic: at all events, his relations in after-life,\r\nboth with Irishmen and with Roman Catholics, were more friendly than is\r\ncommon. For the moment Shee made one factor in the discussions upon\r\ntheology which are inevitable among undergraduates, and which went on with\r\nvigour in this little group, according to the recollection of Judge\r\nSteavenson, who in those days, faithful to the orthodoxy of his Low Church\r\nupbringing, found himself ranged by the side of the 'strong Romanist'\r\nagainst a general onslaught upon Christianity. Charley Dilke himself had\r\ncome under the influences of the place and the time. There is an entry\r\nheaded May, 1863: \"I find a fair argument against miracles in my notes for\r\nthis month.\" He had abandoned attendance at Communion, but, according to\r\nJudge Steavenson, did not go further in opinions or in talk than a vague\r\nagnosticism--which was also the attitude of another subtle and agile\r\nintelligence in that circle.\r\n\r\nTurning over, in 1891, the boxes which held his letters and papers of\r\ncollege days, Charles Dilke wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"1863.\r\n\r\n    \"In every page of the destroyed notebooks of this year I could see the\r\n    influence of two men--my grandfather and H. D. Warr.\" [Footnote: Mr.\r\n    H. D. Warr became a journalist. In 1880 Sir Charles secured him the\r\n    post of Secretary to the Royal Commission upon City Companies, of\r\n    which Lord Derby was Chairman.]\r\n\r\nWarr was a classical exhibitioner of Trinity Hall in Dilke's year, and was\r\nnot among the few who are named at first as likely friends,\r\nthough he figures early as a competitor in the Euclid and Algebra 'fights'\r\nat his tutor's. In February, 1863, his name must have been on Dilke's\r\ntongue or pen, since this is evidently a reply to inquiries:\r\n\r\n    \"Warr is a clergyman's son. He will probably be about fourth or fifth\r\n    for the Bell (Scholarship).\"\r\n\r\nIt is not till the October term of his second year that more explicit\r\nnotice of this friend occurs, when Dilke is giving an account of his first\r\nspeech as Vice-President of the Union. He opened a debate on the metric\r\nsystem, concerning which he had solid and well-thought-out opinions:\r\n\r\n    \"My speech was logical but not fluent. Warr says it was the best\r\n    opening speech he ever listened to, but by no means the best speech.\r\n    Warr is a candid critic whom I dread, so that I am glad he was\r\n    satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nOf this candour Dilke has preserved some specimens which show that Warr's\r\ninfluence was mainly used in laughing his friend out of his solemnity.\r\nThus Warr characterizes him as a dealer in logic,\" and, breaking off from\r\nsome fantastic speculation as to the future of all their college set,\r\nJanuary 9th, 1864, moralizes.\r\n\r\n    \"I am an ass, my friend, a great ass, to write in this silly strain to\r\n    you, but you must not be very angry, though I own now to a feeling of\r\n    _having half insulted your kind serious ways by talking nonsense to\r\n    them on paper_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's association with the river and with rowing men was so\r\nconstant that we ate justified in preserving this contemporary report of\r\nhis first race for the Grand Challenge, on which he always looked back\r\nwith pride:\r\n\r\n    \"It was,\" says the report, which Dilke preserved, \"one of the finest\r\n    and fastest races ever seen at Henley, and the losers deserve as much\r\n    credit as the winners. The Oxford crew were on the Berks side,\r\n    Kingston on the Oxon, and Cambridge in the middle. It was a very fine\r\n    and even start, and they continued level for about 50 yards, when\r\n    Brasenose began to show the bow of their boat in front, the others\r\n    still remaining oar and oar, rowing in fine form and at a great pace.\r\n    So finely were the three crews matched, that, although Brasenose\r\n    continued to increase their lead, it was only inch by inch. At the end\r\n    of about 400 yards Brasenose were about a quarter of a length only\r\n    ahead. The race was continued with unabated vigour, Brasenose now\r\n    going more in front, and being a length ahead at the Poplars, where\r\n    they began to ease slightly. The contest between Cambridge and\r\n    Kingston was still admirable; Cambridge had made some fine bursts to\r\n    get away from them, but they were not to be shaken off, and the\r\n    gallant effort of the one crew was met by a no less gallant effort on\r\n    the part of the other. The Cambridge crew began to show in front as\r\n    they neared Remenham, and a most determined race was continued to the\r\n    end. Brasenose won by a length clear, and the Cambridge boat was not\r\n    clear of the Kingston, only having got her about three-quarters of\r\n    their length.\"\r\n\r\nThe time--seven minutes, twenty-six seconds--was the fastest that had been\r\nrowed over that course, and more than half a minute faster than that of\r\nthe final heat, in which Brasenose were beaten by University. But next day\r\nin the Ladies' Plate University brought down the record by three seconds.\r\nTrinity Hall had the worst station, and if they were beaten by only a\r\nlength, must have been as fast as Brasenose. Kingston was stroked by L.\r\nPugh Evans, Brasenose by D. Pocklington (W. B. Woodgate rowing 4). The\r\nTrinity Hall eight were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 st.  lb.\r\n    E.

The exceptional in his\r\ncase sprang from the tie which linked this young athlete to the old\r\nscholar who, in his library at Sloane Street, or among his flowers at\r\nAlice Holt, was ceaselessly preoccupied with detail of the undergraduate's\r\nlife and work. From the first there was a pathos in his eagerness to\r\nfollow and understand all the minutiae of an unfamiliar scene. At the\r\nclose of Charles Dilke's first term he wrote (December 1st, 1862):\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter gave me great pleasure, as indeed for one reason or\r\n    another, or for no reason if you please, your letters always do;\r\n    though not being a Cambridge man, I am at times a little puzzled....\r\n    What a bore I shall be after the 13th with my endless enquiries.\"\r\n\r\nTen days later he is jubilant over the results of the college examination\r\nwhich closed the first term:\r\n\r\n    \"Hurrah! hurrah! my dear grandson. Ninety-seven out of a hundred--\r\n    eleven above the second 'man'--is a position that would satisfy a\r\n    whole family of loving friends, even if they were all grandfathers.\"\r\n\r\nAfter every college examination the grandson sent lists of results,\r\ncompiled with elaborate detail. The grandfather studied them, treasured\r\nthem, compared them, wanted to know why this man had fallen back, how the\r\nother had advanced, and always with the same warm outflow of sympathy and\r\npride over his own pupil. There they lie to-day in the despatch-boxes,\r\npreserved as a memorial of that love by the man on whom it was expended.\r\nOn one is noted:\r\n\r\n    \"Many scraps such as this, and his letters, show the loving care with\r\n    which my grandfather watched over my progress at the University.\"\r\n\r\nThe beginning of his first Long Vacation he spent in travelling through\r\nGermany, Holland, and Belgium with his father. Later, in August, he\r\nvisited Jersey and Guernsey, and went to France alone, making pilgrimage\r\nfrom Cherbourg to Tocqueville's two houses, and filling notebooks with\r\nobservations on Norman architecture at St. Lô, Coutances, and elsewhere.\r\nHe was perfecting his mastery of the language, too, and notes long after:\r\n\"On this journey I was once taken for a Frenchman, but my French was not\r\nso good as it was about 1870.\" But always and everywhere he observed; and\r\nsent back the results of his observation to the man who had trained it. On\r\nJune 30th, 1863, he writes:\r\n\r\n    \"I have been all over Brussels to-day. My previous estimate of the\r\n    place is confirmed. It apes Paris without having any of the Parisian\r\n    charms, just as its people speak French without being able to\r\n    pronounce it.\r\n\r\n    \"The two modern pictures in the Palais de Justice are to me worth all\r\n    the so-called Rubenses in the place. They are by Gallait and de\r\n    Biefve, and the one is our old friend of last year in London, 'The\r\n    Abdication of Charles V.'\r\n\r\n    \"Rogier--the great Belgian Minister--has failed to secure his return\r\n    in the late elections, owing to his having given a vote unpopular to\r\n    his constituents on the fortification scheme. The Catholics lost three\r\n    votes (regained by the advanced party) in the Senate these elections.\r\n\r\n    \"The names of the sides of the chambers are significant:\r\n\r\n            \"Liberals. -- Catholics.\r\n\r\n    \"What a fine country Belgium would be if it could get rid of its\r\n    priests a little more. The people understand freedom. In Ghent the\r\n    priests are rich, but utterly powerless owing to the extent of the\r\n    manufacturing interest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Cambridge for the October term of 1863, his hard\r\nreading did not satisfy his prodigious power for work. He was Vice-\r\nPresident of the Union, and he undertook the more arduous duties of\r\nSecretary and Treasurer of the College Boat Club. When at the beginning of\r\n1864 he was re-elected Vice-President of the Union, his grandfather wrote:\r\n\"Your University career has proved to me that you have a happiness of\r\nmanner that wins friends.\" Mr. Dilke's health began to decline notably in\r\nthe early part of 1864, and loss of sight menaced him. He took the\r\ndoctor's sentence, that he must refrain altogether from reading, with\r\ncharacteristic philosophy, but added: \"I have ordered that newspapers are\r\nnot to be sent here, so you must excuse it if, when we meet, I am a little\r\nin arrear of the course of life.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in February, 1864, Charles Dilke had entered without training for a\r\nwalking race, and had beaten the University champion, Patrick, covering\r\nthe mile (\"in a gale of wind and over heavy slush\") in eight minutes and\r\nforty-two seconds. [Footnote: Mr. Patrick, afterwards member of\r\nParliament, and from 1886 Permanent Under-Secretary for Scotland.] To this\r\nannouncement his grandfather made pleasant reply, threatening to come up\r\nand compete in person, but three days later wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I wish you had sent me a Cambridge paper which contained an account\r\n    of your Olympic games. It is not too late now if you can get one; _I\r\n    reserve the right of reading everything that relates to you and your\r\n    concerns_.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles Dilke's reading went on with feverish energy. The\r\ndangerous rival was closely watched. \"Shee has been sitting up till\r\nominously late hours for some nights past. His father came up last night\r\nand left again to-night, but I fear he did not make his son waste much\r\ntime.\" The competitors were straining then for a college law prize, but\r\nthe letter goes on to observe very sagely:\r\n\r\n    \"The law is of little consequence, as neither of us can know anything\r\n    about it at present; but I should like to win the essay prize.\"\r\n\r\nThe prize was the annual college prize for the best English essay, and\r\nthat year's subject was \"Sir Robert Walpole.\" Compositions were presumably\r\nsent in after the Christmas vacation, for on February 29th, 1864, a\r\nfortnight after the announcement as to the walking race, comes this\r\nlaconic bulletin:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR GRANDFATHER,\r\n\r\n    \"English Essay Prize: Dilke.\r\n        Honourably mentioned: Osborn, Shee.\r\n    Latin Essay Prize: Warr.\r\n    Honourably mentioned: Casswell. [Footnote: A scholar of Sir Charles's\r\n    year, and one of his most frequent associates in undergraduate days.]\r\n\r\n    \"They say that parts of my essay were vulgar.\r\n\r\n    \"Your affectionate grandson,\r\n\r\n    \"CHAS. W. DILKE.\"\r\n\r\nThat last sentence roused the old critic:\r\n\r\n    \"I should like to read the _whole_ essay. My especial interest is\r\n    aroused by the charge of occasional _vulgarity_. If it be true, it is\r\n    not improbable that the writer caught the infection from his\r\n    grandfather. With one half the world, in its judgment of literature\r\n    and of life, vulgarity is the opposite of gentility, and gentility is\r\n    merely negative, and implies _the absence of all character_, and, in\r\n    language, of all idiom, all bone and muscle. I have a notion--only do\r\n    not whisper such heresy within college walls--that a college tutor\r\n    must be genteel in his _college judgments_, that 'The Polite Letter\r\n    Writer' was the work of an M.A. in the 'Augustan Age.' You may find in\r\n    Shakespeare household words and phrases from every condition and walk\r\n    in life--as much coarseness as you please to look for--anything and\r\n    everything except gentility and vulgarity. Occasional vulgarity is,\r\n    therefore, a question on which _I_ refuse to take the opinion of any\r\n    man not well known to me.\"\r\n\r\nOn one matter the pupil was recalcitrant. Mr. Dilke begged him to give\r\n\"one hour or one half-hour a day\" to mastering Greek, so as to be able to\r\nread it with pleasure--a mastery which could only be acquired \"before you\r\nenter on the direct purpose and business of life.\" But \"insuperable\r\ndifficulties\" presented themselves. \"It is of considerable importance that\r\nI should be first in the college Law May examination.\" Hopes of compliance\r\nin a later period were held out, to which Mr. Dilke replied shrewdly that\r\n\"insuperable difficulties\" were often temperamental, and that during the\r\nwhole period of study equally strong reasons for postponement would\r\ncontinue to present themselves; and then would come \"the all-engrossing\r\nbusiness of life, and there is an end of half-hours.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1864, Mr. Dilke was present on the bank at 'Grassy' when, on the\r\nsecond night of the races, Trinity Hall, with his grandson rowing at No.\r\n3, went head of the river.\r\n\r\n    \"_The ever-memorable May 12th_, 1864.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n    \"Last night we gained on 3rd Trinity all the way to Ditton Corner,\r\n    where we were overlapping. Our coxswain made a shot, missed them, and\r\n    we went into the mid-stream. After our misfortune we paddled slowly\r\n    over the long reach, and came in half a length behind 3rd Trinity and\r\n    2 lengths ahead of 1st Trinity. To-night we did not gain much up to\r\n    the Plough, where we spurted and caught up 3rd directly; we rowed\r\n    round Ditton Corner overlapping, and so for 100 yds. more, and then\r\n    made our bump. The whole of the crew and Stephen were chaired and\r\n    carried round the quad. [Footnote: Leslie Stephen had coached the\r\n    boat, which stayed head throughout the races. Judge Steavenson rowed\r\n    in it at No. 5, where he had rowed earlier in the year for the\r\n    University. In 1868 it was settled that 'the outrigger which was rowed\r\n    head of the river in 1864 should be cut up, and the pieces distributed\r\n    amongst the members of the crew who rowed in her in that year.'\r\n    Dilke's piece always hung against the wall in his study in Sloane\r\n    Street.] Our 2nd has made its bump each night, and is 8th on the\r\n    river!!!\"\r\n\r\nHardly were the May races over before the college Law examination began.\r\nOn May 31st Charles Dilke wrote to his grandfather:\r\n\r\n    \"The results will be known to-morrow. I have worked as hard as it is\r\n    possible for me to do, for I have worked till I became almost deprived\r\n    of memory.... Shee has worked, too, as hard as he could, and was in a\r\n    dreadful state of nervous excitement this evening. I almost hope that\r\n    he is first, for I should like to see him get his scholarship. Warr\r\n    tried to get me to refuse to go in for the examination, or find some\r\n    pretext for being away, in order to let our common friend get his\r\n    scholarship; but I said that I thought he would beat me, and that he\r\n    should have the glory of beating my _best_ efforts if he beat me at\r\n    all.\"\r\n\r\nAn underlying reason against his acceptance of Warr's advice may be found\r\nin this letter from Mr. Dilke at Alice Holt to his son Wentworth:\r\n\r\n    \"_June 3rd_, 1864.\r\n\r\n    \"If you carried out your intention of going to and returning from\r\n    Cambridge this day, you know, and all in Sloane Street know, that our\r\n    noble fellow has again won the prize. But the weather may have\r\n    deterred you, and on the possible chance I copy the results:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Chas. Dilke, 570 marks. Prize.\r\n              Shee, 440\r\n\r\n    \"What a blessing that boy has been to my old age! May God reward him!\r\n    I feel for Shee! for he has laboured long and zealously. I wish there\r\n    had been two prizes.\r\n\r\n    \"I will not mix the subject with baser matter, so shall write my\r\n    memoranda on another sheet.\r\n\r\n    \"Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n    \"C. W. D.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the May term came Henley Regatta, and Trinity Hall was again entered\r\nfor the Grand Challenge. Many of the friends, Shee amongst them, had taken\r\nup their quarters there, along with the oarsmen; and Warr, who was not at\r\nHenley, wrote pressing a prompt return to Cambridge for the Long Vacation\r\nterm. As the Henley week progressed [Footnote: Dilke rowed again both for\r\nthe Grand Challenge and the Ladies' Plate. In each Trinity Hall met the\r\nultimate winner in the trial heat, and were defeated by Kingston and by\r\nEton, but beat London and Radley.] Mr. Dilke writes:\r\n\r\n    \"My movements may be absolutely regulated by your wishes or\r\n    convenience. If you desire to pay a visit to the Holt, I have there\r\n    the chance of a quicker recovery, if I am to go on well; whereas if\r\n    there be more inducements to visit London, why here I have the benefit\r\n    of the doctors should I not make progress. The pleasure and the\r\n    advantages being _equal_ to me, you have only to decide. Let me know\r\n    your decision by return of post.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke decided for London, and there spent three or four days in\r\nthe company of his family, and, above all, of his grandfather. Then he\r\nwent back to Cambridge, and lived the life of strenuous, healthy young men\r\nin the summer weather; getting up at five o'clock in the mornings,\r\nbathing, reading long hours, walking long walks, talking the long talks of\r\nyouth. The correspondence with his grandfather centred chiefly now on the\r\nsubject for the next year's essay competition, which had been announced at\r\nthe close of the May term, and which, as Charles Dilke said, \"seems to be\r\nrather in my line.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Pope's couplet:\r\n\r\n     \"For forms of government let fools contest,\r\n     Whatever is best administered is best.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no less in old Mr. Dilke's line than in his grandson's. He wrote on\r\nJuly 14th from Alice Holt a page of admirable criticism on the scheme as\r\noutlined by his grandson, and concludes in his habitual tone of\r\naffectionate self-depreciation:\r\n\r\n    \"This is another of my old prosings--another proof that love and good\r\n    will and good wishes remain when power to serve is gone....\"\r\n\r\nWith the precocious maturity of Charles Dilke's intellect had gone a\r\nslowness of development in other directions. It is true that those\r\nCambridge men who remember him as an undergraduate remember him as\r\nserious, but full of high animal spirits and sense of fun; while everyone\r\nspeaks of his charm and gaiety. \"We were all in love with him,\" says one\r\nvivacious old lady, who belonged to the circle of connections and\r\nrelatives that frequented 76, Sloane Street. But the letters of his early\r\ndays at Cambridge hardly show that 'happiness of manner' which his\r\ngrandfather attributed to him. Only now does the whole personality begin\r\nto emerge, as in a letter of 1864, in which he begs his grandfather,\r\nbecause \"writing is irksome to you,\" to send two very short letters rather\r\nthan one longer one; \"for the receipt of a letter gives me an excuse to\r\nwrite again, while on the other hand I can by habit catch your meaning by\r\nthe first words of your shortest criticisms.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sheet was occupied by very able analysis of an article\r\nwhich had been published in the _Athenaeum_--criticism mature and manly\r\nboth in thought and expression. The change did not escape the shrewd\r\nobserver. Mr. Dilke replied:\r\n\r\n    \"ALICE HOLT,\r\n    \"BY FARNHAM, SURREY,\r\n    \"_July 28th_, 1864.\r\n\r\n    \"MY VERY DEAR GRANDSON,\r\n\r\n    \"Your letters give me very great pleasure, not because they are kind\r\n    and considerate, of which I had evidence enough long since, not\r\n    because they flatter the vanity of the old man by asking his opinion,\r\n    which few now regard, but because I see in them a gradual development\r\n    of your own mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe added a few words in praise of the analysis, but pointed out that the\r\nreviewer, whom Charles Dilke censured, was treating a well-worn subject--\r\nBentham's Philosophy--and therefore needed to aim at freshness of view\r\nrather than thoroughness of exposition. He added:\r\n\r\n    \"I, however, am delighted with the Article, which is full of promise\r\n    of a coming man by which the old journal may benefit.\"\r\n\r\nSave for a final \"God bless you!\" from \"as ever, your affectionate\r\nGrand.,\" that was the last word written by Mr. Dilke to his grandson.\r\nWithin a week he was struck down by what proved to be his fatal illness.\r\n\r\nEarly on August 8th Charles Dilke wrote to his father that he was deterred\r\nfrom coming home only by the fear lest his sudden arrival might \"frighten\r\ngrandfather about himself and make him worse.\" A few hours later he was\r\nsummoned. The rest may be given in his own words:\r\n\r\n    '_August 8th, Monday_.--I received a telegram from my father at noon:\r\n    \"You had better come here.\" I left by the 1.30 train, and reached\r\n    Alice Holt at half-past six. My Father met me on the lawn: he was\r\n    crying bitterly, and said, \"He lives only to see you.\" I went upstairs\r\n    and sat down by the sofa, on which lay the Grand., looking haggard,\r\n    but still a noble wreck. I took his hand, and he began to talk of very\r\n    trivial matters--of Cambridge everyday life--his favourite theme of\r\n    old. He seemed to be testing his strength, for at last he said: \"I\r\n    shall be able to talk to-morrow; I may last some weeks; but were it\r\n    not for the pang that all of you would feel, I should prefer that it\r\n    should end at once. I have had a good time of it.\"\r\n\r\n    'He had been saying all that morning: \"Is that a carriage I hear?\" or\r\n    \"I shall live to see him.\"\r\n\r\n    '_Tuesday_.--When I went in to him, he sent away the others, and told\r\n    me to look for an envelope and a key. I failed to find it, and fetched\r\n    Morris, who after a careful search found the key, but no envelope. We\r\n    had both passed over my last letter (August 6th), which lay on the\r\n    table. He made us both leave the room, but recalled me directly, and\r\n    when I entered had banknotes in his hand, which he must have taken\r\n    from the envelope of my letter. (This involved rising.) He said: \"I\r\n    cannot live, I fear, to your birthday--I want to make you a present--I\r\n    think I have heard you say that you should like a stop-watch--I have\r\n    made careful inquiries as to the price--and have saved--as I believe--\r\n    sufficient.\" He then gave me notes, and the key of a desk in London,\r\n    in the secret drawer of which I should find the remaining money. He\r\n    then gave me the disposition of his papers and manuscripts, directing\r\n    that what I did not want should go to the British Museum. He then\r\n    said: \"I have nothing more to say but that you have fulfilled--my\r\n    every hope--beyond all measure--and--I am deeply--grateful.\"\r\n\r\n    'He died in my presence on Wednesday, 10th, at half-past one, in\r\n    perfect peace.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. C. W. DILKE.\r\nFrom the painting by Arthur Hughes ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLAST TERMS AT THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his grandfather's death Charles Dilke went away alone on a walking\r\ntour in Devon. The death of his grandfather was hardly realized at first;\r\n'the sense of loss' deepened: 'it has been greater with me every year that\r\nfollowed.' He corresponded with his college friends, and of this date is a\r\nletter of remonstrance at his overstudious habits from the sententious H.\r\nD. Warr:\r\n\r\n    \"My dear Dilke will forgive me if I say that, though I honour him much\r\n    for his many strong and good qualities, I think he is far too given to\r\n    laborious processes in work and social life.... My warm regard for you\r\n    rests to some extent on my very high appreciation of your strength and\r\n    consistency of character: you have always appeared to me to be a\r\n    supremely honest man, almost comically so, at least when I am in a\r\n    profane humour: I do not know that anything you could do would\r\n    possibly make me like you better. But I think if you gave yourself a\r\n    little wider fling and liberty, and did not walk always as it were on\r\n    the seam of the carpet, it would be better; there would be less to\r\n    lean on in you, perhaps, but if possible more to love.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke used to say that Fawcett and Warr had between them cured him\r\nof that priggishness which he often recalled with amusement. Almost\r\ninevitably his grandfather's devotion, the absolute engrossment of so\r\nconsiderable a personality in his least important concerns, would\r\nemphasize the inclination to take himself over-seriously which is marked\r\nin every clever and resolute young man.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1865 he won the college essay prize for the second\r\ntime. A pile of dockets from the British Museum shows that, as soon as\r\ncoming of age qualified him to be a reader there, he plunged deep into all\r\nthe works on ideal commonwealths to complete his survey of 'forms of\r\ngovernment'--the subject indicated by Pope's couplet, which had appealed\r\nso strongly both to his grandfather and himself. This was a side issue.\r\nBeading for his Tripos went on with unremitting energy, and he had in use\r\nninety-four notebooks crammed with analyses. In June, 1865, he was\r\nannounced Senior Legalist, easily at the head of the law students of his\r\nyear, thus crowning his college successes by the highest University\r\ndistinction open to a man who followed that course.\r\n\r\nA month before he entered for the Tripos, he had stroked the college boat,\r\nwhich was head of the river. Trinity Hall, however, retained its pride of\r\nplace only for one day, and it was no small achievement to accomplish even\r\nthis, since Third Trinity, who bumped them on the second night, were a\r\nwonderful crew, with five University oars, 'including some of the most\r\ndistinguished Eton oars that ever rowed.' [Footnote: The Memoir details\r\nthem: 'Chambers, the winner of the pairs, sculls, and \"walk,\" President of\r\nthe University Boat Club, and afterwards Secretary of the Amateur Athletic\r\nClub; Kinglake, afterwards President of the University Boat Club; W. E.\r\nGriffith, afterwards President of the University Boat Club, and\r\nformerly stroke of the finest Eton eight ever seen; Selwyn, afterwards\r\nBishop of Melanesia, stroke of the University eight; and C. B. Lawes,\r\nafterwards the well-known sculptor, who had been captain of the Boats at\r\nEton, and who had won the Diamond Sculls and the amateur championship of\r\nthe Thames, and had rowed stroke of the University crew the year after\r\nSelwyn.'] The Hall had only one 'blue,' Steavenson, but to Charles Dilke\r\nhimself had been offered in February, 1865, and was offered again in 1866,\r\nthe place of 'seven' in the University eight. He declined on grounds of\r\nhealth, fearing the strain of the four-mile course on his heart. A note\r\nadded later says regretfully: 'I believe that I was unduly frightened by\r\nmy doctor, and that I might have rowed.'\r\n\r\nTo be Senior Legalist and to stroke the first boat on the river in the\r\nsame term was an unusual combination: in the next Charles Dilke added to\r\nit the Presidency of the Union. The new Union buildings were now in\r\nprocess of construction, and he had done more than any other man to bring\r\nthem from a derisive by-word into solid realization of brick and mortar.\r\nHe took credit to himself for 'the selection of Waterhouse as architect\r\nagainst Gilbert Scott and Digby Wyatt.' Care to see this business fully\r\nthrough was one of the reasons which determined him to come up for a\r\nfourth year, and to hold the Presidency a second time in the Lent term of\r\n1866. On his retirement he proposed Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice for his\r\nsuccessor, and thus left the lead in hands he could trust.\r\n\r\nOf his own speeches he has preserved some detail, showing how early his\r\nopinions displayed the character which was to be constant in them:\r\n\r\n    'In 1864-65 I spoke twice at the Union [Footnote: After Dilke's death,\r\n    when a resolution of regret was carried at the Union, the Vice-\r\n    President, Mr. J. H. Allen of Jesus, said in moving it: \"Sir Charles\r\n    was in a double sense the architect of the fortunes of the Society,\r\n    because he was responsible for the superintendence of the change from\r\n    the old inadequate home in Queens' Street into the more glorious\r\n    building which they now enjoyed. It was for that reason that on two\r\n    occasions the Society elected him to the highest position which they\r\n    could confer.\"] in favour of the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston,\r\n    opposing several of my friends who were condemning it. Cobden at the\r\n    time was attacking supposed extravagance, based, as he thought, on\r\n    panic, and I sided with Palmerston in thinking that the enormous\r\n    increase of the French Navy could only be intended for an anti-English\r\n    policy, while in the event of even the temporary loss of the command\r\n    of the Channel, invasion by an immense French army would become\r\n    possible. To Poland I was friendly, but unwilling to contemplate, as\r\n    Lord Palmerston was unwilling to contemplate, interference by England\r\n    in alliance with the Emperor Napoleon. I was so far from strongly\r\n     taking the Danish side in the war that I chose the opportunity to put\r\n    up in my rooms at Cambridge a photograph of Bismarck, for whom I had a\r\n    considerable admiration. I had made Lord Palmerston's acquaintance\r\n    during the Exhibition in '62 (to the ceremonies of which I also owed\r\n    that of Auber, Meyerbeer, and many other distinguished people), but I\r\n    do not think that the chat of the jaunty old gentleman in his last\r\n    days had had any effect upon my views, and I was certainly more pro-\r\n    German than was Palmerston, who was not pro-anything except pro-\r\n    English.'[Footnote: For Sir Charles's opinion of Lord Palmerston, see\r\n    vol. ii., p. 493. ]\r\n\r\nThe best speech, in Dilke's own opinion, that he made during 1866 was in\r\nopposition to the proposal to congratulate Governor Eyre upon his\r\nsuppression of 'the supposed insurrection in Jamaica.' This was the first\r\nof the many occasions on which Sir Charles Dilke criticized the severity\r\nof white men towards natives in the name of civilized government.\r\n\r\nFuller anticipation of the views he supported in Parliament is to be found\r\nin his speeches on home politics. In the spring of 1866 the country was\r\nviolently agitated over the Reform Bill introduced by Lord Russell, who\r\nhad become Prime Minister on the death of Lord Palmerston in 1865. Of\r\ncourse there was a debate at the Union, and it was prolonged to a second\r\nnight. Dilke writes:\r\n\r\n    'I took up for the first time broad democratic ground. Attacking the\r\n    famous speech of Mr. Lowe, [Footnote: Mr. Lowe had asked in the debate\r\n    on the \"Representation of the People Bill,\" as reported in Hansard, on\r\n    March 13th, 1866: \"If you want venality, ignorance, drunkenness; if\r\n    you want impulsive, unreflecting, violent people, where do you look\r\n    for them? Do you go to the top, or to the bottom?\"] I declared that so\r\n    far was I from agreement with these calumnies, that I was of opinion\r\n    that those homely and truly English qualities which had to some slight\r\n    extent grown slack among the upper classes were to be met with in all\r\n    their strength as much in the more intelligent portion of the now\r\n    unrepresented classes, as among those familiarly styled \"their\r\n    betters.\" With regard to the question of the fitness of the artisans\r\n    for the franchise, I argued that they had not to decide for themselves\r\n    between Austria and Prussia in the Holstein question, but had to\r\n    decide between candidates who would settle the more abstruse questions\r\n    for them. The middle classes, I contended, could as a body do no more,\r\n    and the artisan was just as competent to judge of honesty and ability\r\n    as the £10 householder; and less likely to be influenced by bribery\r\n    and intimidation, as being more independent and more fearless of\r\n    consequences. Moreover, any attempt to keep the great mass of the\r\n    people from all share of political power seemed to me idle: whether we\r\n    liked their advent to government or whether we feared it, it was\r\n    inevitable, and the longer we delayed to prepare for it the worse it\r\n    would be for so-called Conservative interests when it came. I\r\n    contended that the working man had proportionately a greater stake in\r\n    the country than the rich; that the taxes which he paid were a vastly\r\n    more serious matter to him than those which the rich paid were to\r\n    them, and that a hundred of the laws passed by Parliament vitally\r\n    affected the interests of the working people to one which injured\r\n    those of the upper class.'\r\n\r\nFor a young man whose political views were so maturely thought out, debate\r\nwas no mere exercitation; his education was fast passing into\r\napprenticeship for public life; and in February, 1865, his father, Sir\r\nWentworth Dilke, coming forward at a by-election in the Liberal interest\r\nfor Wallingford, gave the Union debater his first chance on a public\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards, when Sir Charles Dilke was travelling down to the Forest\r\nof Dean with a party of guests and friends, one of them, looking out as\r\nthe train swept along the Thames Valley, caught sight of a little white\r\nchurch nestling under a hill and asked, \"Is that Cholsey?\" Sir Charles\r\nturned round in his eager way: \"What, do you know this district? Yes, that\r\nis Cholsey;\" and went on to tell how intimate he had become with all the\r\nvillages round Wallingford when speaking and canvassing for his father,\r\nand how the experience gained among the Berkshire peasants had supplied\r\nvaluable lessons for his own contests in later years.\r\n\r\nSir Wentworth was elected, and Lord Granville, who had a real friendship\r\nfor him, wrote, in a spirit very typical of the traditional view: \"I know\r\nno one to whom Parliamentary life will afford more interest and\r\namusement.\" Charles Dilke's conception of Parliamentary life was very\r\ndifferent from that of his father, and from that which Lord Granville\r\nindicated. On the other hand, the son seemed to the father deficient in\r\nappreciation of the pleasures acceptable to himself:\r\n\r\n    'One of the difficulties between my father and myself about this\r\n    period arose from his vexation at my refusing to take part in the\r\n    shooting-parties at Alice Holt. He was passionately fond of\r\n    shooting; ... I had now but little sympathy with the amusement, and\r\n    had shown my dislike for it in many ways.'\r\n\r\nYet despite differences, the father was immensely proud of his son, and\r\nconsulted him in regard to the younger brother's education. In his reply\r\nCharles Dilke discussed the view of certain Dons who held that the\r\ncultivated English gentleman ought not to go in for honours at all, and\r\nadmitted that \"reading for a high place here involves loss of many\r\npleasures, of almost all society; it makes a man fretful, and often leaves\r\nhim behind the world; as an education for the mind it is not so good as\r\nthe self-education of a non-honours man ought to be, _but never is_.\" He\r\nthought, nevertheless, that classics--of which he avowed himself \"more\r\nignorant than an English gentleman ought to be\"--offered the field in\r\nwhich success was best worth having. He himself \"would gladly be put back\r\nto fourteen or fifteen, and 'grind my life out' till two-and-twenty, in\r\norder to get a high place in the first-class classics.\" But it must be all\r\nor nothing. A second-class he dismissed as not worth winning. Moreover,\r\n\"if the boy has not a high standard set up for him, he will do nothing\r\nwhatever, which is far worse than doing too much.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the midst of all that full college life which was becoming\r\nmore and more definitely a preparation for the political career, he was\r\ntrying his strength in the field of journalism.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather had never ceased to impress upon him that every public man\r\nshould have learned and practised thoroughly the craft of writing. This\r\nprecept allied itself with the inherited ownership of a great literary\r\njournal; and very shortly after old Mr. Dilke's death the undergraduate,\r\nas he then was, began to associate himself actively with the work of the\r\n_Athenaeum_. His first published writing in it appeared on October 22nd,\r\n1864, when he reviewed a well-known work on economics by the writer whom\r\nthe Memoir styles 'that dull Frenchman, Le Play.' [Footnote: French\r\nSenator, son-in-law of the celebrated economist Michel Chevalier. He wrote\r\nworks on the principles of agriculture, the application of chemistry to\r\nagriculture, and kindred subjects.] Le Play wrote from Paris to thank Sir\r\nWentworth Dilke for a copy of the article which had been sent him, and had\r\nalready attracted attention in France:\r\n\r\n    \"On y trouve un sentiment de vrai progrès et une intelligence de la\r\n    vie pratique qui se rencontrent rarement chez nos critiques.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Museum tickets show the course of reading which Charles Dilke\r\nwas pursuing at this period: Bacon, Filmer, Mandeville, Hume, represent\r\nthe older English writers on Commonwealths, ideal and actual; Crousaz,\r\nCondorcet, Diderot, Linguet, Fénelon, Helvétius, stood for the influences\r\nof eighteenth-century France. With them were writers more recondite; the\r\n_Mundus Alter et Idem_ of \"Britannicus,\" _Barclay his Argenis_, Holberg's\r\n_Journey in the Underworld_, Sadeur's _Terre Australe Connue_, Ned Lane's\r\n_Excellencie of a Free State_, were all out-of-the-way books with an\r\nantiquarian flavour. Of recent or contemporary authors, Montalembert was\r\nincluded, with Proudhon, as were men whom Charles Dilke came to know\r\npersonally--Émile de Girardin, Michel Chevalier, and, a close friend\r\nafterwards, Louis Blanc. Works of Mohl and Willick brought in the Germans,\r\nand a volume of the _Federalist_ introduced him to that great American\r\ncommonwealth which he was soon to visit. A sheaf of dockets for works upon\r\nthe Swedenborgian Association and theories complete this very extensive\r\nrange of reading, which may be supplemented by the following note of his\r\nown:\r\n\r\n    \"Favourite books, 1864 (in themselves--for no object):\r\n        \"Shakespeare.\r\n        \"The Bible.\r\n        \"J. S. Mill: _Political Economy; On Liberty; Dissertations._\r\n        \"Longfellow: _Evangeline_ and _Miles Standish_.\r\n        \"Homer: _Works_.\r\n        \"Tennyson: nearly all.\r\n        \"Plato: _Republic_.\r\n        \"Sir P. Sidney: _Arcadia_.\r\n        \"Claude Adrien Helvétius: _Works_.\r\n        \"Victor Hugo: _Les Misérables_.\r\n        \"William Godwin: _Political Justice_.\"\r\n\r\nHe notes also in the Memoir that the reading of Mill at this period marked\r\nthe beginning of Mill's influence over him. This influence was a great\r\nfactor in Dilke's life, and, when it passed into a personal relation,\r\nbecame almost one of discipleship.\r\n\r\nHis taste for Victor Hugo led him to write in the _Athenaeum_ a long\r\nnotice of _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_ in 1866, when that romance\r\nappeared; but another article about the same period on international law\r\nindicates the main bent of his studies.\r\n\r\nAs early as the Long Vacation of 1864, in the course of preparing his\r\nessay on forms of government, he had found himself tracing 'the future of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon race both in the United States and Australasia'; and he\r\nthus, without knowing it, laid the foundation lines of _Greater Britain_.\r\nAlso, in 1865, 'I had already dreamt of visiting and writing upon Russia,\r\na country which always had a great hold on my imagination.' Another\r\nproject of these undergraduate years was less his own than his\r\ngrandfather's. Old Mr. Dilke contemplated a universal catalogue of books,\r\nto be prepared by international action. This scheme was completely\r\nabandoned, yet it is interesting that the grandson entertained it. The\r\nscholar, not merely the lover, but the active servant, of learning, was\r\nalways present in Charles Dilke's many-sided personality, though never\r\ndominant. We approach the central preoccupations of his mind with the\r\n_History of Prevalent Opinions in Politics_, towards which 'a great deal\r\nof work' was done by him in the winter of 1864-65. In 1866 the same\r\nunderlying group of ideas took form in the outline of a treatise on\r\n_Radicalism_.\r\n\r\nIn working for this he read 'most of the writers upon the theory of\r\npolitics--Hooker, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Linguet, Locke, Bentham, and many\r\nmore.' 'Many more' included some very unusual reading; for the plan of his\r\nbook was in three chapters, 'the first chapter being upon the Radicalism\r\nof the days before the coming of Jesus; the second chapter upon the period\r\nbetween the teaching of our Lord and 1789; and the third on Radicalism in\r\nmodern history.' In the second part he 'gave much space to Arius, Huss,\r\nWyclif, Savonarola, Vane, Roger Williams, Baxter, Fox, Zinzendorf, and\r\nother religious reformers.' All this reading taught him the 'extent to\r\nwhich forgotten doctrines come up again, and are known by the names of men\r\nwho have but revived them'; and, on the other hand, how doctrines change\r\nand degenerate while keeping the original name.\r\n\r\n    'In the sketch of my book, so far as it was worked out, I gave much\r\n    space to the falling-off in the Church from the Radicalism of\r\n    primitive Christianity.... It began with a definition of Radicalism as\r\n    a going to the root of things, which naturally led to the doctrine of\r\n    the perfectibility of man, and, quoting the gospels freely, I\r\n    attempted to prove the essential Radicalism of Christ's teaching.'\r\n\r\nHere, then, is suggested another aspect of his mind's history. He notes:\r\n\r\n    'As I rejected at this period of my life the Divinity of Christ, I\r\n    sought, under Renan's guidance, more fully than I need have done, the\r\n    origin of Christ's teaching and of that of Paul, in the doctrines\r\n    previously taught by the Essenes and the Sadducees.'\r\n\r\nElsewhere a manuscript note describes his varying attitude towards\r\nChristianity:\r\n\r\n    'In the course of 1863 I ceased my attendance upon Holy Communion, and\r\n    fell into a sceptical frame of mind which lasted for several years,\r\n    was modified in 1874, and came to an end in 1875. I had been a very\r\n    strong believer, and in the loss of my belief in the supernatural, as\r\n    it is called--_i.e._, in the Divinity of our Blessed Lord--I kept an\r\n    unbounded admiration for His words, as recorded in the Sermon on the\r\n    Mount, and belief in duty towards others. From 1885 to 1888 the Holy\r\n    Sacrament was a profound blessing to me, but in 1905 I ceased again to\r\n    find any help in forms.'\r\n\r\nTo what he called in 1865 the essential Radicalism of Christ's teaching--\r\nto-day it would be called Christian Socialism--he was always constant. It\r\nwas the guiding principle of that inner idealism which underlay his whole\r\nlife and which strengthened with his maturity. The world was for him 'a\r\nChristian' world. But acceptance not so much of the dogma as of the\r\nmystical faith of Christians would seem to have varied with him from time\r\nto time, and to have varied also in its formal expression. His mind was\r\ntoo positive, too much occupied in the detail of life, to have time either\r\nfor brooding meditation or for the metaphysics of religious inquiry; and,\r\nat least in 1866, Christianity interested him mainly as one of the most\r\npotent shaping forces of human society. The desire to follow out and\r\ninvestigate at first hand certain of its modern manifestations helped to\r\ndirect the impulse for travel which was already prompting him.\r\n\r\nThe Long Vacation of 1865 had found him tramping, first with Warr in\r\nGuernsey, afterwards alone 'through Brittany and Normandy and partly into\r\nthe provinces south of the Loire,' eloquent on the charms of travelling\r\nwithout luggage, sketching also, and increasing his carefully gathered\r\nknowledge of French architecture.\r\n\r\nHe had explored France very thoroughly before he found the part of it\r\nwhich was to become almost a second homeland in his affections; and he had\r\nthe Frenchman's appreciation of what was most characteristically France.\r\n\"I think the better of the French,\" he wrote at this time, \"for their\r\nadmiration of the scenery of the Loire, the Indre, and the Vienne. Few\r\nEnglish people are capable of appreciating the scenery of Anjou.... I\r\nnever saw anything more lovely than the scenery of the Vilaine south of\r\nGuichen and Bourg des Comptes.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was only an excursion. The whole bent of his desire lay towards\r\nserious travel, in which he should pass from the training-\r\nground of the University to that wider school where knowledge was to be\r\ngained, applied, and perfected. In the early part of 1866 he was talking\r\nonly of a journey in America, and it was a journey with a literary\r\npurpose. In his _History of Radicalism_ he had given much space to the\r\nRevivals in Prussia led by Ebel, and also to the rise in America of the\r\nschool of the Perfectionists in 1834. He proposed to take with him the\r\nsketch of this book, and work into it the results of inquiry made on the\r\nspot as regards the communistic experiments which had been tried in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBut travel for its own sake tempted him, and even before he set out, 'I\r\nfancy,' he writes, 'my intention was already to go round the world: but if\r\nI had asked my father's leave to do so, I should have been refused.'\r\n\r\nAt all events, when once fairly launched, the interest of travelling\r\nabsorbed his mind; and accordingly the book on Radicalism was finally put\r\naside, though not before some work had been done on it at Quebec and\r\nOttawa. Nor was it altogether abandoned; for, he says, in treating of\r\n'Radicalism in modern history':\r\n\r\n    'I discussed it under various heads, of which the first was Great\r\n    Britain, the second the British Colonies, the third the United States,\r\n    showing, as this table was made before I left England, the\r\n    predominance which Colonial questions were already assuming in my\r\n    mind.' Also: 'In the last part of the sketch of the work I dealt with\r\n    the political Radicalism of the future. I wrote strongly in favour of\r\n    the removal of the disabilities of sex. I took the Irish Catholic view\r\n    of the Irish question, and I commenced the discussion of some of those\r\n    questions which made the freshness and the success of _Greater\r\n    Britain_--for example, \"Effects upon Radicalism of Increased Facility\r\n    of Communication,\" and \"Development of the Principle of Love of\r\n    Country into that of Love of Man.\"'\r\n\r\n'Such,' he writes, at the end of that passage which describes the purposes\r\nand the labours of his last academic terms--'such were the dispositions in\r\nwhich I commenced my journey round the world.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\"GREATER BRITAIN\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June, 1866, Charles Dilke, not yet twenty-three, started on the travels\r\nwhich are recorded in the first and most popular of his books, _Greater\r\nBritain_. Its original draft was in reality the numbered series of long\r\ndescriptive letters which he sent home to Sloane Street.\r\n\r\nHis first prolonged absence, coupled with the unspent shock of his\r\ngrandfather's death, had bred in him a homesickness, which under the\r\ninfluence of a Virginian summer he tried to dissipate by an outburst of\r\nverse; but the medium was unsuited to his pen, and he soon returned to the\r\n'dispositions' with which he started on his journey.\r\n\r\n    'Leaving England as I did with my mind in this kind of ferment, my\r\n    visit to Boston became deeply interesting to me, as I met there a\r\n    group of men undoubtedly, on the whole, the most distinguished then\r\n    collected at any city in the world. At one party of nine people, at\r\n    Cambridge, I met Emerson, Agassiz, Longfellow, Wendell Holmes, Asa\r\n    Gray, Lowell (\"Hosea Biglow\"), Dr. Collyer the Radical Unitarian, and\r\n    Dr. Hedge the great preacher. It is hard to say by which of them I was\r\n    the most charmed. Emerson, Longfellow, Asa Gray, and Wendell Holmes\r\n    seemed to me equal in the perfection of their courtesy, the grace of\r\n    their manner, and the interest of their conversation, while Hedge and\r\n    Collyer were full of an intellectual energy which was new to me, and\r\n    which had a powerful effect upon my work of the time; to be traced\r\n    indeed through the whole of the American portion of _Greater\r\n    Britain_.'\r\n\r\nThere is no need here to attempt any sketch of a journey which is\r\ndescribed in a book which is still read after half a century. Charles\r\nDilke began with the South, where the earth had scarcely closed over the\r\ngraves of the great war, where the rebel spirit still smouldered fiercely,\r\nand where reorganization was only beginning to establish itself. He went\r\non to New York, to New England, and to Canada; then, crossing the line of\r\nthe Great Lakes, followed that other highway of the northern continent,\r\nthe Mississippi, to St. Louis. Here he met with Mr. Hepworth Dixon, then\r\neditor of the _Athenaeum_, and the character of his journey changed: he\r\ntravelled in company, and he travelled for the first time under privations\r\nand in real danger. Together they crossed the plains from the eastern head\r\nof the Pacific Railway at a period of Indian war, and parted at Salt Lake\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThis is a marking-point in the experience. Before Charles Dilke set out to\r\ncross a land still debatable, where travel still was what travel had been\r\nfor the pioneers, he wrote home two letters. Both are dated August 26th,\r\n1866, from Leavenworth in Kansas, now a sober town of twenty thousand\r\ninhabitants, then carrying recent memories of the days \"when the Southern\r\n'Border Ruffians' were in the habit of parading its streets, bearing the\r\nscalps of Abolitionists stuck on poles,\" and even after the war basing its\r\nrepute for health on the story that, when it became necessary to\r\n\"inaugurate\" the new graveyard, \"they had to shoot a man on purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these letters is to his father:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n    \"I have been for some days considering whether I would write to you\r\n    upon my present theme before or after my journey across the plains,\r\n    but I have come to the conclusion that it is in every way better that\r\n    I should do it now. Before leaving you, I had prepared, with the\r\n    knowledge only of Casswell\" (one of his Trinity Hall set), \"elaborate\r\n    plans for my long-thought-of visit to Australia.\r\n\r\n    \"After landing in the States, I came to think that, in spite of the\r\n    evident advantages to be gleaned by taking the two tours in one, you\r\n    might be seriously averse to my more lengthy absence. When, however, I\r\n    came to sketch out plans for the great work which I have long intended\r\n    some day to write, and of which I completed the first map during my\r\n    stay at Ottawa, I found that I must go to Australia before getting\r\n    very far through with the book, and that I could not be even so much\r\n    as certain of my basement and groundwork until after such a visit.\r\n\r\n    \"Were I to postpone my trip to Australia, I might find it impossible\r\n    ever to go there, remembering that it is not a tour which can be made\r\n    from England, at any time, much more quickly than I shall have made it\r\n    now; and whenever I did make it, you would have to expect an absence\r\n    more prolonged than that for which this letter will prepare you. Of\r\n    course that absence is fully as grievous to me as to you, and nothing\r\n    but necessity would drive me to it. Of course my going will depend\r\n    upon my health, and upon the letters I shall receive at San Francisco.\r\n    I have ample funds to take me as far as Sydney, and to enable me to\r\n    live there a long time, were anything to prevent your letters reaching\r\n    there as soon as I do. I enclose a letter to Knight for Tasmanian\r\n    introductions; you can no doubt get me Australian from Sir Daniel\r\n    Cooper and others. I propose to visit Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne,\r\n    Geelong, Adelaide, Hobart Town, Wellington, and Auckland, but the\r\n    order in which I take them, of course, depends on local circumstances.\r\n    Will you send me some money to Sydney, with such introductions as you\r\n    can get? If they don't turn up, I shall start a Shaker colony, or a\r\n    newspaper, or row people ashore from the emigrant ships.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the travellers halted to rest for some time at Denver, after six\r\ndays' journey across the plains, Charles Dilke, with a brain excited by\r\nthe keen atmosphere of the prairie, \"sketched out many projects of a\r\nliterary kind.\"\r\n\r\n    'In addition to my book on Radicalism, there was a plan for a book of\r\n    \"Political Geography\" based on the doctrine that geographical centres\r\n    ultimately become political centres--ideas which are also to be traced\r\n    in _Greater Britain_ under the name of Omphalism; and a scheme for a\r\n    book to be called \"The Anglo-Saxon Race or The English World,\" which\r\n    is noted as dating from June, 1862, and being a head under which\r\n    should be treated the infusion of foreign elements into the Saxon\r\n    world--such as, for example, Chinese immigration. A fifth work was to\r\n    be on \"International Law,\" in two parts--\"As it is,\" and \"As it might\r\n    be.\" Another was to be on the offer to an unembodied soul of the\r\n    alternatives of non-existence, or of birth accompanied by free-will,\r\n    followed by life in sin or life in Godliness.'\r\n\r\nBut all the time literature figured in his mind only as an accompaniment\r\nto political life. There was more than jest in the young man's answer to\r\nGovernor Gilpin of Colorado, when that dignitary suggested permanent stay\r\nin Denver, with promise of all sorts of honours and rewards in his infant\r\nstate. Charles Dilke writes home:\r\n\r\n    \"I told him that unless he would carry a constitutional amendment\r\n    allowing a foreign-born subject to be President of the United States,\r\n    he would not receive my services. This he said he would 'see about.'\"\r\n\r\nWhat underlay the jesting is set out in this letter to his brother Ashton,\r\nsent by the same mail that carried to his father news of the projected\r\njourney to Australia:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR ASHTON,\r\n\r\n    \"I write in English [Footnote: The brothers usually corresponded with\r\n    each other in French; see Chap. II., p. 15.] because I write of\r\n    serious matters, best to be talked over in our serious mother-tongue.\r\n    I shall also write very simply, saying exactly what I want you to\r\n    hear, and that in the plainest manner.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been thinking of late that in talking to you I may have failed\r\n    to make you comprehend why 'I wanted to make you do things that would\r\n    pay,' and that if I failed to lead you to look at these things as I\r\n    do, I must have debased your mind and done you as much harm as any man\r\n    can do his dearest friend. I will, then, in this memorandum explain my\r\n    views about you and your future, leaving it to you, my dear brother,\r\n    to apply or reject them as your judgment prompts, without letting your\r\n    love for me bias you in favour of my argument.\r\n\r\n    \"I believe that the bent of your mind is not unlike that of mine. My\r\n    aim in life is to be of the greatest use I can to the world at large,\r\n    not because that is my duty, but because that is the course which will\r\n    make my life happiest--_i.e._, my motives are selfish in the wide and\r\n    unusual sense of that word. I believe that, on account of my\r\n    temperament and education, I can be most useful as a statesman and as\r\n    a writer. I have, therefore, educated myself with a view to getting\r\n    such power as to make me able at all events to teach men my views,\r\n    whether or not they follow them. I believe that you and I together\r\n    would be more than twice as strong as each of us alone; I, therefore,\r\n    if you are not disinclined, wish to see you acting with me and ever\r\n    standing by my side in all love and happiness. To do this you must\r\n    make a name, and you must begin by making a name at Cambridge. If you\r\n    can go up to college 'a certain future first-class man'--then you can\r\n    give up classics if you like, and read other and more immediately\r\n    useful things--be President of the Union, and so on; but you cannot do\r\n    that from a god-like height unless you are 'a certain first.' So with\r\n    music, if you play at all, you must play like a whole band of seraphs\r\n    (as, indeed, you seem in a fair way to do). Of course, it is very easy\r\n    to say--Music is an art which, if cultivated merely because it will\r\n    'pay,' ceases to be either art or music. True! Quite true!! But only\r\n    true if you insert merely--merely because it will 'pay.' I think (I\r\n    may be wrong) that it is possible to cultivate it so as to 'pay,' and\r\n    yet love and reverence it (and yourself in it) as the highest form of\r\n    art.\r\n\r\n    \"Now I come to riding. I do most earnestly suggest that if you can\r\n    bring yourself to learn to ride so as to be able to ride an ordinary\r\n    horse along a road with perfect safety, you should do so. I am clear\r\n    that you cannot go into the diplomatic service without it. In travel\r\n    you must ride. If you can bring yourself to it at all, it must be at\r\n    once.\r\n\r\n    \"Now for my absence. Part of my plan is the writing of serious and\r\n    grave works, neither of which can be written until I have seen\r\n    Australia as well as America. I find it, then, a necessity to go\r\n    there; and I go there now, firstly because I have it within reach, and\r\n    secondly, because absence from all, and above all from you, dearest,\r\n    would be worse at any future time than now.\r\n\r\n    \"Keep, however, constantly before you the ultimate doing good or being\r\n    useful--which is (for I firmly hold the Jesuit doctrine, if it be\r\n    rightly understood) to justify the means.\r\n\r\n    \"I need hardly say that this talk is for you, and not even for father,\r\n    nor for Casswell.\r\n\r\n    \"Your devoted friend and brother,\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a prig he was!\" is scrawled across the page, as Charles Dilke's\r\njudgment on himself, when later the letter fell into his hands.\r\n\r\nBut, happily, in all the ordinary intercourse of life, ease and geniality\r\nwere native to him; he got on readily with all manner of men; and nothing\r\ncould have been better for him than the plunge into a society where all\r\nwas in the rough. He shed his priggishness once and for all somewhere on\r\nthe \"Great Divide.\" What makes the permanent charm of _Greater Britain_ is\r\nits sense of enjoyment, its delighted acceptance of new and unconventional\r\nways. In crossing the plains, he first made the experience of actual\r\nphysical privations, and for the first time saw and fell in love with \"the\r\nbright eyes of danger.\"\r\n\r\nThrough all the seriousness and solid concentration of _Greater Britain_\r\nthere runs a vein of high spirits. Facts are there, but with them is a\r\nferment of ideas and of feeling. Part of that feeling is just a contagious\r\ndelight in the joyous business of living. But the strong current which\r\nlifted him so buoyantly was an emotion which no shyness or stiffness\r\nhampered in the expression--in its essence an exultant patriotism of race.\r\nDemocracy meant to him in this stage of his development, not any abstract\r\ntheory of government, but the triumph of English ideas.\r\n\r\nCalifornia, then in the full rush of mining, was the touchstone of\r\nDemocracy; where, out of the chaos of blackguardism, through lynchings and\r\nvigilance committees, judge and jury were at work evolving decent security\r\nand settled government.\r\n\r\n    \"The wonder is\" (he wrote) \"not that, in such a State as California\r\n    was till lately, the machinery of government should work unevenly, but\r\n    that it should work at all. Democracy has never endured so rough a\r\n    test as that from which it has triumphantly emerged in the Golden\r\n    State and City....\r\n\r\n    \"California is too British to be typically American: it would seem\r\n    that nowhere in the United States have we found the true America or\r\n    the real American. Except as abstractions, they do not exist; it is\r\n    only by looking carefully at each eccentric and irregular America--at\r\n    Irish New York, at Puritan New England, at the rowdy South, at the\r\n    rough and swaggering Far West, at the cosmopolitan Pacific States--\r\n    that we come to reject the anomalous features, and to find America in\r\n    the points they possess in common. It is when the country is left that\r\n    there rises in the mind an image that soars above all local prejudice\r\n    --that of the America of the law-abiding, mighty people who are\r\n    imposing English institutions on the world.\" [Footnote: _Greater\r\n    Britain_ (popular edition), p. 193.]\r\n\r\nThe same thought is summed up in the chapter where he sets down his\r\nrecollected impressions on board the ship that carried him southwards\r\nalong the shores of America from the Golden Gate towards Panama:\r\n\r\n    \"A man may see American countries, from the pine-wastes of Maine to\r\n    the slopes of the Sierra; may talk with American men and women, from\r\n    the sober citizens of Boston to Digger Indians in California; may eat\r\n    of American dishes, from jerked buffalo in Colorado to clambakes on\r\n    the shores near Salem; and yet, from the time he first 'smells the\r\n    molasses' at Nantucket light-ship to the moment when the pilot quits\r\n    him at the Golden Gate, may have no idea of an America. You may have\r\n    seen the East, the South, the West, the Pacific States, and yet have\r\n    failed to find America. It is not till you have left her shores that\r\n    her image grows up in the mind.\r\n\r\n    \"The first thing that strikes the Englishman just landed in New York\r\n    is the apparent Latinization of the English in America; but before he\r\n    leaves the country, he comes to see that this is at most a local fact,\r\n    and that the true moral of America is the vigour of the English race--\r\n    the defeat of the cheaper by the dearer peoples, the victory of the\r\n    man whose food costs four shillings a day over the man whose food\r\n    costs four pence.\"[Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 216.]\r\n\r\nThat is the governing idea of the book--an idea in which were merged those\r\nother projects which passed before him when he halted at Denver; and it is\r\nset forth with most fulness and vigour in the opening chapters, which deal\r\nwith a \"Greater Britain\" that is outside the British Empire--with the\r\nBritain that no longer dwells under the British flag.\r\n\r\nHe left the Pacific shores in tremendous spirits, and on the voyage to New\r\nZealand was a provider of entertainment for his fellow-\r\npassengers, writing an _opéra bouffe_, _Oparo, or the Enchanting Isle_, in\r\nwhich he himself spoke the prologue as Neptune, 'two hundred miles west-\r\nsou'-west of Pitcairn Island.' His head might be full of politics and of\r\nthe ethics which touch on politics; but he was in the humour to turn his\r\nmind to jesting and to find material for comedy as well as for grave\r\ndiscourse in the advent of white men to cannibal islands.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the book is a sequel or corollary. English institutions are\r\nstudied in New Zealand and in Australia, among autonomous communities of\r\nBritons. Later on they are studied in Ceylon and India, where they have\r\ntheir application to white men, living not as part of a democracy, but as\r\nthe arbiters of their fate to Orientals.\r\n\r\nDilke's own exposition of this governing conception was set out in the\r\npreface to the book:\r\n\r\n    \"In 1866 and 1867 I followed England round the world: everywhere I was\r\n    in English-speaking or in English-governed lands. If I remarked that\r\n    climate, soil, manners of life, that mixture with other peoples, had\r\n    modified the blood, I saw, too, that in essentials the race was\r\n    always, one.\r\n\r\n    \"The idea which in all the length of my travels has been at once my\r\n    fellow and my guide--a key wherewith to unlock the hidden things of\r\n    strange new lands--is a conception, however imperfect, of the grandeur\r\n    of our race, already girdling the earth, which it is destined perhaps\r\n    eventually to overspread.\r\n\r\n    \"In America the peoples of the world are being fused together, but\r\n    they are run into an English mould: Alfred's laws and Chaucer's tongue\r\n    are theirs whether they would or no. There are men who say that\r\n    Britain in her age will claim the glory of having planted greater\r\n    Englands across the seas. They fail to perceive that she has done more\r\n    than found plantations of her own--that she has imposed her\r\n    institutions upon the offshoots of Germany, of Ireland, of\r\n    Scandinavia, and of Spain. Through America, England is speaking to the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n    \"Sketches of Saxondom may be of interest even upon humbler grounds:\r\n    the development of the England of Elizabeth is to be found, not in the\r\n    Britain of Victoria, but in half the habitable globe. If two small\r\n    islands are by courtesy styled 'Great,' America, Australia, India,\r\n    must form a 'Greater Britain.'\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote of this passage in his Memoir:\r\n\r\n    'The preface of _Greater Britain_, in which the title is justified and\r\n    explained, is the best piece of work of my life. It states the\r\n    doctrine on which our rule should be based--remembered in Canada--\r\n    forgotten in South Africa--the true as against the bastard\r\n    Imperialism. As will be seen from it, I included in my \"Greater\r\n    Britain\" our Magna Graecia of the United States. As late as 1880,\r\n    twelve years after the publication of my book, not only was the title\r\n    \"Greater Britain\" often used for the English world--as I used it--but,\r\n    speaking at the Lotus Club of New York, Mr. Whitelaw Reid used it\r\n    specially of the United States. Tom Hughes, he declared, \"led a\r\n    pioneer English colony to this Greater Britain, to seek here a fuller\r\n    expansion.\" It is contracting an idea which, as its author, I think\r\n    lofty and even noble, to use \"Greater Britain\" only of the British\r\n    Empire, as is now done.'\r\n\r\nThe touch of enthusiasm in this book lifted his writing to its highest\r\nplane. He himself was specially proud of the praise which P. G. Hamerton\r\nbestowed on the landscape passages: [Footnote: See Appendix, pp. 72, 73.]\r\nand they have the quality, which his grandfather schooled him in, of being\r\nreally descriptive. But his characteristic excellence is found far more in\r\nsuch a passage as that which follows his sketch of the time when \"the\r\nthinking men of Boston and the Cambridge professors, Emerson, Russell\r\nLowell, Asa Gray, and a dozen more ... morally seceded from their\r\ncountry's councils,\" because in those councils the slave-holders still had\r\nthe upper hand. Here are a few of its ringing sentences:\r\n\r\n    \"In 1863 and 1864 there came the reckoning. When America was first\r\n    brought to see the things that had been done in her name, and at her\r\n    cost, and, rising in her hitherto unknown strength, struck the noblest\r\n    blow for freedom that the world has seen, the men who had been urging\r\n    on the movement from without at once re-entered the national ranks,\r\n    and marched to victory. Of the men who sat beneath Longfellow, and\r\n    Agassiz, and Emerson, whole battalions went forth to war. From Oberlin\r\n    almost every male student and professor marched, and the University\r\n    teaching was left in the women's hands. Out of 8,000 school-teachers\r\n    in Pennsylvania, of whom 300 alone were drafted, 3,000 volunteered for\r\n    the war. Everywhere the students were foremost among the Volunteers,\r\n    and from that time forward America and her thinkers were at one.\"\r\n    [Footnote: _Greater Britain_ (popular edition), p. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe book was written at high pressure--in twelve months of desk work,\r\nbeginning in June, 1867, when the traveller returned from his year's\r\nwandering--and it was not written under favourable conditions. He had\r\ncontracted malaria in Ceylon, which gradually destroyed his appetite, and\r\nso induced a state of weakness leading to delirium at night. The end was\r\nan attack of typhoid fever, which came on while the book was still in the\r\npress; and his father, thinking it important to hurry the publication,\r\ntook on himself to correct the proofs while his son was ill. The result\r\nwas a crop of blunders; but nothing interfered with the unforeseen success\r\nof the book, which was published in the last months of 1868. Large\r\nportions of the work were translated into Russian, its circulation in\r\nAmerica was enormous (under a pirate flag), and in England it rapidly ran\r\nthrough three editions, and was praised in the newspapers almost without\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nIn the reviews which appeared there stood out a general acceptance of the\r\nbook as fair and friendly to all. In spite of its audacious patriotism, it\r\nwas no way limited in sympathy. This fairness of mind received the homage\r\nof Thiers in a great defence of his Protectionist budget. \"Un membre du\r\nparlement d'Angleterre, qui est certainement un des hommes les plus\r\néclairés de son pays, M. Wentworth Dilke, vient d'écrire un livre des plus\r\nremarquables,\" he said, and pressed the argument that Charles Dilke's\r\ndefence of Protection from the American and Australian point of view\r\ngained authority by the very fact that its author was _libre-échangiste\r\nd'Europe_. Dilke always called himself, more accurately, \"a geographical\r\nFree Trader.\" He accepted, that is to say, the doctrine for Great Britain\r\nunreservedly, only because of Great Britain's geographical conditions.\r\nThis was very different from the orthodox English Liberal's view of Free\r\nTrade as a universal maxim to be accepted under penalty of political\r\nexcommunication.\r\n\r\nOn a matter of even wider import for Imperial statesmanship his sympathies\r\nwere at once and clearly declared. From this his first entry into the\r\narena of public debate he was the champion of the dark-skinned peoples--\r\nall the more, perhaps, because he recognized clearly that the Anglo-Saxons\r\nwere \"the only extirpating race.\" In lands where white men could rear\r\ntheir children it seemed to him inevitable that the Anglo-Saxon race\r\nshould replace the coloured peoples as, to take his own illustration, the\r\nEnglish fly was superseding all other flies in New Zealand. Yet at least\r\nwhile the American-Indians or the Maoris remained, he was determined to\r\nsecure justice for them; and he incurred angry criticism for outspoken\r\ncondemnation of English dealing with the natives in Tasmania. But a great\r\npart of his book is devoted to discussion of questions which must be of\r\nconstant recurrence, affecting the relations of Englishmen to natives in\r\nlands where the English are only a governing handful. These matters\r\nreceived special comment in a letter from John Stuart Mill at Avignon on\r\nFebruary 9th, 1869. Mill, although a stranger to Dilke, was moved to write\r\nhis commendation in the most ungrudging terms:\r\n\r\n    \"It is long\" (he said) \"since any book connected with practical\r\n    politics has been published on which I build such high hopes of the\r\n    future usefulness and distinction of the writer, showing, as it does,\r\n    that he not only possesses a most unusual amount of real knowledge on\r\n    many of the principal questions of the future, but a mind strongly\r\n    predisposed to what are (at least in my opinion) the most advanced and\r\n    enlightened views of them.\r\n\r\n    \"There are so few opinions expressed in any part of your book with\r\n    which I do not, so far as my knowledge extends, fully and heartily\r\n    coincide, that I feel impelled to take the liberty of noting the small\r\n    number of points of any consequence on which I differ from you. These\r\n    relate chiefly to India; though on that subject also I agree with you\r\n    to a much greater extent than I differ. Not only do I most cordially\r\n    sympathize with all you say about the insolence of the English even in\r\n    India to the native population, which has now become not only a\r\n    disgrace, but, as you have so usefully shown, a danger to our dominion\r\n    there; but I have been much struck by the sagacity which, in so short\r\n    a stay as yours must have been, has enabled you to detect facts which\r\n    are as yet obvious to very few: as, for instance, the immense increase\r\n    of all the evils and dangers you have pointed out by the substitution\r\n    of the Queen's army for a local force of which both men and officers\r\n    had at least a comparatively permanent tie to the country; and again,\r\n    that the superior authority in England, having the records of all the\r\n    presidencies before it, and corresponding regularly with them all, is\r\n    the only authority which really knows India; the local governments and\r\n    offices only knowing, at most, their own part of it, and having\r\n    generally strong prejudices in favour of the peculiarities of the\r\n    system of government there adopted, and against those of the other\r\n    party.\" [Footnote: James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill, was the\r\n    historian of India, and for a long time one amongst its official\r\n    rulers at the India House.]\r\n\r\nThen followed an exhaustive and very friendly criticism, in which the most\r\ninteresting points are his challenge of Dilke's proposal to make the\r\nSecretary of State for India a permanent office, not changing with party\r\nupheavals, and, lastly, this:\r\n\r\n    \"If there is any criticism of a somewhat broader character that I\r\n    could make, I think it would be this--that (in speaking of the\r\n    physical and moral characteristics of the populations descended from\r\n    the English) you sometimes express yourself almost as if there were no\r\n    sources of national character but race and climate, as if whatever\r\n    does not come from race must come from climate, and whatever does not\r\n    come from climate must come from race. But as you show in many parts\r\n    of your book a strong sense of the good and bad influences of\r\n    education, legislation, and social circumstances, the only inference I\r\n    draw is that you do not, perhaps, go so far as I do myself in\r\n    believing these last causes to be of prodigiously greater efficacy\r\n    than either race or climate, or the two combined.\"\r\n\r\nThe writing of this letter marked the beginning of a friendship which\r\nlasted till Mill's death. If the book had done nothing but secure Dilke\r\nthis friend, it would have been well rewarded. But rewards were not\r\nlacking. The fortunate author was crowned with a great popular success\r\ninvaluable for a young man about to enter political life. Yet more\r\nimportant even than the prestige acquired was the sum of experience\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM \"LANDSCAPE,\" BY PHILIP GILBERT HAMERTON\r\n\r\n\r\nA traveller who did not set out with the intention of word-painting, but\r\nto see how men of English race fared wherever they had settled, said that\r\n'travellers soon learn, when making estimates of a country's value, to\r\ndespise no feature of the landscape.' If Sir Charles Dilke wrote that\r\nrather from the political than the artistic point of view, it is not the\r\nless accurate in any case, for the landscape, however uninteresting it may\r\nseem, or even ugly, is never without its great influence on human\r\nhappiness and destiny. The interest in human affairs which Sir Charles\r\nDilke has in common with most men of any conspicuous ability, does not\r\nprevent him from seeing landscape-nature as well as if his travels had no\r\nother object. His description of the Great Plains of Colorado is an\r\nexcellent example of that valuable kind of description which is not merely\r\nan artful arrangement of sonorous words, but perfectly conveys the\r\ncharacter of the landscape, and makes you feel as if you had been there.\r\n\r\n    \"Now great roaring uplands of enormous sweep, now boundless grassy\r\n    plains; there is all the grandeur of monotony and yet continual\r\n    change. Sometimes the distances are broken by blue buttes, or rugged\r\n    bluffs. Over all there is a sparkling atmosphere and never-failing\r\n    breeze; the air is bracing even when most hot, the sky is cloudless,\r\n    and no rain falls. A solitude which no words can paint, the boundless\r\n    prairie swell conveys an idea of vastness which is the overpowering\r\n    feature of the Plains.... The impression is not merely one of size.\r\n    There is perfect beauty, wondrous fertility, in the lonely steppe; no\r\n    patriotism, no love of home, can prevent the traveller wishing here to\r\n    end his days.\r\n\r\n    \"To those who love the sea, there is here a double charm. Not only is\r\n    the roll of the prairie as grand as that of the Atlantic, but the\r\n    crispness of the wind, the absence of trees, the multitude of tiny\r\n    blooms upon the sod, all conspire to give a feeling of nearness to the\r\n    ocean, the effect of which is that we are always expecting to hail it\r\n    from the top of the next hillock....\r\n\r\n    \"The colour of the landscape is, in summer, green and flowers; in\r\n    fall-time, yellow and flowers, but flowers ever.\" [Footnote: _Greater\r\n    Britain_, p. 80 (popular edition).]\r\n\r\nIf the reader will take the trouble to analyze this description, he will\r\nperceive that, although powerful, it is extremely simple and sober. The\r\ntraveller does not call in the aid of poetical comparisons (the only\r\ncomparison indulged in is the obvious one of the Atlantic), and the effect\r\nof the description on the mind is due to the extreme care with which the\r\nwriter has put together in a short space the special and peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the scenery, not forgetting to tell us everything that\r\nwe of ourselves would naturally fail to imagine. He corrects, one after\r\nanother, all our erroneous notions, and substitutes a true idea for our\r\nfalse ones. The describer has been thoroughly alive; he has travelled with\r\nhis eyes open; so that every epithet tells. The reader feels under a real\r\nobligation; he has not been put off with mere phrases, but is enriched\r\nwith a novel and interesting landscape experience.\r\n\r\nIn a good prose description, such as these by Kingsley and Sir Charles\r\nDilke, the author has nothing to do but to convey, as nearly as he can, a\r\ntrue impression of what he has actually seen. The greatest difficulties\r\nthat he has to contend against are the ignorance and the previous\r\nmisconceptions of his readers. He must give information without appearing\r\ndidactic, and correct what he foresees as probable false conceptions,\r\nwithout ostentatiously pretending to know better. His language must be as\r\nconcise as possible, or else important sentences will be skipped; and yet\r\nat the same time it must flow easily enough to be pleasantly readable. It\r\nis not easy to fulfil these conditions all at once, and therefore we meet\r\nwith many books of travel in which attempted descriptions frequently\r\noccur, which fail, nevertheless, to convey a clear idea of the country. A\r\nweak writer wastes precious space in sentimental phrases or in vain\r\nadjectives that would be equally applicable to many other places, and\r\nforgets to note what is peculiarly and especially characteristic of the\r\none place that he is attempting to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nELECTION TO PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the writing of Greater Britain, Charles Dilke entered\r\nupon the main business of his life by coming forward as a candidate for\r\nthe House of Commons. Immediate action was necessary; for the position of\r\nparties indicated the near approach of a General Election.\r\n\r\nThe constituency to which he addressed his candidature in the autumn of\r\n1867 was the borough of Chelsea, a new Parliamentary division created by\r\nthe Reform Act of that year. It was of vast extent, embracing Chelsea,\r\nFulham, Hammersmith, Kensal Town, and Kensington. In Chelsea Charles Dilke\r\nhad his home, and, as representing the Parliamentary borough, he would\r\nspeak \"backed by the vote and voice of 30,000 electors.\" \"I would\r\nwillingly wait any time,\" he said in his opening address on November 25th,\r\nin the Vestry Hall at Chelsea, \"rather than enter the House of Commons a\r\nmember for some small trumpery constituency.\" The electors should hear his\r\nopinions, \"not upon any one subject or upon any two subjects or any three,\r\nbut as nearly as might be upon all.\"\r\n\r\nHis speech began with the electoral machinery of democracy--questions of\r\nfranchise and redistribution.\r\n\r\nPurity of election he laid down as a necessary condition of reform, and to\r\nthat end two points must be assured: the removal of election petitions\r\nfrom the House of Commons to a legal tribunal, [Footnote: A Bill with that\r\nobject was at the time passing through Parliament.] and, secondly, the\r\nsecurity of the ballot. Upon the first matter he came perhaps to doubt the\r\nnew system after he had seen it tried; upon the second he was able to tell\r\nhis audience from first-hand knowledge that in Australia opposition to the\r\nballot was unknown, and that in Virginia a conquered minority looked to it\r\nas their best defence against oppression.\r\n\r\nFrom the machinery of Government he passed to its application. Ireland was\r\nthen the burning question, and Dilke's attitude upon Ireland may be\r\nindicated in a sentence. After the Church should have been disestablished,\r\nthe land system reformed, [Footnote: His views on the Irish Land Question\r\nhad been stated in _Greater Britain_ (popular edition), p. 209: \"Customs\r\nand principles of law, the natural growth of the Irish mind and the Irish\r\nsoil, can be recognized and made the basis of legislation without bringing\r\nabout the disruption of the Empire. The first Irish question that we shall\r\nhave to set ourselves to face is that of land. Permanent tenure is as\r\nnatural to the Irish as free-holding to the English people. All that is\r\nneeded of our statesmen is that they recognize in legislation that which\r\nthey cannot but admit in private talk--namely, that there may be essential\r\ndifferences between race and race.\"] and a wide measure of Parliamentary\r\nreform given to Ireland; after they should have passed Fawcett's Bill \"for\r\nthrowing open Trinity College, Dublin, and destroying the last trace of\r\nthat sectarian spirit which has hitherto been allowed to rule in Ireland\"\r\n--they might hope \"not perhaps for instant quiet in the country, but at\r\nleast for the gradual growth of a feeling that we have done our duty, and\r\nthat we may well call upon the Irish to do theirs.\"\r\n\r\nThere went with that a moderate censure upon the lawlessness of Fenianism.\r\nBut the Irish question did not occupy so much space in his discourse as in\r\nthose of most speakers at that moment, and this for a reason which he gave\r\nlater in his life: 'About Ireland I was never given to saying much,\r\nbecause, except for a short time in 1885, when moderate Home Rule could\r\nhave been carried, I never thoroughly saw my own way.' But as early as\r\n1869 he deplored the lack of local deliberative bodies which elsewhere did\r\nmuch of the State's work, and in 1871 he advocated their creation as a\r\nmeans of relieving Parliament. This, rather than any special sympathy with\r\nNationalism as such, was always the governing consideration with him on\r\nthe Irish question. 'I showed in this way,' he notes, 'a working of the\r\nopinion which in 1874 caused me to vote, alone of English members\r\nunpledged by their constituents, in support of Mr. Butt when he brought\r\nforward his Home Rule Bill.' [Footnote: Eight in all voted; all except\r\nDilke represented Northern constituencies, with a large Irish vote among\r\nminers or operatives.]\r\n\r\nHe foreshadowed also his attitude towards Labour questions. He proposed,\r\nas early as 1867, that the Factory Acts should be extended to all\r\nemployment; the best way of compelling children to attend school was, he\r\nthought, to prohibit their employment as premature wage-earners. Another\r\ndeclaration set forth that Trade Unions must be recognized, and their\r\nfunds protected just as much as those \"of any association formed for\r\npurposes not illegal.\" By no means were all Liberals in 1867 ready to\r\ndistinguish between Trade Unions and criminal conspiracies.\r\n\r\nTaxation came next. His desire to \"sweep away many millions of Customs and\r\nExcise,\" and to establish a system so far as possible of direct taxation,\r\nis notable because it was put forward at the very moment when he was\r\nexplaining in _Greater Britain_ to the precisians of Free Trade that young\r\ncountries, like America and the Colonies, had reasonable grounds for\r\nmaintaining a rigid Protective system.\r\n\r\nQuestions put at this first meeting with the electors elicited a\r\ndeclaration for triennial Parliaments; if these failed, then for annual;\r\nfor payment of members, with preference for the plan of payment by the\r\nconstituency, advocated by \"Mr. Mill, the great leader of political\r\nthinkers.\" As to manhood suffrage, the candidate held \"that the burden of\r\nproof lies on those who would exclude any man from the suffrage; but I\r\nalso hold that there is sufficient proof for the temporary exclusion of\r\ncertain classes at the present time.\"\r\n\r\nThis, with some other points in the exposition of his political creed,\r\nneeds to be read in the light of a passage in the Memoir:\r\n\r\n    'I tried to be moderate in order to please my father, and not to lose\r\n    the general Liberal vote; my speeches are more timid than were my\r\n    opinions.'\r\n\r\nYet for all his efforts after moderation he was too extreme for his\r\nfather, who probably was shocked to hear that the Game Laws \"needed an\r\namendment, which should extend perhaps to their total abolition.\" Sir\r\nWentworth Dilke remonstrated. His son replied in December, 1867:\r\n\r\n    \"I am a Radical, I know; still I have for your sake done everything I\r\n    can to speak moderately. I have spoken against Fenianism in spite of\r\n    my immense sympathy for it. For my own part, though I should immensely\r\n    like to be in Parliament, still I should feel terribly hampered there\r\n    if I went in as anything except a Radical.... Radicalism is too much a\r\n    thing of nature with me to throw it off by any effort of mine. If you\r\n    think it a waste of money for me to contest Chelsea, I will cheerfully\r\n    throw the thing up and turn to any pursuit you please.\"\r\n\r\nMany other matters which were to occupy Charles Dilke later are mentioned\r\nin this first and detailed exposition of his political faith. He dealt\r\nwith army reform: would abolish \"purchase of commissions and flogging\"; he\r\ncondemned \"an army in which we systematically deny a man those advantages\r\nthat in entering an employment he naturally looked to receive,\" and the\r\ndouble responsibility of the Horse Guards and the War Office as \"a system\r\nwhich is in its very essence costly and inefficient.\" On Foreign Affairs\r\nhe said: \"I am very wishful indeed for peace, but a peace more dignified\r\nthan that which has of late prevailed.\" [Footnote: Speech in Chelsea,\r\nNovember 25th, 1867.]\r\n\r\nHe spoke at Chelsea, Kensington, Hammersmith, Fulham, Brompton, Notting\r\nHill, and Walham Green, earning from the electors the name of Mr.\r\nIndefatigable Dilke. The borough deserved that a man who sought to\r\nrepresent it should state his case thoroughly, and there was an uncommon\r\ndegree of truth in a not uncommon compliment when he called it \"the most\r\nintelligent constituency in England.\" South Kensington was the home of\r\nmany judges and other important lawyers, many great merchants and men of\r\nbusiness; Brompton was still a literary quarter; Holland Park and Notting\r\nHill the home of the artists who figured largely on Dilke's committee--the\r\nnames of Leighton, Maclise, Faed, and other Academicians are among the\r\nlist. The honorary committee was made up almost entirely of resident\r\nMembers of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn Kensal Town was a very strong artisan element, and at one time a\r\nworking-man candidate was before the electors, George Odger, who was 'the\r\nbest representative of the Trade Unions, and a man of whom the highest\r\nopinion was entertained by Mr. Mill.' He not only withdrew, but became\r\nalso an active supporter.\r\n\r\nOf the Tory candidates, perhaps the more important was Mr. Freake, a big\r\ncontractor who had built Cromwell Road, in which he lived, and who was not\r\non the best of terms with his workmen. Some of this unpopularity reflected\r\nitself on the allied candidature of Dr. W. H. Russell, whose expenses Mr.\r\nFreake was said to be paying. But the contest led to a lasting friendship\r\nbetween Charles Dilke and the famous war correspondent. The other Liberal\r\ncandidate was Sir Henry Hoare, a Radical baronet, twenty years older than\r\nDilke, who had for a short time sat as member for Windsor. So long as he\r\nrepresented Chelsea he voted with the extreme Radicals, and his name may\r\nbe found in many division lists in the minority along with that of his\r\ncolleague. But later in life he changed his politics, joined the Carlton\r\nClub, and was a member of it for many years. Charles Dilke always spoke of\r\nhim in terms of cordial friendship even after their political association\r\nhad long been ended.\r\n\r\nTheir candidature was not a joint one, as Dilke put himself forward\r\nindependently; but when the election actually came the Liberal candidates\r\njoined forces, and two picture-cards represent the contest as between\r\nrival teams of cocks. In one the Odger cock is seen retreating; Freake is\r\non his back, gasping; Russell and Hoare still contend, while under the\r\nbanner \"Dilke and Hoare for ever,\" Dilke crows victorious. In the second\r\ncard Odger has no place, and Russell is as dead as Freake.\r\n\r\nThis graphic forecast was justified by the result. Polling took place on\r\nWednesday, November 18th, 1868, and, according to a local paper, \"the\r\nproceedings were of a most orderly character; indeed, the absence of\r\nvehicles, favours, etc., made the election dull.\" The voting was open. The\r\nresults were published from hour to hour at the booths, and the unpopular\r\ncandidates were in one or two places driven away by hisses. Even in\r\nCromwell Road Dilke and Hoare led, and Dilke's advantage in his own\r\ndistrict of Chelsea proper was conspicuous. The final figures were:\r\n\r\n    Dilke........  7,374\r\n    Hoare........  7,183\r\n    Russell......  4,177\r\n    Freake.......  3,929\r\n\r\nThe triumph was all the more gratifying because it had been achieved by a\r\nvolunteer canvass. No member has ever been bound to a constituency by\r\ncloser ties of personal feeling than those which linked Charles Dilke,\r\nfirst to Chelsea and later to the Forest of Dean. He worked for his\r\nconstituents, and taught them to work for him.\r\n\r\nAt this same General Election Sir Wentworth Dilke lost his seat, and Lord\r\nGranville sent him a note \"to condole with you and to congratulate you. I\r\nsuspect that the cause of the latter gives you more pleasure than the\r\ncause of the former gives you regret. How very well your son seems to have\r\ndone!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the election Charles Dilke sought a rest by one of his flying trips\r\nabroad. He stopped a day in Paris to examine the details of the French\r\nregistration system. Thence he proceeded to Toulon, 'to which I took a\r\nfancy, which ultimately led, many years after, to my buying a property\r\nthere'; the scenery of Provence captured him from the first moment.\r\n\r\nParliament was summoned to meet on December 10th for the election of a\r\nSpeaker, and for the swearing-in of members. By the beginning of December\r\nthe member for Chelsea was on the eve of return, rejoicing in the news of\r\nMr. Gladstone's defeat in South-West Lancashire and election for\r\nGreenwich. \"He is much more likely to become a democratic leader now that\r\nhe sits for a big town.\"\r\n\r\nA note preserved in one of the boxes gives Charles Dilke's first\r\nimpressions of the party and Government to which he had vowed a somewhat\r\nqualified allegiance.\r\n\r\n    \"_December 10th_, 1868.--House met for election of Speaker. The\r\n    Liberal party is more even in opinion than ever before. No\r\n    Adullamites, no Radicals but myself. The Cabinet is somewhat behind\r\n    the party, which is bad. Too many peers.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons of 1868 was superficially very much like any of its\r\npredecessors. Dilke notes that it 'contained some survivals of the old\r\ndays, such as Mr. Edward Ellice, son of \"Bear\" Ellice [Footnote: This was\r\nMr. Edward Ellice, who had been in the House since 1836, and who continued\r\nto represent St. Andrews till 1879. He was sometimes called \"the young\r\nBear.\" See _Life of Lord Granville_, i. 80, 81, 141, 171, 175, as to the\r\n\"old Bear.\"] of the days of Lord Melbourne,' a consistent and typical\r\nLiberal. The Liberal party consisted then mainly of men born into that\r\ngoverning class which Lord Melbourne had in mind when he said \"that every\r\nEnglish gentleman is qualified to hold any post which he has influence\r\nenough to secure.\" This element was accompanied by a fair sprinkling of\r\nmanufacturers and other business men, for the most part Nonconformists.\r\nBut no separate Irish party existed to complicate the grouping; indeed,\r\nthe Irish were much less a corps apart than they had been in O'Connell's\r\ntime. Labour had not one direct representative, though the importance of\r\nthe artisan vote had made itself felt; and this was recognized by the\r\nchoice of Mundella, then returned as a new member for Sheffield, to second\r\nthe address at the opening of the session.\r\n\r\nThe personal composition of the assembly had greatly altered. More than a\r\nthird of its members were new to Parliament. W. Vernon Harcourt, Henry\r\nJames, and Campbell-Bannerman, sat then for the first time, and sat, as\r\ndid Charles Dilke, below the gangway. In the same quarter was Fawcett, who\r\nhelped them in creating the new phenomenon of a House of Commons alive in\r\nall its parts.\r\n\r\nSir George Trevelyan, who almost alone of living men can compare from\r\nexperience the House of Commons before the Reform Bill of 1867 and after,\r\nholds that it would be difficult to overstate the contrast. The House was\r\nno longer an arena for set combat between a few distinguished\r\nparliamentarians, whose displays were watched by followers on either side,\r\neither diffident of their ability to compete, or held silent by the\r\nunwritten rule which imposed strict reserve upon a new member. For the\r\ngreater number promotion had come through slow and steady service in the\r\nlobbies.\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke from the first was always in his place--that corner seat\r\nbelow the gangway which became gradually his traditional possession; and\r\nfrom the first he assumed a responsible part in all Parliamentary\r\nbusiness. \"He was the true forerunner, in his processes, his industry, his\r\nconstant attendance, and his frequent speaking, of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill.\" The revolt against 'the old gang' began on the Liberal side,\r\nand Charles Dilke was the chief beginner of it. Although the new Reform\r\nAct had led to far-reaching change in the quality of the House of Commons,\r\nthe choice by Mr. Gladstone of the members of the Ministry made it plain\r\nthat no break with the past was contemplated by the leaders. Lowe, whose\r\nanti-democratic utterances on Reform had been denounced by Dilke at the\r\nCambridge Union, was Chancellor of the Exchequer; and only half the\r\nCabinet were commoners. Among these was indeed Bright; but the only other\r\nMinister whose name carried a hint of Radicalism was Forster, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Council of Education, and he was not in the Cabinet when\r\nit was first formed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Bright and Forster were to an exceptional degree\r\nresponsible for the general trend of the Government policy. The\r\ndissolution and election had turned with more than usual definiteness on a\r\nclear issue--the proposal to conciliate Ireland by disestablishing the\r\nprivileged Church of the minority; and behind this immediate proposal lay\r\na less clearly defined scheme for giving security of tenure to Irish\r\ntenants. Ireland was the first business of Charles Dilke's first\r\nParliament, and it was Bright more than any other man who had stirred\r\nEnglish feeling with the sense that England had failed in her duty to the\r\nsmaller country, and that an attempt to do justice must be made. Yet in\r\nboth Church reform and land reform the actual brunt of the Parliamentary\r\nstruggle fell upon Mr. Gladstone. Bright had a marvellous gift for rousing\r\npolitical emotion, but he had not the application necessary to give\r\nlegislative effect to his aims; and Charles Dilke, though fully sensitive\r\nto the beauty of cadence in Bright's language, and enthusiastic for the\r\nmusic of \"his unmatched voice,\" nevertheless inherited something of his\r\ngrandfather's suspicion of \"that old humbug Oratory\"--at all events, when\r\nthe oratorical gift was not allied with executive capacity.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of masterful grip and handling of detail in the other\r\ngreat orator of the Liberal party, yet the young Radical's attitude to his\r\nleader was one of admiration indeed, but always of limited sympathy. Not\r\nonly did a long generation lie between them, but Charles Dilke had been\r\nbred a Radical, and Gladstone had been bred a Tory. The Government policy\r\nafter 1868 was dominated by the education controversy, and was dictated by\r\nForster. There was probably no man among his colleagues with whom Dilke\r\nmore often came into collision. Forster was a strong natural Conservative,\r\nthough he had been brought up in the traditions of Radicalism, and Mr.\r\nGladstone was suspected of not being willing to abolish Collegiate as well\r\nas University tests.\r\n\r\nOn the Opposition front bench Disraeli's primacy was not less marked than\r\nMr. Gladstone's, and his romantic figure always fascinated Dilke. But his\r\nspecial admiration was for Gathorne Hardy (afterwards Lord Cranbrook), in\r\nwhom High Toryism found its most eloquent and sincerest spokesman. Later,\r\nin 1876, Sir Charles was to complain ironically that the Conservatives\r\n\"never will be able to employ the services of the man best fitted by\r\nnature to be their leader. Mr. Gathorne Hardy will never lead the\r\nConservative party because he is not a Liberal.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869 he saw little of either the Tories or the Whigs, 'but acted with\r\nthe Radicals.' He had modified his first estimate of the composition of\r\nthe House. This Radical group largely represented the industrial towns and\r\nNonconformist interests. It included Peter Rylands, member for Warrington;\r\nPeter Taylor, member for Leicester; Henry Richard, member for Merthyr\r\nTydvil; George Anderson, member for Glasgow; and Llewellyn Dillwyn, member\r\nfor Swansea. Some, such as Peter Taylor, were theoretical Republicans, but\r\nall were peace-at-any-price men, Bright's votaries, though when Bright\r\njoined the Government they were ready to vote against Bright.\r\n\r\nThe group contained also some men of Charles Dilke's own stamp, with whom\r\nCambridge associations created a bond. 'Harcourt, of whom I saw much, was\r\nthen a below-the-gangway Radical.' He, though sixteen years Dilke's\r\nsenior, was also a newcomer, but a newcomer well known already at\r\nWestminster by his famous letters to the _Times_, signed \"Historicus,\" and\r\nby his career at the Parliamentary bar. Another was Lord Edmond\r\nFitzmaurice, who had been Charles Dilke's contemporary and coadjutor at\r\nthe Union. A great figure in the Radical group came from Trinity Hall--\r\nFawcett, who had first won his seat for Brighton in 1865.\r\n\r\nAmong Government Liberals, Lord Granville in the House of Lords was an\r\nhereditary friend, through his attachment to Dilke's father, but belonged\r\nto a much older generation. Grant Duff, a man to whom later on Dilke came\r\nto be strongly attached, was Under-Secretary of State for India. From the\r\nfirst, however, a close alliance formed itself between Charles Dilke and a\r\njunior member of the Government, who had still been debating at the Union\r\nwhen Dilke came to Trinity Hall. Entering Parliament in 1865, Mr.\r\nTrevelyan had distinguished himself by a vigorous campaign against the\r\nsystem of purchase in the Army, and, in 1868, he was put in office as\r\nJunior Lord of the Admiralty. Senior to Charles Dilke by five years, he\r\nhad not known him at Cambridge; but they \"speedily became very intimate.\"\r\nSo writes Sir George Trevelyan in a letter of 1911:\r\n\r\n    \"I was a very young Minister, worked hard all day by Mr. Childers, a\r\n    very strict but very friendly taskmaster, and never, according to the\r\n    Treasury Bench discipline of those heroic times, allowed to be absent\r\n    from the House of Commons for a single moment. I used to come to the\r\n    House unlunched, and desperately hungry; and I got my dinner at four\r\n    o'clock in an empty dining-room. Afternoon after afternoon, Charles\r\n    Dilke used to come and sit with me; and a greater delight than his\r\n    company, young to the young, I can hardly describe. But it does not\r\n    need description to you, for never did anyone's talk alter less as\r\n    time went on. The last time I saw him was at the swearing-in of Privy\r\n    Councillors last May (1910), when we talked for half an hour as if we\r\n    were respectively thirty and five-and-twenty years old.\"\r\n\r\nAn enrichment of that talk, as his friend remembers it, lay in Charles\r\nDilke's multifarious knowledge. \"This man seems to know all about\r\neverything in the world,\" someone remarked in those days. \"Yes,\" was the\r\nanswer, \"and last week we were talking about the other world: Dilke seemed\r\nto know all about that too.\"\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Charles Dilke to choose for his maiden effort the\r\nmost highly technical of subjects, and one which lent itself as little as\r\npossible to tricks of oratory. He would recall how Mr. George Melly, the\r\nmember for Stoke-on-Trent, had cautioned him: \"Don't talk to them about\r\nGod Almighty; even Mr. Gladstone can't; they'll only stand it from John\r\nBright.\" On March 9th, 1869, Mr. William Vernon Harcourt (as he then was)\r\ncame forward with a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee to\r\ninquire into registration in Parliamentary boroughs. Upon this Charles\r\nDilke made his first speech, filled with detailed knowledge, and with\r\nsuggestions drawn from French procedure. Later speakers recognized the\r\nspecial competence shown, and when the Select Committee was appointed, he\r\nwas named to serve on it--thus taking his place at once in the normal\r\nworking life of the House.\r\n\r\n    'I acquired in the early months of this Session a knowledge of the\r\n    registration and rating systems which lasted for a good many years,\r\n    and the plan for the restoration of compounding, which was accepted by\r\n    Mr. Goschen and moved by him in the form of new clauses in his Bill in\r\n    April, 1869, was of my suggestion. By the joint operation of this\r\n    plan, and of the Registration Act of 1878, which was my own, an\r\n    immense increase of the electorate in boroughs was effected.'\r\n\r\nNo subject could have appeared less attractive than all this dull lore of\r\ncompound householders and lodger's franchises.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of official Liberalism was constantly at war with Radical\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n    'My diary continually expressed my regret at what I thought the\r\n    timidity of Mr. Gladstone's Government.' Thus, when it was beaten by\r\n    the abstention of Liberals on Fawcett's Election Expenses Bill, which\r\n    proposed to throw the necessary expenses of returning officers on the\r\n    local rates, Charles Dilke 'was angry with the Government for not\r\n    having so much as named the Bill upon their Whip.' Again, when his\r\n    group had proposed to penalize a corrupt borough, the member for which\r\n    had been unseated on petition, the entry ran: 'We Radicals beaten by\r\n    Government and Tories on the Bewdley writ,' the issue of which the\r\n    Radicals had moved to postpone for twelve months.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Fawcett's motion to abolish University Tests, of whose\r\ninjustice Dilke had personal experience: [Footnote: Having taken his\r\nMaster's degree at Cambridge in this year, Dilke was 'immediately\r\nnominated to the Senate as an examiner for the Law Tripos by the Regius\r\nProfessor of Laws.' But on further inquiry it appeared that an examiner\r\nfor honours in Law must be a member of the Senate, and that a member of\r\nthe Senate must declare himself a member of the Church of England. Dilke,\r\nstrongly objecting to this exclusiveness, had refused to make the required\r\nprofession. The 'grace,' therefore, was withdrawn, and he was not allowed\r\nto examine. Sir Roundell Palmer became Chancellor in 1872, on the\r\nretirement of Lord Hatherley. He was again Chancellor from 1880 to 1885.]\r\n\r\n    'My diary records a division in connection with which Sir Roundell\r\n    Palmer did us some harm, the fact being that the great lawyer, who was\r\n    afterwards Lord Selborne, was one of those gentlemen calling\r\n    themselves Liberals in whom it was difficult to find any agreement\r\n    with Liberal principles at any time or upon any subject. He was, in\r\n    fact, a High Church Tory, as I found when I served with him in a\r\n    Liberal Cabinet.'\r\n\r\nOn yet another motion of Fawcett's the Radicals found themselves in\r\ncollision with the head of the Liberal Government. This advocated open\r\ncompetition for the Civil Service, and Dilke supported Fawcett by speech\r\nas well as vote. Mr. Gladstone, following Dilke in the debate, suggested\r\nthat he had spoken without examining his facts, a charge specially\r\ncalculated to excite this conscientious worker's resentment. 'I recorded a\r\nstrong opinion as to the crushing of independent members by Mr.\r\nGladstone.'\r\n\r\nCharles Dilke was already displaying that blend of opinions which made him\r\nalways a trial to the party Whips. He notes that, 'taking as I did an\r\nindependent line, I supported on the Navy Estimates the Conservative ex-\r\nchief First Lord of the Admiralty' (Mr. Corry) 'on a motion which\r\ndeprecated the building of further turret ships till those already built\r\nhad been tested.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR C. WENTWORTH DILKE, BART.\r\nFrom the painting by Arthur Hughes.]\r\n\r\nThese outbreaks of independence led to remonstrance from his father, and\r\nremonstrance to this reply:\r\n\r\n    \"I don't mean to let either you or Glyn\" (the Chief Whip, afterwards\r\n    Lord Wolverton) \"frighten me into supporting the Government when I\r\n    think they are wrong, but I vote for them when I am at all doubtful.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written to Sir Wentworth Dilke, then on a tour through the\r\nnorth of Europe with his son Ashton, by this time a Cambridge\r\nundergraduate, and inclined to regard his elder brother as a very timid\r\npolitician. 'My father and my brother went to Berlin, and saw the Crown\r\nPrince, afterwards the Emperor Frederick, and Prince Bismarck, who many\r\nyears later described to me the impression which they--the Whig and the\r\nRepublican--had made on him.' From Germany they passed into Russia, where\r\nWentworth Dilke was commissioned to represent England at the Horticultural\r\nCongress. In May a sudden telegram called Charles Dilke to St. Petersburg.\r\nHis father had been attacked with 'that deadly form of Russian influenza,\r\na local degeneration of the tissues, which kills a man in three days,\r\nwithout his being able to tell you that he feels anything except\r\nweakness.' Before Charles Dilke could reach the Russian capital, his\r\nfather had been already 'embalmed and temporarily buried,' with a view to\r\ninterment in England.\r\n\r\nHis successor entered upon his position while still several months short\r\nof the age of twenty-six. He took steps to give up at once Alice Holt--'a\r\nmere shooting place'--and also sold Hawkley in Hampshire, keeping only the\r\nLondon house, 76, Sloane Street, in which he had been born, and which was\r\nto be his home till he died there. It was home also for his brother\r\nAshton, now reading classics and rowing in the Trinity Hall boat. The\r\nhouse continued to be managed for the two young men by their grandmother,\r\nMrs. Chatfield, known to Sir Charles and to all his intimates as the\r\n\"Dragon,\" 'on account of the sportive old soul calling herself the Dragon\r\nof Wantley whenever she attacked me in arms.' With her lived her niece,\r\nMiss Folkard, a quiet little old lady. When Charles Dilke married, Mrs.\r\nChatfield and Miss Folkard made way for the bride, and Ashton Dilke's home\r\nwas then with his grandmother. When death cut short that marriage, the old\r\nladies returned, and lived out the end of their lives in Sloane Street.\r\nMrs. Chatfield was a very popular personage; and many letters from Sir\r\nCharles's friends have affectionate or jesting messages to 'Dragon.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill returned to England from Avignon in the spring of 1869,\r\nand followed up his earlier letter of friendly criticism on _Greater\r\nBritain_ by a suggestion of meeting. On Easter Sunday the meeting took\r\nplace, and the acquaintance 'rapidly ripened into a close friendship.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was elected in May to the Political Economy Club, of which\r\nMill was a leading member, 'defeating George Shaw Lefevre, Sir Louis\r\nMallet, Lord Houghton, and John Morley, although, or perhaps because, I\r\nwas somewhat heterodox. Still,' a marginal note adds, 'Mallet and Houghton\r\nwere pretty heterodox too.'\r\n\r\nThe heterodoxy challenged that economic orthodoxy of which the Political\r\nEconomy Club was the special guardian. Forty years later Sir Charles\r\nwrote, against the date May, 1869:\r\n\r\n    'This was the moment of the domination of the Ricardo\r\n    religion.[Footnote: It will be remembered that the fundamental\r\n    principle of the \"Ricardian theory\"--distinguishing it from that o±\r\n    Adam Smith--is the determination of wages by the law of population.\r\n    According to Ricardo, it is the influence of high or low wages on the\r\n    numbers of the population which adjusts the \"market rate\" to the\r\n    \"natural rate.\"] It is admirably pointed out in Professor Ashley's\r\n    address, as President of the Economic Section of the British\r\n    Association, 1907, that this doctrine had become a complete creed,\r\n    with a stronger hold over the educated classes of England (and I\r\n    should add France) by 1821 than any creed has had. The Political\r\n    Economy Club is shown by Ashley to have been the assembly of the\r\n    elders of the Church, of which the founder assumed that they possessed\r\n    a complete code, representing just principles necessary to \"diffuse.\"\r\n    The Club was to watch for the propagation of any doctrine hostile to\r\n    sound views. The sect grew rapidly from the small body of Utilitarian\r\n    founders, and conquered all the statesmen who rejected the other\r\n    opinions of James Mill. As I tried to show, with the support of a\r\n    majority of the Club, in April, 1907, the heresy of which I was\r\n    elected in 1869 as a representative has now (1908) triumphed. The\r\n    facts announced as \"certain\" by Ricardo have crumbled, and the\r\n    doctrine crumbles with them. Professor Ashley declared from the\r\n    Ricardo chair in 1907 that \"the Ricardian orthodoxy is, by general\r\n    consent, ... dead to-day among the English-speaking economists.\"\r\n\r\n    'The son of the Club's founder, John Stuart Mill, lived to lead the\r\n    way out of the doctrine of his father, James Mill, Malthus, and\r\n    Ricardo, against the opposition of his own disciple Fawcett, into the\r\n    new land which he just lived to see.\r\n\r\n    'In the debates, which I regularly attended, Mill, who had become\r\n    semi-socialist in his views, was usually at odds with his own disciple\r\n    Fawcett, who had remained individualist. The rows which they had at\r\n    this Club were carried to the Radical Club after its formation later,\r\n    and I gradually deserted Fawcett, and, more and more influenced by\r\n    Mill's later views, finally came to march even in front of Mill in our\r\n    advance.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was from the first actually _in_ political life, to which Mill\r\nhad come after more than half a lifetime spent in study; and experience\r\ntransformed the philosopher.\r\n\r\n    \"The whole tone of his writings before he entered Parliament,\" said\r\n    Sir Charles a quarter of a century afterwards, \"had been marked by a\r\n    vein of practical Conservatism, which entirely disappeared when he\r\n    found himself in touch with the destructive realities of British\r\n    politics.\" [Footnote: \"John Stuart Mill, 1869-1873,\" _Cosmopolis_,\r\n    March, 1897.]\r\n\r\nDilke, rightly zealous for the repute of a teacher under whose influence\r\nhis own political faith developed, was always at pains to confute the\r\npopular opinion as to Mill's hardness. Addressing the Economic Society in\r\n1909, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"John Mill's nature was far more spiritual than that of his father.\r\n    His self-training was far more permeated by what may be loosely called\r\n    Comtist-Christianity than by the utilitarian philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited as an example the conclusion expressed by Mill so far back as\r\n1848 that \"cheapness of goods was not desirable when the cause was that\r\nlabour is ill-remunerated.\" Here was one of the points where Fawcett\r\n'fiercely differed' from Mill, denying the possibility of any 'exception\r\nto the wage principle laid down by Malthus and Ricardo.' Sir Charles was\r\ndestined not merely to affirm the principle which Mill conceded, but to\r\nshow by infinitely patient investigation of the facts, first the need for\r\napplying the principle, and later--far more difficult--the means by which\r\nit could be brought into operation.\r\n\r\nThe change foreshadowed by this division among leaders of democratic\r\nthought was no ordinary one; the whole direction of forces and tendencies\r\nwas altered; and from 1870 onwards Sir Charles was at the centre of the\r\nmovement which has established the 'semi-socialism' of Mill's last years\r\nas the normal political opinion accepted by both parties to-day. He, more\r\nthan any other man, translated it from abstract theory into terms of\r\npolitical reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSince his undergraduate years Charles Dilke had entertained the project of\r\nwriting on Russia, and perhaps the journey to his father's death-bed\r\nrevived the plan.\r\n\r\nWhile on the way to St. Petersburg in May, 1869, he chanced to share a\r\nrailway carriage with a distinguished member of the Russian Diplomatic\r\nService, Baron Jomini, son of the famous writer on strategy, and 'almost,'\r\nsays Sir Charles, 'the cleverest man I ever met with, and to me always an\r\nexcellent friend.' Jomini was useful even on that journey, when\r\ndifficulties arose over an irregular passport; and in later years he\r\nrendered Sir Charles various services with officialdom--as, for example,\r\nwhen the Russian Customs officers, not unnaturally, objected to the\r\nEnglish traveller's bringing in for his personal use 'books prohibited in\r\nRussia, the most extraordinary collection that was probably ever got\r\ntogether in that country unless in the office of the censorship of\r\npolice.'\r\n\r\nFrom the first Baron Jomini was at hand to introduce Sir Charles to\r\nsociety in Russia, but in other directions the traveller was not less well\r\nequipped. He learnt Russian; and before setting out on his second visit to\r\nSt. Petersburg in the autumn of 1869 he had made a special journey to\r\nGeneva, with an introduction from Louis Blanc to Herzen, leader of the\r\nmoderate Russian revolutionists. He knew Mazzini well, and through him had\r\nvisited Baden to make a lasting acquaintance with Tourgenief. Tourgenief\r\nwas then 'living with the Viardots, the sister and brother-in-law of\r\nMalibran.' Long years after Dilke spoke of him as one of the finest of\r\ntalkers.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg he met many of the advanced revolutionaries to whom\r\nHerzen had commended him, and he was also received by more orthodox\r\nLiberalism. The Political Economy Club gave a dinner in his honour, at\r\nwhich he made a speech in French on the Irish Land Question; and the\r\nGeographical Society held a reception in recognition of the author of\r\n_Greater Britain_, with Baron von der Osten Sacken in the chair, son of a\r\ncomrade and colleague of the elder Jomini in days of Napoleonic war.\r\n[Footnote: Nicolas Dmitrivitch von der Osten Sacken, Chamberlain of the\r\nImperial Court, afterwards Russian Ambassador at Berlin; born 1834, died\r\n1912.] Osten Sacken's father was the Governor of Paris in 1815 after the\r\nentry of the Allies.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to Taganrog, at the eastern end of the Sea of Azof, he came\r\nback to St. Petersburg, and occupied by chance the next rooms to the great\r\nsinger Mario--\"an embarrassing neighbour, as he used to come in about 2\r\na.m., and give me far too much of the quality of his voice.\" Here also Sir\r\nCharles made friends with Governor Curtin, the American Minister,\r\n'formerly Lincoln's Governor of Pennsylvania during the war, and the best\r\nstory-teller in the world.' 'I went about a good deal with Baron Jomini\r\nand Baron von der Osten Sacken, and saw much of the Emperor's aunt, the\r\nGrande Duchesse Hélène. My chief friends were at this time Princess\r\nGalitzin, Prince Orlof Davydof, leader of the high Tory party, and the old\r\nPrincess Kotchubey, afterwards Grand Mistress of the Robes.'\r\n\r\nLater in the year he pushed across into Siberia; and in the Christmas\r\nvacation Ashton Dilke came out to join his brother. They met at Kazan,\r\nwhither Charles had returned from his Siberian wanderings, and went down\r\nthe Volga together to Astrakan, and thence travelled across the Don\r\nCossack Steppe. Sir Charles returned in the last days of 1869. He notes\r\nthat Ashton showed at this time the beginnings of consumption--symptoms\r\nwhich led him to give up rowing, and became more grave in the years of his\r\ntravels in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nRussia exercised from the first for Charles Dilke a fascination which it\r\nnever lost. A picture by Vladimir Makofsky, which he bought about this\r\ntime, hung in the breakfast-room at Sloane Street; 'it represents a scene\r\nfrom one of Tourgenief's early stories, a summer's night in the government\r\nof Toula: boys telling ghost stories while they watch horses grazing on\r\nthe lammas land.'\r\n\r\nA chapter in _Greater Britain_ had set out the opinion which, after travel\r\nin the East, he formed of Russia, from talk both with Englishmen and with\r\nOrientals. The great power, which he then guessed at from the other side\r\nof the Himalayan barrier, seemed to him essentially Asiatic, not European,\r\nand not a civilizing power. He quoted with approval the saying of an\r\nEgyptian under Ismail's rule: \"Why, Russia is an organized barbarism,--\r\nwhy--the Russians are--why, they are--why, nearly as bad as _we_ are.\"\r\n\r\nThis was his view of the Russian Government. The opinion which he formed\r\nof the Russian people as a whole was in itself 'contradictory because they\r\nare a contradictory people.' He found them 'avid of new ideas.' Yet,\r\n'however fond half-educated Russians may be of professing a knowledge of\r\nthings they do not understand, I never doubted for one moment the\r\ngreatness of the future that lies before Russia, nor the essential\r\npatriotism and strength of the Russian race; and it was these last\r\nconsiderations that took me so often to their country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATION BILL OF 1870--THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFrom his Russian journeys Sir Charles returned to take part in an election\r\nin which occurred his first opportunity for helping the cause of direct\r\nLabour Representation. In 1869--\r\n\r\n    'at the extreme end of the year, I returned to London, and worked hard\r\n    for Odger in the Southwark Election, in which, opposed by a\r\n    Conservative and a Liberal (Sir Sydney Waterlow), he beat the Liberal,\r\n    with the result, however, that the Conservative got in. Lord Edmond\r\n    Fitzmaurice subscribed towards Odger's expenses, and Fawcett also\r\n    worked for him. The incident contributed a good deal towards that\r\n    separate organization of the Radicals which was attempted early in the\r\n    following year.'\r\n\r\nAlready another organization of far-reaching influence had been planned,\r\nand it led to a great alliance.\r\n\r\n    'In the course of 1869 I became Chairman of the London Branch of the\r\n    newly formed Education League, and my friendship with Joseph\r\n    Chamberlain began, he being Chairman of the Committee of the League\r\n    and its real head.'\r\n\r\nDilke was seven years the junior of Chamberlain, who in 1869 was thirty-\r\nthree. But he had seven years' Parliamentary seniority over his friend,\r\nwho did not become a member of the House of Commons till 1876. Chamberlain\r\nwas in 1869, and indeed for several years later, a politician and member\r\nof the Birmingham Town Council, known throughout the Midland area for the\r\nboldness of his Radicalism--which did not stop short of avowing Republican\r\nprinciples--and also for extraordinary ability in developing the municipal\r\nimprovements in which Birmingham under his auspices led the way. He had\r\nconceived, and in the Education League partly carried out, the idea of a\r\npolitical association independent of official party control, which should\r\ncover the whole country with its branches, and so become a power behind\r\nand beyond the Parliamentary leadership. Sir Charles, on his side, brought\r\ninto the partnership the resources possessed by a young man of\r\nconsiderable reputation both in literature and in public life, who at an\r\nearly age had established himself in a metropolitan seat.\r\n\r\n'The principle of the League was that of general education, and of\r\ncompulsion and freedom from fees as a consequence. The teaching of\r\nreligion was left to the Sunday-schools, and upon this head difficulties\r\nsoon arose.' The mass of English Liberals inherited the Protestant\r\nconviction that \"simple Bible teaching\" could offend nobody, and must be\r\ngood for everybody, and consequently should be included in the term\r\n\"education,\" while the view of more sophisticated politicians was given by\r\nSir William Harcourt (then Mr. Vernon Harcourt). He wrote to Sir Charles\r\nin 1870:\r\n\r\n    \"We are fighting with inferior forces, and everything must depend upon\r\n    husbanding our strength, using it to the best advantage, and not\r\n    exposing ourselves to needless defeats. We must always seem to win,\r\n    even though we do not get what we want. That is what up to this point\r\n    we have accomplished. But we must not allow ourselves to be\r\n    precipitated upon destruction by men who may be philosophers, but who\r\n    are no politicians.... We must now retire on the second line of\r\n    defence. What is that to be? I lay down first that the thing to be\r\n    resisted is denominationalism. If it can be got rid of altogether--\r\n    best; but if not, then to the greatest degree--next best. Now, as a\r\n    politician (not as a philosopher) I am quite satisfied that neither in\r\n    the House of Commons nor in the country can we beat denominationalism\r\n    by secularism. If we attempt to meet the flood by this dyke it will\r\n    come over our heads. We must break the force of the wave by a slope,\r\n    and deal with its diminished weight afterwards as best we may.\"\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt then went on to defend that to which I was strongly opposed\r\n    --namely, Bible reading--on the ground that \"we should give our\r\n    republic not the best possible laws, but the best which they will\r\n    bear. This is the essence of politics. All the rest is speculation....\r\n    We must make up our minds before the meeting on Monday, for in the\r\n    multitude of counsellors there is folly.\"'\r\n\r\nA definite principle was at stake. Under this proposal the teaching,\r\nthough called undenominational, would not in fact be so. Bible reading,\r\nsubject, no doubt, to a conscience clause, would be enforced on Roman\r\nCatholics, Jews, and secularists, and Bible reading, though\r\nundenominational as regarded the different divisions of Protestant\r\nChristianity, would still be denominational as regards these three: 'I\r\nmyself took the extreme and logical line of not only opposing Bible\r\nreading, but of opposing Mr. Jacob Bright's and Mr. Cowper Temple's\r\namendments for excluding creeds, and for setting up a general\r\nundenominational Protestantism of the majority.'\r\n\r\nHe was in agreement with John Stuart Mill in resisting a proposal which in\r\nhis opinion did injustice to large classes of the community for the sake\r\nof introducing what (in his own words) \"could be only religion of the\r\ndriest and baldest kind, and such as would be hardly worthy of the name.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1870 Sir Charles was not openly in revolt, though\r\nafter working for Odger against the Government candidate, he had gone on\r\nto condemn in a speech the Whig influences and fear of the House of Lords,\r\nwhich in his opinion were destroying Mr. Gladstone's Irish Land Bill. Mr.\r\nGladstone showed a desire to conciliate this overactive critic by inviting\r\nhim to second the Address to the Crown.\r\n\r\nAccordingly at the opening of Parliament on February 8th, 1870, Sir\r\nCharles had his part to play in the modest ceremonial which still\r\nsurvives, rather shamefacedly, in the House of Commons, when a couple of\r\ncommoners, uniformed or in Court dress, are put forward as the spokesmen\r\nof that sombre assembly.\r\n\r\nHis speech, advocating the European concert, dwelt on the cloudless calm\r\nwhich lay--in February, 1870--over the civilized world, and for another\r\nsix months wrapped it in delusive peace.\r\n\r\nFor the moment domestic affairs held the field. In spite of Bright's\r\nobservation about driving six omnibuses abreast through Temple Bar,\r\nForster's Education Bill was pressed forward along with the Irish Land\r\nproposals, and the Government were at once in trouble with their advanced\r\nwing, in which Sir Charles Dilke was a leader of revolt. He acted as\r\nteller along with Henry Richard when Richard took sixty dissentient\r\nLiberals into the Lobby in support of a general motion demanding that\r\nschool attendance should be compulsory, and that all religious teaching\r\nshould be separately paid for out of voluntary funds. When compromise was\r\naccepted: [Footnote: The Cowper Temple clause practically left religious\r\nteaching to local option. Each school was to give or not give such\r\nreligious teaching as it thought well, so long as no _Board_ School was\r\nused to attach a child to a particular denomination.]\r\n\r\n    'I was, I believe, the only Liberal member who resisted the Cowper\r\n    Temple amendment as accepted by the Government, and I resigned my post\r\n    as Chairman of the London Branch of the Education League. I published\r\n    a letter explaining the reasons for my resignation; the Committee\r\n    wrote in reply that they fully agreed with me in matters of principle,\r\n    and asked me to reconsider my resignation.'\r\n\r\nThis, however, he refused to do, since the London Branch and the League\r\ngenerally were abandoning the principle in the support they gave to\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Committee stage his name appears in all the numerous\r\ndivision lists, voting against Government as often as with it. Thus it was\r\nfrom a position of complete independence that he carried two amendments of\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\n    'The Bill as brought in made the School Boards mere committees of\r\n    Boards of Vestries, and the amendment that School Boards should be\r\n    elected by the ratepayers, which was forced on and ultimately accepted\r\n    by the Government, was mine. I also was the author of the proposal\r\n    that the School Board elections should be by ballot, which was\r\n    carried.' [Footnote: He always regretted the substitution later of the\r\n    Educational Committees of County Councils for the School Boards.]\r\n\r\nThe ballot was then the question of the hour, and it was a matter upon\r\nwhich his study of foreign and Colonial institutions had made him an\r\nauthority. In 1869 he had given evidence before the Select Committee on\r\nParliamentary and Municipal Elections, 'explaining the working of the\r\nballot in France, in the United States, and, above all, in Tasmania and\r\nAustralia.' The evidence which he gave was of service in the preparation\r\nof the Ballot Bill of 1870, which closely followed the example set by\r\nTasmania and South Australia.\r\n\r\nSir John Gorst, who was already a well-known figure in English politics,\r\nthough not yet in Parliament, remembered attending a debate specially to\r\nhear what this newcomer had to say upon the question of the hour.\r\n\r\nThis first practical application of the ballot, 'forced on and ultimately\r\naccepted by the Government,' did not pass unchallenged. When Sir Charles's\r\namendment was at last put to the vote, he was privileged to tell with\r\nGeorge Glyn, the Chief Whip, in a division which took place 'after the\r\nfiercest conflict ever up to that known within the walls of Parliament, we\r\nhaving sat up all night.' There was a long series of dilatory motions, a\r\nfresh one being moved after a division had disposed of its predecessor\r\n'This was the first birth of obstruction, and the lesson taught by Mr. G.\r\nC. Bentinck on this occasion was afterwards applied by \"the colonels\" in\r\nthe proceedings on the Army Purchase Scheme in 1871, and then by Butt's\r\nIrish after 1874.'\r\n\r\nIn all the discussions on the Ballot Bill for Parliamentary elections Sir\r\nCharles steadily opposed the introduction of a scrutiny which involved the\r\nnumbering of the ballot papers. This appeared to him 'a pernicious\r\ninterference with the principle of secrecy, chiefly important because it\r\nwould be impossible to convince ignorant voters that their votes would not\r\nbe traced.' His view 'prevailed,' he says, 'in the House of Commons, but\r\nthe provisions of which we secured the omission from the second Ballot\r\nBill were once more inserted by the House of Lords' at its passage in\r\n1871.\r\n\r\nThere was another matter connected with the franchise in which Sir Charles\r\nhad effected by an amendment an even more remarkable change, and that in\r\nhis first session. The proposal to give women ratepayers the franchise in\r\nmunicipal elections, or rather 'to restore to them a right which was taken\r\naway by the Municipal Reform Act of 1835,' was his. Two amendments were on\r\nthe paper, and though by a chance Mr. Jacob Bright's was taken first, the\r\nsuggestion, as Mr. Bright admitted, really came from Sir Charles, and it\r\nwas carried in the session of 1869. This proposal, as he explained to a\r\nmeeting of the London Society for Woman's Suffrage over which Mrs. Grote\r\npresided, was in his opinion 'merely experimental, and only a first step\r\nto adult suffrage.' In 1870 he seconded Jacob Bright's Woman's Suffrage\r\nBill, which was carried through the second reading--'the only occasion\r\nwhen a majority of the House of Commons declared for the principle till\r\n1897.' Divergencies of opinion had in the meantime arisen. The Bill of\r\n1870 did not debar married women from obtaining the vote. When in later\r\nyears a proviso excluding them was introduced, Dilke, with Jacob Bright,\r\nwithdrew from the parent society. He held throughout his life that to\r\nattempt compromise on this matter was to court failure, and that women\r\nwould never get the vote except as part of a scheme for universal\r\nsuffrage. This was no mere academic opinion; and he gave later on proof of\r\nhis earnestness for the principle involved in convincing fashion.\r\n\r\nTo the argument still urged against that principle--the argument that most\r\nwomen are against it--he gave his answer in 1870:\r\n\r\n    \"You will always find that in the case of any class which has been\r\n    despotically governed--and though I do not wish to use strong\r\n    language, it cannot be denied that women have been despotically\r\n    governed in England, although the despotism has been of a benevolent\r\n    character--the great majority of that class are content with the\r\n    system under which they live.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that to admit women to the franchise did not compel those\r\nto vote who did not desire to do so.\r\n\r\nIn this matter Jacob Bright was his leading associate in Parliament; but\r\noutside Parliament he was working with Mill.\r\n\r\nTo the two questions already dealt with--Education and Woman's Suffrage--\r\nwas now added a third, which Sir Charles describes as 'chief of all the\r\nquestions I had to do with in 1870--the land question.' There is this\r\nendorsement on one of Mill's letters written in 1870:\r\n\r\n    \"I acted as his secretary for above a year on (_a_) his land movement\r\n    = taxation of land values; (_b_) the women's suffrage proposal, which\r\n    followed the carrying of his municipal franchise for women by me in\r\n    1869 and the School Boards, 1870.\"\r\n\r\nThe Radical Club was founded, with Sir Charles as Secretary, in 1870, and\r\nMill was among the original members of the Club. [Footnote: The others\r\nwere Professor Cairnes, Mr. John Morley, Mr. Frank Hill (editor of the\r\n_Daily News_), Leslie Stephen, Mr. Leonard Courtney, Mr. Henry Sidgwick,\r\nMr. W. C. Sidgwick, Mr. McCullagh Torrens, and Mr. Fawcett. Sir David\r\nWedderburn, Mr. Peter Taylor, and Mr. Walter Morrison were added at the\r\nfirst meeting, as also was Mr. Hare. At the first meeting it was decided\r\nthat women should be eligible. Half the Club was to consist of members of\r\nParliament, half of non-members.] From this platform Mill propounded, in\r\n1870, his views on land--views which forty years later became the adopted\r\nprinciples of the Liberal party; and at the inaugural public meeting of\r\nthe Land Tenure Association in 1870 Sir Charles for the first time\r\npromulgated the doctrine of taxing the \"unearned increment.\" He insisted\r\nthat England's system of land tenure was \"unique in the world,\" and\r\nanswerable for tragic consequences.\r\n\r\n    \"One who has seen our race abroad under fair conditions knows how\r\n    frank and handsome the Englishman is elsewhere, and might be here. But\r\n    when he looks around him in Sheffield or in East London, he sees none\r\n    but miserable and stunted forms. The life of the English labourer is a\r\n    steady march down a hill with a poorhouse at the bottom. At the same\r\n    time the observer finds, when he asks for the remedy, that in these\r\n    matters there is not a pin to choose between the two parties in the\r\n    State.\" [Footnote: A note sent to Lord Courtney in 1909 will show\r\n    exactly what Sir Charles's position had been on this fundamental\r\n    matter from the very outset of his political career:\r\n\r\n        \"Mill's object was--\r\n\r\n        \"To claim for the benefit of the State the interception by\r\n        taxation of a great part of the unearned increase of the value of\r\n        land which is continually accruing, without effort or outlay by\r\n        the proprietors, through the growth of population and wealth.\r\n\r\n        \"To purchase land for the State, and let for co-operative\r\n        agriculture under conditions of efficiency and to smallholders on\r\n        durable cultivating interests.\"\r\n\r\n    He adds a reference to his own Bill \"for utilizing public and quasi-\r\n    public lands under public management, with repeal of the Statute of\r\n    Mortmain and forbidding of alienation.\"\r\n\r\n    This Bill was introduced by him in the early seventies, but obtained\r\n    no support till 1875 (see Chapter XIII., p. 192).]\r\n\r\nWithin the previous twenty-five years over six hundred thousand acres of\r\ncommon land had been enclosed, under Orders sanctioned by Parliament. Of\r\nthis vast amount only four thousand had been set apart for public\r\npurposes. In 1866 the commons near London were threatened, and a Society\r\nfor their preservation was formed, in which Mr. Shaw Lefevre was the\r\nmoving spirit. [Footnote: Now Lord Eversley.] Sir Charles became in 1870\r\nChairman of the Society. Among the latest of his papers is a note from\r\nLord Eversley accompanying an early copy of the new edition of his\r\n_Commons and Forests_ \"which I hope will remind you of old times and of\r\nyour own great services to the cause.\" 'We saved Wisley Common and Epping\r\nForest,' says the Memoir. It was more important that on April 9th, 1869,\r\nthe annual Enclosure Bill was referred to a Select Committee,\r\nnotwithstanding the determined opposition of the Government. The date is\r\nmemorable in the history of the question, for the Committee recommended\r\nthat all further enclosures should be suspended until the general Act had\r\nbeen amended, as it was in 1876.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Sir Charles became publicly committed to another\r\ncause, barren of political advantage, into which he put, first and last,\r\nas much labour as might have filled the whole of a creditable career. He\r\nbegan to take an active part in connection with the Aborigines Protection\r\nSociety and presided at its Annual Meeting in 1870. This, says the Memoir\r\nlaconically, 'threw on me lifelong duties.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Franco-German War broke upon Europe in July, 1870. Later, it became\r\none of the chief interests of Sir Charles's mind to track out the workings\r\nof those few men who prepared what seemed a sudden outburst; here it is\r\nimportant only to outline his attitude towards the combatants. In that\r\nperiod of European history every politician was of necessity attracted or\r\nrepelled by the personality of the Emperor of the French. In Sir Charles's\r\ncase there was no wavering between like and dislike: he carried on his\r\ngrandfather's detestation of the lesser Napoleon. The chapter in _Greater\r\nBritain_ which is devoted to Egypt shows this feeling; and when news of\r\nSadowa reached him during his American journey in the autumn of 1866, he\r\nwrote home to say that he rejoiced in Prussia's triumph, and hoped \"Louis\r\nNapoleon would quarrel with the Germans over it, and get well thrashed,\r\nwith the result that German unity might be brought about.\"\r\n\r\n    'This' (he notes in the Memoir) 'is somewhat curious at a time when\r\n    everybody believed (except myself and Moltke and Bismarck, not\r\n    including, I think, the King of Prussia) that the French Army was\r\n    superior to the armies of all Germany.'\r\n\r\nIn coming down the Mexican coast he touched at Acapulco, which was under\r\nMexican fire, as the French still held the bay and city; and he had then,\r\nlater in 1866, 'begun to hope for the fall of Louis Napoleon, who was\r\npiling up debt for France at the average rate of ten millions sterling\r\nevery year, and whose prestige was vanishing fast in the glare of the\r\npublicity given to the actions of Bazaine.'\r\n\r\nBefore Sir Charles returned to Europe in 1867, Maximilian, the Austrian\r\nArchduke sent by Napoleon III to be 'Emperor of Mexico,' had fallen, an\r\nunlucky victim of French intrigue. But Paris was still the centre of\r\nEurope; and the traveller on his way home from Egypt--where he had seen\r\nFrench enterprise opening the Suez Canal, French language and influence\r\ndominant--saw Louis Napoleon preside at a pageant, already darkened by the\r\nrising storm-cloud:\r\n\r\n    'Reaching Paris' (in June, 1867), 'I attended the review held (during\r\n    the Exhibition of 1867) by the Emperors of Russia and of the French,\r\n    and the King of Prussia, at which I saw Gortschakof, Schouvalof,\r\n    Bismarck, and Moltke, on the day on which the Pole Berezowski shot at\r\n    Alexander II. Sixty thousand men marched past the three Sovereigns at\r\n    the very spot at which, three years later, one of them was, to review\r\n    a larger German force. The crash was near; Maximilian had been shot.\r\n    It is, however, not pleasant to contrast the horror with which the\r\n    news of the execution of the puppet Emperor was received in Europe,\r\n    with the indifference with which all but a handful of Radicals had\r\n    regarded the Paris executions of December, 1851.'\r\n\r\n    'In October, 1867, three months later, I again visited Paris, with my\r\n    father, and made the acquaintance of the Queen of Holland, the Queen\r\n    of Sheba to Louis Napoleon's Solomon in his glory. The Emperor of\r\n    Austria, the King of Bavaria, and Beust were also in Paris on business\r\n    which boded no good to Bismarck, and the populace were amusing\r\n    themselves in crying \"Vive Garibaldi!\" to the Austrian Emperor, as\r\n    three or four months earlier they had cried \"Vive la Pologne!\" to the\r\n    Tsar. At a banquet to the Foreign Commission to the Exhibition, at\r\n    which I dined, I heard Rouher make his famous speech, \"L'Italie n'aura\r\n    jamais Rome,\" which he afterwards in December repeated in the Corps\r\n    Législatif--\"L'Italie ne s'emparera pas de Rome--jamais\" (shouts of\r\n    \"Jamais!\" from the Right): \"Jamais la France ne supportera cette\r\n    violence faite à son honneur et à la catholicité.\" When I heard the\r\n    word \"jamais,\" I believed I should live to see Italy at Rome, but\r\n    hardly so soon.'\r\n\r\nHis governing dislike of France's rulers had reflected itself in that part\r\nof his first address to the electors of Chelsea which laid down his views\r\non foreign affairs. \"Our true alliance,\" he had told them, \"is not with\r\nthe Latin peoples, but with men who speak our tongue, with our brothers in\r\nAmerica, and with our kinsmen in Germany and Scandinavia.\" This\r\nprepossession, notable in one who came afterwards to be regarded as the\r\nclosest friend of France among English politicians, shaped his action when\r\nthe crash came. It tempted him to the German side, but contact with\r\nPrussian militarism showed where his real sympathies lay.\r\n\r\nWar was declared on Tuesday, July 19th. On the following Saturday morning\r\nSir Charles left London for Paris: left Paris for Strasbourg the same\r\nevening: visited Metz on the Monday, and saw the Imperial Guard at Nancy.\r\nWithin four days from the time of leaving he was back in London, and busy\r\nwith preparations. He had decided to attach himself to the ambulances of\r\nthe Crown Prince of Prussia's army, and in this expedition two other\r\nmembers of Parliament joined him:\r\n\r\n    'Auberon Herbert (physically brave, and politically the bravest,\r\n    though not politically the strongest, man of our times) and\r\n    Winterbotham, afterwards Under-Secretary of State for the Home\r\n    Department, and a man of eloquence, whose early death is still\r\n    deplored by those who knew him. We took letters from Count von\r\n    Bernstorff, the Prussian Ambassador, and following up the German\r\n    armies through the Bavarian Palatinate, a journey during which we were\r\n    arrested and marched to Kaiserslautern to the King's headquarters by\r\n    Bavarian gendarmes, as French spies, we were enrolled under the\r\n    Prussian Knights of St. John at Sulz by Count Goertz, and received\r\n    billets from that time, although we used to pay for all we had at\r\n    every place. At Wissembourg and at Sulz we were sent to the inn, and\r\n    at Lunéville I was planted on an ironmonger, but we were divided. At\r\n    Nancy only, being fixed on a legitimist Baron, I was not allowed to\r\n    pay for what I had, but I was put with him by his wish, by his friend\r\n    the Mayor, as he would not have real Prussians. He made things so\r\n    unpleasant for my companion, Count Böthmer--though, unlike his\r\n    brother, the Count was a non-combatant--that this Knight of St. John\r\n    had to go elsewhere. Auberon and Winterbotham were also put elsewhere\r\n    at Nancy. At Sarrebourg and Pont-à-Mousson I forget with whom we were,\r\n    but we were together and were nearly starved.\r\n\r\n    'We marched with the Poseners, or Fifth Army Corps, through\r\n    Froeschwilier and Reichshoffen; went off the road to Saverne to\r\n    witness the bombardment of Phalsbourg; joined again at Sarrebourg;\r\n    marched by Lunéville, and from Nancy were sent to Pont-à-Mousson\r\n    during the battles before Metz.\r\n\r\n    'The first thing that struck us much during this portion of the war\r\n    was that the grandest of the early victories in this so-called war of\r\n    races, the Battle of Worth, was won and lost in the centre of the\r\n    position by pure Poles and native Algerians. Poseners were arrayed\r\n    against Turcos, and both fought well, while hardly a German or a\r\n    Frenchman was in sight. On the field of Wörth I noted that the\r\n    Poseners had all many cartridges as well as their Polish hymn-books\r\n    with them, but the Turcos were as short of cartridges as of hymn-\r\n    books. Wanting a French cartridge, I was unable to find one in the\r\n    pouches of the dead, while of German cartridges I had at once as many\r\n    dozens as I pleased. I fancy, however, that it would not be safe to\r\n    conclude, from the fact that the French had fired away their\r\n    ammunition, that they fired carelessly because too fast; for the\r\n    Germans, vastly outnumbering the French (who ought not to have fought\r\n    a battle, but rather should have fallen back), had probably opposed at\r\n    different portions of the day different corps to the same French\r\n    regiments, who had not been relieved. After this battle all was lost\r\n    to the French cause. The scattered French spread terror where they\r\n    went, and while the railway might have been wholly destroyed by the\r\n    simple plan of blowing up some tunnels, only bridges were blown up,\r\n    which in the course of a few days were, of course, replaced even where\r\n    they were not in a few hours easily repaired....\r\n\r\n    'I was glad to have seen the beginning of the invasion. At no other\r\n    time could I have gained a real knowledge of that which every\r\n    politician ought to know--the working of the transport system of a\r\n    modern army. We were the smaller of the two invading forces, yet we\r\n    needed a stream of carts the whole way to Nancy from Bingen upon the\r\n    Rhine, perpetually moving day and, night. The French compared the\r\n    swarming in of Germany to the invasions of the Huns....\r\n\r\n    'My letters to my grandmother (by the military field post) were not\r\n    numerous. My first (written from Wissembourg) states that we are much\r\n    elated at the victory of Wissembourg; while the second is as follows:\r\n\r\n    '\"I write on paper left by the French in the Palace of Justice. They\r\n    seem to have fled in haste, for... the judges' pen-and-ink portraits\r\n    of one another still adorn the blotting-paper. This place\r\n    (Wissembourg) is in much confusion.... When, by straining, and a good\r\n    deal of pressure upon the members of the old French municipal council,\r\n    a regiment is housed, in comes another with a demand for food and\r\n    lodging for six hundred horses and four hundred men; then a Prussian\r\n    infantry regiment two thousand strong, and so on all night.... We are\r\n    leaving as members of the Prussian Order of St. John for the Bavarian\r\n    camp. The whole series of French telegrams up to July 30th are still\r\n    posted here on the Sous-Préfecture, inside which is confined Baron de\r\n    Rosen, Colonel of the 2nd Cuirassiers of the French Guard.\" I go on to\r\n    say that the \"town commandant is an English volunteer and lives in\r\n    London when at home.... He is a most accomplished man.\" He was\r\n    accomplished enough, but he was a lunatic; and there is no more\r\n    singular episode in the war than the fact that an unauthorized lunatic\r\n    should have appointed himself to the command of an important depot,\r\n    and been recognized for at least a week as commandant by all the\r\n    authorities. The fact was that no regiment was stopping many hours in\r\n    the town, and that each Colonel, finding a particular person\r\n    established there, although he may have thought him a curious\r\n    commandant, never thought of questioning his authority.\r\n\r\n    'One of my letters appeared in the _Daily News_. It was dated August\r\n    15th, and prophesied the complete destruction of the French armies,\r\n    and it contained a somewhat amusing paragraph:\r\n\r\n    '\"In our march last night we came into a part of the country\r\n    unoccupied by either army. We were twice driven from villages by the\r\n    Mayors, who seemed at their wits' end in the mazes of international\r\n    law. One said to us: 'This town is not Prussian. It is French, and\r\n    martial law is proclaimed in this part of France. Accordingly I must\r\n    tell you that you need a French military safe-conduct. If you stop\r\n    here without it I must arrest you, and send you'--he thought for a\r\n    while--'to the Prussian Commandant at Sarrebourg.'\" At Nancy I saw the\r\n    Crown Prince, Dr. Russell of the _Times_, Mr. Hilary Skinner of the\r\n    _Daily News_, and Mr. Landells of the _Illustrated London News_, who\r\n    afterwards died of rheumatism caused by exposure in the war. Lord\r\n    Ronald Gower was there on the same day, but was sent away, as his\r\n    presence with Dr. Russell as a guest was unauthorized.\r\n\r\n    'Among our adventures, in addition to our arrest near Kreuznach and to\r\n    our obtaining passes from the maniac commandant, was the adventure of\r\n    our being lost in the Vosges, and nearly coming to be murdered by some\r\n    French peasants, who in the night tried to force their way into the\r\n    village school in which we had barricaded ourselves. Another adventure\r\n    was our being nearly starved at Pont-à-Mousson, where at last we\r\n    managed to buy a bit of the King of Prussia's lunch at the kitchen of\r\n    the inn on the market-place at which it was being cooked in order to\r\n    be placed in a four-in-hand break. While we were ravenously gorging\r\n    ourselves upon it, a man burst into the room, and suddenly exclaimed:\r\n    \"Winterbotham!\" It was Sir Henry Havelock, who was hiding in the\r\n    place, being absent without leave from the Horse Guards, where he was,\r\n    I think, an Assistant Quartermaster-General. He had made friends with\r\n    the Prussian Military Attaché, to whom Bismarck had lent his maps, and\r\n    we thus saw them and learnt much. It was on the same day that Bismarck\r\n    himself was nearly starved. The first part of the story had appeared\r\n    in print, and I asked him about it when I was staying with him in\r\n    September, 1889. He told me that he had with him at his lodging the\r\n    Grand Duke of Mecklenburg and General Sheridan, the American cavalry\r\n    officer. Bismarck had gone out to forage, and had succeeded in finding\r\n    five eggs, for which he had paid a dollar each. He then said to\r\n    himself: \"If I take home five, I must give two to the Grand Duke and\r\n    two to Sheridan, and I shall have but one.\" \"I ate,\" he said, \"two\r\n    upon the spot and took home three, so that the Grand Duke had one, and\r\n    Sheridan had one, and there was one for me. Sheridan died: he never\r\n    knew--but I told the Grand Duke, and he forgave me.\"'\r\n\r\nNo turn of fortune any longer seemed possible, and in Sir Charles's mind\r\nhatred of the Emperor began to be replaced by sympathy for France.\r\n\r\n    'Writing on the day of Gravelotte to my grandmother, I said: \"I have\r\n    no notion how I shall get back.... Perhaps I shall come from Paris\r\n    when we take it, as I suppose we shall do in a week or two.\" Such was\r\n    the impression made on me by the rapidity of the early successes of\r\n    the Germans. My feelings soon changed. Winterbotham continued to be\r\n    very German, but Herbert and I began to wish to desert when we saw how\r\n    overbearing success had made the Prussians, and how determined they\r\n    were to push their successes to a point at which France would have\r\n    been made impotent in Europe....\r\n\r\n    'During the week which followed Gravelotte I saw much of Gustav\r\n    Freytag, the celebrated Prussian writer and politician, who was the\r\n    guest of the Crown Prince. This \"Liberal,\" who had the bad taste to\r\n    wear the Legion of Honour in conquered France, was odious in his\r\n    patriotic exultation.\r\n\r\n    'Bringing back with me nothing but a couple of soldiers' books from\r\n    the field of Wörth, and the pen of the Procureur-Impérial of\r\n    Wissembourg, which still hangs outside my room, I got myself sent to\r\n    Heidelberg in charge of a train full of wounded French officers of\r\n    Canrobert's Division, wounded at the Battle of Mars la Tour on August\r\n    16th, but not picked up until after Gravelotte on August 18th. It was\r\n    the first train back; and as there was no signal system, and we had to\r\n    keep a lookout ahead, it took me two days to reach the German\r\n    frontier. We halted for the night at Bischweiler, and, passing through\r\n    Hagenau, were received at the frontier of the Palatinate by a young\r\n    man who came and spoke to every French officer, and asked after his\r\n    wounds, introducing himself at each compartment by saluting and\r\n    saying: \"Je suis le duc Othon de Bavière.\" This pleasant boy was\r\n    afterwards to show the hereditary madness of his unhappy race. One of\r\n    my prisoners was a Nancy man, and at this station I managed to find a\r\n    boy who ran to his house, and brought down his old nurse with wine and\r\n    food. It was a touching scene of a simple kind, and we were all the\r\n    gainers by the officer's hospitality.\r\n\r\n    'From Heidelberg and Karlsruhe, where I was examined as a spy, I made\r\n    my way by Switzerland and Paris to London. Almost the moment I reached\r\n    London I saw a telegram in an evening paper announcing Sedan. I\r\n    started that evening for Paris, accompanying Major Byng Hall, who\r\n    carried despatches to Lord Lyons. We were the first to bring the news\r\n    to Calais, where it was not believed, and we were mobbed in the\r\n    railway-station. Old Byng Hall put his hand on his heart, and assured\r\n    the crowd upon his honour that, though he was very sorry, it was true.\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of September 4th, my birthday and that of the French\r\n    Republic, I was standing in Paris with Labouchere, afterwards the\r\n    \"Besieged Resident,\" in front of the Grand Hotel upon the Boulevard in\r\n    an attitude of expectation. We had not long to wait. A battalion of\r\n    fat National Guards from the centre of Paris, shopkeepers all, marched\r\n    firmly past, quietly grunting: \"L'abdication! L'abdication!\" They were\r\n    soon followed by a battalion from the outskirts marching faster, and\r\n    gaining on them to the cry of \"Pas d'abdication! La déchéance! La\r\n    déchéance!\" It was a sunny cloudless day. The bridge leading to the\r\n    Corps Législatif was guarded by a double line of mounted Gardes de\r\n    Paris, but there were few troops to be seen, and were indeed very few\r\n    in Paris. We stood just in front of the cavalry, who were perhaps\r\n    partly composed of mounted Gendarmerie of the Seine, only with their\r\n    undress _képis_ on, instead of the tall bearskins which under the\r\n    Empire that force wore.... Labouchere kept on making speeches to the\r\n    crowd in various characters--sometimes as a Marseillais, sometimes as\r\n    an Alsatian, sometimes as an American, sometimes as an English\r\n    sympathizer; I in terror all the while lest the same listeners should\r\n    catch him playing two different parts, and should take us for Prussian\r\n    spies. We kept watching the faces of the cavalry to see whether they\r\n    were likely to fire or charge, but at last the men began one by one to\r\n    sheathe their swords, and to cry \"Vive la République!\" and the Captain\r\n    in command at last cried \"Vive la République!\" too, and withdrew his\r\n    men, letting the crowd swarm across the bridge. So fell the Second\r\n    Empire, and I wished that my grandfather had lived to see the day of\r\n    the doom of the man he hated.\r\n\r\n    'The crowd marched across the bridge singing the \"Marseillaise\" in a\r\n    chorus such as had never been heard before, perhaps, for the throng\r\n    was enormous. After ten minutes' parley inside the Chamber the leaders\r\n    returned from it, and chalked up on one of the great columns the names\r\n    of the representatives of Paris declared to constitute the Provisional\r\n    Government, and I drew the moral--on a day of revolution always have a\r\n    bit of chalk. The crowd demanded the addition of Rochefort's name, and\r\n    it was added. We then parted, one section going off to look for Paul\r\n    de Cassagnac, [Footnote: M. Paul de Cassagnac was a conspicuous\r\n    Imperialist.] who was the only man that the crowd wanted to kill.\r\n\r\n    'I went with the others, first to the statue of Strasbourg, which was\r\n    decorated with flowers, and to which a sort of worship was paid on\r\n    account of the gallant defence of the city, Labouchere making another\r\n    speech, and then on to the Tuileries. A Turco detained us for some\r\n    time at the gates by dancing in face of the crowd. But at last they\r\n    insisted on the private gardens being thrown open, and then swept in,\r\n    and we passed through the whole of the apartments. Privates of the\r\n    National Guard stationed themselves as sentries in all the rooms, and\r\n    not a thing was touched, an inscription proclaiming \"Death to thieves\"\r\n    being chalked upon every wall. Precautions were necessary, for the\r\n    police, knowing themselves to be unpopular, had disappeared. Indeed\r\n    the first proof to me in the early morning of the certainty of a\r\n    revolution had been that on the boulevards the squads had passed me,\r\n    relieving themselves in the usual way, but no squads going to take\r\n    their places. The crowds were orderly, but the eagles, of course, were\r\n    broken down, and a bit of one from the principal guardroom hangs still\r\n    on the wall of my London study. The next day I wrote to my\r\n    grandmother: \"I would not have missed yesterday for the world. Louis\r\n    Blanc and other exiles have come over, but I fear that the great\r\n    northern line will be cut by Wednesday, and then you will get no more\r\n    news from me.\"\r\n\r\n    'I had dined with Lord Lyons on the previous evening in such a costume\r\n    as had never till then been seen at dinner at the Embassy, and had\r\n    listened with him to the bands playing the \"Marseillaise\" and \"Mourir\r\n    pour la Patrie,\" and on the morning of the 5th I had seen Louis Blanc.\r\n    On the 6th I wrote that I feared that my letters would be stopped. In\r\n    the course of the following days I visited all the forts with Alfred\r\n    Tresca, of the Arts et Métiers, who had been set by Government,\r\n    although a civil engineer, to organize the bastion powder-magazines,\r\n    so I saw the defences well. Alfred Tresca was afterwards arrested\r\n    while I was in Paris under the Commune, in the first week in April,\r\n    1871, for refusing to point out where his powder was.\r\n\r\n    'I did not believe in food being got in fast enough to enable Paris to\r\n    hold out long. Knowing as I do that the German cavalry were within 100\r\n    miles of Melun for a fortnight before they cut the Lyons line, I\r\n    consider that to have allowed the French its use was a great error on\r\n    the part of Germany, an error equal to that of letting Canrobert's\r\n    army join Bazaine by Frouard Junction without hindrance on August\r\n    13th, when we were already in Nancy, only five miles off. Both errors\r\n    turned out well enough, as the luck of the Germans had it; but I do\r\n    not believe that anyone now realizes the narrowness of the escape that\r\n    the Prussians had of being crushed by Gambetta. They undertook too\r\n    much when, with 210,000 men (at first), they set themselves to besiege\r\n    Paris, which had in it 500,000 (though of bad material and no\r\n    discipline), with 300,000 more French upon the Loire. The Germans\r\n    succeeded, but I believe, with the French, that if Bazaine had held\r\n    out a fortnight longer they must have failed....\r\n\r\n    'What was done in thirteen days at Paris was wonderful. It is to Jules\r\n    Favre and to Gambetta that France owed the exhaustion of the Germans\r\n    by a siege in 132 days, instead of a collapse in ten days, and it is\r\n    to them, therefore, that they nearly owed success--success which would\r\n    have crowned Gambetta a king of men, though he had done no more than\r\n    what, as it is, he did. I had an interview with Jules Favre [Footnote:\r\n    Jules Favre was at this time Vice-President of the Provisional\r\n    Government for National Defence with the Portfolio of Foreign\r\n    Affairs.] at the Foreign Office one morning at 6 a.m. I also met\r\n    Blanqui, [Footnote: Blanqui, well known as an agitator and\r\n    revolutionary writer, was elected to Parliament in 1871 for\r\n    Montmartre. He was disqualified from membership by various judicial\r\n    condemnations, but \"the Chamber decided to invalidate his election by\r\n    solemn vote, instead of accepting as his disqualification the recital\r\n    of the sentences passed on him depriving him of political rights\"\r\n    (_France_, by J. E. C. Bodley, vol. ii., p. 101). Theirs had him\r\n    arrested and imprisoned.] afterwards too famous, at breakfast at Louis\r\n    Blanc's restaurant (opposite the old Town Hall), the headquarters of\r\n    the Reds. Naquet, the hunchback, now known for his divorce law, was\r\n    also there.\r\n\r\n    'On one of the last sad days before the commencement of the siege\r\n    (Vinoy's or) Ducrot's army crossed Paris, and the 30,000 men which\r\n    formed it marched down the Rue Lafayette, across the Place de l'Opéra,\r\n    and down the Rue de la Paix towards the south-western heights, where\r\n    they afterwards ran away on September 19th. I never saw a more\r\n    depressing sight. I stood all day and through the evening in the rain,\r\n    comparing these wretched, draggled, weary, dejected men, on the one\r\n    hand, with the French troops I had seen at Nancy six weeks earlier,\r\n    and, on the other, with the Prussian Fifth Army Corps I now knew so\r\n    well. Troops, however, cannot be always judged by the eye alone, for\r\n    the Bavarians, who fought admirably throughout the war, when I saw\r\n    them on the march at the beginning of it looked so bad that I expected\r\n    daily to see the whole 60,000 of their two strong corps eaten up by\r\n    the single French corps which I knew was just in front of them. This\r\n    French corps was commanded by de Failly, who had commanded three years\r\n    earlier a mixed Papal and French force against Garibaldi at Mentone,\r\n    near Monte Rotondo, and reported: \"Les chasse-pôts ont fait\r\n    merveille.\"\r\n\r\n    'The day before I left Paris I saw a sergeant of foot surrounded by a\r\n    crowd of roughs. He was explaining to them that he was an Alsatian. \"I\r\n    come from down there. They have eaten my cow!\" \"Ah,\" cried the witty\r\n    Paris crowd, \"if they had only eaten _Leboeuf!_\" The Marshal was\r\n    looked upon in Paris as the cause of the war in virtue of his\r\n    influence with the Empress.\r\n\r\n    The investment of Paris was completed on September 15th, and on the\r\n    16th 'I parted from Louis Blanc, who was despondent, and to whom I was\r\n    able to give no reassuring words, for I had seen the wonderful\r\n    organization of the Germans. I left by the southern station for\r\n    Geneva. Thousands of packing-cases encumbered the courts, the luggage\r\n    abandoned by the women and children flying from Paris. At Villeneuve\r\n    St. Georges the French marines were drawn up in skirmishing order, and\r\n    the enemy's cavalry were in sight. Our train was the last but one\r\n    which passed, but we could, if stopped, have left Paris two days later\r\n    by the Rouen line, although on the 18th the trains by that last line\r\n    were fired at. I wrote home that I could not help thinking of one of\r\n    the plays of Aristophanes, in which a peasant wings his way to heaven\r\n    on the back of a gigantic dung-beetle in order to remonstrate with God\r\n    upon the evils which He has inflicted upon man by war, and finds that\r\n    God is out, and that His place has been taken by a devil, who is\r\n    pounding all the powers together in a mortar.\r\n\r\n    'I went to Lyons, where the red flag was flying from the Town Hall,\r\n    but where the feeling in favour of continuing the war was just as\r\n    strong as in the districts of the tricolour. I then crossed France to\r\n    Tours, where I saw M. Crémieux, a Jew, the representative of the\r\n    Government outside Paris, Gambetta not having yet descended from his\r\n    balloon....\r\n\r\n    'I visited the camp of the Army of the Loire, of which the\r\n    organization was commencing, saw Lord Lyons and Sheffield, his\r\n    secretary, near Tours, and took despatches for them to Calais by Rouen\r\n    and Amiens. They included the correspondence of Mme. de Pourtalès and\r\n    Mme. de Metternich. The railways were in terrible confusion--National\r\n    Guards moving, people flying before the Prussians, no food. I was\r\n    three days and three nights on this little bit of road, and slept on\r\n    tables in waiting-rooms at Vierzon and elsewhere. Passports were\r\n    strictly demanded at this time on leaving as well as on entering\r\n    France. When I reached Calais I found that the boat (and even that\r\n    boat one with no passengers) would leave about 4 a.m., after the\r\n    arrival of mails by sea. The inspection of my passport could only take\r\n    place, I was told, when the boat was starting. It was midnight, the\r\n    gates of the town were shut and drawbridges up, and the hotel at the\r\n    station had been closed for lack of visitors. Watching my time, I\r\n    dropped on board the steamer from off the quay, when the\r\n    coastguardsman's head was turned, and, finding a deck-cabin unlocked,\r\n    I popped in and bolted the door, going fast asleep, and woke only when\r\n    we were outside the harbour in the grey light of early morning, which\r\n    shows that passport regulations can be evaded. All through the war\r\n    Prussian spies could get into France with ease, without any need of\r\n    false papers, by visiting the Savoy coast of Lake Leman as Swiss\r\n    peasants. I was not called upon to show my papers when I passed from\r\n    the Germans to the French by way of Basle, Ouchy, and Evian.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles here concludes the story of his French adventures of this year\r\nby giving his judgment of that moment upon the--\r\n\r\n    'events which will never be forgotten by those of my time ... the\r\n    downfall of the most magnificent imposture of any age--the Second\r\n    Empire....\r\n\r\n    'As I noted in my diary at the time, \"it is possible that the\r\n    Bonapartists may raise their heads again, though if so, it is more\r\n    likely to be under Plon-Plon than under the Empress, an impossible\r\n    woman, whom even her son would have to exile should he come to the\r\n    throne. But the 'Sphinx' who dominated Europe for so long is fallen,\r\n    and it seems that my grandfather and dear old Kinglake were right, who\r\n    always said that he had long ears and was a sorry beast after all. Now\r\n    Europe thinks so, except the Rothschilds and the _Daily Telegraph_.\r\n    What will future ages say of the shameful story of the _coup d'état_\r\n    of 1851, of the undermining of the honour of every officer in the\r\n    French Army by promises of promotion for treachery to the nation, of\r\n    France ruined by the denying of all advancement to those who had not\r\n    Court favour, of the Morny war in Mexico--of Maximilian, abandoned\r\n    after having been betrayed, of the splendour of the Guards and of the\r\n    Imperial stables, of the plundering, of the degradation of justice, of\r\n    the spying by everybody on everybody else? What a sad farce the whole\r\n    thing was, but how seriously Europe took it at the time!\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK SEA TREATY--THE COMMUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1870, shortly after the Siege of Paris had begun, the\r\nRussian Chancellor, Gortschakof, intimated to the Powers that the Tsar\r\nproposed to repudiate that article in the Treaty of Paris which declared\r\nthe Black Sea neutral, forbade Russia to build arsenals on it, and limited\r\nher fleet there to six small vessels. [Footnote: Treaty of Paris, July\r\n13th, 1856 (Hertslet's _Treaties_, vol. xiv., p. 1172).] This particular\r\narticle had been specially demanded by England; and when France, desirous\r\nof closing the Crimean War, spoke of yielding to Russia's resistance,\r\nPalmerston had declared that without this stipulation England and Turkey\r\nmust carry on the war alone.\r\n\r\nSir Charles, on this matter as on many others, inclined to the\r\nPalmerstonian tradition, which was certainly neither that of Mr. Gladstone\r\nnor of Lord Granville. But Lord Granville gave him introductions for his\r\nprojected second journey to Russia, and charged the young Liberal member\r\nwith the task of representing the Cabinet's views:\r\n\r\n    \"In talking to Russians I hope that you will say that we are about the\r\n    most peaceable Ministry it is possible for England to have, but we are\r\n    determined not to put up with any indignity. On the other hand, we\r\n    greatly regret any stop to increasing good relations between the two\r\n    countries, and shall be glad to make them even more cordial than\r\n    before if we are properly treated.\"\r\n\r\nHe added the request that Sir Charles would write him first-hand\r\nimpressions of the situation in Russia.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Petersburg Sir Charles, in November, 1870, went to Moscow, where\r\nhe lived with the Mayor, Prince Tcherkasky, 'who afterwards became\r\nGovernor of Bulgaria, and died at San Stefano, just after the signature of\r\nthe Treaty.' He was thus brought into touch with 'the political intrigues'\r\nof the moment:\r\n\r\n    'The Imperial Prince, who was afterwards Alexander III., was no\r\n    stranger to them. Alexander II. was, like his grandfather Alexander\r\n    I., a German and a dreamer, as well as melancholy mad. His son, the\r\n    Imperial Prince, like his grandfather Nicholas and like Paul, was both\r\n    violent and sulky; but he was patriotic, and had at this time the\r\n    sense to put himself in the hands of the Moscow men.'\r\n\r\n\"It is satisfactory to know that the antagonism of an heir-apparent to the\r\nreigning Sovereign docs not depend on race or climate,\" was, says Sir\r\nCharles, Lord Granville's comment on this description.\r\n\r\n    'It was an interesting moment, and no foreign residence of my life was\r\n    ever more full of the charm which attaches to the development of new\r\n    political situations. The Emperor Alexander II. had fallen back from a\r\n    most brilliant early part of his reign into its second period, which\r\n    saw the rise of his unpopularity and the birth of Nihilism. He had\r\n    become frightened, had not perhaps lost all his good intentions, but\r\n    become too terrified to escape political reaction. His son, afterwards\r\n    Alexander III., was, as often happens in despotisms, glorified by a\r\n    popularity which he afterwards did not retain. When I saw the heir-\r\n    apparent at his palace he seemed to me to be a hard-working, stupid\r\n    man, and I never afterwards was able during his reign to divest myself\r\n    of this first impression.\r\n\r\n    'Of all those that I met in Russia, the ablest were the two brothers\r\n    Miliutine. The General, I think, survived his brother by a long time,\r\n    and continued to be Minister of War for years after his brother's\r\n    death; but the brother, the Miliutine of the reorganization of Poland\r\n    after the last Polish insurrection, who was when I knew him half\r\n    paralyzed in body but most brilliant in mind, struck me as being more\r\n    full of ideas than any man I have ever met. His inferior brother was,\r\n    though inferior, nevertheless a good Minister of War.\r\n\r\n    'The Miliutines were Liberals. The leader of the high Tory party of my\r\n    time was an equally remarkable man, Count Tolstoi, the iron\r\n    representative of iron Toryism, of perfect honesty, in whom energy and\r\n    strength were not destroyed by prejudice. He was the most ideal\r\n    minister of despotism that autocracy has produced, representing the\r\n    principles of order and authority with more ability than is generally\r\n    found in leaders of his type. He was intensely hated by the\r\n    Universities and by most of those, chiefly Liberals, with whom he\r\n    lived. But although he is said by his terrorism to have created\r\n    Nihilism, I am far from being convinced that any other course was\r\n    possible to the Russian Empire, and if this course was to be taken, he\r\n    took it well. In modern times there never was so unpopular a Minister,\r\n    and when, in after years, Alexander III. recalled him to power as\r\n    Minister of the Interior, one could not but feel that the break\r\n    between the principles acted on by this Sovereign as Emperor, and\r\n    those which he had honestly professed when heir-apparent, was\r\n    complete.\r\n\r\n    'I not only well knew Jomini, but I had made the acquaintance in 1868\r\n    in London (and renewed it at a later date) of his colleague Vlangali,\r\n    at that time as truly brilliant and as supple as Jomini himself,\r\n    though as silent as Jomini was talkative; ... and between them and\r\n    their marvellous subordinates, Hamburger the hunchback Jew, and his\r\n    head of the Asiatic Department, Westmann, I do not wonder that two\r\n    stupid men, the vain Gortschakof and the drill-sergeant de Giers, were\r\n    able successively to pretend to rule the Foreign Office without the\r\n    policy of the country suffering.\r\n\r\n    'In Katkof I was greatly disappointed. The man was very powerful under\r\n    two reigns, and with the exception of Count Tolstoi, he was the only\r\n    man who was so, since otherwise all the adherents of Alexander II.\r\n    were in disgrace during the reign of Alexander III.; but I could see\r\n    nothing in Katkof except strength of will and obstinacy. He was\r\n    entirely without judgment or measure or charm. The two Vassiltchikofs\r\n    were men of what is called in Russia a \"European\" type, or\r\n    \"civilized.\" There was nothing specially Russian about them, but they\r\n    were far pleasanter than as a rule are able Russians, and this was\r\n    also the case with Madame Novikof's brothers, the two Kiriefs. In\r\n    general it may be said that in the Moscow chiefs of the Slav\r\n    Committees there was more European give and take, and less obstinacy\r\n    or pig-headed Toryism of Russian character, than among any other set.\r\n    One of the Vassiltchikofs had an art collection, and afterwards\r\n    became, I think, Art Director at St. Petersburg, while the other, who\r\n    was the greater Slav, and who was the son-in-law of Prince Orlof\r\n    Davydof of St. Petersburg, who sent me to him at Moscow, was chiefly\r\n    given to good works in Moscow. I think, if I remember right, that my\r\n    hostess, Princess Tcherkasky, with whom I lodged, was their sister.\r\n\r\n    'I saw a good deal of Peter Schouvalof, known as \"all-powerful,\" of\r\n    whom I afterwards again saw a great deal when I was at the Foreign\r\n    Office and he was Ambassador in London. He was the bitter enemy of\r\n    Count Tolstoi all through life; but his complete fall, and it may even\r\n    be said utter destruction, during the reign of Alexander III., was, I\r\n    think, not owing to this fact, but because he was easygoing and had\r\n    made friends with the morganatic wife of Alexander II. in his last\r\n    years. Alexander III. never forgave anyone who had shown this\r\n    disrespect to the memory of his mother, although as soon as his son in\r\n    time succeeded to the throne, the members of the Imperial family\r\n    visiting France, who had never acknowledged the existence of the\r\n    Princess during all the years of Alexander III.'s reign, immediately\r\n    began to revisit her at Biarritz or in Paris.\r\n\r\n    'Peter Schouvalof represented the French Regency in our times, with\r\n    all its wit, with all its half-refined coarseness--the coarseness of\r\n    great gentlemen--with the drunkenness of the companions of the Regent,\r\n    and with their courage. At the time that I knew him in St. Petersburg\r\n    he was as much hated as his enemy Count Tolstoi, but that was because\r\n    he held the terrible office of head of the Third Section or Director\r\n    of the Secret Police, with the power of life and death over everyone\r\n    except the Emperor. It was a somewhat sinister contrast to find, in\r\n    one who used to the full the awful powers of his office, the greatest\r\n    gaiety that existed in mortal man, unless in Gambetta.\r\n\r\n    'K. Aksakof was in Moscow the superior in power even of Tcherkasky the\r\n    Mayor, even of the two Samarines, even of Miliutine of Moscow, the\r\n    brother of the General. He was not in reality so strong a man, but he\r\n    had the ear of the heir-apparent, and I cannot but think, from a good\r\n    deal which came to my knowledge at the time, that there was some\r\n    secret society organization among the Slavophiles, of which he was the\r\n    occult chief. Some think that had he liked he would have continued to\r\n    rule Alexander III. after the latter ascended the throne, but my own\r\n    impression is that he would have ended his days in Siberia. His\r\n    brother John, who survived and had influence, was a very different\r\n    man, and held other views. His influence for a time was enormous,\r\n    although I could more easily have understood the dominance in the\r\n    party of Miliutine or of Samarine. Katkof retained his influence\r\n    because he was above all of the despotic party. Aksakof would have\r\n    failed to retain his, because, although he held, as an article of\r\n    faith, that reforms must come from the Emperor to the people, yet he\r\n    desired that the Emperor should be a Russian Liberal--a very different\r\n    thing from a \"European\" Liberal, but still something different from\r\n    Alexander III. or from Count Tolstoi's ideal of a Russian autocrat....\r\n\r\n    'Among those I knew' (says a later note) 'was the pretty little child\r\n    of Count Chotek of the Austrian Embassy, the bosom friend of Prince\r\n    Henry VII. of Reuss, the Prussian Ambassador. The child's mother,\r\n    Chotek's wife, was Countess Kinsky. She became the wife of the\r\n    Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and the birth of her son, in 1902, was\r\n    hailed by the Magyars as that of an heir to the throne of the dual\r\n    monarchy, and may lead to civil war in Austria some day.' [Footnote:\r\n    It was the assassination of this Archduke which preceded the Great War\r\n    of 1914.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles continued to correspond with Lord Granville about the\r\ninternational complication. The Foreign Secretary wrote in December of the\r\nproposed Conference of London that--\r\n\r\n    \"It would not be a bad result that each side should imagine it had had\r\n    a victory. There would remain the public opinion of Europe, and as we\r\n    are neither of us popular, that may be tolerably impartial.\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian point of view had been put to Sir Charles before he left\r\nEngland in a letter from Baron Jomini, who complained that attempts to\r\nrevise the Treaty of Paris by a European Congress had repeatedly failed,\r\nbecause England had always made it a condition that at such \"a Congress\r\nthe Eastern question should not be raised.\" What, then, was open to\r\nRussia--since \"all the world privately admitted that the position created\r\nfor her by the Treaty of 1856 was inequitable and an obstacle to good\r\nunderstanding\" but to show the signatory Powers the impossibility of her\r\nremaining any longer in a false position?\r\n\r\nThe view which Sir Charles formed at the time was in strong condemnation\r\nof Lord Granville's action. In his opinion, Great Britain, by consenting\r\nto a Conference (proposed by Russia's friend; Prussia), consented to\r\nnegotiate upon an act of repudiation by which her own rights were\r\ninfringed; and this surrender seemed to him wholly unnecessary. Later\r\nknowledge only confirmed him in his opinion.\r\n\r\n    'We knew' (he writes in the Memoir) 'that Austria, the original\r\n    proposer of the neutralization, had on November 22nd stated that she\r\n    would join us in a war with Russia if we declared war upon the\r\n    question, and Italy had already declared that she would act with\r\n    Austria and ourselves. On the other hand, we now know (1906) that the\r\n    British Cabinet of 1856 did not contain a member who thought the\r\n    neutralization worth anything, or that it could be maintained beyond\r\n    \"the first opportunity.\" Gladstone, in 1879, returned to the question,\r\n    and said that even Turkey had been willing to agree in 1870 to what\r\n    had been done; but from a despatch to Lord Granville, dated November\r\n    24th, 1870, which has been published, it is clear that Austria, Italy,\r\n    and Turkey would have gone along with us. Under these circumstances no\r\n    fighting would have been wanted. All that we need have done would have\r\n    been to have declared that we should take no notice of the Russian\r\n    denunciation, and to have sent our fleet into the Black Sea, and the\r\n    Russians could have done nothing but give in, as a platonic\r\n    declaration that they were free would not have enabled them to launch\r\n    a ship. Then we might gracefully have yielded; but as it was, we gave\r\n    in to a mere threat of force.'\r\n\r\nAcceptance of the Conference, moreover, seemed to Sir Charles a betrayal\r\nof France. France, who had been England's ally in the Crimea, one of the\r\nsignatory Powers to the Black Sea Treaty, saw her capital beleaguered by\r\nthe Prussian friends of the Power which repudiated the Treaty, and could\r\nnot even send a representative to the Conference to protest.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, then, that at the opening of Parliament in 1871 the member\r\nfor Chelsea should raise this question. But to do so involved the bringing\r\nforward of a motion tantamount to a vote of censure on the Government,\r\nwhich Sir Charles Dilke himself supported; and Mr. Gladstone contrived to\r\nput his too critical supporter in a difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's Speech inevitably contained reference to Prince Gortschakof's\r\naction, and in both Houses there was considerable comment upon this in the\r\ndebate on the Address. The Prime Minister referred to the opportunity for\r\nfuller discussion which would be afforded by Sir Charles's motion, but,\r\nwhen pressed to name a day for the motion, deprecated discussion while the\r\nConference was sitting. Frequent questioning led finally to the\r\nintervention of Mr. Disraeli, who raised the whole question of Conference\r\nand Treaty in a speech, and was answered by Mr. Gladstone. When after all\r\nthis Sir Charles still persisted in his motion, the purpose of which was\r\nnot to discuss either the methods or the results of the Conference, but to\r\ndeplore the Government's action in having entered on it at all, Mr.\r\nGladstone declared that Government could spare no time, and would give a\r\nday only if it were taken as a direct vote of censure, which they must in\r\nhonour meet; adding that the day could only be found by the postponement\r\nof a Licensing Bill which had much support in the Liberal party. Sir\r\nCharles persevered, and made a very able speech, to which no serious\r\nanswer was given. He entirely destroyed the pretence that the Conference\r\nhad met without a \"foregone conclusion,\" and stigmatized the indecent\r\nhaste which could not wait to secure the presence of France even as an\r\nassenting party to this acceptance of an act of repudiation. But the House\r\nwas dominated by dislike for anything which seemed to hint at opening up a\r\nnew European war at the moment when a settlement of the existing conflict\r\nwas expected. The Tories, 'would only speak, and would not vote'; while\r\nSir Charles's Radical associates, such as Mr. Peter Rylands, welcomed\r\nanything done under pretext of avoiding war.\r\n\r\n    'An attempt was made by Sir Henry Bulwer, the cynical and brilliant\r\n    brother of Lord Lytton, by Mr. Horsman and Mr. Otway, to use my motion\r\n    for their own purposes. Otway had resigned his Under-Secretaryship of\r\n    Foreign Affairs on account of his strong opinion upon the question,\r\n    and was distressed to find that his resignation had fallen flat.\r\n    Horsman was always discontented, and Bulwer wanted to be a peer.\r\n    [Footnote: Sir Henry Bulwer was afterwards created Lord Calling; Mr.\r\n    Horsman had been a conspicuous Adullamite in the previous Parliament.]\r\n    I used to tell Bulwer up to his death that I gave him his peerage, for\r\n    he received Gladstone's offer of the peerage just in time to prevent\r\n    him from speaking for my motion. Bulwer, whom I had known as\r\n    Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Andrew Buchanan, whom I had known as\r\n    Ambassador at St. Petersburg, Horsman, and Otway came and dined with\r\n    me, and we made a great plot, and thought we were going to upset the\r\n    arrangement with the Russians. But Gladstone succeeded in taking away\r\n    Goldsmid, who was one of our very few Liberal supporters, made Bulwer\r\n    a peer, and left me only with Otway, Gregory, afterwards Governor of\r\n    Ceylon, and Horsman....\r\n\r\n    'I ought to have divided, even if I had been in a minority of one, for\r\n    the proposal to withdraw my motion brought a hornet's nest about my\r\n    ears, and was a parliamentary mistake.'\r\n\r\nMichel Chevalier, the celebrated French Economist and Free Trader, wrote\r\nthanking Sir Charles. He had spent, he said, thirty years of his life in\r\nadvocating an Anglo-French understanding, and now he would not know how to\r\nlook his countrymen in the face were it not for the courageous utterances\r\nof a few friendly Englishmen to which he could point as evidences of a\r\ngood-will that had not forsaken France in her evil day.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    'Immediately after my return to England in the middle of the winter of\r\n    1870-1871, which had already been the severest ever known in Russia, I\r\n    again started for the scene of war. I first visited the army of\r\n    General Faidherbe, which was gallantly fighting in the north, and I\r\n    was present at one of the engagements near Bapaume, in which the\r\n    French took prisoners sixty sharpshooters of the Prussian Landwehr--\r\n    splendid soldiers, towering above our little Frenchmen, to whom it\r\n    seemed incredible, whatever the odds, they should have surrendered. I\r\n    never saw so wretched an army to look at as Faidherbe's. His cavalry\r\n    were but a squadron. He had one good regiment of foot Chasseurs and\r\n    two good regiments of marines; and the gunners of his artillery\r\n    (escaped men from Sedan) were excellent, and the guns were new; but he\r\n    had for his main body some 20,000 second-skim of the National Guard,\r\n    the cream from the north having been sent south to the Army of the\r\n    East under Bourbaki, with whom they were driven into Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    'Ours were what schoolboys would call second choice. Oh, such men! and\r\n    without boots, without overcoats, facing arctic weather in wooden\r\n    shoes and old sacks--facing the Prussians, too, with old muzzle-\r\n    loading guns; but they fought well, and their leader, a man of genius,\r\n    made the most of them. I returned two or three times to England--that\r\n    is, to Dover--to eat and buy things I could carry, for I could hardly\r\n    get anything at Lille, where, by the way, I heard Gambetta make his\r\n    great speech. It was the finest oratorical display to which I ever\r\n    listened, though I have heard Castelar, Bright, Gladstone, the Prime\r\n    Minister Lord Derby, Gathorne Hardy, and Father Félix (the great\r\n    Jesuit preacher) often, at their very best.\r\n\r\n    'Picking up Auberon Herbert, who was on his way to Versailles to wait\r\n    for the surrender of Paris in order to take in food to his brother\r\n    Alan, who was serving as a doctor on the ambulance inside, I went to\r\n    the siege of Longwy. Like all the fortresses of France bombarded in\r\n    this war, with two exceptions, it surrendered far too easily.\r\n\r\n    'From Longwy we passed on to Montmédy, at which latter place we\r\n    witnessed the immediate effects of a fearful railway accident, a\r\n    collision in a tunnel between a trainful of French prisoners and one\r\n    of recruits for the Prussian Guards. The scene in the darkness and\r\n    smoke, with the stalwart, long-bearded Landwehr men, who formed the\r\n    garrison of the town, holding blazing torches of pine and pitch, and\r\n    the glare from the fires of the upset engines, was one which would\r\n    have delighted Rembrandt. When a rush of water, a cataract from the\r\n    roof of the lately blown-up tunnel, suddenly occurred, adding to the\r\n    horror of the night, the place was pandemonium. Almost the only men\r\n    unhurt in the front carriages, which were smashed to pieces, were the\r\n    Mayors of the villages on the line, travelling compulsorily as\r\n    hostages for the safety of the trains. I made military reflections on\r\n    the advantage of blowing up tunnels, as against the practice of\r\n    destroying bridges and so forth.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was one of the first in Paris after the siege (which was\r\nraised by an armistice on January 29th, 1871), taking in with him a large\r\nquantity of condensed milk, of which he made presents to his Paris\r\nfriends. The purpose of the armistice was to enable regular conditions to\r\nbe signed between the conqueror and the conquered. The Imperial Government\r\nhad declared war on Prussia; but the Empire had fallen and the existing\r\nGovernment was only provisional. It had a branch in Paris, another branch\r\nin Bordeaux, and between these the investing army barred all\r\nintercommunication. The purpose of the armistice was to allow the holding\r\nof elections throughout France to return a National Assembly, which in its\r\nturn should appoint Ministers fully authorized to treat for peace. The\r\nelections did but emphasize the division between Paris and the provinces,\r\nfor in Paris an Ultra-Radical representative was returned, while in the\r\ncountry a considerable majority of monarchical deputies were elected.\r\nRepublican France feared, and not without cause, some attempt to re-\r\nestablish a dynasty.\r\n\r\nWhen, on February 20th, the new Government, with Thiers at its head,\r\nsigned preliminaries of peace, a condition was included which stipulated\r\nthat the Prussian troops should formally enter Paris and remain for three\r\ndays in possession of all the forts before evacuating the place. The\r\nNational Guard, refusing to obey orders, entrenched itself in Montmartre;\r\nthe seat of government was transferred to Versailles, lately the Prussian\r\nheadquarters; fighting broke out in the streets, and the control of the\r\ncity was seized in the name of the Commune.\r\n\r\nSo began the second siege, in which revolutionary Paris stood at bay\r\nagainst those whom they called 'the Prussians of Versailles,' while the\r\nreal Prussians, still occupying part of the exterior line of forts, looked\r\non, impartial spectators. Sir Charles writes:\r\n\r\n    'At this time my attention was exclusively turned to foreign affairs,\r\n    and immediately after my Black Sea speech I started for Paris. I took\r\n    with me an appointment as a Daily News correspondent--not that I\r\n    intended to correspond, but only because it would explain my presence.\r\n    Having been unable to leave London during the first days of the rising\r\n    of March 18th, which developed into the Commune of Paris, I left it\r\n    with my brother on April 2nd, and reached Creil at night, and St.\r\n    Denis in the morning. From Creil I wrote to my grandmother: \"We shall\r\n    reach Paris in the morning. It is no use writing, and we shall not be\r\n    able to write to you.\" We drove into Paris, and at once went to the\r\n    Hotel de Ville, where we found the famous Central Committee sitting.\r\n    We obtained from some Garibaldian officers of the Staff a special pass\r\n    to leave Paris in order to see Gustave Flourens, for whom I was\r\n    carrying a private letter from a friend of his in London.... The drums\r\n    were beating through the streets all day, and great numbers of\r\n    National Guards were under arms attempting to march upon Versailles,\r\n    and there was heavy fighting, which we witnessed from a distance.\r\n\r\n    'We counted 160 battalions of National Guards all carrying the red\r\n    flag, and saw altogether, as near as we could compute, almost 110,000\r\n    men. That all Paris was in the movement at this time was clear, not\r\n    only from this fact, but also from the following: that on March 26th\r\n    between 226,000 and 227,000 electors voted, a full vote for Paris\r\n    considering the great number of persons who, having left Paris before\r\n    the siege, had not returned. In the municipal elections after the\r\n    Commune, when the Conservatives had come back and made a great attempt\r\n    to win, the total number of voters was only 186,000. I noticed at the\r\n    Hôtel de Ville that the Parisians had a great many sailors in uniform\r\n    with them. These were sailors who had remained in Paris after serving\r\n    there during the siege, and my pass was handed to me by a splendid\r\n    specimen of a French tar wearing the name of the _Richelieu_ on his\r\n    hat. I was one of the few persons not in the insurrection (and these\r\n    were mostly killed) who saw the pictures in the Hôtel de Ville so\r\n    late--that is, so soon before the fire which destroyed them all--and I\r\n    recognized old friends which I had known from 1855, when I was there\r\n    at the great ball. Those who showed us from room to room were chiefly\r\n    Garibaldian Poles, among them the Dombrowskis, one of whom was killed,\r\n    and two of whom I afterwards befriended in London in their exile.\r\n\r\n    'The next morning we left Paris early by the Vaugirard gate, for no\r\n    one could tell us where Flourens was engaged. We had followed the main\r\n    line of fighting; his death occurred upon the other line; but so great\r\n    was the confusion of these days that we knew nothing of it until the\r\n    5th. We thought that to make for Clamart would be the surest course to\r\n    bring us to the forefront of battle, and at 8 a.m. we were in Issy. We\r\n    then heard heavy firing, and came over the hill between Forts Issy and\r\n    Vanves, but there was a dense fog which deadened sound, and it was not\r\n    till we were well down the hillside that we heard the crunch of the\r\n    machine-guns, when we suddenly found ourselves under a heavy fire from\r\n    the other side. Seeing the railway embankment in front of us at the\r\n    bottom of the hill, we ran down and got under shelter near an arch at\r\n    the corner of a park wall, which may, perhaps, have been the cemetery.\r\n    Here we sat in safety while the bullets sang in swarms through the\r\n    trees over our heads, while the forts cannonaded the heights, and the\r\n    heights bombarded the forts, and while the federal regiments of the\r\n    National Guard tried in vain to carry once more the line of hills\r\n    which they had carried on the previous day, but had of their own\r\n    accord at night abandoned, having no commissariat. They used, in fact,\r\n    to go home to dinner. Indeed, many would in the morning take an\r\n    omnibus to the battlefield, and fight, and take the omnibus back home\r\n    again to dine and sleep--a system of warfare which played into the\r\n    hands of the experienced old soldiers--the police of Paris--all ex-\r\n    non-commissioned officers, and the equally well-trained Customs guards\r\n    and forest guards, by whom they were opposed. General Vinoy, who was\r\n    commanding, had, however, heavy work on this day, in which Duval, the\r\n    General of the Commune, met his death within a quarter of a mile of\r\n    the spot where we were hiding. With this day ended, indeed, the\r\n    offensive operations of the Federalists against Versailles, and began\r\n    the offensive operations of the regulars against Paris. After sitting\r\n    a long time in our corner we found ourselves starved, and ran up the\r\n    hill by the park wall, under a heavy fire, to Issy and then walked\r\n    into Paris. I have a bullet in my room which struck the wall between\r\n    us just as we reached shelter at the top. One of my curiosities of the\r\n    time is the official newspaper of April 4th, which was conducted, of\r\n    course, for the insurrection, but which played so well at being\r\n    official that it announced as good news the telegrams from Algeria\r\n    showing that the Arab insurrection was being put down, although the\r\n    Government which was putting down this insurrection was the very same\r\n    Government which was engaged in putting down the more formidable\r\n    insurrection in Paris, to which the journal temporarily belonged.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, the 5th, my brother went to the fighting at Neuilly\r\n    bridge, where the troops from Versailles were beginning to develop a\r\n    serious attack, destined, however, to continue for six weeks without\r\n    result, for Paris was not entered at this point. I, with a letter from\r\n    Franqueville [Footnote: Le Comte de Franqueville, well known to a\r\n    large circle of English friends by his book, _Le Gouvernement et le\r\n    Parlement Britanniques_ (Paris, 1887).] to the Duc de Broglie,\r\n    afterwards Prime Minister, in one pocket, and a pass from the\r\n    Insurrection in the other, left Paris at 5 a.m. by the Porte\r\n    Montrouge, and walked by Bourg la Reine to La Croix de Berny, and\r\n    thence by Châtenay to La Cour Roland, where I met a cavalry patrol of\r\n    the regular forces, and then came to an infantry camp. Having shown my\r\n    letter, my English passport, and my appointment as a newspaper\r\n    correspondent, I was allowed to go on to Versailles. There I slept on\r\n    a table, there being a terrible crowd of Paris fugitives in the town.\r\n    In the morning I had my interview with the Duke. He was kind to me,\r\n    and I saw much of him in London and in Paris in later years. Thiers\r\n    was right in alluding to his dull father as \"The Duc de Broglie; the\r\n    other, _the_ duke.\" But both were narrow doctrinaires.\r\n\r\n    'After looking at M. Thiers' reserves, which at this time consisted of\r\n    250 guns parked on the Place d'Armes, with no artillerymen to work\r\n    them, and a Paris regiment, the 118th, raised during the siege, locked\r\n    up in the park to prevent their joining the insurrection, I started\r\n    for St. Germain, where I met Major Anson, M.P., afterwards the leader\r\n    of \"the Colonels\" (who resisted abolition of army purchase) in the\r\n    House of Commons, and lunched, watching the firing of Mont Valérien on\r\n    Paris. I then drove to St. Denis, the Prussian headquarters. Thence I\r\n    drove again (the La Chapelle gate of Paris being shut) to Pantin.\r\n    After a long parley the Belleville-Villette drawbridge was lowered for\r\n    me, and I was admitted to Paris, having been almost all round it in\r\n    the two days.\r\n\r\n    'Major Anson gave me a bag of gold to pay to his brother's (Lord\r\n    Lichfield's) cook. This man was in Paris, and on the 7th I called on\r\n    him at a house close to the Ministry of the Interior, and to the\r\n    Palace of the Elysée. The cook's rooms were at the top of the house,\r\n    over the Librairie, still there in 1907. He received the visit of\r\n    myself and my brother in bed. \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but I have been\r\n    fighting these three days, and I am tired out.\" I asked his wife what\r\n    he was fighting for, and she did not in the least know. No more did\r\n    he, for the matter of that. He was fighting because his battalion was\r\n    fighting. \"The Prussians of Versailles\" had taken the place of the\r\n    other Prussians; that was all. At this moment 215 battalions of the\r\n    National Guard supported the insurrection, having joined in pursuance\r\n    of the resolution that, in the event of the seat of Government being\r\n    transferred from Paris to any other place, Paris was to constitute\r\n    itself a separate Republic. This more than anything else was at the\r\n    bottom of the insurrection, and, as M. Jules Simon has said, \"many\r\n    Republicans who were neither Socialists nor Revolutionists hesitated.\r\n    One asked oneself if in fighting on the side of order one was not at\r\n    the same time fighting for a dynasty.\" Then, again, serving in the\r\n    National Guard meant pay and food, especially for the working man, for\r\n    there was no work to be got in Paris, as business had not been\r\n    reopened. Moreover, Paris was writhing with rage at the Prussian\r\n    entry, and Parisian vanity was engaged on the side of the\r\n    insurrection.\r\n\r\n    'The insurrection was certainly at this time very far from being a\r\n    communistic movement, as from a natural confusion of names it was\r\n    thought to be by foreigners. There was a burning jealousy in Paris of\r\n    the \"Rurals,\" and a real fear, not ill-founded, that a Royalist\r\n    conspiracy was on foot. The irritations of the siege, however, played\r\n    the largest part. The National Guard, who had fought very well at\r\n    Buzenval on January 19th, profoundly moved by the capitulation, had\r\n    carried off their guns to their own part of Paris in February, and it\r\n    may be said that the insurrection dated from that time, and was\r\n    historically a protest against the peace, for M. Thiers temporized\r\n    with the insurrection until the old seasoned soldiers were beginning\r\n    to return to him from their captivity in Germany. The fighting began\r\n    with the sudden attempt of the Government to remove by force the guns\r\n    which had been taken to Montmartre, followed as it was by the murder\r\n    of two Generals by the mob. [Footnote: General Lecomte and Clément\r\n    Thomas, the Commandant of the National Guard, were shot on March 18th,\r\n    1871, under conditions of peculiar brutality.] A number of men threw\r\n    themselves into the movement from love of fighting for fighting's\r\n    sake, like the Garibaldian Poles. Some joined it from ambition, but\r\n    the majority of the men who later on died on the walls or in the\r\n    streets in the Federalist ranks died, as they believed, for the\r\n    Republic, and had no idea of the plunder of the rich. Ricciotti\r\n    Garibaldi was near Dijon \"in observation,\" as he afterwards told me.\r\n    He said that he wanted to march upon Versailles with his excellent\r\n    little army, which would have followed him, and fought well, and would\r\n    certainly have taken the new capital, although it would have been\r\n    crushed later on. He telegraphed to Garibaldi, and \"Papa\" telegraphed\r\n    to him not to move, Garibaldi being wiser, perhaps, in his son's case\r\n    than he would have been had it been his own, for he was not remarkable\r\n    for wisdom. It was a strange moment: the Prussians watching the\r\n    fighting from those of the forts which were still in their hands, and\r\n    a careless, idle Paris crowd of boys and women watching it from the\r\n    walls.\r\n\r\n    'On the 7th my brother and I were all but killed by a shell from Mont\r\n    Valérien which suddenly burst, we not having heard it, close to us in\r\n    a garden at the corner of the Place de l'Étoile and Avenue d'Uhrich,\r\n    as the Avenue de l'Impératrice had at this time been named, from the\r\n    General who defended Strasbourg. During the 7th and 8th a senseless\r\n    bombardment of a peaceable part of Paris waxed warm, and continued for\r\n    some days uselessly to destroy the houses of the best supporters of\r\n    the Conservative Assembly without harming the Federalists, who did not\r\n    even cross the quarter. M. Simon has said that Thiers did not bombard\r\n    Paris; that he only bombarded the walls of Paris at the two points at\r\n    which he intended to make a breach.... All I can say is that if this\r\n    was the intention there must have been someone in command at Mont\r\n    Valérien who failed to carry it into effect, and who amused himself by\r\n    knocking the best part of Paris to pieces out of mischief, for no\r\n    artilleryman could have been so incapable as to fire from hill to hill\r\n    when intending to fire down into that which, viewed from Mont\r\n    Valérien, looks like a hole. In 1841, curiously enough, Thiers had\r\n    been accused, at the time of the erection of the forts of which Mont\r\n    Valérien was one, of making it possible that Paris should be bombarded\r\n    in this way, and had indignantly replied, asking the Assembly if they\r\n    believed that after having _inondé de ses feux la demeure de vos\r\n    familles_ a Government could expect to be continued in power. But in\r\n    1871 he did it, and was continued in power for a time, and that with\r\n    the triumphant support at the moment of the very persons whose houses\r\n    he had destroyed. The Commune had a broad back, and that back was made\r\n    to bear the responsibility of the destruction.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles returned to his duties in London after the Easter recess, but\r\nhe was back in Paris to see the last moments of the second siege. On May\r\n21st the army had forced its way into the city, though several days of\r\nbitter street fighting remained, in which the town was fired, and the\r\nHôtel de Ville and Ministry of Finance were destroyed. [Footnote: Sir\r\nCharles writes of the celebrated order, \"Flambez Finances\": 'the order to\r\nburn the Ministry of Finance was an undoubted forgery, as a distinguished\r\nFrenchman, signing himself \"A Communalist,\" showed in the _Pall Mall\r\nGazette_. The evidence before the court-martial of the porter of the\r\nMinistry of Finance, that the fire was caused by shells, confirms my view,\r\nand shows how the events of the moment have been distorted by the passions\r\nof writers.'] Sir Charles had foreseen the destruction of these uildings,\r\n\"because they were behind great barricades in the direct line of the\r\nnecessary attack,\" and was also proud of the verification which a minor\r\nmilitary forecast received. Alan Herbert, Auberon's elder brother, who for\r\nmany years practised as a doctor in Paris, was awakened on May 21st by a\r\ndisturbance in the street, and\r\n\r\n    '\"saw several National Guards and dirty-looking fellows taking counsel\r\n    together whether they should raise a barricade opposite my windows,\r\n    and they were actually beginning it. However,\" he wrote to his mother,\r\n    Lady Carnarvon, \"Sir Charles Dilke, when he was in Paris with Auberon,\r\n    came to see me here, and the question being raised as to a barricade\r\n    being placed opposite my windows he decided it could not be, as the\r\n    only proper place for one would be some doors lower down at the\r\n    meeting of the three streets. This recollection was some consolation\r\n    to me, and his opinion was quite correct, for an officer arrived,\r\n    supposed to have been the General Dombrowski, who made them begin\r\n    lower down.\"'\r\n\r\nIt was on May 25th that Sir Charles left London to reach Paris, which was\r\nknown by the 24th to be in flames.\r\n\r\n    'Crossing by Calais, I reached St. Denis at night, drove to Le\r\n    Bourget, got a pass into Paris from the Germans at dawn, with a\r\n    warning, however, that it would not bring me out again. By the\r\n    drizzling rain I passed unhindered into Paris, all the gates being\r\n    open and the drawbridges down, as the Federalists were both within and\r\n    without the walls. I reached the great barricade in front of the gates\r\n    of the Docks de la Villette at seven in the morning. My road had been\r\n    lighted till the daylight grew strong by the flames of the\r\n    conflagration of the warehouses. This day, Friday the 26th, was that\r\n    of the third or last massacre of hostages--the thirty-seven gendarmes,\r\n    the fifteen policemen, the eleven priests, and four other people, I\r\n    believe. It was a very useless crime. When I reached the great\r\n    barricade at a meeting of roads, one of which I think was called Route\r\n    d'Allemagne, fighting had just recommenced after a pause during the\r\n    night. At this point the field artillery were bombarding the barricade\r\n    from the Rue Lafayette. I stood all day in comparative safety at the\r\n    door of a baker's shop in the Rue de Flandre, for the baker was\r\n    interested in what was going on sufficiently to keep his door open and\r\n    look out and talk with me, though his shutters were up at all the\r\n    windows. When evening came the Federalists still at this point\r\n    maintained their strong position, and I, of course, knew nothing of\r\n    the movements on the south by which the troops had all but hemmed them\r\n    in. The baker with whom I had made friends offered me hospitality for\r\n    the night, which I accepted, and I might have stayed longer with him\r\n    had I pleased; but not knowing how long the fighting might continue, I\r\n    determined to make my way into the Versailles lines at dawn.\r\n\r\n    'Fighting in our quarter had been again suspended at night, and in the\r\n    grey light of early morning (it was fine after a long rain) I left my\r\n    baker and made my way to the left, the left again, and then down a\r\n    long street towards the Eastern Railway. A sentry about two hundred\r\n    yards off presented his piece. I stood still in the middle of the\r\n    street. He seemed then not to know what to do. I had on the red-cross\r\n    armlet which I wore throughout the war, and held a white handkerchief\r\n    in my hand. I suppose I looked respectable enough to be allowed to\r\n    come nearer, for he let me advance. When near enough I called to him\r\n    that I wished to speak with the officer of the post. He called out a\r\n    corporal, to whom I made the same statement. They kept me there for a\r\n    time which seemed an age, and then brought an officer. I shouted to\r\n    him that I was an English newspaper correspondent, that I had an\r\n    authorization as such, an English passport, and a Prussian pass into\r\n    Paris, and that I was known to the Due de Broglie and to Lord Lyons;\r\n    also that I could name friends in the centre of Paris to whom I might\r\n    be sent under guard. He let me pass, and said: \"Allez! Vous avez eu de\r\n    la chance.\" I went straight to the Arts et Métiers. The dead were\r\n    lying thick in the streets, especially at the Porte St. Martin\r\n    barricade, where they were being placed in tumbrils. The fighting had\r\n    been very heavy; the troops alone had lost 12,000 killed and wounded\r\n    after entering Paris. At least as many Federalists were killed\r\n    fighting, or wounded and finished, besides the great number shot after\r\n    their surrender. I found Tresca, the father, picking up the pieces of\r\n    the shells which were bursting in the courtyard, and putting them all\r\n    together with wires, to the greater glory of his own particular make.\r\n    It was the Federal artillery on the heights which was bombarding Paris\r\n    with Tresca's shells. When one burst perfectly into some twenty equal\r\n    pieces he would say:\" Beautiful; that is one of mine.\" Any that burst\r\n    into one large piece and two or three little ones he set down to the\r\n    \"génie militaire\" of Vincennes.\r\n\r\n    'After several days I left Paris with Dr. W. H. Russell of the\r\n    _Times_, my former opponent at Chelsea at the '68 election, whom I had\r\n    last previously seen at Nancy on the day of Mars la Tour, and returned\r\n    to London, having for the purpose of leaving Paris a pass from Marshal\r\n    MacMahon's Chief of the Staff, which I still preserve.' [Footnote:\r\n    This Diary Extract of the War of 1870 was published in the _Nineteenth\r\n    Century_ of January, 1914.]\r\n\r\nSo ends the story. Later in life, during his championship of army reform\r\nin the House of Commons, a Tory Colonel interrupted the civilian critic\r\nwith some bluntness. \"I have been on more battlefields,\" Sir Charles\r\nretorted, \"than the honourable and gallant member has ever seen.\" The\r\nwhite ambulance cap, with its black and green peak, which he preserved as\r\na memento, bore on its lining:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"WÖRTH.               ORLÉANS.\r\n    PHALSBOURG.           LONGWY.\r\n    MARS LA TOUR.         BAPAUME.\r\n    GRAVELOTTE.           PARIS.\"\r\n\r\nPreserved among Sir Charles's papers, and dated September 30th, 1870,\r\nthere is this letter from John Stuart Mill:\r\n\r\n    \"If Gladstone had been a great man, this war would never have broken\r\n    out, for he would have nobly taken upon himself the responsibility of\r\n    declaring that the English Navy should actively aid whichever of the\r\n    two Powers was attacked by the other. This would have been the\r\n    beginning of the international justice we are calling for. I do not\r\n    blame Gladstone for not daring to do it, for it requires a morally,\r\n    braver man than any of our statesmen to run this kind of risk.\"\r\n\r\nAt the outset of hostilities France, and not Germany, appeared to Sir\r\nCharles not only ostensibly, but really the attacking Power, and therefore\r\nthe true menace to the liberties of Europe. The policy of Louis Napoleon\r\nwas apparently responsible for the Franco-German War, and as he said in\r\n_Greater Britain_: \"If the English race has a mission in the world, it is\r\nsurely this, to prevent peace on earth from depending upon the verdict of\r\na single man.\" With the fall of Napoleon and observation of the Germans as\r\nconquerors, Sir Charles became wholly French in his sympathies, and before\r\nlong his close study of events preceding the war showed him that it had\r\nreally been of Bismarck's making. This did not lead him to advocate\r\n\"alliance,\" for when alliances between various Powers were constantly\r\nadvocated, he declared his belief that \"the time for permanent alliances\r\nis past\"; [Footnote: Speech at Chelsea to his constituents, January 24th,\r\n1876.] but his observations in these years made him through life the\r\nsteady friend of France, the constant upholder of her value to Europe, the\r\nadvocate of fellowship between her free greatness and that of his own free\r\ncountry. \"France,\" said he, \"has in England no stronger friend than I.\" He\r\nlectured and spoke more than once upon the great war and its results, and\r\nthe passage which ends a Recess speech of 1875 was delivered after one of\r\nthe critical moments when Germany had shown a disposition to renew attack\r\non France. Someone had spoken of Germany \"as the most 'moral' among the\r\nnations.\" Sir Charles replied:\r\n\r\n    'Not only do I think the conduct of Prussia towards Denmark the\r\n    reverse of \"moral,\" but I confess I have the same opinions of her\r\n    later conduct towards France.... No doubt the military law presses\r\n    hardly on the German people, and no doubt the Prussian Court tells\r\n    them that it is the fault of France; but is it true? Do not believe in\r\n    the French lamb troubling the waters to the hurt of the Prussian wolf.\r\n    Taxes and emigration increase in Germany because, as Count Moltke said\r\n    in his place in Parliament, \"Germany must stand armed to the teeth for\r\n    fifty years to defend the provinces which it took her but six months\r\n    to win.\" But why have taken them? Did not England and Austria at the\r\n    time warn Prussia what would be the wretched consequences of the act?\r\n    German fears of to-day are the direct outcome of the frightful terms\r\n    which victorious Germany imposed on France. She might have had money,\r\n    reduction of forces, dismantlement of fortresses, but she would have\r\n    the dismemberment of France and her money too. She insisted, in\r\n    defiance of all modern political ideas, in tearing provinces from a\r\n    great country against their will. France has since that time set an\r\n    example of moderation of tone, yet Germany cries out that she will\r\n    fight again, and crush her enemy to the dust. Poor German Liberals,\r\n    who abandoned all their principles when they consented to tear Alsace\r\n    and Lorraine from France, and who now find themselves powerless\r\n    against the war party, who say: \"What the sword has won the sword\r\n    shall keep!\"'\r\n\r\nHe then quoted 'the words of an Alsatian Deputy who spoke before the\r\nGerman Parliament on February 16th, 1874, words which were received with\r\nhowls and jeers, but which were none the less eloquent and true.' The\r\nwords dealt with the dismemberment of France, and ended with this passage:\r\n\"Had you spared us you would have won the admiration of the world, and war\r\nhad become impossible between us and you. As it is, you go on arming, and\r\nyou force all Europe to arm also. Instead of opening an age of peace, you\r\nhave inaugurated an era of war; and now you await fresh campaigns, fresh\r\nlists of killed and wounded, containing the names of your brothers and\r\nyour sons.\" \"The view of this Alsatian Deputy is my view,\" said Sir\r\nCharles: \"I do not believe that might makes right.... For our own sakes as\r\nwell as hers, T pray that France may not be crushed. France is not merely\r\n_one_ of the nations. The place of France is not greater than the place of\r\nEngland, but it is different. The place of France is one which no other\r\nnation can quite hold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL LIST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disregard of party allegiance which Sir Charles showed in regard to\r\nthe Education Bill and the Black Sea Conference did not grow less as time\r\nwent on. When the Ballot Bill of 1870 was in Committee, he moved an\r\namendment to extend the hours of polling from four o'clock to eight, as\r\nmany working men would be unable to reach the poll by the earlier hour.\r\nThere was much talk in debate of the danger which would ensue from\r\ncarrying on so dangerous an operation as voting after dark, and the\r\nGovernment Whips were actually put on to tell against this proposal; nor\r\nwas any extension of the hours effected till 1878, and then by Sir Charles\r\nDilke himself, in a Bill applying to London only, which he introduced as a\r\nprivate member of the Opposition under a Tory Government.\r\n\r\nThe first of the many Bills introduced by him was that to amend the\r\nprocedure of registration, which in the session of 1871 he got\r\nsuccessfully through Committee stage; but it perished in the annual\r\n\"slaughter of the innocents.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the measures which contributed to a decline of the Government's\r\npopularity was the unlucky proposal in Mr. Lowe's Budget of 1871 to levy a\r\ntax on matches; and Sir Charles was the first to raise this matter\r\nspecifically in Committee, condemning the impost as one which would be\r\nspecially felt by the poor, and would deprive the humblest class of\r\nworkers of much employment. On the day when Lowe was forced to withdraw\r\nthe obnoxious proposal, Sir Charles had opened the attack by a question\r\nchallenging Government interference with a procession of the matchmakers\r\norganized to protest against the tax. He was, therefore, personally\r\nidentified with the rebuff administered to the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous spectacle of events in France had inevitably bred a panic\r\nin England. It was proposed to increase the active army by 70,000 men. Sir\r\nCharles was no friend to panics, and he was one of the seven who voted\r\nagainst the motion.\r\n\r\nBut his was not merely a blank negative directed against any proposal for\r\nincreasing the standing army. He writes:\r\n\r\n    \"About this time\" (March, 1871) \"I promoted a movement in favour of a\r\n    system of universal instruction in arms, and between fifty and sixty\r\n    members of Parliament attended the meeting which I called, the most\r\n    prominent among them being Sir M. Hicks Beach, Mr. Mundella, and Henry\r\n    James. We all lived to know better.\"\r\n\r\nThose who joined him in this momentary propaganda dropped the proposal of\r\nuniversal instruction in arms, and turned their attention elsewhere. He\r\nsubstituted for it another ideal of military efficiency, and laboured all\r\nhis life to give it effect. Speaking to his constituents at Kensington in\r\nthe autumn of 1871, he advocated \"the separation of the Indian from the\r\nhome army, and the adoption of the Swiss rather than of the Prussian\r\nmilitary system.\" As a Radical, he faced the question whether Radicals\r\nought to interest themselves at all in army reform, and he answered:\r\n\r\n    \"As a mere matter of insurance, it is worth taking some trouble to\r\n    defend ourselves. There are, however, higher reasons for such\r\n    interest, and among them are treaty obligations and the duty which we\r\n    owe to the rest of the world of not suppressing our influence--on the\r\n    whole a just and moral one.\"\r\n\r\n'In these words,' Sir Charles notes, 'there lies in a nutshell all that I\r\nafterwards wrote at much greater length upon army reform in my book, _The\r\nBritish Army_.'\r\n\r\nIn this year he made a visit to the autumn manoeuvres, then held for the\r\nfirst time, and 'looked upon by the army reformers as the dawn of a new\r\nday.' Sir Charles, however, with his knowledge of war, 'thought them\r\nsingularly bad.' He was to repeat that experience several times, attending\r\nmanoeuvres both in France and England. He held that annual manoeuvres were\r\n\"essential to efficiency,\" and with other army reformers brought later\r\nmuch pressure to bear on the Government to secure this end.\r\n\r\nAs early as February, 1871, Mr. Trevelyan (then out of office) had written\r\nto propose \"a little meeting of Radical army reformers, say ten or twelve\r\nor fifteen, to arrange parts for practical work in the House, and to found\r\na nucleus for an Army Reform Association in case of dire need (to stump\r\nthe country).\" The stumping of the country Mr. Trevelyan did himself, and\r\nhis speeches led to the abolition in this year of the purchase system.\r\nWhat he wanted of Sir Charles is indicated by another sentence: \"There\r\nnever was a time when your turn for organization would be of more\r\nimmediate value.\" But even more immediate use was made of Sir Charles's\r\nwillingness to confront unpopularity. The \"practical\" part assigned to him\r\nin House of Commons' work was to undertake a motion (on going into\r\nCommittee of Supply) for the suppression of two regiments of Household\r\nCavalry and the substitution of two regiments of cavalry of the line. The\r\nchange was justified by Sir Charles not only on the score of economy, but\r\nupon the ground that heavy cavalry had proved unserviceable in the Franco-\r\nPrussian War. Whatever his arguments, this attack on the maintenance of\r\nprivileged troops brought social displeasure on the assailant.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Queen had consented to abandon the tradition which made the\r\nappointment of the Commander-in-Chief a matter within the Sovereign's\r\npersonal control; and the subordination of the military head of the forces\r\nto the Secretary for War was formally recognized. But the Duke of\r\nCambridge continued to be Commander-in-Chief, and army reformers were\r\nextremely desirous to remove him. On this subject the Press was reticent\r\nno less than public speakers, and finally it was left for Sir Charles to\r\nadvocate in the speech at Kensington already referred to the substitution\r\nof some other officer \"more amenable to parliamentary control.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Civil Service had been (with the exception of one preserve,\r\nthe Foreign Office) thrown open to competitive examination. In 1871 the\r\ninstitution of purchase in the army perished after a fierce conflict.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1871 Sir Charles arranged to deliver at great centres\r\nthroughout the country a series of speeches advocating a redistribution of\r\nseats which should make representation more real because more equitable.\r\nThe first of the series, delivered in Manchester, merely propounded the\r\nview that a minority in Parliament very often represented a large majority\r\nof voters, because one member might have 13,000 electors and another only\r\n130. But when he came to speak at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on November 6th, he\r\ngave this general principle definite application to a particular instance,\r\nin which very small minorities had nevertheless represented very large\r\nbodies of the electorate, and, as Sir Charles held, very widespread\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThis instance was the vote for an allowance of £15,000 a year to Prince\r\nArthur, proposed on his coming of age. Radical opinion had been already\r\nstirred in the earlier part of the Session by the Queen's request for a\r\ndowry of £30,000 for the Princess Louise on her marriage with the Marquis\r\nof Lorne; and Mr. Peter Taylor, in opposing the dowry, had spoken of the\r\nprobability that such a grant would strengthen the tendency towards\r\nrepublican views among the artisan class. [Footnote: Taylor's opposition\r\nhad led to a division, in which Fawcett had a lobby to himself, Dilke,\r\nwith Taylor, being tellers for the \"Noes.\" But on the question of the\r\nallowance to Prince Arthur fifty-three voted for a reduction of the\r\nallowance, and eleven against any grant at all.]\r\n\r\n    'I visited Newcastle, and there spoke chiefly upon the Dowry question,\r\n    which had led to a division in the House of Commons, in which the\r\n    minority had consisted of but three persons, with two tellers.... But\r\n    in the course of the recess I had gone into the question of the Civil\r\n    List expenditure upon the Court, and at Newcastle I made references to\r\n    this subject which were accurate, though possibly unwise.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen's long retirement (now of ten years' duration) from all\r\nceremonial functions had occasioned considerable discontent. A pamphlet,\r\nunder the title _What does She do with it?_ written, as Sir Charles\r\nbelieved, by one who had been a member of the Government, had received\r\nwide publicity. Sir Charles alluded to this, and, taking up the\r\npamphleteer's argument, drew a picture of royal power as increasing, of\r\nquaint survivals of ancient offices kept up at high cost, and of the\r\narmy's efficiency impaired by the appointment of Royal personages to\r\ncommand. He concluded by a peroration on the model State, inspired, one\r\nfancies, not only by his early training, but by Vacation reading of that\r\nlong series of Utopias and \"Commonwealths ideal and actual,\" the\r\nrecollection of which fascinated him to the end: [Footnote: Chapter V., p.\r\n55.]\r\n\r\n    \"It is said that some day a commonwealth will be our government. Now,\r\n    history and experience show that you cannot have a republic unless you\r\n    possess at the same time the republican virtues. But you answer: Have\r\n    we not public spirit? Have we not the practice of self-government? Are\r\n    not we gaining general education? Well, if you can show me a fair\r\n    chance that a republic here will be free from the political corruption\r\n    that hangs about the monarchy, I say, for my part--and I believe that\r\n    the middle classes in general will say--let it come.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the abstract avowal of a theoretical preference, which Sir\r\nCharles expressed with greater clearness and decision than others who\r\nprofessed it--than Fawcett, who preached Republicanism at Cambridge, or\r\nthan Chamberlain; whose attitude is sufficiently indicated by the letter\r\nwhich he wrote to Dilke on seeing the very violent leader with which the\r\n_Times_ greeted the Newcastle speech:\r\n\r\n    \"I am glad to see that you have raised the Philistine indignation of\r\n    the _Times_ by your speech at Newcastle, which, as well as that at\r\n    Manchester, I have read with interest and agreement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Going on beyond my utterances, or indeed my belief, Chamberlain\r\n    added:\r\n\r\n    '\"The Republic must come, and at the rate at which we are moving it\r\n    will come in our generation. The greater is the necessity for\r\n    discussing its conditions beforehand, and for a clear recognition of\r\n    what we may lose as well as what we shall gain.\"'\r\n\r\nThe essence of Republicanism to Sir Charles was equality of opportunity\r\nfor all citizens in a well-ordered State.\r\n\r\nHis theoretical avowal of Republicanism was seized upon by all who were\r\noffended by his lack of deference in dealing with a matter so nearly\r\nconnected with Royalty. Charges of treason were made against the member of\r\nParliament who, in defiance of his oath of allegiance, proposed to\r\noverthrow the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThis general outcry did not begin till the _Times_ leader had circulated\r\nfor a few days. But within a week the whole Press had broken out in fury.\r\nThe London correspondent of the _New York Tribune_ reported that \"Sir\r\nCharles Dilke's speech competes with the Tichborne trial\" as a subject of\r\npublic comment. There was a second article in the _Times_ The _Spectator_\r\nimputed to Dilke a want both of sense and decency, and declared that he\r\n\"talked sheer vulgar nonsense and discourteous rubbish in order to mislead\r\nhis audience.\" But as the correspondent of the _New York Tribune_ said:\r\n\"No one proved or attempted to prove that Sir Charles Dilke had misstated\r\nfacts.\"\r\n\r\n'On one point, and on one point only, had I any reason to think that I was\r\nwrong--namely, upon the Queen's Income Tax.' No documents existed, and\r\ninformation was promised to Sir Charles by Mr. W. E. Baxter, Secretary to\r\nthe Treasury, 'but when he applied for it he was told that it could not be\r\ngiven unless Mr. Gladstone agreed, and on this Mr. Gladstone wrote one of\r\nhis most mysterious letters, and I never really believed that the matter\r\nwas cleared up.'\r\n\r\nIn December, when the Prince of Wales was brought to the extremity of\r\ndanger by grave illness, an outburst of loyalty was aroused which shaped\r\nitself into a protest against the \"republican\" demonstrations. But in the\r\nhearts of thousands of working men who had expected some great change from\r\nthe Reform Act of 1868 and found no real alteration, there was a deep\r\nresentment against the power and the attitude of the upper classes; and\r\nagainst this power Sir Charles had struck a blow. The Press campaign\r\nagainst him had the result which always follows when popular clamour seeks\r\nto brand a strong man for an act of moral courage--it made him notable. He\r\nwas at a crisis in his political career, and the risks were great.\r\nOpposition to him in Chelsea was threatened from orthodox Liberalism. A\r\nletter from Labouchere warned him of this, and of the support which such\r\nopposition would assuredly receive from Government organizers. Dilke went\r\nstraight ahead. It happened that the projected campaign on Representation\r\nhad pledged him to a series of speeches, and he did not therefore need to\r\nseek occasions.\r\n\r\nHis next appearance on a public platform after the Newcastle meeting was\r\nfixed for November 20th at Bristol, and opposition was promptly\r\nthreatened, somewhat to the surprise of Professor F. W. Newman, who had\r\nbeen asked to take the chair.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not read the papers daily\" (the Professor wrote), \"and was quite\r\n    unaware that any animosity against Sir Charles Dilke existed among the\r\n    Bristol Liberals. But I think it is high time that the Liberal party\r\n    everywhere be pulled out of the grooves of routine, and that _new men_\r\n    take the lead of it. I hope there will not be a mere noisy\r\n    disturbance, but I will try to do my duty in any case.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a noisy disturbance, but at Leeds on November 23rd the chairman\r\nof the meeting was Alderman Carter, a Radical member of Parliament, of\r\nconsiderable local influence, and an immense hall was packed by 5,000\r\nsupporters who secured the speaker from any interruption. Under these\r\nconditions, Sir Charles delivered a speech much better, in his own\r\nopinion, than the Newcastle discourse. As he put it many years later, the\r\nformer was on the cost of the Crown, the second a defence of the right of\r\nfree speech in the discussion of the cost of the Crown. [Footnote: Private\r\nletter to the Editor of _Reynolds's Newspaper_, June 23rd, 1894.]\r\n\r\nA main part of his defence was devoted to one point on which throughout\r\nall this controversy he showed himself sensitive. \"I care nothing,\" he\r\nsaid at Leeds, \"for the ridiculous cry of 'treason,' but I do care a great\r\ndeal for a charge of having used discourteous words towards the Queen;\"\r\nand he went on to explain by citation of his speech that 'the\r\nmalversation, if there was one,' had been charged, not against the Queen,\r\nbut against the neglect of her Ministers. He added now that the \"breach of\r\nthe spirit of the Civil List Act,\" in allowing the savings to accumulate,\r\nwas one for which neither the present Government nor the Opposition were\r\nresponsible so much as their predecessors; and he made it doubly clear\r\nthat, although he desired to see savings made for the public, his true\r\nobjection to the office of Hereditary Grand Falconer and other sinecures\r\nwas 'not on account of the money that they cost, but on account of the\r\nmiserable political and moral tone which was set by their retention.'\r\nAsserting that the Duke of Edinburgh had been appointed to an independent\r\nnaval command without the training which other officers would have\r\nundergone, he reverted to the ideal of the model State:\r\n\r\n    \"To say these things is not to condemn the monarchy, because they are\r\n    no necessary part of the monarchy, although the opposite idea--that of\r\n    promotion by merit alone and of the non-recognition of any claims\r\n    founded upon birth--is commonly accepted as republican. I care not\r\n    whether you call it republican or whether you do not, but I say that\r\n    it is the only principle upon which, if we are to keep our place among\r\n    the nations, we can for the future act.\"\r\n\r\n    'Not only was the Leeds meeting a success, but so also was one at\r\n    Middlesboro' a few days later than that at Leeds. But on November\r\n    30th, when I attempted to address a meeting at Bolton under the\r\n    auspices of the local leaders of the Liberal party, such as Mr. Cross\r\n    [Footnote: Eventually the chairman named withdrew his support in view\r\n    of the agitation; and the Liberal Association (on the casting vote of\r\n    their Chairman, Mr. J. K. Cross) decided to refuse sanction to the\r\n    meeting.] (afterwards Under Secretary of State for India), Mr. Mellor,\r\n    and Mr. Haslam, there was a fearful riot, at which a man was killed\r\n    and a great number of persons injured by iron nuts and bars being\r\n    thrown in through the windows by the Tory roughs outside the hall.'\r\n    [Footnote: Eight of the party who broke up the meeting were put on\r\n    their trial, and Serjeant Ballantine, who defended, made such play\r\n    with \"Citizen\" Dilke's unpopular opinions that \"most of the jury felt\r\n    that, as loyal men, they were bound to acquit the prisoners.\" Mr.\r\n    George Harwood, the late member for Bolton, related in a letter of\r\n    1911 what he saw as \"an indifferent young fellow\" who had \"strolled\r\n    down to look on.\" \"The crowd\" he writes, \"was very thick and very\r\n    fierce, having declared that Sir Charles should not get away alive;\r\n    but when the excitement was hottest, Sir Charles came out of the main\r\n    door and stood quietly in sight of all, then struck a match and lit\r\n    his cigar, and walked unguarded and unaccompanied through the thickest\r\n    part of the crowd. His cool courage quite took everyone's breath away,\r\n    so not a sound was uttered.\"]\r\n\r\nOne passage in the speech is notable in view of later events: \"I think\r\nworking men should not make themselves too much the slaves of any\r\npolitical party, but should take care of the means of seeking\r\nrepresentation in Parliament, and when they have got the means in their\r\nhands, they will then be able to use them so as to be favourable to their\r\ninterests as a whole.\"\r\n\r\n    'My speech at Newcastle had been not only as true as Gospel, but a\r\n    speech which, as Americans would say, \"wanted making.\" But I was\r\n    nearly subjected to physical martyrdom for it at Bolton, and was\r\n    actually and really subjected to moral martyrdom for a time. The thing\r\n    was not, however, wholly painful. It had its ludicrous side. The then\r\n    Lord Chelsea, for example, afterwards my friend Lord Cadogan,\r\n    regretted, in a discourse at Bath with regard to my speech, \"that the\r\n    days of duelling were over.\"'\r\n\r\nThe Memoir goes on to note that Lord Chelsea and Sir Alfred Slade, the\r\nReceiver-General of Inland Revenue--\r\n\r\n    'who had both accused me of inventing \"lies,\" afterwards asked to be\r\n    introduced to me and were very civil, and I, for political and local\r\n    reasons, had to forget their speeches and to be civil to them.\r\n\r\n    'On December 6th I spoke at Birmingham Town Hall, and Chamberlain, who\r\n    was Mayor, and who was my host, had the whole borough police force\r\n    present or in reserve, and had every interrupter (and there were\r\n    several hundred) carried out singly by two policemen, with a\r\n    Conservative Chief of Police to direct them, after which I delivered\r\n    an extremely humdrum speech to a very dull assembly. [Footnote: He\r\n    spoke on the House of Lords.] Chamberlain was more lively, and made a\r\n    speech in ridicule of Second Chambers, in which I still (1895) agree.\r\n    On the other hand, in Chelsea we carried the war into the enemy's\r\n    camp. The \"loyal inhabitants\" tried to hold a meeting at the Vestry\r\n    Hall to censure me, on which occasion no article or piece of furniture\r\n    larger than a match was left in existence in the room, and the meeting\r\n    concluded with a vote of confidence in me, carried in the dark after\r\n    the gas had been put out. The second attempt was made outside the\r\n    borough, at the Duke of Wellington's Riding School at Knightsbridge,\r\n    but the result was the same. Although the meeting was a ticket\r\n    meeting, the hall was stormed, and the loyal address to the Queen\r\n    captured and carried off in triumph by my friends. It is still (May,\r\n    1905) at the Eleusis Club--the centre for the Radical working men in\r\n    Chelsea.'\r\n\r\nHostility concentrated on Sir Charles because the courage and cogency with\r\nwhich he expounded views shared by many men of standing, and men far\r\nsenior to himself at this time, marked him out for the public as the\r\nleader:\r\n\r\n    'Fawcett had taken a far more active republican line, as had\r\n    Chamberlain, and both of them had joined republican clubs in towns,\r\n    while Fawcett had himself founded one in the University of Cambridge,\r\n    which had but a short existence. I had refused to join these clubs,\r\n    and to work in any way in connection with republican propaganda, but\r\n    it was difficult to get people to understand my position, and the\r\n    perfect legality of holding republican opinions was even denied by\r\n    many, while the wisdom of expressing them was denied by almost all.\r\n    Some thought that I was of opinion that an immense amount of\r\n    revolutionary feeling existed in the country, and that I wished to\r\n    lead a storm to my own profit. Some thought that I was sorry I had\r\n    said what I did.\r\n\r\n    'It never seemed to occur to anyone that there were many persons who\r\n    had been trained up in families republican in sentiment, and that it\r\n    was possible that I should have never been anything but a republican\r\n    without the trace of a \"reason,\" and thought it honest to say so when\r\n    I was charged with Republicanism as with some fearful crime. But to\r\n    think and even to say that monarchy in Western Europe is a somewhat\r\n    cumbersome fiction is not to declare oneself ready to fight against it\r\n    on a barricade. It is only to protest against the silence of many\r\n    being read into agreement with the fulsome nonsense that the majority\r\n    talk about the personal loyalty of the country to the reigning House.\r\n    My Republicanism was, however, with me a matter of education. My\r\n    grandfather was a conservative republican in old age, a radical\r\n    republican in youth, but a republican through life, and, as I have\r\n    said before, my young ideas were my grandfather's ideas. It is a\r\n    mistake to think that republican opinions in England died with\r\n    Algernon Sidney, that Tom Paine was about the only English sympathizer\r\n    with the French Revolution, and Shelley, Landor, and Swinburne only\r\n    three mad poets. It is forgotten now that Burns subscribed to the\r\n    funds of the French Republic, that Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Moore\r\n    all wrote republican odes to it, and that at the beginning of the\r\n    century Southey and Brougham were republican, not to speak of Bentham\r\n    and Godwin and other writers on whose books I had been brought up.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was not only denounced, but boycotted. [Footnote: Shirley\r\nBrooks of _Punch_ wrote in his diary, under date December 5th, 1871:\r\n\"Macmillan asked me to dine, but as Sir C. Dilke, who has been spouting\r\nRepublicanism, was to be one, I would not go, hating to dine with a man\r\nand abuse him in print, as I must do.\" (_Life, Letters, and Diaries of\r\nShirley Brooks_, by G. S. Layard).] He seems for the moment to have had\r\nonly two close friends available in London, Mr. Trevelyan and Lord Edmond\r\nFitzmaurice. The former--\r\n\r\n    'who had been deeply engaged in the anti-dowry agitation, although\r\n    keeping himself in the background ... used to come every Sunday to go\r\n    for walks with me; generally the two of us only, though on one of\r\n    these occasions he brought Wilfrid Lawson, the wit of the public\r\n    platforms, but a dismal man enough in private, [Footnote: Sir\r\n    Charles's friendship with the great Temperance Reformer was cemented\r\n    five years later by his adhesion to the Temperance ranks.\r\n\r\n    'February 4th, 1877, in Paris on my road I received a letter from\r\n    Wilfrid Lawson, who had learnt that I had turned teetotaller. I was as\r\n    a fact teetotaller for some eleven years, from 1874-1885. Lawson's\r\n    letter was in verse with a chorus:\r\n\r\n                    \"Coffee and tea,\r\n                    Coffee and tea,\r\n        Those are the liquors for Lawson and me.\"\r\n\r\n    There was a good deal of chaff of the Bishop of Peterborough in the\r\n    letter, as this Bishop, whose name unfortunately rhymed to \"tea,\" had\r\n    been speaking against Lawson's views in the House of Lords:\r\n\r\n      \"Some day, perhaps, we both bishops may be,\r\n      And both much more sober than Doctor Magee,\r\n      Who finds that he cannot be sober _and_ free;\r\n      But it's only last week that I heard from you, Dilke,\r\n      That you'd rashly and recklessly taken to milk.\r\n      Abandon the habit, I beg and I pray,\r\n      Only think what the scoffers and mockers will say.\r\n      They'll say, with a cynical grin and a laugh,\r\n      'He has taken to milk--just the thing for a calf.'\r\n      Oh, abandon that milk--stick to coffee and tea,\r\n      For those are the liquors for you and for me.\r\n\r\n      _Chorus:_\r\n\r\n                    \"Coffee and tea,\r\n                    Coffee and tea,\r\n        Finest of Mocha and best of Bohea;\r\n                    \"Coffee and tea,\r\n                    Coffee and tea,\r\n        Those are the liquors for Dilke and for me.\"'] while George\r\n    Trevelyan was in private most agreeable.'\r\n\r\nThis social isolation, if it severed Sir Charles from some acquaintances,\r\nrestored to him a friend, Miss Katherine Sheil, who was living in Sloane\r\nStreet with Miss Louisa Courtenay, a near neighbour and old friend of\r\nCharles Dilke. Both Miss Sheil's parents were dead. Her father, who died\r\nwhen she was a baby, had been a Captain in the 89th Foot; her mother came\r\nof an old Devonshire family, the Wises. Although she and Sir Charles had\r\nbeen close friends for about three years, their friendship had broken\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n    For a long time we avoided one another, and I was only forgiven when\r\n    the attacks on me in November, 1871, and the Bolton riot led to an\r\n    expression of sympathy on her part. Miss Courtenay, who knew us both\r\n    extremely well, ... said: \"A very suitable marriage. You are neither\r\n    of you in love with one another, but you will get on admirably\r\n    together.\" Miss Courtenay was, perhaps, at this time not far wrong. I\r\n    had a profound respect for Miss Sheil's talent and a high admiration\r\n    of her charm and beauty, and I think she had more liking than love for\r\n    me. We both of us had a horror of the ordinary forms of wedding\r\n    ceremonies, and we told only five persons in all-my great-uncle, who\r\n    came up to town for the wedding, and was present at it; my brother,\r\n    who was in Russia; my grandmother, who kept house for me, and who was\r\n    present at it; George Trevelyan, [Footnote: 'On January 14th I\r\n    announced to him my intended marriage with Miss Sheil, which was a\r\n    profound secret... but our walks did not come to an end with my\r\n    wedding a fortnight later.' Sir Charles's marriage to Miss Sheil took\r\n    place January 30th, 1872.] and Kitty's maid.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY DILKE (MISS KATHERINE SHEIL)\r\nFrom a photograph by Hills and Saunders]\r\n\r\n    'We did not go far away till Easter. Castelar  [Footnote: 'Easter,\r\n    1870, I spent in Spain. I made the acquaintance of Castelar, then\r\n    Professor of Political Economy in the University of Madrid, and\r\n    probably the first orator in the world--a little man, though not so\r\n    small as Thiers, or my other orator friend, Louis Blanc.'] sent over a\r\n    friend to ask me to go to stay with him in Spain, but when I had been\r\n    in Paris at the end of '71, I had found myself watched by the French\r\n    police, doubtless under the impression that I was helping the English\r\n    Comtists under Harrison in supplying English passports to the\r\n    Communards in hiding to help them to leave France; and I objected to\r\n    return to the Continent till this spy system was at an end.'\r\n    [Footnote: \"Kinglake, dining with Thiers at the close of the Franco-\r\n    German War--the sole Englishman at a dinner to Deputies of the Extreme\r\n    Left--tells how 'among the servants there was a sort of reasoning\r\n    process as to my identity, ending in the conclusion, \"il doit être Sir\r\n    Dilke.\"' Soon the inference was treated as a fact, and in due sequence\r\n    came newspaper paragraphs declaring that the British Ambassador had\r\n    gravely remonstrated with the President for inviting Sir Charles Dilke\r\n    to his table. Then followed articles defending the course taken by the\r\n    President, and so for some time the ball was kept up. The remonstrance\r\n    of the Ambassador was a myth; Lord Lyons was a friend of Sir Charles,\r\n    but the latter was suspect at the time, both in England and France--in\r\n    England for his speeches and motion on the Civil List; in France\r\n    because, with Frederic Harrison, he had helped to get some of the\r\n    French Communards away from France, and the French Government was\r\n    watching him with spies\" (A. W. Kinglake: _a Biographical and Literary\r\n    Study_, by the Rev. W. Tuckwell, p. 114).]\r\n\r\nThis assurance was procured for him by his friend Louis Blanc from\r\nCasimir-Périer, then Minister of the Interior, who wrote by the hand of\r\nhis son, afterwards President of the Republic.\r\n\r\n    'Before I could leave London, I had to meet my constituents, which I\r\n    did with complete success, and to stand the fire of my enemies by\r\n    bringing forward in the House of Commons, on the earliest day that I\r\n    could obtain, a motion on which I should be able to repeat the\r\n    statements of my Newcastle speech, that they might be answered if any\r\n    answer could be given.\r\n\r\n    'I had a rival in this project, a member who had given notice in the\r\n    previous session for a Committee to inquire into the Civil List,\r\n    George Dixon, known at that time in connection with the Education\r\n    League.'\r\n\r\nBut as the day, March 19th, approached, Mr. Dixon wrote to Sir Charles--\r\n\r\n    'saying that his mind had been greatly exercised with regard to the\r\n    motion of which he had given notice, and which had originally been\r\n    suggested to him by Trevelyan, that he had come to the conclusion to\r\n    leave the matter in my hands, but that he thought it one which ought\r\n    to be brought before the House. \"Of course,\" he added, \"I shall go\r\n    into the lobby with you if you divide the House.\" This, however, he\r\n    did not do.'\r\n\r\nNo ordinary moral courage was needed to face the demonstration which had\r\nbeen carefully prepared. The House of Commons has seldom witnessed a\r\nstormier scene.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Charles stood up in a crowded House, charged with that atmosphere\r\nwhich the expectation of a personal incident always engenders there, Lord\r\nBury intervened with an appeal to privilege, and, backed by tempestuous\r\ncheers, asked the Speaker to refuse the member for Chelsea a hearing on\r\nthe ground that by declaration of republican principles he had violated\r\nthe oath of allegiance. When this appeal had been dismissed, Sir Charles,\r\non rising again to address the House, was, in the discreet words of\r\nHansard, \"received with much confusion.\" There was a \"chorus of groans and\r\nOh's and ironical cheers.\" But the House, after a brief demonstration,\r\nsettled down to hear the speaker, who proceeded to set out the grounds on\r\nwhich he asked for full information concerning the Civil List under a\r\nnumber of tabulated heads, \"his object,\" said the London correspondent of\r\nthe New York Tribune, \"clearly being to crowd as many facts as possible\r\ninto a certain amount of time.\" It was, he says himself, 'solid and full\r\nof matter, but studiously wooden, 'unutterably dull,' and 'towards the\r\nlatter part of the speech members went trooping out of the House, and\r\nconversation was general.' At last Sir Charles sat down, and men crowded\r\nin, all agog to hear Mr. Gladstone, who had sat uneasily on his bench,\r\n\"longing to be at him,\" says one reporter; and at him he went, with\r\ntremendous artillery of argument, sarcasm, and declamation, while the\r\nOpposition cheered every point to the echo, though the Liberals sat in\r\nglum silence. Probably many of them shared the feeling which Sir Wilfrid\r\nLawson reflects in his _Reminiscences_, that Mr. Gladstone was \"often most\r\nunfair in debate,\" and on this occasion (not for the first time) \"simply\r\ntried to trample upon Dilke, having the whole House at his back.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister ended with an appeal for the division to be taken at\r\nonce, but Sir Charles's seconder, one of the most picturesque figures in\r\nthe politics of that time, insisted upon claiming his part in the\r\ncondemnation. Not so much Radical as Anarchist, converted from the\r\ntraditional Toryism of his surroundings by the influence of J. S. Mill and\r\nRuskin, Auberon Herbert was at this moment vehemently republican, and\r\nnothing would serve him but to rise and, in supporting this motion purely\r\non the Civil List, to make an avowal of republican principles:\r\n\r\n    'He stood up before a howling House, which had listened quietly to me,\r\n    but was determined to have no more, with remarkable pluck, equal to\r\n    that with which he had faced bullets in the Danish lines; but it was\r\n    partly useless and partly mischievous.'\r\n\r\nWhen clamour failed to silence the speaker, members trooped out, and\r\nattempts were made to count out the House, but unsuccessfully. Thereupon\r\nLord George Hamilton \"spied strangers,\" and the Press having been\r\nexcluded, Tories trooped back and went resolutely to work to howl Herbert\r\ndown. Imitations of the crowing of cocks were said to have been given by\r\nMr. George Bentinck, though Sir Wilfrid Lawson declared that he did not\r\nhear them, and added:\r\n\r\n    \"If there was such a manifestation it was, however, for the last time\r\n    in the House of Commons; therefore I mention it. The division was 276\r\n    against 2--the two consisting of Anderson, one of the Glasgow members,\r\n    and myself. [Footnote: Dilke and Herbert acted as tellers.] I think my\r\n    vote was quite right, for the returns asked for by Dilke were due to\r\n    the country, and Mr. Gladstone did not at all benefit the monarchy by\r\n    withholding them.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the impression which Sir Charles desired to leave on the mind of\r\nRadicals. But he had produced also the effect that he intended on the mind\r\nof the general public. The Press complained\r\n\r\n    'that my speech was voted prosy, and that my want of vivacity tended\r\n    to prevent the interruptions which had been organized, and that it\r\n    would have been impossible to make an oration more mild and\r\n    inoffensive. This was exactly what I had wished and intended....\r\n\r\n    'My speech was left unanswered, and I afterwards had the satisfaction\r\n    of arranging while in office for acting on the principles which I laid\r\n    down, and that action has since been taken. My main point was the\r\n    right of the House of Commons to inquire into the Civil List even\r\n    during the continuance of the reign, a right important because inquiry\r\n    at the beginning of a reign is held under circumstances which prevent\r\n    the possibility of its being satisfactory. This has since been\r\n    admitted by Mr. Gladstone himself, and my view has been acted on. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone professed to answer me at the time, and to do so with much\r\n    vigour, but as a fact he carefully avoided coming to close quarters.\r\n    He stated indignantly that he had not been able to find who were the\r\n    members of the Committee of 1837 who had complained of insufficient\r\n    investigation, to whose complaints I had referred, and he said this as\r\n    though none did complain, although it is notorious that Grote and his\r\n    friends, especially Hawes, did so complain. He maintained that I was\r\n    wrong in saying that the Civil List in the present reign was greater\r\n    than in the last, although I was quoting a Chancellor of the\r\n    Exchequer, and although Mr. Gladstone made his figures support his\r\n    view by including the allowance to Queen Adelaide, while I properly\r\n    excluded both that allowance and the allowance of Prince Albert, as\r\n    these personages were supposed to spend these allowances themselves,\r\n    and not to hand them over to the King or to the Queen Regnant, as the\r\n    case might be. Mr. Gladstone denied the pretended statement by me that\r\n    the annuities to Princes and Princesses in the present reign were\r\n    unprecedented in amount, but I had never named Princes, and I had\r\n    never named amount. What I had said was that the provisions made for\r\n    the Royal children during the reign were unprecedented in character,\r\n    and so they were, as I showed clearly in my speech, and especially the\r\n    allowances to the Princesses. Mr. Gladstone, with regard to the Royal\r\n    savings, declined to go into the Exchequer accounts on the ground that\r\n    I had not given him enough notice. I had given him eight days' notice,\r\n    and he had not asked for any further information than that which I had\r\n    afforded him. He argued that the savings were not great, for £590,000\r\n    had been spent on private allowances and personal pensions, a fact\r\n    which was wholly new to us and not intended by Parliament. He argued\r\n    that there was little to say about sinecures, because none had been\r\n    created during the present reign, a reply which gave the go-by to the\r\n    fact that the old ones continue. Long afterwards, when I was Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's colleague, he recanted a good deal of his doctrine of\r\n    1872, as I shall show. Indeed, in 1889 all the information was given\r\n    to the House which I had asked for and been refused in 1872, and the\r\n    principle was laid down by the Committee on grants to the Royal\r\n    Family, which I had privately suggested in 1880.' [Footnote: See also\r\n    Chapter LIX., which deals with the Committee on the Civil List (Volume\r\n    II., pp. 526, 527).]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of 1872 it was not easy to find a platform on which local\r\nLiberals would be at ease in company with the member for Chelsea. Even\r\nLord Edmond Fitzmaurice hinted that at a meeting held in Wiltshire to\r\npromote the cause of the agricultural labourer, Dilke and Auberon Herbert\r\nwould be better away. But towards the close of the year, when a meeting\r\ndevoted to the same cause was fixed for Exeter Hall, Joseph Arch, its\r\nchief promoter, insisted that Sir Charles should speak, and though the\r\nappointed chairman, Sir Sydney Waterlow, resigned his office, Archbishop\r\nManning and Dr. Jackson, Bishop of London, made no scruple of attending\r\nwhile Dilke's speech was delivered.\r\n\r\n    'It was a dreary speech, and, given the fact that my speaking was\r\n    always monotonous, and that at this time I was trying specially to\r\n    make speeches which no one could call empty noise, and was therefore\r\n    specially and peculiarly heavy, there was something amusing to lovers\r\n    of contrast in that between the stormy heartiness of my reception at\r\n    most of these meetings, and the ineffably dry orations which I\r\n    delivered to them--between cheers of joy when I rose and cheers of\r\n    relief when I sat down.'\r\n\r\nBut courage and resource and knowledge had got their chance. His opponents\r\nhad gone about to make a marked man of Sir Charles Dilke; within six\r\nmonths they had established his position beyond challenge as a man of\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF FIRST MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully faced his opponents in Parliament, and having also got\r\nassurances from the authorities in France that he would not be shadowed,\r\nSir Charles was able to spend the Easter recess with Lady Dilke in Paris:\r\n\r\n    'At Easter we went to Paris and went about a good deal, seeing much of\r\n    Gambetta, of Milner Gibson (who had completely left the world of\r\n    English politics, and lived at Paris except when he was cruising in\r\n    his yacht), Michel Chevalier, and the Franquevilles. We attended\r\n    sittings of the Assembly at Versailles, drove over the battlefields,\r\n    dined with the Louis Blancs to meet Louis's brother, Charles Blanc,\r\n    the critic and great master of style, ... breakfasted with Evarts the\r\n    American lawyer, to meet Caleb Gushing, his colleague on the American\r\n    case on the Alabama claims; met at the Franquevilles' Henri de Pène\r\n    and Robert Mitchell, the Conservative journalists; and saw \"Mignon,\"\r\n    Katie's favourite opera, and \"Rabagas.\" This last famous piece, which\r\n    was being played at the Vaudeville, where it was wonderfully acted,\r\n    had been written during the premiership of Émile Ollivier, but being\r\n    brought out when Ollivier was half forgotten, and when the name of\r\n    Gambetta was in all men's mouths, was supposed by many to have been\r\n    intended as a satire of the tribune, though it is far more applicable\r\n    in every point to Ollivier's career.'\r\n\r\nMany years later Sir Charles was to form a friendship of lifelong duration\r\nwith Louis Napoleon's Minister Ollivier. But from this visit to Paris\r\ndates the beginning of an intimacy between the young English member of\r\nParliament and the leader of French democracy.\r\n\r\nHe had already met Gambetta once in the end of 1871, and to renew this\r\nacquaintance was a special purpose in going to Paris. He had conceived the\r\nplan of writing a history of the nineteenth century. On the origin of the\r\nFranco-German War Gambetta was a high authority, and it was to discuss\r\nthese questions that during this visit he for the first time came to see\r\nSir Charles, who records: 'Had Gambetta to breakfast with us, when he\r\nstayed the whole day talking with me.'\r\n\r\nIn five minutes the two men must have been in touch. Those who knew Sir\r\nCharles knew how his intense geniality of nature, masked sometimes for\r\noutsiders by a slight austerity, his _air boutonné_--as it was described\r\nby those who did not pass the barrier--showed immediately with those to\r\nwhom he was drawn. That _rire enfantin_, described by Challemel-Lacour,\r\nwould burst out at the first quick turn of talk, and he would give his\r\nwhole self, with an almost boyish delight, to the encounter with a nature\r\nwhose superabundant vitality and delight in life, as in Gambetta's case,\r\nequalled his own.\r\n\r\nFor these two the common points of interest were strongly marked. Not only\r\nwas there the kindred geniality of disposition, and the kindred interest\r\nin the history and fortune of France: there was in each an overwhelming\r\nlove of country; strong, indeed, in Gambetta, and in Dilke so strong that\r\nit can best be described in the words of a French friend who, watching\r\nhim, said to Sir Charles's second wife: \"That man is a great patriot, for\r\nwith his whole self he serves his country, never staying to consider how\r\nshe has served him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1872 both men were young: Dilke not yet twenty-nine,\r\nGambetta just thirty-four. But the past of one was crowded with\r\nexperience, and the other had already made history.\r\n\r\nSir Charles here inserts--\r\n\r\n    'a word of the personality of Gambetta, who for a long time was my\r\n    most intimate friend, and for whose memory I have still the deepest\r\n    regard.\r\n\r\n    'It was on All Saints' Day of 1868 that a few republicans had paid a\r\n    fête-of-the-dead visit to the tomb of a Deputy killed on the side of\r\n    the Constitution at the time of the _coup d'état_, and had found it in\r\n    a miserable state. Delescluze (who was two and a half years later to\r\n    meet Baudin's fate, being killed, like him, in a black coat, unarmed,\r\n    on a Paris barricade) communicated with Challemel-Lacour, and a\r\n    subscription for a fitting tomb was started, which soon became an\r\n    imposing manifestation of anti-Bonapartist opinion. [Footnote: The\r\n    need for a fitting tomb is shown by the circumstance of Baudin's death\r\n    and burial. He had gone early in the morning of December 3rd, 1851, to\r\n    help in the construction of a barricade at the point where the Rue\r\n    Ste. Marguerite and the Rue de Cotte meet. Two companies of the line\r\n    arrived from the Bastille and formed an attacking party, and were\r\n    joined by some men in blouses, who cried, on seeing the deputies: \"À\r\n    bas les vingt-cinq francs!\" Baudin, unarmed, standing on the top of\r\n    the barricade, replied: \"Vous allez voir comment on meurt pour vingt-\r\n    cinq francs.\" An attempt to address the soldiers by the\r\n    Constitutionalists failed, and a shot from the barricade was replied\r\n    to by a general volley, and Baudin fell, pierced by three shots. His\r\n    body was taken to the Hôpital Ste. Marguerite, and when claimed by his\r\n    brothers was given up only on condition that it should not be shown to\r\n    the people, but immediately and quietly buried. He was buried on\r\n    December 5th secretly in the cemetery of Montmartre (See _Dictionnaire\r\n    des Parlementaires_, by Robert and Cougny).]\r\n\r\n    'The Government having prosecuted the papers which published the\r\n    subscription lists, Challemel-Lacour caused the selection of Gambetta\r\n    as counsel. He was a young barrister speaking with a strong Southern\r\n    accent, which, however, disappeared when he spoke in public, vulgar in\r\n    language and appearance, one-eyed, of Genoese (possibly Jewish) race,\r\n    full of power. Gambetta made a magnificent speech, which brought him\r\n    at one bound into the front rank among the republican leaders. His\r\n    description of December 2nd was such as had never been excelled even\r\n    by Cicero or by Berryer: \"At that time there grouped themselves around\r\n    a pretender a number of men without talent, without honour, sunk in\r\n    debt and in crime, such as in all ages have been the accomplices of\r\n    arbitrary violence, men of whom one could repeat what Sallust had said\r\n    of the foul mob that surrounded Catiline, what Caesar said himself of\r\n    those who conspired along with him: 'Inevitable dregs of organized\r\n    society.'\" The word Pretender, without adjectives, may seem somewhat\r\n    weak as applied to the Prince President, the head of the band, but\r\n    those who have heard Gambetta alone know the contempt which he could\r\n    throw into his voice in the pronunciation of such a word. Finest of\r\n    all the passages that remain to us of Gambetta's eloquence was one\r\n    near the close of this memorable speech, which began: \"During\r\n    seventeen years you who are the masters of France have never dared to\r\n    keep December 2nd as the national anniversary. That anniversary we\r\n    take as that on which to commemorate the virtues of our dead who died\r\n    that day--\" Here the Advocate Imperial tried to interrupt him so as to\r\n    spoil his peroration, and the written version now printed in his\r\n    speeches differs altogether in language from that which was taken down\r\n    by the shorthand writers at the time, although the idea is exactly the\r\n    same. The two counsel spoke together for some minutes, each trying to\r\n    shout down the other, until Gambetta's tremendous roar had crushed his\r\n    adversary, whereupon, in the middle of his peroration, with a really\r\n    Provençal forgetfulness of his art and subject, Gambetta interposed--\r\n    \"He tried to close my mouth, but I have drowned him\"--and then went\r\n    on.'\r\n\r\nThis picture is made more vivid by the pencillings on Sir Charles's copy\r\nof Daudet's _Numa Roumestan_, where the word \"Gambetta\" is scribbled again\r\nand again opposite passages which describe Numa's wonderful ringing voice,\r\nhis quick supple nature, all things to all men, catching as if by magic\r\nthe very tone and gestures of those with whom he spoke, prodigal as the\r\nsun in greetings and in promises, poured out in a torrent of words, which\r\nseemed \"not to proceed from ideas, but to waken them in his mind by the\r\nmechanical stimulus of their sound, and by certain intonations even\r\nbrought tears into his eyes.\"\r\n\r\n    'My friendship with Gambetta perhaps meant to me something more than\r\n    the friendship of the man. Round him gathered all that was best and\r\n    most hopeful in the state of the young republic. He, more than any\r\n    other individual, had both destroyed the Empire and made new France,\r\n    and to some extent the measure of my liking for the man was my hatred\r\n    of those that he had replaced. Louis Napoleon ... had dynastic ends in\r\n    view.... The Napoleonic legend did not survive Sedan, and that it was\r\n    unable to be revived in the distress which followed the Commune was\r\n    largely owing to the policy and courage of Gambetta.\r\n\r\n    'There is some permanent importance in the discussions as to the\r\n    origin of the war of 1870 which I had with Gambetta at this time; for\r\n    it so happens that I have been able at various periods to discuss with\r\n    the most absolute freedom the history of this period with the five men\r\n    who knew most of it--Bismarck, Émile Ollivier, Gambetta, Nigra, and\r\n    Casa Laigleisia (at that time Rancez), the Spanish diplomatist,\r\n    afterwards three times Spanish Minister in London.\r\n\r\n    'The question which I often discussed with Gambetta, with Ollivier,\r\n    with Nigra, with Rancez, until, in September, 1889, Bismarck's frank\r\n    admissions settled the matter in my mind for good, has been one of the\r\n    most disputed points in modern history. My opinion that Bismarck had\r\n    prepared the war, and had brought about the Hohenzollern candidature\r\n    in order to provoke it, was only strengthened by an article entitled\r\n    \"Who is responsible for the War?\" by \"Scrutator\"--probably from the\r\n    pen of Congreve, the Comtist, who I know was in correspondence with\r\n    the Duc de Gramont. At Easter, 1872, I discussed the matter fully with\r\n    Gambetta, with Rancez, with Klaszco (author of _The Two Chancellors_,\r\n    and secret agent of the Austrian Government), and with Hansen, a Dane,\r\n    and spy of the French Government. Rancez long represented Spain at\r\n    Berlin, and it was he who, under Prim's orders, prepared the\r\n    Hohenzollern candidature. He was then sent to Vienna, as it was wise\r\n    for him to be out of the way when war, brought about by his agency,\r\n    was impending; but he was fetched suddenly to Berlin from Vienna in\r\n    1869, and this was when the thing was settled. The facts are all known\r\n    now.\" [Footnote: Bismarck, _Gedanken und Erinnerungen_, ii., chap,\r\n    xxii., p. 90 (German edition); Benedetti, _Ma Mission en Prusse_,\r\n    chap, vi., pp. 409, 410.] The King of Prussia, on July 13th (1870),\r\n    refused to give assurances for the future, in simple and dignified\r\n    language which meant peace. His telegram to Berlin was one of 200\r\n    words. Bismarck told me, when I was staying with him in September,\r\n    1889, that he was with Moltke and von Roon when it was received by\r\n    them at Berlin, and that he deliberately altered the telegram by\r\n    cutting it down \"from a telegram of 200 words which meant peace into a\r\n    telegram of 20 words which meant war;\" and in this form it was\r\n    placarded throughout North Germany in every village.\r\n\r\n    'I discussed repeatedly with Gambetta the incidents of the Cabinet at\r\n    St. Cloud on the 14th (July, 1870). Gambetta proved to me that on the\r\n    14th the mobilization order was given by the Minister of War, and that\r\n    on the same day the order was itself ordered by the Cabinet to be\r\n    countermanded. The Duc de Gramont has said, with singular confusion,\r\n    that it was decided on the 15th that the orders of the Minister of War\r\n    should not be countermanded, and that the reserves should be called\r\n    out. Ollivier assured me that after a six hours' sitting of the\r\n    Cabinet he had finally left St. Cloud long before that hour at which\r\n    Delord states in his history that the Cabinet again met in the\r\n    presence of the Empress. There was no such sitting of the Cabinet, but\r\n    there may have been a meeting of the Empress, the Duc de Gramont, and\r\n    the Minister of War, and they may have dared to take it upon\r\n    themselves to reverse the decision at which the Cabinet had arrived.\r\n\r\n    'The Duc de Gramont and the Minister of War had been in the minority\r\n    at the Cabinet on the 14th when the Cabinet withdrew the order for the\r\n    mobilization of the reserves, and this minority took it upon itself in\r\n    the night to maintain the order for the calling out of the reserves.\r\n    On the other hand, if there was ground for the impeachment of the Duc\r\n    de Gramont, I am afraid that there was also ground for that of\r\n    Ollivier in his own admissions. The declaration made to the Chambers\r\n    on July 15th states that the reserves were called out on the 14th, and\r\n    Ollivier allowed the decision of his Cabinet, which was his own, to be\r\n    reversed in his own name, apparently with his approval. [Footnote: See\r\n    note on p. 486, and the authorities cited there.]\r\n\r\n    'Bismarck's action in forcing on a war might be justified by his\r\n    probable acquaintance with the engagement of Austria to France that\r\n    she would join her in attacking Prussia in the early spring of 1871;\r\n    but it is a curious fact that he has never, either to me or to anybody\r\n    else, made use of this justification.\r\n\r\n    'Upon all these subjects the papers found in the palaces and published\r\n    by the Government of National Defence had an essential bearing, and\r\n    these I discussed, while they were fresh, with Gambetta and Ollivier.\r\n    The same matters were again before me in the following year (1873),\r\n    when I had the opportunity of attending the Bazaine Court-Martial,\r\n    presided over by the Duc d'Aumale, and of again reading the papers\r\n    found in the Tuileries (including the volume afterwards suppressed) on\r\n    the spot, and while the events related were fresh in men's minds, as\r\n    well as of talking over all doubtful points with my two friends.\r\n\r\n    'Bazaine at the Court-Martial looked only stupid, like a fat old seal,\r\n    utterly unmilitary, and, as the French would say, \"become cow-like.\"\r\n    It was difficult to see in him the man who, however great his crimes\r\n    in Mexico, had at least been a man of the most daring courage and of\r\n    the most overweening ambition. In the suppressed volume of the papers\r\n    of the Imperial family seized at the Tuileries there is a letter from\r\n    General Félix Douay to his brother in which he describes Bazaine's\r\n    attempt to become the Bernadotte of Mexico, and shows how, in order to\r\n    obtain the Mexican throne, he kept up treasonable relations with the\r\n    chiefs of the republican bands which it was his duty to combat. It is\r\n    curious to find the French second-in-command writing to his brother,\r\n    also a General, a letter which, somehow or other, came into the\r\n    possession of the Emperor himself, in which he says: \"It is terrible\r\n    to see a great dignity prostrated in such fashion.... We have to go\r\n    back to Cardinal Dubois to find such an accomplished scoundrel having\r\n    made use of a situation of the highest confidence to sell his country\r\n    and his master.... He will not long escape the infamy to which he is\r\n    consigned by the wishes of all honest men in the army, who are daily\r\n    more and more shocked by the scandal of his personal fortune.\" Colonel\r\n    Boyer was chief of the staff to Bazaine in Mexico, and is mentioned in\r\n    the correspondence between the two Generals Douay as being mixed up in\r\n    these discreditable transactions; and he was afterwards, as General\r\n    Boyer, concerned, it may be remembered, in the Régnier affair at Metz,\r\n    when General Bourbaki was sent out under a pass from the Prussians on\r\n    a fool's errand to the Empress Eugénie, there being some treasonable\r\n    plot behind. This is now (1908) confirmed by the letter of the King of\r\n    Prussia to the Empress Eugénie in the Bernstorff Memoirs.'\r\n\r\nFrom 1872 onwards Sir Charles, in his many passages through Paris,\r\ninvariably met Gambetta, 'and spent as much time with him as possible.' He\r\nwas in this way kept fully informed on French politics by the most\r\npowerful politician in France. As Gambetta's power grew, Dilke's influence\r\ngrew also, until there came a time when the friendship between the two was\r\nof international interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOn returning to London after the Easter recess of 1872, Sir Charles\r\nresumed his political duties in and out of Parliament. The Radical Club,\r\nof which he remained Secretary till he took office in 1880, exercised some\r\nlittle influence in the House of Commons, and was of some value in\r\nbringing men together for the exchange of ideas, but began to present\r\ndifficulties in its working, and soon 'dropped very much into the hands of\r\nFawcett. Fitzmaurice, and myself.'\r\n\r\nApart from weekly attendance at its meetings, Sir Charles did not go out\r\nmuch. 'We were so wrapped up in ourselves,' he says, 'that I have no doubt\r\nwe were spoken of as selfish.' The marriage had resulted in a tie much\r\ncloser than the simple union of two people who would \"get on very well\r\ntogether.\" Lady Dilke was a creature of glowing life. Those who remember\r\nher say that when she entered a room the whole atmosphere seemed to\r\nchange: she was so brilliant, so handsome, so charged with vitality, so\r\neager always in everything.\r\n\r\nFrom this period there were dinners at 76, Sloane Street, twice a week,\r\nand among those who gathered about the Dilkes 'were Harcourt; Kinglake,\r\nthe historian; Stopford Brooke (who had not then left the Church of\r\nEngland), Brookfield, the Queen's chaplain, commonly known as the \"naughty\r\nparson,\" and husband of Thackeray's Amelia, Fitzmaurice; Charles Villiers;\r\nMrs. Procter (widow of Barry Cornwall); Miss Tizy Smith, daughter of\r\nHorace Smith, of _Rejected Addresses_; James (afterwards Sir Henry\r\nJames).' Browning also 'was constantly at the house,' and read there his\r\n\"Red Cotton Nightcap Country\"--'at his own request.' Lord Houghton began\r\nin these days an intimacy which lasted till his death. Of Americans, there\r\nwere Leland (\"Hans Breitmann\") and Mark Twain, and with these are named a\r\nnumber of foreign guests: Émile de Laveleye, the economist; Ricciotti\r\nGaribaldi; Moret, the Spanish Minister.\r\n\r\n    'We used to judge the position of affairs in Spain by whether Moret\r\n    wore or did not wear the Golden Fleece when he came to dinner. When\r\n    Castelar was dictator and the Republic proceeding upon conservative\r\n    lines, the sheep hung prominently at his side. When the Republic was\r\n    federalist and democratic, as was the case from time to time, the\r\n    sheep was left at home in a box.'\r\n\r\nOthers in the list of guests were Taglioni, 'in her youth the famous\r\ndancer, and in her old age Comtesse Gilbert de Voisins, the stupidest and\r\nmost respectable of old dames,' and Ristori, the tragedian, who stayed at\r\nSloane Street 'with her husband, the Marquis Capranica del Grillo, and\r\ntheir lovely daughter Bianca.'\r\n\r\nA novel feature at some of Lady Dilke's evenings was the production of\r\nFrench comedies by M. Brasseur, the celebrated comedian, and father of the\r\nwell-known actor of the present day. At all times in Sir Charles Dilke's\r\nlife his house was a great meeting-place for those who loved and knew\r\nFrance and the French tongue.\r\n\r\nMany painters were among the Chelsea constituents, and in 1868 Rossetti,\r\nhaving been pressed to vote, replied:\r\n\r\n    \"I think if Shakespeare and Michael Angelo were going to the poll, and\r\n    if the one were not opposing the other, and if there were no danger of\r\n    being expected to take an active part in the chairing of either, I\r\n    might prove for once to have enough political electricity to brush a\r\n    vote out of me, like a spark out of a cat's back. But I fear no other\r\n    kind of earthly hero could do it.\"\r\n\r\nAnother constituent was Carlyle, who in 1871 came to Dilke with a memorial\r\nin favour of a Civil List pension for Miss Geraldine Jewsbury. Out of him\r\nalso no vote had been \"brushed\": he had exercised the franchise only once\r\nin his life. Passing through his native village, he had seen a notice that\r\npersons who would pay half a crown could be registered, and he had paid\r\nhis fee and had been registered. He had thought at the time, so he told\r\nSir Charles, that \"heaven and hell hung on that vote,\" but he \"had found\r\nout afterwards that they did not.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of 1872 that Sir Charles carried out one of his\r\ngrandfather's instructions by distributing old Mr. Dilke's books--\r\n\r\n    'in those quarters where I thought they would be useful in the cause\r\n    of historic research, or where they would be best preserved. The\r\n    British Museum had the first choice, and took those of the books\r\n    relating to the Commonwealth, to the Stuarts, to Pope, and to Junius,\r\n    which they had not already on their shelves. [Footnote: 'The Stuart\r\n    papers consisted of the Caryll papers and the Seaforth Mackenzie\r\n    papers, which last were first used by the Marchesa Campana da Cavelli\r\n    in the preparation of a great work on the Stuart documents, in which\r\n    they were fully quoted.'] I then offered the remainder of the Junius\r\n    collection to Chichester Fortescue, at that time President of the\r\n    Board of Trade (afterwards Lord Carlingford), husband of the famous\r\n    Lady Waldegrave, and tenant in consequence of Strawberry Hill, where\r\n    he was reforming Horace Walpole's library.'\r\n\r\nIt was a house at which Sir Charles became very intimate but not till some\r\nyears later. About this time Lady Strachie remembers the interest with\r\nwhich, as a young girl at her aunt's table, she glanced down the row of\r\nguests to catch the profile of 'Citizen Dilke,' who, with his wife, was\r\ndining there for the first time.\r\n\r\nLord Carlingford believed that Francis wrote Junius, a view which old Mr.\r\nDilke opposed.\r\n\r\n    'But Abraham Hayward, who was constantly with him, held anti-\r\n    Franciscan opinions, and he would, I knew, have the full run of the\r\n    books, which I was certain in Fortescue's hands would be carefully\r\n    preserved. My arrangements were not concluded until the end of the\r\n    following year, 1873, when I presented the last of the Pope books and\r\n    all my grandfather's Pope manuscripts to John Murray, the publisher,\r\n    in consequence of his great interest in the new edition.' [Footnote:\r\n    Elwin and Courthope's edition of Pope's works.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Sir Charles Dilke made another arrangement which\r\ntestified to the strength of his brotherly affection. Wentworth Dilke had\r\nleft his personal property in the proportion of two-thirds to the elder\r\nson and one-third to the younger; and had also exercised a power of\r\nappointment which he held by dividing his wife's property in the same way.\r\nCharles Dilke now decided that the shares should be equalized, and secured\r\nthis by handing over one-sixth of his property to Ashton, who was at this\r\ntime in Russia, on a journey of exploration extending over the greater\r\npart of that Empire.\r\n\r\nAbout this time also Sir Charles purchased _Notes and Queries_ for £2,500\r\nfrom its founder, Mr. Thoms, the Librarian of the House of Lords, 'one of\r\nthe dearest old men that ever was worshipped by his friends,' and a\r\ndevoted admirer of old Mr. Dilke. He appointed Dr. Doran to be editor,\r\n\"partly as consolation for having refused him the editorship of the\r\n_Athenaeum_, for which he had asked as an old contributor and as the\r\nyearly acting editor in the 'editor's holiday.'\" But Sir Charles's choice\r\nhad fallen on Mr. Norman MacColl, 'that Scotch Solomon,' as he sometimes\r\ncalled this admirable critic, who conducted the paper for thirty years.\r\n\r\n    'In the autumn we went abroad again, and took a letter of introduction\r\n    to George Sand, for whose talent Katie had a great admiration. We\r\n    missed her at Trouville, but found her afterwards in Paris--an\r\n    interesting person, hideously ugly, but more pleasant than her English\r\n    rival novelist, the other pseudonymous George. They had few points in\r\n    common except that both wrote well and were full of talent of a\r\n    different kind and were equally monstrous, looking like two old\r\n    horses.'\r\n\r\nOf George Eliot's \"talent\" he wrote to Hepworth Dixon in 1866:\r\n\r\n    \"The only fact of which I am at this present very certain ... is that\r\n    Miss Evans is not far from being the best _indirect describer_ of\r\n    character and the wittiest observer of human nature that has lived in\r\n    England since Shakespeare, and I think that there are touches in _Amos\r\n    Barton, Scenes from Clerical Life_, and in the first few chapters of\r\n    _The Mill on the Floss_ quite worthy of Shakespeare himself.\"\r\n\r\nAlso there is reference to a letter quoted in George Eliot's Life which\r\ntells that the year 1873 \"began sweetly\" for her, because \"a beautiful\r\nbouquet with a pretty legend was left at my door by a person who went away\r\nafter ringing.\" 'It was I,' says Sir Charles, 'who left that bouquet and I\r\nwho wrote that legend. It was Katie who prepared the bouquet and asked me\r\nto take it.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAfter the tempestuous scene of March 19th, Sir Charles had remained on the\r\nwhole a silent member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    'I am going to keep quiet till the general election' (he says in a\r\n    letter of May 1st, 1873) 'as the best means of retaining my present\r\n    seat. If I should be turned out, look out for squalls, as I should\r\n    then stand on an extreme platform for every vacancy in the North.'\r\n\r\nThe main objects of the Radical group were, first, extension and\r\nredistribution of the voting power, and, secondly, a universal system of\r\ncompulsory education, controlled by elective school boards. In October of\r\nthis year (1872) Sir Charles and Lady Dilke went down as Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nguests to Birmingham, where Sir Charles spoke on free schools (basing\r\nhimself, as usual, on his observation of other countries) with Mr.\r\nChamberlain in the chair. In November there was a return visit, and Mr.\r\nChamberlain spoke under Dilke's chairmanship at St. James's Hall on\r\nelectoral reform. 'Chamberlain's was the first important speech that he\r\nhad delivered to a London public meeting,' and probably these reciprocal\r\nvisits and chairmanships gave the first general intimation of an alliance\r\nwhich for a dozen years was destined to influence Liberal policy.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1872, Sir Charles 'started a small Electoral Reform\r\nCommittee.' Its purpose was to assist, first, the Bill of Mr. Trevelyan\r\nmaking the qualification for a vote in counties the same as in boroughs,\r\nand, secondly, his own resolution which demanded that seats should be\r\nredistributed in proportion to the number of electors. The outcome was an\r\narrangement under which Mr. Trevelyan substituted for his Bill a\r\nresolution dealing with both matters; and this resolution, moved by him\r\nand seconded by Sir Charles, afforded annually a gauge of the progress\r\nmade, as indicated by the division list.\r\n\r\n'Chamberlain co-operated with me, but was more keen about his own\r\neducation subjects.'\r\n\r\nAt this time the attitude of Sir Charles and his associates towards the\r\nLiberal party was one of detachment bordering on hostility. Chamberlain,\r\nwriting from Birmingham on March 2nd, 1873, noted that the Irish\r\nUniversity Bill was \"going badly in the country, and the Noncons. and\r\nLeaguers in the House ought to have the game in their hands.\" He wished\r\n\"they would have the pluck to tell Mr. Gladstone that they will do nothing\r\nto bolster up a Ministry which will not give satisfactory assurances upon\r\nEnglish education;\" and he wanted Mr. George Dixon to go on with his\r\nresolution in favour of universal free schools and carry it to a division.\r\n\r\n    \"If members do not vote with him, and there is a general election\r\n    soon, they will have a nice little crow to pick with their\r\n    constituents; whereas if there is no division on this issue, all our\r\n    labour during the recess is lost, and our friends are disheartened....\r\n    Viewed _ab extra_, there is no doubt the boldest policy is the best.\r\n    It is probable from what I have seen that the weakest course is best\r\n    suited to the atmosphere of what some people are pleased to call a\r\n    '_reformed_ House of Commons.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the following week the Irish University Bill which was \"going badly in\r\nthe country\" received a new and unexpected stab: Cardinal Cullen denounced\r\nit in a pastoral on March 9th. The debate on the second reading terminated\r\nduring the small hours of March 12th. Government was defeated by three on\r\na division of 284-287. On the 13th Mr. Gladstone's Ministry tendered their\r\nresignations, and the Queen sent for Mr. Disraeli, who declined either to\r\naccept office or to recommend a dissolution. By March 20th it was formally\r\nannounced that the Government would go on, but it went on with power and\r\nprestige greatly diminished.\r\n\r\nOn July 6th Chamberlain wrote to Dilke advocating an \"irreconcilable\r\npolicy,\" and asking for news of any \"fanatics willing to join the Forlorn\r\nHope and help in smashing up that whited sepulchre called the Liberal\r\nparty.\" This letter concluded with an attack on Mr. Bright, who had just\r\njoined the reconstructed Ministry, but whose influence Mr. Chamberlain\r\nthought was \"quite too small to save the Government.\" [Footnote: One cause\r\nof the Government's unpopularity was the attempt of Mr. Ayrton (First\r\nCommissioner of Public Works) to limit the right of public meeting in Hyde\r\nPark, to which there is this allusion: 'In July I was greatly occupied in\r\nthe House of Commons in fighting against Ayrton's Parks Bill. It was at\r\ndinner at my house one night that, in his dry, quiet way, old Kinglake\r\nchirped out, \"For so insignificant a personage Mr. Ayrton is quite the\r\nmost pompous individual that I know.\" Mr. Ayrton's unpopularity was a\r\npowerful cause of Mr. Gladstone's downfall in 1874.'] Sir William\r\nHarcourt, though hardly less discontented, was openly more conformable,\r\nand towards the close of 1873 took office as Solicitor-\r\nGeneral. He wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I do not know if I have done a very wise or a very foolish thing.\r\n    Probably the latter. But it is done, and my friends must help me to\r\n    make the best of it. It was a great inducement to me the having Henry\r\n    James [Footnote: Sir Henry James became Attorney-General in September,\r\n    1873.] as a colleague.... I feel like an old bachelor going to leave\r\n    his lodgings and marry a woman he is not in love with, in grave doubt\r\n    whether he and she will suit. However, fortunately, _she_ is going to\r\n    die soon, and we shall soon again be in opposition below the gangway.\r\n    The Duke of Argyll says that now I am in harness I must be driven in\r\n    blinkers; but, then, dukes are insolent by nature. Whatever comes, I\r\n    shall never leave the House of Commons. I do not see why I am not to\r\n    be a politician because I am a law officer. Law officers used to be\r\n    politicians some years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe Civil List question was raised again in Parliament in this year, when\r\nthe Crown Private Estates Bill was introduced; and an amendment moved by\r\nMr. George Anderson, member for Glasgow, complaining of the secrecy which\r\nattached to Royal wills, was supported, not only by Sir Charles, but by\r\n\"the leader of the old Whigs in the House of Commons,\" Mr. E. P. Bouverie,\r\na Privy Councillor, who to his horror found himself named to tell against\r\nthe Bill, and thus identified with the \"republican\" opposition. 'Speaker\r\nBrand no doubt owed him some grudge.' [Footnote: The Right Hon. E. P.\r\nBouverie had been a very successful Chairman of Committees of the whole\r\nHouse, and was indicated by public option as a probable Speaker. He was\r\nrecognized as a leading authority on the Law of Parliament.] Dilke's own\r\nspeech had demanded the annual publication of the receipts and\r\ndisbursements of the Crown Private Estates, and though he waited long to\r\ncarry his point, he saw this amongst other proposals adopted on the\r\nrecommendation of the Civil List Committee of 1910, on which he served.\r\n\r\nProof was not wanting that his determined attitude on these matters had\r\nwon him the support of great masses of the democracy. Miners' Unions and\r\nLabourers' Unions wrote, begging, some for his portrait, others for an\r\naddress; also, in places where opposition had been offered to his\r\nspeaking, reprisals were exacted.\r\n\r\n    'Early in January, 1873, we went to Derby, at the request of the\r\n    chairman of my meeting at Derby which had failed in the winter of\r\n    '71-72, when, though a majority were upon our side, a gang of hired\r\n    poachers had entrenched themselves in a corner of the room, had burned\r\n    cayenne pepper, and defied all attempts to drive them out. The\r\n    chairman was a man of determination who did not mean to be beaten. He\r\n    organized his meeting on this occasion with almost too much care, for\r\n    I fancy he brought fighting friends from Nottingham and other bruising\r\n    places to it. The Tory roughs appeared, as on the former occasion.\r\n    Before we were allowed to enter the room they were charged by means of\r\n    battering rams with such effect that their entrenchments were\r\n    destroyed, and they themselves were mostly stunned and carried out one\r\n    by one. No one was dangerously hurt, but there were many broken heads.\r\n    Lady Dilke was present in the thick of it, and, according to the\r\n    newspaper reports, anxiously begged the stewards to deal gently with\r\n    those whom they threw out. After this the meeting was held in peace.\r\n    But the result was a formal Government inquiry, and the removal of the\r\n    chairman of the meeting from the County Bench by the Lord Chancellor.\r\n    He turned clergyman, to the benefit of _Notes and Queries_ and of the\r\n    societies for antiquarian research, for, being a man of active mind,\r\n    and finding the care of small parishes of ritualistic tendencies\r\n    insufficient to occupy his whole time, he became the author of the\r\n    famous book, _Churches of Derbyshire_, and of much other antiquarian\r\n    work.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes that this address at Derby was in fact his first\r\npronouncement on \"Free Land.\" In the following week, at Chelsea, he spoke\r\nupon Free Trade, and in both these speeches used the phrase, \"Free land,\r\nfree church, free schools, free trade, free law,\" laying down, early in\r\n1873, 'the principles on which Chamberlain and John Morley afterwards went\r\nin the construction of the pamphlet known as _The Radical Programme_.'\r\n\r\nSir G. Trevelyan writes:\r\n\r\n    \"In the first months of 1872 he was supposed to have injured himself\r\n    greatly by his proceedings with regard to the Civil List; and yet, _to\r\n    my knowledge, within a very few years Mr. Disraeli stated it as his\r\n    opinion that Sir Charles Dilke was the most useful and influential\r\n    member, among quite young men, that he had ever known.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of his plan of \"keeping quiet\" till the impending dissolution,\r\nhe took no prominent action in these months; but he backed independent\r\nLiberalism whenever he saw a chance, as, for instance, by subscribing to\r\nforward the candidature of Mr. Burt, who had then been selected by the\r\nMorpeth miners to represent them. There was, however, a further reason for\r\nthis quiescence. Lady Dilke at the close of the season was seriously ill,\r\nand it was late in autumn before she could be taken abroad to Monaco.\r\nHere, under the associations of the place, Dilke wrote his very successful\r\npolitical fantasy, _Prince Florestan_.\r\n\r\nAnother event which clouded 1873 was Mill's death--'a great loss to us.\r\nOurs was the last house at which he dined, and we, with the Hills' (the\r\neditor of the _Daily News_ and his wife), 'were the last friends who dined\r\nwith him. The Watts portrait for which he had consented to sit was\r\nfinished for me just when he died.'\r\n\r\n'I loved him greatly,' Sir Charles writes. The relation between the two\r\nhad been that of master and disciple, and Mill may be said to have carried\r\non and completed the work of old Mr. Dilke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN STUART MILL.\r\nFrom the painting by G. F. Watts, R.A., in the Westminster Town Hall.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nRE-ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT--DEATH OF LADY DILKE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving remained abroad until after Christmas, 1873, the Dilkes stayed at\r\nBrighton for the sake of Lady Dilke's health, Sir Charles coming to town\r\nas occasion needed.\r\n\r\nHis address to his constituents in 1874 assumed a special character in\r\nview of the approaching dissolution. He reviewed the whole work done by\r\nthe 'Householder Parliament,' and more particularly the part taken in it\r\nby the members for Chelsea. It was an independent speech, making it quite\r\nclear that from the introduction of the Education Bill in 1870 the speaker\r\nhad \"ceased to be a steady supporter of the Government,\" and showing that\r\n\"during the past three years the present Government had been declining in\r\npublic esteem.\" Sir Charles recalled the various matters on which he had\r\ncriticized their action, laying emphasis on two points. One was the Act of\r\n1871 for amending the Criminal Law in regard to combinations of workmen,\r\nwhich had been passed in response to a long and vehement demand that the\r\nposition of Trade Unions should be regularized. The amending Act had\r\nreally left the Unions worse off than before: \"the weapon of the men is\r\npicketing, and the weapon of the master is the black list. The picketing\r\nis practically prohibited by this Bill, and the black list is left\r\nuntouched.\" [Footnote: See \"Labour,\" Chapter LII. (Volume II., pp. 342-\r\n367).]\r\n\r\nThe other matter of interest was the Irish Peace Preservation Bill of\r\n1873, a Bill which, as he said, would have raised great outcry if applied\r\nto an English district; yet, 'because it applied only to Ireland, and the\r\nIrish were unpopular and were supposed to be an unaccountable people\r\ndifferent from all others,' it had passed with small opposition. He could\r\nnot understand 'how those who shuddered at arbitrary arrests in Poland,\r\nand who ridiculed the gagging of the Press in France, could permit the\r\npassing of a law for Ireland which gave absolute powers of arrest and of\r\nsuppression of newspapers to the Lord-Lieutenant.'\r\n\r\nIreland has frequently afforded a test of the thoroughness of Liberal\r\nprinciples, and Sir Charles was distinguished from most of his countrymen\r\nby a refusal to impose geographical limitations on his notions of logic or\r\nof conduct. He was the least insular of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nIn this speech of January, 1874, printed for circulation to the electors,\r\nhe went very fully into the matter of the Civil List controversy, but did\r\nnot touch his avowal of republican principles, because that declaration\r\nhad been made outside Parliament, and he had never spoken of it in\r\nParliament. He dealt with the matter, however, in a letter written to one\r\nof his supporters for general publication:\r\n\r\n    \"You ask me whether you are not justified in saying that I have always\r\n    declined to take part in a republican agitation. That is so. I have\r\n    repeatedly declined to do so; I have declined to attend republican\r\n    meetings and I have abstained from subscribing to republican funds. I\r\n    also refused to join the Republican Club formed at Cambridge\r\n    University, though I am far from wishing to cast a slur on those\r\n    Liberal politicians--Professor Fawcett and others--who did join it.\r\n    The view I took was that I had no right to make use of my position as\r\n    a member of the House of Commons, gained largely by the votes of those\r\n    who are not even theoretical republicans, to push on an English\r\n    republican movement. On the other hand, when denounced in a\r\n    Conservative paper as a 'republican,' as though that were a term of\r\n    abuse, I felt bound as an honest man to say I was one. But I am not a\r\n    'republican member' or a 'republican candidate,' any more than Mr.\r\n    Gordon\" (his opponent) \"is a monarchical candidate, because there is\r\n    neither Republican party nor Monarchical party in the English\r\n    Parliament. I said at Glasgow two years ago: 'The majority of the\r\n    people of Great Britain believe that the reforms they desire are\r\n    compatible with the monarchic form of government,' and this I believe\r\n    now as then.\"\r\n\r\n    'At the time when the letter was written,' notes the Memoir, 'an\r\n    immediate dissolution of Parliament was not expected, but it was only\r\n    just in time (being dated January 20th) to be of the most use, for the\r\n    sudden dissolution occurred four days after its publication. The word\r\n    \"sudden\" hardly perhaps, at this distance of time, conveys an\r\n    impression of the extraordinary nature of the event.'\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet's decision to dissolve, arising out of difficulties on the\r\nBudget, was announced on January 24th. By February 16th the elections were\r\nover, and Mr. Gladstone's Government had resigned, the Tories having come\r\nback with a solid majority. It was an overthrow for the Liberal party, but\r\nSir Charles survived triumphantly, though ten seats in London were lost to\r\nMr. Gladstone's following. Mr. Ayrton, the First Commissioner of Works,\r\nagainst whom Sir Charles and his fellow-Radicals had fought fiercely, was\r\nejected from the Tower Hamlets, and never returned to public life. Another\r\nvictim was Sir Charles's former colleague.\r\n\r\n    'To the astonishment of many people, I was returned at the head of the\r\n    poll, the Conservative standing next, and then Sir Henry Hoare, while\r\n    the independent Moderate Liberal who had stood against me and obtained\r\n    the temperance vote, obtained nothing else, and was, at a great\r\n    distance from us, at the bottom of the poll.'\r\n\r\nWhen all the political journalists in England were reviewing, after his\r\ndeath in 1911, the remarkable career that they had watched, some for half\r\na lifetime, one of the veterans among them wrote: [Footnote: The\r\n_Newcastle Daily Chronicle_.]\r\n\r\n    \"_We do not think that Sir Charles Dilke owed a great deal to the\r\n    Liberal party, but we certainly think that the Liberal party owed a\r\n    very great deal to Sir Charles Dilke_. In the dark days of 1874, when\r\n    the party was deeper in the slough of despond than it has ever been\r\n    before or since in our time, it was from the initiative and courage of\r\n    Sir Charles Dilke that salvation came. His work in organizing the\r\n    Liberal forces, especially in the Metropolis, has never received due\r\n    acknowledgment.'\r\n\r\nThe centre of his influence was among those who knew him best--his own\r\nconstituents. 'I had indeed invented a caucus in Chelsea before the first\r\nBirmingham Election Association was started,' he says of his own electoral\r\nmachinery. [Footnote: See Chapter XVII., p. 268.] The Eleusis Club was\r\nknown all over England as a propagandist centre. Here he had no occasion\r\nto explain his speeches at Newcastle or elsewhere. \"We were all\r\nrepublicans down Chelsea way when young Charlie Dilke came among us\r\nfirst,\" said an old supporter. Yet the propaganda emanating from the\r\nEleusis Club was not republican.\r\n\r\nHere and all over the constituency he made innumerable and unreported\r\nspeeches to instruct industrial opinion. He laid under contribution his\r\nwhole store of extraordinary knowledge, suggesting and answering questions\r\ntill no Parliamentary representative in the country was followed by his\r\nsupporters with an attention so informed and discriminating.\r\n\r\n    \"Nothing of the sort had been known since David Urquhart, in the first\r\n    half of the Victorian age, opened his lecture-halls and classrooms\r\n    throughout the world for counter-working Palmerston, and for teaching\r\n    artisans the true inwardness of the Eastern Question.\" [Footnote: Mr.\r\n    T. H. S. Escott, the _New Age_, February 9th, 1911.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles himself gives in the Memoir some sketch of the feelings with\r\nwhich Liberals confronted that rout of Liberalism, and of the steps taken\r\nto repair the disaster.\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt wrote (upon paper which bore the words \"Solicitor-General\"\r\n    with a large \"No longer\" in his handwriting at the top):\r\n\r\n    '\"_Rari nantes in gurgite vasto._ Here we are again.... To tell you\r\n    the truth, I am not sorry. It had to come, and it is as well over. We\r\n    shall get rid of these canting duffers of the party and begin afresh.\r\n    We must all meet again _below_ the gangway. We shall have a nice\r\n    little party, though diminished. I am very sorry about Fawcett, but we\r\n    shall soon get him back again.\"\r\n\r\n    'My first work was to bring back Fawcett, and by negotiations with\r\n    Homer, the Hackney publican (Secretary of the Licensed Victuallers'\r\n    Protection Association), into which I entered because Fawcett's defeat\r\n    had been partly owing to the determined opposition of Sir Wilfrid\r\n    Lawson's friends, who could not forgive his attacks on the direct\r\n    veto, I succeeded in securing him an invitation to contest Hackney,\r\n    where there was an early vacancy. Fitzmaurice and I became\r\n    respectively Chairman and Treasurer of a fund, and we raised more\r\n    money than was needed for paying the whole of Fawcett's expenses, and\r\n    were able to bank a fund in the name of trustees, of whom I was one,\r\n    for his next election.\r\n\r\n    'Fitzmaurice, in accepting my invitation to co-operate with me in this\r\n    matter, said that he had succeeded in discovering a place to which\r\n    posts took two days, \"wherein I can moralize at leisure on the folly\r\n    of the leaders of the Liberal party.\"\r\n\r\n    'When Fawcett returned to the House, he would not let himself be\r\n    introduced by the party Whips; but was introduced by me, in\r\n    conjunction, however, with Playfair, who, besides being one of his\r\n    most intimate political friends, had been for a short time before the\r\n    dissolution a member of the Government. On this occasion Fitzmaurice\r\n    wrote: \"Gladstone, I imagine, is the person least pleased at the\r\n    return of Fawcett, and I should think has been dreaming ever since\r\n    that Bouverie's turn will come next.\" Cowen said in the _Newcastle\r\n    Chronicle_, Fawcett \"contributed as much as any man in the late House\r\n    of Commons to damage the late Government. During the last session he\r\n    voted in favour of the proposals made by Mr. Gladstone's Government\r\n    about 160 times, and he voted against them about 180 times. It always\r\n    struck me that Professor Fawcett's boasted independence partook\r\n    greatly of crotchety awkwardness.\" Fawcett's personal popularity was,\r\n    however, great, not only with the public, but with men who did not\r\n    share his views and saw much of him in private life, such as the\r\n    ordinary Cambridge Dons among whom he lived, and whose prejudices upon\r\n    many points he was continually attacking. Nevertheless he was a\r\n    popular guest.'\r\n\r\nElsewhere, relating how Fawcett disturbed the peace of Mr. Glyn, the\r\nministerial Chief Whip from 1868 onwards. Sir Charles explained that--\r\n\r\n    'when he had some mischief brewing late at night, he used to get one\r\n    of the Junior Whips to give him an arm through the lobby, and as he\r\n    passed the Senior Whip at the door leading to the members' entrance\r\n    would say \"Good-night, Glyn,\" as though he were going home to bed.'\r\n\r\nMr. Glyn thought \"the blind man\" had gone to bed, but in reality he had\r\nsimply passed down to the terrace, and would sit there smoking till the\r\nother conspirators saw the moment to go down and fetch him. 'I fear it was\r\nby this stratagem that he had helped me to defeat Ayrton's Bill for\r\nthrowing a piece of the Park into the Kensington Road opposite the Albert\r\nHall.'\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Dilke was a name of even greater horror to the\r\northodox Whiggish opinion of this date than to the regular adherents of\r\nToryism. The general attitude at this moment towards \"the Republican\"--\r\n\"Citizen Dilke\"--is illustrated by an anecdote in the _Reminiscences of\r\nCharles Gavard_, who was for many years First Secretary at the French\r\nEmbassy. He says that when Sir Charles Dilke stood for Chelsea in 1874, he\r\nattended several of his meetings--\r\n\r\n    \"partly, I must admit, in the spirit of the Englishman who never\r\n    missed a performance of van Amburg, the lion-tamer, hoping some day to\r\n    see him devoured by his lions. On one occasion, at Chelsea Town Hall,\r\n    I had the honour of leading Lady Dilke on to the platform, and was\r\n    greeted, with such a round of applause as I am not likely to enjoy\r\n    again in my life. But, to my horror, I heard the reporters inquiring\r\n    as to my identity. Fortunately, Sir Charles perceived the peril I was\r\n    in, and gave them some misleading information. Otherwise, my name\r\n    might have appeared in the Press, and my diplomatic career have been\r\n    abruptly ended for figuring in public among the supporters of so\r\n    hostile an opponent of the form of government prevailing, in the\r\n    country to which I was accredited.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles's personal triumph at the polls amid the general rout of his\r\nparty inevitably enhanced his position in the House. And upon it there\r\nfollowed a wholly different success which established his prestige\r\nprecisely on the point where it was the fashion to assail it. He had been\r\ndecried as 'dreary'; yet London suddenly found itself applauding him as a\r\nwit.\r\n\r\n_The Fall of Prince Florestan of Monaco_ was published anonymously in\r\nMarch, 1874. To-day the little book is perhaps almost forgotten, although\r\none can still be amused by the story of the Cambridge undergraduate,\r\ntrained in the fullest faith of free-thinking Radicalism, who finds\r\nhimself suddenly promoted to the principality of Monaco, and who arrives\r\nin his microscopic kingdom only to realize that his monarchical state\r\nrests on the support of two pillars--a Jesuit who controls the Church and\r\neducation, and M. Blanc, who manages the gaming tables. The consequence of\r\nPrince Florestan's attempt to put in practice democratic principles where\r\nnobody wanted them was wittily and ingeniously thought out, and the tone\r\nof subdued irony admirably kept up. The work was characteristically\r\nthorough. The 126 functionaries, the 60 soldiers and carbineers, the 150\r\nunpaid diplomatic representatives of Monaco abroad, the Vicar-General, the\r\nTreasurer-General, the Honorary Almoner, and all the other \"appliances and\r\nexcrescences of civilized government,\" which went to make up that\r\n\"perfection of bureaucracy and red tape in a territory one mile broad and\r\nfive miles long,\" were all statistically accurate. Throughout the whole a\r\nreference to other monarchies and other swarms of functionaries was\r\ndelicately implied.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the book is rather that of talk than of writing. It has the\r\ndash, the quick turn, and the vivacity of a good improvisation at the\r\ndinner-table; and a quotation will illustrate not so much Sir Charles's\r\nliterary gift as the manner of his talk:\r\n\r\n    \"On the 5th of February I reached Nice by the express, and, after\r\n    reading the telegram which announced the return of Mr. Gladstone by a\r\n    discerning people as junior colleague to a gin distiller, was\r\n    presented with an address by the Gambettist mayor at the desire of the\r\n    legitimist préfêt. The mayor, being a red-hot republican in politics,\r\n    but a carriage-builder by trade, lectured me on the drawbacks of\r\n    despotism in his address, but informed me in conversation afterwards\r\n    that he had had the honour of building a Victoria for Prince Charles\r\n    Honoré--which was next door to giving me his business card. The\r\n    address, however, also assumed that the Princes of Monaco were\r\n    suffered only by Providence to exist in order that the trade of Nice,\r\n    the nearest large French town, might thrive.\r\n\r\n    \"In the evening at four we reached the station at Monaco, which was\r\n    decked with the white flags of my ancestors. What a pity, was my\r\n    thought, that M. de Chambord should not be aware that if he would come\r\n    to stay with me at the castle he would live under the white flag to\r\n    which he is so much attached all the days of his life. My reception\r\n    was enthusiastic. The guards, in blue uniforms not unlike the\r\n    Bavarian, but with tall shakos instead of helmets, and similar to that\r\n    which during the stoppage of the train at Nice I had rapidly put on,\r\n    were drawn up in line to the number of thirty-nine--one being in\r\n    hospital with a wart on his thumb, as M. de Payan told me. What an\r\n    admirable centralization that such a detail should be known to every\r\n    member of the administration! Two drummers rolled their drums French\r\n    fashion. In front of the line were four officers, of whom--one fat;\r\n    Baron Imberty; the Vicar-General; and Père Pellico of the Jesuits of\r\n    the Visitation, brother, as I already knew, to the celebrated Italian\r\n    patriot, Silvio Pellico, of dungeon and spider fame.\r\n\r\n    \"'Where is M. Blanc?' I cried to M. de Payan, as we stopped, seeing no\r\n    one not in uniform or robes. \"'M. Blanc,' said M. de Payan severely,\r\n    'though a useful subject to Your Highness, is neither a member of the\r\n    household of Your Highness, a soldier of His army, nor a functionary\r\n    of His Government. M. Blanc is in the crowd outside'\" [Footnote:\r\n    _Prince Florestan_, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles sent the manuscript anonymously to Macmillans, with a\r\nstatement that the work would certainly be a success, and that the author\r\nwould announce himself on the appearance of the second edition. But the\r\nMacmillans, who had published _Greater Britain_, noted that the proposed\r\nlittle book contained several contumelious references to the \"lugubrious\r\nspeeches\" of Sir Charles Dilke and his brother, and refused to have\r\nanything to do with it. To pacify them, Sir Charles, from behind his mask,\r\nhad to excise some of the disagreeable things which he had said about\r\nhimself. Enough was left to convince one egregious London daily paper not\r\nonly that Matthew Arnold was the author, but that the special object of\r\nhis new satire was Sir Charles Dilke, \"a clever young man who fancies that\r\nhis prejudices are ideas, and who, if he had the misfortune to be made\r\nKing, would stir up a revolution in a week.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing that Sir Charles wanted. Fundamentally the book\r\nwas chaff--chaff of other people for their estimate of him. Finding\r\nhimself perpetually under the necessity of explaining that his theoretic\r\npreference for Republicanism would not constrain him to upset a monarchy\r\nwhich happened to suit the nation where it existed, he wrote _Prince\r\nFlorestan_, as though to say: 'This is what you take me for'; and even\r\nwhile it satirized the absurdity of Florestan's court and constitution,\r\nthe book showed that it would be still more absurd to upset even the most\r\nridiculous Government so long as it suited the people governed.\r\n\r\nThe ascription to Matthew Arnold was frequent. The book came out on March\r\n16th, and within forty-eight hours had been reviewed in five leading\r\npapers, and, in all the guessing, no one in print guessed right.\r\n\r\nThe disclosure was made by Lady Dilke, who, entering a friend's drawing-\r\nroom, caused herself to be announced as \"Princess Florestan.\" Newspapers\r\nproclaimed the authorship; a popular edition of the book appeared, with\r\nmalicious extracts from the various reviews that had been written when the\r\nauthorship was unknown; and the result was to make Sir Charles, already\r\nuniversally known, now universally the fashion.\r\n\r\nThough he had faced social ostracism with a courage all the greater in one\r\nwho enjoyed society, he was unaffectedly glad to take his place again. One\r\nshrewd critic wrote that \"Florestan's\" success \"had led some people to\r\ndiscover that they always liked Sir Charles Dilke.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Society\" (the writer went on) \"still bears Sir Charles a grudge, and\r\n    would have voted anything known to be his to be dull--like his\r\n    speeches, as he good-naturedly said of himself. Amused, without\r\n    knowing who amused them, the few fine people who supply views to the\r\n    many fine people in need of them prove not ungrateful.\"\r\n\r\nThe return of a Conservative Government was accompanied by a period of\r\ncomparative inaction on the part of Sir Charles and his friends; and the\r\nactivities of the whole Liberal party were in a measure paralyzed by the\r\nwithdrawal of Mr. Gladstone, not merely from leadership, but almost from\r\nthe Parliamentary arena. Mr. Chamberlain, who had stood for Parliament and\r\nbeen defeated at Sheffield, wrote that he was engaged in purchasing the\r\nBirmingham Gasworks for the Corporation, and did not want to stand again\r\ntill he had finished his mayoralty.'\r\n\r\n    \"It may be well to let the crude attempts at democratic organizations,\r\n    Radical unions, etc., etc., be disposed of before we talk over our\r\n    propositions. I do not think the League will do. We must be a new\r\n    organization, although our experience and acquired information may be\r\n    useful.\"\r\n\r\n    'This was the death-warrant of the Education League, and the birth-\r\n    certificate of the National Liberal Federation, always privately\r\n    called by Chamberlain after the name given to it by his enemies, The\r\n    Caucus.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles himself was mainly occupied in Parliament with pioneer work\r\nfor the extension of the franchise; and by a series of small steps towards\r\nelectoral reform he obtained ultimately, as a private member in\r\nopposition, very considerable results. It was not merely with the right to\r\nvote, but with the opportunity that he concerned himself, and his Bill to\r\nextend the polling hours till 8 p.m., introduced in the session of 1874,\r\nalthough it was opposed by the Government and rejected on a division,\r\nnevertheless became law in a few years, as a measure applying to London\r\nfirst, and then to the whole of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the same session he served on a Committee to inquire into the\r\nadulteration of food, and obtained through a careful watching of the\r\nevidence \"a considerable knowledge of the processes of manufacture, which\r\nwas afterwards useful when I came to be charged with the negotiation of\r\ncommercial treaties.\"\r\n\r\n    'I continued to interest myself in the question of local government,\r\n    until I had shaped my views into the form of proposals which I was\r\n    able to place in a Bill when afterwards at the Local Government Board,\r\n    and to make public in a speech at Halifax in 1885.'\r\n\r\nHe adds: 'In 1874 I voted for Home Rule.' This was always for him a form\r\nof local government in its highest sense.\r\n\r\nHe was strong enough to take up a position of detachment, and from that\r\nvantage-ground he made at Hammersmith, on September 8th, 1874, an\r\ninteresting speech, in which he gave free rein to the ironical mood of\r\nPrince Florestan. The Tories, he said, came into office with at all events\r\na strong list of names: Mr. Disraeli, Lord Cairns and Mr. Gathorne Hardy\r\ncould not easily be matched.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, our chiefs were nowhere. Mr. Gladstone was in the\r\nsulks, and Mr. Forster had been returned by Tory votes at Bradford, than\r\nwhich nothing is more weakening to a Liberal politician. Mr. Cardwell and\r\nMr. Chichester Fortescue had gone to the Whig heaven; and Sir William\r\nHarcourt, whose great abilities were beginning to be recognized, was\r\ndraping himself in the mantle of Lord Palmerston, and looked rather to a\r\ndistant than to an immediate future.\r\n\r\n    \"As though to strengthen the Conservative position, we were at the\r\n    same time on our side called upon to surrender our parliamentary\r\n    liberties as independent members to a triumvirate, composed of Mr.\r\n    Goschen, Lord Hartington, and Mr. Forster--the title of the first\r\n    being founded upon the fact that he was the intimate friend of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, whom the country had just condemned; that of the second,\r\n    that he was a serious Marquis, the son of a highly respectable Duke;\r\n    and that of the third, that he had the confidence of gentlemen who sat\r\n    upon the other side of the House. Believing, as we did, that Mr.\r\n    Disraeli never made mistakes, it was not easy to foresee the end of\r\n    his administration.\r\n\r\n    \"When people talked about the extinction of the Whigs, it certainly\r\n    then seemed, on the contrary, that that party, instead of being\r\n    extinct, had become all-embracing, for one knew nobody who was not a\r\n    Whig. With a Whig Government in office under Mr. Disraeli, and a\r\n    disorganized Whig opposition on the other side, there seemed to be in\r\n    question only persons, and not principles. At the Same time, many\r\n    Liberals thought that it would be better, as far as principles went,\r\n    to keep the Conservatives in office, inasmuch as they possessed a\r\n    majority in the House of Lords, and, being forced by the House of\r\n    Commons and the country into passing Whig measures, would have to\r\n    carry them through both Houses and into law, instead of dropping them\r\n    halfway, as our people had often been compelled to do.\"\r\n\r\nIn this speech he assailed Mr. Disraeli's Government for legislation which\r\nlaid restrictions only on \"the poor and the lower middle classes, and\r\nwhich put down a servants' betting club, though it had precisely the same\r\nrules as prevail at Tattersall's.\" The Friendly Societies Bill, again,\r\nseemed to him \"harassing,\" and drawn on the assumption that working men\r\nhave not sense enough to investigate for themselves the position of the\r\nsociety which they wish to join.\r\n\r\n    \"There cannot be too little interference with the great self-governed\r\n    popular Societies. I think that this Bill is the thin end of the\r\n    wedge, that espionage is the first step to control, and that control\r\n    is a long step on the road which leads to the destruction of the\r\n    Societies, and to the creation of a single Government provident\r\n    organization, which I should regard as a great evil.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech attracted much attention, and Sir Charles was now quoted as one\r\nwhom men would wish to see in any Liberal Ministry. In the public field,\r\nduring the spring and summer of 1874, all went well with him. But his\r\npersonal life during these months was overshadowed by approaching\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nLady Dilke was again in ill-health, and was under the presentiment of\r\napproaching death. 'Our last happy time was at Paris at Christmas, 1873,\r\non our way home from Monaco, when Gambetta's brightness was answered by\r\nour own.' Sir Charles occupied himself with buying land at Broadstairs,\r\nwhere the climate was specially favourable to his wife's health, but as\r\nthe plans for building on it progressed, he could note that the keenness\r\nof her interest 'drooped and died.' After the beginning of August there\r\nwere no more dinner-parties, and although those who came to the house--of\r\nwhom Sir William Harcourt was the last to be admitted--found its mistress\r\nwearing a gay face, the gloom deepened over her, and she suffered acutely\r\nfrom insomnia. A child was born in September; she lived to see her son,\r\nthe present Sir Wentworth Dilke, but she never rallied. Death came to her\r\nwith difficulty, early in the night of September 20th. Sir Charles,\r\noverstrained already by long watching, was completely unstrung by the\r\nunlooked-for end of the final and terrible vigil. Having summoned his\r\ngrandmother, Mrs. Chatfield, and asked her to take charge of his house and\r\nson--a charge which she fulfilled till her death--he fled from the scene\r\nof his suffering, and hid himself in Paris, seeing no one, and holding\r\ncommunication with no one.\r\n\r\n    'For about a month I think I did not see a letter. I worked steadily\r\n    at historical work; but I have very little recollection of the time\r\n    (except by looking at the notebooks which contain the work I did), and\r\n    even within a few months afterwards was unable to recall it.'\r\n\r\nAll the letters which poured in speak again and again of Lady Dilke's\r\nradiant charm. Moret, the Spanish Minister, who had been one of the guests\r\nat the last of all her dinner-parties, recalled her as he saw her then,\r\n\"si belle, si bonne, si souriante, que j'éprouvai moi-même le bonheur\r\nqu'elle respirait.\"\r\n\r\n    'The beginning of my friendship with Cardinal Manning was his letter\r\n    to me at this time, in which he said, \"We have met only once, and that\r\n    in public, but it was that meeting which enables me to understand what\r\n    your affliction is now.\"'\r\n\r\nGambetta wrote to him 'a really beautiful letter ':\r\n\r\n    _\"La République Française,_\r\n    \"16, RUE DU CROISSANT,\r\n    \"PARIS,\r\n    \"_le 2 novembre_, 1874.\r\n\r\n    \"MON BIEN CHER AMI,\r\n\r\n    \"Plus que jamais permettez-moi de vous donner ce nom, qui, au milieu\r\n    des terribles épreuves qui vous accablent, n'exprime que bien\r\n    imparfaitement les sentiments de profond attachement, de volontaire\r\n    solidarité que je vous ai voués.\r\n\r\n    \"Je sais, je mesure l'insuffisance amère de toute parole de\r\n    consolation pour d'aussi grandes douleurs, d'aussi irréparables\r\n    pertes. Car même l'impuissance de semblables remèdes qui m'ont empêché\r\n    de vous écrire plutôt, m'ont arrêté dans le désir de venir près de\r\n    vous à un moment aussi lugubre pour votre grand coeur. J'ai cru plus\r\n    digne, plus respectueux de vos angoisses, d'attendre; et je m'en suis\r\n    remis à votre pénétration naturelle pour comprendre et accepter mon\r\n    silence.\r\n\r\n    \"Aujourd'hui je viens vous dire que le plus haut prix que je puisse\r\n    obtenir de notre commune affection serait de pouvoir penser que dans\r\n    la fuite de la vie, je pourrais être assez heureux pour être de\r\n    quelque utilité dans les actes de votre existence.\r\n\r\n    \"Je viendrai vous voir demain mardi à 2 heures et vous répéter de\r\n    vive-voix ce que je dis ici. Je suis tout entier à vous et de coeur,\r\n\r\n    \"Votre ami,\r\n\r\n    \"LÉON GAMBETTA.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Sir Charles met him constantly.\r\n\r\n    'It would have been difficult to find a better companion at such a\r\n    moment than one who was so full of interest in life, about things\r\n    which were absolutely outside my own life, who was surrounded by\r\n    people who could recall to me no circumstances of pain.'\r\n\r\nAfter seeing Gambetta, Sir Charles roused himself to write a reply in the\r\nlast days of October to Sir William Harcourt, whose sympathy had been\r\nexpressed with a rare warmth of kindness, and who caused his son--then a\r\nboy of eleven, [Footnote: Afterwards the Right Hon. Lewis Harcourt,\r\ncreated Viscount at the end of 1916.]--'to write to me about Katie, who\r\nhad been kind to him, which was a pretty thought, and proposed that I\r\nshould go and live with him, which I ultimately did.'\r\n\r\n'Some scraps of polities' were added to they letter, in the hope of\r\nreviving his interest in life; but Sir Charles at this moment was fully\r\ndetermined to resign his seat, feeling himself unable to face old\r\nassociates and associations again. His brother Ashton, now busily and\r\nsuccessfully at work in directing his newspaper, the _Weekly Dispatch_,\r\nbegged him at least to consider his constituents. An election caused by\r\nthe Radical member's retirement would certainly let in a second Tory.\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n    \"For yourself, I really think, my dear boy, that work is the best\r\n    remedy, and though you may not think it now, you could not give it\r\n    up.... It seems selfish to speak of myself, but I should have to give\r\n    up the _Dispatch_, as the thing is too serious for me to go into\r\n    without your advice. Do think it over again, Charlie; there is no\r\n    hurry. I will come next week. We must not make dear Dragon's\r\n    [Footnote: Mrs. Chatfield, their grandmother.] last days unhappy by\r\n    wandering over the world year after year. Remember your child, and\r\n    that you must regard the living as well as the dead. I am sure she\r\n    would never have let you sacrifice your career. Do think it over\r\n    again.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles adds: 'It was, however, Gambetta, I think, that saved me.'\r\n\r\nIn the course of the month (November, 1874) he wrote to his constituents\r\nin reply to a resolution sent by them, but could not promise to take his\r\nseat during the following session, and said that in any event he should\r\nhave for a long time to transact business only by letter. 'From this time\r\nforward I got rapidly better as far as nervousness at meeting people went,\r\nalthough for many months I was completely changed and out of my proper\r\nself.' [Footnote: He, however, began to attend Parliament in the early\r\npart of the session of 1875.]\r\n\r\nHe sought escape in travel, starting suddenly in December for Algeria by\r\nway of Oran, and pushing through the desert as far as Laghouat and the\r\nMzab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nRENEWAL OF ACTIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Algeria Sir Charles reached Paris and crossed to\r\nEngland in the last week of January, 1875.\r\n\r\n    'On reaching London, instead of going to Harcourt's, I had to go\r\n    first to my own house, for I was sickening with disease, and had,\r\n    indeed, a curious very slight attack of smallpox, which passed off,\r\n    however, in about two days, but I had to be isolated for another week.\r\n    When I became what the doctors called well I moved to Harcourt's; but\r\n    my hand still shook, and I had contracted a bad habit of counting the\r\n    beating of my heart, and I was so weak of mind that the slightest act\r\n    of kindness made me cry. To my grandmother and brother I wrote to ask\r\n    them to let me go on living with Harcourt for the present, not because\r\n    I preferred him to them, but because I could not live in my own house,\r\n    and should have a better chance of sleep if I returned elsewhere at\r\n    night from the House of Commons.'\r\n\r\nFrom this prostration he slowly recovered, occupying himself partly in\r\narranging for the publication by Murray of _Papers of a Critic_, which he\r\ndescribes as 'a reprint of some of my grandfather's articles, with a\r\nmemoir of him by myself which I had written while in Paris.'\r\n\r\nThe book was well received, and a copy sent to Mr. Disraeli brought this\r\nacknowledgment:\r\n\r\n    \"2, WHITEHALL GARDENS,\r\n    \"_June 28th_, '75.\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR SIR CHARLES,\r\n\r\n    \"I am obliged to you for sending me your book; I find it agreeable and\r\n    amusing. _Belles Lettres_ are now extremely rare, but, I must confess,\r\n    very refreshing. Your grandfather had a true literary vein, and you\r\n    have done wisely in collecting his papers.\r\n\r\n    \"Very much yours,\r\n\r\n    \"B. DISRAELI.\"\r\n\r\nThis pleasant note was the beginning of an acquaintance, though by a\r\nseries of chances Sir Charles never met the Tory leader outside Parliament\r\ntill Lord Beaconsfield was in the last year of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen coming through Paris he had, 'of course at once' gone to see\r\nGambetta, whom he found 'privately ridiculing the various suggestions made\r\nas to a constitution for his country.' Gambetta suggested as an\r\nalternative that they should allow the National Assembly elected after the\r\nwar--\r\n\r\n    'to continue to govern the country without filling up death vacancies,\r\n    and with the provision that when at last it became reduced to one\r\n    member, he should take any title or give to any person that he pleased\r\n    any title, or adopt any form of government that he should think fit!'\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. John Morley went with an introduction from Sir Charles\r\nto Gambetta, which nearly miscarried.\r\n\r\n    \"I went for two nights\" (he wrote) \"to Gambetta's office (the office\r\n    of the _République Française_), and found him 'not come.' As I would\r\n    not sit up late three nights ... I desisted. Then he wrote me the most\r\n    courteous letter, making a more sensible appointment at his private\r\n    quarters. This I kept. He gave a most gracious and even caressing\r\n    reception, and I was intensely interested in him.\"\r\n\r\nOn this Sir Charles comments: 'Morley was no doubt told by Gambetta's\r\nfaithful secretary to call at \"2 a.m.,\" which was a playful way this old\r\ngentleman had of choking off callers.'\r\n\r\nAs his health became re-established Sir Charles took an increasing part in\r\npolitical life. The independent man is on much better terms with his party\r\nwhen that party is in opposition; his critical faculty is directed against\r\nother men's measures, and if he has force, he easily passes into the\r\nposition of being consulted. The process was the easier in Sir Charles's\r\ncase, because the governing group of the Liberal party in Parliament was\r\nmuch disorganized. A great effort was being made to escape from the\r\nunsatisfactory relations between Liberals and their Front Bench, which a\r\nwitty member had defined by saying that the party sat \"like Scotch\r\ncommunicants trying aspirants for the ministry of their church by their\r\nsermons.\"\r\n\r\n    'Fierce fighting was taking place over the choice of a leader of the\r\n    Liberal party. Up to the day on which there went out the notices for\r\n    the meeting there was the greatest doubt as to the result.... Sir H.\r\n    James reported 'Forster very loyal and quite willing to give way.\r\n    Hartington careless. Mundella, Fawcett, and Trevelyan working hard for\r\n    Forster, but Adam\" (the Chief Whip) \"says the great bulk of our men\r\n    all for Hartington. Richard very strong against Forster, and he\r\n    represents a great many Nonconformists. Adam says Fawcett is going to\r\n    Birmingham to-morrow in order to support Forster there, but this I do\r\n    not believe.' James added that he had ventured to say to Adam that as\r\n    far as he knew Harcourt was not disposed to take any part, one way or\r\n    the other, in reference to the matter, which was the case also with\r\n    himself.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles had declined to attend the meeting, but before it took place\r\nthe matter was arranged.\r\n\r\n    'At one moment, after a fiasco by Mr. Bright at Birmingham, it had\r\n    looked as though Forster might win, in spite of Chamberlain and the\r\n    Nonconformists. Although James professed Harcourt's indifference in\r\n    the matter, Harcourt and James were both, as a fact, for Hartington.\r\n    Harcourt had conceived a strong feeling against Fawcett immediately\r\n    before this, in January, for trying to keep Mr. Gladstone as the\r\n    leader, a course to which Harcourt was bitterly opposed....'\r\n\r\nIn these years Sir William Harcourt, then a widower devoted to his one\r\nboy, stood nearer to Sir Charles than any other of his English friends.\r\nDilke wrote to him: \"How little credit you get for your heart! How few\r\npeople know you have one!\"\r\n\r\n    'In this month of February, 1875,' he goes on to say, 'I revived an\r\n    acquaintance which had slumbered for thirteen years, but was destined\r\n    not again to drop.'\r\n\r\nAccount has already been given of Sir Charles's boyish friendship with\r\nEmilia Strong, a brilliant girl three years his elder. In 1861 she had\r\nmarried Mark Pattison, the Rector of Lincoln College, and from that time\r\nonward Dilke, although he had seen something of the famous scholar, her\r\nhusband, had scarcely met Mrs. Pattison, as she seldom came to London, and\r\nhe at that time never went to Oxford. Now, in 1875, she was staying with\r\nher husband in Gower Street, under the roof of Sir Charles Newton, Keeper\r\nof Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, and was gradually\r\nbecoming convalescent after a terrible attack of gout, which had left both\r\nher arms useless for many months. During this time they were strapped to\r\nher sides, and she had to invent a machine to turn over the pages of her\r\nbook. But the bracing influence of her mind on those around her was\r\nunimpaired. In the years which followed, the habit of correspondence grew\r\nup between them, strengthening, until at any important crisis in his\r\npolitical life it became natural to him to consult her or take her into\r\nhis confidence.\r\n\r\nWe have also at this moment reference to the beginnings of an acquaintance\r\nwith a remarkable opponent.\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes that at Easter, 1875, when crossing to France, he met\r\nLord Randolph Churchill, already known to him in the House, who expressed\r\na wish to be presented to Gambetta. The meeting was a success, and\r\nGambetta, delighted with his talk, asked him to breakfast along with\r\nDilke, fixing the hour at noon; but later there came this note:\r\n\r\n    \"MON CHER AMI,\r\n\r\n    \"Je vous prie en grâce de vouloir bien avancer notre déjeuner au Café\r\n    Anglais et de prévenir votre ami de ce petit dérangement.\r\n    L'enterrement d'Edgar Quinet doit avoir lieu à une heure à\r\n    Montparnasse et je ne peux manquer à cette cérémonie. Donc à demain\r\n    lundi 11h au Caf. Anglais.\r\n\r\n    \"Votre toujours dévoué,\r\n\r\n    \"LEON GAMBETTA.\"\r\n\r\nAt the breakfast talk turned naturally on Quinet, the professor and critic\r\nwho was exiled after the _coup d'état_, and whom the Third Republic\r\nwelcomed back to his place on the Extreme Left. This led to mention of the\r\nrecent occasion when Gambetta had \"assisted\" at the funeral of another\r\nfamous Republican exile, Ledru-Rollin, who had died on the last day of\r\n1874. Hereupon--\r\n\r\n    'Randolph turned to Gambetta, and in his most apologetic style, which\r\n    is extremely taking, said: \"_Would_ you mind telling me who Ledru-\r\n    Rollin was?\" Gambetta looked him all up and down, as though to say,\r\n    \"What sort of a politician are you, never to have heard of Ledru-\r\n    Rollin?\" and then broke into a laugh, and replied: \"Ledru-Rollin was a\r\n    republican in the days when there were none, so we were bound to give\r\n    him a first-class funeral.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles adds:\r\n\r\n    'When I was a boy, Hepworth Dixon used to tell a story of how an\r\n    omnibus driver had nudged him one day when he was sitting on the box-\r\n    seat, and pointing out Ledru-Rollin in Oxford Street, had said, \"See\r\n    that gentleman? I have heard say how he once was King of France\"--\r\n    which had been pretty true at the beginning of 1848.'\r\n\r\nAfter the Easter recess 'was the moment of the German war scare' of 1875\r\nin France--\r\n\r\n    'Bourke' (the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs) 'kept me quiet in\r\n    the Commons by keeping me informed. He told me of the Queen's letter\r\n    to the Emperor William the day it went. Gavard, the French Charge\r\n    d'Affaires, told me that England and Russia received official thanks\r\n    from France for preventing war by pressure at Berlin. Peace was not in\r\n    danger.'\r\n\r\nThere is a note referring to conversations held earlier in 1875 with\r\nGambetta, and to other conversations with Bismarck in 1889:\r\n\r\n    'I had heard a rumour that Thiers had signed secret articles of peace\r\n    in addition to the public treaty, and further that in these articles\r\n    there was something about the number of men to be kept under arms by\r\n    France. In the Arnim trial it came out that one of the despatches\r\n    concerned Prussian spies in France in 1872, while two of the\r\n    despatches were \"so secret that they could not be even named or\r\n    catalogued.\" It was thought that these despatches concerned the secret\r\n    articles, and it was sought in this way to explain the efforts made by\r\n    Germany to prevent the fall of Thiers on the ground that he must be\r\n    kept on his legs for fear a different Government would disregard his\r\n    secret articles. Bismarck himself, it should be remembered, spoke of\r\n    the two uncatalogued despatches as \"perhaps decisive of the question\r\n    of peace or war.\" [Footnote: Secret articles of the Versailles and\r\n    Frankfort.]\r\n\r\n    When at Friedrichsruh in September, 1889, [Footnote: This was during\r\n    Sir Charles's visit to Prince Bismarck, described in Chapter L.\r\n    (Volume II.).] as Bismarck was talking very freely about everything\r\n    that was past and gone, I asked him about this, and he said that I\r\n    should agree with him that it was plain that the suggestions as to the\r\n    limit of the number of men had been wrong, inasmuch as France had\r\n    repeatedly increased her forces; but the sudden risk of war between\r\n    France and Germany which arose in 1875, when war was only prevented by\r\n    the interference of the Russian Emperor, has never been adequately\r\n    explained.\r\n\r\nOn this point Sir Charles afterwards pencilled in the margin: 'The\r\nPrussian Staff wanted war; I doubt whether the old German Emperor intended\r\nto permit it.'\r\n\r\nThere follow other references of this year to foreign politics and\r\npoliticians:\r\n\r\n    'Don Alfonso at this moment (January, 1875) had become King of Spain.\r\n    Two years previously Moret told me to a day when Amedeo, whose\r\n    Ambassador in England he then was, would fall; and on Boxing Day of\r\n    1874 in Paris, before I left for Algeria, he recalled to me this\r\n    prophecy, and told me that Serrano would \"bring back\" Alfonso that\r\n    week, and so he did. [Footnote: Marshal Serrano was Minister of War to\r\n    Queen Isabella II., with whom he had great influence. His opposition\r\n    to the illegal prorogation of the Cortes led to his imprisonment, but\r\n    after the revolution of 1868, when Isabella was dethroned and her\r\n    dynasty proscribed, he became Regent of Spain from 1868 to 1871. He\r\n    resigned this power when Amedeo I. entered Madrid, but remained\r\n    President of the Council and Minister of War. On the abdiction of\r\n    Amedeo and proclamation of a Republic he was again at the head of\r\n    affairs until Alfonso II., son of Isabella, was \"brought back.\"]\r\n\r\n    'Sigismund Moret is not only the handsomest and pleasantest of men,\r\n    but about the cleverest; but at this moment his country offered him no\r\n    place, and his friends could only regret that he could find nothing\r\n    better to do than play whist. He afterwards became Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n    'Alfonso was said to be greatly under the influence at this time of\r\n    the Duchesse de Sesto--my old friend of 1860, the Duchesse de Morny,\r\n    lovely of the lovely at that time at Trouville, but afterwards when I\r\n    saw her at La Bourboule, I think in 1881, become much like other\r\n    people, and somewhat weighed down by the responsibility of being the\r\n    mother of that terrible young man \"Le petit Duc.\"\r\n\r\n    'It was about this time that Rochefort, who had escaped from New\r\n    Caledonia with Pascal Grousset (died 1909), came to London, and I saw\r\n    them. I afterwards quarrelled with Rochefort, or rather ceased to see\r\n    him, for I had seen him only this once, because of his behaviour\r\n    towards Gambetta, who had been very good to him.'\r\n\r\nOf Grousset Sir Charles writes:\r\n\r\n    'This handsome youth had in 1868 just become notorious for his grossly\r\n    impertinent and indecent reply to the President of the Tribunal at the\r\n    trial of Prince Peter Bonaparte for shooting Victor Noir. Grousset was\r\n    the principal witness, and when asked the usual first question of\r\n    French law, \"Witness, are you the husband, wife, father, mother, son,\r\n    daughter, brother, sister, ascendant or descendant, or any relation of\r\n    the prisoner?\" replied: \"It is impossible to say; Madame Letitia was\r\n    not particular\"--alluding to the mother of Napoleon the Great.\r\n\r\n    'Grousset had conducted the \"Foreign Affairs\" of the Commune of Paris,\r\n    and had been so polite to the representatives of the Embassies that\r\n    George Sheffield, the private secretary to Lord Lyons, who conducted\r\n    British affairs at Paris, used to declare that of all the many French\r\n    Governments he had known the Commune was the only one that knew how to\r\n    behave itself in society....'\r\n\r\nBut this feeling was not universal.\r\n\r\n    'Mrs. Wodehouse (formerly Minnie King, an American beauty, and\r\n    afterwards Lady Anglesey) asked me to breakfast with her to meet\r\n    Grousset.' (She was receiving the refugee at the request of Madame\r\n    Novikoff.)\r\n\r\n    'When her butler, who was an old French gendarme, found who was coming\r\n    to breakfast, he refused to serve, and a hired waiter had to be called\r\n    in, the old man saying that he had had charge of Grousset to convey\r\n    him from Versailles to the hulks before the Communalists had been sent\r\n    to New Caledonia, and that Grousset had been so impertinent to him\r\n    that nothing would induce him to wait upon him as a servant.\r\n\r\n    'This clever boy of all the persons deeply compromised in the Commune\r\n    was, with one exception, the one who made his peace most rapidly with\r\n    French society, and in 1890 he was received by the President of the\r\n    Republic officially as elected Director of the federation of all the\r\n    Gymnastic Societies of France.' [Footnote: It was perhaps on account\r\n    of his youthful appearance that Pascal Grousset was described as a\r\n    boy. He was only two years younger than Sir Charles, and was twenty-\r\n    six at the time of the Commune. He was later, for twenty years, one of\r\n    the Deputies for Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSir Charles in this Session contributed to the gaiety of Parliament by his\r\nmotion upon unreformed Borough Corporations, and, said the newspapers,\r\n\"kept the House of Commons in a roar.\"\r\n\r\n    'But the fact was that the subject was so funny that it was impossible\r\n    to make a speech about it which would not have been amusing, and\r\n    Randolph Churchill, who replied to me, was funnier than I was, though\r\n    he was not equally regardful of the truth.'\r\n\r\n    'One of the Corporations which I had attacked was that of Woodstock,\r\n    and Randolph Churchill brought the Prince of Wales down to the House\r\n    to hear his defence of his constituency. I had said in my speech that\r\n    the Mayor of Woodstock had been lately fined by his own Bench, he\r\n    being a publican, for breaking the law in a house the property of the\r\n    Corporation, and that he had said on that occasion in public court,\r\n    after hearing the evidence of the police: \"I have always had a high\r\n    respect for the police, but in future I shall have none.\" Randolph\r\n    Churchill, answering me, said that I had slightly mistaken the Mayor's\r\n    words, and that what he had really said was: \"I have always had a high\r\n    respect for the police, but in future I shall have _more_.\" After this\r\n    debate was over, Randolph came up to me outside, and said: \"I was\r\n    terrified lest you should have heard anything to-day, but I see you\r\n    have not.\" I said: \"What?\" He said: \"He was fined again yesterday.\"'\r\n\r\nIn the same speech the case of New Romney was described--\"the worst of\r\nall\" the Cinque Ports, where the number of freemen, twenty-one at the\r\npassing of the Reform Act (of 1832), had fallen to eight--\r\n\r\n    \"the only town in England in which six gentlemen elected themselves to\r\n    every office, appointed themselves magistrates, let the whole of the\r\n    valuable town properties exclusively to themselves, audited their own\r\n    accounts, and never showed a balance sheet.\"\r\n\r\nA cartoon in one of the comic papers displayed one selfsame and highly\r\ncomplacent person, first as \"Our Grocer,\" then as \"Our Mayor,\" then as\r\n\"The Gentleman who elects our Mayor,\" \"The Gentleman who disposes of our\r\nPublic Trusts,\" \"The Gentleman who benefits by our Public Trusts, \"and\r\n\"The Committee appointed annually to look into the Accounts of the\r\nGentleman who disposes of our Public Trusts.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of Sir Charles's topics in 1875 was the working of the Ballot Act.\r\n'A dull speech on a dull subject,' it secured, however, the appointment of\r\na Committee to inquire whether secrecy of voting was not menaced by the\r\nform in which ballot papers were issued. But the main object of his\r\nactivity in the field of electoral reform was redistribution, and this\r\nobject was the hardest to attain, because more than 400 members of the\r\nHouse sat for constituencies not numerically entitled to representation.\r\nThe over-represented had a majority of two-thirds in Parliament, and this\r\nwas a tremendous vested interest to assail. Still, the whole Liberal party\r\nwas now committed to the support of his principle.\r\n\r\nThe same general support was given to his Bill 'known as the Allotments\r\nExtension Bill, to provide for the letting to cottagers of lands held for\r\nthe benefit of the poor'--a scheme originally proposed by Mill.\r\n\r\n    'My Parliamentary Session of 1875 was my most successful.\r\n\r\n        'My motion on Ballot Act,\r\n         \"  \"      \"  Unreformed Boroughs,\r\n         \"  \"      \"  Redistribution,\r\n         \"  Bill   \"  Allotments,\r\n    were all four great successes, and so spoken of in all the papers. On\r\n    the first I got my way. On the second I prepared it for next year, and\r\n    on the third and fourth I got the support of the whole Liberal party\r\n    and most of the Press.'\r\n\r\nThere are a good many pleasant stories of what seems to have been a very\r\neasy-going Session of Parliament:\r\n\r\n    'At this time Plimsoll's name was in every mouth, and the only\r\n    formidable opposition in the House was that which he offered to the\r\n    Government in the sailors' name. Old Adderley, afterwards Lord Norton,\r\n    who was at the Board of Trade, assured me, in his solid hatred of the\r\n    man, that when Plimsoll told the House of Commons that he had stopped\r\n    a fearful shipwreck by taking a telegram to the Board of Trade at 3\r\n    a.m., and ringing for the porter and sending it then and there to the\r\n    President's house, Plimsoll had neglected to state that this telegram\r\n    had reached him at five o'clock in the afternoon, and had been kept\r\n    back by him till the middle of the night for the production of a\r\n    sensation....\r\n\r\n    'The other hero of the Session was Major O'Gorman, a hero of four-and-\r\n    twenty stone, who on two occasions at least made the House laugh as\r\n    they never laughed before, nor have laughed since. We used at first to\r\n    lose him at a quarter to twelve each night, as he had to get to the\r\n    Charing Cross Hotel, where he lived on the fourth storey, before the\r\n    lift had gone up for the last time. But later in the Session we\r\n    managed to keep him till 1.15, for he made the brilliant discovery\r\n    that the luggage lift, which just suited him, was available till 1.30.\r\n\r\n    'Some of his finest things are lost in the reports. For example,\r\n    \"Swill the whisky through the streets till the very curs lie\r\n    prostrate,\" and this, which, however, in a weakened form, survives in\r\n    Mr. Lucy's Diary: \"Some men who call themselves my constituents tell\r\n    me that if I oppose this Bill I shall never sit again. Well, _what\r\n    then?_\" (This in a stentorian voice that nearly blew the windows out.)\r\n    \"Athens ostracized Aristides.\"\r\n\r\n    'After midnight a postponed Bill is fixed for the next sitting by the\r\n    words \"This day.\" O'Gorman was opposing and watching such a Bill, and\r\n    shouted out: \"_What_ day?\" \"This day\" was solemnly repeated. Then the\r\n    puzzled Major, looking at the clock, and bowing to the chair, said:\r\n    \"Mr. Speaker, is it yesterday or is it to-morrow?\" I never heard a\r\n    question more difficult of reply under the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nThe best Irish bull uttered within his own hearing was, says Dilke, Sir\r\nPatrick O'Brien's defence of Mr. Gladstone addressed to the Irish\r\nNationalists: \"The right honourable gentleman has done much for our common\r\ncountry. He has broken down the bridges that divided us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWhen the Session was ended, Sir Charles, according to his custom, set out\r\non travel, following a scheme mapped out far ahead. In December, 1874, he\r\nhad written to Miss Kate Field, correspondent of the _New York Tribune_\r\nand a friend of Sir Charles and of his first wife, that he would be in\r\nAmerica in the following September on a journey round the world, and there\r\naccordingly he appeared--'on my way to Japan, China, Java, Singapore, and\r\nthe Straits of Malacca--taking with me as travelling companion my scheme\r\nfor a history of the nineteenth century,' a work projected on such ample\r\nlines that a note of this year sets down 1899 as the probable date of\r\ncompletion, \"if I live so long.\"\r\n\r\nThe record of this journey is to be found in the additional chapters to\r\n_Greater Britain,_ first issued in 1876 as magazine articles, and added to\r\nthe eighth edition in 1885. He saw Japan before the Satsuma rebellion had\r\nbroken out in a last attempt to restore the old feudal regime, and he\r\nstayed in the Tartar General's _yamen_ at Canton, where at gun-fire he and\r\nthe other Europeans in the same house were shut up within barred gates,\r\nonly representatives of the white race among 2,000,000 Chinese. As for the\r\nJapanese, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I'm in love with this country and people.... The theatre is where I\r\n    spend all my time.... There alone can you now see the soldiers in\r\n    masks, ferocious and hairy, with the chain-armour and javelins of\r\n    fifteen years ago. [Footnote: This was written in 1875.] There alone\r\n    can you now see the procession of daimios accompanied by two-sworded\r\n    Samurai, there alone have the true old Japan of the times before this\r\n    cursed 'New Reform Government' arose.\"\r\n\r\n    'My stay at Tokio was at the same moment as that of Shimadzu Suboro,\r\n    the old Satsuma Chief, uncle and adoptive father to the Satsuma\r\n    Princes, and last constitutional light of the Feudal party. The \"great\r\n    Marshal\" Saigo was commanding in chief the forces, and was in the next\r\n    year to head the Satsuma rebellion. The Corean Envoys--tall men, with\r\n    wondrous stars in their hair--were at the capital also, and I met them\r\n    often.'\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Java, where he stayed at the Governor's Palace at\r\nBuitenzorg, charmed him.\r\n\r\nHis journey from the East was very rapid, and January, 1876, saw him back\r\nin England. He was in time to address his constituents as usual before the\r\nopening of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe speech contains what he points out as notable in one who 'so seldom\r\nspoke upon the Irish question'--an attack on the Coercion Bill of the\r\nprevious year. It might be better, he said, to govern Ireland on the\r\nassumption that human nature is much the same everywhere, and Irishmen\r\nunder no special bar of incapacity. A majority of the Irish\r\nrepresentatives were in favour of Home Rule, and \"a reformed dual\r\nconstitution might possibly be devised which would work fairly well.\" This\r\nwas an extreme attitude for those days, and he went on to recommend \"the\r\nimmediate creation of a local elective body, having power to deal with\r\npublic works and the like\"--in short, very much what Mr. Chamberlain\r\nadvocated in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe speech also protested against Lord Carnarvon's policy as Colonial\r\nMinister, \"in sending out Mr. Froude to stump South Africa against the\r\nlocal Ministers of the Crown, which was the beginning of all the frightful\r\nevils which afflicted South African affairs for the next nine years.\"\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Opposition did not escape comment. \"The duty of a\r\nLiberal leader is to follow his party, and this Lord Hartington has done\r\nwith exemplary fidelity and unexampled patience.\" Another phrase noted\r\nthat the Session of 1875 had left its mark on the House of Commons, \"for\r\npillows had been for the first time provided for members who wished to\r\nsleep,\" and the same atmosphere of repose marked the Session of 1876. The\r\nMemoir sketches some Parliamentary operations with which Sir Charles was\r\nconnected:\r\n\r\n    'Early in this session occurred the introduction of the Royal Titles\r\n    Bill, conferring the Imperial title upon the Queen, and I wrote for\r\n    Fawcett a motion for an address to pray the Queen that she would be\r\n    graciously pleased not to assume any addition to her title in respect\r\n    of India other than the title of Queen. When the matter came on for\r\n    discussion Cowen, who had now come into the House for Newcastle, rose\r\n    to make his first speech. He had succeeded his old father, who was a\r\n    Whig in politics and an old fogey in appearance, the son being now an\r\n    ultra-Radical, now a democratic Tory, dressing like a workman, with a\r\n    black comforter round his neck, and the only wideawake hat at that\r\n    time known in the House of Commons. The next day Mr. Disraeli said: \"I\r\n    am told that we are blamed for not having put up a Minister to answer\r\n    Cowen. How could we? I came into the House while he was speaking. I\r\n    saw a little man with one hand in his pocket, and the other arm\r\n    raising and waving uncouthly a clenched fist, making what appeared to\r\n    be a most impassioned oration. But I was in this difficulty. I did not\r\n    understand a word of it. I turned to my colleagues, and found that\r\n    they were in the same position. We could not reply to him; we did not\r\n    understand the tongue in which the speech was delivered.\" Cowen spoke\r\n    with a Newcastle burr so strong that it was not easy to follow his\r\n    words, and it was only by the context that one could guess what he\r\n    meant, when he used, for example, such a word as \"rowing,\" which he\r\n    pronounced \"woane.\"...\r\n\r\n    'I again brought forward my motion with regard to unreformed\r\n    corporations, with fresh illustrations and new jokes, and the second\r\n    edition was voted as popular as the first. Corfe Castle, with the Lord\r\n    High Admiral of the Isle of Purbeck, and a Corporation consisting of\r\n    one person, was a gem. Sir John Holker, who had to deal with the\r\n    question for the Government, and who prepared the Royal Commission\r\n    which sat to consider it in consequence of my motions, laid down some\r\n    law for my information, which I doubted, and thereon showed to\r\n    Harcourt, who said: \"You will find the Attorney-General's law as bad\r\n    as might be expected.\" Holker was personally popular. But he\r\n    certainly, though a great winner of verdicts from juries, was one of\r\n    the dullest men who ever addressed the House of Commons.'\r\n\r\nAlthough Sir Charles was active and, generally speaking, successful during\r\nthis session, on two points he found himself without support. One was his\r\nopposition to the principle of the Bills dealing with the University of\r\nOxford and the University of Cambridge, on both of which he \"took a highly\r\nConservative tone without securing any assistance from Conservative\r\nopinion.\" But a passage in his diary, March, 1877, describes his action\r\nand that of the Liberal party on the \"Universities Bill\" of that year, and\r\nmentions a meeting at which Lord Hartington, Goschen, Harcourt, Fawcett,\r\nand Fitzmaurice were present, and at which 'it was decided to support my\r\namendments to the Bill.' [Footnote: See Appendix, p. 200.]\r\n\r\nHis conservatism in academic matters revealed itself fully in 1878, as did\r\nthat abiding feeling for his old college which characterized every after--\r\nallusion to it or to his University life. The Papal diplomatist, Bishop\r\nBateman, founder of Trinity Hall, was mentioned by Sir Charles with the\r\nrespect due to a patron saint. No traditions were dearer to him than those\r\nof Trinity Hall. Speaking at the College annual dinner, he impressed upon\r\nthe reforming Fellows their obligation, in the college interests, to\r\nretain its exclusive teaching and qualifications for fellowship as laid\r\ndown by its founder, \"for the study of the canon and civil law.\"\r\n[Footnote: A scrap of the menu of the dinner of June 19th, 1878, is\r\npreserved, which shows these toasts: '\"The Lord Chief Justice of England--\r\nproposed by the Master; responded to by the Lord Chief Justice of England,\r\nSir Alexander Cockburn. Fellows and ex-Fellows--proposed by Sir Charles\r\nDilke, Bart., M.P.; responded to by (Fellows) Professor Fawcett, M.P.,\r\n(ex-Fellows) R. Romer, Esq. Our Old Blues and Captains of the T.H. Boat\r\nand Cricket Clubs--Proposed by Leslie Stephen, Esq.\"]\r\n\r\n    \"It is a good thing for a small college that it should not be merely\r\n    one of the herd. It is a bad thing that a small college should be\r\n    driven to teach everything--classics, mathematics, law, theology,\r\n    medicine, and science, physical and moral--for if it teaches so many\r\n    things, of necessity, from its poverty in money and in men, it cannot\r\n    teach all well. A small college can only keep at a high moral and\r\n    social and intellectual level by having a distinguishing note or\r\n    accent. In our dear old House we have already in existence by our\r\n    history and by the Instrument of Foundation that special mark to\r\n    distinguish us from others which the most advanced University\r\n    Reformers clamour to see created as regards each College in the\r\n    University....\r\n\r\n    \"It should keep its distinguishing note, and flourish for another five\r\n    hundred and twenty-eight years, not only in manners, good-fellowship,\r\n    and rowing, but as a school of law.\r\n\r\n    \"In rowing and law it had fallen off, but good-fellowship still\r\n    differentiates the College, and prevents it from surrendering to the\r\n    prevailing tendency to make the colleges in our grand old University\r\n    pale copies of French _lycées_--all cut on one pattern and\r\n    administered by schoolmasters, who will rule over dunces of universal\r\n    acquirements examined to the point of death.\"\r\n\r\nThe other question on which he failed to secure support was his attack on\r\nthe Royal Academy:\r\n\r\n    'What I really wanted was that the Academy should be reminded that\r\n    they obtained their present magnificent site upon conditions which\r\n    have not been observed, and that they ought at least to give a free\r\n    day a week at their exhibition, and give up a portion of their\r\n    privileges against outsiders.'\r\n\r\nBut the attack, as he admits, was not pressed with spirit for he had only\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_ and the _Examiner_ with him in the Press. In the\r\nHouse Lord Elcho [Footnote: Better known as Lord Wemyss, long the\r\nvenerable father of Parliament.] and Mr. George Bentinck 'alone understood\r\nthe question,' and the latter was too intimate with all the Academy\r\nleaders to afford a hope that he would do otherwise than take their side.\r\nSo, feeling his isolation in the matter, Dilke limited himself to moving\r\nfor some papers, which were given.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1876 Sir Charles was well again:\r\n\r\n    'I began this year to stay a great deal at Lady Waldegrave's, both at\r\n    Dudbrook in Essex and at Strawberry Hill; and ultimately I had a room\r\n    at Strawberry Hill, to which I went backwards and forwards as I chose.\r\n    The house was extremely pleasant, and so was Fortescue, and he\r\n    passionately adored his wife, and was afterwards completely broken\r\n    down and almost killed by her death. Fortescue was my friend; but she\r\n    was an excellent hostess, and the house was perfectly pleasant, and\r\n    that in a degree in which no other house of our time has been. The\r\n    other house which was always named as \"the rival establishment,\"\r\n    Holland House, I also knew. Some of the same people went there--\r\n    Abraham Hayward, commonly called the \"Viper,\" and Charles Villiers,\r\n    for example. Lady Waldegrave always made everybody feel at home, which\r\n    Lady Holland did not always do. Those of whom I saw the most this\r\n    year, in addition to the Strawberry Hill people (who were Harcourt,\r\n    James, Ayrton, Villiers, Hayward, Dr. Smith the editor of the\r\n    _Quarterly,_ Henry Reeve the editor of the _Edinburgh,_ the Comte de\r\n    Paris, and the Due d'Aumale), were Lord Houghton and Mrs. Duncan\r\n    Stewart. Lord Houghton never met me without referring to a review of\r\n    his collected works, which appeared in the _Athenaeum_ in the spring,\r\n    and which had cut the old man to the heart' (because it rated his\r\n    poetry on a level with that of Eliza Cook).\r\n\r\n    'One of the most agreeable parties of clever people to which I ever\r\n    went was a luncheon given by Mrs. Stewart, when she was living a few\r\n    doors from me in my street, at which I was the only man, the party\r\n    chiefly consisting of old ladies; indeed, I was by far the youngest\r\n    person present. Besides Mrs. Stewart herself, there were friends, Lady\r\n    Hamilton Gordon, Lady Pollock, Lady Hopetoun, Mrs. Frank Hill, Mrs.\r\n    Oliphant, and Mrs. Lynn Linton--Lady Gordon, a remarkably able woman,\r\n    one of the bedchamber women of the Queen and a great gossip; Lady\r\n    Pollock, slow, but full of theatrical anecdote, being stage-mad, as\r\n    was her husband, old Sir Frederick, the Queen's Remembrancer, father\r\n    of my Cambridge friend Professor Pollock (now Sir Frederick) and of\r\n    Walter Pollock, the editor of the _Saturday Review_. A few days later\r\n    I met Lady Pollock at a great party given by Lord Houghton. Irving was\r\n    coming down the stairs, at the bottom of which we stood, having Mrs.\r\n    Singleton (now, 1894, the Ambassadress, Lady Currie) upon his arm. Old\r\n    Lady Pollock, clutching at my arm, exclaimed: \"Who is that woman with\r\n    Irving?\" To which I answered: \"Mrs. Singleton, author of _Denzil\r\n    Place_--Violet Fane.\" \"She won't do him any harm, will she?\" was the\r\n    embarrassing question by which Lady Pollock replied to me.'\r\n\r\nIn this summer Sir Charles gave dinner-parties which included ladies--'a\r\nplan which I found so uncomfortable for a politician who had only a\r\ngrandmother to entertain them that I dropped it after August, 1876.' His\r\ndinners were always among the pleasantest in London, but till 1886 they\r\nwere only dinners of men.\r\n\r\nOf men friends of this year he specially notes 'Gennadius, the Greek\r\nSecretary, afterwards Minister,' with whom his friendship was lifelong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nA meeting was held at Devonshire House on March 1st, 1877:\r\n\r\n    'There were present, besides Lord Hartington and myself, Lowe,\r\n    Goschen, Harcourt, Fawcett, and Fitzmaurice.--It was decided to\r\n    support Grant Duff in adding the names of Huxley and Max Müller, and\r\n    not to support Fitzmaurice in adding Bryce, but to support him in\r\n    adding Hooker, and Goschen in adding Professor Bartholomew Price to\r\n    the Oxford Commission, and to support Hartington in moving to add Dr.\r\n    Bateson, the Master of John's, to the Cambridge Commission. Bouverie\r\n    was to be proposed by Harcourt, as against Cockburn, for chairman of\r\n    the Cambridge Commission, because we objected to overworked Judges\r\n    being on Commissions. The name of Bradley, afterwards Dean of\r\n    Westminster, was suggested for the Oxford Commission by Lowe, but not\r\n    supported by the meeting, and it was decided to support my amendments\r\n    to the Bill. The Commissions as originally suggested were badly\r\n    composed. The best men suggested were not good--Dr. Bellamy (President\r\n    of St. John's, Oxford), for example, the wealthiest of all college\r\n    officials, a precise, old-fashioned, kind-hearted nonentity, a simple\r\n    tool of more intelligent Conservatives; and Henry Smith, an Irishman\r\n    of the keenest order of intelligence, ready to give an intellectual\r\n    assent to the abstract desirability of the best and highest in all\r\n    things. On another of the names originally suggested I may quote Smith\r\n    himself, for when Dean Burgon's appointment was attacked in the House\r\n    of Commons by me and others, Smith, approaching Lord Salisbury at a\r\n    party, and engaging in conversation upon the matter, said that the\r\n    reasons for appointing him were overwhelming, at which Lord Salisbury\r\n    was greatly pleased; when Henry Smith went on: \"No such Commission\r\n    could possibly be complete without its buffoon.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF THE EASTERN QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Charles at this period of his career was passing from the status of a\r\nformidable independent member to that of a recognized force in his party.\r\nIn May, 1876, he became Chairman of the Elections Committee at the Liberal\r\nCentral Association, and from that time forward up to 1880 'took a very\r\nactive part in connection with the choice of candidates.'@@Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain had been elected for Birmingham. He was lame from gout, and\r\nresented it, saying to Sir Charles 'that it was an illness which should be\r\nexclusively reserved by a just Providence for Tories.' On July 8th, 1876,\r\nhe wrote to Dilke that before coming up to take his seat he had called his\r\nfriends together and settled a programme and general course of action. \"I\r\nthink there is every chance of our Union being productive of useful\r\npractical results, but it is agreed that our arrangements shall remain\r\nstrictly private for the present. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico._\" On August\r\n2nd Sir Charles introduced to Lord Hartington at Devonshire House 'a great\r\nprivate deputation upon the Education Bill from the North Country Liberal\r\nAssociations, which was in fact the first movement by what was afterwards\r\nthe National Liberal Federation.' So the \"Caucus\" began to make itself\r\nfelt in domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes that he 'for the first time began to be summoned to\r\nmeetings respecting the course to be taken by the party.' Here already he\r\nfound that--\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone began, although somewhat ostentatiously proclaiming in\r\n    public the opposite principle, to interfere a good deal in\r\n    Hartington's leadership, and even Harcourt, who only a few months\r\n    before had ridiculed Mr. Gladstone's pretensions in such strong terms,\r\n    on the rare occasions when he was unable to get his way with\r\n    Hartington always now went off to Mr. Gladstone, to try to make use of\r\n    the power of his name.'\r\n\r\n\"Foreign affairs had suddenly risen out of complete obscurity into a\r\nposition in which they overshadowed all other things, and left home\r\npolitics in stagnation.\" [Footnote: Speech at Notting Hill, August, 1876.]\r\nThese complications were destined to bring Mr. Gladstone back into an\r\nactivity not merely unimpaired, but redoubled, and to shake the power of\r\nMr. Disraeli to its fall.\r\n\r\nSir Charles was, first and foremost, a \"good European\"; he conceived of\r\nEurope as a body politic, bound in honour to regulate its own members.\r\nIsolation appeared to him a mere abandonment of the duty of civilized\r\npowers to maintain order in the civilized world. Corporate action was to\r\nbe encouraged, because, in most cases, the mere threat of it would suffice\r\neither as between States to prevent wars of aggression, or as between\r\nruler and ruled to assert the ordinary principles of just government.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of this view might involve its support by force of arms,\r\nand he worked all his life for our military preparedness, holding that it\r\nwas the best guarantee that armed intervention would be unnecessary, as it\r\nwas also the best guarantee of our own immunity from attack.\r\n\r\nAt this moment \"foreign affairs\" meant the Eastern Question, in regard to\r\nwhich the future of two nations, Russia and Greece, specially interested\r\nhim. He was notably a Phil-Hellene, who \"dreamed of a new Greece\"--a\r\n\"force of the future instead of a force of the past; a force of trade\r\ninstead of a force of war; European instead of Asiatic; intensely\r\nindependent, democratic, maritime.\" Here, and not in any Slavonic State,\r\ndid he see the rightful successors to the Ottoman dominion. Towards Russia\r\nhis feelings were complex: admiration for the people accompanied\r\ndetestation of the Government, and the unscrupulous power commanding the\r\nservices of so vast and virile a people always appeared in his eyes as a\r\nmenace to civilization. Yet in the future of Russia he \"firmly believed,\"\r\nand he repeats in speech after speech this creed: \"Behind it are ranged\r\nthe forces of the future.\" \"To compare the Russia of to-day to the Russia\r\nthat is to come is to compare chaos to the universe.\" \"If by Russia we\r\nmean the leading Slavonic power, whether a Russia one and indivisible, or\r\na Slavonian confederation, we mean one of the greatest forces of the\r\nfuture.\" [Footnote: Speech at Notting Hill, August, 1876.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles's speeches, taken in conjunction with the diary, give the\r\nstory of these Eastern troubles from the outside as well as from the\r\ninside. His constituents had little excuse for being carried away by\r\npopular cries. In his speech on the last day of the session he advocated\r\nthe sending of a \"strong and efficient man to Constantinople in the name\r\nof the Western Powers to carry out that policy of protection of Christian\r\nsubjects of Turkey which England had intended after the Crimea,\"\r\n[Footnote: _Ibid._] But while condemning with the greatest energy the\r\nTurkish barbarities in Bulgaria, he warned his constituents against\r\noverlooking atrocities committed elsewhere, \"for there was not one pin to\r\nchoose between Circassian ruffians on the one side and Montenegrin\r\nruffians on the other.\" To those who \"were carried away by their belief\r\nthat the conflict was one between the present and the past, and between\r\nChristianity and Islamism, and declared that the Turks must be driven out\r\nof Europe,\" he pointed out the larger questions at stake.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Balkan States, he did not believe in a continuous united\r\nmovement among these \"which would suffice to drive the Mohammedan out of\r\nEurope.\" \"To allow the Russians to interfere openly\" would rouse Austria,\r\na Power which, in spite of the difficulties presented by its internal\r\n\"differences of creed and hostilities of races,\" must in the interests of\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe be \"bolstered up.\" In this instance he urged the need\r\nfor joint action, and laid bare some underlying difficulties awaiting\r\ndiplomacy. It was a situation complicated by the fact that \"this Europe is\r\nprobably mined beneath our feet with secret treaties.\" [Footnote: Sir\r\nCharles notes later: 'Since the accession of George III. the country had\r\nconcluded about forty treaties or separate articles of a secret nature\r\nwhich were not communicated to Parliament at the time of their conclusion,\r\nand in some instances not at all; but these secret engagements were mostly\r\nconcluded in anticipation of war, or during war, and ceased to have effect\r\nwhen war was over.']\r\n\r\nIn his speech of January 15th, 1878, in Kensington, at one of the critical\r\nmoments of the struggle, he told the whole story, which began in August,\r\n1875, when Mr. Disraeli's Government consented \"with reluctance\" to take\r\npart in sending a European Consular Mission to inquire into disturbances\r\noccasioned by Turkish misrule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Great Britain's\r\nreluctance weakened, so Sir Charles thought, the European concert, and the\r\nmission resulted only in delusive promises of reform. In the following\r\nwinter Turkey was increasingly encouraged to lean upon British support in\r\nwithstanding pressure from the other Powers; and in May, 1876, after\r\ndisturbances in Bulgaria had been repressed with appalling ferocity, Mr.\r\nDisraeli's Cabinet positively refused to join in a demand for certain\r\nreforms to be carried out by Turkey under European supervision.\r\n\r\n    'Our Government had refused to sign the Berlin Memorandum on account\r\n    of a reference in it to the possible need of taking \"efficacious\r\n    measures\" to secure good government in Turkey.\r\n\r\n    'But' (commented Sir Charles in 1878, making plain exactly what he\r\n    meant by European intervention) 'it was England who, not shrinking\r\n    from mere words, but herself proposing deeds, had taken a really\r\n    \"efficacious\" part in the \"efficacious measures\" of 1860, when, after\r\n    the massacres in the Lebanon, Europe sent Lord Dufferin to Syria with\r\n    a French armed force--the Powers making that engagement not to accept\r\n    territory which could also have been made in 1876. In 1860 Lord\r\n    Dufferin, in the name of Europe, hanged a guilty Pasha and pacified\r\n    the Lebanon, which to this moment still enjoys, in consequence of\r\n    European intervention, a better government than the rest of Turkey,\r\n    and this with the result of an increase of strength to the Turkish,\r\n    power. Only the obstructiveness of our Government prevented the still\r\n    more easy pacification of the European provinces of Turkey in 1876,\r\n    and caused the present war with all its harm to British trade and all\r\n    its risks to \"British interests.\"' [Footnote: Speech delivered at\r\n    Kensington on January 15th, 1878.]\r\n\r\nHolding these views, Sir Charles encouraged Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice to\r\nplace on the notice paper of the House of Commons a formal resolution of\r\ncensure on the Government for refusing to join in the Berlin Memorandum\r\nwithout making a counter-proposal of their own. It was believed that Mr.\r\nGladstone approved the course indicated, but he was still in retirement,\r\nand not only did Lord Granville and Lord Hartington think that any formal\r\naction in the House would be impolitic, but many of the 'peace-at-any-\r\nprice' Radicals, who regarded Lord Derby's extreme policy of non-\r\nintervention with favour, refused to support the proposed censure. The\r\nresolution accordingly had to be withdrawn, amid the general disapproval,\r\nhowever, of the Liberal Press. Thus the first attempt at action at\r\nonce betrayed a profound cleavage of opinion. This was unfortunately\r\nonly typical of everything which followed in this chapter of events,\r\nthough the debate which took place towards the end of the Session proved\r\nvery damaging to the Government. [Footnote: See _Hansard_, cxlii. 22;\r\n_Life of Gladstone_, ii, 549; _Life of Granville, ii. 166 and 264, where\r\nLord Ampthill, writing in 1882, expresses the opinion that Lord Derby's\r\npolicy was most unfortunate.]\r\n\r\nIt was on May 19th, 1876, that the British Government dated their refusal\r\nto intervene. As early as June, accounts of what had been done in Bulgaria\r\nbegan to appear in the Press. Mr. Disraeli ridiculed them in the House of\r\nCommons, but testimony soon accumulated, and the most important evidence\r\nwas that of Mr. Eugene Schuyler, then attached to the American Legation at\r\nConstantinople. As American Consul at St. Petersburg in 1869-70, he had\r\nbecome acquainted with Sir Charles, and had seen a good deal of him in\r\nLondon during the earlier part of 1875. It was, therefore, to Dilke that\r\nSchuyler wrote his account of the massacres at Batak, based upon his visit\r\nto the spot, which he found still horrible with unburied corpses; and in\r\nAugust, on the last day of the Session, Dilke, addressing his constituents\r\nat Notting Hill, read Schuyler's letter to them.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, 1876, public indignation was set ablaze by Mr.\r\nGladstone's famous pamphlet, which demanded that the Turk should clear out\r\nof Bulgaria, \"bag and baggage.\" On the 14th of the same month Mr. Baring's\r\nofficial report confirmed the Schuyler letter, and on the 21st Lord Derby\r\nsent a despatch, which, says Sir Charles, 'in the sharpest words ever, I\r\nthink, used in a despatch, demanded reparation, and the \"signal,\r\nconspicuous, and exemplary punishment\" of Chefket Pasha, director of the\r\nBulgarian massacres.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Servia and Montenegro, feudatory States of the Porte, had gone\r\nto war with their overlord; and in order to induce the Turks to grant an\r\narmistice, Russia and Austria proposed to England a joint naval\r\ndemonstration, carried out in the name of Europe, by England and France.\r\nLord Derby proposed instead a conference of Europe to take place at\r\nConstantinople, and to this the Powers agreed. But Russia, not contented\r\nwith this step, presented an ultimatum to Turkey demanding an armistice\r\nfor Servia, and obtained it on November 1st. Thus, by Lord Derby's action,\r\n'the armistice was refused to Europe and yielded to a Russian ultimatum.'\r\n\r\nThe conference met at Constantinople in December, 1876, and on the 14th\r\nLord Salisbury, who represented England, was advocating the \"efficacious\r\nmeasure\" of occupying Bulgaria by English troops, and, when this was\r\nrefused, proposed the employment of Belgians. But--\r\n\r\n    'It was now too late. Turkey had been encouraged by us into\r\n    mobilization. Russia had been thwarted by us into mobilization. The\r\n    time was past when we might have averted war, might have pacified the\r\n    East, protected alike the Eastern Christians and \"British interests\"\r\n    by a signature.'\r\n\r\nReplying to a common argument, he said: 'Want of money will not cause\r\nRussia to terminate the war. Machiavelli has truly said that nothing is\r\nmore false than the common belief that money is the sinews of war.'\r\n\r\nThe conference failing, all Ambassadors were withdrawn from the Porte, and\r\nRussia continued to parley with the other Powers. 'Early in March, 1877, a\r\ndraft Protocol regarding the expectation of the Powers with regard to\r\nTurkish reforms was handed to Lord Derby, who promised to sign if Russia\r\nwould promise to disarm.' Russia specified the conditions on which she\r\nwould 'disarm,' and Lord Derby then signed the Protocol, but added a\r\ndeclaration that his signature should be null unless disarmament followed\r\nboth in Russia and Turkey. This, in Sir Charles's judgment, was tantamount\r\nto a refusal to sign, because Lord Derby must have known that Turkey would\r\nnever grant, except under coercion, the conditions on which Russia had\r\nconsented to disarm. \"All Turkish promises are of one material--\r\npaper,\" he said, and in severely criticizing the action of the Government\r\nadded: \"The unreformed state of Turkey is, and will continue to be, the\r\ngreatest standing menace to the peace of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, at the same moment England again separated herself from the other\r\nPowers by sending an Ambassador--Mr. Layard--to Constantinople, 'to which\r\nthe Turks replied: \"The Porte is very sensible of this delicate mark of\r\nattention.\"'\r\n\r\nThe effect was to encourage Turkey to count on English support, and\r\nRussia, unable to secure concerted action, declared war single-handed.\r\n\r\nThus, not only was the result missed which Sir Charles desired and thought\r\npossible--namely, the restoration of order by joint action of Europe--but\r\nthe way was paved for another result which he deplored--the extension of\r\nRussia's influence, and even of her territorial sway.\r\n\r\nAs his speeches gave the story of the European position, so his diary\r\nprovides a commentary on that story from within:\r\n\r\n    'Things generally were in a disturbed condition at this moment. The\r\n    Eastern Question, which was to be so prominent for the next four\r\n    years, had grown critical, and Bourke, the Under-Secretary for Foreign\r\n    Affairs (afterwards Lord Connemara and Governor of Madras), said to me\r\n    at the House of Commons: \"The one thing that astonishes me is the\r\n    confidence of people in Lord Derby.\" Now, Lord Derby was his chief.\r\n    This proved pretty clearly that Mr. Disraeli was, in fact, his own\r\n    Foreign Secretary, and had made up his mind that Lord Derby should\r\n    \"go.\" [Footnote: Lord Derby did not \"go\" till the spring of 1878.]\r\n\r\n    'June 28th, 1876, is the date of the first of my letters mentioning\r\n    the Eastern Question. It is from Auberon Herbert: \"We are sure to get\r\n    into some frightful trouble if Dizzy is to be allowed uninterruptedly\r\n    to offer what sacrifices he will on the altar of his vanity. You all\r\n    seem to me to be living in Drowsy Hollow, while Dizzy is consulting\r\n    his imagination, and Hartington politely bowing. What can you all be\r\n    doing? Is it the hot weather? Or are all of you secretly pleased at\r\n    England's 'determined attitude'? Please, dear Neros, cease fiddling\r\n    for a short time, and let us poor, harmless, innocent-minded country-\r\n    folk have some assurance that you are not going to fight all\r\n    Europe.... You sleepy and unfaithful guardians.\" ...\r\n\r\n    'Although I was the first politician to make a speech upon the\r\n    Bulgarian massacres, [Footnote: See reference to Eugene Schuyler's\r\n    letter in speech of August, 1876, p. 207.] I afterwards refused to\r\n    follow Mr. Gladstone into what was called the \"atrocity agitation,\"\r\n    because I feared that we should find ourselves plunged into a war with\r\n    Turkey in alliance with Russia, of which I should have disapproved.'\r\n\r\nHe subscribed, however, to the funds of those who took charge of the\r\nfugitives on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe agitation offended him by its extravagance. \"If Gladstone goes on much\r\nlonger, I shall turn Turk,\" he wrote to Sir William Harcourt. There was\r\ngeneral disquiet in the Liberal party. On October 10th, 1876, Sir William\r\nHarcourt wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Things here are in the most damnable mess that politics have ever\r\n    been in in my time. Gladstone and Dizzy seem to cap one another in\r\n    folly and in pretence, and I do not know which has made the greatest\r\n    ass of himself. Blessed are they that hold their tongue and wait to be\r\n    wise after the event. To this sagacious policy you will see we\"\r\n    (_i.e.,_ the Hartington section) \"have adhered, and shall adhere. I\r\n    had a long letter from Hartington from Constantinople (whither, as you\r\n    will see, he has prudently retired), full of his usual good sense and\r\n    caution. I quite concur with him that, though a strong case can be\r\n    made against the Government for their deliberate _status quo_ policy\r\n    during the months of June, July, and August, there is little fault to\r\n    find with what they have been doing since Derby has taken the matter\r\n    into his own hands in September. There is a decided reaction against\r\n    Gladstone's agitation. The Brooksite Whigs are furious with him, and\r\n    so are the commercial gents and the Norwood-Samuda [Footnote: Leading\r\n    shipowners and Members of Parliament.] lot, whose pecuniary interests\r\n    are seriously compromised. The Bucks election [Footnote: This by-\r\n    election, on September 22nd, 1876, was consequent on Mr. Disraeli's\r\n    acceptance of a Peerage. The Conservative (Hon. T. F. Fremantle) beat\r\n    the Liberal (Mr. R. Carington, brother to Lord Carrington), but only\r\n    by 186 votes on a poll of over 5,000.] has a good smell for Dizzy. All\r\n    the Rothschild tenants voted Tory, though, to save his own skin, Nat.\r\n    went on Carington's committee. The Rothschilds will never forgive\r\n    Gladstone and Lowe for the Egyptian business. Chamberlain and Fawcett\r\n    ... are using the opportunity to demand the demission of Hartington\r\n    and the return of Gladstone. But you need not ... prepare for extreme\r\n    measures.\"\r\n\r\nBy the same post came a letter from Mr. Chamberlain, who declared that he\r\nwas \"not Gladstonian,\" but considered that--\r\n\r\n    \"After all, he is our best card. You see Forster's speech--trimming as\r\n    usual, and trying to dish the Radicals by bidding for the Whigs and\r\n    Moderates. Gladstone is the best answer to this sort of thing, and if\r\n    he were to come back for a few years he would probably do much for us,\r\n    and pave the way for more. Lord Hartington ... is away and silent,\r\n    besides which he is pro-Turk. If Gladstone could be induced formally\r\n    to resume the reins, it would be almost equivalent to a victory, and\r\n    would stir what Bright calls 'the masses of my countrymen' to the\r\n    depths.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles's own considered opinion was written to Sir William Harcourt\r\non October 16th:\r\n\r\n    \"I, as you know, think Hartington the best man for us--the Radicals--\r\n    because he is quite fearless, always goes with us when he thinks it\r\n    safe for the party, and generally judges rightly--or takes the\r\n    soundest advice on this point. In fact, I don't think he's ever made a\r\n    mistake at all--as yet; but Chamberlain seems, by a sort of quasi-\r\n    hereditary Birmingham position, to look at him as Bright used to look\r\n    at Palmerston. This is serious, because Chamberlain is a strong man\r\n    and does not easily change, unlike the other member of our\r\n    triumvirate, Cowen, who is as fickle as the wind, one day Hartington,\r\n    one day you, one day Gladstone, and never seeming to know even his own\r\n    mind.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's return to leadership was more and more assured, but he\r\nwould not find his old antagonist face to face with him in the House of\r\nCommons. At the close of the Session of 1876 Sir Charles had unknowingly\r\nwitnessed a great withdrawal.\r\n\r\n    'On the night of August 11th I had listened to Mr. Disraeli's last\r\n    speech as a Commoner, and had noticed that on leaving the House in a\r\n    long white overcoat and dandified lavender kid gloves, leaning on his\r\n    secretary's arm, he had shaken hands with a good many people, none of\r\n    whom knew that he was bidding farewell to the House of Commons.'\r\n\r\nThis withdrawal marked no lessening of power. As Sir Charles had\r\nperceived, Disraeli was his own Foreign Secretary, and a Foreign\r\nMinister's influence gained by being exercised in the House of Lords.\r\nMeanwhile, in Gladstone's absence the Liberal party seemed broken and\r\ndivided beyond hope of recovery. In the country, though the campaign\r\nlaunched by the Bulgarian pamphlet had seemed so immediately effective\r\nthat a Tory county member said to Mr. Gladstone, \"If there were a\r\ndissolution now, I should not get a vote,\" yet the reaction, spoken of in\r\nHarcourt's letter to Dilke on October 10th, very quickly developed. Those\r\nwho supported Mr. Gladstone identified themselves unreservedly with the\r\nSlav as against the Turk. But by others the demand for ejection of the\r\nTurk, \"bag and baggage,\" from Bulgaria was construed as an invitation for\r\nRussia to seize Constantinople, and thus as a direct infringement of\r\nBritish interests in Egypt and the Mediterranean. Lord Beaconsfield\r\nskilfully played upon this feeling, and there ensued a condition of\r\naffairs in which Mr. Gladstone made triumphal progresses through the north\r\nof England, and was hooted weekly in the streets of London.\r\n\r\nSir Charles himself was in a great difficulty, being as he says, 'anti-\r\nRussian without being for that pro-Turk.' Sharing to the full the general\r\ndetestation of these massacres, of which the earliest complete exposure\r\nhad been made public [Footnote: See p. 207, Schuyler's letter.] by him, he\r\nheld that there ought to be armed intervention. But he knew too much of\r\nRussia's action in conquered provinces to feel that the matter could be\r\nsettled satisfactorily by allowing Russian influence to replace Turkish\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nWhat was more, he knew that in 1870, when Russia repudiated the Black Sea\r\narticle in the Treaty of Paris, March 30th, 1856, Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernment had pressed the Powers of Europe to make general the Tripartite\r\nTreaty, April 27th, 1856, 'Our Government (Gladstone-Granville) proposed\r\nto answer the Russian Circular by extending the Tripartite Treaty to all\r\nthe Powers, and it was only Germany's refusal that stopped it.' By this\r\ntreaty, 'France, Austria, and the United Kingdom bound themselves to\r\nconsider any breach of the Treaty of Paris, 1856, or any invasion of the\r\nintegrity of the Ottoman Empire, as a _casus belli_.' In other words, the\r\nLiberal Government had been anxious in 1870 that all the Powers should\r\nguarantee for all time the power of the Turk in its full extension, though\r\nTurkish methods were in 1870 and before it no other than they revealed\r\nthemselves at Batak in 1876. Sir Charles thought that, as Liberals had\r\nbeen precipitate in their desire to guarantee Ottoman integrity in 1870,\r\nso now they were precipitate in their Pan-Slavism. Moreover, the\r\nvacillation of the Liberal leaders had put a weapon into the hands of the\r\nGovernment. 'Fancy what a temptation to the present Government to publish\r\nthe despatches,' notes Sir Charles, in comment on Sir William Harcourt's\r\nremark 'that the Tripartite Treaty discussion would be a mine of gunpowder\r\nto the Liberal Front Bench.'\r\n\r\nHe set forth his position in a speech to his constituents at Kensington on\r\nJanuary 9th, 1877. He condemned Lord Derby, who had neither \"the energy\r\nnor the force of character to fit him for the post of Foreign Secretary,\"\r\nand whose policy had left them at the close of 1876 in \"absolute\r\nisolation.\" Yet, \"on the other hand, he marvelled to see Radicals, for\r\nyears the enemies of Russian autocracy, propose the immediate adoption of\r\nthe policy of Canon Liddon and of the Emperor Alexander.\" [Footnote: Dr.\r\nH. P. Liddon and Dr. Malcolm MacColl were conspicuous as enthusiastic\r\nsupporters of Mr. Gladstone's campaign.] And he went on to depict what\r\nthat policy might mean:\r\n\r\n\"The world could not afford to see 120,000,000 of Slavs united under the\r\nsceptre of an absolute despot, holding at Constantinople the strongest\r\nposition in all Europe, stretching from the Adriatic to Kamskatka and the\r\nBehring Straits, and holding in Corea the strongest position in the\r\nPacific.\" Then he recalled the record of \"that Power with which the\r\nLiberals of England were to strike alliance--an absolute autocracy of the\r\npurest type, the Power which crushed Poland, the Power which crushed\r\nHungary for Austria.\" And by what methods! The long story of violation\r\n\"both of the public and the moral law\" was repeated, with citation of\r\nBritish Ministers who had spoken in fierce condemnation of, Russian\r\nmethods; the decoration of Mouravief, the \"woman-flogging General,\" was\r\nset off against the promotion of Chefket Pasha. He himself had seen in\r\n1869 \"long processions of Polish exiles, who were still being sent by\r\nhundreds into the solitudes of Siberia.\" In Turkestan General Kaufmann had\r\nordered a massacre of women and children, and Kaufmann, \"loaded with\r\nfavours by the Emperor Alexander, still ruled in Turkestan.\" It was a\r\nvehement denunciation of the autocracy of Russia, and he notes that he had\r\nnever before so moved his hearers. To his attack on the Russian Government\r\nwere added some severe strictures on the barbarities perpetrated by\r\nServians, and by Mr. Gladstone's special favourites, the Montenegrins,\r\ninhabitants of \"countries whose civilization had not sufficiently\r\nprogressed to allow of the belief that they were the unselfish champions\r\nof an outraged Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nHolding these views, and holding them the more strongly because they were\r\nthe outcome of personal experience and knowledge laboriously acquired, he\r\nwas in a considerable degree isolated, not only from the Liberal party as\r\na whole, but even from that more intimate organization whose existence was\r\nalready recognized in the autumn of 1876, when Mr. Knowles asked him to\r\nwrite in the _Nineteenth Century_ on the \"New Party.\"\r\n\r\nHis closest associate, now and henceforward, was Mr. Chamberlain, who in\r\n1877 stayed a great deal in Sloane Street, and Dilke notes that in\r\nFebruary of that year he was giving dinners almost every night to\r\nintroduce the member for Birmingham to London. But the \"New Party,\" when\r\nMr. Knowles made his unsuccessful request, consisted\r\n\r\n    'of Chamberlain and myself and Cowen in the House of Commons, and\r\n    Morley outside of it.... As Chamberlain and Cowen failed to agree upon\r\n    any subject whatever, the House of Commons portion of the party soon\r\n    dwindled to two leaders, in the persons of Chamberlain and myself,\r\n    who, however, picked up one faithful follower in Dillwyn. From\r\n    September, 1876, to April, 1880, there did exist a very real and very\r\n    influential, but little numerous, party, consisting of Chamberlain and\r\n    myself, followed blindly by dear old Dillwyn, and supported in the\r\n    Press by Morley. As Randolph Churchill afterwards said to me, shaking\r\n    his head over Balfour's desertion: \"When you and Chamberlain were\r\n    together, your party was not too large.\" He had begun with four (three\r\n    regular and one half-attached), and found it certainly one, perhaps\r\n    two, and I sometimes think three, too many, though Wolff indeed\r\n    followed him almost as steadily as Dillwyn followed us.'\r\n\r\nFor a time the \"New Party\" consisted of six. Mr. Edmund Dwyer Gray, an\r\nIrish Nationalist, owner of the _Freeman's Journal_, was of it, but soon\r\ndropped out, and for a time Mr. Burt--Father of the House in 1910--was\r\nalso included.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1877 summons was sent to a meeting before the opening\r\nof Parliament, to which Mr. Chamberlain replied solemnly: \"The party will\r\nbe complete.\" Further solemnity was added by the holding, at 76, Sloane\r\nStreet, of a Queen's Speech dinner in due form on the eve of the Session,\r\nbut--\r\n\r\n    'the dinner of six members, which assembled democratically without\r\n    dressing in order to suit Burt's habits, was not graced by that copy\r\n    of the Queen's Speech which is sent by Government to the leaders of\r\n    the regular Opposition.'\r\n\r\nThe \"New Party\" of 1876-77 differed notably in one respect from the other\r\nsmall and influential group of which it was the forerunner. It had no\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, February 17th, Chamberlain dined with the Prince of\r\n    Wales. In noting the invitation in my diary I put down: \"The Prince of\r\n    Wales has asked Chamberlain to dinner for Saturday. I call this\r\n    'nobbling my party.'\" But the possessive pronoun with regard to the\r\n    party was not according to my custom. We always said that the party\r\n    consisted of three in all--two leaders and a follower--and Dillwyn\r\n    acknowledged Chamberlain and myself as equal leaders.'\r\n\r\n    'On July 4th I drove Dillwyn down to Chiswick to the Duke of\r\n    Devonshire's garden party. The Prince of Wales was there, and gave\r\n    Dillwyn a very friendly bow, whereupon I asked Dillwyn how he came to\r\n    know him so well, to which \"the party\" answered that he had shot\r\n    pigeons with him; and on my reproaching my old friend for indulging in\r\n    such sport, he said that he not only shot pigeons, but that the Prince\r\n    had been so struck with his shooting that he had asked who the old\r\n    gentleman was \"who looked like a Methodist parson and shot like an\r\n    angel.\"'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1877, when they were still six, division existed even\r\nin that small group on the burning question of the hour. Mr. Cowen was\r\nstrongly influenced by his intercourse with a settlement of Poles at\r\nNewcastle, and--\r\n\r\n    'although his anti-Russian views were only the same as my own, yet he\r\n    allowed them, as I think, without reason, to drive him into a position\r\n    of support of the Government which from this time forward separated\r\n    him from the Liberal party.'\r\n\r\nNone of Sir Charles's other colleagues approached the Eastern Question\r\nentirely on its own merits as distinct from party. His study of foreign\r\npolitics had, however, forced him to understand the issues, and thus his\r\nposition was rendered difficult: 'I was anti-Russian, and in this with\r\nHartington. On the other hand, I was for avowed intervention in the East,\r\nand in this more extreme than Mr. Gladstone.' But at the same time his\r\nexceptional competence in the discussion brought him steadily to the\r\nfront. Without any sacrifice of independent judgment he found himself\r\nincreasingly consulted.\r\n\r\nHis Memoir gives, therefore, an interesting picture of the movement of\r\nopinion in the Liberal party. At the beginning of the Session, when it was\r\nknown that Lord Salisbury had advocated active interference in the name of\r\nEurope, Sir Charles found that 'only Harcourt and the Duke of Argyll were\r\nfor strong action in the sense of coercion of Turkey.' The Duke, however,\r\nsoon made two converts, and Dilke wrote to his brother on January 6th,\r\n1877:\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Granville and Lord Hartington will, I am delighted to say, speak\r\n    for concerted intervention. The only man who strongly opposed their\r\n    doing so was Mr. Gladstone, who ran away from his own views.\" Against\r\n    this Sir Charles notes later: 'Both at the meeting of Parliament in\r\n    1877, and also later on in the Session in the case of his own\r\n    memorable resolutions.'\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone had in private conversation told Harcourt that such a\r\n    course as European intervention to coerce Turkey \"should only be\r\n    resolved upon after much deliberation.\" To this Harcourt had retorted:\r\n    \"Well, Mr. Gladstone, if people outside knew what you were saying,\r\n    they might reflect it was you that hung the bag of powder on the\r\n    door.\"'\r\n\r\nOn February 11th Sir Charles noted, 'Harcourt has got frightened and has\r\ngone back,' fearing a division in the House of Commons on which Henry\r\nRichard and the peace men would either support the Government or abstain\r\nfrom voting, lest intervention should mean war.\r\n\r\nThus party feeling fluctuated. On February 16th, 1877, Sir Charles's diary\r\nrecorded that 'the popular name for our Front Bench with the London mob is\r\n\"Bag and baggage Billy and his long-eared crew.\"' This showed that 'in the\r\npopular mind the personality of Mr. Gladstone had finally triumphed over\r\nthat of Hartington.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Sir Charles's views coincided with those of Lord Hartington\r\nto the extent of being anti-Russian, and, as already seen, he was more\r\ndrawn by personal feeling to him than to any of the various leaders. Mr.\r\nForster and Mr. Goschen seemed to him inclined to what a letter of\r\nHarcourt's called \"the old facing-both-ways style,\" and the magic of Mr.\r\nGladstone's personality never exercised its spell on Dilke. But he liked\r\nLord Hartington personally, and liked also Lord Hartington's ally, the\r\nDuchess of Manchester, who, he says--\r\n\r\n    'used to try very hard to pick up political information for Lord\r\n    Hartington; but her own strong Conservative prejudices and her want of\r\n    clearness of head made her by no means a useful guide, and in fact the\r\n    wonder to me always was to see how Hartington's strong common sense\r\n    kept him from making the mistakes into which she always tried by her\r\n    influence to press him.'\r\n\r\nThat was written after an interview which Sir Charles had with her, at her\r\nrequest, on January 8th, 1877. The Duchess had read a report of a speech\r\nof his, in which 'I lectured on the Franco-German War, and condemned the\r\ntaking of territory as bound to lead to further wars.' On February 10th he\r\nmet her again to discuss the difficulties which were beginning to spring\r\nup, since Mr. Gladstone's sudden access of activity, as to the leadership\r\nof the party. In this matter Sir Charles kept himself 'absolutely\r\nindependent, going now with one and now with the other, with mere regard\r\nto the opinions which they put forward.... I had a full knowledge of what\r\nwas going on behind the scenes,' although, because he was not in complete\r\nagreement with either party among the Liberal leaders, he 'had not the\r\ncomplete confidence of either side.'\r\n\r\nThis detachment of attitude adds the more weight to the judgment which is\r\npassed in the following detailed review of the situation as it was in the\r\nspring of 1877:\r\n\r\n    'At this moment' (February 18th, 1877) 'London was a centre of\r\n    intrigue. But my interest in the Eastern Question had nothing to do\r\n    with persons, and was an honest one, and I found myself able to act\r\n    only with those who had no candidate of their own for the leadership\r\n    of the party, or who, like Lord Granville, were brought to a similar\r\n    position by the conflict between party loyalty and a personal\r\n    affection for Mr. Gladstone, and I was able therefore at this moment\r\n    to act more steadily with Lord Granville than with any other leading\r\n    member of the Liberal party. He was jealous of Lord Hartington, but he\r\n    was loyal to him as the party chief. Towards Mr. Gladstone he was\r\n    affectionate, but not blind.' [Footnote: Sir Charles summarises here a\r\n    memorandum he drew for Lord Granville for the debate on February 19th,\r\n    used then and on several other occasions. He pointed out that the\r\n    Government policy, since the failure of the Conference, of leaving\r\n    things alone, was safe for the moment, but it did nothing for the\r\n    Eastern Christians, gave no satisfaction to the demands made in the\r\n    name of the Queen by Lord Derby on September 21st, 1876, offered no\r\n    bridge to Russia for the avoidance of war, and therefore left the\r\n    Turkish Empire and British interests exposed to the gravest danger.\r\n    Concerted action was the course Liberals desired.]\r\n\r\n    'There can be no doubt that many were making use of the Eastern\r\n    Question for the purpose of advancing their particular views as to the\r\n    leadership of the party. When men have to use other men as tools for\r\n    the execution of any plan, it is difficult for them to refrain from\r\n    that tricky handling of them which is best for the immediate end, but\r\n    debases both the user and the used. To sway men by knowledge of their\r\n    weaknesses is the task of a charlatan rather than of a statesman. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, with all his inconsistency upon the Eastern Question, and\r\n    in spite of the fact that he had only just seen evils which had always\r\n    been there, had that which the others lacked, moral conviction, and\r\n    Hartington was infected with moral indifferentism. The Conservatives\r\n    no doubt thought that Mr. Gladstone's attitude was mere emotional\r\n    facility, a mere exhibition of spasmodic power of transient\r\n    enthusiasm, an effect rather of temperament than of conviction, and\r\n    unlikely therefore to produce a continued consequence of action\r\n    sustained at a high level. The public, however, saw more clearly.\r\n    Power over the moral fibre of other natures is not given to those\r\n    whose own nature is wanting in this moral force, and Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    attitude on the Eastern Question, in spite of his contradictions and\r\n    of his occasional running away from the consequences of his own acts,\r\n    was appreciated with accuracy by that large section of the public\r\n    which ultimately followed him.'\r\n\r\nTo this estimate should be added the record of a talk which passed in June\r\nof the same year at a dinner party, where Sir Charles, 'along with Matthew\r\nArnold, Bowen, afterwards Lord of Appeal, and Frederick Pollock,'\r\ndiscussed 'what is known as moral force':\r\n\r\n    'I upheld the view that to me Gathorne Hardy (although I never agreed\r\n    in a word which the future Lord Cranbrook said) possessed moral force\r\n    in the highest degree, but that this moral force was one which I felt\r\n    had only prejudice behind it. Still to me the intense conviction of\r\n    the man gave him immense strength, and made him the most really\r\n    eloquent Englishman to whom I had ever listened. Gladstone, I thought,\r\n    had moral force, because he believed in the particular thing of which\r\n    he was speaking at the particular moment at which he spoke. I somewhat\r\n    differed from the others with regard to Bright, thinking that he was\r\n    seldom really in earnest, although I admitted that no man gave more\r\n    strongly the impression of earnestness to his hearers, and therefore\r\n    no man had \"moral force\" in a higher degree.... Courtney (who had come\r\n    in during the autumn of 1876) and Fawcett both have \"moral force.\"'\r\n\r\nIn March, 1877, the last stage was reached in those long-drawn\r\nnegotiations by which the statesmen of Europe endeavoured to avoid war,\r\nand the declaration which Lord Derby attached in the name of England to\r\nthe Protocol of London was virtually a refusal to assent to coercion of\r\nTurkey. Acting as leader of the Opposition, Lord Hartington asked Dilke to\r\n'sketch a vote of censure on the declaration.' In the debate which took\r\nplace on April 13th (the day after Russia declared war against Turkey)--\r\n\r\n    'I spoke at great length, but too late for good reports, and by my\r\n    \"gospel of selfishness\" and other similar phrases raised ringing\r\n    cheers and counter-cheers, which for some time stopped my going on. I\r\n    felt after this day no longer afraid to stand up to anyone upon the\r\n    other side, but I noted that if Mr. Disraeli had been still in the\r\n    House I should not have hoped to have escaped as I did, after saying\r\n    all I had said of his colleagues in a full house, and coining such a\r\n    phrase of their proceedings as \"gospel of selfishness\"; but that which\r\n    struck me most in the whole debate was above all the want of\r\n    statesmanlike suggestion.'\r\n\r\nA week after the declaration of war it seemed all but certain that Great\r\nBritain must be drawn into the conflict; and Sir Charles--\r\n\r\n    'prepared (on April 20th, 1877) a resolution, which put on record my\r\n    opinions, and stated that the House regretted the failure of the\r\n    policy of the Government either to improve the position of Christian\r\n    subjects of the Porte or to avert war. It also regretted their\r\n    unwillingness to co-operate with any other of the European Powers.'\r\n\r\nBut the Liberal party as a whole was not able to formulate any such clear\r\nconclusion. Within a week Mr. Gladstone had determined to break away from\r\nthe \"upper official circles of Liberalism,\" and to move a series of\r\nResolutions, which were actually drafted on April 26th, but the existence\r\nof which did not become generally known till the 29th.\r\n\r\n    '_29th April_.--Took Chamberlain to a party at Lord Houghton's, where\r\n    Lord and Lady Salisbury were leading figures, and where was Harcourt,\r\n    boiling over with rage at Mr. Gladstone, whose Resolutions had just\r\n    been heard of. Gladstone will very probably split the Liberal party\r\n    into two factions, but I do not see that he could have avoided doing\r\n    as he has done. Chamberlain and I and Fawcett must vote with him.\r\n    Cowen will vote against him, although if principles and not persons\r\n    were in question he must vote the other way. Gladstone will move a\r\n    string of resolutions, of which only one will touch the past--namely,\r\n    one to condemn the Turks for not carrying out the sentences on their\r\n    officers employed in the Bulgarian massacres. The main one, which\r\n    touches the future, will, I believe, bind over the Government not to\r\n    give aid to Turkey. His speech will be very fine.'\r\n\r\nThe \"upper official circles\" met, and in full conclave decided to separate\r\nthemselves publicly from Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nMore serious still, this decision to oppose their colleague and quondam\r\nleader was communicated to the Press. But on May 5th reconciliation was\r\neffected. Concerning this Lord Morley says:\r\n\r\n    \"What was asked was that he (Mr. Gladstone) should consent to an\r\n    amended form of his second resolution, declaring more simply and\r\n    categorically that the Turk by his misgovernment had lost his claims.\"\r\n\r\nGladstone himself wrote that the change was \"little more than nominal.\"\r\nBut Sir Charles's Memoir of the time shows at once how far the schism had\r\ngone, and also how different a view was taken of the alteration by some of\r\nMr. Gladstone's supporters:\r\n\r\n    'On May 3rd I noted in my diary: \"The Liberal party will next week\r\n    cease to exist. I have already eighty-eight names of men who will vote\r\n    with Gladstone, and, the Front Bench having foolishly decided to\r\n    support the previous question, the party will be equally divided, and\r\n    Hartington will resign. Gladstone will, I think, refuse to lead.\r\n    Hartington will be asked to come back, but Goschen's friends may spoil\r\n    the absolute unanimity of the request, and Hartington then refusing,\r\n    Goschen would succeed. This seems to be the Goschen intrigue. I am\r\n    sincerely sorry. The Front Bench people might perfectly well have\r\n    voted against the 'previous question' on the ground that they support\r\n    the first resolution, and yet have spoken against Gladstone's later\r\n    resolutions.\"' He added later: 'I have still in my possession (1890)\r\n    the list of the party as made up by me, showing who would have voted\r\n    with Mr. Gladstone, who would have voted with Lord Hartington, ... and\r\n    who had stated that they would abstain. The analysis is of interest,\r\n    as the facts have never been made known.' [Footnote: For analysis see\r\n    Appendix at end of this chapter, p. 223.]\r\n\r\nThe outcome was a day in which Mr. Gladstone had to sustain singlehanded\r\nfrom half-past four to seven a Parliamentary wrangle of the most\r\nembarrassing kind, concerning the alteration of the form (and possibly the\r\nsubstance) of his original motion, and then to speak for another two hours\r\nand a half.[Footnote: See _Life of Gladstone_, vol. ii., chap, iv., p.\r\n565.]\r\n\r\n    'At the last moment Mr. Gladstone executed a sudden change of front,\r\n    which prevented a break-up of the party, but made his own position\r\n    somewhat foolish. I was lunching with old Mrs. Duncan Stewart to meet\r\n    Mrs. Grote and Lady Aberdare, the wife of Mr. Gladstone's former\r\n    colleague (Bruce, the Home Secretary), when I heard what was to\r\n    happen. But publicity was only given to the change at the last moment.\r\n\r\n    'On May 8th I recorded in my diary that \"Gladstone's noble delivery of\r\n    his peroration last night saved the evening from being a complete\r\n    fiasco, but only just saved it. The Duke of Westminster, who was to\r\n    have presided at the meeting at St. James's Hall, absented himself on\r\n    account of the change of front; but the meeting was not told that the\r\n    third and fourth resolutions were to be withdrawn. Both Gladstone and\r\n    also the rest of the Front Bench people are in the wrong--he for\r\n    moving at all in a sense hostile to Lord Hartington unless he meant to\r\n    go through with the thing, and they for not finding a better way out.\r\n    Such a way was clear last night. If Hartington had given notice of a\r\n    direct vote of censure on the new reply to Russia published yesterday,\r\n    as he might have done consistently with his views, Gladstone could\r\n    have withdrawn in face of it.\"'\r\n\r\nA general note on his personal difficulties follows later:\r\n\r\n    'In August (1877) I was again embarrassed by my attitude upon the\r\n    Eastern Question. The fact that, being responsible, we had neglected\r\n    to be humane, or to be politic, during the previous one-and-twenty\r\n    years in which we might have taken the lead--might have insisted upon\r\n    reform in Turkey and fostered the possibilities of self-government in\r\n    the dependent States--made it difficult to approve the sudden activity\r\n    which the conduct of the Turks in their straits called forth on the\r\n    part of many Liberal politicians. Action might doubtless have been\r\n    taken by us at any time between the Crimean War and the outbreak of\r\n    the Russo-Turkish War, but, as the opportunity had been neglected, it\r\n    was difficult to inaugurate such a policy under pressure of the\r\n    atrocities agitation....\r\n\r\n    'The new position of the Eastern Question, although it did not unite\r\n    me with Mr. Gladstone, made a political breach between myself and\r\n    Hartington. He fell more and more under the somewhat stupid influence\r\n    of his surroundings, and I, holding a position between the two wings\r\n    of the party, found few with whom I myself agreed. Randolph\r\n    Churchill... made advances towards me which led to joint action, as\r\n    will be seen, in 1878. But in the autumn of '77 I was isolated, for\r\n    Chamberlain went, although with moderation, with Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    agitation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n'The division of the party was a very singular one. The Whigs were\r\ndivided; the Radicals were divided; the wild Irish were divided, for the\r\nwild Irish at this particular moment were receiving the Liberal whip, and\r\nwere, accordingly, on the party lists. On the whole, out of 296 members\r\nwho were at this moment receiving the Liberal whip, about 110 had\r\npronounced for Mr. Gladstone, and about 110 for Lord Hartington against\r\nMr. Gladstone, the remainder, who included a majority of the Irish, having\r\nannounced their intention of walking out, or having refused to take\r\nsides.... With Lord Hartington and against Mr. Gladstone were, of course,\r\nnearly all the Front Bench, even those who at first promised to support\r\nMr. Gladstone having seen fit to change under pressure. One curious fact\r\nabout my list is the large number of persons at first marked with a single\r\nline, as having promised Mr. Gladstone, and afterwards altered to crosses\r\nas having yielded under Front-Bench pressure. The Basses were with Lord\r\nHartington; Sir Thomas Bazley, leader of the middle-class Lancashire\r\nWhigs, who at first had gone with Mr. Gladstone, had gone over to Lord\r\nHartington. The Beaumonts were with Lord Hartington, as were the Brasseys.\r\nThe two Brights, John and Jacob, who at first had been expected to support\r\nMr. Gladstone, had finally decided, under peace influences, to support\r\nLord Hartington, on the ground that his policy was less likely than that\r\nof Mr. Gladstone to bring about an armed intervention. Campbell-Bannerman\r\nwas frankly with Lord Hartington from the first; and Lord Frederick and\r\nLord Edward Cavendish went with their brother, although Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish was one of Mr. Gladstone's dearest friends. Childers knew no\r\ndoubts, but Joe Cowen's support of Hartington was more peculiar. Peace\r\nmen, like Sir Wilfrid Lawson, who disapproved the Crimean War, were\r\nperhaps in their right place in supporting Lord Hartington's opposition to\r\nMr. Gladstone's resolutions; but Cowen and his set, such as Norwood and\r\nLeatham, went with Lord Hartington chiefly, I think, on account of their\r\nbitter personal hatred for Mr. Gladstone. J. K. Cross, afterwards to be\r\nUnder-Secretary of State for India, went with Hartington, against our\r\nexpectation; but the joint weight of Devonshire influence and the Brights\r\nwas too much for Lancashire. Cowper Temple, de Grey (afterwards lady\r\nRipon), and Grant Duff were with Lord Hartington, as was to be expected.\r\nEllice, and Evans of Derbyshire, representative Whigs, separated\r\nthemselves from such other ordinary Whigs as Leveson-Gower and Young, and\r\nwent with Hartington. Fitzmaurice separated himself from Fawcett and me\r\nand Chamberlain and Courtney, and pronounced, after some hesitation, for\r\nHartington. W. E. Forster, the two Goldsmids, Goschen, Harcourt, and\r\nHayter, were, of course, with Hartington, as was also Herschell. Sir Henry\r\nJames could no more be expected to separate himself from Hartington than\r\ncould Nigel Kingscote, Knatchbull-Hugessen, or Lord Kensington, the Second\r\nWhip.... Stansfeld supported Hartington, as did very naturally Sir N. de\r\nRothschild (afterwards Lord Rothschild), the Marquis of Stafford, Lord\r\nTavistock, and Mr. Roebuck (who, oddly enough, received our whip, though\r\nhe never voted with us unless we went wrong). Trevelyan went with\r\nHartington--a thing which had been less expected than the support of\r\nHartington by Mr. Villiers, by Mr. Whitbread, and by Walter of the\r\n_Times_.... Mr. Biggar characteristically stated to various people that he\r\nshould vote against Hartington, for Hartington, and not at all.... Mr.\r\nButt from the first declared that he should not compromise his party by\r\ntaking part in the division.... Parnell, like Butt, from the first said\r\nthat he should abstain.... P. J. Smyth, the orator of the Irish party, or\r\nwho might perhaps rather be described as forming a party in himself, for\r\nhe was not a Home Ruler, but a Repealer, also, after at first intending to\r\nsupport Mr. Gladstone, decided not to vote.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHOME POLITICS AND PERSONAL SURROUNDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a week spent in Paris at the end of 1876 Sir Charles stayed with\r\nGambetta, and took occasion to bring about a meeting between him and Sir\r\nWilliam and Lady Harcourt, who were also in Paris. With Sir William\r\nHarcourt was his son and inseparable companion Mr. Lewis Harcourt, who\r\nrecalls a day when Sir Charles said to him: \"Now, Loulou, I want you to\r\ncome and have lunch with me by yourself; I'm not asking your father and\r\nmother to-day.\" He remembers his pride in going off to the Café Anglais,\r\nwhere they were met by a man with a big black beard. \"This, Loulou, is\r\nMonsieur Gambetta.\" The two men talked, and the boy listened, as he was\r\nwell used to do, for in those days he constantly \"ran about beside his\r\nfather like a little dog.\" After lunch they went for a drive, and still\r\nthe men talked, and Gambetta pointed to the window from which he had\r\nproclaimed the Republic, and Dilke showed where he had lain for half a day\r\nwhile the French troops were besieging the French of Paris. The boy\r\nlistened eagerly--to understand, years after, how the whole drive had been\r\nplanned for his edification and delight.\r\n\r\nSince August, 1876, Gambetta had been talking of a visit, proposing, says\r\nSir Charles, to \"come to me in town, and probably bring Challemel-Lacour\r\nalso to 76, Sloane Street.\" The visit was to be purely private and social;\r\n\"he will receive no deputations, no addresses, and will visit no\r\nprovincial towns.\"\r\n\r\n    'It was in 1876 that he sent to me a certain Gérard, who became French\r\n    reader to the Empress Augusta of Germany, and it is supposed that the\r\n    somewhat brilliant volume called _The Society of Berlin_, long\r\n    afterwards published under the name of _Count Paul Vasili_ by Madame\r\n    Adam (although not the later volumes of the same series, which were by\r\n    Vandam), was from Gérard's pen. Gambetta, when he came to power as\r\n    Prime Minister, appointed Gérard, who was then in the Legation at\r\n    Washington, his private secretary, Georges Pallain being the second,\r\n    and Joseph Reinach the third. But Pallain and Reinach, in fact,\r\n    exercised the functions, because Gambetta fell before Gérard arrived.\r\n    Gérard is now (1909) an Ambassador.'\r\n\r\nJust before Dilke's visit to Gambetta in the spring of 1877 another\r\nindication of his popularity in France occurred. 'Gavard had come to me\r\nfrom the French Embassy to ask me whether I should like to go to Paris\r\nwith Sir Louis Mallet to arrange a new French Treaty, as \"his Government\r\nwould like me.\"' The proposal fell through. As Sir Charles said, 'the\r\nGovernment could not well, I think, have sent two Liberals at the head of\r\nthe Commission.' Mallet\r\n\r\n    'was a very experienced official, not, however, very successful at the\r\n    Board of Trade, and greatly given to grumble and growl. He held the\r\n    mildly reciprocitarian views in which he followed Mill and expanded\r\n    Cobden's opinions, and was thought by us to be the author of the\r\n    _Letters of a Disciple of Richard Cobden_, the circulation of which by\r\n    the Cobden Club, at his own request, nearly destroyed that\r\n    institution. He afterwards left the Board of Trade for the India\r\n    Office, where he became permanent Under-Secretary of State, on which\r\n    occasion Grant Duff said, \"Mallet will be happy now. He will have\r\n    _two_ worlds to despair of;\" for he generally began each sentence with\r\n    the words, \"I despair,\" uttered in a deep voice.'\r\n\r\nOn April 10th, 1877, just before the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War,\r\nwhich seemed as if it might involve all the Great Powers, is this entry of\r\na dinner with the French Minister:\r\n\r\n    'Went to dine with Gavard, meeting his second and third secretaries,\r\n    the Italian first secretary, the Dutch Minister (Baron de Bylandt),\r\n    the Belgian Minister (Solvyns), and \"The Viper\" (alias Abraham\r\n    Hayward, Q.C.). Cypher telegrams poured in all through dinner, and\r\n    portended no good to the peace of Europe. It was, however, a pleasant\r\n    dinner, in which Hayward and Solvyns had most of the talk to\r\n    themselves, but made it good talk. Gavard was afterwards accused by\r\n    the Republican party of having conspired against them, which for his\r\n    friends seemed always to be a statement in the nature of a joke. I\r\n    once asked Gambetta if he seriously believed that Gavard had\r\n    conspired, at which Gambetta shook with laughter in his jovial way,\r\n    but added that it was absolutely necessary to pretend he had, for\r\n    other people had conspired in the Embassy, and the head man (in the\r\n    absence of an Ambassador) must be held responsible in such a case.'\r\n\r\nAnother diplomatist whom Sir Charles met in the same month was the Comte\r\nde Montgélas, first secretary to the Austrian Embassy:\r\n\r\n    '... A man who played a great part at this time, belonging to a\r\n    Bavarian family which had furnished a distinguished politician to the\r\n    Congress of Vienna. He went everywhere, knew everyone, was clever,\r\n    showy, talkative; but after being one of the leading exponents of the\r\n    Beaconsfield policy, he was suddenly dismissed by his Government, ...\r\n    and when, many years afterwards, I again saw him, he had become a\r\n    servant of the British North Borneo Company. I believe he was too\r\n    friendly to Bismarck to please Beust (then Austrian Ambassador in\r\n    London).'\r\n\r\nHe tells also the story of a 'King-maker':\r\n\r\n    'The Portuguese Minister in 1876 was the old Duc de Saldanha. This was\r\n    the man who some years previously, at the age of eighty, being\r\n    dissatisfied with the state of things in Lisbon, had taken the steamer\r\n    from Southampton, and, though he was at the time Minister in London,\r\n    landed at Lisbon, put himself at the head of the Guards, marched on\r\n    the palace, locked up the King, turned out the Ministers, put in his\r\n    friends, released the King, and returned by the next steamer to his\r\n    legation.'\r\n\r\nHere too is gossip from Berlin:\r\n\r\n    'On June 15th, 1877, I breakfasted with Goschen to meet Lord Odo\r\n    Russell, who was most amusing. He told us that, Bismarck being ill,\r\n    the Chancellor's temper was so bad as to make him \"impossible for his\r\n    family, his subordinates, and even his Sovereign.\" He said that\r\n    Bismarck hates the Empress Augusta with so deadly a hatred as to have\r\n    lately said to him: \"I am not Foreign Secretary. My master's Foreign\r\n    Secretary is the Empress, whose Foreign Secretary is the French\r\n    Ambassador, whose Foreign Secretary is the General of the Jesuits.\"...\r\n\r\n    'At this time General Grant came to London, and, as I had known him at\r\n    Washington and he had liked me there, I had to go about a good deal to\r\n    meet him at his wish, and he also dined with me on June 10th, when I\r\n    invited him to choose his own party. He knew, however, so few men in\r\n    London that I had to suggest men to him, and asked him whether he\r\n    would like to meet Butt as the leader of the Irish party. He said he\r\n    should, but was very silent all through dinner and until he had begun\r\n    the second of two big cigars. Then, as usual with him, he began to\r\n    thaw under the influence of tobacco, and whispered to me--when Butt\r\n    was talking very pleasantly under the influence of something besides\r\n    tobacco, and with his enormous, perfectly round face assuming, as it\r\n    always did after dinner, the appearance of the harvest moon--\"Is he a\r\n    Papist?\" to which I replied \"No\"; whereupon Grant became friendly to\r\n    him. General Grant's chief weakness, unless that position be assigned\r\n    to his cigars, was his detestation of the Roman Catholics.'\r\n\r\nMany political personages are sketched in passing reference. Here is\r\nRoebuck, who in his fierce prime had been known as 'Tear 'em':\r\n\r\n    'The famous orator and Radical of past days was now a little,\r\n    shrivelled-up old man, but he was still able to play a great part in\r\n    the House of Commons, although entirely decayed in mind. His vinegary\r\n    hatred of Mr. Gladstone, and of the Liberal party generally, uttered\r\n    from the Liberal side in a piercing treble, was destined to be cheered\r\n    to the echo for a short time from the Tory benches, and Roebuck, later\r\n    than this, saw himself made a Privy Councillor by Lord Beaconsfield.'\r\n\r\nIn January, 1877, is this reference to a force of the future:\r\n\r\n    'Randolph Churchill and Drummond Wolff to dinner; amusing in the style\r\n    of Robert Macaire and his man.'\r\n\r\nAmong more disciplined sections of the Tory party Sir Charles had many\r\nfriends. One of them, a social figure of great charm and distinction, was\r\nLord Barrington,\r\n\r\n    'who used, when Mr. Disraeli was leader of the House of Commons, to\r\n    keep for him the notes which have to be kept by the Prime Minister for\r\n    the Queen.... Barrington showed me his one night; it began: \"Lord\r\n    Barrington presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\n    inform your Majesty that...\" The Queen in no way showed her\r\n    favouritism to Mr. Disraeli more than in excusing him from the\r\n    performance of this tiresome duty, which, however, had the one\r\n    advantage of giving Mr. Gladstone in his administration something\r\n    quiet to do during exciting divisions such as those on Bradlaugh....\r\n\r\n    'Lady Waldegrave pressed me to go to Strawberry Hill on a particular\r\n    Saturday in the month--the only one, I think, on which, as a fact, I\r\n    did not go--to meet the Prince of Wales, but as she playfully took me\r\n    to task at the same time for not attending levees, I connected the two\r\n    things, and thought she had been asked to speak to me, and declined. I\r\n    told her that I had left off going to levees in 1865, before I left\r\n    Cambridge, for no reason except that they bored me; and that if I were\r\n    suddenly to go, people would think that I had changed my views, and\r\n    wished it to be known that I had changed them, for they thought that\r\n    my not going was connected with my opinions, which, however, it was\r\n    not.'\r\n\r\nThere is a note early in this year:\r\n\r\n    'I was engaged at this moment on an attempt to form a circle of\r\n    friends who would be superior, from the existence with them of a\r\n    standpoint, to the mere ordinary political world, and I began doing my\r\n    best to meet frequently those whom I most liked--John Morley, Dillwyn,\r\n    Leonard Courtney, and Fitzmaurice, prominently among the politicians;\r\n    and Burton (Director of the National Gallery), Minto, and Joseph\r\n    Knight, prominently among the artists and men of letters. All these\r\n    were men with something noble in their natures, or something delicate\r\n    and beautiful, full of sterling qualities.'\r\n\r\nMinto was the well-known man of letters. Joseph Knight, for many years\r\ndramatic critic of the Athenaeum, and, later, editor of _Notes and\r\nQueries_, was perhaps the best known and most beloved of Bohemians, a\r\npillar of the Garrick Club, and one of the men to whose tongue came\r\nceaselessly apt and unexpected quotations from Shakespeare. He had the\r\nsame passion as old Mr. Dilke for accumulating books, and like him, too,\r\nwas a living catalogue to his own library, or libraries, for he\r\naccumulated and sold two in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nAnother man of letters needs no introduction:\r\n\r\n    'A wreck of glasses attests the presence of Swinburne. He compared\r\n    himself to Dante; repeatedly named himself with Shelley and Dante, to\r\n    the exclusion of all other poets; assured me that he was a great man\r\n    only because he had been properly flogged at Eton, the last time for\r\n    reading _The Scarlet Letter_ when he should have been reading Greek;\r\n    confessed to never having read Helvétius, though he talked of Diderot\r\n    and Rousseau, and finally informed me that two glasses of green\r\n    Chartreuse were a perfect antidote to one of yellow, or two of yellow\r\n    to one of green. It was immediately after this that Theodore Watts-\r\n    Dunton took charge of him and reduced him to absolute respectability.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles tells stories of a remarkable political and literary\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Houghton's anecdotes were rendered good by the remarkable people\r\n    that he had known.... He once about this time said to me: \"I have\r\n    known everyone in the present century that was worth knowing.\" With a\r\n    little doubt in my mind, I murmured, \"Napoleon Bonaparte?\" \"I was\r\n    taken to Elba when I was a boy,\" said Houghton instantly. I thought\r\n    his recollections of the first Emperor apocryphal. There was, however,\r\n    a chance that the father--who was in Italy--did take the child to\r\n    Elba.'\r\n\r\nAnother story, of which Lord Houghton was not the narrator, but the\r\nsubject, came to Sir Charles during a party at Lady Pollock's, and\r\nconcerned the dinner which had preceded the party.\r\n\r\n    'It had been at seven o'clock in honour of Tennyson, who would not\r\n    dine at any other hour, and Tennyson sat on one side of the hostess,\r\n    and Lord Houghton on the other; and the latter was cross at being made\r\n    to dine at 7, preferring to dine at 8.30, and sup, after dinner, at\r\n    11. The conversation turned on a poem which had been written by\r\n    Tennyson in his youth, and Tennyson observed \"I have not even a copy\r\n    myself--no one has it.\" To which Lord Houghton answered: \"I have one.\r\n    I have copies of all the rubbish you ever wrote.\"--A pause.--\"When you\r\n    are dead I mean to publish them all. It will make my fortune and\r\n    destroy your reputation.\" After this Tennyson was heard to murmur,\r\n    \"Beast!\" It must have been a real pleasure to him to find himself\r\n    survive his brother poet.\r\n\r\n    'On the same evening I heard a story (probably a well-known one, but\r\n    certainly good) of the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon's body; how the\r\n    Government of the day wrote to the Duke to tell him they had agreed to\r\n    let the French transport the corpse from St. Helena, the Duke being in\r\n    Opposition at the time; how the answer ran: \"F.-M. the Duke of\r\n    Wellington presents his compliments to H.M.'s Ministers. If they wish\r\n    to know F.-M. the Duke of Wellington's opinion as on a matter of\r\n    public policy, he must decline to give one. If, however, they wish\r\n    only to consult him as a private individual, F.-M. the Duke of\r\n    Wellington has no hesitation in saying that he does not care one\r\n    twopenny damn what becomes of the ashes of Napoleon Buonaparte.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles had always many friends among artists, and his weekly visit to\r\nthe National Gallery was rarely intermitted by him even when in office. To\r\nthe end of his life he maintained the habit of going there whenever he\r\ncould make time, and always inspecting each new purchase. He kept in\r\ntouch, too, regularly with the art of his own day, and records his sight\r\nof the first exhibition in the still unfinished Grosvenor Gallery. The\r\nexhibition did not please him as a whole, though he admired not only\r\nBurne-Jones's \"Days of Creation,\" but a picture called \"Passing Days,\"\r\nalso allegorical, the work of Burne-Jones's disciple, Mr. Strudwick. His\r\ntaste in art was always personal; Velasquez, the painters' painter, made\r\nno appeal to him. He worshipped Perugino and Bellini, rating \"The Doge\"\r\namong the masterpieces of the world; while Raphael had for him degenerated\r\nfrom his master's (Perugino's) perfection into mere expressionless beauty.\r\nHis appreciations were made with great force and originality, and an old\r\nAcademician who had accompanied him round galleries once said to the\r\nsecond Lady Dilke (herself a most authoritative judge of painting): \"It is\r\nalways interesting to see what a man like that will admire.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain, Sir Charles's frequent guest at 76, Sloane Street, was\r\nusually his companion in picture-seeing. It is also recorded that in the\r\nspring of this year Dilke took his friend, 'at an unearthly hour for one\r\nof his lazy habits,' to see the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of music his preferences were no less emphatic, as witness\r\nthis entry:\r\n\r\n    'On May 29th I dined with a sister of Edward Levy Lawson, married to a\r\n    German who was Rubinstein's great friend; and not only Rubinstein, but\r\n    Joachim, played to the guests. Mrs. Bourke, a sister-in-law of Lord\r\n    Mayo, was always asked everywhere in London where Joachim was meant to\r\n    play, inasmuch as she was his favourite accompanist among amateurs.\r\n    The modesty of the great man led him after dinner, once when I was\r\n    dining with the Mitfords, when he knew that his time had come, to turn\r\n    to Mrs. Bourke, who was famous only as shining in his reflected light,\r\n    and say: \"Mrs. Bourke, won't you play us something, and I will just\r\n    come in with my fiddle?\" Rubinstein's playing I never liked. To me he\r\n    seemed only the most violent of all the piano-bangers of the world;\r\n    but he was literally worshipped by his admirers, and was grand to look\r\n    at--as fine as Beethoven must have been.'\r\n\r\nEarly in March of this year occurred the death of George Odger. The\r\nworking class of London decided to show their great respect by giving him\r\nsuch a funeral ceremony as is rare in England, and Sir Charles walked\r\nbareheaded through the streets with the great procession that accompanied\r\nthe body from the house in High Street, St. Giles's, all the long miles to\r\nBrompton Cemetery.\r\n\r\nA shrewd observer of Parliaments wrote of Sir Charles at this time:\r\n\r\n    \"There is no more popular man in the House of Commons than he who\r\n    seven years ago\" (it was only five) \"was hooted and howled at, and was\r\n    for many succeeding months the mark of contumely and scorn in all\r\n    well-conducted journals.\"\r\n\r\nOn this statement Sir Charles's diary affords a commentary:\r\n\r\n    'At this time (April, 1877) there occurred some discussion between\r\n    Chamberlain and me as to what should be our attitude in the event of\r\n    the formation of a Liberal Government, and he was willing to accept\r\n    office other than Cabinet office, provided that it was office such as\r\n    to give him the representation of his department in the House of\r\n    Commons. Chamberlain and I found that we could exercise much power\r\n    through the Executive Committee of the Liberal Central Association,\r\n    which was a new body which at this time managed the whole of the\r\n    electoral affairs of the party. It comprised the two Whips _ex-\r\n    officio_--the Right Hon. W. P. Adam, and Lord Kensington; and among\r\n    the other seven members, Chamberlain and I represented the Radicals,\r\n    and communicated with the union of Liberal associations commonly known\r\n    as the Birmingham Caucus. Of the others Waddy was there to represent\r\n    the Methodists; C. C. Cotes [Footnote: M.P. for Shrewsbury. He was a\r\n    Lord of the Treasury and one of the Whips in Mr. Gladstone's second\r\n    Government.] and Sir Henry James were there chiefly as amateur whips\r\n    fond of electoral work; Lord Frederick Cavendish, to represent his\r\n    brother, the leader of the party; and Whitbread, to strengthen the\r\n    Whig influence.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes here that on June 29th, when he was to second, as usual,\r\nMr. Trevelyan's annual motion concerning franchise and redistribution, he\r\n\r\n    'had a conference with Chamberlain on the question whether we could\r\n    possibly get together a small knot of young peers to help us in the\r\n    House of Lords. Rosebery seemed the only one that we could find worth\r\n    thinking of, and we had him to dinner, and went to stay with him, and\r\n    generally tried to join forces, but without any very marked effect.'\r\n\r\nDilke and Chamberlain also sounded the Home Rulers to see if they could\r\nfind any basis of co-operation; and about this date Sir Charles, with Lord\r\nand Lady Francis Conyngham and Butt, and 'in their sitting-room, full of\r\nperennial clouds of smoke,' where a captive nightingale sang ('thinking\r\nthe gas the moon unless he took Butt's face for that luminary of the\r\nheavens'), settled with the Irish leader that in following years they\r\nshould amend Mr. Trevelyan's franchise resolution by moving for the\r\nextension of the franchise in counties throughout the United Kingdom; not\r\neven Radicals had previously proposed to enlarge the electorate in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nBut in these days the Irish party were beginning to apply and develop that\r\nuse of Parliamentary forms for obstructive purposes which had been first\r\nsystematically attempted by the \"Colonels\" in opposition to Mr. Cardwell's\r\nBill for abolishing purchase in the Army, and Liberals were a little\r\nscandalized by their allies. In the close of July Sir John Lubbock, then a\r\nLiberal, 'foreshadowed his future Unionism by observing that \"the\r\nobstructive Irish were the Bashi Bazouks, who did more harm to us by their\r\natrocities than good by their fighting.\"' A couple of days later, when\r\nLiberals supported an Irish amendment, Dilke himself agreed with Mr.\r\nRylands's pun that \"they would have had a bigger vote if it hadn't been\r\nBiggar.\" Upon this matter Sir Charles's attitude was naturally affected by\r\nthat of Butt, in whose company he delighted. The great advocate believed\r\nin his own power to effect by eloquence and reasoned argument that change\r\nof mind in the British House of Commons which five-and-twenty years'\r\nexperience of Ireland had wrought in himself since the days when he\r\nopposed O'Connell on Repeal, and this led him to resent the methods of\r\nunreason. Mr. Parnell, who never believed that England was open to reason\r\nin the matter of Ireland, was only beginning to impress his personality on\r\nthe House; there is but one incidental mention of his name in the Memoir\r\nfor 1877.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all the claims of home politics, in Sir Charles's\r\njudgment every statesman had, under existing conditions, to study the\r\ndetails of modern warfare, and he kept closely in touch with naval\r\narmament:\r\n\r\n    'On February 24th I suddenly went down to Portsmouth to go over the\r\n    dockyard and see the ships building there, taking letters from\r\n    Childers and from Sir Edward Reed to Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock,\r\n    the Arctic explorer (Superintendent), and to Mr. Robinson, the Chief\r\n    Constructor. I went over the _Inflexible_, the _Thunderer_, and the\r\n    _Glatton_, which were lighted up for me. Noting the number of sets of\r\n    engines, and the number of the separate watertight compartments of the\r\n    _Inflexible_, I wrote: \"All these extremely complicated arrangements\r\n    are handed over to a captain, of whom ... is a favourable example, and\r\n    to engineers who are denied their due rank in command.\"'\r\n\r\nNearly thirty years later the necessary reform which the last words\r\nindicate was carried out by Lord Fisher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN QUESTION--TREATY OF SAN STEFANO AND CONGRESS OF BERLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1878 Parliament was summoned a month earlier than\r\nusual to tranquillize public feeling--a result not thereby attained, for\r\nthe Russians, now completely victorious, were but a short distance from\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nSir Charles returned from Toulon, 'breakfasting with Gambetta on the 14th\r\nJanuary,' and on the 15th delivered to his constituents the speech already\r\nquoted, which gave a summary of the events leading up to the war, his\r\njudgment of the facts as they existed at the time of his speaking being\r\nthat the Government's whole policy was \"isolated, undignified,\r\ninconsistent, unsafe.\" [Footnote: See p. 205]\r\n\r\n    \"We stand alone, absolutely alone, in face of terms of peace which we\r\n    dislike, but can't resist. Turkey is crushed, about whose integrity\r\n    the Tory party raved. Russian influence will have risen and English\r\n    influence fallen in the East. Greece, the anti-Russian friend of\r\n    England, is not to gain. Servia and Montenegro, the tools of Russia,\r\n    are to be rewarded. Bulgaria is to owe its freedom, not to Europe, but\r\n    to Russia.\"\r\n\r\nSo much was accomplished fact. It had still to be decided how much farther\r\nRussia should be allowed to push her advantage. Upon this he said,\r\nspeaking \"as a European Liberal,\"\r\n\r\n    'I agree with what the first Napoleon said, in those St. Helena days\r\n    when he was acting Liberalism for the benefit of his historic\r\n    character and of his line, that \"it is necessary to set up a\r\n    guaranteed kingdom, formed of Constantinople and its provinces, to\r\n    serve as a barrier against Russia.\" The open question for discussion\r\n    is whether the present Turkey serves the purpose....\r\n\r\n    'Were the choice between Russia at Constantinople and Turkey at\r\n    Constantinople, I should prefer the latter. The Turkish is in ordinary\r\n    times a less stifling despotism than the Russian....\r\n\r\n    'The Turks let any man go to any church and read any book, the\r\n    Russians do not, and in such a position of power as Constantinople I\r\n    should prefer the Turk if, as I do not think, the choice lay only\r\n    there.'\r\n\r\nWhere else, then, did the choice lie? The answer is that Dilke, in his own\r\nwords, \"dreamed of a new Greece.\" He spoke of the lands then blighted by\r\nthe Sultan's Government--of \"rose-clad Roumelia and glorious Crete\"--of\r\ncountries held back by Turkish incompetence, that were by Nature\r\nincredibly rich--\"the choicest parts of Europe, perhaps of the world.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The Greek kingdom is a failure, we are told. Greece, liberated by the\r\n    wise foresight of Mr. Canning, but left, on his ill-timed death,\r\n    without Thessaly, Epirus, Crete, has been starved and shorn by the\r\n    Great Powers. As once said Lafayette, \"the greater part of Greece was\r\n    left out of Greece.\" What kind of Greece is a Greece which does not\r\n    include Lemnos, Lesbos, or Mitylene, Chios, Mount Olympus, Mount Ossa,\r\n    and Mount Athos? Not only the larger part, but the most Greek part of\r\n    Greece, was omitted from the Hellenic kingdom. Crete and the other\r\n    islands, the coast of Thrace, and the Greek colony at Constantinople,\r\n    are the Greek Greece indeed, for Continental Greece within the limits\r\n    of the kingdom is by race half Slav and half Albanian. We must not,\r\n    however, attach too much importance to this fact, for in all times the\r\n    Greeks have been a little people, grafting themselves on to various\r\n    barbaric stocks. Race is a small thing by the side of national spirit,\r\n    and in national spirit the Greeks are as little Slav as the Italians\r\n    are Teutonic. Even the corrupting influence of long slavery--and it\r\n    was deep indeed--had not touched this spirit, and the very thieves and\r\n    robbers of the hills of Greece made for themselves in Byron's days a\r\n    glorious name in history. I do not think that Greece has failed. I\r\n    believe in Greece, believe In the ultimate replacement of the Turkish\r\n    State by powerful and progressive Greece, attached in friendship to\r\n    France and England, her creators--an outpost of Western Europe in the\r\n    East; and I think the day will come when even Homer's city may once\r\n    more be Greek. Those who do not wish to see Slavonic claims pushed\r\n    much farther than justice needs should speak their word on behalf of\r\n    Greece.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this ideal he never swerved, and the authority which he possessed in\r\nEuropean politics helped to keep it present before the mind of Europe.\r\nGreece knew her friend, and after his death the Municipality of Athens\r\ngave his name--_hodos Dilke_--to a fine street in the true mother city of\r\nHellas. [Footnote: \"The name of Sir Charles Dilke is more highly prized in\r\nGreece than that of any living Englishman,\" wrote M. Zinopoulos, General\r\nSecretary to the Ministry of the Interior in Greece. \"This feeling still\r\nsurvived in 1887, when we went to Athens,\" adds Sir Charles's note.] He\r\nnever lived to see Hellenic government extend itself over Turkish fiefs,\r\nexcept in that poor strip of northern territory which, thanks greatly to\r\nhis exertions, was secured for Greece in 1881. But before this memorial of\r\nhim could be completed, while those who worked on it were still searching\r\namong his papers to reconstitute the projects he had shaped, came the\r\nrealization of some of his premonitions, and the end of Turkish sway in\r\n\"the most Greek parts of Greece.\"\r\n\r\n    'It was a good speech so far as concerned the position of Russia, of\r\n    Turkey, and of the Opposition, and in its protest against Manchester\r\n    Doctrine and in favour of a broader view of foreign policy, but it\r\n    proposed the annexation of Egypt, a view from which I soon afterwards\r\n    drew back, and which I did not hold at the time at which it became\r\n    popular some years later on.'\r\n\r\nUpon the main issue which in 1878 lay before the mind of Europe, he was\r\nfor a partition of the Turkish Empire, though upon condition of keeping\r\nConstantinople secured to the Turk. But as to the question of England's\r\ngoing to war, he asked:\r\n\r\n    \"For what are we to fight? Against an extension of Russian boundaries\r\n    in Armenia which will be slight, and which, if it were great, would be\r\n    better met by an even greater extension of English territories in\r\n    Egypt? Against 'the passage of the Dardanelles'--which means in time\r\n    of war its passage if Russia can--a passage which Russia would equally\r\n    attempt if she could, but had not the right. Against this we are to\r\n    fight without allies. Again, let us pray for peace. I will not\r\n    describe what war must mean--your sons and daughters killed, or lying\r\n    crippled amid horrors worse than death; the proceeds of your toil\r\n    wrung from you by new taxes; the dearness of your children's bread. I\r\n    have seen too much of war. ... No tongue can depict its horrors. ...\r\n    It is said that the constituencies are warlike, and that party wire-\r\n    pullers think that war would be \"a good card to play.\" I hope and\r\n    believe that English constituencies would be warlike if real honour\r\n    and real interests were at stake. If they are warlike now, it is that\r\n    they know not war. Are those for war who know its face? ... The day\r\n    may come when England will have to fight for her existence, but for\r\n    Heaven's sake let us not commit the folly of plunging into war at a\r\n    moment when all Europe would be hostile to our arms--not one Power\r\n    allied to the English cause.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if that folly were to be committed. When Parliament opened in\r\nJanuary, a declaration of war was foreshadowed by the hint of a demand for\r\nfunds to make \"adequate preparation against some unexpected occurrence.\"\r\n\r\nNor was there any steady rallying point offered by the Opposition:\r\n\r\n    'January 17th was the day of the meeting of the House, the Radical\r\n    Club Dinner having replaced our private Queen's Speech Dinner of 1877.\r\n    But the disorganization of the Liberal party at this moment was so\r\n    complete that no Front Bench party was given on the night before\r\n    Parliament met, and Liberal politicians, or such of them as were\r\n    asked, had had to do their best to talk at a Tory house--Lady\r\n    Stanhope's in Grosvenor Place--where I met Harcourt and some of the\r\n    others. The situation in the debate on the Address was one which ought\r\n    to have led to successful attack upon the Government. The Queen's\r\n    Speech was neither of war nor of peace, but of perplexity and\r\n    division, and gravely informed us that poor Turkey had not interfered\r\n    with British interests. The discourses of the Ministers were peaceful\r\n    in the Lower House, and warlike in the Upper. Money was to be asked\r\n    for in the event of an \"unexpected occurrence\" happening.'\r\n\r\n    'Nothing, however, was made of the situation by the Opposition, and I\r\n    felt more interest therefore for the moment in my proposed political\r\n    reforms, in which I was on the point of a partial success, [Footnote:\r\n    'I introduced my two Bills of the previous year--both destined this\r\n    year to pass, though one of them after amalgamation with a\r\n    Conservative Bill--my Hours of Polling Bill and my Registration Bill.\r\n    I moved for my return, intended to facilitate my action in the\r\n    direction of redistribution, and got my Select Committee promised\r\n    me.'] and sheered off from the Eastern Question, with regard to which\r\n    I felt that in Parliament at the moment I could do no good.'\r\n\r\nThe speech to his constituents had attracted much attention. Among the\r\npersonal congratulations which he received he valued most highly those of\r\na great diplomatist and friend, 'high praise from Sir William White.'\r\n[Footnote: Sir William White (1821-1891): February 27th, 1875, British\r\nAgent and Consul-General in Servia; March 3rd, 1879, Envoy Extraordinary\r\nand Minister Plenipotentiary at Bucharest, Roumania; April 18th, 1885,\r\nEnvoy Extraordinary at Constantinople; October 11th, 1886, Special\r\nAmbassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at Constantinople.] On\r\nJanuary 17th he 'received a deputation of London merchants with regard to\r\nthe Black Sea blockade.'\r\n\r\n    'On Friday the 18th I dined at Lady Waldegrave's to meet the old\r\n    Strawberry Hill set--the Duke of Argyll, the Duchess of Manchester,\r\n    Lord and Lady Granville, Harcourt, James, Ayrton, Lord William Hay,\r\n    and Mr. and Mrs. Tom Hughes--and some people came in after dinner, of\r\n    whom Sir J. Rose and his daughter (Mrs. Stanley Clarke) warmly\r\n    congratulated me on my speech. There was a discussion between the\r\n    Liberals and the Duchess of Manchester, who was in both camps, and Sir\r\n    John Rose, who as a financier was the same, as to the reasons for Lord\r\n    Carnarvon's absence from Lord Beaconsfield's Queen's Speech Dinner,\r\n    but we could not get farther than to learn that \"Dizzy had made it\r\n    unpleasant for him. ...\" [Footnote: 'Another matter as to which I was\r\n    personally interested, though the others seemed hardly to have heard\r\n    of it, was a communication which had been made to France about Egypt\r\n    with regard to joint inquiry into the state of finances, a\r\n    communication all but volunteered by us, and not, I thought, in the\r\n    least necessary, but which was so strong in terms as to appear to shut\r\n    the door in the future against any possibility of action on our part\r\n    other than joint action with the French.']\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday the 19th Mr. Gladstone sent Lefevre to me, and asked me\r\n    not to raise the case of Greece at present, as he thought that a\r\n    combined movement with regard to Greece might soon be made in the\r\n    House of Commons with some chance of success.\r\n\r\n    'On the Sunday Drummond Wolff dined with me, very full of the\r\n    intrigues to get rid of Lord Derby and Lord Carnarvon from the\r\n    Conservative Front Bench, and very hopeful of success, for at this\r\n    moment the Conservatives were so angry with their two peaceful men\r\n    that they made no secret of their intention to force them out, and\r\n    used freely to discuss the situation with the Liberals.\r\n\r\n    'On January 22nd I started an attempt to get up a Greek Committee, an\r\n    attempt which was successful, for our little meeting of this day, of\r\n    Fitzmaurice and Lefevre and myself, with the adhesion by letter of\r\n    Lansdowne and of Rosebery, led to the private formation of a\r\n    Committee, afterwards made public, and much enlarged, of which I made\r\n    Lewis Sergeant secretary, and which was able to do much good in the\r\n    course of the three next years. ...That night I dined with Mrs. Inwood\r\n    Jones (Lady Morgan's niece), and met Mr. and Mrs. Stansfeld, Browning,\r\n    Charles Villiers, Lady Hamilton Gordon, and another man whom I will\r\n    not name, because I wish to mention that I received from him on that\r\n    occasion a document relating to Greek affairs, from which I was\r\n    afterwards able to show how badly our Government had treated Greece,\r\n    but the origin of which I ought not to reveal.\r\n\r\n    'On January 23rd Evelyn Ashley, Chamberlain, and I had a meeting with\r\n    regard to Greek matters, at which we drew up the public declaration to\r\n    be made on behalf of the friends of Greece.\r\n\r\n    'On the next day, January 24th, a good many startling events occurred.\r\n    A War Ministry was formed at Athens; the vote of money was announced\r\n    in the British Parliament. Lord Carnarvon resigned in the morning, and\r\n    Lord Derby at night; but Lord Derby's resignation was for a time\r\n    withdrawn.'\r\n\r\nIn 'the great debate' on Mr. Forster's motion against the vote of six\r\nmillions sterling for 'adequate preparation'--a debate which opened on\r\nJanuary 31st, and was prolonged to the second week in February--Sir\r\nCharles took part on the fourth day. Great interest attaches to this\r\nspeech in view of all his later work:\r\n\r\n    'I pointed out that we spend normally on defence or war far more than\r\n    any other Power: at that time twenty-five millions sterling at home\r\n    and seventeen millions in India, or forty-two millions in all, swelled\r\n    in that year by the extraordinary vote to forty-eight millions, while\r\n    France and Germany spent much less. I was to return to this subject\r\n    after many years, and when I wrote upon it in 1890, while the Indian\r\n    expenditure stood at the same sum, the annual expenditure in England\r\n    had risen to over thirty-eight millions, making the whole fifty-five,\r\n    and with the rest of the Empire nearly fifty-seven millions sterling.'\r\n\r\nA side-note adds: 'It is now (1905) vastly greater.'\r\n\r\nAs he was the first non-military politician to devote himself to the\r\nquestion of defence and to call public attention to the subject, so this\r\nquestion of wasteful expenditure always occupied his attention. He laid\r\nstress on the inadequate return received for naval and military outlay,\r\nnot only on the popular ground that money was thus deflected from projects\r\nof internal reform, but pre-eminently because the nation in time of peace\r\nresents heavy defence expenditure, and he feared that the necessary money\r\nmight not be forthcoming for that naval equipment which he held to be\r\nessential to our existence as a Great Power.\r\n\r\nBut the main burden of his complaint was that now when a Conference was\r\nproposed, and when England ought to have gone into the Conference with all\r\nthe weight of a unanimous people, the bringing forward of a \"sham war\r\nvote,\" which was a contradiction of the alleged desire to negotiate, had\r\nproduced inevitable division of counsels. Before the debate closed came\r\nthe rumour of an occupation of Constantinople by the Russians, and under\r\nthe belief that the war vote might be needed in good earnest, Mr.\r\nForster's motion was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n    'On February 6th ... I dined with Lady Brett and went on to Mrs.\r\n    Brand's, and at the Speaker's House heard that the Russians had\r\n    occupied a fort in the Constantinople lines. This lie got out the next\r\n    day, and was universally believed; and after a panic in the City,\r\n    Hartington decided, also in a panic, to make W. E. Forster drop the\r\n    resolutions which he had brought forward at Hartington's request.\r\n    Hartington saw me, and told me this behind the Speaker's chair before\r\n    questions. Within an hour after the withdrawal of the resolutions had\r\n    been mentioned in the House the whole story had been blown into the\r\n    air by the Russian Ambassador.'\r\n\r\nAt this period Sir Charles Dilke had entered into relations with Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill, who was virtually against the policy of the Government\r\nand yet 'open-mouthed in his general dislike of Lord Derby and Lord\r\nCarnarvon, though in complete agreement with their principles.' The Fourth\r\nParty did not yet exist. Nor was it in this Parliament that Lord Randolph\r\nachieved ascendancy.\r\n\r\n    'As late as the autumn of 1880 Lord Beaconsfield was to style Randolph\r\n    \"only Dilke and water\"; but had he lived for another twelvemonth\r\n    longer he would not have used this language, for Churchill had then\r\n    developed a very different \"Moloch of Midlothian\" style, and had made\r\n    himself through his party a greater power than I ever was.'\r\n\r\nThe attempt to concert action between independent Tory and independent\r\nRadical began after the great scare of February 6th. [Footnote: This\r\ncorrespondence was placed at Mr. Winston Churchill's disposal by Sir\r\nCharles Dilke, and used by him in the _Life of Lord Randolph Churchill._\r\nSir Stafford Northcote was leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer.]\r\n\r\n    'On February 7th negotiations between Randolph Churchill and myself\r\n    began as to moving an address to the Crown praying that the objects\r\n    with which England should enter any Conference that might be held,\r\n    should be European and civilized rather than pro-Turkish. On this day\r\n    he wrote to me:\r\n\r\n    '\"MY DEAR SIR CHARLES DILKE,\r\n\r\n    '\"As I suppose this debate will come to a close with an enormous and\r\n    disproportionate majority for the Government, and as I think the\r\n    Opposition have made their stand on an unfortunate ground, and that\r\n    another fight might yet be fought with far greater chances of\r\n    commanding sympathy in the country, I want to know whether, if an\r\n    address to the Crown praying Her Majesty to use her influence at the\r\n    Conference in favour of the widest possible freedom to Bulgaria,\r\n    Bosnia, Herzegovina, Thessaly, and Epirus, and in favour of totally\r\n    and finally putting an end to all direct Turkish Government in these\r\n    provinces, was moved by me on the Tory side of the House, it would be\r\n    supported by the Liberal party. I think I could almost make sure of a\r\n    strong Home Rule vote on this. I think some Conservatives would\r\n    support it. If Northcote does not give some very clear intimation of\r\n    what is going to be the policy of the Government, I think a motion of\r\n    this sort should be made on the Report. The real cry for the country\r\n    is not sympathy with Russia, still less with Turkey, but complete\r\n    freedom for the Slav and Hellenic nationalities. I am off to Ireland\r\n    to-night. I don't care enough for the Government to vote for them. ...\r\n    I shall see Butt in Dublin, and shall sound him on what I have written\r\n    to you. My address is Phoenix Park, Dublin. Please excuse this lone\r\n    letter.\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    '\"RANDOLPH S.

How far the Duke of\r\n    Marlborough was cognizant of the intrigues between his son and the\r\n    Irish I never knew, but at one time relations were very close.\"\r\n    [Footnote: Sir John Gorst read this chapter in 1913 and wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"With Randolph's negotiations with the Irish at this time I had\r\n    nothing to do. I was not cognizant of them; I never acted with R.\r\n    before 1880.\r\n\r\n    \"So far as I knew, the alliance between the Fourth Party and the Irish\r\n    leader arose in this way: In the 1880 Parliament Parnell had not\r\n    enough men to move an adjournment of the House--in those days the most\r\n    effective form of obstruction. Forty members must stand up. On one\r\n    occasion after 1880, P., wanting to move an adjournment, sought an\r\n    interview with us--Balfour may or may not have been present. He stated\r\n    his case, and we replied that the matter was a proper case for an\r\n    adjournment, and we and those we could influence would stand up in\r\n    support. He thanked us and was leaving the room, when R., twirling his\r\n    moustache, said: 'I suppose, Mr. Parnell, that in cases of this kind\r\n    there will be a little reciprocity.' After that, when we moved\r\n    adjournments, the Parnellite members always stood up for us.--J. E.\r\n    G.\"]\r\n\r\n    'On February 8th Lord Randolph wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"THE CASTLE, DUBLIN.\r\n\r\n    '\"DEAR SIR CHARLES DILKE,\r\n\r\n    '\"Many thanks for your two letters. As you say, things remain in such\r\n    an uncertain state nothing can be done. The Government have too great\r\n    an advantage, but I think if we are led into taking any decisive steps\r\n    hostile to Russia, a great effort should be made for an authoritative\r\n    declaration that the ultimate aim and object of any move on our part\r\n    is the complete freedom and independence of the Slav nationality, as\r\n    opposed to any reconstruction of the Turkish Empire. This I am sure\r\n    should be the line for the Liberal party, and not the peace-at-any-\r\n    price cry which it is evident the country won't have. In this I shall\r\n    be ready to co-operate heartily as far as my poor efforts can be any\r\n    good. It is just possible that if any movement of this kind be made it\r\n    would be better for it to originate from the Conservative side of the\r\n    House. I regret to see so much excitement getting up among the masses.\r\n    It is dangerous matter for Beaconsfield to work on. Would you think me\r\n    very foolish or visionary if I say that I look for a republican form\r\n    of Government for Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, as far more to be\r\n    preferred than some German, Russian, or other Prince set up as a\r\n    puppet under the name of constitutional monarchy? Perhaps if these\r\n    ideas seem at all to your liking, and if you think they would command\r\n    the support of the Liberal party, you would advise me what appeared to\r\n    you the most favourable moment for bringing them forward.

Lord Granville's mistake in date was\r\n    characteristic, for, while a most able man who did not, in my opinion,\r\n    decline in intellectual vigour during the many years in which he took\r\n    a great part in public affairs, he always had the habit of\r\n    substitution of words, and I have known him carry on a long\r\n    conversation with me at the Foreign Office about the proceedings of\r\n    two Ambassadors who were engaged on the opposite sides in a great\r\n    negotiation, and call A \"B,\" and B \"A,\" through the whole of it, which\r\n    was, to say the least, confusing. He also sometimes entirely forgot\r\n    the principal name in connection with the subject, as, for example,\r\n    that of Mr. Gladstone when Prime Minister, and had to resort to the\r\n    most extraordinary forms of language in order to convey his meaning.\r\n\r\n    'Randolph wrote after his telegram from a fishing lodge on the Irish\r\n    Blackwater:\r\n\r\n    '\"MY DEAR SIR CHARLES,\r\n\r\n    '\"I have sent you a telegram which I think you will understand. I am\r\n    sure that my views, whatever they are worth, are in accordance with\r\n    your speech, and Harcourt's, and Gladstone's, on the question of the\r\n    future policy of this country. I am convinced that under the present\r\n    circumstances no motion should be unduly hastened on. There is lots of\r\n    time. If I was asked to move a resolution my speech would be an attack\r\n    on Chaplin, Wolff, and the rest of the Pro-Turkish party, confidence\r\n    in the Government and invitation to the Liberal party to act as a\r\n    whole. I feel I am awfully young to endeavour to initiate such a line;\r\n    but I am so convinced of the soundness of our views that I would risk\r\n    a smash willingly to have them properly brought forward. If only your\r\n    party would agree as a whole to support a resolution moved from my\r\n    side, the Government would only at the best have a majority of 80,\r\n    after 190, and that would be a check. I shall see Butt before arriving\r\n    in London, and endeavour to make him take up a position upon this\r\n    question.

I\r\n    think the Conservative party are gone mad. Their speeches are\r\n    calculated to provoke war. As it is so uncertain whether we shall go\r\n    to war or to a Conference, I think I had better wait a little, as,\r\n    though the motion should, I think, be made in any case, the terms of\r\n    it would vary very much according to either alternative....

But instantly the trouble broke out again. The\r\nBritish Government claimed that this new treaty, since it altered the\r\nEuropean settlement ratified in 1856 by the Treaty of Paris, must be\r\nsubmitted to and endorsed by a Congress of the Powers. Russia declined to\r\nbe thus bound, and a new crisis arose in which Lord Derby, who had\r\nwithdrawn his previous resignation, now finally gave up the Secretaryship\r\nof Foreign Affairs, being succeeded by Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Sir Charles, while Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, became\r\naware that Lord Derby's retention of office after his first resignation\r\nhad been little more than nominal. He says in the Memoir for that year:\r\n\r\n    'In the course of my researches among the Tunis papers I discovered\r\n    the curious fact that in February and March, 1878, foreign affairs\r\n    were being conducted by a committee of the Cabinet, consisting of Lord\r\n    Beaconsfield, Lord Cairns, and Lord Salisbury, and that Lord Derby,\r\n    the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was virtually shelved for\r\n    the whole period. At this moment Lord Beaconsfield proposed the\r\n    creation of a Mediterranean league for the maintenance of the _status\r\n    quo_ in the Mediterranean: England, France, Italy, and Greece to be\r\n    first consulted, and Austria to come in afterwards if she pleased.\r\n    Italy declining, the scheme collapsed. Foolish Italy!'\r\n\r\nWhile in Parliament the Tory party was ridding itself of its 'peace men,'\r\nparty feeling out of doors ran to unusual heights. These were the days\r\nwhen a music-hall song added a word to the political vocabulary, and the\r\n\"jingo\" crowd signalized its patriotism by wrecking Mr. Gladstone's\r\nwindows at 73, Harley Street, where he went to live after his retirement\r\nfrom the Liberal leadership.\r\n\r\n'On Sunday, March 10th, in coming back from the Grosvenor Gallery, I\r\npassed a great mob, who were going to howl at Mr. Gladstone--at this time\r\nthe ordinary Sunday afternoon diversion of the London rough.'\r\n\r\nSchouvalof, the Russian Ambassador, had on March 4th summed up the\r\nsituation in an epigram: \"England has challenged Russia to a duel, and has\r\nchosen for her weapon swords at fifteen paces\" (_l'épée à quinze pas_).\r\nBut the preparations for this combat were menacing.\r\n\r\n    'On March 29th the Eastern Question blazed up again with Lord Derby's\r\n    resignation, the discussion of which enlivened a party at Lady\r\n    Waldegrave's, there being before us a Queen's Message alleging the\r\n    existence of imminent national danger and great emergency as a reason\r\n    for calling out the reserves. On Saturday the 30th Trevelyan ...\r\n    informed me of a resolution which had been prepared by Lubbock on\r\n    behalf of those Whigs who had not gone with Gladstone, but wished to\r\n    make some movement of their own. Later in the evening I saw Childers,\r\n    who proposed a better motion in the form of an addition to the Message\r\n    in the sense of a strong desire for peace. The object of both\r\n    suggestions, of course, was by a moderate middle course to prevent a\r\n    division for and against the Message in which Gladstone and Bright and\r\n    eighty others would vote No, while eighty would follow Hartington in\r\n    voting Yes, and the majority of the party run away, thus destroying\r\n    the Liberal party, as it was destroyed in the time of Pitt and the war\r\n    with France. Later, again, in the evening I saw Montgélas (who told me\r\n    that Russia had held different language to Austria and to England, and\r\n    that she had drawn back and did not mean war) [Footnote: 'On February\r\n    9th I went to a party at the Austrian Embassy \"to meet the Archduke\r\n    Rudolf.\" Beust was gone away and Montgélas was host. ... On February\r\n    12th I met again the Crown Prince of Austria.'] and Randolph\r\n    Churchill, who made an appointment to come to me on Sunday about the\r\n    papers, which he agreed with me in thinking damaging to the\r\n    Government, and full of evidence of their total isolation. When he\r\n    came, we decided only that the Government ought to be asked for\r\n    further papers.'\r\n\r\nThis demand Sir Charles accordingly made on April 1st. His position was at\r\nthis point extremely difficult. He was not prepared to acquiesce in the\r\naggrandisement of Russia, and therefore could not go with his habitual\r\nassociates, who had formed a Committee upon the Eastern Question. On the\r\nother hand, he was determined to join with them in opposing the calling\r\nout of the reserves, because this step implied that England would go to\r\nwar alone, and he did not believe either that England was likely to do so,\r\nor that she ought, as a member of the European Concert, to take such a\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n    'There was a moment after the fall of Lord Derby when I became a\r\n    supporter of the Government in their Eastern policy, for they appeared\r\n    to me to adopt my own, but it did not last long. \"Lord Salisbury's\r\n    circular\" (so-called, but written by Lord Cairns), issued upon the\r\n    accession of Lord Salisbury to the Foreign Office, contained the\r\n    statement of this policy. ... Speaking in the House on April 9th ...,\r\n    I repudiated the defence which came from some on the Liberal side, of\r\n    the conduct of Russia, and, looking upon the Government despatch as a\r\n    vindication primarily of general European interests, and, in the\r\n    second place, of Hellenic interests, against Russian violence and\r\n    universal Slav dominion throughout the Levant, I separated myself from\r\n    my party and praised the new Minister of Foreign Affairs. I was\r\n    afterwards bitterly disappointed at finding the policy of the April\r\n    circular abandoned by its authors in the Congress of Berlin. ...\r\n\r\n    'On April 4th Gennadius, the Greek Chargé d'Affaires (afterwards\r\n    Minister), the American Minister, Matthew Arnold, W. E. Forster, Grant\r\n    Duff, Lubbock, George Sheffield (Lord Lyons' factotum), Tom Hughes,\r\n    and my old friend Sir David Wedderburn dined with me. And in this Whig\r\n    and Hellenic party a general agreement with my views was met with; but\r\n    the same was not the case amongst my brother Radicals of \"Mr.\r\n    Dillwyn's Committee upon the Eastern Question.\"'\r\n\r\nThis Radical organization got into difficulties of its own while\r\ncontemplating a motion to condemn explicitly the calling out of the\r\nreserves.\r\n\r\n    'On April 5th Dillwyn's Committee had had before it a letter from Lord\r\n    Hartington, saying that Mr. Gladstone on Monday wished to speak next\r\n    after Sir Stafford Northcote, and to deprecate the moving of an\r\n    amendment. It was in consequence resolved by a majority that no\r\n    amendment should be moved. Courtney then said that the intimation of\r\n    Mr. Gladstone's opinion had been obtained from him by gross pressure,\r\n    and that he himself should move an amendment if no one else did.\r\n    Wilfrid Lawson then said that he would move; and there were seven in\r\n    favour of an amendment. This broke up the Committee, and on Dillwyn\r\n    reporting to Hartington its dissolution, the latter said: \"Well, Mr.\r\n    Dillwyn, you see it is not so easy to lead.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, April 7th, there dined with me, among others, Hartington,\r\n    Harcourt, Goschen, Lord Granville, and Lord Ripon, and we discussed\r\n    the position, on which Lord Ripon was far from agreement with me. I\r\n    warmly supported to them the Government circular (issued by Lord\r\n    Salisbury), as putting British action on European rather than on\r\n    British-interests grounds, and only differed from the policy of\r\n    calling out the reserves because this was an action of isolation.'\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Wilfrid Lawson's amendment was moved, Sir Charles voted with the\r\nRadical minority of sixty-four against calling out the reserves, but\r\n'differed from every word in which the Radical speakers supported their\r\nview.'\r\n\r\nThe pith of his speech was a powerful plea for allowing Greece to secure\r\nthe emancipation of Greek populations, then under a Turkish rule heavy as\r\nthat from which Russia claimed to liberate the Slavs of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nSo far, the action of the Government had not united the Liberal party in\r\nany concentrated attitude of resistance. But during the Easter recess,\r\nwhich Sir Charles spent in France, meeting Gambetta, politics took a more\r\ndramatic turn.\r\n\r\n    'When Parliament adjourned for the holidays, not one word had been\r\n    said of an act long previously determined, which was announced the\r\n    next day. The fact that Parliament was allowed to learn from the\r\n    newspapers that it was intended by the Government for the first time\r\n    to employ Indian troops within the European dominions of the Crown in\r\n    time of peace, without the previous consent of Parliament, [Footnote:\r\n    By despatching 7,000 Sepoys to Malta.] was a singular commentary upon\r\n    the Government declaration at the beginning of the Session that\r\n    Parliament had been called together at an unusually early date in\r\n    order that under circumstances of delicacy the Ministry might have the\r\n    advantage of its advice.... Public feeling, I found from Chamberlain,\r\n    had gone round a good deal during my absence, and to satisfy the\r\n    opinion of our Radicals he was determined to move something. I\r\n    suggested to him (on May 6th) a resolution condemning \"the policy of\r\n    menace and warlike demonstration which has been pursued by the\r\n    Government,\" and expressing the belief \"that an honourable and\r\n    peaceful settlement of existing difficulties will be best promoted by\r\n    their consenting to state frankly the changes in the Treaty of San\r\n    Stefano which they consider necessary for the general good of Europe\r\n    and the interests of this country.\"'\r\n\r\nBut already the Government were in secret negotiation with Russia, and had\r\nentered into an agreement as to the modification of the provisions of the\r\nTreaty of San Stefano. Amongst other changes it was proposed to curtail\r\nthe limits of Bulgaria by a division severing South from North, and to\r\nallow Austria-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and the Herzegovina.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, May 7th, after the Radical Club, at a party at the\r\n    Harcourts', I learned what the Government intended to do at the\r\n    Conference or Congress--namely, limit Bulgaria on the south by the\r\n    Balkans. But I was informed at the same time that they would\r\n    themselves propose to give Thessaly and Epirus to Greece, an\r\n    undertaking which I think they did give to the King of Greece, but\r\n    from which, if so, they afterwards departed. The Greek Patriarch from\r\n    Constantinople came over at this time, as did the Armenian Patriarch\r\n    shortly afterwards, and I met both, although conversation with these\r\n    dignitaries was not easy, for their French was about as feeble as my\r\n    Greek; but through Gennadius I, of course, knew the views of the\r\n    Greeks, and in the Armenian question I took no special part.'\r\n\r\nThe question of employing the Indian troops was debated on May 20th. Lord\r\nHartington opened; and Sir Charles replied to Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who\r\nfollowed Lord Hartington. Concerning the discussion, he says:\r\n\r\n    'The technical point which we argued was a narrow one. Had Cyprus been\r\n    in Asia, our arguments would not have applied to Cyprus; and it is\r\n    very likely that the Government thought Cyprus was in Asia, and did\r\n    not like to say that they had made a mistake, and having first ordered\r\n    the troops to Cyprus, and then ordered them to Malta (which was\r\n    undoubtedly in Europe), had forgotten the distinction. The real\r\n    objection to the bringing of the Sepoys was the same as the objection\r\n    to the calling out of the reserves--that it was isolated action, and\r\n    that these military measures and the expenditure which they involved\r\n    were mere bunkum, and mere waste if the Government intended to give\r\n    up, as they were secretly telling Russia they did intend to give up,\r\n    the main points of dispute. Moreover, Russia could do us hurt in\r\n    India, and Indian troops could not touch her at all....\r\n\r\n    'The Government were said to have only \"conquered by giving way,\" for\r\n    they agreed to put the number of men into the Estimate, and thus avoid\r\n    making a precedent, according to our contention, absolutely\r\n    unconstitutional. On the other hand, Lord Beaconsfield's speech in the\r\n    House of Lords was defiant in the extreme, and Holker's [Footnote: The\r\n    Attorney-General.] in the Lower House was an assertion of higher\r\n    prerogative doctrine than had been heard in Parliament since the days\r\n    of Elizabeth.'\r\n\r\n    'On May 30th I dined with Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, and met Lord\r\n    Northbrook (the former Viceroy of India) and his daughter, Lady Emma\r\n    Baring, Lord Rosebery, Lord and Lady Napier (he a most distinguished\r\n    man, the best of Ambassadors to Russia and the best of Governors of\r\n    Madras, too little known),[Footnote: Baron Napier and Ettrick.] Lord\r\n    Macduff (afterwards Duke of Fife), and Monty Corry, afterwards Lord\r\n    Rowton, Lord Beaconsfield's private secretary.' Corry 'told me what\r\n    was at the moment a startling secret--that Lord Beaconsfield was going\r\n    to the Congress himself. \"Can he speak French?\" I asked with wonder,\r\n    to which he shook his head.'\r\n\r\nOn the day after the meeting of the Congress a sensational disclosure\r\nrevealed to the world that it met; only to register foregone conclusions.\r\n\r\n    'At the end of the month (May) the secret agreement was signed with\r\n    Russia, and revealed to us by the _Globe_ [Footnote: The Globe\r\n    disclosure came from Mr. Marvin, a civil servant in temporary employ.\r\n    Dilke noted: \"Besides the 'Marvin Memorandum' and an annex, there was\r\n    a curious stipulation insisted on by Russia, that the annex should\r\n    never be published, even if No. 1--that is, the 'Marvin Memorandum'--\r\n    should become public; and this looks very much as though Marvin was\r\n    really the Russian Government, which I have always suspected. They had\r\n    this to gain by publishing the Memorandum--that they showed themselves\r\n    the real victors in the Congress of Berlin, in spite of all our\r\n    bluster, and they damaged Lord Beaconsfield, who was their enemy.\r\n    Marvin could never have got a copy, and always pretended that he had\r\n    learned the whole document by heart, which, considering its length and\r\n    the total absence in the copy published in the _Globe_ of the\r\n    slightest error, even of punctuation, is incredible. The annex, which\r\n    was dated May 31st, only said that the Russians had no intention of\r\n    extending their conquests in Asiatic Turkey: 'The Emperor of Russia\r\n    ... not having the intention of extending Ids conquests in Asia ...\r\n    the Imperial Government does not refuse to conclude with the British\r\n    Government a secret engagement for the purpose of reassuring it upon\r\n    this point.'\"] on June 14th; and it then appeared that the military\r\n    preparations of the country must have been intended to keep up the\r\n    spirits of the Jingoes while their cherished principles were being\r\n    sacrificed behind their backs. The _Daily Telegraph_, which was the\r\n    Jingo organ, said: \"If _such_ a compact has been concluded, this\r\n    country has fatally descended from the lofty position occupied by the\r\n    Salisbury despatch.\" Not only was the compact authentic, but there\r\n    were two other secret compacts of the same date which did not come\r\n    out. What the Government had done was to give up all the points for\r\n    which they had made their enthusiastic followers believe that they\r\n    would fight, and at the same time in the Anglo-Turkish Convention to\r\n    declare that their successors should fight for what was left. This may\r\n    have been a prudent policy, but it was not a policy which carried with\r\n    it the necessity for bringing Indian troops to Europe or spending\r\n    eight or nine millions sterling upon apparent preparations for\r\n    immediate war. The third agreement, in addition to the Salisbury-\r\n    Schouvalof agreement and the Anglo-Turkish Convention, the first of\r\n    which came out by chance and the second of which was ultimately\r\n    published by the Government, was an Anglo-Austrian secret agreement\r\n    which has never been printed, the character of which is revealed by\r\n    the fact that the English plenipotentiaries themselves proposed at\r\n    Berlin, in spite of the strong dissent of Turkey, to make to Austria\r\n    the gift of Bosnia and Herzegovina.'\r\n\r\nTo this note, written in 1890, there is added in the margin of the\r\nmanuscript: 'There was also a secret supplementary agreement with Russia,\r\nof which later.' And also this: \"The compact giving Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nto Austria is now (1908) known to Lucien Wolf.\" [Footnote: See Thomas\r\nErskine Holland, _The European Concert in the Eastern Question_, 292,\r\n293.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Berlin Congress met, Sir Charles had pressed by way of\r\nquestions to secure if possible a representation for Greece at the\r\nCongress, and failed; and the speech which he made in the debate (opened\r\non July 29th) on the Treaty of Berlin was mainly a censure on Great\r\nBritain for having failed to support the Hellenic claims. He dwelt\r\nspecially on Crete, the government of which by Turkey was, he said, \"a\r\nperpetual menace to European peace.\"\r\n\r\nReplying in the debate for the Liberal party to Mr. David Plunket\r\n(afterwards Lord Rathmore), he notes that he\r\n\r\n    'spoke, and spoke well, making the best of my debating speeches, but\r\n    was overshadowed by one speech which would have caused better speeches\r\n    than mine to have been easily forgotten. Mr. Gladstone's speech on\r\n    this occasion, like all his speeches, does not read; but it was the\r\n    finest that I ever heard him make with one exception--the Bradlaugh\r\n    speech in the next Parliament.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND PERSONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's first concern was with foreign affairs, but he was\r\nalso of high authority in whatever related to the business and management\r\nof the House of Commons; and at this period the question of remodelling\r\nforms which lent themselves to the arts of delay began to be urgent, and\r\nthreatened to become paramount. Here, early in 1878, is the first\r\nconsiderable mention of the man whose relentless use of obstruction has\r\naffected parliamentary procedure all over the world:\r\n\r\n    'On February 20th I was asked by Lord Hartington to serve upon the\r\n    Government Select Committee on the business and forms of the House,\r\n    upon which Parnell was asked to represent the obstructive element. It\r\n    was somewhat a distinction, as I was to be the sole representative of\r\n    the English independent members, and in consequence I gave up the\r\n    Standing Committee on Commons, upon which I asked Fitzmaurice to\r\n    replace me. The proceedings of Sir Stafford Northcote's Committee, as\r\n    the Committee on Public Business was called, presented only one\r\n    singularity--namely, the examination of the Speaker--a prolonged one--\r\n    by Parnell. Both of them were in a way able men; but both were\r\n    extraordinarily slow of intellect--that is, slow in appreciating a\r\n    point or catching a new idea--and Mr. Brand (as he then was) and\r\n    Parnell used to face one another in inarticulate despair in the\r\n    attempt to understand each the other's meaning. There were a good many\r\n    fairly stupid men on the Committee, but there was not a single member\r\n    of it who did not understand what Parnell meant by a question more\r\n    quickly than could the Speaker, and not a man who could not understand\r\n    what the Speaker meant by a reply more quickly than Parnell.'\r\n\r\n    'With Speaker Brand I afterwards had a singular connection.\r\n\r\n    'At the time when the President of the Free State, whose name was also\r\n    Brand, had rendered important services to the British Government, I\r\n    made one of the briefest of my brief minutes and put it in a box, and\r\n    sent it round the Cabinet: \"I think Brand should be knighted.--Ch's W.\r\n    D.\" Nearly all the members of the Cabinet having added their initials\r\n    in approval, Brand was knighted, but the wrong Brand, for they gave\r\n    the G.C.B. to the Speaker, and it was only some time afterwards that\r\n    the G.C.M.G. was conferred on the South African statesman. I had not\r\n    thought of the Speaker, and Mr. Gladstone or his private secretary,\r\n    Edward Hamilton, had forgotten the Free State. What may have been the\r\n    frame of mind of the various members of the Cabinet who approved my\r\n    suggestion I do not know, but some probably meant the one and some\r\n    probably meant the other, and no one remembered that there were two.'\r\n\r\nConcerning the proposals which Sir Stafford Northcote was contemplating as\r\nthe result of the Committee on Public Business, but not in exact\r\naccordance with its decisions, Sir Charles notes, under June 25th, that he\r\nwas not in agreement with the mass of the Liberal party.\r\n\r\n    'Our men were inclined to oppose all proposals for closure by\r\n    majorities, and for investing the Speaker with large powers, while I\r\n    was beginning to feel as strongly favourable to such proposals as I\r\n    afterwards became. My \"record\" upon this subject constituted,\r\n    therefore, almost as \"sharp a curve\" as that of others. As a rule I\r\n    have not greatly changed my mind upon political subjects, but upon\r\n    this one (as upon Africa [Footnote: See Chapter XVI., p. 238, and also\r\n    Chapter XLVIII, (Vol. II., pp. 251-2).]) I undoubtedly turned round,\r\n    and did so in consequence of the full consideration which I had to\r\n    give it in the course of this single year.'\r\n\r\nIn the same year Sir Charles had secured support of Tory metropolitan\r\nmembers, whose constituents were affected, for his Bill to extend the\r\nhours of polling in London; and it passed before the end of January as an\r\nagreed measure. Then came another advance:\r\n\r\n    'On February 27th, at the most important sitting of my Committee on\r\n    the Registration Bills, which had three Bills before it, mine being\r\n    one; and Martin, who had charge of the Conservative Bill, being in the\r\n    Chair, with a Conservative majority on the Committee, Martin's Bill\r\n    was rejected, and mine adopted by the Committee on a division as a\r\n    base for its proceedings. I at once decided that I would hand over my\r\n    Bill to Martin, so as to let him have charge of it, as Chairman of the\r\n    Committee, as the Bill of the Committee.'\r\n\r\nThis was designed not so much to insure the passage of his own Bill as 'to\r\nprevent Martin from carrying a mere bit of a Bill with some of the things\r\nin it which we wanted.' But, 'to the amazement of everyone,' Sir Charles's\r\nmeasure, under its new sponsorship, actually passed, and 'became law in\r\n1878, and ultimately added an enormous number of voters to the franchise\r\nrolls.'\r\n\r\nBy June 7th the Registration Bill was read a third time, and\r\n\r\n    'My Hours of Polling Bill had now become \"Dilke's Act,\" and I felt as\r\n    though I was making such progress towards the political reforms I had\r\n    long advocated that there might be some faint chance that one day\r\n    redistribution itself might be accomplished.'\r\n\r\nSix years later he himself carried out redistribution and extension of the\r\nsuffrage on a scale hardly dreamed of by politicians in 1878. Already, in\r\nthe debate of February 22nd, when Sir Charles, as usual, seconded Mr.\r\nTrevelyan's annual motion on the equalization of voting power, the\r\ndivision was better than ever before, and the _Annual Register_, which a\r\nfew years earlier had known nothing but contempt and aversion for this\r\nRadical group, devoted considerable space to the arguments by which reform\r\nwas supported, with full reference to Sir Charles's speech. Mr. Goschen\r\nand Mr. Lowe were the only Liberals of note who opposed the motion--if,\r\nindeed, Mr. Lowe could still be called a Liberal--and Lord Hartington\r\nspoke for it.\r\n\r\nOne of Sir Charles's preoccupations at this moment was the choice of a\r\nLiberal candidate to stand for Chelsea with him, and the matter presented\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n    'Horace Davey ... was wishful to stand with us, and I had asked him to\r\n    a dinner at which he met some of the leading men, and later he called\r\n    on me to see whether he would \"do.\" In the meantime I had sounded our\r\n    best people, and found that he would not.... I told him at once that\r\n    he must vote against fresh dowries to the Royal Family until a Civil\r\n    List inquiry had been held, which ... sent him away.'\r\n\r\nAnother lawyer followed, and was shown off at several dinners, but 'the\r\nborough did not seem inclined to welcome Queen's Counsel,' and ultimately\r\nsettled, very much to its own satisfaction and Sir Charles's, on a great\r\nfriend, Mr. Firth.\r\n\r\nThe campaign in defence of open spaces was actively carried on this year,\r\nand in March Sir Charles was fighting on behalf of the Commons\r\nPreservation Society to resist the erection of a new cottage with an\r\nenclosure for the Deputy Ranger in Hyde Park. The cottage was erected, but\r\nSir Charles and his allies 'were ultimately able to get back a large part\r\nof the land which had been enclosed near it.' Another encroachment was\r\nresisted more successfully, and by other means. In Fulham 'the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners had made an enclosure shutting out the public\r\nfrom Eelbrook Common, the use of which it had enjoyed for many years.'\r\n\r\n    'I went to a meeting at Beaufort House, and made, as I thought, a\r\n    moderate speech recommending abstention from acts of violence, but one\r\n    at the close of which the meeting went off to the place, pulled down\r\n    the fence, and burnt it in a large bonfire. The enclosure was never\r\n    reasserted, and the ground was ultimately handed over to the\r\n    Metropolitan Board of Works to be managed as an open space, and is\r\n    open now for ever.... In Lord Eversley's _Commons_, revised edition of\r\n    1910, he names my services to the \"cause,\" but not _this_ one.'\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Session\r\n\r\n    'On September 4th I addressed my constituents, and received an ovation\r\n    in consequence of the passing of the Hours of Polling Bill (letting\r\n    them vote till eight in the evening instead of four) and of my\r\n    Registration Bill. Vast numbers of electors had been disfranchised by\r\n    the former hours, who were able now to record their votes. My\r\n    Registration Act was only to come into force in the course of the\r\n    following year, and was to affect the next registration and revision.\r\n\r\n    'Turning to foreign affairs, I pointed out the absolute impossibility\r\n    of the fulfilment of the promises which the Government had made to\r\n    give to Asiatic Turkey \"rest from the heavy weight of military\r\n    service, rest from the uncertainty of unjust Judges and persons placed\r\n    in command.\" I went on to discuss the Greek question, which I had to\r\n    do somewhat fully, because the Greek Committee was at present only\r\n    operating in the dark, and had not made known its constitution to the\r\n    public. [Footnote: He made in this year the acquaintance of\r\n    'Delyannis, Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was a very inferior\r\n    man to his great rival, Tricoupis.']\r\n\r\n    'Two days after my speech, on September 6th, I learnt that the Greek\r\n    Government had decided to recognize the insurgent Debt of 1824. People\r\n    often talk of the possibilities of Ministers speculating on the Stock\r\n    Exchange on secret information. It is a curious and perhaps an\r\n    interesting fact that during the more than five years that I was in\r\n    office I do not think that any official information came into my hands\r\n    the possession of which would have enabled any Minister to make money\r\n    on the Stock Exchange, although a private secretary was charged with\r\n    the offence during those years--most unjustly charged. On the other\r\n    hand, it is the case that on at least two occasions when I was a\r\n    private member of Parliament, before I had held office, I had secret\r\n    information of a certain kind upon which I might have speculated, and\r\n    which very probably was given me with the intention that I should do\r\n    so. This was one of the two occasions. The other was my knowledge of\r\n    the financial intervention in Egypt before it took place. [Footnote:\r\n    He knew this from something said to him by Nubar Pasha.]\r\n\r\n    'The Greek information of September 6th reached me in Paris, whither I\r\n    had gone on the day after my speech, and to which I was followed by\r\n    very favourable criticism upon it. Gambetta, with whom I breakfasted\r\n    on the 6th, told me that Lord Salisbury, who had been in Paris, had\r\n    come there with a view to reopen the Egyptian question, but had not\r\n    received encouragement.\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, September 12th, I breakfasted with Gambetta in the\r\n    country, he coming to fetch me at the Grand Hotel, and driving me down\r\n    in a victoria. We talked partly of Egypt, partly of people.'\r\n\r\nThat autumn Sir Charles spent in the South of France, still working on his\r\nHistory. [Footnote: _History of the Nineteenth Century_. See Chapter XI.,\r\np. 154; also Chapter LX. (Vol. II., p. 537).] His son, then four years\r\nold, used to be with him at La Sainte Campagne, Cap Brun, his house near\r\nToulon. In November a new crisis arose. 'There seemed a chance of war with\r\nRussia about the Afghan complications,' and Sir Charles proposed to his\r\nbrother Ashton that, 'in the event of Russia's entry on the war, he should\r\nbring out a daily halfpenny noonday paper, to give, on a small sheet, news\r\nonly, and not opinions. At that time evening papers could not be bought\r\ntill four o'clock, and the idea was discussed between us until it became\r\nclear that we were only going to fight Afghans, and not Russians.'\r\n\r\nThe situation was serious enough to demand an autumn Session, because the\r\nbeginnings of the war were directly connected with Russian action. After\r\nthe Queen had assumed her new title of Empress of India, Lord Lytton was\r\ninstructed to propose a Mission to the Amir. But the Amir, who had\r\npreviously declined to admit surveying parties of British officers, now\r\nrefused this. In the spring of 1878, when war threatened between England\r\nand Russia, the Russian Government also proposed an Embassy to Kabul, and\r\nalthough they likewise met with a refusal, the Mission was despatched and\r\nreached Kabul.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Government now saw themselves under a slight; Russia's Mission\r\nhad been received, theirs had been refused entrance. Peremptorily they\r\nrenewed their request. No answer was returned; the Mission set out, and\r\nwas stopped by armed force. Declaration of war followed, and by November\r\n20th British troops had crossed the frontier. Invasion of Afghanistan was\r\nin full progress when Parliament assembled.\r\n\r\nSir Charles saw Gambetta on December 3rd, and returned to England, and by\r\nthe 4th was discussing at the Radical Club the course to be taken on the\r\nAddress. In his travels he had visited the north-west frontier of India.\r\nIt was settled that he should speak, but, as he notes, the debate in the\r\nCommons 'was swamped by that in the Lords,' and, further, 'I found myself\r\nonce again in a difficulty on the Afghan question, as I had been on the\r\nEastern Question, that of not agreeing with either side.'\r\n\r\nLord Hartington, as usual, had been prompt in the assurance of patriotic\r\nsupport for a Government actually engaged in war; Mr. Gladstone was\r\npassionate in denunciation of the war itself. Between these poles Sir\r\nCharles had to steer, and the pith of his speech was a charge against the\r\nGovernment that they were punishing the Afghans for having submitted to a\r\nviolent act of aggression perpetrated by Russia.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, December 10th, I spoke in the debate, doing my best to\r\n    calm down a revolt which had broken out below the gangway against\r\n    Hartington for not having countenanced an amendment to the Address,\r\n    and for having made on the Address a speech supposed to be too\r\n    friendly to the Government.\r\n\r\n    'On the other hand, Edward Jenkins, [Footnote: Author of _Ginx's\r\n    Baby_.] who called himself a Radical, and who was a strong\r\n    Imperialist, was busy drawing amendments which were mere pretexts for\r\n    voting with the Government, and I noted in my diary my despair at\r\n    finding such men blaming Hartington for going too far, when\r\n    Chamberlain was blaming him for not going far enough. While I was\r\n    speaking on the 10th Wilfrid Lawson passed to me his copy of the\r\n    Orders of the Day, bearing at the head the lines:\r\n\r\n       '\"Lord Salisbury once was the 'master of jeers,\r\n           But now he has met with disaster;\r\n       For, on reading the Blue Book, it plainly appears\r\n           That Giers is Lord Salisbury's master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    The lines were excellent, and I burst out laughing in the middle of my\r\n    speech. Giers was the new Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and\r\n    the phrase quoted in Lawson's first line was, of course, an abridgment\r\n    of Mr. Disraeli's memorable quotation from Shakespeare about his\r\n    colleague, and the four lines formed a summary of my speech....\r\n    [Footnote: On August 5th, 1874, Disraeli, speaking in the debate on\r\n    the Lords' disagreement to certain amendments made by the House of\r\n    Commons in the Public Worship Regulation Bill, had described Lord\r\n    Salisbury as \"a great master of gibes and flouts and jeers.\"] It came\r\n    out clearly in these debates that Northcote had not expected war, and\r\n    that Lord Lytton had acted directly under the instructions of the\r\n    Prime Minister, and had not only expected, but intended it. I called\r\n    Lord Lytton in my speech \"a diplomatist rather than a Viceroy, a\r\n    Secretary of Legation rather than a ruler of men.\" This was not\r\n    intended for abuse, but to bring the House to see him as I had seen\r\n    him in my knowledge of him as Secretary at Paris, in order to show\r\n    that he had been sent out to India to be an instrument--obedient to a\r\n    policy dictated to him from home.' [Footnote: Sir Charles had been\r\n    staying with the Commander-in-Chief at Madras, General Haines,\r\n    afterwards Field-Marshal, in January, 1876, when the news came of Lord\r\n    Lytton's appointment as Governor-General. 'The old soldier absolutely\r\n    refused to credit the information, being a strong Conservative, and\r\n    unwilling to admit that Mr. Disraeli could have been guilty of so\r\n    extraordinary a mistake.']\r\n\r\nThis Afghan War, so lightly begun, and fraught with so much disaster, was\r\nthe first of a series of events which sapped the credit of the Government\r\nthat had triumphantly claimed to bring back \"peace with honour\" from the\r\nCongress of Berlin.\r\n\r\nSome intimate aspects of that gathering are preserved in Sir Charles's\r\naccount of a dinner-party at Sir William Harcourt's house on December\r\n11th, the guests including the Russian Ambassador, who had been one of the\r\nplenipotentiaries.\r\n\r\n    'Schouvalof was very funny. He gave us a fancy picture of the whole\r\n    Congress of Berlin. He described almost every member of the Congress,\r\n    standing up at the table speaking English when he did Lord\r\n    Beaconsfield, and mimicking the Prime Minister's grave manner, with\r\n    absurdly comical effect. At last he came to Lord Salisbury, who,\r\n    according to him, spoke bad French. He made Lord Salisbury coin an\r\n    extraordinary phrase, at which he himself (Schouvalof), all the\r\n    Frenchmen, and Gortschakof, shrugged their shoulders with one accord.\r\n    Lord Salisbury turned fiercely round, and asked what was the matter\r\n    with it, to which Saint-Vallier replied that \"there was nothing the\r\n    matter with it except that it was not French.\" \"Not French?\" said Lord\r\n    Salisbury, and rang the electric bell by the button in front of him,\r\n    and when the door was opened, holding up his hand to show the\r\n    messenger who had rung, said: \"Fetch Mr. Currie.\" Philip Currie\r\n    appeared at the door, bowing deeply, whereon Lord Salisbury read his\r\n    phrase to him, and said, \"Mr. Currie, is that good French?\" to which\r\n    Currie replied, \"Excellent French, my lord;\" whereon Lord Salisbury\r\n    turned, said Schouvalof, \"to our French colleagues, and said:\r\n    'There!'\" Schouvalof carried on violent discussions between Lord\r\n    Beaconsfield, speaking English, and Gortschakof, speaking French,\r\n    about various boundary questions, and brought in Bismarck every minute\r\n    or two as a chorus, the Chancellor stalking up and down the room with\r\n    his arms folded, and growling in a deep voice: \"Eh bien, messieurs,\r\n    arrangez-vous; car, si vous ne vous arrangez pas, demain je pars pour\r\n    Kissingen.\" Under this Bismarckian pressure Schouvalof, after making\r\n    us shriek for half an hour, brought his Congress to an end.... In a\r\n    confidential talk with me afterwards Schouvalof said: \"I have known\r\n    many rude people, but I never knew anyone so rude as was Bismarck at\r\n    the Congress. I happened to name our poor clients, the Montenegrins,\r\n    when Bismarck roared at me: \"Je ne veux pas entendre parler de ces\r\n    gens-là.\" Schouvalof also said of our relations with the Afghans: \"You\r\n    don't understand dealing with Orientals. Compare your letters to the\r\n    Amir and ours, published in your Blue-Book. We call him the Sun and\r\n    Moon, and you call him an 'earthen pipkin.'\" This last was an allusion\r\n    to the phrase used to the Amir, \"an earthen pipkin between two iron\r\n    pots,\" the iron pots being ourselves and Russia.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke in this year has record of meeting with many interesting\r\npersons, some of them links with a vanishing past, such as the daughter of\r\nHorace Smith, who with his brother wrote _Rejected Addresses_. Miss \"Tizy\"\r\nSmith was, he says,\r\n\r\n    'the last survivor of that school of noisy, frolicsome, boisterous old\r\n    ladies given to punning and banging people on the back; but she was\r\n    very witty, and, for those who had spirits to bear her spirits, most\r\n    entertaining. She was for many years known as the \"Queen of Brighton,\"\r\n    but her sway was not despotic.'\r\n\r\nIn February he\r\n\r\n    'dined with Lady Waldegrave to meet the Duc de Chartres--no better and\r\n    no worse than the other Princes of his house...., not excepting the\r\n    Duc d'Aumale, who had, however, the reputation of being brilliant, and\r\n    who ... was interesting from his great memory of great men. They all\r\n    grew deaf as they grew old, and the Comte de Paris is now (1890)\r\n    almost as deaf as the Prince de Joinville, who was put into the navy\r\n    in his youth, because, not hearing the big guns, he alone of all the\r\n    family was not frightened by them.'\r\n\r\nIn March, 1878, Gambetta sent to Dilke with an introduction 'Henri Hecht,\r\nwho was deep in his secrets, and in the habit from this time forward of\r\nvisiting for him Germany as well as England.' Going backwards and forwards\r\nto his house at Toulon, Sir Charles always broke the journey at Paris to\r\nsee Gambetta. He writes to Ashton Dilke:\r\n\r\n    \"Gambetta says that he shall say at Grenoble that MacMahon said:\r\n    'J'irai jusqu'au bout,' and that he must--_i.e._, he must complete his\r\n    term. He won't have him again. 'J'en ai assez d'une fois.'\"\r\n\r\nAt Easter Sir Charles was using his influence with Gambetta on behalf of a\r\ngreat artist who had been politically compromised in the troubles of 1871\r\n--Dalou the sculptor, who had done to Dilke's commission a copy in has-\r\nrelief of Flaxman's \"Mercury and Pandora.\"\r\n\r\n    'When I was leaving for Paris I had several interviews with Dalou as\r\n    to getting him leave to return to France without his asking for it. He\r\n    had been sub-curator of the Louvre under the Commune, and had helped\r\n    to preserve the collections from destruction; but after he fled the\r\n    country he had always refused to ask for leave to return, which, had\r\n    he asked, would at once have been granted to him. Gambetta always\r\n    insisted, when I spoke to him upon the matter, that Dalou should write\r\n    some letter, however private and however personal, to ask for leave to\r\n    return; but this was just what Dalou's pride would never let him do,\r\n    and although he was willing to ask me verbally, and even to refer to\r\n    the matter in a private letter to myself, he never would write about\r\n    it to anyone in France. Dalou was afterwards selected to make the\r\n    official statues of the Republic, and may be said to have become,\r\n    after the general amnesty, Sculptor-in-Ordinary to the Government of\r\n    France.'\r\n\r\nThere is a story of Count Beust's difficulties when the Empress of Austria\r\nsuddenly asked herself to dine with him at the Austrian Embassy at six on\r\nSunday, at twenty-four hours' notice. Beust's cook was out of town; but\r\nworse was the difficulty of finding guests of adequate importance. The\r\nPrince of Wales had a dinner-party of his own at Marlborough House, so\r\nrecourse was had to another Royal couple, the Duke and Duchess of Teck.\r\nThey were engaged to the Marlborough House dinner, but suggested a heroic\r\nexpedient. \"Why not dine with you at six, and go on at a quarter-past\r\neight and dine again!\" So it was settled.\r\n\r\nAn eccentric dinner took place at 76, Sloane Street, when the Maharajah of\r\nJohore returned the visit which Sir Charles had paid him in his States\r\nnear Singapore. Lord Randolph Churchill and other people interested in\r\nIndia were among the guests, and the Maharajah brought his own cook, who\r\nprepared enough for all, so that the guests had their choice of two menus.\r\nThe host took the Maharajah's, 'which was good but rich,' and 'suffered,\r\nas did all who ate his garlics and his grease.'\r\n\r\n    'On March 21st I breakfasted with Lord Granville to meet Lord Lyons,\r\n    there being also there Lord Ripon, Lord Acton (a man of great learning\r\n    and much charm), Lord Carlingford (Chichester Fortescue that had\r\n    been), Grant Duff, Sir Thomas Wade (the great Chinese scholar, and\r\n    afterwards Professor of Chinese at Cambridge), Lefevre, Meredith\r\n    Townsend of the _Spectator_, old Charles Howard, and \"old White,\"\r\n    roaring with that terrible roar which seems almost necessary to go\r\n    with his appearance. I have known two men, both in the Foreign Office\r\n    service, that looked like bears--Lord Tenterden, [Footnote: Permanent\r\n    Under-Secretary of State, afterwards Dilke's colleague at the Foreign\r\n    Office.] a little black graminivorous European bear, and \"old White,\"\r\n    a polar bear if ever I saw one, always ready to hug his enemies or his\r\n    friends, and always roaring so as to shake the foundations of your\r\n    house. \"Lord Lyons,\" I noted in my diary, \"does not make any mark in\r\n    private, but that may be because he does his duty and holds his\r\n    tongue. The diplomatists who talk delightfully, like Odo Russell, are\r\n    perhaps not the best models of diplomacy.\" But White afterwards made a\r\n    great Ambassador.\r\n\r\n    'On March 3rd Goschen dined with me, asked by me to meet \"Brett,\r\n    Hartington's new secretary\"' (now Lord Esher). 'Reginald Brett was,\r\n    and is, an extremely pleasant fellow, and he was the ablest secretary,\r\n    except Edward Hamilton, that I ever came across; but he was far from\r\n    being a model secretary, because ... he always behaved as if he held\r\n    delegated authority from Hartington to represent Hartington's\r\n    conscience when it would not otherwise have moved, and \"Hartington's\r\n    opinion\" when the chief had none.... But Brett in all he did had\r\n    public ends in view....\r\n\r\n    'On July 30th I dined at a dinner given by a lion-hunter who managed\r\n    to get together some remarkable and some pleasant people--Cardinal\r\n    Manning, Ruskin, Greenwood, and Borthwick. But whether it was the\r\n    influence of the host, or whether it was because Manning did not like\r\n    his company except me, and Ruskin did not like his company at all, the\r\n    dinner was a failure. No one talked but Ruskin, and he prosed, and his\r\n    prose of speech was not his prose of pen. Manning wished to see me\r\n    about some education matter, and I called on him on August 2nd, and\r\n    from that time forward saw a good deal of the Cardinal.'\r\n\r\nNext came members of what was to be the Fourth Party, although then\r\n'isolated individuals.' In February Sir Charles had a long talk with Sir\r\nHenry Drummond Wolff, and 'found him holding very different views upon\r\nforeign affairs from those which afterwards united him with his future\r\nleader. In fact, he had nothing at this moment in common with Lord\r\nRandolph except a personal detestation of Lord Derby.'\r\n\r\nSir John Gorst had acted with Sir Charles to preserve the rights of native\r\nraces, especially the Maories; and thus a friendship had grown up, in\r\nwhich Dilke was anxious to include Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'On July 26th Chamberlain dined with me to meet Richard Power, the new\r\n    Irish Whip, and Gorst, the latter soon afterwards to join with\r\n    Randolph Churchill in the formation of the memorable Fourth Party, and\r\n    to be known as \"Randolph's Attorney-General.\" Many years afterwards,\r\n    when Randolph Churchill had quarrelled with Gorst, and the Fourth\r\n    Party had finally gone to pieces, Lord Randolph said to me: \"Gorst was\r\n    the best adviser I ever had. I often failed to follow his advice, and\r\n    have always regretted not following it.\" When the Fourth Party was\r\n    first formed, he advised that we should sit immediately behind the\r\n    leaders--I with my knees in Northcote's back. I overruled him, and we\r\n    sat below the gangway; but he was right. We should have done far more\r\n    execution if I had been nearer to \"the Goat.\" Lord Randolph never\r\n    alluded to Sir Stafford Northcote except by this playful appellation,\r\n    based upon the long, straggling, yellow-white beard of the\r\n    Conservative Chief. When he was in good humour the Fourth Party leader\r\n    alluded to the Conservative leader as \"the goat\"; but when angry as\r\n    \"the old goat,\" and often with many of those disrespectful adjectives\r\n    in which in private conversation he delighted.\r\n\r\n    'At dinner at the Harcourts' on August 10th, Arthur Balfour present:\r\n    ... I am the greatest of admirers of his \"charm.\"'\r\n\r\nIreland, which makes or breaks politicians, made Mr. A. J. Balfour. Here\r\nis some detail of one of the men whom Ireland broke. Towards the end of\r\nthe Session came to Sir Charles a letter from the Duchess of Manchester at\r\nAix-les-Bains:\r\n\r\n    \"Please back up Mr. Forster. I think he is quite right. Fancy, to be\r\n    chosen and proposed by a Committee, adopted by 300 idiots or geniuses,\r\n    and to have to submit, when you can stand on your own merits.\"\r\n\r\n    'A German Conservative Duchess was not likely to be able to understand\r\n    the Caucus. Forster was her friend, going and sitting with her almost\r\n    every day, and chuckling over her politics with his extraordinary\r\n    chuckle, and playing cards with her at night. To his card-playing,\r\n    indeed, he ultimately owed his life, for the Invincibles in Dublin\r\n    used to wait for him night after night outside his club to murder him\r\n    (as afterwards came out in the Phoenix Park trial), and, tired out\r\n    with waiting, at last fancy that he must have gone home. Forster was\r\n    at this moment at loggerheads with his Bradford constituents, and\r\n    hence the letter of the Duchess; but I did not \"back up\" Forster,\r\n    being myself an absolute believer in the wisdom of the Caucus system.\r\n    I had, indeed, invented a Caucus in Chelsea before the first\r\n    Birmingham Election Association was started.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles left for Paris, and--\r\n\r\n    'on September 6th I met Émile Ollivier, who said that there had never\r\n    been in France a personal power equal to that of Gambetta at this\r\n    moment; even that of Napoleon, when First Consul, was not so great.\r\n    Then the Bourbons were dimly seen behind. \"Now there is nothing\r\n    behind; nothing except Clericalism, and Clericalism can be bought.\"\r\n\r\n    'Ollivier I found still full of burning hatred for the Empress, but he\r\n    had forgiven Rouher and the Emperor for making him the scapegoat. I\r\n    discussed with him once more the origin of the war of 1870, and he\r\n    maintained most stoutly that France had been driven into it by\r\n    Bismarck, and had only put herself in the wrong by herself declaring\r\n    war, and had done this because her army system gave her a fortnight's\r\n    start, the advantage of which was lost through the Emperor's\r\n    hesitations. He thinks that in that fortnight the German Army could\r\n    have been destroyed. It is on this point that he is wrong.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ZULU WAR AND THE GREEK COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chronicle of the year 1879 begins with a visit paid by Sir Charles to\r\nParis on his way back from his house near Toulon, to which he had returned\r\nafter the brief Session of December, On February 2nd 'I breakfasted with\r\nGambetta. His furniture was being packed up for removal to the Palais\r\nBourbon, where he was about to take up residence as President of the\r\nChamber,' and 'saw him again late at night at the office of his paper'\r\n(_La République Française_). 'Gambetta was then,' says a note added later,\r\n'at the height of his power, and, in fact, Dictator. He was a patriot, but\r\ntoo big for the Republic.'\r\n\r\n'On my return to London I found that Chamberlain was most anxious to see\r\nme,' and on February 5th Sir Charles went to Birmingham, to discuss their\r\njoint line of action in the coming Session. During this visit 'Chamberlain\r\ntold me of Lord Beaconsfield's pleasant prophecies with regard to myself,\r\nof which I heard from all sides just after this time.'\r\n\r\nThe \"pleasant prophecies\" declared that Sir Charles would certainly be\r\nPrime Minister. Mr. Gladstone, it will be seen later, came to the\r\nconclusion in 1882 that Dilke would be his natural successor in the House\r\nof Commons; but this opinion was given only a little in advance of a\r\nwidely received public estimate, and it came after the test of office had\r\nproved those qualities which Lord Beaconsfield discerned while the younger\r\nstatesman was still only a private member of the Opposition, not promoted\r\nto the Front Bench.\r\n\r\nBut no one, even in 1879, doubted that Sir Charles was of Front Bench\r\nrank; and close upon this came a decisive opportunity in Parliament.\r\n\r\nTrouble, which threatened to become acute, between the Zulu power under\r\nCetewayo and his encroaching Boer neighbours had led the British\r\nGovernment to carry out the annexation of the Transvaal during the course\r\nof 1877. The Zulus were inclined to trust the British more than the Dutch;\r\nbut the advent of Sir Bartle Frere as High Commissioner put a new\r\ncomplexion on matters. Frere had made up his mind that the Zulu power must\r\nbe broken, and a pretext was soon found in a demand for the abolition of\r\nthe Zulu military system. This ultimatum was presented on December 11th,\r\n1878, by Frere, of his own motion, and without warning to the Home\r\nGovernment. The inevitable refusal followed, leading to invasion of the\r\nZulu territory, with disastrous result. On January 23rd, 1879, Lord\r\nChelmsford's force was cut to pieces at Isandhlwana; and it seemed\r\npossible that the whole colony of Natal might be overrun by Zulu _impis_.\r\n\r\nThis was the governing factor of the political situation at the moment\r\nwhen Parliament reopened in 1879. Sir Charles had not previously taken a\r\nprominent part in the discussion of South African affairs, and his\r\nattitude is indicated only by isolated passages in the Memoir.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, when Lord Carnarvon sent J. A. Froude to 'stump South Africa' in\r\nadvocacy of a scheme of federation devised in Downing Street, Sir Charles\r\ncondemned a mission which seemed to him to cast a slur on the local\r\nColonial governments. In his opinion, this mission helped to create those\r\ndisturbances which rent South Africa in the succeeding years. On May 27th,\r\n1877, he noted that the Blue Book on the Transvaal, then published, was\r\n'an indictment of the Republic intended to justify the annexation,' but\r\nthat it did not 'show the existence of any overwhelming necessity for\r\nannexation, or, indeed, any necessity at all.' Yet he gave only a half-\r\nhearted support to Mr. Courtney's opposition to the South Africa Bill when\r\nthose matters were debated in the House, for, as he wrote in a letter to\r\nthe _Spectator_, he was opposed, \"not to the policy of annexation, which,\r\nas leading up to confederation,\" he supported, \"but to the manner in which\r\nthat annexation had been carried out.\" It was said to have been done by\r\nthe desire of the Dutch themselves. If so, why were three battalions of\r\nBritish troops still needed in the Transvaal? The Bill did not establish a\r\nself-governing federation; it only provided that federation might be\r\nestablished by an Order in Council. What guarantee had the Dutch, he\r\nasked, that such an order would ever be issued?\r\n\r\nEvents justified his question, for the promise was never made good, even\r\nwhen the Liberals themselves came into office, and Sir Charles resented\r\nthe iniquity of this dealing.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1878, he met Froude at dinner, and 'discussed with him the\r\nSouth African question, on which we took widely different views, and of\r\nwhich his were to be the source of much unhappiness to the Mother Country\r\nand the Colonies.'\r\n\r\nWith the difficulty of the Transvaal the Zulu outbreak was indirectly\r\nconnected. Great Britain had been drawn into strife with the Zulu power,\r\nwhich had for more than thirty years lived peaceably beside the Natal\r\nGovernment, only because the annexation had made England responsible for\r\nthe peace of the disputed territories beyond the Vaal. There was also a\r\nstrong if indirect connecting-link in the personality of Sir Bartle Frere,\r\nwho, as High Commissioner in South Africa, had belittled the Boer claims,\r\nand who now by a violent stretch of authority had precipitated war with\r\nthe Zulus.\r\n\r\nAfter his discussion with Chamberlain at Birmingham, Sir Charles had\r\ndecided to indict the Government's South African policy on the first\r\npossible occasion, and he communicated this intention to Lord Hartington.\r\nOwing to the prolonged winter Session there was to be no Queen's Speech,\r\nand consequently no Address, at the opening of Parliament, and Sir\r\nStafford Northcote was to begin the proceedings with a general statement.\r\nLord Hartington, after some hesitation as to the course to be pursued,\r\nultimately commissioned Sir Charles to reply at once on behalf of the\r\nOpposition--a task which would naturally fall to the official leader of\r\nthe party. The opportunity thus given to him was the more notable because\r\nthe Liberal chiefs were divided as to the line which should be taken.\r\nHarcourt, Sir Charles records, 'tried to prevent me from bringing forward\r\nany motion as to the Zulu War,' but Chamberlain was strong in the opposite\r\nsense. \"We want to din into the constituencies,\" he wrote, \"that the\r\nGovernment policy is one of _continual_, petty, fruitless, unnecessary,\r\nand inglorious squabbles--all due to their bullying, nagging ways.\" This\r\nwas consonant with the Birmingham leader's fierce opposition to Jingoism;\r\nand for once he shared the view of his titular leader.\r\n\r\n    'Hartington fell in with the view taken by Chamberlain, and my notice\r\n    to call attention to the South African papers and the causes of the\r\n    war was given with his consent. The bad news from the Cape '--news of\r\n    Isandhlwana--' which came on February 11th, had changed his former\r\n    view. My speech on Northcote's motion was on the 13th February.'\r\n\r\nHe then brought forward on behalf of the Liberal party a resolution\r\ncondemning the Government's policy in South Africa, and more especially\r\nthe conduct of Sir Bartle Frere. The date for this main attack was not\r\nfixed till after considerable delay, and before it arrived the words of\r\nthe motion which stood in Sir Charles's name were annexed bodily, and put\r\ndown in the name of Lord Lansdowne, to be moved in the Lords on an earlier\r\nday. Lord Lansdowne sat on the Liberal Front Bench in the Upper House\r\n(where he took an active part in criticism of Conservative policy), and\r\nSir Charles called this proceeding \"taking the bread out of a private\r\nmember's mouth,\" despite the implied compliment to his tact in drafting\r\nthe Resolution. Sunday, the 23rd March, he spent at Mentmore, Lord\r\nRosebery's house, where Lord and Lady Granville were staying, and he\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n    'I could not but think (although Lord Granville was very civil and\r\n    told me that he had advised the King of the Belgians to go to the\r\n    House of Commons on the following Thursday to hear my speech) that if\r\n    Lord Granville had thought that my speech was going to be a success,\r\n    he would not have stolen my motion for Lord Lansdowne to bring it on\r\n    first in the House of Lords. I could not see the wisdom of the\r\n    tactics, because it was already certain we should have a better\r\n    division in the Commons, proportionately speaking, than in the Lords.\r\n    At Devonshire House, on the previous Wednesday, Lord Lansdowne came up\r\n    to me in the entrance hall, where it is rather dark, and began talking\r\n    to me, and as I did not see who it was, he introduced himself--\r\n    \"Lansdowne the pirate,\" of course in allusion to the robbery of my\r\n    words.'\r\n\r\nThe words were--\r\n\r\n    \"That this House, while willing to support Her Majesty's Government in\r\n    all necessary measures for defending the possessions of Her Majesty in\r\n    South Africa, regrets that the ultimatum which was calculated to\r\n    produce immediate war should have been presented to the Zulu king\r\n    without authority from the responsible advisers of the Crown, and that\r\n    an offensive war should have been commenced without imperative or\r\n    pressing necessity or adequate preparation; and this House further\r\n    regrets that after the censure passed, upon the High Commissioner by\r\n    Her Majesty's Government in the despatch of the 19th day of March,\r\n    1879, the conduct of affairs in South Africa should be retained in his\r\n    hands.\"\r\n\r\n    'These words did not please all men. Fawcett wrote me two strong\r\n    letters to protest against them. Lord Granville also discussed them at\r\n    some length with me in writing. Fawcett was largely moved by\r\n    detestation of Sir Bartle Frere, and, while my chief object was to\r\n    stop the war, his object was to force Frere to resign. The feeling\r\n    against the proconsul was strong among the Liberals.\r\n\r\n    'On the 25th the debate in the Lords took place. The House was\r\n    thronged, the galleries being filled with ladies, and (there being a\r\n    Court mourning) all in black--save one, Lady ----. She was in scarlet\r\n    from top to toe, or more than toe, for she displayed a pair of long\r\n    scarlet stockings to a startled House, and each member as he came in\r\n    said, \"Good gracious me, who's that?\" so that Lansdowne could hardly\r\n    begin for the buzz. His speech was dull, and the result was favourable\r\n    to the Government. Two days later I brought forward my motion in the\r\n    Commons, and had a great personal success, receiving the\r\n    congratulations of all the leading men of both parties. I spoke for\r\n    two hours and a half, and kept the House full, without ever for an\r\n    instant being in doubt as to the complete success of the speech;\r\n    greatly cheered by my own side, without being once questioned or\r\n    interrupted by the other. But the speech was far from being my best\r\n    speech, although it was by far my greatest success. It was an easy\r\n    speech to make--a mere Blue-Book speech. The case from the papers was\r\n    overwhelming. All that had to be done was to state it in a clear way,\r\n    and I should think that more than half the speech consisted of mere\r\n    reading of extracts, which, however, I read in such a way as to\r\n    incorporate them in the body of the speech. The opening and the\r\n    conclusion, both of which were effective, were not my own; for they\r\n    were suggested to me, only I think on the same day, by William\r\n    Rathbone, who sometimes thought of a good way of putting things. While\r\n    I was gratified by the success of the speech, I could not help feeling\r\n    how completely these things are a matter of opportunity, inasmuch as I\r\n    had made dozens of better speeches in the House, of which some had\r\n    been wholly unsuccessful.'\r\n\r\nNothing was wanting to the completeness of the after-effects of his House\r\nof Commons triumph.\r\n\r\n    'The general feeling seemed to be, as Lord Reay put it in his letter\r\n    of congratulation, that my speech on South African affairs was \"the\r\n    Cape of Good Hope of the Liberal party.\"' [Footnote: Lord Reay (Baron\r\n    Mackay of Ophemert), a Hollander by birth, then recently naturalized,\r\n    spoke with special authority when South Africa was in question. The\r\n    Barony was originally Scotch, and created in 1628. A peerage of the\r\n    United Kingdom was conferred on Lord Reay (the eleventh Baron) in\r\n    1881.]\r\n\r\nBy this speech his contemporaries remember Sir Charles as a speaker. Sir\r\nGeorge Trevelyan writes:\r\n\r\n    \"His great speech on South Africa was a wonderful exposition, lucid,\r\n    convincing, detailed, without being heavy. I can well recall how old\r\n    members admired the manner in which he ticked off topic after topic,\r\n    with its due amount of illustration from the Blue-Books.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Mrs. Pattison, written, as he says in it, \"under the violent\r\nexcitement of a splendid personal success,\" contains his own estimate. The\r\ncongratulations of leading men of all parties were couched, he said, \"in\r\nsuch a way as made me realize how badly I had always spoken before.\" And\r\nin his Memoir he adds the modest comment that 'praise was forthcoming in\r\nabundance. The only praise, however, that I can accept as fairly belonging\r\nto this speech, is praise for a past of work which had led up to it.'\r\n\r\nThe result, especially with an indolent man like Lord Hartington as\r\nleader, was that the conduct of the Opposition's case was increasingly\r\nleft to Sir Charles Dilke. _Truth_ put the popular view amusingly enough\r\nin Hiawathan verse:\r\n\r\n     \"Never absent, always ready\r\n     To take up the burning question\r\n     Of the hour and make a motion:\r\n     Be it Cyprus, be it Zulu,\r\n     He can speak for hours about it\r\n     From his place below the gangway.\r\n     No Blue Book avails to fright him:\r\n     He's the stomach of an ostrich\r\n     For the hardest facts and figures,\r\n     And assimilates despatches\r\n     In the most surprising fashion.\"\r\n\r\nA serious tribute to his success follows:\r\n\r\n    'I was asked by Sir Thomas Bazley, who was eighty-two years of age, to\r\n    stand for Manchester in his place, with a promise from Manchester that\r\n    my expenses would be paid. But I was under a volunteered pledge not to\r\n    leave Chelsea until beaten, which I thought I should be \"this time.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles records as one feature of the debate the sudden and painful\r\nfailure of Mr. Lowe's hitherto great debating powers:\r\n\r\n    'On the second night of the debate I dined with Sir Charles Forster'\r\n    (member for Walsall, and well known as a dinner-giver to the chiefs of\r\n    the Liberal party) 'to meet Lord Hartington, Mr. Gladstone, and Mr.\r\n    Bright. Almost the sole topic of conversation was the breakdown in the\r\n    debate of Lowe, who had apparently been trusting as usual to his\r\n    hitherto marvellous memory, when this had failed him, and he stopped\r\n    short' (in the middle of a sentence), 'and failed ever, henceforward,\r\n    to regain his power.'\r\n\r\nThe future of Greece engaged Sir Charles's attention far more constantly\r\nthan this South African embroilment. Cyprus was a branch of the Greek\r\nquestion, and (in a speech of March 20th, 1879) he had attacked Wolseley's\r\nadministration of the island. The General replied in a Blue Book, which\r\nwas debated on June 20th, 1879:\r\n\r\n    'The Cypriotes were so excited that they were sending me not only\r\n    every fact, but every story, and as it was difficult to sift them in\r\n    London, I dare say some of the charges were untrue and some were\r\n    certainly trivial.'\r\n\r\nOne telegram had complained bitterly of the injustice done to two priests\r\nwhose beards were cut off in a British gaol, although nothing was said as\r\nto the justice of their imprisonment. But \"the existence of forced labour\r\nunder our rule had certainly been admitted,\" said Sir Charles in his\r\nspeeches on the question, and on this and on the law which the Government\r\nof Cyprus had passed, taking to itself powers of arbitrary exile without\r\ntrial, he rested a case in which he persevered throughout the Session,\r\ndebating Cyprus 'at such length, I fear, as to bore the House.' He relates\r\nthat he once began a speech on Cyprus before a party of members set out\r\nfor the Crystal Palace to dine, and was still delivering the same speech\r\nwhen they came back. Later, when in office, he was able to make the\r\nadministrative changes he desired for the benefit of the island.\r\n\r\nOne result of Sir Charles's interest in the affairs of Cyprus was to bring\r\ndown upon him 'an enormous correspondence in modern Greek, to read which I\r\nhad to engage the services of a translator.'\r\n\r\n    'The Cypriote Bishops are the most long-winded people with whom I ever\r\n    had to do, and their communications, although flattering, were\r\n    somewhat burdensome. I was also receiving many letters in modern Greek\r\n    from Athens and various centres of Greek activity with regard to the\r\n    proceedings of the Greek Committee, and I received addresses from\r\n    Epirus and from the other Turkish provinces and islands inhabited by\r\n    Greeks in which there was any thought of cession. I was appointed\r\n    Honorary President of the \"Zenon,\" whatever that might be, and\r\n    received similar appointments from various Greek societies. I am,\r\n    indeed, also a \"citizen of Athens.\"'\r\n\r\nHe received the freedom of that city on July 12th, 1879; the Grand Cross\r\nof the Saviour was also offered, but declined.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, March 30th, Hartington sent to me to exchange notes upon\r\n    the position of the Greek question, and his attitude seemed to me\r\n    that, as he did not understand anything about it, he hoped I was being\r\n    careful and not doing anything very wrong. At all events, he left me\r\n    to myself, and I delivered my soul in the House.'\r\n\r\nThis he did on April 17th, putting forward a complaint that, although\r\nGreece looked to Great Britain's representatives at the Congress of Berlin\r\nfor a traditional championship of the Hellenic claims, Lord Beaconsfield\r\nand Lord Salisbury had allowed the proposal for an extension of Greek\r\nterritory to come from French diplomatists; and, further, that the\r\nrecommendation to this effect inserted in the Treaty of Berlin had been\r\nevaded by Turkey. He described in his speech the delays and the\r\nunsatisfactory proposals which had been put forward by Turkey in\r\nconference with Greek delegates, and demanded European pressure to carry\r\nout the declared intentions of Europe. A special obligation of honour\r\nrested upon England, so he held, because England had induced Greece to\r\ndesist from war when Turkey was at grips with Russia, and when the Greeks,\r\nby attacking, might easily have secured possession of the territory they\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThese representations were put forward a month later as the general appeal\r\nof the Greek Committee, which had existed as a secret body for a year, but\r\nwas formally and publicly organized on April 25th, 1879. Preparations were\r\nbegun for a public meeting, and after several conferences with Lord\r\nLansdowne\r\n\r\n    'I invited the speakers and drew up an appeal to the public, and acted\r\n    as Chairman of the Executive Committee, with Rosebery for President\r\n    and Lefevre for Treasurer. The meeting was held at Willis's Rooms on\r\n    May 17th, 1879, and was attended by men of all shades of opinion--the\r\n    Duke of Westminster, Sir Robert Peel, an independent Conservative, and\r\n    several other Conservatives, as well as the mass of the Liberals. I\r\n    presided, and Lansdowne moved the first resolution.'\r\n\r\nDilke said afterwards that this meeting had been 'sufficiently interesting\r\nto keep Harcourt and a Duke standing for three hours--putting Harcourt\r\nfirst because he was the more august.'\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards he went to Liverpool, as the guest of the Liverpool\r\nReform Club, to speak specially upon the Greek question.\r\n\r\n    'My speech was dull; the best thing said in the course of the evening\r\n    was said by a man who had been _Daily News_ correspondent in Crete--\r\n    \"They talk of Europe! What is Europe? Europe is a number of wicked old\r\n    gentlemen with decorations, assembled in a room.\"\r\n\r\n    'During my stay in the neighbourhood of Liverpool I was the guest at\r\n    Knowsley of Lord and Lady Derby, who were trying by all means in their\r\n    power to emphasize the fact that they were quite ready to go over to\r\n    the Liberal side' (as they did within the year). 'I tried hard to get\r\n    Rosebery to make some speeches in the country upon the Greek question,\r\n    but this attempt was a failure. He was greatly pressed to go to\r\n    Manchester in the same way in which I had gone to Liverpool, but after\r\n    taking a long time to think of the thing, he distinctly refused. I\r\n    never quite knew why; but caution was always the predominant element\r\n    in his nature, though he was occasionally rash just when he should\r\n    have been cautious.'\r\n\r\nIn June Sir Charles became possessed of 'a curious document which he\r\ntranslated and made public.' According to the story told him, the letter\r\nhad been in the mailbags aboard a steamer which was wrecked, and it had\r\nbeen retrieved along with the rest from the bottom of the sea. But\r\n\r\n    'it was probably bought for the Greeks by their spy Fitzgerald, the\r\n    \"journalist\" who afterwards disappeared--finally--about 1894. He had,\r\n    however, often disappeared for some years. The letter was stamped with\r\n    an Italian stamp for foreign post, addressed to Mouktar Pasha,\r\n    commanding in chief the Turkish army in Epirus; and, although the\r\n    envelope was plain and not calculated to attract attention, the letter\r\n    was on Italian Foreign Office paper, and dated from the Foreign Office\r\n    at Rome on April 6th. It was from Corte, an Italian Consul-General who\r\n    had been employed in Albania and afterwards in the Italian Foreign\r\n    Office, and pointed to Italian intrigue in Albania to make the\r\n    Italians rather than the Greeks the successors of the Turks in Albania\r\n    and Epirus. Seven years later I saw a good deal of Mouktar Pasha at\r\n    Constantinople, but I did not mention this letter either to him or to\r\n    the Sultan. It referred to Mouktar's idea of \"colonization in Epirus,\"\r\n    and, from the context, and from what we know of previous proceedings,\r\n    it would seem that this colonization of Epirus was to have been a\r\n    colonization by Italian peasants.'\r\n\r\nThis letter came to Sir Charles as President of the Greek Committee, and\r\nhere may be added notice of the birth of an enterprise kindred in spirit\r\nto the political association of those who loved Greece:\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, June 16th, I took part in the meeting at which the\r\n    Hellenic Society was founded, it having grown out of a conference held\r\n    at Cambridge between Mr. Newton of the British Museum (afterwards Sir\r\n    Charles Newton), Professor Colvin, and me. The first resolution was\r\n    moved by Lord Morley (Earl Morley, afterwards Chairman of Committees\r\n    of the House of Lords), and seconded by Professor Sayce; the second by\r\n    me, and seconded by the Dean of St. Paul's; the third by Sir John\r\n    Lubbock, and seconded by Professor Jebb; and the fourth by Professor\r\n    Colvin, and seconded by Gennadius.'\r\n\r\nTwo other questions of abiding interest were touched on by Sir Charles\r\nthis year. That of Upper Houses is mentioned in connection with interviews\r\nwith Sir Graham Berry, one of his Colonial acquaintances.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. (afterwards Sir) Graham Berry, Prime Minister, or, as they call\r\n    it in the Colonies, \"Premier\" of Victoria; a rough, able man, son of a\r\n    Chelsea tradesman.... We arranged a reception, which was given to\r\n    Berry by the parish of Chelsea at the Chelsea Vestry Hall, myself in\r\n    the chair, when we presented him with an address expressing the hope\r\n    that the Victoria Lower House might prevail in its struggle against\r\n    the Upper. Professor Pearson, formerly of Oxford--a Free Trader,\r\n    though Mr. Berry was a Protectionist--was with him, and they were over\r\n    to try to persuade the Colonial Office to support them against the\r\n    Upper House.'\r\n\r\n    'Sir Graham Berry was afterwards the Agent-General of his Colony, but\r\n    still possessed the confidence of the Liberal party in Victoria in a\r\n    higher degree than any other man, and he afterwards returned to local\r\n    politics and became Speaker. Pearson wrote a great book before he\r\n    died.'\r\n\r\nSir Graham Berry wrote later in this year 'for opinions upon a Bill of\r\nreform of the Upper House in his Parliament,' to which Sir Charles replied\r\n'that I disliked Upper Houses so much as not to be in favour of reforming\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\nThis attitude he always maintained. His views upon the whole question of\r\nrepresentation were this year put into a pamphlet which\r\n\r\n    'advocated, in addition to the reforms upon which Liberals were\r\n    agreed, the system of double elections, as on the Continent--that is\r\n    to say, a second poll to be held when at the first the person at the\r\n    head of the poll did not obtain a clear majority of votes.'\r\n\r\nThe other question takes the first place in Sir Charles's note of his\r\nconversations with Chamberlain at the beginning of the Session. This\r\ntouched on economic difficulties, and runs thus:\r\n\r\n    \"That it would be wise to have a motion on the condition of the realm:\r\n    probably by moving for a Committee to inquire into the cause of the\r\n    present distress, and that Mundella would be the best person to move,\r\n    especially if the Front Bench would support him, as the distress is\r\n    most severe in Sheffield.\"\r\n\r\nSome years, however, elapsed before Sir Charles was able to deal with such\r\nquestions authoritatively as President of the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nWe can trace at this time the beginning of those close relations which\r\nDilke and Chamberlain cultivated (even after they had joined Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government) with the new power that was growing up in\r\nParliament. On February 15th, 'we were anxious that the Irish should vote\r\nwith us about the Zulu War, the more so because her leaders were\r\nhesitating upon the subject,' and Sir Charles invited Mr. Parnell to meet\r\nMr. Chamberlain at dinner; but they 'were able to make but little of him.'\r\nFurther meetings took place, from which the only practical result was a\r\npromise of Parnell's support in their opposition to the County Boards\r\nBill, which the Conservative Government were putting forward as their main\r\nmeasure. The ground of opposition was that 'it was better to leave the\r\npresent system alone than to create new Boards only half elective.'\r\n\r\nThe Memoir has a note respecting one of these meetings with the Irish\r\nleader at which Parnell was accompanied by Major Nolan, then member for\r\nCounty Galway:\r\n\r\n    'Nolan showed opportunist Nationalism; Parnell irreconcilable\r\n    Nationalism. The latter let out, in spite of his great caution, that\r\n    if we chose to go to Ireland on Mill's land programme, we could\r\n    destroy his position and the Home Rule movement. Nolan said that a\r\n    party which would give security of tenure to the small tenants could\r\n    afford to leave the large ones out. (To touch the large tenancies in\r\n    that sense would be virtually to charge the possession of property in\r\n    Ireland with partial compensation.)'\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the beginning of 1879, the purely Nationalist agitation\r\nfor self-government had not yet been joined to the demand for an improved\r\nand freer status for the Irish tenant. This was mainly the work of Davitt,\r\nand Davitt had scarcely yet been heard of by the wider public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL INTERESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nHospitable and popular, Sir Charles had the best of what those days could\r\noffer in talk and talkers. He compared his own country very unfavourably\r\nwith the possible standard of social intercourse:\r\n\r\n    'In England and in France people seem wholly unaware that they cannot\r\n    either in politics or in literature deal with or even understand\r\n    questions involving philosophical and historical considerations\r\n    without any training in either philosophy or history, and one sees\r\n    writings and speeches by persons who think themselves members of an\r\n    educated class which are unintelligible to any who have the slightest\r\n    discipline of either habit of thought or form of expression.'\r\n\r\n    'In the best English political and literary society there is no\r\n    conversation. Mr. Gladstone will talk with much charm about matters\r\n    that he does not understand, or books that he is not really competent\r\n    to criticize; but his conversation has no merit to those who are\r\n    acquainted with the subjects on which he speaks. Men like Lord\r\n    Rosslyn, [Footnote: Lord Rosslyn died in 1890.] Lord Houghton, Lord\r\n    Granville (before his deafness), had a pleasant wit and some\r\n    cultivation, as had Bromley Davenport, Beresford Hope, and others, as\r\n    well as Arthur Balfour, but none of these men were or are at a high\r\n    level; and where you get the high level in England, you fall into\r\n    priggism. On the whole, Hastings, Duke of Bedford, was the best\r\n    specimen that I ever knew of an English gentleman as regards learning\r\n    and conversation; but then he was horrible as a man, in spite of his\r\n    pretty manners, because ferocious in his ideas upon property. Now, at\r\n    Rome is to be found that which is unknown in London, in Paris, in St.\r\n    Petersburg, and unknown, I fancy, at Vienna and Berlin, although of\r\n    these I know far less--namely, conversation not priggish or academic,\r\n    and yet consistently maintained at a high level.\r\n\r\n    'I often heard Mr. Gladstone talk well at little Charles Forster's.\r\n    \"Mr. G.\" also seemed to me to talk especially well at the table of Sir\r\n    Walter James, [Footnote: The first Lord Northbourne.] an old gentleman\r\n    who had left Parliament soon after I was born. In those two houses he\r\n    was supreme; but if Coleridge or the Viper (Abraham Hayward) or\r\n    Browning were present, who talked better than he did, and would not\r\n    give way to him, he was less good. Villiers, who was another good\r\n    talker, \"Mr. G.\" could not abide, and his presence also was a damper.'\r\n\r\nIn the next year we have 'a dinner at the French Embassy, where Gladstone\r\nwas very agreeable, talking French well in an old-fashioned style.'\r\n\r\nAlso, in 1880, there is a dinner to which\r\n\r\n    'the first man to come was the Duke of Cambridge, who gave Mr.\r\n    Gladstone his left hand, and said that his right was too painful\r\n    through gout. Mr. Gladstone threw his arms up to the sky, as though he\r\n    had just heard of the reception of Lord Beaconsfield in heaven, or of\r\n    some other similar terrible news. His habit of play-acting in this\r\n    fashion, in the interest of a supposed politeness, is a very odd one,\r\n    giving a great air of unreality to everything he does; but of course\r\n    it is a habit of long years.\r\n\r\n    'I heard good talk about this time at Coleridge's house, but preferred\r\n    his Blakes--which were even better than mine--to his conversation.'\r\n\r\nUnder the date February 23rd is record of sitting up late at night at the\r\nLubbocks' with Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, the Judge:\r\n\r\n    'We did not agree upon any point, for his opinions upon all things,\r\n    especially hanging, were the exact opposite of my own. He talked of\r\n    \"our dear old British gallows.\" But we got on well, and I was one of\r\n    those who greatly regretted his breakdown, which occurred some ten\r\n    years later. He and Leslie Stephen were the sons of Sir James Stephen,\r\n    Professor of History at Cambridge--very unlike one another in early\r\n    life, when J. F. Stephen was a fat, half-Whig, half-Tory lawyer and\r\n    _Saturday Reviewer_, and Leslie a starved-looking, free-thinking\r\n    Radical parson, afterwards to throw off his Orders. As they grew old\r\n    they became much alike in appearance, and in opinion.'\r\n\r\nThere is a note of spending a Sunday in March 'at Aston Clinton, with the\r\nwidow of Sir Anthony de Rothschild and her daughter, Mrs. Cyril Flower,\r\nafterwards Lady Battersea.\r\n\r\n'Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild and his wife came to dinner, and, well\r\nknowing as I did two other members of the family, I could see how\r\nstrangely like a Royal family the Rothschilds are in one respect--\r\nnamely, that they all quarrel with one another, but are united as against\r\nthe world. When Cyril Flower, in 1878, made a speech unfriendly to the\r\nGovernment, but not more so than might naturally be expected at that time\r\nfrom a Liberal member, Baron Lionel sent for him, and told him that it was\r\n\"wicked and abominable for him to attack a man who had been a poor Jew and\r\nwas now the greatest man in England.\" \"In Europe, papa,\" cut in Nathaniel,\r\nwho was present at this public cursing.\r\n\r\n    'From March 15th to the 17th I stayed at York House with the Grant\r\n    Duffs, where I met the Marquis and Marquise de la Ferronnays, Henry\r\n    Cowper, Minto, Lord Reay, and Herbert Spencer. La Ferronnays was at\r\n    this time Military Attaché at the French Embassy, but resigned as soon\r\n    as the Republic became consolidated, and, being elected to the\r\n    Chamber, was soon the fighting leader of the high Tory party--a not\r\n    clever, but excellent gentleman, like the others.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, March 31st, I dined at the Harcourts', but, alas I this\r\n    time no Schouvalof. His place was occupied by Rancez, the Spanish\r\n    Minister, who had the same diplomatic capacity for concealing the\r\n    truth while talking with equal apparent frankness, but who was less\r\n    amusing.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, April 7th, I dined with Lord and Lady Arthur Russell, to\r\n    meet old Lady Russell. I had seen her once before at Pembroke Lodge,\r\n    and once at Harcourt's at dinner, on both of which previous occasions\r\n    I had seen Lord Russell too--a shadow of his former self.... On this\r\n    occasion Lady Russell was alone, Lord Russell having died in the\r\n    previous year. [Footnote: In 1878.] The old lady was pleasant, and\r\n    gave me a general invitation to come to Pembroke Lodge any or every\r\n    Sunday, an invitation of which I afterwards availed myself.\r\n\r\n    'On April 9th I left for France for Easter, and had long and pleasant\r\n    breakfasts at the Palais Bourbon with Gambetta, varied by a grand\r\n    dinner on April 16th, at which I met many of those who afterwards held\r\n    office--Ferry, afterwards Prime Minister; Rouvier, afterwards Prime\r\n    Minister; Spuller, afterwards Minister for Foreign Affairs; Constans,\r\n    afterwards Minister of the Interior; and Freycinet, afterwards Prime\r\n    Minister--all of them dull men enough. Spuller, a kindly and pleasant\r\n    dull man; Constans, a red-faced Burgundy drinker; Freycinet, a little\r\n    white intriguer--on the whole a sorry crew, Gambetta towering above\r\n    them in ability, in joviality, and even in reading.'\r\n\r\nIn a scrap of an old letter, dated Wednesday, April 16th, Sir Charles\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"I've spent nearly all my time with Gambetta. He said that he thinks\r\n    Sella 'le premier homme politique de l'Italie, mais enragé\r\n    protectionniste.' He says he told him that if he were not so violent a\r\n    Protectionist he would be 'l'homme absolument nécessaire.'\"\r\n\r\nOn this follows later the observation:\r\n\r\n    'If Gambetta was anything, he was anti-Russian and a Free Trader, and\r\n    his friends, professing to continue his work, became, after about\r\n    1887, rabid Russians and fierce Protectionists.'\r\n\r\n    He speaks of Gambetta's 'contempt for Sella because Sella was a\r\n    Protectionist,' and adds: 'I suppose Gambetta would have become one\r\n    had he lived.'\r\n\r\nWhile Dilke was in Paris he received a letter from Chamberlain referring\r\nto a motion about 'the interference of the Crown in politics,' of which\r\nMr. Dillwyn had given notice. Mr. Chamberlain thought the subject\r\n\"certainly a popular one, but very difficult to treat in the House of\r\nCommons.\"\r\n\r\n    'Dillwyn's motion was obviously what people would call \"interesting,\"\r\n    but obviously also highly dangerous, as it was really impossible to\r\n    prove the case. The Queen does interfere constantly; more, however,\r\n    when Liberal Ministers are in power than when she has a Conservative\r\n    Cabinet, because the Conservatives on the whole do what she likes, as\r\n    she is a Conservative; whereas the Liberals are continually doing, and\r\n    indeed exist for the purpose of doing, the things she does not like.\r\n    But it is very doubtful how far her interference is unconstitutional,\r\n    and it would be quite impossible to prove it, unless Mr. Gladstone,\r\n    for example, were to publish her letters--a not very likely\r\n    supposition. The Queen is a woman of great ability.... She writes to\r\n    the Prime Minister about everything she does not like, which, when he\r\n    is a Liberal, means almost everything that he says or does. She\r\n    complains of his colleagues' speeches. She complains, with less\r\n    violence, of his own. She protests against Bills. She insists that\r\n    administrative acts should not be done without delay, for the purpose\r\n    of consulting with regard to them persons whose opinions she knows\r\n    will be unfavourable. But if the Minister acts as she directs, he, and\r\n    not she, becomes responsible; and he may be impeached, for example,\r\n    for so doing. And... her action, to my mind, is, strictly speaking,\r\n    constitutional. Even in the House of Commons, and in a speech taking a\r\n    rough popular view of the Constitution, it would be difficult to\r\n    maintain that with her immense experience the Queen is not justified\r\n    in asking for time in order that men of distinction should be\r\n    consulted upon various acts; and anything beyond this would be mere\r\n    matter of inference, not proving the case even if the facts were\r\n    known, which of course they are not. Our poor Dillwyn on this\r\n    occasion, prompted by Trevelyan, walked into a hornets' nest; and, as\r\n    he did it without consulting his two leaders, his leaders were not\r\n    bound to follow him.'\r\n\r\n    'On March 21st I dined with Sir Baliol and Lady Bret, meeting the\r\n    German Ambassador (Count Münster) and his daughter, and Lord and Lady\r\n    Derby. She was not at all bitter about Lord Beaconsfield, although\r\n    very bitter about the Court; and after dinner Lord Derby said that the\r\n    Queen was now carrying on a confidential correspondence with every\r\n    quarter of the globe, so that he was evidently bitter too....\r\n\r\n    'On April 22nd I received from Auberon Herbert a letter: \"Things look\r\n    well. The gilding is much tarnished, and shows the brass underneath.\r\n    You have done right well. Many thanks for your letter. I went to\r\n    Leeds--on the chance but I suspect I am best out of the House. I can\r\n    do more to make people believe in themselves, and not in our Moslem\r\n    idea of government--perhaps--outside the House than in it. You do\r\n    agree in the fearfully paralyzing effect of belief in Government,\r\n    don't you?\" The last words reveal the growth in Auberon Herbert of\r\n    anarchic views, which shortly afterwards turned him for all practical\r\n    purposes from a Radical into a Tory, or, rather, turned him back to\r\n    the point from which he had started, for as a Tory private secretary\r\n    to a Tory Cabinet Minister he had begun political life at the time\r\n    when he drew up the plan for the action of the troops against the mob\r\n    on the day of the Hyde Park railings being torn down--a plan so\r\n    drastic that the Home Secretary, Walpole, refused to move.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, April 23rd, I dined with Waddy, M.P., Q.C., [Footnote:\r\n    Afterwards County Court Judge.] a man who would have been a Judge but\r\n    for his odd name and his odder manners, \"to meet Lord Hartington and\r\n    the President of the Wesleyan Conference,\" an odd mixture. Waddy is a\r\n    Wesleyan, and wanted Hartington to make the acquaintance of the\r\n    leading Wesleyans in England, and took this course to bring about the\r\n    result.\r\n\r\n    'My Sundays at this time I had taken to spend at Pembroke Lodge,\r\n    preferring it to Strawberry Hill as quieter, for we often had there\r\n    (besides Lady Russell) only Lady Agatha and Rollo Russell, and little\r\n    Lord Russell when he was home for the holidays from Winchester.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, April 28th, I had an interview with the Duke of Argyll at\r\n    his wish with regard to the Eastern Question generally, in which he\r\n    took deep interest, and on which he made, perhaps, on the whole, the\r\n    most conclusive speech delivered in Parliament against the policy of\r\n    the Conservative Government. The Duke of Argyll was at this time the\r\n    most finished and (for a stately occasion and a cultivated audience)\r\n    about the most convincing speaker that could be found--to me, not so\r\n    convincing as Gathorne Hardy, and, to all men, less gifted with charm\r\n    and melody of voice than Mr. Bright; but fine in the extreme, with no\r\n    serious drawbacks except a little too much satisfaction with himself;\r\n    a very able man, as his monumental book upon the Eastern Question will\r\n    suffice to show. In philosophy he dabbled, and for dabblers was a\r\n    philosopher.\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, May 9th, I lunched with Lord and Lady Lansdowne, and found\r\n    her one of the nicest women that I had ever met--a plain and simple\r\n    lady. In the evening I dined with Lady Elizabeth Biddulph, and made\r\n    the acquaintance of Herbert of the Colonial Office, whom I afterwards\r\n    heard described by Grant Duff in a public speech as \"the perfect\r\n    permanent official.\" I had later, when Undersecretary of State for\r\n    Foreign Affairs, to act twice for a short time during changes in the\r\n    Colonial Office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the\r\n    Colonial Office, in addition to my own duties, and I was able to\r\n    discover for myself how true was what Grant Duff said. On one of these\r\n    occasions Hicks Beach, who had been Colonial Secretary, gave notice to\r\n    call attention to salaries of officers on the West Coast of Africa,\r\n    and I at once sent over to the Colonial Office to tell Herbert that he\r\n    had done so. Herbert immediately replied that the salaries were low,\r\n    and the coast unhealthy, and that salaries could hardly be reduced;\r\n    while, on the other hand, when Sir Michael had been Secretary of\r\n    State, he had not proposed to raise them; but that so soon as we could\r\n    learn which it was that he intended--_i.e._, to lower or to raise--he\r\n    would send me, \"in either event, a perfect case.\"\r\n\r\n    'On May 10th George Sheffield, the _alter ego_ of Lord Lyons, asked\r\n    himself to breakfast, and I gathered that Lord Lyons had told him to\r\n    come and pump me as to what Gambetta had indicated of his intentions\r\n    in France, as George Sheffield kept telling me that Gambetta evidently\r\n    intended to make himself Dictator in name, as he was in fact.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, May 11th, I dined with Edmund Yates and his wife, meeting\r\n    Irving, Browning, Sala, Mrs. Lynn Linton (just back from three years\r\n    in Florence), Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Murray, and some others. I was\r\n    intensely amused at watching Mrs. Douglas Murray, agreeable but rather\r\n    superfine, looking at the Bardolphian nose of \"George Augustus,\" who\r\n    took her in to dinner, and of whom she had evidently never heard, and\r\n    wondering what manner of wild man he could be.\r\n\r\n    'On May 17th, after the Greek Committee, I dined with the Lyulph\r\n    Stanleys.... Chamberlain took Lord Airlie, whom he had never\r\n    previously met, for Sir George Campbell, and addressed him in a\r\n    friendly but disrespectful manner, whereupon Lord Airlie promptly and\r\n    publicly said: \"It is all right. You take me for Sir George Campbell.\r\n    I am used to it; \"for they were extraordinarily alike. [Footnote: Mr.\r\n    Gladstone once made exactly the same mistake at a great public meeting\r\n    in Scotland in 1879.] In fact, Lord Airlie used to wear his ribbon\r\n    oftener than other people chiefly because Campbell had not got one, so\r\n    that it formed a distinction, but not a sufficient one, for members of\r\n    the House sometimes said to me at parties, \"What is that ribbon that\r\n    Campbell is wearing?\" It must have been a relief to Sir George\r\n    Campbell when Lord Airlie died; but it would have been a greater\r\n    relief to Lord Airlie had Campbell died first.\r\n\r\n    'The next day I spent at Lubbock's.... Fitzmaurice, Fawcett, and I\r\n    went for a walk to the oak under which Wilberforce decided to abolish\r\n    slavery, and, strolling on, came to a stile, where we were doubtful of\r\n    our way. Fawcett sat down, and Fitzmaurice, looking for the road,\r\n    cried out: \"Here comes a clod. We will ask him.\" The slouching\r\n    labourer was Lord Derby, as we recognized with a loud laugh, joined in\r\n    with terrific shouting by Fawcett as we privately informed him of the\r\n    cause, at which Lord Derby was no doubt astonished. However, he did as\r\n    well as the yokel, for he led us towards home. My low opinion of Lord\r\n    Derby as a politician does not prevent my thinking that in private he\r\n    is a most agreeable man; but his appearance is against him. He took us\r\n    round by Holmwood, where Pitt lived, and Hayes, where his father,\r\n    Chatham, lived.\r\n\r\n    'Whitsuntide I spent partly upon the river in my canoe, [Footnote:\r\n    Canoeing had at this time taken for him the place of rowing, and he\r\n    spent his Sundays on the river.] partly at Lord Derby's, and partly at\r\n    Dudbrook, Lady Waldegrave's place in Essex; but the first part of my\r\n    holiday was spoiled by a summer flood, although the river was very\r\n    beautiful, there being beds of the snowflake or summer snowdrop in\r\n    bloom, with large white cups tipped with green. They are all gone now\r\n    (1900). [Footnote: One at least grew in the willow thicket by his\r\n    house at Dockett Eddy in May, 1911, after his death, close by a\r\n    nesting swan--two sights which would have filled him with interest and\r\n    joy.] The weather was so cold that Lord Derby called it \"winter\r\n    dressed in green.\" He and his wife seemed to me to have come over to\r\n    our side with almost indecent violence and suddenness; but to be\r\n    called \"Titus Oates\" in the House of Lords by your relative and\r\n    successor is too much. [Footnote: This speech of Lord Salisbury's was\r\n    made on July 18th, 1878.] The close family connection between the\r\n    Derbys and Lord Salisbury had a great deal to answer for in the\r\n    sharpness of the quarrel.\r\n\r\n    'At the beginning of June I received at my house two distinguished\r\n    Frenchmen whom I had not previously known: Edmond About and Coquelin\r\n    the actor, the latter introduced to me by Gambetta.'\r\n\r\nCoquelin was thus introduced:\r\n\r\n    '\"CHAMBRE DES DÉPUTÉS,\r\n    '\"PRÉSIDENCE,\r\n    '\"31 _Mai_, 1879.\r\n\r\n    '\"CHER AMI,\r\n\r\n    '\"J'introduis auprès de vous mon ami Coquelin dont vous pourrez\r\n    apprècier le charmant esprit, et je vous le recommande sans autrement\r\n    faire de phrases, sachant que vous savez à premier vu reconnaître les\r\n    vrais hommes.\r\n\r\n    '\"C'est à l'ami que je confie l'ami,\r\n\r\n    '\"À vous, LÉON GAMBETTA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    'About dined with me at the House of Commons on the day on which the\r\n    House of Commons met after the Whitsuntide recess; but I did not at\r\n    the moment know his peculiarity of being unable to touch any article\r\n    of food which contained onion in any form or had been cooked with it,\r\n    so that I am afraid I starved him. On June 13th I had prepared\r\n    accordingly, and he dined with me, and met all the people who spoke\r\n    good French--Leighton, Mitford, Fitzmaurice, Borthwick, Barrington,\r\n    Bourke (the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs), Chamberlain--and\r\n    Montebello and La Ferronnays of his own Embassy, and Gennadius the\r\n    Greek. It was hard to say whether Mitford, Leighton, or Borthwick\r\n    spoke the best French. But certainly neither Fitzmaurice, who was a\r\n    quarter French, nor the three Frenchmen, could venture to contest\r\n    matters with such talkers. I never heard any fault found with\r\n    Leighton's French except that it is too good, though I have heard\r\n    people declare that his Italian and his German were yet better; but I\r\n    myself could see no fault in Mitford's. About naturally came to the\r\n    conclusion, not entirely justified by fact, that all Englishmen could\r\n    speak French.\r\n\r\n    'On June 22nd I gave a dinner for Gambetta's friends, Coquelin and\r\n    Hecht, at which I had Lord Granville, Lord Lansdowne, Malet,\r\n    Montgélas, Lord Reay, Lord Arthur Russell, and Gavard. Lord Granville\r\n    was at his very best, shining as he always did when he could talk\r\n    French theatre anecdotes to a man playing up to him as could Coquelin.\r\n\r\n    'I think it was on Thursday night, June 19th (1879), that, about\r\n    midnight, Pender brought me a telegram to the House of Commons telling\r\n    me that Prince Louis Napoleon had been killed by the Zulus, in order\r\n    that I might telegraph it to Gambetta. I did so; and in the morning\r\n    received from Gambetta a telegram asking me to repeat my telegram if\r\n    it really came from me, evidently thinking that he had been hoaxed in\r\n    my name, for my news reached Paris long before the thing was known\r\n    there. The Queen was not told till 10.30 a.m., and she then informed\r\n    the Empress Eugénie, so that I knew it eleven hours before the poor\r\n    mother.'\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, June 29th, Sir Charles had stayed at Strawberry Hill. Within\r\nthe same week Lady Waldegrave died suddenly. He was among the friends who\r\nwent down to see her buried at Chewton, near Chewton Priory, her place in\r\nSomersetshire.\r\n\r\n    'Carlingford was present at the funeral, although his condition was\r\n    very painful to his friends and he refused to leave the place, and\r\n    remained there, with great fortitude but little wisdom, for a long\r\n    time, until his nerve was completely gone. He never was afterwards the\r\n    same man, and, although Mr. Gladstone put him into his Cabinet in\r\n    1881, for friendship's sake, [Footnote: There was another reason: his\r\n    intimate knowledge of the details of the Irish Land Question, then the\r\n    subject of legislation. He became Lord Privy Seal on the resignation\r\n    of the Duke of Argyll.] he had become a broken invalid, and was unable\r\n    even to bear the smallest reference to past days or even the sudden\r\n    sight of friends who had known him in happier times.'\r\n\r\nOn July 8th there is a note of dining with Lord and Lady Derby, where were\r\n'Lord Odo Russell and a good many other interesting people; Odo Russell\r\nalways easily the first wherever he goes. He told me, what I was glad to\r\nhear, that Bismarck was most favourable to Greece.'\r\n\r\n    '_July_.--Two Crown Princes were in London at this time, and to both\r\n    of them I had to be introduced as the maker of speeches in the House\r\n    which they had heard: the Crown Prince of Sweden and the Hereditary\r\n    Duke (son of the Grand Duke) of Baden. Like all Kings and Princes,\r\n    except the King of Greece, and in later days the Emperor William II.,\r\n    they seemed to me heavy men, bored by having to pretend to be\r\n    thoughtful persons, and I found that difficulty in distinguishing them\r\n    the one from the other, which has always oppressed me in dealing with\r\n    Royal personages.'\r\n\r\n    'At this time I had several interviews with Cardinal Manning, at his\r\n    wish, about the Irish primary education question, in which I agreed\r\n    with him, differing, however, wholly from him with regard to English\r\n    education, which caused him always to reproach me with having what he\r\n    playfully called a \"geographical conscience.\"'\r\n\r\n    'In the many visits that I received from the Cardinal and paid to him\r\n    at the end of July and beginning of August, 1879, I was amused by\r\n    finding how much he cared for general gossip and even scandal. He\r\n    insisted on talking to me about Sarah Bernhardt, and Gambetta, and the\r\n    Prince of Wales, and all sorts and conditions of people. He told me\r\n    that if he was not Cardinal Archbishop he would stand for Westminster\r\n    in the Radical interest. But, Radical though he be in social\r\n    questions, he is a ferocious Jingo.'\r\n\r\nManning, unlike almost all other Englishmen of his creed, had a sympathy\r\nfor Irish Nationalism. Dilke shared the Cardinal-Archbishop's view as to\r\nthe power of Rome in Irish politics, as may be seen from the concluding\r\nsentence of this passage from a letter written by him in August, 1879,\r\nwith regard to the Act establishing what was called the Royal University:\r\n\r\n    \"Shaw is a Protestant--a Congregationalist--who once was a preacher\r\n    and now is a banker, but he is the leader of the Irish party, and\r\n    speaks for the Bishops, as did Butt, who also was a Protestant.\r\n    Parnell, too, is a Protestant, curiously enough. Biggar was, but has\r\n    turned. I don't think popular feeling is engaged; but you must either\r\n    govern through and with the priests--or by force.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw's day of influence was nearly ended. The revolutionary party--for\r\nthey aimed at, and effected nothing less than, a revolution--led by\r\nParnell in the House and by Davitt in the country, were sweeping away the\r\nstaunch adherents of pure constitutionalism, among whom Shaw and Butt were\r\nto be numbered. The Irish party was not the only one which contained\r\nconflicting elements:\r\n\r\n    'Manning attached more importance to an understanding with me and\r\n    Chamberlain than to one with Hartington, and sided with us in the\r\n    conflict which followed the scene between Hartington and Chamberlain\r\n    on July 7th.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles describes the occurrence, though somewhat toning down a\r\nsufficiently stormy passage:\r\n\r\n    'What occurred was this: James, who was Hartington's right-hand man,\r\n    and absolutely in his confidence, had started a debate on flogging,\r\n    and came to us and told us that he quite agreed in our view that much\r\n    should be made of it, and that it offered a good opportunity for\r\n    getting rid of flogging in the Army, and then went away to dinner. Our\r\n    men kept up the debate with a good deal of violence of language; and\r\n    then Hartington, strolling in after dinner, and hearing that there was\r\n    this obstruction, made a violent attack upon poor Hopwood (the Queen's\r\n    Counsel, afterwards Recorder of Liverpool, a member of the Radical\r\n    Club) and on those acting with him, for obstruction. Chamberlain, much\r\n    nettled by this attack upon our men below the gangway for doing only\r\n    that which they had been told to do, got up and ironically referred to\r\n    Hartington as \"the late leader,\" and I was stung, by Fawcett clumsily\r\n    siding with Hartington, into supporting Chamberlain and Hopwood.\r\n\r\n    'My talents of diplomacy were called into requisition after the\r\n    Hartington-Chamberlain quarrel, and I was very proud of managing to\r\n    get through nineteen clauses of the Irish University Bill on the next\r\n    day, July 8th, stopping all divisions except one, in which Parnell and\r\n    I told together, and got Hartington into our lobby, which was, I\r\n    think, a triumph of conciliation.\r\n\r\n    'Later in the month the Whigs, or men above the gangway, showed great\r\n    anger at the completeness of Hartington's surrender to us, which,\r\n    indeed, meant more than the immediate conquest, for it involved the\r\n    ultimate supersession of Hartington by Gladstone. Harcourt, James, and\r\n    Adam [Footnote: The Right Hon. W. P. Adam, afterwards Governor of\r\n    Madras.] (the Chief Whip), in giving Chamberlain the victory by\r\n    insisting that Hartington should yield, were considering the\r\n    constituencies, not the House. As regarded the House, the popularity\r\n    of stamping upon us would have been great. There was strong Whig\r\n    dislike of our activity, and strong Radical personal hatred among\r\n    ourselves. If Chamberlain were to have fought Hartington on any\r\n    question on which he had not the Liberal constituencies with him, he\r\n    would have got the worst of it; but then he was too wise to stir on\r\n    any question on which he could not at least carry all the active\r\n    elements of the party in large towns. The anti-Chamberlain set went to\r\n    work to get up a banquet to Hartington, and were very cross with me\r\n    when I told them that I was certain that the Whips would not let\r\n    Hartington accept the banquet unless they obtained Chamberlain's\r\n    signature to the requisition. It, of course, turned out as I expected.\r\n    Some twenty men said that they would not sign unless Chamberlain did\r\n    so, and he was then begged to sign, and, when he did, at once deprived\r\n    the manifestation of all significance. It was all rather small and\r\n    mean, but when one went to the root of the matter, one saw that the\r\n    whole difficulty sprang from the fact that the Whigs had now no\r\n    principles. Once upon a time they had had principles, but their\r\n    principles had been adopted by the other side, and long before 1879\r\n    their distinctive opinions had been taken from them. A party cannot be\r\n    dignified and consistent if its chiefs and the mass of its rank and\r\n    file have no principles. My own opinion, which I preached on all\r\n    occasions, was that the right course in these democratic days was for\r\n    leaders to say, \"Here are my opinions, but I know that on certain\r\n    points they are not those of a majority;\" and not to continue to\r\n    pretend that all agreed when, as a fact, they differed.\r\n\r\n    'In a note in my diary upon the question of the leadership I say:\r\n    \"Harcourt's good points and bad points are both on a large scale.\r\n    Childers is too much in city business and in companies to be one of\r\n    the leading men in the party in the future. Hartington is too careless\r\n    and too much bored to interest others. Gladstone and Bright are old;\r\n    Bright 'past'; Gladstone still a great power, and, but for his Scotch\r\n    deference to the aristocracy, which is a sad drawback, I could admire\r\n    him with little check.\"\r\n\r\n    'On July 26th I received from Bradlaugh a letter about his candidature\r\n    for Parliament, in which he wrote: \"It appears that the so-called\r\n    moderate Liberals mean to fight for one seat only at Northampton. I,\r\n    therefore, can only fight for myself. This means Phipps's seat sure,\r\n    and for the second either Merryweather or Ayrton, and I think the\r\n    order expresses--subject to contingencies--the probability. There are\r\n    one or two county constituencies and several boroughs where moderate\r\n    Liberals will stand who cannot be elected without the votes of my\r\n    friends. I am now consulted as to what my friends in such cases ought\r\n    to do. Speaking moderately, I think I could surely prevent the return\r\n    of five or six moderates, and render doubtful the return of ten or\r\n    twelve more. Is it reasonable to expect me to aid actively those who\r\n    do me the most possible mischief? I owe no debt of gratitude to anyone\r\n    in England ... except the people who love me. May it not be as well\r\n    for me this coming election to pick, say, twenty seats and make a few\r\n    burnt-offerings by way of example, to show the moderates that I am\r\n    strong enough to be worth reckoning with? Pardon me if I am boring you\r\n    with a matter in which you have no interest.\"'\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Session Sir Charles addressed his constituents--\r\n\r\n    'with an overwhelming case against the Government, in which I showed\r\n    the folly of the pretences which had been put forward as to the Berlin\r\n    settlement in Bulgaria and in Asia Minor, of the Anglo-Turkish\r\n    Convention, of the occupation of Cyprus, and of the South African\r\n    policy; and pointed out the fact that in the year we were spending\r\n    fifty millions sterling upon our army and navy, and that if the navy\r\n    was in excellent condition, no one would venture to make the same\r\n    assertion with regard to our land forces.'\r\n\r\nHe crossed to France, saw Gambetta in Paris, and also Nubar Pasha, and\r\nwent to drink waters at La Bourboule, and on to Le Puy, and thence started\r\non one of the long tramps by which he came to know France as few\r\nEnglishmen have done. He walked across to Vals, 'and so to the Rhone, and\r\nthen to my solemn Provençal country--to my mind, a better Italy.'\r\n\r\nAt Toulon he busied himself with the German history of the nineteenth\r\ncentury for his projected book, and wrote much to his brother, who was now\r\nhoping to enter Parliament.\r\n\r\n    'Nubar, who had a quarrel with our Foreign Office, and who had been\r\n    expelled from Egypt by the new Khedive, but, as Nubar thought, at the\r\n    wish of the French Consul-General, was another correspondent of these\r\n    days, destined afterwards to return to be made Prime Minister at the\r\n    hands of this same Khedive.'\r\n\r\nThe Government's sixth year of office was running out, and a General\r\nElection was at hand.\r\n\r\n    'At the end of the year I had letters describing the state of things\r\n    in England from Harcourt, Chamberlain, and Adam. Chamberlain wrote:\r\n    \"Things look bad for the Tories. We shall have a majority at the next\r\n    election. I feel confident.\" Adam wrote: \"As things are at present, we\r\n    shall have a majority independent of Home Rulers.\" Harcourt wrote that\r\n    he was unusually dull and stupid: \"I feel as if the soul of Northcote\r\n    had transmigrated into me, and, if only I had a flaxen beard, I am\r\n    sure I should make one of his Midland speeches to admiration.... I\r\n    really find nothing new to say. Of course, there is the old story of\r\n    Afghanistan, but the latter is already discounted, and it is rather a\r\n    ticklish question. I never felt it so difficult to mix a prescription\r\n    good for the present feeling of the constituencies.... Depend upon\r\n    it, if we are to win (as we shall), it will not be on some startling\r\n    cry, but by the turning over to us of that floating mass of middle\r\n    votes which went over to the Tories last time, and will come back from\r\n    them in disgust at the next election. It is much easier to persuade\r\n    the public that the Government are duffers than that we are conjurers.\r\n    I shall therefore ... be dull and safe, and not overabusive. That, at\r\n    least, is my diagnosis of the treatment the patient requires just\r\n    now.... Not having materials for one speech, I have got to make a\r\n    second. I must trust to the newspaper abuse of the first to supply me\r\n    with materials for the second.\"'\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt was too diffident, as his brilliant speeches at\r\nOxford and elsewhere, full of epigrams, had more effect on the electorate\r\nthan any others--not even excepting Mr. Gladstone's speeches in his\r\nMidlothian campaign.\r\n\r\nThere is no suggestion in the correspondence of the ferment which was\r\nworking in Midlothian. Mr. Gladstone was apart from both Whigs and\r\nRadicals in these days.\r\n\r\nSo closed the last years of Sir Charles's second Parliament. He had played\r\nin it a commanding part in debate upon matters of war and of foreign\r\npolicy without abating his activity in domestic politics, such as the\r\nfranchise, or flogging in the army, which he helped finally to abolish. No\r\nman could well seem to have fewer enemies or more friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF A MINISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nBy the close of 1879 the Beaconsfield Administration was deeply\r\ndiscredited. The year had opened with the disaster in the Zulu War at\r\nIsandhlwana; in September came the tragedy at Kabul, when Sir Louis\r\nCavagnari and his staff were slain by a sudden uprising of the tribesmen;\r\nand though Sir Frederick Roberts fought his way into the Afghan capital on\r\nOctober 12th, it was only to be beleaguered within the fortifications of\r\nSherpur.\r\n\r\nThe European situation Sir Charles described to his constituents before\r\nthe Session of 1880 opened:\r\n\r\n    'What, I asked, were they promised in the Treaty of Berlin? Turkey\r\n    restored to strength, reformed, and, if reformed, made secure for a\r\n    distant future; Greece contented; Russian influence excluded; and the\r\n    Balkans fortified as \"an impregnable frontier\" for Turkey. Very\r\n    different were the realities. Turkey had been partitioned; Greece had\r\n    not been satisfied; surrender of Turkish territory to Greece, though\r\n    it was the one form of surrender which might really have strengthened\r\n    Turkey, had been opposed rather than advocated by the British\r\n    delegates. Austria, gorged with Bosnia and Herzegovina, was alone\r\n    contented.\r\n\r\n    'Of the Asia Minor clandestine convention, it was beyond our power to\r\n    fulfil the terms. Russian intrigue would sooner or later create\r\n    insurrection in Armenia. The insurrection would be put down by the old\r\n    Turkish means, by the old savagery, and our guarantee would prove\r\n    useless in face of public opinion at home. The Government had allowed\r\n    Russia to gain exactly those things which in the excellent circular of\r\n    April 1st, 1878, they had declared that it would be fatal to our\r\n    country that she should possess. The Government had proclaimed British\r\n    interests in language which I had described as the gospel of\r\n    selfishness, but there was not a British interest which was not worse\r\n    off for their rule. In Egypt, their policy of joint action with France\r\n    was certain to lead to future trouble. Greece was dissatisfied, and\r\n    leant on France, and the rising nationalities of South-Eastern Europe\r\n    were all alienated from us. Russia was in possession, not only of\r\n    Bessarabia, not only of a firm hold over Turkey by the stipulations\r\n    with regard to the debt due to her, but of that fortress of Kars and\r\n    that port of Batoum which our Government had told us she could not\r\n    consistently with British interests be permitted to possess. To add\r\n    insult to injury, we were thought such silly children as to believe\r\n    that what was left of Turkey had been saved by our plenipotentiaries--\r\n    saved in Asia by a bit of paper, and in Europe by an \"impregnable\r\n    frontier\" which was situated in the middle of the Bulgarian country,\r\n    and which the Sultan's troops would never be allowed to approach.\r\n\r\n    'This was a strong indictment, and, as is now seen, it was all true.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's \"indictment\" was strengthened by information he had received\r\nas to England's treatment of M. Waddington's circular proposing mediation\r\nbetween Turkey and Greece, and by the knowledge that the championship of\r\nGreek interests was at this moment being left to France.\r\n\r\n    'On January 26th I reached Paris on my return from Toulon, and\r\n    breakfasted with Gambetta, stupid Spuller remaining with us all the\r\n    time. Barrère came to see me, and told me that the late ministerial\r\n    crisis in France had had for cause Waddington's refusal to accept\r\n    Gambetta's orders to turn out all the reactionaries from the Foreign\r\n    Office. \"That lock has now been forced.\" [Footnote: The Waddington\r\n    Ministry had fallen in the last days of December, and M. de Freycinet\r\n    came into power. M. Camille Barrère was at this time Gambetta's chief\r\n    private secretary. Sir Charles had first met him in London during the\r\n    Commune. He has had a distinguished career, and is, in 1917,\r\n    Ambassador at Rome.] Tissot, French Minister at Athens, and known to\r\n    me as having been formerly the representative of the Government of\r\n    National Defence in London, when he occupied the Embassy and acted as\r\n    an unauthorized Minister, is to be Ambassador at Constantinople, and\r\n    Waddington will take the Embassy in London. Barrère has been made\r\n    French Commissioner on the European Commission of the Danube, which\r\n    enables him for nine months in the year to continue his newspaper work\r\n    in Paris. It is true, as stated in the French newspapers, that\r\n    Waddington's last circular proposing mediation between Turkey and\r\n    Greece was accepted by all the Continental Powers, but not answered by\r\n    England.\r\n\r\n    'On the 27th I breakfasted with Gambetta to meet General Billot,\r\n    commanding the Marseille _corps d'armée_, who, in the event of war\r\n    occurring between 1887 and 1890, would have been second in command of\r\n    the French armies.\r\n\r\n    '\"On the 28th Gambetta, at a private interview, confirmed what Barrère\r\n    had said about Greece, regretted that Waddington had proposed to leave\r\n    the town of Janina to Turkey, and thought that the French Government\r\n    ought to go back to the old position of 'Thessaly and Epirus.' He\r\n    added (most confidentially) that as soon as the trouble about 'Article\r\n    7' was over Léon Say would come as Ambassador to London.\" [Footnote:\r\n    The double quotes here show that Sir Charles transcribed in his Memoir\r\n    a note of the conversation taken at the time.] Léon Say did come, but\r\n    Waddington came afterwards, though with some between. Article 7 was,\r\n    of course, the Ferry proposal with regard to unauthorized\r\n    congregations, which I opposed in conversations with Gambetta, who\r\n    supported it as strongly in private as in public. [Footnote: The\r\n    'Article 7' referred to was in the Education Bill then under\r\n    discussion in the French Assembly. By this article it was proposed\r\n    that members of religious bodies which were not recognized by the law\r\n    should be forbidden to teach in public or in private schools.] Opinion\r\n    in France undoubtedly backed him in his opposition to \"Clericalism,\"\r\n    but I myself continue to think that it was unwise to harry the Church,\r\n    although the position of the Government was in accordance with the\r\n    law.\r\n\r\n    'On the same morning I received a letter from Chamberlain inviting\r\n    himself to dine with me on February 4th \"to discuss the situation.\"\r\n    Chamberlain was strongly opposed to taking Lord Derby in the next\r\n    Administration, and determined also, if he could, to shut out Goschen.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, January 28th, I reached London, and on the 29th saw\r\n    Harcourt as to a request which had been made to him by A. M. Sullivan\r\n    on behalf of Lord Ramsay, who was standing at Liverpool as the Liberal\r\n    candidate, but who had pronounced in favour of Home Rule, to the great\r\n    scandal of the country. The Irish members were supposed to be doing\r\n    more harm than good by helping him, and were most anxious that someone\r\n    from the Liberal Front Bench should give them countenance. Hartington\r\n    was strongly opposed to Ramsay's action. Harcourt consented to go, and\r\n    went, which must have meant, I think, that he had decided to throw\r\n    over Hartington, seeing that Mr. G. was the only possible leader, and\r\n    that he did not think that Mr. Gladstone would feel strongly about the\r\n    Home Rule pledge. Harcourt told me that Lord Granville and Hartington\r\n    intended that Lord Derby should be in the next Government, but found\r\n    difficulties, inasmuch as they thought that the land question must be\r\n    dealt with, and he was too conservative for the party on it. The Duke\r\n    of Argyll was to be left out of the next Cabinet; no one would consent\r\n    to become Viceroy of Ireland or Irish Secretary; and there was a\r\n    difficulty about the Viceroyalty of India. I suggested Lansdowne for\r\n    India, if his wife would go, and it is curious that after many years\r\n    he was sent, although sent by the other party. Harcourt said that some\r\n    of the older men over whose heads I had passed were very jealous of\r\n    me. I said, half in jest: \"I believe I am the only English politician\r\n    who is not jealous,\" at which Harcourt laughed very much, and replied:\r\n    \"We all think that of ourselves.\" I said: \"I mean it.\"'\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of that assertion was to be proved within three months. But\r\nhe notes in his diary a decision in consequence of Harcourt's warning \"to\r\nkeep in the background this Session.\"\r\n\r\n    'On February 4th Harcourt wrote to me to say that, if I would go to\r\n    his house that night, someone from Devonshire House should meet me to\r\n    show me the Queen's Speech, as he had to go to Liverpool; Hartington,\r\n    he said, was full of approval of my speech.'\r\n\r\nThe dissolution came suddenly, hastened by the result of a by-election,\r\nwhich encouraged the Government to believe that the country was with them.\r\nOn February 10th Sir Charles dined at Lady Ripon's, where were 'the Duke\r\nof Argyll, Lord Granville, the Childers, and the Hayters.'\r\n\r\n    'The conversation of the evening turned upon the Southwark election,\r\n    where we all knew that the Conservative must win, Clarke (later Sir\r\n    Edward Clarke) being a popular Queen's Counsel, an excellent election\r\n    speaker, while the Liberals were divided between two bad\r\n    candidates.... When the numbers became known to me I wrote in my\r\n    diary: \"Southwark not quite so bad as I expected, but quite bad\r\n    enough.\" Yet it was this election, which, to anyone who knew the\r\n    facts, should have meant nothing, which is supposed to have induced\r\n    the Tories to dissolve.' [Footnote: The Conservatives won both the\r\n    Liverpool and Southwark elections.]\r\n\r\n'Cross drowns the Government,' is Sir Charles's comment on the Return on\r\nthe Water Question, for which he now moved; 'the notice contained such a\r\nmass of statistics as to make the return of a very searching character in\r\nits bearing on the agreement that the Home Secretary had come to with the\r\nwater companies.' It did frighten Cross, as Mr. Trevelyan had prophesied,\r\n'and the trouble between himself and his colleagues over this question was\r\nthe immediate cause of the dissolution.' [Footnote: Mr. Cross, Home\r\nSecretary, had introduced a Bill to provide for the purchase of the\r\nundertakings of the London Water Companies, which was supposed to offer\r\nthe companies too favourable terms. Sir Charles notes (July, 1879):\r\n\"Manning was getting up a meeting on the water question, and got me to\r\nmanage it for him.\" 'I fancy, indeed,' he adds in his Memoir, 'that it was\r\nthe Cardinal who was the indirect cause of the dissolution in the spring\r\nof 1880, for he induced Cross to undertake the purchase of the\r\nMetropolitan Water Supply, and so got him into tangled negotiations.']\r\n\r\nJust before the electoral campaign began--\r\n\r\n    'On March 4th I received a note from Lord Fife asking me to dine with\r\n    him on Friday, the 12th, to meet the Prince of Wales at the Prince's\r\n    wish. The note was of such a character that it left no choice. When\r\n    the dinner came off it turned out well. The Prince laid himself out to\r\n    be pleasant, and talked to me nearly all the evening--chiefly about\r\n    French politics and the Greek question. The other guests were\r\n    Lansdowne, Dunraven, Burnand of _Punch_, Bernal Osborne, and Colonel\r\n    Carington, brother of Lord Carrington, a very pleasant member of the\r\n    House.' [Footnote: Colonel Carington was M.P. for Wycombe, 1868-1883.]\r\n\r\nThere was still among leading politicians 'much doubt as to the prospects\r\nof the election,' which Sir Charles found expressed when he spent Sunday,\r\nMarch 7th, 'at Aston Clinton with the Cyril Flowers, Lord Hartington being\r\nthere, and Charles Villiers (at eighty), and Wolff walking over from Tring\r\nPark.' However, on March 15th, Sir William Harcourt wrote from Oxford: \"I\r\nhave never wavered in my opinion that the Government will be beaten,\r\nthough I thought a fortnight ago it would only be a shave.\"\r\n\r\nIn his own borough Sir Charles found that there were 580 publicans, and\r\nthat 500 of them were Conservative.\r\n\r\n    'My belief in the influence of the publicans made me hesitate with\r\n    regard to Chelsea, where I thought myself not unlikely to be beaten,\r\n    but I had a full belief in the success of the party generally. I was\r\n    triumphantly returned, bringing in Firth with me, by great majorities\r\n    over a clever Tory, Lord Inverurie (afterwards Earl of Kintore, and\r\n    Governor of South Australia), and a colonial sheep-farmer, who paid\r\n    the cost.'\r\n\r\nThe result was declared on April 2nd, and Sir Charles, having stayed to\r\nvote in two divisions of Surrey where he owned property, left England for\r\nToulon on the 7th--a proceeding which separated him from those who were\r\nimportunate for office. Before his departure he had dined with Sir William\r\nHarcourt:\r\n\r\n    'I found his ambition to be to ... succeed Lord Selborne as Lord\r\n    Chancellor. In order to reach this goal, he would prefer to be\r\n    Attorney-General rather than Home Secretary. James, however, cannot\r\n    well be anything but Attorney-General. Harcourt would like James to be\r\n    Home Secretary, for which James is not fit, but which he would like to\r\n    be. If this combination should fail, then Harcourt would like to be\r\n    Chancellor of the Exchequer.... He asked me what I should like, and I\r\n    told him that I did not expect to be offered a great post, but that if\r\n    there were any such chance the Navy was the only one that I should\r\n    like.' [Footnote: Sir Charles's view that a Foreign Secretary had\r\n    better be in the House of Lords, so long as there is a House of Lords\r\n    to put him in, no doubt influenced his preference for the Admiralty.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the events which have now to be narrated, it must be\r\nremembered that the Chamberlain of 1880 was not yet the author of any\r\n\"unauthorized programme\" or any \"gospel of ransom.\" He was admittedly the\r\ncontroller of the Caucus. It was widely known that he, like Fawcett, had\r\nprofessed republican principles. But Queen Victoria's objection to Sir\r\nCharles Dilke--and it will be seen how strongly she maintained it--was\r\nbased not merely on his avowal of abstract Republican theories, but also\r\non his very concrete proposal to assert control over the Civil List.\r\nChamberlain upon this matter was not committed to a personal view, and it\r\nhad not yet been demonstrated that whatever position Dilke defended,\r\nChamberlain would defend also.\r\n\r\nA compact laying down the principle of mutual support between the two\r\nRadicals was proposed in a letter written by Chamberlain to Dilke--then at\r\nToulon--immediately after the General Election had given the Liberals a\r\nsweeping triumph. They came back 349 against 243 Conservatives. Irish\r\nNationalists were 60, of whom 35 followed Mr. Parnell.\r\n\r\nChamberlain's proposal was in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"The time has come when we must have a full and frank explanation.\r\n\r\n    \"What I should like--what I hope for with you--is a thorough offensive\r\n    and defensive alliance, and in this case our position will be\r\n    immensely strong.\r\n\r\n    \"I am prepared to refuse all offers until and unless both of us are\r\n    satisfied.\r\n\r\n    \"Can you accept this position with perfect satisfaction? If you think\r\n    I am asking more than I can give, I rely upon your saying so--and in\r\n    this case you may depend on my loyalty and friendship--I shall support\r\n    your claim cordially and just as warmly as if I were personally\r\n    interested.\r\n\r\n    \"But my own feeling is that if you are stronger than I am in the\r\n    House, my influence is greater than yours out of it, and therefore\r\n    that, together, we are much more powerful than separated; and that in\r\n    a short time, if not now, we may make our own terms.\r\n\r\n    \"To join a Government as subordinate members, to be silenced and to\r\n    have no real influence on the policy, would be fatal to both of us. If\r\n    we both remain outside, any Government will have to reckon with us,\r\n    and, on the whole, this would be the position which on many grounds I\r\n    should prefer.\r\n\r\n    \"I am ready to make all allowances for the difficulties in the way of\r\n    giving to both of us the only kind of places which it would be worth\r\n    our while to accept. If these are insuperable, I will give a hearty\r\n    support to any Government which is thoroughly liberal in its measures;\r\n    but I am not going to play the part of a Radical Minnow among Whig\r\n    Tritons.\r\n\r\n    \"The victory which has just been won is the victory of the Radicals.\r\n    Gladstone and the Caucus have triumphed all along the line, and it is\r\n    the strong, definite, decided policy which has commended itself, and\r\n    not the halting, half-hearted, armchair business.... The country feels\r\n    it, and we should be mad to efface ourselves and disappoint the\r\n    expectations of all our strongest supporters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RT. HON. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P.\r\nFrom the painting by F. Holl, R.A., in the National Portrait Gallery.]\r\n\r\n    \"You see that my proposed condition is--both of us to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n    \"As to what ought to satisfy us, if you agree to the principle, we\r\n    will consult when the time comes, but my present impression is all or\r\n    nothing.\"\r\n\r\n    'In other words, Chamberlain's view was that we should insist on both\r\n    being in the Cabinet. My own view was that we should insist on one\r\n    being in the Cabinet, and the other having a place of influence,\r\n    giving him the opportunity of frequent speech in the House of Commons,\r\n    pleasant to himself; and my view prevailed.\r\n\r\n    'On April 19th, Chamberlain wrote again that he had heard from Mr.\r\n    Bright that \"Mr. Gladstone will take the Premiership if pressed.\"'\r\n\r\n    '\"I am glad to see that all the papers speak of you as a certainty for\r\n    the Cabinet. For myself, I am absolutely indifferent to office, and\r\n    the only thing on which I am clear is that I will take no\r\n    responsibility which does not carry with it some real power. Another\r\n    point on which I have made up my mind is that I will not play second\r\n    to Fawcett, or to anyone of the same standing, except yourself.\"'\r\n\r\nOn April 22nd, Sir Charles received at Toulon a telegram from Sir William\r\nHarcourt insisting on his immediate return, and he started at once for\r\nLondon, missing a second urgent telegram from Harcourt on his way. From\r\nMr. Frederic Harrison he received a letter strongly urging him to claim at\r\nonce a place in the Cabinet and 'to lead the new men.' He meant 'the\r\ncultured Radicals; Mr. Bryce and the like.' He urged that the new Left\r\nmust have a full place in the Ministry, and that any Liberal Minister must\r\nbe pledged to deal with redistribution in the House.\r\n\r\n'Hill of the _Daily News_ had written to me that with the exception of\r\nHarcourt everybody thought that Gladstone must be Prime Minister.' Sir\r\nCharles goes on to note a breakfast with Lord Houghton, Renan, Professor\r\nHenry Smith of Oxford, Henry Reeve of the _Edinburgh Review,_ Lord Arthur\r\nRussell, and Lord Reay, at which they\r\n\r\n    'agreed that Gladstone must be Prime Minister, or would upset the\r\n    Government within a year. ... Hill advised that I should take the\r\n    Cabinet without Chamberlain if Gladstone was Prime Minister, but\r\n    refuse the Cabinet without Chamberlain--_i.e.,_ insist on both being\r\n    in the Cabinet--if Hartington was Prime Minister.'\r\n\r\nBy the night of April 23rd, when Sir Charles reached London, the question\r\nof Mr. Gladstone's primacy was settled, and Ministry-making had begun,\r\nwith the decision of Lord Granville to return to the Foreign Office, and\r\nLord Hartington's consent to act as Secretary of State for India. Mr.\r\nChilders went to the War Office, Lord Northbrook to the Admiralty; Lord\r\nSelborne, most conservative of Whigs, became Lord Chancellor; Lord Spencer\r\nwas President of the Council, Lord Kimberley took the Colonies, the Duke\r\nof Argyll the Privy Seal. Sir William Harcourt, who had been called \"a\r\nWhig who talked Radicalism,\" was Home Secretary. Mr. Forster at the Irish\r\nOffice, with Lord Cowper as Lord-Lieutenant, did not commend himself\r\ngreatly to the advanced party, and Mr. Bright, in returning to the\r\nChancellorship of the Duchy, brought with him only a tradition of\r\nRadicalism. When it is added that Mr. Dodson was President of the Local\r\nGovernment Board, ground will be seen for a warning which Sir Charles\r\nreceived that, although the victory had been forced upon them by the\r\nRadicals almost against their will, the \"incorrigible old place-hunters\r\nwould, if left to have their own way, appropriate the victory and the\r\nprizes calmly enough to themselves.\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, April 24th, Sir Charles had two interviews with Sir William\r\nHarcourt, and communicated the result to Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n    'The position is that Gladstone is in the hands of Lord Wolverton,\r\n    [Footnote: As Mr. Glyn he had been Chief Whip.] the evil counsellor of\r\n    1874, and that, while a Whig Premier must have had a Radical Cabinet,\r\n    Gladstone will say, \"You have got me; that is what you asked for,\" and\r\n    will give us a Whig Cabinet. Stansfeld is likely to be in the Cabinet\r\n    owing to W. E. Forster's influence, of which I personally shall be\r\n    glad. Rosebery is likely to be put in, at which I shall not be\r\n    sorry.... Gladstone disapproves strongly of people being put straight\r\n    into the Cabinet who have not held office before. This is for\r\n    Chamberlain and for me. They are likely to offer me the Under-\r\n    Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs, which I suppose I shall be unable\r\n    to accept. Later in the evening I was informally offered the\r\n    Secretaryship of the Treasury, with management of the Government\r\n    business in the House. Harcourt at a second interview said that\r\n    Gladstone intended pedantically to follow Peel's rule that men should\r\n    not be put straight into the Cabinet without going through non-Cabinet\r\n    office; and that Chamberlain and I must both take non-Cabinet office;\r\n    [Footnote: It is worth noting that Sir Robert Peel himself had\r\n    violated this rule if it ever existed.] that he, Harcourt, strongly\r\n    advised us to take Under-Secretaryships of which the Secretary was in\r\n    the Upper House, or the Secretaryship of the Treasury. He then offered\r\n    me the Under-Secretaryship for the Colonies, to which I replied,\r\n    \"Certainly not.\" He said, \"Remember that with Mr. Gladstone Prime\r\n    Minister, the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs will have no chance\r\n    to speak, because Gladstone will do all the talking.\" [Footnote: Sir\r\n    William Harcourt's prophecy received frequent confirmation. See\r\n    _infra_, pp. 384, 459, 535, and Vol. II., p. 51.] At the same time,\r\n    there was evidently another reason behind--namely, that Lord Granville\r\n    had sooner have anybody in his office than me; in other words, he\r\n    would like me in anybody's office except his own. Harcourt strongly\r\n    urged me to take office on personal grounds--namely, in order to get\r\n    over the Queen's prejudice, and so succeed naturally to the first\r\n    vacancy in the Cabinet. I replied that I had sooner keep my\r\n    independence than take office without power. He then said curtly, \"It\r\n    will not be a pleasant opposition.\" I said it would not be an\r\n    opposition at all, as far as I could see, as I should support the\r\n    Government and lead a very quiet, humdrum Parliamentary existence.\r\n    Harcourt replied, \"That is what is always said.\" \"But I shall not be\r\n    cross,\" was my last word. I telegraphed at night for Chamberlain, who\r\n    replied that he would come up at five on Sunday afternoon and dine and\r\n    sleep. But I prepared him, and was prepared by him, for a double\r\n    refusal of office. In fact, we were decided on refusal of that which\r\n    alone was offered.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday afternoon, 25th, before seeing Chamberlain, I saw James,\r\n    who went to Lord Granville and fully stated my views, reporting to me\r\n    afterwards that Lord Granville seemed inclined to come round a little.\r\n    James added of Harcourt: \"Confound that Home Secretary! How discreet\r\n    he is even before kissing hands! I shall live at the Home Office.\" I\r\n    went to Euston to meet Chamberlain. We were fully agreed in our line,\r\n    and he remained at my house the next morning, when I was sent for by\r\n    Mr. Gladstone through Lord Granville, the note being simply to ask me\r\n    to call at four o'clock at Lord Granville's house, where Mr. Gladstone\r\n    was. The questions which I put to Chamberlain were--\"Is your former\r\n    opinion changed by the fact that Mr. Gladstone can, if he likes, do\r\n    without us, whereas Hartington could not? Or is it changed by the fact\r\n    that Gladstone's Government will last six years, whereas Hartington's\r\n    would soon have been modified by Gladstone?\" Chamberlain's view was my\r\n    own view, that, although we were much weaker, we could not change our\r\n    attitude as regards one of us being in the Cabinet. Before seeing Mr.\r\n    Gladstone I had calls from Fawcett and Lefevre. Nothing had been\r\n    offered to Fawcett; Lefevre had been sounded as to an Under-\r\n    Secretaryship, and would take it. He told me he was sure that\r\n    Stansfeld would have the Local Government Board again and be in the\r\n    Cabinet. Childers came three times to see me in the course of the day,\r\n    and said that he was most anxious that I should be in the Cabinet and\r\n    Chamberlain in a good place outside it; but that the Queen had made a\r\n    difficulty about my Republicanism, and he asked me to write him a\r\n    letter about it. I declined to say anything new, but ultimately we\r\n    agreed that I should write him a letter marked \"Private,\" in which I\r\n    wrote to the effect that on March 13th I had been asked the question\r\n    at a meeting, and that my answer had been in the newspapers on March\r\n    15th, that it was the same answer which I had made before the election\r\n    in 1874, and that I had nothing to alter in it.' [Footnote: The rest\r\n    of the letter gave a full account of the incident of Saturday, March\r\n    13th, 1880:\r\n\r\n    \"The Tories sent the 'Reverend' W. Pepperell, an ex-dissenting\r\n    minister, to a meeting of mine, who asked me 'whether it was true that\r\n    I was a republican?' I replied to the effect that 'while as a matter\r\n    of speculative opinion I thought that a country starting afresh--as\r\n    France after Sedan--would in these days generally do better to adopt a\r\n    republican form of government than a limited monarchy, yet that in a\r\n    country possessing a constitutional monarchy it would be mere folly to\r\n    attempt to upturn it, and consequently folly even to try to disturb\r\n    it.' The answer was a very long one, and was nowhere _fully_ reported,\r\n    but everything in it was on these lines.\"]\r\n\r\nA copy of this letter was ultimately brought to the Queen, and on May 5th\r\nreturned by Sir Henry Ponsonby with the words, \"Her Majesty accepts Sir\r\nCharles Dilke's explanation.\" But Lord Granville, through whom it had been\r\nsent, and who had by that time become Sir Charles's immediate chief,\r\nsoftened the austerity of this formula by explaining that the Queen in a\r\nprivate letter had said she was \"quite ready to believe all I had told her\r\nabout you, having known you as a child.\"\r\n\r\nThese preliminary conversations having occupied the morning, Sir Charles\r\nset out after luncheon for the decisive interview.\r\n\r\n    'When I got to Lord Granville's I found Lord Granville, Lord\r\n    Wolverton, and Mr. Gladstone in the room, and Mr. Gladstone at once\r\n    offered me the Under-Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs. I asked who\r\n    was to be in the Cabinet. I was told Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville,\r\n    Hartington, Harcourt, and Lord Spencer. Further than this, they said,\r\n    nothing was settled. I asked, \"What about Chamberlain?\" Mr. Gladstone\r\n    replied to the effect that Chamberlain was a very young member of the\r\n    House who had never held office, and that it was impossible to put him\r\n    straight into the Cabinet. I then said that this made it impossible\r\n    that I should accept the Under-Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs, or\r\n    any place. Mr. Gladstone said he would see whether anything could be\r\n    done, but that he feared not. I then asked whether, supposing that\r\n    anything could be done in my direction, I should be excluding Grant\r\n    Duff [Footnote: Sir M. Grant Duff had been spoken of for this office\r\n    in 1868, and had then in that Ministry become Under-Secretary of State\r\n    for India. In 1880 he was--much to Sir Charles's joy--made Under-\r\n    Secretary for the Colonies, his chief, Lord Kimberley, being in the\r\n    Lords.] from the Under-Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs, because I\r\n    said that I should be very sorry to do that, for both personal and\r\n    public reasons. He replied that if I refused it, it would not be\r\n    offered to Grant Duff; and I then left....\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday morning Chamberlain was sent for, and accepted a seat in\r\n    the Cabinet (with the Presidency of the Board of Trade), and at one\r\n    o'clock I accepted the Under-Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs. Just\r\n    about this time I received a message from James: \"Do, for the sake of\r\n    our future comfort, take something. The Bench will be dreadfully dull.\r\n    Stansfeld _in_ office must be worse than Stansfeld out.\" But Stansfeld\r\n    was not in office. What had interfered at the last moment to prevent\r\n    an appointment which was resolved upon I never knew for certain.\r\n    [Footnote: Mr. Stansfeld is generally believed to have refused office\r\n    owing to his wish to devote himself entirely to the cause of a special\r\n    measure of social reform in which he was interested.] But, as they had\r\n    not intended to put Chamberlain in, and I forced him in, I suppose\r\n    that Stansfeld was the man who had to make way for Chamberlain.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSo ended the negotiations. The Radical wing had asserted itself, and\r\nasserted itself successfully. It had been enabled to do so by Sir\r\nCharles's action. To him the matter represented the mere carrying out of a\r\nbargain; but friends were, as is natural in such a case, remonstrant, and\r\nhe was accused of \"needless self-sacrifice,\" of \"Quixotic conduct,\" of\r\n\"self-abnegation,\" of \"your usual disinterestedness in politics,\" and the\r\nbargain was much criticized. A letter from Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice,\r\ncongratulating Sir Charles on the stand he had made, added: \"Not that I am\r\naltogether satisfied with the result. I had assumed that as a matter of\r\ncourse you would be in the Cabinet. I share the universal feeling that of\r\nthe two you had the undoubted claim to priority.\" But this regret was\r\nprobably based on more than personal grounds, and may well be read with a\r\nletter written many years afterwards, in July, 1914:\r\n\r\n    \"The real truth is that Dilke was too big a man to be an Under-\r\n    Secretary in 1880, and the whole position was a false one. I fancy\r\n    Lord Granville felt it to be so. One of his best points was his\r\n    readiness to recognize ability. I think he desired Dilke's sphere in\r\n    the Office to be as large as possible consistently with the general\r\n    arrangements of the Office, but it is always difficult to make special\r\n    arrangements work smoothly if they are based on a false principle.\r\n\r\n    \"Dilke ought to have insisted on being in the Cabinet. It was very\r\n    much to his honour that he did not do so.\"\r\n\r\nLord Fitzmaurice goes on to say that in the making of the Cabinet public\r\nopinion would have substituted Sir Charles Dilke for Mr. Dodson, who, in\r\nspite of his work as Chairman of Committees from 1868 to 1873, and\r\nafterwards as Secretary to the Treasury--(\"he would have made an excellent\r\nSpeaker\")--had done but little in the House for the party in the long\r\nperiod of Opposition from 1874 to 1880.\r\n\r\nA mistake had, in fact, been made. The strong man should be put where his\r\nservices can avowedly be best utilized. This statement is true of\r\nChamberlain. He was, as the _Times_ put it, \"the Carnot of the moment, the\r\norganizer of Liberal victory.\" [Footnote: Neither Sir Charles Dilke nor\r\nMr. Chamberlain would, however, have desired to underrate the great share\r\nin organizing the victory of Mr. Adam, the principal Liberal Whip in the\r\nHouse of Commons, whose services were generally considered to have been\r\nvery insufficiently recognized by Mr. Gladstone.] Moreover, the confidence\r\nand friendship which led to constant consultations on every point between\r\nthe two men guaranteed an added power to Sir Charles behind the scenes,\r\nand to him power, and not the appearance of power, was the essential\r\nthing. But Dilke's position also as a Parliamentarian, his acknowledged\r\npower and insight on questions both of Home and Foreign Affairs, his\r\nfollowing inside and outside the House of Commons, had created a claim of\r\nlong standing to Cabinet rank, and its abandonment made the \"false\r\nposition\" to which Lord Fitzmaurice alludes. Although Mr. Disraeli was\r\nreported to have said, apropos of Sir Seymour Fitzgerald, that an Under-\r\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs with his chief in the House of Lords holds\r\none of the most important positions in a Ministry, nevertheless the Under-\r\nSecretary is the subordinate of his chief, and Lord Granville's reputation\r\nas Foreign Minister was great.\r\n\r\nThat personal difficulties at least were overcome is shown by a note of\r\nLord Granville, written when Sir Charles left the Foreign Office in 1882,\r\nbut the note is in itself a commentary on the \"false position\":\r\n\r\n    \"WALMER CASTLE,\r\n    \"_December 27th_, '82.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR DILKE,\r\n\r\n    \"As this is the day you expect to go to the Local Government Board, I\r\n    cannot help writing you one line. I will not dwell upon the immense\r\n    loss you are to me and to the Office. You are aware of it, and I have\r\n    no doubt will continue to help us both in the Cabinet and in the\r\n    House, and will be ready to advise the Under-Secretary and myself. I\r\n    must, however, say how deeply grateful I am for our pleasant\r\n    relations, which might easily have been a little strained from the\r\n    fact that it was a sort of fluke that you were my Under-Secretary\r\n    instead of being my colleague in the Cabinet. As it is, nothing could\r\n    be more satisfactory and more pleasant to me, and the knowledge we\r\n    have obtained of one another will strengthen and cement our\r\n    friendship.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours,\r\n\r\n    \"G.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's acknowledged authority in foreign affairs made his\r\nappointment a matter of congratulation among foreign diplomatists. It was\r\nwelcomed on the ground that it would correct Mr. Gladstone's presumed\r\ntenderness towards Russia, and, above all, would make a bond of union with\r\nFrance through his personal relations with Gambetta, who wrote on April\r\n28th:\r\n\r\n    \"CHER AMI,\r\n\r\n    \"Merci pour votre lettre de ce matin. Je trouve votre détermination\r\n    excellente, et si la dépêche de 4 heures qui annonce votre entrée dans\r\n    le Cabinet, en qualité de sous secrétaire d'état aux Affaires\r\n    Étrangères, est vraie, vous serez universellement approuvé.\r\n\r\n    \"Pour ma part, je vous félicite bien cordialement de la victoire que\r\n    vous venez de remporter, car je sais qu'avec des hommes tels que vous\r\n    on peut être assuré que c'est une victoire féconde en résultats pour\r\n    la civilisation occidentale et le droit européen.\r\n\r\n    \"Votre présence au Foreign Office est bien décisive pour dissiper les\r\n    dernières appréhensions et effacer jusqu'aux souvenirs les plus\r\n    persistents.\r\n\r\n    \"Mais vous devez avoir autre chose à faire qu'à lire des lettres\r\n    inutiles.\r\n\r\n    \"Je vous serre les mains,\r\n\r\n    \"LÉON GAMBETTA.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was 'couched in such terms as to make it desirable to answer\r\nhim with some statement of the views of the Government,' and Sir Charles\r\nconsulted Lord Granville about his reply, which would 'really be a\r\ndespatch,' and must 'say something about 1870' and the period of Lord\r\nGranville's previous tenure of the Foreign Office. With recollections of\r\nthat time in their minds, and of England's entry upon the Black Sea\r\nConference without the presence of a French representative, French\r\npoliticians had commented very jealously upon some references to Gambetta\r\nin a speech delivered by Lord Granville at Hanley in March of this year.\r\nLord Granville accordingly sent Dilke a memorandum in his own hand,\r\nsuggesting words for the reply. Gambetta was to be told that a speech\r\n\"made before the election\" had been interpreted by some of his supporters\r\nin the Press \"as of a personal character against him,\" that Dilke knew\r\nthis to have been \"the reverse of the speaker's intention,\" and that he\r\nwould be glad to have a talk with Gambetta on the subject of Lord\r\nGranville's policy during the war when he next had the opportunity of\r\nmeeting him in Paris.\r\n\r\n'But it was indeed difficult for Lord Granville to say anything about his\r\npolicy during the war which would please the French.' Gambetta's official\r\nreply was, however, that, having read Lord Granville's speech, he found it\r\n\"proper under the circumstances and impartial,\" and that, although \"absurd\r\nideas with regard to our recent elections had been ascribed to himself,\"\r\nhe had \"desired nothing in those elections\" except Sir Charles's personal\r\ntriumph. To this Lord Granville rejoined: \"Please thank M. Gambetta for\r\nhis friendly message. I presume you will not tell him that Lyons says his\r\nassertion about the elections is a tremendous cracker.\"\r\n\r\nSir Edward Malet, Resident at Cairo, [Footnote: Afterwards Ambassador at\r\nBerlin.] wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"We have had one Under-Secretary after another\" (at the Foreign\r\n    Office) \"who knows nothing about these affairs, and who has therefore\r\n    never been able to exert the legitimate influence to which his\r\n    position entitled him. It will now be different, and I hope soon to\r\n    recognize the thread of your thought in the texture of the Government\r\n    policy.\"\r\n\r\nM. Gennadius, the Greek Chargé d'Affaires, while the matter was still\r\nopen, implored him not to decline. \"All your Greek friends consider our\r\ncountry's cause as dependent on your acceptance. You have done much for us\r\nalready. Make this further sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles entered upon his functions on Thursday, April 29th, when his\r\ncolleague, the Permanent Under-Secretary, Lord Tenterden, took him round\r\nto be introduced to the heads of the various departments. For his private\r\nsecretary he chose Mr. George Murray, [Footnote: Now the Right Hon. Sir G.\r\nMurray, G.C.B.] \"an extraordinarily able man.\" But in a few weeks Mr.\r\nMurray was transferred to the Treasury, and afterwards became secretary to\r\nMr. Gladstone, and, later, to Lord Rosebery when Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n    'I found' (from Bourke, his predecessor, who had written to him with\r\n    great cordiality) 'that as Under-Secretary for the Foreign Office, I\r\n    had the Cabinet key--or most secret key that at that time there was:\r\n    another still more secret key being introduced after I was in the\r\n    Cabinet, and confined to the Cabinet itself. I found in the Foreign\r\n    Office that if I liked I might have got back the \"Department\" which\r\n    Lord Derby took away from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in 1874,\r\n    leaving him only the Commercial Department. [Footnote: The\r\n    \"Department\" assigned to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary before 1874\r\n    was 'control of' some branch of foreign affairs in its details. See\r\n    also below, p. 349.] But I at once decided that I would not have it,\r\n    as I wanted to concern myself with the Parliamentary business and with\r\n    the important business, instead of doing detailed work at the head of\r\n    one section of it.'\r\n\r\nOn the evening of his first day in office Sir Charles gave a dinner at\r\nSloane Street to several of his colleagues. There were present\r\n\r\n    'Fawcett, just appointed Postmaster-General, Lord Northbrook,\r\n    Childers, Forster, Hartington, and Goschen.... Chamberlain was at my\r\n    dinner, having taken up his quarters with me for a week....\r\n\r\n    'Hartington after dinner showed me Indian despatches which were very\r\n    startling. Mr. Goschen told us that he had refused the Governor-\r\n    Generalship of India and the Embassy at Constantinople, but he\r\n    afterwards took Constantinople. He appeared at this moment to have\r\n    made up his mind to stay in the House of Commons to oppose\r\n    equalization of the franchise and redistribution of seats....\r\n\r\n    'Forster told us that he was starting for Ireland to see whether he\r\n    could avoid some renewal of coercion; and Chamberlain and I told him\r\n    that he _must_ avoid it. This was the cloud no bigger than a man's\r\n    hand.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles goes on to tell how he stayed for a time its development:\r\n\r\n    'On the night of May 13th, between one and two o'clock in the morning,\r\n    I did a thing which many will say I ought not to have done--namely,\r\n    went down to a newspaper office to suggest an article against the\r\n    policy of another member of the Government. Under the circumstances, I\r\n    think that I was justified. I was not a member of the Privy Council or\r\n    of the Cabinet, and the interests of the party were at stake, as\r\n    subsequent events well showed. There was no shade of private or\r\n    personal interest in the matter. The effect of what I did was to stop\r\n    the policy of which I disapproved for the year, and might easily have\r\n    been to stop it for ever. I had found out in the course of the evening\r\n    that Forster was in favour of a Coercion Bill, and that the Cabinet\r\n    were likely to adopt it. I went down to the _Daily News_ office, and\r\n    told Hill, not even telling Chamberlain until two years afterwards\r\n    what I had done. The result of it was that the _Daily News_ had an\r\n    article the next morning which smashed Forster's plan.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nChamberlain had written on May 4th to Mrs. Pattison: \"The charmed circle\r\nhas been broken and a new departure made, which is an event in English\r\npolitical history.\" But although the circle was broken, only one man had\r\nfound his way to the innermost ring; and in the composition of the\r\nMinistry the Radicals were overwhelmingly outnumbered. Such a situation\r\ndid not lead to the stability of the Government, and by his reluctance in\r\nthe admission of Radicalism to office Mr. Gladstone had created\r\ndifficulties for himself. In the House his personal authority was\r\noverridden in a matter which came up at once.\r\n\r\n    'In the morning of May 3rd I received a note from Lord Frederick\r\n    Cavendish, the Secretary of the Treasury, asking me to be at the House\r\n    at two, as there would be trouble about Bradlaugh's application to\r\n    affirm instead of take the oath. It had been decided by the Cabinet\r\n    that \"Freddy\" Cavendish, [Footnote: Lord F. Cavendish was Financial\r\n    Secretary to the Treasury.] who was leader of the House in the absence\r\n    of the Ministers who had gone for re-election, should move for a\r\n    Committee, and I spoke in support of that view.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles never took part again in any debate upon this once famous\r\nstruggle. He supported Mr. Gladstone's view in favour of allowing\r\naffirmation, but he did so without heartiness, disliking 'the trade of\r\nliving on blatant atheism,' and finding in himself tendencies which led\r\nhim to fear that he was 'clerically minded.' He had always an extreme\r\ndislike of talk or writing that offended legitimate susceptibilities.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Ministry inevitably left some personal claims\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\n    'On May 1st I had John Morley to dinner to meet Chamberlain, who was\r\n    still staying with me. We talked over the men who had been left out.\r\n    Edmond Fitzmaurice was one, but Mr. Gladstone did not care about\r\n    having brothers. [Footnote: Mr. Gladstone was believed in 1868 to have\r\n    declined to have Lord Clarendon and his brother, Mr. Charles Villiers,\r\n    both in the Cabinet. See _Life of Granville,_ vol. i., p. 537. In the\r\n    new Government Lord Lansdowne was Under-Secretary for India, but\r\n    resigned in the course of the year on the Irish Land Question.] At\r\n    Chamberlain's wish Courtney had been offered the Secretaryship of the\r\n    Board of Trade, which, however, he declined. He would have taken the\r\n    place of Judge Advocate General, but it was not offered to him.\r\n    Chamberlain told us that the Cabinet were unanimous for getting rid of\r\n    Layard, the Ambassador at Constantinople, but that the Queen was\r\n    trying hard to keep him. The result of this difference of opinion\r\n    ultimately was that Goschen went to Constantinople on a special\r\n    embassy, without salary, and keeping his place in the House of\r\n    Commons, and that Layard continued to draw the salary without doing\r\n    any work.'\r\n\r\nA large section of the Liberal Press was at this period very independent,\r\nand helped to frustrate Mr. Gladstone's determination to exclude Radicals\r\nfrom office.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's relations with Mr. Hill, then editor of the _Daily News,_\r\nwere close, as also was the alliance between the two Radical Ministers and\r\nMr. John Morley, who had just then become editor of the _Pall Mall\r\nGazette_.\r\n\r\n    'On May 14th John Morley asked me to see him to give him information\r\n    as to the general position of foreign affairs, and I consented to do\r\n    so. \"It would be worth silver and gold and jewels,\" he said, \"if I\r\n    could have ten minutes with you about three times a week.\"'\r\n\r\nChamberlain gave him the same privilege concerning domestic policy--a\r\nprivilege 'which he used so well that no complaint ever arose in regard to\r\nit.' Chamberlain was much in touch with 'Escott of the _Standard_ and the\r\n_World_.'\r\n\r\nIt was suggested at the dinner of May 1st that Mr. Courtney might succeed\r\nSir H. Drummond Wolff on the Commission for Reforms, appointed under\r\nArticle XXIII. of the Treaty of Berlin, for the European provinces of\r\nTurkey and Crete; but this too Mr. Courtney declined, and the place was\r\neventually filled by Lord E. Fitzmaurice. Mr. Trevelyan was not included\r\nin the Ministry. [Footnote: See the _Life of Goschen_, by the Hon. Arthur\r\nElliot, vol. i., pp. 215, 216; T. E. Holland, _The European Concert in the\r\nEastern Question_, pp. 291, 292; also _Turkey_, No. 15 (1880). Lord E.\r\nFitzmaurice was subsequently appointed British Plenipotentiary, under\r\nArticles LIV. and LV. of the Treaty of Berlin, to the Conference in regard\r\nto the navigation of the Danube. Both Mr. Courtney and Mr. Trevelyan\r\njoined the Ministry later.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment Conservative society was inclined to regard the new Ministry\r\nwith suspicious wonder, and Sir Charles tells how, on May 5th, a week\r\nafter taking office, when he and Chamberlain were dining with the Prince\r\nof Wales--\r\n\r\n    'most of the Cabinet were present with their wives; also the new\r\n    Viceroy of India (Lord Ripon), and Rosebery and his wife. When the\r\n    Duke of Cambridge came in, following the Prince and Princess, after\r\n    shaking hands with those he knew, he stood staring about, whereupon\r\n    Harcourt, nudging Chamberlain and myself, said, \"He is looking for\r\n    Bradlaugh.\"'\r\n\r\nNew men were coming to the front; a new political era had begun, and to\r\nthe Radicals the situation was summed up by the House of Commons' jest\r\nwhich stated that B.C. now meant \"Before Chamberlain,\" and A.D. \"Anno\r\nDilke.\"\r\n\r\nThe break with the past was real and important: 1880 is a marking date in\r\nthe political history of Great Britain, and the change was due to the\r\nRadical combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nAT THE FOREIGN OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn \"a memorandum of later years,\" quoted by his biographer, Mr. Gladstone\r\ndefined his own understanding of \"the special commission under which the\r\nGovernment had taken office\" in 1880. \"It related to the foreign policy of\r\nthe country, the whole spirit and effect of which we were to reconstruct.\"\r\nSir Charles's views as to the need for this had long been before the\r\npublic, and he threw all his energies into the task of helping to achieve\r\nit.\r\n\r\n    'The Liberals, having come into office after violent denunciation of\r\n    the whole foreign and colonial policy of their predecessors, had a\r\n    general wish to reverse it in all parts of the world, and to dismiss\r\n    the agents by whom it had been carried out. They were especially\r\n    violent against Lytton in India, Layard at Constantinople, and Frere\r\n    in South Africa.'\r\n\r\nQuestions of the Indian frontier and Africa lay outside the immediate\r\nsphere of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, yet he was constantly\r\nconsulted upon both of them, and had his full part in defending the\r\nreversal of Lord Lytton's policy by the new Viceroy, Lord Ripon, who\r\nrestored, or perhaps established, the unity of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of South Africa, the Boer leaders wrote at once to express\r\ntheir confidence that the new Government would consist of \"men who look\r\nout for the honour and glory of England, not by acts of injustice and\r\ncrushing force, but by the way of justice and good faith.\" They were\r\nanswered by promises of local self-government, but such promises had been\r\nmade to them before, and the retention of Sir Bartle Frere no doubt seemed\r\na bad omen. So, at all events, it was regarded by the Radical party. On\r\nMay 24th--\r\n\r\n    'I found that Courtney and my brother, with Dr. Cameron and Jesse\r\n    Collings, were getting up an attempt to coerce the Colonial Office and\r\n    Mr. Gladstone by preparing a list of between one and two hundred\r\n    members who would vote with Wilfrid Lawson for a censure on the\r\n    Government for not recalling Frere. Childers had found that it would\r\n    be easy to recall him, for Frere had said that he would only go out\r\n    for two years, and the two years were over. No doubt Frere, while\r\n    blameworthy for the Zulu War, was not responsible for the Transvaal\r\n    business, which had been done by Shepstone and Lord Carnarvon before\r\n    he went out; but with our people he received the whole discredit for\r\n    all that went wrong in South Africa, and it was impossible to wonder\r\n    at this when one recalled the language that he habitually made use\r\n    of....\r\n\r\n    'Frere was protected by Mr. Gladstone, and allowed to remain, a\r\n    mistake for which we very gravely suffered. As this matter became of\r\n    great importance in 1899, I ought to add that Lord Granville backed\r\n    Mr. Gladstone in abstaining from rescinding the annexation of the\r\n    Transvaal, on the ground that as we were retiring from Kandahar we had\r\n    better not also retire from Pretoria.'\r\n\r\nWhen, a few months later, the Boer rising followed, Dilke, with three\r\nother Radical Ministers, Bright, Chamberlain, and Courtney, refused to\r\ndefend the Government's action even by a silent vote. 'Everything went as\r\nbadly as possible in South Africa, and Lord Kimberley' (the Colonial\r\nSecretary) 'must share the blame with Mr. Gladstone.'\r\n\r\nThe third instance in which the recall of a man was demanded by Liberal\r\nopinion as essential to the reversal of a policy touched matters in whose\r\ndevelopment Sir Charles had a considerable part to play:\r\n\r\n    '_May 20th._--One of our first troubles in debate was with regard to\r\n    Layard's position at Constantinople, we being attacked by our own\r\n    people on May 20th, who were more Gladstonian than Mr. Gladstone, as\r\n    to the public insults which Layard had heaped upon him. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    discussed with me what he was to say, and I have his note which, in\r\n    addition to the statement about Layard, contains the curiously large\r\n    one, \"Statements made in Opposition not to be taken too literally when\r\n    in office.\"'\r\n\r\nNext day Mr. Gladstone wrote: \"Thank you for the wonderful despatch you\r\nkindly made in obtaining for me the particulars about Layard's\r\nappointment.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Under-Secretary writes of these early days and first impressions:\r\n\r\n    'The general opinion of the party was that a Liberal policy was being\r\n    pursued in foreign affairs, and that we had in the Foreign Office\r\n    carried out that which the country intended us to do. We were able to\r\n    bring about joint action on the part of Europe, and by means of it to\r\n    settle the Greek and Montenegrin questions; and Goschen's presence at\r\n    Constantinople was useful, inasmuch as he fully shared the views of\r\n    the Liberal party upon foreign affairs, although he differed from them\r\n    in domestic matters. On the other hand, the party were frightened\r\n    about India, for, although Lord Lytton had been removed, the\r\n    Government refused to make any sign as to the immediate evacuation of\r\n    Kandahar, and, as a matter of fact, it was a long time before the\r\n    Queen's resistance upon this point could be overcome. She no doubt\r\n    felt more able to stand out against Hartington, whom she liked, than\r\n    against Lord Granville.' [Footnote: See _Life of Granville_, vol. ii.,\r\n    p. 5.]\r\n\r\nLord Lytton's policy is thus described:\r\n\r\n    'The _Allgemeine Zeitung_ for one of the last days of February\r\n    contained a remarkable disclosure of the Government scheme for the\r\n    settlement of Afghan affairs, which, so far as I know, did not appear\r\n    in the English newspapers. It was quoted from some Indian paper, and\r\n    revealed the fact that Persia was to occupy Herat, Kabul and Kandahar\r\n    being capitals of two separate States. I did not at the time believe\r\n    that it was possible that the Government should have absolutely\r\n    reversed the past British policy by proposing the cession of Herat to\r\n    Persia, but when I came into office at the end of April I made\r\n    immediate inquiry into the subject, and found that it was true, and\r\n    that they had done so. It was afterwards admitted.'\r\n\r\nThis proposal, however, had been declined by Persia. Before the fall of\r\nthe Beaconsfield Ministry--\r\n\r\n    'The Amir of Afghanistan had written to tell us that he must be the\r\n    friend of Russia, though he would be our friend too. We had replied\r\n    (that is to say, the outgoing Government had replied) that Russia had\r\n    sworn to us to have no dealings with Afghanistan, but that we should\r\n    in any case evacuate his country in October without conditions,\r\n    although he must respect our hold on Kandahar. Persia, it was clear\r\n    from Lytton's despatches, had acted under Russian influence when\r\n    declining Herat on our conditions.'\r\n\r\nUnder Lord Ripon, the policy of breaking up Afghanistan disappeared. But\r\nalthough there was a clear intention to abandon all claim to remain in\r\nKandahar, yet the difficulty which attends any retrogressive movement in\r\nCentral Asia was at this moment intensified, because Russia was\r\nthreatening to advance on Merv, only 250 miles from Herat; and it seemed\r\nas if the Tsar's troops might occupy one Afghan stronghold at the moment\r\nwhen the Queen's forces withdrew from another.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville showed me, 15th May, some notes of language which he\r\n    intended to hold to Russia as to Central Asia, very strong indeed upon\r\n    the question of Merv; but the Cabinet afterwards took all this out,\r\n    not a single man being found in the Cabinet to back up Lord Granville\r\n    upon this question.'\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding months Sir Charles maintained a steady correspondence\r\nwith the new Viceroy, Lord Ripon, who described his task as a hard one.\r\n\"But I will do my best to perform it faithfully, and trust to you to back\r\nme up.\" In it appears the reason for Lord Ripon's unwilling acceptance of\r\nAbdurrahman, whom he called \"the most Russian of the candidates\" for the\r\nAfghan throne, but also the inevitable choice. If Lord Ripon broke with\r\nhim, no hope appeared of establishing \"even a semblance of order\" before\r\nthe Indian Government withdrew the troops, \"as,\" said the Viceroy, \"we\r\n_must_, because the service in Afghanistan, especially in winter, is so\r\nunpopular with the native troops as to be a serious difficulty if it\r\nshould continue long. I hate the idea of leaving the Afghans a prey to\r\nanarchy, created to some extent, at all events, by our policy, and I shall\r\ndo all I can to avoid it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Question was still dominant. The Treaty of Berlin had left\r\nthree sources of discontent in the region affected by its provisions. In\r\nBulgaria, Turkey complained that the Bulgarians had not fulfilled their\r\npromise to disarm and to raze fortifications. In Greece, evasive\r\nnegotiations concerning the promised 'rectification of the frontier' were\r\nbeing deliberately spun out. On the Montenegrin border, territory\r\nsurrendered and evacuated by the Turks had immediately been occupied by\r\nMohammedan Albanians before the Montenegrin troops could reach it.\r\n\r\n    'On my first examination of the papers at the Foreign Office, I found\r\n    that the black spot was Montenegro; the Roman Catholic Albanians on\r\n    the frontier and the Mahomedan Albanians being equally determined not\r\n    to become Montenegrin, and the Montenegrins insisting either on the\r\n    line of the Treaty, which would give them some Mahomedan, or on the\r\n    lines of the \"Corti compromise,\" which would give them some Roman\r\n    Catholic Albanian subjects.' [Footnote: The \"Corti compromise\" was so\r\n    named after the Italian Ambassador at Constantinople, who advocated a\r\n    frontier line more favourable to Turkey than those previously proposed\r\n    (Sir Edward Hertslet's _Map of Europe by Treaty_, vol. iv.).]\r\n\r\nImmediate steps were taken to remove the menace to European tranquillity\r\nwhich arose from what the Austrian Ambassador called \"the Porte's long\r\ndelays and tergiversation.\"\r\n\r\n    '_May 1st._--Pressure at Constantinople had begun this day, the\r\n    Cabinet having on the previous day approved an excellent and firm\r\n    despatch from Lord Granville to Layard, really written from the first\r\n    word to the last by Tenterden, containing the phrase, \"While Her\r\n    Majesty's Government wish to abstain from anything like menace, any\r\n    intimation they give will be adhered to to the letter.\" The weak point\r\n    about the despatch, however, was that the Russians had written us a\r\n    despatch in the same sense, and that it might have been made to appear\r\n    that we were only acting under Russian dictation. At the same time the\r\n    despatch returned to the position of the circular bearing Lord\r\n    Salisbury's name, which I have called the April 1st (1878) Circular,\r\n    and set up that Concert of Europe which was destined to be kept\r\n    together until the Greek and Montenegrin frontier questions had been\r\n    settled....\r\n\r\n    'On May 3rd the Cabinet again considered our circular despatch\r\n    (calling on the Powers to address an identic and simultaneous note to\r\n    the Porte to fulfil its Treaty obligations as regards Greece,\r\n    Montenegro, and Armenia) in its final form.... On May 4th I lunched\r\n    with Lord Granville, and found that it was finally settled that\r\n    Goschen would go as Ambassador to Constantinople and Edmond\r\n    Fitzmaurice in Wolff's place.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile France was vigorously backing the new policy. Lord Granville was\r\ndeeply engaged in trying to unite Germany with the Powers in carrying out\r\nconcerted action, which was constantly evaded by Bismarck.\r\n\r\n    '_May 7th_.--On this day I had an opportunity of reading quietly a\r\n    curious despatch of Odo Russell, dated April 29th, recounting the\r\n    views of Prince Bismarck, who seemed to me to have been laughing at\r\n    him. The Prince \"is even more willing to give his support to any\r\n    combined policy of England and France, as for instance in Egypt,\r\n    because he looks upon an Anglo-French alliance as the basis of peace\r\n    and order in Europe.\" [Footnote: This despatch is to be found in the\r\n    _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., p. 211, where the date is given as May\r\n    1st.]\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, May 9th, I had to dinner Léon Say, the new French\r\n    Ambassador; Montebello, his first secretary, afterwards Ambassador at\r\n    Constantinople; Lord Lyons and his secretary Sheffield; Lord\r\n    Tenterden, my colleague at the Foreign Office; my secretary Murray;\r\n    Harcourt, and C. E. D. Black, who the week afterwards became\r\n    Harcourt's secretary on my recommendation. Léon Say brought with him\r\n    from the French \"bag\" Gambetta's answer to my letter. Gambetta\r\n    informed me that the French Government were unanimous in throwing over\r\n    Waddington's compromise and giving Greece all that she had been\r\n    intended to have; and Gambetta was in favour, and said that his Prime\r\n    Minister' (M. de Freycinet) 'was in favour, of taking active steps to\r\n    prevent further delay on the part of Turkey.'

He did not think that the Foreign Office was the proper department\r\nto administer dependencies, and accordingly, within a few days of taking\r\noffice, he raised the question whether there was any ground for keeping\r\nCyprus under the Foreign Office, and suggested its transfer to the\r\nColonial Office. In this Lord Granville concurred. But--\r\n\r\n    'Philip Currie, who as head of the Turkish department was managing the\r\n    affairs of Cyprus, did not want to lose it, and asked to be allowed to\r\n    prepare a memorandum in the opposite sense, and Lord Granville wrote,\r\n    \"I do not expect to be converted by Currie's memorandum. Do you? If\r\n    not, the Colonial Office will have to bolt it.\" The Colonial Office\r\n    did have to bolt it, for the island was soon handed over to them!'\r\n\r\nBy the close of the year, as has been seen, Sir Charles was able to report\r\nto his constituents \"that, acting under the instructions of Lord\r\nGranville, he had secured a greatly improved administration for this\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 21st--\r\n\r\n    'Egypt began to trouble me, and I was not to be clear of the\r\n    embarrassment which it caused for several years. I wrote to Lord\r\n    Granville to say that I had been sounded through Rivers Wilson as to\r\n    how the Government would take the appointment of a Nubar Ministry with\r\n    an English Finance Minister,' and Sir Charles again warned Lord\r\n    Granville of dissensions between the English representatives in Egypt.\r\n\r\nIt became the most serious of all the embarrassments which involved Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government. On May 8th--\r\n\r\n    'I had to see Lord Ripon, who had appointed Colonel Gordon to be his\r\n    private secretary, and to inform him privately that the Foreign Office\r\n    feared that he would find him too excitable to be possible as a\r\n    secretary, which, indeed, very speedily proved to be the case.'\r\n\r\nGordon resigned before Lord Ripon reached India, and on June 14th\r\ntelegraphed to Sir Charles--\r\n\r\n    'to know whether we would let him take service again with the Chinese.\r\n    I saw a friend of his in London, one of the Chinese Commissioners of\r\n    Customs, and asked whether Gordon could be got to telegraph that he\r\n    would refuse any military command in the event of war between China\r\n    and Russia. He said he thought so, and I told Lord Granville, who\r\n    wrote back, \"I have told the Duke of Cambridge that on these\r\n    conditions he might have leave.\"'\r\n\r\nLord Ripon wrote on his arrival:\r\n\r\n    \"... So, you see, your warnings about Gordon came true. It is\r\n    fortunate that the arrangement came to an end before I got here. As it\r\n    is, there is no real harm done; we parted the best of friends, and I\r\n    learned to my astonishment, after I left him at Bombay, that he was\r\n    off for China.\"\r\n\r\nSo passes out of sight for the moment, but only for the moment, this\r\nfateful personality.\r\n\r\nAn immediate trouble, however, arose out of the Anglo-Turkish Convention\r\nof 1878, by which Great Britain had been pledged to defend Turkey's\r\npossessions in Asia Minor on condition that necessary reforms in\r\ngovernment were introduced. This pledge made England indirectly\r\nresponsible for the character of Turkish rule in Armenia; and Sir Charles\r\nhad repeatedly expressed the view that England was committed to more than\r\nshe could perform, either as against Russia or on behalf of Armenia. On\r\nMay 14th the Cabinet left in the draft of instructions to Mr. Goschen 'a\r\npassage of Tenterden's, in which we recognized the Asia Minor Convention\r\nof our predecessors.... But I induced Lord Granville to strike it out\r\nafter the Cabinet on his own responsibility.'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since the Convention existed, Sir Charles held that by\r\nabrogating it they 'might appear to invite the Russians to invade Armenia,\r\nwhich Russia might proceed to do in the name of humanity.' So far as\r\nTurkey was concerned, it was considered likely that the Porte would wish\r\nto see the Convention annulled, because it could then sell Cyprus to Great\r\nBritain for cash instead of leasing it in return for the Asiatic\r\nguarantee; and Turkish Pashas would be free from any interference about\r\nreforms in Asia Minor. Ultimately the fear of letting Russia in outweighed\r\nthe other considerations, and the Convention was recognized, leaving\r\nEngland with a heavy burden of moral responsibility for all that\r\nsubsequently occurred in Armenia under the protection of what Mr.\r\nGladstone himself had not unjustly called this \"insane covenant.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Musurus Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador, was complaining to Lord\r\nGranville that 'the Sultan had assented to the Convention under a false\r\nimpression, not knowing that a portion of his dominions would be given\r\nover to Austrian control, an alienation not contemplated by the Treaty of\r\nSan Stefano.' He complained, moreover, that the arrangement went, in\r\nreality, beyond temporary occupation of provinces. 'We (Lord Salisbury)\r\nhad given Bosnia and Herzegovina secretly to Austria without reserve.'\r\n\r\nThe whole Eastern situation was ill-defined and full of difficulties. Mr.\r\nGoschen, before he left England on his mission, came to Dilke to 'bewail\r\nthe unwillingness of Gladstone and of Lord Granville to make up their\r\nminds how far they were going in the direction of coercion of Turkey.' On\r\nMay 26th--\r\n\r\n    'Looking about to see how Turkey was to be coerced with regard to the\r\n    Greek and Montenegrin questions, I discovered that all reinforcements\r\n    and officials were sent, and all money received by the Constantinople\r\n    Government, by the sea route, so that a blockade of the Dardanelles\r\n    would cut their Empire in two until they came to terms.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's aim throughout all these frontier negotiations was to\r\nsupport the claims of Greece, left indefinite by the Berlin Treaty. At\r\nGreat Britain's instance, the Greeks had refrained from attacking Turkey\r\nwhen Turkey was engaged with Russia; but the Treaty of Berlin had only\r\npromised to Greece in general terms \"a rectification of frontier.\" On the\r\nother hand, the Treaty had awarded to Montenegro certain districts of\r\nAlbania, which, as already stated; showed great repugnance to accept\r\nMontenegrin rule. Sir Charles now conceived a plan--\r\n\r\n    \"for combining Albanian autonomy with personal union with Greece,\r\n    finding that the Albanians were willing to accept the King of the\r\n    Hellenes, provided they succeeded in obtaining securities or\r\n    privileges for the Roman Catholic Church, to which great numbers of\r\n    them belonged.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 28th he learnt from the Greek Chargé d'Affaires that proposals for\r\nsuch a personal union had been made to the King of Greece, directly and\r\nvery secretly, \"on the part of a Turkish statesman.\" The Southern\r\nAlbanians, wrote M. Gennadius, are to all intents and purposes Greeks.\r\nBut, the latter added, \"the initiative ought to proceed from the\r\nAlbanians.\" A few days later Mr. Goschen wrote from Constantinople that\r\nthe proposed union would be a solution \"very valuable for Europe,\" but\r\nthat the Turks would struggle hard to outbid the Greeks, and the Albanians\r\nwere very strong in the Palace, and were trusted all over the Empire.\r\nStill, autonomy, Mr. Goschen thought, the Albanians \"would and must have\r\nin some shape.\" [Footnote: See also _Life of Goschen_, vol. ii., pp. 215,\r\n216.]\r\n\r\nIn their attempt to reverse the Beaconsfield policy there was one\r\ninfluence steadily opposed to the Government.\r\n\r\n    'On June 11th there went out a despatch, which had been for several\r\n    days on the stocks, as to the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It had come\r\n    back on the 10th from the Queen, who had written by the side of our\r\n    words: \"The acquisition of Cyprus is, in their view, of no advantage\r\n    to the country either in a military or political sense.\" \"I do not in\r\n    the least agree in this.--V.R.I.\" But we sent it, all the same.'\r\n\r\nThe King of Greece had come to London, and on June 4th Sir Charles went by\r\nhis wish to Marlborough House, and had an hour's conversation, 'chiefly\r\nupon the question of personal union with Albania, but partly with regard\r\nto the past, as to which I received his thanks.' 'I thought him a very\r\nable man, an opinion which I have never changed.' All Europe confirmed\r\nthis judgment when the King of the Hellenes was struck down more than\r\nthirty years later in the very achievement of his long-planned schemes. In\r\n1880 the note of disparagement was widespread; but Sir Charles was not\r\nalone in his estimate:\r\n\r\n    'Dizzy was once, after this date, talking to me and the Duchess of\r\n    Manchester about him, and the Duchess said to me: \"How you Liberals\r\n    have deceived that poor little King!\" Whereupon Dizzy replied: \"It\r\n    would take a very clever Government to deceive that youth.\"'\r\n\r\nElsewhere Sir Charles wrote that the King was a \"good talker, but\r\nacademic,\" and, dining at Marlborough House on June 6th, he heard an\r\nestimate of him as the too industrious apprentice:\r\n\r\n    'A big aide-de-camp of the King of Greece took more champagne than was\r\n    good for him, and was extremely funny. Pointing to his King, he said:\r\n    \"Now, there is my King. He is a good little King; but he is not what I\r\n    call a fashionable King.\" And then, pointing to the Prince of Wales,\r\n    he said: \"Now, that is what I call a fashionable Prince--_un Prince\r\n    vraiment 'chic.'_ He goes to bed late, it is true, but he gets up--\r\n    well, never. That is what I call a really fashionable Prince. My King\r\n    gets up at six!\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles met the King repeatedly during the next fortnight, to follow\r\nout, with the maps, the military details of the proposed new frontier. As\r\nsoon as the French and Austrian Governments had accepted the British\r\nproposal for a Conference at Berlin to settle the question of the\r\nfrontiers, and Bismarck had consented to call it, Lord Odo Russell wrote\r\nthat he would have to \"act on the Greek Frontier Commission, in which\r\nDilke was better versed than anyone,\" and begged Sir Charles to \"lend him\r\nhis lights,\" 'which,' says the Memoir, 'I had to proceed to do' by an\r\nexhaustive letter.\r\n\r\nA naval demonstration in the Adriatic now followed, generally known as\r\n'the Dulcigno demonstration,' carried out by ships of the concerted\r\nPowers, under command of the senior Admiral present, and acting under a\r\n_protocole de désintéressement_. It was imposing rather than formidable,\r\nsince France and Italy both instructed their officers in no case to fire a\r\nshot. But it was powerfully reinforced by the threat of independent\r\nBritish action, on the lines which Sir Charles Dilke suggested, and, so\r\nhelped, it did its work, so far as the Montenegrin question was concerned.\r\nThe Greek question still remained for settlement.\r\n\r\nPhases in the development of this situation are thus chronicled:\r\n\r\n    'On June 23rd I went to the State Ball, and had a good deal of talk\r\n    with Musurus, to try and find out about a curious business which I\r\n    noted in my diary as follows: \"The Russians and Turks are working\r\n    together. The Russians came yesterday to propose to send 20,000\r\n    Russian men in English ships to coerce Turkey, and the Turks tell us\r\n    to-day that they will yield to an occupation by a European force, but\r\n    not to a mere naval demonstration. Both want to raise the difficulties\r\n    which this will cause, and to fish in troubled waters.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, June 30th, at three o'clock, an interview took place\r\n    between Lord Granville, Lord Northbrook' (First Lord of the\r\n    Admiralty), 'Childers' (Secretary of State for War), 'Sir John Adye'\r\n    (Childers' adviser), 'and myself at the Foreign Office as to the means\r\n    of coercing Turkey. The War Office wished to place an army corps in\r\n    Greece, which, if they were to send a full complement of guns, would\r\n    take a month. I suggested the far cheaper plan of a naval occupation\r\n    of the port of Smyrna, and the collection and stoppage of customs and\r\n    dues. Mr. Gladstone came in a little late, and took up my idea. But,\r\n    preferring his Montenegrins to my Greeks, he insisted that we should\r\n    first deal by the fleet with the Montenegrin question at Dulcigno.\r\n    Both ideas went forward. The Dulcigno demonstration took place, and\r\n    produced the cession of territory to the Montenegrins; and we\r\n    afterwards let out to the Turks our intentions with regard to Smyrna,\r\n    and produced by this means the cession of territory to Greece.\r\n    [Footnote: _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., p. 231.]\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, July 1st, we had a further interview with the Admiralty\r\n    to arrange our naval demonstrations. On this day there came to see me\r\n    Professor Panariétoff, a secret agent of the Prince of Bulgaria. He\r\n    informed me that his Government intended to press on a union between\r\n    Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia. They did not see any reason why they\r\n    should wait. It might suit the English Liberal Cabinet that they\r\n    should wait; but from their point of view, why wait? At a party in the\r\n    evening I met Borthwick, who playfully assured me that he knew that\r\n    our policy was to send one army corps to Greece to support the Greeks\r\n    against the Turks, and another to Eastern Roumelia to support the\r\n    Turks in maintaining the Treaty of Berlin. The two, after each of them\r\n    had accomplished its mission, would probably, he thought, come into\r\n    hostilities with one another in Macedonia.'\r\n\r\nOn July 5th the Austrian Ambassador, Count Karolyi, told Sir Charles that\r\nthe Turkish representative at Vienna had been solemnly warned to reckon no\r\nlonger upon the possibility of disagreement among the Powers, and to\r\nconsider 'the danger which would result if the Powers became convinced\r\nthat the Porte had no respect either for their pledges or its own.' This\r\nDilke hailed as 'a great step in advance on Austria's part,' and on July\r\n7th he called at the Austrian Embassy, at the wish of the Ambassador, who\r\nexplained the views of his Government:\r\n\r\n    'It would send two ships to meet two ships of each Power that chose to\r\n    send any, to watch the Montenegro coast with a view to carrying out\r\n    the Dulcigno proposal if the Porte would not give effect to the Corti\r\n    compromise within three weeks.' Count Karolyi 'then went on to speak\r\n    warmly in favour of the future of Greece, and to say that as regarded\r\n    the Greek frontier Austria would be willing even to send troops.'\r\n\r\nPublic feeling in Austria, it appeared, was willing to sanction much\r\nstronger measures in support of Greece than it would tolerate on behalf of\r\nMontenegro. The British Foreign Office now proceeded to utilize the\r\nposition of vantage which had been gained.\r\n\r\n    'On July 16th I noted that, Lord Granville having urged the Queen to\r\n    write an autograph letter to the Sultan of a nature to induce him to\r\n    give in, the Queen very naturally refused, on the ground that she\r\n    dissented from every proposition in the draft sent her. She offered to\r\n    write a mild word of advice or recommendation to him to yield without\r\n    bloodshed, and this proposal was accepted by the Government. A\r\n    telegram based on it was despatched on the 17th, and it asked in the\r\n    name of united Europe for a complete fulfilment of the conditions of\r\n    the Treaty of Berlin. The Sultan had at this moment despatched a\r\n    secret agent, a French advocate at Constantinople, to Gambetta, who\r\n    assured him that it was because France was interested in the\r\n    maintenance of the Ottoman Empire that it was absolutely necessary to\r\n    force Turkey to allow herself to be saved.\r\n\r\n    'The attitude of the French Government had begun to embarrass us a\r\n    good deal. On July 28th I wrote to Gambetta that we could not\r\n    understand the hesitations of the French Government, which was\r\n    continually putting in reserves. All this was known at Constantinople,\r\n    and augmented the resistance of the Porte; the Prime Minister's paper\r\n    was attacking us, and Gambetta's paper (the _République Française_)\r\n    giving us no support.... In his telegraphic reply Gambetta used words\r\n    of encouragement with regard to the attitude of his Government, as to\r\n    which, no doubt, he was himself finding a good deal of trouble. A\r\n    little later he sent over one of his private secretaries with a fuller\r\n    letter.'\r\n\r\nA conversation with Gambetta would have been valuable to Sir Charles at\r\nthis moment, and he regretted having to forgo an opportunity which\r\noffered. He had procured invitations for--\r\n\r\n    'the Brasseys and Samuelson to the Cherbourg banquet, [Footnote: This\r\n    banquet was the occasion of Gambetta's famous Cherbourg speech, a\r\n    passage from which is inscribed on his monument in Paris.] which was\r\n    to be given to the President of the Republic and the Presidents of the\r\n    two Chambers (that is, Grévy, Gambetta, and Léon Say). Brassey asked\r\n    me to go with him in the _Sunbeam_. Although I should like to have\r\n    gone, I was under engagements in London; and I spent the Sunday\r\n    dismally ... instead of at Cherbourg with Gambetta.'\r\n\r\nBut he sent him messages by Mr. Bernhard Samuelson [Footnote: M.P. for\r\nBanbury; afterwards Sir Bernhard Samuelson.] which were quickly effective.\r\n\r\nAlso, although public opinion in Austria favoured Greece, Sir Charles had\r\nground for believing that Italian Ministers kept the Turks perfectly\r\ninformed, and that even while advising concession upon Montenegro, they\r\ndid so with the suggestion that the Greek claims might be the more easily\r\nresisted. Austria's concern was, of course, with the northern part of the\r\nIllyrian coast; Italy's with the southern. As he noted later in the year,\r\n'the European Concert was about as easy to manage as six horses to drive\r\ntandem.' Nevertheless, by the first week in August, 1880, he was able to\r\nwrite:\r\n\r\n    'A collective note had now been presented by the Powers to the Porte,\r\n    so that we had carried the Powers with us as fully in our Montenegrin\r\n    policy, represented by the collective note, as in our Greek policy,\r\n    represented by the previous Identic note--a most considerable success,\r\n    contrasting strongly with the failure which our foreign policy met\r\n    with two or three years later.'\r\n\r\nThese impressions were shared by Lord Ripon, who followed European and\r\ndomestic affairs keenly, from India. He wrote on August 17th:\r\n\r\n    \"I rejoice to see that the F.O. seems to be distancing all competitors\r\n    in the race of success, ... which\" (he added) \"in regard to some\r\n    parliamentary proceedings is not very high praise, you will be perhaps\r\n    inclined to say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nEven after the collective note had been presented, the European situation\r\nremained delicate and difficult through the mutual distrust of the Powers.\r\nOn August 9th Lord Granville, who through all these negotiations was\r\nexerting his greatest diplomatic skill in keeping Germany in the Concert,\r\nexpressed to Sir Charles his conviction that 'Bismarck had spies in the\r\nQueen's household, and knew everything that went on.' On the side of\r\nFrance matters improved. [Footnote: See _Life of Granville_, vol. ii.,\r\nchapter vi.]\r\n\r\n    'On the 8th I received, at last, a reply from Gambetta to my letters--\r\n    a reply in which he showed that he fully agreed with me, but that he\r\n    was not as a fact all-powerful with the Prime Minister (Freycinet).\r\n    The same post, however, brought me a letter from Lord Houghton, who\r\n    was at Vichy, and who complained that it was an unhealthy state of\r\n    things that Gambetta (who had talked freely to him while in Paris)\r\n    \"should exercise so much irresponsible power.\" ... The result of my\r\n    attempts to stir up Gambetta upon our side was seen in the report by\r\n    Bernhard Samuelson of Gambetta's conversation with him at Cherbourg on\r\n    Monday, August 9th, and in an article which appeared on Wednesday,\r\n    August 11th, and another on Friday, the 13th, in Gambetta's paper on\r\n    the coercion of the Turks. These articles were from the pen of\r\n    Barrère, who had been over in the previous week to see me, and were\r\n    written at the personal direction of Gambetta; and Adams (Secretary to\r\n    the Embassy) wrote from Paris on the 13th that the tone of the French\r\n    Government had correspondingly improved.'\r\n\r\nBut even while France assisted in one direction, she introduced fresh\r\ncomplications in another by her quickly maturing designs on Tunis--which\r\nhad been mentioned to Sir Charles by the French Ambassador, M. Léon Say,\r\nas early as June 8th. French diplomatists claimed an authorization from\r\nLord Salisbury. [Footnote: See Crispi's _Memoirs_, vol. ii., pp. 98-109\r\nand 121; _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., pp. 215, 270, 436, as to Tunis and\r\nTripoli.] \"How can you,\" he was reported to have said, during the\r\nconversations which attended the Congress of Berlin, \"leave Carthage to\r\nthe barbarians?\"\r\n\r\n    'It was on this day (June 8th, 1880) that I became fully aware of the\r\n    terms of Lord Salisbury's offer of Tunis to France, as to which he\r\n    misled the public, Lord Salisbury having, when reminded of the\r\n    statement, said privately that it was \"a private conversation,\" and\r\n    publicly that there was \"no foundation for the statement.\"'\r\n\r\nLater Sir Charles made inquiries of M. Say, who gave the dates of the two\r\nconversations as July 21st and 26th, 1878.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Salisbury made a denial which is on record at the Foreign Office\r\n    in his own handwriting in red ink, but this denial is dated July 16th\r\n    --_i.e._, before the conversations.'\r\n\r\nThe trouble developed rapidly. By August 14th, 1880, Italy was threatening\r\nto withdraw her Ambassador from Paris, 'on account of the receipt of\r\ninformation showing that the French intended to occupy Tunis under Lord\r\nSalisbury's permission.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment Sir Charles's health broke down. Two notes from his chief,\r\nLord Granville, are preserved, the first evidently sent across in the\r\noffice:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR DILKE,\r\n\r\n    \"Please don't be a d--d fool. Go home and do exactly what your doctor\r\n    tells you.\r\n\r\n    \"Yrs. G.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again on August 18th Lord Granville wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I must formally request you not to leave the house till you send me\r\n    the doctor's written statement that he has advised you to do so. I\r\n    consider myself an honorary member of the gouty faction, and entitled\r\n    to speak with weight on the folly of trying to bully the disorder.\"\r\n\r\nTo this friendly dictation the patient submitted till the 23rd, when he\r\ninsisted on going to the House to answer questions, but returned to bed,\r\nand next morning underwent an operation. [Footnote: He worked hard during\r\nhis enforced confinement to the house, and one of his visitors was M.\r\nJoseph Arnaud, one of Gambetta's secretaries, who was sent by his friend\r\nto reassure him as to the pressure he was using in the Frontier Question.\r\nIt is of M. Arnaud that Sir Charles tells a Gambetta story: 'G. was jovial\r\nto-day, November 12th, 1880. Arnaud having said that all the people to\r\nwhom tickets were given for the presidential tribune were grateful to\r\nGambetta, and all who were angry were angry with him--Arnaud--the reply\r\nwas: \"Tu ne comprends donc pas que tu es institué pour ça?\"'] In a few\r\ndays he was again in Parliament, where the peace party, headed by Sir\r\nWilfrid Lawson, had begun to denounce the naval demonstration against\r\nTurkey. In this they were backed by the Fourth Party, who spoke of it as\r\n\"the combined filibustering.\" However, on September 7th, the general\r\nquestion was raised on the motion for adjournment of the House, and Sir\r\nCharles, 'replying to the peace party on the one hand, and on the other to\r\nCowen, who attacked them in the name of Albanian nationality,' drew from\r\nLord Granville this compliment:\r\n\r\n    \"My mother once said that Clarendon--with a slight headache--was the\r\n    pleasantest man she knew. I will not say that an operation makes you\r\n    speak better, but it certainly does not prevent your speaking as well\r\n    as usual.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Party [Footnote: Dilke dates the birth of the Fourth Party at\r\nthe beginning of the Gladstone Ministry, and says: 'Gorst was its real\r\nbrain, the other two members (for Arthur Balfour hardly belonged to it)\r\ncontributing \"brass.\"'] were also busy in denunciation of the Government's\r\npolicy in Afghanistan, which had been finally determined on August 7th,\r\nwhen--\r\n\r\n    'the Cabinet directed Lord Hartington and Lord Ripon to retire from\r\n    Kandahar, although we had now heard of the intention of the Russians\r\n    to occupy Merv, a step on their part which was certain to make our\r\n    retirement from Kandahar unpopular with those who did not know its\r\n    necessity.'\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance even more certain to add to the unpopularity of the\r\nretirement was not then known to the Home Government. On July 26th, Lord\r\nRipon, writing to Sir Charles, complained of the \"embarrassing\r\nengagements\" with which \"Lytton's reckless proceedings\" had hampered him.\r\nOne of these engagements bound him to maintain Shere Ali as Wali of\r\nKandahar; and on July 27th, Ayub Khan, Shere Ali's rival, defeated at\r\nMaiwand the force under General Burrows which was supporting Great\r\nBritains' nominee. The policy of evacuation met with resistance in a\r\nquarter where such policies were always opposed. On September 7th Sir\r\nCharles left London to stay with Lord Granville at Walmer Castle, and Lord\r\nHartington joined them on the 9th.\r\n\r\n    'The Queen had written for the second time to Hartington urging with\r\n    great warmth that we should retain Kandahar, although, as Hartington\r\n    said, this meant, to India, an expenditure of four millions sterling a\r\n    year, on local troops, for no military return.... The Queen ... at\r\n    this moment was not only protesting strongly with regard to Kandahar,\r\n    but also, in cipher telegrams, against the naval demonstration....\r\n\r\n    'On September 20th Lord Granville, just starting for Balmoral, came to\r\n    see me. He told me that he thought of sending Dufferin to\r\n    Constantinople at the end of Goschen's special mission, and Paget to\r\n    Petersburg, and Layard to Rome if he could not get a pension out of\r\n    the Treasury for Layard.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen conceived the interests of England as Lord Beaconsfield had\r\npresented them. But Mr. Gladstone did not conceive of English interests as\r\nbound up with Turkish success, and wrote on September 21st:\r\n\r\n    \"If Turkey befools Europe at Dulcigno, we may as well shut up shop\r\n    altogether.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Chamberlain expressed his mind on questions of foreign\r\npolicy in their bearing on party politics:\r\n\r\n    \"Kandahar will have to be given up.... I only hope Hartington will\r\n    have the pluck to do it at once and before we get into some fresh\r\n    scrape. I observe the papers generally speak well of the session, the\r\n    Government, and especially of the Radicals. So far so good. We have\r\n    scored very well up to this time.\"\r\n\r\n    'In another letter Chamberlain added:\r\n\r\n    '\"What about the Concert of Europe? Will it last through a bombardment\r\n    of Dulcigno? I don't much like concerts. Our party of two, with\r\n    Dillwyn as chorus, was about as numerous as is consistent with\r\n    harmony, and I fear five great Powers are too many to make a happy\r\n    family.\"'\r\n\r\nIn France the great ally of the Sultan's Fabian policy had fallen. M. de\r\nFreycinet found himself forced to resign on September 19th:\r\n\r\n    'On September 9th I recorded that Gambetta means to turn out\r\n    Freycinet. He foretold all this when Freycinet took office, and said\r\n    to me at that time: \"He will do well enough until he tries to fly. But\r\n    one of these days he will set off flying.\" Gambetta turned out\r\n    Freycinet on this occasion, but the day was to come when Freycinet\r\n    would turn out Gambetta.'\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd Sir Charles 'heard from Paris that the fallen Minister \"had\r\nbeen discovered to have been negotiating with the Vatican for months,\r\nwithout the knowledge even of his own colleagues.\"'\r\n\r\nIn the new Ministry, with Jules Ferry as Prime Minister, the Foreign\r\nOffice fell to Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, [Footnote: M. Barthélemy Saint-\r\nHilaire, born in 1805, the well-known philosophical writer and translator\r\nof Aristotle, was now seventy-five years of age. He entered the Chamber of\r\nDeputies in 1848 as a member of the Left, and became a member of the\r\nSenate in 1876. He was the first Secrétaire-Général de la Présidence de la\r\nRépublique.] and Lord Houghton said: \"Think of the old Aristotelian\r\nBarthélemy having the F.O.! Without pretension, I think at my age I am\r\njust as fit for the English one.\" This was a view in which Sir Charles\r\ninclined to agree, although M. Barrère wrote: \"Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire's\r\ntendencies are excellent. He is in complete accord with _us_, and his\r\nviews are wholly ours.\"\r\n\r\nLord Houghton also spoke of an interview with Moltke, who had told him\r\nthat 'Russia was the cause of the necessity for the immense arming of\r\nEurope, not France, which at present might be trusted to keep quiet.'\r\n\r\n    'On September 28th I noted: \"Cabinet suddenly and most unexpectedly\r\n    summoned for Thursday to sit on Parnell, the Sultan, and the Queen,\r\n    about Ireland, Dulcigno, and Kandahar respectively.\"... [Footnote: The\r\n    decisions as to the Irish difficulties are dealt with in the first\r\n    portion of Chapter XXII., pp. 343-348.]\r\n\r\n    'On September 30th Chamberlain, who was staying at Sloane Street, gave\r\n    me a note of what passed at the Cabinet. With regard to Kandahar, the\r\n    Generals whose names had been suggested by the Queen had been\r\n    consulted, and had, of course, pronounced against giving it up. So the\r\n    Queen had got her own way sufficiently for the matter to be left over\r\n    till after Christmas. The Cabinet were evidently sorry that they had\r\n    not more fully and more early adopted my suggestion of British\r\n    coercion of the Turks at Smyrna. And on this occasion they agreed to\r\n    try to induce the other Powers to agree upon (1) local action, or (2)\r\n    the seizure of a material guarantee: (1) meaning a demonstration at\r\n    the Dardanelles, and (2) meaning Crete.'\r\n\r\nBut the Eastern, unlike the Irish, trouble was now nearing a close,\r\nthough--\r\n\r\n    'On October 1st Lord Granville came to sit with me, and was very\r\n    gloomy. He thought that Mr. Gladstone was inclined to give in to the\r\n    Turks rather than resort to coercion. Harcourt came in also--at one\r\n    moment, \"Whatever we do, we must not be snubbed,\" and the next, \"After\r\n    all, it will be no worse than Palmerston and Denmark.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's plan for the seizure of Smyrna was now agreed to in\r\nprinciple by the Ministers in London, but while it still remained\r\nuncertain whether they could carry other Powers with them in this coup,\r\nLord Lyons, British Ambassador at Paris, had written expressing a wish to\r\nsee, Dilke concerning negotiations for a commercial treaty, 'and the\r\nForeign Office also desired that I should deal with the Danube question\r\nlater.' Sir Charles left London on October 11th.\r\n\r\n    'Before I left, Lord Granville showed me a letter from Hartington from\r\n    Balmoral saying that the Queen had not named Kandahar to him, and had\r\n    \"agreed to the Smyrna seizure project,\" but was angry about Ireland.\r\n    Hartington added that he had pledged Forster to put down Parnell. As\r\n    to her not naming Kandahar, Lord Granville said that she never\r\n    attacked the policy of a department to its chief.'\r\n\r\nAt Paris Sir Charles was warned by Lord Lyons that '\"you will find the\r\nFrench Foreign Office in some confusion, as the new Under-Secretary of\r\nState is vigorously employed in 'purging' it of clericals and\r\nreactionaries.\"' On October 12th he went with Lord Lyons to see Barthélemy\r\nSaint-Hilaire, and also Jules Ferry, the Prime Minister, and Tirard, the\r\nMinister of Commerce, with whom he would be principally brought into\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nLord Granville was in London with Mr. Gladstone, bewailing the unhappy\r\nfate of those who have to wait for an Eastern Power to make up its mind.\r\nBut at last the Porte's decision to surrender Dulcigno was announced, and\r\nLord Granville wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR DILKE,\r\n\r\n    \"I accept your felicitations _d'avance_--the Turkish Note has got us\r\n    out of a great mess. My liver feels better already. I hope you will\r\n    improve the occasion by impressing upon all that it only requires firm\r\n    language from all, such as was used by them on Saturday, to make the\r\n    Turk yield.\r\n\r\n    \"I wonder whether they will be keen about Turkish finance. It is\r\n    rather in their line.\r\n\r\n    \"How are we to help our poor friends the Greeks?\"\r\n\r\nThe letter closed by a warning not to write by the post, \"unless to say\r\nsomething which it is desirable the French Government should know.\"\r\nCaution as to danger of gossip about his frequent meetings with Gambetta\r\nwas also urged. [Footnote: Sir Charles notes on 11th November: 'Having had\r\na telegram from Lord Granville to caution me, I told Gambetta that I did\r\nnot want my visits talked about because of the German newspapers. The\r\nresult of it was that the _Agence Havas_ stated that I had not seen\r\nGambetta, and this was copied by Blowitz next day, so that the _Times_\r\nrepeated the untrue statement!']\r\n\r\nActing on these suggestions, Sir Charles Dilke during the next four days\r\ndiscussed with the French Foreign Office and with Gambetta (who had\r\nwritten on September 28th to say, \"Je reviendrai exprès de Suisse pour\r\nvous vous en causer à fond\"), not only commercial negotiations, but also\r\nTurkish finance and the affairs of Greece. According to Lord Edmond\r\nFitzmaurice, the interests of Greece were at this time suffering because\r\nBarthélemy Saint-Hilaire was anxious to reconcile the Porte to those\r\ndesigns \"which France was executing at Tunis and contemplating at\r\nTripoli\"; [Footnote: _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., pp. 215, 436.] and in\r\nSir Charles's notes of these interviews there is repeated mention of\r\nGambetta's references to what Lord Salisbury had promised or suggested in\r\nregard to Tunis. Gambetta himself was strongly Philhellene, but said to\r\nhis friend on October 17th: \"Mr. Gladstone has spoilt our European affairs\r\nby putting Montenegro first.\" He held, and M. de Courcel agreed with him,\r\nthat the Concert was for the moment \"used up,\" and that Greece must wait\r\nuntil it could be reinvigorated. The conclusion which Sir Charles drew and\r\nconveyed to Lord Granville was that 'France waited on Germany, and Germany\r\non Austria, in regard to the Eastern Question, and consequently that,\r\nAustria being absolutely mistress of the situation, a confidential\r\nexchange of opinions at Vienna was essential.'\r\n\r\nThe demonstration at Dulcigno was carried out in December, but no further\r\nprogress was made then towards helping their \"poor friends the Greeks.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles's health was not at this time fully restored, but he was hard\r\nat work. Even when he went for a short rest to his villa near Toulon he\r\nwas obliged to take a cipher with him, and, having no secretary at hand,\r\nspent much of his time (most grudgingly) in ciphering and deciphering\r\ntelegrams.\r\n\r\n    'On October 25th Lord Granville wrote to me to Toulon, in cipher, to\r\n    the effect that Odo Russell thought that \"Bismarck was jealous of the\r\n    leading part in Europe which we were now taking.\"'\r\n\r\nLater, in November, the Prince of Wales, just returned from Berlin,\r\nconfirmed this. At the German Court Sir Charles was regarded as a \"most\r\ndangerous man\" and as \"a French spy.\" \"But,\" the Prince added, \"they say\r\nthe same of me.\" On November 22nd Lord Odo Russell is quoted as saying\r\n'that at the Court of Berlin I was considered a most dangerous man, but\r\nthat the Crown Princess fought my battles like a sound Liberal and a true\r\nBriton as she is.'\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year, addressing his constituents, Sir Charles\r\ndelivered a very effective general reply to Lord Salisbury's attacks on\r\nthe Government's European policy. It was a little hard to be blamed for\r\ndelay in settling difficulties which all sprang from Lord Salisbury's own\r\n\"harum-scarum hurry\" when he was Foreign Minister and Second\r\nPlenipotentiary of England. Lord Salisbury might say of the naval\r\ndemonstration that the Powers might as well have sent \"six washing-tubs\r\nwith flags attached to them.\" The fact was that only to the concerted\r\naction of the whole of the Powers had Turkey yielded.\r\n\r\n    \"The European Concert is the first real attempt in modern times to\r\n    arrive at such an understanding between the six Great Powers as might\r\n    gradually become a basis for partial disarmament, and for the adoption\r\n    of a policy which would cease to ruin nations in time of peace by\r\n    perpetual preparations for war. In arriving at the idea that when\r\n    territorial changes are to be made it is for Europe to arrange them, a\r\n    practical step has been taken in the direction of this policy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite excellent,\" wrote Lord Granville. \"I am delighted, and so, let us\r\nhope, is Salisbury.\" [Footnote: The complicated story of the negotiations\r\nrelating to the Montenegrin and Greek frontier questions will be found in\r\ndetail in the _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., chap, vi., and the _Life of\r\nLord Goschen_, vol. ii., chap. vii. The principal documents, with\r\nillustrative maps, are given in Sir Edward Hertslet's _Map of Europe by\r\nTreaty_, vol. iv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nHOME POLITICS--COMMERCIAL TREATY--PERSONAL MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe opening successes of British foreign policy under the Gladstone\r\nGovernment were to a large extent neutralized by other difficulties in\r\nwhich the new Administration found itself at once involved. Ireland\r\ncarried confusion into the very heart of Imperial authority, and discord\r\ninto the counsels of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn October 30th, 1880, Lord Tenterden wrote:\r\n\r\n    'Odo Russell says there is a general opinion abroad that the Gladstone\r\n    Government will be in a minority when Parliament meets, ... and that\r\n    then the policy of England will have to be changed. There will be no\r\n    more demonstrations, or concerts, or inconvenient proposals. I told\r\n    him that such ideas were illegitimate offspring of Musurus and the\r\n    _Morning Post_.'\r\n\r\nThese rumours of coming defeat sprang from the Irish situation. Captain\r\nBoycott's case had given a new word to the language; agrarian murders were\r\nfrequent; and the decision to seek no powers outside the ordinary law,\r\nwhich had been pressed on Mr. Forster, was vehemently challenged by the\r\nOpposition. Radicals wished for a Bill offering compensation to tenants\r\nevicted under harsh conditions; but this proposal bred dissension in a\r\nGovernment largely composed of great landlords, two of whom, Lords\r\nHartington and Lansdowne, possessed wide domains in Ireland. On June 13th,\r\n1880, Sir Charles, after dining with Lord Rosebery in company with Mr.\r\nGladstone, noted that there was disagreement in the Cabinet, 'all the\r\npeers being opposed to an Irish Land Bill, and all the Commoners\r\nsupporting Forster in this branch of his proposals.'\r\n\r\n    'On July 2nd trouble broke out in the Cabinet with a letter from Lord\r\n    Hartington advising the withdrawal of Forster's Irish Land Bill.\r\n    [Footnote: The Compensation for Disturbance measure.] ... I placed my\r\n    conditional resignation in Chamberlain's hands, and he his and mine in\r\n    Forster's, in case the latter was inclined to nail his colours to the\r\n    mast. I noted in my diary: \"I do not care in the least about the Bill,\r\n    but I must either go out with these men or climb into the Cabinet over\r\n    their bodies, to either become a Whig or to eventually suffer the same\r\n    fate, so I prefer to make common cause. I suppose there will be a\r\n    compromise once more;\" and so, at the Cabinet of the next day,\r\n    Saturday, the 3rd, there was.'\r\n\r\nThe compromise of July 3rd did not terminate dissension. Lord Lansdowne\r\nretired from the Government, and in the first days of August the\r\nCompensation for Disturbance Bill itself was rejected by the Lords, many\r\nof Mr. Gladstone's nominal supporters voting against it.\r\n\r\nThis was the first revolt of the Whigs. The old order was passing, and\r\nshrewd eyes perceived it. Lord Houghton wrote to Sir Charles from Vichy on\r\nAugust 8th:\r\n\r\n    \"I told Hugessen [Footnote: Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen had been created\r\n    Lord Brabourne in this summer.] that a peer always voted with his\r\n    party the first Session as a matter of etiquette; but it seems he does\r\n    not think so. The Government will have to decide in the vacation\r\n    whether they can govern without the Whigs or not. I am glad that I\r\n    have not to decide this point, but I own I am glad that I have lived\r\n    in a Whig world. It has been a wonderful combination of public order\r\n    and personal liberty. I do not care much for future order, but I care\r\n    a good deal for individual liberty, which is slipping away from under\r\n    us.\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment the House of Lords had given victory to the Whigs; but the\r\nsequel was, in Mr. Gladstone's own words, \"a rapid and vast extension of\r\nagrarian disturbance,\" which grew all through the winter of that famine-\r\nstricken year, presenting to the Chief Secretary the traditional Irish\r\nproblem, how to deal with a lawless demand for redress of grievances.\r\nTowards the end of September Mr. Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Next Session will settle Forster one way or the other. Either he will\r\n    pass a Land Bill and be a great statesman, or he will fail and be a\r\n    pricked bubble for the rest of his natural life.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Forster wanted to pass a Land Bill, but he also wanted to deal with\r\nlawlessness by coercive legislation, and, after the Cabinet hurriedly\r\ncalled on September 28th, Mr. Chamberlain reported:\r\n\r\n    '\"With regard to Ireland, Forster made a strong case for a Coercion\r\n    Bill, but the Cabinet thought it best that the insufficiency of the\r\n    present law should be thoroughly proved before new powers were asked\r\n    for.\"\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain went on:\r\n\r\n    '\"Probably a prosecution will be tried against Parnell and the Land\r\n    League for intimidating tenants and others. Even if it fails, it may\r\n    divert the attention of the Land League from its present agitation,\r\n    and so lead to a cessation of outrages.\"'\r\n\r\n    'I added in my diary: \"I hope they will not commit the folly of\r\n    prosecuting Parnell, which they discussed to-day. I sent for Hill, and\r\n    got the _Daily News_ to damn the idea.\" But my intervention through\r\n    the _Daily News_ was not on this occasion sufficiently strong\r\n    ultimately to prevent this folly, for I had not, this time, any\r\n    following at my back.'\r\n\r\nLater in the year he told Mr. Chamberlain that \"to try to stop Irish land\r\nagitation by making arrests was like firing a rifle at a swarm of midges.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain replied from Birmingham on October 27th;\r\n\r\n    \"I do not half like the Irish prosecutions, but I fear there is no\r\n    alternative, except, indeed, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus,\r\n    which I should like still less. Parnell is doing his best to make\r\n    Irish legislation unpopular with English Radicals. The workmen here do\r\n    not like to see the law set at defiance, and a dissolution on the\r\n    'Justice for Ireland' cry would under present circumstances be a\r\n    hazardous operation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Forster was eager to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, and wanted to have\r\nParliament specially summoned in order to carry through repressive\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday morning, November 15th, on my return to London, I saw\r\n    Harcourt, and told him that I should follow Chamberlain in resigning\r\n    if a special Irish Coercion Session without a Land Bill were to be\r\n    called. I saw Chamberlain immediately after the Cabinet which was held\r\n    this day. Bright and Chamberlain were as near splitting off at one end\r\n    as Lord Selborne at the other. Mr. Gladstone proposed at the Cabinet\r\n    the creation of English, Scotch, and Irish Grand Committees, but\r\n    obtained very little support....\r\n\r\n    'It seemed probable that there would be a Coercion Bill and a Land\r\n    Bill, and that the Land Bill (although the resignation of the Lord\r\n    Chancellor was threatened) would give what was known as \"the three\r\n    F's,\" and that the Government would insist on both Bills. [Footnote:\r\n    The \"three F's\" were \"Fair Rent\" (_i.e._, judicially fixed rent),\r\n    \"Free Sale\" (of tenant right), and \"Fixity of Tenure.\"] The Lords\r\n    would probably throw out the Land Bill, and the Government would\r\n    resign....\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain had dined with me on November 17th, and had given me late\r\n    news of the condition of the Cabinet, which had been adjourned until\r\n    Friday, the 19th.\r\n\r\n    'The division was really a division between the Commons' members on\r\n    the one side (except Forster and Hartington, but with the support of\r\n    Lord Granville), and Forster and Hartington and the Peers upon the\r\n    other side; Lord Cowper, the Viceroy of Ireland' (who, although not a\r\n    member of the Cabinet, had been called in for the occasion), 'making\r\n    common cause, of course, with Forster....\r\n\r\n    'On the 19th the adjourned Cabinet was held; Forster was isolated, and\r\n    all became calm. The Queen had telegraphed on the previous evening to\r\n    Lord Granville in a personal telegram, in which she said that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone had told her nothing about the dissensions in the Cabinet,\r\n    and that she \"must request Lord Granville either to tell her what\r\n    truth there is in the statement as to dissensions or to induce Mr.\r\n    Gladstone to do so!\" Mr. Gladstone always held that the Queen ought\r\n    not to be told about dissensions in the Cabinet; that Cabinets existed\r\n    for the purpose of differing--that is, for the purpose of enabling\r\n    Ministers who differed to thrash out their differences--and that the\r\n    Queen was only concerned with the results which were presented to her\r\n    by, or in the name of, the Cabinet as a whole. This seems reasonable,\r\n    and ought, I think, to be the constitutional view; but the Queen\r\n    naturally ... hates to have personal differences going on of which she\r\n    is not informed....\r\n\r\n    'On November 23rd I noted in my diary that Hartington ... had grown\r\n    restive, and wanted to resign and get Forster to go with him, and that\r\n    Forster talked of it but did not mean it. Kimberley and Northbrook had\r\n    come over to Mr. Gladstone's side, and the other view was chiefly\r\n    represented by Lord Spencer and Lord Selborne; and I could not help\r\n    feeling that if, as I expected, the split with Whiggery had to come,\r\n    it had better be this split, so that we should have the great names of\r\n    Gladstone and Bright upon our side. One could not help feeling that we\r\n    had no men to officer our ranks, and that really, besides Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, who was an old man, there was only Chamberlain....\r\n    Hartington was a real man, but a man on the wrong side, and with\r\n    little chance of his getting rid of his prejudices, which were those,\r\n    not of stupidity, but of ignorance; with his stables and his wealth it\r\n    was useless to expect him to do serious work. Bright was a great name,\r\n    and had a power of stringing together a series of sound commonplaces,\r\n    so put that they were as satisfactory to the ear as distinct\r\n    statements of policy would be; and had a lovely voice, but it was\r\n    rhetoric all the same--rhetoric very different from Disraeli's\r\n    rhetoric, but equally rhetoric, and not business.'\r\n\r\nBy November 25th the severity of the crisis may be gathered from a letter\r\nof Sir Charles's to Mrs. Pattison, which describes the grouping of forces.\r\nOn the one side were \"Gladstone, Bright, Chamberlain, Granville, Harcourt,\r\nKimberley, Childers, Dodson, Northbrook; on the other Hartington, Forster,\r\nSpencer, Argyll, the Chancellor.\" \"Forster,\" he wrote, \"talks about\r\nresigning, but does not mean it. It is _meaning_ it which gives us so much\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n'\"If Chamberlain and I should be driven to resign alone, we shall have a\r\ngreat deal of disagreeable unpopularity and still more disagreeable\r\npopularity to go through.\" His old kinsfolk who cared for him were \"hard-\r\nbitten Tories\": Mr. Dilke of Chichester; his cousin, John Snook, of\r\nBelmont Castle; and Mrs. Chatfield, if she were still able to follow\r\npolitical events, would \"badger him horribly.\" Worse still, he would have\r\nto endure \"patting on the back by Biggar,\" to which he would prefer stones\r\nfrom \"a Tory mob.\"\r\n\r\nThe lull in Cabinet troubles was only momentary:\r\n\r\n    'On December 10th, Chamberlain, the stormy petrel, came to stay. When\r\n    we were at dinner there suddenly arrived a summons for a Cabinet to be\r\n    held on Monday, instead of Thursday for which it stood, and we went\r\n    off to Harcourt's. We found that he was not in the secret, and\r\n    therefore decided that the Cabinet must have been called at the demand\r\n    of the Queen on the suggestion of Dizzy, who was staying with her at\r\n    this moment; \"but it may have been called on account of Forster's\r\n    renewed demand for coercion,\" as I noted.\r\n\r\n    'The next morning, December 11th, Lulu Harcourt came, and brought a\r\n    note: \"Dear Dilke, L. will tell you what he heard from Brett. It is\r\n    odd that the Sawbones should know what we are trying to find out.\"\r\n    Lulu reported that Dr. Andrew Clarke had told Reggie Brett,\r\n    Hartington's secretary, that Parliament was, after all, to meet before\r\n    Christmas. When Lulu was gone, Chamberlain and I decided that if there\r\n    was only a pretended and not a real change we would resign, whatever\r\n    our unpopularity. In the afternoon of the same day Harcourt wrote to\r\n    Chamberlain that he had seen Hartington; that Forster had written to\r\n    Gladstone that he could not wait till January 6th' (for extended\r\n    powers of coercion). 'Harcourt said that the reports were not much\r\n    worse, and only of a general kind; that Hartington thought Forster\r\n    worried and ill. \"In fact, I think he is like the Yankee General after\r\n    Bull Run--not just afraid, but dreadful demoralized. I have only one\r\n    counsel to give--let us all stick to the ship, keep her head to the\r\n    wind, and cram her through it. Yours ever, W. V. H.\"\r\n\r\n    '_Monday, December 13th._--... called before the Cabinet to find out\r\n    whether the offer of Chamberlain's place would now tempt me to sell\r\n    him! We won, after all!'\r\n\r\nMr. Forster had accordingly to wait till the New Year for the introduction\r\nof his Coercion Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA departmental change in the Foreign Office at this time greatly increased\r\nthe responsibilities of the Under-Secretary. Complaint had become frequent\r\nin the House of Commons of an apparently insufficient representation of\r\nthe Government in regard to commercial questions, which belonged partly to\r\nthe sphere of the Board of Trade and partly to that of the Foreign Office,\r\nwith unsatisfactory results. Lord Granville determined, on returning to\r\noffice, to make a new distribution of duties, and to take advantage of the\r\nUnder-Secretaryship being occupied by a Member of Parliament whose\r\ncompetence on commercial questions was universally recognized to place the\r\ncommercial business of the Office more completely under his control--as\r\nsupervising Under-Secretary. [Footnote: This arrangement continued in the\r\nUnder-Secretaryship of Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, Mr. James Bryce, Mr.\r\nRobert Bourke, and Sir James Fergusson, but was subsequently altered. See\r\nalso above, p. 314.]\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, May 2nd, Lord Granville asked me to take over general\r\n    supervision of the commercial department of the Foreign Office, and,\r\n    although I should have preferred to keep free of all departmental work\r\n    in order to attend to larger affairs of policy, I admitted that there\r\n    were strong reasons for my taking the Commercial Department, inasmuch\r\n    as the commercial members of the House of Commons were dissatisfied\r\n    with its management, and because also it was certain that I should\r\n    have to defend in the House of Commons treaty negotiations with\r\n    foreign Powers, which would in any case force me to give much time to\r\n    the consideration of commercial questions. When I first agreed to take\r\n    over the Commercial Department, it was only with the view of keeping\r\n    it for a short time, but I was unable to rid myself of it during the\r\n    whole time I was at the Foreign Office, and it gave me heavy work.'\r\n\r\nThe first and chief instalment of this burden consisted in the\r\nnegotiations for a new commercial treaty with France.\r\n\r\nIn January Dilke had learnt from Gambetta that M. Léon Say, late President\r\nof the Finance Committee of the Senate, would come to London as Ambassador\r\n'when the trouble about \"Article 7\" was ended.' [Footnote: See Chapter\r\nXX., p. 300.] It was in the month of May (when the \"trouble\" about M.\r\nFerry's attack on the religious Orders was by no means ended) that M. Say\r\narrived, charged with an important mission, specially suited to his\r\nqualifications as an ex-Minister of Finance. France was revising her\r\ncommercial policy; several commercial treaties, including that with Great\r\nBritain, had been only provisionally prolonged up to June 30th; and M. Say\r\nwas instructed to try to secure England's acceptance of the new general\r\ntariff, which had not yet passed the Senate. Gambetta and his friends\r\nstill held to the ideals of Free Trade. M. Tirard, the Minister of\r\nCommerce, supported the same view, but there was a strong Protectionist\r\ncampaign on foot.\r\n\r\nM. Say arrived on May 5th, and on the 6th had his first interview with Sir\r\nCharles:\r\n\r\n    'At this moment I was showing my disregard for the old Free-Trade\r\n    notions in which I had been brought up by my grandfather, and my\r\n    preference for reciprocitarian views, by carefully keeping back all\r\n    grievances with the countries with which we were negotiating upon\r\n    commercial matters, in order that they might be thrown in in the\r\n    course of the negotiations. On this ground I managed to cause the\r\n    Colonial Office to be directed to keep all Gibraltar grievances in\r\n    hand.\r\n\r\n    'Immediately on taking charge of the Commercial Department, I had sent\r\n    a memorandum on the wine duties to Mr. Gladstone, who replied, \"I have\r\n    never yet seen my way to reduction below a shilling or to a uniform\r\n    rate. _At present, we have not a sixpence to give away._ I do not like\r\n    bargaining away revenue for treaties, or buying over again from France\r\n    what has been bought already.... In my view the treaty of 1860 was\r\n    exceptional; it was to form an accommodation to the exigencies of the\r\n    French Emperor's position. _We_ never professed to be exchanging\r\n    concessions, but only allowed him to say _he_ had done it. I am, of\r\n    course, open to argument, but must say, as at present advised, that I\r\n    see but very little room for what is called negotiating a commercial\r\n    treaty.\"'\r\n\r\nThis was discouraging, since it came from the author of the treaty of\r\n1860, who by lowering the duties on light wines had brought into general\r\npopularity the \"Gladstone clarets\"; and Mr. Gladstone's expression of\r\nopinion, renewed in a second letter of May 11th, caused M. Say to 'let me\r\nclearly understand that as Mr. Gladstone was unwilling to lower the wine\r\nduties, he should resign his Embassy and try to become President of the\r\nSenate,' then vacant by the resignation of M. Martel. In this he\r\nsucceeded, much to the regret of Gambetta, who afterwards said to Dilke:\r\n\r\n    '\"People never know for what they are fit. There was Léon Say, the\r\n    best possible Ambassador at London, who insists on resigning the\r\n    Embassy in order to become a bad President of the Senate.\"'\r\n\r\nBut M. Léon Say, even in the act of resigning, advanced the possibility of\r\na treaty. While visiting Paris in May, to promote his candidature, he\r\n'attacked Mr. Gladstone so fiercely through the French Press for not\r\noffering to lower our wine duties that the Prime Minister, afraid to face\r\nour merchants, gave way.' In the supplementary Budget, proposed on June\r\n9th, provision was made for a reduction from one shilling to sixpence of\r\nthe duty on some wines. This new scale, however, was not to take effect\r\nunless compensating advantages were obtained from other countries.\r\n\r\nFrance, of course, was not the only country concerned; and the Portuguese\r\nMinister, M. Dantas, wrote to Sir Charles holding out great prospects of\r\nexpansion for British trade if Portuguese wines were let into the English\r\nmarket at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister first demurred, but finally agreed that the Portuguese\r\nmight be asked--\r\n\r\n    '\"whether, supposing fiscal conditions allowed us to give a great\r\n    advantage to their wines between 26 and 36 degrees of alcoholic\r\n    strength, they could engage for some considerable improvements in\r\n    their duties upon our manufactures, and what would be their general\r\n    character and effect?\r\n\r\n    '\"The Spaniards appear to have been much less unreasonable in their\r\n    demands. Please to consider whether the same question should be put to\r\n    them. Both probably should understand that _we have_ no money, and\r\n    should have to make it, so that their replies respectively would form\r\n    a serious factor in our deliberations.\"\r\n\r\n    'Here, at last, I had got all I wanted. I merely begged leave to put\r\n    the same questions at Rome and Vienna, and, obtaining his consent\r\n    (\"Pray do as you think best about Rome and Vienna.--W. E. G.\"), I went\r\n    on fast.'\r\n\r\nCipher telegrams were despatched on May 28th to Portugal, Spain, Italy,\r\nand Austria--countries which produce strong wines more abundantly than\r\nFrance--inquiring what corresponding advantages would be offered for a\r\nchange in the wine duties; and Sir Charles resumed his discussions with M.\r\nSay, who had returned to London.\r\n\r\nFor a time there seemed hope of a settlement, based on a new\r\nclassification of wines; but when the bases of agreement arrived at were\r\nseen in France, there was violent opposition to the proposed\r\ncountervailing 'amelioration,' which was construed to mean 'a lowering of\r\nduties upon the principal products of British industry.' Protectionist\r\nfeeling ran too high to accept this.\r\n\r\nWhile Lord Granville left commercial matters entirely to his junior\r\ncolleague, every detail of every proposal had to be thrashed out with the\r\nPrime Minister, who was his own Chancellor of the Exchequer. In such a\r\ncorrespondence there was much for a young Minister to learn; there was\r\nalso an opportunity for Mr. Gladstone to take the measure of a man whose\r\nappetite for detail was equal to his own.\r\n\r\nOne of the minor difficulties lay in the fact that the Portuguese and\r\nSpaniards wanted changes in the wine scale, but not the same as those\r\nwhich the French required. Owing to the accumulation of obstacles, Mr.\r\nGladstone, on going into Committee with his Budget, dropped the proposed\r\nalteration in the wine duties for that year. But in October Sir Charles\r\nwas sent to Paris in order to open the matter afresh, and on November 11th\r\nGambetta 'promised commercial negotiations in January in London, and an\r\nimmediate declaration in the Senate.' Beyond this nothing could be done in\r\n1880. The details of this first phase of these long-drawn-out transactions\r\nwill be found in a very full despatch written by Sir Charles on August\r\n6th, 1880 (and published subsequently in the Blue Book 'Commercial\r\nRelations with France, 1880-1882'), which placed on record the whole of\r\nthe dealings between himself and the two successive French Ambassadors.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, June 1st, Léon Say called on me to settle the words which\r\n    he should use before a Commission of the Senate in answer to a\r\n    question as to the new treaty. What I think he had really come about\r\n    was as to his successor. Challemel-Lacour, a friend of Gambetta, had\r\n    forced himself upon his Government; ... and Say came to tell me that\r\n    Gambetta did not really want Challemel to come, but wanted Noailles,\r\n    if an anticipated difficulty with the Queen could be got over.'\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was not got over, and so the appointment stood. The Memoir\r\ngives another version of the story, which Sir Charles heard in 1896, when\r\nhe was staying with his friends the Franquevilles at Madame de Sévigné's\r\nchâteau, Bourbilly.\r\n\r\n    'Franqueville said that Lord Granville had told him that when the\r\n    Queen refused Noailles, the French Government had not meant to send\r\n    him, but that he had been proposed only in order that Challemel-\r\n    Lacour should be accepted. Lord G. had said: \"The fact is that I told\r\n    them the Queen would not have Challemel. They said they must send him\r\n    or no one. Then said I, Propose Noailles.... She will refuse Noailles,\r\n    and, having done that, she will take Challemel! So it happened.\"'\r\n\r\n'Stories were at once set afloat that Challemel had shot a lot of monks,\r\nand various other inventions about him were started.' [Footnote: He had\r\nbeen in authority at Lyons during the war.] Matters went so far that the\r\nPrince of Wales wrote through his secretary suggesting that Sir Charles\r\nshould use his personal influence with Gambetta to have the appointment\r\ncancelled. Trouble broke out in Parliament, where one Irish member put on\r\nthe order paper a question specifying all the charges against the new\r\nAmbassador. The question having been (not without hesitation) allowed by\r\nthe Speaker, Sir Charles gave a full reply, completely exonerating the new\r\nAmbassador from all these accusations. This, however, did not satisfy Mr.\r\nO'Donnell, who proposed to discuss the matter on a motion for the\r\nadjournment of the House. The Speaker interposed, describing this as an\r\nabuse of privilege, and when Mr. O'Donnell proceeded, Mr. Gladstone took\r\nthe extreme course of moving that he be not heard. So began a most\r\ndisorderly discussion, which ended after several hours in Mr. O'Donnell's\r\ngiving notice of the questions which at a future date he proposed to put\r\non the matter, but which were never put.\r\n\r\nGambetta wrote to Dilke on June 18th:\r\n\r\n    \"Let me thank you from the bottom of my heart for the lofty manner in\r\n    which you picked up the glove thrown down by that mad Irish clerical.\r\n    In my double capacity of friend and Frenchman, I am happy to have seen\r\n    you at this work.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later the Prince of Wales's secretary wrote to say that the\r\nPrince had received M. Challemel-Lacour, and found him very agreeable. On\r\nthis Dilke comments:\r\n\r\n    'Challemel was delightful when he pleased; but he did not always\r\n    please, except very late at night.'\r\n\r\nIn November of this year Dilke met Rouher, the great Minister of the\r\nfallen Empire.\r\n\r\n    'He told me that he had quite dropped out of politics, and was\r\n    becoming a philosopher, and that Gambetta was the only man in France,\r\n    and could do anything he pleased with it.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's own opinion of contemporary France was conveyed to Lord\r\nGranville in one of several despatches, which have never been printed,\r\npartly because the Queen raised objection to his writing officially from a\r\ncapital at which there was an Ambassador. It gives his impressions of the\r\nstate of things under \"the Grévy régime,\" some years later exposed in\r\nconnection with the Wilson trial.\r\n\r\n    \"Paris, _October_ 17, 1880.\r\n\r\n    \"Your Lordship asked me to send you any general remarks that I might\r\n    have to offer upon the existing state of things in Paris, so that I\r\n    may perhaps be permitted to express the conviction which I feel that\r\n    at this moment there is an extraordinary contrast between the strength\r\n    and wealth of France and the incapacity of those who are responsible\r\n    for the administration of its Government. In addition, it is\r\n    impossible not to be struck with the atmosphere of jobbery which\r\n    surrounds the public offices. Transactions which in England would\r\n    destroy a Ministry, in Paris arouse at the most a whisper or a smile.\r\n    Something was heard in England of the terrible conversion of 'rentes'\r\n    scandal of last year, and there is reason to suppose that the\r\n    administration of Algeria by the persons who surround the brother of\r\n    the President of the Republic, its Governor-General (Albert Grévy),\r\n    constitutes a standing disgrace to France. The venality not only of\r\n    the Opposition, but also of the Ministerial Press, is admitted on all\r\n    sides, and the public offices are disorganised by the sudden dismissal\r\n    of well-trained public servants, who are replaced by the incompetent\r\n    favourites of those in power. The lightest suspicion of what is known\r\n    as clericalism, even when only a suspicion, based on anonymous and\r\n    calumnious denunciation, is sufficient to condemn a functionary. If it\r\n    be not trivial to give a simple example, I would quote one which will,\r\n    I think, remind your Lordship of the name of an old friend. Monsieur\r\n    Tresca, who was for more than thirty years the Assistant-Director of\r\n    the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, is a member of the Institute,\r\n    the most distinguished Civil Engineer in France, and not past work.\r\n    The Director having lately died, I expected to find that he had been\r\n    succeeded by Monsieur Tresca, but I discovered that this was not the\r\n    case. I took an opportunity while sitting next to the Prime Minister\r\n    at dinner at Her Majesty's Embassy to mention M. Tresca's name, in\r\n    order to see if I could discover the reason for his disgrace. 'Mais il\r\n    paraît qu'il est clérical,' was the phrase. Monsieur Tresca was a\r\n    moderate Orleanist who followed M. Thiers when the latter gave his\r\n    adhesion to the Republican form of government, and is certainly not a\r\n    man who could be properly described as clerical in his views.\r\n\r\n    \"Strange as it may seem, however, I am not inclined to see in the\r\n    existing and increasing degradation of French politics an actual\r\n    danger to the form of government which has been adopted in France. It\r\n    is, on the contrary, an undoubted fact that the Imperialist,\r\n    Legitimist, and Orleanist parties are continuing steadily to lose\r\n    ground. But if the Government is not only to last, but to succeed,\r\n    those who are responsible for its guidance will have at all hazards to\r\n    abandon their present policy of suspicion and exclusion, and to adopt\r\n    that of tolerance and comprehension, which, with magnificent effect\r\n    upon the power of France, was followed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801.\r\n    If they continue in their present course, the result must be fatal to\r\n    the reputation and to the influence of France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n    'I was rather given to interfering in the affairs of other offices,\r\n    which is not as a rule a wise thing to do; but then it must be\r\n    remembered that I was in the position of having to represent the\r\n    interests and opinions of the men below the gangway, and that they\r\n    used to come to Chamberlain and to me in order to put pressure upon\r\n    our colleagues through us, and that I was the person approached in all\r\n    Indian, Colonial, naval, and military questions, and Chamberlain in\r\n    domestic ones.'\r\n\r\nIn the last week of May, 1880,\r\n\r\n    'I engaged in a struggle with Lord Northbrook over the proceedings of\r\n    some of his ships.... The town of Batanga, on the west coast of\r\n    Africa, had been bombarded, sacked, and burnt for a very trifling\r\n    outrage; and I succeeded in inducing Lord Northbrook to telegraph for\r\n    further information. Ultimately the First Lord reported that--\"The\r\n    Commodore has only done what was forced upon him, but it is necessary\r\n    to look very sharply after our commercial and consular people in those\r\n    parts, who constantly want to use force.\"'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of July hostilities between Russia and China seemed\r\nprobable, and there was a rumour of a Russian defeat on the Kashgar\r\nfrontier. Serious apprehensions were entertained, especially in India, as\r\nto the effect on British trade:\r\n\r\n    'I went to W. H. Smith, and asked him to ask me whether we would\r\n    strengthen the China squadron in view of a possible Russian blockade\r\n    of the Treaty ports. I strongly recommended this increase of force,\r\n    but had been unable to get our people to agree to it; and through\r\n    Smith's question the thing was done....\r\n\r\n    'On May 31st I was asked to explain why I had taken the unusual course\r\n    for a member of the Government of walking out from a Government\r\n    division on the Secret Service money. I replied that I thought that\r\n    there was room for reduction in the sum, that I knew nothing about\r\n    what was spent in Ireland, but that what went abroad was chiefly spent\r\n    in America, \"in buying Fenians to write reports about other Fenians,\r\n    probably at the wish of the latter, who divide the spoils.\" There was\r\n    a Consul at Philadelphia who was perpetually writing to us with plans\r\n    of infernal machines, models of bombs, specimens of new kinds of\r\n    dynamite, and so forth, and we had to forward all his letters to the\r\n    Home Office, and always received from Harcourt the same reply--that we\r\n    were very probably being imposed on, but that the matter was so\r\n    important that whether we were imposed on or not we must buy; so that\r\n    naturally there was a good deal of waste.' [Footnote: In 1881 Sir\r\n    Charles again abstained from voting on this question.]\r\n\r\nAnother note shows how some Secret Service money was expended:\r\n\r\n    'On December 2nd Sir Henry Thring told me that a great number of the\r\n    Queen's telegrams had been sent to be pulped, and that the pulper had\r\n    taken them to America, whence they were recovered by a plentiful\r\n    expenditure of Secret Service money.'\r\n\r\nDilke maintained his practice of seeing Gambetta every time he passed\r\nthrough Paris to or from Toulon. But the British Embassy now gave him\r\nanother object in these visits, and he notes a pleasant story of the\r\nAmbassador:\r\n\r\n    'As I was passing through Paris on my way to Toulon for Christmas, I\r\n    started with Lord Lyons negotiations for the renewal of representation\r\n    by England to the Mexican Republic, [Footnote: The Mexican\r\n    negotiations were not at this time successful, but in 1883 Lord Edmond\r\n    Fitzmaurice, who followed Sir Charles at the Foreign Office, again\r\n    raised the matter, and ultimately a representative was appointed. See\r\n    _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., p. 304.] which I thought important for\r\n    commercial reasons, and which was ultimately brought about. I said to\r\n    Lord Lyons as we were walking together across the bridge from the\r\n    Place de la Concorde to the Chamber: \"If you bring about this renewal\r\n    of relations, you will have the popularity in the Service of making a\r\n    fresh place--for a Minister Plenipotentiary.\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"but if\r\n    I were to jump off this bridge I should be still more popular--as that\r\n    would make promotion _all the way down_.\"'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of December Sir Charles received an offer from the Greek\r\nGovernment of the Grand Cross of the Saviour, which he was obliged,\r\naccording to the English custom, to decline.\r\n\r\n    'But as I afterwards, when out of Parliament, declined the Turkish\r\n    Grand Cross of the Medjidieh, I became one of the few persons, I\r\n    should think, who ever had the chance of declining those two\r\ndecorations.'\r\n\r\nHis home anxieties in this year had been great. He tells very sadly of the\r\ndeath of the grandmother who had kept house for him from his childhood.\r\nShortly after \"her little old niece, Miss Folkard,\" who had always lived\r\nwith them, also passed away.\r\n\r\nHis uncle, Mr. Dilke of Chichester, and Mr. Chamberlain came often to stay\r\nwith him, but he was anxious as to the care and education of his little\r\nboy. Early in the new year Mr. Chamberlain proposed that Wentworth Dilke\r\nshould come and live with his own children. A year later the boy was\r\nsending messages to his father to say that 'he had made up his mind not to\r\nreturn to London, but proposed to reside permanently at Birmingham, and\r\nthought that I had better go to live there too.'\r\n\r\nIt was also for Sir Charles a year of change in one of the more intimate\r\nrelations of political life. Mr. George Murray, his secretary at the\r\nForeign Office, was taken 'by the Treasury, [Footnote: See mention of Mr.\r\nGeorge Murray, Chapter XX., p. 314.] and in his place was appointed Mr.\r\nHenry Austin Lee, formerly a scholar and exhibitioner of Pembroke College,\r\nOxford.' Also his private secretary, Mr. H. G. Kennedy, who had been with\r\nhim for many years, was now in ill-health, and had been much away for two\r\nyears. On July 27th, 1880, his place was taken by 'a volunteer from\r\nOxford,' Mr. J. E. C. Bodley, the future author of _France_--one of the\r\nfew Englishmen who has attained to the distinction of writing himself\r\n\"Membre de l'Institut.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCOERCION--CLOSURE--MAJUBA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November, 1880, Mr. Forster's \"resignation\" had only been staved off by\r\nthe Cabinet's promise to him of coercive powers in the new year, and it\r\nwas certain that such a Coercion Bill, when introduced, would be met by\r\nthe Irish members with obstruction outdoing all previous experience. The\r\nLand Bill, which was to accompany coercion, went far enough in limitation\r\nof the rights of property to be a grievous trial to the Whigs, and yet to\r\nRadicals such as Dilke and Chamberlain seemed complicated, inconclusive,\r\nand unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nBad as was the Irish trouble, South Africa was worse. Finding no attempt\r\nmade by Liberal statesmen to fulfil the expectations of free institutions\r\nwhich had been held out even by the Tory Government, the Boers rose for\r\nindependence in December, 1880. War followed--a half-hearted war\r\naccompanied by negotiations. All was in train for the day of Majuba.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's Memoir shows this ferment working. By January 6th, 1881, he\r\nwas back in London from his Christmas at Toulon.\r\n\r\n    'The Radicals were angry with the weakness of the Land Bill, which,\r\n    however, was Mr. Gladstone's own. Oddly enough, both Hartington and\r\n    Forster would have gone further, and Hartington certainly even for the\r\n    \"three F's,\" though he would have preferred to have had no Bill at\r\n    all; but then Hartington did not care about stepping in, and Gladstone\r\n    did, and feared the Lords. Chamberlain thought that the Land Bill was\r\n    sure to be vastly strengthened in passing through the House....\r\n\r\n    'I noted on January 7th that I was very restive under Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    Irish policy, but I found that if I were to go I should have to go\r\n    alone, for Chamberlain at this moment was not in a resigning humour.'\r\n\r\nA second element of discord lay in the preparations for the struggle on\r\nthe Coercion Bill.\r\n\r\n    'On January 8th Chamberlain gave me a minute by Hartington, which I\r\n    still have (dated the 3rd), proposing a summary method of dealing with\r\n    Irish obstruction. Hartington thought that the Speaker, \"by a stretch\r\n    of the rule against wilful obstruction, might, if assured of the\r\n    support of the great majority of the House, take upon himself the\r\n    responsibility of declaring that he would consider any member rising\r\n    to prolong the debate as guilty of wilful obstruction, and thus liable\r\n    to be silenced.\" If the Speaker exceeded his power, he would\r\n    (Hartington thought) only render himself liable to censure by the\r\n    House, and if previously assured of its support there was hardly any\r\n    limit to the authority which he might not assume. Chamberlain wrote\r\n    strongly to Hartington against this proposal. He was convinced that\r\n    with a stretch of authority the number of opponents would be\r\n    increased. He added: \"I believe the time has passed when Ireland can\r\n    be ruled by force. If justice also fails, the position is hopeless,\r\n    but this is a remedy which has never yet been tried fairly.\"\r\n    Hartington wrote in reply, on January 10th: \"If we cannot pass the\r\n    Coercion Bill without locking up fifty or sixty members, they must be\r\n    locked up.\" Hartington's view was accepted by the Speaker, and led to\r\n    the wholesale expulsion from the body of the House of the Irish\r\n    members....\r\n\r\n    'On January 12th I somewhat unwillingly made up my mind that I must\r\n    remain in the Government, as Chamberlain insisted on remaining. I\r\n    feared that if I came out by myself I should be represented as\r\n    encouraging disorder, and to some extent should encourage it, and\r\n    should be driven to act with mere fanatics. In coming out with\r\n    Chamberlain I always felt safe that we could carry a large section of\r\n    the party with us. Coming out by myself, I feared that that was not\r\n    so. Chamberlain's position at this moment was that he personally did\r\n    not believe in coercion, but that the feeling in the country was such\r\n    that any Government would be forced to propose it, and he was not\r\n    sufficiently clear that it was certain to fail to be bound as an\r\n    honest man to necessarily oppose it. I received on this day a letter\r\n    from a constituent upon the point, and answered that, agreeing\r\n    generally as regarded pending Irish questions with Bright and\r\n    Chamberlain, I should follow them if they remained united. [Footnote:\r\n    The phrase 'pending Irish questions' is important. It excluded Home\r\n    Rule.] Should they at any point differ from Mr. Gladstone, or the one\r\n    with the other, as to the course to be adopted, I should have to\r\n    reconsider my position.\r\n\r\n    'On January 14th I had a full talk with Bright, trying to get him to\r\n    go with me. Bright told me that the outrages had got much worse in\r\n    Ireland since the middle of December, as for example that of firing\r\n    into houses. He had come round a great deal in the coercion direction.\r\n    He now distinctly favoured suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act--that\r\n    is to say, did not unwillingly yield to it, like Chamberlain, but\r\n    supported it almost willingly, and he evidently had been converted by\r\n    Forster to the view that things had grown to be very bad, and that by\r\n    locking up a small number of the chiefs the rule of law might be\r\n    restored. I did not agree, but his opinion showed me how completely I\r\n    was isolated. I seemed trying to put people a point beyond themselves\r\n    before they were naturally ready to go, and risked only being followed\r\n    by those who are always ready to run on any fresh scent and whose\r\n    support is but a hindrance. I felt myself face to face with the\r\n    necessity for self-sacrifice of the hardest kind, the sacrifice of my\r\n    own judgment as to the right course in the attempt to work with\r\n    others. It was clear that few men thought at this time that coercion\r\n    was so inexpedient that a single member of the Government would be\r\n    justified in venturing on a course which would weaken the hands of\r\n    Government itself, increase Mr. Gladstone's difficulties, and retard\r\n    or hamper the remedial legislation which I myself thought most\r\n    desirable. Moreover, we had weakened the Irish executive in past years\r\n    by continually teaching them to rely on unconstitutional expedients,\r\n    and it seemed very difficult to choose a moment of great outrage to\r\n    refuse them the support which we had long accustomed them to look for\r\n    in every similar stress of circumstances.\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet of January 22nd dealt with the allied questions of\r\n    closure, coercion, and remedial legislation for Ireland. It was\r\n    decided to produce a scheme of closure as soon as it was certain that\r\n    Northcote was in favour of the principle, and it was left to Mr.\r\n    Gladstone to make sure of this, and I noted in my diary, \"He had\r\n    better make _very_ sure.\" I was right in my doubt, and this question\r\n    of Parliamentary procedure led to such a breach between Mr. Gladstone\r\n    and his former private secretary that the Prime Minister told me he\r\n    should never in future believe a word that Northcote might say. The\r\n    apparent tortuousness of Northcote's conduct was caused by the\r\n    weakness of his position as leader of the Opposition in the House of\r\n    Commons. He was in favour of moderate courses, and always began by\r\n    agreeing with us in private, after which Randolph Churchill would send\r\n    a man to him with the message: \"Go and tell the old goat that I won't\r\n    have it.\" And then the unfortunate Northcote, to avoid being denounced\r\n    in public, had to turn round and say that he could not answer for his\r\n    party.'\r\n\r\nChronicling another talk with Gladstone, in which the latter spoke of\r\nNorthcote's \"shiftiness,\" Sir Charles says:\r\n\r\n    'I had a high opinion of Sir Stafford, but in face of Churchill he was\r\n    not a free agent....\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet rejected Chamberlain's proposal to accompany coercion by\r\n    a provision against ejectments in the sense of the Compensation Bill\r\n    of 1880. In my diary I add: \"By a majority they decided that there\r\n    should be no declaration of the nature of the Land Bill as yet; but,\r\n    as Gladstone was in the minority on this point, we shall probably not\r\n    wait long for the declaration. The Land Bill was finally settled. It\r\n    really gives the 'three F's,' applied by a Court, but so wrapped up\r\n    that nobody will find them.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Forster's Coercion Bill was introduced as the first business of the\r\nSession, and was met by obstruction which more than realized the forecast.\r\nFrom Monday, January 31st, through the whole of Tuesday, February 1st, the\r\ndebate was prolonged in a House possessing no recognized authority to\r\ncheck it; and at nine on the Wednesday morning Speaker Brand adopted the\r\ncourse which had been advocated by Lord Hartington. Acting in the exercise\r\nof his own discretion, he ordered the question to be put. The Irish\r\nmembers, having refused to submit, were removed one by one, technically by\r\nforce. In face of these circumstances the Cabinet met on the Wednesday\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet decided not to have general closure in the form in which\r\n    Chamberlain had asked for it in my name as well as in his. Gladstone\r\n    wanted to have a special closure for Irish coercion, but Chamberlain\r\n    presented our ultimatum against that, and won. When Chamberlain and I\r\n    talked over the whole situation, I told him that I thought we had been\r\n    too popular up to now for it to last. We were now unpopular with our\r\n    own people in the constituencies on account of coercion, but, holding\r\n    their opinions, were not really trusted by the moderates. I thought\r\n    this position inevitable. The holding of strongly patriotic and\r\n    national opinions in foreign affairs combined with extreme Radical\r\n    opinions upon internal matters made it difficult to act with anybody\r\n    for long without being attacked by some section with which it was\r\n    necessary to act at other times, and made it difficult to form a solid\r\n    party.'\r\n\r\nWhen Dilke and Chamberlain, neither of whom was averse from the idea of\r\nclosure in itself, resisted a proposal which meant treating the Irish\r\nmembers in a category apart from the rest of the House of Commons, they\r\ntook a course which now seems simple and inevitable. But there is some\r\ndifficulty in realizing to-day how Irishmen, and more especially Irish\r\nmembers, were viewed in England through the early eighties. Something of\r\nthe public feeling towards them may be gathered from a string of extracts\r\ndealing with another source of dissension in this Cabinet. Sir William\r\nHarcourt, as Home Secretary, had adopted determined views of what may be\r\nconceded to the exigencies or the demands of detectives. Sir Charles\r\nwrites on February 5th:\r\n\r\n    'It was at this moment that I first had to do with dynamite. Lord\r\n    Granville had instructed me to deal with such matters at once myself\r\n    without their passing through the Office; and receiving despatches\r\n    from Washington (containing despatches from our Consul at Philadelphia\r\n    offering information as to plots), and having missed Harcourt, I took\r\n    them to Mr. Gladstone. I said that I had no doubt a sharp Yankee was\r\n    trying to get a couple of hundred pounds out of us.'\r\n\r\nBut Sir William Harcourt wished for the information, and Sir Charles adds:\r\n\r\n    'The result of this policy undoubtedly was the fabrication of plots,\r\n    as exposed by Michael Davitt in the _Labour World_ in 1890.'\r\n\r\nLater Harcourt modified his view, but 'this was like shutting the stable\r\ndoor when the steed was stolen.'\r\n\r\n    'On February 16th I noted in my diary my dissatisfaction with regard\r\n    to the Secret Service money. In 1880 I had walked out instead of\r\n    voting for it, and I proposed this year to follow the same course. I\r\n    knew of nothing on which was spent the £15,000, except one sum of £40\r\n    for a service not secret at all in its nature, \"and £200 spent in\r\n    America on a ... panic of Harcourt's.\" I believe that as a fact most\r\n    of the money was spent in the United States, but as I was not trusted\r\n    with the information, I again walked out.'\r\n\r\nOn February 12th 'there was a great row between Fawcett and Harcourt.'\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt and Fawcett had been opening the letters of the Irish\r\n    members, and when the Irishmen found it out Fawcett wanted to admit\r\n    it, and Harcourt insisted on a blank refusal of information. My\r\n    brother came to me with this question from the Radicals: \"What is the\r\n    use of having a blind Postmaster-General if he reads our letters?\"'\r\n\r\nThe matter came up in the Cabinet along with a discussion on the Arms Act,\r\nwhich prohibited the possession of firearms in Ireland without licence\r\nfrom a Magistrate, and authorized the police to search. This Act had been\r\nin force before, but had been dropped by the Government on coming into\r\noffice, and was now proposed as a supplement to Mr. Forster's \"Protection\r\nof Property\" measure.\r\n\r\n    'On February 12th Mr. Gladstone, with Bright and Chamberlain, fought\r\n    hard against the Arms Bill. Harcourt, however, said that \"coercion was\r\n    like caviare: unpleasant at first to the palate, it becomes agreeable\r\n    with use\"; and, led by Harcourt, the majority insisted on having more\r\n    coercion, and it was settled that the second Bill should go on. At\r\n    dinner at Lord and Lady Cork's in the evening I was astonished to see\r\n    in what excellent spirits Mr. Gladstone was, although he had been\r\n    entirely overruled in his own Cabinet in the afternoon.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Home Secretary's activity was making trouble for the Foreign\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n    'It having been stated in the House of Commons by Parnell that he had\r\n    been watched and followed in Paris by persons connected with the\r\n    Embassy, Lord Lyons telegraphed to me to ask me to contradict the\r\n    statement. On February 19th he telegraphed again: \"No one known to or\r\n    in communication with the Embassy followed Parnell or watched him in\r\n    any way in Paris, and nobody reported to the Embassy about him.\" I\r\n    wrote to Harcourt and told him that Lord Lyons wished a contradiction\r\n    made, and that Lord Granville wished me to make the contradiction \"if\r\n    Harcourt sees no objection.\" I afterwards wrote to Harcourt, \"From\r\n    what you said, I imagine that you do see objection; but if we can, it\r\n    is better to keep the Embassies out of police matters.\" Harcourt,\r\n    however, would not allow a contradiction to be given; and the fact was\r\n    that Parnell had been watched, but watched by the Home Office, through\r\n    the police, without the knowledge of the Embassy. Through this\r\n    watching of the Irish leaders, Parnell's relations with Mrs. O'Shea\r\n    were known to some of those who afterwards professed to be amazed by\r\n    the discovery.'\r\n\r\nAnother subject produced open symptoms of a \"split.\" On January 21st,\r\n1881, during the debate on the Address, Mr. Rylands proposed a resolution\r\ncondemning the annexation of the Transvaal as impolitic and unjustifiable,\r\nwhich was tantamount to declaring that the Boers had been justified in\r\ntheir revolt.\r\n\r\n    'After my dinner party on the 21st, I went down to the House of\r\n    Commons and deliberately walked out on the Transvaal division, as did\r\n    three other members of the Government--Bright, Chamberlain, and\r\n    Courtney. We had all along been opposed to the annexation.'\r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning. In South Africa difficulties accumulated for\r\nthe British Government. General Colley was repulsed at Laing's Nek on\r\nJanuary 28th, and on February 8th at the Ingogo River. But in this war\r\nthere was a real anxiety on both sides to negotiate, and President Kruger\r\ndespatched an offer to submit the whole dispute to an English Royal\r\nCommission if troops were withdrawn from the Transvaal. On Wednesday,\r\nFebruary 16th, Sir Charles learnt from Mr. Chamberlain that there had been\r\na special Cabinet that afternoon 'to consider proposals from President\r\nKruger of the Transvaal, which Mr. Gladstone was most anxious to accept.'\r\n\r\nOn the 18th 'the Transvaal question came up again on a Dutch petition\r\nbrought over by delegates, as to which Lord Granville wrote to me: \"I\r\nsuppose it would not be right for you or me to see them. We shall probably\r\nbear with fortitude the sacrifice.\"' But the Government were trying to\r\nmeet Kruger's advances in a reasonable spirit, and they instructed Colley\r\nby telegram to suspend hostilities if the Boers abandoned armed\r\nopposition. Colley telegraphed back for more precise instructions. The\r\nBoers hold Laing's Nek, which was in Natal territory. Was he to insist on\r\ntheir evacuating it--and thus opening the pass into the Transvaal--before\r\nhe suspended hostilities? The answer sent back on February 19th was that\r\nhe should forward to the Boers the British proposal, and fix a reasonable\r\ntime within which they must reply. During that time he was not to attempt\r\nto occupy Laing's Nek. Sir Charles's Memoir makes it plain that the\r\ndecision to negotiate with the Boers was due to Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\nChamberlain:\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet of Saturday, February 19th, Mr. Gladstone and\r\n    Chamberlain, for a wonder, were in the majority, and it was decided to\r\n    drop the Arms Bill and to negotiate with the Boers; but at a further\r\n    Cabinet on the 26th, Mr. Gladstone being in bed... the decision of the\r\n    previous week was reversed, and it was decided to go forward with the\r\n    Arms Bill.'\r\n\r\nNo reply came from the Boers within the time appointed, and on the night\r\nof February 26th Colley seized the height of Majuba, which commanded\r\nLaing's Nek. By noon on the 27th he was a dead man, and his force\r\ndefeated. The stated time had expired, and Colley did his duty as a\r\nsoldier. [Footnote: See an article in the _Nineteenth Century_ (March,\r\n1904) by Lady Pomeroy Colley (Lady Allendale) in reply to some points in\r\nthe account of these events in the _Life of Gladstone_, iii., pp. 36-38.]\r\nBut it is none the less true that the Boers, even after the action, still\r\nbelieved themselves to be in negotiation. On the 28th Kruger, ignorant of\r\nwhat had befallen, was writing a grateful acknowledgment of the proposal\r\nto suspend hostilities, and was suggesting a meeting of representatives\r\nfrom both sides.\r\n\r\nIt was urged, of course, that a disgrace to the British Army must be wiped\r\nout before there could be any further talk of parleying. Yet in Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government there had been from the first an element which\r\nplainly thought the war unjustified, and with that element Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad some sympathy. The Radicals now asserted themselves.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, March 2nd, after a long interview between me and\r\n    Chamberlain on the state of affairs, Chamberlain had an hour and a\r\n    half with Bright, and got him to write a strong letter to Gladstone\r\n    about the Transvaal, which we put forward as the ground for a proposed\r\n    resignation, although of course the strength of the Coercion measures,\r\n    the weakness of the Land measures, and the predominance of the Whigs\r\n    in the Cabinet were the reasons which weighed chiefly with Chamberlain\r\n    and myself. In the Transvaal matter, however, we should not be two,\r\n    but four, for Bright and Courtney must go out with us, and Lefevre\r\n    might do so. On the other hand, we had reason to think that if the\r\n    Whigs yielded to us on the Transvaal, Kimberley would go. On the next\r\n    day, Thursday the 3rd, Bright was sent for by Mr. Gladstone on his\r\n    letter. Bright found him in entire harmony with our views. Kimberley\r\n    at once gave in, and telegraphed what he was told; so the difficulty\r\n    was over before the Cabinet was able to meet, and we as far from\r\n    resignation as ever.\r\n\r\n    'On March 5th, I noted in my diary that the Land Bill was\r\n    unsatisfactory. Chamberlain told me of a scene between Bright and\r\n    Dodson which amused me much. Says Bright to Dodson: \"You were put into\r\n    the Cabinet to vote with Gladstone. Surely you ought not to oppose\r\n    him.\" Says Dodson indignantly, \"A man may have an opinion.\" \"But why\r\n    express it?\" said the old Quaker.'\r\n\r\nIn the middle of March\r\n\r\n    'Things looked bad again at this moment, for on the 14th I wrote a\r\n    draft address to the electors of Chelsea, prepared in view of my\r\n    resignation along with Bright and Chamberlain. I alluded in it to \"the\r\n    non-reversal in the Transvaal of an act of high-handed aggression,\r\n    which at the time of its inception I had condemned by vote and\r\n    speech,\" and also condemned the resort to coercive measures for\r\n    Ireland.'\r\n\r\nSo far as the Transvaal was concerned, the sympathies of Chamberlain and\r\nDilke with the Boers prevailed; negotiations proceeded, and a Commission\r\nwas named, which finally recommended a reversal of the annexation. The\r\nselection of Chamberlain--whose department had no connection with South\r\nAfrica--to justify this step in debate indicated how strong was his\r\nopinion in favour of the Boers. But the Duke of Argyll, who was leaving\r\nthe Government from disapproval of their Irish Land Bill, nevertheless on\r\nthis matter defended the action of his former colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe situation was summed up by an observation of the Queen's to Lord\r\nSpencer, which, says Sir Charles, amused the Cabinet on March 26th. The\r\nQueen's Speech on January 7th had contained this curt phrase: \"A rising in\r\nthe Transvaal has imposed upon me the duty of taking military measures\r\nwith a view to the prompt vindication of my authority.\" To this the Queen\r\nreplied: \"I cannot see how my 'authority' has been 'vindicated' in the\r\nTransvaal.\" \"There was nothing else to be done, Ma'am,\" says Spencer. \"I\r\nquite understand that,\" says Her Majesty, \"but still I do not see how my\r\n'authority' has been 'vindicated.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was meanwhile doing the right thing in Ireland with his Land\r\nBill, but Mr. Forster, Sir Charles thought, was destroying the effect by\r\nthe free use of his new measure, which, having become law by the end of\r\nFebruary, enabled the Irish Government to put any man into gaol on a mere\r\nsuspicion and without form of trial. Members of Parliament were not at\r\nfirst attacked, but the officials of the Land League were seized. Mr.\r\nDavitt had been general manager; his ticket-of-leave, as an ex-Fenian\r\nprisoner, was recalled by Sir William Harcourt, and he was re-arrested.\r\nMr. Dillon took Davitt's place. Sir Charles writes on Saturday, April\r\n30th, 1881:\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet, which I think was on the previous night, but of which\r\n    I heard the details on this day, it was decided to arrest Dillon.\r\n    Spencer and Granville, who were both of them away, for it was not, I\r\n    think, a regular Cabinet, were both against it rather than for it;\r\n    Harcourt was really neutral, though Gladstone counted him for it;\r\n    Kimberley, Hartington, and the Chancellor alone supported Gladstone\r\n    and Forster. Bright, Chamberlain, Childers, and, wonderful to relate,\r\n    Carlingford (who was present, though the newspapers said he was\r\n    absent), Northbrook, and Dodson opposed the arrest. Gladstone declared\r\n    that it was six to six, and gave himself a casting vote. A few days\r\n    later Lord Granville spoke to me warmly against the decision of the\r\n    Cabinet. He said he never knew numbers counted in the Cabinet before,\r\n    and that it was absurd to count heads in assemblies in which there was\r\n    such a difference in the contents of the heads. This criticism,\r\n    however, goes too far, and strikes at the root of the decisions of\r\n    Parliament itself.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Land Bill had reached its second reading. But the Irish\r\nexecutive was constantly appealed to for constabulary to assist in\r\ncarrying out sentences of eviction, while, on the other hand, tenants were\r\nfighting landlords by a general strike against rents.\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet on May 4th the chief topic discussed was the\r\n    possibility of checking evictions in Ireland without preventing the\r\n    payment of rent by tenants perfectly able to pay.'\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Irish trouble in Ireland, there was the Irish trouble\r\nin the House of Commons, in no way settled by the Speaker's one arbitrary\r\nimposition of closure at his own discretion. That Mr. Gladstone's mind was\r\nworking towards another solution is evident from the following note:\r\n\r\n    'On June 8th I went to The Durdans to lunch with the Roseberys, and\r\n    walked with Mr. Gladstone. We marched round the Derby course, and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone said that the first business after the Irish Land Bill must\r\n    be procedure, and that this must be the business of next year. He\r\n    said, \"there must no doubt be some repression by the closure, but\r\n    there must also be still more delegation.\"'\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the Land Bill was long almost beyond precedent, but by\r\nAugust it left the Commons, and Lord Salisbury, though furious in his\r\ninvective, declined to advise its total rejection. The Irish landlords had\r\ntheir will of it in Committee, and sent it back unrecognizable. The Lords'\r\namendments were then reviewed by Mr. Gladstone, and, broadly speaking,\r\nrejected. There was the usual threat of a collision between the Houses.\r\nSir Charles's first note, in his diary of August 12th, indicates how\r\ncompletely Mr. Gladstone controlled this situation:\r\n\r\n    '\"Harcourt is very violent against the Lords, more so than either\r\n    Bright or Chamberlain, but the decision, whatever it may be, of the\r\n    Cabinet, will on this occasion be Mr. Gladstone's.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the 14th I noted, \"The claim of Lord Salisbury to force us to\r\n    'consult the country' is a claim for annual Parliaments when we are in\r\n    office, and septennial Parliaments when they are in office.\" I did\r\n    not, however, believe in this particular crisis. On the 14th Lord\r\n    Houghton wrote complaining that we did not meet so often as we used to\r\n    do. \"This is a penalty one pays for having one's friends in power. I\r\n    fear there is no hope of their ceasing to be so by the instrumentality\r\n    of the House of Lords.\" On the 15th Lady Lytton's sister told me that\r\n    Lytton had \"enjoyed the fighting attitude of the Lords. It seemed more\r\n    worthy than talking so much and doing so little.\" But she added:\r\n    \"After it was all over they were in a most horrid fright.\"'\r\n\r\nLord Ripon wrote from India of the proceedings in the House of Lords that\r\nhe thought Lord Salisbury \"would succeed in blowing the institution to\r\npieces before long.\"\r\n\r\nWith a Cabinet so divided, rumour of changes was certain to be rife.\r\n\r\n    'On August 17th there occurred the Ministerial fish dinner at\r\n    Greenwich, which was then a yearly institution. Rosebery was in the\r\n    chair--for on these occasions the Chairman is arbitrarily chosen,\r\n    generally from among the very youngest members of the Government, and\r\n    is a sort of lord of misrule. [Footnote: Lord Rosebery was Under-\r\n    Secretary at the Home Office.]\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt told Chamberlain at the dinner that Mr. Gladstone had made\r\n    up his mind to put Lord Frederick Cavendish into the Cabinet, as\r\n    Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain arguing that he ought not to\r\n    be put in over my head.\r\n\r\n    'On the way home Harcourt told me that there were other changes to be\r\n    made besides putting in Cavendish, and that one of them was that he\r\n    should become Lord Chancellor.... I did not myself believe any of\r\n    these reports, but confined myself to urging that Chamberlain should\r\n    be Chancellor of the Exchequer.'\r\n\r\nThis assumed continuance in office, but a little later Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nwriting to Sir Charles, entered the domain of prophecy, with some hint of\r\nthe 'unauthorized programme.' He thought that the Liberals would be beaten\r\nat the next election, and that their business was to try to get the\r\nfarmers over to their side.\r\n\r\n    \"What is the good of bothering about Bankruptcy or Local Government\r\n    when our real business is to outbid Chaplin and Co. with the farmers?\r\n    But, then, what will our Whig friends say to Radical proposals as to\r\n    tenant right, improvements, rating, etc.?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Charles was in Paris Mr. Chamberlain wrote on October 4th:\r\n\r\n    \"I am very uneasy about the Irish business. It does not look as if the\r\n    Land Bill would do much, and meanwhile 'outrages,' exaggerated\r\n    probably by the Press, are forming a large part of the information\r\n    supplied by the papers for the autumn season. It is the history of\r\n    last October over again, and I expect every day to hear of some\r\n    proposal for further coercion. I am clear that we were right in\r\n    resisting coercion last year, and I even wish we had gone further and\r\n    gone out upon it. But what is to be done now? Can we go on drifting\r\n    without a policy? We cannot go back. It is too late to release the\r\n    'suspects,' and, if we were to do so, the experience of the past few\r\n    weeks shows that this would not make things smoother with Parnell and\r\n    Co., while it would bring down a storm of denunciation from the other\r\n    side. Then, can we go further in the direction of coercion? I doubt if\r\n    the House of Commons would stand it. To put down the Land League would\r\n    involve so many questions affecting public agitation in this country\r\n    that the Radicals would surely be up in arms. It is possible the\r\n    Tories might do it if they were in office, which I wish to God they\r\n    were. But can the Liberals do it, and, above all, can you and I be\r\n    parties to any more of such work? I should not have a moment's\r\n    hesitation in saying 'No,' if I could find any alternative, but it is\r\n    evident that Parnell has now got beyond us. He asks for 'No Rent,' and\r\n    Separation, and I am not prepared to say that the refusal of such\r\n    terms as these constitutes an Irish grievance. I should like to stand\r\n    aside and let the Coercionists and Parnell fight it out together, but\r\n    I fear this is not now possible. Altogether it is a horrible\r\n    imbroglio, and for the moment I do not see my way out of the fog. I\r\n    wish I could talk it all over with you.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, however, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"'The resources of civilization'--see Mr. G.'s speech--will mean\r\n    immediate and greatly extended use of the Protection Act. There will\r\n    be a miraculous draught of fishes directly. In for a penny, in for a\r\n    pound. I hope it will be a clean sweep. The electors will better stand\r\n    a crushing blow than coercion by driblets. There is no other\r\n    alternative except new legislation--and from that may Heaven defend\r\n    us.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 12th, 1881, Mr. Parnell was arrested and put into gaol. On\r\nOctober 17th, Sir Charles, then in the South of France, wrote to Sir M.\r\nGrant Duff--who had become Governor of Madras--that \"Bright and\r\nChamberlain supported the proposed general _razzia_ on the Land League\r\nleaders in order to avoid fresh coercive legislation.\" Fresh legislation\r\nwould have meant trouble in the House of Commons. But the arrest of Mr.\r\nParnell, which \"folly\" Sir Charles had tried to prevent, led to greater\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe British Government now endeavoured to back up the policy of force by\r\ndividing the opposition. Ever since the trouble generated by the rejection\r\nof the Compensation for Disturbance Bill, Dublin Castle had been (not for\r\nthe first time) seeking to enlist on its side the spiritual power of Rome.\r\nThere were two lines of approach, of which the first is indicated in a\r\nnote under November 22nd, 1880:\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville was engaged at this moment in trying, through Cardinal\r\n    Newman, to induce the Pope to bully the Irish Bishops; but the Irish\r\n    Bishops told the Pope, in reply to his remonstrances, that if he\r\n    adopted a policy of compromise in Italy which was unpopular with the\r\n    Church, he must leave them alone with Irish affairs.'\r\n\r\nThe \"policy of compromise\" was not likely to be adopted. Cardinal Manning,\r\ntalking to Sir Charles on July 15th, 1880, on his return from Rome,\r\nexpressed his belief that the Vatican was badly advised in its hostile\r\nattitude towards the Italian Monarchy, which he personally would be\r\nprepared to support against the Revolutionary Party, since its fall would\r\nprobably bring about an anti-clerical republic.\r\n\r\nFar more continuous were the negotiations, with a view to influencing the\r\nIrish Church, carried on through Mr. George Errington, a gentleman of old\r\nRoman Catholic family, who had sat since 1874 as a moderate Home Rule\r\nmember for County Longford. [Footnote: The historic difficulties in the\r\nway of an Embassy to the Vatican, fully given by Lord Fitzmaurice in the\r\n_Life of Lord Granville_, vol. ii., chap, viii., pp. 281-282, had been\r\nsurmounted \"by the practice of allowing a Secretary of Legation, nominally\r\nappointed to the Grand Ducal court of Tuscany, to reside at Rome, where he\r\nwas regarded as _de facto_ Minister to the Vatican.\" Lord Derby had,\r\nhowever, withdrawn Mr. Jervoise, the last representative, and no other\r\nappointment had been made.]\r\n\r\nThe following notes show the points at which Sir Charles came into touch\r\nwith the development of Mr. Errington's 'Mission' to the Vatican. On\r\nDecember 1st, 1880, Mr. Errington wrote--in pursuance of a conversation of\r\nthe previous day--to solicit Sir Charles's offices with the French\r\nGovernment towards mitigating the severity with which expropriation of the\r\nunauthorized congregations might be carried out under M. Ferry's Article\r\n7. The letter dealt also with the matter on which his 'Mission' was\r\nafterwards based:\r\n\r\n    \"I am constantly receiving news from Ireland of the evil effects\r\n    already produced by the temporary success at Rome of Archbishop\r\n    Croke\"--who represented advanced Nationalism--\"and his party. This\r\n    would have been quite impossible had any diplomatic relations existed.\r\n    Cardinal Jacobini will take care, I am sure, that such a thing does\r\n    not occur again. Whether he can undo or counteract the mischief\r\n    already done is, I am afraid, doubtful....\r\n\r\n    \"I suppose it would be desirable in the interests of government and\r\n    order in Ireland that the Vatican should do all in its power to keep\r\n    the clergy from going with or countenancing the Land League.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 6th, 1880:\r\n\r\n    'Errington came to me in Paris, nominally on behalf of the Vatican,\r\n    with a view of having negotiations entered upon, and I believe this\r\n    was the time at which he obtained, at Lord Spencer's request, some\r\n    sort of private commission from Lord Granville. The commission was\r\n    afterwards made more definite.'\r\n\r\nOctober 28th, 1881:\r\n\r\n    'I saw Errington, who was in Paris on his way to Rome with letters\r\n    from Lord Granville, based on the request of Spencer and Forster that\r\n    he, Errington, should represent the Irish Government at Rome during\r\n    its great struggle with Parnell, matters in Ireland being too serious\r\n    to make roundabout dealing through Lord Emly [Footnote: An Irish Roman\r\n    Catholic M.P. who, after being Postmaster-general, was raised to the\r\n    Peerage.] and Cardinal Howard safe; and Errington was to be tried from\r\n    October until Easter....\r\n\r\n    'In the evening of November 10th, at dinner at the Harcourts', Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, taking me aside about Errington's mission, told me that he\r\n    was bitterly opposed to the notion of reopening relations with the\r\n    Papal Court; and there can be no doubt that he assented most\r\n    unwillingly to the views of Spencer, Forster, and Harcourt in favour\r\n    of the Errington \"Mission.\" He deceived the House of Commons about it,\r\n    because he always closed his own eyes to the facts. [Footnote: The\r\n    line taken by the Government in the House of Commons was that Mr.\r\n    Errington had no formal appointment, and that his communications were\r\n    not officially dealt with by the Foreign Office. These diplomatic\r\n    explanations only increased the suspicion of the followers of Parnell\r\n    and of the Ultra-Protestants led by Sir H. Drummond Wolff.]\r\n\r\n    'On December 24th, 1881, Lord O'Hagan passed through Paris, despatched\r\n    on a secret mission to Rome about Ireland by Forster, who was not\r\n    satisfied with the results up to then of the Errington Mission.'\r\n\r\n    'On December 31st I received a letter from Forster, in which he said\r\n    that Lord O'Hagan had returned, and that no notice had been taken by\r\n    the papers of his visit to Rome, which was a good thing.'\r\n\r\nTo the principle of such intermediation Sir Charles had no objection. What\r\nhe disliked was that the thing should be done and denied. He himself in\r\nthe previous year had written by the Government's request to Cardinal\r\nManning at Rome for assurance that the future Bishop of a new See in\r\nCanada would be a British subject. Manning also had written to him\r\nconcerning the establishment of a new See for Catholics of the Levant,\r\nwith its seat in Cyprus, guaranteeing that \"the influence of our Bishop\r\nand all about him would be ... strictly in support of the Government,\" and\r\nasking therefore that, \"when the seat of Government for Cyprus had been\r\nfixed, Rome might be informed, as it would be desirable for the Bishop to\r\nbe in the same place.\"\r\n\r\nManning was quite content with the influence that he could wield, and, as\r\na letter from him in 1885 shows, was strongly against diplomatic relations\r\nbetween England and the Vatican. Sir Charles, however, did not take that\r\nview:\r\n\r\n    'Such perpetual applications have to be made to the Court of Rome, not\r\n    only (as the public thinks) with regard to Irish affairs, but with\r\n    regard to Roman Catholic interests in all parts of the world, that I\r\n    have always been favourable to taking the public into our confidence\r\n    in the matter and appointing a representative at the Court of Rome. At\r\n    one time we used to carry on our affairs with the Papal Court through\r\n    Cardinal Howard, an English Cardinal; but the Pope is so anxious to\r\n    obtain official representation that he throws difficulties in the way\r\n    of ecclesiastics acting as informal representatives. Then Lord O'Hagan\r\n    used to go to Rome, at the expense of Irish Secret Service money, as a\r\n    private traveller, and he used to carry on negotiations with the\r\n    Vatican.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles resented 'the complications that are caused by our having to\r\ndo that in fact which we refuse to do in form.' The Errington \"Mission,\r\nwhich was no mission,\" was an instance.\r\n\r\nThough the year drew to its close there was still no decision as to the\r\nmeans of dealing with obstruction. But approach was being made to a\r\nsettled policy.\r\n\r\n    'On my return to London I found that a Cabinet had been called for\r\n    Thursday, November 10th, to deal with the forms of the House, as the\r\n    Speaker and Erskine May had been concocting a new code, which, I\r\n    added, \"is certain to be perfectly useless, as the Speaker is\r\n    generally, and May invariably, wrong.... Direct closure is the only\r\n    thing of any use. That would be one fight and no more; but the\r\n    Speaker-May code would probably take a whole Session to get, and be\r\n    useless when we have got it.'\r\n\r\n'When Chamberlain came to dinner on November 11th, he left with me till\r\nthe next day the \"secret\" paper printed for the Cabinet as to the forms of\r\nthe House, which was written by May and annotated by the Speaker, and I\r\nwas glad to find that it included closure.'\r\n\r\nIn a Parliamentary Session marked by so much that was inconclusive, Sir\r\nCharles had the satisfaction of recording in his diary one piece of\r\nprogressive legislation which was his own. By April, 1881, he had got\r\nready his Bill for putting an end to the Unreformed Municipal\r\nCorporations, and so carrying out the policy which he had recommended\r\nwhile in Opposition, and it became law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the general European situation was still critical. The Greeks had\r\nseen Montenegro's claim made good while their own pretensions remained\r\nunsatisfied, and at the beginning of the year war between Greece and\r\nTurkey seemed so probable that Lord Houghton was writing anxiously to ask\r\nSir Charles by what means the antiquities of Athens could be guaranteed\r\nagainst bombardment.\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes, on January 18th and 21st, conversations between himself\r\nand Mr. Goschen, who had temporarily returned from his mission at\r\nConstantinople, 'as to helping Greece by a naval force, which he and I\r\nboth desired.' But Mr. Gladstone refused his sanction to this project, and\r\nSir Charles for the moment took a very grave view, noting in his diary on\r\nFebruary 1st:\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Granville has now to decide (in two days), before Goschen starts\r\n    for Constantinople via Berlin, whether he will disgracefully abandon\r\n    Greece or break up the Concert of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Concert was kept together, but only upon condition of limiting Greece\r\nto a frontier with which Sir Charles was extremely discontented.\r\n\r\n    'On March 27th I was in a resigning humour about Greece, but could not\r\n    get anybody to agree with me, and Chamberlain said that not even\r\n    Liberal public opinion in England would now support isolated action or\r\n    Anglo-Italian intervention. Chamberlain thought that in the interest\r\n    of Greece herself it was desirable that she should be made to take the\r\n    last Turkish offer, which gave her all the revenue-producing country,\r\n    and kept from her the costly and the dangerous country.'\r\n\r\nA week later he wrote a minute for Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone,\r\nproposing that autonomy should be given to those portions of Epirote\r\nterritory which were being withheld from Greece; but this plan was\r\nnegatived, and a final settlement was reached on May 17th.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of 1881 was not a settlement which contented Greece and the\r\nfriends of Greece; and it was only a provisional settlement.\r\n\r\nBut new complications were developing elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    'On February 1st I wrote to Gambetta by our \"bag\" to tell him that\r\n    Sheffield' (Lord Lyons's secretary) 'would call on him from me to tell\r\n    him a secret. This secret was that the Three Emperors' League was\r\n    again revived and France once more isolated. But this was such a dead\r\n    secret that even our Cabinet were not to know for fear some of them\r\n    might talk.' [Footnote: The murder of the Emperor Alexander II. on\r\n    March 13th terminated these plans for the time. But out of them\r\n    subsequently grew the meeting of the three Emperors at Skierniewice on\r\n    September 15th and 16th, 1884; and indirectly Prince Bismarck's\r\n    \"reinsurance\" treaty with Russia, which his successor, Caprivi,\r\n    refused to renew in 1890.]\r\n\r\nFrance, though 'isolated,' was beginning to take action which threatened\r\nfar-spreading trouble. Mention has been made of her pretension to Tunis,\r\nand of the support to that pretension afforded by a hint of Lord\r\nSalisbury's in 1878. In the early spring of 1881 the first serious step\r\nwas taken to threaten the independence or quasi-independence of Tunis.\r\nThis development was the more serious because an important dispute was in\r\nprogress concerning a Tunisian estate called the Enfida, to which rival\r\nclaims were put forward by M. Lévy, a British subject, and by a French\r\ncompany, the Société Marseillaise. On January 12th M. Lévy's\r\nrepresentative, himself also a British subject, was expelled from the\r\nproperty by agents of the French Consulate.\r\n\r\n    'On February 3rd there came to me at ten o'clock in my Foreign Office\r\n    boxes a telegram from Lord Lyons, which told us that the French had\r\n    sent the _Friedland_ from Toulon to Tunis to bully the Bey. I wrote\r\n    off by special messenger to Lord Granville that we ought at once to\r\n    send the fleet to Tunis unless the _Friedland_ were withdrawn, and\r\n    Lord Granville accepted this view, and telegraphed to Lord Lyons to\r\n    that effect at noon. [Footnote: 'On February 5th, the Cabinet having\r\n    approved our suggestion, we telegraphed for the _Thunderer_ and a\r\n    despatch-boat to sail at once for Tunis.']\r\n\r\n    'Our difficulty was in this matter to avoid acting with Italy. We did\r\n    not want to keep the French out of Tunis, but we could not have\r\n    ironclads used to force Tunisian law courts into giving decisions\r\n    hostile to British subjects. Barrère wrote to me from Paris at\r\n    Gambetta's wish saying that I was labouring under a grievous mistake\r\n    in thinking that the _Friedland_ was sent to settle the Enfida case\r\n    against the English. The ship was sent because the Bey \"declines to\r\n    sign a treaty of alliance with us.\" At the same time he went on to say\r\n    that the present policy of France would not last longer than six\r\n    months, which meant, of course, that Gambetta intended to form a\r\n    Government at that time (which as a fact he did), and that \"our friend\r\n    deplores the present policy of the Government and declines all\r\n    responsibility.\"'\r\n\r\nOn August 25th Gambetta expressed to Dilke \"profound disapprobation of all\r\nthat has been done in Tunis,\" on which is noted: 'Possibly he would have\r\ndone the same, but he is very wise after the event.'\r\n\r\n    'On May 6th Lord Granville, against Tenterden's opinion and my own,\r\n    sketched drafts to Germany and Austria as to the position of the\r\n    French in Tunis, with a view to raise the Concert of Europe in their\r\n    path. We pointed out to him that Germany and Austria would snub us,\r\n    and succeeded at last in stopping this precious scheme. The wily\r\n    Russian got up the trouble by hinting verbally to Lord Granville that\r\n    Russia would act with England and Italy in this matter. A curious\r\n    league: England, Russia, and Italy against France; and a queer\r\n    Concert. The proposal led to trouble three days later, for, of course,\r\n    the Russians told the French in such a way as to make them believe\r\n    that the idea was ours.'\r\n\r\nOn the evening of May eth Sir Charles met Laffitte, \"the Comtist Pope,\" at\r\nthe Political Economy Club.\r\n\r\n    'Frederic Harrison treated him as an old lady of the Faubourg would\r\n    treat the Pope or the Comte de Chambord, or both rolled into one. But\r\n    Laffitte happening to say that he approved of the French expedition to\r\n    Tunis, Harrison's feelings became too much even for his reverence and\r\n    his religion. Laffitte's remark, from Laffitte, showed, however, how\r\n    unanimous was the French feeling....\r\n\r\n    'On the 9th the trouble which I had expected broke out. The French\r\n    Ambassador (Challemel-Lacour) came to see me in a great rage, and told\r\n    me that his Government had heard that we had tried to raise Germany\r\n    against France on the Tunis question by an alliance offered at Berlin,\r\n    though not through our Ambassador. This particular story was untrue. I\r\n    denied it, and I then went to Lord Granville, who denied it.... I then\r\n    wrote to Challemel to ask him to give up names; but he declined.'\r\n\r\nFrance was in conflict with the Kroumirs on her Algerian frontier, the\r\nexpeditionary force penetrated the interior, and by the middle of June the\r\nBey had appointed M. Roustan, the French Consul, to represent him in all\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nJustifications were put forward, and there was much discussion as to what\r\nLord Salisbury had said or not said at Berlin in 1878.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Salisbury had made Wolff withdraw the question, of which\r\n    (foolishly from the Conservative point of view) he had given notice,\r\n    but the matter having been raised, the Cabinet, on Friday, 13th,\r\n    decided to publish a portion of Lord Salisbury's despatches, though\r\n    not the worst.... [Footnote: A letter from Lord Granville to Sir\r\n    Charles, of May 15th, 1881, shows the difficulty. \"I sent, according\r\n    to custom, the Salisbury Tunis papers to the Marquis. You will be\r\n    surprised to hear that he does not like them. He objects to all, but\r\n    principally to the extracts from Lord Lyons' despatch.\" Lord Granville\r\n    goes on to suggest alternative courses, the first being \"to consent at\r\n    his request to leave out the extracts, with a warning that it is not\r\n    likely it will be possible to refuse them later.\"]\r\n\r\n    'I wrote to Lord Granville to say that I was sorry there had not been\r\n    included in the papers a despatch of July 16th, 1878, giving the\r\n    conversation between Lord Lyons and Waddington on Waddington's return\r\n    to Paris' (from the Congress of Berlin). 'On the 9th, on the 11th, and\r\n    on the 13th July, 1878, Lord Lyons had reported the irritation in\r\n    France at the Cyprus Convention. On July 16th Waddington returned to\r\n    Paris, and the row in the French Press suddenly ceased. In his\r\n    despatch Lord Lyons says that Waddington told him that Lord Salisbury\r\n    \"had assured him\" that \"H. M. G. would make no objection if it suited\r\n    France to take possession of Tunis.\" [Footnote: The Life of Lord\r\n    Lyons, by Lord Newton, gives, on July 20th, 1878, a letter from Lord\r\n    Salisbury which evidently refers to the despatch. In this letter Lord\r\n    Salisbury says: \"What M. Waddington said to you is very much what he\r\n    said to me at Berlin....\" A further passage in the letter is: \"If\r\n    France occupied Tunis tomorrow, we should not remonstrate.\" See _Life\r\n    of Lord Lyons_, vol. ii., p. 152.] Waddington said that he--\r\n    Waddington--had pointed out to Lord Salisbury that Italy would object,\r\n    and that Lord Salisbury had replied that she must \"seek compensation\r\n    in Tripoli.\" Corti had also assured me that Lord Salisbury had said\r\n    this to him at the time. I strongly urged the publication of Lord\r\n    Lyons' despatch in justice to ourselves, if anything was to be\r\n    published. Lord Salisbury undoubtedly, and even by his own admission,\r\n    had used most impolitic language, giving up that which was contrary to\r\n    British interests to give up and which was not ours to give. (He was\r\n    fated to do the same thing in the case of Madagascar.) He had\r\n    afterwards denied that he had done anything of the kind. He also had\r\n    denied that France had minded our occupation of Cyprus, and doubly\r\n    concealed the fact that after making the foolish mistake of taking\r\n    Cyprus, he had got out of the difficulty in a still more foolish\r\n    fashion.'\r\n\r\nThis led to correspondence between Count Corti, then Italian Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, and Sir Charles--a discussion which was renewed later in\r\nconversation:\r\n\r\n    'He in fact admitted the truth of what I had said, but added that he\r\n    disapproved of the Berlin conversations. \"At that time everybody was\r\n    telling everybody else to take something which belonged to somebody\r\n    else. One more powerful than Lord Salisbury, more powerful than Lord\r\n    Beaconsfield, advised me to take Tunis. [Footnote: _Life of Lord\r\n    Lyons_, vol. ii., p. 224; letter from Lord Lyons to Lord Granville,\r\n    May 13th, 1881: \"They got Bismarck's leave for this.\"] Lord Salisbury\r\n    advised me to take an island, and Lord Salisbury may have advised me\r\n    to take Tripoli.\" At the State ball in the evening, I told Odo Russell\r\n    this. He told me that Lord Salisbury had disgusted Corti by forgetting\r\n    him on the occasion when he told the great men at the Congress of\r\n    Berlin about the occupation of Cyprus, and that Corti had never\r\n    forgiven him.'\r\n\r\nEgypt also was now a growing anxiety, made graver by the events in Tunis,\r\nwhich excited apprehensions of like proceedings elsewhere. In such a\r\ncondition of feeling even trifling incidents--as, for example, that of the\r\nSmyrna Quays, where the Porte had violated some rights of an English\r\ncompany--grew delicate and critical. All such matters and many others had\r\nto be dealt with in the House of Commons by question and answer--a task of\r\nno small difficulty, since the susceptibilities of foreign Powers had to\r\nbe considered, while British interests, no less sensitive, could not be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nThe fulfilment of the Treaty of Berlin was meanwhile an enormous addition\r\nto the work of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, especially as it was at\r\nfirst complicated by the ill will of Russia, which had hoped that the\r\nchange of Government might bring about some modifications. It was also\r\ncomplicated by the Porte's unlimited capacity for wasting time. The topics\r\nregulated by the treaty and its supplementary conventions, when taken in\r\nconnection with the Treaties of Paris and London, which it partly\r\nsuperseded, fell under at least seventeen separate heads; each of these\r\nbranched off into numerous divisions and subdivisions, most of which\r\nadmitted of possible controversy, while many required executive action by\r\nCommissioners on the spot, [Footnote: Thomas Erskine Holland, _The\r\nEuropean Concert in the Eastern Question_, pp. 222-225.] such as the\r\ndelimitation of the boundaries of the new States. Nearly every question\r\ninvolved communications with the signatory Powers, and each of them had a\r\nlong diplomatic history which had to be studied. M. de Courcel told Sir\r\nCharles that in his dreams he always saw a second river flowing by the\r\nside of the Danube, as large and as swift, but black--the river of ink\r\nwhich had been shed over the Danube question! Sir Julian Pauncefote, the\r\nPermanent Under-Secretary, was credited by Sir Charles with being the only\r\nman in England who then understood it; and the question of the Danube,\r\nafter all, was only one of many.\r\n\r\nQuestions were continually being asked in the House of Commons, where the\r\nexpert in foreign affairs was not so rare as he became in a subsequent\r\nperiod; but the inquiries of inexpert persons were the most troublesome of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's power of terse and guarded reply was universally considered\r\nsupreme, and was all the more valuable at a time when the practice had\r\ngrown up, then comparatively new and since gradually limited, of asking\r\nquestions on foreign and colonial affairs, with the object of embarrassing\r\nMinisters, and without regard to the consequences abroad. It gradually\r\nbecame a dangerous growth, greatly facilitated by the lax procedure, as it\r\nthen existed, of the House of Commons in regard to supplementary\r\nquestions. This procedure often allowed question time to degenerate into a\r\nsort of ill-regulated debate. Mr. Gladstone's habit of allowing himself\r\nvery frequently to be drawn into giving a further answer, after the\r\ncarefully prepared official answer had already been given by the Under-\r\nSecretary, was another complication. The brunt of all these troubles had\r\nto be borne by the representative of the Foreign Office. [Footnote: Sir\r\nHenry Lucy, writing \"From the Cross Benches\" in this year, discussed\r\ncritically the various styles of answering questions:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Charles Dilke's answers are perfect, whether in regard of manner,\r\nmatter, or style. A small grant of public money might be much worse\r\nexpended than in reprinting his answer to two questions put last night on\r\nthe subject of Anglo-French commercial relations, having them framed and\r\nglazed, and hung up in the bedroom of every Minister. A good test of the\r\nperhaps unconscious skill and natural art with which the answer is drawn\r\nup would be for anyone to take the verbatim report which appears in this\r\nmorning's papers and attempt to make it shorter. There is not a word too\r\nmuch in it. It occupies just twenty-eight lines of print, and it contains\r\na clear and full account of an exceedingly intricate negotiation. The\r\nmajority of the answers given by Ministers in their places in Parliament\r\nappear much better in print than when spoken, redundancies being cut out,\r\nparentheses put straight, and hesitancy of manner not appearing. But to\r\nthe orderly mind and clear intelligence which instinctively brings\r\nuppermost and in due sequence the principal points of a question, Sir\r\nCharles Dilke adds a frank manner, a clear voice, and an easy delivery.\"]\r\n\r\nSir Charles was always a close student of Indian government, and many\r\nnotes on it are scattered through his diary. On January 9th, meeting\r\nMallet at York House with the Grant Duffs, he says: 'I had always held a\r\nstrong opinion against the India Council, and Mallet confirmed me in my\r\nview that the existing constitution was bad. He ought to know.' The\r\nGovernment turned to Dilke for assistance in debates on foreign affairs,\r\neven in a case where the Government of India rather than the Foreign\r\nOffice was involved.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1881 England's policy in Afghanistan had been finally\r\ndetermined. The evacuation of Kandahar was now definitive, in spite of\r\nopposition from a high quarter. On January 18th 'the Queen telegraphed to\r\nMr. Gladstone at length in a tone of severe rebuke that all her warnings\r\nas to Kandahar had been disregarded.' On March 8th Sir Charles received a\r\npreliminary warning from Lord Hartington to read up his Central Asian\r\npapers, and--\r\n\r\n    'the Cabinet of March 19th wrote to me to follow Edward Stanhope as to\r\n    Kandahar debate' (who had been Lord Beaconsfield's Under-Secretary of\r\n    State for India in 1878, and now naturally led the Tory attack). 'I\r\n    had to move the direct negative on behalf of the Government. This was\r\n    a great compliment, as the matter was not in my department, and the\r\n    only three members of the Government who were to speak were Mr.\r\n    Gladstone and Lord Hartington and myself.'\r\n\r\nAfter the debate on March 24th, Lord Granville, having first sent his own\r\ncongratulations, wrote to say: \"Gladstone expressed himself almost\r\npoetically about the excellence of your speech.\" [Footnote: \"The speech of\r\nthe debate was that of Sir Charles Dilke. It was close, cogent, and to the\r\npoint throughout. His facts were admirably marshalled, so as to strengthen\r\nwithout obscuring his arguments. There was no fencing, no rhetoric, no\r\nfighting the air.\r\n\r\nHe came at once to close quarters with his adversary, and demolished his\r\narguments one after another by a series of cut-and-thrust rejoinders,\r\nwhich left but little to be added by those who followed him on the same\r\nside. Mr. Stanhope's attack on the Ministry has been of conspicuous\r\nservice to at least one Minister\" (_Pall Mall Gazette_, edited by Mr. John\r\nMorley).]\r\n\r\nIn the course of this year, Sir Charles, once more diverging from Radical\r\npreconceptions, helped Sir Robert Sandeman, who was\r\n\r\n    'sent over by the Viceroy to state his views. I was able to give him\r\n    such assistance with my colleagues as to save the districts (the\r\n    Pishin districts and the Khojak frontier) to the Indian Government.'\r\n\r\nIn this Sir Charles was with Lord Ripon, but a draft treaty of Lord\r\nRipon's, which proposed to surrender Merv ('not ours to give'), roused his\r\nfierce opposition, and was rejected by the Cabinet. He was always resolute\r\nfor a strong frontier policy in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the Emperor of Russia on March 13th in this year\r\nroused all the Home Offices into activity, and England was as usual taxed\r\nwith being the asylum of every desperado. Sir William Harcourt inclined\r\nstrongly to the demands of the police, including the prosecution of\r\nSocialist publications, and he carried the Cabinet with him.\r\n\r\n    'On March 26th I noted in my diary: \"...At to-day's Cabinet Bright was\r\n    the only Minister who opposed the prosecution of the _Freiheit_, and\r\n    Chamberlain positively supported it.\"'\r\n\r\nIt may be added that Sir Charles was charged by a certain Mr. Maltman\r\nBarry with having subscribed to the funds of the _Freiheit_, which was an\r\nanarchist publication. The charge was met by an absolute denial, and was\r\nsupported by no evidence. It was, however, fathered in the House by Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill, and this led to a breach of friendly relations with\r\nthe latter, which lasted for some time.\r\n\r\n    'On April 9th I was in Paris, and breakfasted with Gambetta, who told\r\n    me that Bismarck was about to propose a Conference, which was insisted\r\n    on by Russia, concerning the right of asylum, and we agreed that\r\n    England and France should refuse together to take part in it.'\r\n\r\nA fortnight later Sir Charles, returning from Toulon, was able to offer\r\nhis congratulations to Gambetta, because France had declined to attend the\r\nConference. But the matter was still open as regarded England, and\r\n\r\n    'on April 30th, and again on May 3rd, I noted that Sir William was\r\n    \"wrongheaded about the right of asylum,\" but that I hoped he would not\r\n    be allowed by his colleagues to offer to legislate on extradition to\r\n    please the Russians.'\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet on May 4th\r\n\r\n    'there was a long debate upon nihilism. Lord Granville some time\r\n    before had told the Russians that legislation was intended. That was\r\n    so, for a Bill had been prepared. But it was clear that it would be\r\n    foolish to introduce it. Kimberley and Chamberlain were against all\r\n    proposals to meet the Russians. Then came before the Cabinet the\r\n    question of Harcourt's reply to Cowen's question to be put on the next\r\n    day, whether information was given by the English police to the\r\n    Austrian police as to Socialist addresses in Vienna, which had led to\r\n    arrests. Our police say that they only told the Austrians of a place\r\n    where dynamite was stored. This seemed to me a cock and bull of Howard\r\n    Vincent's. Harcourt had drafted a reply about Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\n    which the Cabinet wanted him to alter, but when he is pleased with an\r\n    answer it is not easy to make him alter it, as I noted. As our police\r\n    virtually denied the charge, Harcourt might have given their denial,\r\n    as theirs, in their own words, but nothing would induce him to do\r\n    this.'\r\n\r\nAs regarded Russia, Lord Granville based himself on the fact that a\r\nsimilar arrangement existed between England and Germany, and he questioned\r\nwhether political offenders would be much safer in a German than in a\r\nRussian court of law. To the promise of backing from France, he objected\r\nthat M. Saint-Hilaire had already pledged himself to an extradition treaty\r\nwith Russia. On the latter point Sir Charles answered that for this\r\namongst other reasons M. Saint-Hilaire was about to be removed from the\r\nFrench Foreign Office. In the end of October, 1881, Sir Charles was seeing\r\nGambetta frequently, and observes that he was\r\n\r\n    'much excited about the question of the extradition treaty with\r\n    Russia....\r\n\r\n    'Curious though it seems to us (in 1890-1895), when we know how\r\n    intensely pro-Russian Gambetta's friends now are, Gambetta was\r\n    intensely anti-Russian and pro-Turk....\r\n\r\n    'There is the same difference of opinion in the French Cabinet as to\r\n    the making of an extradition treaty with Russia as there is in ours,\r\n    where Harcourt wants it and his colleagues do not. This was the only\r\n    subject discussed at the interview of the Russian and German Emperors\r\n    at Danzig' (September, 1881), 'and England and France are in their\r\n    black books.'\r\n\r\nLord Granville constantly referred to Sir Charles for advice as to the\r\ntemper of the House of Commons, though in this case he supported Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt, and might be excused for failing to see what was plain\r\nto Sir Charles as a practical House of Commons politician, that, apart\r\nfrom principles, a Liberal Ministry would be sadly embarrassed if it had\r\nto defend the handing over of political refugees to the Russian police,\r\nand that the Tories would probably support the Radical wing in a vote of\r\ncensure.\r\n\r\nThe combination at the Foreign Office of the two Ministers, the old and\r\nthe young, the Whig and the democrat, worked excellently, and Lord\r\nGranville, in telling Sir Charles that in his absence in France during the\r\nSession Hartington must answer his questions, said that 'picking out any\r\nof those who are not in the Cabinet is an indication of what would be done\r\nwhen that terrible moment may come to me of your leaving the P.O.' One\r\nmatter had, however, caused Sir Charles uneasiness.\r\n\r\nIn the close of the year 1880 there was a proposal to give a charter to\r\nthe North Borneo Company. No ordinary politician knew anything of this\r\nCompany, but Sir Charles, while in Opposition, had grounds for asking\r\nquestions hostile to it, and had stirred up Mr. Rylands to do the same.\r\nThis fact Dilke mentioned to Lord Granville. But, finding Foreign Office\r\nopinion in favour of the concession, he promised that\r\n\r\n    'I would not take an active part in opposition to the Charter scheme\r\n    if and providing the Cabinet approved of it.... On November 19th,\r\n    1880, the box, which had been round the Cabinet on the North Borneo\r\n    business, having returned without any comment by Mr. Gladstone, I got\r\n    it sent again to Mr. Gladstone, who finally decided, I was informed by\r\n    Lord Granville, against Herbert of the Colonial Office, Harcourt,\r\n    Chamberlain, Bright, Childers, and myself, and with Lord Kimberley,\r\n    the Chancellor, and Lord Granville. So it was settled that the Charter\r\n    was to be granted; but a little later Mr. Gladstone forgot the\r\n    decision which he had given, insisted that he had never heard of the\r\n    matter at all, went the other way and would have stopped the Charter,\r\n    but for the fact that it was too late.'\r\n\r\nThis made Sir Charles exceedingly indisposed to undertake the defence of\r\nit in a House of Commons where his own questions asked in Opposition would\r\nassuredly be quoted against him by Sir John Gorst, who, when the Charter\r\nwas published in December, tabled a motion against it. 'It was not so much\r\nto the thing itself I was opposed as to the manner in which it was done.'\r\nHe therefore wrote to Lord Granville that he had made full search for\r\nprecedents, 'the first thing which occurs to a Radical in distress,' and\r\nthat finding no modern precedent, he simply could not undertake to defend\r\nthe Charter, his objections being that to make such a grant without the\r\nknowledge of Parliament strained the prerogative of the Crown, and,\r\nfurther, that the Foreign Office was not the fit department to control a\r\ncolony (as had been urged in the case of Cyprus). He notes: 'Gambetta\r\ntells me that he has at once had an application from a similar French\r\nCompany--for the New Hebrides.' Lord Granville made official reply, with\r\nsome asperity. But he sent a separate unofficial letter, in which, after\r\ntreating of other matters, he smoothed over his more formal communication.\r\nThese letters were received by Sir Charles on December 27th, 1881, on his\r\nreturn to Paris from Toulon.[Footnote: Later Sir Charles notes: 'My own\r\nobjections (besides those to the form in which the matter had been\r\nconsidered) were to the absence of sufficient provisions with regard to\r\ndomestic slavery and opium, but as regards these two latter points I\r\nsucceeded in getting the gap filled in.'] The unofficial letter ran:\r\n\r\n    \"I have sent you an answer on a separate piece of paper to your rather\r\n    blowing-up letter about Borneo. You have been misled by Spencer's\r\n    ignorance and Gladstone's very natural forgetfulness of the\r\n    particulars. It was more inexcusable of me to have forgotten what it\r\n    appears you told me about your and Rylands' previous action. When my\r\n    liver does not act and official work becomes unusually irksome, I\r\n    sometimes ask myself upon what question I should like to be beaten and\r\n    turned out. The first would be fair trade. The second, which the _St.\r\n    James's_ and Raikes, the late Chairman of Committees, seem to\r\n    anticipate, is failure to reform the procedure of the Commons owing to\r\n    Tory and Home Rule obstruction. I should not think Borneo a fatal\r\n    question for this purpose.... There is a great run upon us now as to\r\n    Ireland, but do you remember a December when it was not generally\r\n    supposed that the Government of the day was going to the dogs?\"\r\n\r\nThe matter passed over, but was serious enough for Mr. Chamberlain to say\r\nin January of the following year:\r\n\r\n    \"If, what I do not expect, the affair should proceed to extremities, I\r\n    shall stand or fall with you.\"\r\n\r\nOne other matter of this period is interesting as showing Sir Charles and\r\nhis chief at work. A draft was on its way to the Colonial Office, 'laying\r\ndown the law for dealing with fugitive slaves who escaped into the British\r\nsphere of influence'--a case of constant occurrence at Zanzibar. Sir\r\nCharles's views on this and kindred subjects were strong, and he worked\r\nthen, as always, with the Aborigines Protection Society. He stopped it--\r\n\r\n    'and Lord Granville wrote upon my views a characteristic minute': \"I\r\n    think our proposed draft is right and defensible in argument. I also\r\n    am of opinion that your condemnation of it is right, because the fact\r\n    is that the national sentiment is so strongly opposed to what is\r\n    enjoined by international law that it is better not to wake the cat as\r\n    long as she is asleep!\"'\r\n\r\nAt the end of July, 1881, Lord Granville's health seemed seriously\r\naffected, and Sir Charles noted that, apart from his own personal feeling,\r\nhis chief's enforced retirement would be 'a great misfortune.' The choice\r\nwould be between Lords Derby, Hartington, Kimberley, and Northbrook. Lord\r\nDerby seemed to him 'undecided and weak,' Lord Northbrook still weaker,\r\nwhile Lord Hartington 'knew no French and nothing of foreign affairs.' Of\r\nLord Kimberley's ability he had not then formed a high estimate; but he\r\nadds that, having afterwards sat with him in the Cabinet, he changed that\r\nopinion, finding him 'a wise man,' who never did himself justice in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in the course of 1881 Sir Charles had refused to defend in the\r\nHouse of Commons a special grant for defraying the Prince of Wales's\r\nexpenses on a Garter Mission to St. Petersburg, and Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, had to undertake this\r\ntask, which more properly belonged to the Foreign Office, the Prince's\r\nrelations with him were cordial. The Prince was increasingly inclined to\r\ninterest himself in foreign politics, but received very little\r\nencouragement from the Court. In June, 1880 (when the rumours as to\r\nChallemel-Lacour were being set afloat [Footnote: For an account of these\r\nrumours see Chapter XXII., p. 353.]), Sir Charles noted that, as far as he\r\ncould ascertain, the Prince of Wales,\r\n\r\n    'being not at this time admitted by the Queen to \"official knowledge,\"\r\n    got the whole of his modern history from the _Figaro_....\r\n\r\n    'On the evening of February 19th, 1881, I dined with Lord and Lady\r\n    Spencer to meet the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Prince spoke to\r\n    me about his anxiety to be kept informed of foreign affairs, and the\r\n    Princess spoke to me in the same sense, telling me how fond she was of\r\n    her brother the \"King of Greece,\" and how anxious therefore about his\r\n    business. The Prince asked me whether he could, while in Paris, do\r\n    anything to help on the negotiation of a new treaty of commerce, and I\r\n    wrote to him next morning to suggest the language that he should hold.\r\n    Ferry, the Prime Minister, I pointed out, was a Protectionist, and I\r\n    suggested that the Prince should say to Ferry how important for the\r\n    good understanding of the two countries it would be to conclude a fair\r\n    treaty at once....\r\n\r\n    'On the 18th I had written to Gambetta to tell him that I should be in\r\n    Paris on April 9th and on April 24th, and that I was to see him, but\r\n    that no one was to know; and on March 20th I received his answer\r\n    accepting my conditions. The Prince of Wales had carried out the\r\n    suggestion which I had made, having taken my letter with him, and read\r\n    it over immediately before seeing Jules Ferry, upon whom he seemed to\r\n    have made some impression.'\r\n\r\nThis Sir Charles learnt from a letter of Gambetta's of March 30th, which\r\nended: \"Je vous attends le 9 avril au matin, incognito strict\r\nimpénétrable, ou le 24 au retour Á votre choix.\" At this meeting Sir\r\nCharles received from Gambetta the assurance that delegates would be sent\r\nto London to attempt the negotiation of a treaty.\r\n\r\nSir Charles did not believe that a treaty would be concluded. In his\r\njudgment England would not consent to accept a treaty unless it were an\r\nimprovement on the existing position, and such a treaty France was not\r\nlikely to give. But he believed that by negotiating better terms could be\r\nobtained, not indeed by treaty, but under the tariff which the French\r\nlegislature would introduce by Bill. [Footnote: Gambetta kept in touch\r\nwith Sir Charles throughout on this matter, writing April 16th: \"Nous\r\ncauserons de toutes ces sottes affaires, que je ne peux m'imaginer aussi\r\nmal conduites, mais il y a encore de l'espoir, croyez-moi.\"]\r\n\r\nA joint Commission was nominated to sit in London, with Challemel-\r\nLacour and Dilke for its respective heads. The other English Commissioners\r\nwere Sir C. Rivers Wilson, who was a Treasury official before he became\r\nFinance Minister in Egypt; Mr. C. M. Kennedy, head of the Commercial\r\nDepartment of the Foreign Office; and Mr. W. E. Baxter, the member for\r\nDundee. Sir Charles says of the preliminary meetings, which were concerned\r\nwith a wrangle between him and Challemel-Lacour as to the extent to which\r\nM. Léon Say had committed his Government:\r\n\r\n    'We got no further, but we were both very much pleased with ourselves\r\n    for the manner in which we argued. Challemel, being an orator and\r\n    having the use of his own tongue, was at an advantage, but I managed\r\n    to hold my own, I think, pretty well.'\r\n\r\n    'At the second meeting, May 30th, I began a course of speeches on pig\r\n    iron and such matters which was destined to continue for many months.\r\n    I used to get up my technical terms in the morning (the \"jargon,\" as\r\n    the French call it), and to forget them immediately after. I believe\r\n    that on this day I forgot the French for \"steel blooms\" within five\r\n    minutes after being most learned in regard to them.'\r\n\r\nThe sittings went on throughout June, 1881, with results in some respects\r\nfavourable. But the matter had now a political as well as a commercial\r\naspect. It was probable that Gambetta was about to form a Government,\r\nthough it was unlikely to come into being before the late autumn, after\r\nthe French general election. On both sides there was a desire to have\r\nfriendly relations, but public feeling was extremely sensitive in both\r\ncountries. The occupation of Tunis had produced a certain tension with the\r\nForeign Office; and in France the growing Protectionist movement made it\r\ncertain that if England, which from 1860 onward had enjoyed special terms\r\nin her commerce with France, was again to have a special treaty, it would\r\nnot be so favourable.\r\n\r\nThe position in July was that a treaty giving certain advantages to\r\nEngland could be secured at once from M. Ferry's Ministry, and that a\r\ntotal failure of the negotiations was in itself to be deprecated. Lord\r\nLyons was for concluding the treaty which might be made at once, fearing\r\nlest England should be put under the general tariff. Here Sir Charles's\r\nfamiliarity with Parliament made him invaluable. He perceived that any\r\ntreaty which could be made at this moment would leave certain leading\r\nBritish industries--notably cottons and woollens--worse off than they had\r\nbeen under the expiring arrangement, and therefore would probably be upset\r\nby a vote in the House of Commons. This would be disastrous. It seemed to\r\nhim better to wait till Gambetta came in, and to do the best he could with\r\nthe new Government. This decision prevailed, Sir Charles persuading Mr.\r\nChamberlain to support his view in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, however, to insist on prolongation of the existing treaty\r\nas a condition of continuing the negotiations, and Sir Charles now\r\nproposed to strengthen his hand by a threat of retaliation. He was invited\r\nby the Prime Minister to attend a meeting of the Cabinet in regard to\r\ncommercial treaties on August 6th.\r\n\r\n    'The result was a despatch from myself to Mr. Adams [Footnote:\r\n    Afterwards Sir Francis Adams. He was then Chargé d'Affaires in Paris,\r\n    and later Minister in Switzerland. He was at this moment in charge of\r\n    the Embassy during Lord Lyons's absence.] which was not included in\r\n    the Blue-Book afterwards laid before Parliament. It ended by relating\r\n    a conversation with the French Ambassador on the previous day, in\r\n    which I threatened (and this was the reason for not placing the\r\n    despatch before Parliament) that if we did not come to a satisfactory\r\n    understanding with France, we should make treaties with Spain,\r\n    Portugal, and Italy, in which we should reduce the rate of duty on the\r\n    dear wines produced by those countries, and raise the rate of duty on\r\n    the less strong wines produced by France. I have always been a\r\n    reciprocitarian to this extent, and was always backed in using such\r\n    arguments by Chamberlain, who held the same view in a still stronger\r\n    form. Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville always prevented any public\r\n    reference to such matters, but they allowed me to put them in\r\n    despatches, although not to lay them before Parliament.'\r\n\r\nOn August 17th Gambetta again suggested a private interview, and it was\r\ndecided that Dilke should cross, ostensibly on a visit to La Bourboule,\r\nand hold the interview on his way. [Footnote: Gambetta wrote: \"Nons serons\r\nstrictement seuls. Si! les choses électorales ont fort bien tourné, non\r\nsans peine, mais pas de guerre sans blessures.\" (22 août, 1881).] On\r\nAugust 22nd Mr. Adams reported that--\r\n\r\n    'Gambetta was determined that Tirard' (Minister of Commerce in M.\r\n    Ferry's Cabinet) 'should fail, in order that his Government should\r\n    have the glory of succeeding in our negotiations....\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, August 25th, I breakfasted with Gambetta, and then went\r\n    on to La Bourboule. He told me that he was prepared to take office\r\n    without portfolio, \"in order to be able to watch all the others.\"'\r\n\r\n    \"Tuesday, August 30th, '81.--As to the treaty, Gambetta said that M.\r\n    Tirard would not be got rid of in time; some mode must be found of\r\n    turning the difficulty which he had created. He would see him, and\r\n    Tirard would probably propose some plan to me when I called on\r\n    Tuesday\" (this might be Thursday). \"_I suggested... a treaty with some\r\n    small country, and the most-favoured-nation clause with us--we giving\r\n    nothing...._ This was the excellent ultimate outcome.\" [Footnote: This\r\n    paragraph is from a note made at the time.]\r\n\r\nOn September 5th, on his way back from La Bourboule, 'I was officially in\r\nParis, and saw the Ministers, Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire, Jules Ferry, and\r\nTirard; and on the next day, Tuesday the 6th, saw Gambetta privately\r\nwithout their knowledge.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment prolongation of the existing treaty had not been accorded,\r\nand negotiations were in suspense. Sir Charles frankly \"told the Ministers\r\nthat I did not expect we should be able to agree,\" and suggested a plan\r\nwhich, without a special commercial treaty, should secure what had up till\r\nthen been settled in negotiation. France was obliged to renew her treaties\r\nwith Switzerland and Belgium, and might concede to these countries in\r\ndetail 'those things which up to this point we had obtained in\r\nnegotiation.'\r\n\r\nProlongation of the existing treaty was, however, at last accorded, and\r\nconferences were resumed on September 19th in Paris-a change of scene\r\ngreatly to the Commission's advantage.\r\n\r\n    'We now continued to sit day by day in state at the French Foreign\r\n    Office, which contrasted with the simplicity of Downing Street under\r\n    the rule of a parsimonious Treasury. The French certainly know how to\r\n    spend their money, and I fancy that the United Kingdom must suffer in\r\n    negotiations both from the superior style in which foreign Governments\r\n    treat negotiators and from our abstention from the practice pursued by\r\n    foreign Governments of showering decorations upon negotiators. At the\r\n    French Foreign Office, outside the magnificent room in which the\r\n    conferences are held, was a great buffet covered with the most costly\r\n    luxuries, behind which stood tall footmen dressed in the national\r\n    livery of red and blue, and I think that our manufacturers who came in\r\n    to give evidence were in some cases not altogether insensible to the\r\n    attractions offered them. Some of our witnesses, however, were really\r\n    first-class men, and it was a pleasure to hear Mr. Joseph Lee of\r\n    Manchester, who was afterwards knighted on my suggestion, hammering\r\n    the French.... When I called the name of Wedgwood as that of my\r\n    witness upon pottery I noticed the sensation that ran round the French\r\n    Commission, who were under the impression that \"Wedgwood\" was a\r\n    contemporary of Michael Angelo; but, of course, my Wedgwood was not\r\n    the original, though he was a descendant....\r\n\r\n    'During my first long visit to Paris the French Government gave me\r\n    every night the official box at either the Opera or one of the great\r\n    theatres, and I used to go, not that I cared about the theatre, but\r\n    because I was able to give hospitality in this way to our leading\r\n    manufacturers, who were over as our witnesses. We used, indeed, to do\r\n    a good deal of our business at the theatre. The official boxes having\r\n    drawing-rooms at the back, we retired into these, and discussed what\r\n    we were going to say at the Conference the next morning.'\r\n\r\nBut after many sittings negotiations did not seem likely to lead to any\r\nsettlement, and Sir Charles was anxious to break them off. The French\r\nopposed this, urging that prolongation of the treaty would then have been\r\ngained for nothing; and they made a good many small concessions on the\r\nnumerous articles subject to their tariff.\r\n\r\nDuring the sittings Sir Charles Dilke kept Lord Granville posted in a mass\r\nof detail: Ivory and pearl buttons reduced to half; vulcanite goods, an\r\nimprovement on the _status quo_; great and wholly unexpected reduction on\r\nbiscuits; but starch very bad (this was on \"an excellent day for the small\r\nthings\"). Other reports dealt with steel scrap, phosphorus, faience, and\r\nso forth, and by tabulated figures set off the total of losses and gains.\r\nLord Granville, thanking him for these constant reports, remarked with\r\nserene detachment that they were \"as interesting as lists of the betting\r\nin the newspapers just before the Derby. I hope you will win the race.\" He\r\nadded that in his opinion \"Tirard and the Temps were only playing a game\r\nof brag.\"\r\n\r\n    'At my conference on October 24th I had found Tirard very cross, he\r\n    apparently having made up his mind that Gambetta intended to turn him\r\n    out, and having therefore resolved to make the conclusion of a treaty\r\n    impossible in order to attack his successor and to destroy the treaty\r\n    if one were made. He suddenly asked for a vast reduction in the\r\n    English wine duties, and on my refusing to discuss the matter, he\r\n    replied that after the \"enormous concessions\" which had been made to\r\n    us, any French Minister who did not obtain similar concessions from us\r\n    would be worthy of impeachment. He was very rude to me, and evidently\r\n    wanted to provoke an immediate rupture.'\r\n\r\nOn this Sir Charles wrote to Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    \"The Commissioners are in the singular position of trying to arrange\r\n    the terms of a treaty with a Minister who, if the treaty is made, is\r\n    likely to become the private member to move its rejection.\"\r\n\r\n    'I was not much hampered from London at this time. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    wrote: \"I have nothing to do but commend and concur.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On October 28th I determined not to break off negotiations, but\r\n    simply to finish--that is to say, to go clean through the tariff, and\r\n    stop when we had no more to say. We then could leave matters open, and\r\n    begin again in the following month with the new Government which\r\n    Gambetta was about to form.'\r\n\r\nAlready Sir Charles was being introduced to the future members of what\r\ncame to be called the \"Grand Ministère,\" and was not favourably impressed:\r\n\r\n    'On November 2nd, Gambetta having informed me that Rouvier would be\r\n    his Minister of Commerce, and having asked me to meet him, we dined\r\n    together at the Café Anglais, but I was greatly disappointed in him.'\r\n\r\nOn November 5th Sir Charles left Paris for London, nominally for purposes\r\nof consultation; but this was only a pretext to suspend operations till\r\nGambetta came into office, which he did on November 10th. Sir Charles,\r\nbeing then in London, found the British Government of his own opinion,\r\nthat they could hope for no more than most-favoured-nation treatment; but\r\nopinions differed as to how this should be obtained. Mr. Gladstone wanted\r\nto give a pledge that the low duty on the lighter wines--which favoured\r\nFrance, since no other country could produce them-should not be raised.\r\nSir Charles, on the other hand, wanted to threaten the French with a\r\nchange in the duties, which would favour Italy by letting in the slightly\r\nstronger Italian wines at the same rate as \"Gladstone\" clarets.\r\n\r\nOn November 19th he was back in Paris, seeing Rouvier and Gambetta, both\r\nof whom asked for time to prepare the way for a final meeting of the\r\nCommission, and Sir Charles went to his house near Toulon. On December\r\n28th the detail of the French proposals was known, and they were held to\r\nbe unsatisfactory. Gambetta still insisted that an agreement could and\r\nmust be reached, but Dilke was of another opinion, and at the thirty-\r\nseventh sitting, held on the last day of the year, negotiations were\r\nreally broken off. The last sitting, held on January 2nd, 1882, was merely\r\nformal, and that evening Sir Charles left for London. He had not expected\r\nto succeed in concluding a treaty, and he had not concluded one, but he\r\nhad earned high credit from experts. Lord Granville wrote: \"From all sides\r\nI hear praises of your knowledge, tact, and judgment.\" His secretary, Mr.\r\nAustin Lee, [Footnote: Now Sir Henry Austin Lee, K.C.M.G., C.B.,\r\nCommercial attaché for France, Belgium, and Switzerland at the British\r\nEmbassy in Paris.] showed him a letter from one of the Under-Secretaries\r\nof State in the Foreign Office, who\r\n\r\n    'said that it was a blessing to have had me at Paris, because any\r\n    other negotiator would have sent yards of cipher telegram to the\r\n    Office asking to be allowed to give the French all that they demanded\r\n    from us, and proving that we must take whatever we could get from\r\n    them.'\r\n\r\nThe British members of the Commission were unanimous in support of their\r\nchairman, and when Gambetta fell and M. de Freycinet became Prime\r\nMinister, they refused to hold any further sittings. Lord Lyons was\r\nuneasy, and in February, 1882, wrote that the most-favoured-nation treaty\r\nwas a very forlorn hope.\" Mr. Gladstone thereupon wished to give his\r\npledge against any raising of the duties.\r\n\r\n    'I succeeded in stopping this, for I felt sure that we should get it\r\n    for nothing, as, in fact, we did.\r\n\r\n    'That we obtained most-favoured-nation treatment without giving way\r\n    upon our wine duties and sacrificing revenue was a triumph, as we got\r\n    all the reductions (which on yarns were very large) which we had\r\n    obtained in the course of the negotiations. These had, after being won\r\n    by us, been given to the Swiss and Belgians--who were \"behind\" us, and\r\n    signed treaties. The result was that there was an increase, not a\r\n    falling off, in our trade with France.' [Footnote: Full information\r\n    with regard to the negotiations of a new commercial treaty between\r\n    France and Great Britain, will be found in Commercial No. 37, 1881,\r\n    and Commercial No. 9, 1882.]\r\n\r\n\"The foresight shown by Sir Charles Dilke in proposing this arrangement is\r\nbrought out by the fact that it has been maintained, and given entire\r\nsatisfaction, during the thirty years and more which have elapsed from its\r\nconclusion,\" says Sir Henry Austin Lee.\r\n\r\nM. Hanotaux, in his _France Contemporaine_, observes that Dilke was often\r\na _précurseur_. He certainly was so in an important matter of Imperial\r\npolicy which connects itself with these negotiations. Leave was granted,\r\nthrough Sir Charles at the Foreign Office, to the Canadian High\r\nCommissioner, Sir A. Galt, 'to negotiate upon his own account, provided\r\nthat he concluded no stipulations unfavourable to the mother country. In\r\nthis, I made a precedent which has been followed,' and which was not made\r\nwithout opposition. The Colonial Office, while unable to prevent Canada\r\nfrom acting for herself, prevented Sir Charles at the Foreign Office from\r\nacting conjointly with Canada. The matter developed in 'the following\r\nspring':\r\n\r\n    'On March 1st (1882) Sir A. Galt asked me to let Kennedy' (Sir C. M.\r\n    Kennedy) 'of the Foreign Office go to Paris as Second Commissioner for\r\n    Canada to help make a Franco-Canadian treaty. On the 2nd I agreed, and\r\n    got Lord Granville's consent, and the Foreign Office officially asked\r\n    the Colonial Office, when Lord Kimberley refused. I pressed the matter\r\n    in angry, but as I think conclusive, minutest Lord Kimberley, however,\r\n    set his teeth, and refused point blank, and Lord Granville then backed\r\n    him up, saying that \"on a Colonial matter it was impossible to fly in\r\n    the face of the Colonial Secretary of State.\" I wrote, 2nd March,\r\n    1882:\r\n\r\n    '\"I think Lord Kimberley's decision a great misfortune to British\r\n    trade and to friendly relations with the Colonies, and wish this\r\n    minute and opinion to that effect placed on record with the despatch\r\n    which he wishes to withdraw. We could have stipulated that the mother\r\n    country should have been entitled to all reductions made to France, a\r\n    further advantage which, if Canada is angry at the refusal, may be\r\n    needed but not obtained.\"'\r\n\r\n    'April 20th, 1882: At this moment I called attention to the bearing of\r\n    our most-favoured-nation-clause treaties on the commercial condition\r\n    of the British Empire generally, and pointed out that the bearing of\r\n    the matter on the Colonies would become very important some day; and I\r\n    found even too much support from the head of the Trade Department, who\r\n    was a Protectionist, or at least a strong Reciprocitarian, and who at\r\n    once grasped my idea by arguing that there was a chance that some day\r\n    there would be formed a British Zollverein, raising discriminating\r\n    duties upon foreign produce as against that of the British Empire. I\r\n    had only pointed out the possibility. The representation of Canada by\r\n    Sir A. Galt at Paris also provoked minutes by me on this question\r\n    later in the year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nGAMBETTA, DISRAELI, ROYAL PERSONAGES, MORIER\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe New Year of 1881 had opened for Sir Charles with Gambetta's greetings:\r\n\r\n    \"Chambre des Députés.\r\n\r\n    \"CHER AMI,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Je vous envoie mes voeux les plus ardents pour tous les succès que\r\n    vous pouvez désirer dans cette année qui s'ouvre, et pour la\r\n    réalisation desquels j'ai confiance que votre bon génie continuera à\r\n    vous sourire.\r\n\r\n    \"Quand vous passerez a Paris le 4 ou autre jour venez me voir. Je ne\r\n    bouge d'ici jusqu'au 20.\r\n\r\n    \"Je vous embrasse et vous aime,\r\n    \"Paris, 1 _Janvier_, 1881.\"\r\n\r\n    \"L. GAMBETTA.\r\n\r\nWhen they met, the Ferry Ministry was in office. Sir Charles met 'General\r\nFarre, the Minister of War, who has left no name except for having\r\nabolished drums, which were shortly afterwards reintroduced, and who, so\r\nfar as I could see, did not deserve to leave one,' and also Ranc, one of\r\nGambetta's satellites, who 'was entertaining with a description of the\r\nvarious anarchical parties in Paris then engaged in sitting \"on each\r\nother's ruins.\"' A story which Sir Charles tells of his crossing to Paris\r\n(in the end of August, 1881) illustrates the vehemence of prejudice\r\nagainst Gambetta:\r\n\r\n    'I had made the journey alone in a compartment with the young Comte de\r\n    FitzJames, who was a Lieutenant in the army. He did not know me, and\r\n    assured me that, it being Gambetta's custom while President of the\r\n    Chamber to ask to breakfast each day the officer of the guard, if he\r\n    ever happened to be on duty at the Palais Bourbon, and, consequently,\r\n    were asked, and had to go, he should utter not one word.'\r\n\r\nGambetta, who heard the story, was greatly amused by it.\r\n\r\nDuring part of September and part of October, 1881, the friends did not\r\nmeet, because Gambetta was away from Paris. 'It was rumoured he had been\r\nto see Bismarck, which was untrue,' says Dilke. \"But,\" he adds in a letter\r\nto Lord Granville on October 24th, \"Gambetta visited Memel and Kiel, and\r\nsaw the German fleet, of which he does not think much.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales were in Paris when Sir Charles returned\r\nthere to resume commercial negotiations. On October 24th he breakfasted\r\nwith them at their hotel, and met them again on the 28th, when they\r\nlunched with the Austrian Ambassador:\r\n\r\n    'Beust is a man that I never saw without marvelling how he should have\r\n    played so great a part in the affairs of Europe. He always reminded me\r\n    of Lord Granville with the brains left out. The same little jokes,\r\n    though less good, the same smile, the same courteous manner; but an\r\n    affectation and a real stupidity which were all his own.'\r\n\r\n    'I went in the afternoon with the Prince and Princess of Wales to see\r\n    Munkacsy's \"Christ,\" an enormously overrated picture, in which the\r\n    chief figure was that of an Austrian village idiot, not a Christ, but\r\n    the half-revolutionist, half-idiot that Christ was to the Jews who\r\n    crucified Him, and who formed the crowd in the picture. If that was\r\n    what the man wanted to paint, he had succeeded, but that probably was\r\n    not what he wanted.'\r\n\r\n    'The Prince was most anxious to meet Gambetta again; Gambetta not at\r\n    all anxious to meet him. But the Prince having distinctly asked me to\r\n    ask him to breakfast, and to ask Gambetta to meet him, the latter was\r\n    obliged to come. The Prince, however, having asked me to invite\r\n    Galliffet as one of the guests, Gambetta, who liked Galliffet\r\n    personally, but was afraid of being attacked in the Press, absolutely\r\n    refused to come, so Galliffet had to be knocked off the list again.\r\n    Galliffet has misrepresented this in his Memoirs.'\r\n\r\nThis breakfast took place on Sunday, October 30th, and made much talk,\r\nthough the Prince was officially travelling as a private gentleman, an\r\nincognito which the waiters had difficulty in remembering. Mr. Austin Lee\r\nhad been invited to take the place of General Galliffet in the party of\r\nsix, which was completed by Mr. Knollys and Colonel Stanley Clarke. The\r\nplace was known as the Moulin Rouge Restaurant, soon to disappear in the\r\nrebuilding of the Avenue d'Antin. It is said to have been kept open for\r\nsome days beyond the date originally fixed, to furnish a _déjeûner_ worthy\r\nof these guests. In spite of the privacy observed, Rumour was busy, and\r\n_Punch_ of November 12th appeared with an amusing \"Monologue du Garçon,\"\r\ngiving at great length the supposed conversation and the menu of the\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n    'Gambetta said a great many good things. He called Blowitz a \"crapaud\r\n    de Bohème,\" which Escott afterwards quoted from me in the _World_, I\r\n    think. He said, apropos of the then French Government: \"To change a\r\n    policy you must have a policy, just as to change a shirt you must have\r\n    a shirt.\" Gambetta told me that he wished to make Tissot Foreign\r\n    Minister, and that as he intended to take Chanzy from St. Petersburg,\r\n    he should have three Ambassadors to find. Gambetta was satirical about\r\n    Ireland. He said, referring to Mr. Gladstone's speech: \"Everything is\r\n    going on admirably in Ireland, it seems. You have thirty thousand\r\n    lawsuits under your new Land Act. Excellent!\"'\r\n\r\nThe Prince returned to London next day, and sent to Sir Charles through\r\nMr. Knollys an expression of thanks and a request that Gambetta would send\r\nhim a signed photograph. The request was duly transmitted, and Gambetta\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n    \"CHER AMI,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Pensez-vous que ceci soit acceptable? Si oui, pas de réponse; si non,\r\n    dites-moi s'il suffit d'une simple signature comme autographe.\r\n\r\n    \"À vous,\r\n\r\n    \"L. GAMBETTA.\"\r\n\r\nThe inscription was: \"Au plus aimable des princes--un ami de\r\nl'Angleterre.\"\r\n\r\nFour months later the Prince of Wales wrote to Dilke expressing his\r\npersonal regrets for Gambetta's fall from power, and Gambetta's letter in\r\nreply was sent to Sir Charles for transmission on March 6th, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe Ferry Ministry fell on November 10th, 1881, and the thought of\r\nGambetta in power acted, said Bismarck, on the nerves of Europe \"like a\r\ndrum in a sick man's room.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 1st\r\n\r\n    'I heard from Lord Lyons, and gathered from confidential telegrams,\r\n    that the idea of disarmament was in the air again in Europe. This, of\r\n    course, really meant a disarmament to be imposed by the Empires and\r\n    Italy upon France. But it was stopped again, as it had often been\r\n    stopped before, by Russia.\r\n\r\n    'I had told Lord Granville that I thought Gambetta would offer the\r\n    Embassy in London to Ferry, and that I did not know if the Queen would\r\n    like his marriage being only a civil one, and that the Roman Catholics\r\n    in England would certainly make it disagreeable for him. Lord\r\n    Granville wrote on this: \"I am glad to be rid of Challemel-Lacour. He\r\n    must be a clumsy fellow to have got on such bad terms with both Saint-\r\n    Hilaire and Gambetta.\" In the following week, however, Gambetta made\r\n    up his mind that J. Casimir-Périer should become his Ambassador in\r\n    London. But Gambetta fell before he had been able to give him the\r\n    place.\r\n\r\n    'On the night before I left I dined with Pouyer-Quertier, who had been\r\n    Finance Minister of France under Thiers at the time of the Frankfort\r\n    Treaty. He told me a wonderful story about how, when the negotiations\r\n    had been all but broken off, he went to bed in despair. But in the\r\n    morning before light there was a knock at his door. He got up in his\r\n    nightshirt, and there was Bismarck in full uniform, who made him get\r\n    back into bed, saying he would catch cold. Then, drawing a chair to\r\n    the bedside, Bismarck spread out the treaty on the night-table and\r\n    wrangled on, till after a while he said that it was dry work, and got\r\n    up and rang and asked for beer. After the beer had been brought by a\r\n    sleepy waiter, he rang again and asked for kirsch, and poured a\r\n    quantity of the liqueur into the beer. Then he made the poker red-hot\r\n    in the fire which he had relighted, stirred up the mixture, and\r\n    invited Pouyer-Quertier to drink. Pouyer-Quertier said: \"I drank it\r\n    thinking of my country, and Bismarck clapped me on the back, and said\r\n    that I was such a good fellow that the evacuation should take place at\r\n    once, and this is how the final article was signed; it was signed on\r\n    the table at my bedside.\" I did not believe the story, but when I\r\n    asked Bismarck years later he said that it was true.'\r\n\r\nReturning to London on November 5th\r\n\r\n    'I left Paris at a moment of great excitement over the financial\r\n    situation, there having been a kind of Roman Catholic financial union\r\n    which had beaten a Jewish ring, and which afterwards itself collapsed.\r\n    It was said that James de Rothschild had lost his money in this\r\n    business; but his brother-in-law told me that ... it was not true that\r\n    he had lost a sixpence.'\r\n\r\nOn November 19th Sir Charles left London, and saw Rouvier and Gambetta\r\nlate that evening in Paris. 'The Gambetta Ministry had been formed, and it\r\nwas thought important that I should see Rouvier at once.' Next day, Sunday\r\nthe 20th, he 'breakfasted with Gambetta, meeting Spuller and General\r\nBillot.' To the latter he had been introduced by Gambetta in January,\r\n1880, when Billot was 'commanding the Marseille Corps d'Armée: an\r\nintriguer who, in the event of war occurring between 1887 and 1890, would\r\nhave been second-in-command of the armies of France.' [Footnote: \"A letter\r\nto a friend of this date shows that Sir Charles did not think Gambetta's\r\nMinistry was likely to be in a strong position when it came into power:\r\n\r\n    \"FOREIGN OFFICE,\r\n    \"PARIS,\r\n    \"21st November, 1881.\r\n\r\n    \"Gambetta is, according to the papers, at war with the Senate and with\r\n    the Church. I think that he is at war with the Senate, and that this\r\n    is foolish of him. I don't think he is at war with the Church. It is\r\n    the Senate, more than the Church, which is offended by the appointment\r\n    of a rampant atheist and vivisector as Minister of Religion. The\r\n    Church has probably less to fear from Bert than from less known men.\r\n    Gambetta is to see the Nuncio to-day, and I don't think that the\r\n    Nuncio, who has long been his warm personal friend, is likely to\r\n    express much alarm.\r\n\r\n    \"The Senate is more serious. The monstrous folly of Bert's\r\n    appointment, the dismissal of the senator de Normandie, governor of\r\n    the Bank, and the putting only one senator into the Cabinet, have\r\n    irritated it beyond all bearing. Gambetta may gain twenty seats in\r\n    January, but even supposing that he is supposed to have a majority in\r\n    the Senate, it is a majority in which you have to count semi-\r\n    Conservative rivals such as Leon Say and de Freycinet, foes like\r\n    Challemel-Lacour, and men of the extreme Left like Victor Hugo, who\r\n    are more likely to follow Clémenceau than Gambetta. And yet he needs\r\n    the Senate to keep the other House in order by the threat of a\r\n    dissolution, which requires the consent of the Senate.\"]\r\n\r\nGambetta had taken the Foreign Office himself:\r\n\r\n    'He seemed to me solid, strong, and prudent. Indeed, I never saw him\r\n    appear to so much advantage. We walked from his \"den\" to the dining-\r\n    room, where the guests were waiting for breakfast, through his\r\n    bedroom. A fine Louis XVI. bed from the _garde-meuble_ was in the\r\n    alcove. I pointed, and asked: \"Le lit de Talleyrand?\" \"Le lit de\r\n    Dagobert!\" At our meeting on the 20th we discussed fully the Danube\r\n    question, and also that of Newfoundland, in which I always took a deep\r\n    interest, but with regard to which I was far from agreement with the\r\n    French. [Footnote: The Danube question was left unsettled by the\r\n    Treaty of Berlin. The question of the navigation and outlets gave rise\r\n    to constant trouble, owing to the claims of Russia and Austria-\r\n    Hungary. After prolonged negotiations the Conference of 1883 arrived\r\n    at a compromise. See _Life of Granville._ vol. ii., chap, vii., Lord\r\n    Granville's despatch, March 14th, Turkey, No. 3, 1883.]\r\n\r\n    'During the whole of this visit to Paris I deeply admired Gambetta,\r\n    with whom I spent almost the whole of my three days. He showed to\r\n    great advantage, sobered by power, rapid in his acquisition and\r\n    mastery of new subjects. He had grasped the Danube difficulties and\r\n    those of Newfoundland in a moment. How different from those about him,\r\n    of whom Spuller, of all men in the world, was one day to be his\r\n    successor--a heavy fellow, who, as long as Gambetta lived, used only\r\n    to open his mouth for the purpose of \"thee-and-thouing\" Gambetta in\r\n    asking for the salt, just to show that he dared to \"thee\" and \"thou\"\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    'On December 28th I breakfasted with Gambetta, when he told me that he\r\n    would himself have given Jules Simon any Embassy or any place in his\r\n    Government, for he was fit for any (\"the cleverest man in France\"),\r\n    had he not known that Simon was too bitter, and would think that he\r\n    was being bought, and would refuse. Freycinet was at Gambetta's, and\r\n    also Spuller, Rouvier, Ranc, Pallain, Reinach, and Gerard. They were\r\n    much excited as to the selection by Gambetta of Weiss of the _Figaro_\r\n    as Secretary in the Foreign Office' (in place of Baron de Courcel),\r\n    'as Weiss was said to have made the anti-Republican Government of May\r\n    16th; but Gambetta merely answered that he could not see why he should\r\n    not be allowed to employ as a despatch writer \"the first pen of\r\n    France.\" The same difficulty had arisen about the army, Gambetta\r\n    wishing to make Miribel Chief of the Staff, although he was a\r\n    reactionary. This appointment was afterwards made by Freycinet in\r\n    1890, amid public applause, although the suggestion had been one of\r\n    the causes of Gambetta's overthrow....\r\n\r\n    'Gambetta says that the American despatches to us about Panama raise a\r\n    monstrous pretension--that they might as well claim the Straits of\r\n    Magellan and Cape Horn'. [Footnote: The Americans had announced that\r\n    in the event of the completion of the Canal they intended to keep it\r\n    in their own hands.]\r\n\r\nOn December 29th Sir Charles dined with Lord Lyons to meet Gambetta and\r\nsome of the new Ministers:\r\n\r\n    'On this evening I heard Gambetta for the first time say \"If I can,\"\r\n    for he was beginning to feel how sharply limited by the hostility of\r\n    the Chamber was his power. He was speaking of revision of the\r\n    constitution for the purpose of the adoption of _scrutin de liste_.'\r\n    [Footnote: Sir Henry Brackenbury, in _Some Memories of My Spare Time_,\r\n    observes that in 1881 he dined at the Embassy, when \"Gambetta and M.\r\n    Spullor, his _fidus Achates_, were also present, as well as Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke.\" He thought Dilke \"by far the best talker of the\r\n    party.\"]\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd, 1882, he again breakfasted with Gambetta.\r\n\r\n    'Gambetta told me that the Chamber would never forgive him for having\r\n    suggested _scrutin de liste_, and hated him. At the same time he\r\n    informed me of his intention of again proposing it, although he\r\n    expected to be beaten, and seemed to have made up his mind to go out.'\r\n\r\nWriting to Grant Duff of this coming conflict, Dilke said:\r\n\r\n    \"Gambetta means to put _scrutin de liste_ into the constitution at the\r\n    revision--_if he can_. That will be a warm day! I never heard him say\r\n    'If I can' before. I wonder if his great exemplar ever said 'If I\r\n    can'? Sala and Rosebery, who are the two best Napoleonists I know, can\r\n    tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSir Charles, as representing the Foreign Office in the House of Commons,\r\nwas naturally in close touch with Mr. Gladstone; in addition, the\r\ncommercial negotiations necessitated frequent interviews. The admiration\r\nwhich Sir Charles felt for his chief was, however, frequently crossed by\r\ndifferences of opinion, especially as to his method of approaching foreign\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n    'Writing to express his concurrence in my action with regard to the\r\n    commercial negotiations, Mr. Gladstone went on to say: \"I am glad\r\n    Gambetta says that he is in the same boat as us as to Panama. Our\r\n    safety there will be in acting as charged with the interests of the\r\n    world minus America.\" This was a curious example of the world of\r\n    illusions in which Mr. Gladstone lives. The Americans had informed us\r\n    that they did not intend to be any longer bound by the Clayton-Bulwer\r\n    Treaty, and that in the event of the completion of the Panama Canal\r\n    they intended virtually to keep it in their own hands. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    called in France in joint protest with us against this view, although\r\n    he might have foreseen the utter impossibility in the long-run of\r\n    resisting American pretensions on such a point, and although he\r\n    himself would have been the first, when the Americans threatened war\r\n    (as they would have done later on), to yield to threats that which he\r\n    would not yield to argument. It amused Harcourt, however, to concoct\r\n    with the Chancellor and the Foreign Office portentous despatches to\r\n    Mr. Blaine, in which we lectured the Americans on the permanency of\r\n    their obligations. How childish it all was! Moreover, the Monroe\r\n    doctrine suits our interests.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's letters to Mr. Gladstone, even when short and business-like,\r\nare marked by a deference which he used to no one else; and the deference\r\nat times has the accent of affection. Sir Charles always enjoyed Mr.\r\nGladstone's old-world courtesy, and especially his playfulness.\r\n\r\n    \"It would be impossible,\" he said, \"to give a true account of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone without recalling the manner in which, however absorbed he\r\n    might be in his subject, he would break off to discuss some amusing\r\n    triviality. When we were talking once of the real and inner views of\r\n    French statesmen with regard to our occupation of Egypt, some chance\r\n    expression suddenly diverted Mr. Gladstone's mind to the subject of\r\n    rowing; and he began recalling in the most amusing way incidents of\r\n    his own Eton days of some sixty-eight or sixty-nine years previously,\r\n    shivering at the thought of his sculling in cold weather against\r\n    strong stretches of the stream near Monkey Island.\"\r\n\r\nBut the elder statesman who fascinated Sir Charles's imagination was the\r\ngreat Tory chief; and in 1881 came at last the realization of a wish long\r\nentertained by him for a meeting with Lord Beaconsfield. More than once he\r\nhad been balked of the opportunity by his punctilio of holding rigidly to\r\neven the most ordinary social engagements. After one of these\r\ndisappointments he wrote:\r\n\r\n    'I should like to talk to the most romantic character of our time, but\r\n    I fear it is only vulgar curiosity, for I really know a great deal\r\n    more already about him than I could find out in conversation.'\r\n\r\nThe curiosity had been sharpened by the publication of _Endymion_, for Sir\r\nCharles thought that in devising the story of Endymion Ferrars Lord\r\nBeaconsfield had taken a general suggestion from the career of the Radical\r\nwho, like Endymion, had made his debut as Under-Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs; and the novelist admitted the debt.\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place on Sunday, January 30th, at Lady Lonsdale's house.\r\n\r\n    'Wolff, Chaplin and Lady Florence, Hartington, the Duchess of\r\n    Manchester, Lord and Lady Hamilton, and Captain and Lady Rosamond\r\n    Fellowes (Randolph Churchill's sister) were there. Arthur Balfour and\r\n    the Randolph Churchills came in after dinner. Lord Beaconsfield told\r\n    me that he had been very anxious to meet me, since he had taken the\r\n    liberty of writing about me without my leave in his novel _Endymion_,\r\n    and that he thought we wore never destined to meet, for he had twice\r\n    asked Alfred de Rothschild to invite me, and that I had not \"been\" on\r\n    those two or on a third occasion which he had made. He was, as usual,\r\n    over-complimentary and over-anxious to captivate, but was certainly\r\n    most pleasant. He praised my grandfather, a sure way to my heart, and\r\n    said that my grandfather and his own father were \"the last two men in\r\n    England who had a thorough knowledge of English letters.\" The talk at\r\n    dinner was dull, in spite of Wolff's attempts to enliven it, but\r\n    Arthur Balfour and the Randolph Churchills brightened it afterwards,\r\n    and Dizzy said a good many rather good things--as, for example, that\r\n    he should like to get married again for the purpose of comparing the\r\n    presents that he would get from his friends with the beggarly ones\r\n    that he had got when he had married. Also that he \"objects to the\r\n    rigid bounds of honeymoons as an arbitrary attempt to limit\r\n    illimitable happiness.\" I thought him very polite and pretty in all\r\n    his ways and in all he said.'\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening, February 20th, Sir Charles dined with Mr. Alfred de\r\nRothschild to meet the Prince of Wales;\r\n\r\n    'but was more pleased with again meeting Lord Beaconsfield.'...\r\n\r\n    'After dinner I was next him. When he was offered a cigar, he said:\r\n    \"You English once had a great man who discovered tobacco, on which you\r\n    English now live, and potatoes, on which your Irish live, and you cut\r\n    off his head.\" This foreign point of view of Sir Walter Raleigh was\r\n    extremely comical, I think.'\r\n\r\nFinally there is this entry:\r\n\r\n    'Having made no note in my diary, I cannot tell if it was on Sunday,\r\n    April 3rd, or on Sunday, March 27th, that Lord Barrington met Edmond\r\n    Fitzmaurice and me in Curzon Street, where Lord Beaconsfield's house\r\n    was, and said: \"Come in and see him; he's ill, but would like to see\r\n    you.\" He was on a couch in the back drawing-room, in which he died, I\r\n    think, on April 19th. There was a bronchitis kettle on the hob, and\r\n    his breathing was difficult, but he was still the old Disraeli, and,\r\n    though I think that he knew that he was dying, yet his pleasant\r\n    spitefulness about \"Mr. G.\" was not abated. He meant to die game.'\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield made no secret of his liking for Sir Charles, but is\r\nsaid to have doubted the permanency of his Radicalism. \"The sort of man\r\nwho will die a Conservative peer,\" is said to have been his commentary\r\nafter their first meeting, echoing an idea then widespread in the\r\nfashionable world, that of the two men so often compared, Sir Charles\r\nwould gravitate towards the opinions of the _Times_, leaving his colleague\r\n'to the unassisted championship of democratic rights.'\r\n\r\nTo the greatest of all European statesmen Dilke did not at this time\r\nbecome known; but Bismarck watched his career, and in the early part of\r\nthis year, after the Prince of Wales's visit to Berlin,\r\n\r\n    'On March 16th Arthur Ellis, who had been with the Prince at Berlin,\r\n    came to me from the Prince to say that the Prince had had much talk\r\n    with Lord Ampthill (Odo Russell) about me. Our Ambassador was most\r\n    anxious that I should visit Berlin, and thought that I could do much\r\n    then with Bismarck, and usefully remove prejudices about myself at the\r\n    Court. Ellis was the bearer of an invitation from the Embassy for me\r\n    to stay there, and of a message that Bismarck much wished to make my\r\n    acquaintance.'\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to the attractiveness of the invitation, but it was\r\nat once ruled out on public grounds.\r\n\r\n    'The visit, however, would give rise to much speculation in the Press,\r\n    and would also make the Queen angry and Mr. Gladstone most uneasy.\r\n    \"But,\" I added in my diary, \"if we want to stop the French from going\r\n    to Tunis, there is a safe and easy way to do it--_i.e.,_ let me go to\r\n    Berlin for one day and see Bismarck and talk about the weather, and\r\n    then to Rome for one hour and see, no one, merely to let the fact get\r\n    into the newspapers.\"'\r\n\r\nIn December\r\n\r\n    'Dufferin wrote to me from Paris: \"The Sultan is besotted with the\r\n    notion of a German alliance against France, and of obtaining the\r\n    assistance of Germany in freeing himself from foreign control in\r\n    Asia.\"'\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, 1882, Sir Charles, while accompanying Lord Lyons on his\r\nround of official New Year visits, saw a despatch from Lord Odo Russell.\r\n[Footnote: Ambassador at Berlin.] In it Bismarck described his attitude\r\ntowards the Turks, who had \"asked him for protection against their\r\nprotectors, who, with the sole exception of Germany, in their opinion,\r\nwanted 'to cut slices out of their skin.'\" Bismarck had assured the Turks\r\nthat he should never attack France unless seriously threatened by France,\r\nand would never in any circumstances \"fire a cartridge for Turkey.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the summer of 1881 Sir Charles had become acquainted with\r\na great personage in whom Bismarck always saw an enemy of his policy, and\r\nin so far as it was hostile to France the Memoir bears out his judgment.\r\n\r\n    'On July 13th the Prince of Wales introduced me to his sister, the\r\n    Crown Princess of Germany. [Footnote: Though this was Sir Charles's\r\n    first meeting with the Crown Princess, she had at the time of his\r\n    father's death 'telegraphed her condolences to me at St. Petersburg,\r\n    and to the Embassy, asking them to call on me and help me in the\r\n    matter.'] She talked to me at length in the most friendly way with\r\n    regard to France and Gambetta. She told me that she had been secretly\r\n    to Cherbourg to hear Gambetta's famous speech, which he himself called\r\n    \"the first glass of wine administered to the convalescent.\" But she\r\n    added that she stood absolutely alone in Germany in her pro-French\r\n    opinions.\r\n\r\n    'The Crown Princess seemed very able, but inclined to sacrifice\r\n    anything in order to produce an effect. I was afterwards sent for by\r\n    them, and had a long talk in what are called the Belgian Rooms at the\r\n    back of Buckingham Palace, on the gardens.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, August 22nd, I called at Buckingham Palace by the wish of\r\n    the Crown Prince, and saw him and the Crown Princess together. I\r\n    thought him a dull, heavy German, and noted in my diary: \"He dare not\r\n    speak before he sees that she approves of his speaking.\" But he was a\r\n    nice-minded, kind, and even pleasant man in his way.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's formal summing-up of his impressions is to be found in his\r\nwork on _The Present Position of European Politics_ (1887):\r\n\r\n    \"It is no secret that at times the Crown Princess has been unfriendly\r\n    to Prince Bismarck. They are perhaps two personalities too strong to\r\n    coexist easily in the same Court.... The Crown Prince, it must be\r\n    admitted, intellectually speaking, is, largely by his own will, the\r\n    Crown Princess. But that most able lady, when she shares the German\r\n    throne, must inevitably have for her policy the Bismarck policy--the\r\n    strength and glory of the German Empire.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes that, although he was hard-worked in Parliament and in\r\nthe Office, the peculiar nature of the Foreign Office work brought him\r\nnecessarily a good deal into contact with royal personages and foreigners\r\nof distinction visiting London, and forced him 'to go out a good deal and\r\nburn the candle at both ends.' Of these official gaieties he gives no very\r\ngrateful impression:\r\n\r\n    'Some of the parties to which the Prince of Wales virtually insisted\r\n    that I should go were curious; the oddest of them a supper which he\r\n    directed to be given on July 1st, 1881, for Sarah Bernhardt, at the\r\n    wish of the Duc d'Aumale, and at which all the other ladies present\r\n    were English ladies who had been invited at the distinct request of\r\n    the Prince of Wales. It was one thing to get them to go, and another\r\n    thing to get them to talk when they were there; and the result was\r\n    that, as they would not talk to Sarah Bernhardt and she would not talk\r\n    to them, and as the Duc d'Aumale was deaf and disinclined to make\r\n    conversation on his own account, nobody talked at all, and an absolute\r\n    reign of the most dismal silence ensued....\r\n\r\n    'On March 13th we had received news of the murder of the Emperor of\r\n    Russia; and when Lord Granville came to dinner with me (for he dined\r\n    with me that night to meet the French Ambassador), he told me that I\r\n    must attend in the morning at a Mass at the Russian Chapel, and attend\r\n    in uniform. I had two of these Masses at the Russian Chapel in a short\r\n    time, one for the Emperor and one for the Empress, and painful\r\n    ceremonies they were, as we had to stand packed like herrings in a\r\n    small room, stifled with incense, wearing heavy uniform, and carrying\r\n    lighted tapers in our hands. On this occasion I saw the Prince of\r\n    Wales go to sleep standing, his taper gradually turn round and gutter\r\n    on the floor.'\r\n\r\nTwo months later, Friday, May 27th,\r\n\r\n    'I dined with Lord and Lady Spencer to meet the King of Sweden and the\r\n    Gladstones....\r\n\r\n    'The King talked to me after dinner about the murder of the Emperor of\r\n    Russia.... It was clear that the Swedish loathing for Russia on\r\n    account of the loss of Finland was not over. The King might, however,\r\n    have reflected upon his own popularity in Norway, a country which had\r\n    been given to his grandfather because the people used to hate the\r\n    Danes. They now hated the Swedes still more.'\r\n\r\nA royalty known to Sir Charles by correspondence was King Mtsa of Uganda,\r\n'who had been presented by us in 1880, at the request of the Queen and the\r\nChurch Missionary Society, with a Court suit, a trombone, and an Arabic\r\nBible,' but who relapsed early in 1881, and became again the chief pillar\r\nof the slave trade in his district. Another strange monarch played his\r\npart that year in London society.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, July 10th, Lord Granville wrote to me to ask me to lunch\r\n    with him the next day to meet \"the King of the Cannibal Islands\r\n    [Footnote: Sandwich Islands, in reality.] at 12.55, an admirable\r\n    arrangement, as he must go away to Windsor at 1.20.\" I went, but\r\n    unfortunately was not able to clear myself of all responsibility for\r\n    Kalakaua so rapidly, for I was directed to show him the House of\r\n    Commons; and when he parted from me in the evening in St. Stephen's\r\n    Hall he asked me for a cigar, and on my offering him my case he put\r\n    the whole of its contents into his pocket. The Crown Prince of Germany\r\n    and the Crown Princess (Princess Royal of England) were in London at\r\n    the same time, and at all the parties the three met. The German\r\n    Embassy were most indignant that the Prince of Wales had decided that\r\n    Kalakaua must go before the Crown Prince. At a party given by Lady\r\n    Spencer at the South Kensington Museum, Kalakaua marched along with\r\n    the Princess of Wales, the Crown Prince of Germany following humbly\r\n    behind; and at the Marlborough House Ball Kalakaua opened the first\r\n    quadrille with the Princess of Wales. When the Germans remonstrated\r\n    with the Prince, he replied, \"Either the brute is a King or else he is\r\n    an ordinary black nigger, and if he is not a King, why is he here at\r\n    all?\" which made further discussion impossible. Kalakaua, however,\r\n    having only about 40,000 nominal subjects, most of them American\r\n    citizens who got up a revolution every time he went away, his kingship\r\n    was very slight.'\r\n\r\nMay 20th:\r\n\r\n    'At this Cabinet a curious matter came up, though not for decision.\r\n    The Cabinet had been intending to give the commission for the public\r\n    statue of Lord Beaconsfield to a British sculptor, and I had been\r\n    trying hard to get it for Nelson Maclean; but a communication from the\r\n    Queen settled the matter, she absolutely insisting that Boehm should\r\n    do the statue. Everybody felt that it was wrong that she should\r\n    interfere, but nobody, of course, resisted.'\r\n\r\nOn May 27th we hear that the Queen, having received\r\n\r\n    'warning in an anonymous letter of threats against her life by\r\n    \"persons of rank,\" wrote to Harcourt to say she did not see who could\r\n    be meant \"unless it were Lord Randolph Churchill\"!'\r\n\r\nElsewhere Sir Charles noted:\r\n\r\n    'The only subjects upon which the Prince of Wales agreed with any\r\n    Liberals were (1) detestation of Randolph Churchill; (2) the\r\n    government of London. But then, as I personally, although assailed by\r\n    Randolph Churchill and not then on speaking terms in consequence, did\r\n    not dislike him, there remained only the government of London, and the\r\n    topic became well worn between us, for we had found by experience that\r\n    it was the only one upon which we could safely talk.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nOne correspondent, the length of whose letters was 'fabulous,' was Sir\r\nRobert Morier, then Minister at Lisbon, 'an old friend.'\r\n\r\n    'He had more brains than all the other Foreign Office servants put\r\n    together (excepting Lord Lyons and 'old White' and Lord Odo Russell),\r\n    but, although \"impossible\" in a small place, he was afterwards a\r\n    success at St. Petersburg.... He used to send ultimatums to any weak\r\n    Government to which he was despatched, and he used to treat the\r\n    Foreign Office almost as badly, for he was the only Minister given to\r\n    swearing at the Office in despatches.'\r\n\r\nComment on this is afforded by a note of Lord Granville's to Sir Charles\r\nin 1884, when the Embassy at Constantinople was vacant: \"The Turks had\r\nbeen behaving so badly, we should send Morier, to pay them out.\" Sir\r\nCharles's respect for his friend's 'immense ability' led to his taking\r\ngreat trouble in dealing with Sir Robert Morier's difficulties, put before\r\nhim in a voluminous correspondence, both private and public, and in return\r\nhe received 'a veritable testimonial on February 22nd, 1881: \"You have\r\ndone the right thing at exactly the right moment, and this is to me so\r\nutterly new a phenomenon in official life that it fills me with admiration\r\nand delight.\"' He had previously noted a letter in which, describing\r\nhimself as \"a shipwrecked diplomat on the rocks of Lisbon,\" Morier wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"To have for once in my life received help, co-operation, and\r\n    encouragement in a public work from a man _in the Office_, instead of\r\n    the cuffs and snubs I am used to, is so altogether new a sensation\r\n    that you must excuse my being gushing.\"\r\n\r\nIn an earlier letter of the same year there is complaint of the \"utter\r\nabsence of co-operation\" between the Foreign Office at home and its\r\nservants abroad:\r\n\r\n    \"You who are still a human being and able to see things from the\r\n    general home point of view, will be over-weighted by two such\r\n    bureaucrats as ---- and ---- .\"\r\n\r\nMorier's plea for reorganization which should ensure \"intercommunion and\r\nintercommunication\" was emphasized a few weeks later by\r\n\r\n    'a letter from White, then our Minister at Bucharest (afterwards our\r\n    Ambassador at Constantinople), which concluded with a general grumble\r\n    against the Foreign Office:\r\n\r\n    '\"... Servants kept in the dark--thorough darkness--as to proceedings\r\n    in the next-door house cannot be profitable servants, and such is,\r\n    alas!\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours ever truly,\r\n\r\n    '\"W. A. White.'\"\r\n\r\nThe idea bore fruit in Dilke's mind to this extent, that in\r\n\r\n    '1890 I was able to give evidence before a Royal Commission in favour\r\n    of amalgamating the two services, and the Ridley Commission accepted\r\n    my view and recommended the amalgamation. It was not carried out.'\r\n\r\nSir Robert Morier suffered, in his own judgment, more than anyone else\r\nfrom this lack of intercommunication, and this is probably true because he\r\nwas restlessly fertile in suggestions, and when these raised opposition he\r\nturned to Sir Charles for help. Having just concluded the negotiation of a\r\ntreaty respecting Goa, he was now pressing hard for another respecting\r\nLorenço Marques and Delagoa Bay, in which he discerned the future gate of\r\nthe Transvaal, and was projecting arrangements with regard to Portuguese\r\nWest Africa. In these projects Sir Charles helped him indirectly, as he\r\ndid in a larger proposal which the Minister at Lisbon was making.\r\n\r\n    'Morier's letter contained the draft of a proposed Congo treaty, which\r\n    was afterwards put into shape, which I strongly favoured, and which in\r\n    1883, after I had left the Foreign Office, was virtually stopped by\r\n    the House of Commons. The House and country were wrong, and the\r\n    Foreign Office right.' [Footnote: This treaty would have associated\r\n    Great Britain with Portugal in maintaining the freedom of the Congo\r\n    River and in policing its waters, while it would have established a\r\n    joint control of the whole Congo basin by the European Powers which\r\n    had subjects settled in that region. Such an agreement would have\r\n    altered the course of history in tropical Africa, and the Congo State\r\n    would never have come into being. See _Life of Lord Granville_, vol.\r\n    ii., pp. 341-354.]\r\n\r\nLord Ripon was Sir Charles's regular Indian correspondent, and a letter\r\nfrom the Viceroy in this year begs him not to intermit his communications\r\nwhenever he could make time to write. To Lord Ripon another correspondent\r\nwas now added:\r\n\r\n    'Grant Duff, having accepted the Governorship of Madras, asked me to\r\n    write to him regularly in India, which I promised to do, and did, and\r\n    in thanking me he said that my opinions would have interest for him,\r\n    since among other things I knew was \"that strange wild beast--the\r\n    House of Commons.\" This saying was pathetic from him, for there never\r\n    was a man who more utterly failed to understand the House of Commons\r\n    than Grant Duff....'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES OF THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe close of 1881 virtually terminated the protracted negotiations with\r\nFrance which had occupied most of Sir Charles Dilke's time, and had kept\r\nhim for long periods absent from London. In the new year he was more\r\nclosely concerned with the general business of the Government, and\r\nespecially with its attempts at legislation.\r\n\r\nTwo important subjects mentioned in the Queen's Speech of 1882 were the\r\nreform of local government in the counties, [Footnote: This was\r\nforeshadowed in a note of November 11th, 1881: 'Local Government (Boards\r\nin all the three kingdoms on a tax-paying basis) will be the chief\r\nmeasure.'] and the proposed recasting of London's system of government,\r\nwhich appealed to Sir Charles both as a municipal reformer and as a\r\nmetropolitan member. In the previous summer Mr. Gladstone had shown\r\nhimself to Dilke as 'very keen' on this latter measure, and proposals to\r\nundertake it were actually put before the Cabinet on Lord Mayor's Day,\r\n1881. The choice of a date seemed\r\n\r\n    'dramatic and courageous.... We all dined with the Lord Mayor, and as\r\n    the men came in I felt that, knowing what I did as to Harcourt's\r\n    resolution, we were there under false pretences.'\r\n\r\nThis project began to take shape when Ministers reassembled after\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of January 3rd, 1882, I saw Harcourt about his London\r\n    Government scheme, of which he had sent me a rough sketch asking for\r\n    my criticisms. I found that he had adopted all the ideas of Beal and\r\n    Firth and of myself. [Footnote: Mr. Firth was Sir Charles Dilke's\r\n    fellow-member for Chelsea. Mr. James Beal, a Chelsea man and a veteran\r\n    reformer, was Honorary Secretary of the Metropolitan Municipal\r\n    Association, which existed to advocate the creation of a general\r\n    municipality for London.] We formed a committee, consisting of the\r\n    four, which met daily at Harcourt's house for some time.\r\n\r\n    'On the 6th regular Cabinets began, and Chamberlain came to stay with\r\n    me, although he offered to go to the hotel, \"as there is no crisis on\r\n    hand just now.\" Hartington, who had a shooting party at Hardwick, ...\r\n    scandalized his colleagues by declaring that he was too lazy to come\r\n    up for the first Cabinet, although it had been fixed for between a\r\n    fortnight and three weeks....\r\n\r\n    'On January 7th a Committee of the Cabinet on the London Government\r\n    scheme was appointed, but it met only once, for the informal committee\r\n    of Harcourt, Beal, Firth, and myself did the whole work....\r\n\r\n    'On January 11th the single meeting of the London Government Committee\r\n    took place, Harcourt, Spencer, Childers, Chamberlain, and myself being\r\n    present. But instead of discussing London Government, we discussed the\r\n    Borneo Charter, to which all present were opposed.'\r\n\r\nOver and above this work of preparation on another Minister's Bill, Sir\r\nCharles had a variety of occupations outside his own official duties.\r\nThus, he notes on February 12th that he 'had a quarrel with Dodson' (then\r\nPresident of the Local Government Board) 'as to a rating question'; and a\r\nfew weeks later, on April 28th:\r\n\r\n    'I was very busy at this moment because I had the Corrupt Practices\r\n    Bill and the Ballot Bill on hand in the House, as well as Foreign\r\n    Affairs debates.' [Footnote: In these measures he was helping Sir\r\n    Henry James, Attorney-General.]\r\n\r\nThe main difficulties immediately in hand were those caused by\r\nParliamentary procedure, and Mr. Bradlaugh, who had been re-elected during\r\nthe Recess, and now proposed to take the oath; but the House was unwilling\r\nto let him do so, thus bringing itself into sharp conflict with the\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n    'It was reported by the Prime Minister to the Cabinet of January eth\r\n    that the Queen refused to open Parliament on the ground of health....\r\n    The Queen and Prince Leopold (who was about to marry) had urged that\r\n    an additional allowance to the Prince should be voted before the\r\n    discussions on the forms of the House began; but Mr. Gladstone\r\n    insisted, and the Cabinet decided, that it was to come only after the\r\n    Address, after the Bradlaugh business (upon which the Cabinet felt\r\n    certain that we should be beaten), and after the reform of the\r\n    procedure of the House--that is to say, at Easter at the earliest.'\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bradlaugh presented himself to be sworn, Sir Stafford Northcote\r\nmoved to prohibit his taking the oath. To this motion the Government\r\nopposed a motion for the 'previous question,' and were beaten. Feeling ran\r\nhigh, and the House of Commons as a whole would have endorsed a saying of\r\nLord Winchilsea's. Having been asked to subscribe to the Northampton\r\nHorticultural Show, he replied:\r\n\r\n    '\"A town which enjoys the flowers of Mr. Labouchere's oratory and the\r\n    fruits of Mr. Bradlaugh's philosophy can need no further horticultural\r\n    exhibition.\"...\r\n\r\nNo one quite knew how to deal with the situation which was now created by\r\nMr. Bradlaugh's hurried advance up the floor of the House, when he\r\nadministered the oath to himself.\r\n\r\n    'On February 22nd there was a Cabinet at one o'clock, at which there\r\n    was a tremendous disturbance about Bradlaugh, Chamberlain and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone standing alone against all their colleagues, most of whom,\r\n    under Hartington's lead, had proposed expulsion, and wanted Mr.\r\n    Gladstone himself to move it. While Mr. Gladstone was addressing the\r\n    Cabinet, Harcourt wrote a paper, and got Hartington, Childers, and\r\n    Dodson to sign it. Forster was in Ireland, and Bright was away with a\r\n    cold. Harcourt did not ask Chamberlain to sign his paper, which,\r\n    Chamberlain thought, probably suggested that Mr. Gladstone should\r\n    himself propose some middle course, but Mr. Gladstone turned round\r\n    angrily and hissed through his teeth at Harcourt \"I cannot!\" When the\r\n    time came, even Northcote did not dare to move expulsion, which showed\r\n    how foolish our people must be to long to go further in an anti-\r\n    popular sense than the Tories themselves.'\r\n\r\nThere was also the other question of reform of Parliamentary procedure.\r\n\r\n    'On January 7th the Cabinet discussed the Closure, which was warmly\r\n    supported (in the strongest form) by Harcourt and Chamberlain.\r\n    Hartington walked in in the middle of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n    'On February 1st I had a chat with Manning, who says the Church\r\n    applied the Closure at the Vatican Council to put down the minority\r\n    against the Promulgation of the Doctrine of Infallibility, and that it\r\n    must therefore be a good thing.\r\n\r\n    'On February 9th I was consulted by Harcourt and Chamberlain as to\r\n    what I thought about sticking to Closure in the face of the great\r\n    probability of defeat. I advised making it a question of life and\r\n    death, but advised that if beaten we should immediately prepare for\r\n    dissolution by bringing in the County Franchise Bill, and if the Lords\r\n    threw it out, stop in to carry it. On a vote of confidence the Tories\r\n    could not turn us out, so that we could play the game with them as\r\n    long as necessary to carry County Franchise.\r\n\r\n    'On March 26th we learnt our majority on the power to close debate was\r\n    far from certain, and that on Sir John Lubbock's amendment we very\r\n    probably should be beaten. Mr. Gladstone began to wish to bow before\r\n    the storm, but Chamberlain and others were for holding to our\r\n    proposals at all risks.\r\n\r\n    'On March 31st there was a Cabinet, at which Mr. Gladstone, thinking\r\n    with the Whips that we should be beaten on the Closure, again wished\r\n    to give way. It was decided to make no fresh declaration of standing\r\n    or falling by our rule.'\r\n\r\nThe question of Procedure remained till the Autumn Session, a constant\r\nembarrassment to the Government. But a difficulty, personal to Sir\r\nCharles, and affecting the Government only through him, arose on the Civil\r\nList.\r\n\r\n    'On this day (March 31st) the Queen wrote to Lord Granville to\r\n    complain of my having walked out on the division on the annuity to\r\n    Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and Sir Henry Ponsonby also wrote. I\r\n    refused to give any further explanation, and on April 1st Lord\r\n    Granville wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"HOLMBURY, DORKING.\r\n\r\n    '\"MY DEAR DILKE,--I thought Chamberlain had voted in the majority. The\r\n    Queen appears to me to have a _prima facie_ right to complain of any\r\n    of her servants refusing to support a Government measure which she and\r\n    the administration think necessary for her comfort and position. But\r\n    if you stated to the Prime Minister on taking office that you did not\r\n    intend to vote for these grants, your responsibility ceases.\r\n    Resignation is not in question either with the Queen, yourself, or\r\n    Gladstone. The thing to consider is how to put the matter best in\r\n    answer to Ponsonby's letter. I do not mind the bother in the least.\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    '\"Granville.\"'\r\n\r\nA reply from Sir Charles explained to Lord Granville why Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nname had come in. Although he had voted for the grant\r\n\r\n\"neither he nor I would ever be likely to let the other resign alone. Our\r\nrelations are so close that I should resign with him if he were to resign\r\nbecause he thought Forster did not have his hair cut sufficiently often.\"\r\n\r\nThis explanation was promptly endorsed by Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote on April 2nd two letters, one for me and one for me\r\n    to show to Lord Granville.... In the latter he said:\r\n\r\n    '\"I am very sorry to hear that any notice has been taken of the\r\n    absentees in the vote for Prince Leopold's grant. Considering the\r\n    strong views held on this subject by the Radical party in the country,\r\n    I think their representatives in the Government made great sacrifices\r\n    in order to maintain unity of action as far as possible. You and\r\n    Fawcett and Trevelyan have on previous occasions, both by speech and\r\n    vote, and on strictly constitutional grounds, opposed these grants,\r\n    and you could not have supported the present one without loss of self-\r\n    respect and of public reputation. For myself, I agree in your\r\n    opposition, but having never taken any public part in reference to the\r\n    question, and having never voted against the grant itself, I felt\r\n    myself free to yield my opinion to that of the majority, and to vote\r\n    with the rest of my colleagues in the Cabinet. In your case such a\r\n    course was impossible, having regard to the prominence which, through\r\n    no fault or desire of your own, has been given to your past action in\r\n    the matter, and which has made you in some sort the chief\r\n    Parliamentary representative of objections which are widely felt to\r\n    the present mode of providing for members of the Royal Family. When\r\n    the Government was formed I mentioned this point to Mr. Gladstone, and\r\n    told him you could not vote for any grant of the kind. He asked me if\r\n    I was equally pledged, and I replied that this was not the case. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone then said that, of course, a divergence of opinion in a\r\n    member of the Cabinet would be more serious than in a Minister outside\r\n    the Cabinet, and I took it for granted that under the circumstances\r\n    you, at least, would not be expected to vote at all. I assume that\r\n    although the subject has now been referred to, there is not the\r\n    slightest intention or suggestion from any quarter that you should\r\n    resign on such a matter. If there were, I have not the least\r\n    hesitation in saying that I should make common cause with you; and I\r\n    cannot conceive that any Radical would consent to hold office in a\r\n    Government which had expelled one of its most popular members, and one\r\n    of the few representatives of the most numerous section of the Liberal\r\n    party, for such a cause. But I cannot believe in the possibility of\r\n    any such intention. If I did I might end with Lord Hartington's\r\n    celebrated postscript, and 'Thank God we should soon be out of this\r\n    d--d Government.'\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    '\"J. Chamberlain.\"\r\n\r\n    'I received further letters about the matter from Lord Granville, who\r\n    ultimately replied on April 4th that \"Gladstone does not admit your\r\n    contention.\" But he said, \"The case is not likely to arise again for\r\n    some time.... In the meantime he approves my writing to the Queen off\r\n    my own bat,\" and this was done accordingly, the letter not being shown\r\n    to me, so that I do not know what was in it. But the whole matter came\r\n    up again in the autumn, when it was proposed to put me in the\r\n    Cabinet.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles wished on public grounds to get rid of questions as to these\r\ngrants, the recurrence of which must always lead to trouble, and to do\r\nthis by settling them on a principle. But also he was desirous to forward\r\nthe wishes of the Prince of Wales, and in the month of May he devised a\r\nmethod for meeting the difficulty, which might be proposed by the Prince\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n    'On Friday Mr. Gladstone talked for an hour to me about the Royal\r\n    Grants question, and the conversation was satisfactory on both sides,\r\n    for he told the Cabinet yesterday that it had been satisfactory to\r\n    him. In the course of it he said that many years ago a memorandum on\r\n    the provision for the younger branches of the Royal Family had been\r\n    agreed upon by the Cabinet, and shown to the chiefs of the Opposition.\r\n    He added that this was a course perhaps not so wise as would have been\r\n    the appointment of a Select Committee of the House of Commons. I at\r\n    once told him that the consideration of the subject, which had not\r\n    been discussed by the Civil List Committee at the beginning of the\r\n    reign, by a later Select Committee, would in my opinion have prevented\r\n    all but most unreasonable opposition to the various grants. There are\r\n    many years to spare, and I only write because the matter is fresh in\r\n    my mind.... My suggestion is that when provision is proposed for the\r\n    establishment of the eldest son of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, for\r\n    whom a liberal provision would be made without reasonable opposition,\r\n    as he is in the direct line of succession, it should (at the same\r\n    time) be stated by the Government of the day that the question of the\r\n    extent of the provision for the younger children of the Prince and\r\n    Princess of Wales should be, on the motion of the Government,\r\n    considered by a Select Committee. On that Committee all shades of\r\n    opinion ought in prudence to be represented, and to it as much\r\n    information be given as is given to the Civil List Committee at the\r\n    beginning of the reign. Its decisions would be respected by all who\r\n    value Parliamentary methods, and much unseemly wrangling would be\r\n    prevented for many years. The fate of this plan, however prudent it\r\n    may be, would be certain if it came from anyone except His Royal\r\n    Highness himself or the Prime Minister of the day.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles embodied this suggestion in a letter to Mr. Knollys of May\r\n9th. The proposal was agreed to in principle by Mr. Gladstone's Government\r\nin 1885, and it was adopted later on.\r\n\r\n    'On May 3rd I had heard from Knollys that the Prince, who had\r\n    frequently been restive about not getting Foreign Office information,\r\n    which Lord Granville would not allow him to have for fear he should\r\n    let it out, had made Knollys write to Sir Henry Ponsonby to ask him to\r\n    beg the Queen to direct Lord Granville to send the Prince the\r\n    confidential telegrams.... On the 7th Knollys sent me Sir Henry\r\n    Ponsonby's \"not very satisfactory reply,\" and a copy of his answer.'\r\n\r\nIn the reply Mr. Knollys pointed out that the Prince was under the\r\nimpression that the Queen would have wished him to know as much of what\r\nwas going on as possible. The question whether telegrams were to be shown\r\nto the Prince depended entirely on Her Majesty, as Lord Granville would\r\nnot be likely to raise difficulties in the matter if the Prince put his\r\nwishes before him. The fact that the private secretaries of Cabinet\r\nMinisters had Cabinet keys, and therefore had access to all confidential\r\ndocuments, was quoted as showing the curious position of the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe Queen persisted in her objection, and Sir Charles supplied the lack of\r\nofficial access to the papers by keeping the Prince privately informed\r\nfrom day to day in critical moments. He spent the first Sunday in February\r\nof this year at Sandringham,\r\n\r\n    'where the company was chiefly sporting, even the clergyman who\r\n    performed the service being the famous \"Jack\" Russell, eighty-seven\r\n    years of age, known in Devonshire as \"the hunting parson\"....\r\n\r\n    'On March 21st the Prince of Wales invited me to go with him to see\r\n    the Channel Tunnel works, and to bring the map of Central Asia, and to\r\n    explain to him the matters that we were discussing with the Russians.\r\n    But I was unable or unwilling to go--probably unwilling because of\r\n    overwork, and dislike to commit myself to the Channel Tunnel project.\r\n    I was one of those who thought that the Channel Tunnel was far less\r\n    important in a commercial sense than was generally believed, and, on\r\n    the other hand, I feared that the creation of it might lead to\r\n    panic....'\r\n\r\nLater: 'I converted the Prince of Wales to oppose the Channel Tunnel.'\r\n\r\nThe one matter which, Sir Charles notes, still caused serious friction\r\nbetween himself and his Chief came up in this Session. On February 12th\r\n\r\n    'I was still fighting about Borneo and about a Garter Mission to the\r\n    King of Saxony, which I thought a waste of public money, and I was in\r\n    a difficulty with the Cabinet as to Errington's mission--of the\r\n    details of which I was not kept informed.\r\n\r\n    'Wolff, who evidently had been told something by Errington himself,\r\n    gave notice of a question to ask Hartington whether communications had\r\n    taken place with the Papal See as to prelates in India, and Lord\r\n    Granville directed me to answer that no such communications had been\r\n    made by Her Majesty's Government. As, however, I thought that\r\n    communications had been made by Errington, I felt that this would be a\r\n    virtual lie, and wrote to Hartington to ask him. Hartington then took\r\n    the answer upon himself, and in his reply to me he said that there had\r\n    been some discussions on a closely connected matter, but not exactly\r\n    on that mentioned in the question, and that nothing had been done by\r\n    him in the matter. Who, then, instructed Errington?... The Errington\r\n    mission led for a moment to strained relations between Lord Granville\r\n    and myself, and one of my letters he said was evidently intended to be\r\n    \"wholesome in Lent.\" \"The tone of it is hardly that of two members of\r\n    the same Government, more particularly when they are excellent\r\n    friends.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles apologized frankly and cordially for the tone of his certainly\r\nperemptory letter, but\r\n\r\n    'I had to stick to my text....\r\n\r\n    'It was evidently monstrous that I should be made to answer questions\r\n    about negotiations of which I knew nothing, thus leading the House of\r\n    Commons to believe that I was in some sense responsible to them for\r\n    what passed, when as a matter of fact I was not informed, except\r\n    privately, and in strict confidence, by Errington himself. One result\r\n    of the concealment as to the whole Errington business was that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone on one occasion gave an answer in the House of Commons which\r\n    was untrue, although he did not know that it was untrue, and that on\r\n    another occasion the same thing happened to Courtney, who as Under-\r\n    Secretary of State for the Colonies denied that a Roman Catholic\r\n    question affecting the Colonies' (the proposal for a cathedral at\r\n    Gibraltar) 'had been discussed, when Errington himself told me that it\r\n    had. The Colonial Office did not know.'\r\n\r\nLater:\r\n\r\n    'There never was a more discreditable piece of business than the whole\r\n    of this Errington matter. Errington himself is an excellent fellow. I\r\n    have not a word to say against him. It is the Government and not\r\n    Errington that must be blamed.\r\n\r\n    'At this time I received a pamphlet from Auberon Herbert on the title-\r\n    page of which he had drawn a picture of Gladstone in the fiery pit\r\n    beckoning me, and I, winged and crowned as an archangel, falling from\r\n    heaven to him, with the inscription: \"Lapsus e coelo; or how C.D.\r\n    accepted an invitation.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his attention to domestic politics, Sir Charles was first\r\nand foremost the representative of the Foreign Office, and during the\r\nspring of 1882 he was ceaselessly concerned in the negotiations which were\r\nin progress between the Russian Government and the British India Office,\r\nover which Lord Hartington then presided.\r\n\r\n    'I had received from the India Office on January 6th a private\r\n    communication suggesting arrangement with Russia as to the\r\n    delimitation of the new Russo-Persian frontier. The India Office were\r\n    inclined to hand over Merv nominally to Persia, regardless of the fact\r\n    that the Russians would not consent to any proposal of the kind. I\r\n    wrote to Lord Granville on the 9th, \"I must say I don't like it at\r\n    all,\" and he answered: \"It appears to me that some of the permanent\r\n    Jingoes in the I.0. want to establish that they are always pressing\r\n    the F.O. to do spirited things, and constantly thwarted. I rather\r\n    agree with you that it is better to do nothing than to do that which\r\n    is not really effective, but Hartington is very anxious not to be\r\n    altogether quiet.--G.\"\r\n\r\n    'On January 17th I had the first of a series of important interviews\r\n    with Brett, Hartington's secretary, with regard to Central Asian\r\n    affairs. He gave up Merv, and in return I agreed with him that the\r\n    Foreign Office should propose to the India Office to ask Russia to\r\n    define the Persian frontier by an English-Russian-Persian Commission,\r\n    and the Afghan frontier by an English-Russian-Afghan Commission. Lord\r\n    Granville was unfavourable, Lord Hartington favourable to this view,\r\n    which after a great number of meetings at the Foreign Office\r\n    prevailed, the Russians ultimately accepting the Afghan delimitation,\r\n    a matter to which I shall have to return. The policy to which I have\r\n    always adhered was on this occasion stated in a paper which we drew\r\n    up--a secret \"Memorandum on the question of the undefined frontiers\r\n    between Persia, Afghanistan, and Russia\"--in words which, referring to\r\n    the probability that without an agreement Russia would establish\r\n    herself at Herat, went on:\r\n\r\n    '\"Peace might be maintained for a time, but it would always be a\r\n    precarious peace, for the direct influence of Russia, backed by her\r\n    show of military force, would in time overawe the Afghans, and give\r\n    her a preponderance of which we should feel the effects, either in the\r\n    necessity for costly defensive preparations and a large increase of\r\n    the garrison of India, or in the danger to the tranquillity and\r\n    permanence of our rule.... Secure on a strong line, flanked at one end\r\n    by Balkh and at the other by Herat, covered towards Kabul by a zone of\r\n    friendly Hazara tribes ... and connected by rail and steam with her\r\n    bases in the Caucasus and on the Volga, she could afford to laugh at\r\n    threats from India, and might deal at leisure with Afghan tribes and\r\n    leaders.\"'\r\n\r\nTwo later jottings on the manuscript follow:\r\n\r\n    '\"This is still true in 1906.\"\r\n\r\n    '\"In 1908 I approved the main lines of an agreement with Russia.\"\r\n\r\n    'On February 20th (1882) a conference took place between Lord\r\n    Granville, Lord Hartington, Tenterden, and myself as to Central Asia.\r\n    Hartington wanted to pay Persia to hold the Turcoman oasis--a most\r\n    monstrous proposition.\r\n\r\n    'On the next day, the 21st, a telegram was written to go to India,\r\n    which was so drawn by Hartington as to make the Foreign Office approve\r\n    his absurd Merv scheme. I got it altered, and Merv left out, and\r\n    guarding words put in.\r\n\r\n    'On February 22nd the Russian Ambassador promised Lord Granville that\r\n    we should be allowed to carry out my idea of a joint commission for\r\n    the Afghan frontier.\r\n\r\n    'On March 10th there was a meeting between Lord Hartington and Lord\r\n    Granville and myself as to Central Asia.'\r\n\r\nLord Ripon wrote from Simla on May 15th to condemn Lord Hartington's\r\npolicy of\r\n\r\n    '\"trying to interpose Persia as a buffer between Russia and the\r\n    Afghans.... I do not believe either in the strength or in the good\r\n    faith of Persia,\" said Lord Ripon. \"...I am afraid that the India\r\n    Office have by no means got rid of the notions which were afloat in\r\n    Salisbury's time.\" On the other hand, Lord Ripon was in favour of a\r\n    treaty with the Afghans, to which I was opposed except in the form of\r\n    a mere frontier delimitation.'\r\n\r\nThe India Office, however, never caused Dilke so many heart-burnings as\r\nsprang from his concern with those African and Australasian matters on\r\nwhich the Foreign Office was obliged to secure co-operation from the\r\nColonial Office.\r\n\r\n    'On January 13th, in addition to further trouble about Borneo, a new\r\n    controversy sprang up between me and the Colonial Office. It was, I\r\n    think, on January 6th, 1882, that I received from Mr. Gladstone the\r\n    letter which began: \"Cameroon River, West Africa. Mr. Gladstone. Dear\r\n    Sir, We both your servants have meet this afternoon to write to you\r\n    these few lines of writing, trusting it may find you in a good state\r\n    of life, as it leaves us at present. As we heard here that you are the\r\n    chief man in the House of Commons, so we write to you to tell you that\r\n    we want to be under Her Majesty's control.\" It ended: \"Please to send\r\n    us an answer as quick as you can. With kind regards, we are, dear sir,\r\n    your obedient servants, King Bell and King Akua.\"\r\n\r\n'Lord Kimberley had absolutely refused; but I, holding that this spot was\r\nafter all the best on the West Coast of Africa, and the only one where a\r\nhealth station could be established, urged acceptance, without being able\r\nto get my own way. Lord Granville wrote concerning Lord Kimberley' (not\r\nwithout a retrospective glance at his own Under-Secretary): '\"Perhaps he\r\nfears Cameroon cold water too much in consequence of the scalding water\r\nfrom Borneo.\" Being entirely unable to get my way, I proposed that the\r\nletter of the Kings should be \"made official,\" and sent to Lord Granville;\r\nthat he should officially invite the opinion of the Colonial Office on it,\r\nand that if the Colonial Office wrote a despatch against it we should\r\nrefuse, but not refuse without the Colonial Office opinion being on\r\nofficial record. The offer of the cession of the Cameroons having been\r\nrenewed later, and I having again most strongly urged acceptance, a consul\r\nwas sent to the country to investigate the matter, when the Germans\r\nsuddenly interfered; snapped it up, and made it a new colony. Kimberley\r\nwas entirely responsible, as I had persuaded Lord Granville to agree with\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAmong the passages which carry on the Parliamentary narrative come sundry\r\njottings and observations. Those for the first session of 1882 concern\r\nthemselves mainly with two names--Bismarck and Gambetta.\r\n\r\n    'On January 14th I heard from Germany that the Crown Prince had\r\n    suddenly broken away from Bismarck on the issue of the last rescript,\r\n    and that he had sent his secretary to the Liberal leaders to tell them\r\n    that he had first heard of the rescript when he read it in the paper.\r\n    Writing to Grant Duff, I added that the Crown Prince \"swears that\r\n    nothing will induce him to employ Bismarck when he ascends the\r\n    throne.\" This was but a passing feeling caused by Bismarck's attacks\r\n    on the Princess.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Herbert Bismarck is coming to see me in Paris at his father's\r\n    wish....\r\n\r\n    \"_18th_.--He is confined to his bed in London; I am to see him there\r\n    instead of here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    'On January 20th Herbert Bismarck dined with me--a man to whom I took\r\n    a liking. I had not seen much of him before this date, but from this\r\n    time forward we had continual meetings--a man of far stronger ability\r\n    than that for which the public gives him credit. He had a special\r\n    aversion to being called \"Herbert,\" and insisted on being called the\r\n    Count of Bismarck-Schoenhausen.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, January 22nd, I dined with the German Councillor of\r\n    Embassy... and met again Count Bismarck. I wrote in my diary on this\r\n    day: \"Bismarck is a chip of the old block: not a bad sort of brute,\r\n    with a great deal of humour of a rough kind. He saw through ----, an\r\n    Austrian, who is a toad-eater, in a moment, and stopped a pompous\r\n    story of his about ----. As soon as we were told by the narrator, with\r\n    a proper British shake of the head, that he 'drank,' Bismarck shouted\r\n    at the top of his voice: 'Well, that is _one_ point in his favour.'\r\n    ----, disconcerted, went on and said: 'He fell from the landing and\r\n    was killed.' 'Ah,' cried Bismarck, 'what a wretched constitution he\r\n    must have had!'\" In an aside to me Bismarck violently attacked\r\n    Papists, and broke out against the Confessional in the tone of\r\n    Newdegate, or of Whalley, or of General Grant. To the whole table he\r\n    stoutly maintained that it was right that no Jew should be admitted\r\n    into the Prussian Guards or into clubs. One man at table said: \"But\r\n    you had a Jew in the Guards\"; to which Bismarck replied: \"We precious\r\n    soon hunted him out.\" The man hunted out was the son of Prince\r\n    Bismarck's banker, the Rothschilds' agent, British Consul at Berlin,\r\n    and Bismarck's confidential adviser at the time of the treaty of\r\n    Versailles. I added in my diary of young Bismarck: \"He is only 'sham'\r\n    mad.\"\r\n\r\n    'On March 29th I received a letter from Crowe [Footnote: Of Sir Joseph\r\n    Crowe, British Commercial Attaché, Sir Charles says:\r\n\r\n    \"Joseph Archer Crowe had been known to me as _Daily News_\r\n    correspondent in Paris when I was six years old in 1849, and when my\r\n    grandfather was managing the _Daily News_. Many years afterwards I got\r\n    to know of a Crowe, a great authority on Italian Painters, but I had\r\n    not the least idea that this Crowe was the same person as the other\r\n    Crowe. When I entered the Foreign Office I became aware of the\r\n    diplomatic and consular work that had been done by J. A. Crowe, but I\r\n    was not aware of his identity with either of the others till we sat\r\n    together on the Royal Commission. After ceasing to be a young painter\r\n    in Paris, Crowe became _Illustrated London News_ correspondent in the\r\n    Crimea, and then accepted an art appointment in India. He was at\r\n    Bombay during the Mutiny. Subsequently he went through the Franco-\r\n    Italian campaign of 1859 as the war-correspondent of the _Times_,\r\n    being present at the battle of Solferino. He was appointed in 1860\r\n    Consul-General for Saxony. Few men wrote four languages so well, and\r\n    while I never heard him speak German I'm told that it was as good as\r\n    his English, and his French was as good as either.\"] from Berlin,\r\n    saying that the Chancellor was weak in health and prophesying ultimate\r\n    war. In sending it to Lord Granville, I wrote: \"I obstinately refuse\r\n    to believe that the Russian Emperor will go to his destruction at the\r\n    behest of his revolutionists.\" And Lord Granville wrote back: \"I\r\n    agree. Herbert Bismarck confirms the account of his father's weakness.\r\n    Cannot walk eighty yards without sitting down.\"'\r\n\r\nIn France, the greatest of French statesmen had been turned out of office\r\non January 26th. [Footnote: The Gambetta Ministry fell by a vote on\r\nScrutin de Liste on January 26th. The Freycinet Ministry succeeded to\r\noffice on January 31st. On January 31st, 1882, Sir Charles wrote to Mr.\r\nFrank Hill: \"No member of the new French Government is taken from the\r\nmajority that overthrew Gambetta. All who are deputies voted in the\r\nMinority. All who are senators would have so voted.\"] But already people\r\nwere saying that Gambetta must be President, and that by 1886, the date of\r\nthe next Presidential election, he would have recovered all his\r\npopularity--or lost it for ever. 'The alternative of death,' says Dilke,\r\n'had not occurred to them; yet it was death, coupled with popularity, that\r\ncame.'\r\n\r\nThe friends had not met since Gambetta's fall, but\r\n\r\n    'Gambetta found time to write and thank me for my speech, as well as\r\n    for what I had said to him about his fall. He again promised a visit\r\n    to London in one of these letters.'\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS,\r\n    \"_Le 31 Janvier_, 1882.\r\n\r\n    \"MON CHER AMI,\r\n\r\n    \"Je vous remercie de votre bonne et forte parole. Elle me plaît par-\r\n    dessus tout venant de vous, qui êtes bon juge en fait de dignité et\r\n    d'autorité politique.\r\n\r\n    \"Je ne regrette en partant qu'une seule chose--de n'avoir pu terminer\r\n    le traité. Mais j'ai grand espoir d'avoir porté les choses assez loin\r\n    pour empêcher les successeurs de reculer.\r\n\r\n    \"Quand vous reverrai-je? Je compte bien que ce sera ê Londres, qui\r\n    sera toujours en beau quand vous y serez.\r\n\r\n    \"Bien cordialement,\r\n\r\n    \"LÉON GAMBETTA.\"\r\n\r\n'But the visit was destined never to take place,' though for years it had\r\nbeen continually talked of between them. About August, 1876, when it was\r\nalmost settled, Sir Charles had noted:\r\n\r\n    'Gambetta never came to England in his life but once (about 1869), and\r\n    that was on a curious mission, considering what the future was to\r\n    bring forth; for he came under the Empire as the representative of the\r\n    Republicans to enter into consultation with the Orleans Princes for\r\n    the overthrow of Louis Napoleon. This interview would no doubt be\r\n    denied if mentioned by many of Gambetta's friends, but he told me of\r\n    it himself.'\r\n\r\nOn April 16th, 1882, Sir Charles, on his way back from spending the Easter\r\nrecess at Toulon, breakfasted with Gambetta, who told his friend 'that he\r\nwas \"unique among fallen Ministers, for others, once fallen, are\r\nforgiven,\" whereas he was \"worse hated and more attacked than when in\r\npower.\"'\r\n\r\nHe was none the less witty. There was talk of reforms in Russia--reforms\r\nthat had been suddenly obliterated by the murder of the reforming Tsar.\r\n\"What did Russia want with a 'Parlement'?\" (Gambetta asked). \"She has two\r\nGenerals who provide her with it. Skobelef, _Parle_; et Ignatief, _Ment._\"\r\n\r\n    'On the 21st January, 1882, Alfred de Rothschild came to see me to\r\n    tell me that Bontoux had been to \"Alphonse\" [Footnote: The head of the\r\n    Paris house.] to ask him to help the Union Générale, which had been a\r\n    Catholic alliance against the Jews, and was now on its last legs. On\r\n    the next day Alphonse de Rothschild decided that he would not, as was\r\n    indeed to be expected, unless he had very strong, purely financial,\r\n    reasons the other way. He ultimately helped enough to save the\r\n    brokers, but not enough to save Bontoux or the rest. I found that,\r\n    ever since the Battle of Waterloo, the Rothschilds in London and in\r\n    Paris have been in the habit of writing to one another long letters\r\n    every day, and from time to time I saw these letters from Alphonse\r\n    when they bore upon political affairs.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was not impressed by the political insight of those documents,\r\nwhich seemed to him 'extraordinarily uninteresting,' expressing old-\r\nfashioned Conservative ideas, though 'the Rothschilds all think they are\r\nLiberals.'\r\n\r\nThe jottings end with a definition of diplomacy:\r\n\r\n'On the 24th January, 1882, I dined at the French Embassy, where Baron\r\nSolvyns, the Belgian Minister, amused me with the saying that diplomacy\r\nmeant \"to pass one's life à expliquer les choses sans les comprendre.\"'\r\n[Footnote: Adapted from Beaumarchais, who thus describes \"la politique\" in\r\n'Le Mariage de Figaro,' Act III., Scene ii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PHOENIX PARK MURDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIreland and Egypt fill the most important places in the history of 1882.\r\nThat was the year, in Ireland, of the Kilmainham Treaty, the resignation\r\nof Mr. Forster, and the Phoenix Park murders; in Egypt, of the riots in\r\nAlexandria, followed by the bombardment, which caused Mr. Bright's\r\nresignation, and the battle of Tel-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\nThey had their roots far back in preceding years. But the abrupt\r\ndevelopment of the trouble in Egypt was due to an accident; that of the\r\nIrish question was of no sudden or casual growth. The Parliamentary\r\ndifficulty as to procedure of the House was only part of Parnell's\r\ndeliberate design to paralyze legislature and executive alike. [Footnote:\r\nSir Charles notes: 'In 1890, when I wrote out these diaries, I showed them\r\nto Chamberlain, and gave him a copy of some part, notably that relating to\r\nthe Kilmainham Treaty and that relating to Egypt (1882). His remembrance\r\nof events agreed with the notes made by me at the time.']\r\n\r\nGovernment, for the moment, was trying to suppress Parnell and his\r\nassociates. The Irish leader himself had been in gaol since October 12th,\r\n1881; Mr. Dillon, Mr. Sexton, Mr. Davitt, and many hundreds of lesser men,\r\nhad been imprisoned without sentence or form of trial. Sir Charles Dilke,\r\nwhom nobody believed to be an adviser of coercion, experienced as a member\r\nof the Government manifestations of Irish displeasure.\r\n\r\n    'On January 31st I addressed my constituents. The Irish attacked the\r\n    meeting, and one East-Ender came at my private secretary with a chair,\r\n    howling Mr. Bright's phrase: \"Force is no remedy!\" As a very violent\r\n    breach of the peace had been committed, the police came in and cleared\r\n    the room, and after that our people came back again, and I was able to\r\n    make my speech quietly.... Congratulations upon my speech on all hands\r\n    were warm, especially those of Chamberlain and Lord Granville.\r\n    Chamberlain had written to me before the meeting to recommend a free\r\n    resort to \"chuckers-out,\" and on my informing him of the use made of\r\n    Bright's maxim, he amused himself by communicating it to Bright, who\r\n    was only grim upon the subject.'\r\n\r\nIrish discontent could count on sympathy and support from the rulers of\r\nAmerica. On March 31st, 1882, the Memoir notes: 'It was settled to tell\r\nthe Americans that those suspects who would leave the United Kingdom and\r\nengage not to return might go.'\r\n\r\n    'On April 20th I had to point out to Lord Granville the fact that the\r\n    Irish had shown on the previous day that they had got hold of the\r\n    condition which we had attempted to make with the Americans as to the\r\n    liberation of American suspects, a condition which the Americans had\r\n    indignantly refused.'\r\n\r\nAll these things affected public opinion in Great Britain. At this moment\r\nthe Radical wing was demanding a change of policy in Ireland, while Mr.\r\nForster was pressing hard for renewal of the Coercion Act, which, having\r\nbeen passed in 1881 for a year only, was now expiring. The Radicals won,\r\nand the change of policy was inaugurated by the so-called Kilmainham\r\nTreaty.\r\n\r\n    'At this moment' (April, 1882) 'Parnell was let out of prison, at Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's wish, to go to Paris to attend a funeral, but he was away\r\n    from prison, also at Mr. Gladstone's wish, unnecessarily long, and,\r\n    staying in London with Captain and Mrs. O'Shea, was seen by\r\n    Chamberlain at the wish of Mr. Gladstone (expressed on April 20th),\r\n    with the view that Chamberlain should offer him leave of absence from\r\n    prison with the view of concocting some arrangement (for his release\r\n    and for the pacification of Ireland) between him and the Government.\r\n    On the 21st Chamberlain and I met and decided that we would resign if\r\n    it was proposed to renew the Coercion Act, or the power of arbitrary\r\n    arrest in its then naked form.\r\n\r\n    'On April 22nd, 1882, Chamberlain obtained from the Cabinet, by a\r\n    majority, Mr. Gladstone being strongly with him, his own way in the\r\n    Irish Question, with full leave to enter into negotiations with\r\n    Parnell through O'Shea, but to be disavowed if he failed. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone reported the Cabinet of the 22nd to the Queen, stating that\r\n    the decision of the Cabinet was to the effect that it was wise \"to\r\n    strengthen the law in Ireland.\" This was one way of putting it. What\r\n    the Cabinet really decided on April 22nd was to let out Parnell and\r\n    his friends, and to drop arbitrary arrest, although they did decide to\r\n    have a new Coercion Bill on minor points, to which Coercion Bill\r\n    Parnell himself was favourable. The statement that Parnell was\r\n    favourable would be denied, but O'Shea showed me a draft Bill, which\r\n    was, so he said, in Parnell's writing. I knew the hand, and it seemed\r\n    to be so.\r\n\r\n    'On April 25th Chamberlain reported to the Cabinet the result of his\r\n    interviews. Lord Cowper had already resigned the Lord-Lieutenancy, but\r\n    Forster's resignation (for some reason which I have never understood)\r\n    was kept back for a little. It is a curious fact that the Duchess of\r\n    Manchester told me in the middle of March that Lord Spencer was to\r\n    succeed Lord Cowper; but the first the Cabinet heard of it was on\r\n    April 25th.\r\n\r\n    'On April 26th, Parnell having returned to gaol, leave was given to\r\n    Captain O'Shea to go and see him at Kilmainham with full powers, but\r\n    nothing in writing. On the same day a letter, which was sent me by\r\n    Chamberlain, after Forster had seen it and sent it on to him, shows\r\n    that Forster was still acting, or at all events being treated by Mr.\r\n    Gladstone as though he was going forward with his policy. But on the\r\n    28th Chamberlain told me that Forster would resign. In my diary I say:\r\n    \"The Chancellor and Lord Kimberley may go with him. In this case the\r\n    Irish Secretaryship would be offered to Shaw\" (member for Limerick,\r\n    Mr. Butt's successor as leader of the moderate Home Rulers), \"but he\r\n    would refuse because he could not get his county to return him. Then\r\n    it must come either to Chamberlain or to myself. I said I should wish\r\n    in this event that he should take it and I succeed him at the Board of\r\n    Trade. He said that my appointment would make less row than his. I\r\n    admitted this, but said that his would be the best for the public\r\n    service. Besides, my opinion in favour of Home Rule would form a grave\r\n    difficulty in my way.\" It will be seen that it never occurred for a\r\n    moment to either Chamberlain or myself that the Irish Secretaryship\r\n    would be offered without a seat in the Cabinet; but we counted without\r\n    remembering Mr. Gladstone's affection for Lord Spencer.... It will\r\n    also be seen that I did not count Chamberlain as being a Home Ruler\r\n    like myself.\r\n\r\n    'On the 29th Forster told Harcourt at the banquet of the Royal Academy\r\n    that he should resign \"if it is decided to let out the men.\" It is\r\n    necessary to be careful about one's history of this moment, for no\r\n    authorities are to be trusted. My diary was written at the time from\r\n    information chiefly supplied by Chamberlain, and Chamberlain has since\r\n    seen and agreed to this record (1906). On Sunday, April 30th, the\r\n    _Observer_ gave an account of what had passed at a Cabinet of the\r\n    previous day; but no such Cabinet was held, and on May 1st the _Times_\r\n    also gave an account of what passed at \"Saturday's Cabinet\"!\r\n\r\n    'On May 1st I saw Chamberlain before the Cabinet. Parnell had written\r\n    to Justin McCarthy to promise that if let out he was ready to advise\r\n    payment of rent and cessation of outrages, but McCarthy would not\r\n    allow the letters to be made public. Forster insisted that he should\r\n    give a public promise. I suggested to Chamberlain that to call on\r\n    Parnell to give a public promise was to recognize Parnell as the\r\n    Government of Ireland. Chamberlain agreed to argue that the promise\r\n    should be a private one so far as Parnell was concerned, but that the\r\n    Government should state that such a promise had been made. After the\r\n    Cabinet Chamberlain told me that at the Cabinet of the next day\r\n    Forster would resign; but he thought that the Chancellor, who was\r\n    restive about the remedial legislation proposed in the shape of an\r\n    Arrears Bill, would \"go\" too. I fancy the Chancellor had promised to\r\n    resign, but he didn't.'\r\n\r\nThis reference to Lord Selborne is supplemented by the Memoir for 1893,\r\nwhere Sir Charles has a detached note:\r\n\r\n    'Our former Chancellor at eighty-two is \"not less\" prosy in the Lords\r\n    than he used to be, for he was always \"slow.\" When W. E. Forster\r\n    resigned in 1882, Lord Granville left the Cabinet room to go down to\r\n    tell the Queen. Then, and then only, Lord Selborne said: \"But I agree\r\n    with him, and must resign also.\" \"It is too late,\" said Harcourt, \"it\r\n    would not now be respectful to the Queen as Granville has started.\" So\r\n    the Chancellor did not resign.'\r\n\r\n    The Memoir continues: 'On May 3rd Chamberlain, who had decided to take\r\n    the Irish Secretaryship if offered to him, was astonished at having\r\n    received no offer. At 11.30 p.m. on the same day, the 3rd, I found\r\n    that the appointment had been offered to and declined by Hartington;\r\n    but the offer to, and acceptance by, his brother, Lord Frederick\r\n    Cavendish, came as a complete surprise both to me and to Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'In the night between May 4th and 5th the Queen telegraphed to\r\n    Harcourt: \"I can scarcely believe that Davitt, one of the most\r\n    dangerous traitors, has been released without my having been\r\n    consulted, as I was in the case of the three members.\" The fact was\r\n    that Harcourt had so impressed upon the Queen the wickedness of\r\n    Davitt, at the time when he withdrew Davitt's ticket-of-leave, that it\r\n    was rather difficult for him to explain to the Queen his very sudden\r\n    change of front.\r\n\r\n    'On the 5th I had an interview with Mr. Gladstone as to royal grants.\r\n    I carefully abstained from giving any pledge as to future action, and\r\n    at the Cabinet of the 8th' (after Lord Frederick Cavendish's murder),\r\n    'when the question of my being offered the Chief Secretaryship with\r\n    the Cabinet came up, Mr. Gladstone stated to the Cabinet that I\r\n    remained unpledged.\r\n\r\n    'On May 6th I heard from Brett and from the Duchess of Manchester that\r\n    Hartington had proposed me in the Cabinet for Chief Secretary, with a\r\n    seat in the Cabinet, and that both Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville\r\n    had said: \"Dilke won't do.\" The Duchess asked me what this meant, and\r\n    I said that it was the Queen's objection on account of the Leopold\r\n    grant, which it was; but Mr. Gladstone was glad to give Spencer his\r\n    own way without a Chief Secretary in the Cabinet.'\r\n\r\nAt half-past six that afternoon, May 6th, Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr.\r\nBurke, the permanent Under-Secretary, were murdered in the Phoenix Park,\r\nwithin sight of the Viceregal Lodge.\r\n\r\n    'On the night of May 6th the scene at the party at the Admiralty was\r\n    most dramatic. Mrs. Gladstone had come there from a dinner party at\r\n    the Austrian Embassy, not knowing of the murder, while everybody else\r\n    in the room knew. At last she was sent for suddenly to Downing Street\r\n    to be told, and went away under the impression that the Queen had been\r\n    shot, for she was assured that it was very dreadful, but \"nothing\r\n    about Mr. Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\n    'Early on Sunday morning, the 7th, Parnell came to see me with Justin\r\n    McCarthy. He was white and apparently terror-stricken. He thought the\r\n    blow was aimed at him, and that if people kept their heads, and the\r\n    new policy prevailed, he himself would be the next victim of the\r\n    secret societies. [Footnote: In the letters of Justin McCarthy to Mrs.\r\n    Campbell Praed (_Our Book of Memoirs_, p. 97) there is an account of\r\n    what happened in London on that Sunday. There was a gathering of Irish\r\n    leaders at Parnell's rooms.\r\n\r\n    \"Then Parnell and I talked together, and we thought the best thing for\r\n    us--we two--was to go and consult some of our English friends. We\r\n    started out, and went first to see Sir Charles Dilke. Our impression\r\n    was that either Dilke or Chamberlain would be asked to take the post\r\n    of Irish Secretary. Indeed, the general impression was that either one\r\n    man or the other would have been asked at the time when Lord Frederick\r\n    Cavendish was appointed.... We saw Dilke. He was perfectly composed\r\n    and cool. He said that if Gladstone offered him the post of Irish\r\n    Secretary, nothing that had happened lately would in the least deter\r\n    him from accepting it....\r\n\r\n    \"He went on to say that he was a Home Ruler _quand même_; that he\r\n    would be inclined to press Home Rule on the Irish people, even if they\r\n    were not wholly inclined for it, because he so fully believed in the\r\n    principle, whereas Chamberlain would only give Home Rule if the Irish\r\n    people refused to accept anything less. But on the other hand,\r\n    Chamberlain was an optimist in the matter, and thought he could do\r\n    great good as Irish Secretary; and he (Dilke) was not so certain,\r\n    seeing the difficulty of dealing with the Castle and the permanent\r\n    officials, and therefore they agreed that as far as they were\r\n    concerned it was better Chamberlain should go.\r\n\r\n    \"He said, 'If Chamberlain goes, he'll go to smash things'--meaning the\r\n    Dublin Castle system.\r\n\r\n    \"Then we went to Chamberlain and had a long talk with him. We found\r\n    him perfectly willing to go to Ireland, but he said he must have his\r\n    own way there and he would either make or mar--by which we understood\r\n    the Castle system....\"]\r\n\r\n    'On this day, May 8th, I noted that I thought it most unlikely that\r\n    Mr. Gladstone would send Chamberlain to Ireland, inasmuch as to do so\r\n    would be to admit that he had been wrong in not sending him in the\r\n    previous week. To Grant Duff I sent the reason for Mr. G.'s decision:\r\n    \"Spencer wishes the policy to be _his_ policy, and does not want his\r\n    Chief Secretary in the Cabinet.\" At three o'clock Chamberlain sent a\r\n    note across to me from the Cabinet: \"Prepare for an offer.\" I was\r\n    somewhat surprised at this, because Chamberlain knew that I would not\r\n    take it without the Cabinet, and that I would take it with the\r\n    Cabinet, whereas his note seemed to imply a doubt. At four he came\r\n    across himself, and the first difference that had ever occurred\r\n    between us took place, because although he knew that I would not\r\n    accept, he urged acceptance of the post without the Cabinet. He argued\r\n    that it carried with it the Privy Council, that it established great\r\n    personal claims upon the party, and that it afforded a means of\r\n    getting over the difficulty with the Queen. I declined, however,\r\n    without hesitation and with some anger. It was obvious that I could\r\n    not consent to be \"a mere mouthpiece.\" Mr. Gladstone and Lord\r\n    Carlingford then sent back to say, personally from each of them, that\r\n    I was to be present at the Cabinet at every discussion of Irish\r\n    affairs; and I then asked: \"Why, then, should I not be in the\r\n    Cabinet?\" Carlingford came back to the Foreign Office again and again,\r\n    and cried over it to me; and Lord Granville came in twice, and\r\n    threatened me with loss of prestige by my refusal, by which I\r\n    certainly felt that I had lost Mr. Gladstone's confidence. I was angry\r\n    with Chamberlain at having placed me in this position.... Had he acted\r\n    on this occasion with the steadiness with which he acted on every\r\n    other, he would have told the Cabinet that the offer would be an\r\n    insult, because he knew that this was my view. The ground on which the\r\n    refusal of the Cabinet was put to me was the impossibility of having\r\n    both myself and Spencer in the Cabinet. Lord Granville came in\r\n    finally, and said in his sweetest manner (which is a very disagreeable\r\n    one) that he had vast experience, and had \"never known a man stand on\r\n    his extreme rights and gain by it.\" This I felt to be a monstrous\r\n    perversion of the case, and I was glad on the morning of the 9th to\r\n    find that my reasons were very fairly stated in the _Standard_, the\r\n    _Telegraph_, and the _Daily News_. Chamberlain had seen Escott of the\r\n    _Standard_, and Lawson of the _Telegraph_, and I had seen Hill of the\r\n    _Daily News_.\r\n\r\n    'That the Cabinet position towards me was dishonest is shown by the\r\n    fact that they had given Lord Spencer Cowper's place when they had\r\n    still reason to suppose that Forster was going to continue in the\r\n    Irish Secretaryship and in the Cabinet, and had afterwards asked\r\n    Hartington to take the Chief Secretaryship.\r\n\r\n    'An honourable (I trust) defence of myself is in a letter in the\r\n    possession of Grant Duff under date \"May 5th, closed on 11th.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter to Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff, which has separate brief\r\njottings on May 5th, 6th, and 7th, has so far been reproduced almost\r\ntextually from Sir Charles's Memoir. The rest runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"_8th_.--Mr. Gladstone is determined not to send Chamberlain to\r\n    Ireland, and does not want a Chief Secretary in the Cabinet, and to\r\n    send Chamberlain and so have a Chief Secretary in the Cabinet would be\r\n    to admit that the decision of last week was wrong. I, of course,\r\n    refused to go. I should have had to defend any policy that Spencer\r\n    chose to adopt without having a voice in it. Acceptance would not have\r\n    been only a personal mistake; it would have been a political blunder.\r\n    Outside the Cabinet I should not have had the public confidence, and\r\n    rightly so, because I could not have had a strong hand. I should have\r\n    inherited accumulated blunders, and I was under no kind of obligation\r\n    to do so, for I have never touched the Irish Question. Never have I\r\n    spoken of it from first to last. Many of the measures rendered\r\n    necessary by the situation are condemned by my whole past attitude;\r\n    but they have really been made inevitable by blunders for which I had\r\n    no responsibility and which I should not have been allowed to condemn.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours ever,\"\r\n\r\n    \"CHS. W. D.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Closed on 11th.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote also this month in a letter to Mrs. Pattison:\r\n\r\n    \"In a matter of this sort it is essential to have the look of the\r\n    thing in view, when a question of personal courage is involved. Of\r\n    course, I know that I have personal courage, but the public can only\r\n    judge from the look of things. The reason why Chamberlain even doubted\r\n    if I ought not after the murder to go--though I was not to have gone\r\n    before it--lay in the doubt as to how the public would take the look\r\n    of it. It has turned out right, but it might have turned out wrong. If\r\n    the public had gone the other way, I should have said I ought to have\r\n    taken it, and resigned.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff pointed out when replying to the letter\r\nof May 11th, in the state of things then existing in Ireland a Minister\r\ncould hardly have resigned without the gravest embarrassment to the\r\nGovernment, and he cordially approved Sir Charles's refusal: \"You could\r\nnot have accepted the Secretaryship without a seat in the Cabinet.\" That\r\nrefusal was also approved and understood by the heir to the Throne:\r\n\r\n    'On the 8th the Prince of Wales wrote to me through Knollys to ask me\r\n    as to the Chief Secretaryship, and on my informing him how matters\r\n    stood, replied: \"If you had accepted the post without a seat in the\r\n    Cabinet, your position, especially at the present moment, would be a\r\n    very unsatisfactory one. If the policy, whatever it is, prove a\r\n    success, I doubt whether _you_ would have obtained much credit for it;\r\n    and if it turned out a failure, you may be quite sure that a great\r\n    deal of the blame would fall upon you without your having been\r\n    responsible for the initiation of the steps that were adopted.\"'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix Park murders having immediately followed the appointment of\r\nLord Frederick Cavendish, those who had always pressed for further powers\r\nof police now asserted themselves with vehemence. Sir William Harcourt\r\nspoke strongly on Ireland and the necessity for coercion in the House of\r\nCommons. Mr. Gladstone, in whom the Radicals had always found a mainstay\r\nagainst these tendencies, was broken in spirit and suddenly aged. All\r\nrelations in the Cabinet were jarred and embittered, as the successive\r\nentries in this Memoir show:\r\n\r\n    'In the night between May 11th and 12th the Irish, although angry at\r\n    Harcourt's coercion speech, sent O'Shea to Chamberlain at 3 a.m. with\r\n    the olive-branch again.\r\n\r\n    'On May 13th Mr. Gladstone again stated privately that he intended to\r\n    give up the Exchequer on account of his advancing years.\r\n\r\n    'On this day the Cabinet unanimously decided to give an extradition\r\n    treaty to Russia--to my mind a most foolish proposal.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, May 15th, Mr. Gladstone sent Chamberlain to O'Shea to see\r\n    if Parnell could be got to support the new Coercion Bill with some\r\n    changes. When Harcourt heard of this, which was done behind his back,\r\n    he was furious, and went so far as to tell me: \"When I resign I shall\r\n    not become a discontented Right Honourable on a back bench, but shall\r\n    go abroad for some months, and when I come back rat boldly to the\r\n    other side.\" This reminds me of Randolph Churchill on Lord Derby, \"A\r\n    man may rat once, but not rat and re-rat.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, May 16th, Mr. Gladstone wrote, on Chamberlain's\r\n    suggestion, to Harcourt to try to smooth him over, and proposed a\r\n    Cabinet on the matter for the next day, Wednesday, May 17th, at which\r\n    Harcourt declared that if any change was made in the principle of his\r\n    Coercion Bill he would resign; but then nobody knew what was the\r\n    principle of the Bill. At this Cabinet Harcourt ... told the Cabinet\r\n    that the Kilmainham Treaty would not be popular when the public\r\n    discovered that it had been negotiated by Captain O'Shea, \"the husband\r\n    of Parnell's mistress.\" He informed the Cabinet that ... after this it\r\n    would hardly \"do for the public\" \"for us to use O'Shea as a\r\n    negotiator.\" I wrote to Grant Duff on this day (closed 18th) as to\r\n    Parnell's relations to Mrs. O'Shea as disclosed in Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, May 19th, Lord Derby said to me: \"You were right to refuse\r\n    the Chief Secretaryship; still Mr. Gladstone must say to himself:\r\n    'Surely I am about to die, for I am not obeyed.'\" On Monday, the 22nd,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone was very strongly in favour of accepting Parnell's\r\n    privately suggested amendments to the new Coercion Bill, obtained\r\n    through O'Shea, but Hartington going with Harcourt against touching\r\n    the Bill, Mr. Gladstone got no support except from Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'On May 25th Chamberlain was anxious to resign on account of\r\n    Harcourt's position as to coercion; but the fit passed off again.\r\n\r\n    'On June 5th I noted in my diary that I heard that Goschen was soon to\r\n    be asked to become Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n    'On the 9th Lord Granville told me that the hatred of Mr. Gladstone\r\n    for Goschen was such that he had point blank refused to make him\r\n    Chancellor of the Exchequer; but this proved to be untrue, for an\r\n    offer was as a fact made to him, although perhaps very privately.\r\n\r\n    'At this time I received a letter from Lord Ripon in India as to the\r\n    Kilmainham Treaty, in which he said that he was convinced that\r\n    Forster's policy had completely broken down, and went on: \"But between\r\n    ourselves is not the Government still ... on a wrong track in its\r\n    coercive measures? I do not like the suspension of trial by jury....\r\n    Again, if Reuter is right, it is proposed to take a power to expel\r\n    dangerous foreigners. I am too much of a Foxite to like an Alien Bill,\r\n    and, besides, if you are not very careful, the expulsion of foreigners\r\n    will land you in a very disagreeable state of relations with the\r\n    United States.\" These, I noted, were exactly the arguments which\r\n    Chamberlain was using against Harcourt without avail.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOn June 11th Mr. Chamberlain wrote that the Cabinet had decided on some\r\nimportant changes in the Prevention of Crimes Bill, and that things looked\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nBut on that day the Alexandria riots took place, and opinion was sharply\r\ndivided as to the measures which should be taken. Here Sir Charles Dilke,\r\nand with him Mr. Chamberlain, were strongly for forcible action, while Mr.\r\nBright, who in the matter of Ireland had come round towards the side of\r\ncoercion, opposed the use of force in Egypt. On July 5th there was a\r\nstormy meeting of the Cabinet, which two days later had its echo in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone, mixing Ireland and Egypt together, broke out in the\r\n    House of Commons on July 7th, and afterwards privately told his\r\n    colleagues that he intended to resign!'\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this outbreak was a debate on the Prevention of Crimes\r\nBill, which the Tories were seeking to render more drastic. The Prime\r\nMinister declared with emphasis that if coercive powers which he did not\r\nseek were to be thrust upon him, he must \"consider his personal position.\"\r\nThe words were at once in debate construed as a threat of retirement, and\r\nthere was a critical position in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    'Bright would follow Mr. Gladstone; and Chamberlain and I decided that\r\n    if this were so, although we were against him about Egypt, which would\r\n    be one of the causes of his resignation, we must go with him all the\r\n    same and refuse to join the new administration. Although I concurred\r\n    in this view, after discussion, it was not mine. On this occasion I\r\n    thought it was our duty to stay. But after discussion, as I have\r\n    stated, I came round to Chamberlain's view so far as this--that we\r\n    decided that we would not join the new Government if Mr. Gladstone\r\n    were outside it in the House of Commons; although the case might be\r\n    different if he quitted political life or went to the Lords, and if we\r\n    were satisfied with the new bill of fare.\r\n\r\n    'At this moment Chamberlain and I were anxious to get Courtney into\r\n    the Cabinet, and Mr. Gladstone having asked us, after Playfair's worst\r\n    mess, if we thought Courtney would take the place of Chairman of Ways\r\n    and Means, we told him that we thought he would only if it was\r\n    understood that it was not to lessen his chances of obtaining Cabinet\r\n    office. [Footnote: Sir Lyon Playfair, Chairman of Committees, had\r\n    suspended eighteen Irish members on July 1st.]\r\n\r\n    'When the House met at nine o'clock [Footnote: This means after the\r\n    dinner interval, for which at this time the House used to adjourn.] on\r\n    Friday, July 7th, I sounded Trevelyan' (then Chief Secretary for\r\n    Ireland) 'as to his course, and found him most anxious to stop in at\r\n    all hazards. I then saw Childers, who had walked home with Hartington\r\n    at seven. He said that he had urged Hartington not to form a weak Whig\r\n    Administration, and had told him that if Chamberlain would stay he,\r\n    Childers, would go on, but that he thought that to go on without\r\n    Chamberlain would be fatal, and that it would be far better to let the\r\n    Tories come in, and help them through with Egypt, and then make them\r\n    go to their constituents. At ten o'clock Grosvenor came and told me\r\n    that he thought that Mr. Gladstone would stay on. Chamberlain, who\r\n    still thought that Mr. Gladstone would resign, told Hartington that in\r\n    the event of the formation of a new Liberal Ministry he should insist\r\n    that Goschen should not be put in, and that the vacancies should be\r\n    filled up by myself, Courtney, and Trevelyan. At midnight the storm\r\n    had blown over.'\r\n\r\nA Bill to prevent eviction for arrears of excessive rents had been\r\ndemanded by the Nationalist party as a necessary amendment to the Land Act\r\nof 1881, and it had been introduced by the Government, and was carried\r\nthrough _pari passu_ with the new measure of coercion. It was furiously\r\nopposed by the high Tories, and a new crisis seemed imminent.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, July 10th, it again seemed probable that Mr. Gladstone\r\n    would resign. The intention of the Lords to throw out the Arrears\r\n    Bill, at Lord Salisbury's dictation, was loudly proclaimed, and it was\r\n    said by Mr. Gladstone's friends that Mr. Gladstone would at once\r\n    resign, and that if Lord Salisbury refused to form a Government, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone would retire from public life. Chamberlain was determined\r\n    then to insist with either Lord Granville or Lord Hartington for\r\n    myself, Courtney, and Trevelyan, on the ground that a Liberal\r\n    Government with a Whig Prime Minister must be Radical.'\r\n\r\nIt was the apprehension of such an increase of power to the Radicals that\r\nmade the threat of Mr. Gladstone's resignation formidable both to Whigs\r\nand Tories.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, however, did not resign, though Mr. Bright did, after the\r\nbombardment of Alexandria had taken place. On the contrary, by July 12th,\r\n\r\n    'so belligerent was the Prime Minister that he had now decided, in\r\n    face of the prospect of Lord Salisbury throwing out the Arrears Bill,\r\n    unless Lord Waterford on behalf of the Irish landlords begged him not\r\n    to do so, to prorogue, have another Session a week after, and pass the\r\n    Bill again.'\r\n\r\nThis quarrel between the Houses remained open till August 8th, when Lord\r\nSalisbury, under pressure from the Irish landlords, was forced to content\r\nhimself with acquiescence under angry protest. But in the meanwhile the\r\nGovernment were in other difficulties. After the bombardment of Alexandria\r\nit was still necessary to deal with the rebellion against the Khedive,\r\nwhose authority England was seeking to support; and the Tories, allied\r\nwith a section of the peace party, offered strong resistance to any\r\nmilitary expedition.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, August 2nd, I had a conversation with Mr. Gladstone,\r\n    who agreed in my view that if beaten we should force the county\r\n    franchise, and dissolve only if the Lords would carry that. It began\r\n    to look as if we should sit till Christmas.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, August 7th, I had an interesting talk with Brett. Knowing\r\n    his great influence with Hartington, I complained to him of his\r\n    chief's folly in always acting as the leader of a Whig section instead\r\n    of as deputy-leader of the whole party. Brett agreed that it was\r\n    foolish in the particular case of franchise, \"as he must give in at\r\n    last.\" I replied: \"But he has given in already, and gone back again.\"\r\n    Brett answered: \"He declares he never voted for it.\" This is a curious\r\n    example of Hartington's complete detachment from politics and want of\r\n    interest in them, for he had not only voted, but had made a long,\r\n    strong, and elaborate speech, explaining his reasons for so doing, and\r\n    then absolutely forgotten the whole thing, and thought that he was\r\n    still committed to opposition. At the Cabinet of the 5th he had\r\n    declared against a Franchise Bill.'\r\n\r\nWhen the Session ended on August 27th the question of Sir Charles Dilke's\r\npersonal position came up. Neither his refusal of the Chief Secretaryship\r\nnor his attitude of opposition to Mr. Gladstone's own wishes as to Egypt\r\nhad in the least impaired his standing, and promotion was felt to be his\r\ndue. The old difficulties, however, were still in the way, and Sir Charles\r\nrefused to buy his way into the Cabinet by a sham recantation. The matter\r\naccordingly stood over, as appears from this entry:\r\n\r\n    'At this moment there were fresh discussions as to my saying something\r\n    to the Queen to get over her difficulty about receiving me into the\r\n    Cabinet. Lord Granville, in congratulating me upon the way in which I\r\n    had done the Foreign Office work, said that Mr. Gladstone had been\r\n    unable to say anything to the Queen because I had hot given him enough\r\n    upon which to go. Mr. Gladstone then wrote to me a long letter in\r\n    favour of my making some statement to my constituents, but he went on\r\n    to admit in writing what he had previously admitted in conversation--\r\n    namely, that a Committee' (to inquire into the Civil List) 'would be\r\n    wise. Therefore I at once insisted that I should have the distinct\r\n    promise of this Committee before I said anything. Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    letter came very near a promise, as he said that when any new set of\r\n    cases came forward the question of a Committee would naturally come\r\n    up, and would, he hoped, be favourably entertained. I again called in\r\n    Chamberlain, and acting with him, declined to make any statement, as I\r\n    had in no way changed my opinion, but I pressed the appointment of the\r\n    Committee, or at least the promise of one. Mr. Gladstone again\r\n    promised to communicate with the Queen.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nEGYPT\r\nJANUARY TO SEPTEMBER, 1882\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1881 the form of government which Europe had set up in\r\nEgypt was but young. Tewfik, the Khedive chosen by the French and British\r\nGovernments to replace Ismail, had occupied his position for less than two\r\nyears. Riaz Pasha, head of the Ministry after the fall of his predecessor\r\nNubar, [Footnote: There is a note of October 13th, 1880: 'I saw Nubar\r\nPasha about Egypt, and I had received an extremely able long letter from\r\nRivers Wilson asking me to interfere to restore Nubar to power, but I did\r\nnot as a fact discuss Egypt with the French.'] had brought about a mutiny\r\nof officers early in 1879, and was carrying on public affairs with\r\ndifficulty. He had been forced to sacrifice his War Minister to the second\r\nmutiny (of February, 1881) which followed on the arrest and secured the\r\nrelease of Arabi. In the spring of the year the smouldering discontent of\r\nthe army was fanned into flame by the advance of the French to Tunis.\r\n\r\n    'On May 12th' (1881--the very date on which the French Expeditionary\r\n    Force constrained the Bey of Tunis to accept French suzerainty) 'steps\r\n    were taken on behalf of Lord Hartington, Lord Granville, and myself to\r\n    see whether, now that France had knocked another bit out of the bottom\r\n    of the Ottoman Empire by her attack on Tunis, we ought to try to get\r\n    any compensation in Egypt for ourselves. Hartington was to consult the\r\n    India Office upon the question, and I wrote to Sir Edward Hertslet,\r\n    asking him to consider how we stood with reference to the despatch of\r\n    troops through Egypt in the event of (1) a rising in India, (2) an\r\n    invasion of India by Russia.'\r\n\r\nOn July 28th, 1881, there took place at the Foreign Office the first\r\nmeeting of a Committee 'to consider the affairs of Egypt, consisting of\r\nTenterden, myself, Pauncefote, Malet, Scott the Judge, young Maine, and\r\nReilly.' Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, who had been Finance Minister under\r\nIsmail, was called in from time to time.\r\n\r\n    'My own endeavours on this Committee were directed against increasing\r\n    internationally in Egypt, as I thought the Governments of England and\r\n    France would be driven sooner or later to occupy the country with a\r\n    joint force, and that internationality (which would mean German\r\n    influence) would then be a great difficulty in the way.'\r\n\r\nThe need for intervention soon grew urgent. On September 9th, 1881, a\r\nlarge body of troops, headed by Arabi, threatened the Khedive's palace,\r\ndemanding the dismissal of all the Ministers, the convocation of a\r\nparliament, and a great increase of the army. Again the mutiny succeeded,\r\nand this time, in Sir Edward Malet's words, \"it was more than a mutiny, it\r\nwas a revolution.\" Riaz Pasha was replaced by Cherif, but all real power\r\nwas in the hands of the soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe question now came to be, Who should step in to establish order? The\r\nSultan of Turkey, who saw a chance of making his nominal suzerainty real,\r\nproposed to despatch troops, but confined himself to sending envoys. As a\r\ncounter-demonstration, France and England each sent a warship to\r\nAlexandria; and Gambetta's accession to power in November meant a great\r\nreinforcement to the policy of joint intervention.\r\n\r\nSir Charles was then in Paris engaged in the commercial negotiations\r\nalready described, and he chronicled in his diary a sporting suggestion:\r\n\r\n    \"_September 19th_, 1881.--After the seventeenth sitting of the Treaty\r\n    Joint Commission I had an interview with Delia Sala, the Italian who\r\n    is an Egyptian General, and governs the Soudan. He is a great fencer,\r\n    and has killed his man before now. He declares himself willing to put\r\n    down insubordination in the Egyptian Army by calling out three of the\r\n    Colonels in succession. A more practical but hardly less bold\r\n    suggestion of his is that he should be allowed to increase his anti-\r\n    slavery regiment of 600 men, and then to use it as a bodyguard for\r\n    Malet instead of the putting down of slavery.\"\r\n\r\n    'On December 27th, 1881, Lord Granville asked me by letter to discuss\r\n    with Gambetta all the possible alternatives, and especially joint\r\n    occupation (to which Lord Granville saw objection), and a Turkish\r\n    intervention under the control of England and France (to which French\r\n    opinion was opposed): \"The more you can get out of Gambetta without\r\n    committing us the more grateful we shall be.\" I have no recollection\r\n    of having discussed Egypt with Gambetta.'\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards\r\n\r\n    'Malet wrote from Cairo to Paris, telling me that he still had\r\n    confidence in the moderation of the progressist party represented by\r\n    Arabi and the Colonels, and that he was managing them through Wilfrid\r\n    Blunt, who was acting as a go-between; but a little later on the\r\n    relations between Blunt and Malet became such as to show that each had\r\n    thought he was using the other as a tool.'\r\n\r\n\"Moderation\" is an ambiguous term. When the Chamber of Notables met at the\r\nend of December, 1881, the army put forward through the Minister for War a\r\ndemand for an increase of 18,000 men. This increase the European\r\ncontrollers refused to sanction, on the ground that the country could not\r\nafford it. Thus came to pass a conflict between the national movement and\r\nthe joint European control upon an issue which united the interests of the\r\nmilitary party with the aspirations of the parliamentarian Nationalists\r\nfor the power of the purse. Gambetta, however, was now dominant in France,\r\nand Gambetta had no tolerance for the pretensions of what he called a\r\n\"sham assembly.\" A Joint Note, dated January 6th, 1882, was issued by the\r\ntwo Powers, in which England and France declared their intention to \"guard\r\nby their united efforts against all cause of complication, internal or\r\nexternal, which might menace the order of things established in Egypt.\"\r\nAnother phrase in the Note attributed the exchange of views between the\r\nPowers to \"recent circumstances, especially the meeting of the Chamber of\r\nNotables convoked by the Khedive,\" and this was naturally construed by\r\nNationalists to mean that parliamentary institutions were internal causes\r\nof complication.\r\n\r\nThe issue of this Note is one of the marking-points of modern Egyptian\r\nhistory. It asserted the determination of the joint Powers to make their\r\nwill obeyed in Egypt, by force if necessary. According to general\r\nadmission, its issue was due to the overmastering influence of Gambetta.\r\nDilke, whom everyone knew to be Gambetta's intimate, was in France almost\r\ncontinuously from the time when Gambetta became Prime Minister on November\r\n10th, 1881, till the eve of the issue of the Joint Note. In 1878, while in\r\nOpposition, he had publicly advocated a policy of annexation in Egypt, and\r\nit was inevitable that critics should fasten upon him a special\r\nresponsibility for the course pursued.\r\n\r\nYet, as the Memoir makes clear, in 'this weighty affair' Dilke had\r\nvirtually no voice. He was not in the Cabinet, and he was absent from\r\nParis for nearly the whole of December, taking a holiday in Provence from\r\ncommercial negotiations. Only on his return, on December 27th, did he\r\nreceive Lord Granville's letter--which was dated December 21st--asking him\r\nto discuss with Gambetta the possible alternatives. But although the two\r\nmen met repeatedly between December 27th and January 2nd, when Dilke left\r\nParis, Gambetta refrained from discussing Egypt. The Memoir says, under\r\ndate January 7th, 1882:\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet had before it the state of affairs in Egypt, and resolved\r\n    upon agreeing on Gambetta's policy of a Joint Note on the part of\r\n    England and of France in support of the Khedive against the\r\n    revolutionary party. Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, misled by the dates of\r\n    interviews, has asserted from that time to this (1890) that the Joint\r\n    Note was arranged in Paris between Gambetta and myself. I have\r\n    repeatedly denied that statement, for curiously enough it so happens\r\n    that the Joint Note was the only important matter relating to Foreign\r\n    Affairs which happened while I was at the Foreign Office in which I\r\n    was not consulted. Gambetta never broached the subject with me, and I\r\n    knew nothing of it until it was done. As we talked a little about\r\n    Egypt, I suppose that he had reasons for not wishing to speak of the\r\n    Joint Note to me, but I do not know what they were.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's policy for Egypt differed from that of his chief, who\r\nalways inclined to leave Turkey to undertake the necessary coercion, under\r\nthe surveillance of England and France. Dilke, with Gambetta, desired\r\njoint intervention. [Footnote: Lord Cromer wrote to Sir Charles Dilke\r\nasking him about a letter of M. Joseph Reinach's of July 28th, 1909, in\r\nwhich the latter spoke of his doubts as to the complete sincerity of the\r\nEnglish Government at the time of the Gambetta Ministry. At that moment\r\nDilke, in whose company he had breakfasted at Gambetta's with MM. Rouvier,\r\nSpuller, and other guests, did not, in spite of his great friendship for\r\nGambetta, believe in the duration of his Ministry, any more than the\r\nEnglish Government did. M. Reinach thought that Sir Charles Dilke's Diary\r\nwould throw an interesting light on the point as to whether, foreseeing\r\nGambetta's fall, the English Government did not foresee the probability of\r\ntheir sole intervention in Egypt.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's comment was as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"My diary (agreed to by Chamberlain after he had changed the opinions\r\n    he held at the time described) shows that permanent occupation was not\r\n    thought consistent with British interests by any who took a leading\r\n    part in the Cabinet action. I was not in the Cabinet until after Tel-\r\n    el-Kebir, but, as you know, I was--from the time of the riots at\r\n    Alexandria--of the 'inner Cabinet' for such purposes. Of course, all\r\n    men knew that the Gambetta Cabinet was dead before its birth. Hanotaux\r\n    ... is right on this. But we wanted the Turk to go for us, and,\r\n    failing the Turk (under our lead), then Italy in place of France,\r\n    after France backed out....\r\n\r\n    \"There was no moment up to '96--or perhaps '98--when if France had\r\n    known her mind and meant business she could not have had her way--\r\n    'reasonably.'\r\n\r\n    \"Gambetta's policy was dominated by hatred of Russia. 'I will seek my\r\n    alliances--n'importe où, même à Berlin'--meant anywhere except at St.\r\n    Petersburg.... Say to Reinach that I tell you that I don't mind\r\n    _showing_ him the governing passages in my diaries if he wants to\r\n    _see_ them, but that they are dead against him.\"]\r\n\r\n    'On January 15th, 1882, I started the idea that England and France\r\n    should not act as England and France only, but should ask Europe for a\r\n    mandate, and on the 16th Lord Granville took it up, and wrote to Lord\r\n    Lyons in its favour on the 17th. I sent to Lord Granville notes of\r\n    what I proposed to say in a speech on Egypt. I pointed out that I had\r\n    been one of those who had opposed the creation of the Anglo-French\r\n    control, but that it was the invention of our predecessors. Lord Derby\r\n    had created, when Conservative Foreign Secretary, a mild form of\r\n    control, which had been raised into the sharper form of control by\r\n    Lord Salisbury, who had refused successively to Germany, to Austria,\r\n    and to Italy, any share in the control. Lord Salisbury was wholly\r\n    responsible for it; but, however great its political dangers, from the\r\n    Egyptian and the economical point of view it had worked well, and,\r\n    being there, must be maintained, as it was the only thing between us\r\n    and anarchy. It was due to the controllers that the country had been\r\n    relieved from arbitrary rule. The co-operation with France\r\n    deliberately created by Lord Salisbury must be loyally maintained.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville wrote back praising the proposed statement, but\r\n    suggesting that I should not run down the control so much, and not\r\n    initiate an attack upon our predecessors. Although I slightly toned\r\n    down my observations upon this occasion, when we were afterwards\r\n    attacked on the matter in the House of Commons I more than once said\r\n    everything that I had proposed to say against the control and our\r\n    responsibility for its existence.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 18th Sheffield' (Lord Lyons's secretary) 'came to see me.\r\n    He said that Gambetta was angry with Malet, as Malet was under the\r\n    influence of Wilfrid Blunt, which meant that of Arabi Bey. I wrote a\r\n    minute of our conversation upon this point, and Lord Granville\r\n    replied: \"Gambetta must not drag us into too arbitrary a way of\r\n    dealing with the Egyptians. He is _très autoritaire_.\" On the 20th\r\n    Lord Granville received a private letter from Lord Lyons, who would\r\n    not hear of the mandatories of Europe plan for Egypt, which, however,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone had approved. It was from Lord Lyons's reply that I\r\n    discovered that Lord Granville had given the credit of the scheme to\r\n    Malet. I had never heard Malet mention any such idea; but on the next\r\n    day, January 21st, Malet did telegraph the plan, and I could not help\r\n    wondering who had sent it to him.\r\n\r\n    'On the 26th Lord Granville informed me that at the Cabinet of the\r\n    previous day my Egyptian \"Mandatories\" proposal had been considered,\r\n    and had been opposed by Lord Kimberley, but had received pretty\r\n    general support.'\r\n\r\nOn January 26th an event happened which destroyed the chances of joint\r\nintervention. Gambetta fell. The policy of joint intervention in support\r\nof any menace to the established order in Egypt, to which both Powers were\r\ncommitted by the Joint Note of January 6th, now passed into the hands of\r\nLord Granville and of M. de Freycinet, concerning whom Sir Charles wrote\r\non March 9th, 1882:\r\n\r\n    'I noted that Freycinet had begun his official career by doing what he\r\n    had done when in office before--namely, asking Bismarck's consent to\r\n    every act. He was so anxious to stop the Turks from going to Egypt\r\n    that he was willing at this moment to agree even to Italian\r\n    intervention in the name of Europe; and he was personally anxious for\r\n    reconciliation with Italy.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Egypt there had been a new ministerial crisis. Cherif Pasha\r\nwas deposed from the Presidency of the Council, and Arabi was made the\r\nMinister for War. The control, according to Sir Edward Malet, \"existed\r\nonly in name.\" In the provinces there was anarchy. Either the order of\r\nthings established in Egypt must disappear, or intervention in some shape\r\nwas inevitable.\r\n\r\n    'On February 1st there was a Cabinet upon the Egyptian Question. Lord\r\n    Granville wrote to me before it met to say that the Cabinet had\r\n    complained that we had not told them anything about Egypt, to which he\r\n    had replied that they had received the telegrams if they had not read\r\n    them.... At this day's Cabinet Hartington alone was in favour of\r\n    Anglo-French intervention, and he fell out with Lord Granville over\r\n    it, and they were on bad terms for some time. Some of the Cabinet\r\n    wanted English intervention, and some wanted Anglo-French-Turkish\r\n    intervention....\r\n\r\n    'On March 4th there was a Cabinet, at which Hartington made a great\r\n    fight against all his colleagues, who were unanimous against him upon\r\n    the question of Anglo-French intervention in Egypt.\r\n\r\n    'On March 20th the new French Ambassador Tissot came. I had previously\r\n    known him when he was the Agent of the Government of National Defence\r\n    inhabiting the London Embassy, virtually as Ambassador but without a\r\n    staff. On this occasion he immediately startled us out of our senses\r\n    by proposing that we should depose the Khedive and set up Prince\r\n    Halim. He had converted Freycinet to this madcap view.'\r\n\r\nHalim, the heir by Mohammedan law, was Arabi's candidate for sovereignty.\r\nDuring Sir Charles's visit to France in the middle of April this\r\nsuggestion became fully official, as he learnt on returning.\r\n\r\n    'France had proposed to us to depose the Khedive and set up Halim, and\r\n    we had refused on the ground of breach of faith. On April 20th the\r\n    Cabinet decided absolutely and unanimously against any suggestion with\r\n    regard to Halim.'\r\n\r\nSince the policy of united intervention in the name of Europe, to which\r\nSir Charles had sought to fix the Powers, had no longer any support in\r\nFrance, and since the French proposal of a new Khedive had been rejected,\r\nthe plan of Turkish intervention which Lord Granville had always\r\npreferred, as being the least bad, was now formally put forward.\r\n\r\n    'On April 23rd Lord Granville invented a plan of sending three\r\n    Generals to Egypt, because the French had told him that we had refused\r\n    their plan without having one of our own. The idea was that a Turkish\r\n    General should go with full powers, and accompanied by a French and an\r\n    English General, the full powers not to be used by the Turk unless his\r\n    French and English colleagues should agree.\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, May 12th, I noted in my diary that the French had suddenly\r\n    \"caved in\" to us about Egypt, and declared that a Turkish intervention\r\n    at the request of England and France would not be Turkish\r\n    intervention; and on Saturday, May 13th, I found Lord Granville ten\r\n    years younger than on the 12th in consequence. But the French\r\n    afterwards not only got out of this, but pretended that they had never\r\n    done anything of the kind.'\r\n\r\nThe decision to call in Turkey was not publicly announced, and the\r\nsituation at Cairo grew daily more threatening. Sir Edward Malet\r\ntelegraphed that a fanatical feeling against foreigners was being\r\nsedulously fostered. The Governments then, says Lord Cromer, \"authorized\r\ntheir Consuls-General to take whatever steps they considered possible to\r\ninsure the departure from Egypt of Arabi and his principal partisans, and\r\nthe nomination of Cherif Pasha to be President of the Council.\" [Footnote:\r\nLord Cromer's _Modern Egypt_, vol. i., chap, xv., p. 273.] Acting on this\r\ninstruction, Sir Edward Malet and his French colleague, on May 25th, 1882,\r\nhanded in an official Note to the President of the Council, which\r\ndemanded, first, the temporary withdrawal of Arabi from Egypt, and,\r\nsecondly, the resignation of the Ministry. On May 26th the Egyptian\r\nMinistry resigned. Thereupon the French Government decided that the need\r\nfor Turkish intervention had passed.\r\n\r\n    'Late on Tuesday afternoon, May 23rd, Lord Granville was in such a\r\n    hurry to adjourn the House of Lords, and bolt out of town for\r\n    Whitsuntide, that he let the French send off our Identic Note to the\r\n    Powers in a form in which it would do much harm, although this was\r\n    afterwards slightly altered. On the next day, Wednesday, the 24th, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone brought Lord Granville up to town again, and stopped his\r\n    going to the Derby, and at 1.30 p.m. they decided to call for\r\n    immediate Turkish intervention in Egypt. The necessity for it had been\r\n    caused by the childish folly of the French in trying to conceal the\r\n    fact that they had proposed in writing to us, through Tissot on the\r\n    12th, to send six ships to Alexandria, and that if in addition troops\r\n    must be employed on shore, they should be Turkish. The agreement\r\n    between England and France was useless unless it was to be known, but\r\n    if known, would have prevented the need for intervention. The most\r\n    foolish course possible was that adopted by the French in first\r\n    agreeing, and then concealing. On May 24th, at night, we proposed to\r\n    the French to call in the Turks at once, and Freycinet went to bed to\r\n    avoid answering.\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, the 26th, Tissot wrote to Lord Granville, \"M. de Freycinet\r\n    telegraphs to me that he is better, and will call the Cabinet together\r\n    for to-morrow to submit to it your proposal\"; and on Saturday, May\r\n    27th, accordingly, the French completely sold us, and we once more\r\n    realized the fact that they are not pleasant people to go tiger-\r\n    hunting with.'\r\n\r\nHe quotes from his diary of the moment the comment:\r\n\r\n    '\"The French tried to throw us (and themselves) over as to Turkish\r\n    intervention. I wanted to say so in the House. Lord Granville\r\n    agreed.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On May 30th I strongly urged that we should tell the truth and say\r\n    so, and a Cabinet was called for the next day, and on the 31st decided\r\n    that we were not to say so; but Hartington agreed with me, and made\r\n    himself very disagreeable to Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone, who\r\n    held the opposite opinion.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's entry of the moment was--\"Lord G. and Hartington fell out\r\neven rather more than usual.\"\r\n\r\n    'On June 1st, in the House of Commons, I half said what I meant, but\r\n    Mr. Gladstone spoilt the whole debate. I noted in my diary: \"When Mr.\r\n    Gladstone begins to talk on foreign affairs it is impossible to tell\r\n    what he will say--witness his revelations of a cock-and-bull telegram\r\n    of Malet's to-day as to the immediate proclamation of Prince Halim by\r\n    Arabi.\" On the same day, it having been decided on the previous day\r\n    that we should send ships to Egypt, Tenterden and I sent off a\r\n    telegram _en clair_ to Lord Lyons about it in order that the French\r\n    should know what we were doing....\r\n\r\n    'The Parliamentary difficulties of the Government upon the Egyptian\r\n    Question at this moment were considerable, as the Opposition were\r\n    taking with much vigour two inconsistent lines; Wolff and Chaplin\r\n    violently attacking us upon Jingo grounds because we did not intervene\r\n    by force in Egypt, and Bourke threatening us at every sign of\r\n    intervention.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Khedive had failed to form another Ministry, and on May 28th\r\nArabi had been reinstated, with the result that his supporters redoubled\r\ntheir confidence and that panic was general among the European residents.\r\n\r\n    'On June 13th we received full information with regard to the riots\r\n    which had happened in Alexandria on the 11th' (there being a British\r\n    and a French fleet there), 'in which several British subjects had been\r\n    assaulted and our Consul severely beaten. I formed a clear opinion\r\n    that it was impossible for us not to take active steps in intervention\r\n    after this, [Footnote: A private letter of this date gives the\r\n    estimate that \"there is an overwhelming public opinion here for very\r\n    strong measures; that the great majority of the Cabinet share that\r\n    view; that France is most unpopular; and that Lord Granville, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, and Mr. Bright will apparently bow to the storm.\"] as we\r\n    had been acting strictly within our rights along with France and\r\n    representing joint control. If the French would not go with us in\r\n    restoring order or allow the Turks to do so, I felt that we must do it\r\n    for ourselves, but I was clearly of opinion, and have always remained\r\n    so, that it was undesirable to embark upon a prolonged occupation of\r\n    Egypt. I thought, and still think, that anarchy could have been put\r\n    down, and a fairly stable state of things set up, without any\r\n    necessity for a British occupation. The riots, however, were the cause\r\n    on my part of a considerable error. I believed on the information\r\n    furnished me from Alexandria and Cairo that they were the work of the\r\n    revolutionary leaders in the capital. A long time afterwards I\r\n    gradually came to think that this had not been so, and that they had\r\n    been purely local and spontaneous. This does not, however, affect my\r\n    judgment upon the need for intervention.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, June 14th ... brought me a telegram from Wilfrid Blunt\r\n    to Arabi ... \"Praise God for victory.\" This abominable telegram\r\n    naturally had much to do with exciting the suspicions that I have just\r\n    mentioned as to Arabi having organized the riots. But I now believe\r\n    that the English sympathizer was more extreme than the Egyptian\r\n    revolutionist. In my diaries I wrote: \"Our side in the Commons are\r\n    very Jingo about Egypt. They badly want to kill somebody. They don't\r\n    know who. Mr. G., who does not like the Stock Exchange, sent 'Egypts'\r\n    up 3 1/2 per cent. by a word in his speech.\" [Footnote: Mr. Gladstone\r\n    on June 14th: \"... The ends we have in view ... are well known to\r\n    consist in the general maintenance of all established rights in Egypt,\r\n    whether they be those of the Sultan, those of the Khedive, those of\r\n    the people of Egypt, or _those of the foreign bondholders_.\"] At 6.30\r\n    in the afternoon there was a Cabinet on Egypt, Chamberlain and\r\n    Hartington pressing for action, and I being most anxious that action\r\n    should take place. As there was now to be a conference at\r\n    Constantinople upon Egyptian affairs, I urged without success that\r\n    Rivers Wilson should be sent out to assist Lord Dufferin, on account\r\n    of his incomparable knowledge of Egyptian affairs, Lord Granville\r\n    refusing on the ground that \"there's great jealousy of him among the\r\n    Egyptian English. He is under the charm of that arch-intriguer Nubar.\"\r\n    But we needed Nubar to get us out of our difficulties, and had\r\n    ultimately to call him in as Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n    'On June 15th the French Ambassador came to fence at my house at ten,\r\n    and I reported to Lord Granville: \"He volunteered the statement that\r\n    Freycinet was 'an old woman'; in fact, talked in the sort of way in\r\n    which Bourke used to talk of Lord Derby in '77-'78.\"\r\n\r\n    'In the evening I met Musurus Bey at the French Embassy, and had a\r\n    conversation with him, which I reported and he afterwards denied, but\r\n    I don't think much importance was attached to his denial. I need not\r\n    discuss the matter, as the despatches were laid before Parliament.\r\n\r\n    'On the next day I wrote to Lord Granville: \"The one thing we have to\r\n    fear is the murder of Malet or of the Khedive. If the Khedive obeys\r\n    the Sultan and returns to Cairo, it is very difficult to keep Malet at\r\n    Alexandria. I think we ought to tell the Sultan that we are sorry to\r\n    hear of the direction given to the Khedive to return to Cairo, and\r\n    tell the Khedive and Malet that we have said so. Also privately tell\r\n    the Khedive not to move.\" This I think was done.\r\n\r\n    'On June 17th I decided that I would resign if no steps were taken\r\n    with regard to the Alexandria massacre; but in the evening Lord\r\n    Granville telegraphed to Lord Ampthill: [Footnote: Lord Odo Russell\r\n    had become Lord Ampthill, and was still Ambassador at Berlin.] \"No.\r\n    130 ... it is impossible that the present state of things should be\r\n    allowed to continue, and if the Sultan is unwilling to do anything,\r\n    some other means must be found.\" On the 18th, after much pressure and\r\n    a threat of resignation from me, Lord Granville telegraphed to Lord\r\n    Ampthill: \"No. 131. Intimate to Prince Bismarck ... that sharing as he\r\n    does the strong wish of H. M. G. to avoid unnecessary complications,\r\n    he must feel that, even if H. M. G. did not object, as they do, public\r\n    opinion would prevent them permanently acquiescing in any arrangements\r\n    in Egypt, especially after the late massacres at Alexandria, which\r\n    would destroy not only the prestige of this country, but also of\r\n    Europe, in the East....\"\r\n\r\n    'The French having, according to Count Hatzfeldt, stated to the\r\n    Germans, as reported by Lord Ampthill in his No. 214, \"that to\r\n    sanction Turkish intervention in Egypt would be to commit suicide,\" I\r\n    proposed that we should direct Lord Ampthill to read to him Tissot's\r\n    communication of May 12th. in which the French had agreed to the use\r\n    of Turkish troops. Lord Granville assented. On June 19th Lord\r\n    Granville repeated, through Lord Ampthill, to Prince Bismarck, \"the\r\n    strong warning contained in my 131 of yesterday.\" I afterwards found\r\n    out, however, that at the last moment, on June 17th, Lord Granville\r\n    had telegraphed withdrawing the word \"must\" in his No. 130, and\r\n    substituting the word \"should.\" He afterwards telegraphed again,\r\n    resubstituting \"must,\" and wrote to me: \"I have let the word stand, as\r\n    Hartington and you attached importance to it, and as it had been\r\n    already sent.\" There was great trouble about this change afterwards,\r\n    for Lord Granville was not exact in saying that he had let the word\r\n    \"stand.\" What he had done was, as I say, first to withdraw it, and\r\n    then to resubstitute it upon our strong pressure.\r\n\r\n    'On June 19th there were two meetings of the Cabinet about Egypt, to\r\n    which I was called in; one at two, and another at six o'clock. I\r\n    simply said, like the servants when they fall out: \"Either Arabi must\r\n    go or I will.\"\r\n\r\n    'On June 20th another meeting of the Cabinet took place at half-past\r\n    three. Lord Hartington called attention to the fact that Lord\r\n    Granville had altered \"must\" into \"should\" in No. 130, for the\r\n    telegram had after all been printed for the Cabinet and the Embassies\r\n    with the word \"should.\" The Cabinet sat for four hours, and then\r\n    adjourned to the next day, on a proposal by Northbrook and Childers to\r\n    ask the French whether they would go halves with us in sending 15,000\r\n    men to guard the Canal. On June 21st I came down a little from my\r\n    position of the previous day, and stated that I would go out with\r\n    Hartington if he liked, but that if he would not, and I stood alone,\r\n    then I would swallow Arabi on the ground that the oath to take him out\r\n    was sworn by England and France together, and that if France would not\r\n    do her half, we could not do both halves, provided that they gave me\r\n    (1) protection of the Canal, (2) a startling reparation for the\r\n    murders and the insult to our Consul at Alexandria.\r\n\r\n    'At two o'clock the Cabinet met again. Lord Granville had in the\r\n    meantime written me a letter ... as to the leaving out of \"must\" and\r\n    inserting \"should.\" He said that if we changed our minds or had to\r\n    adopt palliatives, such as the defence of the Canal and reparation at\r\n    Alexandria, \"our nose would be rubbed in 'must.'\" I wrote back that\r\n    our position was not the same, inasmuch as he was evidently looking\r\n    forward to having to defend in Parliament a complete surrender, which\r\n    I was determined I would not do. On the same day, however, we\r\n    exchanged very pleasant letters about an accident to Lady Granville,\r\n    of which Lord Granville wrote: \"It frightened me out of my wits.\"\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet decided on the instructions to Dufferin for the\r\n    Conference, adopting proposals with regard to them which were made by\r\n    Chamberlain, and which were, in fact, mine. Lord Granville refused to\r\n    take them from Chamberlain, but Mr. Gladstone, with some slight\r\n    changes, made them his own, and then Lord Granville took them\r\n    directly. Northbrook went off delighted to continue his transport\r\n    preparations. Hartington warned Indian troops without consulting his\r\n    colleagues, but escaped censure. On June 23rd I suggested that\r\n    somebody should be appointed to assess damages to property at\r\n    Alexandria by the riots, as a ground for a claim against the\r\n    revolutionary Government, and suggested Lord Charles Beresford for the\r\n    work; but Lord Granville refused the man though he accepted the thing.\r\n    I obtained his consent to telegraph that we should insist on payment\r\n    of money to the relatives of the eight British subjects killed, of\r\n    money for the men hurt, of damages for the destruction of property, on\r\n    the execution of the murderers, on a salute to our flag at Alexandria,\r\n    and a salute to our flag at Cairo.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, June 24th, as I was only getting my way from day to day\r\n    upon these points by continually threatening resignation, Lord\r\n    Granville wrote to me in solemn reproof: \"Nothing should be so sacred\r\n    as a threat of resignation.\" But I cannot see, and never could, why if\r\n    one intends to resign if one does not get one's way about a point\r\n    which one thinks vital, one should not say frankly exactly what one\r\n    means. I never blustered, and never threatened resignation except when\r\n    I fully meant it.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, June 25th, there came a curious telegram from Dufferin,\r\n    stating that the Sultan was \"quite prepared to hand over to us the\r\n    exclusive control and administration of Egypt, reserving to himself\r\n    only those rights of suzerainty which he now possessed. In fact, what\r\n    he offered was an Egyptian convention on the lines of the Cyprus\r\n    convention.\" Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone took upon themselves to\r\n    decline this offer without laying it before the Cabinet, and on\r\n    Tuesday, the 27th, the Queen sent to Hartington to express her anger\r\n    that the Sultan's offer of Sunday should have been declined without\r\n    consultation with her. I certainly think that a Cabinet ought to have\r\n    been called, but the Cabinet would have backed the refusal, though\r\n    they afterwards regretted it.\r\n\r\n    'On June 28th I was again sent for to the Cabinet, which discussed a\r\n    proposal from the Sultan to send troops.\r\n\r\n    'On June 30th I dined with the German Ambassador, who told me that\r\n    Musurus had said to him exactly what he had said to me at the French\r\n    Embassy, and that he had placed the conversation upon record. On the\r\n    same day two additional British gunboats were ordered to the Canal.\r\n\r\n    'On July 1st I had one of the most difficult tasks to perform that\r\n    were ever laid upon me. I had wanted to get off the Cobden Club dinner\r\n    fixed for that day; but, Lesseps having come over as a flaming Arabist\r\n    for the express purpose of making a ferocious Arabi speech at this\r\n    banquet, I had to go in order to propose his health, to sit next him\r\n    at the dinner, to frighten him out of making his speech, and to make\r\n    such a speech myself that he could not without provoking his audience\r\n    mention Egypt at all. In all this I succeeded. I told him privately\r\n    that, after the massacre of eight British subjects at Alexandria and\r\n    the promise by England and France that they would jointly keep order\r\n    in Egypt, if he introduced the subject I would speak again after him\r\n    and raise the audience against him. The old gentleman was very angry,\r\n    but he made a different speech, and the matter passed off\r\n    successfully. Lord Derby was in the chair, and gave me great\r\n    assistance, because, through Lord Granville, he allowed me to inform\r\n    Lesseps that if he began to deliver the speech which he had in his\r\n    pocket, he should rise and tell him that it was contrary to the rule\r\n    of the Club to introduce controversial topics likely to lead to\r\n    violent discussion, and, in fact, make him sit down. Lesseps brought\r\n    me a telegram from his son, who was at Ismailia, stating that there\r\n    could be no danger in Egypt unless there were an armed intervention,\r\n    and threatening us with the destruction of the Canal if intervention\r\n    should take place.\r\n\r\n    'On July 3rd there was a Cabinet on a proposal by Italy for the free\r\n    navigation of the Canal. This was most unnecessary, as a virtual\r\n    neutralization in practice existed, but the Italians wanted to do\r\n    something, and after an enormous deal of discussion they ultimately\r\n    got their way upon this unimportant point.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, July 3rd, I received from Bourke, my predecessor, the\r\n    first warning of strong Tory opposition to British intervention in\r\n    Egypt.\r\n\r\n    'On the 4th Mr. Gladstone, Hartington, and Childers met to decide\r\n    whether the reserves should be called out and the troops sent forward,\r\n    but just before their meeting I saw Lesseps come past my door and go\r\n    to Mr. Gladstone's room at the House of Commons, which was next to\r\n    mine, and going in afterwards to Mr. Gladstone I saw the effect that\r\n    Lesseps had produced. Lesseps had a promise from Arabi to let him make\r\n    a fresh-water irrigation canal without payment for the concession, as\r\n    I afterwards discovered.\r\n\r\n    'On this day I wrote a memorandum on the subject of intervention (I\r\n    have an impression that it was based on Chamberlain's views, but I am\r\n    not sure). I pointed out that many Liberals thought that intervention\r\n    was only contemplated on account of financial interests--that if we\r\n    intervened to protect the Canal and to exact reparation due to us for\r\n    the Alexandria outrages, this feeling need not be taken into account;\r\n    but that if we were going to Cairo, we ought to make our position\r\n    clear. As far as Arabi personally was concerned, his use of the phrase\r\n    \"national party\" was a mere prostitution of the term. But there was in\r\n    Egypt a very real desire to see Egyptians in office, and a certain\r\n    amount of real national sentiment, and that sentiment we might\r\n    conciliate. I thought that if we intervened by ourselves the control\r\n    might be considered dead. The intervention must be placed on the\r\n    ground either of the need for settled government at Cairo, in order to\r\n    make the Canal safe and our route to India free, or else on that of\r\n    the probable complicity of the revolutionary party in the Alexandria\r\n    massacres, or on both. But in the event of such an intervention I was\r\n    of opinion that we should say that the recommendations of the Notables\r\n    for the revision of existing institutions would be favourably\r\n    considered, with the proviso, however, that the army should be either\r\n    disbanded or diminished, the only military force necessary in Egypt\r\n    being one for the Soudan and a bodyguard for the Khedive. To these\r\n    views I have always adhered, and while I strongly supported an\r\n    intervention of this kind, I was always opposed to an intervention\r\n    which made us in the least responsible for Egyptian finance, or to an\r\n    intervention followed by an occupation.\r\n\r\n    'Late on this afternoon of July 4th I secretly informed the Khedive,\r\n    through Rivers Wilson, of the instructions that had been given to\r\n    Beauchamp Seymour to bombard the Alexandria forts if the construction\r\n    of new earthworks erected against our ships were not discontinued; for\r\n    I felt that the man's life was in danger. I had been refused leave to\r\n    tell him, and I did it without leave. When I saw Wilson he told me\r\n    that Lesseps had officially informed him--Wilson being one of the\r\n    British directors of the Suez Canal, and Lesseps Chairman of the\r\n    Company--that we by our action were endangering the Canal. This was\r\n    evidently a French menace on behalf of Arabi, and I took upon myself\r\n    not to report it, as it would have only further weakened the minds of\r\n    men already weak. Lesseps was not truthful. He told Mr. Gladstone that\r\n    the Khedive had informed him that he was satisfied with the existing\r\n    situation. We immediately telegraphed to the Khedive, through\r\n    Sinadino, his Greek banker, who was representing him in London, to\r\n    ask him whether this was true, and the Khedive answered by sending us\r\n    all that had passed between him and Lesseps, from which it was quite\r\n    clear that it was not true....\r\n\r\n    'On July 5th there was a Cabinet as to the sending forward of troops,\r\n    at which it was decided to somewhat \"strengthen our garrisons in the\r\n    Mediterranean.\" Chamberlain afterwards told me that before this\r\n    Cabinet Lord Granville had begged his colleagues to remember who Mr.\r\n    Gladstone was, and not push him too hard. On this day, however, Mr.\r\n    Bright, Lord Granville, and Mr. Gladstone stood alone against the rest\r\n    of the Cabinet in supporting a let-alone policy.'\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, as has been told in the last chapter, Mr. Gladstone, under the\r\ncombined irritation of Irish and Egyptian difficulties, used words in\r\ndebate which indicated his intention to resign, and \"the two\r\nrepresentative Radicals,\" Dilke and Chamberlain, had to consider what\r\ntheir course would be if he went out.\r\n\r\nThey agreed, as has been seen, to go with Mr. Gladstone and Bright; to\r\nrefuse to join a new Administration should Mr. Gladstone be outside it; to\r\nreconsider their position if--Mr. Gladstone going to the Lords or quitting\r\npolitical life--they were satisfied with the new Government's programme;\r\nbut the storm blew over. [Footnote: The full diary dealing with the\r\ndifficulties of this moment has been given in the chapter on Ireland of\r\nthis date (see supra. Chapter XXVIII., pp. 446, 447).]\r\n\r\n'On Monday, the 10th, it again seemed probable that Mr. Gladstone would\r\nresign,' but this time it was in consequence of the loudly expressed\r\nintention of the Lords to throw out the Arrears Bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, however, decided not to go; the majority prevailed, and Sir\r\nCharles was able to write on Monday, July 10th:\r\n\r\n    'I had now given the reply which informed the House exactly of the\r\n    steps which would be taken. Guns having been again mounted on the 9th,\r\n    the Admiral told the Commander of the troops at daylight on July 10th\r\n    of his intention to open fire on the forts at daylight on July 11th.\r\n    Exactly one month after the Alexandria riots reparation for those\r\n    riots was tardily exacted at the same spot.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's personal attitude cost him some friends in France. His\r\nbrother Ashton wrote to him from La Bourboule a letter (received on July\r\n9th), in which he said: \"To judge by the French newspapers, you are as\r\npopular in France as Pitt at the height of the great war.\" A note from the\r\nMemoir renders this state of feeling explicable: [Footnote: A very\r\ndifferent current in French opinion from that of the newspapers found\r\noutlet in this letter from M. Émile Ollivier:\r\n\r\n    \"SAINT TROPEZ,\r\n    \"_4 Août_, 1882.\r\n\r\n    \"MON CHER MONSIEUR,\r\n\r\n    \"Vous avez été si aimable lorsque j'ai eu la bonne fortune de faire\r\n    votre connaissance, que vous ne pouvez douter de l'intérêt sympathique\r\n    avec lequel j'ai suivi le brillant développement de votre carrière\r\n    politique. Aujourd'hui je tiens à sortir de mon adhésion muette et à\r\n    vous exprimer combien j'admire et combien j'approuve la politique\r\n    actuelle de votre gouvernement en Égypte. Commissaire du gouvernement\r\n    égyptien auprès de la compagnie de Suez depuis près de vingt ans, j'ai\r\n    étudié de près ce qui se passait sur le Nil, et je ne crois pas céder\r\n    à un mouvement d'amitié pour le Khédive, en pensant que c'est de son\r\n    côté que se trouvent le Droit, la justice, la civilisation. Après\r\n    l'avoir intronisé, lui avoir promis de l'appui; l'avoir poussé contre\r\n    Arabi, le laisser entre les mains d'une grossière soldatesque, ce\r\n    serait une félonie doublée d'une sottise, car on perdrait ainsi ce qui\r\n    a été gagné sur la barbarie par les efforts de plusieurs générations.\r\n    Aucune paix ne vaut qu'on l'achète aussi cher.

Les autres\r\n    suivront. Nous ferons une fois de plus la triste expérience qu'on ne\r\n    supprime pas impunément de l'âme d'une nation l'idée de sacrifice, de\r\n    dévouement, d'héroïsme, pour réduire son idéal aux jouissances de la\r\n    vie matérielle et à l'amour bestial des gras pâturages. Vous êtes bien\r\n    heureux de n'en être pas là.\r\n\r\n    \"Je vous félicite chaleureusement de la part que vous avez prise aux\r\n    mâles résolutions de votre gouvernement, et je vous prie de croire à\r\n    mes sentiments les plus sincèrement cordiaux.\r\n\r\n    \"Émile Ollivier.\"]\r\n\r\n    'The French Government having ordered their ships to leave Alexandria\r\n    in the event of a bombardment of the forts, I suggested that our\r\n    sailors ought to pursue them with ironical cheers, such as those with\r\n    which in the House of Commons we were given to pursue those who walked\r\n    out to avoid a division.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFrom July 11th it was clear that France had decided to do nothing.\r\nEngland's course of action was still undecided.\r\n\r\n    'Although reparation at Alexandria was being virtually exacted by the\r\n    bombardment, in spite of this having been put only on the safety of\r\n    the fleet and the defiance of Beauchamp Seymour's orders, yet it had\r\n    not, on account of Mr. Gladstone's opposition, up to this time been\r\n    settled that we should land troops. There was now no hope that the\r\n    threat which the French had proposed to us, and which we had accepted\r\n    in January, declaring that \"the dangers to which the Government of the\r\n    Khedive might be exposed ... would certainly find England and France\r\n    united to oppose them,\" would be acted upon; but there was still some\r\n    idea that Turkish troops might be landed under strict safeguards for\r\n    supervision. On July 11th Chamberlain suggested to Lord Granville that\r\n    Lord Ampthill should be sent to Varzin to see Bismarck, and ask him\r\n    what intervention would be best if Turkish failed. This suggestion was\r\n    not accepted, but Lord Granville wrote to the German Ambassador to the\r\n    same effect.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone was in a fighting humour on the next day, July 12th. I\r\n    have the notes on which he made his speech, which give all the heads,\r\n    and are interesting to compare with the speech as it stands in\r\n    Hansard. He put our defence upon \"the safety of the fleet\" and \"safety\r\n    of Europeans throughout the East.\" He was indignant, in reply to\r\n    Gourley, about the bondholders, and, in reply to Lawson, about our\r\n    \"drifting into war,\" and he certainly believed, as I believed at that\r\n    moment, that the Alexandria massacres had been the work of Arabi, for\r\n    one of his notes is: \"International atrocity. Wholesale massacre of\r\n    the people, to overrule the people of that country.\" [Footnote: Sir\r\n    Charles, as has been said, did not adhere to his view concerning\r\n    Arabi's responsibility.]\r\n\r\n    'On July 13th the Foreign Office prepared a most elaborate despatch\r\n    from Lord Granville to Lord Dufferin, explaining the whole position of\r\n    affairs in Egypt. The despatch was much knocked about by Chamberlain\r\n    and myself. It had recited how an officer and two men of our fleet had\r\n    been killed, another officer wounded, the British Consul dragged out\r\n    of his carriage and severely injured; six British-born subjects\r\n    killed, and the Greek Consul-General beaten; but it had omitted the\r\n    important fact that a French Consular-Dragoman, and one, if not two\r\n    men of the French fleet, and several other French subjects had been\r\n    killed. The chief alterations, however, which we made, or tried to\r\n    make, in the despatch were in the direction of omitting all reference\r\n    to the financial engagements of Egypt, which we were most unwilling to\r\n    take upon ourselves in any manner. I actively pursued the question of\r\n    the outrages upon British subjects at Alexandria and of compensation.\r\n    We went into the case of Marshal Haynau, that of Don Pacifico,\r\n    [Footnote: Both cases furnished precedents for dealing with an\r\n    instance in which foreigners had been maltreated when visiting or\r\n    residing in another country. Marshal Haynau, the Austrian General\r\n    infamous for his brutalities in Italy (especially at Brescia) and in\r\n    Hungary in 1848, came to England on a private visit in 1850, went to\r\n    see Barclay and Perkins' brewery in Southwark, and was mobbed by the\r\n    employees. The Queen, in response to indignant remonstrance by the\r\n    Austrian Government, pressed the sending of a note of apology and\r\n    regret for this maltreatment of \"a distinguished foreigner.\" Lord\r\n    Palmerston, then Foreign Minister in Lord John Russell's Ministry,\r\n    sent the Note, but added a paragraph which indicated that, in his\r\n    personal opinion, the brewery men were justified in their action, and\r\n    that Haynau had acted improperly in coming to this country at all,\r\n    knowing the feeling against him here.\r\n\r\n    Don Pacifico, a Portuguese Jew who had settled in Athens, was, as a\r\n    native of Gibraltar, a British subject. Having had his house pillaged\r\n    by a Greek mob, he appealed to the Home Government, and Lord\r\n    Palmerston sent the Fleet to the Piraeus to enforce his demand for\r\n    settlement of the claim put in. Greece appealed to Russia and France,\r\n    and part of Don Pacifico's claim was referred to arbitration by a\r\n    Convention of the Powers signed in London. Our Minister at Athens\r\n    continued to take measures which resulted in the Greek Government\r\n    giving way, and, in consequence, the French Ambassador was recalled,\r\n    while Russia threatened to recall Baron Brunnow. It was in the Don\r\n    Pacifico debate that Lord Palmerston made his great speech of five\r\n    hours, containing the famous _Civis Romanus sum_, which turned the\r\n    House of Commons in his favour, and saved him from defeat by a\r\n    majority of forty-six.] and others mentioned in a memorandum printed\r\n    for the use of the Foreign Office in August, 1877; but the inquiry\r\n    afterwards held broke down our case.\r\n\r\n    'On July 14th the Admiralty and War Office fell out; the Admiralty\r\n    maintaining that they could put down all the trouble in Egypt by the\r\n    employment of a few marines commanded by an Admiral, whereas the War\r\n    Office had set their hearts upon a great expedition under Wolseley.\r\n\r\n    'On July 16th the German Ambassador complained of my having stated in\r\n    the House of Commons that Germany approved our action, not denying the\r\n    fact that she did, but saying that such \"announcements made\r\n    confidential communications impossible,\" and I had to reply that,\r\n    while Austria had approved and Germany not disapproved, I was not\r\n    justified in stating that Germany had approved, although there had\r\n    been \"circumstances calculated to make me believe that such had been\r\n    the case.\" On July 16th Wolff wrote to me from the country: \"I suppose\r\n    Bright has resigned. _Si sic omnes_ except yourself.\" Bright had\r\n    resigned, and there were some who were anxious that I should be put\r\n    into the Cabinet in his place, but I was not one of them. On July 17th\r\n    Wilfrid Blunt was at the window of the St. James's Club in Piccadilly,\r\n    and, seeing me pass, cried out to Lord Blandford and others who were\r\n    with him: \"There's Dilke that has done it all.\" That seemed to me to\r\n    be an answer to those who wanted me put in in the place of Bright.\r\n    \"The great peace man goes out, and they want-Mr. Gladstone to put in a\r\n    man who is looked upon as a war man, although he thinks he is not and\r\n    thinks he is right.\" ...\r\n\r\n    'On July 18th I received a letter from Labouchere which was\r\n    characteristic: \"Dear Dilke,--I am one of those who regretted that the\r\n    late Government did not seize Egypt.... Many on our side--being fools\r\n    --regret that we ever interfered in Egypt.... Personally I think ...\r\n    unless you seize upon the opportunity ... to establish yourselves\r\n    permanently in Egypt, you all deserve to be turned out of office.\r\n    Success is everything. This is the 'moral law' as understood by the\r\n    English nation. Bombard any place, but show a _quid pro quo_.\" There\r\n    was, however, no member of the Government, unless it was Lord\r\n    Hartington, who held these views, and not one who at this moment even\r\n    contemplated a permanent occupation, though I was fearful that unless\r\n    the matter was fairly faced, in advance, upon the lines which I had\r\n    suggested, a permanent occupation would be set on foot.\r\n\r\n    'Late on July 18th there was a Cabinet to discuss a proposal from me\r\n    to tell Dufferin in a \"personal\" telegram that we should not object to\r\n    Italy being third with England and France; which was afterwards\r\n    expanded into a direct invitation, upon my suggestion, for Italy to go\r\n    with us without France, which Italy declined. [Footnote: The reason\r\n    for Italy's refusal will be found explained in the Appendix to this\r\n    chapter (p. 477) in a letter from Baron Blanc, who was Italian\r\n    Ambassador at Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n    'After the sitting Lord Granville told me that Mr. Gladstone's letter\r\n    to Bright about his resignation was far from pleasant in tone, and had\r\n    put an end to a very long friendship. Morley, in his _Life of\r\n    Gladstone_, states the contrary, but he is wrong. [Footnote: _Life of\r\n    Gladstone_, iii. 83-90.]\r\n\r\n    'On July 19th I suggested that Arabi had probably told the people in\r\n    Cairo that he had defeated us at Alexandria, and that it would be well\r\n    to inform the Khedive, and through him the Governor of Cairo, that\r\n    intervention was about to take place on a scale which would make\r\n    resistance ridiculous, and Lord Granville asked Sinadino to do this.\r\n\r\n    'On July 20th the German first secretary came to me about Bismarck's\r\n    complaint of my speech, and Lord Granville wrote back in reply to my\r\n    report of the conversation: \"I do not think much of Stumm's\r\n    observations.... There is something in Bob Lowe's maxim, never to\r\n    admit anything; but if you do, I have always found it better to shut\r\n    the admission against any rejoinder.\" After all, Count Münster\r\n    admitted that we had the \"moral support\" of Germany, and I could not\r\n    myself see much difference between \"moral support\" and \"approval.\"\r\n    Lord Granville even reported in writing that we had Bismarck's \"good\r\n    wishes, good will, and moral support,\" and I certainly could not see\r\n    that I was wrong. The last position of all of Bismarck was that we\r\n    were not justified in saying even \"moral support,\" but that we had his\r\n    \"best wishes,\" I think he must have had a touch of gout at the moment\r\n    when he read my speech.\r\n\r\n    'A Cabinet was to have been held early on July 20th to decide to send\r\n    out an army corps; Mr. Gladstone forgot to call it, and it had to be\r\n    brought together suddenly (some members being absent), and agreed to\r\n    the proposal for a vote of credit. Mr. Gladstone informed his\r\n    colleagues that he should not meet Parliament again in February, but\r\n    should leave the House of Commons after the Autumn Session, if not\r\n    before it. Late at night there came the news that Arabi had turned the\r\n    salt water from the Lake into the great fresh--water canal, and I had\r\n    to go to inform Mr. Gladstone and Childers in their rooms. Their\r\n    replies were full of character. Mr. Gladstone dramatically shivered,\r\n    and said with a grimace: \"What a wicked wretch!\" Childers said: \"How\r\n    clever!\"\r\n\r\n    'Early in the afternoon of Saturday, July 22nd, when the House of\r\n    Commons sat, I was two hours in Mr. Gladstone's room with Lord\r\n    Granville, Northbrook, and Childers. There had been a mistake in the\r\n    vote of credit, really a blunder of £1,300,000; not of £1,000,000\r\n    only, as was afterwards pretended, for the estimate had been cut down\r\n    in the meantime. It was entirely Northbrook's fault, ... but Childers,\r\n    like a good-natured fellow, in spite of their many quarrels, let it\r\n    rest upon his shoulders, where the public put it. In the course of our\r\n    conversation it came out that Childers was in hot water with the\r\n    Queen, and had sent her a letter of apology on the Friday night, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone writing at the same time that he himself had nothing to add\r\n    to what Childers said. Childers broke out against the Duke of\r\n    Cambridge, who \"went chattering about the place, refused to behave as\r\n    a subordinate, and wrote direct to the Queen.\" I guessed that the\r\n    trouble had been either about the employment of the Duke of Connaught\r\n    or about the sending of the Household Cavalry; both of which had been\r\n    decided. The Queen likes the Duke of Connaught to be employed, but\r\n    never to run the slightest risk; and in dealing with soldiers this is\r\n    a little awkward. The Duke of Cambridge was always a great source of\r\n    trouble to Governments, Liberal or Conservative, for even Conservative\r\n    Governments have, from the necessity of the case, to desire military\r\n    reform. He is essentially not a grandson, as history tells us, but a\r\n    son of King George III., just such a man as the royal Dukes whose\r\n    oaths and jollity fill the memoirs of the time of the great war. But\r\n    the Duke of Cambridge ... knows how to stop all army reform without\r\n    incurring personal responsibility or personal unpopularity with the\r\n    public. A distinguished General once said to me: \"When we are invaded\r\n    and the mob storm the War Office, the Duke of Cambridge will address\r\n    them from the balcony, and, amid tumultuous cheering, shout, 'This is\r\n    what those clever chaps who have always been talking about army reform\r\n    and brains have brought us to,' and lead them on to hang the Secretary\r\n    of State for War.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, July 24th, there was a Cabinet to consider the obstruction\r\n    of the French, who were trying to prevent our intervention. I was not\r\n    called in, but I believe that my suggestion as to Italy was again\r\n    mentioned, for on Tuesday, the 25th, Lord Granville told me that he\r\n    had been intending to ask the Italians to go with us, but that the\r\n    Queen had objected and caused the loss of a day, and that he thought\r\n    he should be able to ask them on the morrow.\r\n\r\n    'On July 25th I made a speech which was much liked by the House, and\r\n    Northcote congratulated me quite as warmly as did our own people. When\r\n    Mr. Gladstone was finishing his letter to the Queen late at night,\r\n    Chamberlain asked him to let him look at it, which I never had the\r\n    \"cheek\" to do. The phrase about me was \"answered the hostile\r\n    criticisms with marked ability and with the general assent of the\r\n    House,\" and there was no praise of Chamberlain's own speech, which had\r\n    been spoilt by mine. On this occasion, as in the great Zulu debate in\r\n    the previous Parliament, when he had been my seconder, it so happened\r\n    that I took all Chamberlain's points beforehand, and in almost the\r\n    very words in which he had meant to take them. On the other hand, on\r\n    occasions when he spoke before me and I had to follow, as, for\r\n    example, in the famous debate with Randolph Churchill about the Aston\r\n    riots, [Footnote: At the height of Mr. Chamberlain's influence in\r\n    Birmingham Lord Randolph Churchill proposed to stand against him, and\r\n    held a meeting at Aston. Lord Randolph accused Mr. Chamberlain in the\r\n    House of Commons of having hired roughs to break up this meeting.] the\r\n    converse occurred. This was, of course, the inevitable result of our\r\n    habit of very free and continual conversation.\r\n\r\n    'When we sounded Paget in advance as to our invitation to the Italians\r\n    on this evening, he replied that \"if we pressed her, swearing she\r\n    would ne'er consent, she _would_ consent.\" But, although I afterwards\r\n    thought and said that I had been amazed at her refusal, my notes of\r\n    the moment show that I had anticipated it.\r\n\r\n    'On July 27th a new element of disturbance was introduced by the\r\n    Prince of Wales applying to the Government for leave to take a\r\n    military command in Egypt. The Queen at once interfered to stop it;\r\n    some members of the Cabinet consulted together at a sudden meeting in\r\n    the Cabinet room at Downing Street, to which I was called in,\r\n    Childers, Northbrook, and Mr. Gladstone being present, and it was\r\n    decided to back the Queen's refusal. It was agreed between Lord\r\n    Northbrook, Childers, and myself that for the future I should see all\r\n    the Admiralty and War Office telegrams.\r\n\r\n    'At 5.30 there was a regular Cabinet to consider the tardy consent of\r\n    the Turks to send troops at once. They were informed that\r\n    circumstances had changed, and that we must go on with our\r\n    intervention; but that they would be allowed to occupy forts not at\r\n    Alexandria.\r\n\r\n    'One of the first Admiralty telegrams that were brought to me was one\r\n    which directed the Admiral to inform the Khedive that we were going to\r\n    restore his authority, which was the most emphatic thing which I had\r\n    seen.'\r\n\r\nOn July 29th M. de Freycinet's Government was defeated on a vote of credit\r\nfor money to send ships to protect the Suez Canal, [Footnote: A new\r\nMinistry was formed under M. Duclerc.] and so terminated all possibility\r\nof France's partnership in the enterprise. On the same day General\r\nMenabrea politely refused an invitation that Italy should co-operate.\r\n\r\nBut the Turks were still disposed to assist, on their own terms, and these\r\ndid not yet make it clear what, if they landed, would be their attitude\r\ntowards Arabi and his partisans. Accordingly,\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, July 31st, we had to tell the Turks that if they insisted\r\n    on going to Alexandria we should sink them, and matters began to look\r\n    like a second Navarino.\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, August 3rd, the Cabinet approved our previous proposals\r\n    to send instructions to the Admiral not to allow the Turks to land in\r\n    Egypt until they agreed to all our terms.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, August 8th, Childers insisted that if Turks landed in\r\n    Egypt they should not be treated as allied forces, but as a portion of\r\n    our forces under our General. Lord Granville, Hartington, and\r\n    Northbrook thought this too strong, and it was left to the Cabinet to\r\n    decide, and on the next day, Wednesday, the 9th, Harcourt expressed\r\n    his concurrence with the majority.'\r\n\r\n    'About this time I had a letter from Dufferin, describing how he had\r\n    tried to frighten the Sultan by the bogey of an Arab caliph. But\r\n    Dufferin was at this moment in despair; the face of politics changed\r\n    too rapidly for Turkish diplomacy, and just as he had succeeded in\r\n    getting the Turks to send troops to Egypt, as he had been told to do,\r\n    it was so much too late that we had to tell them that we should sink\r\n    them if they went--so doubtless the Turks were a little confused in\r\n    their minds as to what we really wanted.'\r\n\r\nThe Memoir now carries the story down to the close of the expedition by\r\nwhich Sir Garnet Wolseley destroyed Arabi's power in the Battle of Tel-el-\r\nKebir.\r\n\r\n    '_August 10th_.--At this moment the Prince of Wales being most anxious\r\n    as to what was going on in Egypt, and having again failed to obtain\r\n    the telegrams, I promised that I would write to him daily, or whenever\r\n    there was anything of importance, and keep him informed, and this I\r\n    did.\r\n\r\n    'On August 16th there was a debate in which we defended the general\r\n    policy of the expedition, and I again have Mr. Gladstone's notes for\r\n    his reply to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, in which he again asserted that the\r\n    supporters of Arabi Pasha were not only rebels, but criminals as well,\r\n    accusing them of misuse of a flag of truce, and of deliberately\r\n    setting fire to the town of Alexandria.\r\n\r\n    'On August 17th I had a visit from a brother of the Khedive, Ibrahim\r\n    Pasha, who said: \"I want to go to Egypt. I should be very glad to go\r\n    as a Sub-Lieutenant, although there may be a little difficulty, for I\r\n    am a Field-Marshal in the Turkish Army.\" This modest youth, who looked\r\n    like the full moon, had been trained at Woolwich, spoke English well,\r\n    and was a devout Mohammedan, thought that he would be of use to us,\r\n    but his brother would no more let him land in Egypt than he would any\r\n    of the other and abler brothers.'\r\n\r\nParliament was prorogued on August 27th.\r\n\r\n    'On August 28th Mr. Gladstone thought that we should refuse to make a\r\n    Convention with the Turks, which they had now agreed to. But Lord\r\n    Granville and I thought that we had better make it for the sake of the\r\n    effect in Egypt, and Mr. Gladstone half yielding, our willingness was\r\n    telegraphed. On September 5th, however, Lord Granville told me at\r\n    Walmer that the Queen was strongly opposed to the Convention, and I\r\n    noted that this was the first time when I had ever known the Queen and\r\n    Mr. Gladstone to be agreed upon any subject.\r\n\r\n    'We took time by the forelock as a Government with regard to the\r\n    preparation in advance, and, even before our landing in Egypt, for\r\n    that which was to happen after the revolutionary movement was put\r\n    down. Sir A. Colvin thought that 4,000 men in addition to the military\r\n    police would be ample for the security of the country, and Sir E.\r\n    Malet appeared to agree. Mr. Gladstone wrote a minute himself upon the\r\n    future of the country, in which he proposed to act upon all my ideas.\r\n    He suggested the banishment of Arabi, a minimum military force\r\n    '(Egyptian),' a large police force, in which Indian Mohammedans were\r\n    to be allowed to enlist; but he wished a small British force to remain\r\n    temporarily in the country--a point to which I was much opposed,\r\n    inasmuch as I felt certain that if we stayed there at all we should\r\n    never be able to come away.\r\n\r\n    'A good deal of Cabinet work fell upon me at this moment because\r\n    Harcourt buried himself in the New Forest, and Chamberlain went away\r\n    to Sweden, asking me for a full table of instructions as to what he\r\n    was to do as to calling upon Kings, inasmuch as, he declared in his\r\n    letter, I was his _arbiter elegantiarum_. I went down to Birmingham in\r\n    his absence to see my son' (who was living at Mr. Chamberlain's\r\n    house). 'Hartington came up to town now and then, but apparently was\r\n    soon tired of it, as in the middle of September he wrote to me to ask\r\n    what was the meaning of the Cabinet on the 13th which he meant \"to\r\n    shirk.\" There were two Governments at this moment--the one consisting\r\n    of Childers and Northbrook in London, carrying on operations in Egypt;\r\n    and the other consisting of Lord Granville at Walmer and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    at Hawarden, connected by the telegraph, explaining them to the\r\n    Powers.\r\n\r\n    'During the period of the invasion of Egypt by us I used to meet\r\n    Childers, Northbrook, and Hartington at the War Office almost every\r\n    day, when Hartington was in town, and the other two when Hartington\r\n    was away. Tel-el-Kebir was on September 13th, and we met on that day\r\n    as well as the days before and immediately after.\r\n\r\n    'Immediately after Tel-el-Kebir I had from Auberon Herbert a letter,\r\n    which began: \"My dear successful Jingo, whom Heaven confound, though\r\n    it does not appear to have the least intention of doing so.... How I\r\n    hate you all! But am bound to admit you have managed your affair up to\r\n    this point skilfully and well. The gods, however, do not love, says\r\n    Horace, people who have three stories to their houses.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n'The refusal of the Italian Cabinet was afterwards explained to me in a\r\nmost interesting letter from Baron Blanc, at that time (March, 1888)\r\nItalian Ambassador at Constantinople, and afterwards (December, 1893)\r\nItalian Minister for Foreign Affairs:\r\n\r\n'\"The refusal of the Cabinet of Rome in 1882 to intervene, with England\r\nonly, as allies in Egypt was a success of French diplomacy, but at the\r\nsame time a result of the past policy of England.\r\n\r\n'\"Nothing on the part of England had prepared the Italian Government to\r\nbelieve it possible that England would cease to gravitate towards France\r\nin Mediterranean questions, especially when Mr. Gladstone was in power.\r\nThe hope that England would join the Italian-German understanding,\r\nconcluded in principle in 1882, had remained in these early days merely\r\ntheoretic. The Mancini Cabinet, in doing that which Minghetti, Visconti,\r\nBonghi--the old Right, in short--had not dared to do--that is, in drawing\r\ntowards the Central Powers--did not go so far as to understand that the\r\nrupture of the English-French condominium in Egypt--brought about in 1881-\r\n82 by the appearance on the scene of the Arabi party, secretly pushed from\r\nBerlin--offered Italy the chance of leading Gladstone himself to lean on\r\nItaly and her allies, and no longer upon Paris and Petersburg; or, if it\r\nwas understood, faith and courage were wanting.\r\n\r\n'\"It was an axiom with Menabrea, with Nigra, with Corti, that Italy and\r\nEngland herself could do nothing in the Mediterranean without France,\r\nstill less do anything against France. The last conversation of Corti with\r\nCrispi shows plainly his conviction that a real alliance of Italy and\r\nEngland was a Utopia. How many times after 1870 had not Italy been\r\ndisappointed in attempts to obtain from England a share of influence in\r\nEgypt! How many times had not Italy been sacrificed to the private\r\narrangements of England with France in Egyptian affairs! How could the\r\nidea that Germany was to replace France in the Eastern policy of Italy and\r\nEngland have entered into the mind of the Cabinet of Rome when it had not\r\nentered into the mind of the Cabinet of St. James's!\r\n\r\n'\"A thousand financial, journalistic, parliamentary connections attached\r\nto France both the Gladstone Cabinet and the Ministry of Mancini--the\r\nlegal counsel of M. de Lesseps. The dream of treble condominium in Egypt\r\nwas strong in Mancini and Depretis, as in Minghetti, Visconti, and\r\nCairoli. This dream was encouraged by the Cabinet of Paris, which kept\r\nItaly in tow by this vain hope, and also by the fear of fresh French\r\nenterprises in Africa, for the French threatened Italy with renewing in\r\nTripoli the precedent of Tunis if Italy broke towards French policy in the\r\nEast the bonds contracted between them in the Crimean War and the treaties\r\nof 1856.\r\n\r\n'\"The reserve, the abstention of Germany and Austria, which Powers\r\npretended to disinterest themselves from the Egyptian question, and opened\r\nto France in Africa a chance of compensation for the loss of Alsace,\r\nhelped to keep Mancini and Depretis, tied also by party connections to the\r\nFrench democracy, in the absurd idea that Italy could keep herself in\r\nstable equilibrium between two alliances--an alliance with Germany in\r\nContinental affairs, and with France in Mediterranean questions. This idea\r\nhad for its result to render unintelligible for the Italian public the\r\nalliance of Italy with the Central Powers, sterilized and perverted\r\nthrough not being boldly applied by Italy to the affairs of the\r\nMediterranean and of the Levant. But once again Italy did not believe\r\nherself strong enough to overcome the indifference which England showed\r\nfor Mediterranean questions--more and more thrown into the background in\r\nEnglish minds by the interests of the British colonial empire in distant\r\nseas. Australia seemed looked upon at London as more important than Turkey\r\nor Egypt itself, and the idea that the first line of defence of India is\r\nat Constantinople, the seat of the Khalifat, seemed forgotten by the\r\nsuccessors of Disraeli. It took seven years for the idea, born in 1881, of\r\nmaking Italy a connecting link in an Anglo-German alliance, to become a\r\npractical one at Home, as it did under Crispi.\r\n\r\n'\"To return to the question of the refusal of Italy to intervene alone\r\nwith England in Egypt in 1882, it is necessary to know that when the\r\nFrench Government was informed of the drawing together of Italy and of the\r\nCentral Powers, France hastened at the end of 1881 to exercise pressure\r\nupon the Mancini-Depretis Cabinet by threatening it, not only with fresh\r\nenterprise in Tripoli, but with direct hostility if Italy took sides\r\nagainst France in those Egyptian affairs which were at that moment\r\nbecoming complicated. The Radical Committees of France and Italy were\r\nthreatening armed movements in the former Papal States, and French money\r\nwas spent in the Italian elections of 1881. The greater part of the\r\nItalian Press was bought up by a Gambetta-Wilson group in such a way that\r\nItalian opinion was directed from Paris by the Italian newspapers, as it\r\nhad already been by the Stefani-Havas Agency. The effect of this\r\npreparation was seen when the bombardment of Alexandria was taken as the\r\ntext for a general opening of fire on the part of the Italian and French\r\nPress against England. When Freycinet refused the English proposal for\r\ntreble intervention, he caused it to be known at Rome that France would\r\nlook upon it as an act of hostility on the part of Italy if that Power\r\nshould take in Egypt the position which belonged to France, and occupy,\r\nwithout France, any portion of Egyptian territory.\r\n\r\n'\"He also used as a bait to Mancini the idea of a treble condominium, by\r\nmaking him believe that Italy and Russia could, by procuring for a treble\r\nintervention the adhesion of the whole concert of European Powers, prevent\r\nit becoming dangerous from the point of view of the two-faced policy of\r\nwhich Germany was suspected at Rome. To act so that France could, without\r\nthe fear of a snare on the part of Germany, intervene in Egypt with Italy\r\nand England--such was the part which France proposed to Mancini that he\r\nshould play, and which he accepted and did play in the Constantinople\r\nconference. The outward and visible sign of this programme was that\r\nwonderful patrol of the Canal which was adopted in principle on the motion\r\nof Corti, and was intended to lead up to the treble condominium by the\r\ntreble occupation of the Suez Canal with a mandate of Europe. 'Success\r\nseemed certain,' funnily declared the Mancini telegrams of the moment,\r\nwhen came the British invitation to Italy for a double intervention.\r\nNeither Menabrea, nor Mancini, nor Corti, took this invitation seriously,\r\nand they saw in it only the hesitation of England, a Power which they\r\nsupposed entirely incapable of such boldness as isolated action. They\r\nnever believed for a moment but that the refusal by Italy of a double\r\nintervention would have for effect a treble occupation. You know how this\r\nillusion of a treble occupation died a wretched death in the ridiculous\r\nappearance of Italian and French ships in the neighbourhood of the Canal\r\njust at the moment when Wolseley seized it before Tel-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\n'\"The same idea of becoming the binding link in Mediterranean affairs, not\r\nbetween Berlin and London, but between Paris and London, continued to\r\nanimate Mancini and Depretis even after England had become the sole power\r\nin occupation of Egypt. The expedition to Massowah in 1885 was an\r\nexpression of this tendency. From the beginning of 1884, in face of the\r\nHicks disaster, of the prolongation of the British occupation, of the\r\nreturn to power of Nubar, France considered a plan for disembarking at\r\nMassowah troops recalled from Tonquin, where she was supposed to be safe\r\nafter the success of Sontay. In order not to leave without some\r\ncounterweight in the Red Sea the consolidation of British domination in\r\nEgypt, France would have returned to Egypt by Massowah and the Soudan.\r\nWhen she decided to suspend this operation, she advised it to Italy as a\r\nmeans of giving expression to the Franco-Italian view of the\r\ninternationality of the Canal and Red Sea. Mancini, whom the Italian\r\nChamber blamed for having not taken part in the colonial fever which had\r\naffected Germany herself in 1884-85, adopted the idea of an expedition to\r\nMassowah at the moment when Wolseley seemed likely to enter Khartoum.'\r\n\r\n'\"We have not as yet been able to get out of this trap in which we are\r\ncaught, and in which the Russians and French try to keep us paralyzed.\r\nCapital and disastrous blunders, evident contradictions with the idea of\r\nthe alliance of Italy with the Central Powers, completed by the\r\nunderstanding with England! But England herself, is she without fault? Is\r\nher Egyptian policy more clear and more strong? Is she not herself in\r\nEgypt also taken in the toils of Franco-Levantine influences, as dominant\r\nat Cairo as they are at Constantinople? It is not on the national and\r\nMohammedan spirit that England in Egypt leans, but on Franco-Levantine\r\ncliques and Graeco-Armenian cliques sold to French finance. Hence the\r\ndecline of British influence in the Levant. The memorandum which I have\r\nsent shows what a different line Italy and England may follow if they do\r\nnot wish the Mediterranean to become a Franco-Russian lake, and the\r\nKhalif, in the character of a new Bey of Tunis, lending the flag of the\r\nProphet to Russia for the conquest of India and to France to complete her\r\nAfrican Empire.\"\r\n\r\n'The memorandum enclosed by him to which he refers was sent by him for the\r\npurpose that it should be communicated by us to friends in Rome who were\r\nlikely to bring it before Crispi, whose Foreign Minister in 1893 Blanc\r\nbecame.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nENTRY INTO THE CABINET\r\nSEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER, 1882\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nPart of Sir Charles's routine was his morning bout of fencing. [Footnote:\r\nSir Charles's fencing seems to have dated from 1874, during his stay in\r\nParis after his first wife's death. Fuller reference to fencing at 76,\r\nSloane Street and to his antagonists will be found in Chapter XLVII. (Vol.\r\nII., pp. 233, 234). ] This was the relaxation which he managed to fit into\r\nhis crowded daily life, but his weekly holiday he spent upon the river. He\r\nnotes, just before the Parliamentary crisis due to the bombardment of\r\nAlexandria:\r\n\r\n    'At this time I had given up the practice of going out of town to stay\r\n    with friends for Sundays, and I did not resume it, for I found it\r\n    better for me to get my work done on the Saturday night and my Foreign\r\n    Office boxes early on the Sunday morning, to go to the Abbey on the\r\n    Sunday morning at ten, and after this service to go on the river, and\r\n    go to bed at eight o'clock at least this one night in the week, and I\r\n    bought a piece of land at Dumsey Deep, near Chertsey, with the view of\r\n    building a cottage there.'\r\n\r\nIt was not here, however, that he built his riverside house, but close by,\r\nat Dockett Eddy, which he bought in the following summer. [Footnote: A\r\nfuller account of life in his riverside home is to be found in Chapter LI.\r\n(Vol. II., pp. 317-324).] The two pieces of ground were connected by a\r\nlong strip of frontage which he acquired, thereby saving the willows and\r\nalders which then sheltered that reach, and made it a windless course for\r\nsculling. Even more perfect was it, by reason of its gravelly bottom, for\r\nanother form of watermanship. On Sunday, October 22nd, 1882,\r\n\r\n    'after Westminster Abbey I went down to Teddington, and took a lesson\r\n    in punting from Kemp, the Teddington fisherman, and from this time\r\n    forward became devoted to the art, for which I gave up my canoeing.'\r\n\r\nHis resolve to spend his Sundays in retreat on the river did not pass\r\nwithout protest from his friends, as is shown by a characteristic letter\r\nfrom Sir William Harcourt:\r\n\r\n    \"CUFFNELLS, LYNDHURST,\r\n    \"_August 28_, 1882.\"\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR DILKE,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Don't be an odious solitary snipe in the ooze of the Thames, but come\r\n    down here at once and nurse Bobby.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours ever, W. V. H.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bobby\" was Mr. Robert Harcourt, now M.P. for the Montrose Burghs.\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n    \"LALEHAM FERRY (_for this night only.\r\n    I shall be at the P.O. every day this week_).\r\n    \"_August 29th._\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR HARCOURT,\r\n\r\n    \"I went to bed on Saty. night at dark and on Sunday night at dark.\r\n    Last night I was late from London, and sat up till nearly 9! Bobby\r\n    himself can hardly beat that, can he? On the other hand, he does not\r\n    get a swim in the Thames at 5 a.m., or breakfast at 6, as I do.\r\n\r\n    \"It is very good of you--and like old times--for you to press me to\r\n    come down, and, believe me, I should like my company. But when, as\r\n    now, I am splendidly well, and only want to make up arrears of sleep,\r\n    the river is the best place for me. I shall go to Walmer next week,\r\n    but then that is sea, and sea is sleepy too; and I have all my work\r\n    there with the telegraph in the House, and messengers four times a day\r\n    as if I was in the F.O., so I can be away--and yet be on duty--as I\r\n    promised to be till 19th or 20th Septr....\r\n\r\n    \"... This is the longest letter that I was ever known to write in all\r\n    my life, except perhaps once or twice to you in the old days.\"\r\n\r\nIt had now been decided that Wentworth Dilke, being eight years old,\r\nshould go to school and leave Mr. Chamberlain's house, of which he had\r\nbeen an inmate for some eighteen months.\r\n\r\n    'On the day of Tel-el-Kebir I received a very pleasing letter from\r\n    Chamberlain, thanking me for what I had said to him about his\r\n    reception for so long a period at Highbury of my son. It was a\r\n    touching letter, which showed both delicacy and warmth of affection.'\r\n\r\nOn September 21st Sir Charles Dilke went to Birmingham to take his boy to\r\nMrs. Maclaren's school at Summerfields, near Oxford. 'Then crossing to\r\nWaterford, spent five days in the South of Ireland--and afterwards went\r\nstraight to St. Tropez to stay with M. Émile Ollivier.' \"Il faut fermer la\r\nboutique et alors on se trouve tout de suite bien,\" is his comment as he\r\nstarted on one such journey.\r\n\r\n    'During my visit to Ollivier I explored the south coast of the\r\n    mountains of the Moors, along which there was no road, and bought some\r\n    land at Cavalaire, against the possible chance of a boulevard being\r\n    made through my land at Toulon in such a way as to cut me off from the\r\n    sea. I walked from Bormes to the Lavandou upon the coast, and fancied\r\n    I found the path by which St. Francis journeyed when he landed to save\r\n    Provence from the plague. It is hollowed out by feet, in some places\r\n    to three feet deep through the hard quartz and schist, and everywhere\r\n    at least six inches, so its age is evidently great, and it must have\r\n    been a path in the days of Saracen domination, if not even in or\r\n    before the Roman times, for the two villages were ever small.\r\n\r\n    'At Ste. Claire, the first bay eastward from the Lavandou, I had seen\r\n    a funeral in which all the crucifixes were borne before the corpse by\r\n    women, and the coffin carried by women. Ollivier's father was still\r\n    living--Démosthène, born under the First Republic, and a deputy under\r\n    the Second: an old Jacobin of an almost extinct type. Ollivier's house\r\n    is as pretty as the whole coast. It stands on a peninsula with perfect\r\n    sands, one or other of which is sheltered for bathing in any wind, and\r\n    instead of the usual parched sterility of Provence, springs rise all\r\n    round the house, which is lost in a dense forest of young palms. The\r\n    views are not from the house, but from the various shores of the\r\n    peninsula, all these, however, being close at hand. I had for escort\r\n    in my trips about the coast the famous Félix Martin, founder and Mayor\r\n    of St. Raphael and of Valescure, a railway engineer who was known as\r\n    the American of Provence, and who, in fact, is the most desperate and\r\n    the most interesting and pleasant speculator of France. Speaking to me\r\n    of Fréjus, my favourite town, and its surroundings, Martin called it\r\n    \"the Roman Campagna on the Bay of Naples,\" a very pretty phrase,\r\n    absolutely true of it, for the scenery is that of the plain between\r\n    Naples and Capua, but the ruins and the solemnity of the foreground\r\n    were those of the outskirts of Rome till Martin spoilt it. At the spot\r\n    where I bought my land eighty boats of Spanish and Italian coral\r\n    fishers were at anchor. I picked up Roman tiles upon my ground, and\r\n    found a Roman tomb in the centre of my plot.'\r\n\r\n    'I was struck with some of the old châteaux in the woods as I returned\r\n    along the coast to Toulon. Near Bormettes there are two which were\r\n    nationalized at the Revolution, and the families of the buyers, having\r\n    turned Legitimist and put stained glass into the chapel windows, are\r\n    now becoming nobles in their turn, at all events in their own\r\n    estimation, and thriving upon cork and American vines.[Footnote: The\r\n    piece of land at Cavalaire was never built on by Sir Charles, but he\r\n    remained owner of it till 1905, when it was sold by him. His\r\n    friendship with the Ollivier household continued till the end of his\r\n    life.]\r\n\r\n    'It was during this visit that Ollivier made use of a phrase which I\r\n    have repeated: \"When one looks at the Republic one says: 'It can't\r\n    last a week--it is dead.' But when one looks at what is opposed to it,\r\n    one says: 'It is eternal.'\"'\r\n\r\nThe true inner history and genesis of the Franco-Prussian War formed\r\nmatter for talk with Ollivier, who was among the half-dozen men in Europe\r\nbest able to inform Sir Charles on the question. The Memoir records a\r\nreminiscence told by M. Ollivier.\r\n\r\n    'When the war broke out, he naturally asked the Emperor about his\r\n    alliances. The Emperor, who was singularly sweet and winning in his\r\n    ways, smiled his best smile but said nothing, walked to a table,\r\n    unlocked a drawer, and took out two letters-one from the Emperor of\r\n    Austria, and the other from the King of Italy, both promising their\r\n    alliance. But, although this was Ollivier's story, the Italian letter\r\n    must have been conditional. Ollivier set down the defeat to this\r\n    slowness of action, and supineness, due first to the Emperor's firm\r\n    belief that Austria would move, and then to his stone in the bladder\r\n    and refusal to let anyone else command. At a later date I became aware\r\n    of the true story, which was that afterwards told by me in\r\n    _Cosmopolis_. [Footnote: \"The Origin of the War of 1870,\" by Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke, _Cosmopolis_, January, 1896.] Austria had declined to\r\n    join in a war begun in the middle of the summer. It had been fixed for\r\n    May, 1871. Bismarck found this out from the Magyars, and made the war\r\n    in 1870.'\r\n\r\nTo the detail thus gained at first hand Sir Charles Dilke added another in\r\nthe next year. On February 1st, 1883, he met at Sir William Harcourt's\r\nhouse the Italian Ambassador Count Nigra, who had been in 1870 Minister in\r\nParis:\r\n\r\n    'He told me that in 1866 the Italians had sent to Paris to ask whether\r\n    they should join Prussia or Austria, both of whom had promised to give\r\n    them Venice, and how the Emperor had told them that Italy was to join\r\n    Prussia as the weaker side, and that when the combatants were\r\n    exhausted he intended to take the Rhine. Nigra also told me that in\r\n    1870 the Emperor had told him that he meant peace, and that it was\r\n    Gramont on his own account who had told Benedetti to get from the King\r\n    of Prussia the promise for the future. This was all superficial, as we\r\n    now know that Nigra was, as the Empress Eugénie said in 1907, a \"false\r\n    friend.\" Nigra said that Bismarck had made the war by telegraphing his\r\n    own highly coloured account of the interview; for the French official\r\n    account, which had only reached Paris (according to Nigra) after war\r\n    had been declared, had shown that the King had been very civil to\r\n    Benedetti, although the French Ambassador had persisted in raising the\r\n    question no less than three several times.... [Footnote: The famous\r\n    interview at Ems between the King of Prussia and M. Benedetti, the\r\n    French Ambassador at Berlin, is referred to. See Benedetti, _Ma\r\n    Mission en Prusse_, chap. vi.; _Bismarck, His Reflections and\r\n    Reminiscences_, translated from the German under the supervision of A.\r\n    J. Butler, vol. ii., chap, xxii.; _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., chap.\r\n    ii.]\r\n\r\n    'On my return through Paris in September, 1882, I had interviews with\r\n    Duclerc, the French Prime Minister, and with Nubar, as well as with\r\n    Gambetta. Duclerc I found a cross old man, who was furious because I\r\n    mentioned Madagascar. On the Tunis capitulations I found the French\r\n    willing to come to an agreement; but Egypt, the Suez Canal, the Congo,\r\n    the Pacific Islands, and Newfoundland were all of them difficult\r\n    questions at this time....\r\n\r\n    'In a talk with Gambetta on October 19th he said to me that it was his\r\n    intention, \"whether _I_ liked Duclerc or not,\" to keep him in power,\r\n    whether he does what he ought, does nothing, or does what is\r\n    ridiculous. The curse of France is instability. Duclerc is an honest\r\n    man.' Gambetta was 'aged and in bad spirits.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles communicated this expression through Mr. Plunkett, the British\r\nChargé d'Affaires, to M. Duclerc. \"I gave him the third alternative in\r\nmore diplomatic language,\" Mr. Plunkett wrote, \"but he understood me, and\r\nwe laughed over the idea.\"\r\n\r\nA general reflection of this year is that 'Gambetta hates fools in theory,\r\nand loves them, I think, in practice.'\r\n\r\nIn London during the autumn session Sir Charles records some interesting\r\ngossip, to which may be added this first entry of earlier date:\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville was a most able man, who did not, in my opinion,\r\n    decline in intellectual vigour during the many years in which he took\r\n    a great part in public affairs. He always had the habit of\r\n    substitution of words, and I have known him carry on a long\r\n    conversation with me at the Foreign Office about the proceedings of\r\n    two Ambassadors who were engaged on opposite sides in a great\r\n    negotiation, and call \"A\" B, and \"B\" A through the whole of it, which\r\n    was, to say the least of it, confusing. He also sometimes entirely\r\n    forgot the principal name in connection with the subject--as, for\r\n    example, that of Mr. Gladstone when Prime Minister--and had to resort\r\n    to the most extraordinary forms of language in order to convey his\r\n    meaning. The only other person in whom I have ever seen this\r\n    peculiarity carried to such a point was the Khedive Ismail, who sent\r\n    for me when I was in office and he in London, and when the Dervishes\r\n    were advancing upon Egypt, to say that he had an important piece of\r\n    information to give the Government, which was the name of a spot at\r\n    which the Dervishes might easily be checked, owing to the narrowness\r\n    of the valley. He kept working up to the name, and each time failing\r\n    to give it, so that I ultimately went away without having been able to\r\n    get from him the one thing which would have made the information\r\n    useful. Each time he closed his speech by saying, \"Le nom de ce point\r\n    important est--chose--machine--chose,\" and so on...\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, November 2nd, I breakfasted with Mr. Gladstone to meet\r\n    the Duc de Broglie. We discussed the question of the authorship of the\r\n    pretty definition of Liberal-Conservatives as men who sometimes think\r\n    right, but always vote wrong. But even Arthur Russell, who was at the\r\n    breakfast with his wife, could throw no light upon the matter. Madame\r\n    Olga Novikof was also present, and, of course, the Duc de Broglie took\r\n    me into a corner to ask me if it was true that Mr. Gladstone was\r\n    absolutely under her influence. She announced her intention of going\r\n    the next day to Birmingham, and Mr. Gladstone asked Chamberlain to go\r\n    with her, although he did not know her and although there was a\r\n    Cabinet; but Chamberlain refused.\r\n\r\n    'In the evening of November 15th there dined with me John Morley, Lord\r\n    Arthur Russell, and Gibson, afterwards Lord Ashbourne, Huxley, the\r\n    Rector of Lincoln, and some others; and, thanks to Gibson, who was\r\n    very lively, the conversation was better than such things often are.\r\n    He was deep in the secrets of Randolph Churchill...\r\n\r\n    'I was asked from 24th to 27th to stay with the Duke and Duchess of\r\n    Edinburgh at Eastwell Park, but was also asked to Sandringham.\r\n\r\n    'The Princess of Wales told me a story of the Shah which had amused\r\n    her. Walking with her at the State Ball, he had clutched her arm, and\r\n    with much excitement asked about the Highland costume which he had\r\n    seen for the first time. Having thus got the word \"Écossais\" into his\r\n    head, and afterwards seeing Beust with his legs in pink silk\r\n    stockings, he again clutched her, and exclaimed: \"Trop nu--plus nu\r\n    qu'Écossais.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe business of the autumn Session was limited, by agreement, to\r\ndetermining the new \"Rules of Procedure.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, October 20th, there was a Cabinet which decided to stick\r\n    to our first resolution on procedure--that is on the closure--without\r\n    change; or, in other words, to closure by a bare majority.'\r\n\r\nWhen the matter came to a vote in the House, the Government were saved\r\nfrom defeat by the support of Mr. Parnell and his adherents, who were\r\ndetermined not to have closure by a two-thirds majority, which could in\r\npractice be used only against a small group.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, October 23rd, the Cabinet considered the principle of\r\n    delegation of duties from Parliament itself to Grand Committees, to be\r\n    proposed in the procedure resolutions.'\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of what is now the ordinary procedure in all Bills,\r\nexcept those of the first importance. It was introduced expressly as an\r\nexperiment on six months' trial; and it appears that it was not adopted\r\nwithout much opposition in the Cabinet, for the Memoir records:\r\n\r\n    'On November 21st Hartington and Harcourt tried hard to induce Mr.\r\n    Gladstone to drop his idea of Grand Committees, and I noted in my\r\n    diary: \"If they are dropped now they are dead for ever--that is, for a\r\n    year at least. 'Ever' in politics means one year.\"'\r\n\r\nOn November 13th Lord Randolph Churchill, in a discourse upon the right to\r\nmake motions for adjournment, contrived, by way of happy illustration, to\r\nrefer to the \"Kilmainham Treaty.\" The phrase in itself was a red rag to\r\nMr. Gladstone, but Lord Randolph added to the provocation by describing it\r\nas \"a most disgraceful transaction, so obnoxious that its precise terms\r\nhad never been made known.\" Mr. Gladstone charged fiercely at the lure,\r\ndenied that there had been any \"treaty,\" and challenged the Opposition to\r\nmove for a Committee of Inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn November 14th, between two meetings at Lord Granville's house, at which\r\n'Kimberley, Northbrook, Carlingford, and Childers were present with\r\nmyself, there was a discussion at lunch as to Mr. Gladstone's promise of a\r\nCommittee on the Kilmainham Treaty, at which all his colleagues of the\r\nCabinet were furious.'\r\n\r\nOn November 16th:\r\n\r\n    'a Cabinet was suddenly called for this afternoon to consider Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's extraordinary blunder in granting a Committee on the\r\n    Treaty of Kilmainham. The whole of his colleagues had been against him\r\n    when he had previously wished to do it, and now he had done it without\r\n    asking one of them. Grosvenor, the Whip, thought it would upset the\r\n    Government. Mr. Gladstone expressed his regret to his colleagues that\r\n    he had been carried away by his temper. Harcourt said that no two of\r\n    the witnesses would give the same account of the transaction, and that\r\n    while Mr. Gladstone might force Chamberlain, as his subordinate, to\r\n    make a clean breast of it, it was hard on Parnell.\r\n\r\n    'There was later in the day a private conversation between Chamberlain\r\n    and Harcourt and Grosvenor as to the Kilmainham Committee, Chamberlain\r\n    declaring that if called before a Committee he must read all the\r\n    letters, and Harcourt saying that if they were read he should resign.'\r\n\r\nWhen the Session opened on October 27th, the Memoir indicates that the\r\nPrime Minister's retirement was expected.\r\n\r\nOn November 4th there was a dinner at 76, Sloane Street, at which Mr.\r\nGladstone, Lord Granville, the Dean of Westminster, Mr. Balfour, and\r\nothers, came to meet the Duc de Broglie. In the course of the evening,\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone told me that he had finally decided not to meet\r\n    Parliament again in February. The gossip was that Hartington was to be\r\n    Prime Minister, that Fawcett would resign if not put into the Cabinet,\r\n    and Chamberlain and I had agreed to insist on county franchise '(which\r\n    meant a very large extension of the suffrage),' and to withdraw our\r\n    opposition to Goschen, it being understood that he gave way on county\r\n    franchise. It was far from certain that Mr. Gladstone meant Hartington\r\n    to be leader on his retirement. The Duchess of Manchester had told me\r\n    just before my dinner on Saturday, November 4th, that Mr. Gladstone\r\n    had written to Lord Granville to tell him he should not meet\r\n    Parliament again, saying that he wrote to him as he had been leader\r\n    when the party had been in Opposition. The letter had been shown to\r\n    Hartington, who was much irritated at the phrase. The letter was also\r\n    sent on to the Queen, and the Duchess thought that the Queen had said\r\n    in reply that if Mr. Gladstone resigned she should send not for Lord\r\n    Granville, but for Hartington.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, November 6th, I heard more about the proposed resignation\r\n    of Mr. Gladstone. He had declared that he would not take a peerage,\r\n    but had promised not to attend the House of Commons, and I thought\r\n    that Hartington would make his going to the Lords, or at least leaving\r\n    the Commons, a condition. I pressed for the inclusion of Courtney in\r\n    the Cabinet in the event of any change.'\r\n\r\nAlthough one of Mr. Gladstone's junior colleagues from 1880 onwards, Sir\r\nCharles Dilke had been frequently in disagreement with him, and in 1882\r\nhad refused to accept the Irish Secretaryship. Yet it was to Sir Charles\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone in 1882 was beginning to look as his ultimate successor\r\nin the lead of the House of Commons. A passage in Lord Acton's\r\ncorrespondence shows how Mr. Gladstone's mind was working at this time. A\r\nbreakfast-table discussion between Miss Gladstone and her father is noted\r\nby her, at which, on the assumption of Mr. Gladstone's retirement and the\r\nremoval of Lord Hartington to the House of Lords, the names of possible\r\nsuccessors to the leadership of the House of Commons were discussed. The\r\nChief's estimate of Dilke was thus given:\r\n\r\n    \"The future leader of H. of C. was a great puzzle and difficulty. Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke would probably be the man best fitted for it; he had\r\n    shown much capacity for learning and unlearning, but he would require\r\n    Cabinet training first.\" [Footnote: _Letters of Lord Acton_, p. 90.]\r\n\r\nIt followed, then, that if Mr. Gladstone seriously contemplated\r\nresignation, he was bound to insure that Sir Charles got without more\r\ndelay the \"Cabinet training.\" It was absurd that the Minister in whom Mr.\r\nGladstone saw the likeliest future leader of the House of Commons should\r\nbe kept technically, and to some extent really, outside the inner circle\r\nof confidence and responsibility.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of November the hint of Mr. Gladstone's retirement had\r\nleaked out, and conjecture was busy with reconstruction of the Cabinet.\r\nApart from the question of the Prime Minister's position, speculation was\r\nkept active by the fact that since Mr. Bright's retirement in June no\r\nappointment had been made to the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster,\r\nthat office having no very urgent or definite duties. There was also the\r\nwidespread feeling that Sir Charles Dilke's admission to the Cabinet was\r\noverdue, and men guessed rightly at the cause of the delay. Meanwhile the\r\nleaders of the party were considering how far these causes still operated.\r\nOn November 16th Sir Charles was approached by the Chief Whip.\r\n\r\n    'Lord R. Grosvenor, after the Cabinet, came to me, and asked me if I\r\n    thought that the Queen was now willing to have me in the Cabinet. I\r\n    said that so far as I knew the trouble was at an end. He replied that\r\n    he had had two accounts of it. Harcourt told him that both the Prince\r\n    of Wales and Prince Leopold had said that she had made up her mind to\r\n    take me; but Hartington said that she had told him a different story.\r\n    I said I did not know which was right; but that she could take me or\r\n    leave me, for not another word would I say.\r\n\r\n    'Sunday, November 19th, I spent at Cuffnells, Lyndhurst--the home of\r\n    \"Alice in Wonderland,\" Mrs. Hargreaves, Dean Liddel's daughter--with\r\n    the Harcourts, and Harcourt told me that he believed in Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's retirement.'\r\n\r\nIn the last days of November Sir Charles was at Sandringham with Mr.\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain told me that Lord Hartington and Lord Granville were\r\n    going to insist with Mr. Gladstone that he should stay as nominal\r\n    Prime Minister, Hartington taking the Exchequer and dividing the lead\r\n    of the House with him, and Rosebery and I being put into the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    'On December 1st there was a Cabinet, before which Lord Granville told\r\n    me that I was to be put into the Cabinet at once if the Queen\r\n    consented. When they met at two o'clock the Cabinet were told of this\r\n    and strict secrecy sworn, but two of them immediately came and told me\r\n    that it was settled I was to be Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.'\r\n\r\nThe Chancellorship of the Duchy presented itself to Sir Charles Dilke as a\r\nkind of roving commission to help other Ministers with the detail of\r\nmeasures. But the Queen took the view that this place was a \"peculiarly\r\npersonal one,\" and should be held by someone whom she considered a\r\n\"moderate\" politician, and who need not be in the Cabinet. On December 4th\r\n\r\n    'the Queen, who had been informed that she was still a free agent with\r\n    regard to me, had hesitated with regard to the Duchy of Lancaster,\r\n    which had, of course, been conditionally accepted by me on the\r\n    understanding that I was to be man-of-all-work in the Cabinet. It was\r\n    understood on this day that Childers was to be Chancellor of the\r\n    Exchequer if his health allowed it, and a delay was granted for his\r\n    decision or that of his doctors; and it was understood that Lord Derby\r\n    was to come in in Childers' place. Evelyn Ashley was suggested for my\r\n    place; and Edmond Fitzmaurice, Henry Brand, or Brett for Ashley's'\r\n    (that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade).\r\n\r\nOn December 7th it was settled that\r\n\r\n    'Hartington was to go to the War Office if the doctors pronounced\r\n    Childers well enough to take the Exchequer, and this would leave the\r\n    Under-Secretaryships for the Colonies and India, as well as for\r\n    Foreign Affairs, open between Fitzmaurice, Ashley, Brand, and Brett.\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt wrote on the 7th about Mr. Gladstone: \"The resignation\r\n    project is for the present adjourned _sine die_.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, December 9th, Childers came to me from Mr. Gladstone to\r\n    ask if I objected (as we had settled that it would be improper for me\r\n    to invite a contest in Chelsea on the old register in the last month\r\n    of the year) to letting my appointment be known before it was made,\r\n    and I consented, although this would have had the effect, in the event\r\n    of opposition, of giving me a twenty days' fight instead of one of\r\n    only seventeen.'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone now put forward a different proposal:\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, the 11th, I saw the Prince of Wales with regard to my\r\n    appointment. On the same day Mr. Gladstone had some trouble with the\r\n    Queen about the Primacy, as he told me on December 12th.... On the\r\n    12th I wrote to Chamberlain that Austin Lee had told me that the Queen\r\n    had some days earlier told our friend Prince Leopold that she was\r\n    willing that I should be in the Cabinet, but not in the Duchy, and it\r\n    was this that she had said to Mr. Gladstone on the 11th about which he\r\n    sent for me on the 12th. He said that he thought it would be possible\r\n    to get over this objection in time, but that there was another\r\n    possibility about which he asked me to write to Chamberlain, but not\r\n    as from him. I wrote: \"Would you take the Duchy and let me go to the\r\n    Board of Trade, you keeping your Bills? This would be unpleasant to\r\n    you personally, I feel sure, unless for my sake, though the Duchy is\r\n    of superior rank. It would, of course, be a temporary stopgap, as\r\n    there must be other changes soon. It is not necessary that you should\r\n    do it, else I know that you would do it for me. So that please feel\r\n    you are really free. I told Mr. Gladstone that I could only put it to\r\n    you in such a way as to leave you free. You had better perhaps write\r\n    your answer so that I can show it him, though I suppose he will\r\n    suppose himself not to have seen it!\"'\r\n\r\nOn December 13th the Prince of Wales sent for Sir Charles to advise his\r\npressing this course on Mr. Chamberlain. But on that same day Mr.\r\nChamberlain replied from Highbury:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR DILKE,\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter has spoilt my breakfast. The change will be loathsome to\r\n    me for more than one reason, and will give rise to all sorts of\r\n    disagreeable commentaries. But if it is the only way out of the\r\n    difficulty, I will do what I am sure you would have done in my place--\r\n    accept the transfer. I enclose a note to this effect which you can\r\n    show to Mr. G. Consider, however, if there is any alternative. I\r\n    regard your _immediate_ admission to the Cabinet as imperative, and\r\n    therefore if this can only be secured by my taking the Duchy, _cadit\r\n    quaestio_, and I shall never say another word on the subject. Two\r\n    other courses are possible, though I fear unlikely to be accepted: (1)\r\n    Mr. Gladstone might tell the Queen that I share the opinions you have\r\n    expressed with regard to the dowries, and intend to make common cause\r\n    with you--that if your appointment is refused I shall leave the\r\n    Government, and that the effect will be to alienate the Radical Party\r\n    from the Ministry and the Crown, and to give prominence to a question\r\n    which it would be more prudent to allow to slumber. I think the Queen\r\n    would give way. If not we should both go out. We should stand very\r\n    well with our party, and in a year or two we could make our own terms.\r\n    Personally I would rather go out than take the Duchy.... (2) Has the\r\n    matter been mentioned to Dodson? He _might_ like an office with less\r\n    work, [Footnote: Mr. Dodson was President of the Local Government\r\n    Board.] and he _might_ be influenced by the nominally superior\r\n    rank.... Now you have my whole mind. I would gladly avoid the\r\n    sacrifice, but if your inclusion in the Cabinet depends upon it, I\r\n    will make it freely and with pleasure for your sake.\"\r\n\r\n    'The result was that Dodson \"put himself in Mr. Gladstone's hands.\"\r\n    There was, however, an interval of ten days, during which things went\r\n    backwards and forwards much.'\r\n\r\nThe probability of the Queen's refusal to accept Mr. Chamberlain for the\r\nDuchy made his threat of resignation more serious, and a letter came to\r\nSir Charles from Mr. Francis Knollys deprecating this vehemently on behalf\r\nof the Prince of Wales. Its last sentence is worth quoting, as it endorsed\r\nwhat was known to be Dilke's own special wish:\r\n\r\n    \"What he would like to see would be Lord Northbrook at the India\r\n    Office and you at the Admiralty.\"\r\n\r\n    'On December 14th I saw Mr. Gladstone, but a new opening had arisen,\r\n    for Fawcett was very ill, and supposed to be dying, and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    determined to wait for a few days to see whether he got better....\r\n\r\n    'On December 16th Mr. Gladstone pledged himself to me in writing with\r\n    regard to putting me immediately into the Cabinet in some place, and\r\n    on December 17th the Queen agreed that a paragraph to that effect\r\n    should be sent to the newspapers. On the 18th, however, she declined\r\n    to entertain the question of taking Chamberlain for the Duchy. On\r\n    December 20th Mr. Gladstone wrote that he was \"between the devil and\r\n    the deep sea.\" I do not know which of the two meant the Queen, and\r\n    whether the other was myself or Chamberlain. On December 21st\r\n    Chamberlain came up to town to see me. On the 22nd the Dodson plan\r\n    went forward in letters from Mr. Gladstone to Sir Henry Ponsonby, the\r\n    Queen's Secretary, and from Lord Hartington, to the Queen. On the 22nd\r\n    at night Dodson accepted it, and on the 23rd I was formally so\r\n    informed, and virtually accepted the Presidency of the Local\r\n    Government Board, which I nominally accepted on December 26th.'\r\n\r\nBefore Sir Charles vacated the seat by his letter of acceptance, the\r\nTories in Chelsea had met and decided not to oppose him. Among the letters\r\nof congratulation none gratified the new Minister more than one from Lord\r\nBarrington, Lord Beaconsfield's former private secretary, who wrote, even\r\nbefore the appointment was officially confirmed:\r\n\r\n    \"I like watching your political career as, besides personal feeling,\r\n    it makes me think of what my dear old chief used to say about you--\r\n    that you were _the_ rising man on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 27th Lord Granville sent from Walmer Castle a letter of\r\ncharacteristic courtesy and charm.[Footnote: The letter given in Chapter\r\nXX., p. 311.] It crossed an expression of gratitude already despatched by\r\nhis junior:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR LORD GRANVILLE,\r\n\r\n    \"Having received Mr. Gladstone's letter with the Queen's approval, I\r\n    write to thank you for all your many kindnesses to me while I have\r\n    been under your orders. I shall continue to attend the office until\r\n    the Council, but I cannot let the day close without trying to express\r\n    in one word all that I owe to you as regards the last thirty-two\r\n    months.\r\n\r\n    \"Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES W. DILKE.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was much later, when the Government had fallen, that this \"one\r\nword\" came to be developed.\r\n\r\n    \"76, SLOANE STREET, S.W.\r\n    \"_Tuesday, July 14th_, 1885.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR LORD GRANVILLE,\r\n\r\n    \"I am glad you feel as you do about me. Malicious people and foolish\r\n    people have both so long said that I wanted to be S. of S. for For.\r\n    Affs. myself that I never expect to be believed when I say the simple\r\n    truth--that in my opinion it ought to be in the Lords as long as there\r\n    are Lords, and that my only wish was to be of any help I could. I can\r\n    only think of the Errington-Walsh business when I think over points on\r\n    which we have differed, and I cannot help scoring that down to Forster\r\n    and the silly Irish Government, and not to you, though you are so\r\n    loyal a colleague that when you have accepted you always actively\r\n    support.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not suppose I shall ever, if again in office, have such pleasant\r\n    official days as those I spent in the F.O. under you, but the next\r\n    best thing would be at the Admiralty--the office to which all my life\r\n    has always inclined me--to obey your orders from the F.O.\r\n\r\n    \"I am sure you will believe this even if no one else will, and believe\r\n    me also ever\r\n\r\n    \"Yours very affectionately and sincerely,\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES W. DILKE.\"\r\n\r\n'Trevelyan, in sending his congratulations from the Chief Secretary's\r\nOffice at Dublin, asked me for the earliest possible draft of heads of my\r\nLocal Government Bill for England: \"in case it is settled that we are to\r\nbring one in--a move which I have come to think is necessary. They need\r\nnot run on all fours, but there are points on which it would not do to\r\nadopt a different policy.\"'\r\n\r\nTo the Secretary of State's congratulations, Sir Julian Pauncefote,\r\npermanent head of the Foreign Office staff, added his tribute:\r\n\r\n    \"How we all deplore your departure, _none so much as myself_. You will\r\n    leave behind you a lasting memory of your kindness and geniality, and\r\n    of your great talents.\"\r\n\r\nOther friends, among them Mr. Knollys, assumed as a matter of course that\r\nthe promotion would bring a change from congenial to uncongenial work.\r\nThey were right. \"I shall be in the Local Government Board by Wednesday,\r\nas I shan't, after Chamberlain's kindness, put him in a place which he\r\nwill like less than the Board of Trade. Shan't I hate it after this\r\nplace!\" Sir Charles Dilke wrote. \"But,\" he added, \"it will 'knock the\r\nnonsense out of me.'\" That was the view put to him, for instance, by Lord\r\nBarrington. \"In the end it is well that a Minister should go through the\r\ncomparative drudgery of other offices. It gets him 'out of a groove.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, on making what Sir Charles Dilke calls 'the formal\r\nannouncement' on December 23rd, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Notwithstanding the rubs of the past, I am sanguine as to your future\r\n    relations with the Queen. There are undoubtedly many difficulties in\r\n    that quarter, but they are in the main confined to three or four\r\n    departments. Your office will not touch them, while you will have in\r\n    common with all your colleagues the benefit of two great modifying\r\n    circumstances which never fail--the first her high good manners, and\r\n    the second her love of truth....\r\n\r\n    \"I have entered on these explanations, because it is my fervent\r\n    desire, on every ground, to reduce difficulties in such high and\r\n    delicate matters to their minimum; and because, with the long years\r\n    which I hope you have before you, I also earnestly desire that your\r\n    start should be favourable in your relations with the Sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written only a few weeks after the Prime Minister had spoken to\r\nhis intimates of Dilke as some day his probable successor in the\r\nleadership of the House of Commons. Mr. Gladstone did not omit to urge\r\nthat the new Minister should do his best to conciliate good-will. The\r\nQueen, he said, \"looked with some interest or even keenness to the words\r\nof explanation as to the distant past,\" which Sir Charles himself had--\r\n\"not in any way as a matter of bargain, but as a free tender\"--proposed to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThey were guarded. In an address delivered at Kensington before his re-\r\nelection, he dwelt almost exclusively on questions of Local Government,\r\nand coming to the Government of London, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"There were very many subjects upon which one might modify one's\r\n    opinions as one grew older; there were opinions of political infancy\r\n    which, as one grew older, one might regard as unwise, or might prefer\r\n    not to have uttered; but upon the Government of London--the opinions\r\n    he expressed in 1867 were his personal opinions at the present time.\"\r\n\r\nThis and the closing admission that when he first came before the electors\r\nof Chelsea, he \"was only between three-and four-and-twenty years of age,\r\nand was perhaps at that time rather scatter-brained,\" are all the\r\nallusions to the remote past which the speech contains; but there is every\r\nreason to believe that it was taken as satisfactory. Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\nthat the comments of the Conservative press, which were pretty certain to\r\nbe read at Osborne, would be useful. Finally, \"to integrate their\r\ncorrespondence,\" he added this reference to Sir Charles's known wish for\r\nthe Admiralty:\r\n\r\n    \"I passed over the suggestion about clearing the Admiralty (_a_) from\r\n    reluctance to start Northbrook's removal to any less efficient place;\r\n    (_b_) on account of Parliamentary displacements; not at all because it\r\n    was too big a place to vacate and offer.\"\r\n\r\n'All the same,' the Memoir adds, 'I liked the L.G.B.'\r\n\r\nThe change of office did not mean any severance from foreign policy, which\r\nSir Charles could now approach in his proper sphere, with the authority of\r\na Cabinet Minister. He was succeeded by Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, who had\r\nreturned from his mission to Constantinople. Dilke wrote on December 23rd\r\nto Lord Granville: \"I should suggest that no time be lost in getting\r\nFitzmaurice here. He likes work, and will go at these matters like a\r\nlion.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the last day of the old year Lord Granville, writing from Walmer\r\n    to thank me for what I had said about him to my constituents, added:\r\n    \"I have given the sack to ---- at the end of the five years' limit\r\n    which now expires. He would like to keep the appointment on leave for\r\n    six months, and might be very useful in advising the office. But would\r\n    there be any House of Commons objection to this prolongation?\" This\r\n    was a specimen of the way in which, after I had left the Foreign\r\n    Office, all Foreign Office questions were still thrown on to me; and\r\n    as a matter of fact I did almost as much Foreign Office work during\r\n    the year 1883 as I had done from 1880 to 1882. Fitzmaurice, however,\r\n    was able, and worked very hard, and he gradually acquired an enormous\r\n    mastery of the detail of the questions.' [Footnote: Sir Charles notes\r\n    how glad he was to induce Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice to continue Mr.\r\n    Austin Lee in the post of official private secretary.]\r\n\r\nHis unopposed return for Chelsea did not take place till January 8th,\r\n1883. Before this he had been formally admitted to the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n    'I had left the Foreign Office on December 27th, having been there\r\n    exactly two years and eight months, and on Thursday, the 28th, I went\r\n    down to a Council at Osborne to be sworn; and on the 29th addressed\r\n    the principal meeting held in my constituency with regard to my re-\r\n    election, and advocated a policy of decentralization in Local\r\n    Government affairs. I was rather amused at Osborne by the\r\n    punctiliousness with which, after I had kissed hands on being sworn a\r\n    member of the Council, the Queen pointed out to the Clerk of the\r\n    Council that it was necessary for me again to immediately go through\r\n    precisely the same ceremony on appointment as President of the Local\r\n    Government Board--a curious point of strict etiquette. I could not but\r\n    think that the portion of the Privy Councillor's oath which concerns\r\n    keeping secret matters treated of secretly in Council is more honoured\r\n    in the breach than in the observance; but when Mr. Gladstone chose,\r\n    which was not always, he used to maintain the view that the clause is\r\n    governed by the first part of the oath, so as to make it secret only\r\n    in respect of the interests of the country and the position of other\r\n    members of Council. There is nothing in the oath about any limit of\r\n    time, but it has always been held in practice that a time comes when\r\n    all political importance has departed from the proceedings of the\r\n    Council, and when the obligation of secrecy may be held to lapse.\r\n    There is nothing, however, more delicate than the question of where\r\n    the line is drawn. Chamberlain was directed by the Cabinet, for\r\n    example, at the time of the Kilmainham Treaty, to carry on\r\n    negotiations with Parnell which were absolutely impossible except by a\r\n    partial revelation of matters discussed secretly in Council; but as\r\n    the Prime Minister was a party to this, I suppose that the Queen's\r\n    consent to the removal of the obligation would be in such a case\r\n    assumed, though it was not in this case real. Another difficulty about\r\n    the oath is that it in no way provides for the position towards their\r\n    chiefs of members of the Government not members of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n    'It is difficult, therefore, to say that the oath in practice imposes\r\n    any obligation other than that which any man of honour would feel laid\r\n    upon him by the ordinary observances of gentlemen.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was only thirty-nine when he entered the Cabinet, yet the\r\ngeneral feeling was that his admission was overdue rather than early, and\r\nno one had shown more anxiety for it than the future King.\r\n\r\n    'During the whole month while my position in the Cabinet was under hot\r\n    discussion, I saw a great deal of the Prince of Wales, who wished to\r\n    know from day to day how matters stood, and I was able to form a more\r\n    accurate opinion both of himself and of the Princess, and of all about\r\n    them, than I had formed before. The Prince is, of course, in fact, a\r\n    strong Conservative, and a still stronger Jingo, really agreeing in\r\n    the Queen's politics, and wanting to take everything everywhere in the\r\n    world and to keep everything if possible, but a good deal under the\r\n    influence of the last person who talks to him, so that he would\r\n    sometimes reflect the Queen and sometimes reflect me or Chamberlain,\r\n    or some other Liberal who had been shaking his head at him. He has\r\n    more sense and more usage of the modern world than his mother, whose\r\n    long retirement has cut her off from that world, but less real brain\r\n    power. He is very sharp in a way, the Queen not sharp at all; but she\r\n    carries heavy metal, for her obstinacy constitutes power of a kind.\r\n    The strongest man in Marlborough House is Holzmann, the Princess's\r\n    Secretary and the Prince's Librarian. He is a man of character and\r\n    solidity, but then he is a Continental Liberal, and looks at all\r\n    English questions as a foreigner! The Princess never talks\r\n    politics.... It is worth talking seriously to the Prince. One seems to\r\n    make no impression at the time ... but he does listen all the same,\r\n    and afterwards, when he is talking to somebody else, brings out\r\n    everything that you have said.'\r\n\r\nSome letters of this date show how strongly the personal friendship of Sir\r\nCharles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain had developed during their political\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1881, Mr. Chamberlain writes that he has been \"reading over\r\nagain a book called _Greater Britain_, written, I believe, by a young\r\nfellow of twenty-five, and a very bright, clever, and instructive book it\r\nis.\" He petitions for a copy \"properly inscribed to your devoted friend\r\nand admirer, J. C.\" Sir Charles, in acknowledging this, protested against\r\nthe word \"instructive,\" and his friend apologized. \"But it is instructive\r\nfor all that. When you next come to Birmingham you shall inscribe my\r\ncopy.... Let me add that in all my political life the pleasantest and the\r\nmost satisfactory incident is your friendship.\"\r\n\r\nThese expressions were further emphasized by another letter of this date.\r\nSir Charles, hurrying into Mr. Chamberlain's room in the House of Commons,\r\nhad found him busy and preoccupied, and so followed up his visit with a\r\nletter. Mr. Chamberlain replied:\r\n\r\n    \"_December 6th._\r\n\r\n    \"I am not sorry to have the opportunity of saying how much I\r\n    appreciate and how cordially I reciprocate all your kind words.\r\n\r\n    \"The fact is that you are by nature such a reserved fellow that all\r\n    _demonstration_ of affection is difficult, but you may believe me when\r\n    I say that I feel it--none the less. I suppose I am reserved myself.\r\n    The great trouble we have both been through has had a hardening effect\r\n    in my case, and since then I have never worn my heart on my sleeve.\r\n\r\n    \"But if I were in trouble I should come to you at once--and that is\r\n    the best proof of friendship and confidence that I know of.\"\r\n\r\nAbout that same time Lord Granville was writing to Sir Charles on foreign\r\naffairs, and diverged into general politics, remarking on the Free Trade\r\nspeeches then being delivered. \"With what ability Chamberlain has been\r\nspeaking! I doubt whether going on the stump suits the Tory party.\" To\r\nthis Sir Charles replied with an enthusiasm rare in his utterances:\r\n\r\n    \"Chamberlain's speech was admirable, I thought. I, as you know,\r\n    delight in his triumphs more than he does himself. It is absurd that\r\n    this should be so between politicians, but so it is. Our friendship\r\n    only grows closer and my admiration for him stronger day by day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of the excitements of 1882 caused by foreign affairs,\r\nbusiness legislation for the needs of the British community had been\r\ncrushed out, but there was agreement that in the New Year time must be\r\ngiven for Mr. Chamberlain's Bankruptcy Bill to become law; also that the\r\nelectioneering question of Corrupt Practices should be dealt with. Beyond\r\nthis immediate programme lay two matters of the first importance--reform\r\nof local government in town and in country, and reform of the electorate.\r\nIn regard to these, the year was chiefly consumed by Government\r\ndissensions, partly as to the character of the measures, but principally\r\nas to their order of precedence.\r\n\r\nAs administrator in his new office, Sir Charles turned at once to the\r\nposition of the civil servants under his control:\r\n\r\n    'On New Year's Day I had begun to be bothered about what was called my\r\n    patronage at the Local Government Board, which was considerable. At\r\n    the Foreign Office I had none at all, and had had the greatest\r\n    possible difficulty in getting Lord Granville to give a consulate to\r\n    Henry George Kennedy, who had been my secretary for many years, and\r\n    who had considerable claims--as he had lost his health in the consular\r\n    service before he first came to me, and then recovered his health\r\n    after a serious illness. At the Local Government Board I was my own\r\n    master, and all the patronage of the office was absolutely at my\r\n    disposal, and the first post or two that fell vacant I gave to persons\r\n    suggested by Hartington, James, and other colleagues. But I very soon\r\n    formed a strong opinion that the patronage of the Local Government\r\n    Board ought to be used in a different way from that which had\r\n    prevailed ever since the end of Stansfeld's term of office' (1871-\r\n    1874). 'Stansfeld had made excellent use of his patronage, but\r\n    Sclater-Booth' [Footnote: Mr. George Sclater-Booth, created Lord\r\n    Basing in 1887.] (1874-1880) 'and Dodson' (1880-1882), 'and even\r\n    Goschen' (1868-1871), 'had used it less well, and had put in men of\r\n    the kind that colleagues often force upon one--political partisans or\r\n    supporters, not always the best men. I talked the matter over, and\r\n    decided to make the service during my term of office a close service,\r\n    and to promote men already in the service to all vacancies as they\r\n    occurred, making inspectors of auditors or clerks, and giving the good\r\n    auditorships to the best men in the inferior ones. As regarded new\r\n    appointments to auditorships at the lowest scale, I had a list of men\r\n    who were working with auditors without pay on the chance of my giving\r\n    them appointments later on, and I brought in several of this kind on\r\n    good reports from auditors. Bodley, my Private Secretary, managed the\r\n    whole of my patronage for me, and did it extremely well, and after I\r\n    had started the system I was able to leave it absolutely in his\r\n    hands.'\r\n\r\nHe notes later on that one of his colleagues was 'furious' with him\r\nbecause he would not do a job for the family solicitor, who was also\r\nParliamentary agent of the colleague's son. A previous President had\r\n'jobbed in a Tory agent,' and the colleague expected that Sir Charles\r\nshould follow with the Whig agent. 'I refused, as I intended to promote\r\none of our best and worst-paid men.'\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the same principle is the case of Mr. Walter Sendall:\r\n\r\n    'It was at this time' (November, 1883) 'that I had taken up, as\r\n    against Lord Kimberley and Lord Derby, the case of Sendall--an\r\n    Assistant Secretary in the Local Government Board, who had been\r\n    previously appointed Governor of Natal, and then withdrawn on account\r\n    of Natal feeling that he would be too much under the control of Sir\r\n    Hercules Robinson, the Governor of the Cape. There being nothing\r\n    against Sendall, I thought that we were bound to find him another\r\n    Governorship, and Horace Seymour, Mr. Gladstone's secretary, was in\r\n    strong agreement with me. The matter was brought to a point at this\r\n    moment by the selection of Blake for a Governorship in preference to\r\n    Sendall. A strong letter from Seymour pointed out that \"heaps of\r\n    deserving men in the Colonial service were passed by to make this\r\n    appointment, and Sendall, who has a _real_ claim on the Government, is\r\n    put on one side. In my opinion an appointment of this kind is most\r\n    mischievous, and I sincerely trust that the Healys and the Biggars\r\n    will make the most of it, and for once they will have at least my\r\n    hearty sympathy....\" Seymour was Lady Spencer's brother, and he on his\r\n    side and I on mine made the lives of Lord Derby and Lord Kimberley'\r\n    (Ministers responsible in regard to the withdrawal) 'so uncomfortable\r\n    that we finally got Sendall an appointment. Blake turned out a success\r\n    as a Colonial Governor.'\r\n\r\nMr. H. Preston Thomas, C.B., in his _Work and Play of a Government\r\nInspector_, written after fifty years' experience of the Civil Service,\r\nbears testimony to Sir Charles's work as an administrator, especially by\r\nthe introduction of the principle of competition:\r\n\r\n    \"It was during the presidency of Sir Charles Dilke that the staff of\r\n    the Local Government Board was reorganized, and for the first time\r\n    placed on a more or less satisfactory footing.... A leaven of highly\r\n    educated men was much wanted in the junior ranks, and this was secured\r\n    by the reorganization of 1884, when eight clerkships of the Higher\r\n    Division were thrown open to public competition.... Every one of the\r\n    successful candidates had graduated in honours at Oxford or Cambridge,\r\n    while two or three were Fellows of their Colleges. The infusion of new\r\n    blood acted most beneficially, and the heads of the department were\r\n    able to delegate to subordinates some of the duties of which the\r\n    enormous mass had fairly overwhelmed them.\" [Footnote: P. 195.]\r\n\r\nThe new President threw himself with energy into the administrative work\r\nof his department: the Memoir abounds in references to visits of\r\ninspection to workhouse infirmaries, sewage farms, schools, and training-\r\nships. One instance in which he personally intervened was that of Nazareth\r\nHouse at Hammersmith, a Roman Catholic establishment at which there had\r\nbeen an outbreak of typhus. There were reasons which made Sir Charles\r\nthink, after a visit to the house, that the local Medical Officer had been\r\nunjustly severe. Instructions were given as to changes to be made, and a\r\nletter of warm gratitude came from Cardinal Manning, April 27th, 1883, who\r\nspoke of himself as \"disabled and shut up, and therefore doubly grateful.\"\r\nThis was endorsed by the action of the Sisters, and Sir Charles's own\r\nphrase, 'I have always continued on intimate terms with the Sisters of\r\nNazareth House until this day,' gives but a slight idea of the homage\r\nrendered to him and his wife by this community until the end.\r\n\r\nWhen he was standing for re-election in January, his speeches contained\r\nstrong protests against over-centralization. Even where he was most\r\nzealous for reform, Sir Charles bore in mind that local bodies are liable\r\nto make mistakes, but that public interest is often best served by\r\nallowing such errors to correct themselves. Here is an instance:\r\n\r\n    'On August 31st, 1883, I inspected Westminster Union Workhouse, in\r\n    consequence of the serious misconduct of the master, who had been\r\n    bitterly attacked in the House of Commons, and with regard to whom I\r\n    had laid down the principle that it was for the Guardians and not for\r\n    me to dismiss him. This was a test case with regard to centralization.\r\n    Feeling in the Press was strong against the master, and his acts were\r\n    entirely indefensible, but he had the support of the majority of his\r\n    Guardians. I made public my opinion, but did nothing else, and\r\n    ultimately the Guardians who supported him lost their seats, and the\r\n    master was removed by the new Board.'\r\n\r\nAt this time the unravelling of the conspiracy which had led to the\r\nPhoenix Park murders and dynamite outrages was causing a panic in London\r\nitself. Sir William Harcourt at the Home Office, while he threw himself\r\ninto the task of fighting these menaces with energy, demanded exemption\r\nfrom less engrossing cares. On March 17th\r\n\r\n    'he told the Cabinet that he was so overburdened with work that he\r\n    must hand all the ordinary business over to the Local Government\r\n    Board.... I noted that Harcourt thought himself a Fouché, and wanted\r\n    to have the whole police work of the country, and nothing but police.\r\n    The matter was finally completed during the Easter recess by letter on\r\n    a scheme drawn up by Hibbert' (Parliamentary Secretary to the Local\r\n    Government Board), 'who knew both offices. It was even proposed at one\r\n    moment that a Bill should be brought in to give the Local Government\r\n    Board for ever the inspections, such as mines, factories, etc., and\r\n    the Artisans' Dwellings Acts and other matters not connected with\r\n    Police and Justice; but no legislation took place, as the idea was\r\n    hotly opposed by the Home Office, and we went on from hand to mouth by\r\n    a mere personal arrangement between Harcourt and myself. [Footnote:\r\n    The Diary of this time deals with the Ministry of Agriculture; it was\r\n    decided to create an Agricultural Vice-President of the Council, so as\r\n    to separate Agriculture from Education, and to appoint 'Dodson as\r\n    Vice-President, under Carlingford as Lord President.' 'Some had asked\r\n    for the creation of a Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, as in\r\n    France, a wonderful combination.' Sir Charles reported to the Cabinet\r\n    the fact that a new Ministry had been unanimously agreed to by the\r\n    House of Commons some years before (though no notice had been taken of\r\n    the resolution)--a Ministry of Justice.\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles Dilke was always opposed to the increase of Ministers\r\n    Ministries. See \"Labour,\" Chapter LII. (Vol. II., pp. 342-367).]\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, April 2nd, there came up the question of whether Harcourt\r\n    would himself deal with the matter of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade,\r\n    which was raised by a debate in the House, and which the Home Office\r\n    insisted on his taking. To their disgust, however, Harcourt would not\r\n    look at the documents, and sent them all to me in a box for me to deal\r\n    with.'\r\n\r\nHome Office duties, as Sir Charles discovered, are 'highly miscellaneous,'\r\nand at the end of May an item in the 'curious mixture of subjects' that he\r\nhad before him was a letter from the Primate, giving the views of a\r\nmeeting of Bishops about cemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe transference of so much business to the Minister of another department\r\nwas not pleasing to the Home Office permanent officials. When Lord\r\nRosebery resigned in the beginning of June, Sir Charles secured the\r\npromotion of Mr. Hibbert, Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government\r\nBoard, to the Under-Secretaryship of the Home Office; [Footnote: Mr. J.\r\nTomlinson Hibbert, afterwards for many years Chairman of the Lancashire\r\nCounty Council and of the County Councils Association.] and out of several\r\nnames submitted to him by Mr. Gladstone for Mr. Hibbert's place he\r\nselected that of Mr. G. W. E. Russell, who, a short time before this, had\r\npublished in one of the reviews an article vehemently attacking the Whig\r\ntradition. Sir Charles notes that Mr. Russell was congratulated by his\r\nkinsman, that great Whig, the Duke of Bedford, as follows:\r\n\r\n    'After singing Russell's praises, he concluded: \"As, my dear George,\r\n    you have now not only an official _but also a literary income_, it\r\n    will, perhaps, no longer be necessary that I should offer to continue\r\n    to pay your election expenses.\" This story has been denied, but is\r\n    true.\r\n\r\n    'All through the autumn I felt myself in considerable difficulties in\r\n    dealing with the important questions which Harcourt had handed over to\r\n    me from the Home Office, but as to which in many cases new departure\r\n    was evidently needed which I had no authority to take. One such\r\n    question was factory inspection. The current work was thrown on me,\r\n    and I had to defend what the factory branch of the Home Office did. On\r\n    the other hand, although I had the strongest opinion that the\r\n    Inspectorate should be increased, and women inspectors appointed for\r\n    factories where women were employed, Harcourt would not agree to this,\r\n    and kept the patronage in his private secretary's hands, so that I had\r\n    no real control.'\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in Sir Charles's power to appoint women inspectors at the\r\nLocal Government Board, and he did so, thus leading the way in the\r\nmovement for associating women with public work.\r\n\r\n    'The same was the case at first with regard to what were known as\r\n    Cross's Acts, or the larger scheme affecting artisans' dwellings, as\r\n    to which I had at the end of October some correspondence with Cardinal\r\n    Manning, who was in Italy. Manning had written, in a letter which I\r\n    received on November 2nd: \"Without a high-handed executive nothing\r\n    will be done till another generation has been morally destroyed, but\r\n    construction must keep pace with destruction. Some of my parishes are\r\n    so crowded owing to destruction without construction as to reproduce\r\n    the same mischiefs in new places. You know I am no narrow politician,\r\n    but I am impatient at political conflicts while these social plagues\r\n    are destroying our people.\"\r\n\r\n    'The matter was brought to a head on the next day by the receipt of a\r\n    letter from Mr. Gladstone sending me a letter from the Queen on the\r\n    dwellings of the people, with copy of what he had said in reply. The\r\n    letter was:\r\n\r\n    '\"BALMORAL CASTLE,\r\n    '\"_October 30th_, '83.\r\n\r\n    '\"The Queen has been much distressed by all she has heard and read\r\n    lately of the deplorable condition of the homes of the poor in our\r\n    great towns.... The Queen will be glad to hear Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    opinion ... and to learn whether the Government contemplate the\r\n    introduction of any measures, or propose to take any steps to obtain\r\n    more precise information as to the _true_ state of affairs in these\r\n    overcrowded, unhealthy, and squalid bodies. She cannot but think that\r\n    there are questions of less importance than these which are under\r\n    discussion, and which might wait till one involving the _very_\r\n    existence of thousands, nay, millions, had been fully considered by\r\n    the Government.\"\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone, in reply, said: \"Mr. Gladstone will not fail to\r\n    communicate with Sir Charles Dilke ... on the subject of your\r\n    Majesty's letter. He himself does not doubt that improvements in local\r\n    government which he trusts are near at hand will lead to a sensible\r\n    progress....\"\r\n\r\n    'In consequence of this communication from the Queen, I decided to\r\n    examine all the worst parts of London for myself, and on November 9th\r\n    I wrote to Lyulph Stanley and to Miss Maude Stanley and others for a\r\n    list of what they considered the worst places in London, \"as we want\r\n    to test our administrative powers under the present law. As we have to\r\n    show that the Local Authority have 'made default,' it would be best to\r\n    take cases as to which the Medical Officers have reported to the\r\n    Vestry in the past, and nothing has been done.\" During the remainder\r\n    of the year I met all the Medical Officers of London with the District\r\n    Surveyors of the parishes, each man in his own district, and visited\r\n    with them all those places on which they had reported without success;\r\n    and, making my own notes, I picked out the very worst cases, and when\r\n    I was certain that I was on firm ground took occasion to mention them\r\n    in public.'\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, in which Mr. Gladstone and also Harcourt and\r\nChamberlain were consulted, it was agreed that Dilke should do what he\r\npleased in the name either of the Home Office or Local Government Board\r\n'as to fighting Vestries about the dwellings of the poor.' At this moment,\r\nnear the end of November, several delicate diplomatic questions were in\r\nhand, upon which, as a member of the Cabinet, Sir Charles was now taking a\r\nleading part. Accordingly Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, who thoroughly\r\nunderstood Local Government problems, took charge of the work on the\r\ndetail of the Local Government Bill:\r\n\r\n    'It might be said that Fitzmaurice was doing my work and I was doing\r\n    his. Although I was visiting St. Giles and the courts about the\r\n    Strand, the worst streets near Judd Street (St. Pancras), Lisson\r\n    Grove, and other curious places in Marylebone, Lord Salisbury's Courts\r\n    in the neighbourhood of St. Martin's Lane, and the worst slums of St.\r\n    George the Martyr, Newington, St. Saviour's, and St. George's in the\r\n    East, yet as regarded the preparation of the details of my Bill I\r\n    turned the matter over to Fitzmaurice....'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's main interest of these months was making up the case against\r\nthose responsible for bad housing, and he fixed responsibility on some who\r\nshowed themselves honourably sensitive:\r\n\r\n    'About this time I received a very strong and detailed anonymous\r\n    letter calling my attention to the condition of the Northampton\r\n    tenants in Clerkenwell, and I sent it to Lord William Compton--\r\n    afterwards Lord Compton, and later Lord Northampton--who was serving\r\n    as a clerk in the Turkish Department of the Foreign Office. At my\r\n    request he went down to Clerkenwell and looked into the matter for\r\n    himself, and found the state of things so horrible that he warmly took\r\n    up the question, and I then took him down to Clerkenwell again. I\r\n    found Clerkenwell to be my strongest case, as it was the only parish\r\n    in which the local authority was entirely in the house-farmers' hands,\r\n    and from this time forward I put it in a prominent place in all my\r\n    speeches.'\r\n\r\nBefore departing, on December 20th, for Toulon,\r\n\r\n    'I had a correspondence with the Archbishop of Canterbury (Benson)\r\n    with regard to the condition of the property in London of the\r\n    Ecclesiastical Commissioners, which I thought a disgrace to the\r\n    Church. He only asked me to send him the facts, which I did, pointing\r\n    out that the district \"in the Borough\" at the meeting of St.\r\n    Saviour's, Bermondsey, Newington, and St. George the Martyr, was in a\r\n    shameful state.'\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these inquiries was the appointment of the Royal Commission\r\non Housing. The subject afforded safe ground on which to meet the Queen\r\nwhen he first went down as a guest to Windsor, and it was supplemented by\r\nanother matter, on which much correspondence had passed between him and\r\nSir Henry Ponsonby--that of certain cement works near West Cowes, the\r\nsmoke from which killed the Queen's shrubs at Osborne.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, November 27th, I dined and slept at Windsor, and the\r\n    Queen talked artisans' dwellings and Osborne chemical works. Ponsonby\r\n    I thought very able and very pleasant. I suppose I had Dizzy's rooms,\r\n    because there was not only a statue of him, but also a framed\r\n    photograph, in the sitting-room, while in the bedroom there was a\r\n    recent statue of the Empress Eugenie. The Queen was, of course, very\r\n    courteous, but she was more bright and pleasant than I had expected.\r\n    The Duke and Duchess of Albany were at Windsor, and I had her next me\r\n    at dinner. Lorne was also there, and after the Queen had gone to bed\r\n    the Duke and Lorne showed me all the curiosities, having had the whole\r\n    of the galleries lighted. We sat up very late. Loene is serious-\r\n    minded ... through his real attempt to understand his work, and would\r\n    do most things well....'\r\n\r\nIn this year Sir Charles opposed the scheme of \"assisted emigration\" under\r\nwhich was offered to the world the amazing spectacle of a Government\r\npaying its own subjects to quit its shores and its flag. Irish peasants,\r\nhalf starved, clad in garments promiscuously flung out from the slop-shop,\r\noften quite unfit to make their way in a strange country, were induced by\r\nthe offer of a free passage (without even inspection to see that they were\r\ndecently accommodated on board) to pour in thousands out of a country\r\nwhose rulers had no better thing to offer them than this cynical quittance\r\nin full. Sir Charles 'violently opposed the scheme' in one of his first\r\nCabinets (May 5th), and again on July 25th tried to abolish it, but 'only\r\nsucceeded in getting a promise that the second year of it should be the\r\nlast.'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1883 his brother Ashton was very ill at Algiers, and\r\non February 17th the manager of his paper, the Weekly Dispatch, brought to\r\nSloane Street a communication in Ashton Dilke's own hand, which contained,\r\namongst other directions to be carried out after his death, the actual\r\nparagraph by which it was to be announced. When the end came, on March\r\n12th, 1883, it meant 'a serious breaking with the past. William Dilke\r\nalone was left to me, if, indeed, at eighty-eight one could speak of a man\r\nas left.' This old grand-uncle, with his military memories of Waterloo\r\ndays, whom Sir Charles Dilke yearly visited at Chichester, and who often\r\nstayed at Sloane Street, was also at this moment very ill, and supposed to\r\nbe dying; but he recovered, and lived on for more than two years. In April\r\nSir Charles ordered from Mr. W. E. F. Britten, the painter, whom Leighton\r\nhad commended to him, a portrait of his brother, which 'proved very good,'\r\nand which hung always in 76, Sloane Street.\r\n\r\nHe clung to family ties, and later in the year paid a visit to distant\r\nkindred, the heads of the Dilke family:\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, August 25th, I went to Maxstoke, and returned on Monday,\r\n    the 27th. There dined on the Saturday night Lord and Lady Norton and\r\n    their eldest son, Charles Adderley. The old man said a very true thing\r\n    to me about the place. \"What a good castle this is, and how lucky that\r\n    it has always been inhabited by people too poor to spoil it!\" From the\r\n    Commonwealth times, when Peter Wentworth plundered the Dilke of his\r\n    day for delinquency after the two years during which Fairfax had held\r\n    the Castle, they have never had money, and no attempt was ever made to\r\n    rebuild the interior house after the two fires by which two-thirds of\r\n    it were successively destroyed. They are, owing to Mrs. Dilke having a\r\n    little money, a little more prosperous just now, and there is a larger\r\n    herd of deer than usual; on this occasion I counted over one hundred\r\n    from the walls.'\r\n\r\nThe loss of his only brother had been preceded by a 'heavy blow.' That\r\n\"great and illustrious friend\" for whom, in the early seventies, Sir\r\nCharles prophesied that, in spite of the opposition of French aristocracy\r\nand clericalism, he would govern France, had passed away on the last day\r\nof 1882. Gambetta was dead.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, 1883, Sir Charles, speaking to the electors of Chelsea,\r\ndwelt on the qualities of \"the greatest of all Frenchmen of his time\"--\r\n\"the magnitude of his courage, his tremendous energy, his splendid\r\noratory, and, for those who knew him in private, his unmatched gaiety and\r\nsparkling wit.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who wrote to him was Mr. Gladstone, condoling on a death \"you\r\nwill much feel.\" To one friend who wrote of Gambetta's \"moral power,\" he\r\nreplied: \"It seems difficult to speak of 'moral' power about Gambetta. His\r\nkind of power was almost purely physical; it was a power of courage,\r\nenergy, and oratory.\" During his visit to Paris in January, 1883, 'my\r\nfirst visit after Gambetta's death,' he and Lord Lyons 'talked chiefly\r\nabout Gambetta.'\r\n\r\nLater, turning--with the detachment of judgment which characterized his\r\nattitude to public life--from his private friendship to his estimate of\r\nthe needs of France, he left this estimate of Gambetta and the Republic:\r\n\r\n    'Much as I loved his society, I did not think him a loss to the\r\n    Republic, for he was too dictatorial and too little inclined to let\r\n    other men do important work to suit that form of government, except,\r\n    indeed, in time of war. It is quite true that his was the only strong\r\n    personality of which France could boast, and it was possible that, so\r\n    long as he was there, the people would not be likely in a panic to\r\n    hunt in other camps for a saviour: but great as was his power--\r\n    physical power, power of courage and of oratory--and terrible as was\r\n    the hole in France made by his death, nevertheless the smaller men\r\n    were perhaps more able to conduct the Republic to prosperity and to\r\n    general acceptance by the people.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe governing fact of English politics at this moment was the general\r\nexpectation of Mr. Gladstone's retirement. Since Lord Hartington would\r\nundoubtedly succeed him, the Radical wing, led by Dilke and Chamberlain,\r\nwas doubly eager to commit the Government in advance to Radical measures.\r\nEach of the two main subjects contemplated had two subdivisions. Reform of\r\nthe electorate included extension of the franchise, to which the Radicals\r\nattached most importance, and to which Lord Hartington was sullenly\r\nopposed; it also included redistribution of seats. Reform of local\r\ngovernment included, first, proposals for a new system of county\r\ngovernment; [Footnote: These had taken some shape, and Dilke found a draft\r\nof them in his office when he succeeded to it; but Mr. Chamberlain agreed\r\nwith him in thinking it \"a poor thing which I should not like to father.\"]\r\nsecondly, the Bill for the Government of London, which Sir William\r\nHarcourt and Sir Charles Dilke had prepared with the help of Mr. Beal and\r\nMr. Firth, and this was ready for circulation to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhile Dilke, with his son, was passing Christmas-time at Toulon, Mr.\r\nGladstone had also come to the Mediterranean coast.\r\n\r\n    'I went to Cannes, where I dined with Mr. Gladstone twice, and went to\r\n    church with him on Sunday, January 21st, 1883.\r\n\r\n    'While Mr. Gladstone was at Cannes he talked very freely to Ribot and\r\n    other Frenchmen in the presence of Mrs. Emily Crawford, the _Daily\r\n    News_ correspondent in Paris, about the London Government Bill.\r\n    Harcourt had insisted, against myself and Firth and Beal, and against\r\n    most of the Commons members of the Cabinet, including the Prime\r\n    Minister, on keeping the control of the police in the hands of the\r\n    Government. Ribot asked Mr. Gladstone whether we could really trust\r\n    London with its police, as few Frenchmen dared trust Paris, and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone said that we could and should, a statement which was at once\r\n    sent to the _Daily News_, and printed, to Harcourt's horror.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEON GAMBETTA.\r\nFrom the painting by Legros in the Luxembourg Museum at Paris.]\r\n\r\n    'On February 2nd we had a conference on London Government at the Home\r\n    Office, in which the police question again came up. In consequence of\r\n    our difference of opinion Harcourt shortly after circulated to the\r\n    Cabinet a memorandum on the police authority in the new municipality\r\n    of London....\r\n\r\n    '\"No competent statesmen and no authoritative body of men have\r\n    considered this matter without arriving at the same conclusion--\r\n    namely, that there ought to be one police force, and not two, in the\r\n    Metropolis. I will therefore take it for granted that it is impossible\r\n    to raise an argument against the union of the whole of the police\r\n    force in the Metropolis under one control.... There is only one\r\n    question worthy of debate--namely, whether the united force shall be\r\n    placed under the control of the corporation or of the Government.... A\r\n    practical consideration of the case will, I think, demonstrate the\r\n    sheer impossibility of vesting in a popular council the discipline and\r\n    administration of such a force as the Metropolitan Police.... Suppose,\r\n    for example, that news arrived either from America or Ireland which\r\n    required instant and secret action by the police throughout London\r\n    against a Fenian outbreak. Is it to be contended that a meeting of the\r\n    Watch Committee is to be summoned ... a debate to be raised and a vote\r\n    taken?... When the Government determined to arrest Davitt, was the\r\n    warrant to be canvassed ... in the Watch Committee?...\"\r\n\r\n    'On this I wrote in strong dissent: \"Suppose the same news as regards\r\n    Liverpool. A case in point was the attack on Chester Castle. Liverpool\r\n    was the Fenian centre for this. Liverpool is by far the most Fenian\r\n    town in England. Yet all the arrests were made in Liverpool, and all\r\n    worked perfectly. If all this argument were really true, there would\r\n    be Fenian Alsatias in existence now. We do not find any difference\r\n    between town and town. We do not find that the Fenians avoid London,\r\n    where Harcourt has all his force and all his powers.\"\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt's memorandum went on in extraordinarily violent and anti-\r\n    popular language.... To this reasoning neither Mr. Gladstone nor\r\n    Chamberlain nor I yielded.'\r\n\r\nExtension of the franchise involved Ireland. It was certain enormously to\r\nincrease Mr. Parnell's following, and Lord Hartington's opposition to the\r\nproposal was very largely due to this fact. The Whig leader's attitude to\r\nIreland was expressed in a speech at Bacup, in which he declared that it\r\nwould be \"madness to give Ireland more extended self-government\" unless\r\nthey could \"receive from the Irish people some assurance that this boon\r\nwould not be used for the purposes of agitation.\"\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote to me January 20th:\r\n\r\n    '\"Hartington's speech was very Conservative the other day. I cannot\r\n    complain, as he has as much right to talk Whiggism as you and I to\r\n    spout Radicalism. Only I don't see how we are to get on together when\r\n    Mr. G. goes.... But the general impression left on my mind is that the\r\n    country (_our_ country, that is--the great majority of Liberal\r\n    opinion) is ripe for a new departure in constructive Radicalism, and\r\n    only wants leaders. So if we are driven to fight, we shall easily\r\n    recruit an army.\"'\r\n\r\nSpeaking at Swansea on February 1st, Mr. Chamberlain said:\r\n\r\n    \"So long as Ireland is without any institution of Local Government\r\n    worthy of the name, so long the seeds of discontent and disloyalty\r\n    will remain, and burst forth into luxuriant growth at the first\r\n    favourable occasion.\"\r\n\r\nRadicals were already uneasy about Lord Spencer's administration, and\r\ntheir uneasiness was finding expression in public. Sir Charles notes in\r\nJanuary, 1883, before his brother Ashton's death:\r\n\r\n    'My brother had in January placed his application for the Chiltern\r\n    Hundreds secretly in the hands of his Newcastle friends, to be used so\r\n    soon as they had found a candidate, and I managed through Chamberlain\r\n    the selection of John Morley. Lord Spencer and Trevelyan were at this\r\n    time very hostile to Morley, who was writing against their policy in\r\n    the _Pall Mall_, and was supposed to be instigated by Chamberlain. In\r\n    sending me a letter of complaint from Trevelyan, Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"It seems to me devilishly like Forster over again. I think it may\r\n    wait without further reply; but I fear there may be more trouble in\r\n    store in Ireland yet, and we may have to put our feet down on further\r\n    coercion.\"\r\n\r\n    'In a letter of February 2nd, Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"If Spencer and Trevelyan really believe that I have set Morley\r\n    against them, they are very foolish. On the other hand, I have done\r\n    all I can to keep him straight, but you know he is kittle cattle to\r\n    drive. If I have not converted him, I must admit that he has rather\r\n    shaken me, and I have not quite so much confidence in their discretion\r\n    as I thought it politic to express last night\" (at Swansea). \"The more\r\n    I think of the prosecutions of the Press and of Members of Parliament,\r\n    the less I like them. But I have said nothing of this to Morley. You\r\n    will see that I replied to Hartington by implication. I do not want to\r\n    have a row, but if it must come I shall not shrink from it.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Radicals were pressing forward a proposal to deal at once with the\r\nextension of franchise instead of with Local Government; but here they\r\nwere overruled.\r\n\r\n    'On this last point of the order of our chief Bills, Chamberlain and I\r\n    jointly consulted the Cabinet in writing, with the result that all\r\n    pronounced against our view except Mr. Gladstone, who was away and did\r\n    not write.' (Mr. Gladstone did not return from Cannes till the\r\n    beginning of March.) 'Hartington showed in his minute not only that he\r\n    wanted County Government dealt with first, but that he wanted\r\n    redistribution dealt with in the same Session with franchise. Lord\r\n    Spencer and Lord Selborne strongly agreed with Hartington. Lord\r\n    Granville was against binding ourselves to couple redistribution with\r\n    equalization of franchise, but thought that to introduce Bills dealing\r\n    with one or both of these subjects \"would be prematurely hastening the\r\n    end of a good Parliament, and would delay the passing of useful\r\n    measures, including Local Government. It seems to me important to test\r\n    the utility of the new rules of procedure by several non-political\r\n    Bills, together with such Bills as the Local Government Bill and the\r\n    reform of the municipality of London.\" Lord Granville, of course, was\r\n    anxious to stop in, and was merely finding reasons for not touching a\r\n    subject which he thought dangerous.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Derby agreed with Lord Granville: \"The objection on general\r\n    grounds to bringing forward a County Franchise Bill in the present\r\n    Session seems to me strong. You could not postpone redistribution of\r\n    seats, and this latter measure would involve the necessity for\r\n    dissolution, either in order to carry it or immediately after it was\r\n    carried. Local Government would thus be delayed for several years.\"\r\n    Lord Kimberley wrote: \"I agree with Lord Derby. From the time when we\r\n    propose the extension of the county franchise until (by some\r\n    Governments) the redistribution of seats is carried, there will be a\r\n    political crisis, and all other measures will be postponed.\"\r\n\r\n    'In consequence of the position taken up by the Cabinet, I proceeded\r\n    to draft a Local Government Bill.' [Footnote: The measure was a large\r\n    one, but he notes in his Memoir that 'it was a less complete and\r\n    comprehensive measure than that prepared by me for Chamberlain in\r\n    1886.']\r\n\r\nThus, immediately on his entry into the Cabinet Sir Charles found himself\r\nentrusted with the task of framing the chief measure for the succeeding\r\nSession. When the outlines had been sketched in, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    'Before I started for my Easter holiday I went through the draft of\r\n    the Local Government Bill. Drawing great Bills is heart-breaking work,\r\n    for one always feels that they will never be introduced or seen, so\r\n    considerable are the chances against any given Bill going forward. All\r\n    the great labour that we had given to the London Bill was wasted, and\r\n    this forms a reason why the Foreign Office is pleasanter than other\r\n    offices, as no work is wasted there.'\r\n\r\nThe decision to postpone extension of the franchise, though it eased the\r\nsituation, did not solve all difficulties. Mr. Chamberlain urged a Tenant\r\nRights Bill for England, which, he said to Sir Charles, \"would be a great\r\nstroke of business. Without it\" they would \"lose the farmers for a\r\ncertainty.\" Sir Charles concurred, and an Agricultural Holdings Bill was\r\namongst the measures carried in that Session. It did not go far in the\r\ndirection of tenant right, and therefore created no controversy with the\r\nWhigs. But with regard to Ireland, Mr. Chamberlain 'was strongly in favour\r\nof an Irish Local Government Bill' (which had been promised in a previous\r\nQueen's Speech). The Prime Minister was of Mr. Chamberlain's view. On\r\nFebruary 3rd to 5th, when Dilke was staying with the Duke of Albany at\r\nClaremont (and 'admiring Clive's Durbar carpet, for which the house was\r\nbuilt'), the Duke 'talked over Mr. Gladstone's strong desire for an Irish\r\nLocal Government Bill.' That desire was, indeed, no secret, for Mr.\r\nGladstone, still in his expansive mood of Cannes, gave an interview to M.\r\nClemenceau, in which he expressed his hope to \"make the humblest Irishman\r\nfeel that he is a self governing agency, and that the Government is to be\r\ncarried on by him and for him.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet of February 9th\r\n\r\n    'we looked forward to what the schoolboys call \"a jolly blow up,\" when\r\n    Mr. Gladstone should return. The letter from Mr. Gladstone, which was\r\n    read, was so steady in its terms that I passed a paper to Chamberlain,\r\n    saying: \"He is quite as obstinate as you are.\"\r\n\r\n    'On February 12th I ... found Harcourt perfectly furious at Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's conversations as reported in the _Daily News_. I wrote to\r\n    Chamberlain to tell him, and he replied: u It is lovely. And his\r\n    conversation with Clemenceau will send Hartington into hysterics re\r\n    Irish Local Government.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's first Cabinet Council was on Tuesday, February 6th, 1883.\r\n\r\n    'This was the Queen's Speech Cabinet, and my notes show that I wrote a\r\n    good deal of the speech, especially the part which concerned the\r\n    Bills. I was much surprised at the form of the circular calling the\r\n    Cabinet: \"A Meeting of Her Majesty's servants will be held,\" etc....\r\n    We were thirteen on this day, and spent a portion of our valuable time\r\n    in wondering which of us would be gone before the year was out. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone still stated in his letters that he would retire at Easter,\r\n    or at the latest in August, and it was generally thought that he meant\r\n    August.'\r\n\r\nA series of Cabinets followed in which the Prime Minister continued to\r\nmake himself felt, though absent, and Sir Charles wrote in his Diary:\r\n\r\n    \"Talk of two Kings of Brentford! This Cabinet has to serve two\r\n    despotic monarchs--one a Tory one, at Osborne, and one a Radical one,\r\n    at Cannes.\"\r\n\r\nIt shows the temper of the moment that Sir Charles should have described\r\nthe second monarch as 'Radical.' But Ireland was then the central subject\r\nof contention, and concerning Ireland Mr. Gladstone was with the Radicals,\r\nDilke and Chamberlain, and against those who wanted to revenge upon the\r\nwhole Irish nation, the plots of the \"Invincibles,\" then being exposed by\r\nthe evidence of James Carey, the Phoenix Park assassin, who had been\r\naccepted as an informer.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, February 18th, I dined with the Prince and Princess of\r\n    Wales at Marlborough House, where were present Prince Edward of Saxe-\r\n    Weimar, Hartington, the Duchess of Manchester, Lord and Lady Hamilton\r\n    (afterwards Duke and Duchess of Abercorn), Lord and Lady Granville,\r\n    Lady Lonsdale (afterwards Lady de Grey), Lord Rowton, H. Bismarck,\r\n    Leighton, Alfred de Rothschild, and Sir Joseph Crowe. Lord Granville\r\n    and I sat in a corner and talked Danube Conference. Lord Granville\r\n    told me, when we returned to other matters, that Harcourt was in a\r\n    dangerous frame of mind, and might at any moment burst out publicly\r\n    about the necessity of governing Ireland by the sword. He was also\r\n    threatening resignation on account of Mr. Gladstone's views about the\r\n    Metropolitan Police.'\r\n\r\n    'On February 19th there was an informal Cabinet in Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    room, which was now temporarily mine.... Harcourt fought against Lord\r\n    Granville, Kimberley, Northbrook, Carlingford, and Childers, in favour\r\n    of his violent views about the Irish. At last Carlingford, although an\r\n    Irish landlord, cried out: \"Your language is that of the lowest Tory.\"\r\n    Harcourt then said: \"In the course of this very debate I shall say\r\n    that there must be no more Irish legislation, and no more\r\n    conciliation, and that Ireland can only be governed by the sword.\" \"If\r\n    you say that,\" replied Carlingford, \"it will not be as representing\r\n    the Government, for none of your colleagues agree with you.\" It was\r\n    only temper, and Harcourt said nothing of the kind, but made an\r\n    excellent speech.' [Footnote: Sir Charles Dilke's view of the Irish\r\n    movement is expressed in a letter of March 7th, 1883: \"I don't think\r\n    that the movement in Ireland is to be traced to the same causes as\r\n    that on the Continent. The Irish movement is Nationalist. It is\r\n    patriotic--not cosmopolitan, and is as detached from French Anarchism\r\n    and German or American Socialism as is the Polish Nationalist\r\n    movement.\"]\r\n\r\n    'On March 1st I heard that when the Irish Government, through the Home\r\n    Office, had applied to the Foreign Office to ask the Americans for P.\r\n    J. Sheridan, the Home Office had said that they feared it was useless\r\n    to apply to the United States except on a charge of murder. On this\r\n    hint the Irish Government at once charged Sheridan with murder.\r\n    Harcourt told me that their promptitude reminded him of a story which\r\n    he had heard from Kinglake, who was once applied to by a friend as to\r\n    the circumstances which would be sufficient to legalize a \"nuncupative\r\n    [Footnote: \"Nuncupative\" is a legal term for an oral as distinguished\r\n    from a written will.] death-bed will.\" Kinglake wrote a figurative\r\n    account of an imaginary case in much detail, and by the next post\r\n    received a solemn affidavit from the man setting out Kinglake's own\r\n    exact series of incidents as having actually occurred.'\r\n\r\nProsecutions and sentences had no more effect than such things generally\r\nhave in face of a suppressed revolution and on the night of March 15th,\r\n1883, a dynamite explosion took place at the Local Government Board. Sir\r\nCharles, however, did not take a very serious view of it:\r\n\r\n    'The dynamiters chose a quiet corner, and they chose an hour when\r\n    nobody was about, which showed that the object was not to hurt\r\n    anybody, but only to get money from the United States. At the same\r\n    time they picked their office most unfortunately, for the Local\r\n    Government Board is the only office where people worked late at night,\r\n    and two out of my four leading men were still in their rooms, although\r\n    they had come at ten in the morning and the explosion did not take\r\n    place till nine at night.'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had returned at the beginning of this month, and on March\r\n5th Sir Charles saw him for the first time in Cabinet, 'singularly quiet,\r\nhardly saying anything at all.' He did, however, say that Mr. Bradlaugh\r\nwas \"a stone round their necks,\" 'which in a Parliamentary sense he was.'\r\nDespite one of Mr. Gladstone's greatest speeches, Government were again\r\nbeaten when they proposed to let him affirm.\r\n\r\nIn this spring there was an agitation to create a Secretaryship of State\r\nfor Scotland, and Lord Rosebery was looked upon as designate for the\r\noffice. Sir Charles did not think the change necessary, but was strongly\r\nfor having Lord Rosebery in the Cabinet, and wrote to Sir M. Grant Duff,\r\nGovernor of Madras:\r\n\r\n    \"It would be natural to give Rosebery the Privy Seal, and let him keep\r\n    the Scotch work; but nothing will induce Mr. G. to look upon him as\r\n    anything but a nice promising baby, and he will not hear of letting\r\n    him into the Cabinet.\" 'Nothing,' he adds, 'was settled on this\r\n    occasion.'\r\n\r\n    \"A smaller Bill than those which I have mentioned, but one in which I\r\n    was interested, was my Municipal Corporations (unreformed) Bill, which\r\n    had passed the House of Lords, but failed to pass the Commons.\r\n    [Footnote: Previous reference to Sir Charles's persistent fight for\r\n    this Bill is to be found in Chapter XIII.] Rosebery thought that this\r\n    time it should be introduced into the Commons... because, although the\r\n    Lords were pledged to it by having passed it,\" this pledge must not be\r\n    strained too hard by constantly waving the red flag of uncomfortable\r\n    reform before the hereditary bull. \"Harcourt having agreed with me\r\n    that the Bill should be introduced into the Lords, and having also\r\n    agreed with Rosebery that it should be introduced in the Commons,\r\n    Rosebery again wrote: 'I am afraid if you go on bringing this measure\r\n    before the peers they will begin to smell out suspicious matter in\r\n    it.\"'\r\n\r\nOn April 21st 'Rosebery again promised me to introduce a Bill,' and the\r\nBill became law in 1884.\r\n\r\nAfter his brother's death on March 12th Sir Charles Dilke, in his reply to\r\na very kind letter from the Prince of Wales in the name of himself and the\r\nPrincess, mentioned Lord Rosebery and the Scotch agitation. The Prince\r\nwrote back:\r\n\r\n    \"I quite agree. If Rosebery was not to be President of the Council, he\r\n    ought at least to be Privy Seal. It seems very hard, as he has every\r\n    claim, especially after the Midlothian election.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral matters relating to the Queen and Royal Family appear at this time\r\nin the Memoir. At the Cabinet of March 5th\r\n\r\n    'a letter from the Queen was read as to her strong wish to have an\r\n    Indian bodyguard, consisting of twenty noncommissioned officers of the\r\n    native cavalry. I did not say a word, and Chamberlain not much, but\r\n    all the others strongly attacked the scheme, which they ended by\r\n    rejecting. Lord Derby said that the Empress title had been forced on\r\n    the former Conservative Cabinet, of which he had been a member, in the\r\n    same way. It was pointed out that if India consented to pay the men,\r\n    and they only carried side-arms, they might be treated as pages or\r\n    servants, not soldiers, and need not be voted at all as \"men\" in the\r\n    Army Estimates.'\r\n\r\n    'A day or two later Villiers, our military attach. in Paris, reported\r\n    the existence of a military plot, said to have been got up by General\r\n    Billot, the Minister of War: the plan being that fifteen commanders of\r\n    corps were to turn out Grévy and put in the due d'Aumale. The story\r\n    was probably a lie.'\r\n\r\n    'On March 18th there was to have been a \"forgiving party\" at Windsor,\r\n    for Lord Derby was commanded as well as I. The Harcourts were to have\r\n    gone, but the Queen sent in the morning to say she had slipped down,\r\n    and must put off her Sunday dinner.'\r\n\r\n    'At this time peace was restored between Randolph Churchill and the\r\n    Royal Family. The reconciliation was marked by Lady Randolph attending\r\n    the Drawing-Room held on March 13th at the Queen's special wish.'\r\n\r\n    'At the Marlborough House dinner on May 27th, the Prince spoke to me\r\n    about the allowance for his sons as they came of age, and told me that\r\n    he thought the money might be given to him as head of the family. My\r\n    own view is very much the same, but I would give it all to the Crown,\r\n    and let the King for the time being distribute it so that we should\r\n    not deal with any other members of the family.'\r\n\r\n    'At Claremont I found, from the conversation of the Duke of Albany and\r\n    of his secretary, that if the Duke of Cambridge resigned speedily, as\r\n    then seemed probable, the Duke of Connaught had no chance of obtaining\r\n    the place; but it was hoped at Court that the Commander-in-Chief would\r\n    hold his position for five or six years, and then might be succeeded\r\n    by the Duke of Connaught.'\r\n\r\nLater Sir Charles mentions the Duke of Albany's conversation with him as\r\nto Canada, of which he wished to be Governor, but the Queen opposed the\r\nproject, and Lord Lansdowne was eventually sent out.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Easter recess:\r\n\r\n    'The Government programme now began to be revised in the light of\r\n    men's declared intentions.'\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, March 21st, I crossed to Paris, and went to Toulon. I\r\n    must have been back in London on Thursday, March 29th, on which day I\r\n    had a long interview with Mr. Gladstone on things in general. He had\r\n    told Harcourt that he would hardly budge about the London police. His\r\n    last word was that they should be retained by the Home Office for a\r\n    period distinctly temporary, and to be named in the Bill. I gathered\r\n    from Mr. Gladstone's talk that all idea of retirement had gone out of\r\n    his mind.'\r\n\r\nThere was a Cabinet on April 7th, and 'London Government was again\r\npostponed, but, owing to the fierce conflict between Harcourt and Mr.\r\nGladstone, was looked upon as dead.'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, in his anger, told Sir Charles that \"Harcourt, through\r\nlaziness, wanted to get out of the Government of London Bill.\" But the\r\ntruth was, says the Memoir, 'that he could think of nothing but the\r\ndynamite conspiracy.' A Bill to meet this was being rushed through\r\nParliament, with an almost grotesque haste, that was as grotesquely\r\nbaffled in the end.\r\n\r\n    'On April 9th the Queen sat up half the night at Harcourt's wish in\r\n    order to be ready to sign the Explosives Bill at once, but Mr. Palmer\r\n    of the Crown Office (the gentleman who signs \"Palmer\" as though he\r\n    were a peer) could not be found; and the other man, Zwingler, was in\r\n    bed at Turnham Green, and to Harcourt's rage the thing could not be\r\n    done. On the 16th Harcourt told the Chancellor that in the discussion\r\n    of the Crown Office vote he should move the omission of the item for\r\n    his nephew's pay.' [Footnote: Mr. Ralph Charlton Palmer was Lord\r\n    Selborne's second cousin, and secretary to Lord Selborne in the Lord\r\n    Chancellor's Office. He was afterwards a Commissioner in Lunacy.]\r\n\r\nThe London Government Bill was not yet given up for lost. On April 11th\r\nSir Charles Dilke wrote to Mr. Gladstone to deprecate its withdrawal, and\r\nthe Prime Minister replied, agreeing that \"withdrawal ... would be a\r\nserious mischief, and a blow to the Government.\"\r\n\r\n    'On April 14th there was a Cabinet, at which Mr. Gladstone announced\r\n    that Harcourt had written to him refusing to go on with the Government\r\n    of London Bill after the second reading of the measure, and proposing\r\n    that I should conduct it through Committee.'\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet of this day (April 21st) Mr. Gladstone said that he\r\n    wanted the bearing of the Agricultural Holdings Bill on Scotland\r\n    explained to him. \"I wish Argyll were here,\" said he. \"I wish to God\r\n    he was,\" said Hartington, who had been fighting alone against the\r\n    Bill, deserted even by the Chancellor and by Lord Derby. Indeed, all\r\n    my lords were very Radical to-day except Hartington, who was simply\r\n    ferocious, being at bay. He told us that Lord Derby was a mere owner\r\n    of Liverpool ground rents, who knew nothing about land.'\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, May 24th, there was a meeting at the Home Office of nine\r\n    members of the Cabinet as to the Government of London Bill, and I\r\n    wrote after it to Chamberlain: \"Victory! Hartington alone dissenting,\r\n    everybody was for going on with everything, and sitting in the\r\n    autumn.\" And Chamberlain replied: \"At last! But why the devil was it\r\n    not decided before?\"'\r\n\r\nAt a full Cabinet a few days later 'the police difficulty finally slew the\r\nLondon Bill.' This seemed to Sir Charles a very serious matter, and he\r\nthought of resigning. Mr. Chamberlain, however, was against this, though\r\nagreeing that he should resign in the autumn 'unless Mr. Gladstone would\r\npromise to put franchise first next year.'\r\n\r\nSo it was left. But presently Mr. Chamberlain himself became the cause of\r\nvery grave dissensions. On June 13th, 1883, a great assembly was held at\r\nBirmingham to celebrate the twenty-fifth year of Mr. Bright's membership\r\nfor the borough, and Mr. Chamberlain in speaking observed that\r\nrepresentatives of royalty were not present, neither were they missed.\r\n[Footnote: On Monday, June 11th, 1883, there was a \"monster procession and\r\nfete constituting the popular prelude to the more serious business of the\r\nBright celebration at Birmingham\" that week. On June 13th Mr. Chamberlain\r\nsaid: \"Twice in a short interval we have read how vast multitudes of human\r\nbeings have gathered together to acclaim and welcome the ruler of the\r\npeople. In Russia, in the ancient capital of that mighty Empire, the\r\ndescendant of a long line of ancient Princes, accompanied by a countless\r\nhost of soldiers, escorted by all the dignitaries of the State, and by the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign Powers, was received with every demonstration\r\nof joy by the vast population which was gathered together to witness his\r\ntriumphal entry. I have been told that more than a million sterling of\r\npublic money was expended on these ceremonies and festivities.... Your\r\ndemonstration on Monday lacked nearly all the elements which constituted\r\nthe great pageant of the Russian Coronation. Pomp and circumstance were\r\nwanting; no public money was expended; no military display accompanied Mr.\r\nBright. The brilliant uniforms, the crowds of high officials, the\r\nrepresentatives of Royalty, were absent, and nobody missed them; for yours\r\nwas essentially a demonstration of the people and by the people, in honour\r\nof the man whom the people delighted to honour, and the hero of that\r\ndemonstration had no offices to bestow--no ribands, or rank, or Court\r\ntitles, to confer. He was only the plain citizen--one of ourselves....\"\r\n(the Times, June 14th, 1883).] He added that the country was in his\r\nopinion more Radical than the majority of the House of Commons, but not\r\nmore Radical than the Government; that the country was in favour of\r\nDisestablishment, and that three things were wanted: First, \"a suffrage\r\nfrom which no man who is not disqualified by crime or the recipient of\r\nrelief shall be excluded \"; secondly, equal electoral districts; and,\r\nthirdly, payment of members.\r\n\r\n    'On June 25th Mr. Gladstone had sent for me about a recent speech by\r\n    Chamberlain at Birmingham.\r\n\r\n    'The Queen had been angry at his \"They toil not, neither do they\r\n    spin,\" but was still more angry about this recent speech, at which Mr.\r\n    Gladstone was also himself offended. [Footnote: \"This speech is open\r\n    to exception from three points of view, I think--first in relation to\r\n    Bright, secondly in relation to the Cabinet, thirdly and most\r\n    especially in relation to the Crown, to which the speech did not\r\n    indicate the consciousness of his holding any special relation,\" wrote\r\n    Mr. Gladstone to Sir Henry Ponsonby (Morley's Life of Gladstone, vol.\r\n    iii., p. 112).] I pointed out that Hartington had committed his\r\n    colleagues on a practical question when he spoke as to Irish Local\r\n    Government last January, and Mr. Gladstone had committed them when he\r\n    talked on Ireland and on London government to Ribot and Clemenceau at\r\n    Cannes. Mr. Gladstone defended himself, but threw over Hartington, who\r\n    had \"behaved worse than Chamberlain.\" I went to see Chamberlain about\r\n    it, and found him very stiff, but tried to get him to say something\r\n    about it at the Cobden Club, where he was to preside on Saturday, the\r\n    30th. On the next day he promised that he would do this, but when he\r\n    came to read me the words that he intended to use I came to the\r\n    conclusion that, although they would make his own position very clear,\r\n    they would only make matters worse as far as Mr. Gladstone and the\r\n    Queen were concerned.'\r\n\r\nDilke's mediation was ultimately successful, and 'on July 2nd Mr.\r\nGladstone, in a letter to Chamberlain, accepted his explanations with\r\nregard to his speech.' In the House of Commons, charge of the Corrupt\r\nPractices Bill had been entrusted to the President of the Local Government\r\nBoard--a very unusual arrangement--and it meant sitting late many nights,\r\nonce till 5.30 a.m., after which 'I had to get up as usual for my fencing\r\npeople.'\r\n\r\n    'On July 25th there was another Cabinet, before which I had\r\n    \"circulated\" to my colleagues my local government scheme. Many members\r\n    of the Cabinet objected to it as too complete, and on my communicating\r\n    their views to the draftsman, Sir Henry Thring, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"I believe that the great superiority of your plan of local\r\n    government over any other I have seen consists in its extent. I\r\n    believe that you will find that your scheme, though apparently far\r\n    more extreme than any scheme yet proposed, will practically not make a\r\n    greater alteration in existing arrangements than a far less\r\n    comprehensive scheme would make. It is, as far as I can judge,\r\n    impossible to make a partial plan for local government: such a plan\r\n    disturbs everything and settles nothing.... Your plan, when carried\r\n    into effect, will disturb most things, no doubt, but will at the same\r\n    time settle everything.\"'\r\n\r\nAt a Cabinet held in the recess on October 25th\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone made a speech about the next Session which virtually\r\n    meant franchise first, and the rest nowhere. After this I locked up my\r\n    now useless Local Government Bill, of which the principal draft had\r\n    been dated August 24th. One of its most important parts had been the\r\n    consolidation of rates and declaration of the liability of owners for\r\n    half the rates. It had then gone on to establish district councils,\r\n    and then the County Councils. There was, however, to be some slight\r\n    resuscitation of the Bill a little later.'\r\n\r\nTwo minor concerns which interested Sir Charles exceedingly were under\r\nprolonged discussion this year. The first was the proposed purchase of the\r\nAshburnham and Stowe collections. Sir Charles 'voted all through against\r\nthe purchase of the Ashburnham manuscripts, being certain that we were\r\nbeing imposed upon.' He noted\r\n\r\n    'the experts always want to buy, and always say that the thing is\r\n    invaluable and a chance which will never happen again. No one can care\r\n    for the National Gallery more than I do; I know the pictures very\r\n    well, for I go there almost every week.'\r\n\r\nHe thought, however, that some wholesale purchases for public collections\r\nhad been all but worthless, with perhaps one admirable thing in a mass of\r\nrubbish.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there arose in May a discussion over the Duke of Wellington's\r\nstatue, which Leighton and the Prince of Wales wanted to remove from Hyde\r\nPark Corner, but which Sir Charles cherished as an old friend. It was one\r\nof the matters on which he and Mr. Gladstone were united by a common\r\nconservatism:\r\n\r\n    'The ridiculous question of the Duke of Wellington's statue had come\r\n    up again at the Cabinet of August 9th, and the numbers were taken\r\n    three times over by Mr. Gladstone, who was in favour of the old statue\r\n    and against all removals, in which view I steadily supported him, the\r\n    Cabinet being against us, and Mr. Gladstone constantly trying to get\r\n    his own way against the majority. It was the only subject upon which,\r\n    while I was a member of it, I ever knew the Cabinet take a show of\r\n    hands.'\r\n\r\nIn the last Cabinet of the Session they 'once more informally divided\r\nabout the Wellington statue'; and he recorded the fact that he 'still\r\nhoped to save it.' Yet in the end he failed; and 'now,' he notes\r\npathetically, 'I should have to go to Aldershot to see it if I wished to\r\ndo so.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AND COLONIAL AFFAIRS\r\nOCTOBER, 1882, TO DECEMBER, 1883\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's transference to the Local Government Board scarcely\r\nlessened his contact with the more important branches of the Foreign\r\nOffice work, while his entry into the Cabinet greatly increased the range\r\nof his consultative authority.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Alliance was a fact, but only guessed as yet. It is not till\r\nthe middle of 1883 that Sir Charles writes:\r\n\r\n    'On June 4th, 1883, I heard the particulars of the alliance of the\r\n    Central Powers, signed at Vienna between Germany and Austria in\r\n    October, 1879, and ratified at Berlin on October 18th of that year, to\r\n    which Italy had afterwards adhered.' [Footnote: Sir Charles knew that\r\n    Prince Bismarck had tried first for an English alliance, and wrote on\r\n    August 17th, 1882, to Sir M. Grant Duff: \"N. Rothschild told me that\r\n    the late Government had twice declined an offensive and defensive\r\n    alliance offered by Germany.\" See also _Life of Lord Granville_, vol.\r\n    ii., p. 211.]\r\n\r\nAn extension was contemplated which would have put France between two\r\nfires. Later, in the autumn of 1883,\r\n\r\n    'a private letter from Morier to Lord Granville showed that Bismarck\r\n    had sent the Crown Prince of Germany to Spain to induce Spain to join\r\n    the \"peace league\"' (Triple Alliance), 'and had failed.'\r\n\r\nOn November 22nd, 1883,\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet I saw a telegram from Lord Dufferin, No. 86, received\r\n    late on the previous night, in which the Sultan asked our advice as to\r\n    offers of alliance in the event of immediate general war, which had\r\n    probably been made him by both sides. We replied to it after the\r\n    Cabinet (No. 68): \"We cannot enter into hypothetical engagements or\r\n    make arrangements in contemplation of war between friendly Powers now\r\n    at peace. The Sultan must be aware that Germany is the most powerful\r\n    military nation on the Continent, and that she has no ambitious views\r\n    against Turkey. Strongly advise the Sultan not to enter into\r\n    entangling engagements.\" This whole story of the Sultan's was probably\r\n    a lie, to get us to say whether we would defend his Armenian frontier,\r\n    but, curiously enough, Dufferin seemed to believe it.'\r\n\r\n    'On May 24th, 1883, I informed the Ministers assembled of two\r\n    interesting matters of foreign affairs. The one was Bismarck's\r\n    denunciation to us of a league among the small Christian States of the\r\n    Balkan Peninsula for provoking popular votes in Turkey in favour of\r\n    annexation of various provinces to one or other of the partners. The\r\n    other was an offer by the Grand Sherif of Mecca to turn the Turks out\r\n    of Arabia, and place it under British protection.'\r\n\r\nThe gravest danger to the world's peace lay in the fact that to the\r\nordinary Englishman Russia was still the natural enemy, and that France,\r\nsmarting under the rebuff she had experienced in Egypt, was assuming a\r\nmore unfriendly attitude towards Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa the state of things established after Majuba was revealing\r\nitself as one of constant friction, and border wars between the Boers and\r\nAfrican tribes claiming British protection led to ceaseless controversy.\r\n\r\n    'On the 10th (March, '83) there was another Cabinet. A Transvaal\r\n    debate was coming on on Thursday the 15th, and in view of this\r\n    Chamberlain asked for support of his opinion that an expedition should\r\n    be sent out to save Montsioa. He was supported only by Hartington and\r\n    myself, but he afterwards managed to commit us to it, and to force his\r\n    view upon Mr. Gladstone. He passed a paper to me when he found we\r\n    could not win at the Cabinet: \"How far would the difficulty be met by\r\n    supplying arms to Mankowane and (query) to Montsioa, and permitting\r\n    volunteers to go to their assistance?\" I replied, \"I don't think it\r\n    would stand House of Commons discussion.\" To this he answered,\r\n    \"Perhaps not. But the first is what Mankowane himself asks for, and if\r\n    we gave him what he wants that course ought to be defensible.\" I\r\n    wrote, \"Yes, I was thinking more of Montsioa.\"' [Footnote: Mankowane\r\n    and Montsioa were independent native chiefs of Bechuanaland, for whose\r\n    protection the Aborigines' Protection Society was appealing to the\r\n    British Government.]\r\n\r\n    'March 16th, 1883, Mr. Gladstone asked me to speak in the event of the\r\n    Transvaal debate coming on again, and I refused, as I did not agree in\r\n    the policy pursued. Chamberlain said he would speak in my place, and\r\n    did so.\r\n\r\n    'May 26th or 27th. We decided at the Cabinet to keep Basutoland.\r\n\r\n    'June 13th. As to South Africa, the Colonial Office told us that they\r\n    hoped to induce the Cape to take Bechuanaland. A little later on the\r\n    whole of their efforts were directed in the opposite direction--\r\n    namely, to induce the Cape to let us keep Bechuanaland separate from\r\n    the Cape. It was announced that Reay had accepted the Transvaal\r\n    Mission.\r\n\r\n    'June 23rd. We decided that Reay was not to go out, because the\r\n    Transvaal people preferred to come to us.\r\n\r\n    'November 30th. We talked of the Transvaal, which looked bad.'\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal deputation is mentioned immediately after this as having\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThere are also allusions to South African affairs having been raised at\r\nother Cabinets in this year, but no details given.\r\n\r\nLate in 1883, Sir Charles says, 'I was pressing for the restoration of\r\nCetewayo, and Lord Derby insisted that he had brought all his troubles on\r\nhimself.'\r\n\r\nAt this time Russia had subdued the Turcomans and made herself paramount\r\nin the territories north of Persia and Afghanistan. It was only a matter\r\nof months before Russian troops would be on the ill-defined frontiers of\r\nAfghanistan. Great Britain was bound to the Amir of Afghanistan by an\r\nengagement to assist him against external attack, provided that he\r\ncomplied with British advice as to his foreign relations. Not only was a\r\ncollision predicted between Russia and the Amir, whose territory Great\r\nBritain had thus guaranteed, but it was known where the struggle would be.\r\n\r\n    'It was also about this time' (February, 1883) 'that the Russian\r\n    Government took up my suggestion as to the delimitation of the\r\n    boundary of Afghanistan. But, as Currie wrote, \"the object of the\r\n    Russian Foreign Office may only be to keep the British Government\r\n    quiet, while they are settling the boundary question with Persia and\r\n    annexing ... Merv, with a view to a fresh departure in the direction\r\n    of Herat as soon as that process is accomplished.\"'\r\n\r\n    'We already foresaw that the struggle would be over Penjdeh. A\r\n    memorandum of 1882, by Major Napier, [Footnote: Lieutenant-Colonel the\r\n    Hon. G. C. Napier, C.I.E., son of the first Lord Napier of Magdala,\r\n    and twin brother of the second Lord Napier.] had told us that \"below\r\n    Penjdeh the Afghans would not appear to have ever extended their\r\n    authority.\" Mr. Currie, [Footnote: Afterwards Lord Currie, Assistant\r\n    Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office.] as he then was, prophesied\r\n    that the line proposed by the Russians would strike the Murghab near\r\n    Penjdeh.'\r\n\r\nThis was a situation well fitted to arouse Sir Charles, who wrote to Lord\r\nEdmond Fitzmaurice: \"I'm as great a jingo in Central Asia as I am a\r\nscuttler in South Africa.\" His policy was not that of the India Office. He\r\nadvocated delimitation of the Afghan frontiers, and in October, 1882, the\r\nAmir had asked for this. [Footnote: 'On October 17th, 1882, the Amir had\r\nproposed to Lord Ripon that delimitation of his frontiers which I was\r\npressing at the time, but which had been refused by Lord Ripon. Lord\r\nGranville and Fitzmaurice had come round to my view. Northbrook strongly\r\nresisted, and wanted his famous treaty.'] 'The Government of India\r\ninsisted at this time upon the proposal to Russia of a treaty with regard\r\nto Afghanistan.' Sir Charles thought that British interests in India would\r\nbe better served by strengthening Afghanistan, by ascertaining exactly\r\nwhat the Amir's rights were, and by making him feel that he would be\r\nprotected in them. To-day, when Afghanistan is one of the self-equipping\r\nAsiatic military powers, and admittedly an awkward enemy to tackle, the\r\nsituation seems plain enough; but in those days Abdurrahman, new on the\r\nthrone, was still a 'King with opposition.'\r\n\r\n    'On April 20th, 1883, there was a meeting at the Foreign Office as to\r\n    Central Asia between Lord Granville, Hartington, Kimberley,\r\n    Northbrook, Edmond Fitzmaurice, and myself. The Amir was in a friendly\r\n    humour, and I felt that the evacuation of Kandahar had been better\r\n    than a dozen victories.'\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Kandahar had been Lord Ripon's work, but Lord Ripon was\r\nnow inclining to compromise the unity of the Native State which he had\r\nthen laboured to establish. He was disposed to keep the Amir at arm's\r\nlength, and wished to decline a visit of ceremony which Abdurrahman\r\nproposed. All the Committee at the Foreign Office were against this,\r\nexcept Lord Northbrook, who 'did not believe in Abdurrahman's strength,\r\nand believed that he would soon be turned out of Herat by his own\r\nGovernor.'\r\n\r\n'On June 7th it was settled that the Amir should have twelve lakhs of\r\nrupees a year.' But Sir Charles had not yet carried his point as to\r\npreventing a treaty with Russia, and\r\n\r\n    'Philip Currie and Fitzmaurice both wrote to me in favour of the India\r\n    Office view, while Condie Stephen [Footnote: Sir Alexander Condie\r\n    Stephen, K.C.M.G., was in 1882-83 despatched from the Legation at\r\n    Teheran on a mission to Khorassan, the north-east province of Persia]\r\n    returned from Central Asia with the same view in favour of a\r\n    treaty.... But Currie put a postscript to his long letter, in which he\r\n    departed altogether from the treaty position, and took up my own view\r\n    as to delimitation: \"In view of our engagement to defend Afghanistan\r\n    from foreign aggression, we ought surely to know the limits of the\r\n    territory we have guaranteed.\"\r\n\r\n    'I finally said that I had no objection to a treaty which would merely\r\n    recapitulate facts and set out the Afghan frontier. This was my last\r\n    word, and, Lord Granville agreeing with me, we went on with\r\n    delimitation as against treaty.... It was not until June 8th, 1888,\r\n    that the Emperor of Russia recognized the arrangement and the frontier\r\n    marked by the boundary pillars.'\r\n\r\nFor Sir Charles's policy it was necessary to propitiate the ruler of\r\nAfghanistan, and in July, 1883, it was reported that the Amir had applied\r\nto the British Government for a new set of teeth. The application had\r\nreally been for a European dentist. When Lord Ripon persisted in refusing\r\nAbdurrahman's proffered visit, Sir Charles tried to get civil expressions\r\nof regret from the Government, and, failing in this, wrote in despair to\r\nLord Kimberley: \"I hope to goodness he has got his teeth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till 1885 that the tension with Russia became really\r\nacute.\r\n\r\nIn France, Gambetta's death had been followed by a Ministerial crisis, and\r\nin the disturbances which resulted M. Duclerc fell in February, 1883, and\r\nafter a time of confusion M. Ferry became, for a second time, Prime\r\nMinister, having M. Challemel-Lacour, no lover of England, for his Foreign\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\"In order to distract the country's attention from internal dissensions\r\nand the Eastern frontier,\" [Footnote: _Life of Lord Granville_, vol. ii.,\r\np. 313.] M. Ferry developed that \"Colonial policy\" of which Sir Charles\r\nsaid, in 1887, that\r\n\r\n    \"it greatly weakens the military position of France in Europe, and\r\n    disorganizes her finances, while it compromises the efficiency of the\r\n    only thing which really counts in modern European war, the rapidity of\r\n    mobilization of the reserves.\" [Footnote: _Present Position of\r\n    European Politics_, p. 101.]\r\n\r\nGermany also was embarking on a \"Colonial policy\" disapproved of by\r\nBismarck, but to which later he had to bow. One instance of the\r\ndifficulties thus created was that of the Congo. A sketch of our proposed\r\ntreaty with Portugal has already been given; [Footnote: See Chapter XXVI.,\r\np. 418.] but while the negotiations were proceeding,\r\n\r\n    'de Brazza, employed by the French, had been making treaties in the\r\n    Congo district, which had been approved by the French Government and\r\n    Parliament. The King of the Belgians pulled the strings of the\r\n    Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and succeeded in arousing a good deal\r\n    of feeling against our negotiations with the Portuguese, and\r\n    ultimately the French and Germans joined the King of the Belgians in\r\n    stopping our carrying through our treaty.'\r\n\r\nMr. Jacob Bright became the spokesman of those who opposed the Portuguese\r\nnegotiations, and in 1883 Sir Charles, though offering to express his own\r\nclear belief that the treaty was right, foretold to Lord Granville that\r\nthe House of Commons would not accept the arrangement, and Mr. Gladstone\r\navoided an adverse vote only by promising that the treaty should not be\r\nmade without the express consent of Parliament. Sir Charles's reference to\r\nthis lays down an opinion upon the relation of Parliament to the Foreign\r\nOffice which is interesting as coming from so strong a democrat:\r\n\r\n    'In the Congo debate, which took place on Tuesday, April 3rd, 1883,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone went perilously near giving up the valuable treaty-\r\n    making power of the Crown. What he said, however, applied in terms\r\n    only to this one case. To Grant Duff I wrote: \"In all other countries\r\n    having parliamentary government, the Parliaments have to be consulted.\r\n    We stood alone, and it was hard to keep the special position, but it\r\n    was good for the country, I feel sure.\"'\r\n\r\nIn 1883 a Committee of the Cabinet was appointed to deal with affairs on\r\nthe West Coast of Africa, and this Committee 'by its delays and\r\nhesitations lost us the Cameroons,' where two native Kings had asked to be\r\ntaken under British protection. [Footnote: See Chapter XXVII., p. 431.] On\r\nthe East Coast there was a more serious result of procrastination in\r\nregard to Zanzibar.\r\n\r\n    'As late as November 16th, 1882, I wrote to Lord Northbrook, \"Are you\r\n    going to let Zanzibar die without a kick?\" a note which applied to an\r\n    offer which had been made to us by the Sultan, that we should become\r\n    his heirs--an offer which Mr. Gladstone had wished us to decline, and\r\n    which I was in favour of accepting.'\r\n\r\n    'The Foreign Office, in a memorandum upon this subject, assigned as\r\n    the chief reason for not accepting this trust \"the fear lest it should\r\n    infringe the agreement entered into with France in 1862.\" ... It may\r\n    be open to argument whether our acceptance of a voluntary offer by the\r\n    Sultan of the above nature would have been a breach of the agreement.\r\n    In the autumn of 1884 the Government, waking up too late, telegraphed\r\n    to our agent at Zanzibar as to the importance of our not being\r\n    forestalled by any European nation in the exercise of at least\r\n    paramount influence over the mountain districts situated near the\r\n    coast and to the north of the equator. The Foreign Office at my\r\n    suggestion pointed out at this time that \"to the north of the\r\n    Portuguese dominions we are at present, but who can say for how long?\r\n    without a European rival; where the political future of the country is\r\n    of real importance to Indian and Imperial interests, where the climate\r\n    is superior, where commerce is capable of vast extension, and where\r\n    our influence could be exercised unchecked by the rivalry of Europe in\r\n    the extension of civilization and the consequent extinction of the\r\n    slave trade.\" The Government, however, delayed too long, and we\r\n    afterwards lost our position at Zanzibar, and had ultimately to buy\r\n    half of it back again by the cession of a British colony.'\r\n    (Heligoland).\r\n\r\nSir Charles was especially concerned at the heedlessness which disregarded\r\nthe interests of the great self-governing colonies, who had no authority\r\nto deal with foreign affairs. He gives the history of the New Hebrides.\r\nHere native chiefs had asked to be taken under British protection; New\r\nSouth Wales had urged action; the French had three times declared\r\nintention to annex, but Great Britain had done nothing. Australian anxiety\r\nas to the French occupation extended to New Guinea, and in March, 1883,\r\nofficials of the Government of Queensland declared an annexation of half\r\nNew Guinea. They were disavowed, but their action had created a feeling\r\nthat something must be done.\r\n\r\n    'On June 12th, 1883, there was hatched a scheme for the partial\r\n    annexation of New Guinea, which had been prepared by the Chancellor,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone, and Sir Arthur Gordon, [Footnote: Sir Arthur Gordon was\r\n    one of the philanthropists who believed in making the coloured peoples\r\n    work by a labour tax. Sir Charles had met him in 1879, and described\r\n    him as one 'who invented, in the name of civilization and progress, a\r\n    new kind of slavery in Fiji.'] of Fiji and New Zealand fame. On the\r\n    13th a Cabinet decided to go slowly in this matter, and they went so\r\n    slowly that we lost half of our half of New Guinea to Germany, and\r\n    almost lost the whole of it.'\r\n\r\n    'As early as June, 1883, we had told Italy that any attempt to occupy\r\n    any portion of New Guinea without a previous agreement with the\r\n    British Government would undoubtedly \"excite a violent outbreak of\r\n    public feeling in the Australian colonies.\" Lord Derby was a party to\r\n    this communication to the Italians, and it was absurd for the Cabinet\r\n    and Lord Derby afterwards to argue, when the Germans landed in New\r\n    Guinea, that steps ought not to have been taken in advance to have\r\n    prevented such action. The difference was that we were willing to\r\n    bully Italy, and not willing to stand up to Germany.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Secretary's general attitude upon these matters may be\r\nillustrated from a correspondence which passed between him and Sir Charles\r\nin the autumn of this year. Replying to criticisms concerning the\r\nAustralian Colonies, Lord Derby\r\n\r\n    'somewhat sneeringly observed that in order to keep out foreign\r\n    convicts \"it is not necessary that they should annex every island\r\n    within a thousand miles of their coast. They cannot have at once the\r\n    protection of British connection and the pleasures of a wholly\r\n    independent foreign policy.\"'\r\n\r\nOn this Sir Charles comments:\r\n\r\n    'Lord Derby had lost all credit with the Conservative party about the\r\n    time of his resignation of the Secretaryship of State for Foreign\r\n    Affairs in the Conservative Administration. But he had retained\r\n    considerable weight with Liberals. During his tenure of the\r\n    Secretaryship of State for the Colonies in Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    Administration, he lost his credit with the Liberals as well, and his\r\n    influence reached a position of decline which makes it difficult even\r\n    to remember the enormous weight he had possessed in the earliest part\r\n    of his political career. For many years Lord Derby was the ideal\r\n    spokesman of the middle man not fiercely attached to either party.\r\n    Going over this diary in 1900, it is a curious reflection that the\r\n    immense weight gained by Sir Edward Grey in the period between 1890\r\n    and 1900 was similar to that which Lord Derby had enjoyed at the\r\n    earlier period. Each of them in his time appeared to express, though\r\n    far from old, the lifelong judgment of a Nestor. Each of them extorted\r\n    from the hearer or reader the feeling: \"What this man says is\r\n    unanswerable. It is the dispassionate utterance of one who knows\r\n    everything, and has thought it out in the simplest but the most\r\n    convincing form.\" Lord Derby could sum up a discussion better,\r\n    probably, than anyone has ever done, unless it is Sir Edward Grey. Sir\r\n    Edward Grey's summing up of a discussion on a difficult problem, such\r\n    as that presented by the Chinese question, 1897-1900, was better than\r\n    was to be expected from anyone else, unless it had been the Lord\r\n    Stanley of, say, thirty-five years before.'\r\n\r\nOn May 27th\r\n\r\n    'I dined at Marlborough House at a dinner to meet a little tin soldier\r\n    cousin in white epaulettes, who was over from Germany ... and (the\r\n    German Ambassador) Count Münster told me that the French had hoisted\r\n    their flag on a reef, as he said, within cannon-shot of Jersey, as to\r\n    the British or neutral nature of which there had long been a dispute\r\n    between the two Governments.' [Footnote: The Memoir has a note upon\r\n    this episode of the Ecréhous Books, which led to the publication of\r\n    Parliamentary papers in June of that year:\r\n\r\n    'The rocks were not within three miles of the coast of Jersey at low-\r\n    water mark, and this was the limit of the reservation of the Jersey\r\n    oyster fishery, and it was upon this fact that the French went. It\r\n    afterwards appeared that the French flag never had been hoisted on the\r\n    rocks, but only on a boat which came thither for the purpose of\r\n    fishing, so that the whole matter was somewhat of a storm in a teacup.\r\n    It raised, however, another question. The Convention of 1839, which\r\n    defined the limits of the oyster fishery between Jersey and France,\r\n    also defined the limits of the exclusive French rights of fishery on\r\n    all other parts of the coast of the British islands; and some day an\r\n    Irish Parliament may find interest in Sir Edward Hertslet's\r\n    \"Memorandum as to the French right of fishery upon the coast of\r\n    Ireland, printed for the Foreign Office on the 5th June, 1883.\"']\r\n\r\n    'On May 28th there was a Levee, at which d'Aunay, of the French\r\n    Embassy, told me that the act of the fishermen at Ecréhous was\r\n    disavowed by France. \"But,\" he added, \"there is perhaps some Challemel\r\n    in it,\" an admission which rather weakened the other statement, and it\r\n    again struck me that it was a pity we had been so rude to Challemel\r\n    when he was Ambassador.'\r\n\r\nRelations with France were going from bad to worse. Not only were they\r\nstrained by the breach of 1882 over Egypt, but French colonizing\r\naspirations had created trouble in Madagascar. The understanding between\r\nthe two Great Powers that an \"identic attitude\" in regard to the Hova\r\npeople was to be maintained was broken down by France, which under various\r\npretexts intervened by force in Madagascar, claiming a protectorate over\r\ncertain narrow strips of territory on the north-west coast. This claim was\r\ndenounced by Lord Granville. Yet 'on October 27th, 1882, there was a\r\ndinner at Lord Granville's, at which I met Hartington, Kimberley, and\r\nNorthbrook.' This meeting of the heads of the military and foreign\r\nservices discussed the affairs of the Congo, and also Madagascar; 'it was\r\ndecided against my strong opposition to put no difficulties in the way of\r\nthe French. 'At this time the growing tension was disagreeably felt, and\r\nSir Charles learnt a month later that the Cabinet of November 28th, 1882,\r\n'had been much frightened at the prospect of trouble with France.'\r\n\r\nAt this time an Embassy from Madagascar was in Paris to protest against\r\nthe oppressive policy pursued. An ultimatum was presented which left the\r\nenvoys no option but to depart, and they came with their bitter complaint\r\nto London, where Sir Charles Dilke very warmly espoused their cause:\r\n\r\n    'At this moment, December 1st, 1882, I was having difficulties with\r\n    Lord Granville about Madagascar, as I was seeing much of the Malagasy\r\n    envoys, and was very friendly to them; whereas Lord Granville was\r\n    frightened of the French. A deputation came to us, got up by Chesson,\r\n    Secretary of the Aborigines' Protection Society, and introduced by\r\n    Forster; it suggested American arbitration, and Lord Granville threw\r\n    much cold water upon the scheme.'\r\n\r\nA few days later he adds:\r\n\r\n    'I was still at this moment fighting for my Malagasy friends. Not only\r\n    did Lord Granville snub me, but Courtney wrote from the Treasury: \"I\r\n    hope you will get rid of these people as soon as possible. Even the\r\n    Baby Jenkins sees the absurdity of the anti-French feeling.\" But\r\n    whatever \"Ginx's Baby\" might do, I could not see the absurdity of the\r\n    anti-French feeling with regard to Madagascar, for the French were\r\n    wantonly interfering with an interesting civilized black people in\r\n    whose country they had not even trade, for All the trade was in\r\n    American, British, or German hands.\r\n\r\n    'On December 15th, 1882, there was a fresh trouble, for Lord Granville\r\n    was furious at a speech by Lord Derby, and, indeed, I never knew him\r\n    so cross about anything at all. The difficulty was once more\r\n    Madagascar. Lord Granville _meant_ to do nothing about Madagascar, but\r\n    he did not like Lord Derby saying so in public. It spoiled his play,\r\n    by allowing his French adversary to look over his hand and see how bad\r\n    the cards were.'\r\n\r\nThe Malagasys were unique in that since 1869 they had become definitely a\r\nChristian State, and a State Christianized by English missionaries, and\r\nthis fact was impressively brought home to Sir Charles by a scene which he\r\nafterwards (in 1886) thus described in a public lecture:\r\n\r\n    \"At Westminster Abbey there came in to the Morning Service the whole\r\n    of the members of the Madagascar Embassy, which had just come to\r\n    London from France. The two Malagasy Ambassadors were at the head of\r\n    the party. They sat very silently through the service, which the\r\n    senior Ambassador did not understand at all, and which the second\r\n    Ambassador only partly understood, until a hymn which had been given\r\n    out was sung, when, recognizing the familiar tune, the two Ambassadors\r\n    and the whole of their secretaries struck boldly in with the Malagasy\r\n    words. There could be no better instant proof, to anyone who saw the\r\n    scene, of their familiarity with the missionary teaching of England\r\n    and America, and of the extent to which, though separated from us by\r\n    language, they look upon themselves as members of the Christian\r\n    Church.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1882-83 Sir Charles failed to interest his colleagues in the matter,\r\ntill on August 22nd, 1883, just before Parliament was prorogued, the\r\nCabinet had to discuss 'what was known as the Tamatave incident, which\r\nnearly brought England and France to war over matters growing out of the\r\nFrench operations in Madagascar.'\r\n\r\nThe town of Tamatave had been bombarded and occupied by the French in\r\nJune. The matter was aggravated by the treatment of the British Consul and\r\nof a British missionary, and difficulties were made as to adequate apology\r\nand indemnity.\r\n\r\n    'In the course of September I had frequent interviews with Fitzmaurice\r\n    at the Foreign Office with regard to Madagascar.... Lord Granville\r\n    wrote to me, about the middle of October, that (the French Ambassador)\r\n    Waddington \"professed to have a solution of the Tamatave\" difficulty,\r\n    and on the 22nd a Cabinet was called with regard to the Tamatave\r\n    difficulty, Egypt, and South Africa. The French despatch from\r\n    Challemel to Waddington was most unsatisfactory.'\r\n\r\n    Another Cabinet having been summoned for October 25th, Harcourt wrote:\r\n    \"I have heard nothing about its cause or object, but conjecture that\r\n    it is Granville's Cabinet for France.... It is ominous Northbrook\r\n    (First Lord of the Admiralty) being a principal assistant. I am myself\r\n    for being _stiff_ with France.\"\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet was upon the two points of Tamatave and withdrawal from\r\n    Egypt, but, in the absurd way in which Cabinets behave when summoned\r\n    upon important questions, we spent most of our time in discussing a\r\n    scheme of Lefevre's for widening Parliament Street; Mr. Gladstone\r\n    wishing to widen King Street and to make a fork. A Committee was\r\n    appointed on the matter, to consist of Harcourt, Childers, Lefevre,\r\n    Northbrook, and myself. Hartington came late as usual, and on his\r\n    arrival our Tamatave despatch was discussed.'\r\n\r\nThe complete destruction of the native State and dynasty did not come at\r\nthis time, and French \"protection\" of Madagascar was only recognized by\r\nLord Salisbury's Government in 1890. But the encroachments of France led\r\nin this year to further friction, arising from their conflict for the\r\npossession of Tonquin. On November 17th the Cabinet discussed 'the\r\nprotection of British subjects in China in view of a French attack on the\r\nChinese Empire, and decided to concert measures with Germany and the\r\nUnited States.' On the 19th they proposed to France mediation in the\r\nChinese difficulty, 'with the full expectation that it would be refused.'\r\n\r\n    'On December 7th there was a paragraph in the _Times_ in large type\r\n    intended to reassure the French, by stating that our interference in\r\n    China to protect our own subjects was not combined with Germany in\r\n    particular. The paragraph, although it may have been wanted, was\r\n    untrue. We _had_ combined our action with the Germans, and then found\r\n    it was resented by the French.'\r\n\r\nSo dissension grew at a pace which enabled Bismarck to turn his attention\r\nfrom European politics, and, in one of his many meetings with Count\r\nHerbert, Sir Charles reports that about the second week in November\r\n\r\n    'I had a conversation with H. Bismarck about his father. He said that\r\n    the Prince had turned as yellow as a guinea, and could not now work\r\n    more than an hour at a time, and that the only thing on which he\r\n    troubled himself was his workman's insurance scheme.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nEGYPT AFTER TEL-EL-KEBIR\r\nSEPTEMBER, 1882, TO DECEMBER, 1883\r\n\r\n\r\n    'On September 19th, 1882, at noon we had a conference at the War\r\n    Office with regard to the future of Egypt, at which were present Lord\r\n    Granville, Childers, Sir Auckland Colvin, and myself, and which was\r\n    followed afterwards by a further conference, when there were admitted\r\n    to us Pauncefote for the Foreign Office and Sir Louis Mallet for the\r\n    India Office, Admiral Sir Cooper Key for the Admiralty, Sir F.\r\n    Thompson, Permanent Under-Secretary for War, and Generals Sir Andrew\r\n    Clarke and Sir Henry Norman for the War Office. In preparation for the\r\n    conference I had stirred up Lord Granville as to the volunteering of\r\n    Indian Moslem troops for the Khedive's guard. But Lord Granville in\r\n    his reply to me was more concerned with abusing my handwriting in\r\n    choice language than with answering my questions. Hartington, however,\r\n    had telegraphed to India for me on the 17th to ask the opinion of the\r\n    Indian Government on the point. Harcourt, writing from Balmoral on the\r\n    19th, said: \"If you have any ideas on the settlement of Egypt, I wish\r\n    you would let me have them. I confess I am myself _in nubibus_, and I\r\n    do not find that my betters are much more enlightened. I am constantly\r\n    asked here what we are going to propose, and I do not know what to\r\n    say. I have written to Mr. G. and to Lord G. to ask for light, but I\r\n    should like to have your own personal views as to what is practicable.\r\n    I think we must cut the cord between Egypt and Turkey, but one cannot\r\n    conceal from oneself that the consequences will be serious, and may\r\n    lead to far-reaching complications. The one good thing is that\r\n    Bismarck is honestly friendly, and I believe will support us in\r\n    whatever we propose. Austria seems to be almost as nasty as Russia,\r\n    and France naturally jealous. I suppose Bismarck can and will keep\r\n    Austria in order. Please write me a real letter on these knotty\r\n    points.\"\r\n\r\n    'Our Egyptian conference decided upon free navigation of the Canal,\r\n    or, in other words, that ships of war were to pass at all times; on\r\n    increased influence for England on the Directorate of the Canal; and\r\n    on the destruction of the Egyptian fortresses. Childers promised to\r\n    prepare a scheme for taking over the Egyptian railroads. A paper by us\r\n    was printed for the use of the Cabinet on October 20th, in which we\r\n    stated our views about the Canal, and incidentally our decision\r\n    against a British protectorate of Egypt. The arrangement proposed by\r\n    us was pretty much that afterwards agreed upon by the Powers.'\r\n\r\nBefore this paper was issued Sir Charles had seen Émile Ollivier, who, as\r\na legal adviser of the Khedive, 'had great knowledge of the affairs of the\r\nSuez Canal':\r\n\r\n    'I possess the draft of a full memorandum of Ollivier's conversation\r\n    which I sent to Lord Granville, and which represented his private\r\n    protests to Lesseps and his argument to the Khedive. Ollivier, who was\r\n    more English than French in the matter, accepted the position that by\r\n    the Khedival decree of August 14th England had been substituted for\r\n    the Khedive in all measures for the re-establishment of order in\r\n    Egypt, and that it was under this decree that we occupied the ends of\r\n    the Canal as the delegates of the Khedive; therefore there was no\r\n    violation of the neutrality, and when the Canal Company on August 19th\r\n    set up as a new Great Power, and addressed to the Khedive a diplomatic\r\n    note, their arguments became nonsensical, inasmuch as they virtually\r\n    argued that the Khedive himself had violated his own neutrality by an\r\n    internal act. Moreover, the neutrality of the Canal had never been\r\n    declared at all. The word \"neutral\" was indeed found in the original\r\n    concession, but it evidently meant that the Company was not to give to\r\n    one Power an advantage not given to others as regards trade and\r\n    passage. Lesseps had set up the Canal as a new Great Power, whereas it\r\n    was only an Egyptian Limited Company.\r\n\r\n    'Even, however, if the Canal had been neutral, Ollivier would have\r\n    argued against the Company that the suppression of an internal\r\n    rebellion in the Khedive's name, at his request, was not war or\r\n    violation of neutrality. It was the duty of the Khedive to suppress\r\n    rebellion, and the duty of the Canal as an Egyptian Company to aid,\r\n    and not to impede, as it had impeded, the lawful action of the\r\n    Egyptian ruler through his representatives. It had not been contended\r\n    by the Porte, as the overlord of the Khedive, that the Khedive had not\r\n    power to delegate authority to England to suppress Arabi's rebellion.\r\n    The Porte had delegated to France power to suppress the rebellion in\r\n    Syria in 1860 in its name. Lesseps seemed to think that it was within\r\n    the power of the Khedive to delegate to him sovereignty over the\r\n    Canal, and not in his power to delegate to anybody else the\r\n    suppression of a rebellion.'\r\n\r\nA casual reference at this point recalls the fact that the Khedive's\r\ndethroned predecessor was still moving about the world and capable of\r\ncausing trouble. Sir Charles went abroad for his autumn vacation:\r\n\r\n    'In Paris' (in the middle of October) 'I found a letter from Lord\r\n    Granville as to a visit which the ex-Khedive Ismail proposed to pay to\r\n    London. Lord Granville said that the Government could not object to\r\n    his \"coming to this country. But at this moment his arrival would be\r\n    misunderstood, and any civilities, which in other circumstances they\r\n    would be desirous to show to His Highness, would lead to\r\n    misconstruction.\"' [Footnote: 'In November, 1883, the ex-Khedive had\r\n    come to London, and when asked to see him, at his wish, I at first\r\n    refused, but as, after he clearly understood that I knew him to be a\r\n    rascal, he wished to see me \"all the same,\" I saw him privately at\r\n    Lady Marian Alford's house in Kensington; but he had little to say,\r\n    and seemed very stupid.' ]\r\n\r\n    'I was at this time in correspondence with my friend d'Estournelles,\r\n    [Footnote: Baron d'Estournelles de Constant.] who was Acting Resident\r\n    at Tunis, as to the capitulations. In the course of his letter\r\n    d'Estournelles expressed his bitter regret that France had not gone to\r\n    Egypt with us.'\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Charles came back to London from France on October 20th, the\r\nCabinet was still vacillating as to its Egyptian policy:\r\n\r\n    'I had found on my return that nothing had been done towards setting\r\n    up such an Egyptian Army as could take the place of our own, although\r\n    Sir Charles Wilson, Colonel Valentine Baker, Baring, [Footnote: Major\r\n    Evelyn Baring, afterwards Lord Cromer, was then Financial Member of\r\n    Council in India. Sir Charles Wilson (Colonel Wilson) must not be\r\n    confounded with Sir Charles Rivers Wilson. Colonel Valentine Baker was\r\n    head of the Egyptian Gendarmerie.] and others, had written memoranda\r\n    upon the subject. Baring, in the course of his memorandum, strongly\r\n    defended the honesty, humanity, and conscience of the Khedive, and\r\n    opposed annexation and protectorate. On the whole, Baring's memorandum\r\n    was a better one than that of his relative Lord Northbrook, or that of\r\n    Lord Dufferin, which afterwards attracted much attention. Chamberlain\r\n    and I discussed on Saturday, October 21st, a letter to me from\r\n    Labouchere, in which the latter seemed to take a different view from\r\n    that recorded above. Labouchere said that the dissatisfaction with the\r\n    Egyptian policy was growing, that we seemed to be administering Egypt\r\n    mainly for the good of the bondholders. He was a bondholder, so it\r\n    could not be said that he was personally prejudiced against such a\r\n    policy. But he was sure that it would not go down.\r\n\r\n    'He went on to recommend the policy which I was in fact maintaining--\r\n    namely, that we should warn off other Powers, hand Egypt over to the\r\n    Egyptians, but, establishing our own influence over the Canal, remain\r\n    masters of the position so far as we needed to do so. Chamberlain\r\n    wrote on Labouchere's letter: \"I am convinced the war was submitted to\r\n    rather than approved by Radicals, and, unless we can snub the\r\n    bondholders in our reorganization scheme, we may suffer for it. I have\r\n    written a long paper upon the subject, and sent it to Mr. G. I have\r\n    arranged for a copy to be sent you.\"'\r\n\r\nA further Cabinet held on Saturday, October 21st, \"decided\" (so Sir\r\nCharles noted in his Diary at the moment) \"to be very civil to the French\r\n--too civil by half, I think. They rejected a complicated scheme of Lord\r\nGranville's, and substituted a single English (not to be so expressed)\r\ncontroller (not to be so called).\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the autumn Session was approaching, in which the thorny\r\nsubject of reforming Parliamentary procedure must be disposed of, and the\r\nCabinet were preoccupied with this till 6 p.m. on October 23rd. They\r\n\r\n    'scamped their work on the draft despatch to Lord Lyons as to what he\r\n    was to tell the French as to Egypt, and so made a wretched job of it.\r\n    At night I pointed this out to Lord Granville, and told him that the\r\n    despatch was slipslop, and on the next day, October 24th, I managed to\r\n    get a good many changes made--one by telegraph, and the others by an\r\n    amending despatch.'\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain's view of Lord Granville's proposals was that they were\r\n    childishly insincere. Europe would not be deceived into believing them\r\n    to be anything more than a proposal to restore the old system in its\r\n    entirety, with an English nominee as controller in place of the dual\r\n    control. Nothing, Chamberlain thought, was being done to develop\r\n    Egyptian interests or promote Egyptian liberties.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain was absent from some of the Cabinets at this moment,\r\n    detained at Birmingham by the gout, but his memorandum was sent round\r\n    the Cabinet. He was, however, in London on October 24th to assist me\r\n    in somewhat improving the despatch. His memoranda show the strong view\r\n    he held that, in spite of the almost unanimous approval of the Press,\r\n    the war had not been popular, but had only been accepted on the\r\n    authority of Mr. Gladstone as a disagreeable necessity; and that\r\n    dissatisfaction existed upon several points, but above all with regard\r\n    to the civil reorganization of the country. \"There is great anxiety\r\n    lest after all the bondholders should be the only persons who have\r\n    profited by the war, and lest the phrases which have been used\r\n    concerning the extension of Egyptian liberties should prove to have no\r\n    practical meaning.\" Chamberlain thought that our first duty was to our\r\n    principles and our supporters rather than towards other Powers, and\r\n    that, if the other Powers insisted upon financial control, we should\r\n    at least put forward as our own the legitimate aspirations of Egyptian\r\n    national sentiment. Chamberlain refused to believe that an Egyptian\r\n    Chamber would repudiate the debt, inasmuch as such a course of action\r\n    would at once render them liable to interference by the Great Powers.'\r\n\r\n    'On October 27th, 1882, there was a dinner at Lord Granville's, at\r\n    which I met Lords Hartington, Kimberley, and Northbrook' (representing\r\n    India, the Colonies, and the Admiralty). 'I noted with regard to\r\n    Egypt:\r\n\r\n    '\"Chamber of Notables: decided to do nothing, at which I am furious.\r\n    What do four peers know about popular feeling?\"'\r\n\r\nIn view of the temper of the House of Commons, Sir Charles Dilke warned\r\nLord Granville by letter of the danger that the Fourth Party might carry\r\n\"the mass of the Tories\" with Liberals on a cry for the \"liberties of the\r\nEgyptian people.\" Considerable delay was occasioned by negotiations as to\r\nwhether Arabi and his associates should or should not be represented by\r\nEuropean counsel at their trial, and in the interval rumours were set\r\nafloat as to ill usage of them in prison.\r\n\r\n    'I had had in the course of this week a good deal of trouble in the\r\n    House of Commons, caused by a sensational telegram in the _Daily\r\n    News_, and a letter from a Swiss Arabist in the _Times_ containing\r\n    most ridiculous lies as to the treatment of political prisoners in\r\n    Egypt, but believed by our supporters, who were backed up by the\r\n    Fourth Party.'\r\n\r\nThese attacks involved the British Agent-General in Egypt, and Sir Edward\r\nMalet felt the situation cruelly. He telegraphed home begging to be\r\nrelieved from the sole responsibility.\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, October 29th, 1882, Lord Granville, with the gout, got the\r\n    French refusal of our proposals, and the bad news from the Soudan'\r\n    (where the Mahdi was laying siege to El Obeid, the capital of\r\n    Kordofan). 'He called a Cabinet, but only five Ministers were in town,\r\n    so it was decided that it was not to be called a Cabinet.'\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, October 31st, the Queen, who had at first approved of the\r\n    idea of Dufferin being sent to Egypt to supersede Malet, had now been\r\n    turned against him by Wolseley, who was staying with her, and, not\r\n    having seen the telegrams of the 27th, because we had made them into\r\n    private telegrams and kept them back, told us that she thought that to\r\n    send Dufferin was bad treatment of Malet. We had therefore to send her\r\n    Malet's telegrams in order to persuade her that it was necessary that\r\n    Dufferin should go.'\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, November 6th, there was held at the House of Commons, by\r\n    Lord Granville's wish, a meeting at which were present, besides Lord\r\n    Granville and myself, Hartington, Childers, Harcourt, Chamberlain, and\r\n    Dodson. We met to consider a further violent refusal by France of all\r\n    our proposals. Chamberlain and Harcourt were strong in the one sense,\r\n    and Hartington in the other, while Childers and Dodson sat meek like\r\n    mice. Hartington was fiercely for the old control, Harcourt and\r\n    Chamberlain against all control, and no one except Lord Granville in\r\n    favour of the proposals which were actually made, and Lord Granville a\r\n    man who constitutionally would always prefer a compromise to a clear\r\n    course. None of them knew what to do. I noted that I wished they would\r\n    not first agree upon some foolish course, and then call me in when it\r\n    had been taken beyond all possibility of alteration. When I was\r\n    talking to Brett afterwards, he said of his chief, Hartington, that it\r\n    was somewhat a pity that, being so violent as he always was in\r\n    Cabinet, he should frequently forget what his opinions were on\r\n    particular questions, as, for example, closure and county franchise.'\r\n\r\n    'Brett also told me that the Queen, to whom, he said, Lord Granville\r\n    had had to \"crawl\" for having sent Lord Dufferin to Egypt, was now\r\n    still more furious with him because the instructions to Dufferin had\r\n    been sent off on Friday, the 3rd, without her having seen them.\r\n\r\n    'Having trouble in the House with regard to the legal points connected\r\n    with the trial of Arabi, I had at the time frequent meetings with Lord\r\n    Selborne, who drew draft answers to the questions in the House of\r\n    Commons, which were ingenious, but hardly suited to the Commons\r\n    atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    'On the 8th there was a Cabinet at which Mr. Gladstone only attended\r\n    for a minute, merely to prevent his name being omitted from the list.\r\n    He was ostentatiously devoting himself to procedure only, and taking\r\n    no part with regard to Egypt.\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, the 10th, Count Münster called on me to tell me that\r\n    Prince Bismarck objected to any plan for a temporary dealing with\r\n    Egyptian finance, as he feared panic towards the end of the term\r\n    fixed; but the Ambassador said that the Chancellor attached no\r\n    importance to any form of control.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, November 13th, I had a formal conference at the House of\r\n    Lords with the Chancellor, the Attorney-General, and Pauncefote, on\r\n    the whole of the legal questions connected with the trial of Arabi and\r\n    our position in Egypt; and I cannot but think that Lord Selborne in\r\n    all those many letters to me about the subject, which I have retained,\r\n    showed himself given rather to legal quibbles than to a broad view of\r\n    the questions raised. At three o'clock there was a Cabinet to consider\r\n    whether a day should be given to Bourke for the discussion of a\r\n    motion, but the Cabinet went on to decide to accept a suggestion by\r\n    Childers and Chamberlain that the sending of a Turkish envoy to Egypt\r\n    was to involve the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Turkey.\r\n    Six members, however, stopped after Mr. Gladstone, Chamberlain, and\r\n    Childers had gone away, and toned down the phrase to be made use of to\r\n    Musurus Pasha.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, November 14th, we had a Suez Canal conference at Lord\r\n    Granville's at noon, and in the afternoon a Congo deputation. Between\r\n    the two we discussed at Lord Granville's house (Kimberley, Northbrook,\r\n    Carlingford, and Childers being present with Lord Granville and\r\n    myself) the question of the employment of Baker Pasha in Egypt as\r\n    Chief of the Staff.... Coming back to the Suez Canal question,\r\n    Childers, who wished us to obtain preponderance, made a characteristic\r\n    observation, saying: \"_I would do it boldly_ by making the Khedive\r\n    say--\" It struck me that some people had an odd idea of boldness.\r\n\r\n    'On November 15th we had a further meeting on the Canal question at\r\n    Mr. Gladstone's room at the House.... When all had come, there were\r\n    present Childers, Hartington, Northbrook, Kimberley, Carlingford, Lord\r\n    Granville, and myself. I found that Count Münster had not told Lord\r\n    Granville that which he had told me on November 10th. It was decided\r\n    to send my notes, based on my conversations with Ollivier, to\r\n    Dufferin. With regard to Arabi's trial, it was decided that Dufferin\r\n    should be told to consider the case against him, and to decide that\r\n    there was no proof of common crime, after which, by arrangement\r\n    between us and the Khedive, we were to put him away safely in\r\n    Ascension, Barbados, Bermuda, Ceylon; or any other island than St.\r\n    Helena, which would be ridiculous. Mr. Gladstone had written us a\r\n    letter proposing that we should make the Sultan banish Arabi, but we\r\n    did not much like the idea of his coming to England and stumping the\r\n    country between Wilfrid Lawson and Wilfrid Blunt. Childers asked leave\r\n    to arrest any Turkish envoy who might be sent to Cairo, but the matter\r\n    was left open.'\r\n\r\nOn November 16th the Cabinet again 'discussed the fate of Arabi, and\r\ndecided to let him run riot anywhere; but the decision was afterwards\r\nreversed.'\r\n\r\nOn November 21st\r\n\r\n    'there was sent off to Lord Dufferin a personal telegram to say that\r\n    Baker was to be sent to fight in the Soudan, and that another\r\n    Englishman must be chosen for his post, that Arabi was to be interned\r\n    on some island on parole.\r\n\r\n    'I received letters at this time from Lord Dufferin on his arrival at\r\n    Cairo, asking me to keep him informed of my views on the Egyptian\r\n    situation.\r\n\r\n    'On December 4th there was a Cabinet which decided to send Arabi to\r\n    Ceylon, but after a consultation with Lord Ripon, whose advice was not\r\n    to be followed if it was hostile; and on the next day Lord Ripon\r\n    protested, as had been foreseen.\r\n\r\n    'Evelyn Wood, who was to command the Egyptian Army, asked the Cabinet\r\n    for such large figures as to startle them.'\r\n\r\n    'I heard from Dufferin also in December from Cairo, in reply to\r\n    Chamberlain's memorandum. He thought that Egyptian Members of\r\n    Parliament would many of them be tools in the hands of the Sultan or\r\n    of foreign Powers, but added that he would sooner run any risk than\r\n    wholly abandon representative institutions. \"But I think we should\r\n    make a mistake if we forced upon this country premature arrangements\r\n    which we dare not apply to India, where the strength of our own\r\n    position and other circumstances afford not only better guarantees for\r\n    success, but the power of retreating if the experiment should prove a\r\n    failure.\"\r\n\r\n    'In a further letter Lord Dufferin confirmed a story which I had heard\r\n    as to Halim having bribed Arabi and the other Egyptian Colonels, but\r\n    most of the money stuck to the hands of the agent who was employed.'\r\n\r\n    \"Two days after I had left the Foreign Office, Hartington wrote to me\r\n    to ask whether his soldiers might pay military honours to the holy\r\n    carpet on its return from Mecca--an amusing example of the kind of\r\n    question with which British Ministers are sometimes called on to\r\ndeal.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Dilke's promotion to the Cabinet,\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, February 15th, 1883, Parliament met, and I was very hard\r\n    worked, and on February 17th had heavy business in the House with\r\n    regard to Egypt, as revealed in the division of the previous night, in\r\n    which we only had a majority of thirty-five, although I had been\r\n    permitted distinctly to announce our intention to withdraw our troops,\r\n    and not to stay permanently in the country. This, after all, was a\r\n    mere expansion of the promise given to the Powers by Lord Granville in\r\n    his circular despatch of January 3rd, in which he said that we were\r\n    desirous of withdrawing British force as soon as the state of the\r\n    country would permit.\r\n\r\n    'In the meantime the Soudan was in a disturbed condition. On January\r\n    1st, 1883, we had heard from Cairo: \"Second false prophet appeared,\r\n    hung by first;\" or, as the despatch by post expanding the telegram put\r\n    it, \"A second Mahdi has lately appeared, but was hung by order of the\r\n    first.\" The Mahdi, however, was making progress. The Foreign Office\r\n    were inclined to adopt some responsibility for the Egyptian attempt to\r\n    defeat the Mahdi, and reconquer the Soudan; but I invariably insisted\r\n    on striking out all such words from their despatches, and, so far as I\r\n    know, no dangerous language was allowed to pass. In consequence of my\r\n    observations a despatch was sent by Lord Granville to our consulate in\r\n    Egypt, pointing out that telegrams had been received from General\r\n    Hicks in relation to his military operations in the Soudan, and that\r\n    Lord Granville understood that these were messages intended for\r\n    General Baker, and only addressed to the consulate because Hicks found\r\n    it convenient to make use of the cipher which had been entrusted to\r\n    Colonel Stewart, who was acting as our Consul at Khartoum; but we\r\n    repeated that \"H. M. G. are in no way responsible for the operations\r\n    in the Soudan, which have been undertaken under the authority of the\r\n    Egyptian Government, or for the appointment or actions of General\r\n    Hicks.\" At this time the Turkish Government were supplying the Mahdi\r\n    with money and officers in the hope that the troubles in the Soudan\r\n    would afford them an excuse for sending troops to \"assist the\r\n    Khedive.\" As we continued to get telegrams from Hicks Pasha, Sir\r\n    Edward Malet informed the Egyptian Government by letter that we must\r\n    repeat that we had no responsibility for the operations in the Soudan.\r\n    We foresaw the failure of the Hicks expedition, and should perhaps\r\n    have done better had we more distinctly told the Egyptian Government\r\n    that they must stop it and give up the Soudan, holding Khartoum only;\r\n    but to say this is to be wise after the event. What we did was to\r\n    \"offer no advice, but\" point out that the Egyptian Government should\r\n    make up their minds what their policy was to be, and carefully\r\n    consider whether they could afford the cost of putting down the Mahdi.\r\n    In other words, we discouraged the expedition without forbidding it. I\r\n    fear, however, that Malet, against our wish, was a party to the\r\n    sending of reinforcements \"to follow up successes already obtained\";\r\n    for after his conversation with the Egyptian Prime Minister he added:\r\n    \"This view seems reasonable.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n    'On May 4th; 1883, I noted in my Diary, in reference to a matter which\r\n    I have named, that Colonel Hicks's telegram to Malet, about which both\r\n    Hicks and Malet would be reproved, the British Government having\r\n    nothing to do with the expedition, was to request that communications\r\n    should be made to General Baker which were, in fact, intended for Sir\r\n    Evelyn Wood. This showed how completely it had been settled in advance\r\n    that Baker should command the Egyptian Army, for Hicks in the Soudan\r\n    fully believed that Baker was in command.'\r\n\r\nExpressions of opinion in England had, however, prevented this\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nAnother entry indicates that French opinion was beginning to accept the\r\nBritish position in Egypt as a _fait accompli_:\r\n\r\n    'On May 2nd, 1883, d'Aunay, the French Secretary, told me that\r\n    Waddington was coming as Ambassador, and intended to ask for Syria for\r\n    the French as a compensation for our position in Egypt.'....\r\n\r\nDuring the summer there was much negotiation concerning the Suez Canal,\r\nand the proposal to cut a rival waterway.\r\n\r\n    'On July 4th there was a meeting of Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville,\r\n    Childers, Chamberlain, and myself, as to the Suez Canal, and we\r\n    decided to ask Lesseps to come over and meet us. Childers had a scheme\r\n    with regard to the Canal, to which only Chamberlain and I in the\r\n    Cabinet were opposed.\r\n\r\n    'On July 19th there was another Cabinet. Chamberlain and I tried to\r\n    get them to drop Childers's Canal scheme, but they would not. The\r\n    Cabinet was adjourned to the 23rd, and on Monday, the 23rd, they\r\n    dropped it.'\r\n\r\nIn the end, however, M. de Lesseps won. An entry of November 22nd follows\r\nup the question of widening the Canal:\r\n\r\n    'Another matter which was active at this moment was that of the\r\n    position of Lesseps, with whom we had now made peace, and to whom we\r\n    had given our permission for the widening of the first Canal. We\r\n    supported him against the Turkish Government, who wanted to screw\r\n    money out of him for their assent, and got the opinion of the law\r\n    officers of the Crown to show that no Turkish assent was needed. On a\r\n    former occasion we had contended that his privileges must be construed\r\n    strictly, as he was a monopolist. On this occasion the law officers\r\n    took a more liberal view. The fact is that the questions referred to\r\n    the law officers for opinions by the Foreign Office have very often\r\n    much more connection with policy than with law, and their opinions are\r\n    elastic. There never were such law officers as James and Herschell.\r\n    They did their work with extraordinary promptitude and decision, and\r\n    with the highest possible skill. They never differed, and they always\r\n    gave us exactly what we wanted in the best form. Comparing their\r\n    opinions with those of law officers of other days, which I often at\r\n    the Foreign Office had to read, I should call James and Herschell\r\n    unsurpassed and unsurpassable for such a purpose. Lord Selborne, who\r\n    was, I suppose, a much greater lawyer, was nothing like so good for\r\n    matters of this kind, for he always tried to find a legal basis for\r\n    his view, which made it unintelligible to laymen.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    'On August 7th I had to set to work hard to read up all the Egyptian\r\n    papers in order to support Fitzmaurice on the 9th. In the course of\r\n    this speech I announced our intention from November, 1883, to allow\r\n    Sir Evelyn Wood to maintain order in Cairo with his Egyptian forces,\r\n    we withdrawing the British forces to Alexandria. There was a Cabinet\r\n    on the 8th, at which, after a good deal of fighting, it had been\r\n    decided, against Hartington, to allow me to make the statement with\r\n    regard to Egypt which I made upon the 9th.'\r\n\r\nBy August 22nd Lord Hartington had 'come round so fast that he told us he\r\nwould be able to evacuate Cairo even before our meeting in October.' On\r\nAugust 31st Sir Charles Dilke 'received Sir Evelyn Wood, who was anxious\r\nto assure me that he was perfectly able to hold Egypt with his Egyptians.'\r\n\r\nThe report did not wholly convince Sir Charles, and he expressed some of\r\nhis doubts to Lord Granville, with whom Sir Evelyn Wood had been staying\r\nat Walmer.\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville wrote: \"His conversation gives one more the notion of\r\n    activity, energy, and conscientiousness, than of great ability. I\r\n    presume you were not able to slip in a question, but, on the other\r\n    hand, if you had succeeded he would not have heard it. He is in favour\r\n    of the complete evacuation of Cairo.... He has full confidence in that\r\n    half of the Egyptian Army which is officered by English officers. He\r\n    has only a negative confidence in the other half. Evelyn Baring will\r\n    find a private letter on his arrival, and a despatch by this mail,\r\n    instructing him to send us a full report. Till we get this we had\r\n    better not go beyond the declarations which have already been publicly\r\n    made.\" Baring had just (September, '83) reached Cairo as Consul-\r\n    General.'\r\n\r\nGovernment policy shaped itself on the assumption that Sir Evelyn Wood was\r\nright. On October 25th\r\n\r\n    'we formally decided to leave Cairo and concentrate a force of between\r\n    2,000 and 3,000 men at Alexandria. This was no new decision, but was\r\n    taken on this occasion in order that the Queen should be informed,\r\n    which had not previously been done.'\r\n\r\nTen days after this date the Egyptian Army of the Soudan, under General\r\nHicks, was destroyed by the Mahdi in Kordofan. The news only reached Cairo\r\non November 22nd, and the question was now raised as to what should become\r\nof the upper valley of the Nile.\r\n\r\n    'On December 12th there was a meeting at the War Office about the\r\n    Soudan, Lord Granville, Hartington, Northbrook, Carlingford, and\r\n    myself, being present, with Wolseley in the next room, and the Duke of\r\n    Cambridge in the next but one. We again told the Egyptians that they\r\n    had better leave the Soudan and defend Egypt at Wady Halfa, and that\r\n    we would help them to defend Egypt proper. Wolseley was at one time\r\n    called in, as was Colonel Stewart, the last man who had left Khartoum.\r\n    Lord Granville told Hartington, who was starting for Windsor, what to\r\n    tell the Queen, and I noted that \"the old stagers, like Lord Granville\r\n    and Mr. Gladstone, waste a great deal of their time on concocting\r\n    stories for the Queen, who is much too clever to be taken in by them,\r\n    and always ends by finding out exactly what they are doing. It is\r\n    certainly a case where honesty would be a better policy.\"\r\n\r\n    'I cannot but think that Malet was largely responsible for the state\r\n    of things in Egypt (Lord Granville being so far responsible that I had\r\n    much difficulty in getting him to interfere against Malet), and that\r\n    we had interfered somewhat late.... Malet left before the army\r\n    commanded by Hicks was surrounded, and it was on Baring that the blow\r\n    fell. But Baring was always strongly opposed to the attempt of the\r\n    Egyptians to reconquer the Soudan, and, moreover, thought that they\r\n    were quite unfit to govern it. Immediately after the bad news about\r\n    Hicks first came, Baring told us that Khartoum must fall, and\r\n    recommended us to tell the Egyptian Government, which we did, that\r\n    under no circumstances must they expect the assistance of British or\r\n    Indian troops in the Soudan. We even stopped their sending Wood's army\r\n    to the Soudan, and we told Baring not to encourage retired British\r\n    officers to volunteer, and told him to recommend the evacuation of the\r\n    Soudan. On December 3rd Baring sent us a most able report upon the\r\n    whole situation, and he and General Stephenson commanding the British\r\n    troops, Sir Evelyn Wood commanding the Egyptian Army, and General\r\n    Baker, were all of opinion that it was impossible to hold Khartoum,\r\n    and that the Egyptians must be made to fall back on Wady Halfa. On the\r\n    other hand, the Egyptian Government could not make up their minds to\r\n    leave Khartoum. Malet up to the last days of his stay in Egypt was\r\n    rendering himself, in fact, responsible for the Hicks expedition and\r\n    for the Soudan policy of the Egyptians, and there is one fatal\r\n    despatch of his in existence in which he relates how he interfered, at\r\n    the wish of Hicks, to suggest a change of Egyptian Governor. He was\r\n    privately censured for this, but he was publicly approved for his\r\n    whole course, and therefore we were in a sense responsible, although\r\n    we expressly repudiated this responsibility in our despatches to him,\r\n    and forced the Egyptian Government to acknowledge that they thoroughly\r\n    understood our repudiation. The only thing that could have been done\r\n    more than was done would have been to have publicly censured Malet,\r\n    and Lord Granville should have had the courage to do this.\r\n\r\n    'In September I had succeeded in getting Edgar Vincent appointed to\r\n    the Egyptian Cabinet as the English financier, virtually Prime\r\n    Minister; but, able as he was, it was a long time before he felt his\r\n    feet, and could take the government into his own hands.' [Footnote:\r\n    When on August 15th Mr. (afterwards Sir) Edgar Vincent dined in Sloane\r\n    Street with Edward Hamilton, Mr. Gladstone's private secretary, and\r\n    some other people, Sir Charles noted that he 'was once more struck\r\n    with the extraordinary strength displayed by Vincent for a man of\r\n    twenty-four.']\r\n\r\n    'Two additional points concerning Egypt which should be mentioned here\r\n    are, in the first place, Lord Granville's mistake in creating a place\r\n    with Egyptian pay, at Lord Spencer's wish, for Clifford Lloyd, who had\r\n    made Ireland too hot to hold him; and, in the second place, the\r\n    violent protests of the Anti-Slavery Society, backed up by ours in\r\n    December, as to the employment of Zebehr Pasha. We should undoubtedly\r\n    have been censured by the House of Commons had we allowed any\r\n    important place to have been given to Zebehr Pasha, but it was\r\n    difficult to prevent it when it was wished both by the Egyptians and\r\n    by Baring--given the fact that we had washed our hands of their Soudan\r\n    policy.\r\n\r\n    'What we should have done, if I may be allowed to be wise after the\r\n    event, was to have distinctly ordered the Egyptians to abandon\r\n    Khartoum and to fall back to Wady Halfa. At the end of the year Baring\r\n    forwarded to us a memorandum from the Egyptian Government. They\r\n    pointed out that the Khedive was forbidden by Turkey to cede\r\n    territory; that we were asking them to abandon enormous provinces,\r\n    with Berber and Dongola, and great tribes who had remained loyal. They\r\n    thought that if they fell back Egypt would have to continually resist\r\n    the attacks of great numbers of fanatics, and that the Bedouin\r\n    themselves would rise. They were wrong, but they put their case so\r\n    well that they converted Baring; and he told us that he doubted if any\r\n    native Ministers could be found willing to carry out the policy of\r\n    retirement, and he thought that it would be necessary to appoint\r\n    English Ministers if we decided to force it on them.\r\n\r\n    'In the last lines of Baring's despatch of December 22nd there occur\r\n    words which afterwards became of great importance: \"If the abandonment\r\n    policy is carried out ... it will be necessary to send an English\r\n    officer of high authority to Khartoum, with full powers to withdraw\r\n    the garrisons and to make the best arrangements he can for the future\r\n    government of the country.\" It was on those words that we acted in\r\n    sending for Gordon, and asking him whether he would go to the Soudan\r\n    for this purpose, which he agreed to do, and when we sent him there\r\n    was no question of his going for any other purpose than this.'\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I",
