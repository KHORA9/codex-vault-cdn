I tried at every probable place in Paris, and could not\r\nget a tolerable one. I have been glad of it since I came here, as I find\r\nthem much better made here. I now deliver one, with this letter, into\r\nthe hands of Mr. Fulwar Skipwith, a merchant from Virginia, settled\r\nhere, who promises to send it to you, with one for Mr. C. Thomson. Of\r\nthis be pleased to accept, from me. It is now found, that they may be\r\nused with almost any oil.\r\n\r\nI expect to leave this place in about three days. Our public letters,\r\njoint and separate, will inform you what has been done, and what could\r\nnot be done here. With respect to a commercial treaty with this country,\r\nbe assured, that this government not only has it not in contemplation\r\nat present to make any, but that they do not conceive that any\r\ncircumstances will arise, which shall render it expedient for them to\r\nhave any political connection with us. They think we shall be glad of\r\ntheir commerce on their own terms. There is no party in our favor here,\r\neither in power or out of power. Even the opposition concur with the\r\nministry and the nation in this. I can scarcely consider as a party, the\r\nMarquis of Lansdowne, and a half dozen characters about him, such as Dr.\r\nPrice, &c. who are impressed with the utility of a friendly connection\r\nwith us. The former does not venture this sentiment in parliament, and\r\nthe latter are not in situations to be heard. The Marquis of Lansdowne\r\nspoke to me affectionately of your brother, Doctor Lee, and desired his\r\nrespects to him, which I beg leave to communicate through you. Were\r\nhe to come into the ministry (of which there is not the most distant\r\nprospect), he must adopt the King’s system, or go out again, as he did\r\nbefore, for daring to depart from it. When we see, that through all the\r\nchanges of ministry, which have taken place during the present reign,\r\nthere has never been a change of system with respect to America, we\r\ncannot reasonably doubt, that this is the system of the King himself.\r\nHis obstinacy of character we know; his hostility we have known, and\r\nit is embittered by ill success. If ever this nation, during his life,\r\nenter into arrangements with us, it must be in consequence of events,\r\nof which they do not at present see a possibility. The object of the\r\npresent ministry is to buoy up the nation with flattering calculations\r\nof their present prosperity, and to make them believe they are better\r\nwithout us than with us. This they seriously believe; for what is it\r\nmen cannot be made to believe? I dined the other day in a company of the\r\nministerial party. A General Clark, a Scotchman and ministerialist, sat\r\nnext to me. He introduced the subject of American affairs, and in\r\nthe course of the conversation told me, that were America to petition\r\nparliament to be again received on their former footing, the petition\r\nwould be very generally rejected. He was serious in this, and I think\r\nit was the sentiment of the company, and is the sentiment perhaps of the\r\nnation. In this they are wise, but for a foolish reason. They think they\r\nlost more by suffering us to participate of their commercial privileges,\r\nat home and abroad, than they lose by our political severance. The true\r\nreason, however, why such an application should be rejected, is, that in\r\na very short time we should oblige them to add another hundred millions\r\nto their debt, in unsuccessful attempts to retain the subjection offered\r\nto them. They are at present in a frenzy, and will not be recovered from\r\nit, till they shall have leaped the precipice they are now so boldly\r\nadvancing to. Writing from England, I write you nothing but English\r\nnews. The continent, at present, furnishes nothing interesting. I shall\r\nhope the favor of your letters, at times. The proceedings and views of\r\nCongress and of the Assemblies, the opinions and dispositions of\r\nour people in general, which, in governments like ours, must be the\r\nfoundation of measures, will always be interesting to me, as will\r\nwhatever respects your own health and happiness; being with great\r\nesteem,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.--TO CHARLES THOMSON, April 22, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.\r\n\r\nLondon, April 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn one of your former letters, you expressed a wish to have one of the\r\nnewly invented lamps. I find them made here much better than at Paris,\r\nand take the liberty of asking your acceptance of one, which will\r\naccompany this letter. It is now found, that any tolerable oil may be\r\nused in them. The spermaceti oil is best, of the cheap kinds.\r\n\r\nI could write you volumes on the improvements which I find made, and\r\nmaking here, in the arts. One deserves particular notice, because it\r\nis simple, great, and likely to have extensive consequences. It is\r\nthe application of steam, as an agent for working grist-mills. I have\r\nvisited the one lately made here. It was at that time turning eight pair\r\nof stones. It consumes one hundred bushels of coal a day. It is proposed\r\nto put up thirty pair of stones. I do not know whether the quantity\r\nof fuel is to be increased. I hear you are applying the same agent in\r\nAmerica to navigate boats, and I have little doubt, but that it will\r\nbe applied generally to machines, so as to supersede the use of water\r\nponds, and of course to lay open all the streams for navigation. We\r\nknow, that steam is one of the most powerful engines we can employ;\r\nand in America fuel is abundant. I find no new publication here worth\r\nsending to you. I shall set out for Paris within three or four days. Our\r\npublic letters will inform you of our public proceedings here.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.--TO JOHN JAY, April 23, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nLondon, April 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of March the 12th, I had the honor of explaining to you\r\nthe motives which had brought me to this place. A joint letter from Mr.\r\nAdams and myself, sent by the last packet, informed you of the result\r\nof our conferences with the Tripoline minister. The conferences with\r\nthe minister of Portugal have, been drawn to a greater length than I\r\nexpected. However, every thing is now agreed, and the treaty will be\r\nready for signature the day after to-morrow. I shall set out for Paris\r\nthe same day. With this country nothing is done: and that nothing is\r\nintended to be done, on their part, admits not the smallest doubt. The\r\nnation is against any change of measures: the ministers are against it;\r\nsome from principle, others from subserviency: and the King, more than\r\nall men, is against it. If we take a retrospect to the beginning of the\r\npresent reign, we observe, that amidst all the changes of ministry, no\r\nchange of measures with respect to America ever took place; excepting\r\nonly at the moment of the peace; and the minister of that moment was\r\nimmediately removed. Judging of the future by the past, I do not expect\r\na change of disposition during the present reign, which bids fair to\r\nbe a long one, as the King is healthy and temperate. That he is\r\npersevering, we know. If he ever changes his plan, it will be in\r\nconsequence of events, which, at present, neither himself nor his\r\nministers place among those which are probable. Even the opposition dare\r\nnot open their lips in favor of a connection with us, so unpopular would\r\nbe the topic. It is not, that they think our commerce unimportant to\r\nthem. I find that the merchants here set sufficient value on it. But\r\nthey are sure of keeping it on their own terms. No better proof can be\r\nshown of the security in which the ministers think themselves on this\r\nhead, than that they have not thought it worth while to give us a\r\nconference on the subject, though, on my arrival, we exhibited to them\r\nour commission, observed to them that it would expire on the 12th of\r\nthe next month, and that I had come over on purpose to see if any\r\narrangements could be made before that time. Of two months which then\r\nremained, six weeks have elapsed without one scrip of a pen, or one word\r\nfrom a minister, except a vague proposition at an accidental meeting.\r\nWe availed ourselves even of that, to make another essay to extort some\r\nsort of declaration from the court. But their silence is invincible.\r\nBut of all this, as well as of the proceedings in the negotiation with\r\nPortugal, information will be given you by a joint letter from Mr. Adams\r\nand myself. The moment is certainly arrived, when, the plan of this\r\ncourt being out of all doubt, Congress and the States may decide what\r\ntheir own measures should be.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Lansdowne spoke of you in very friendly terms, and\r\ndesired me to present his respects to you, in the first letter I should\r\nwrite. He is thoroughly sensible of the folly of the present measures\r\nof this country, as are a few other characters about him. Dr. Price is\r\namong these, and is particularly disturbed at the present prospect. He\r\nacknowledges, however, that all change is desperate: which weighs the\r\nmore, as he is intimate with Mr. Pitt. This small band of friends,\r\nfavorable as it is, does not pretend to say one word in public on our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nSir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.--TO JOHN JAY, April 23, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nLondon, April 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn another letter of this day, I stated to you what had passed with\r\npublic characters since my arrival here. Conversations with private\r\nindividuals, I thought it best not to mingle with the contents of that\r\nletter. Yet, as some have taken place, which relate to matters within\r\nour instructions, and with persons whose opinions deserve to have some\r\nweight, I will take the liberty of stating them. In a conversation with\r\nan ancient and respectable merchant of this place, such a view of the\r\ntrue state of the commercial connections of America and Great Britain\r\nwas presented to him, as induced him to acknowledge they had been\r\nmistaken in their opinions, and to ask, that Mr. Adams and myself would\r\npermit the chairman of the committee of American merchants to call on\r\nus. He observed, that the same person happened to be also chairman of\r\nthe committee of the whole body of British merchants; and that such was\r\nthe respect paid to his person and office, that we might consider what\r\ncame from him, as coming from the committees themselves. He called on\r\nus at an appointed hour. He was a Mr. Duncan Campbell, formerly much\r\nconcerned in the American trade. We entered on the subject of the\r\nnon-execution of the late treaty of peace, alleged on both sides.\r\nWe observed, that the refusal to deliver the western posts, and the\r\nwithdrawing American property, contrary to express stipulation, having\r\npreceded what they considered as breaches on our part, were to be\r\nconsidered as the causes of our proceedings. The obstructions thrown\r\nby our legislatures in the way of the recovery of their debts, were\r\ninsisted on by him. We observed to him, that the great amount of the\r\ndebt from America to Great Britain, and the little circulating coin in\r\nthe formeer country, rendered an immediate payment impossible; that time\r\nwas necessary; that we had been authorized to enter into explanatory\r\narrangements on this subject; that we had made overtures for the\r\npurpose, which had not been attended to, and that the States had,\r\ntherefore, been obliged to modify the article for themselves. He\r\nacknowledged the impossibility of immediate payment, the propriety of\r\nan explanatory convention, and said, that they were disposed to allow\r\na reasonable time. We mentioned the term of five years, including the\r\npresent; but that judgments might be allowed immediately, only dividing\r\nthe execution into equal and annual parts, so that the last should be\r\nlevied by the close of the year 1790. This seemed to be quite agreeable\r\nto him, and to be as short a term as would be insisted on by them.\r\nProceeding to the sum to be demanded, we agreed that the principal, with\r\nthe interest incurring before and after the war, should be paid; but\r\nas to that incurring during the war, we differed from him. He urged its\r\njustice with respect to themselves, who had laid out of the use of their\r\nmoney during that period. This was his only topic. We opposed to it all\r\nthose which circumstances, both public and private, gave rise to.\r\nHe appeared to feel their weight, but said the renunciation of this\r\ninterest was a bitter pill, and such a one as the merchants here could\r\nnot swallow. He wished, that no declaration should be made as to\r\nthis article: but we observed, that if we entered into explanatory\r\ndeclarations of the points unfavorable to us, we should expect, as a\r\nconsideration for this, corresponding declarations on the parts in\r\nour favor. In fact, we supposed his view was to leave this part of the\r\ninterest to stand on the general expressions of the treaty, that\r\nthey might avail themselves, in individual cases, of the favorable\r\ndispositions of debtors or of juries. We proceeded to the necessity of\r\narrangements of our future commerce, were it only as a means of\r\nenabling our country to pay its debts. We suggested, that they had been\r\ncontracted while certain modes of remittance had existed here, which\r\nhad been an inducement to us to contract these debts. He said he was not\r\nauthorized to speak on the subject of the future commerce. He appeared\r\nreally and feelingly anxious, that arrangements should be stipulated as\r\nto the payment of the old debts, said he would proceed in that moment to\r\nLord Caermarthen’s, and discuss the subject with him, and that we might\r\nexpect to hear from him. He took leave, and we have never since heard\r\nfrom him or any other person on the subject. Congress will judge how far\r\nthese conversations should influence their future proceedings, or those\r\nof the States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.--TO JAMES MADISON, April 25, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nLondon, April 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSome of the objects of the joint commission, with which we were honored\r\nby Congress, called me to this place about six weeks ago. To-morrow I\r\nset out on my return to Paris. With this nation nothing is done; and it\r\nis now decided, that they intend to do nothing with us.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI wrote you, in a former letter, on the subject of a Mr. Paradise,\r\nwho owns an estate in Virginia in right of his wife, and who has a\r\nconsiderable sum due to him in our loan office. Since I came here, I\r\nhave had opportunities of knowing his extreme personal worth, and his\r\nlosses by the late war. He is, from principle, a pure republican, while\r\nhis father was as warm a tory. His attachment to the American cause,\r\nand his candid warmth, brought him sometimes into altercations on the\r\nsubject with his father, and some persons interested in their variance,\r\nartfully brought up this subject of conversation whenever they met. It\r\nproduced a neglect in the father. He had already settled on him a sum of\r\nmoney in the funds: but would do no more, and probably would have undone\r\nthat, if he could. When remittances from Virginia were forbidden,\r\nthe profits of the Virginia estate were carried into our loan office.\r\nParadise was then obliged to begin to eat his capital in England: from\r\nthat, to part with conveniences, and to run in debt. His situation is\r\nnow distressing; and would be completely relieved, could he receive what\r\nis due to him from our State. He is coming over to settle there. His\r\nwife and family will follow him. I never ask unjust preferences for any\r\nbody. But if, by any just means, he can be helped to his money, I own\r\nI should be much gratified. The goodness of his heart, his kindness to\r\nAmericans before, during, and since the war, the purity of his political\r\nand moral character, interest me in the events impending over him, and\r\nwhich will infallibly be ruinous, if he fails to receive his money. I\r\nask of you, on his behalf, that in pursuing the path of right, you will\r\nbecome active for him, instead of being merely quiescent, as you might\r\nbe, were his merit and his misfortunes unknown to you.\r\n\r\nI have put into the hands of Mr. Fulwar Skipwith for you, a packet\r\ncontaining some catalogues, which he will forward. I am, with very\r\nsincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, May 3, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, May 3, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAfter begging leave to present my respects to your Excellency, on my\r\nreturn to this place, I take the liberty of offering to your attention\r\nsome papers, which I found on my arrival here, written by sundry\r\nmerchants of L’Orient and others, some of whom are citizens of the\r\nUnited States, and all of them concerned in the trade between the two\r\ncountries. This has been carried on by an exchange of the manufactures\r\nand produce of this country, for the produce of that, and principally\r\nfor tobacco, which, though, on its arrival here, confined to a single\r\npurchaser, has been received equally from all sellers. In confidence\r\nof a continuance of this practice, the merchants of both countries were\r\ncarrying on their commerce of exchange. A late contract by the Farm has,\r\nin a great measure, fixed in a single mercantile house the supplies of\r\ntobacco wanted for this country. This arrangement found the established\r\nmerchants with some tobacco on hand, some on the seas coming to them,\r\nand more still due. By the papers now enclosed, it seems, that there\r\nare six thousand four hundred and eight hogsheads in the single port of\r\nL’Orient. Whether government may interfere, as to articles furnished by\r\nthe merchants after they had notice of the contract before mentioned,\r\nmust depend on principles of policy. But those of justice seem to urge,\r\nthat, for commodities furnished before such notice, they should be so\r\nfar protected, as that they may wind up, without loss, the transactions\r\nin which the new arrangement found them actually engaged. Your\r\nExcellency is the best judge, how far it may be consistent with the\r\nrules of government, to interfere for their relief, and with you,\r\ntherefore, I beg leave entirely to rest their interests.\r\n\r\nInformation lately received, relative to the Barbary States, has\r\nsuggested, that it might be expedient, and perhaps necessary for us, to\r\npave the way to arrangements with them, by a previous application to the\r\nOttoman Porte. Your Excellency’s intimate acquaintance with this subject\r\nwould render your advice to us equally valuable and desirable. If you\r\nwould be pleased to permit me to wait on you, any day or hour which\r\nshall be most convenient to yourself, I should be much gratified by a\r\nlittle conversation with you on this subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency’s most\r\nobedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.--TO JOHN PAGE, May 4, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\nParis, May 4, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour two favors of March the 15th and August the 23, 1785, by Monsieur\r\nde la Croix, came to hand on the 15th of November. His return gives me\r\nan opportunity of sending you a copy of the Nautical Almanacs for 1786,\r\n7, 8, 9. There is no late and interesting publication here, or I would\r\nsend it by the same conveyance. With these almanacs, I pack a copy of\r\nsome Notes I wrote for Monsieur de Marbois, in the year 1781, of which I\r\nhad a few printed here. They were written in haste, and for his private\r\ninspection. A few friends having asked copies, I found it cheaper to\r\nprint than to write them. They will offer nothing new to you, not even\r\nas an oblation of my friendship for you, which is as old almost as we\r\nare ourselves. Mazzei brought me your favor of April the 27th. I thank\r\nyou much for your communications. Nothing can be more grateful at such\r\na distance. It is unfortunate, that most people think the occurrences\r\npassing daily under their eyes, are either known to all the world, or\r\nnot worth being known. They therefore do not give them place in their\r\nletters. I hope you will be so good as to continue your friendly\r\ninformation. The proceedings of our public bodies, the progress of the\r\npublic mind on interesting questions, the casualties which happen among\r\nour private friends, and whatever is interesting to yourself and family,\r\nwill always be anxiously received by me. There is one circumstance in\r\nthe work you were concerned in, which has not yet come to my knowledge;\r\nto wit, How far westward from Fort Pitt, does the western boundary of\r\nPennsylvania pass, and where does it strike the Ohio? The proposition\r\nyou mention from Mr. Anderson, on the purchase of tobacco, I would have\r\nmade use of, but that I have engaged the abuses of the tobacco trade on\r\na more general scale. I confess their redress is by no means certain;\r\nbut till I see all hope of removing the evil by the roots desperate, I\r\ncannot propose to prune its branches.\r\n\r\nI returned but three or four days ago, from a two months’ trip to\r\nEngland. I traversed that country much, and own, both town and country\r\nfell short of my expectations. Comparing it with this, I found a much\r\ngreater proportion of barrens, a soil, in other parts, not naturally so\r\ngood as this, not better cultivated, but better manured, and therefore\r\nmore productive. This proceeds from the practice of long leases there,\r\nand short ones here. The laboring people here, are poorer than in\r\nEngland. They pay about one half their produce in rent; the English, in\r\ngeneral, about a third. The gardening, in that country, is the article\r\nin which it surpasses all the earth. I mean their pleasure gardening.\r\nThis, indeed, went far beyond my ideas. The city of London, though\r\nhandsomer than Paris, is not so handsome as Philadelphia. Their\r\narchitecture is in the most wretched style I ever saw, not meaning to\r\nexcept America, where it is bad, nor even Virginia, where it is worse\r\nthan in any other part of America which I have seen. The mechanical arts\r\nin London are carried to a wonderful perfection. But of these I need\r\nnot speak, because, of them my countrymen have unfortunately too many\r\nsamples before their eyes. I consider the extravagance which has seized\r\nthem, as a more baneful evil than toryism was during the war. It is the\r\nmore so, as the example is set by the best and most amiable characters\r\namong us. Would a missionary appear, who would make frugality the basis\r\nof his religious system, and go through the land, preaching it up as the\r\nonly road to salvation, I would join his school, though not generally\r\ndisposed to seek my religion out of the dictates of my own reason, and\r\nfeelings of my own heart. These things have been more deeply impressed\r\non my mind, by what I have heard and seen in England. That nation hate\r\nus, their ministers hate us, and their King, more than all other men.\r\nThey have the impudence to avow this, though they acknowledge our trade\r\nimportant to them. But they think, we cannot prevent our countrymen from\r\nbringing that into their laps. A conviction of this determines them\r\nto make no terms of commerce with us. They say, they will pocket\r\nour carrying trade as well as their own. Our overtures of commercial\r\narrangements have been treated with a derision, which shows their firm\r\npersuasion, that we shall never unite to suppress their commerce, or\r\neven to impede it. I think their hostility towards us is much more\r\ndeeply rooted at present, than during the war. In the arts, the most\r\nstriking thing I saw there, new, was the application of the principle\r\nof the steam-engine to grist-mills. I saw eight pair of stones which\r\nare worked by steam, and there are to be set up thirty pair in the same\r\nhouse. A hundred bushels of coal, a day, are consumed at present. I do\r\nnot know in what proportion the consumption will be increased by the\r\nadditional gear.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to present my respects to Mrs. Page and your family, to W.\r\nLewis, F. Willis, and their families, and to accept yourself assurances\r\nof the sincere regard, with which I am, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, May 5, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA visit of two months to England has been the cause of your not hearing\r\nfrom me during that period. Your letters of February the 3rd, to Mr.\r\nAdams and myself, and of February the 4th, to me, had come to hand\r\nbefore my departure. While I was in London, Mr. Adams received the\r\nletters giving information of Mr. Lambe’s arrival at Algiers. In London,\r\nwe had conferences with a Tripoline ambassador, now at that court, named\r\nAbdrahaman. He asked us thirty thousand guineas for a peace with his\r\ncourt, and as much for Tunis, for which he said he could answer. What we\r\nwere authorized to offer, being to this, but as a drop to a bucket,\r\nour conferences were repeated, only for the purpose of obtaining\r\ninformation. If the demands of Algiers and Morocco should be\r\nproportioned to this, according to their superior power, it is easy to\r\nforesee that the United States will not buy a peace with money. What\r\nprincipally led me to England was, the information that the Chevalier\r\ndel Pinto, Portuguese minister at that court, had received full powers\r\nto treat with us. I accordingly went there, and, in the course of six\r\nweeks, we arranged a commercial treaty between our two countries. His\r\npowers were only to negotiate, not to sign. And as I could not wait, Mr.\r\nAdams and myself signed, and the Chevalier del Pinto expected daily the\r\narrival of powers to do the same. The footing on which each has placed\r\nthe other, is that of the most favored nation. We wished much to have\r\nhad some privileges in their American possessions: but this was not\r\nto be effected. The right to import flour into Portugal, though not\r\nconceded by the treaty, we are not without hopes of obtaining.\r\n\r\nMy journey furnished us occasion to renew our overtures to the court\r\nof London; which it was the more important to do, as our powers to that\r\ncourt were to expire on the 12th of this month. These overtures were not\r\nattended to, and our commission expiring, we made our final report to\r\nCongress; and I suppose this the last offer of friendship, which will\r\never be made on our part. The treaty of peace being unexecuted on either\r\npart, in important points, each will now take their own measures for\r\nobtaining execution. I think the King, ministers, and nation are more\r\nbitterly hostile to us at present, than at any period of the late war.\r\nA like disposition on our part, has been rising for some time. In what\r\nevents these things will end, we cannot foresee. Our countrymen are\r\neager in their passions and enterprise, and not disposed to calculate\r\ntheir interests against these. Our enemies (for such they are, in fact)\r\nhave for twelve years past, followed but one uniform rule, that of doing\r\nexactly the contrary of what reason points out. Having early, during our\r\ncontest, observed this in the British conduct, I governed myself by it,\r\nin all prognostications of their measures; and I can say, with truth, it\r\nnever failed me but in the circumstance of their making peace with us. I\r\nhave no letters from America of later date than the new year. Mr. Adams\r\nhad, to the beginning of February. I am in hopes our letters will give a\r\nnew spur to the proposition, for investing Congress with the regulation\r\nof our commerce.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by a Baron Waltersdorf, a Danish gentleman,\r\nwhom, if you did not already know, I should take the liberty of\r\nrecommending to you. You were so kind as to write me, that you would\r\nforward me a particular map, which has not come to hand.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured of the respect and esteem, with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.--TO MR. DUMAS, May 6, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nParis, May 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHaving been absent in England, for some time past, your favors of\r\nFebruary the 27th, March the 28th, and April the 11th, have not been\r\nacknowledged so soon as they should have been. I am obliged to you, for\r\nassisting to make me known to the Rhingrave de Salm and the Marquis de\r\nla Coste, whose reputations render an acquaintance with them desirable.\r\nI have not yet seen either: but expect that honor from the Rhingrave\r\nvery soon. Your letters to Mr. Jay and Mr. Van Berkel, received in my\r\nabsence, will be forwarded by a gentleman who leaves this place for New\r\nYork, within a few days. I sent the treaty with Prussia by a gentleman\r\nwho sailed from Havre, the 11th of November. The arrival of that vessel\r\nin America is not yet known here. Though the time is not long enough to\r\nproduce despair, it is sufficiently so to give inquietude lest it should\r\nbe lost. This would be a cause of much concern to me: I beg the favor\r\nof you to mention this circumstance to the Baron de Thulemeyer, as an\r\napology for his not hearing from us. The last advices from America bring\r\nus nothing interesting. A principal object of my journey to London was,\r\nto enter into commercial arrangements with Portugal. This has been done\r\nalmost in the precise terms of those of Prussia. The English are still\r\nour enemies. The spirit existing there, and rising in America, has\r\na very lowering aspect. To what events it may give birth, I cannot\r\nforesee. We are young, and can survive them; but their rotten machine\r\nmust crush under the trial. The animosities of sovereigns are temporary,\r\nand may be allayed: but those which seize the whole body of a people,\r\nand of a people, too, who dictate their own measures, produce calamities\r\nof long duration. I shall not wonder to see the scenes of ancient Rome\r\nand Carthage renewed in our day; and if not pursued to the same issue,\r\nit may be, because the republic of modern powers will not permit the\r\nextinction of any one of its members. Peace and friendship with all\r\nmankind is our wisest policy: and I wish we may be permitted to pursue\r\nit. But the temper and folly of our enemies may not leave this in our\r\nchoice. I am happy in our prospect of friendship with the most estimable\r\npowers of Europe, and particularly with those of the confederacy, of\r\nwhich yours is. That your present crisis may have a happy issue, is the\r\nprayer and wish of him, who has the honor to be, with great respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.--TO WILLIAM DRAYTON, May 6, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DRAYTON.\r\n\r\nParis, May 6, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of November the 23rd came duly to hand. A call to England,\r\nsoon after its receipt, has prevented my acknowledging it so soon as I\r\nshould have done. I am very sensible of the honor done me by the South\r\nCarolina society for promoting and improving agriculture and other rural\r\nconcerns, when they were pleased to elect me to be of their body: and\r\nI beg leave, through you, Sir, to convey to them my grateful thanks\r\nfor this favor. They will find in me, indeed, but a very unprofitable\r\nservant. At present, particularly, my situation is unfavorable to the\r\ndesire I feel, of promoting their views. However, I shall certainly\r\navail myself of every occasion, which shall occur of doing so. Perhaps\r\nI may render some service, by forwarding to the society such new objects\r\nof culture, as may be likely to succeed in the soil and climate of\r\nSouth Carolina. In an infant country, as ours is, these experiments are\r\nimportant. We are probably far from possessing, as yet, all the articles\r\nof culture for which nature has fitted our country. To find out\r\nthese, will require abundance of unsuccessful experiments. But if in\r\na multitude of these, we make one useful acquisition, it repays our\r\ntrouble. Perhaps it is the peculiar duty of associated bodies, to\r\nundertake these experiments. Under this sense of the views of the\r\nsociety, and with so little opportunity of being otherwise useful to\r\nthem, I shall be attentive to procure for them the seeds of such plants,\r\nas they will be so good as to point out to me, or as shall occur to\r\nmyself as worthy their notice. I send at present, by Mr. McQueen, some\r\nseeds of a grass, found very useful in the southern parts of Europe, and\r\nparticularly, and almost solely, cultivated in Malta. It is called\r\nby the names of Sulla, and Spanish St. Foin, and is the _Hedysarum\r\ncoronarium_ of Linnaeus. It is usually sown early in autumn. I shall\r\nreceive a supply of fresher seed this fall, which I will also do myself\r\nthe honor of forwarding to you. I expect, in the same season, from the\r\nsouth of France, some acorns of the cork oak, which I propose for your\r\nsociety, as I am persuaded they will succeed with you. I observed it\r\nto grow in England, without shelter; not well indeed; but so as to give\r\nhopes that it would do well with you. I shall consider myself as always\r\nhonored by the commands of the society, whenever they shall find it\r\nconvenient to make use of me, and beg you to be assured, personally, of\r\nthe sentiments of respect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.--TO W. T. FRANKLIN, May 7, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. T. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nParis, May 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn my return from a two months’ visit to England, I found here your favor\r\nof January the 18th. This contains the latest intelligence I have from\r\nAmerica. Your effects not being then arrived, gives me anxiety for them,\r\nas I think they went in a vessel, which sailed from Havre the 11th of\r\nNovember. In this vessel, went also the two Mr. Fitzhughs of Virginia,\r\nwith the Prussian treaty, our papers relative to the Barbary States,\r\nwith the despatches for Congress, and letters which I had been writing\r\nto other persons in America for six weeks preceding their departure. I\r\nam obliged to you for the information as to Dr. Franklin’s health, in\r\nwhich I feel a great interest. I concur in opinion with you, that in the\r\npresent factious division of your State, an angel from heaven could do\r\nno good. I have been sorry, therefore, from the beginning, to see such\r\ntime as Dr. Franklin’s wasted on so hopeless a business. You have formed\r\na just opinion of Monroe. He is a man whose soul might be turned wrong\r\nside outwards, without discovering a blemish to the world. I wish with\r\nall my heart, Congress may call you into the diplomatic line, as that\r\nseems to have attracted your own desires. It is not one in which you\r\ncan do any thing more, than pass the present hour agreeably, without any\r\nprospect to future provision. Perhaps the arrangements with Portugal,\r\nby adding to the number of those appointments, may give Congress\r\nan opportunity of doing justice to your own, and to Dr. Franklin’s\r\nservices. If my wishes could aid you, you have them sincerely. My late\r\nreturn to this place scarcely enables me to give you any of its news.\r\nI have not yet called on M. La Veillard, or seen any of your\r\nacquaintances. The marriage of the ambassador of Sweden with Miss\r\nNecker, you have heard of. Houdon is about taking a wife also. His bust\r\nof the General has arrived, and meets the approbation of those who know\r\nthe original. Europe enjoys a perfect calm, at present. Perhaps it may\r\nbe disturbed by the death of the King of Prussia, which is constantly\r\nexpected. As yet, we have no information from the Barbary States, which\r\nmay enable us to prognosticate the success of our endeavors to effect a\r\npeace in that quarter. Present me respectfully and affectionately to\r\nDr. Franklin, and accept assurances of the esteem, with which I am, Dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, May 7, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nParis, May 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 11th of October. Soon after that, your favor\r\nof the 12th of September came to hand. My acknowledgment of this is made\r\nlater than it should have been, by my trip to England. Your long silence\r\nI ascribe to a more pleasing cause, that of devoting your spare time to\r\none more capable of filling it with happiness, and to whom, as well as\r\nto yourself, I wish all those precious blessings which this change of\r\ncondition is calculated to give you.\r\n\r\nMy public letters to Mr. Jay will have apprized you of my journey to\r\nEngland, and of its motives; and the joint letters of Mr. Adams\r\nand myself, of its effects. With respect to Portugal, it produced\r\narrangements; with respect to England and Barbary, only information.\r\nI am quite at a loss what you will do with England. To leave her in\r\npossession of our posts, seems inadmissible; and yet to take them,\r\nbrings on a state of things, for which we seem not to be in readiness.\r\nPerhaps a total suppression of her trade, or an exclusion of her vessels\r\nfrom the carriage of our produce, may have some effect; but I believe\r\nnot very great. Their passions are too deeply and too universally\r\nengaged in opposition to us. The ministry have found means to persuade\r\nthe nation, that they are richer than they were while we participated of\r\ntheir commercial privileges. We should try to turn our trade into other\r\nchannels. I am in hopes this country will endeavor to give it more\r\nencouragement. But what will you do with the piratical States? Buy a\r\npeace at their enormous price; force one; or abandon the carriage into\r\nthe Mediterranean to other powers? All these measures are disagreeable.\r\nThe decision rests with you. The Emperor is now pressing a treaty with\r\nus. In a commercial view, I doubt whether it is desirable: but in a\r\npolitical one, I believe it is. He is now undoubtedly the second power\r\nin Europe, and on the death of the King of Prussia, he becomes the first\r\ncharacter. An alliance with him will give us respectability in Europe,\r\nwhich we have occasion for. Besides, he will be at the head of the\r\nsecond grand confederacy of Europe, and may at any time serve us with\r\nthe powers constituting that. I am pressed on so many hands to recommend\r\nDumas to the patronage of Congress, that I cannot avoid it. Every body\r\nspeaks well of him, and his zeal in our cause. Any thing done for him\r\nwill gratify this court, and the patriotic party in Holland, as well as\r\nsome distinguished individuals. I am induced, from my own feelings, to\r\nrecommend Colonel Humphreys to your care. He is sensible, prudent, and\r\nhonest, and may be very firmly relied on, in any office which requires\r\nthese talents. I pray you to accept assurance of the sincere esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I am,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.--TO JAMES ROSS, May 8, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES ROSS.\r\n\r\nParis, May 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor of October the 22nd, and am much\r\ngratified by the communications therein made. It has given me details,\r\nwhich do not enter into the views of my ordinary correspondents, and\r\nwhich are very entertaining. I experience great satisfaction at seeing\r\nmy country proceed to facilitate the intercommunications of its several\r\nparts, by opening rivers, canals, and roads. How much more rational is\r\nthis disposal of public money, than that of waging war.\r\n\r\nBefore the receipt of your letter, Morris’s contract for sixty thousand\r\nhogsheads of tobacco was concluded with the Farmers General. I have been\r\nfor some time occupied in endeavoring to destroy the root of the evils,\r\nwhich the tobacco trade encounters in this country, by making the\r\nministers sensible, that merchants will not bring a commodity to a\r\nmarket, where but one person is allowed to buy it; and that so long as\r\nthat single purchaser is obliged to go to foreign markets for it, he\r\nmust pay for it in coin, and not in commodities. These truths have made\r\ntheir way to the minds of the ministry, insomuch, as to have delayed\r\nthe execution of the new lease of the Farms, six months. It is\r\nrenewed, however, for three years, but so as not to render impossible a\r\nreformation of this great evil. They are sensible of the evil, but it is\r\nso interwoven with their fiscal system, that they find it hazardous to\r\ndisentangle. The temporary distress, too, of the revenue, they are\r\nnot prepared to meet. My hopes, therefore, are weak, though not quite\r\ndesperate. When they become so, it will remain to look about for the\r\nbest palliative this monopoly can bear. My present idea is, that it will\r\nbe found in a prohibition to the Farmers General, to purchase tobacco\r\nany where but in France. You will perceive by this, that my object is to\r\nstrengthen the connection between this country and my own in all\r\nuseful points. I am of opinion, that twenty-three thousand hogsheads\r\nof tobacco, the annual consumption of this country, do not exceed the\r\namount of those commodities, which it is more advantageous to us to buy\r\nhere than in England, or elsewhere; and such a commerce would powerfully\r\nreinforce the motives for a friendship from this country towards ours.\r\nThis friendship we ought to cultivate closely, considering the present\r\ndispositions of England towards us.\r\n\r\nI am lately returned from a visit to that country. The spirit of\r\nhostility to us has always existed in the mind of the King, but it\r\nhas now extended itself through the whole mass of the people, and the\r\nmajority in the public councils. In a country, where the voice of the\r\npeople influences so much the measures of administration, and where it\r\ncoincides with the private temper of the King, there is no pronouncing\r\non future events. It is true, they have nothing to gain, and much to\r\nlose, by a war with us. But interest is not the strongest passion in the\r\nhuman breast. There are difficult points, too, still unsettled between\r\nus. They have not withdrawn their armies out of our country, nor given\r\nsatisfaction for the property they brought off. On our part, we have not\r\npaid our debts, and it will take time to pay them. In conferences with\r\nsome distinguished mercantile characters, I found them sensible of the\r\nimpossibility of our paying these debts at once, and that an endeavor\r\nto force universal and immediate payment, would render debts desperate,\r\nwhich are good in themselves. I think we should not have differed in the\r\nterm necessary. We differed essentially in the article of interest. For\r\nwhile the principal, and interest preceding and subsequent to the war,\r\nseem justly due from us, that which accrued during the war does not.\r\nInterest is a compensation for the use of money. Their money, in our\r\nhands, was in the form of lands and negroes. Tobacco, the produce of\r\nthese lands and negroes (or, as I may call it, the interest for them),\r\nbeing almost impossible of conveyance to the markets of consumption,\r\nbecause taken by themselves in its way there, sold during the war at\r\nfive or six shillings the hundred. This did not pay taxes, and for\r\ntools, and other plantation charges. A man who should have attempted to\r\nremit to his creditor tobacco, for either principal or interest, must\r\nhave remitted it three times before one cargo would have arrived safe:\r\nand this from the depredations of their own nation, and often of the\r\ncreditor himself; for some of the merchants entered deeply into the\r\nprivateering business. The individuals who did not, say they have lost\r\nthis interest: the debtor replies, that he has not gained it, and that\r\nit is a case where, a loss having been incurred, every one tries to\r\nshift it from himself. The known bias of the human mind from motives of\r\ninterest should lessen the confidence of each party in the justice of\r\ntheir reasoning: but it is difficult to say, which of them should\r\nmake the sacrifice, both of reason and interest. Our conferences were\r\nintended as preparatory to some arrangement. It is uncertain how far\r\nwe should have been able to accommodate our opinions. But the absolute\r\naversion of the government to enter into any arrangement prevented the\r\nobject from being pursued. Each country is left to do justice to itself\r\nand to the other, according to its own ideas as to what is past; and to\r\nscramble for the future as well as they can: to regulate their commerce\r\nby duties and prohibitions, and perhaps by cannons and mortars; in which\r\nevent, we must abandon the ocean, where we are weak, leaving to neutral\r\nnations the carriage of our commodities; and measure with them on land,\r\nwhere they alone can lose. Farewell, then, all our useful improvements\r\nof canals and roads, reformations of laws, and other rational\r\nemployments. I really doubt, whether there is temper enough, on either\r\nside, to prevent this issue of our present hatred. Europe is, at this\r\nmoment, without the appearance of a cloud. The death of the King of\r\nPrussia, daily expected, may raise one. My paper admonishes me, that,\r\nafter asking a continuance of your favors, it is time for me to conclude\r\nwith assurances of the esteem with which I am,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.--TO T. PLEASANTS, May 8,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. PLEASANTS.\r\n\r\nParis, May 8,1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAt the time of the receipt of your favor of October the 24th, the\r\ncontract between the Farmers General and Mr. Morris, for tobacco, was\r\nconcluded, and in a course of execution. There was no room, therefore,\r\nto offer the proposals which accompanied your letter. I was, moreover,\r\nengaged in endeavors to have the monopoly, in the purchase of this\r\narticle, in this country, suppressed. My hopes on that subject are not\r\ndesperate, but neither are they flattering. I consider it as the most\r\neffectual means of procuring the full value of our produce, of diverting\r\nour demands for manufactures from Great Britain to this country, to a\r\ncertain amount, and of thus producing some equilibrium in our commerce,\r\nwhich at present lies all in the British scale. It would cement an union\r\nwith our friends, and lessen the torrent of wealth which we are pouring\r\ninto the laps of our enemies. For my part, I think that the trade with\r\nGreat Britain is a ruinous one to ourselves; and that nothing would\r\nbe an inducement to tolerate it, but a free commerce with their West\r\nIndies: and that this being denied to us, we should put a stop to\r\nthe losing branch. The question is, whether they are right in their\r\nprognostications, that we have neither resolution nor union enough for\r\nthis. Every thing I hear from my own country, fills me with despair as\r\nto their recovery from their vassalage to Great Britain. Fashion\r\nand folly are plunging them deeper and deeper into distress: and the\r\nlegislators of the country becoming debtors also, there seems no hope\r\nof applying the only possible remedy, that of an immediate judgment and\r\nexecution. We should try, whether the prodigal might not be restrained\r\nfrom taking on credit the gewgaw held out to him in one hand, by seeing\r\nthe keys of a prison in the other. Be pleased to present my respects to\r\nMrs. Pleasants, and to be assured of the esteem with which I am,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, May 10,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, May 10,1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of January the 27th. Since that, I have received\r\nyours of January the 19th. Information from other quarters gives me\r\nreason to suspect you have in negotiation a very important change in\r\nyour situation. You will carry into its execution all my wishes for your\r\nhappiness. I hope it will not detach you from a settlement in your\r\nown country. I had even entertained hopes of your settling in my\r\nneighborhood: but these were determined by your desiring a plan of a\r\nhouse for Richmond. However reluctantly I relinquish this prospect, I\r\nshall not the less readily obey your commands, by sending you a plan.\r\nHaving been much engaged since my return from England, in answering the\r\nletters and despatching other business which had accumulated during my\r\nabsence, and being still much engaged, perhaps I may not be able to send\r\nthe plan by this conveyance. If I do not send it now, I will surely by\r\nthe next conveyance after this. Your _Encyclopédie_, containing eighteen\r\n_livraisons_, went off last night for Havre, from whence it will go in\r\na vessel bound to New York. It will be under the care of M. la Croix,\r\na passenger, who, if he does not find you in New York, will carry it to\r\nVirginia, and send it to Richmond. Another copy, in a separate box,\r\ngoes for Currie. I pay here all charges to New York. What may occur\r\nafterwards, I desire him to ask either of you or Currie, as either will\r\npay for the other; or to draw on me for them.\r\n\r\nMy letters to Mr. Jay will have informed you of the objects which\r\ncarried me to England: and that the principal one, the treaty with\r\nPortugal, has been accomplished. Though we were unable to procure any\r\nspecial advantages in that, yet we thought it of consequence to insure\r\nour trade against those particular checks and discouragements, which it\r\nhas heretofore met with there. The information as to the Barbary States,\r\nwhich we obtained from Abdrahaman the Tripoline ambassador, was also\r\ngiven to Mr. Jay. If it be right, and the scale of proportion between\r\nthose nations, which we had settled, be also right, eight times the sum\r\nrequired by Tripoli will be necessary to accomplish a peace with the\r\nwhole; that is to say, about two hundred and forty thousand guineas.\r\nThe continuance of this peace will depend on their idea of our power to\r\nenforce it, and on the life of the particular Dey, or other head of the\r\ngovernment, with whom it is contracted. Congress will, no doubt,\r\nweigh these circumstances against the expense and probable success of\r\ncompelling a peace by arms. Count d’Estaing having communicated to me\r\nverbally some information as to an experiment formerly made by this\r\ncountry, I shall get him to put it into writing, and I will forward it\r\nto Congress, as it may aid them in their choice of measures. However,\r\nwhich plan is most eligible can only be known to yourselves, who are on\r\nthe spot, and have under your view all the difficulties of both. There\r\nis a third measure, that of abandoning the Mediterranean carriage to\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to England, no arrangements can be taken. The merchants\r\nwere certainly disposed to have consented to accommodation, as to the\r\narticle of debts. I was not certain, when I left England, that they\r\nwould relinquish the interest during the war. A letter received since,\r\nfrom the first character among the American merchants in Scotland,\r\nsatisfies me they would have relinquished it, to insure the capital and\r\nresidue of interest. Would to heaven, all the States, therefore, would\r\nsettle a uniform plan. To open the courts to them, so that they might\r\nobtain judgments; to divide the executions into so many equal annual\r\ninstalments, as that the last might be paid in the year 1790; to have\r\nthe payments in actual money; and to include the capital, and interest\r\npreceding and subsequent to the war, would give satisfaction to the\r\nworld, and to the merchants in general. Since it is left for each nation\r\nto pursue their own measures, in the execution of the late treaty, may\r\nnot Congress, with propriety, recommend a mode of executing that article\r\nrespecting the debts, and send it to each State to be passed into law?\r\nWhether England gives up the posts or not, these debts must be paid,\r\nor our character stained with infamy among all nations, and through all\r\ntime. As to the satisfaction for slaves carried off, it is a bagatelle,\r\nwhich, if not made good before the last instalment becomes due, may be\r\nsecured out of that.\r\n\r\nI formerly communicated the overtures for a treaty, which had been made\r\nby the imperial ambassador. The instructions from Congress being\r\nin their favor, and Mr. Adams’s opinion also, I encouraged them. He\r\nexpected his full powers when I went to England. Yet I did not think,\r\nnor did Mr. Adams, that this was of importance enough to weigh against\r\nthe objects of that journey. He received them soon after my departure,\r\nand communicated it to me on my return, asking a copy of our\r\npropositions. I gave him one, but observed, our commission had then but\r\na few days to run. He desired I should propose to Congress the giving\r\nnew powers to go on with this, and said, that, in the mean time, he\r\nwould arrange with us the plan. In a commercial view, no great good is\r\nto be gained by this. But in a political one, it may be expedient. As\r\nthe treaty would, of course, be in the terms of those of Prussia and\r\nPortugal, it will give us but little additional embarrassment, in any\r\ncommercial regulations we may wish to establish. The exceptions from\r\nthese, which the other treaties will require, may take in the treaty\r\nwith the Emperor. I should be glad to communicate some answer, as soon\r\nas Congress shall have made up their minds on it. My information to\r\nCongress, on the subject of our commercial articles with this country,\r\nhas only come down to January the 27th. Whether I shall say any thing on\r\nit, in my letter to Mr. Jay by this conveyance, depends on its not\r\nbeing too early for an appointment I expect hourly from the Count de\r\nVergennes, to meet him on this and other subjects. My last information\r\nwas, that the lease was too far advanced to withdraw from it the article\r\nof tobacco, but that a clause is inserted in it, empowering the King\r\nto discontinue it at any time. A discontinuance is, therefore, the\r\nonly remaining object, and as even this cannot be effected till the\r\nexpiration of the old lease, which is about the end of the present year,\r\nI have wished only to stir the subject, from time to time, so as to keep\r\nit alive. This idea led me into a measure proposed by the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, whose return from Berlin found the matter at that point, to\r\nwhich my former report to Congress had conducted it. I communicated to\r\nhim what I had been engaged on, what were my prospects, and my purpose\r\nof keeping the subject just open. He offered his services with that zeal\r\nwhich commands them on every occasion respecting America. He suggested\r\nto me the meeting two or three gentlemen, well acquainted with this\r\nbusiness. We met. They urged me to propose to the Count de Vergennes,\r\nthe appointing a committee to take the matter into consideration. I\r\ntold them, that decency would not permit me to point out to the Count de\r\nVergennes the mode by which he should conduct a negotiation, but that\r\nI would press again the necessity of an arrangement, if, whilst that\r\nshould be operating on his mind, they would suggest the appointment of\r\na committee. The Marquis offered his services for this purpose. The\r\nconsequence was the appointment of a committee, and the Marquis as a\r\nmember of it. I communicated to him my papers. He collected other lights\r\nwherever he could, and particularly from the gentlemen with whom we had\r\nbefore concerted, and who had a good acquaintance with the subject. The\r\nMarquis became our champion in the committee, and two of its members,\r\nwho were of the corps of Farmers General, entered the lists on the other\r\nside. Each gave in memorials. The lease, indeed, was signed while I was\r\ngone to England, but the discussions were, and still are continued in\r\nthe committee: from which we derive two advantages; 1. that of showing,\r\nthat the object is not to be relinquished; and 2. that of enlightening\r\ngovernment, as to its true interest. The Count de Vergennes is\r\nabsolutely for it; but it is not in his department. Calonne is his\r\nfriend, and in this instance his principle seems to be, _Amica\r\nveritas, sed magis amicus Plato_. An additional hope is founded in the\r\nexpectation of a change of the minister of finance. The present one is\r\nunder the absolute control of the Farmers General. The committee’s views\r\nhave been somewhat different from mine. They despair of a suppression of\r\nthe Farm, and therefore wish to obtain palliatives, which would coincide\r\nwith the particular good of this country. I think, that so long as the\r\nmonopoly in the sale is kept up, it is of no consequence to us, how they\r\nmodify the pill for their own internal relief: but, on the contrary, the\r\nworse it remains, the more necessary it will render a reformation. Any\r\npalliative would take from us all those arguments and friends, that\r\nwould be satisfied with accommodation. The Marquis, though differing in\r\nopinion from me on this point, has, however, adhered to my principle\r\nof absolute liberty or nothing. In this condition is the matter at this\r\nmoment. Whether I say any thing on the subject to Mr. Jay, will depend\r\non my interview with the Count de Vergennes. I doubt whether that will\r\nfurnish any thing worth communicating, and whether it will be in time.\r\nI therefore state thus much to you, that you may see the matter is not\r\nlaid aside.\r\n\r\nI must beg leave to recommend Colonel Humphreys to your acquaintance and\r\ngood offices. He is an excellent man, an able one, and in need of some\r\nprovision. Besides former applications to me in favor of Dumas, the\r\nRhingrave of Salm (the effective minister of the government of Holland,\r\nwhile their two ambassadors here are ostensible), who is conducting\r\nsecret arrangements for them with this court, presses his interests on\r\nus. It is evident the two governments make a point of it. You ask, why\r\nthey do not provide for him themselves. I am not able to answer the\r\nquestion, but by a conjecture, that Dumas’s particular ambition prefers\r\nan appointment from us. I know all the difficulty of this application,\r\nwhich Congress has to encounter. I see the reasons against giving\r\nhim the primary appointment at that court, and the difficulty of his\r\naccommodating himself to a subordinate one. Yet I think something must\r\nbe done in it, to gratify this court, of which we must be always asking\r\nfavors. In these countries, personal favors weigh more than public\r\ninterest. The minister who has asked a gratification for Dumas, has\r\nembarked his own feelings and reputation in that demand. I do not\r\nthink it was discreet, by any means. But this reflection might perhaps\r\naggravate a disappointment. I know not really what you can do: but yet\r\nhope something will be done. Adieu, my Dear Sir, and believe me to be\r\n\r\nyours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.--TO JOHN ADAMS, May 11, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, May 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI do myself the honor of enclosing to you, letters which came to hand\r\nlast night, from Mr. Lambe, Mr. Carmichael, and Mr. Barclay. By these\r\nyou will perceive, that our peace is not to be purchased at Algiers but\r\nat a price far beyond our powers. What that would be, indeed, Mr. Lambe\r\ndoes not say, nor probably does he know. But as he knew our ultimatum,\r\nwe are to suppose from his letter, that it would be a price infinitely\r\nbeyond that. A reference to Congress hereon seems to be necessary. Till\r\nthat can be obtained, Mr. Lambe must be idle at Algiers, Carthagena, or\r\nelsewhere. Would he not be better employed in going to Congress?\r\nThey would be able to draw from him and Mr. Randall, the information\r\nnecessary to determine what they will do. And if they determine to\r\nnegotiate, they can re-appoint the same, or appoint a new negotiator,\r\naccording to the opinion they shall form on their examination. I suggest\r\nthis to you as my first thoughts; an ultimate opinion should not be\r\nformed till we see Mr. Randall, who may be shortly expected. In the mean\r\ntime, should an opportunity occur, favor me with your ideas hereon that\r\nwe may be maturing our opinions. I shall send copies of these three\r\nletters to Mr. Jay, by the packet which sails from L’Orient the first of\r\nthe next month.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.--TO LISTER ASQUITH, May 22, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LISTER ASQUITH.\r\n\r\nParis, May 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWhen I left this place for England, I had no suspicion that any thing\r\nmore would be necessary on my part for your liberation. Being but lately\r\nreturned, I could not sooner acknowledge the receipt of your letters of\r\nApril the 21st and May the 1st. I this day write to M. Desbordes, to pay\r\nthe charges necessary for your enlargement, to furnish you with a guinea\r\napiece, and to take your draft on Mr. Grand for those sums, and the\r\nothers which he has furnished you at my request. This being a new\r\ncase, I am unable to say whether you will be held to repay this money.\r\nCongress will decide on that, to whom I shall send a report of the case,\r\nand to whom you should apply on your return to America, to know whether\r\nyou are to repay it or not. During the whole of this long transaction,\r\nI have never ceased soliciting your discharge. The evidence furnished by\r\nthe Farmers to the ministers, impressed them with a belief that you were\r\nguilty. However, they obtained a remission of all which the King could\r\nremit, which was your condemnation to the galleys, and imprisonment,\r\nand the sum in which you were fined. The confiscation belonged to the\r\nFarmers, and the expenses of subsistence and of prosecution were theirs\r\nalso, and so could not be remitted by the King. I wish you to be assured\r\nof my sensibility for your sufferings, and of my wishes to have obtained\r\nan earlier relief, had it been possible. I shall be glad if you can have\r\nan immediate and safe return to your own country, and there find your\r\nfamilies well, and make those who may be authorized to decide on your\r\ncase sensible, that these misfortunes have not been brought on you by\r\nany desire of yours, to infringe the laws of the country in which you\r\nhave suffered. I enclose herewith your log-book and the other papers\r\ndesired by you, and am, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.--TO JOHN JAY, May 23, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, May 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nLetters received both from Madrid and Algiers, while I was in London,\r\nhaving suggested that treaties with the States of Barbary would be much\r\nfacilitated by a previous one with the Ottoman Porte, it was agreed\r\nbetween Mr. Adams and myself, that on my return, I should consult\r\non this subject the Count de Vergennes, whose long residence at\r\nConstantinople rendered him the best judge of its expediency. Various\r\ncircumstances have put it out of my power to consult him, till to-day.\r\nI stated to him the difficulties we were likely to meet with at\r\nAlgiers; and asked his opinion, what would be the probable expense of a\r\ndiplomatic mission to Constantinople, and what its effect at Algiers.\r\nHe said that the expense would be very great, for that presents must be\r\nmade at that court, and every one would be gaping after them: and that\r\nit would not procure us a peace at Algiers one penny the cheaper. He\r\nobserved, that the Barbary States acknowledged a sort of vassalage to\r\nthe Porte, and availed themselves of that relation, when any thing was\r\nto be gained by it; but that whenever it subjected them to a demand from\r\nthe Porte, they totally disregarded it: that money was the sole agent\r\nat Algiers, except so far as fear could be induced also. He cited the\r\npresent example of Spain, which, though having a treaty with the Porte\r\nwould probably be obliged to buy a peace at Algiers, at the expense of\r\nupwards of six millions of livres. I told him, we had calculated from\r\nthe demands and information of the Tripoline ambassador, at London, that\r\nto make peace with the four Barbary States would cost us between two and\r\nthree hundred thousand guineas, if bought with money. The sum did not\r\nseem to exceed his expectations. I mentioned to him, that considering\r\nthe uncertainty of a peace, when bought, perhaps Congress might think\r\nit more eligible to establish a cruise of frigates in the Mediterranean,\r\nand even to blockade Algiers. He supposed it would require ten vessels,\r\ngreat and small. I observed to him that Monsieur de Massiac had formerly\r\ndone it with five: he said it was true, but that vessels of relief would\r\nbe necessary. I hinted to him that I thought the English capable of\r\nadministering aid to the Algerines. He seemed to think it impossible,\r\non account of the scandal it would bring on. I asked him what had\r\noccasioned the blockade by Monsieur de Massiac: he said, an infraction\r\nof their treaty by the Algerines.\r\n\r\nI had a good deal of conversation with him, also, on the situation of\r\naffairs between England and the United States: and particularly, on\r\ntheir refusal to deliver up our posts. I observed to him, that the\r\nobstructions thrown in the way of the recovery of their debts, were\r\nthe effect, and not the cause, as they pretended, of their refusal to\r\ndeliver up the posts; that the merchants interested in these debts,\r\nshowed a great disposition to make arrangements with us; that the\r\narticle of time we could certainly have settled, and probably that\r\nof the interest during the war: but that, the minister showing no\r\ndisposition to have these matters arranged, I thought it a sufficient\r\nproof that this was not the true cause of their retaining the posts. He\r\nconcurred as to the justice of our requiring time for the payment of\r\nour debts; said nothing which showed a difference of opinion as to the\r\narticle of interest, and seemed to believe fully, that their object was\r\nto divert the channel of the fur-trade, before they delivered up the\r\nposts, and expressed a strong sense of the importance of that commerce\r\nto us. I told him I really could not foresee what would be the event of\r\nthis detention; that the situation of the British funds, and the desire\r\nof their minister to begin to reduce the national debt, seemed to\r\nindicate that they could not wish a war. He thought so, but that neither\r\nwere we in a condition to go to war. I told him, I was yet uninformed\r\nwhat Congress proposed to do on this subject, but that we should\r\ncertainly always count on the good offices of France, and I was sure\r\nthat the offer of them would suffice to induce Great Britain to do us\r\njustice. He said that surely we might always count on the friendship\r\nof France. I added, that by the treaty of alliance, she was bound to\r\nguaranty our limits to us, as they should be established at the moment\r\nof peace. He said they were so, ‘_mais qu’il nous etoit nécessaire de\r\nles constater_.’ I told him there was no question what our boundaries\r\nwere; that the English themselves admitted they were clear beyond\r\nall question. I feared, however, to press this any further, lest a\r\nreciprocal question should be put to me, and therefore diverted the\r\nconversation to another object. This is a sketch only of a conference\r\nwhich was long. I have endeavored to give the substance, and sometimes\r\nthe expressions, where they were material. I supposed it would be\r\nagreeable to Congress to have it communicated to them, in the present\r\nundecided state in which these subjects are. I should add, that\r\nan explanation of the transaction of Monsieur de Massiac with the\r\nAlgerines, before hinted at, will be found in the enclosed letter from\r\nthe Count d’Estaing to me, wherein he gives also his own opinion. The\r\nwhole is submitted to Congress, as I conceive it my duty to furnish them\r\nwith whatever information I can gather, which may throw any light on the\r\nsubjects depending before them. I have the honor to be, with the most\r\nperfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.--TO MR. CARMICHAEL, June 20, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, June 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 5th of May, by Baron Waltersdorff. Since that\r\nI have been honored with yours of April the 13th, and May the 16th and\r\n18th. The present covers letters to Mr. Lambe and Mr. Randall, informing\r\nthem that the demands of Algiers for the ransom of our prisoners and\r\nalso for peace, are so infinitely beyond our instructions, that we must\r\nrefer the matter back to Congress, and therefore praying them to come on\r\nimmediately. I will beg the favor of you to forward these letters. The\r\nwhole of this business, therefore, is suspended till we receive further\r\norders, except as to Mr. Barclay’s mission. Your bills have been\r\nreceived and honored. The first naming expressly a letter of advice, and\r\nnone coming, it was refused till the receipt of your letter to me, in\r\nwhich you mentioned that you had drawn two bills. I immediately informed\r\nMr. Grand, who thereupon honored the bill.\r\n\r\nI have received no public letters of late date. Through other channels,\r\nI have collected some articles of information, which may be acceptable\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIn a letter of March the 20th, from Dr. Franklin to me, is this passage.\r\n‘As to public affairs, the Congress has not been able to assemble more\r\nthan seven or eight States during the whole winter, so the treaty with\r\nPrussia remains still unratified, though there is no doubt of its being\r\ndone soon, as a full Congress is expected next month. The disposition to\r\nfurnish Congress with ample powers augments daily, as people become more\r\nenlightened. And I do not remember ever to have seen, during my long\r\nlife, more signs of public felicity than appear at present, throughout\r\nthese States; the cultivators of the earth, who make the bulk of our\r\nnation, have made good crops, which are paid for at high prices, with\r\nready money; the artisans, too, receive high wages; and the value of all\r\nreal estates is augmented greatly. Merchants and shopkeepers, indeed,\r\ncomplain that there is not business enough. But this is evidently not\r\nowing to the fewness of buyers, but to the too great number of sellers;\r\nfor the consumption of goods was never greater, as appears by the dress,\r\nfurniture, and manner of living, of all ranks of the people.’ His health\r\nis good, except as to the stone, which does not grow worse. I thank\r\nyou for your attention to my request about the books, which Mr. Barclay\r\nwrites me he has forwarded from Cadiz.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be with great respect, Dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.--TO MR. LAMBE, June 20,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LAMBE.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, June 20,1786.\r\n\r\nHaving communicated to Mr. Adams the information received, at different\r\ntimes, from yourself, from Mr. Randall, and Mr. Carmichael, we find\r\nthat the sum likely to be demanded by Algiers for the ransom of our\r\nprisoners, as well as for peace, is so infinitely beyond our powers, and\r\nthe expectations of Congress, that it has become our duty to refer the\r\nwhole matter back to them. Whether they will choose to buy a peace, to\r\nforce one, or to do nothing, will rest in their pleasure. But that\r\nthey may have all the information possible to guide them in their\r\ndeliberations, we think it important that you should return to them.\r\nNo time will be lost by this, and perhaps time maybe gained. It is,\r\ntherefore, our joint desire, that you repair immediately to New York,\r\nfor the purpose of giving to Congress all the information on this\r\nsubject, which your journey has enabled you to acquire. You will\r\nconsider this request as coming from Mr. Adams as well as myself, as\r\nit is by express authority from him, that I join him in it. I am of\r\nopinion, it will be better for you to come to Marseilles and by Paris:\r\nbecause there is a possibility that fresh orders to us, from Congress,\r\nmight render it useful that we, also, should have received from you all\r\npossible information on this subject. And perhaps no time may be lost by\r\nthis, as it might be long before you would set a passage from Alicant to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.--TO MONSIEUR DE REYNEVAL, June 25, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\nParis, June 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received letters from two citizens of the United States, of the\r\nnames of Geary and Arnold, informing me, that having for some time past\r\nexercised commerce in London, and having failed, they were obliged to\r\nleave that country; that they came over to Dunkirk, and from thence to\r\nBrest, where, one of them having changed his name, the more effectually\r\nto elude the search of his creditors, they were both imprisoned by order\r\nof the commandant; whether at the suit of their creditors, or because\r\none of them changed his name, they are uninformed. But they are told,\r\nthat the commandant has sent information of his proceedings to your\r\noffice. I have some reason to suppose, their creditors are endeavoring\r\nto obtain leave to remove them to England, where their imprisonment\r\nwould be perpetual. Unable to procure information elsewhere, I take the\r\nliberty of asking you, whether you know the cause of their imprisonment,\r\nand of soliciting your attention to them, so far as that nothing may\r\ntake place against them by surprise, and out of the ordinary course of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble; servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.--TO THE PREVOT DES MARCHANDS, September 27, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PREVOT DES MARCHANDS ET ECHEVINS DE PARIS.\r\n\r\nParis, September 27, 1786.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nThe commonwealth of Virginia, in gratitude for the services of Major\r\nGeneral the Marquis de la Fayette, have determined to erect his bust in\r\ntheir Capital. Desirous to place a like monument of his worth, and of\r\ntheir sense of it, in the country to which they are indebted for his\r\nbirth, they have hoped that the city of Paris will consent to become the\r\ndepository of this second testimony of their gratitude. Being charged by\r\nthem with the execution of their wishes, I have the honor to solicit of\r\nMessieurs le Prevot des Marchands et Echevins, on behalf of the city,\r\ntheir acceptance of a bust of this gallant officer, and that they will\r\nbe pleased to place it where, doing most honor to him, it will most\r\ngratify the feelings of an allied nation.\r\n\r\nIt is with true pleasure that I obey the call of that commonwealth, to\r\nrender just homage to a character so great in its first developements,\r\nthat they would honor the close of any other. Their country covered by\r\na small army against a great one, their exhausted means supplied by his\r\ntalents, their enemies finally forced to that spot whither their allies\r\nand confederates were collecting to receive them, and a war which had\r\nspread its miseries into the four quarters of the earth thus reduced\r\nto a single point, where one blow should terminate it, and through the\r\nwhole, an implicit respect paid to the laws of the land; these are facts\r\nwhich would illustrate any character, and which fully justify the warmth\r\nof those feelings, of which I have the honor, on this occasion, to be\r\nthe organ.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more pleasing to me to have executed this office in\r\nperson, to have mingled the tribute of private gratitude with that of my\r\ncountry, and, at the same time, to have had an opportunity of presenting\r\nto your honorable body, the homage of that profound respect which I have\r\nthe honor to bear them. But I am withheld from these grateful duties,\r\nby the consequences of a fall, which confine me to my room. Mr. Short,\r\ntherefore, a citizen of the State of Virginia, and heretofore a member\r\nof its Council of State, will have the honor of delivering you this\r\nletter, together with the resolution of the General Assembly of\r\nVirginia. He will have that, also, of presenting the bust at such time\r\nand place, as you will be so good as to signify your pleasure to receive\r\nit. Through him, I beg to be allowed the honor of presenting those\r\nsentiments of profound respect and veneration, with which I am,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.--TO COLONEL MONROE, July 9, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 9, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 10th of May; since which your favor of May the\r\n11th has come to hand. The political world enjoys great quiet here. The\r\nKing of Prussia is still living, but like the snuff of a candle, which\r\nsometimes seems out, and then blazes up again. Some think that his death\r\nwill not produce any immediate effect in Europe. His kingdom like a\r\nmachine, will go on for some time with the winding up he has given it.\r\nThe King’s visit to Cherbourg has made a great sensation in England\r\nand here. It proves to the world, that it is a serious object to this\r\ncountry, and that the King commits himself for the accomplishment of\r\nit. Indeed, so many cones have been sunk, that no doubt remains of the\r\npracticability of it. It will contain, as is said, eighty ships of\r\nthe line, be one of the best harbors in the world, and by means of two\r\nentrances, on different sides, will admit vessels to come in and go out\r\nwith every wind. The effect of this, in another war with England, defies\r\ncalculation. Having no news to communicate, I will recur to the subjects\r\nof your letter of May the 11th.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the new States, were the question to stand simply in\r\nthis form, How may the ultramontane territory be disposed of, so as to\r\nproduce the greatest and most immediate benefit to the inhabitants of\r\nthe maritime States of the Union? the plan would be more plausible, of\r\nlaying it off into two or three States only. Even on this view, however,\r\nthere would still be something to be said against it, which might render\r\nit at least doubtful. But that is a question, which good faith forbids\r\nus to receive into discussion. This requires us to state the question in\r\nits just form, How may the territories of the Union be disposed of, so\r\nas to produce the greatest degree of happiness to their inhabitants?\r\nWith respect to the maritime States, little or nothing remains to\r\nbe done. With respect, then, to the ultramontane States, will their\r\ninhabitants be happiest, divided into States of thirty thousand square\r\nmiles, not quite as large as Pennsylvania, or into States of one hundred\r\nand sixty thousand square miles each, that is to say, three times as\r\nlarge as Virginia within the Allegany? They will not only be happier in\r\nStates of moderate size, but it is the only way in which they can exist\r\nas a regular society. Considering the American character in general,\r\nthat of those people particularly, and the energetic nature of our\r\ngovernments, a State of such extent as one hundred and sixty thousand\r\nsquare miles, would soon crumble into little ones. These are the\r\ncircumstances, which reduce the Indians to such small societies. They\r\nwould produce an effect on our people, similar to this. They would not\r\nbe broken into such small pieces, because they are more habituated to\r\nsubordination, and value more a government of regular law. But you\r\nwould surely reverse the nature of things, in making small States on\r\nthe ocean, and large ones beyond the mountains. If we could, in our\r\nconsciences, say, that great States beyond the mountains will make the\r\npeople happiest, we must still ask, whether they will be contented to be\r\nlaid off into large States. They certainly will not: and if they decide\r\nto divide themselves, we are not able to restrain them. They will end by\r\nseparating from our confederacy, and becoming its enemies. We had better\r\nthen look forward, and see what will be the probable course of things.\r\nThis will surely be a division of that country into States, of a small,\r\nor, at most, of a moderate size. If we lay them off into such, they will\r\nacquiesce; and we shall have the advantage of arranging them, so as to\r\nproduce the best combinations of interest. What Congress have already\r\ndone in this matter, is an argument the more, in favor of the revolt of\r\nthose States against a different arrangement, and of their acquiescence\r\nunder a continuance of that. Upon this plan, we treat them as\r\nfellow-citizens; they will have a just share in their own government;\r\nthey will love us, and pride themselves in an union with us. Upon\r\nthe other, we treat them as subjects; we govern them, and not they\r\nthemselves; they will abhor us as masters, and break off from us in\r\ndefiance. I confess to you, that I can see no other turn that these two\r\nplans would take. But I respect your opinion, and your knowledge of the\r\ncountry, too much, to be over-confident in my own.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your communication, that my not having sooner\r\ngiven notice of the _Arrêts_ relative to fish, gave discontent to some\r\npersons. These are the most friendly offices you can do me, because they\r\nenable me to justify myself, if I am right, or correct myself, if wrong.\r\nIf those who thought I might have been remiss, would have written to me\r\non the subject, I should have admired them for their candor, and thanked\r\nthem for it: for I have no jealousies nor resentments at things of this\r\nkind, where I have no reason to believe they have been excited by a\r\nhostile spirit; and I suspect no such spirit in a single member of\r\nCongress. You know there were two _Arrêts_; the first of August the\r\n30th, 1784, the second of the 18th and 25th of September, 1785. As to\r\nthe first, it would be a sufficient justification of myself, to say,\r\nthat it was in the time of my predecessor, nine months before I came\r\ninto office, and that there was no more reason for my giving information\r\nof it, when I did come into office, than of all the other transactions,\r\nwhich preceded that period. But this would seem to lay a blame on Dr.\r\nFranklin for not communicating it, which I am confident he did not\r\ndeserve. This government affects a secrecy in all its transactions\r\nwhatsoever, though they be of a nature not to admit a perfect secrecy.\r\nTheir _Arrêts_ respecting the islands go to those islands, and are\r\nunpublished and unknown in France, except in the bureau where they are\r\nformed. That of August, 1784, would probably be communicated to the\r\nmerchants of the seaport towns also. But Paris having no commercial\r\nconnections with them, if any thing makes its way from a seaport town\r\nto Paris, it must be by accident. We have, indeed, agents in these\r\nseaports; but they value their offices so little, that they do not\r\ntrouble themselves to inform us of what is passing there. As a proof\r\nthat these things do not transpire here, nor are easily got at,\r\nrecollect that Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, and myself were all here on the\r\nspot together, from August, 1784, to June, 1785, that is to say, ten\r\nmonths, and yet not one of us knew of the _Arrêt_ of August, 1784.\r\nSeptember the 18th and 25th, 1785, the second was passed. And here alone\r\nI became responsible. I think it was about six weeks before I got notice\r\nof it, that is, in November. On the 20th of that month, writing to Count\r\nde Vergennes on another subject, I took occasion to remonstrate to him\r\non that. But from early in November, when the Fitzhughs went to America.\r\nI had never a confidential opportunity of writing to Mr. Jay from hence,\r\ndirectly, for several months. In a letter of December the 14th, to\r\nMr. Jay, I mentioned to him the want of an opportunity to write to him\r\nconfidentially, which obliged me at that moment to write by post via\r\nLondon, and on such things only, as both post-offices were welcome to\r\nsee. On the 2nd of January, Mr. Bingham setting out for London, I wrote\r\nto Mr. Jay, sending him a copy of my letter to Count de Vergennes, and\r\nstating something, which had passed in conversation on the same subject.\r\nI prayed Mr. Bingham to take charge of the letter, and either to send it\r\nby a safe hand, or carry it himself, as circumstances should render most\r\nadvisable. I believe he kept it, to carry himself. He did not sail from\r\nLondon till about the 12th of March, nor arrive in America till the\r\nmiddle of May. Thus you see, that causes had prevented a letter, which\r\nI had written on the 20th of November, from getting to America till the\r\nmonth of May. No wonder, then, if notice of this _Arrêt_ came first to\r\nyou by the way of the West Indies: and, in general, I am confident, that\r\nyou will receive notice of the regulations of this country, respecting\r\ntheir islands, by the way of those islands, before you will from hence.\r\nNor can this be remedied, but by a system of bribery, which would end\r\nin the corruption of your own ministers, and produce no good adequate\r\nto the expense. Be so good as to communicate these circumstances to the\r\npersons who you think may have supposed me guilty of remissness on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nI will turn to a subject more pleasing to both, and give you my sincere\r\ncongratulations on your marriage. Your own dispositions, and the\r\ninherent comforts of that state, will insure you a great addition of\r\nhappiness. Long may you live to enjoy it, and enjoy it in full measure.\r\nThe interest I feel in every one connected with you, will justify my\r\npresenting my earliest respects to the lady, and of tendering her the\r\nhomage of my friendship. I shall be happy at all times to be useful to\r\neither of you, and to receive your commands. I enclose you the bill of\r\nlading of your _Encyclopédie_. With respect to the remittance for it,\r\nof which you make mention, I beg you not to think of it. I know, by\r\nexperience, that on proceeding to make a settlement in life, a man has\r\nneed of all his resources; and I should be unhappy, were you to lessen\r\nthem by an attention to this trifle. Let it lie till you have nothing\r\nelse to do with your money. Adieu, my Dear Sir, and be assured of the\r\nesteem with which I am your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 11, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, July 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOur instructions relative to the Barbary States having required us to\r\nproceed by way of negotiation to obtain their peace, it became our\r\nduty to do this to the best of our power. Whatever might be our private\r\nopinions, they were to be suppressed, and the line marked out to us\r\nwas to be followed. It has been so, honestly and zealously. It was,\r\ntherefore, never material for us to consult together on the best plan\r\nof conduct towards these States. I acknowledge I very, early thought it\r\nwould be best to effect a peace through the medium of war. Though it\r\nis a question with which we have nothing to do, yet as you propose\r\nsome discussion of it, I shall trouble you with my reasons. Of the four\r\npositions laid down in your letter of the 3rd instant, I agree to the\r\nthree first, which are, in substance, that the good offices of our\r\nfriends cannot procure us a peace, without paying its price, that they\r\ncannot materially lessen that price; and that paying it, we can have the\r\npeace in spite of the intrigues of our enemies. As to the fourth, that\r\nthe longer the negotiation is delayed, the larger will be the demand;\r\nthis will depend on the intermediate captures: if they are many and\r\nrich, the price may be raised; if few and poor, it will be lessened.\r\nHowever, if it is decided, that we shall buy a peace, I know no reason\r\nfor delaying the operation, but should rather think it ought to be\r\nhastened: but I should prefer the obtaining it by war.\r\n\r\n1. Justice is in favor of this opinion. 2. Honor favors it. 3. It will\r\nprocure us respect in Europe; and respect is a safeguard to interest. 4.\r\nIt will arm the federal head with the safest of all the instruments of\r\ncoercion over its delinquent members, and prevent it from using what\r\nwould be less safe. I think, that so far you go with me. But in the\r\nnext steps we shall differ. 5. I think it least expensive. 6. Equally\r\neffectual. I ask a fleet of one hundred and fifty guns, the one half\r\nof which shall be in constant cruise. This fleet, built, manned, and\r\nvictualled for six months, will cost four hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds sterling. Its annual expense will be three hundred pounds\r\nsterling a gun, including every thing: this will be forty-five thousand\r\npounds sterling a year. I take British experience for the basis of my\r\ncalculation: though we know, from our own experience, that we can do in\r\nthis way for pounds lawful, what costs them pounds sterling. Were we to\r\ncharge all this to the Algerine war, it would amount to little more than\r\nwe must pay if we buy peace. But as it is proper and necessary, that we\r\nshould establish a small marine force (even were we to buy a peace from\r\nthe Algerines), and as that force, laid up in our dock-yard, would cost\r\nus half as much annually as if kept in order for service, we have a\r\nright to say, that only twenty-two thousand and five hundred pounds\r\nsterling, per annum, should be charged to the Algerine war. 6. It will\r\nbe as effectual. To all the mismanagements of Spain and Portugal, urged\r\nto show that war against those people is ineffectual, I urge a single\r\nfact to prove the contrary, where there is any management. About forty\r\nyears ago, the Algerines having broke their treaty with France, this\r\ncourt sent Monsieur de Massiac, with one large and two small frigates:\r\nhe blockaded the harbor of Algiers three months, and they subscribed\r\nto the terms he proposed. If it be admitted, however, that war, on the\r\nfairest prospects, is still exposed to uncertainties, I weigh against\r\nthis the greater uncertainty of the duration of a peace bought with\r\nmoney, from such a people, from a Dey eighty years old, and by a nation\r\nwho, on the hypothesis of buying peace, is to have no power on the sea\r\nto enforce an observance of it.\r\n\r\nSo far I have gone on the supposition, that the whole weight of this war\r\nwould rest on us. But, 1. Naples will join us. The character of their\r\nnaval minister (Acton), his known sentiments with respect to the peace\r\nSpain is officiously trying to make for them, and his dispositions\r\nagainst the Algerines, give the best grounds to believe it. 2. Every\r\nprinciple of reason assures,us, that Portugal will join us. I state this\r\nas taking for granted, what all seem to believe, that they will not\r\nbe at peace with Algiers. I suppose, then, that a convention might be\r\nformed between Portugal, Naples, and the United States, by which\r\nthe burthen of the war might be quotaed on them, according to their\r\nrespective wealth; and the term of it should be, when Algiers should\r\nsubscribe to a peace with all three on equal terms. This might be left\r\nopen for other nations to accede to, and many, if not most of the powers\r\nof Europe (except France, England, Holland, and Spain, if her peace be\r\nmade), would sooner or later enter into the confederacy, for the sake of\r\nhaving their peace with the piratical States guarantied by the whole.\r\nI suppose, that, in this case, our proportion of force would not be the\r\nhalf of what I first calculated on.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons, which have influenced my judgment on this\r\nquestion. I give them to you, to show you that I am imposed on by a\r\nsemblance of reason at least; and not with an expectation of their\r\nchanging your opinion. You have viewed the subject, I am sure, in\r\nall its bearings. You have weighed both questions, with all their\r\ncircumstances. You make the result different from what I do. The same\r\nfacts impress us differently. This is enough to make me suspect an error\r\nin my process of reasoning, though I am not able to detect it. It is of\r\nno consequence; as I have nothing to say in the decision, and am ready\r\nto proceed heartily on any other plan, which may be adopted, if my\r\nagency should be thought useful. With respect to the dispositions of the\r\nStates, I am utterly uninformed. I cannot help thinking, however, that\r\non a view of all the circumstances, they might be united in either of\r\nthe plans.\r\n\r\nHaving written this on the receipt of your letter, without knowing\r\nof any opportunity of sending it, I know not when it will go: I add\r\nnothing, therefore, on any other subject, but assurances of the sincere\r\nesteem and respect, with which I am,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.--TO JOHN JAY, August 11, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSince the date of my last, which was of July the 8th, I have been\r\nhonored with the receipt of yours of June the 16th. I am to thank you,\r\non the part of the minister of Geneva, for the intelligence it contained\r\non the subject of Gallatin, whose relations will be relieved by the\r\nreceipt of it.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed intelligence, relative to the instructions of the court of\r\nLondon to Sir Guy Carleton, came to me through the Count de la Touche\r\nand Marquis de la Fayette. De la Touche is a director under the Marechal\r\nde Castries, minister for the marine department, and possibly receives\r\nhis intelligence from him, and he from their ambassador at London.\r\nPossibly, too, it might be fabricated here. Yet weighing the characters\r\nof the ministry of St. James’s and Versailles, I think the former more\r\ncapable of giving such instructions, than the latter of fabricating them\r\nfor the small purposes the fabrication could answer.\r\n\r\nThe Gazette of France, of July the 28th, announces the arrival of\r\nPeyrouse at Brazil, that he was to touch at Otaheite, and proceed to\r\nCalifornia, and still further northwardly. This paper, as you well\r\nknow, gives out such facts as the court are willing the world should\r\nbe possessed of. The presumption is, therefore, that they will make an\r\nestablishment of some sort on the northwest coast of America.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with the copy of a letter from Schweighauser and Dobree,\r\non a subject with which I am quite unacquainted. Their letter to\r\nCongress of November the 30th, 1780, gives their state of the matter.\r\nHow far it be true and just, can probably be ascertained from Dr.\r\nFranklin, Dr. Lee, and other gentlemen now in America. I shall be glad\r\nto be honored with the commands of Congress on this subject. I have\r\ninquired into the state of the arms, mentioned in their letter to\r\nme. The principal articles were about thirty thousand bayonets, fifty\r\nthousand gunlocks, thirty cases of arms, twenty-two cases of sabres, and\r\nsome other things of little consequence. The quay at Nantes having been\r\noverflowed by the river Loire, the greatest part of these arms was under\r\nwater, and they are now, as I am informed, a solid mass of rust, not\r\nworth the expense of throwing them out of the warehouse, much less that\r\nof storage. Were not their want of value a sufficient reason against\r\nreclaiming the property of these arms, it rests with Congress to decide,\r\nwhether other reasons are not opposed to this reclamation. They were the\r\nproperty of a sovereign body, they were seized by an individual, taken\r\ncognizance of by a court of justice, and refused, or at least not\r\nrestored by the sovereign, within whose State they had been arrested.\r\nThese are circumstances which have been mentioned to me. Doctor\r\nFranklin, however, will be able to inform Congress, with precision, as\r\nto what passed on this subject. If the information I have received be\r\nany thing like the truth, the discussion of this matter can only be with\r\nthe court of Versailles. It would be very delicate, and could have but\r\none of two objects; either to recover the arms, which are not worth\r\nreceiving, or to satisfy us on the point of honor. Congress will judge\r\nhow far the latter may be worth pursuing against a particular ally, and\r\nunder actual circumstances. An instance, too, of acquiescence on our\r\npart under a wrong, rather than disturb our friendship by altercations,\r\nmay have its value in some future case. However, I shall be ready to do\r\nin this what Congress shall be pleased to direct.\r\n\r\nI enclose the despatches relative to the Barbary negotiation, received\r\nsince my last. It is painful to me to overwhelm Congress and yourself\r\ncontinually with these voluminous papers. But I have no right to\r\nsuppress any part of them, and it is one of those cases, where, from\r\na want of well digested information, we must be contented to examine a\r\ngreat deal of rubbish, in order to find a little good matter.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of Leyden and France, to the present date, accompany this,\r\nwhich, for want of direct and safe opportunities, I am obliged to send\r\nby an American gentleman, by the way of London. The irregularity of the\r\nFrench packets has diverted elsewhere the tide of passengers who used to\r\nfurnish me occasions of writing to you, without permitting my letters\r\nto go through the post-office. So that when the packets go now, I can\r\nseldom write by them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The annexed is a translation of the paper referred to in\r\n     the preceding letter, on the subject of the instructions\r\n     given to Sir Guy Carleton.]\r\n\r\n_An extract of English political news, concerning North America, July\r\n14th, 1786_.\r\n\r\nGeneral Carleton departs in a few days with M. de la Naudiere, a\r\nCanadian gentleman. He has made me acquainted with the Indian Colonel\r\nJoseph Brandt. It is certain that he departs with the most positive\r\ninstructions to distress the Americans as much as possible, and to\r\ncreate them enemies on all sides.\r\n\r\nColonel Brandt goes loaded with presents for himself, and for several\r\nchiefs of the tribes bordering on Canada. It would be well for the\r\nAmericans to know in time, that enemies are raised against them, in\r\norder to derange their system of government, and to add to the confusion\r\nwhich already exists in it. The new possessions of England will not only\r\ngain what America shall lose, but will acquire strength in proportion to\r\nthe weakening of the United States.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, the new States which are forming will place themselves\r\nunder the protection of England, which can always communicate with them\r\nthrough Canada; and which, in case of future necessity, can harass the\r\nUnited States on one side, by her shipping, and on the other, by her\r\nintrigues. This system has not yet come to maturity, but it is unfolded,\r\nand we may rely upon the instructions given to Colonel Brandt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.--TO COLONEL MONROE, August 11, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 9th of July; and since that, have received yours\r\nof the 16th of June, with the interesting intelligence it contained.\r\nI was entirely in the dark as to the progress of that negotiation, and\r\nconcur entirely in the views you have taken of it The difficulty on\r\nwhich it hangs, is a _sine qua non_ with us. It would be to deceive them\r\nand ourselves, to suppose that an amity can be preserved, while this\r\nright is withheld. Such a supposition would argue, not only an ignorance\r\nof the people to whom this is most interesting, but an ignorance of the\r\nnature of man, or an inattention to it. Those who see but halfway into\r\nour true interest, will think that that concurs with the views of the\r\nother party. But those who see it in all its extent, will be sensible\r\nthat our true interest will be best promoted, by making all the just\r\nclaims of our fellow-citizens, wherever situated, our own, by urging and\r\nenforcing them with the weight of our whole influence, and by exercising\r\nin this, as in every other instance, a just government in their\r\nconcerns, and making common cause, even where our separate interest\r\nwould seem opposed to theirs. No other conduct can attach us together;\r\nand on this attachment depends our happiness.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia still lives, and is even said to be better. Europe\r\nis very quiet at present. The only germ of dissension which shows itself\r\nat present, is in the quarter of Turkey. The Emperor, the Empress, and\r\nthe Venetians seem all to be picking at the Turks. It is not probable,\r\nhowever, that either of the two first will do any thing to bring on an\r\nopen rupture, while the King of Prussia lives.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the letters I enclose to Mr. Jay, that Lambe, under\r\nthe pretext of ill health, declines returning either to Congress, Mr.\r\nAdams, or myself. This circumstance makes me fear some malversation.\r\nThe money appropriated to this object being in Holland, and having been\r\nalways under the care of Mr. Adams, it was concerted between us that all\r\nthe drafts should be on him. I know not, therefore, what sums may have\r\nbeen advanced to Lambe; I hope, however, nothing great. I am persuaded\r\nthat an angel sent on this business, and so much limited in his terms,\r\ncould have done nothing. But should Congress propose to try the line of\r\nnegotiation again, I think they will perceive that Lambe is not a proper\r\nagent. I have written to Mr. Adams on the subject of a settlement with\r\nLambe. There is little prospect of accommodation between the Algerines,\r\nand the Portuguese and Neapolitans. A very valuable capture too, lately\r\nmade by them on the Empress of Russia, bids fair to draw her on them.\r\nThe probability is therefore, that these three nations will be at war\r\nwith them, and the possibility is that could we furnish a couple of\r\nfrigates, a convention might be formed with those powers, establishing\r\na perpetual cruise on the coast of Algiers, which would bring them to\r\nreason. Such a convention being left open to all powers willing to come\r\ninto it, should have for its object a general peace, to be guarantied\r\nto each, by the whole. Were only two or three to begin a confederacy of\r\nthis kind, I think every power in Europe would soon fall into it, except\r\nFrance, England, and perhaps Spain and Holland. Of these there is only\r\nEngland who would give any real aid to the Algerines. Morocco, you\r\nperceive, will be at peace with us. Were the honor and advantage of\r\nestablishing such a confederacy out of the question, yet the necessity\r\nthat the United States should have some marine force, and the happiness\r\nof this, as the ostensible cause for beginning it, would decide on its\r\npropriety. It will be said, there is no money in the treasury. There\r\nnever will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its\r\nteeth. The States must see the rod; perhaps it must be felt by some\r\none of them. I am persuaded, all of them would rejoice to see every\r\none obliged to furnish its contributions. It is not the difficulty of\r\nfurnishing them, which beggars the treasury, but the fear that others\r\nwill not furnish as much. Every rational citizen must wish to see an\r\neffective instrument of coercion, and should fear to see it on any other\r\nelement than the water. A naval force can never endanger our liberties,\r\nnor occasion bloodshed: a land force would do both. It is not in the\r\nchoice of the States, whether they will pay money to cover their trade\r\nagainst the Algerines. If they obtain a peace by negotiation, they must\r\npay a great sum of money for it; if they do nothing, they must pay a\r\ngreat sum of money, in the form of insurance; and in either way, as\r\ngreat a one as in the way of force, and probably less effectual.\r\n\r\nI look forward with anxiety to the approaching moment of your departure\r\nfrom Congress. Besides the interest of the confederacy and of the State,\r\nI have a personal interest in it. I know not to whom I may venture\r\nconfidential communications, after you are gone. I take the liberty of\r\nplacing here my respects to Mrs. Monroe, and assurances of the sincere\r\nesteem with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.--TO MR. WYTHE, August 13,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WYTHE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 13,1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir\r\n\r\nYour favors of January the 10th and February the 10th, came to hand\r\non the 20th and 23rd of May. I availed myself of the first opportunity\r\nwhich occurred, by a gentleman going to England, of sending to\r\nMr. Joddrel a copy of the Notes on our country! with a line informing him,\r\nthat it was you who had emboldened me to take that liberty. Madison, no\r\ndoubt, informed you of the reason why I had sent only a single copy to\r\nVirginia. Being assured by him, that they will not do the harm I had\r\napprehended, but on the contrary may do some good, I propose to send\r\nthither the copies remaining on hand, which are fewer than I had\r\nintended. But of the numerous corrections they need, there are one or\r\ntwo so essential, that I must have them made, by printing a few new\r\nleaves, and substituting them for the old. This will be done while\r\nthey are engraving a map which I have constructed, of the country from\r\nAlbemarle sound to Lake Erie, and which will be inserted in the book. A\r\nbad French translation which is getting out here, will probably oblige\r\nme to publish the original more freely; which it did not deserve,\r\nnor did I intend. Your wishes, which are laws to me, will justify my\r\ndestining a copy for you, otherwise, I should as soon have thought\r\nof sending you a horn-book; for there is no truth in it which is not\r\nfamiliar to you, and its errors I should hardly have proposed to treat\r\nyou with.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the receipt of your letter, I wrote to a correspondent at\r\nFlorence to inquire after the family of Tagliaferro, as you desired.\r\nI received his answer two days ago, a copy of which I now enclose.\r\nThe original shall be sent by some other occasion. I will have the\r\ncopper-plate immediately engraved. This may be ready within a few days,\r\nbut the probability is, that I shall be long getting an opportunity of\r\nsending it to you, as these rarely occur. You do not mention the size\r\nof the plate, but presuming it is intended for labels for the inside of\r\nbooks, I shall have it made of a proper size for that. I shall omit the\r\nword _agisos_, according to the license you allow me, because I think\r\nthe beauty of a motto is to condense much matter in as few words as\r\npossible. The word omitted will be supplied by every reader.\r\n\r\nThe European papers have announced, that the Assembly of Virginia were\r\noccupied on the revisal of their code of laws. This, with some other\r\nsimilar intelligence, has contributed much to convince the people of\r\nEurope, that what the English papers are constantly publishing of our\r\nanarchy, is false; as they are sensible that such a work is that of a\r\npeople only, who are in perfect tranquillity. Our act for freedom of\r\nreligion is extremely applauded. The ambassadors and ministers of the\r\nseveral nations of Europe, resident at this court, have asked of me\r\ncopies of it, to send to their sovereigns, and it is inserted at full\r\nlength in several books now in the press; among others, in the new\r\n_Encyclopédie_. I think it will produce considerable good even in these\r\ncountries, where ignorance, superstition, poverty, and oppression of\r\nbody and mind, in every form, are so firmly settled on the mass of the\r\npeople, that their redemption from them can never be hoped. If all the\r\nsovereigns of Europe were to set themselves to work, to emancipate the\r\nminds of their subjects from their present ignorance and prejudices, and\r\nthat, as zealously as they now endeavor the contrary, a thousand years\r\nwould not place them on that high ground, on which our common people\r\nare now setting out. Ours could not have been so fairly placed under the\r\ncontrol of the common sense of the people, had they not been separated\r\nfrom their parent stock, and kept from contamination, either from them,\r\nor the other people of the old world, by the intervention of so wide an\r\nocean. To know the worth of this, one must see the want of it here. I\r\nthink by far the most important bill in our whole code, is that for the\r\ndiffusion of knowledge among the people. No other sure foundation can\r\nbe devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness. If any body\r\nthinks, that kings, nobles, or priests are good conservators of the\r\npublic happiness, send him here. It is the best school in the universe\r\nto cure him of that folly. He will see here, with his own eyes, that\r\nthese descriptions of men are an abandoned confederacy against the\r\nhappiness of the mass of the people. The omnipotence of their effect\r\ncannot be better proved, than in this country particularly, where,\r\nnotwithstanding the finest soil upon earth, the finest climate under\r\nheaven, and a people of the most benevolent, the most gay and amiable\r\ncharacter of which the human form is susceptible; where such a people, I\r\nsay, surrounded by so many blessings from nature, are loaded with misery\r\nby kings, nobles, and priests, and by them alone. Preach, my dear Sir,\r\na crusade against ignorance; establish and improve the law for educating\r\nthe common people. Let our countrymen know, that the people alone can\r\nprotect us against these evils, and that the tax which will be paid for\r\nthis purpose, is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid\r\nto kings, priests, and nobles, who will rise up among us if we leave the\r\npeople in ignorance. The people of England, I think, are less oppressed\r\nthan here. But it needs but half an eye to see, when among them, that\r\nthe foundation is laid in their dispositions for the establishment of\r\na despotism. Nobility, wealth, and pomp are the objects of their\r\nadmiration. They are by no means the free-minded people, we suppose\r\nthem in America. Their learned men, too, are few in number, and are less\r\nlearned, and infinitely less emancipated from prejudice, than those\r\nof this country. An event, too, seems to be preparing, in the order of\r\nthings, which will probably decide the fate of that country. It is no\r\nlonger doubtful, that the harbor of Cherbourg will be complete, that\r\nit will be a most excellent one, and capacious enough to hold the whole\r\nnavy of France. Nothing has ever been wanting to enable this country\r\nto invade that, but a naval force conveniently stationed to protect the\r\ntransports. This change of situation must oblige the English to keep up\r\na great standing army, and there is no King, who, with sufficient force,\r\nis not always ready to make himself absolute. My paper warns me, it is\r\ntime to recommend myself to the friendly recollection of Mrs. Wythe, of\r\nColonel Taliaferro and his family, and particularly of Mr. R. T. and to\r\nassure you of the affectionate esteem, with which I am,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.--TO MRS. COSWAY, October 12, 1786\r\n\r\nTO MRS. COSWAY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Madam,\r\n\r\nHaving performed the last sad office of handing you into your carriage,\r\nat the pavillion de St. Denis, and seen the wheels get actually into\r\nmotion, I turned on my heel and walked, more dead than alive, to the\r\nopposite door, where my own was awaiting me. Mr. Danquerville was\r\nmissing. He was sought for, found, and dragged down stairs. We were\r\ncrammed into the carriage, like recruits for the Bastille, and not\r\nhaving soul enough to give orders to the coachman, he presumed Paris our\r\ndestination, and drove off. After a considerable interval, silence was\r\nbroke, with a ‘_Je suis vraiment affligé du depart de ces bons\r\ngens._’ This was a signal for mutual confession of distress. We began\r\nimmediately to talk of Mr. and Mrs. Cosway, of their goodness, their\r\ntalents, their amiability; and though we spoke of nothing else, we\r\nseemed hardly to have entered into the matter, when the coachman\r\nannounced the rue St. Denis, and that we were opposite Mr.\r\nDanquerville’s. He insisted on descending there, and traversing a short\r\npassage to his lodgings. I was carried home. Seated by my fire-side,\r\nsolitary and sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head and\r\nmy Heart.\r\n\r\nHead. Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.\r\n\r\nHeart. I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings. Overwhelmed\r\nwith grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers\r\nto bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no\r\nmore to feel, or to fear.\r\n\r\nHead. These are the eternal consequences of your warmth and\r\nprecipitation. This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever\r\nleading us. You confess your follies, indeed; but still you hug and\r\ncherish them; and no reformation can be hoped, where there is no\r\nrepentance.\r\n\r\nHeart. Oh, my friend! this is no moment to upbraid my foibles. I am rent\r\ninto fragments by the force of my grief! If you have any balm, pour it\r\ninto my wounds; if none, do not harrow them by new torments. Spare me\r\nin this awful moment! At any other, I will attend with patience to your\r\nadmonitions.\r\n\r\nHead. On the contrary, I never found that the moment of triumph, with\r\nyou, was the moment of attention to my admonitions. While suffering\r\nunder your follies, you may perhaps be made sensible of them; but, the\r\nparoxysm over, you fancy it can never return. Harsh, therefore, as the\r\nmedicine may be, it is my office to administer it. You will be pleased\r\nto remember, that when our friend Trumbull used to be telling us of the\r\nmerits and talents of these good people, I never ceased whispering to\r\nyou that we had no occasion for new acquaintances; that the greater\r\ntheir merit and talents, the more dangerous their friendship to our\r\ntranquillity, because the regret at parting would be greater.\r\n\r\nHeart. Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of my\r\ndoings. It was one of your projects, which threw us in the way of it.\r\nIt was you, remember, and not I, who desired the meeting at Legrand and\r\nMotinos. I never trouble myself with domes nor arches. The _Halle aux\r\nbleds_ might have rotted down, before I should have gone to see it. But\r\nyou, forsooth, who are eternally getting us to sleep with your diagrams\r\nand crotchets, must go and examine this wonderful piece of architecture;\r\nand when you had seen it, oh! it was the most superb thing on earth!\r\nWhat you had seen there was worth all you had yet seen in Paris! I\r\nthought so too. But I meant it of the lady and gentleman to whom we had\r\nbeen presented; and not of a parcel of sticks and chips put together\r\nin pens. You then, Sir, and not I, have been the cause of the present\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nHead. It would have been happy for you, if my diagrams and crotchets\r\nhad gotten you to sleep on that day, as you are pleased to say they\r\neternally do. My visit to Legrand and Motinos, had public utility for\r\nits object. A market is to be built in Richmond. What a commodious plan\r\nis that of Legrand and Motinos; especially, if we put on it the noble\r\ndome of the _Halle aux bleds_. If such a bridge as they showed us, can\r\nbe thrown across the Schuylkill, at Philadelphia, the floating bridges\r\ntaken up, and the navigation of that river opened, what a copious\r\nresource will be added of wood and provisions, to warm and feed the poor\r\nof that city? While I was occupied with these objects, you were dilating\r\nwith your new acquaintances, and contriving how to prevent a separation\r\nfrom them. Every soul of you had an engagement for the day. Yet all\r\nthese were to be sacrificed, that you might dine together. Lying\r\nmessengers were to be despatched into every quarter of the city, with\r\napologies for your breach of engagement. You, particularly, had the\r\neffrontery to send word to the Duchess Danville, that on the moment\r\nwe were setting out to dine with her, despatches came to hand, which\r\nrequired immediate attention. You wanted me to invent a more ingenious\r\nexcuse; but I knew you were getting into a scrape, and I would have\r\nnothing to do with it. Well; after dinner to St. Cloud, from St. Cloud\r\nto Ruggieri’s, from Ruggieri’s to Krumfoltz; and if the day had been as\r\nlong as a Lapland summer day, you would still have contrived means among\r\nyou to have filled it.\r\n\r\nHeart. Oh! my dear friend, how you have revived me, by recalling to mind\r\nthe transactions of that day! How well I remember them all, and that\r\nwhen I came home at night, and looked back to the morning, it seemed to\r\nhave been a month agone. Go on, then, like a kind comforter, and paint\r\nto me the day we went to St. Germains. How beautiful was every object!\r\nthe _Port de Reuilly_, the hills along the Seine, the rainbows of the\r\nmachine of Marly, the terras of St. Germains, the chateaux, the gardens,\r\nthe statues of Marly, the pavillion of Lucienne. Recollect, too, Madrid,\r\nBagatelle, the King’s garden, the Desert. How grand the idea excited by\r\nthe remains of such a column. The spiral staircase, too, was beautiful.\r\nEvery moment was filled with something agreeable. The wheels of time\r\nmoved on with a rapidity, of which those of our carriage gave but a\r\nfaint idea. And yet, in the evening, when one took a retrospect of the\r\nday, what a mass of happiness had we travelled over! Retrace all those\r\nscenes to me, my good companion, and I will forgive the unkindness with\r\nwhich you were chiding me. The day we went to St. Germains was a little\r\ntoo warm, I think; was it not?\r\n\r\nHead. Thou art the most incorrigible of all the beings that ever sinned!\r\nI reminded you of the follies of the first day, intending to deduce from\r\nthence some useful lessons for you, but instead of listening to them,\r\nyou kindle at the recollection, you retrace the whole series with a\r\nfondness, which shows you want nothing but the opportunity, to act\r\nit over again. I often told you, during its course, that you were\r\nimprudently engaging your affections, under circumstances that must cost\r\nyou a great deal of pain; that the persons, indeed, were of the greatest\r\nmerit, possessing good sense, good humor, honest hearts, honest manners,\r\nand eminence in a lovely art; that the lady had, moreover, qualities and\r\naccomplishments belonging to her sex, which might form a chapter\r\napart for her; such as music, modesty, beauty, and that softness of\r\ndisposition, which is the ornament of her sex, and charm of ours: but\r\nthat all these considerations would increase the pang of separation,\r\nthat their stay here was to be short; that you rack our whole system\r\nwhen you are parted from those you love, complaining that such a\r\nseparation is worse than death, inasmuch as this ends our sufferings,\r\nwhereas that only begins them; and that the separation would, in this\r\ninstance, be the more severe, as you, would probably never see them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHeart. But they told me, they would come back again the next year.\r\n\r\nHead. But in the mean time, see what you surfer: and their return, too,\r\ndepends on so many circumstances, that, if you had a grain of prudence,\r\nyou would not count upon it. Upon the whole, it is improbable, and\r\ntherefore you should abandon the idea of ever seeing them again.\r\n\r\nHeart. May Heaven abandon me, if I do!\r\n\r\nHead. Very well. Suppose, then, they come back. They are to stay two\r\nmonths, and when these are expired, what is to follow? Perhaps you\r\nflatter yourself they may come to America?\r\n\r\nHeart. God only knows what is to happen. I see nothing impossible in\r\nthat supposition: and I see things wonderfully contrived sometimes to\r\nmake us happy. Where could they find such objects as in America, for\r\nthe exercise of their enchanting art; especially the lady, who paints\r\nlandscapes so inimitably? She wants only subjects worthy of immortality,\r\nto render her pencil immortal. The Falling Spring, the Cascade of\r\nNiagara, the Passage of the Potomac through the Blue Mountains, the\r\nNatural Bridge; it is worth a voyage across the Atlantic to see these\r\nobjects; much more to paint, and make them, and thereby ourselves, known\r\nto all ages. And our own dear Monticello; where has nature spread so\r\nrich a mantle under the eye?--mountains, forests rocks, rivers. With\r\nwhat majesty do we there ride above the storms! How sublime to look\r\ndown into the workhouse of nature to see her clouds, hail, snow, rain,\r\nthunder, all fabricated at our feet! and the glorious sun when rising as\r\nif out of a distant water, lust gilding the tops of the mountains, and\r\ngiving life to all nature! 1 hope in God, no circumstance may ever make\r\neither seek an asylum from grief! With what sincere sympathy I would\r\nopen every cell of my composition, to receive the effusion of their\r\nwoes!\r\n\r\nI would pour my tears into their wounds; and if a drop of balm could be\r\nfound on the top of the Cordilleras, or at the remotest sources of the\r\nMissouri, I would go thither myself to seek and to bring it. Deeply\r\npractised in the school of affliction, the human heart knows no joy\r\nwhich I have not lost, no sorrow of which I have not drank! Fortune can\r\npresent no grief of unknown form to me! Who, then, can so softly bind\r\nup the wound of another, as he who has felt the same wound himself? But\r\nHeaven forbid, they should ever know a sorrow! Let us turn over another\r\nleaf, for this has distracted me.\r\n\r\nHead. Well. Let us put this possibility to trial, then, on another\r\npoint. When you consider the character which is given of our country\r\nby the lying newspapers of London, and their credulous copyers in other\r\ncountries; when you reflect, that all Europe is made to believe we are a\r\nlawless banditti, in a state of absolute anarchy, cutting one another’s\r\nthroats, and plundering without distinction, how could you expect, that\r\nany reasonable creature would venture among us?\r\n\r\nHeart. But you and I know, that all this is false: that there is not a\r\ncountry on earth, where there is greater tranquillity; where the laws\r\nare milder, or better obeyed; where every one is more attentive to his\r\nown business, or meddles less with that of others; where strangers\r\nare better received, more hospitably treated, and with a more sacred\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nHead. True, you and I know this, but your friends do not know it.\r\n\r\nHeart. But they are sensible people, who think for themselves. They will\r\nask of impartial foreigners, who have been among us, whether they saw or\r\nheard on the spot any instance of anarchy. They will judge, too, that a\r\npeople occupied, as we are, in opening rivers, digging navigable canals,\r\nmaking roads, building public schools, establishing academies, erecting\r\nbusts and statues to our great men, protecting religious freedom,\r\nabolishing sanguinary punishments, reforming and improving our laws in\r\ngeneral; they will judge, I say, for themselves, whether these are not\r\nthe occupations of a people at their ease; whether this is not better\r\nevidence of our true state, than a London newspaper, hired to lie, and\r\nfrom which no truth can ever be extracted, but by reversing every thing\r\nit says.\r\n\r\nHead. I did not begin this lecture, my friend, with a view to learn from\r\nyou what America is doing. Let us return, then, to our point. I wish to\r\nmake you sensible how imprudent it is to place your affections without\r\nreserve on objects you must so soon lose, and whose loss, when it comes,\r\nmust cost you such severe pangs. Remember the last night. You knew your\r\nfriends were to leave Paris to-day. This was enough to throw you into\r\nagonies. All night you tossed us from one side of the bed to the other;\r\nno sleep, no rest. The poor Crippled wrist, too, never left one moment\r\nin the same position; now up, now down, now here, now there; was it\r\nto be wondered at, if its pains returned? The surgeon then was to be\r\ncalled, and to be rated as an ignoramus, because he could not divine the\r\ncause of this extraordinary change. In fine, my friend, you must mend\r\nyour manners. This is not a world to live at random in, as you do. To\r\navoid those eternal distresses, to which you are for ever exposing\r\nus, you must learn to look forward before you take a step, which may\r\ninterest our peace. Every thing in this world is matter of calculation.\r\nAdvance, then, with caution, the balance in your hand. Put into one\r\nscale the pleasures which any object may offer; but put fairly into the\r\nother the pains which are to follow, and see which preponderates. The\r\nmaking an acquaintance is not a matter of indifference. When a new\r\none is proposed to you, view it all round. Consider what advantages it\r\npresents, and to what inconveniences it may expose you. Do not bite at\r\nthe bait of pleasure, till you know there is no hook beneath it. The\r\nart of life is the art of avoiding pain; and he is the best pilot, who\r\nsteers clearest of the rocks and shoals with which it is beset. Pleasure\r\nis always before us; but misfortune is at our side: while running after\r\nthat, this arrests us. The most effectual means of being secure\r\nagainst pain, is to retire within ourselves, and to suffice for our own\r\nhappiness. Those which depend on ourselves, are the only pleasures a\r\nwise man will count on; for nothing is ours, which another may deprive\r\nus of. Hence the inestimable value of intellectual pleasures. Ever in\r\nour power, always leading us to something new, never cloying, we\r\nride serene and sublime above the concerns of this mortal world,\r\ncontemplating truth and nature, matter and motion, the laws which bind\r\nup their existence, and that Eternal Being, who made and bound them up\r\nby those laws. Let this be our employ. Leave the bustle and tumult of\r\nsociety to those who have not talents to occupy themselves without them.\r\nFriendship is but another name for an alliance with the follies and\r\nthe misfortunes of others. Our own share of miseries is sufficient: why\r\nenter then as volunteers into those of another? Is there so little\r\ngall poured into our cup, that we must heed help to drink that of our\r\nneighbor? A friend dies, or leaves us: we feel as if a limb was cut off.\r\nHe is sick: we must watch over him, and participate of his pains. His\r\nfortune is shipwrecked: ours must be laid under contribution. He loses a\r\nchild, a parent, or a partner: we must mourn the loss as if it were our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHeart. And what more sublime delight, than to mingle tears with one whom\r\nthe hand of Heaven hath smitten! to watch over the bed of sickness, and\r\nto beguile its tedious and its painful moments! to share our bread with\r\none to whom misfortune has left none! This world abounds indeed with\r\nmisery: to lighten its burthen, we must divide it with one another. But\r\nlet us now try the virtue of your mathematical balance, and as you have\r\nput into one scale the burthens of friendship, let me put its comforts\r\ninto the other. When languishing then under disease, how grateful is the\r\nsolace of our friends! how are we penetrated with their assiduities and\r\nattentions! how much are we supported by their encouragements and kind\r\noffices! When Heaven has taken from us some object of our love, how\r\nsweet is it to have a bosom whereon to recline our heads, and into which\r\nwe may pour the torrent of our tears! Grief, with such a comfort, is\r\nalmost a luxury! In a life where we are perpetually exposed to want and\r\naccident, yours is a wonderful proposition, to insulate ourselves,\r\nto retire from all aid, and to wrap ourselves in the mantle of\r\nself-sufficiency! For assuredly nobody will care for him, who cares for\r\nnobody. But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the\r\nsunshine of life: and thanks to a benevolent arrangement of things, the\r\ngreater part of life is sunshine. I will recur for proof to the days we\r\nhave lately passed. On these, indeed, the sun shone brightly! How\r\ngay did the face of nature appear! Hills, valleys, chateaux, gardens,\r\nrivers, every object wore its liveliest hue! Whence did they borrow it?\r\nFrom the presence of our charming companion. They were pleasing, because\r\nshe seemed pleased. Alone, the scene would have been dull and insipid:\r\nthe participation of it with her gave it relish. Let the gloomy monk,\r\nsequestered from the world, seek unsocial pleasures in the bottom of his\r\ncell! Let the sublimated philosopher grasp visionary happiness, while\r\npursuing phantoms dressed in the garb of truth! Their supreme wisdom is\r\nsupreme folly: and they mistake for happiness the mere absence of pain.\r\nHad they ever felt the solid pleasure of one generous spasm of the\r\nheart, they would exchange for it all the frigid speculations of their\r\nlives, which you have been vaunting in such elevated terms. Believe\r\nme, then, my friend, that that is a miserable arithmetic, which could\r\nestimate friendship at nothing, or at less than nothing. Respect for\r\nyou has induced me to enter into this discussion, and to hear principles\r\nuttered, which I detest and abjure. Respect for myself now obliges me to\r\nrecall you into the proper limits of your office. When nature assigned\r\nus the same habitation, she gave us over it a divided empire. To you she\r\nallotted the field of science; to me that of morals.\r\n\r\nWhen the circle is to be squared, or the orbit of a comet to be traced;\r\nwhen the arch of greatest strength, or the solid of least resistance is\r\nto be investigated, take up the problem; it is yours; nature has given\r\nme no cognizance of it. In like manner, in denying to you the feelings\r\nof sympathy, of benevolence, of gratitude, of justice, of love, of\r\nfriendship, she has excluded you from their control. To these she has\r\nadapted the mechanism of the heart. Morals were too essential to the\r\nhappiness of man, to be risked on the uncertain combinations of the\r\nhead. She laid their foundation, therefore, in sentiment, not in\r\nscience. That she gave to all, as necessary to all: this to a few only,\r\nas sufficing with a few. I know indeed, that you pretend authority to\r\nthe sovereign control of our conduct, in all its parts: and a respect\r\nfor your grave saws and maxims, a desire to do what is right, has\r\nsometimes induced me to conform to your counsels. A few facts, however,\r\nwhich I can readily recall to your memory, will suffice to prove to you,\r\nthat nature has not organized you for our moral direction. When the poor\r\nwearied soldier, whom we overtook at Chickahominy, with his pack on\r\nhis back, begged us to let him get up behind our chariot, you began to\r\ncalculate that the road was full of soldiers, and that if all should be\r\ntaken up, our horses would fail in their journey. We drove on therefore.\r\nBut soon becoming sensible you had made me do wrong, that though we\r\ncannot relieve all the distressed, we should relieve as many as we can,\r\nI turned about to take up the soldier; but he had entered a by-path,\r\nand was no more to be found: and from that moment to this, I could never\r\nfind him out to ask his forgiveness. Again, when the poor woman came\r\nto ask a charity in Philadelphia, you whispered, that she looked like\r\na drunkard, and that half a dollar was enough to give her for the\r\nale-house. Those who want the dispositions to give, easily find reasons\r\nwhy they ought not to give. When I sought her out afterwards, and did\r\nwhat I should have done at first, you know, that she employed the money\r\nimmediately towards placing her child at school. If our country, when\r\npressed with wrongs at the point of the bayonet, had been governed by\r\nits heads instead of its’ hearts, where should we have been now? Hanging\r\non a gallows as high as Hainan’s. You began to calculate, and to compare\r\nwealth and numbers: we threw up a few pulsations of our blood; we\r\nsupplied enthusiasm against wealth and numbers; we put our existence to\r\nthe hazard, when the hazard seemed against us, and we saved our country:\r\njustifying, at the same time, the ways of Providence, whose precept is,\r\nto do always what is right, and leave the issue to him. In short, my\r\nfriend, as far as my recollection serves me, I do not know that I ever\r\ndid a good thing on your suggestion, or a dirty one without it. I do for\r\never, then, disclaim your interference in my province. Fill paper as you\r\nplease with triangles and squares: try how many ways you can hang and\r\ncombine them together. I shall never envy nor control your sublime\r\ndelights. But leave me to decide when and where friendships are to be\r\ncontracted. You say I contract them at random. So you said the woman at\r\nPhiladelphia was a drunkard. I receive none into my esteem, till I know\r\nthey are worthy of it. Wealth, title, office, are no recommendations to\r\nmy friendship. On the contrary, great good qualities are requisite to\r\nmake amends for their having wealth, title, and office. You confess,\r\nthat, in the present case, I could not have made a worthier choice.\r\nYou only object, that I was so soon to lose them. We are not immortal\r\nourselves, my friend; how can we expect our enjoyments to be so? We have\r\nno rose without its thorn; no pleasure without alloy. It is the law of\r\nour existence; and we must acquiesce. It is the condition annexed to all\r\nour pleasures, not by us who receive, but by him who gives them. True,\r\nthis condition is pressing cruelly on me at this moment. I feel more fit\r\nfor death than life. But when I look back on the pleasures of which\r\nit is the consequence, I am conscious they were worth the price I am\r\npaying. Notwithstanding your endeavors, too, to damp my hopes, I comfort\r\nmyself with expectations of their promised return. Hope is sweeter than\r\ndespair; and they were too good to mean to deceive me. ‘In the summer,’\r\nsaid the gentleman; but ‘In the spring,’ said the lady; and I should\r\nlove her for ever, were it only for that! Know, then, my friend, that I\r\nhave taken these good people into my bosom; that I have lodged them in\r\nthe warmest cell I could find; that I love them, and will continue to\r\nlove them through life; that if fortune should dispose them on one side\r\nthe globe, and me on the other, my affections shall pervade its whole\r\nmass to reach them. Knowing then my determination, attempt not to\r\ndisturb it. If you can at any time furnish matter for their amusement,\r\nit will be the office of a good neighbor to do it. I will, in like\r\nmanner, seize any occasion which may offer, to do the like good turn for\r\nyou with Condorcet, Rittenhouse, Madison, La Cretelle, or any other of\r\nthose worthy sons of science, whom you so justly prize.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought this a favorable proposition whereon to rest the issue of the\r\ndialogue. So I put an end to it by calling for my nightcap. Methinks, I\r\nhear you wish to Heaven I had called a little sooner, and so spared you\r\nthe _ennui_ of such a sermon. I did not interrupt them sooner, because\r\nI was in a mood for hearing sermons. You, too, were the subject; and on\r\nsuch a thesis, I never think the theme long; not even if I am to write\r\nit, and that slowly and awkwardly, as now, with the left hand. But\r\nthat you may not be discouraged from a correspondence, which begins\r\nso formidably, I will promise you, on my honor, that my future letters\r\nshall be of a reasonable length. I will even agree to express but half\r\nmy esteem for you, for fear of cloying you with too full a dose. But on\r\nyour part, no curtailing. If your letters are as long as the Bible,\r\nthey will appear short to me. Only let them be brim full of affection. I\r\nshall read them with the dispositions with which Arlequin, in _Les\r\nDeux Billets_, spelt the words ‘_Je t’aime,_’ and wished that the whole\r\nalphabet had entered into their composition.\r\n\r\nWe have had incessant rains since your departure. These make me fear for\r\nyour health, as well as that you had an uncomfortable journey. The same\r\ncause has prevented me from being able to give you any account of your\r\nfriends here. This voyage to Fontainebleau will probably send the Count\r\nde Moutier and the Marquis de Brehan to America. Danquerville promised\r\nto visit me, but has not done it as yet. De la Tude comes sometimes to\r\ntake family soup with me, and entertains me with anecdotes of his five\r\nand thirty years’ imprisonment. How fertile is the mind of man, which\r\ncan make the Bastille and dungeon of Vincennes yield interesting\r\nanecdotes! You know this was for making four verses on Madame de\r\nPompadour. But I think you told me you did not know the verses. They\r\nwere these.\r\n\r\n     ‘Sans esprit, sans sentiment,\r\n     Sans etre belle, ni neuve,\r\n     En France on peut avoir le premier amant:\r\n     Pompadour en est Tepreuve.’\r\n\r\nI have read the memoir of his three escapes. As to myself, my health is\r\ngood, except my wrist, which mends slowly, and my mind, which mends not\r\nat all, but broods constantly over your departure. The lateness of\r\nthe season obliges me to decline my journey into the south of France.\r\nPresent me in the most friendly terms to Mr. Cosway, and receive me into\r\nyour own recollection with a partiality and warmth, proportioned not\r\nto my own poor merit, but to the sentiments of sincere affection and\r\nesteem, with which I have the honor to be, my Dear Madam,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.--TO MRS. COSWAY, October 13, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. COSWAY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Madam,\r\n\r\nJust as I had sealed the enclosed, I received a letter of a good length,\r\ndated Antwerp, with your name at the bottom. I prepared myself for a\r\nfeast. I read two or three sentences: looked again at the signature, to\r\nsee if I had not mistaken it. It was visibly yours. Read a sentence or\r\ntwo more. Diable! Spelt your name distinctly. There was not a letter of\r\nit omitted. Began to read again. In fine, after reading a little, and\r\nexamining the signature alternately, half a dozen times, I found that\r\nyour name was to four lines only, instead of four pages. I thank you\r\nfor the four lines, however, because they prove you think of me; little,\r\nindeed, but better little than none. To show how much I think of you, I\r\nsend you the enclosed letter of three sheets of paper, being a history\r\nof the evening I parted with you. But how expect you should read a\r\nletter of three mortal sheets of paper? I will tell you. Divide it into\r\nsix doses of half a sheet each, and every day, when the toilette begins,\r\ntake a dose, that is to say, read half a sheet. By this means, it\r\nwill have the only merit its length and dulness can aspire to, that of\r\nassisting your coiffeuse to procure you six good naps of sleep. I will\r\neven allow you twelve days to get through it, holding you rigorously to\r\none condition only, that is, that at whatever hour you receive this, you\r\ndo not break the seal of the enclosed till the next toilette. Of this\r\ninjunction I require a sacred execution. I rest it on your friendship,\r\nand that in your first letter, you tell me honestly, whether you have\r\nhonestly performed it. I send you the song I promised. Bring me in\r\nreturn the subject, _Jours heureux!_ Were I a songster, I should sing it\r\nall to these words; ‘_Dans ces lieux qu’elle tarde à se rendre!_’ Learn\r\nit, I pray you, and sing it with feeling. My right hand presents its\r\ndevoirs to you, and sees with great indignation the left supplanting it\r\nin a correspondence so much valued. You will know the first moment it\r\ncan resume its rights. The first exercise of them shall be addressed to\r\nyou, as you had the first essay of its rival. It will yet, however, be\r\nmany a day. Present my esteem to Mr. Cosway, and believe me to be yours\r\nvery affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.--M. LE ROY DE L’ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES, November 13, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nM. LE ROY DE L’ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES.\r\n\r\nParis, November 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received the honor of yours of September the 18th, a day or two after\r\nthe accident of a dislocated wrist had disabled me from writing. I have\r\nwaited thus long in constant hope of recovering its use. But finding\r\nthat this hope walks before me like my shadow, I can no longer oppose\r\nthe desire and duty of answering your polite and learned letter. I\r\ntherefore employ my left hand in the office of scribe, which it performs\r\nindeed slowly, awkwardly, and badly.\r\n\r\nThe information given by me to the Marquis de Chastellux, and alluded to\r\nin his book and in your letter, was, that the sea breezes which prevail\r\nin the lower parts of Virginia, during the summer months, and in the\r\nwarm parts of-the day, had made a sensible progress into the interior\r\ncountry: that formerly, within the memory of persons living, they\r\nextended but little above Williamsburg; that afterwards they became\r\nsensible as high as Richmond; and that, at present, they penetrate\r\nsometimes as far as the first mountains, which are above an hundred\r\nmiles further from the sea coast, than Williamsburg is. It is very rare,\r\nindeed, that they reach those mountains, and not till the afternoon is\r\nconsiderably advanced. A light northwesterly breeze is, for the most\r\npart, felt there, while an easterly or northeasterly wind is blowing\r\nstrongly in the lower country. How far northward and southward of\r\nVirginia, this easterly breeze Takes place, I am not informed. I must,\r\ntherefore, be understood as speaking of that State only, which extends\r\non the sea coast from 36 1/2 to 38° of latitude.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact. We know too little of the operations of nature in the\r\nphysical world, to assign causes with any degree of confidence. Willing\r\nalways, however, to guess at what we do not know, I have sometimes\r\nindulged myself with conjectures on the causes of the phenomena above\r\nstated. I will hazard them on paper, for your amusement, premising for\r\ntheir foundation some principles believed to be true.\r\n\r\nAir resting on a heated and reflecting surface, becomes warmer, rarer,\r\nand lighter: it ascends therefore, and the circumjacent air, which is\r\ncolder and heavier, flows into its place, becomes warmed and lightened\r\nin its turn, ascends, and is succeeded as that which went before. If the\r\nheated surface be circular, the air flows to it from every quarter,\r\nlike the rays of a circle to its centre. If it be a zone of determinate\r\nbreadth and indefinite length, the air will flow from each side\r\nperpendicularly on it. If the currents of air flowing from opposite\r\nsides, be of equal force, they will meet in equilibrio, at a line\r\ndrawn longitudinally through the middle of the zone. If one current be\r\nstronger than the other, the stronger one will force back the line of\r\nequilibrium, towards the further edge of the zone, or even beyond it:\r\nthe motion it has acquired causing it to overshoot the zone, as the\r\nmotion acquired by a pendulum in its descent, causes it to vibrate\r\nbeyond the point of its lowest descent.\r\n\r\nEarth, exposed naked to the sun’s rays, absorbs a good portion of them;\r\nbut, being an opaque body, those rays penetrate to a small depth only.\r\nIts surface, by this accumulation of absorbed rays, becomes considerably\r\nheated. The residue of the rays are reflected into the air resting on\r\nthat surface. This air, then, is warmed, 1. by the direct rays of the\r\nsun; 2. by its reflected rays; 3. by contact with the heated surface.\r\nA forest receiving the sun’s rays, a part of them enters the intervals\r\nbetween the trees, and their reflection upwards is intercepted by the\r\nleaves and boughs. The rest fall on the trees, the leaves of which being\r\ngenerally inclined towards the horizon, reflect the rays downwards. The\r\natmosphere here, then, receives little or no heat by reflection. Again,\r\nthese leaves having a power of keeping themselves cool by their own\r\ntranspiration, they impart no heat to the air by contact. Reflection\r\nand contact, then, two of the three modes before-mentioned, of\r\ncommunicating heat, are wanting here; and, of course, the air over\r\na country covered by forest must be colder than that over cultivated\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe sea being pellucid, the sun’s rays penetrate it to a considerable\r\ndepth. Being also fluid, and in perpetual agitation, its parts are\r\nconstantly mixed together; so that instead of its heat being all\r\naccumulated in its surface, as in the case of a solid, opaque body,\r\nit is diffused through its whole mass. Its surface, therefore, is\r\ncomparatively cool, for these reasons; to which may be added that of\r\nevaporation. The small degree of reflection which might otherwise take\r\nplace, is generally prevented by the rippled state of its surface. The\r\nair resting on the sea, then, like that resting on a forest, receives\r\nlittle or no heat by reflection or contact; and is therefore colder than\r\nthat which lies over a cultivated country.\r\n\r\nTo apply these observations to the phenomena under consideration. The\r\nfirst settlements of Virginia were made along the sea coast, bearing\r\nfrom the south, towards the north, a little eastwardly. These\r\nsettlements formed a zone, in which, though every point was not cleared\r\nof its forest, yet a good proportion was cleared and cultivated. The\r\ncultivated earth, as the sun advances above the horizon in the morning,\r\nacquires from it an intense heat, which is retained and increased\r\nthrough the warm parts of the day. The air resting on it becomes warm\r\nin proportion, and rises. On one side is a country still covered with\r\nforest: on the other is the ocean. The colder air from both of these,\r\nthen rushes towards the heated zone, to supply the place left vacant\r\nthere by the ascent of its warm air. The breeze from the west is light\r\nand feeble; because it traverses a country covered with mountains and\r\nforests, which retard its current. That from the east is strong; as\r\npassing over the ocean, wherein there is no obstacle to its motion.\r\nIt is probable, therefore, that this easterly breeze forces itself far\r\ninto, or perhaps beyond, the zone which produces it. This zone is,\r\nby the increase of population, continually widening into the interior\r\ncountry. The line of equilibrium between the easterly and westerly\r\nbreezes is, therefore, progressive.\r\n\r\nDid no foreign causes intervene, the sea breezes would be a little\r\nsouthwardly of the east, that direction being perpendicular to our\r\ncoast. But within the tropics, there are winds which blow continually\r\nand strongly from the east. This current affects the course of the air,\r\neven without the tropics. The same cause, too, which produces a strong\r\nmotion of the air, from east to west, between the tropics, to wit, the\r\nsun, exercises its influence without those limits, but more feebly, in\r\nproportion as the surface of the globe is there more obliquely presented\r\nto its rays. This effect, though not great, is not to be neglected when\r\nthe sun is in or near our summer solstice, which is the season of these\r\neasterly breezes. The northern air, too, flowing towards the equatorial\r\nparts, to supply the vacuum made there by the ascent of their heated\r\nair, has only the small rotary motion of the polar latitudes from which\r\nit comes. Nor does it suddenly acquire the swifter rotation of the parts\r\ninto which it enters. This gives it the effect of a motion opposed to\r\nthat of the earth, that is to say, of an easterly one. And all these\r\ncauses together are known to produce currents of air in the Atlantic,\r\nvarying from east to northeast, as far as the fortieth degree of\r\nlatitude. It is this current which presses our sea breeze out of its\r\nnatural southeasterly direction, to an easterly, and sometimes almost a\r\nnortheasterly one.\r\n\r\nWe are led naturally to ask, where the progress of our sea breezes will\r\nultimately be stopped? No confidence can be placed in any answer to\r\nthis question. If they should ever pass the mountainous country which\r\nseparates the waters of the ocean from those of the Mississippi, there\r\nmay be circumstances which might aid their further progress, as far as\r\nthe Mississippi. That mountainous country commences about two hundred\r\nmiles from the sea coast, and consists of successive ranges passing\r\nfrom northeast to southwest, and rising the one above the other to the\r\nAllegany Ridge, which is the highest of all. From that, lower and lower\r\nridges succeed one another again, till having covered, in the whole, a\r\nbreadth of two hundred miles from southeast to northwest, they subside\r\ninto a plain, fertile country, extending four hundred miles to the\r\nMississippi, and probably much further on the other side, towards the\r\nheads of the western waters. When this country shall become cultivated,\r\nit will, for the reasons before explained, draw to it winds from\r\nthe east and west. In this case, should the sea breezes pass the\r\nintermediate mountains, they will rather be aided than opposed in their\r\nfurther progress to the Mississippi. There are circumstances, however,\r\nwhich render it possible that they may not be able to pass those\r\nintermediate mountains. 1. These mountains constitute the highest lands\r\nwithin the United States. The air on them must consequently be very cold\r\nand heavy, and have a tendency to flow both to the east and west. 2.\r\nRanging across the current of the sea breezes, they are in themselves,\r\nso many successive barriers opposed to their progress. 3. The country\r\nthey occupy is covered with trees, which assist to weaken and spend\r\nthe force of the breezes. 4. It will remain so covered; a very small\r\nproportion of it being capable of culture. 5. The temperature of its\r\nair, then, will never be softened by culture.\r\n\r\nWhether in the plain country between the Mississippi and Allegany\r\nmountains, easterly or westerly winds prevail at present, I am not\r\ninformed. I conjecture, however, that they must be westerly: and I\r\nthink with you, Sir, that if those mountains were to subside into\r\nplain country, as their opposition to the westerly winds would then be\r\nremoved, they would repress more powerfully those from the east, and of\r\ncourse would remove the line of equilibrium nearer to the sea coast for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion to mention the course of the tropical winds from\r\neast to west, I will add some observations connected with them. They are\r\nknown to occasion a strong current in the ocean, in the same direction.\r\nThis current breaks on that wedge of land of which Saint Roque is the\r\npoint; the southern column of it probably turning off and washing the\r\ncoast of Brazil. I say probably, because I have never heard the fact,\r\nand conjecture it from reason only. The northern column, having its\r\nwestern motion diverted towards the north, and reinforced by the\r\ncurrents of the great rivers Orinoko, Amazons, and Tocantin, has\r\nprobably been the agent which formed the Gulf of Mexico, cutting the\r\nAmerican continent nearly in two, in that part. It re-issues into the\r\nocean at the northern end of the Gulf, and passes by the name of the\r\nGulf Stream, all along the coast of the United States, to its northern\r\nextremity. There it turns off eastwardly, having formed by its eddy, at\r\nthis turn, the Banks of Newfoundland. Through the whole of its course,\r\nfrom the Gulf to the Banks, it retains a very sensible warmth. The\r\nSpaniards are, at this time, desirous of trading to their Philippine\r\nIslands, by the way of the Cape of Good Hope: but opposed in it by the\r\nDutch, under authority of the treaty of Munster, they are examining the\r\npracticability of a common passage through the Straits of Magellan, or\r\nround Cape Horn. Were they to make an opening through the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, a work much less difficult than some even of the inferior canals\r\nof France, however small this opening should be in the beginning, the\r\ntropical current entering it with all its force, would soon widen it\r\nsufficiently for its own passage, and thus complete in a short time,\r\nthat work which otherwise will still employ it for ages. Less country,\r\ntoo, would be destroyed by it in this way. These consequences would\r\nfollow. 1. Vessels from Europe or the western coast of Africa, by\r\nentering the tropics, would have a steady wind and tide to carry them\r\nthrough the Atlantic, through America and the Pacific ocean, to every\r\npart of the Asiatic coast, and of the eastern coast of Africa: thus\r\nperforming with speed and safety the tour of the whole globe, to within\r\nabout twenty-four degrees of longitude, or one fifteenth part of its\r\ncircumference; the African continent, under the line, occupying about\r\nthat space. 2. The Gulf of Mexico, now the most dangerous navigation in\r\nthe world on account of its currents and moveable sands, would become\r\nstagnant and safe. 3. The Gulf Stream on the coast of the United States\r\nwould cease, and with that, those derangements of course and reckoning,\r\nwhich now impede and endanger the intercourse with those States. 4. The\r\nfogs on the Banks of Newfoundland,* supposed to be the vapors of the\r\nGulf Stream rendered turbid by cold air, would disappear. 5. Those Banks\r\nceasing to receive supplies of sand, weeds, and warm water, by the Gulf\r\nStream, it might become problematical what effect changes of pasture and\r\ntemperatures would have on the fisheries. However it is time to\r\nrelieve you from this long lecture. I wish its subject may have been\r\nsufficiently interesting to make amends for its details. These are\r\nsubmitted with entire deference to your better judgment. I will only\r\nadd to them, by assuring you of the sentiments of perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [* This ingenious and probable conjecture, I found in a\r\n     letter from Dr. Franklin to yourself, published in the late\r\n     volume of the American Philosophical Transactions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, November 14, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, November 14, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe house of Le Coulteux, which for some centuries has been the\r\nwealthiest of this place, has it in contemplation to establish a great\r\ncompany for the fur trade. They propose that partners interested\r\none half in the establishment, should be American citizens, born and\r\nresiding in the United States. Yet if I understood them rightly, they\r\nexpect that the half of the company which resides here, should make the\r\ngreatest part, or perhaps the whole of the advances, while those on\r\nour side the water should superintend the details. They had, at first,\r\nthought of Baltimore as the centre of their American transactions. I\r\nhave pointed out to them the advantages of Alexandria for this purpose.\r\nThey have concluded to take information as to Baltimore, Philadelphia,\r\nand New York, for a principal deposit, and having no correspondent at\r\nAlexandria, have asked me to procure a state of the advantages of that\r\nplace, as also to get a recommendation of the best merchant there, to be\r\nadopted as partner and head of the business there. Skill, punctuality,\r\nand integrity are the requisites in such a character. They will decide\r\non their whole information, as to the place for their principal factory.\r\nBeing unwilling that Alexandria should lose its pretensions, I have\r\nundertaken to procure them information as to that place. If they\r\nundertake this trade at all, it will be on so great a scale as to decide\r\nthe current of the Indian-trade to the place they adopt. I have no\r\nacquaintance at Alexandria or in its neighborhood; but believing you\r\nwould feel an interest in the matter, from the same motives which I do,\r\nI venture to ask the favor of you to recommend to me a proper merchant\r\nfor their purpose, and to engage some well informed person to send me a\r\nrepresentation of the advantages of Alexandria, as the principal deposit\r\nof the fur trade.\r\n\r\nThe author of the political part of the _Encyclopédie Méthodique_\r\ndesired me to examine his article, _Etats Unis_. I did so. I found it\r\na tissue of errors; for in truth they know nothing about us here.\r\nParticularly, however, the article Cincinnati was a mere philippic\r\nagainst that institution: in which it appeared that there was an utter\r\nignorance of facts and motives. I gave him notes on it. He reformed\r\nit, as he supposed, and sent it again to me to revise. In this reformed\r\nstate, Colonel Humphreys saw it.\r\n\r\nI found it necessary to write that article for him. Before I gave it to\r\nhim, I showed it to the Marquis de la Fayette, who made a correction or\r\ntwo. I then sent it to the author. He used the materials, mixing a great\r\ndeal of his own with them. In a work which is sure of going down to the\r\nlatest posterity, I thought it material to set facts to rights, as much\r\nas possible. The author was well disposed; but could not entirely get\r\nthe better of his original bias. I send you the article as ultimately\r\npublished. If you find any material errors in it, and will be so good\r\nas to inform me of them, I shall probably have opportunities of setting\r\nthis author to rights. What has heretofore passed between us on this\r\ninstitution, makes it my duty to mention to you, that I have never heard\r\na person in Europe, learned or unlearned, express his thoughts on this\r\ninstitution, who did not consider it as dishonorable and destructive\r\nto our governments; and that every writing which has come out since\r\nmy arrival here, in which it is mentioned, considers it, even as now\r\nreformed, as the germ whose developement is one day to destroy the\r\nfabric we have reared. I did not apprehend this, while I had American\r\nideas only. But I confess that what I have seen in Europe, has brought\r\nme over to that opinion; and that though the day may be at some\r\ndistance, beyond the reach of our lives perhaps, yet it will certainly\r\ncome, when a single fibre left of this institution will produce an\r\nhereditary aristocracy, which will change the form of our governments\r\nfrom the best to the worst in the world. To know the mass of evil which\r\nflows from this fatal source, a person must be in France; he must see\r\nthe finest soil, the finest climate, the most compact state, the most\r\nbenevolent character of people, and every earthly advantage combined,\r\ninsufficient to prevent this scourge from rendering existence a curse to\r\ntwenty-four out of twenty-five parts of the inhabitants of this country.\r\nWith us, the branches of this institution cover all the states. The\r\nsouthern ones, at this time, are aristocratical in their dispositions:\r\nand that that spirit should grow and extend itself, is within the\r\nnatural order of things. I do not flatter myself with the immortality\r\nof our governments: but I shall think little also of their longevity,\r\nunless this germ of destruction be taken out. When the society\r\nthemselves shall weigh the possibility of evil, against the\r\nimpossibility of any good to proceed from this institution, I cannot\r\nhelp hoping they will eradicate it. I know they wish the permanence of\r\nour governments, as much as any individuals composing them.\r\n\r\nAn interruption here, and the departure of the gentleman by whom I send\r\nthis, oblige me to conclude it with assurances of the sincere respect\r\nand esteem, with which I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.--TO JAMES MADISON, December 16, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, December 16, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAfter a very long silence, I am at length able to write to you. An\r\nunlucky dislocation of my right wrist has disabled me from using that\r\nhand, three months. I now begin to use it a little, but with great pain;\r\nso that this letter must be taken up at such intervals as the state of\r\nmy hand will permit, and will probably be the work of some days. Though\r\nthe joint seems to be well set, the swelling does not abate, nor the use\r\nof it return. I am now, therefore, on the point of setting out, to\r\nthe south of France, to try the use of some mineral waters there, by\r\nimmersion. This journey will be of two or three months.\r\n\r\nI enclose you herein a copy of the letter from the minister of finance\r\nto me, making several advantageous regulations for our commerce. The\r\nobtaining this has occupied us a twelvemonth. I say us, because I find\r\nthe Marquis de la Fayette so useful an auxiliary, that acknowledgements\r\nfor his co-operation are always due. There remains still something to do\r\nfor the articles of rice, turpentine, and ship duties. What can be done\r\nfor tobacco when the late regulation expires, is very uncertain. The\r\ncommerce between the United States and this country being put on a good\r\nfooting, we may afterwards proceed to try if any thing can be done to\r\nfavor our intercourse with her colonies. Admission into them for our\r\nfish and flour, is very desirable: but, unfortunately, both those\r\narticles would raise a competition against their own.\r\n\r\nI find by the public papers, that your commercial convention failed in\r\npoint of representation. If it should produce a full meeting in May, and\r\na broader reformation, it will still be well. To make us one nation as\r\nto foreign concerns, and keep us distinct in domestic ones, gives\r\nthe outline of the proper division of powers between the general and\r\nparticular governments. But to enable the federal head to exercise\r\nthe powers given it, to best advantage, it should be organized, as the\r\nparticular ones are, into legislative, executive, and judiciary. The\r\nfirst and last are already separated. The second should be. When last\r\nwith Congress, I often proposed to members to do this, by making of\r\nthe committee of the States an executive committee during the recess of\r\nCongress, and during its sessions to appoint a committee to receive and\r\ndespatch all executive business, so that Congress itself should meddle\r\nonly with what should be legislative. But I question if any Congress\r\n(much less all successively) can have self-denial enough to go, through\r\nwith this distribution. The distribution, then, should be imposed\r\non them. I find Congress have reversed their division of the western\r\nStates, and proposed to make them fewer and larger. This is reversing\r\nthe natural order of things. A tractable people may be governed in large\r\nbodies: but in proportion as they depart from this character, the extent\r\nof their government must be less. We see into what small divisions the\r\nIndians are obliged to reduce their societies. This measure, with the\r\ndisposition to shut up the Mississippi, gives me serious apprehensions\r\nof the severance of the eastern and western parts of our confederacy. It\r\nmight have been made the interest of the western States to remain united\r\nwith us, by managing their interests honestly, and for their own good.\r\nBut the moment we sacrifice their interests to our own, they will see\r\nit better to govern themselves. The moment they resolve to do this,\r\nthe point is settled. A forced connection is neither our interest,\r\nnor within our power. The Virginia act for religious freedom has been\r\nreceived with infinite approbation in Europe, and propagated with\r\nenthusiasm. I do not mean by the governments, but by the individuals who\r\ncompose them. It has been translated into French and Italian, has been\r\nsent to most of the courts of Europe, and has been the best evidence of\r\nthe falsehood of those reports, which stated us to be in anarchy. It\r\nis inserted in the new _Encyclopédie_, and is appearing in most of the\r\npublications respecting America. In fact, it is comfortable to see the\r\nstandard of reason at length erected, after so many ages, during which\r\nthe human mind has been held in vassalage by kings, priests, and nobles:\r\nand it is honorable for us to have produced the first legislature who\r\nhad the courage to declare, that the reason of man may be trusted with\r\nthe formation of his own opinions.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI thank you for your communications in Natural History. The several\r\ninstances of trees, &c. found far below the surface of the earth, as in\r\nthe case of Mr. Hay’s well, seem to set the reason of man at defiance.\r\n\r\nI am, Dear Sir, with sincere esteem, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.--TO CHARLES THOMSON, December 17,1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.\r\n\r\nParis, December 17,1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA dislocation of my right wrist has for three months past disabled me\r\nfrom writing, except with my left hand, which was too slow and awkward\r\nto be employed often. I begin to have so much use of my wrist as to be\r\nable to write, but it is slowly, and in pain. I take the first moment\r\nI can, however, to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of April the\r\n6th, July the 8th and 30th. In one of these, you say you have not\r\nbeen able to learn, whether, in the new mills in London, steam is the\r\nimmediate mover of the machinery, or raises water to move it. It is the\r\nimmediate mover. The power of this agent, though long known, is but\r\nnow beginning to be applied to the various purposes of which it is\r\nsusceptible. You observe, that Whitehurst supposes it to have been the\r\nagent, which bursting the earth, threw it up into mountains and vallies.\r\nYou ask me what I think of this book. I find in it many interesting\r\nfacts brought together, and many ingenious commentaries on them. But\r\nthere are great chasms in his facts, and consequently in his reasoning,\r\nThese he fills up by suppositions, which may be as reasonably denied\r\nas granted. A sceptical reader, therefore, like myself, is left in the\r\nlurch. I acknowledge, however, he makes more use of fact, than any other\r\nwriter on a theory of the earth. But I give one answer to all these\r\ntheorists. That is as follows. They all suppose the earth a created\r\nexistence. They must suppose a creator then; and that he possessed\r\npower and wisdom to a great degree. As he intended the earth for the\r\nhabitation of animals and vegetables, is it reasonable to suppose, he\r\nmade two jobs of his creation, that he first made a chaotic lump,\r\nand set it into rotatory motion, and then waited the millions of ages\r\nnecessary to form itself? That when it had done this, he stepped in a\r\nsecond time, to create the animals and plants which were to inhabit it?\r\nAs the hand of a creator is to be called in, it may as well be called\r\nin at one stage of the process as another. We may as well suppose he\r\ncreated the earth at once, nearly in the state in which we see it, fit\r\nfor the preservation of the beings he placed on it. But it is said, we\r\nhave a proof that he did not create it in its present solid form, but in\r\na state of fluidity: because its present shape of an oblate spheroid is\r\nprecisely that, which a fluid mass revolving on its axis would assume.\r\n\r\nI suppose, that the same equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal\r\nforce, which would determine a fluid mass into the form of an oblate\r\nspheroid, would determine the wise creator of that mass, if he made it\r\nin a solid state, to give it the same spheroidical form. A revolving\r\nfluid will continue to change its shape, till it attains that in which\r\nits principles of contrary motion are balanced. For if you suppose them\r\nnot balanced, it will change its form. Now the same balanced form\r\nis necessary for the preservation of a revolving solid. The creator,\r\ntherefore, of a revolving solid, would make it an oblate spheroid, that\r\nfigure alone admitting a perfect equilibrium. He would make it in that\r\nform, for another reason; that is, to prevent a shifting of the axis of\r\nrotation. Had he created the earth perfectly spherical, its axis might\r\nhave been perpetually shifting, by the influence of the other bodies\r\nof the system; and by placing the inhabitants of the earth successively\r\nunder its poles, it might have been depopulated; whereas, being\r\nspheroidical, it has but one axis on which it can revolve in equilibrio.\r\nSuppose the axis of the earth to shift forty-five degrees; then cut it\r\ninto one hundred and eighty slices, making every section in the plane\r\nof a circle of latitude, perpendicular to the axis: every one of these\r\nslices, except the equatorial one, would be unbalanced, as there would\r\nbe more matter on one side of its axis than on the other. There could be\r\nbut one diameter drawn through such a slice, which would divide it into\r\ntwo equal parts. On every other possible diameter, the parts would hang\r\nunequal. This would produce an irregularity in the diurnal rotation.\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude it impossible for the poles of the earth\r\nto shift, if it was made spheroidical; and that it would be made\r\nspheroidical, though solid, to obtain this end. I use this reasoning\r\nonly on the supposition, that the earth has had a beginning. I am sure I\r\nshall read your conjectures on this subject with great pleasure, though\r\nI bespeak beforehand, a right to indulge my natural incredulity and\r\nscepticism. The pain in which I write, awakens me here from my reverie,\r\nand obliges me to conclude with compliments to Mrs. Thomson, and\r\nassurances to yourself of the esteem and affection with which I am\r\nsincerely, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the preceding, I have had a conversation on the\r\nsubject of the steam-mills, with the famous Boulton, to whom those of\r\nLondon belong, and who is here at this time. He compares the effect of\r\nsteam with that of horses, in the following manner. Six horses, aided\r\nwith the most advantageous combination of the mechanical powers hitherto\r\ntried, will grind six bushels of flour in an hour; at the end of which\r\ntime they are all in a foam, and must rest. They can work thus six hours\r\nin the twenty-four, grinding thirty-six bushels of flour, which is\r\nsix to each horse, for the twenty-four hours. His steam-mill in London\r\nconsumes one hundred and twenty bushels of coal in twenty-four hours,\r\nturns ten pair of stones, which grind eight bushels of flour an hour\r\neach, which is nineteen hundred and twenty bushels in the twenty-four\r\nhours. This makes a peck and a half of coal perform exactly as much as a\r\nhorse in one day can perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, December 18, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, December 18, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letters of August the 19th and October the 12th have come duly to\r\nhand. My last to you was of the 11th of August. Soon after that date I\r\ngot my right wrist dislocated, which has till now deprived me of the use\r\nof that hand; and even now I can use it but slowly, and with pain. The\r\nrevisal of the Congressional intelligence contained in your letters,\r\nmakes me regret the loss of it on your departure. I feel, too, the\r\nwant of a person there to whose discretion I can trust confidential\r\ncommunications, and on whose friendship I can rely against the unjust\r\ndesigns of malevolence. I have no reason to suppose I have enemies in\r\nCongress; yet it is too possible, to be without that fear. Some\r\nsymptoms make me suspect, that my proceedings to redress the abusive\r\nadministration of tobacco by the Farmers General have indisposed towards\r\nme a powerful person in Philadelphia, who was profiting from that abuse.\r\nAn expression in the enclosed letter of M. de Calonne, would seem to\r\nimply, that I had asked the abolition of Mr. Morris’s contract. I never\r\ndid. On the contrary, I always observed to them, that it would be unjust\r\nto annul that contract. I was led to this, by principles both of justice\r\nand interest. Of interest, because that contract would keep up the price\r\nof tobacco here to thirty-four, thirty-six, and thirty-eight livres,\r\nfrom which it will fall when it shall no longer have that support.\r\nHowever, I have done what was right, and I will not so far wound my\r\nprivilege of doing that, without regard to any man’s interest, as to\r\nenter into any explanations of this paragraph with him. Yet I esteem him\r\nhighly, and suppose that hitherto he had esteemed me. You will see by\r\nCalonne’s letter, that we are doing what we can to get the trade of the\r\nUnited States put on a good footing. I am now about setting out on\r\na journey to the south of France, one object of which is to try the\r\nmineral waters there for the restoration of my hand; but another is,\r\nto visit all the seaports where we have trade, and to hunt up all the\r\ninconveniences under which it labors, in order to get them rectified.\r\nI shall visit, and carefully examine too, the canal of Languedoc. On\r\nmy return, which will be early in the spring, I shall send you several\r\n_livraisons_ of the _Encyclopédie_, and the plan of your house. I wish\r\nto Heaven, you may continue in the disposition to fix it in Albemarle.\r\nShort will establish himself there, and perhaps Madison may be tempted\r\nto do so. This will be society enough, and it will be the great\r\nsweetener of our lives. Without society, and a society to our taste,\r\nmen are never contented. The one here supposed, we can regulate to our\r\nminds, and we may extend our regulations to the sumptuary department,\r\nso as to set a good example to a country which needs it, and to preserve\r\nour own happiness clear of embarrassment. You wish not to engage in the\r\ndrudgery of the bar. You have two asylums from that. Either to accept\r\na seat in the Council, or in the judiciary department. The latter,\r\nhowever, would require a little previous drudgery at the bar, to qualify\r\nyou to discharge your duty with satisfaction to yourself. Neither of\r\nthese would be inconsistent with a continued residence in Albemarle. It\r\nis but twelve hours drive in a sulky from Charlottesville to Richmond,\r\nkeeping a fresh horse always at the half-way, which would be a small\r\nannual expense. I am in hopes, that Mrs. M. will have in her domestic\r\ncares occupation and pleasure sufficient to fill her time, and insure\r\nher against the _tedium vitæ_: that she will find, that the distractions\r\nof a town, and the waste of life under these, can bear no comparison\r\nwith the tranquil happiness of domestic life. If her own experience has\r\nnot yet taught her this truth, she has in its favor the testimony of\r\none, who has gone through the various scenes of business, of bustle, of\r\noffice, of rambling, and of quiet retirement, and who can assure her,\r\nthat the latter is the only point upon which the mind can settle at\r\nrest. Though not clear of inquietudes, because no earthly situation\r\nis so, they are fewer in number, and mixed with more objects of\r\ncontentment, than in any other mode of life. But I must not philosophize\r\ntoo much with her, lest I give her too serious apprehensions of a\r\nfriendship I shall impose on her. I am with very great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\nyour sincere friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXV.--TO MR. CARMICHAEL, December 26,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, December 26,1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA note from me of the 22nd of September apprized you it would be some\r\ntime before I should be able to answer your letters. I did not then\r\nexpect it would have been so long.\r\n\r\nI enclose herein a resolution of Congress recalling Mr. Lambe, which I\r\nwill beg the favor of you to have delivered him. I have written to Mr.\r\nAdams on the subject of directing him to settle with Mr. Barclay, and\r\nattend his answer. In the mean time, I am not without hopes Mr. Barclay\r\nhas done the business. I send also a note desiring Mr. Lambe to deliver\r\nyou his cipher: and a copy of a letter from the minister of finance here\r\nto me, announcing several regulations in favor of our commerce.\r\n\r\nMy Notes on Virginia, having been hastily written, need abundance of\r\ncorrections. Two or three of these are so material, that I am reprinting\r\na few leaves to substitute for the old. As soon as these shall be ready,\r\nI will beg your acceptance of a copy. I shall be proud to be permitted\r\nto send a copy also to the Count de Campomanes, as a tribute to his\r\nscience and his virtues. You will find in them, that the Natural Bridge\r\nhas found an admirer in me also. I should be happy to make with you the\r\ntour of the curiosities you will find therein mentioned. That kind of\r\npleasure surpasses much, in my estimation, whatever I find on this side\r\nthe Atlantic. I sometimes think of building a little hermitage at the\r\nNatural Bridge (for it is my property), and of passing there a part of\r\nthe year at least.\r\n\r\nI have received American papers to the 1st of November. Some tumultuous\r\nmeetings of the people have taken place in the eastern States; i.e. one\r\nin Massachusetts, one in Connecticut, and one in New Hampshire. Their\r\nprincipal demand was a respite in the judiciary proceedings. No injury\r\nwas done, however, in a single instance, to the person or property\r\nof any one, nor did the tumult continue twenty-four hours in any one\r\ninstance. In Massachusetts this was owing to the discretion which the\r\nmalcontents still preserved; in Connecticut and New Hampshire the body\r\nof the people rose in support of government, and obliged the malcontents\r\nto go to their homes. In the last mentioned State they seized about\r\nforty, who were in jail for trial. It is believed this incident will\r\nstrengthen our government. Those people are not entirely without excuse.\r\nBefore the war these States depended on their whale-oil and fish.\r\nThe former was consumed in England, and much of the latter in the\r\nMediterranean. The heavy duties on American whale-oil, now required in\r\nEngland, exclude it from that market: and the Algerines exclude them\r\nfrom bringing their fish into the Mediterranean. France is opening\r\nher ports for their oil, but in the mean while their ancient debts are\r\npressing them, and they have nothing to pay with. The Massachusetts\r\nAssembly, too, in their zeal for paying their public debt, had laid\r\na tax too heavy to be paid, in the circumstances of their State. The\r\nIndians seem disposed, too, to make war on us. These complicated causes\r\ndetermined Congress to increase their forces to two thousand men. The\r\nlatter was the sole object avowed, yet the former entered for something\r\ninto the measure. However, I am satisfied the good sense of the people\r\nis the strongest army our governments can ever have, and that it will\r\nnot fail them. The commercial convention at Annapolis was not full\r\nenough to do business. They found, too, their appointments too narrow,\r\nbeing confined to the article of commerce. They have proposed a meeting\r\nat Philadelphia in May, and that it may be authorized to propose\r\namendments of whatever is defective in the federal constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in England, I formed a portable copying press, on the\r\nprinciples of the large one they make there, for copying letters. I had\r\na model made there, and it has answered perfectly. A workman here has\r\nmade several from that model. The itinerant temper of your court will, I\r\nthink, render one of these useful to you. You must, therefore, do me the\r\nfavor to accept of one. I have it now in readiness, and shall send it\r\nby the way of Bayonne, to the care of Mr. Alexander there, unless Don\r\nMiguel de Lardi-zabal can carry it with him.\r\n\r\nMy hand admonishes me it is time to stop, and that I must defer writing\r\nto Mr. Barclay till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVI.--TO MR. VAUGHAN, December 29, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nParis, December 29, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWhen I had the honor of seeing you in London, you were so kind as to\r\npermit me to trouble you, sometimes with my letters, and particularly\r\non the subject of mathematical or philosophical instruments. Such a\r\ncorrespondence will be too agreeable to me, and at the same time too\r\nuseful, not to avail myself of your permission. It has been an opinion\r\npretty generally received among philosophers, that the atmosphere of\r\nAmerica is more humid than that of Europe. Monsieur de Buffon makes this\r\nhypothesis one of the two pillars whereon he builds his system of the\r\ndegeneracy of animals in America. Having had occasion to controvert this\r\nopinion of his, as to the degeneracy of animals there, I expressed a\r\ndoubt of the fact assumed, that our climates are more moist. I did not\r\nknow of any experiments, which might authorize a denial of it. Speaking\r\nafterwards on the subject with Dr. Franklin, he mentioned to me the\r\nobservations he had made on a case of magnets, made for him by Mr.\r\nNairne in London. Of these you will see a detail in the second volume of\r\nthe American Philosophical Transactions, in a letter from Dr. Franklin\r\nto Mr. Nairne, wherein he recommends to him to take up the principle\r\ntherein explained, and endeavor to make an hygrometer, which, taking\r\nslowly the temperature of the atmosphere, shall give its mean degree of\r\nmoisture, and enable us thus to make with more certainty a comparison\r\nbetween the humidities of different climates. May I presume to trouble\r\nyou with an inquiry of Mr. Nairne, whether he has executed the\r\nDoctor’s idea; and if he has, to get him to make for me a couple of\r\nthe instruments he may have contrived. They should be made of the same\r\npiece, and under like circumstances, that sending one to America, I may\r\nrely on its indications there, compared with those of the one I shall\r\nretain here. Being in want of a set of magnets also, I would be glad\r\nif he would at the same time send me a set, the case of which should be\r\nmade as Dr. Franklin describes his to have been, so that I may repeat\r\nhis experiment. Colonel Smith will do me the favor to receive these\r\nthings from Mr. Nairne, and to pay him for them.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Rittenhouse never published an invention of his in this\r\nway, which was a very good one. It was of an hygrometer, which, like\r\nthe common ones, was to give the actual moisture of the air. He has\r\ntwo slips of mahogany about five inches long, three fourths of an inch\r\nbroad, and one tenth of an inch thick, the one having the grain running\r\nlengthwise, and the other crosswise. These are glued together by their\r\nfaces, so as to form a piece five inches long, three fourths of an inch\r\nbroad, and one third of an inch thick, which is stuck by its lower end\r\ninto a little plinth of wood, presenting their edge to the view. The\r\nfibres of the wood you know are dilated, but not lengthened by moisture.\r\nThe slip, therefore, whose grain is lengthwise, becomes a standard,\r\nretaining always the same precise length. That which has its grain\r\ncrosswise, dilates with moisture, and contracts for the want of it.\r\nIf the right hand piece be the cross-grained one, when the air is very\r\nmoist, it lengthens, and forces its companion to form a kind of interior\r\nannulus of a circle on the left. When the air is dry, it contracts,\r\ndraws its companion to the right, and becomes itself the interior\r\nannulus. In order to show this dilation and contraction, an index is\r\nfixed on the upper end of the two slips; a plate of metal or wood is\r\nfastened to the front of the plinth, so as to cover the two slips from\r\nthe eye. A slit, being nearly the portion of a circle, is cut in this\r\nplate, so that the shank of the index may play freely through its whole\r\nrange. On the edge of the slit is a graduation. The objection to this\r\ninstrument is, that it is not fit for comparative observations, because\r\nno two pieces of wood being of the same texture exactly, no two will\r\nyield exactly alike to the same agent. However, it is less objectionable\r\non this account, than most of the substances used. Mr. Rittenhouse had\r\na thought of trying ivory: but I do not know whether he executed it. All\r\nthese substances not only vary from one another at the same time, but\r\nfrom themselves at different times. All of them, however, have some\r\npeculiar advantages, and I think this, on the whole, appeared preferable\r\nto any other I had ever seen. Not knowing whether you had heard of this\r\ninstrument, and supposing it would amuse you, I have taken the liberty\r\nof detailing it to you.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured of the sentiments of perfect esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVII.--TO JOHN JAY, December 31, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, December 31, 1786\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you on the 12th of the last month; since\r\nwhich your favor of October the 12th has been received, enclosing a copy\r\nof the resolution of Congress for recalling Mr. Lambe. My letter by Mr.\r\nRandall informed you, that we had put an end to his powers, and required\r\nhim to repair to Congress. I lately received a letter from him, dated\r\nAlicant, October the 10th, of which I have the honor to enclose you a\r\ncopy: by which you will perceive, that the circumstance of ill health,\r\neither true or false, is urged for his not obeying our call. I shall\r\nimmediately forward the order of Congress. I am not without fear, that\r\nsome misapplication of the public money may enter into the causes of\r\nhis declining to return. The moment that I saw a symptom of this in\r\nhis conduct, as it was a circumstance which did not admit the delay\r\nof consulting Mr. Adams, I wrote to Mr. Carmichael, to stop any monies\r\nwhich he might have in the hands of his banker. I am still unable to\r\njudge whether he is guilty of this or not, as by the arrangements with\r\nMr. Adams, who alone had done business with the bankers of the United\r\nStates, in Holland, Mr. Lambe’s drafts were to be made on him, and\r\nI know not what their amount has been. His drafts could not have been\r\nnegotiated, if made on us both, at places so distant. Perhaps it may be\r\nthought, that the appointment of Mr. Lambe was censurable in the moment\r\nin which it was made. It is a piece of justice, therefore, which I owe\r\nto Mr. Adams, to declare that the proposition went first from me to him.\r\nI take the liberty of enclosing you a copy of my letter to Mr. Adams,\r\nof September the 24th, 1785, in which that proposition was made. It\r\nexpresses the motives operating on my mind in that moment, as well as\r\nthe cautions I thought it necessary to take. To these must be added the\r\ndifficulty of finding an American in Europe fit for the business, and\r\nwilling to undertake it. I knew afterwards, that Dr. Bancroft (who is\r\nnamed in the letter) could not, on account of his own affairs, have\r\naccepted even a primary appointment. I think it evident, that no\r\nappointment could have succeeded without a much greater sum of money.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find that Mr. Barclay’s mission has been attended with\r\ncomplete success. For this we are indebted, unquestionably, to the\r\ninfluence and good offices of the court of Madrid. Colonel Franks, the\r\nbearer of this, will have the honor to put into your hands the original\r\nof the treaty, with other papers accompanying it. It will appear\r\nby these, that Mr. Barclay has conducted himself with a degree of\r\nintelligence and of good faith which reflects the highest honor on him.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter from Captain O’Bryan to Mr. Carmichael is also\r\nherewith enclosed. The information it contains will throw farther light\r\non the affairs of Algiers. His observations on the difficulties which\r\narise from the distance of Mr. Adams and myself from that place, and\r\nfrom one another, and the delays occasioned by this circumstance, are\r\ncertainly just. If Congress should propose to revive the negotiations,\r\nthey will judge whether it will not be more expedient to send a person\r\nto Algiers, who can be trusted with full powers: and also whether a\r\nmission to Constantinople may not be previously necessary. Before I quit\r\nthis subject, I must correct an error in the letter of Captain O’Bryan.\r\nMr. Lambe was not limited, as he says, to one hundred, but to two\r\nhundred dollars apiece for our prisoners. This was the price which had\r\nbeen just paid for a large number of French prisoners, and this was our\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVIII.--TO SAMUEL OSGOOD, January 5, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL OSGOOD.\r\n\r\nParis, January 5, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am desired to forward to you the enclosed queries, and to ask the\r\nfavor of you to give such an answer to them, as may not give you too\r\nmuch trouble. Those which stand foremost on the paper, can be addressed\r\nonly to your complaisance; but the last may possibly be interesting to\r\nyour department, and to the United States. I mean those which suggest\r\nthe possibility of borrowing money in Europe, the principal of which\r\nshall be ultimately payable in land, and in the mean time, a good\r\ninterest. You know best whether the suggestion can be turned to any\r\nprofit, and whether it will be worth while to introduce any proposition\r\nto Congress thereon. Among the possible shapes into which a matter of\r\nthis kind may be formed, the following is one. Let us suppose the public\r\nlands to be worth a dollar, hard money, the acre. If we should ask of a\r\nmonied man a loan of one hundred dollars, payable with one hundred\r\nacres of land at the end of ten years, and in the mean time, carrying\r\nan interest of five per cent., this would be more disadvantageous to the\r\nlender than a common loan, payable ultimately in cash. But if we should\r\nsay, we will deliver you the one hundred acres of land immediately,\r\nwhich is in fact an immediate payment of the principal, and will\r\nnevertheless pay your interest of five per cent., for ten years, this\r\noffers a superior advantage, and might tempt money-holders. But what\r\nshould we in fact receive, in this way, for our lands? Thirty-seven\r\ndollars and one fourth, being left in Europe, on an interest of five per\r\ncent., would pay annually the interest of the one hundred dollars for\r\nten years. There would remain then only sixty-two dollars and three\r\nquarters, for the one hundred acres of land; that is to say, about\r\ntwo thirds of its price. Congress can best determine, whether any\r\ncircumstances in our situation, should induce us to get rid of any of\r\nour debts in that way. I beg you to understand, that I have named rates\r\nof interest, term of payment and price of land, merely to state the\r\ncase, and without the least knowledge that a loan could be obtained on\r\nthese terms. It remains to inform you, from whom this suggestion comes.\r\nThe person from whom I receive it, is a Monsieur Claviere, connected\r\nwith the monied men of Amsterdam. He is, on behalf of a company there,\r\nactually treating with the Comptroller General here, for the purchase of\r\nour debt to this country, at a considerable discount. Whether he has an\r\nidea of offering a loan to us, on terms such as I have above spoken of,\r\nI know not; nor do I know that he is authorized to make the suggestion\r\nhe has made. If the thing should be deemed worthy the attention of\r\nCongress, they can only consider it as a possibility, and take measures\r\nto avail themselves of it, if the possibility turns out in their favor,\r\nand not to be disappointed if it does not. Claviere’s proposition not\r\nbeing formal enough for me to make an official communication of it, you\r\nwill make what use of it you see best.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIX.--TO JOHN JAY, January 9, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, January 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last, of December the 31st, acknowledged the receipt of yours of\r\nOctober the 12th, as the present does those of October the 3rd, 9th, and\r\n27th, together with the resolution of Congress of October the 16th,\r\non the claim of Schweighaeuser. I will proceed in this business on\r\nthe return of Mr. Barclay, who being fully acquainted with all the\r\ncircumstances, will be enabled to give me that information, the want of\r\nwhich might lead me to do wrong on the one side or the other.\r\n\r\nInformation of the signature of the treaty with Morocco has been long on\r\nits passage to you. I will beg leave to recur to dates, that you may see\r\nthat no part of it has been derived from me. The first notice I had\r\nof it, was in a letter from Mr. Barclay, dated, Daralbeyda, August the\r\n11th. I received this on the 13th of September. No secure conveyance\r\noffered till the 26th of the same month, being thirteen days after\r\nmy receipt of it. In my letter of that date, which went by the way of\r\nLondon, I had the honor to enclose you a copy of Mr. Barclay’s letter.\r\nThe conveyance of the treaty itself is suffering a delay here at\r\npresent, which all my anxiety cannot prevent. Colonel Franks’ baggage,\r\nwhich came by water from Cadiz to Rouen, has been long and hourly\r\nexpected. The moment it arrives, he will set out to London, to have\r\nduplicates of the treaty signed by Mr. Adams, and from thence he will\r\nproceed to New York.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier del Pinto, who treated with us on behalf of Portugal,\r\nbeing resident at London, I have presumed that causes of the delay of\r\nthat treaty had been made known to Mr. Adams, and by him communicated\r\nto you. I will write to him by Colonel Franks, in order that you may be\r\nanswered on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the enclosed extract from my letter of May the 27th,\r\n1786, will, I fear, have very mischievous effects. It will tend to\r\ndraw on the Count de Vergennes the formidable phalanx of the Farms; to\r\nprevent his committing himself to me in any conversation which he does\r\nnot mean for the public papers; to inspire the same diffidence into all\r\nother ministers, with whom I might have to transact business; to defeat\r\nthe little hope, if any hope existed, of getting rid of the Farm on the\r\narticle of tobacco; and to damp that freedom of, communication which\r\nthe resolution of Congress of May the 3rd, 1784, was intended to\r\nre-establish. Observing by the proceedings of Congress, that they are\r\nabout to establish a coinage, I think it my duty to inform them, that a\r\nSwiss, of the name of Drost, established here, has invented a method of\r\nstriking the two faces and the edge of a coin, at one stroke. By this,\r\nand other simplifications of the process of coinage, he is enabled to\r\ncoin from twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand pieces a day, with\r\nthe assistance of only two persons, the pieces of metal being first\r\nprepared. I send you by Colonel Franks three coins of gold, silver, and\r\ncopper, which you will perceive to be perfect medals: and I can assure\r\nyou, from having seen him coin many, that every piece is as perfect as\r\nthese. There has certainly never yet been seen any coin, in any country,\r\ncomparable to this. The best workmen in this way acknowledge that his\r\nis like a new art. Coin should always be made in the highest perfection\r\npossible, because it is a great guard against the danger of false\r\ncoinage. This man would be willing to furnish his implements to\r\nCongress, and if they please, he will go over and instruct a person to\r\ncarry on the work: nor do I believe he would ask any thing unreasonable.\r\nIt would be very desirable, that in the institution of a new coinage,\r\nwe could set out on so perfect a plan as this, and the more so, as while\r\nthe work is so exquisitely done, it is done cheaper.\r\n\r\nI will certainly do the best I can for the reformation of the consular\r\nconvention, being persuaded that our States would be very unwilling to\r\nconform their laws either to the convention, or to the scheme. But it\r\nis too difficult and too delicate, to form sanguine hopes. However, that\r\nthere may be room to reduce the convention, as much as circumstances\r\nwill admit, will it not be expedient for Congress to give me powers,\r\nin which there shall be no reference to the scheme? The powers sent\r\nme, oblige me to produce that scheme, and certainly, the moment it is\r\nproduced, they will not abate a tittle from it. If they recollect the\r\nscheme, and insist on it, we can but conclude it; but if they have\r\nforgotten it (which may be), and are willing to reconsider the whole\r\nsubject, perhaps we may get rid of something the more of it. As the\r\ndelay is not injurious to us, because the convention, whenever and\r\nhowever made, is to put us in a worse state than we are in now, I shall\r\nventure to defer saying a word on the subject, till I can hear from\r\nyou in answer to this. The full powers may be sufficiently guarded, by\r\nprivate instructions to me, not to go beyond the former scheme. This\r\ndelay may be well enough ascribed (whenever I shall have received new\r\npowers) to a journey, I had before apprized the minister that I should\r\nbe obliged to take, to some mineral waters in the south of France, to\r\nsee if by their aid I may recover the use of my right hand, of which a\r\ndislocation about four months ago, threatens to deprive me in a great\r\nmeasure. The surgeons have long insisted on this measure. I shall return\r\nby Bordeaux, Nantes, and L’Orient, to get the necessary information for\r\nfinishing our commercial regulations here. Permit me, however, to ask,\r\nas immediately as possible, an answer, either affirmative or negative,\r\nas Congress shall think best, and to ascribe the delay on which I\r\nventure, to my desire to do what is for the best.\r\n\r\nI send you a copy of the late marine regulations of this country. There\r\nare things in it, which may become interesting to us. Particularly,\r\nwhat relates to the establishment of a marine militia, and their\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the public papers, that the King has called an\r\nAssembly of the Notables of this country. This has not been done for one\r\nhundred and sixty years past. Of course, it calls up all the attention\r\nof the people. The objects of this Assembly are not named: several are\r\nconjectured. The tolerating the Protestant religion; removing all the\r\ninternal Custom-houses to the frontier; equalizing the _gabelles_ on\r\nsalt through the kingdom; the sale of the King’s domains, to raise\r\nmoney; or, finally, the effecting this necessary end by some other\r\nmeans, are talked of. But, in truth, nothing is known about it. This\r\ngovernment practises secrecy so systematically, that it never publishes\r\nits purposes or its proceedings, sooner or more extensively than\r\nnecessary. I send you a pamphlet, which, giving an account of the last\r\n_Assemblée des Notable_, may give an idea of what the present will be.\r\n\r\nA great desire prevails here of encouraging manufactures. The famous\r\nBoulton and Watt, who are at the head of the plated manufactures\r\nof Birmingham, the steam mills of London, copying presses and other\r\nmechanical works, have been here. It is said, also, that Wedgewood has\r\nbeen here, who is famous for his steel manufactories, and an earthen\r\nware in the antique style; but as to this last person, I am not certain.\r\nIt cannot, I believe be doubted, but that they came at the request\r\nof government, and that they will be induced to establish similar\r\nmanufactures here.\r\n\r\nThe transferring hither those manufactures, which contribute so much to\r\ndraw our commerce to England, will have a great tendency to strengthen\r\nour connections with this country, and loosen them with that.\r\n\r\nThe enfranchising the port of Honfleur at the mouth of the Seine, for\r\nmultiplying the connections with us, is at present an object. It meets\r\nwith opposition in the ministry; but I am in hopes it will prevail.\r\nIf natural causes operate, uninfluenced by accidental circumstances,\r\nBordeaux and Honfleur, or Havre, must ultimately take the greatest part\r\nof our commerce. The former, by the Garonne and canal of Languedoc,\r\nopens the southern provinces to us; the latter, the northern ones and\r\nParis. Honfleur will be peculiarly advantageous for our rice and whale\r\noil, of which the principal consumption is at Paris. Being free, they\r\ncan be re-exported when the market here shall happen to be overstocked.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the ensuing summer will close the eastern half of the\r\nharbor of Cherbourg, which will contain and protect forty sail of the\r\nline. It has from fifty to thirty-five feet of water next to the\r\ncones, shallowing gradually to the shore. Between this and Dunkirk, the\r\nnavigation of the channel will be rendered much safer in the event of a\r\nwar with England, and invasions on that country become more practicable.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France and Leyden, to the present date, accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XL.--TO JOHN ADAMS, January 11, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, January 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Jay, in his last letter to me, observes they hear nothing further of\r\nthe treaty with Portugal. I have taken the liberty of telling him that\r\nI will write to you on the subject, and that he may expect to hear from\r\nyou on it, by the present conveyance. The Chevalier del Pinto being at\r\nLondon, I presume he has, or can inform you why it is delayed on their\r\npart. I will thank you also for the information he shall give you.\r\n\r\nThere is here an order of priests called the Mathurins, the object\r\nof whose institution is, the begging of alms for the redemption of\r\ncaptives. About eighteen months ago, they redeemed three hundred,\r\nwhich cost them about fifteen hundred livres a piece. They have agents\r\nresiding in the Barbary States, who are constantly employed in searching\r\nand contracting for the captives of their nation, and they redeem at\r\na lower price than any other people can. It occurred to me, that\r\ntheir agency might be engaged for our prisoners at Algiers. I have had\r\ninterviews with them, and the last night a long one with the General\r\nof the order. They offer their services with all the benignity and\r\ncordiality possible. The General told me, he could not expect to redeem\r\nour prisoners as cheap as their own, but that he would use all the means\r\nin his power to do it on the best terms possible, which will be the\r\nbetter, as there shall be the less suspicion that he acts for our\r\npublic. I told him I would write to you on the subject, and speak to him\r\nagain. What do you think of employing them, limiting them to a certain\r\nprice, as three hundred dollars, for instance, or any other sum you\r\nthink proper? He will write immediately to his instruments there, and\r\nin two or three months we can know the event. He will deliver them\r\nat Marseilles, Cadiz, or where we please, at our expense. The money\r\nremaining of the fund destined to the Barbary business, may, I suppose,\r\nbe drawn on for this object. Write me your opinion, if you please, on\r\nthis subject, finally, fully, and immediately, that, if you approve the\r\nproposition, I may enter into arrangements with the General before my\r\ndeparture to the waters of Aix, which will be about the beginning of\r\nFebruary,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLI.--TO MONSIEUR LE DUC D’HARCOURT, January 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE DUC D’HARCOURT, GOUVERNEUR DU DAUPHIN.\r\n\r\nParis, January 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn the conversation with which you were pleased to honor me a few days\r\nago, on the enfranchisement of the port of Honfleur, I took the liberty\r\nof observing, that I was not instructed by my constituents to make\r\nany proposition on that subject. That it would be agreeable to them,\r\nhowever, I must suppose, because it will offer the following advantages.\r\n\r\n1. It is a convenient _entrepôt_ for furnishing us with the manufactures\r\nof the northern parts of France, and particularly of Paris, and for\r\nreceiving and distributing the productions of our country in exchange.\r\n\r\n2. Cowes, on the opposite side of the channel, has heretofore been the\r\ndeposite for a considerable part of our productions, landed in Great\r\nBritain in the first instance, but intended for re-exportation. From\r\nthence our rice, particularly, has been distributed to France and other\r\nparts of Europe. I am not certain, whether our tobaccos were deposited\r\nthere, or carried to London to be sorted for the different markets.\r\nTo draw this business from Cowes, no place is so favorably situated as\r\nHonfleur.\r\n\r\n3. It would be a convenient deposite for our whale-oil, of which, after\r\nthe supply of Paris, there will be a surplus for re-exportation.\r\n\r\n4. Should our fur-trade be recovered out of the hands of the English, it\r\nwill naturally come to Honfleur, as the out-port of Paris.\r\n\r\n5. Salt is an important article in all our return cargoes; because,\r\nbeing carried as ballast, its freight costs nothing. But on account\r\nof some regulations, with which I am not well acquainted, it cannot at\r\npresent be shipped to advantage from any port on the Seine.\r\n\r\n6. Our vessels being built sharp, for swift sailing, suffer extremely\r\nin most of the western ports of France, in which they are left on dry\r\nground at every ebb of the tide. But at Honfleur, I am told, they can\r\nride in bold water, on a good bottom, and near the shore, at all times.\r\n\r\nThese facts may, perhaps, throw some light on the question in which, for\r\nthe good of both countries, you are pleased to interest yourself. I take\r\nthe liberty, therefore, of barely mentioning them, and with the more\r\npleasure, as it furnishes me an occasion of assuring you of those\r\nsentiments of respect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLII.--TO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-COEUR, January 15,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\nParis, January 15,1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI see by the Journal of this morning, that they are robbing us of\r\nanother of our inventions, to give it to the English. The writer,\r\nindeed, only admits them to have revived what he thinks was known to the\r\nGreeks, that is, the making the circumference of a wheel of one single\r\npiece. The farmers in New Jersey were the first who practised it, and\r\nthey practised it commonly. Dr. Franklin, in one of his trips to London,\r\nmentioned this practice to the man now in London, who has the patent for\r\nmaking those wheels. The idea struck him. The Doctor promised to go to\r\nhis shop, and assist him in trying to make the wheel of one piece. The\r\nJersey farmers do it by cutting a young sapling, and bending it, while\r\ngreen and juicy, into a circle; and leaving it so until it becomes\r\nperfectly seasoned. But in London there are no saplings. The difficulty\r\nwas, then, to give to old wood the pliancy of young. The Doctor and the\r\nworkman labored together some weeks, and succeeded; and the man obtained\r\na patent for it, which has made his fortune. I was in his shop in\r\nLondon; he told me the whole story himself, and acknowledged not only\r\nthe origin of the idea, but how much the assistance of Dr. Franklin had\r\ncontributed to perform the operation on dry wood. He spoke of him\r\nwith love and gratitude. I think I have had a similar account from\r\nDr. Franklin, but cannot be quite certain. I know, that being in\r\nPhiladelphia when the first set of patent wheels arrived from London,\r\nand were spoken of, by the gentleman (an Englishman) who brought them,\r\nas a wonderful discovery, the idea of its being a new discovery was\r\nlaughed at by the Philadelphians, who, in their Sunday parties across\r\nthe Delaware, had seen every farmer’s cart mounted on such wheels.\r\nThe writer in the paper supposes the English workman got his idea from\r\nHomer. But it is more likely the Jersey farmer got his idea from thence,\r\nbecause ours are the only farmers who can read Homer; because, too, the\r\nJersey practice is precisely that stated by Homer: the English practice\r\nvery different. Homer’s words are (comparing a young hero killed by Ajax\r\nto a poplar felled by a workman) literally thus: ‘He fell on the ground,\r\nlike a poplar, which has grown smooth, in the west part of a\r\ngreat meadow; with its branches shooting from its summit. But the\r\nchariot-maker, with his sharp axe, has felled it, that he may bend\r\na wheel for a beautiful chariot. It lies drying on the banks of the\r\nriver.’ Observe the circumstances, which coincide with the Jersey\r\npractice. 1. It is a tree growing in a moist place, full of juices,\r\nand easily bent. 2. It is cut while green. 3. It is bent into the\r\ncircumference of a wheel. 4. It is left to dry in that form. You, who\r\nwrite French well and readily, should write a line for the Journal, to\r\nreclaim the honor of our farmers. Adieu. Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIII.--TO COLONEL EDWARD CARRINGTON, January 16, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL EDWARD CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, January 16, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nUncertain whether you might be at New York at the moment of Colonel\r\nFranks’ arrival, I have enclosed my private letters for Virginia, under\r\ncover to our delegation in general, which, otherwise, I would have taken\r\nthe liberty to enclose particularly to you, as best acquainted with the\r\nsituation of the persons to whom they are addressed. Should this find\r\nyou at New York, I will still ask your attention to them.\r\n\r\nIn my letter to Mr. Jay, I have mentioned the meeting of the Notables,\r\nappointed for the 29th instant. It is now put off to the 7th or 8th\r\nof next month. This event, which will hardly excite any attention in\r\nAmerica, is deemed here the most important one, which has taken place in\r\ntheir civil line during the present century. Some promise their country\r\ngreat things from it, some nothing. Our friend De la Fayette was placed\r\non the list originally. Afterwards his name disappeared; but finally was\r\nreinstated. This shows, that his character here is not considered as\r\nan indifferent one; and that it excites agitation. His education in\r\nour school has drawn on him a very jealous eye, from a court whose\r\nprinciples are the most absolute despotism. But I hope he has nearly\r\npassed his crisis. The King, who is a good man, is favorably disposed\r\ntowards him; and he is supported by powerful family connections, and\r\nby the public good will. He is the youngest man of the Notables, except\r\none, whose office placed him on the list.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Vergennes has, within these ten days, had a very severe\r\nattack of what is deemed an unfixed gout. He has been well enough,\r\nhowever, to do business to-day. But anxieties for him are not yet\r\nquieted. He is a great and good minister, and an accident to him might\r\nendanger the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe tumults in America I expected would have produced in Europe an\r\nunfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the\r\ncontrary, the small effect of these tumults seems to have given more\r\nconfidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the\r\npeople themselves on the side of government, has had a great effect\r\non the opinion here. I am persuaded myself, that the good sense of the\r\npeople will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray\r\nfor a moment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only\r\ncensors of their governors; and even their errors will tend to keep\r\nthese to the true principles of their institution. To punish these\r\nerrors too severely, would be to suppress the only safeguard of the\r\npublic liberty. The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the\r\npeople, is to give them full information of their affairs through the\r\nchannel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should\r\npenetrate the whole mass of the people. The basis of our governments\r\nbeing the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep\r\nthat right; and were it left to me to decide, whether we should have\r\na government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I\r\nshould not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean,\r\nthat every man should receive those papers, and be capable of reading\r\nthem. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians), which live\r\nwithout government, enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater\r\ndegree of happiness, than those who live under the European governments.\r\nAmong the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains\r\nmorals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. Among the latter, under\r\npretence of governing, they have divided their nations into two classes,\r\nwolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe.\r\nCherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep alive their\r\nattention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim them\r\nby enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public\r\naffairs, you, and I, and Congress, and Assemblies, Judges and Governors,\r\nshall all become wolves. It seems to be the law of our general nature,\r\nin spite of individual exceptions: and experience declares, that man is\r\nthe only animal which devours his own kind; for I can apply no milder\r\nterm to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich\r\non the poor. The want of news has led me into disquisition instead of\r\nnarration, forgetting you have every day enough of that. I shall be\r\nhappy to hear from you sometimes, only observing, that whatever passes\r\nthrough the post is read, and that when you write what should be read\r\nby myself only, you must be so good as to confide your letter to some\r\npassenger, or officer of the packet. I will ask your permission to write\r\nto you sometimes, and to assure you of the esteem and respect with which\r\nI have the honor to be,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIV--TO JAMES MADISON, January 30, 1787 *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, January 30, 1787.\r\n\r\n     [* The latter part of this letter is in cipher; but appended\r\n     to the copy preserved, are explanatory notes, which have\r\n     enabled us to publish it entire, except a few words, to\r\n     which they afford no key. These are either marked thus * * *,\r\n     or the words, which the context seemed to require, inserted\r\n     in italics.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 16th of December; since which I have received\r\nyours of November the 25th and December the 4th, which afforded me,\r\nas your letters always do, a treat on matters public, individual and\r\neconomical. I am impatient to learn your sentiments on the late troubles\r\nin the Eastern States. So far as I have yet seen, they do not appear\r\nto threaten serious consequences. Those States have suffered by the\r\nstoppage of the channels of their commerce, which have not yet found\r\nother issues. This must render money scarce, and make the people uneasy.\r\nThis uneasiness has produced acts absolutely unjustifiable: but I hope\r\nthey will provoke no severities from their governments. A consciousness\r\nof those in power, that their administration of the public affairs has\r\nbeen honest, may, perhaps, produce too great a degree of indignation:\r\nand those characters wherein fear predominates over hope, may apprehend\r\ntoo much from these instances of irregularity. They may conclude\r\ntoo hastily, that nature has formed man insusceptible of any other\r\ngovernment than that of force, a conclusion not founded in truth\r\nnor experience. Societies exist under three forms, sufficiently\r\ndistinguishable. 1. Without government, as among our Indians. 2. Under\r\ngovernments, wherein the will of every one has a just influence; as is\r\nthe case in England, in a slight degree, and in our States, in a\r\ngreat one. 3. Under governments of force; as is the case in all other\r\nmonarchies, and in most of the other republics. To have an idea of\r\nthe curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is a\r\ngovernment of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my\r\nmind, that the first condition is not the best. But I believe it to be\r\ninconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state has\r\na great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that enjoys a\r\nprecious degree of liberty and happiness. It has its evils too: the\r\nprincipal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But weigh\r\nthis against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing. _Malo\r\npericulosam libertatem quam quietam servitutem_. Even this evil is\r\nproductive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and\r\nnourishes a general attention to the public affairs. I hold it, that a\r\nlittle rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the\r\npolitical world, as storms in the physical. Unsuccessful rebellions,\r\nindeed, generally establish the encroachments on the rights of the\r\npeople, which have produced them. An observation of this truth should\r\nrender honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of\r\nrebellions, as not to discourage them too much. It is a medicine\r\nnecessary for the sound health of government.\r\n\r\nIf these transactions give me no uneasiness, I feel very differently\r\nat another piece of intelligence, to wit, the possibility that the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi may be abandoned to Spain. I never had any\r\ninterest westward of the Allegany; and I never will have any. But I\r\nhave had great opportunities of knowing the character of the people\r\nwho inhabit that country; and I will venture to say, that the act which\r\nabandons the navigation of the Mississippi, is an act of separation\r\nbetween the eastern and western country. It is a relinquishment of five\r\nparts out of eight of the territory of the United States; an abandonment\r\nof the fairest subject for the payment of our public debts, and the\r\nchaining those debts on our own necks, _in perpetuum_. I have the utmost\r\nconfidence in the honest intentions of those who concur in this measure;\r\nbut I lament their want of acquaintance with the character and physical\r\nadvantages of the people, who, right or wrong, will suppose their\r\ninterests sacrificed on this occasion to the contrary interests of that\r\npart of the confederacy in possession of present power. If they declare\r\nthemselves a separate people, we are incapable of a single effort to\r\nretain them. Our citizens can never be induced, either as militia or as\r\nsoldiers, to go there to cut the throats of their own brothers and sons,\r\nor rather, to be themselves the subjects, instead of the perpetrators,\r\nof the parricide. Nor would that country quit the cost of being retained\r\nagainst the will of its inhabitants, could it be done. But it cannot be\r\ndone. They are able already to rescue the navigation of the Mississippi\r\nout of the hands of Spain, and to add New Orleans to their own,\r\nterritory. They will be joined by the inhabitants of Louisiana. This\r\nwill bring on a war between them and Spain; and that will produce the\r\nquestion with us, whether it will not be worth our while to become\r\nparties with them in the war, in order to re-unite them with us, and\r\nthus correct our error. And were I to permit my forebodings to go one\r\nstep further, I should predict, that the inhabitants of the United\r\nStates would force their rulers to take the affirmative of that\r\nquestion. I wish I may be mistaken in all these opinions.\r\n\r\nWe have for some time expected, that the Chevalier de la Luzerne would\r\nobtain a promotion in the diplomatic line, by being appointed to some\r\nof the courts where this country keeps an ambassador. But none of the\r\nvacancies taking place, which had been counted on, I think the present\r\ndisposition is to require his return to his station in America. He told\r\nme himself, lately, that he should return in the spring. I have never\r\npressed this matter on the court, though I knew it to be desirable and\r\ndesired on our part; because if the compulsion on him to return had been\r\nthe work of Congress, he would have returned in such ill temper with\r\nthem, as to disappoint them in the good they expected from it. He would\r\nfor ever have laid at their door his failure of promotion. I did not\r\npress it for another reason, which is, that I have great reason to\r\nbelieve, that the character of the Count de Moutier, who would go, were\r\nthe Chevalier to be otherwise provided for, would give the most perfect\r\nsatisfaction in America.\r\n\r\nAs you have now returned into Congress, it will become of importance,\r\nthat you should form a just estimate of certain public characters; on\r\nwhich, therefore, I will give you such notes as my knowledge of them\r\nhas furnished me with. You will compare them with the materials you are\r\notherwise possessed of, and decide on a view of the whole.\r\n\r\nYou know the opinion I formerly entertained of my friend, Mr. Adams. *\r\n* * and the Governor were the first who shook that opinion. I afterwards\r\nsaw proofs, which convicted him of a degree of vanity, and of a\r\nblindness to it, of which no germ appeared in Congress. A seven months’\r\nintimacy with him here and as many weeks in London, have given me\r\nopportunities of studying him closely. He is vain, irritable, and a bad\r\ncalculator of the force and probable effect of the motives which govern\r\nmen. This is all the ill which can possibly be said of him. He is as\r\ndisinterested as the Being who made him: he is profound in his views;\r\nand accurate in his judgment, except where knowledge of the world is\r\nnecessary to form a judgment. He is so amiable, that I pronounce you\r\nwill love him, if ever you become acquainted with him. He would be, as\r\nhe was, a great man in Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Carmichael is, I think, very little known in America. I never saw\r\nhim, and while I was in Congress I formed rather a disadvantageous idea\r\nof him. His letters received then showed him vain, and more attentive to\r\nceremony and etiquette, than we suppose men of sense should be. I\r\nhave now a constant correspondence with him, and find him a little\r\nhypochondriac and discontented. He possesses a very good understanding,\r\nthough not of the first order. I have had great opportunities of\r\nsearching into his character, and have availed myself of them. Many\r\npersons of different nations, coming from Madrid to Paris, all speak of\r\nhim as in high esteem, and I think it certain that he has more of the\r\nCount de Florida Blanca’s friendship, than any diplomatic character at\r\nthat court. As long as this minister is in office, Carmichael can do\r\nmore than any other person who could be sent there.\r\n\r\nYou will see Franks, and doubtless he will be asking some appointment. I\r\nwish there may be any one for which he is fit. He is light, indiscreet,\r\nactive, honest, affectionate. Though Bingham is not in diplomatic\r\noffice, yet as he wishes to be so, I will mention such circumstances of\r\nhim, as you might otherwise be deceived in. He will make you believe he\r\nwas on the most intimate footing with the first characters in Europe,\r\nand versed in the secrets of every cabinet. Not a word of this is true.\r\nHe had a rage for being presented to great men, and had no * * * in the\r\nmethods by which he could effect it. * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Fayette is a most valuable auxiliary to me. His zeal\r\nis unbounded, and his weight with those in power, great. His education\r\nhaving been merely military, commerce was an unknown field to him.\r\nBut his good sense enabling him to comprehend perfectly whatever is\r\nexplained to him, his agency has been very efficacious. He has a great\r\ndeal of sound genius, is well remarked by the King, and rising in\r\npopularity. He has nothing against him, but the suspicion of republican\r\nprinciples. I think he will one day be of the ministry. His foible is\r\na canine appetite for popularity and fame; but he will get above this.\r\n_The Count de Vergennes is ill_. The possibility of his _recovery_\r\nrenders it dangerous for us to express a doubt of it; but he is in\r\ndanger. He is a great minister in European affairs, but has very\r\nimperfect ideas of our institutions, and no confidence in them. His\r\ndevotion to the principles of pure despotism, renders him unaffectionate\r\nto our governments. But his fear of England makes him value us as a\r\nmake-weight. He is cool, reserved in political conversations, but free\r\nand familiar on other subjects, and a very attentive, agreeable person\r\nto do business with. It is impossible to have a, clearer, better\r\norganized head; but age has chilled his heart,\r\n\r\nNothing should be spared on our part, to attach this country to us. It\r\nis the only one on which we can rely for support, under every event.\r\nIts inhabitants love us more, I think, than they do any other nation on\r\nearth. This is very much the effect of the good dispositions with which\r\nthe French officers returned. In a former letter, I mentioned to you the\r\ndislocation of my wrist. I can make not the least use of it, except for\r\nthe single article of writing, though it is going on five months since\r\nthe accident happened. I have great anxieties, lest I should never\r\nrecover any considerable use of it. I shall, by the advice of my\r\nsurgeons, set out in a fortnight for the waters of Aix, in Provence. I\r\nchose these out of several they proposed to me, because if they fail to\r\nbe effectual, my journey will not be useless altogether. It will give\r\nme an opportunity of examining the canal of Languedoc, and of acquiring\r\nknowledge of that species of navigation, which may be useful hereafter:\r\nbut, more immediately, it will enable me to make the tour of the ports\r\nconcerned in commerce with us, to examine, on the spot, the defects\r\nof the late regulations, respecting our commerce, to learn the further\r\nimprovements which may be made in it, and, on my return, to get this\r\nbusiness finished. I shall be absent between two and three months,\r\nunless anything happens to recall me here sooner, which may always be\r\neffected in ten days, in whatever part of my route I may be.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of characters, I omitted those of Reyneval and Hennin,\r\nthe two eyes of Count de Vergennes. The former is the most important\r\ncharacter, because possessing the most of the confidence of the Count.\r\nHe is rather cunning than wise, his views of things being neither great\r\nnor liberal. He governs himself by principles which he has learned\r\nby rote, and is fit only for the details of execution. His heart\r\nis susceptible of little passions, but not of good ones. He is\r\nbrother-in-law to M. Gerard, from whom he received disadvantageous\r\nimpressions of us, which cannot be effaced. He has much duplicity.\r\nHennin is a philosopher, sincere, friendly, liberal, learned, beloved by\r\nevery body: the other by nobody. I think it a great misfortune that the\r\nUnited States are in the department of the former. As particulars\r\nof this kind may be useful to you, in your present situation, I may\r\nhereafter continue the chapter. I know it will be safely lodged in your\r\ndiscretion. Feb. 5. Since writing thus far, Franks has returned from\r\nEngland. I learn that Mr. Adams desires to be recalled, and that Smith\r\nshould be appointed _Chargé des Affaires_ there. It is not for me to\r\ndecide whether any diplomatic character should be kept at a court, which\r\nkeeps none with us. You can judge of Smith’s abilities by his letters.\r\nThey are not of the first order, but they are good. For his honesty, he\r\nis like our friend Monroe; turn his soul wrong side outwards, and there\r\nis not a speck on it. He has one foible, an excessive inflammability of\r\ntemper, but he feels it when it comes on, and has resolution enough to\r\nsuppress it, and to remain silent till it passes over.\r\n\r\nI send you, by Colonel Franks, your pocket telescope, walking stick, and\r\nchemical box. The two former could not be combined together. The latter\r\ncould not be had in the form you referred to. Having a great desire\r\nto have a portable copying machine, and being satisfied from some\r\nexperiment, that the principle of the large machine might be applied in\r\na small one, I planned one when in England, and had it made. It answers\r\nperfectly. I have since set a workman to making them here, and they are\r\nin such demand that he has his hands full. Being assured that you will\r\nbe pleased to have one, when you shall have tried its convenience, I\r\nsend you one by Colonel Franks. The machine costs ninety-six livres, the\r\nappendages twenty-four livres, and I send you paper and ink for twelve\r\nlivres; in all, one hundred and thirty-two livres. There is a printed\r\npaper of directions: but you must expect to make many essays before\r\nyou succeed perfectly. A soft brush, like a shaving-brush, is more\r\nconvenient than the sponge. You can get as much ink and paper as you\r\nplease, from London. The paper costs a guinea a ream. I am, Dear Sir,\r\nwith sincere esteem and affection, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLV.--TO JOHN JAY, February 1, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, February 1, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy last letters were of the 31st of December and 9th of January; since\r\nwhich last date, I have been honored with yours of December the 13th and\r\n14th. I shall pay immediate attention to your instructions relative\r\nto the South Carolina frigate. I had the honor of informing you of\r\nan improvement in the art of coining, made here by one Drost, and of\r\nsending you, by Colonel Franks, a specimen of his execution in gold and\r\nsilver. I expected to have sent also a coin of copper. The enclosed note\r\nfrom Drost will explain the reason why this was not sent. It will let\r\nyou see also, that he may be employed; as I suppose he is not so certain\r\nas he was of being engaged here. Mr. Grand, who knows him, gives me\r\nreason to believe he may be engaged reasonably. Congress will decide\r\nwhether it be worth their attention.\r\n\r\nIn some of my former letters, I suggested an opportunity of obliging the\r\ncourt, by borrowing as much money in Holland as would pay the debt due\r\nhere, if such a loan could be obtained; as to which, I was altogether\r\nignorant. To save time, I wrote to Mr. Dumas, to know whether he thought\r\nit probable a loan could be obtained, enjoining on him the strictest\r\nsecrecy, and informing him I was making the inquiry merely of my own\r\nmotion, and without instruction. I enclose you his answer. He thinks\r\npurchasers of the debt could be found, with a sacrifice of a small part\r\nof the capital, and a postponement be obtained of some of the first\r\nreimbursements. The proposition by him, for an immediate adoption of\r\nthis measure by me, was probably urged, on his mind by a desire to serve\r\nour country, more than a strict attention to my duty, and the magnitude\r\nof the object. I hope, on the contrary, that if it should be thought\r\nworth a trial, it may be put into the hands of Mr. Adams, who knows the\r\nground, and is known there, and whose former successful negotiations in\r\nthis line would give better founded hopes of success on this occasion.\r\n\r\nI formerly mentioned to you the hopes of preferment, entertained by the\r\nChevalier de la Luzerne. They have been baffled by events; none of the\r\nvacancies taking place which had been expected. Had I pressed his being\r\nordered back, I have reason to believe the order would have been given.\r\nBut he would have gone back in ill humor with Congress, he would have\r\nlaid for ever at their door the failure of a promotion then viewed\r\nas certain; and this might have excited dispositions that would have\r\ndisappointed us of the good we hoped from his return. The line I have\r\nobserved with him has been, to make him sensible that nothing was more\r\ndesired by Congress than his return, but that they would not willingly\r\npress it, so as to defeat him of a personal advantage. He sees his\r\nprospects fail, and will return in the approaching spring unless\r\nsomething unexpected should turn up in his favor. In this case, the\r\nCount de Moutier has the promise of succeeding to him, and if I do not\r\nmistake his character, he would give great satisfaction. So that I think\r\nyou may calculate on seeing one or the other, by midsummer.\r\n\r\nIt had been suspected that France and England might adopt those\r\nconcerted regulations of commerce for their West Indies, of which your\r\nletter expresses some apprehensions. But the expressions in the\r\n4th, 5th, 7th, 11th, 18th, and other articles of their treaty, which\r\ncommunicate to the English the privileges of the most favored European\r\nnation only, has lessened, if not removed those fears. They have clearly\r\nreserved a right of favoring, specially, any nation not European; and\r\nthere is no nation out of Europe, who could so probably have been\r\nin their eye at that time, as ours. They are wise. They must see it\r\nprobable, at least, that any concert with England will be but of\r\nshort duration; and they could hardly propose to sacrifice for that, a\r\nconnection with us, which may be perpetual.\r\n\r\nWe have been for some days, in much inquietude for the Count de\r\nVergennes. He is very seriously ill. Nature seems struggling to decide\r\nhis disease into a gout. A swelled foot, at present gives us a hope-of\r\nthis issue. His loss would at all times have been great; but it would be\r\nimmense during the critical poise of European affairs, existing at\r\nthis moment. I enclose you a letter from one of the foreign officers,\r\ncomplaining of the non-payment of their interest. It is only one out\r\nof many I have received. This is accompanied by a second copy of the\r\nMoorish declaration sent me by Mr. Barclay. He went to Alicant to settle\r\nwith Mr. Lambe; but on his arrival there, found he was gone to Minorca.\r\nA copy of his letter will inform you of this circumstance, and of some\r\nothers relative to Algiers, with his opinion on them. Whatever the\r\nStates may enable Congress to do for obtaining the peace of that\r\ncountry, it is a separate question whether they will redeem our\r\ncaptives, how, and at what price. If they decide to redeem them, I will\r\nbeg leave to observe, that it is of great importance that the first\r\nredemption be made at as low a price as possible, because it will form\r\nthe future tariff. If these pirates find that they can have a very great\r\nprice for Americans, they will abandon proportionably their pursuits\r\nagainst other nations, to direct them towards ours. That the choice\r\nof Congress may be enlarged, as to the instruments they may use for\r\neffecting the redemption, I think it my duty to inform them, that there\r\nis here an order of priests called the Mathurins, the object of whose\r\ninstitution is to beg alms for the redemption of captives. They keep\r\nmembers always in Barbary, searching out the captives of their country,\r\nand redeem, I believe, on better terms than any other body, public or\r\nprivate. It occurred to me, that their agency might be obtained for the\r\nredemption of our prisoners at Algiers. I obtained conferences with the\r\nGeneral, and with some members of the order. The General, with all\r\nthe benevolence and cordiality possible, undertook to act for us if we\r\nshould, desire it. He told me that their last considerable redemption\r\nwas of about three hundred prisoners, who cost them somewhat upwards\r\nof fifteen hundred livres apiece. But that they should not be able\r\nto redeem ours, as cheap as they do their own; and that it must be\r\nabsolutely unknown that the public concern themselves in the operation,\r\nor the price would be greatly enhanced. The difference of religion was\r\nnot once mentioned, nor did it appear to me to be thought of. It was\r\na silent reclamation and acknowledgment of fraternity, between two\r\nreligions of the same family, which historical events of ancient\r\ndate had rendered more hostile to one another, than to their common\r\nadversaries. I informed the General, that I should communicate the\r\ngood dispositions of his order, to those who alone had the authority to\r\ndecide whatever related to our captives. Mr. Carmichael informs me, that\r\nmonies have been advanced for the support of our prisoners at Algiers,\r\nwhich ought to be replaced. I infer from the context of his letter,\r\nthat these advances have been made by the court of Madrid. I submit the\r\ninformation to Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce is certainly concluded between France and Russia.\r\nThe particulars of it are yet secret.\r\n\r\nI enclose the gazettes of France and Leyden to this date, and have the\r\nhonor of assuring you of those sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nwith which I am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVI.--TO MRS. BINGHAM, February 7, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BINGHAM.\r\n\r\nParis, February 7, 1787.\r\n\r\nI know, Madam, that the twelve-month is not yet expired; but it will be,\r\nnearly, before this will have the honor of being put into your hands.\r\nYou are then engaged to tell me, truly and honestly, whether you do not\r\nfind the tranquil pleasures of America, preferable to the empty bustle\r\nof Paris. For to what does that bustle tend? At eleven o’clock, it is\r\nday, _chez madame_, the curtains are drawn. Propped on bolsters and\r\npillows, and her head scratched into a little order, the bulletins of\r\nthe sick are read, and the billets of the well. She writes to some of\r\nher acquaintance, and receives the visits of others. If the morning is\r\nnot very thronged, she is able to get out and hobble round the cage of\r\nthe Palais Royal; but she must hobble quickly, for the coiffeurs turn is\r\ncome; and a tremendous turn it is! Happy, if he does not make her arrive\r\nwhen dinner is half over! The torpitude of digestion a little passed,\r\nshe flutters half an hour through the streets, by way of paying visits,\r\nand then to the spectacles. These finished; another half hour is devoted\r\nto dodging in and out of the doors of her very sincere friends, and away\r\nto supper. After supper, cards and after cards, bed; to rise at noon the\r\nnext day, and to tread, like a mill-horse, the same trodden circle over\r\nagain. Thus the days of life are consumed, one by one, without an object\r\nbeyond the present moment; ever flying from the ennui of that, yet\r\ncarrying it with us; eternally in pursuit of happiness, which keeps\r\neternally before us. If death or bankruptcy happen to trip us out of\r\nthe circle, it is matter for the buzz of the evening, and is completely\r\nforgotten by the next morning. In America, on the other hand,\r\nthe society of your husband, the fond cares for the children, the\r\narrangements of the house, the improvements of the grounds, fill\r\nevery moment with a healthy and an useful activity. Every exertion is\r\nencouraging, because to present amusement it joins the promise of some\r\nfuture good. The intervals of leisure are filled by the society of real\r\nfriends, whose affections are not thinned to cobweb, by being spread\r\nover a thousand objects. This is the picture, in the light it is\r\npresented to my mind; now let me have it in yours. If we do not concur\r\nthis year, we shall the next; or if not then, in a year or two more. You\r\nsee I am determined not to suppose myself mistaken.\r\n\r\nTo let you see that Paris is not changed in its pursuits, since it was\r\nhonored with your presence, I send you its monthly history. But this\r\nrelating only to the embellishments of their persons, I must add, that\r\nthose of the city go on well also. A new bridge, for example, is begun\r\nat the _Place Louis Quinze_; the old ones are clearing of the rubbish\r\nwhich encumbered them in the form of houses 5 new hospitals erecting;\r\nmagnificent walls of inclosure, and Custom-houses at their entrances,\r\n&c. &c. &c. I know of no interesting change among those whom you honored\r\nwith your acquaintance, unless Monsieur de Saint James was of that\r\nnumber. His bankruptcy, and taking asylum in the Bastille, have\r\nfurnished matter of astonishment. His garden, at the Pont de Neuilly,\r\nwhere, on seventeen acres of ground he had laid out fifty thousand\r\nlouis, will probably sell for somewhat less money. The workmen of Paris\r\nare making rapid strides towards English perfection. Would you believe,\r\nthat in the course of the last two years, they have learned even to\r\nsurpass their London rivals in some articles? Commission me to have you\r\na phaeton made, and if it is not as much handsomer than a London one,\r\nas that is than a fiacre, send it back to me. Shall I fill the box with\r\ncaps, bonnets, &c.? Not of my own choosing, but I was going to say,\r\nof Mademoiselle Bertin’s, forgetting for the moment, that she too is\r\nbankrupt. They shall be chosen then by whom you please; or, if you are\r\naltogether nonplused by her eclipse, we will call an _Assemblées des\r\nNotables_, to help you out of the difficulty, as is now the fashion.\r\nIn short, honor me with your, commands of any kind, and they shall be\r\nfaithfully executed. The packets now established from Havre to New York\r\nfurnish good opportunities of sending whatever you wish.\r\n\r\nI shall end where I began, like a Paris day, reminding you of your\r\nengagement to write me a letter of respectable length, an engagement\r\nthe more precious to me, as it has furnished me the occasion, after\r\npresenting my respects to Mr. Bingham, of assuring you of the sincerity\r\nof those sentiments of esteem and respect, with which I have the honor\r\nto be, Dear Madam, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVII.--TO GOVERNOR RANDOLPH, February 7, 1787\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nParis, February 7, 1787.\r\n\r\nI have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency a report of the\r\nproceedings on the inauguration of the bust of the Marquis de la\r\nFayette, in this city. This has been attended with a considerable, but\r\na necessary delay. The principle that the King is the sole fountain\r\nof honor in this country, opposed a barrier to our desires, which\r\nthreatened to be insurmountable. No instance of a similar proposition\r\nfrom a foreign power, had occurred in their history. The admitting it\r\nin this case, is a singular proof of the King’s friendly dispositions\r\ntowards the States of America, and of his personal esteem for the\r\ncharacter of the Marquis de la Fayette.\r\n\r\nI take this, the earliest occasion, of congratulating my country on your\r\nexcellency’s appointment to the chair of government, and of assuring\r\nyou, with great sincerity, of those sentiments of perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I have the honor to be your. Excellency’s most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVIII.--TO JOHN JAY, February 8, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, February 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe packet being to sail the day after to-morrow, I have awaited the\r\nlast possible moment of writing by her, in hopes I might be able\r\nto announce some favorable change in the situation of the Count de\r\nVergennes. But none has occurred, and in the mean time he has become\r\nweaker by the continuance of his illness. Though not desperately ill, he\r\nis dangerously so. The Comptroller General, M. de Calonne, has been very\r\nill also, but he is getting well. These circumstances have occasioned\r\nthe postponement of the Assemblée des Notables to the 14th instant, and\r\nwill probably occasion a further postponement. As I shall set out this\r\nday se’nnight for the waters of Aix, you will probably hear the issue\r\nof the Count de Vergennes illness through some other channel, before I\r\nshall have the honor of addressing you again. I may observe the same as\r\nto the final decision for the enfranchisement of Honfleur, which is in\r\na fair way of being speedily concluded. The exertions of Monsieur de\r\nCreve-coeur, and particularly his influence with the Duke d’Harcourt,\r\nthe principal instrument in effecting it, have been of chief consequence\r\nin this matter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIX.--TO MR. DUMAS, February 9, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nParis, February 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was dated December the 25th; since which I have been\r\nhonored with your several favors of December the 29th, January the 5th,\r\n9th, and 23rd. I thought that your affairs could not be more interesting\r\nthan they have been for a considerable time. Yet in the present moment\r\nthey are become more so, by the apparent withdrawing of so considerable\r\na personage in the drama, as the King of Prussia. To increase this\r\ninterest, another person, whose importance scarcely admits calculation,\r\nis in a situation which fills us with alarm. Nature is struggling to\r\nrelieve him by a decided gout; she has my sincere prayers to aid her, as\r\nI am persuaded she has yours. I have letters and papers from America\r\nas late as the 15th of December. The government of Massachusetts had\r\nimprisoned three of the leaders of their insurgents. The insurgents,\r\nbeing collected to the number of three or four hundred, had sent in\r\ntheir petition to the government, praying another act of pardon for\r\ntheir leaders and themselves, and on this condition offering to go every\r\nman home, and conduct himself dutifully afterwards. This is the latest\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to the question I had taken the liberty\r\nof proposing to you. I think with you, that it would be advisable to\r\nhave our debt transferred to individuals of your country. There could\r\nand would be no objection to the guarantee remaining as you propose;\r\nand a postponement of the first payments of capital would surely be a\r\nconvenience to us. For though the resources of the United States are\r\ngreat and growing, and their dispositions good, yet their machine is\r\nnew, and they have not got it to go well. It is the object of their\r\ngeneral wish at present, and they are all in movement, to set it in a\r\ngood train; but their movements are necessarily slow. They will surely\r\neffect it in the end, because all have the same end in view; the\r\ndifficulty being only to get all the thirteen States to agree on the\r\nsame means. Divesting myself of every partiality, and speaking from that\r\nthorough knowledge which I have of the country, their resources, and\r\ntheir principles, I had rather trust money in their hands, than in that\r\nof any government on earth; because, though for a while the payments of\r\nthe interest might be less regular, yet the final reimbursement of the\r\ncapital would be more sure.\r\n\r\nI set out next week for the south of France, to try whether some mineral\r\nwaters in that quarter, much recommended, will restore the use of my\r\nhand. I shall be absent from Paris two or three months; but I take\r\narrangements for the regular receipt of your favors, as if I were here.\r\nIt will be better, however, for you to put your letters to Mr. Jay under\r\ncover to Mr. Short, who remains here, and will forward them.\r\n\r\nI have thought it my duty to submit to Congress the proposition about\r\nthe French debt, and may expect their answer in four months.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER L.--TO JOHN JAY, February 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, February 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn the letter of the 8th instant, which I had the honor of writing you,\r\nI informed you that the Count de Vergennes was dangerously ill. He\r\ndied yesterday morning, and the Count de Montmorin is appointed\r\nhis successor. Your personal knowledge of this gentleman renders it\r\nunnecessary for me to say any thing of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris, during his office, being authorized to have the medals\r\nand swords executed, which had been ordered by Congress, he authorized\r\nColonel Humphreys to take measures here for the execution. Colonel\r\nHumphreys did so; and the swords were finished in time for him to carry\r\nthem. The medals not being finished, he desired me to attend to them.\r\nThe workman who was to make that of General Greene, brought me yesterday\r\nthe medal in gold, twenty-three in copper, and the die. Mr. Short,\r\nduring my absence, will avail himself of the first occasion which shall\r\noffer, of forwarding the medals to you. I must beg leave, through you,\r\nto ask the pleasure of Congress as to the number they would choose\r\nto have struck. Perhaps they might be willing to deposite one of each\r\nperson in every college of the United States. Perhaps they might choose\r\nto give a series of them to each of the crowned heads of Europe, which\r\nwould be an acceptable present to them. They will be pleased to decide.\r\nIn the mean time I have sealed up the die, and shall retain it till I\r\nam honored with their orders as to this medal, and the others also when\r\nthey shall be finished.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nSir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LI.--TO JOHN JAY, February 23, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, February 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe _Assemblée des Notables_ being an event in the history of\r\nthis country which excites notice, I have supposed it would not be\r\ndisagreeable to you to learn its immediate objects, though no way\r\nconnected with our interests. The Assembly met yesterday: the King, in a\r\nshort but affectionate speech, informed them of his wish to consult\r\nwith them on the plans he had digested, and on the general good of his\r\npeople, and his desire to imitate the head of his family, Henry IV.,\r\nwhose memory is so dear to the nation. The _Garde des Sceaux_ then spoke\r\nabout twenty minutes, chiefly in compliment to the orders present. The\r\nComptroller General, in a speech of about an hour, opened the budget,\r\nand enlarged on the several subjects which will be under their\r\ndeliberation. He explained the situation of the finances at his\r\naccession to office, the expenses which their arrangement had rendered\r\nnecessary, their present state with the improvements made in them, the\r\nseveral plans which had been proposed for their further improvement, a\r\nchange in the form of some of their taxes, the removal of the interior\r\nCustom-houses to the frontiers, and the institution of Provincial\r\nAssemblies. The Assembly was then divided into committees, with a prince\r\nof the blood at the head of each. In this form they are to discuss\r\nseparately the subjects which will be submitted to them. Their decision\r\nwill be reported by two members to the minister, who, on view of the\r\nseparate decisions of all the committees, will make such changes in his\r\nplans, as will best accommodate them to their views, without too much\r\ndeparting from his own, and will then submit them to the vote (but\r\nI believe not to the debate) of the General Assembly, which will\r\nbe convened for this purpose one day in every week, and will vote\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nThe event ©f the Count de Vergennes’death, of which I had the honor to\r\ninform you in a letter of the 14th instant, the appointment of the Count\r\nMontmorin, and the propriety of my attending at his first audience,\r\nwhich will be on the 27th, have retarded the journey I had proposed a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nI shall hope, on my return, to meet here new powers for the consular\r\nconvention, as, under those I have, it will be impossible to make the\r\nchanges in the convention, which may be wished for.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LII.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, February 28, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, February 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am just now in the moment of my departure. Monsieur de Montmorin\r\nhaving given us audience at Paris yesterday, I missed the opportunity\r\nof seeing you once more. I am extremely pleased with his modesty, the\r\nsimplicity of his manners, and his dispositions towards us. I promise\r\nmyself a great deal of satisfaction in doing business with him. I hope\r\nhe will not give ear to any unfriendly suggestions. I flatter myself I\r\nshall hear from you sometimes. Send your letters to my hotel as usual,\r\nand they will be forwarded to me. I wish you success in your meeting.\r\nI should form better hopes of it, if it were divided into two Houses\r\ninstead of seven. Keeping the good model of your neighboring country\r\nbefore your eyes, you may get on, step by step, towards a good\r\nconstitution. Though that model is not perfect, yet, as it would unite\r\nmore suffrages than any new one which could be proposed, it is better to\r\nmake that the object. If every advance is to be purchased by filling the\r\nroyal coffers with gold, it will be gold well employed. The King, who\r\nmeans so well, should be encouraged to repeat these Assemblies. You see\r\nhow we republicans are apt to preach, when we get on politics. Adieu, my\r\ndear friend.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIII.--TO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE TESSE, March 20, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE TESSE.\r\n\r\nNismes, March 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nHere I am, Madam, gazing whole hours at the _Maison Quarrée_, like a\r\nlover at his mistress. The stocking-weavers and silk-spinners around it,\r\nconsider me as a hypochondriac Englishman, about to write with a pistol\r\nthe last chapter of his history. This is the second time I have been in\r\nlove since I left Paris. The first was with a Diana at the Chateau de\r\nLay-Epinaye in Beaujolois, a delicious morsel of sculpture, by M. A.\r\nSlodtz. This, you will say, was in rule, to fall in love with a female\r\nbeauty: but with a house! It is out of all precedent. No, Madam, it\r\nis not without a precedent, in my own history. While in Paris, I\r\nwas violently smitten with the Hotel de Salm, and used to go to the\r\nTuileries almost daily to look at it. The _loueuse des chaises_,\r\ninattentive to my passion, never had the complaisance to place a chair\r\nthere, so that, sitting on the parapet, and twisting my neck round to\r\nsee the object of my admiration, I generally left it with a torticollis.\r\n\r\nFrom Lyons to Nismes I have been nourished with the remains of Roman\r\ngrandeur. They have always brought you to my mind, because I know your\r\naffection for whatever is Roman and noble. At Vienne I thought of you.\r\nBut I am glad you were not there; for you would have seen me more\r\nangry than I hope you will ever see me. The Praetorian palace, as it is\r\ncalled, comparable, for its fine proportions, to the _Maison Quarrée_,\r\ndefaced by the barbarians who have converted it to its present purpose,\r\nits beautiful fluted Corinthian columns cut out in part to make space\r\nfor Gothic windows, and hewed down in the residue to the plane of\r\nthe building, was enough, you must admit, to disturb my composure. At\r\nOrange, too, I thought of you. I was sure you had seen with pleasure\r\nthe sublime triumphal arch of Marius at the entrance of the city. I went\r\nthen to the Arena. Would you believe, Madam, that in this eighteenth\r\ncentury, in France, under the reign of Louis XVI., they are at this\r\nmoment pulling down the circular wall of this superb remain to pave a\r\nroad? And that too from a hill which is itself an entire mass of stone,\r\njust as fit, and more accessible? A former intendant, a M. de Basville,\r\nhas rendered his memory dear to the traveller and amateur, by the\r\npains he took to preserve and restore these monuments of antiquity. The\r\npresent one (I do not know who he is) is demolishing the object to make\r\na good road to it. I thought of you again, and I was then in great good\r\nhumor, at the _Pont du Gard_, a sublime antiquity, and well preserved.\r\nBut most of all here, where Roman taste, genius, and magnificence excite\r\nideas analogous to yours at every step. I could no longer oppose the\r\ninclination to avail myself of your permission to write to you, a\r\npermission given with too much complaisance by you, and used by me with\r\ntoo much indiscretion. Madame de Tott did me the same honor.\r\n\r\nBut she being only the descendant of some of those puny heroes who\r\nboiled their own kettles before the walls of Troy, I shall write to her\r\nfrom a Grecian, rather than a Roman canton: when I shall find myself,\r\nfor example, among her Phocæan relations at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nLoving, as you do, Madam, the precious remains of antiquity, loving\r\narchitecture, gardening, a warm sun, and a clear sky, I wonder you have\r\nnever thought of moving Chaville to Nismes. This, as you know, has\r\nnot always been deemed impracticable; and, therefore, the next time a\r\n_Surintendant des bailments du roi_, after the example of M. Colbert,\r\nsends persons to Nismes to move the _Maison Quarrée_ to Paris, that they\r\nmay not come empty-handed, desire them to bring Chaville with them to\r\nreplace it. _A propos_ of Paris. I have now been three weeks from there,\r\nwithout knowing any thing of what has passed. I suppose I shall meet\r\nit all at Aix, where I have directed my letters to be lodged, _poste\r\nrestante_. My journey has given me leisure to reflect on this _Assemblée\r\ndes Notables_. Under a good and a young King, as the present, I think\r\ngood may be made of it. I would have the deputies, then, by all means,\r\nso conduct themselves as to encourage him to repeat the calls of this\r\nAssembly. Their first step should be to get themselves divided into two\r\nchambers instead of seven; the Noblesse and the Commons separately. The\r\nsecond, to persuade the King, instead of choosing the deputies of the\r\nCommons himself, to summon those chosen by the people for the Provincial\r\nadministrations. The third, as the Noblesse is too numerous to be all\r\nof the Assemblée, to obtain permission for that body to choose its own\r\ndeputies. Two Houses, so elected, would contain a mass of wisdom, which\r\nwould make the people happy, and the King great; would place him in\r\nhistory where no other act can possibly place him. They would thus put\r\nthemselves in the track of the best guide they can follow, they would\r\nsoon overtake it, become its guide in turn, and lead to the wholesome\r\nmodifications wanting in that model, and necessary to constitute a\r\nrational government. Should they attempt more than the established\r\nhabits of the people are ripe for, they must lose all, and retard\r\nindefinitely the ultimate object of their aim. These, Madam, are my\r\nopinions; but I wish to know yours, which I am sure will be better.\r\n\r\nFrom a correspondent at Nismes you will not expect news. Were I to\r\nattempt to give you news, I should tell you stories one thousand years\r\nold. I should detail to you the intrigues of the courts of the Cæsars,\r\nhow they affect us here, the oppressions of their praetors, prefects,\r\n&c. I am immersed in antiquities from morning to night. For me the city\r\nof Rome is actually existing in all the splendor of its empire. I am\r\nfilled with alarms for the event of the irruptions daily making on us\r\nby the Goths, the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Vandals, lest they should\r\nre-conquer us to our original barbarism. If I am sometimes induced to\r\nlook forward to the eighteenth century, it is only when recalled to\r\nit by the recollection of your goodness and friendship, and by those\r\nsentiments of sincere esteem and respect, with which I have the honor to\r\nbe,\r\n\r\nMadam, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIV.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, April 11, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nNice, April 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nYour head, my dear friend, is full of _Notable_ things; and being better\r\nemployed, therefore, I do not expect letters from you. I am constantly\r\nroving about to see what I have never seen before, and shall never see\r\nagain. In the great cities, I go to see what travellers think alone\r\nworthy of being seen; but I make a job of it, and generally gulp it\r\nall down in a day. On the other hand, I am never satiated with rambling\r\nthrough the fields and farms, examining the culture and cultivators with\r\na degree of curiosity, which makes some take me to be a fool, and others\r\nto be much wiser than I am. I have been pleased to find among the people\r\na less degree of physical misery than I had expected. They are generally\r\nwell clothed, and have a plenty of food, not animal indeed, but\r\nvegetable, which is as wholesome. Perhaps they are over-worked, the\r\nexcess of the rent required by the landlord obliging them to too many\r\nhours of labor in order to produce that, and wherewith to feed and\r\nclothe themselves. The soil of Champagne and Burgundy I have found more\r\nuniversally good than I had expected, and as I could not help making a\r\ncomparison with England, I found that comparison more unfavorable to\r\nthe latter than is generally admitted. The soil, the climate, and the\r\nproductions are superior to those of England, and the husbandry as\r\ngood, except in one point; that of manure. In England, long leases for\r\ntwenty-one years, or three lives, to wit, that of the farmer, his wife,\r\nand son, renewed by the son as soon as he comes to the possession, for\r\nhis own life, his wife’s, and eldest child’s, and so on, render the\r\nfarms there almost hereditary, make it worth the farmer’s while to\r\nmanure the lands highly, and give the landlord an opportunity of\r\noccasionally making his rent keep pace with the improved state of the\r\nlands. Here the leases are either during pleasure, or for three, six, or\r\nnine years, which does not give the farmer time to repay himself for the\r\nexpensive operation of well manuring, and therefore, he manures ill,\r\nor not at all. I suppose, that could the practice of leasing for three\r\nlives be introduced in the whole kingdom, it would, within the term of\r\nyour life, increase agricultural productions fifty per cent.; or were\r\nany one proprietor to do it with his own lands, it would increase his\r\nrents fifty per cent, in the course of twenty-five years. But I am told\r\nthe laws do not permit it. The laws then, in this particular, are\r\nunwise and unjust, and ought to give that permission. In the southern\r\nprovinces, where the soil is poor, the climate hot and dry, and there\r\nare few animals, they would learn the art, found so precious in England,\r\nof making vegetable manure, and thus improving the provinces in the\r\narticle in which nature has been least kind to them. Indeed, these\r\nprovinces afford a singular spectacle. Calculating on the poverty of\r\ntheir soil, and their climate by its latitude only, they should have\r\nbeen the poorest in France. On the contrary, they are the richest, from\r\none fortuitous circumstance. Spurs or ramifications of high mountains,\r\nmaking down from the Alps, and, as it were, reticulating these\r\nprovinces, give to the vallies the protection of a particular inclosure\r\nto each, and the benefit of a general stagnation of the northern winds\r\nproduced by the whole of them, and thus countervail the advantage of\r\nseveral degrees of latitude. From the first olive fields of Pierrelatte,\r\nto the orangeries of Hieres, has been continued rapture to me. I have\r\noften wished for you. I think you have not made this journey. It is a\r\npleasure you have to come, and an improvement to be added to the many\r\nyou have already made. It will be a great comfort to you, to know, from\r\nyour own inspection, the condition of all the provinces of your own\r\ncountry, and it will be interesting to them at some future day, to be\r\nknown to you. This is, perhaps, the only moment of your life in which\r\nyou can acquire that knowledge. And to do it most effectually, you must\r\nbe absolutely incognito, you must ferret the people out of their hovels\r\nas I have done, look into their kettles, eat their bread, loll on their\r\nbeds under pretence of resting yourself, but in fact to find if they\r\nare soft. You will feel a sublime pleasure in the course of this\r\ninvestigation, and a sublimer one hereafter, when you shall be able to\r\napply your knowledge to the softening of their beds, or the throwing a\r\nmorsel of meat into their kettle of vegetables.\r\n\r\nYou will not wonder at the subjects of my letter: they are the only ones\r\nwhich have been presented to my mind for some time past; and the waters\r\nmust always be what are the fountains from which they flow. According\r\nto this, indeed, I should have intermixed, from beginning to end, warm\r\nexpressions of friendship to you. But, according to the ideas of our\r\ncountry, we do not permit ourselves to speak even truths, when they may\r\nhave the air of flattery. I content myself, therefore, with saying once\r\nfor all, that I love you, your wife, and children. Tell them so, and\r\nadieu.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LV.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, April 12, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNice, April 12, 1787,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAt Marseilles, they told me I should encounter the rice fields of\r\nPiedmont soon after crossing the Alps. Here they tell me there are none\r\nnearer than Vercelli and Novara, which is carrying me almost to Milan. I\r\nfear that this circumstance will occasion me a greater delay than I\r\nhad calculated on. However, I am embarked in the project, and shall go\r\nthrough with it. To-morrow, I set out on my passage over the Alps, being\r\nto pursue it ninety-three miles to Coni, on mules, as the snows are\r\nnot yet enough melted to admit carriages to pass. I leave mine here,\r\ntherefore, proposing to return by water from Genoa. I think it will\r\nbe three weeks before I get back to Nice. I find this climate quite\r\nas delightful as it has been represented. Hieres is the only place in\r\nFrance, which may be compared with it. The climates are equal. In favor\r\nof this place, are the circumstances of gay and dissipated society,\r\na handsome city, good accommodations, and some commerce. In favor of\r\nHieres, are environs of delicious and extensive plains, a society more\r\ncontracted, and therefore more capable of esteem, and the neighborhood\r\nof Toulon, Marseilles, and other places, to which excursions may be\r\nmade. Placing Marseilles in comparison with Hieres, it has extensive\r\nsociety, a good theatre, freedom from military control, and the most\r\nanimated commerce. But its winter climate is far inferior. I am now in\r\nthe act of putting my baggage into portable form for my bat-mule; after\r\npraying you, therefore, to let my daughter know I am well, and that I\r\nshall not be heard of again in three weeks, I take my leave of you for\r\nthat time, with assurances of the sincere esteem with which I am, Dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVI.--TO JOHN JAY, May 4, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nMarseilles, May 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of receiving at Aix, your letter of February the 9th,\r\nand immediately wrote to the Count de Montmorin, explaining the delay\r\nof the answer of Congress to the King’s letter, and desired Mr. Short to\r\ndeliver that answer, with my letter, to Monsieur de Montmorin, which he\r\ninforms me he has accordingly done.\r\n\r\nMy absence prevented my noting to you, in the first moment, the\r\nrevolution which has taken place at Paris, in the department of finance,\r\nby the substitution of Monsieur de Fourqueux in the place of Monsieur\r\nde Calonne; so that you will have heard of it through other channels,\r\nbefore this will have the honor of reaching you.\r\n\r\nHaving staid at Aix long enough to prove the inefficacy of the waters,\r\nI came on to this place, for the purpose of informing myself here, as I\r\nmean to do at the other seaport towns, of whatever may be interesting to\r\nour commerce. So far as carried on in our own bottoms, I find it almost\r\nnothing; and so it must probably remain, till something can be done with\r\nthe Algerines. Though severely afflicted with the plague, they have\r\ncome out within these few days, and showed themselves in force along the\r\ncoast of Genoa, cannonading a little town and taking several vessels.\r\n\r\nAmong other objects of inquiry, this was the place to learn something\r\nmore certain on the subject of rice, as it is a great emporium for that\r\nof the Levant, and of Italy. I wished particularly to know, whether it\r\nwas the use of a different machine for cleaning, which brought European\r\nrice to market less broken than ours, as had been represented to me, by\r\nthose who deal in that article in Paris. I found several persons who had\r\npassed through the rice country of Italy, but not one who could explain\r\nto me the nature of the machine. But I was given to believe, that I\r\nmight see it myself immediately on entering Piedmont. As this would\r\nrequire but about three weeks, I determined to go, and ascertain this\r\npoint; as the chance only of placing our rice above all rivalship in\r\nquality, as it is in color, by the introduction of a better machine, if\r\na better existed, seemed to justify the application of that much time to\r\nit. I found the rice country to be in truth Lombardy, one hundred miles\r\nfurther than had been represented, and that though called Piedmont rice,\r\nnot a grain is made in the country of Piedmont. I passed through the\r\nrice-fields of the Vercellese and Milanese, about sixty miles, and\r\nreturned from thence last night, having found that the machine is\r\nabsolutely the same as ours, and of course, that we need not listen more\r\nto that suggestion. It is a difference in the species of grain; of which\r\nthe government of Turin is so sensible, that, as I was informed, they\r\nprohibit the exportation of rough rice, on pain of death. I have taken\r\nmeasures, however, which I think will not fail, for obtaining a quantity\r\nof it, and I bought on the spot a small parcel, which I have with me.\r\nAs further details on this subject to Congress would be misplaced, I\r\npropose, on my return to Paris, to communicate them, and send the rice\r\nto the society at Charleston for promoting agriculture, supposing that\r\nthey will be best able to try the experiment of cultivating the rice of\r\nthis quality, and to communicate the species to the two States of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia, if they find it answers. I thought the staple of\r\nthese two States was entitled to this attention, and that it must be\r\ndesirable to them, to be able to furnish rice of the two qualities\r\ndemanded in Europe, especially, as the greater consumption is in the\r\nforms for which the Lombardy quality is preferred. The mass of our\r\ncountrymen being interested in agriculture, I hope I do not err in\r\nsupposing, that in a time of profound peace, as the present, to enable\r\nthem to adapt their productions to the market, to point out markets for\r\nthem, and endeavor to obtain favorable terms of reception, is within the\r\nline of my duty.\r\n\r\nMy journey into this part of the country has procured me information,\r\nwhich I will take the liberty of communicating to Congress. In October\r\nlast, I received a letter, dated Montpelier, October the 2nd, 1786,\r\nannouncing to me that the writer was a foreigner, who had a matter\r\nof very great consequence to communicate to me, and desired I would\r\nindicate the channel through which it might pass safely. I did so.\r\n\r\nI received soon after, a letter in the following words, omitting only\r\nthe formal parts. [_A translation of it is here given._]\r\n\r\n‘I am a native of Brazil. You are not ignorant of the frightful\r\nslavery under which my country groans. This continually becomes more\r\ninsupportable, since the epoch of your glorious independence; for\r\nthe cruel Portuguese omit nothing which can render our condition more\r\nwretched, from an apprehension that we may follow your example. The\r\nconviction, that these usurpers against the laws of nature and humanity\r\nonly meditate new oppressions, has decided us to follow the guiding\r\nlight which you have held out to us, to break our chains, to revive\r\nour almost expiring liberty, which is nearly overwhelmed by that force,\r\nwhich is the sole foundation of the authority that Europeans exercise\r\nover America. But it is necessary that some power should extend\r\nassistance to the Brazilians, since Spain would certainly unite herself\r\nwith Portugal; and in spite of our advantages for defence, we could not\r\nmake it effectual, or, at least, it would be imprudent to hazard the\r\nattempt, without some assurance of success. In this state of affairs,\r\nSir, we can, with propriety, look only to the United States, not only\r\nbecause we are following her example, but, moreover, because nature, in\r\nmaking us inhabitants of the same continent, has in some sort united\r\nus in the bonds of a common patriotism. On our part, we are prepared to\r\nfurnish the necessary supplies of money, and at all times to acknowledge\r\nthe debt of gratitude due to our benefactors. I have thus, Sir, laid\r\nbefore you a summary of my views. It is in discharge of this commission\r\nthat I have come to France, since I could not effect it in America\r\nwithout exciting suspicion. It now remains for you to decide whether\r\nthose views can be accomplished. Should you desire to consult your\r\nnation on them, it is in my power to give you all the information you\r\nmay require.’\r\n\r\nAs by this time, I had been advised to try the waters of Aix, I wrote\r\nto the gentleman my design, and that I would go off my road as far as\r\nNismes, under the pretext of seeing the antiquities of that place, if\r\nhe would meet me there. He met me, and the following is the sum of the\r\ninformation I received from him. ‘Brazil contains as many inhabitants\r\nas Portugal. They are, 1. Portuguese. 2. Native whites. 3. Black and\r\nmulatto slaves. 4. Indians, civilized and savage. 1. The Portuguese are\r\nfew in number, mostly married there, have lost sight of their native\r\ncountry, as well as the prospect of returning to it, and are disposed to\r\nbecome independent. 2. The native whites form the body of their nation.\r\n3. The slaves are as numerous as the free. 4. The civilized Indians have\r\nno energy, and the savage would not meddle. There are twenty thousand\r\nregular troops. Originally these were Portuguese. But as they died off,\r\nthey were replaced by natives, so that these compose at present the\r\nmass of the troops, and may be counted on by their native country. The\r\nofficers are partly Portuguese, partly Brazilians: their bravery is not\r\ndoubted, and they understand the parade, but not the science of their\r\nprofession. They have no bias for Portugal, but no energy either for any\r\nthing. The priests are partly Portuguese, partly Brazilians, and will\r\nnot interest themselves much. The Noblesse are scarcely known as such.\r\nThey will, in no manner, be distinguished from the people. The men of\r\nletters are those most desirous of a revolution. The people are not\r\nmuch under the influence of their priests, most of them read and write,\r\npossess arms, and are in the habit of using them for hunting. The slaves\r\nwill take the side of their masters. In short, as to the question of\r\nrevolution, there is but one mind in that Country. But there appears no\r\nperson capable of conducting a revolution, or willing to venture himself\r\nat its head, without the aid of some powerful nation, as the people of\r\ntheir own might fail them. There is no printing press in Brazil. They\r\nconsider the North American revolution as a precedent for theirs. They\r\nlook to the United States as most likely to give them honest support,\r\nand, from a variety of considerations, have the strongest prejudices in\r\nour favor. This informant is a native and inhabitant of Rio Janeiro,\r\nthe present metropolis, which contains fifty thousand inhabitants, knows\r\nwell St. Salvador, the former one, and the _mines d’or_, which are\r\nin the centre of the country. These are all for a revolution; and,\r\nconstituting the body of the nation, the other parts will follow them,\r\nThe King’s fifth of the mines, yields annually thirteen millions of\r\ncrusadoes or half dollars. He has the sole right of searching for\r\ndiamonds and other precious stones, which yield him about half as much.\r\nHis income from those two resources alone, then, is about ten millions\r\nof dollars annually; but the remaining part of the produce of the\r\nmines, being twenty-six millions, might be counted on for effecting\r\na revolution. Besides the arms in the hands of the people, there are\r\npublic magazines. They have abundance of horses, but only a part of\r\ntheir country would admit the service of horses. They would want cannon,\r\nammunition, ships, sailors, soldiers, and officers, for which they are\r\ndisposed to look to the United States, it being always understood, that\r\nevery service and furniture will be well paid. Corn costs about\r\ntwenty livres the one hundred pounds. They have flesh in the greatest\r\nabundance, insomuch, that in some parts, they kill beeves for the skin\r\nonly. The whale fishery is carried on by Brazilians altogether, and not\r\nby Portuguese; but in very small vessels, so that the fishermen know\r\nnothing of managing a large ship. They would want of us; at all times,\r\nshipping, corn, and salt fish. The latter is a great article, and they\r\nare at present supplied with it from Portugal. Portugal being without\r\neither army or navy, could not attempt an invasion under a twelvemonth.\r\nConsidering of what it would be composed, it would not be much to be\r\nfeared, and if it failed, they would probably never attempt a second.\r\nIndeed, this source of their wealth being intercepted, they are scarcely\r\ncapable of a first effort. The thinking part of the nation are so\r\nsensible of this, that they consider an early separation inevitable.\r\nThere is an implacable hatred between the Brazilians and Portuguese;\r\nto reconcile which, a former minister adopted the policy of letting\r\nthe Brazilians into a participation of public offices; but subsequent\r\nadministrations have reverted to the ancient policy of keeping the\r\nadministrations in the hands of native Portuguese. There is a mixture\r\nof natives, of the old appointments, still remaining in office. If Spain\r\nshould invade them on their southern extremities, these are so distant\r\nfrom the body of their settlements, that they could not penetrate\r\nthence; and Spanish enterprise is not formidable. The _mines d’or_ are\r\namong mountains, inaccessible to any army; and Rio Janeiro is considered\r\nthe strongest port in the world after Gibraltar. In case of a successful\r\nrevolution, a republican government in a single body would probably be\r\nestablished.’\r\n\r\nI took care to impress on him, through the whole of our conversation,\r\nthat I had neither instructions nor authority to say a word to any\r\nbody on this subject, and that I could only give him my own ideas, as\r\na single individual: which were, that we were not in a condition at\r\npresent to meddle nationally in any war; that we wished particularly to\r\ncultivate the friendship of Portugal, with whom we have an advantageous\r\ncommerce. That yet, a successful revolution in Brazil could not be\r\nuninteresting to us. That prospects of lucre might possibly draw numbers\r\nof individuals to their aid, and purer motives our officers, among whom\r\nare many excellent. That our citizens being free to leave their own\r\ncountry individually, without the consent of their governments, are\r\nequally free to go to any other.\r\n\r\nA little before I received the first letter of the Brazilian, a\r\ngentleman informed me there was a Mexican in Paris, who wished to have\r\nsome conversation with me. He accordingly called on me. The substance of\r\nthe information I drew from him, was as follows. He is himself a native\r\nof Mexico, where his relations are, principally. He left it about\r\nseventeen years of age, and seems now to be about thirty-three or\r\nthirty-four. He classes and characterizes the inhabitants of that\r\ncountry, as follows. 1. The natives of Old Spain, possessed of most of\r\nthe offices of government, and firmly attached to it. 2. The clergy,\r\nequally attached to the government. 3. The natives of Mexico, generally\r\ndisposed to revolt, but without instruction, without energy, and much\r\nunder the dominion of their priests. 4. The slaves, mulatto and black;\r\nthe former enterprising and intelligent, the latter brave, and of very\r\nimportant weight, into whatever scale they throw themselves; but he\r\nthinks they will side with their masters. 5. The conquered Indians,\r\ncowardly, not likely to take any side, nor important which they take. 6.\r\nThe free Indians, brave and formidable, should they interfere, but not\r\nlikely to do so, as being at a great distance. I asked him the numbers\r\nof these several classes, but he could not give them. The first, he\r\nthought very inconsiderable; that the second formed the body of the\r\nfreemen; the third equal to the two first; the fourth, to all the\r\npreceding: and as to the fifth, he could form no idea of their\r\nproportion. Indeed, it appeared to me, that his conjectures as to the\r\nothers were on loose grounds. He said he knew from good information,\r\nthere were three hundred thousand inhabitants in the city of Mexico. I\r\nwas still more cautious with him than with the Brazilian, mentioning\r\nit as my private opinion (unauthorized to say a word on the subject,\r\notherwise), that a successful revolution was still at a distance with\r\nthem; that I feared they must begin by enlightening and emancipating\r\nthe minds of their people; that as to us, if Spain should give us\r\nadvantageous terms of commerce, and remove other difficulties, it was\r\nnot probable that we should relinquish certain and present advantages,\r\nthough smaller, for uncertain and future ones, however great. I was led\r\ninto this caution by observing, that this gentleman was intimate at the\r\nSpanish ambassador’s, and that he was then at Paris, employed by Spain\r\nto settle her boundaries with France, on the Pyrenees. He had much\r\nthe air of candor, but that can be borrowed; so that I was not able to\r\ndecide about him in my own mind.\r\n\r\nLed by a unity of subject, and a desire to give Congress as general a\r\nview of the disposition of our southern countrymen, as my information\r\nenables me, I will add an article which, old and insulated, I did not\r\nthink important enough to mention at the time I received it. You will\r\nremember, Sir, that during the late war, the British papers often\r\ngave details of a rebellion in Peru. The character of those papers\r\ndiscredited the information. But the truth was, that the insurrections\r\nwere so general, that the event was long on the poise. Had Commodore\r\nJohnson, then expected on that coast, touched and landed there two\r\nthousand men, the dominion of Spain in that country would have been at\r\nan end. They only wanted a point of union, which this body would have\r\nconstituted. Not having this, they acted without concert, and were are\r\nlength subdued separately. This conflagration was quenched in blood;\r\ntwo hundred thousand souls, on both sides, having perished; but the\r\nremaining matter is very capable of combustion. I have this information\r\nfrom a person who was on the spot at the time, and whose good faith,\r\nunderstanding, and means of information leave no doubt of the facts. He\r\nobserved, however, that the numbers above supposed to have perished were\r\non such conjectures only as he could collect.\r\n\r\nI trouble Congress with these details, because, however distant we may\r\nbe, both in condition and dispositions, from taking an active part in\r\nany commotions in that country, nature has placed it too near us to\r\nmake its movements altogether indifferent to our interests, or to our\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nI hear of another _Arrêt_ of this court, increasing the duties on\r\nforeign stock-fish, and the premium on their own imported into their\r\nislands; but not having yet seen it, I can say nothing certain on it. I\r\nhope the effect of this policy will be defeated by the practice which,\r\nI am told, takes place on the Banks of Newfoundland, of putting our\r\nfish into the French fishing-boats, and the parties sharing the premium,\r\ninstead of ours paying the duty.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes Mr. Short will be able to send you the medals of General\r\nGates by this packet. I await a general instruction as to these medals.\r\nThe academies of Europe will be much pleased to receive each a set.\r\n\r\nI propose to set out the day after to-morrow for Bordeaux (by the canal\r\nof Languedoc), Mantes, L’Orient, and Paris.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVII.--TO M. GUIDE, May 6, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. GUIDE.\r\n\r\nMarseilles, May 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nA desire of seeing a commerce commenced between the dominions of his\r\nMajesty, the King of Sardinia, and the United States of America, and a\r\ndirect exchange of their respective productions, without passing through\r\na third nation, led me into the conversation which I had the honor of\r\nhaving with you on that subject, and afterwards with Monsieur Tallon at\r\nTurin, to whom I promised that I would explain to you, in writing, the\r\nsubstance of what passed between us. The articles of your produce wanted\r\nwith us are brandies, wines, oil, fruits, and manufactured silks:\r\nthose with which we can furnish you are indigo, potash, tobacco, flour,\r\nsalt-fish, furs and peltries, ships and materials for building them.\r\nThe supply of tobacco, particularly, being in the hands of government\r\nsolely, appeared to me to offer an article for beginning immediately the\r\nexperiment of direct commerce. That of the first quality can be had at\r\nfirst hand only from James river in Virginia; those of the second and\r\nthird from the same place, and from Baltimore in Maryland. The first\r\nquality is delivered in the ports of France at thirty-eight livres\r\nthe quintal, the second at thirty-six livres, the third at thirty-four\r\nlivres, weight and money of France, by individuals generally. I send you\r\nthe copy of a large contract, wherein the three qualities are averaged\r\nat thirty-six livres. They may be delivered at Nice for those prices.\r\nIndeed, it is my opinion, that by making shipments of your own produce\r\nto those places, and buying the tobaccos on the spot, they may be had\r\nmore advantageously. In this case, it would be expedient that merchants\r\nof Nice, Turin, and America, should form a joint concern for conducting\r\nthe business in the two countries. Monsieur Tallon desired me to point\r\nout proper persons in America who might be addressed for this purpose.\r\nThe house of the most extensive reputation, concerned in the tobacco\r\ntrade, and on the firmest funds, is that of Messrs. Ross and Pleasants\r\nat Richmond, in Virginia. If it should be concluded on your part to make\r\nany attempt of this kind, and to address yourselves to these gentlemen,\r\nor any others, it would be best to write them your ideas, and receive\r\ntheirs, before you make either purchases or shipments. A more hasty\r\nconduct might occasion loss, and retard, instead of encouraging, the\r\nestablishment of this commerce. I would undertake to write, at the same\r\ntime, to these or any other merchants whom you should prefer, in order\r\nto dispose them favorably, and as disinterestedly as possible, for the\r\nencouragement of this essay. I must observe to you, that our vessels are\r\nfearful of coming into the Mediterranean on account of the Algerines:\r\nand that if you should freight vessels, those of the French will be most\r\nadvantageous for you, because received into our ports without paying\r\nany duties on some of those articles, and lighter than others on all of\r\nthem. English vessels, on the other hand, are distinguished by paying\r\nheavier duties than those of any other nation. Should you desire any\r\nfurther information, or to pass letters with certainty to any mercantile\r\nhouse in America, do me the favor to address yourselves to me at Paris,\r\nand I shall do whatever depends on me for this object.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of high esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA TAKEN ON A JOURNEY FROM PARIS IN 1787\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memoranda taken on a Journey from Paris into the Southern Parts of\r\nFrance, and Northern of Italy, in the year 1787_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE. March 3. _Sens_ to _Vermanton_. The face of the country is in\r\nlarge hills, not too steep for the plough, somewhat resembling the Elk\r\nhill and Beaver-dam hills of Virginia. The soil is generally a rich\r\nmulatto loam, with a mixture of coarse sand, and some loose stone. The\r\nplains of the Yonne are of the same color. The plains are in corn, the\r\nhills in vineyard, but the wine not good. There are a few apple-trees,\r\nbut none of any other kind, and no enclosures. No cattle, sheep, or\r\nswine; fine mules.\r\n\r\nFew _chateaux_; no farm-houses, all the people being gathered in\r\nvillages. Are they thus collected by that dogma of their religion, which\r\nmakes them believe, that to keep the Creator in good humor with his own\r\nworks, they must mumble a mass every day? Certain it is, that they are\r\nless happy and less virtuous in villages, than they would be insulated\r\nwith their families on the grounds they cultivate. The people are illy\r\nclothed. Perhaps they have put on their worst clothes at this moment, as\r\nit is raining. But I observe women and children carrying heavy burthens,\r\nand laboring with the hoe. This is an unequivocal indication of extreme\r\npoverty. Men, in a civilized country, never expose their wives and\r\nchildren to labor above their force and sex, as long as their own labor\r\ncan protect them from it. I see few beggars. Probably this is the effect\r\nof a police.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY. March 4. _Lucy-le-Bois. Cussy-les-Forges. Rouvray.\r\nMaison-neuve. Vitieaux. La Chaleure. Pont de Panis. Dijon_. The hills\r\nare higher, and more abrupt. The soil a good red loam and sand, mixed\r\nwith more or less grit, small stone, and sometimes rock. All in corn.\r\nSome forest wood here and there, broom, whins, and holly, and a few\r\nenclosures of quick-hedge. Now and then a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\nThe people are well clothed, but it is Sunday. They have the appearance\r\nof being well fed. The Chateau de Sevigny, near Cussy-les-Forges, is\r\na charming situation. Between Maison-neuve and Vitteaux the road leads\r\nthrough an avenue of trees, eight American miles long, in a right line.\r\nIt is impossible to paint the ennui of this avenue. On the summits of\r\nthe hills, which border the valley in which Vitteaux is, there is a\r\nparapet of rock, twenty, thirty, or forty feet perpendicular, which\r\ncrowns the hills. The tops are nearly level, and appear to be covered\r\nwith earth. Very singular. Great masses of rock in the hills between La\r\nChaleure and Pont de Panis, and a conical hill in the approach to the\r\nlast place.\r\n\r\n_Dijon_. The tavern price of a bottle of the best wine (e. g. of Vaune)\r\nis four livres. The best round potatoes here, I ever saw. They have\r\nbegun a canal thirty feet wide, which is to lead into the Saone at\r\n---------. It is fed by springs. They are not allowed to take any water\r\nout of the riviere d’Ouche, which runs through this place, on account of\r\nthe mills on that river. They talk of making a canal to the Seine, the\r\nnearest navigable part of which, at present, is fifteen leagues from\r\nhence. They have very light wagons here for the transportation of their\r\nwine. They are long and narrow; the fore-wheels as high as the hind. Two\r\npieces of wine are drawn by one horse in one of these wagons. The road\r\nin this part of the country is divided into portions of forty or fifty\r\nfeet by stones, numbered, which mark the task of the laborers.\r\n\r\nMarch 7 and 8. From _La Baraque_ to _Chagny_. On the left are plains,\r\nwhich extend to the Saone; on the right the ridge of mountains, called\r\nthe Cote. The plains are of a reddish-brown, rich loam, mixed with much\r\nsmall stone. The Cote has for its basis a solid rock, on which is about\r\na foot of soil and small stone, in equal quantities, the soil red, and\r\nof middling quality. The plains are in corn; the Cote in vines. The\r\nformer have no enclosures, the latter is in small ones, of dry stone\r\nwall. There is a good deal of forest. Some small herds of small cattle\r\nand sheep. Fine mules, which come from Provence, and cost twenty louis.\r\nThey break them at two years old, and they last to thirty.\r\n\r\nThe corn-lands here rent for about fifteen livres the arpent. They are\r\nnow planting, pruning, and sticking their vines. When a new vineyard\r\nis made, they plant the vines in gutters about four feet apart. As the\r\nvines advance, they lay them down. They put out new shoots, and fill\r\nall the intermediate space, till all trace of order is lost. They have\r\nultimately about one foot square to each vine. They begin to yield good\r\nprofit at five or six years old, and last one hundred, or one hundred\r\nand fifty years. A vigneron at Volnay carried me into his vineyard,\r\nwhich was of about ten arpents. He told me, that some years it produced\r\nhim sixty pieces of wine, and some not more than three pieces. The\r\nlatter is the most advantageous produce, because the wine is better in\r\nquality, and higher in price, in proportion as less is made; and the\r\nexpenses, at the same time, diminish in the same proportion. Whereas,\r\nwhen much is made, the expenses are increased, while the quality and\r\nprice become less. In very plentiful years, they often give one half the\r\nwine for casks to contain the other half. The cask for two hundred and\r\nfifty bottles costs six livres in scarce years, and ten in plentiful.\r\nThe feuillette is of one hundred and twenty-five bottles, the piece of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty, and the queue or botte of five hundred. An arpent\r\nrents at from twenty to sixty livres. A farmer of ten arpents has about\r\nthree laborers engaged by the year. He pays four louis to a man, and\r\nhalf as much to a woman, and feeds them. He kills one hog, and salts it,\r\nwhich is all the meat used in the family during the year. Their ordinary\r\nfood is bread and vegetables. At Pomard and Volnay, I observed them\r\neating good wheat bread; at Meursault, rye. I asked the reason of the\r\ndifference. They told me, that the white wines fail in quality much\r\noftener than the red, and remain on hand. The farmer, therefore, cannot\r\nafford to feed his laborers so well. At Meursault only white wines\r\nare made, because there is too much stone for the red. On such slight\r\ncircumstances depends the condition of man! The wines which have given\r\nsuch celebrity to Burgundy grow only on the Cote, an extent of about\r\nfive leagues long, and half a league wide. They begin at Chambertin,\r\nand go through Vougeau, Romanie, Veaune, Nuits, Beaune, Pomard, Volnay,\r\nMeursault, and end at Monrachet. Those of the two last are white; the\r\nothers red. Chambertin, Vougeau, and Beaune are the strongest, and will\r\nbear transportation and keeping. They sell, therefore, on the spot for\r\ntwelve hundred livres the queue, which is forty-eight sous the bottle.\r\nVolnay is the best of the other reds, equal in flavor to Chambertin,\r\n&c., but being lighter, will not keep, and therefore sells for not more\r\nthan three hundred livres the queue, which is twelve sous the bottle.\r\nIt ripens sooner than they do, and consequently is better for those who\r\nwish to broach at a year old. In like manner of the white wines, and\r\nfor the same reason, Monrachet sells for twelve hundred livres the queue\r\n(forty-eight sous the bottle), and Meursault of the best quality, viz.\r\nthe _Goutte d’or_, at only one hundred and fifty livres (six sous the\r\nbottle). It is remarkable, that the best of each kind, that is, of\r\nthe red and white, is made at the extremities of the line, to wit, at\r\nChambertin and Monrachet. It is pretended, that the adjoining vineyards\r\nproduce the same qualities, but that, belonging to obscure individuals,\r\nthey have not obtained a name, and therefore sell as other wines. The\r\naspect of the Cote is a little south of east. The western side is also\r\ncovered with vines, and is apparently of the same soil; yet the wines\r\nare only of the coarsest kinds. Such, too, are those which are produced\r\nin the plains; but there the soil is richer, and less strong. Vougeau\r\nis the property of the monks of Citeaux, and produces about two hundred\r\npieces. Monrachet contains about fifty arpents, and produces, one year\r\nwith another, about one hundred and twenty pieces. It belongs to\r\ntwo proprietors only, Monsieur de Clarmont, who leases to some\r\nwine-merchants, and the Marquis de Sarsnet, of Dijon, whose part is\r\nfarmed to a Monsieur de la Tour, whose family, for many generations,\r\nhave had the farm. The best wines are carried to Paris by land. The\r\ntransportation costs thirty-six livres the piece. The more indifferent\r\ngo by water. Bottles cost four and a half sous each.\r\n\r\nMarch 9. _Chalons. Sennecey. Tournus. St. Albin. Macon._ On the left are\r\nthe fine plains of the Saone; on the right high lands, rather waving\r\nthan hilly, sometimes sloping gently to the plains, sometimes dropping\r\ndown in precipices, and occasionally broken into beautiful vallies[sp.]\r\nby the streams which run into the Saone. The plains are a dark rich\r\nloam, in pasture and corn; the heights more or less red or reddish,\r\nalways gritty, of middling quality only, their sides in vines, and their\r\nsummits in corn. The vineyards are enclosed with dry stone-walls, and\r\nthere are some quick-hedges in the corn-grounds. The cattle are few and\r\nindifferent. There are some good oxen, however. They draw by the head.\r\nFew sheep, and small. A good deal of wood-lands.\r\n\r\nI passed three times the canal called Le Charollois, which they are\r\nopening from Chalons on the Saone to Dijon on the Loire. It passes near\r\nChagny, and will be twenty-three leagues long. They have worked on it\r\nthree years, and will finish it in four more. It will reanimate the\r\nlanguishing commerce of Champagne and Burgundy, by furnishing a water\r\ntransportation for their wines to Nantes, which also will receive new\r\nconsequence by becoming the emporium of that commerce. At some distance\r\non the right are high mountains, which probably form the separation\r\nbetween the waters of the Saone and Loire. Met a malefactor in the hands\r\nof one of the Marichausee; perhaps a dove in the talons of the hawk. The\r\npeople begin now to be in separate establishments, and not in villages.\r\nHouses are mostly covered with tile.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUJOLOIS.[Sp.] _Maison Blanche. St. George. Chateau de Laye-Epinaye_.\r\nThe face of the country is like that from Chalons to Macon. The plains\r\nare a dark rich loam, the hills a red loam of middling quality, mixed\r\ngenerally with more or less coarse sand and grit, and a great deal of\r\nsmall stone. Very little forest. The vineyards are mostly enclosed with\r\ndry stone-wall. A few small cattle and sheep. Here, as in Burgundy, the\r\ncattle are all white. This is the richest country I ever beheld. It\r\nis about ten or twelve leagues in length, and three, four, or five\r\nin breadth; at least that part of it, which is under the eye of a\r\ntraveller. It extends from the top of a ridge of mountains, running\r\nparallel with the Saone, and sloping down to the plains of that river,\r\nscarce any where too steep for the plough. The whole is thick set with\r\nfarm-houses, chateaux, and the bastides of the inhabitants of Lyons. The\r\npeople live separately, and not in villages. The hill-sides are in vine\r\nand corn: the plains in corn and pasture. The lands are farmed either\r\nfor money, or on half-stocks. The rents of the corn-lands, farmed for\r\nmoney, are about ten or twelve livres the arpent. A farmer takes perhaps\r\nabout one hundred and fifty arpents, for three, six, or nine years. The\r\nfirst year they are in corn; the second in other small grain, with\r\nwhich he sows red clover. The third is for the clover. The spontaneous\r\npasturage is of greensward, which they call fromenteau. When lands\r\nare rented on half-stocks, the cattle, sheep, &c. are furnished by the\r\nlandlord. They are valued, and must be left of equal value. The increase\r\nof these, as well as the produce of the farm is divided equally.\r\nThese leases are only from year to year. They have a method of mixing\r\nbeautifully the culture of vines, trees, and corn. Rows of fruit-trees\r\nare planted about twenty feet apart. Between the trees, in the row, they\r\nplant vines four feet apart, and espalier them. The intervals are sowed\r\nalternately in corn, so as to be one year in corn, the next in pasture,\r\nthe third in corn, the fourth in pasture, &c. One hundred toises of\r\nvines in length, yield generally about four pieces of wine. In Dauphine,\r\nI am told, they plant vines only at the roots of the trees, and let\r\nthem cover the whole trees. But this spoils both the wine and the fruit.\r\nTheir wine, when distilled, yields but one-third its quantity in brandy.\r\nThe wages of a laboring man here are five louis; of a woman, one half.\r\nThe women do not work with the hoe: they only weed the vines, the corn,\r\n&c, and spin. They speak a patois very difficult to understand. I\r\npassed some time at the Chateau de Laye-Epinaye. Monsieur de Laye has a\r\nseignory of about fifteen thousand arpents, in pasture, corn, vines,\r\nand wood. He has over this, as is usual, a certain jurisdiction,\r\nboth criminal and civil. But this extends only to the first crude\r\nexamination, which is before his judges. The subject is referred,\r\nfor final examination and decision, to the regular judicatures of the\r\ncountry. The Seigneur is keeper of the peace on his domains. He\r\nis therefore subject to the expenses of maintaining it. A criminal\r\nprosecuted to sentence and execution costs M. de Laye about five\r\nthousand livres. This is so burthensome to the Seigneurs, that they are\r\nslack in criminal prosecutions. A good effect from a bad cause. Through\r\nall Champagne, Burgundy, and the Beaujolois, the husbandry seems good,\r\nexcept that they manure too little. This proceeds from the shortness of\r\ntheir leases. The people of Burgundy and Beaujolois are well clothed,\r\nand have the appearance of being well fed. But they experience all the\r\noppressions which result from the nature of the general government, and\r\nfrom that of their particular tenures, and of the seignorial government\r\nto which they are subject. What a cruel reflection, that a rich country\r\ncannot long be a free one. M. de Laye has a Diana and Endymion, a very\r\nsuperior morsel of sculpture by Michael Angelo Slodtz, done in 1740. The\r\nwild gooseberry is in leaf; the wild pear and sweet-briar in bud.\r\n\r\n_Lyons_. There are some feeble remains here of an amphitheatre of two\r\nhundred feet diameter, and of an aqueduct in brick. The Pont d’Ainay has\r\nnine arches of forty feet from centre to centre. The piers are of six\r\nfeet. The almond is in bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAUPHINE. From _St. Fond_ to _Mornant_. March 15, 16, 17, 18. The Rhone\r\nmakes extensive plains, which lie chiefly on the eastern side, and are\r\noften in two stages. Those of Montelimart are three,or four miles wide,\r\nand rather good. Sometimes, as in the neighborhood of Vienne, the\r\nhills come in precipices to the river, resembling then very much our\r\nSusquehanna and its hill, except that the Susquehanna is ten times as\r\nwide as the Rhone. The highlands are often very level. The soil both of\r\nhill and plain, where there is soil, is generally tinged, more or less,\r\nwith red. The hills are sometimes mere masses of rock, sometimes a\r\nmixture of loose stone and earth. The plains are always stony, and as\r\noften as otherwise covered perfectly with a coat of round stones, of\r\nthe size of the fist, so as to resemble the remains of inundations, from\r\nwhich all the soil has been carried away. Sometimes they are middling\r\ngood, sometimes barren. In the neighborhood of Lyons there is more corn\r\nthan wine. Towards Tains more wine than corn. From thence the plains,\r\nwhere best, are in corn, clover, almonds, mulberries, walnuts: where\r\nthere is still some earth, they are in corn, almonds, and oaks. The\r\nhills are in vines. There is a good deal of forest-wood near Lyons,\r\nbut not much afterwards. Scarcely any enclosures. There are a few small\r\nsheep before we reach Tains; there the’number increases.\r\n\r\nNature never formed a country of more savage aspect, than that on\r\nboth sides the Rhone. A huge torrent rushes like an arrow between high\r\nprecipices, often of massive rock, at other times of loose stone, with\r\nbut little earth. Yet has the hand of man subdued this savage scene, by\r\nplanting corn where there is a little fertility, trees where there is\r\nstill less, and vines where there is none. On the whole, it assumes a\r\nromantic, picturesque, and pleasing air. The hills on the opposite\r\nside of the river, being high, steep, and laid up in terraces, are of\r\na singular appearance. Where the hills are quite in waste, they are\r\ncovered with broom, whins, box, and some clusters of small pines. The\r\nhigh mountains of Dauphine and Languedoc are now covered with snow. The\r\nalmond is in general bloom, and the willow putting out its leaf. There\r\nwere formerly olives at Tain; but a great cold, some years ago, killed\r\nthem, and they have not been replanted. I am told at Montelimart, that\r\nan almond tree yields about three livres profit a year. Supposing them\r\nthree toises apart, there will be one hundred to the arpent, which\r\ngives three hundred livres a year, besides the corn growing on the same\r\nground. A league below Vienne, on the opposite side of the river, is\r\nCote Rotie. It is a string of broken hills, extending a league on the\r\nriver, from the village of Ampuis to the town of Condrieu. The soil\r\nis white, tinged a little, sometimes, with yellow, sometimes with red,\r\nstony, poor, and laid up in terraces. Those parts of the hills only,\r\nwhich look to the sun at mid-day, or the earlier hours of the afternoon,\r\nproduce wines of the first quality. Seven hundred vines, three feet\r\napart, yield a _feuillette_, which is about two and a half _pièces_,\r\nto the arpent. The best red wine is produced at the upper end, in the\r\nneighborhood of Ampuis; the best white, next to Condrieu. They sell of\r\nthe first quality and last vintage, at one hundred and fifty livres the\r\n_pièce_, equal to twelve sous the bottle. Transportation to Paris is\r\nsixty livres, and the bottle four sous; so it may be delivered at Paris\r\nin bottles, at twenty sous. When old, it costs ten or eleven louis the\r\n_pièce_. There is a quality which keeps well, bears transportation, and\r\ncannot be drunk under four years. Another must be drunk at a year old.\r\nThey are equal in flavor and price.\r\n\r\nThe wine called Hermitage, is made on the hills impending over the\r\nvillage of Tain; on one of which is the hermitage which gives name to\r\nthe hills for about two miles, and to the wine made on them. There are\r\nbut three of those hills which produce wine of the first quality, and\r\nof these, the middle regions only. They are about three hundred feet\r\nperpendicular height, three quarters of a mile in length, and have a\r\nsouthern aspect. The soil is scarcely tinged red, consists of small\r\nrotten stone, and is, where the best wine is made, without any\r\nperceptible mixture of earth. It is in sloping terraces. They use a\r\nlittle dung. An _homme de vignes_, which consists of seven hundred\r\nplants, three feet apart, yields generally about three quarters of a\r\n_pièce_, which is nearly four _pièces_ to the arpent. When new, the\r\npièce is sold at about two hundred and twenty-five livres; when old, at\r\nthree hundred. It cannot be drunk under four years, and improves fastest\r\nin a hot situation. There is so little white made in proportion to the\r\nred, that it is difficult to buy it separate. They make the white sell\r\nthe red. If bought separately, it is from fifteen to sixteen louis the\r\npièce, new, and three livres the bottle, old. To give quality to\r\nthe red, they mix one eighth of white grapes. Portage to Paris is\r\nseventy-two livres the pièce, weighing six hundred pounds. There are but\r\nabout one thousand _pièces_ of both red and white, of the first quality,\r\nmade annually. Vineyards are never rented here, nor are laborers in the\r\nvineyard hired by the year. They leave buds proportioned to the strength\r\nof the vine, sometimes as much as fifteen inches. The last hermit died\r\nin 1751.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Montelimart, and below that, they plant vines in\r\nrows, six, eight, or ten feet apart, and two feet asunder in the row,\r\nfilling the intervals with corn. Sometimes the vines are in double rows,\r\ntwo feet apart. I saw single asses in ploughs proportioned to their\r\nstrength. There are few chateaux in this province. The people, too,\r\nare mostly gathered into villages. There are, however, some scattering\r\nfarm-houses. These are made either of mud, or of round stone and mud.\r\nThey make enclosures also, in both those ways. Day-laborers receive,\r\nsixteen or eighteen sous the day, and feed themselves. Those by the year\r\nreceive, men three louis, women half that, and are fed. They rarely eat\r\nmeat; a single hog, salted, being the year’s stock for a family. But\r\nthey have plenty of cheese, eggs, potatoes, and other vegetables, and\r\nwalnut oil with their salad. It is a trade here, to gather dung along\r\nthe road for their vines. This proves they have few cattle. I have seen\r\nneither hares nor partridges since I left Paris, nor wild fowl on any\r\nof the rivers. The roads from Lyons to St. Rambert are neither paved\r\nnor gravelled. After that, they are coated with broken flint. The\r\nferry-boats on the Rhone and the Isere, are moved by the stream, and\r\nvery rapidly. On each side of the river is a moveable stage, one end of\r\nwhich is on an axle and two wheels, which, according to the tide, can\r\nbe advanced or withdrawn, so as to apply to the gunwale of the boat. The\r\nPraetorian Palace at Vienne, is forty-four feet wide, of the Corinthian\r\norder, four columns in front, and four in flank. It was begun in the\r\nyear 400, and finished by Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nThe sepulchral Pyramid, a little way out of the town, has an order for\r\nits basement, the pedestal of which, from point to point of its cap,\r\nis twenty-four feet, one inch. At each angle, is a column, engaged one\r\nfourth in the wall. The circumference of the three fourths disengaged,\r\nis four feet four inches; consequently, the diameter is twenty-three\r\ninches. The base of the column indicates it to be Ionic, but the\r\ncapitals are not formed. The cornice, too, is a bastard Ionic, without\r\nmodillions or dentils. Between the columns, on each side, is an arch of\r\neight feet, four inches, opening with a pilaster on each side of it. On\r\nthe top of the basement is a zocle, in the plane of the frieze below.\r\nOn that is the pyramid, its base in the plane of the collarins of the\r\npilaster below. The pyramid is a little truncated on its top. This\r\nmonument is inedited.\r\n\r\nMarch 18. _Principality of Orange_. The plains on the Rhone here, are\r\ntwo or three leagues wide, reddish, good, in corn, clover, almonds,\r\nolives. No forests. Here begins the country of olives, there being very\r\nfew till we enter this principality. They are the only tree which I see\r\nplanted among vines. Thyme grows wild here on the hills. Asses, very\r\nsmall, sell here for two or three louis. The high hills in Dauphine are\r\ncovered with snow. The remains of the Roman aqueduct are of brick: a\r\nfine pièce of Mosaic, still on its bed, forming the floor of a cellar.\r\nTwenty feet of it still visible. They are taking down the circular wall\r\nof the Amphitheatre to pave a road.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 19 to 23. LANGUEDOC. _Pont-St.-Esprit. Bagnols. Connaux.\r\nValignitres. Remoulins. St. Gervasy. Vismes. Pont d’Aries._ To\r\nRemoulins, there is a mixture of hill and dale. Thence to Nismes, hills\r\non the right, on the left, plains extending to the Rhone and the sea.\r\nThe hills are rocky. Where there is soil, it is reddish and poor. The\r\n-plains generally reddish and good, but stony. When you approach the\r\nRhone, going to Arles, the soil becomes a dark gray loam with some sand,\r\nand very good. The culture is corn, clover, saintfoin, olives, vines,\r\nmulberries, willow, and some almonds. There is no forest. The hills are\r\nenclosed in dry stone-wall. Many sheep.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the first hill, after leaving Pont-St.-Esprit, there\r\nis a beautiful view of the bridge at about two miles’ distance, and a\r\nfine landscape of the country both ways. From thence, an excellent\r\nroad, judiciously conducted, through very romantic scenes. In one part,\r\ndescending the face of a hill, it is laid out in serpentine, and not\r\nzigzag, to ease the descent. In others, it passes through a winding\r\nmeadow, from fifty to one hundred yards wide, walled, as it were, on\r\nboth sides, by hills of rock; and at length issues into plain country.\r\nThe waste hills are covered with thyme, box, and chene-vert. Where the\r\nbody of the mountains has a surface of soil, the summit has sometimes a\r\ncrown of rock, as observed in Champagne. At Nismes, the earth is full of\r\nlime-stone. The horses are shorn. They are now pruning the olive. A very\r\ngood tree produces sixty pounds of olives, which yield fifteen pounds of\r\noil: the best quality selling at twelve sous the pound, retail, and ten\r\nsous, wholesale. The high hills of Languedoc still covered with snow.\r\nThe horse-chestnut and mulberry are leafing; apple trees and peas\r\nblossoming. The first butterfly I have seen. After the vernal equinox,\r\nthey are often six or eight months without rain. Many separate\r\nfarm-houses, numbers of people in rags, and abundance of beggars. The\r\n_mine_ of wheat, weighing thirty pounds, costs four livres and ten\r\nsous. Wheat bread, three sous the pound. _Vin ordinaire_, good, and of\r\na strong body, two or three sous the bottle. Oranges, one sous\r\napiece. They are nearly finishing at Nismes a great mill, worked by a\r\nsteam-engine, which pumps water from a lower into an upper cistern, from\r\nwhence two overshot wheels are supplied, each of which turns two pair\r\nof stones. The upper cistern being once filled with water, it passes\r\nthrough the wheels into the lower one, from whence it is returned to the\r\nupper by the pumps. A stream of water of one quarter or one half inch\r\ndiameter, supplies the waste of evaporation, absorption, fee. This is\r\nfurnished from a well by a horse. The arches of the Pont-St.-Esprit\r\nare of eighty-eight feet. Wild figs, very flourishing, grow out of the\r\njoints of the Pont-du-Gard. The fountain of Nismes is so deep, that a\r\nstone was thirteen seconds descending from the surface to the bottom.\r\n\r\nMarch 24. From Nismes to Arles. The plains extending from Nismes to the\r\nRhone, in the direction of Aries, are broken in one place by a skirt\r\nof low hills. They are red and stony at first, but as you approach the\r\nRhone, they are of a dark gray mould, with a little sand, and very good.\r\nThey are in corn and clover, vines, olives, almonds, mulberries, and\r\nwillow. There are some sheep, no wood, no enclosures.\r\n\r\nThe high hills of Languedoc are covered with snow. At an ancient church,\r\nin the suburbs of Aries, are some hundreds of ancient stone coffins,\r\nalong the road-side. The ground is thence called _Les Champs Elysees_.\r\nIn a vault in a church, are some curiously wrought, and in a back yard\r\nare many ancient statues, inscriptions, &c. Within the town are a part\r\nof two Corinthian columns, and of the pediment with which they were\r\ncrowned, very rich, having belonged to the ancient capitol of the place.\r\n\r\nBut the principal monument here, is an amphitheatre, the external\r\nportico of which is tolerably complete. How many porticoes there were,\r\ncannot be seen; but at one of the principal gates there are still five,\r\nmeasuring, from out to in, seventy-eight feet, ten inches, the vault\r\ndiminishing inwards. There are sixty-four arches, each of which is, from\r\ncentre to centre, twenty feet, six inches. Of course, the diameter is of\r\nfour hundred and thirty-eight feet; or of four hundred and fifty feet,\r\nif we suppose the four principal arches a little larger than the rest.\r\nThe ground floor is supported on innumerable vaults. The first story,\r\nexternally, has a tall pedestal, like a pilaster, between every two\r\narches; the upper story, a column, the base of which would indicate it\r\nCorinthian. Every column is truncated as low as the impost of the arch,\r\nbut the arches are all entire. The whole of the upper entablature is\r\ngone, and of the Attic, if there was one. Not a single seat of the\r\ninternal is visible. The whole of the inside, and nearly the whole\r\nof the outside, is masked by buildings. It is supposed there are one\r\nthousand inhabitants within the amphitheatre. The walls are more entire\r\nand firm than those of the _ampitheatre_ at Nismes. I suspect its plan and\r\ndistribution to have been very different from that.\r\n\r\n_Terrasson_. The plains of the Rhone from Arles to this place, are\r\na league or two wide; the mould is of a dark gray, good, in corn and\r\nlucerne. Neither wood, nor enclosures. Many sheep.\r\n\r\n_St. Remy_. From Terrasson to St. Remy, is a plain of a league or two\r\nwide, bordered by broken hills of massive rock. It is gray and stony,\r\nmostly in olives. Some almonds, mulberries, willows, vines, corn, and\r\nlucerne. Many sheep. No forest, nor enclosures.\r\n\r\nA laboring man’s wages here, are one hundred and fifty livres, a woman’s\r\nhalf, and fed. Two hundred and eighty pounds of wheat sell for forty-two\r\nlivres. They make no butter here. It costs, when brought, fifteen sous\r\nthe pound. Oil is ten sous the pound. Tolerably good olive trees yield,\r\none with another, about twenty pounds of oil. An olive tree must be\r\ntwenty years old before it has paid its own expenses. It lasts for ever.\r\nIn 1765, it was so cold, that the Rhone was frozen over at Aries for two\r\nmonths. In 1767, there was a cold spell of a week, which killed all the\r\nolive trees. From being fine weather, in one hour there was ice hard\r\nenough to bear a horse. It killed people on the road. The old roots of\r\nthe olive trees put out again. Olive grounds sell for twenty-four livres\r\na tree, and lease at twenty-four sous the tree. The trees are fifteen\r\npieds apart. But lucerne is a more profitable culture. An arpent yields\r\none hundred quintals of hay a year, worth three livres the quintal.\r\nIt is cut four or five times a year. It is sowed in the broadcast, and\r\nlasts five or six years. An arpent of ground for corn rents at from\r\nthirty to thirty-six livres. Their leases are for six or nine years.\r\nThey plant willow for fire-wood, and for hoops to their casks. It\r\nseldom rains here in summer. There are some chateaux, many separate\r\nfarm-houses, good, and ornamented in the small way, so as to show\r\nthat the tenant’s whole time is not occupied in procuring physical\r\nnecessaries.\r\n\r\nMarch 25. _Orgon. Pontroyal. St. Cannat_. From Orgon to Pontroyal, after\r\nquitting the plains of the Rhone, the country seems still to be a plain,\r\ncut into compartments by chains of mountains of massive rock, running\r\nthrough it in various directions. From Pontroyal to St. Cannat, the land\r\nlies rather in basins. The soil is very various, gray and clay, gray and\r\nstony, red and stony; sometimes good, sometimes middling, often barren.\r\nWe find some golden willows. Towards Pontroyal, the hills begin to be\r\nin vines and afterwards in some pasture of greensward and clover. About\r\nOrgon are some enclosures of quick-set, others of conical yews planted\r\nclose. Towards St. Cannat, they begin to be of stone.\r\n\r\nThe high mountains are covered with snow. Some separate farm-houses of\r\nmud. Near Pontroyal is a canal for watering the country; one branch goes\r\nto Terrasson, the other to Arles.\r\n\r\nMarch 25, 26, 27, 28. _Aix_. The country is waving, in vines, pasture\r\nof greensward and clover, much enclosed with stone, and abounding with\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nOn approaching Aix, the valley which opens from thence towards the mouth\r\nof the Rhone and the sea, is rich and beautiful; a perfect grove of\r\nolive trees, mixed among which are corn, lucerne, and vines. The waste\r\ngrounds throw out thyme and lavender. Wheat bread is three sous the\r\npound. Cow’s milk sixteen sous the quart, sheep’s milk six sous, butter\r\nof sheep’s milk twenty sous the pound. Oil, of the best quality, is\r\ntwelve sous the pound, and sixteen sous if it be virgin oil. This\r\nis what runs from the olive when put into the press, spontaneously;\r\nafterwards they are forced by the press and by hot water. Dung costs ten\r\nsous the one hundred pounds. Their fire-wood is chene-vert and willow.\r\nThe latter is lopped every three years. An ass sells for from one to\r\nthree louis; the best mules for thirty louis. The best asses will carry\r\ntwo hundred pounds; the best horses three hundred pounds; the best mules\r\nsix hundred pounds. The temperature of the mineral waters of Aix is 90°\r\nof Fahrenheit’s thermometer, at the spout. A mule eats half as much as\r\na horse. The allowance to an ass for the day, is a handful of bran mixed\r\nwith straw. The price of mutton and beef, about six and a half sous the\r\npound. The beef comes from Auvergne, and is poor and bad. The mutton\r\nis small, but of excellent flavor. The wages of a laboring man are one\r\nhundred and fifty livres the year, a woman’s sixty to sixty-six livres,\r\nand fed. Their bread is half wheat, half rye, made once in three or four\r\nweeks, to prevent too great a consumption. In the morning they eat bread\r\nwith an anchovy, or an onion. Their dinner in the middle of the day\r\nis bread, soup, and vegetables. Their supper the same. With their\r\nvegetables, they have always oil and vinegar. The oil costs about eight\r\nsous the pound. They drink what is called _piquette_. This is made after\r\nthe grapes are pressed, by pouring hot water on the pumice. On Sunday\r\nthey have meat and wine. Their wood for building comes mostly from the\r\nAlps, down the Durance and Rhone. A stick of pine, fifty feet long,\r\ngirting six feet and three inches at one end, and three feet three\r\ninches at the other, costs, delivered here, from fifty-four to sixty\r\nlivres. Sixty pounds of wheat cost seven livres. One of their little\r\nasses will travel with his burthen about five or six leagues a day, and\r\nday by day; a mule from six to eight leagues.*\r\n\r\n     * It is twenty American miles from Aix to Marseilles, and\r\n     they call it five leagues. Their league, then, is of four\r\n     American miles.\r\n\r\nMarch 29. Marseilles. The country is hilly, intersected by chains of\r\nhills and mountains of massive rock. The soil is reddish, stony, and\r\nindifferent where best. Wherever there is any soil, it is covered\r\nwith olives. Among these are corn, vines, some lucerne, mulberry, some\r\nalmonds, and willow. Neither enclosures, nor forest. A very few sheep.\r\n\r\nOn the road I saw one of those little whirlwinds which we have in\r\nVirginia, also some gullied hill-sides. The people are in separate\r\nestablishments. Ten morning observations of the thermometer, from the\r\n20th to the 31st of March inclusive, made at Nismes, St. Remy, Aix,\r\nand Marseilles, give me an average of 52 1/2°, and 46° and 61°, for the\r\ngreatest and least morning heats. Nine afternoon observations, yield an\r\naverage of 62 2/3°, and 57° and 66°, the greatest and least. The longest\r\nday here, from sunrise to sunset, is fifteen hours and fourteen minutes;\r\nthe shortest is eight hours and forty-six minutes; the latitude being\r\n---------.\r\n\r\nThere are no tides in the Mediterranean. It is observed to me, that the\r\nolive tree grows nowhere more than thirty leagues distant from that sea.\r\nI suppose, however, that both Spain and Portugal furnish proofs to the\r\ncontrary, and doubt its truth as to Asia, Africa, and America. They are\r\nsix or eight months at a time, here, without rain. The most delicate\r\nfigs known in Europe, are those growing about this place, called _figues\r\nMarseilloises_, or _les veritables Marseilloises_, to distinguish them\r\nfrom others of inferior quality growing here. These keep any length of\r\ntime. All others exude a sugar in the spring of the year, and become\r\nsour. The only process for preserving them, is drying them in the sun,\r\nwithout putting any thing to them whatever. They sell at fifteen sous\r\nthe pound, while there are others as cheap as five sous the pound. I\r\nmeet here a small dried grape from Smyrna, without a seed. There are few\r\nof the plants growing in this neighborhood. The best grape for drying,\r\nknown here, is called _des Panses_. They are very large, with a thick\r\nskin and much juice. They are best against a wall of southern aspect, as\r\ntheir abundance of juice requires a great deal of sun to dry it. Pretty\r\ngood fig trees are about the size of the apricot tree, and yield about\r\ntwenty pounds of figs when dry, each. But the largest will yield the\r\nvalue of a louis. They are sometimes fifteen inches in diameter. It is\r\nsaid that the Marseilles fig degenerates when transported into any other\r\npart of the country. The leaves of the mulberry tree will sell for about\r\nthree livres, the purchaser gathering them. The caper is a creeping\r\nplant. It is killed to the roots every winter. In the spring it puts out\r\nbranches, which creep to the distance of three feet from the centre. The\r\nfruit forms on the stem, as that extends itself, and must be gathered\r\nevery day, as it forms. This is the work of women. The pistache grows in\r\nthis neighborhood also, but not very good. They eat them in their milky\r\nstate. Monsieur de Bergasse has a wine-cellar two hundred and forty\r\n_pieds_ long, in which are one hundred and twenty tons, of from fifty to\r\none hundred _pièces_ each. These tons are twelve _pieds_ diameter, the\r\nstaves four inches thick, the heading two and a half _pouces_ thick. The\r\ntemperature of his cellar is of 9 1/2° of Reaumur. The best method of\r\npacking wine, when bottled, is to lay the bottles on their side, and\r\ncover them with sand. The 2d of April, the young figs are formed; the\r\n4th we have Windsor beans. They have had asparagus ever since the middle\r\nof March. The 5th, I see strawberries and the Guelder rose in blossom.\r\nTo preserve the raisin, it is first dipped into ley, and then dried in\r\nthe sun. The aloe grows in the open ground. I measure a mule, not\r\nthe largest, five feet and two inches high. Marseilles is in an\r\namphitheatre, at the mouth of the Veaune, surrounded by high mountains\r\nof naked rock, distant two or three leagues. The country within that\r\namphitheatre is a mixture of small hills, vallies, and plains. The\r\nlatter are naturally rich. The hills and vallies are forced into\r\nproduction. Looking from the _Chateau de Notre Dame de la Garde_, it\r\nwould seem as if there was a _bastide_ for every arpent. The plain-lands\r\nsell for one hundred louis the _carterelle_, which is less than an acre.\r\nThe ground of the arsenal in Marseilles sold for from fifteen to forty\r\nlouis the square verge, being nearly the square yard English. In the\r\nfields open to the sea, they are obliged to plant rows of canes, every\r\nhere and there, to break the force of the wind. Saw at the Chateau\r\nBorelli pumps worked by the wind.\r\n\r\nApril 6. From _Marseilles_ to _Aubagne_. A valley on the Veaune,\r\nbordered on each side by high mountains of massive rock, on which\r\nare only some small pines. The interjacent valley is of small hills,\r\nvallies, and plains, reddish, gravelly, and originally poor, but\r\nfertilized by art, and covered with corn, vines, olives, figs, almonds,\r\nmulberries, lucerne, and clover. The river is twelve or fifteen feet\r\nwide, one or two feet deep, and rapid.\r\n\r\nFrom _Aubagne_ to _Cuges, Beausset, Toulon_. The road, quitting the\r\nVeaune and its wealthy valley, a little after Aubagne, enters those\r\nmountains of rock, and is engaged with them about a dozen miles. Then it\r\npasses six or eight miles through a country still very hilly and stony,\r\nbut laid up in terraces, covered with olives, vines, and corn. It\r\nthen follows for two or three miles a hollow between two of those\r\nhigh mountains, which has been, found or made by a small stream.\r\nThe mountains then reclining a little from their perpendicular, and\r\npresenting a coat of soil, reddish, and tolerably good, have given place\r\nto the little village of Olioules, in the gardens of which are oranges\r\nin the open ground. It continues hilly till we enter the plain of\r\nToulon. On different parts of this road there are figs in the open\r\nfields. At Cuges is a plain of about three fourths of a mile diameter,\r\nsurrounded by high mountains of rock. In this the caper is principally\r\ncultivated. The soil is mulatto, gravelly, and of middling quality, or\r\nrather indifferent. The plants are set in _quincunx_, about eight feet\r\napart. They have been covered during winter by a hill of earth a foot\r\nhigh. They are now enclosing, pruning, and ploughing them.\r\n\r\n_Toulon_. From Olioules to Toulon the figs are in the open fields. Some\r\nof them have stems of fifteen inches diameter. They generally fork near\r\nthe ground, but sometimes have a single stem of five feet long. They\r\nare as large as apricot trees. The olive trees of this day’s journey\r\nare about the size of large apple trees. The people are in separate\r\nestablishments. Toulon is in a valley at the mouth of the Goutier, a\r\nlittle river of the size of the Veaune; surrounded by high mountains of\r\nnaked rock, leaving some space between them and the sea. This space is\r\nhilly, reddish, gravelly, and of middling quality, in olives, vines,\r\ncorn, almonds, figs, and capers. The capers are planted eight feet\r\napart. A bush yields, one year with another, two pounds, worth twelve\r\nsous the pound. Every plant, then, yields twenty-four sous, equal to\r\none shilling sterling. An acre, containing six hundred and seventy-six\r\nplants, would yield thirty-three pounds sixteen shillings sterling. The\r\nfruit is gathered by women, who can gather about twelve pounds a day.\r\nThey begin to gather about the last of June, and end about the middle of\r\nOctober. Each plant must be picked every day. These plants grow equally\r\nwell in the best or worst soil, or even in the walls, where there is no\r\nsoil. They will last the life of a man, or longer. The heat is so great\r\nat Toulon in summer, as to occasion very great cracks in the earth.\r\nWhere the caper is in a soil that will admit it, they plough it. They\r\nhave pease here through the winter, sheltering them occasionally; and\r\nthey have had them ever since the 25th of March, without shelter.\r\n\r\nApril 6. _Hieres_. This is a plain of two or three miles diameter,\r\nbounded by the sea on one side, and mountains of rock on the other. The\r\nsoil is reddish, gravelly, tolerably good, and well watered. It is in\r\nolives, mulberries, vines, figs, corn, and some flax. There are also\r\nsome cherry trees. From Hieres to the sea, which is two or three miles,\r\nis a grove of orange trees, olives, and mulberries. The largest orange\r\ntree is of two feet diameter one way, and one foot the other (for the\r\nsection of all the larger ones would be an oval, not a round), and about\r\ntwenty feet high. Such a tree will yield about six thousand oranges a\r\nyear. The garden of M. Fille has fifteen thousand six hundred orange,\r\ntrees. Some years they yield forty thousand livres, some only ten\r\nthousand; but generally about twenty-five thousand. The trees are from\r\neight to ten feet apart. They are blossoming and bearing, all the year,\r\nflowers and fruit in every stage at the same time. But the best fruit\r\nis that which is gathered in April and May. Hieres is a village of about\r\nfive thousand inhabitants, at the foot of a mountain, which covers it\r\nfrom the north, and from which extends a plain of two or three miles to\r\nthe sea-shore. It has no port. Here are palm trees twenty or thirty feet\r\nhigh, but they bear no fruit. There is also a botanical garden kept by\r\nthe King. Considerable salt-ponds here. Hieres is six miles from the\r\npublic road. It is built on a narrow spur of the mountain. The streets\r\nin every direction are steep, in steps of stairs, and about eight feet\r\nwide. No carriage of any kind can enter it. The wealthier inhabitants\r\nuse _chaises à porteurs_. But there are few wealthy, the bulk of the\r\ninhabitants being laborers of the earth. At a league’s distance in the\r\nsea is an island, on which is the Chateau de Géans, belonging to the\r\nMarquis de Pontoives: there is a causeway leading to it. The cold of the\r\nlast November killed the leaves of a great number of the orange-trees,\r\nand some of the trees themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom Hieres to _Cuers, Pignans, Luc_, is mostly a plain, with mountains\r\non each hand at a mile or two distance. The soil is generally reddish,\r\nand the latter part very red and good. The growth is olives, figs,\r\nvines, mulberries, corn, clover, and lucerne. The olive trees are\r\nfrom three to four feet in diameter. There are hedges of pomegranates,\r\nsweet-briar, and broom. A great deal of thyme growing wild. There are\r\nsome enclosures of stone; some sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nApril 9. From Luc to _Vidavban, Muy, Frejus_, the road leads through\r\nvallies, and crosses occasionally the mountains which separate them. The\r\nvallies are tolerably good, always red and stony, gravelly or gritty.\r\nTheir produce as before. The mountains are barren.\r\n\r\n_Lesterelle, Napoule_. Eighteen miles of ascent and descent of a very\r\nhigh mountain. Its growth, where capable of any, two-leaved pine, very\r\nsmall, and some chêne vert.\r\n\r\n_Antibes, Nice_. From Napoule the road is generally near the sea,\r\npassing over little hills or strings of vallies, the soil stony, and\r\nmuch below mediocrity in its quality. Here and there is a good plain.\r\n\r\nThere is snow on the high mountains. The first frogs I have heard are\r\nof this day (the 9th). At Antibes are oranges in the open ground, but\r\nin small enclosures; palm trees also. From thence to the Var are\r\nthe largest fig trees and olive trees I have seen. The fig trees are\r\neighteen inches in diameter, and six feet stem; the olives sometimes\r\nsix feet in diameter, and as large heads as the largest low-ground apple\r\ntrees. This tree was but a shrub where I first fell in with it, and\r\nhas become larger and larger to this place. The people are mostly in\r\nvillages. The several provinces, and even cantons, are distinguished\r\nby the form of the women’s hats, so that one may know of what canton a\r\nwoman is by her hat.\r\n\r\n_Nice_. The pine-bur is used here for kindling fires. The people are in\r\nseparate establishments. With respect to the orange, there seems to\r\nbe no climate on this side of the Alps sufficiently mild in itself\r\nto preserve it without shelter. At Olioules they are between two high\r\nmountains; at Hieres covered on the north by a very high mountain;\r\nat Antibes and Nice covered by mountains, and also within small, high\r\nenclosures. _Quære_. To trace the true line from east to west, which\r\nforms the northern and natural limit of that fruit? Saw an elder tree\r\n(sambucus) near Nice, fifteen inches in diameter, and eight feet stem.\r\nThe wine made in this neighborhood is good, though not of the first\r\nquality. There are one thousand mules, loaded with merchandise, which\r\npass every week between Nice and Turin, counting those coming as well as\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nApril 13. _Scarena. Sospello_. There are no orange trees after we leave\r\nthe environs of Nice. We lose the olive after rising a little above the\r\nvillage of Scarena, on Mount Braus, and find it again on the other side,\r\na little before we get down to Sospello. But wherever there is soil\r\nenough it is terraced, and in corn. The waste parts are either in\r\ntwo-leaved pine and thyme, or of absolutely naked rock. Sospello is on\r\na little torrent, called Bevera, which runs into the river Roia, at the\r\nmouth of which is Ventimiglia. The olive trees on the mountain are now\r\nloaded with fruit; while some at Sospello are in blossom. Fire-wood here\r\nand at Scarena costs fifteen sous the quintal.\r\n\r\nApril 14. _Ciandola. Tende_. In crossing Mount Brois we lose the olive\r\ntree after getting to a certain height, and find it again on the other\r\nside at the village of Breglio. Here we come to the river Roia, which,\r\nafter receiving the branch on which is Sospello, leads to the sea at\r\nVentimiglia. The Roia is about twelve yards wide, and abounds with\r\nspeckled trout. Were a road made from Breglio, along the side of the\r\nRoia to Ventimiglia, it might turn the commerce of Turin to this last\r\nplace instead of Nice; because it would avoid the mountains of Braus and\r\nBrois, leaving only that of Tende; that is to say, it would avoid more\r\nthan half the difficulties of the passage. Further on, we come to the\r\nChateau di Saorgio, where a scene is presented the most singular and\r\npicturesque I ever saw. The castle and village seem hanging to a cloud\r\nin front. On the right is a mountain cloven through, to let pass\r\na gurgling stream; on the left, a river, over which is thrown a\r\nmagnificent bridge. The whole forms a basin, the sides of which are\r\nshagged with rocks, olive trees, vines, herds, &c. Near here I saw\r\na tub-wheel without a ream; the trunk descended from the top of\r\nthe water-fall to the wheel in a direct line, but with the usual\r\ninclination. The produce along this passage is most generally olives,\r\nexcept on the heights as before observed; also corn, vines, mulberries,\r\nfigs, cherries, and walnuts. They have cows, goats, and sheep. In\r\npassing on towards Tende, olives fail us ultimately at the village of\r\nFontan, and there the chestnut trees begin in good quantity.\r\nCiandola consists of only two houses, both taverns. Tende is a very\r\ninconsiderable village, in which they have not yet the luxury of glass\r\nwindows: nor in any of the villages on this passage have they yet\r\nthe fashion of powdering the hair. Common stone and limestone are so\r\nabundant, that the apartments of every story are vaulted with stone to\r\nsave wood.\r\n\r\nApril 15. _Limone. Coni_. I see abundance of lime-stone as far as the\r\nearth is uncovered with snow; i.e. within half or three quarters of an\r\nhour’s walk of the top. The snows descend much lower on the eastern\r\nthan western side. Wherever there is soil, there is corn quite to the\r\ncommencement of the snows, and I suppose under them also. The waste\r\nparts are in two-leaved pine, lavender, and thyme. From the foot of\r\nthe mountain to Coni the road follows a branch of the Po, the plains of\r\nwhich begin narrow, and widen at length into a general plain country,\r\nbounded on one side by the Alps. They are good, dark-colored, sometimes\r\ntinged with red, and in pasture, corn, mulberries, and some almonds. The\r\nhill-sides bordering these plains are reddish, and where they admit of\r\nit are in corn; but this is seldom. They are mostly in chestnut, and\r\noften absolutely barren. The whole of the plains are plentifully watered\r\nfrom the river, as is much of the hill-side. A great deal of golden\r\nwillow all along the rivers on the whole of this passage through the\r\nAlps. The southern parts of France, but still more the passage through\r\nthe Alps, enable one to form a scale of the tenderer plants, arranging\r\nthem according to their several powers of resisting cold. Ascending\r\nthree different mountains, Braus, Brois, and Tende, they disappear one\r\nafter another: and descending on the other side, they show themselves\r\nagain one after another. This is their order, from the tenderest to the\r\nhardiest. Caper, orange, palm, aloe, olive, pomegranate, walnut, fig,\r\nalmond. But this must be understood of the plant; for as to the\r\nfruit, the order is somewhat different. The caper, for example, is the\r\ntenderest plant, yet being so easily protected, it is the most certain\r\nin its fruit. The almond, the hardiest plant, loses its fruit the\r\noftenest on account of its forwardness. The palm, hardier than the caper\r\nand the orange, never produces perfect fruit in these parts. Coni is a\r\nconsiderable town, and pretty well built. It is walled.\r\n\r\nApril 16. _Centale. Savigliano. Racconigi. Poirino. Turin_. The Alps,\r\nas far as they are in view from north to south, show the gradation of\r\nclimate by the line which terminates the snows lying on them. This\r\nline begins at their foot northwardly, and rises as they pass on to\r\nthe south, so as to be half way up their sides on the most southern\r\nundulations of the mountain now in view. From the mountains to Turin we\r\nsee no tree tenderer than the walnut. Of these, as well as of almonds\r\nand mulberries, there are a few: somewhat more of vines, but most\r\ngenerally willows and poplars. Corn is sowed with all these. They mix\r\nwith them also clover and small grass. The country is a general plain;\r\nthe soil dark, and sometimes, though rarely, reddish. It is rich, and\r\nmuch infested with wild onions. At Racconigi I see the tops and shocks\r\nof maize, which prove it is cultivated here: but it can be in small\r\nquantities only, because I observe very little ground but what has\r\nalready something else in it. Here and there are small patches prepared,\r\nI suppose, for maize. They have a method of planting the vine, which I\r\nhave not seen before. At intervals of about eight feet they plant from\r\ntwo to six plants of vine in a cluster At each cluster they fix a forked\r\nstaff, the plane of the prongs of the fork at a right angle with the\r\nrow of vines. Athwart these prongs they lash another staff, like a\r\nhandspike, about eight feet long, horizontally, seven or eight feet from\r\nthe ground. Of course, it crosses the rows at right angles. The vines\r\nare brought from the foot of the fork up to this cross-piece, turned\r\nover it, and conducted along over the next, the next, and so on, as far\r\nas they will extend, the whole forming an arbor eight feet wide and high\r\nand of the whole length of the row, little interrupted by the stems of\r\nthe vines, which being close around the fork, pass up through hoops, so\r\nas to occupy a space only of small diameter. All the buildings in this\r\ncountry are of brick, sometimes covered with plaister, sometimes not.\r\nThere is a very large and handsome bridge, of seven arches, over the\r\ntorrent of Sangone. We cross the Po in swinging batteaux. Two are placed\r\nside by side, and kept together by a plank-floor, common to both, and\r\nlying on the gunwales. The carriage drives on this, without taking out\r\nany of the horses. About one hundred and fifty yards up the river is a\r\nfixed stake, and a rope tied to it, the other end of which is made fast\r\nto one side of the batteaux, so as to throw them oblique to the current.\r\nThe stream then acting on them, as on an inclined plane, forces them\r\nacross the current in the portion of a circle, of which the rope is\r\nthe radius. To support the rope in its whole length, there are two\r\nintermediate canoes, about fifty yards apart, in the heads of which are\r\nshort masts. To the top of these the rope is lashed, the canoes being\r\nfree otherwise to concur with the general vibration in their smaller\r\narcs of circles. The Po is there about fifty yards wide, and about one\r\nhundred in the neighborhood of Turin.\r\n\r\nApril 17, 18. _Turin_. The first nightingale I have heard this year is\r\nto-day (18th). There is a red wine of Nebiule made in this neighborhood,\r\nwhich is very singular. It is about as sweet as the silky Madeira, as\r\nastringent on the palate as Bordeaux, and as brisk as Champagne. It is a\r\npleasing wine. At Moncaglieri, about six miles from Turin, on the right\r\nside of the Po, begins a ridge of mountains, which, following the Po\r\nby Turin, after some distance, spreads wide, and forms the duchy of\r\nMontferrat. The soil is mostly red, and in vines, affording a wine\r\ncalled Montferrat, which is thick and strong.\r\n\r\nApril 19. _Settimo. Chivasso. Ciliano. S. Germano. Vercelli_. The\r\ncountry continues plain and rich, the soil black. The culture, corn,\r\npasture, maize, vines, mulberries, walnuts, some willow, and poplar.\r\nThe maize bears a very small proportion to the small grain. The earth is\r\nformed into ridges from three to four feet wide, and the maize sowed in\r\nthe broad-cast, on the higher parts of the ridge, so as to cover a third\r\nor half of the whole surface. It is sowed late in May. This country\r\nis plentifully and beautifully watered at present. Much of it is by\r\ntorrents, which are dry in summer. These torrents make a great deal\r\nof waste ground, covering it with sand and stones. These wastes are\r\nsometimes planted in trees, sometimes quite unemployed. They make hedges\r\nof willows, by setting the plants from one to three feet apart. When\r\nthey are grown to the height of eight or ten feet, they bend them down,\r\nand interlace them one with another. I do not see any of these, however,\r\nwhich are become old. Probably, therefore, they soon die. The women here\r\nsmite on the anvil, and work with the maul and spade. The people of this\r\ncountry are ill dressed in comparison with those of France, and there\r\nare more spots of uncultivated ground. The plough here is made with a\r\nsingle handle, which is a beam twelve feet long, six inches in diameter\r\nbelow, and tapered to about two inches at the upper end. They use goads\r\nfor the oxen, not whips. The first swallows I have seen are to-day.\r\nThere is a wine called Gatina, made in the neighborhood of Vercelli,\r\nboth red and white. The latter resembles Calcavallo. There is also a\r\nred wine of Salusola, which is esteemed. It is very light. In the\r\nneighborhood of Vercelli begin the rice-fields. The water with which\r\nthey are watered is very dear. They do not permit rice to be sown within\r\ntwo miles of the cities, on account of the insalubrity. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, when the water is drawn off the fields, in August, the whole\r\ncountry is subject to agues and fevers. They estimate, that the same\r\nmeasure of ground yields three times as much rice as wheat, and with\r\nhalf the labor. They are now sowing. As soon as sowed, they let on the\r\nwater two or three inches deep. After six weeks, or two months, they\r\ndraw it off to weed; then let it on again, and it remains till August,\r\nwhen it is drawn off, about three or four weeks before the grain is\r\nripe. In September they cut it. It is first threshed; then beaten in\r\nthe mortar to separate the husk; then, by different siftings, it is\r\nseparated into three qualities. Twelve rupes, equal to three hundred\r\npounds of twelve ounces each, sell for sixteen livres, money of\r\nPiedmont, where the livre is exactly the shilling of England. Twelve\r\nrupes of maize sell for nine livres. The machine for separating the\r\nhusk is thus made. In the axis of a water-wheel are a number of arms\r\ninserted, which, as they revolve, catches each the cog of a pestle,\r\nlifts it to a certain height, and lets it fall again. These pestles are\r\nfive and a quarter inches square, ten feet long, and at their lower end\r\nformed into a truncated cone of three inches diameter, where cut off.\r\nThe conical part is covered with iron. The pestles are ten and a half\r\ninches apart in the clear. They pass through two horizontal beams, which\r\nstring them, as it were, together, and while the mortises in the beams\r\nare so loose, as to let the pestles work vertically, it restrains them\r\nto that motion. There is a mortar of wood, twelve or fifteen inches\r\ndeep, under each pestle, covered with a board, the hole of which is only\r\nlarge enough to let the pestle pass freely. There are two arms in the\r\naxis for every pestle, so that the pestle gives two strokes for every\r\nrevolution of the wheel. Poggio, a muleteer, who passes every week\r\nbetween Vercelli and Genoa, will smuggle a sack of rough rice for me to,\r\nGenoa; it being death to export it in that form. They have good cattle,\r\nand in good number, mostly cream-colored; and some middle-sized sheep.\r\nThe streams furnish speckled trout.\r\n\r\nApril 20. _Novara. Buffalora. Sedriano. Milan_. From Vercelli to\r\nNovara the fields are all in rice, and now mostly under water. The\r\ndams separating the several water-plats or ponds, are set in willow. At\r\nNovara there are some figs in the gardens in situations well protected.\r\nFrom Novara to the Ticino it is mostly stony and waste, grown up in\r\nbroom. From Ticino to Milan it is all in corn. Among the corn are\r\nwillows, principally, a good many mulberries, some walnuts, and here\r\nand there an almond. The country still a plain, the soil black and rich,\r\nexcept between Novara and the Ticino, as before mentioned. There is very\r\nfine pasture round Vercelli and Novara to the distance of two miles,\r\nwithin which rice is not permitted. We cross the Sisto on the same\r\nkind of vibrating or pendulum boat as on the Po. The river is eighty\r\nor ninety yards wide; the rope fastened to an island two hundred yards\r\nabove, and supported by five intermediate canoes. It is about one and a\r\nhalf inches in diameter. On these rivers they use a short oar of twelve\r\nfeet long, the flat end of which is hooped with iron, shooting out\r\na prong at each corner, so that it may be used occasionally as a\r\nsetting-pole. There is snow on the Apennines, near Genoa. They have\r\nstill another method here of planting the vine. Along rows of trees,\r\nthey lash poles from tree to tree. Between the trees, are set vines,\r\nwhich, passing over the pole, are carried on to the pole of the,\r\nnext tree, whose vines are in like manner brought to this, and twined\r\ntogether; thus forming the intervals between the rows of trees,\r\nalternately, into arbors and open space. They have another method also\r\nof making quick-set hedges. Willows are planted from one to two feet\r\napart, and interlaced, so that every one is crossed by three or four\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nApril 21, 22. _Milan_. Figs and pomegranates grow here, unsheltered,\r\nas I am told. I saw none, and therefore suppose them rare. They had\r\nformerly olives; but a great cold, in 1709, killed them, and they have\r\nnot been replanted. Among a great many houses painted _al fresco_, the\r\nCasa Roma and Casa Candiani, by Appiani, and Casa Belgioiosa, by Martin,\r\nare superior. In the second, is a small cabinet, the ceiling of which\r\nis in small hexagons, within which are cameos and heads painted\r\nalternately, no two the same. The _salon_ of the Casa-Belgioiosa is\r\nsuperior to any thing 1 have ever seen. The mixture called _scagliuola_,\r\nof which they make their walls and floors, is so like the finest marble,\r\nas to be scarcely distinguishable from it. The nights of the 20th and\r\n21st instant, the rice ponds froze half an inch thick. Droughts of two\r\nor three months are not uncommon here, in summer. About five years ago,\r\nthere was such a hail as to kill cats. The Count del Verme tells me of\r\na pendulum odometer for the wheel of a carriage. Leases here are mostly\r\nfor nine years. Wheat costs a louis d’or the one hundred and forty\r\npounds. A laboring man receives sixty livres, and is fed and lodged. The\r\ntrade of this country is principally rice, raw silk, and cheese.\r\n\r\nApril 23. _Casino_, five miles from Milan. I examined another\r\nrice-beater of six pestles. They are eight feet nine inches long. Their\r\nends, instead of being a truncated cone, have nine teeth of iron, bound\r\nclosely together. Each tooth is a double pyramid, joined at the base.\r\nWhen put together, they stand with the upper ends placed in contact, so\r\nas to form them into one great cone, and the lower ends diverging. The\r\nupper are socketed into the end of the pestle, and the lower, when a\r\nlittle blunted by use, are not unlike the jaw-teeth of the mammoth, with\r\ntheir studs. They say here, that pestles armed with these teeth, clean\r\nthe rice faster, and break it less. The mortar, too, is of stone, which\r\nis supposed as good as wood, and more durable. One half of these\r\npestles are always up. They rise about twenty-one inches; and each makes\r\nthirty-eight strokes in a minute; one hundred pounds of rough rice is\r\nput into the six mortars, and beaten somewhat less than a quarter of\r\nan hour. It is then taken out, put into a sifter of four feet diameter,\r\nsuspended horizontally; sifted there; shifted into another of the same\r\nsize; sifted there; returned to the mortars; beaten a little more than\r\na quarter of an hour; sifted again; and it is finished. The six pestles\r\nwill clear four thousand pounds in twenty-four hours. The pound here\r\nis twenty-eight ounces: the ounce equal to that of Paris. The best rice\r\nrequires half an hour’s boiling; a more indifferent kind, somewhat less.\r\nTo sow the rice, they first plough the ground, then level it with a\r\ndrag-harrow, and let on the water; when the earth has become soft, they\r\nsmooth it with a shovel under the water, and then sow the rice in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Rozzano_. Parmesan cheese. It is supposed this was formerly made at\r\nParma, and took its name thence; but none is made there now. It is made\r\nthrough all the country extending from Milan, for one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. The most is made about Lodi. The making of butter being connected\r\nwith that of making cheese, both must be described together. There are,\r\nin the stables I saw, eighty-five cows, fed on hay and grass, not on\r\ngrain. They are milked twice in twenty-four hours, ten cows yielding\r\nat the two milkings a _brenta_ of milk, which is twenty-four of our\r\ngallons. The night’s milk is scummed in the morning at daybreak, when\r\nthe cows are milked again, and the new milk mixed with the old. In three\r\nhours, the whole mass is scummed a second time, the milk remaining in\r\na kettle for cheese, and the cream being put into a cylindrical churn,\r\nshaped like a grind-stone, eighteen inches radius, and fourteen inches\r\nthick. In this churn, there are three staves pointing inwardly, endwise,\r\nto break the current of the milk. Through its centre passes an iron\r\naxis, with a handle at each end. It is turned, about an hour and an\r\nhalf, by two men, till the butter is produced. Then they pour off the\r\nbutter-milk, and put in some water which they agitate backwards and\r\nforwards about a minute, and pour it off. They take out the butter,\r\npress it with their hands into loaves, and stamp it. It has no other\r\nwashing. Sixteen American gallons of milk yield fifteen pounds of\r\nbutter, which sell at twenty-four sous the pound.\r\n\r\nThe milk, which, after being scummed as before, had been put into\r\na copper kettle, receives its due quantity of rennet, and is gently\r\nwarmed, if the season requires it. In about four hours, it becomes a\r\nslip. Then the whey begins to separate. A little, of it is taken out.\r\nThe curd is then thoroughly broken by a machine like a chocolate-mill. A\r\nquarter of an ounce of saffron is put to seven brentas of milk, to\r\ngive color to the cheese. The kettle is then moved over the hearth, and\r\nheated by a quick fire till the curd is hard enough, being broken into\r\nsmall lumps by continued stirring. It is moved off the fire, most of the\r\nwhey taken out, the curd compressed into a globe by the hand, a linen\r\ncloth slipped under it, and it is drawn out in that. A loose hoop is\r\nthen laid on a bench, and the curd, as wrapped in the linen, is put into\r\nthe hoop: it is a little pressed by the hand, the hoop drawn tight,\r\nand made fast. A board, two inches thick, is laid on it, and a stone on\r\nthat, of about twenty pounds weight. In an hour, the whey is run off,\r\nand the cheese finished. They sprinkle a little salt on it every other\r\nday in summer, and every day in winter, for six weeks. Seven _brentas_\r\nof milk make a cheese of fifty pounds, which requires six months to\r\nripen, and is then dried to forty-five pounds. It sells on the spot for\r\neighty-eight livres, the one hundred pounds. There are now one hundred\r\nand fifty cheeses in this dairy. They are nineteen inches diameter, and\r\nsix inches thick. They make a cheese a day, in summer, and two in three\r\ndays, or one in two days, in winter.\r\n\r\nThe whey is put back into the kettle, the butter-milk poured into it,\r\nand of this, they make a poor cheese for the country people. The whey of\r\nthis is given to the hogs. Eight men suffice to keep the cows, and to do\r\nall the business of this dairy. _Mascarponi_, a kind of curd, is made\r\nby pouring some butter-milk into cream, which is thereby curdled, and is\r\nthen pressed in a linen cloth.\r\n\r\nThe ice-houses at Rozzano are dug about fifteen feet deep, and twenty\r\nfeet diameter, and poles are driven down all round. A conical thatched\r\nroof is then put over them, fifteen feet high, and pieces of wood are\r\nlaid at bottom, to keep the ice out of the water which drips from it,\r\nand goes off by a sink. Straw is laid on this wood, and then the house\r\nfilled with ice, always putting straw between the ice and the walls, and\r\ncovering ultimately with straw. About a third is lost by melting. Snow\r\ngives the most delicate flavor to creams; but ice is the most\r\npowerful congealer, and lasts longest. A tuft of trees surrounds these\r\nice-houses.\r\n\r\nRound Milan, to the distance of five miles, are corn, pasture, gardens,\r\nmulberries, willows, and vines. For, in this state, rice ponds are not\r\npermitted within five miles of the cities.\r\n\r\n_Binasco. Pavia_. Near Casino the rice-ponds begin, and continue to\r\nwithin five miles of Pavia, the whole ground being in rice, pasture, and\r\nwillows. The pasture is in the rice grounds which are resting. In the\r\nneighborhood of Pavia, again, are corn, pasture, &c. as round Milan.\r\nThey gave me green pease at Pavia.\r\n\r\nApril 24. _Voghera. Tortona. Novi_. From Pavia to Novi corn, pasture,\r\nvines, mulberries, willows; but no rice. The country continues plain,\r\nexcept that the Apennines are approaching on the left. The soil, always\r\ngood, is dark till we approach Novi, and then red. We cross the Po where\r\nit is three hundred yards wide, in a pendulum boat. The rope is fastened\r\non one side of the river, three hundred yards above, and supported by\r\neight intermediate canoes, with little masts in them to give a greater\r\nelevation to the rope. We pass in eleven minutes. Women, girls, and boys\r\nare working with the hoe, and breaking the clods with mauls.\r\n\r\nApril 25. _Voltaggio. Campo-Marone. Genoa_. At Novi, the Apennines begin\r\nto rise. Their growth of timber is oak, tall, small, and knotty, and\r\nchestnut. We soon lose the walnut, ascending, and find it again, about\r\none fourth of the way down, on the south side. About halfway down, we\r\nfind figs and vines, which continue fine and in great abundance. The\r\nApennines are mostly covered with soil, and are in corn, pasture,\r\nmulberries and figs, in the parts before indicated. About half way from\r\ntheir foot to Genoa, at Campo-Marone, we find again the olive tree.\r\nHence the produce becomes mixed, of all the kinds before mentioned. The\r\nmethod of sowing the Indian corn at Campo-Marone, is as follows. With\r\na hoe shaped like the blade of a trowel, two feet long, and six inches\r\nbroad at its upper end, pointed below, and a little curved, they make\r\na trench. In that, they drop the grains six inches apart. Then two feet\r\nfrom that, they make another trench, throwing the earth they take out of\r\nthat on the grain of the last one, with a singular slight and quickness;\r\nand so through the whole piece. The last trench is filled with the earth\r\nadjoining.\r\n\r\nApril 26. _Genoa_. Strawberries at Genoa. Scaffold poles for the upper\r\nparts of a wall, as for the third story, rest on the window sills of the\r\nstory below. Slate is used here for paving, for steps, for stairs (the\r\nrise as well as tread), and for fixed Venetian blinds. At the Palazzo\r\nMarcello Durazzo, benches with straight legs, and bottoms of cane. At\r\nthe Palazzo del Prencipe Lomellino, at Sestri, a phaeton with a canopy.\r\nAt the former, tables folding into one plane. At Nervi they have pease,\r\nstrawberries, &c. all the year round. The gardens of the Count Durazzo\r\nat Nervi, exhibit as rich a mixture of the _utile dulci_, as I ever\r\nsaw. All the environs in Genoa are in olives, figs, oranges, mulberries,\r\ncorn, and garden-stuff. Aloes in many places, but they never flower.\r\n\r\nApril 28. _Noli_. The Apennine and Alps appear to me to be one and the\r\nsame continued ridge of mountains, separating every where the waters\r\nof the Adriatic Gulf from those of the Mediterranean. Where it forms an\r\nelbow, touching the Mediterranean, as a smaller circle touches a larger,\r\nwithin which it is inscribed, in the manner of a tangent, the name\r\nchanges from Alps to Apennine. It is the beginning of the Apennine which\r\nconstitutes the state of Genoa, the mountains there generally falling\r\ndown in barren, naked precipices into the sea. Wherever there is soil\r\non the lower parts, it is principally in olives and figs, in vines also,\r\nmulberries, and corn. Where there are hollows well protected, there\r\nare oranges. This is the case at Golfo della Spezia, Sestri, Bugiasco,\r\nNervi, Genoa, Pegli, Savona, Finale, Oneglia (where there are\r\nabundance), St. Rerno, Ventimiglia, Mentone, and Monaco. Noli, into\r\nwhich I was obliged to put, by a change of wind, is forty miles from\r\nGenoa. There are twelve hundred inhabitants in the village, and many\r\nseparate houses round about. One of the precipices hanging over the sea,\r\nis covered with aloes. But neither here, nor any where else I have been,\r\ncould I procure satisfactory information that they ever flower. The\r\ncurrent of testimony is to the contrary. Noli furnishes many fishermen.\r\nPaths penetrate up into the mountains in several directions, about three\r\nfourths of a mile; but these are practicable only for asses and mules. I\r\nsaw no cattle nor sheep in the settlement. The wine they make, is white\r\nand indifferent. A curious cruet for oil and vinegar in one piece, I saw\r\nhere. A bishop resides here, whose revenue is two thousand livres, equal\r\nto sixty-six guineas. I heard a nightingale here.\r\n\r\nApril 29. _Albenga_. In walking along the shore from Louano to this\r\nplace, I saw no appearance of shells. The tops of the mountains are\r\ncovered with snow, while there are olive trees, &c. on the lower parts.\r\nI do not remember to have seen assigned any where, the cause of the\r\napparent color of the sea. Its water is generally clear and colorless,\r\nif taken up and viewed in a glass. That of the Mediterranean is\r\nremarkably so. Yet in the mass, it assumes, _by reflection_, the color\r\nof the sky or atmosphere, black, green, blue, according to the state of\r\nthe weather. If any person wished to retire from his acquaintance, to\r\nlive absolutely unknown, and yet in the midst of physical enjoyments,\r\nit should be in some of the little villages of this coast, where air,\r\nwater, and earth concur to offer what each has, most precious. Here are\r\nnightingales, beccaficas, ortolans, pheasants, partridges, quails, a\r\nsuperb climate, and the power of changing it from summer to winter at\r\nany moment, by ascending the mountains. The earth furnishes wine, oil,\r\nfigs, oranges, and every production of the garden, in every season. The\r\nsea yields lobsters, crabs, oysters, tunny, sardines, anchovies, &c.\r\nOrtolans sell, at this time, at thirty sous, equal to one shilling\r\nsterling, the dozen. At this season, they must be fattened. Through the\r\nwhole of my route from Marseilles, I observe they plant a great deal\r\nof cane or reed, which is convenient while growing, as a cover from\r\nthe cold and boisterous winds, and when cut, it serves for espaliers to\r\nvines, pease, &c. Through Piedmont, Lombardy, the Milanese, and Genoese,\r\nthe garden bean is a great article of culture; almost as much so as\r\ncorn. At Albenga, is a rich plain opening from between two ridges of\r\nmountains, triangularly, to the sea, and of several miles extent. Its\r\ngrowth is olives, figs, mulberries, vines, corn, and beans. There is\r\nsome pasture. A bishop resides here, whose revenue is forty thousand\r\nlivres. This place is said to be rendered unhealthy in summer, by the\r\nriver which passes through the valley.\r\n\r\nApril 30. _Oneglia_. The wind continuing contrary, I took mules at\r\nAlbenga for Oneglia. Along this tract are many of the tree called\r\n_caroubier_, being a species of locust. It is the _ceratonia siliqua_\r\nof Linnaeus. Its pods furnish food for horses, and also for the poor,\r\nin time of scarcity. It abounds in Naples and Spain. Oneglia and Port\r\nMaurice, which are within a mile of each other, are considerable places,\r\nand in a rich country. At St. Remo, are abundance of oranges and lemons,\r\nand some palm trees.\r\n\r\nMay 1. _Ventimiglia. Mentone. Monaco. Nice_. At Bordighera, between\r\nVentimiglia and Mentone, are extensive plantations of palms, on the\r\nhill as well as in the plain. They bring fruit, but it does not ripen.\r\nSomething is made of the midrib which is in great demand at Rome, on the\r\nPalm Sunday, and which renders this tree profitable here. From Mentone\r\nto Monaco, there is more good land, and extensive groves of oranges and\r\nlemons. Orange water sells here at forty sous, equal to sixteen pence\r\nsterling, the American quart. The distances on this coast are, from\r\nLa Spezia, at the eastern end of the territories of Genoa, to Genoa,\r\nfifty-five miles, geometrical; to Savona, thirty; Albenga, thirty;\r\nOneglia, twenty; Ventimiglia, twenty-five; Monaco, ten; Nice, ten; in\r\nthe whole, one hundred and eighty miles. A superb road might be made\r\nalong the margin of the sea from La Spezai, where the champaign country\r\nof Italy opens, to Nice, where the Alps go off northwardly, and the post\r\nroads of France begin; and it might even follow the margin of the sea\r\nquite to Cette. By this road, travellers would enter Italy without\r\ncrossing the Alps, and all the little insulated villages of the Genoese\r\nwould communicate together, and in time, form one continued village\r\nalong that road.\r\n\r\nMay 3. _Luc, Brignoles. Tourves. Pourcieux. La Galiniere_. Long, small\r\nmountains, very rocky, the soil reddish, from bad to middling; in\r\nolives, grapes, mulberries, vines, and corn. Brignolles is an extensive\r\nplain, between two ridges of mountains, and along a water-course which\r\ncontinues to Tourves. Thence to Pourcieux we cross a mountain, low and\r\neasy. The country is rocky and poor. To La Galiniere are waving grounds,\r\nbounded by mountains of rock at a little distance. There are some\r\nenclosures of dry wall from Luc to La Galiniere; also, sheep and hogs.\r\nThere is snow on the high mountains. I see no plums in the vicinities\r\nof Brignoles; which makes me conjecture that the celebrated plum of that\r\nname is not derived from this place.\r\n\r\nMay 8. _Orgon. Avignon. Vaucluse_. Orgon is on the Durance. From thence,\r\nits plain opens till it becomes common with that of the Rhone; so that\r\nfrom Orgon to Avignon is entirely a plain of rich dark loam, which is in\r\nwillows, mulberries, vines, corn, and pasture. A very few figs. I see no\r\nolives in this plain. Probably the cold winds have too much power here.\r\nFrom the Bac de Nova (where we cross the Durance) to Avignon, is about\r\nnine American miles; and from the same Bac to Vaucluse, eleven miles.\r\nIn the valley of Vaucluse, and on the hills impending over it, are olive\r\ntrees. The stream issuing from the fountain of Vaucluse is about twenty\r\nyards wide, four or five feet deep, and of such rapidity that it could\r\nnot be stemmed by a canoe. They are now mowing hay, and gathering\r\nmulberry leaves. The high mountains just back of Vaucluse, are covered\r\nwith snow. Fine trout in the stream of Vaucluse, and the valley abounds\r\npeculiarly with nightingales. The _vin blanc_ de M. de Rochequde of\r\nAvignon, resembles dry Lisbon. He sells it, at six years old, for\r\ntwenty-two sous the bottle, the price of the bottle, &c. included.\r\n\r\n_Avignon. Remoulins_. Some good plains, but generally hills, stony and\r\npoor. In olives, mulberries, vines, and corn. Where it is waste the\r\ngrowth is _chéne-vert_, box, furze, thyme, and rosemary.\r\n\r\nMay 10. _Lismes. Lunel_. Hills on the right, plains on the left. The\r\nsoil reddish, a little stony, and of middling quality. The produce,\r\nolives, mulberries, vines, corn, saintfoin. No wood and few enclosures.\r\nLunel is famous for its _vin de muscat blanc_, thence called Lunel,\r\nor _vin muscat de Lunel_. It is made from the raisin muscat, without\r\nfermenting the grain in the hopper. When fermented, it makes a red\r\nmuscat, taking the tinge from the dissolution of the skin of the grape,\r\nwhich injures the quality. When a red muscat is required, they prefer\r\ncoloring it with a little Alicant wine. But the white is best. The\r\n_pièce_ of two hundred and forty bottles, after being properly drawn off\r\nfrom its lees, and ready for bottling, costs from one hundred and twenty\r\nto two hundred livres, the first, quality and last vintage. It cannot be\r\nbought old, the demand being sufficient to take it all the first year.\r\nThere are not more than from fifty to one hundred _pièces_ a year, made\r\nof this first quality. A _setterie_ yields about one _pièce_, and my\r\ninformer supposes there are about two _setteries_ in an arpent. Portage\r\nto Paris, by land, is fifteen livres the quintal. The best _récoltes_\r\nare those of M. Bouquet and M. Tremoulet. The vines are in rows four\r\nfeet apart, every way.\r\n\r\nMay 11. _Montpelier_. Snow on the Cevennes, still visible from here.\r\nWith respect to the muscat grape, of which the wine is made, there are\r\ntwo kinds, the red and the white. The first has a red skin, but a white\r\njuice. If it be fermented in the _cuve_, the coloring matter which\r\nresides in the skin, is imparted to the wine. If not fermented in the\r\n_cuve_, the wine is white. Of the white grape, only a white wine can\r\nbe made. The species of saintfoin cultivated here by the name of\r\n_sparsette_, is the _hedysarum onobrychis_. They cultivate a great\r\ndeal of madder (_garance_) _rubia tinctorum_ here, which is said to\r\nbe immensely profitable. Monsieur de Gouan tells me, that the pine,\r\nof which they use the burs for fuel, is the _pinus sativus_, being\r\ntwo-leaved. They use-for an edging to the borders of their gardens, the\r\nsantolina, which they call _garderobe_. I find the yellow clover here,\r\nin a garden, and the large pigeon succeeding well, confined in a house.\r\n\r\nMay 12. _Frontignan_. Some tolerably good plains in olives, vines, corn,\r\nsaintfoin, and lucerne. A great proportion of the hills are waste. There\r\nare some enclosures of stone, and some sheep. The first four years of\r\nmadder are unproductive; the fifth and sixth yield the whole value of\r\nthe land. Then it must be renewed. The _sparsette_ is the common or true\r\nsaintfoin. It lasts about five years: in the best land it is cut twice,\r\nin May and September, and yields three thousand pounds of dry hay to the\r\nsetterie, the first cutting, and five hundred pounds, the second. The\r\n_setterie_ is of seventy-five _dextres en tout sens_, supposed about\r\ntwo arpents. Lucerne is the best of all forage; it is sowed herein the\r\nbroad-cast, and lasts about twelve or fourteen years. It is cut four\r\ntimes a year, and yields six thousand pounds of dry hay, at the four\r\ncuttings, to the setterie. The territory in which the _vin muscat de\r\nFrontignan_ is made, is about a league of three thousand _toises_ long,\r\nand one fourth of a league broad. The soil is reddish and stony, often\r\nas much stone as soil. On the left, it is a plain, on the right hills.\r\nThere are made about one thousand _pièces_ (of two hundred and fifty\r\nbottles each) annually, of which six hundred are of the first quality,\r\nmade on the _coteaux_. Of these, Madame Soubeinan makes two hundred,\r\nMonsieur Reboulle ninety, Monsieur Lambert, _medecin de la faculte\r\nde Montpelier_, sixty, Monsieur Thomas, _notaire_, fifty, Monsieur\r\nArgilliers fifty, Monsieur Audibert forty; equal to four hundred and\r\nninety; and there are some small proprietors who make small quantities.\r\nThe first quality is sold, _brut_, for one hundred and twenty livres the\r\n_pièce_; but it is then thick, and must have a winter and the\r\n_fouet_, to render it potable and brilliant. The _fouet_ is like a\r\nchocolate-mill, the handle of iron, the brush of stiff hair. In bottles,\r\nthis wine costs twenty-four sous, the bottle, &c. included. It is\r\npotable the April after it is made, is best that year, and after ten\r\nyears begins to have a pitchy taste, resembling it to Malaga. It is not\r\npermitted to ferment more than half a day, because it would not be so\r\nliquorish. The best color, and its natural one, is the amber. By force\r\nof whipping, it is made white, but loses flavor. There are but two or\r\nthree _pièces_ a year of red Muscat made; there being but one vineyard\r\nof the red grape, which belongs to a baker called Pascal. This sells\r\nin bottles at thirty sous, the bottle included. Rondelle, _négociant\r\nen vin, Porte St. Bernard, fauxbourg St. Germain, Paris_, buys three\r\nhundred pieces of the first quality every year. The _coteaux_ yield\r\nabout half a piece to the _setterie_, the plains a whole piece. The\r\ninferior quality is not at all esteemed. It is bought by the merchants\r\nof Cette, as is also the wine of Beziers, and sold by them for\r\nFrontignan of the first quality. They sell thirty thousand _pièces_ a\r\nyear under that name. The town of Frontignan marks its casks with a hot\r\niron: an individual of that place, having two casks emptied, was offered\r\nforty livres for the empty cask by a merchant of Cette. The town of\r\nFrontignan contains about two thousand inhabitants; it is almost on\r\nthe level of the ocean. Transportation to Paris is fifteen livres the\r\nquintal, and takes fifteen days. The price of packages is about eight\r\nlivres eight sous the one hundred bottles. A _setterie_ of good vineyard\r\nsells for from three hundred and fifty to five hundred livres, and rents\r\nfor fifty livres. A laboring man hires at one hundred and fifty livres\r\nthe year, and is fed and lodged; a woman at half as much. Wheat sells\r\nat ten livres the _settier_, which weighs one hundred pounds, _poids de\r\ntable_. They make some Indian corn here, which is eaten by the poor. The\r\nolives do not extend northward of this into the country above twelve\r\nor fifteen leagues. In general, the olive country in Languedoc is about\r\nfifteen leagues broad. More of the waste lands between Frontignan and\r\nMirval are capable of culture; but it is a marshy country, very subject\r\nto fever and ague, and generally unhealthy. Thence arises, as is said, a\r\nwant of hands.\r\n\r\n_Cette_. There are in this town about ten thousand inhabitants.\r\nIts principal commerce is wine; it furnishes great quantities of\r\ngrape-pumice for making _verdigrise_. They have a very growing commerce;\r\nbut it is kept under by the privileges of Marseilles.\r\n\r\nMay 13. _Agde_. On the right of the Etang de Thau are plains of some\r\nwidth, then hills, in olives, vines, mulberry, corn, and pasture. On the\r\nleft a narrow sand-bar, separating the Etang from the sea, along which\r\nit is proposed to make a road from Cette to Agde. In this case, the post\r\nwould lead from Montpelier by Cette and Agde to Beziers, being leveller,\r\nand an hour or an hour and a half nearer. Agde contains six or eight\r\nthousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMay 14. _Beziers_. Rich plains in corn, saintfoin, and pasture; hills\r\nat a little distance to the right in olives; the soil both of hill and\r\nplain is red going from Agde to Beziers. But at Beziers the country\r\nbecomes hilly, and is in olives, corn, saintfoin, pasture, some vines,\r\nand mulberries.\r\n\r\nMay 15. _Beziers. Argilies. Le Saumal_. From Argilies to Saumal are\r\nconsiderable plantations of vines. Those on the red hills, to the right,\r\nare said to produce good wine. No wood, no enclosures. There are sheep\r\nand good cattle. The Pyrenees are covered with snow. I am told they are\r\nso in certain parts all the year. The canal of Languedoc, along which\r\nI now travel, is six _toises_ wide at bottom, and ten _toises_ at\r\nthe surface of the water, which is one _toise_ deep. The barks which\r\nnavigate it are seventy and eighty feet long, and seventeen or eighteen\r\nfeet wide. They are drawn by one horse, and worked by two hands, one of\r\nwhich is generally a woman. The locks are mostly kept by women, but the\r\nnecessary operations are much too laborious for them. The encroachments\r\nby the men, on the offices proper for the women, is a great derangement\r\nin the order of things. Men are shoemakers, tailors, upholsterers,\r\nstaymakers, mantua-makers, cooks, housekeepers, house-cleaners,\r\nbed-makers, they _coiffe_ the ladies, and bring them to bed: the women,\r\ntherefore, to live, are obliged to undertake the offices which they\r\nabandon. They become porters, carters, reapers, sailors, lock-keepers,\r\nsmiters on the anvil, cultivators of the earth, &c. Can we wonder, if\r\nsuch of them as have a little beauty, prefer easier courses to get their\r\nlivelihood, as long as that beauty lasts? Ladies who employ men in the\r\noffices which should be reserved for their sex, are they not bawds in\r\neffect? For every man whom they thus emply, some girl, whose place he\r\nhas thus taken, is driven to whoredom. The passage of the eight locks\r\nat Beziers, that is, from the opening of the first to the last gate\r\ntook one hour and thirty-three minutes. The bark in which I go is about\r\nthirty-five feet long, drawn by one horse, and goes from two to three\r\ngeographical miles an hour. The canal yields abundance of carp and eel.\r\nI see also small fish, resembling our perch and chub. Some plants\r\nof white clover, and some of yellow, on the banks of the canal near\r\nCapestan; santolina also, and a great deal of yellow iris. Met a raft\r\nof about three hundred and fifty beams, forty feet long, and twelve\r\nor thirteen inches in diameter, formed into fourteen rafts, tacked\r\ntogether. The extensive and numerous fields of saintfoin, in general\r\nbloom, are beautiful.\r\n\r\nMay 16. _Le Saumal. Marseillette_. May 17. _Marseilleite. Carcassonne_.\r\nFrom Saumal to Carcassonne we have always the river Aube close on our\r\nleft. This river runs in the valley between the Cevennes and Pyrenees,\r\nserving as the common receptacle for both their waters. It is from\r\nfifty to one hundred and fifty yards wide, always rapid, rocky, and\r\ninsusceptible of navigation. The canal passes in the side of hills made\r\nby that river, overlooks the river itself, and its plains, and has\r\nits prospect ultimately terminated on one side by mountains of rock,\r\novertopped by the Pyrenees, on the other by small mountains, sometimes\r\nof rock, sometimes of soil, overtopped by the Cevennes. Marseillette\r\nis on a ridge, which separates the river Aube from the Etang de\r\nMarseillette. The canal, in its approach to this village, passes the\r\nridge, and rides along the front, overlooking the Etang, and the plains\r\non its border; and having passed the village, re-crosses the ridge, and\r\nresumes its general ground in front of the Aube. The land is in corn,\r\nsaintfoin, pasture, vines, mulberries, willows, and olives.\r\n\r\nMay 18. _Carcassonne. Castelnaudari_. Opposite to Carcassonne the canal\r\nreceives the river Fresquel, about thirty yards wide, which is its\r\nsubstantial supply of water from hence to Beziers. From Beziers to Agde\r\nthe river Orb furnishes it, and the Eraut, from Agde to the Etang de\r\nThau. By means of the _écluse ronde_ at Agde, the waters of the Eraut\r\ncan be thrown towards Beziers, to aid those of the Orb, as far as the\r\n_écluse de Porcaraigne_, nine geometrical miles. Where the Fresquel\r\nenters the canal, there is, on the opposite side, a waste, to let off\r\nthe superfluous waters. The horse-way is continued over this waste, by a\r\nbridge of stone of eighteen arches. I observe them fishing in the canal,\r\nwith a skimming net of about fifteen feet diameter, with which they tell\r\nme they catch carp. Flax in blossom. Neither strawberries nor peas yet\r\nat Carcassonne. The Windsor-bean just come to table. From the _écluse de\r\nla Lande_ we see the last olive trees near a _metairée_, or farm-house-,\r\ncalled _La Lande_. On a review of what I have seen and heard of this\r\ntree, the following seem to be its northern limits. Beginning on the\r\nAtlantic, at the Pyrenees, and along them to the meridian of La Lande,\r\nor of Carcassonne; up that meridian to the Cevennes, as they begin just\r\nthere to raise themselves high enough to afford it shelter. Along the\r\nCevennes, to the parallel of forty-five degrees of latitude, and along\r\nthat parallel (crossing the Rhone near the mouth of the Isere) to the\r\nAlps; thence along the Alps and Apennines, to what parallel of\r\nlatitude I know not. Yet here the tracing of the line becomes the most\r\ninteresting. For from the Atlantic, so far we see this production the\r\neffect of shelter and latitude combined. But where does it venture to\r\nlaunch forth unprotected by shelter, and by the mere force of latitude\r\nalone? Where, for instance, does its northern limit cross the Adriatic?\r\nI learn, that the olive tree resists cold to eight degrees of Reaumur\r\nbelow the freezing-point, which corresponds to fourteen above zero of\r\nFahrenheit: and that the orange resists to four degrees below freezing\r\nof Reaumur, which is twenty-three degrees above zero of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nMay 19. _Castelnaudari. St. Feriol. Escamaze. Lampy_. Some sheep and\r\ncattle; no enclosures. St. Feriol, Escamaze, and Lampy are in the\r\nmontagnes noires. The country almost entirely waste. Some of it in\r\nshrubbery. The _voute d’Escamaze_ is of one hundred and thirty-five\r\nyards. Round about Castelnaudari the country is hilly, as it has been\r\nconstantly from Beziers; it is very rich. Where it is plain, or nearly\r\nplain, the soil is black: in general, however, it is hilly and reddish,\r\nand in corn. They cultivate a great deal of Indian corn here, which they\r\ncall millet; it is planted, but not yet up.\r\n\r\nMay 20. _Castelnaudari. Naurouze. Villefranche. Baziege_. At Naurouze is\r\nthe highest ground which the canal had to pass between the two seas. It\r\nbecame necessary, then, to find water still higher to bring it here. The\r\nriver Fresquel heading by its two principal branches in the _montagnes\r\nnoires_, a considerable distance off to the eastward, the springs of the\r\nmost western one were brought together, and conducted to Naurouze, where\r\nits waters are divided, part furnishing the canal towards the ocean,\r\nthe rest towards the Mediterranean, as far as the _écluse de Fresquel_,\r\nwhere, as has been before noted, the Lampy branch and the Alzau, under\r\nthe name of the Fresquel, enter.\r\n\r\nMay 20. They have found that a lock of six _pieds_ is best; however,\r\neight _pieds_ is well enough. Beyond this, it is bad. Monsieur Pin tells\r\nme of a lock of thirty _pieds_ made in Sweden, of which it is impossible\r\nto open the gates. They therefore divided it into four locks. The small\r\ngates of the locks of this canal have six square _pieds_ of surface.\r\nThey tried the machinery of the jack for opening them. They were more\r\neasily opened, but very subject to be deranged, however strongly\r\nmade. They returned, therefore, to the original wooden screw, which is\r\nexcessively slow and laborious. I calculate that five minutes are lost\r\nat every basin by this screw, which, on the whole number of basins, is\r\none eighth of the time necessary to navigate the canal: and of course,\r\nif a method of lifting the gate at one stroke could be found, it would\r\nreduce the passage from eight to seven days, and the freight equally.\r\nI suggested to Monsieur Pin and others a quadrantal gate, turning on a\r\npivot, and lifted by a lever like a pump-handle, aided by a windlass and\r\ncord, if necessary. He will try it, and inform me of the success. The\r\nprice of transportation from Cette to Bordeaux, through the canal and\r\nGaronne is ------ the quintal: round by the straits of Gibraltar is\r\n------. Two hundred and forty barks, the largest of twenty-two hundred\r\nquintals (or say, in general, of one hundred tons), suffice to perform\r\nthe business of this canal, which is stationary, having neither\r\nincreased nor diminished for many years. When pressed, they can pass and\r\nrepass between Toulouse and Beziers in fourteen days; but sixteen is the\r\ncommon period. The canal is navigated ten and a half months of the year:\r\nthe other month and a half being necessary to lay it dry, cleanse it,\r\nand repair the works. This is done in July and August, when there would\r\nperhaps be a want of water.\r\n\r\nMay 21. _Baziège. Toulouse_. The country continues hilly, but very rich.\r\nIt is in mulberries, willows, some vines, corn, maize, pasture, beans,\r\nflax. A great number of chateaux and good houses in the neighborhood\r\nof the canal. The people partly in farm-houses, partly in villages.\r\nI suspect that the farm-houses are occupied by the farmers, while the\r\nlaborers (who are mostly by the day) reside in the villages. Neither\r\nstrawberries nor pease yet at Baziege or Toulouse. Near the latter are\r\nsome fields of yellow clover.\r\n\r\nAt Toulouse the canal ends. It has four communications with the\r\nMediterranean. 1. Through the ponds of Thau, Frontignan, Palavas,\r\nMaguelone, and Manjo, the _canal de la Radela Aigues-mortes, le canal\r\ndes Salines de Pecair,_ and the arm of the Rhone called _Bras de Fer_,\r\nwhich ends at Fourgues, opposite to Arles, and thence down the Rhone. 2.\r\nAt Cette, by a canal of a few hundred _toises_, leading out of the Etang\r\nde Thau into the sea. The vessels pass the Etang, though a length of\r\nnine thousand _toises_, with sails. 3. At Agde, by the river Eraut,\r\ntwenty-five hundred _toises_. It has but five or six _pieds_ of water\r\nat its mouth. It is joined to the canal at the upper part of this\r\ncommunication, by a branch of a canal two hundred and seventy _toises_\r\nlong. 4. At Narbonne, by a canal they are now opening, which leads from\r\nthe great canal near the aqueduct of the river Cesse, twenty-six hundred\r\n_toises_, into the Aude. This new canal will have five lock-basins,\r\nof about twelve _pieds_ fall each. Then you are to cross the Aude very\r\nobliquely, and descend a branch of it six thousand _toises_, through\r\nfour lock-basins to Narbonne, and from Narbonne down the same branch,\r\ntwelve hundred _toises_ into the _Etang de Sigen_, across that Etang\r\nfour thousand _toises_, issuing at an inlet, called _Grau de la\r\nNouvelle_, into the Gulf of Lyons. But only vessels of thirty or forty\r\ntons can enter this inlet. Of these four communications, that of Cette\r\nonly leads to a deep sea-port, because the exit is there by a canal, and\r\nnot a river. Those by the Rhone, Eraut, and Aude, are blocked up by bars\r\nat the mouths of those rivers. It is remarkable, that all the rivers\r\nrunning into the Mediterranean are obstructed at their entrance by bars\r\nand shallows, which often change their position. This is the case with\r\nthe Nile, Tiber, the Po, the Lez, le Lyoron, the Orbe, the Gly, the\r\nTech, the Tet, he. Indeed, the formation of these bars seems not\r\nconfined to the mouths of the rivers, though it takes place at them more\r\ncertainly. Along almost the whole of the coast, from Marseilles towards\r\nthe Pyrenees, banks of sand are thrown up parallel with the coast, which\r\nhave insulated portions of the sea, that is, formed them into etangs,\r\nponds, or sounds, through which here and there narrow and shallow inlets\r\nonly are preserved by the currents of the rivers. These sounds fill up\r\nin time, with the mud and sand deposited in them by the rivers. Thus the\r\nEtang de Vendres, navigated formerly by vessels of sixty tons, is\r\nnow nearly filled up by the mud and sand of the Aude. The Vistre and\r\nVidourle, which formerly emptied themselves into the Gulf of Lyons, are\r\nnow received by the _Etangs de Manjo_ and Aiguesmortes, that is to\r\nsay, the part of the Gulf of Lyons, which formerly received, and still\r\nreceives those rivers, is now cut off from the sea by a bar of sand,\r\nwhich has been thrown up in it, and has formed it into sounds. Other\r\nproofs that the land gains there on the sea, are, that the towns of\r\nSt. Giles and Notre Dame d’Asposts, formerly seaports, are no far from\r\nthe sea, and that Aiguesmortes, where are still to be seen the iron\r\nrings to which vessels were formerly moored, and where St. Louis\r\nembarked for Palestine, has now in its vicinities only ponds, which\r\ncannot be navigated, and communicates with the sea by an inlet, called\r\n_Grau du Roy_, through which only fishing-barks can pass. It is pretty\r\nwell established, that all the Delta of Egypt has been formed by\r\nthe depositions of the Nile, and the alluvions of the sea, and it is\r\nprobable that that operation is still going on. Has this peculiarity\r\nof the Mediterranean any connection with the scantiness of its tides,\r\nwhich, even at the equinoxes, are of two or three feet only? The\r\ncommunication from the western end of the canal to the ocean, is by\r\nthe river Garonne. This is navigated by flat boats of eight hundred\r\nquintals, when the water is well; but when it is scanty, these boats\r\ncarry only two hundred quintals, till they get to the mouth of the Tarn.\r\nIt has been proposed to open a canal that far from Toulouse, along the\r\nright side of the river.\r\n\r\nMay 22. _Toulouse_. 23. _Agen_. 24. _Castres. Bordeaux_. The Garonne,\r\nand rivers emptying into it, make extensive and rich plains, which are\r\nin mulberries, willows, corn, maize, pasture, beans, and flax. The hills\r\nare in corn, maize, beans, and a considerable proportion of vines. There\r\nseems to be as much maize as corn in this country. Of the latter, there\r\nis more rye than wheat. The maize is now up, and about three inches\r\nhigh. It is sowed in rows two feet or two and a half feet apart, and\r\nis pretty thick in the row. Doubtless they mean to thin it. There is\r\na great deal of a forage they call _farouche_. It is a species of red\r\ntrefoil, with few leaves, a very coarse stalk, and a cylindrical blossom\r\nof two inches in length, and three quarters of an inch in diameter,\r\nconsisting of floscules, exactly as does that of the red clover. It\r\nseems to be a coarse food, but very plentiful. They say it is for their\r\noxen. These are very fine, large, and cream-colored. The services of the\r\nfarm and of transportation are performed chiefly by them. There are a\r\nfew horses and asses, but no mules. Even in the city of Bordeaux we see\r\nscarcely any beasts of draught but oxen. When we cross the Garonne\r\nat Langon, we find the plains entirely of sand and gravel, and they\r\ncontinue so to Bordeaux. Where they are capable of any thing, they\r\nare in vines, which are in rows, four, five, or six feet apart, and\r\nsometimes more. Near Langon is Sauterne, where the best white wines of\r\nBordeaux are made. The waste lands are in fern, furze, shrubbery,\r\nand dwarf trees. The farmers live on their farms. At Agen, Castres,\r\nBordeaux, strawberries and pease are now brought to table; so that the\r\ncountry on the canal of Languedoc seems to have later seasons than\r\nthat east and west of it. What can be the cause? To the eastward, the\r\nprotection of the Cevennes makes the warm season advance sooner. Does\r\nthe neighborhood of the Mediterranean co-operate? And does that of the\r\nocean mollify and advance the season to the westward? There are ortolans\r\nat Agen, but none at Bordeaux. The buildings on the canal and the\r\nGaronne are mostly of brick, the size of the bricks the same with that\r\nof the ancient Roman brick, as seen in the remains of their buildings in\r\nthis country. In those of a circus at Bordeaux, considerable portions\r\nof which are standing, I measured the bricks, and found them nineteen\r\nor twenty inches long, eleven or twelve inches wide, and from one and a\r\nhalf to two inches thick; their texture as fine, compact, and solid as\r\nthat of porcelain. The bricks now made, though of the same dimensions,\r\nare not so fine. They are burnt in a kind of furnace, and make excellent\r\nwork. The elm tree shows itself at Bordeaux peculiarly proper for\r\nbeing spread flat for arbors. Many are done in this way on the Quay des\r\nCharterons. Strawberries, pease, and cherries at Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nMay 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. Bordeaux. The cantons in which the most\r\ncelebrated wines of Bordeaux are made, are Medoc down the river, Grave\r\nadjoining the city, and the parishes next above; all on the same side of\r\nthe river. In the first, is made red wine principally, in the two last,\r\nwhite. In Medoc they plant the vines in cross-rows of three and a half\r\n_pieds_. They keep them so low, that poles extended along the rows one\r\nway, horizontally, about fifteen or eighteen inches above the ground,\r\nserve to tie the vines to, and leave the cross row open to the plough.\r\nIn Grave they set the plants in quincunx, i.e. in equilateral triangles\r\nof three and a half pieds every side; and they stick a pole of six or\r\neight feet high to every vine, separately. The vine-stock is sometimes\r\nthree or four feet high. They find these two methods equal in culture,\r\nduration, quantity, and quality. The former, however, admits the\r\nalternative of tending by hand or with the plough. The grafting of the\r\nvine, though a critical operation, is practised with success. When the\r\ngraft has taken, they bend it into the earth, and let it take root above\r\nthe scar. They begin to yield an indifferent wine at three years old,\r\nbut not a good one till twenty-five years, nor after eighty, when they\r\nbegin to yield less, and worse, and must be renewed. They give three or\r\nfour workings in the year, each worth seventy or seventy-five livres the\r\njournal, which is of eight hundred and forty square ioises, and contains\r\nabout three thousand plants. They dung a little in Medoc and Grave,\r\nbecause of the poverty of the soil; but very little; as more would\r\naffect the wine. The _journal_ yields, _communions annis_, about three\r\n_pièces_ (of two hundred and forty, or two hundred and fifty bottles\r\neach). The vineyards of first quality are all worked by their\r\nproprietors. Those of the second, rent for three hundred livres the\r\njournal: those of third, at two hundred livres. They employ a kind of\r\noverseer at four or five hundred livres the year, finding him lodging\r\nand drink: but he feeds himself. He superintends and directs, though\r\nhe is expected to work but little. If the proprietor has a garden, the\r\noverseer tends that. They never hire laborers by the year. The day wages\r\nfor a man are thirty sous, a woman’s fifteen sous, feeding themselves.\r\nThe women make the bundles of sarment, weed, pull off the snails, tie\r\nthe vines, and gather the grapes. During the vintage they are paid high,\r\nand fed well.\r\n\r\nOf Red wines, there are four vineyards of the first quality; viz. 1.\r\n_Chateau Margau_, belonging to the Marquis d’Agincourt, who makes about\r\none hundred and fifty tons, of one thousand bottles each. He has\r\nengaged to Jernon, a merchant. 2. _La Tour de Segur, en Saint Lambert_,\r\nbelonging to Monsieur Miresmenil, who makes one hundred and twenty-five\r\ntons. 3. _Hautbrion_, belonging two-thirds to M. le Comte de Femelle,\r\nwho has engaged to Barton, a merchant: the other third to the Comte de\r\nToulouse, at Toulouse. The whole is seventy-five tons. 4. _Chateau de\r\nla Fite_, belonging to the President Pichard, at Bordeaux, who makes one\r\nhundred and seventy-five tons. The wines of the three first, are not in\r\nperfection till four years old: those of _de la Fite_, being somewhat\r\nlighter, are good at three years; that is, the crop of 1786 is good in\r\nthe spring of 1789. These growths, of the year 1783, sell now at two\r\nthousand livres the ton; those of 1784, on account of the superior\r\nquality of that vintage, sell at twenty-four hundred livres; those of\r\n1785, at eighteen hundred livres; those of 1786, at eighteen hundred\r\nlivres, though they had sold at first for only fifteen hundred livres.\r\nRed wines of the second quality, are Rozan, Dabbadie or Lionville, la\r\nRose, Qui-rouen, Durfort; in all eight hundred tons, which sell at\r\none thousand livres, new. The third class, are Galons, Mouton, Gassie,\r\nArboete, Pontette, de Ferme, Candale; in all two thousand tons, at eight\r\nor nine hundred livres. After these, they are reckoned common wines, and\r\nsell from five hundred livres, down to one hundred and twenty livres,\r\nthe ton. All red wines decline after a certain age, losing color,\r\nflavor, and body. Those of Bordeaux begin to decline at about seven\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nOf White wines, those made in the canton of Grave, are most esteemed at\r\nBordeaux. The best crops are, 1. _Pontac_, which formerly belonged to M.\r\nde Pontac, but now to M. de Lamont. He makes forty tons, which sell at\r\nfour hundred livres, new. 2. _St. Brise_, belonging to M. de Pontac;\r\nthirty tons, at three hundred and fifty livres. 3. _De Carbonius_,\r\nbelonging to the Benedictine monks, who make fifty tons, and never\r\nselling till three or four years old, get eight hundred livres the ton.\r\nThose made in the three parishes next above Grave, and more esteemed\r\nat Paris, are, 1. _Sauterne_. The best crop belongs to M. Diquem at\r\nBordeaux, or to M. de Salus, his son-in-law; one hundred and fifty tons,\r\nat three hundred livres, new, and six hundred livres, old. The next best\r\ncrop is M. de Fillotte’s, one hundred tons, sold at the same price. 2.\r\n_Prignac_. The best is the President du Roy’s, at Bordeaux. He makes one\r\nhundred and seventy-five tons, which sell at three hundred livres, new,\r\nand six hundred livres, old. Those of 1784, for their extraordinary\r\nquality, sell at eight hundred livres. 3. _Barsac_. The best belongs\r\nto the President Pichard, who makes one hundred and fifty tons, at two\r\nhundred and eighteen livres, new, and six hundred livres, old. Sauterne\r\nis the pleasantest; next Prignac, and lastly Barsac: but Barsac is the\r\nstrongest; next Prignac, and lastly Sauterne; and all stronger than\r\nGrave. There are other good crops made in the same parishes of Sauterne,\r\nPrignac, and Barsac; but none as good as these. There is a virgin wine,\r\nwhich, though made of a red grape, is of a light rose color, because,\r\nbeing made without pressure, the coloring matter of the skin does not\r\nmix with the juice. There are other white wines, from the preceding\r\nprices down to seventy-five livres. In general, the white wines keep\r\nlongest. They will be in perfection till fifteen or twenty years of age.\r\nThe best vintage now to be bought, is of 1784; both of red and white.\r\nThere has been no other good year since 1779. The celebrated vineyards\r\nbefore mentioned, are plains, as is generally the canton of Medoc,\r\nand that of the Grave. The soil of Hautbrion, particularly, which I\r\nexamined, is a sand, in which is near as much round gravel or small\r\nstone, and very little loam: and this is the general soil of Medoc. That\r\nof Pontac, which I examined also, is a little different. It is clayey,\r\nwith a fourth or fifth of fine rotten stone; and at two feet depth,\r\nit becomes all a rotten stone. M. de Lamont tells me, he has a kind of\r\ngrape without seeds, which I did not formerly suppose to exist; but I\r\nsaw at Marseilles dried raisins from Smyrna without seeds. I see in his\r\nfarm at Pontac, some plants of white clover, and a good deal of yellow:\r\nalso some small peach trees in the open ground. The principal English\r\nwine merchants at Bordeaux, are Jernon, Barton, Johnston, Foster,\r\nSkinner, Copinger, and M’Cartey: the chief French wine merchants, are\r\nFeger, Nerac, Bruneaux Jauge, and Du Verget. Desgrands, a wine-broker,\r\ntells me they never mix the wines of first quality: but that they mix\r\nthe inferior ones to improve them. The smallest wines make the best\r\nbrandy. They yield about a fifth or sixth.\r\n\r\nMay 28, 29. From Bordeaux to Blaye, the country near the river is hilly,\r\nchiefly in vines, some corn, some pasture: further out, are plains,\r\nboggy and waste. The soil, in both cases, clay and grit. Some sheep\r\non the waste. To Etauliers, we have sometimes boggy plains, sometimes\r\nwaving grounds and sandy, always poor, generally waste, in fern and\r\nfurze, with some corn however, interspersed. To Mirambeau and St. Genis,\r\nit is hilly, poor, and mostly waste. There are some corn and maize\r\nhowever, and better trees than usual. Towards Pons, it becomes a little\r\nred, mostly rotten stone. There are vines, corn, and maize, which is up.\r\nAt Pons we approach the Charente; the country becomes better, a blackish\r\nmould mixed with a rotten chalky stone: a great many vines, corn, maize,\r\nand farouche. From Lajart to Saintes and Rochefort, the soil is reddish,\r\nits foundation a chalky rock, at about a foot depth; in vines, corn,\r\nmaize, clover, lucerne, and pasture. There are more and better trees\r\nthan I have seen in all my journey; a great many apple and cherry trees:\r\nfine cattle and many sheep.\r\n\r\nMay 30. From Rochefort to La Rochelle, it is sometimes hilly and red,\r\nwith a chalky foundation, middling good; in corn, pasture, and some\r\nwaste: sometimes it is reclaimed marsh, in clover and corn, except the\r\nparts accessible to the tide, which are in wild grass. About Rochelle,\r\nit is a low plain. Towards Usseau, and halfway to Marans, level\r\nhighlands, red, mixed with an equal quantity of broken chalk; mostly\r\nin vines, some corn, and pasture: then to Marans and halfway to St.\r\nHermine, it is reclaimed marsh, dark, tolerably good, and all in\r\npasture: there we rise to plains a little higher, red, with a chalky\r\nfoundation, boundless to the eye, and altogether in corn and maize.\r\n\r\nMay 31. At St. Hermine, the country becomes very hilly, a red clay\r\nmixed with chalky stone, generally waste, in furze and broom, with some\r\npatches of corn and maize; and so it continues to Chantonay, and St.\r\nFulgent. Through the whole of this road from Bordeaux, are frequent\r\nhedge rows, and small patches of forest wood, not good, yet better than\r\nI had seen in the preceding part of my journey. Towards Montaigu, the\r\nsoil mends a little; the cultivated parts in corn and pasture, the\r\nuncultivated in broom. It is in very small enclosures of ditch and\r\nquickset. On approaching the Loire to Nantes, the country is leveller:\r\nthe soil from Rochelle to this place may be said to have been sometimes\r\nred, but oftener gray, and always on a chalky foundation. The last\r\ncensus, of about 1770, made one hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants\r\nat Nantes. They conjecture there are now one hundred and fifty thousand,\r\nwhich equals it to Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nJune 1,2. The country from Nantes to L’Orient is very hilly and poor,\r\nthe soil gray; nearly half is waste, in furze and broom, among which is\r\nsome poor grass. The cultivated parts are in corn, some maize, a good\r\nmany apple trees; no vines. All is in small enclosures of quick hedge\r\nand ditch. There are patches and hedge-rows of forest-wood, not quite\r\ndeserving the name of timber. The people are mostly in villages; they\r\neat rye-bread, and are ragged. The villages announce a general poverty,\r\nas does every other appearance. Women smite on the anvil, and work with\r\nthe hoe, and cows are yoked to labor. There are great numbers of cattle,\r\ninsomuch that butter is their staple. Neither asses nor mules: yet it\r\nis said that the fine mules I have met with on my journey, are raised\r\nin Poictou. There are but few _chateaux_ here. I observe mill-ponds, and\r\nhoes with long handles. Have they not, in common with us, derived\r\nthese from England, of which Bretagne is probably a colony? L’Orient is\r\nsupposed to contain twenty-five thousand inhabitants. They tell me here,\r\nthat to make a reasonable profit on potash and pearlash, as bought in\r\nAmerica, the former should sell at thirty livres, the latter thirty-six\r\nlivres, the quintal. Of turpentine they make no use in their vessels.\r\nBayonne furnishes pitch enough; but tar is in demand, and ours sells\r\nwell. The tower of L’Orient is sixty-five _pieds_ above the level of\r\nthe sea, one hundred and twenty _pieds_ high, twenty-five _pieds_ in\r\ndiameter; the stairs four feet radius, and cost thirty thousand livres,\r\nbesides the materials of the old tower.\r\n\r\nJune 3, 4, 5. The country and productions from L’Orient to Rennes, and\r\nfrom Rennes to Nantes, are precisely similar to those from Nantes to\r\nL’Orient. About Rennes, it is somewhat leveller, perhaps less poor, and\r\nalmost entirely in pasture. The soil always gray. Some small, separate\r\nhouses, which seem to be the residence of laborers, or very small\r\nfarmers; the walls frequently of mud, and the roofs generally covered\r\nwith slate. Great plantations of walnut, and frequently of pine. Some\r\napple trees and sweet-briar still in bloom, and broom generally so. I\r\nhave heard no nightingale since the last day of May. There are gates\r\nin this country made in such a manner, that the top rail of the gate\r\novershoots backwards the hind post, so as to counterpoise the gate, and\r\nprevent its swagging.\r\n\r\n_Nantes_. Vessels of eight feet draught only can come to Nantes. Those\r\nwhich are larger, lie at Painboeuf, ten leagues below Nantes, and five\r\nleagues above the mouth of the river. There is a continued navigation\r\nfrom Nantes to Paris, through the Loire, the canal de Briare and the\r\nSeine. Carolina rice is preferred to that of Lombardy for the Guinea\r\ntrade, because it requires less water to boil it.\r\n\r\nJune 6, 7, 8. _Nantes. Ancenis. Angers. Tours_. Ascending the Loire\r\nfrom Nantes, the road, as far as Angers, leads over the hills, which are\r\ngray, oftener below than above mediocrity, and in corn, pasture, vines,\r\nsome maize, flax, and hemp. There are no waste lands. About the limits\r\nof Bretagne and Anjou, which are between Loriottiere and St. George, the\r\nlands change for the better. Here and there, we get views of the plains\r\non the Loire, of some extent, and good appearance, in corn and\r\npasture. After passing Angers, the road is raised out of the reach of\r\ninundations, so as at the same time to ward them off from the interior\r\nplains. It passes generally along the river side; but sometimes leads\r\nthrough the plains, which, after we pass Angers, become extensive and\r\ngood, in corn, pasture, some maize, hemp, flax, pease, and beans; many\r\nwillows, also poplars and walnuts. The flax is near ripe. Sweet-briar\r\nin general bloom. Some broom here still, on which the cattle and sheep\r\nbrowse in winter and spring, when they have no other green food; and\r\nthe hogs eat the blossoms and pods, in spring and summer. This blossom,\r\nthough disagreeable when smelt in a small quantity, is of delicious\r\nfragrance when there is a whole field of it. There are some considerable\r\nvineyards in the river plains, just before we reach Les Trois Volets\r\n(which is at the one hundred and thirty-sixth milestone), and after\r\nthat, where the hills on the left come into view, they are mostly in\r\nvines. Their soil is clayey and stony, a little reddish, and of southern\r\naspect. The hills on the other side of the river, looking to the north,\r\nare not in vines. There is very good wine made on these hills; not equal\r\nindeed to the Bordeaux of best quality, but to that of good quality, and\r\nlike it. It is a great article of exportation from Anjou and Touraine,\r\nand probably is sold abroad, under the name of Bordeaux. They are now\r\nmowing the first crop of hay. All along both hills of the Loire, is a\r\nmass of white stone, not durable, growing black with time, and so\r\nsoft, that the people cut their houses out of the solid, with all the\r\npartitions, chimnies, doors, &c. The hill sides resemble cony burrows,\r\nfull of inhabitants. The borders of the Loire are almost a continued\r\nvillage. There are many chateaux: many cattle, sheep, and horses; some\r\nasses.\r\n\r\nTours is at the one hundred and nineteenth mile-stone. Being desirous\r\nof inquiring here into a fact stated by Voltaire, in his _Questions\r\nEncylopédiques_, article _Coquilles_, relative to the growth of shells\r\nunconnected with animal bodies at the _Chateau_ of Monsieur de la\r\nSauvagiere, near Tours, I called on Monsieur Gentil, _premier sécrétaire\r\nde l’ntendance_, to whom the Intendant had written on my behalf, at the\r\nrequest of the Marquis de Chastellux.\r\n\r\nI stated to him the fact as advanced by Voltaire, and found he was, of\r\nall men, the best to whom I could have addressed myself. He told me he\r\nhad been in correspondence with Voltaire on that very subject, and was\r\nperfectly acquainted with Monsieur de la Sauvagiere, and the Faluniere\r\nwhere the fact is said to have taken place. It is at the Chateau de\r\nGrillemont, six leagues from Tours, on the road to Bordeaux, belonging\r\nnow to Monsieur d’Orcai. He says, that De la Sauvagiere was a man of\r\ntruth, and might be relied on for whatever facts he stated as of his\r\nown observation; but that he was overcharged with imagination, which, in\r\nmatters of opinion and theory, often led him beyond his facts; that this\r\nfeature in his character had appeared principally in what he wrote on\r\nthe antiquities of Touraine; but that as to the fact in question,\r\nhe believed him. That he himself, indeed, had not watched the same\r\nidentical shells, as Sauvagiere had done, growing from small to great;\r\nbut that he had often seen such masses of those shells of all sizes,\r\nfrom a point to a full size, as to carry conviction to his mind that\r\nthey were in the act of growing; that he had once made a collection\r\nof shells for the Emperor’s cabinet, reserving duplicates of them\r\nfor himself; and that these afforded proofs of the same fact; that he\r\nafterwards gave those duplicates to a Monsieur du Verget, a physician\r\nof Tours, of great science and candor, who was collecting on a\r\nlarger scale, and who was perfectly in sentiment with Monsieur de la\r\nSauvagiere, and not only the Faluniere, but many other places about\r\nTours, would convince any unbiassed observer, that shells are a fruit\r\nof the earth, spontaneously produced; and he gave me a copy of De la\r\nSauvagiere’s _Recueil de Dissertations_, presented him by the author,\r\nwherein is one _Sur la vegetation spontanée des coquilles du Chateau\r\ndes Places_. So far, I repeat from him. What are we to conclude? That we\r\nhave not materials enough yet, to form any conclusion. The fact stated\r\nby Sauvagiere is not against any law of nature, and is therefore\r\npossible; but it is so little analogous to her habitual processes,\r\nthat, if true, it would be extraordinary: that to command our belief,\r\ntherefore, there should be such a suite of observations, as that their\r\nuntruth would be more extraordinary than the existence of the fact they\r\naffirm. The bark of trees, the skin of fruits and animals, the\r\nfeathers of birds, receive their growth and nutriment from the internal\r\ncirculation of a juice through the vessels of the individual they cover.\r\nWe conclude from analogy, then, that the shells of the testaceous tribe\r\nreceive also their growth from a like internal circulation. If it be\r\nurged, that this does not exclude the possibility of a like shell being\r\nproduced by the passage of a fluid through the pores of the circumjacent\r\nbody, whether of earth, stone, or water; I answer, that it is not within\r\nthe usual economy of nature, to use two processes for one species of\r\nproduction. While I withhold my assent, however, from this hypothesis,\r\nI must deny it to every other I have ever seen, by which their authors\r\npretend to account for the origin of shells in high places. Some of\r\nthese are against the laws of nature, and therefore impossible; and\r\nothers are built on positions more difficult to assent to, than that\r\nof De la Sauvagiere. They all suppose these shells to have covered\r\nsubmarine animals, and have then to answer the question, How came they\r\nfifteen thousand feet above the level of the sea? And they answer it, by\r\ndemanding what cannot be conceded. One, therefore, who had rather have\r\nno opinion than a false one, will suppose this question one of those\r\nbeyond the investigation of human sagacity; or wait till further and\r\nfuller observations enable him to decide it.\r\n\r\n_Chanteloup_. I heard a nightingale to-day at Chanteloup. The gardener\r\nsays it is the male, who alone sings, while the female sits; and\r\nthat when the young are hatched, he also ceases. In the boudoir at\r\nChanteloup, is an ingenious contrivance to hide the projecting steps of\r\na staircase. Three steps were of necessity to project into the boudoir:\r\nthey are therefore made triangular steps; and instead of being rested on\r\nthe floor, as usual, they are made fast at their broad end to the stair\r\ndoor, swinging out and in, with that. When it shuts, it runs them under\r\nthe other steps; when open it brings them out to their proper place. In\r\nthe kitchen garden, are three pumps, worked by one horse. The pumps\r\nare placed in an equilateral triangle, each side of which is of about\r\nthirty-five feet. In the centre is a post, ten or twelve feet high,\r\nand one foot in diameter. In the top of this, enters the bent end of a\r\nlever, of about twelve or fifteen feet long, with a swingle-tree at the\r\nother end. About three feet from the bent end, it receives, on a pin,\r\nthree horizontal bars of iron, which at their other end lay hold of one\r\ncorner of a quadrantal crank (like a bell crank) moving in a vertical\r\nplane, to the other corner of which is hooked the vertical handle of\r\nthe pump. The crank turns on its point as a centre, by a pin or pivot\r\npassing through it. The horse moving the lever horizontally in a circle,\r\nevery point of the lever describes a horizontal circle. That which\r\nreceives the three bars, describes a circle of six feet in diameter.\r\nIt gives a stroke then of six feet to the handle of each pump, at each\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n_Blois. Orleans_. June 9, 10. At Blois, the road leaves the river, and\r\ntraverses the hills, which are mostly reddish, sometimes gray, good\r\nenough, in vines, corn, saintfoin. From Orleans to the river Juines, at\r\nEtampes, it is a continued plain of corn, and saintfoin, tolerably good,\r\nsometimes gray, sometimes red. From Etampes to Etrechy, the country is\r\nmountainous and rocky, resembling that of Fontainebleau. _Quere_. If it\r\nmay not be the same vein?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVIII.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, June 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, June 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nHaving got back to Paris three days ago, I resume immediately the\r\ncorrespondence with which you have been pleased to honor me. I wish I\r\ncould have begun it with more agreeable information than that furnished\r\nme by Mr. Grand, that the funds of the United States here are exhausted,\r\nand himself considerably in advance; and by the board of treasury at New\r\nYork, that they have no immediate prospect of furnishing us supplies. We\r\nare thus left to shift for ourselves, without previous warning. As soon\r\nas they shall replenish Mr. Grand’s hands, I will give you notice, that\r\nyou may recommence your usual drafts on him; unless the board should\r\nprovide a separate fund for you, dependant on yourself alone, which I\r\nhave strongly and repeatedly pressed on them, in order to remove the\r\nindecency of suffering your drafts to pass through any intermediate hand\r\nfor payment.\r\n\r\nMy letters from America came down to the 24th of April. The disturbances\r\nin the Eastern States were entirely settled. I do not learn that\r\nthe government had made any examples. Mr. Hancock’s health being\r\nre-established, the want of which had occasioned him to resign the\r\ngovernment of Massachusetts, he has been re-elected to the exclusion of\r\nGovernor Bowdoin. New York still refuses to pass the impost in any form,\r\nand were she to pass it, Pennsylvania will not uncouple it from the\r\nsupplementary funds. These two States and Virginia, are the only ones,\r\nmy letters say, which have paid any thing into the Continental treasury,\r\nfor a twelvemonth past. I send you a copy of a circular letter from\r\nCongress to the several States, insisting on their removing all\r\nobstructions to the recovery of British debts. This was hurried, that it\r\nmight be delivered to the Assembly of New York before they rose. It was\r\ndelivered, but they did nothing in consequence of it. The convention to\r\nbe assembled at Philadelphia will be an able one. Ten States were known\r\nto have appointed delegates. Maryland was about to appoint; Connecticut\r\nwas doubtful; and Rhode Island had refused. We are sure, however, of\r\neleven States. South Carolina has prohibited the importation of slaves\r\nfor three years; which is a step towards a perpetual prohibition.\r\nBetween six and seven hundred thousand acres of land are actually\r\nsurveyed into townships, and the sales are to begin immediately.\r\nThey are not to be sold for less than a dollar the acre, in public\r\ncertificates. I wrote you from Bordeaux on the subject of Colonel Smith.\r\nI was sorry I missed him there, for other reasons as well as from a\r\ncuriosity to know his errand. The Notables have laid the foundation\r\nof much good here: you have seen it detailed in the public papers. The\r\nPrince of Wales is likely to recover from his illness, which was very\r\nthreatening. It is feared, that three powers have combined to lift the\r\nPrince of Orange out of his difficulties. Have you yet the cipher of\r\nwhich I formerly wrote to you, or any copy of it?\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIX.--TO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR, June 19, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nParis, June 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of April the 23d, from New York, and am sorry\r\nto find you have had a relapse. Time and temperance, however, will cure\r\nyou; to which add exercise. I hope you have long ago had a happy meeting\r\nwith your friends, with whom a few hours would be to me an ineffable\r\nfeast. The face of Europe appears a little turbid, but all will subside.\r\nThe Empress has endeavored to bully the Turk, who laughed at her,\r\nand she is going back. The Emperor’s reformations have occasioned the\r\nappearance of insurrection in Flanders, and he, according to character,\r\nwill probably tread back his steps. A change of system here with respect\r\nto the Dutch, is suspected; because the Kings of Prussia and England\r\nopenly espouse the cause of the Stadtholder, and that of the Patriots is\r\nlikely to fall. The American acquaintances whom you left here, not being\r\nstationary, you will hardly expect news of them. Mrs. Barrett, lately\r\ndead, was, I think, known to you. I had a letter from Ledyard lately,\r\ndated at St. Petersburg. He had but two shirts, and yet more shirts than\r\nshillings. Still he was determined to obtain the palm of being the first\r\ncircumambulator of the earth. He says, that having no money, they kick\r\nhim from place to place, and thus he expects to be kicked round the\r\nglobe. Are you become a great walker? You know I preach up that kind\r\nof exercise. Shall I send you a _conte-pas_? It will cost you a dozen\r\nlouis, but be a great stimulus to walking, as it will record your steps.\r\nI finished my tour a week or ten days ago. I went as far as\r\nTurin, Milan, Genoa; and never passed three months and a half more\r\ndelightfully. I returned through the canal of Languedoc, by Bordeaux,\r\nNantes, L’Orient, and Rennes; then returned to Nantes, and came up the\r\nLoire to Orleans. I was alone through the whole, and think one travels\r\nmore usefully when alone, because he reflects more.\r\n\r\nPresent me in the most friendly terms to Mrs. Bannister and to your\r\nfather, and be assured of the sincere esteem of, Dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LX.--TO JAMES MADISON, June 20, 1787*\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, June 20, 1787.\r\n\r\n     [* Much of this letter is in cipher: but the notes annexed\r\n     to it, have enabled the Editor to decipher and publish it.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 30th of January, with a Postscript of February\r\nthe 5th. Having set out the last day of that month to try the waters\r\nof Aix, and been journeying since, till the 10th instant, I have been\r\nunable to continue my correspondence with you. In the mean time, I have\r\nreceived your several favors of February the 15th, March the 18th and\r\n19th, and April the 23d. The last arrived here about the 25th of May,\r\nwhile those of March the 18th and 19th, though written, five weeks\r\nearlier, arrived three weeks later. I mention this, to show you how\r\nuncertain is the conveyance through England.\r\n\r\nThe idea of separating the executive business of the confederacy from\r\nCongress, as the judiciary is already, in some degree, is just and\r\nnecessary. I had frequently pressed on the members individually, while\r\nin Congress, the doing this by a resolution of Congress for appointing\r\nan executive committee, to act during the sessions of Congress, as\r\nthe committee of the States was to act during their vacations. But the\r\nreferring to this committee all executive business, as it should present\r\nitself, would require a more persevering self-denial than I suppose\r\nCongress to possess. It will be much better to make that separation by\r\na federal act. The negative proposed to be given them on all the acts\r\nof the several legislatures, is now, for the first time, suggested to\r\nmy mind. _Prima facie_, I do not like it. It fails in an essential\r\ncharacter; that the hole and the patch should be commensurate. But this\r\nproposes to mend a small hole, by covering the whole garment. Not more\r\nthan one out of one hundred State acts, concern the confederacy. This\r\nproposition, then, in order to give them one degree of power, which\r\nthey ought to have, gives them ninety-nine more, which they ought not\r\nto have, upon a presumption that they will not exercise the ninety-nine.\r\nBut upon every act there will be a preliminary question, Does this act\r\nconcern the confederacy? And was there ever a proposition so plain, as\r\nto pass Congress without a debate? Their decisions are almost always\r\nwise; they are like pure metal. But you know of how much dross this is\r\nthe result. Would not an appeal from the State judicature to a federal\r\ncourt, in all cases where the act of Confederation controlled the\r\nquestion, be as effectual a remedy, and exactly commensurate to the\r\ndefect. A British creditor, for example, sues for his debt in Virginia;\r\nthe defendant pleads an act of the State, excluding him from their\r\ncourts; the plaintiff urges the confederation, and the treaty made under\r\nthat, as controlling the State law; the judges are weak enough to decide\r\naccording to the views of their legislature. An appeal to a federal\r\ncourt gets all to rights. It will be said, that this court may encroach\r\non the jurisdiction of the State courts. It may. But there will be a\r\npower, to wit, Congress, to watch and restrain them. But place the same\r\nauthority in Congress itself, and there will be no power above them\r\nto perform the same office. They will restrain within due bounds a\r\njurisdiction exercised by others, much more rigorously than if exercised\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy at seeing that the sale of our western lands is not yet\r\ncommenced. That valuable fund for the immediate extinction of our debt\r\nwill, I fear, be suffered to slip through our fingers. Every day exposes\r\nit to events, which no human foresight can guard against. When we\r\nconsider the temper of the people of that country, derived from the\r\ncircumstances which surround them, we must suppose their separation\r\npossible, at every moment. If they can be retained till their\r\ngovernments become settled and wise, they will remain with us always,\r\nand be a precious part of our strength and our virtue. But this affair\r\nof the Mississippi, by showing that Congress is capable of hesitating\r\non a question, which proposes a clear sacrifice of the western to the\r\nmaritime States, will with difficulty be obliterated. The proposition\r\nof my going to Madrid, to try to recover there the ground which has\r\nbeen lost at New York, by the concession of the vote of seven States, I\r\nshould think desperate. With respect to myself, weighing the pleasure of\r\nthe journey and bare possibility of success in one scale, and the strong\r\nprobability of failure and the public disappointment directed on me, in\r\nthe other, the latter preponderates. Add to this, that jealousy might be\r\nexcited in the breast of a person, who could find occasions of making me\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\nThe late changes in the ministry here, excite considerable hopes. I\r\nthink we gain in them all. I am particularly happy at the reentry of\r\nMalesherbes into the Council. His knowledge and integrity render his\r\nvalue inappreciable, and the greater to me, because, while he had\r\nno views of office, we had established together the most unreserved\r\nintimacy. So far, too, I am pleased with Montmorin. His honesty proceeds\r\nfrom the heart as well as the head, and therefore may be more surely\r\ncounted on. The King loves business, economy, order, and justice, and\r\nwishes sincerely the good of his people; but he is irascible, rude, very\r\nlimited in his understanding, and religious bordering on bigotry. He has\r\nno mistress, loves his queen, and is too much governed by her. She is\r\ncapricious, like her brother, and governed by him; devoted to pleasure\r\nand expense; and not remarkable for any other vices or virtues.\r\nUnhappily the King shows a propensity for the pleasures of the table.\r\nThat for drink has increased lately, or at least it has become more\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nFor European news in general, I will refer you to my letter to Mr. Jay.\r\nIs it not possible, that the occurrences in Holland may excite a desire\r\nin many of leaving that country, and transferring their effects out of\r\nit, and thus make an opening for shifting into their hands the debts\r\ndue to this country, to its officers, and Farmers? It would be surely\r\neligible. I believe Dumas, if put on the watch, might alone suffice; but\r\nhe surely might, if Mr. Adams should go when the moment offers. Dumas\r\nhas been in the habit of sending his letters open to me, to be forwarded\r\nto Mr. Jay. During my absence, they passed through Mr. Short’s hands,\r\nwho made extracts from them, by which I see he has been recommending\r\nhimself and me for the money-negotiations in Holland. It might be\r\nthought, perhaps, that I have encouraged him in this. Be assured, my\r\nDear Sir, that no such idea ever entered my head. On the contrary, it is\r\na business which would be the most disagreeable to me of all others,\r\nand for which I am the most unfit person living. I do not understand\r\nbargaining, nor possess the dexterity requisite for the purpose. On the\r\nother hand, Mr. Adams, whom I expressly and sincerely recommend, stands\r\nalready on ground for that business, which I could not gain in years.\r\nPray set me to rights in the minds of those, who may have supposed me\r\nprivy to this proposition. _En passant_, I will observe with respect to\r\nMr. Dumas, that the death of the Count de Vergennes places Congress more\r\nat their ease, how to dispose of him. Our credit has been ill treated\r\nhere in public debate, and our debt here deemed apocryphal. We should\r\ntry to transfer this debt elsewhere, and leave nothing capable of\r\nexciting ill thoughts between us. I shall mention in my letter to Mr.\r\nJay, a disagreeable affair which Mr. Barclay has been thrown into,\r\nat Bordeaux. An honester man cannot be found, nor a slower, nor more\r\ndecisive one. His affairs, too, are so embarrassed and desperate, that\r\nthe public reputation is, every moment, in danger of being\r\ncompromitted with him. He is perfectly amiable and honest, with all his\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nBy the next packet, I shall be able to send you some books, as also your\r\nwatch and pedometer. The two last are not yet done. To search for books,\r\nand forward them to Havre, will require more time than I had between\r\nmy return and the departure of this packet. Having been a witness,\r\nheretofore, to the divisions in Congress on the subject of their foreign\r\nministers, it would be a weakness in me to suppose none with respect to\r\nmyself, or to count with any confidence on the renewal of my commission,\r\nwhich expires on the 10th day of March next; and the more so, as instead\r\nof requiring the disapprobation of seven States, as formerly, that of\r\none suffices for a recall, when Congress consists of only seven States,\r\ntwo, when of eight, &c. which I suppose to be habitually their numbers\r\nat present. Whenever I leave this place, it will be necessary to begin\r\nmy arrangements six months before my departure; and these, once fairly\r\nbegun and under way, and my mind set homewards, a change of purpose\r\ncould hardly take place. If it should be the desire of Congress that I\r\nshould continue still longer, I could wish to know it, at farthest, by\r\nthe packet which will sail from New York in September. Because, were\r\nI to put off longer the quitting my house, selling my furniture, he,\r\nI should not have time left to wind up my affairs; and having once\r\nquitted, and sold off my furniture, I could not think of establishing\r\nmyself here again. I take the liberty of mentioning this matter to you,\r\nnot with a desire to change the purpose of Congress, but to know it in\r\ntime. I have never fixed in my mind, the epoch of my return, so far as\r\nshall depend on myself, but I never supposed it very distant. Probably\r\nI shall not risk a second vote on this subject. Such trifling things may\r\ndraw on me the displeasure of one or two States, and thus submit me to\r\nthe disgrace of a recall.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the paccan nuts, which accompanied your letter of March.\r\nCould you procure me a copy of the bill for proportioning crimes and\r\npunishments, in the form in which it was ultimately rejected by the\r\nHouse of Delegates? Young Mr. Bannister desired me to send him regularly\r\nthe _Mercure de France_. I will ask leave to do this through you, and\r\nthat you will adopt such method of forwarding them to him, as will save\r\nhim from being submitted to postage, which they would not be worth. As\r\na compensation for your trouble, you will be free to keep them till you\r\nshall have read them. I am, with sentiments of the most sincere esteem,\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXI.--TO JOHN JAY, June 21,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, June 21,1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you in a letter of May the 4th, from\r\nMarseilles, which was to have gone by the last packet. Bat it arrived\r\na few hours too late for that conveyance, and has been committed to a\r\nprivate one, passing through England, with a promise that it should go\r\nthrough no post-office.\r\n\r\nI was desirous, while at the sea-ports, to obtain a list of the American\r\nvessels which have come to them since the peace, in order to estimate\r\ntheir comparative importance to us, as well as the general amount of our\r\ncommerce with this country, so far as carried on in our own bottoms.\r\nAt Marseilles, I found there had been thirty-two, since that period; at\r\nCette, not a single one; at Bayonne, one of our free ports, only one.\r\nThis last fact I learned from other information, not having visited that\r\nplace; as it would have been a deviation from my route, too considerable\r\nfor the importance of the object. At Bordeaux, Nantes, and L’Orient, I\r\ncould not obtain lists in the moment; but am in hopes I shall be able\r\nto get them ere long. Though more important to us, they will probably be\r\nmore imperfect than that of Marseilles. At Nantes, I began with Monsieur\r\nDobrée an arrangement of his claims. I visited the military stores,\r\nwhich have been detained there so long, opened some boxes of each\r\nkind, and found the state of their contents much better than had been\r\nrepresented. An exact list of the articles is to be sent me.\r\n\r\nThe importations into L’Orient of other fish-oils, besides those of the\r\nwhale, brought to my notice there a defect in the letter of Monsieur de\r\nCalonne, of October the 22nd, which letter was formerly communicated to\r\nyou. In that, whale oil only was named. The other fish-oils, therefore,\r\nhave continued to pay the old duties. In a conference with Monsieur de\r\nVilledeuil, the present Comptroller General, since my return, I proposed\r\nthe extending the exemption to all fish-oils, according to the letter\r\nof the Hanseatic treaty, which had formed the basis of the regulations\r\nrespecting us. I think this will be agreed to. The delays of office\r\nfirst, then the illness of Monsieur de Colonne, and lastly, his removal\r\nand the throng of business occasioned by the _Assemblée des Notables_,\r\nhave prevented the reducing the substance of the letter into the form\r\nof an _Arrêt_, as yet though I have continued soliciting it as much\r\nas circumstances would bear. I am now promised that it shall be done\r\nimmediately, and it shall be so far retrospective to the date of the\r\nletter, as that all duties paid since that, shall be refunded.\r\n\r\nThe new accessions of the ministry are valued here. Good is hoped from\r\nthe Archbishop of Toulouse, who succeeds the Count de Vergennes as _Chef\r\ndu Conseil de finance_. Monsieur de Villedeuil, the Comptroller General,\r\nhas been approved by the public, in the offices he has heretofore\r\nexercised. The Duke de Nivernois, called to the Council, is reckoned\r\na good and able man; and Monsieur de Malesherbes, called also to the\r\nCouncil, is unquestionably the first character in the kingdom, for\r\nintegrity, patriotism, knowledge, and experience in business. There is a\r\nfear that the Marechal de Castries is disposed to retire.\r\n\r\nThe face of things in Europe is a little turbid, at present; but\r\nprobably all will subside. The Empress of Russia, it is supposed, will\r\nnot push her pretensions against the Turks to actual war. Weighing\r\nthe fondness of the Emperor for innovation, against his want of\r\nperseverance, it is difficult to calculate what he will do with his\r\ndiscontented subjects in Brabant and Flanders. If those provinces alone\r\nwere concerned, he would probably give back; but this would induce an\r\nopposition to his plan, in all his other dominions. Perhaps he may be\r\nable to find a compromise. The cause of the Patriots in Holland is a\r\nlittle clouded at present.\r\n\r\nEngland and Prussia seem disposed to interpose effectually. The former\r\nhas actually ordered a fleet of six sail of the line, northwardly, under\r\nGore; and the latter threatens to put her troops into motion. The\r\ndanger of losing such a weight in their scale, as that of Prussia, would\r\noccasion this court to prefer conciliation to war. Add to this, the\r\ndistress of their finances, and perhaps not so warm a zeal in the new\r\nministry for the innovations in Holland. I hardly believe they will\r\nthink it worth while to purchase the change of constitution proposed\r\nthere, at the expense of a war. But of these things, you will receive\r\nmore particular and more certain details from Mr. Dumas, to whom they\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nMr. Eden is appointed ambassador from England to Madrid. To the hatred\r\nborne us by his court and country, is added a recollection of the\r\ncircumstances of the unsuccessful embassy to America, of which he made a\r\npart. So that I think he will carry to Madrid, dispositions to do us all\r\nthe ill he can.\r\n\r\nThe late change in the ministry is very favorable to the prospects\r\nof the Chevalier de la Luzerne. The Count de Montmorin, Monsieur de\r\nMalesherbes, and Monsieur de Lamoignon, the _Garde des Sceaux_, are his\r\nnear relations. Probably something will be done for him, and without\r\ndelay. The promise of the former administration to the Count de Moutier,\r\nto succeed to this vacancy, should it take place, will perhaps be\r\nperformed by the present one.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay has probably informed you of his having been arrested\r\nin Bordeaux, for a debt contracted in the way of his commerce. He\r\nimmediately applied to the parliament of that place, who ordered his\r\ndischarge. This took place after five days’ actual imprisonment. I\r\narrived at Bordeaux a few days after his liberation. As the Procureur\r\nGeneral of the King had interested himself to obtain it, with uncommon\r\nzeal, and that too on public principles, I thought it my duty to wait\r\non him and return him my thanks. I did the same to the President of the\r\nparliament, for the body over which he presided; what would have been an\r\ninsult in America, being an indispensable duty here. You will see by the\r\nenclosed printed paper, on what grounds the Procureur insisted on Mr.\r\nBarclay’s liberation. Those on which the parliament ordered it, are not\r\nexpressed. On my arrival here, I spoke with the minister on the subject.\r\nHe observed, that the character of Consul is no protection in this\r\ncountry, against process for debt: that as to the character with\r\nwhich Mr. Barclay had been invested at the court of Morocco, it was\r\nquestionable whether it would be placed on the diplomatic line, as it\r\nhad not been derived immediately from Congress; that if it were,\r\nit would have covered him to Paris only, where he had received his\r\ncommission, had he proceeded directly thither, but that his long stay at\r\nBordeaux, must be considered as terminating it there. I observed to him,\r\nthat Mr. Barclay had been arrested almost immediately on his arrival at\r\nBordeaux. But, says he, the arrest was made void by the parliament, and\r\nstill he has continued there several weeks. True, I replied, but his\r\nadversaries declared they would arrest him again, the moment he should\r\nbe out of the jurisdiction of the parliament of Bordeaux, and have\r\nactually engaged the _Maréchausée_ on the road, to do it. This seemed\r\nto impress him. He said he could obtain a letter of safe conduct which\r\nwould protect him to Paris, but that immediately on his arrival here,\r\nhe would be liable to arrest. I asked him, if such a letter could not\r\nbe obtained to protect him to Paris, and back to Bordeaux, and even to\r\nAmerica? He said, that for that, the consent of the greater part of his\r\ncreditors would be necessary; and even with this, it was very doubtful\r\nwhether it could be obtained: still, if I would furnish him with that\r\nconsent, he would do what should depend on him. I am persuaded he will,\r\nand have written to Mr. Barclay to obtain the consent of his creditors.\r\nThis is the footing on which this matter stands at present. I have\r\nstated it thus particularly, that you may know the truth, which will\r\nprobably be misrepresented in the English papers, to the prejudice\r\nof Mr. Barclay. This matter has been a great affliction to him, but no\r\ndishonor where its true state is known. Indeed he is incapable of doing\r\nany thing not strictly honorable.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of August the 30th, 1785, I had the honor of mentioning\r\nto you what had passed here, on the subject of a convention for the\r\nregulation of the two post offices. I now inclose you a letter from the\r\nBaron D’Ogny, who is at the head of that department, which shows that\r\nhe still expects some arrangement. I have heard it said, that M. de\r\nCreve-coeur is authorized to treat on this subject. You doubtless know\r\nif this be true. The articles may certainly be better adjusted there,\r\nthan here. This letter from the Baron D’Ogny was in consequence of an\r\napplication from a servant of mine, during my absence, which would not\r\nhave been made had I been here. Nor will it be repeated; it being my\r\nopinion and practice to pay small sums of money, rather than to ask\r\nfavors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to inclose you also, copies of a letter and papers\r\nfrom the Marechal de Castries, on the claim of an individual against the\r\nState of South Carolina, for services performed on board the Indian;\r\nand the petition of another, on a like claim: also copies of letters\r\nreceived from O’Bryan at Algiers, and from Mr. Lambe. A letter of the\r\n26th of May, from Mr. Montgomery, at Alicant, informs me, that by a\r\nvessel arrived at Carthagena from Algiers, they learn the death of the\r\nDey of that republic. Yet, as we hear nothing of it through any other\r\nchannel, it may be doubted. It escaped me at the time of my departure to\r\nAix, to make arrangements for sending you the gazettes regularly, by the\r\npackets. The whole are now sent, though a great part of them are so old\r\nas to be not worth perusal. Your favor of April the 24th, has been duly\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nI have the honor,to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect. Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXII.--TO MADAME DE CORNY, June 30,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\nParis, June 30,1787.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Paris, it was among my first attentions to go to the rue\r\nChaussée d’Antin, No. 17, and inquire after my friends whom I had left\r\nthere. I was told they were in England. And how do you like England,\r\nMadam? I know your taste for the works of art gives you little\r\ndisposition to Anglomania. Their mechanics certainly exceed all others\r\nin some lines. But be just to your own nation. They have not patience,\r\nit is true, to set rubbing a piece of steel from morning to night, as a\r\nlethargic Englishman will do, full charged with porter. But do not their\r\nbenevolence, their cheerfulness, their amiability, when compared with\r\nthe growling temper and manners of the people among whom you are,\r\ncompensate their want of patience? I am in hopes that when the splendor\r\nof their shops, which is all that is worth seeing in London, shall\r\nhave lost the charm of novelty, you will turn a wishful eye to the good\r\npeople of Paris, and find that you cannot be so happy with any others.\r\nThe Bois de Boulogne invites you earnestly to come and survey its\r\nbeautiful verdure, to retire to its umbrage from the heats of the\r\nseason. I was through it to-day, as I am every day. Every tree charged\r\nme with this invitation to you. Passing by la Muette, it wished for you\r\nas a mistress. You want a country-house. This is for sale; and in the\r\nBois de Boulogne, which I have always insisted to be most worthy of\r\nyour preference. Come then, and buy it. If I had had confidence in your\r\nspeedy return, I should have embarrassed you in earnest with my little\r\ndaughter. But an impatience to have her with me, after her separation\r\nfrom her friends, added to a respect for your ease, has induced me to\r\nsend a servant for her.\r\n\r\nI tell you no news, because you have correspondents infinitely more _au\r\nfait_ of the details at Paris than I am. And I offer you no services,\r\nbecause I hope you will come as soon as the letter could, which should\r\ncommand them. Be assured, however, that nobody is more disposed to\r\nrender them, nor entertains for you a more sincere and respectful\r\nattachment, than him, who, after charging you with his compliments to\r\nMonsieur de Corny, has the honor of offering you the homage of those\r\nsentiments of distinguished esteem and regard, with which he is, Dear\r\nMadam, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 1, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, July 1, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI returned about three weeks ago from a very useless voyage; useless,\r\nI mean, as to the object which first suggested it, that of trying the\r\neffect of the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence, on my hand. I\r\ntried these, because recommended among six or eight others as equally\r\nbeneficial, and because they would place me at the beginning of a tour\r\nto the seaports of Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, and L’Orient, which I\r\nhad long meditated, in hopes that a knowledge of the places and persons\r\nconcerned in our commerce, and the information to be got from them,\r\nmight enable me sometimes to be useful. I had expected to satisfy myself\r\nat Marseilles, of the causes of the difference of quality between the\r\nrice of Carolina, and that of Piedmont, which is brought in quantities\r\nto Marseilles. Not being able to do it, I made an excursion of three\r\nweeks into the rice country beyond the Alps, going through it from\r\nVercelli to Pavia, about sixty miles. I found the difference to be, not\r\nin the management, as had been supposed both here and in Carolina, but\r\nin the species of rice; and I hope to enable them in Carolina, to begin\r\nthe cultivation of the Piedmont rice, and carry it on, hand in hand,\r\nwith their own, that they may supply both qualities which is absolutely\r\nnecessary at this market. I had before endeavored to lead the depot of\r\nrice from Cowes to Honfleur, and hope to get it received there on such\r\nterms, as may draw that branch of commerce from England to this country.\r\nIt is an object of two hundred and fifty thousand guineas a year. While\r\npassing through the towns of Turin, Milan, and Genoa, I satisfied\r\nmyself of the practicability of introducing our whale-oil for their\r\nconsumption, and suppose it would be equally so in the other great\r\ncities of that country. I was sorry that I was not authorized to set the\r\nmatter on foot. The merchants with whom I chose to ask conferences met\r\nme freely, and communicated fully, knowing I was in a public character.\r\nI could, however, only prepare a disposition to meet our oil-merchants.\r\nOn the article of tobacco, I was more in possession of my ground; and\r\nput matters into a train for inducing their government to draw their\r\ntobaccos directly from the United States, and not, as heretofore, from\r\nGreat Britain. I am now occupied with the new ministry here, to put\r\nthe concluding hand to the new regulations for our commerce with this\r\ncountry, announced in the letter of Monsieur de Calonne, which I\r\nsent you last fall. I am in hopes, in addition to those, to obtain\r\na suppression of the duties on tar, pitch, and turpentine, and, an\r\nextension of the privileges of American _whale oil_, to their _fish\r\noils_ in general. I find that the quantity of cod-fish oil brought to\r\nL’Orient is considerable. This being got off hand (which will be in a\r\nfew days), the chicaneries and vexations of the Farmers on the article\r\nof tobacco, and their elusions of the order of Bernis, call for the next\r\nattention. I have reasons to hope good dispositions in the new ministry\r\ntowards our commerce with this country. Besides endeavoring, on all\r\noccasions, to multiply the points of contact and connection with this\r\ncountry, which I consider as our surest mainstay under every event, I\r\nhave had it much at heart to remove from between us every subject of\r\nmisunderstanding or irritation. Our debts to the King, to the Officers,\r\nand the Farmers, are of this description. The having complied with no\r\npart of our engagements in these, draws on us a great deal of censure,\r\nand occasioned a language in the _Assemblée des Notables_, very likely\r\nto produce dissatisfaction between us. Dumas being on the spot in\r\nHolland, I had asked of him some time ago, in confidence, his opinion of\r\nthe practicability of transferring these debts from France to Holland,\r\nand communicated his answer to Congress, pressing them to get you to go\r\nover to Holland, and try to effect this business. Your knowledge of the\r\nground, and former successes, occasioned me to take this liberty without\r\nconsulting you, because I was sure you would not weigh your personal\r\ntrouble against public good. I have had no answer from Congress; but\r\nhearing of your journey to Holland, have hoped that some money operation\r\nhad led you there. If it related to the debts of this country, I\r\nwould ask a communication of what you think yourself at liberty to\r\ncommunicate, as it might change the form of my answers to the eternal\r\napplications I receive. The debt to the officers of France, carries an\r\ninterest of about two thousand guineas, so we may suppose its principal\r\nis between thirty and forty thousand. This makes more noise against us,\r\nthan all our other debts put together.\r\n\r\nI send you the _Arrêts_ which begin the reformation here, and some\r\nother publications respecting America; together with copies of letters\r\nreceived from O’Bryan and Lambe. It is believed, that a naval armament\r\nhas been ordered at Brest, in correspondence with that of England.\r\nWe know, certainly, that orders are given to form a camp in the\r\nneighborhood of Brabant, and that Count Rochambeau has the command of\r\nit. Its amount I cannot assert. Report says fifteen thousand men. This\r\nwill derange the plans of economy. I take the liberty of putting under\r\nyour cover a letter for Mrs. Kinloch, of South Carolina, with a packet,\r\nand will trouble you to inquire for her, and have them delivered. The\r\npacket is of great consequence, and therefore referred to her care, as\r\nshe will know the safe opportunities of conveying it. Should you not be\r\nable to find her, and can forward the packet to its address, by any very\r\nsafe conveyance, I will beg you to do it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect friendship\r\nand esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIV.--TO DAVID HARTLEY, July 2,1787\r\n\r\nTO DAVID HARTLEY.\r\n\r\nParis, July 2,1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received lately your favor of April the 23d, on my return from a\r\njourney of three or four months; and am always happy in an occasion of\r\nrecalling myself to your memory. The most interesting intelligence from\r\nAmerica, is that respecting the late insurrection in Massachusetts. The\r\ncause of this has not been developed to me to my perfect satisfaction.\r\nThe most probable is, that those individuals were of the imprudent\r\nnumber of those who have involved themselves in debt beyond their\r\nabilities to pay, and that a vigorous effort in that government to\r\ncompel the payment of private debts, and raise money for public ones,\r\nproduced the resistance. I believe you may be assured, than an idea or\r\ndesire of returning to any thing like their ancient government, never\r\nentered into their heads. I am not discouraged by this. For thus I\r\ncalculate. An insurrection in one of thirteen States, in the course of\r\neleven years that they have subsisted, amounts to one in any particular\r\nstate, in one hundred and forty-three years, say a century and a\r\nhalf. This would not be near as many as have happened in every other\r\ngovernment that has ever existed. So that we shall have the difference\r\nbetween a light and a heavy government as clear gain. I have no fear,\r\nbut that the result of our experiment will be, that men may be trusted\r\nto govern themselves without a master. Could the contrary of this be\r\nproved, I should conclude, either that there is no God, or that he is a\r\nmalevolent being. You have heard of the federal convention, now sitting\r\nat Philadelphia, for the amendment of the Confederation. Eleven States\r\nappointed delegates certainly; it was expected that Connecticut would\r\nalso appoint, the moment its Assembly met. Rhode Island had refused. I\r\nexpect they will propose several amendments; that that relative to our\r\ncommerce will probably be adopted immediately, but that the others must\r\nwait to be adopted, one after another, in proportion as the minds of the\r\nStates ripen for them. Dr. Franklin enjoys good health. I shall always\r\nbe happy to hear from you, being, with sentiments of very sincere esteem\r\nand respect, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXV.--TO B. VAUGHAN, July 2, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO B. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nParis, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of February the 16th came to my hands in the moment I was\r\nsetting out on a tour through the southern parts of France and northern\r\nof Italy, from which I am but just now returned. I avail myself of the\r\nearliest moment to acknowledge its receipt, and to thank you for the box\r\nof magnets which I found here. Though I do not know certainly by or from\r\nwhom they come, I presume they came by Colonel Smith, who was here in my\r\nabsence, and from Messrs. Nairne and Blunt, through your good offices. I\r\nthink your letter of February the 16th flatters me with the expectation\r\nof another, with observations on the hygrometers I had proposed. I value\r\nwhat comes from you too much, not to remind you of it. Your favor by Mr.\r\nGarnett also came during my absence. I presume he has left Paris, as\r\nI can hear nothing of him. I have lost the opportunity, therefore,\r\nof seeing his method of resisting friction, as well as of showing, by\r\nattentions to him, respect for yourself and your recommendations. Mr.\r\nPaine (Common Sense) is here on his way to England. He has brought the\r\nmodel of an iron bridge, with which he supposes a single arch of four\r\nhundred feet may be made. It has not yet arrived in Paris. Among other\r\nprojects, with which we begin to abound in America, is one for finding\r\nthe longitude by the variation of the magnetic needle. The author\r\nsupposes two points, one near each pole, through the northern of which\r\npass all the magnetic meridians of the northern hemisphere, and through\r\nthe southern those of the southern hemisphere. He determines their\r\npresent position and periodical revolution. It is said his publication\r\nis plausible. I have not seen it.\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do with your naval armament on your side the\r\nchannel. Perhaps you will ask me, what they are about to do here. A\r\nBritish navy and Prussian army hanging over Holland on one side, a\r\nFrench navy and army hanging over it on the other, looks as if they\r\nthought of fighting. Yet I think both parties too wise for that, too\r\nlaudably intent on economizing, rather than on further embarrassing\r\ntheir finances. May they not propose to have a force on the spot to\r\nestablish some neutral form of a constitution, which these powers will\r\ncook up among themselves, without consulting the parties for whom it\r\nis intended? The affair of Geneva shows such combinations possible.\r\nWretched, indeed, is the nation, in whose affairs foreign powers are\r\nonce permitted to intermeddle. Lord Wycombe is with us at present. His\r\ngood sense, information, and discretion are much beyond his years, and\r\npromise good things for your country.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of the esteem/and respect, with which\r\nI have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVI.--TO M. L’ABBE MORELLET, July 2, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. L’ABBE MORELLET.\r\n\r\nParis, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, my Dear Sir, that your interest should be affected by the\r\nill behavior of Barrois. But when you consider the facts, you will be\r\nsensible that I could not have indulged his indolence further, without\r\nincreasing the injury to a more punctual workman. Stockdale, of London,\r\nhad asked leave to print my Notes. I agreed to it; and promised he\r\nshould have the plate of the map as soon as it should be corrected,\r\nand the copies struck off for you and myself. He thereupon printed his\r\nedition completely in three weeks. The printer, who was to strike off\r\ntwo hundred and fifty maps for me, kept the plate but five days. It was\r\nthen delivered to Barrois, with notice that it could not be left\r\nlonger with him, than should suffice to strike off his number. Repeated\r\napplications for it, by Mr. Short and my servant, were only answered\r\nby repeated promises, and times of delivery fixed, no one of which was\r\nperformed. When I returned, he had been possessed of the plate upwards\r\nof two months. I was astonished and confounded, to be told it had not\r\nbeen sent to Stockdale, and that his edition had been lying dead on his\r\nhands three months. I sent to Barrois the very day of my return, to let\r\nhim know, that justice to Stockdale did not permit me to defer sending\r\nhim the plate any longer: yet I would wait five days, at the end of\r\nwhich he must deliver me the plate, whether his maps were done or not. I\r\nreceived no answer, but waited ten days. I then sent for the plate. The\r\nanswer was, he was not at home. I sent again the next day. Answer, he\r\nwas not at home. I sent the third day. Not at home. I then ordered the\r\nmessenger to go back, and wait till he should come home. This produced\r\nan answer of two lines, _qu’il alloit soigner son ouvrier?_ I wrote him\r\nword in return, to deliver the plate instantly. This I think was on a\r\nSaturday or Sunday. He told the messenger he would let me have it the\r\nThursday following. I took patience, and sent on the Friday, but telling\r\nthe messenger, if he refused to deliver it, to inform him I would be\r\nplagued no more with sending messages, but apply to the police. He then\r\ndelivered it, and I sent it off immediately to London. He had kept it\r\nthree months, of which three weeks were after my return. I think, Sir,\r\nyou will be satisfied that justice to Stockdale, justice to myself,\r\nwho had passed my word for sending on the plate, and sensibility to the\r\nshuffling conduct of Barrois, permitted me to act no otherwise. But no\r\nmatter. Let his ill behavior make no odds between you and me. It will\r\naffect your interest, and that suffices to determine me to order back\r\nthe plate, as soon as Stockdale has done with it. He will not require\r\nmore days, than Barrois months. So that it will be here before you can\r\nwant it. But it must never go into Barrois’ hands again, nor of any\r\nperson depending on him, or under his orders. The workman who struck off\r\nthe two hundred and fifty for me, seems to have been diligent enough.\r\nEither he, or any other workman you please of that description, shall\r\nhave it, to strike what number you wish. I forgot to observe, in its\r\nproper place, that when I was in the midst of my difficulties, I did\r\nmyself the honor of calling on you, as well to have that of asking after\r\nyour health on my return, as of asking your assistance to obtain the\r\nplate. Unluckily you were gone to Versailles; so I was obliged to\r\nproceed as well as I could. It is no excuse for Barrois, to say, he\r\ncould not get his _imprimeur_ to proceed. He should have applied to\r\nanother. But as to you, it shall be set to rights in the manner I\r\nhave before stated. Accept my regret that you were in the hands of so\r\nunderserving a workman, and one who placed me under the necessity of\r\ninterrupting a work which interested you. Be assured, at the same time,\r\nof the sincerity of those sentiments of esteem and respect with which\r\nI have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE LETTER OF MONSIEUR DE CALONNE\r\n\r\n     [The following observations appear to have been addressed to\r\n     the Count de Montmorin, about the 6th of July, 1787.]\r\n\r\nObservations on the Letter of Monsieur de Calonne to Monsieur Jefferson,\r\ndated, Fontainbleau, October 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed, in the course of the last year, to take a\r\nview of the subjects of commerce which might be brought from the United\r\nStates of America, in exchange for those of France, and to consider what\r\nadvantages and facilities might be offered to encourage that commerce.\r\nThe letter of Monsieur de Calonne was founded on their report. It was\r\nconclusive as to the articles on which satisfactory information had been\r\nthen obtained, and reserved, for future consideration, certain others,\r\nneeding further inquiry. It is proposed now to review those unfinished\r\narticles, that they may also be comprehended in the _Arrêt_, and the\r\nregulations on this branch of commerce be rendered complete.\r\n\r\n1. The letter promised to diminish the _Droits du Roi et d’amirautè_,\r\npayable by an American vessel entering into a port at France, and to\r\nreduce what should remain into a single duty, which shall be regulated\r\nby the draught of the vessel, or her number of masts. It is doubted\r\nwhether it will be expedient to regulate the duty, in either of these\r\nways. If by the draught,of water, it will fall unequally on us as a\r\nnation; because we build our vessels sharp-bottomed, for swift sailing,\r\nso that they draw more water than those of other nations, of the\r\nsame burthen. If by the number of masts, it will fall unequally on\r\nindividuals; because we often see ships of one hundred and eighty tons,\r\nand brigs of three hundred and sixty. This, then, would produce an\r\ninequality among individuals, of six to one. The present principle is\r\nthe most just, to regulate by the burthen. It is certainly desirable,\r\nthat these duties should be reduced to a single one. Their names and\r\nnumbers perplex and harass the merchant, more than their amount; subject\r\nhim to imposition, and to the suspicion of it when there is none. An\r\nintention of general reformation in this article has been accordingly\r\nannounced, with augmentation as to foreigners. We are in hopes, that\r\nthis augmentation is not to respect us; because it is proposed as a\r\nmeasure of reciprocity, whereas, in some of our States, no such duties\r\nexist, and in others they are extremely light; because we have been\r\nmade to hope a diminution, instead of augmentation; and because this\r\ndistinction cannot draw on France any just claims from other nations;\r\nthe _jura gentis amicissima_, conferred by her late treaties, having\r\nreference expressly to the nations of Europe only; and those\r\nconferred by the more ancient ones not being susceptible of any other\r\ninterpretation, nor admitting a pretension of reference to a nation\r\nwhich did not then exist, and which has come into existence under\r\ncircumstances distinguishing its commerce from that of all other\r\nnations. Merchandise received from them, takes employment from the\r\npoor of France; ours gives it: theirs is brought in, the last stage of\r\nmanufacture; ours in the first: we bring our tobaccos to be manufactured\r\ninto snuff, our flax and hemp into linen and cordage, our furs into\r\nhats, skins into saddlery, shoes, and clothing; we take nothing till it\r\nhas received the last hand.\r\n\r\n2. Fish-oils. The Hanseatic treaty was the basis, on which the\r\ndiminution of duty on this article was asked and granted. It is\r\nexpressly referred to as such, in the letter of Monsieur de Calonne.\r\nInstead, however, of the expression, _huile et graisse de baleine et\r\nd’autres poisons_, used in that treaty, the letter uses the terms,\r\n‘_huiles de baleine, spermaceti, et tout ce qui est compris sous\r\nces denominations._’ And the Farmers have availed themselves of this\r\nvariation, to refuse the diminution of duty on the oils of the _vache\r\nmarine, chien de mer, esturgeon_, and other fish. It is proposed,\r\ntherefore, to re-establish in the _Arrêt_, the expression of the\r\nHanseatic treaty, and to add, from the same treaty, the articles\r\n‘_baleine coupée et fanon de baleine_.’\r\n\r\nThe letter states these regulations as finally made by the King. The\r\nmerchants, on this supposition, entered into speculations. But they\r\nfound themselves called on for the old duties, not only on other\r\nfish-oils, but on the whale-oil. Monsieur de Calonne always promised,\r\nthat the _Arrêt_ should be retrospective to the date of the letter, so\r\nas to refund to them the duties they had thus been obliged to pay. To\r\nthis, attention is prayed in forming the _Arrêt_. His majesty having\r\nbeen pleased, as an encouragement to the importation of our fish-oils,\r\nto abolish the _Droits de fabrication_, it is presumed that the purpose\r\nannounced, of continuing those duties on foreign oils, will not be\r\nextended to us.\r\n\r\n3. Rice. The duty on this, is only seven and a half deniers the quintal,\r\nor about one quarter per cent, on its first cost. While this serves to\r\ninform a government of the quantities imported, it cannot discourage\r\nthat importation. Nothing further, therefore, is necessary on this\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n4. _Potasse_. This article is of principal utility to France, in her\r\nbleacheries of linen, glass-works, and soap-works; and the potash of\r\nAmerica, being made of green wood, is known to be the best in the world.\r\nAll duty on it was, therefore, abolished by the King. But the city of\r\nRouen levies on it a duty of twenty sols the quintal, which is very\r\nsensible in its price, brings it dearer to the bleacheries near Paris,\r\nto those of Beauvais, Laval, &c. and to the glass-works, and encourages\r\nthem to give a preference to the potash or soude of other nations. This\r\nis a counteraction of the views of the King, expressed in the letter,\r\nwhich it is hoped will be prevented.\r\n\r\n5. Turpentine, tar, and pitch were not decided on, on the former\r\noccasion. Turpentine (_térébenthine_) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten\r\nsols the livre, making fifteen sols the quintal; which is ten per cent,\r\non its prime cost. Tar (_goudron, braigras_) pays eight livres the\r\n_leth_ of twelve barrels, and ten sols the livre, amounting to twenty\r\nsols the barrel; which is twelve and a half per cent, on its prime cost.\r\nPitch (_brai sec_) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten sols the livre,\r\nmaking fifteen sols the quintal; which is twenty per cent, on its prime\r\ncost. Duties of from ten to twenty per cent., on articles of heavy\r\ncarriage, prevent their importation. They eat up all the profits of the\r\nmerchant, and often subject him to loss. This has been much the case\r\nwith respect to turpentine, tar, and pitch, which are principal articles\r\nof remittance for the State of North Carolina. It is hoped, that it\r\nwill coincide with the views of government, in making the present\r\nregulations, to suppress the duties on these articles, which, of all\r\nothers, can bear them least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVII.--TO T. M. RANDOLPH, JUNIOR, July 6, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. M. RANDOLPH, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nParis, July 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of April the 14th came here during my absence on a journey\r\nthrough the southern parts of France and northern of Italy, from which I\r\nam but lately returned. This cause alone, has prevented your receiving\r\na more early answer to it. I am glad to find, that among the various\r\nbranches of science presenting themselves to your mind, you have fixed\r\non that of politics as your principal pursuit. Your country will derive\r\nfrom this a more immediate and sensible benefit. She has much for you\r\nto do. For though we may say with confidence, that the worst of the\r\nAmerican constitutions, is better than the best which ever existed\r\nbefore, in any other country, and that they are wonderfully perfect for\r\na first essay, yet every human essay must have defects. It will remain,\r\ntherefore, to those now coming on the stage of public affairs, to\r\nperfect what has been so well begun by those, going off it. Mathematics,\r\nNatural Philosophy, Natural History, Anatomy, Chemistry, Botany, will\r\nbecome amusements for your hours of relaxation, and auxiliaries to your\r\nprincipal studies. Precious and delightful ones they will be. As soon\r\nas such a foundation is laid in them, as you may build on as you please,\r\nhereafter, I suppose you will proceed to your main objects, Politics,\r\nLaw, Rhetoric, and History. As to these, the place where you study them\r\nis absolutely indifferent. I should except Rhetoric, a very essential\r\nmember of them, and which I suppose must be taught to advantage where\r\nyou are. You would do well, therefore, to attend the public exercises\r\nin this branch also, and to do it with very particular diligence.\r\nThis being done, the question arises, where you shall fix yourself for\r\nstudying Politics, Law, and History. I should not hesitate to decide\r\nin favor of France, because you will, at the same time, be learning to\r\nspeak the language of that country, become absolutely essential under\r\nour present circumstances. The best method of doing this, would be\r\nto fix yourself in some family where there are women and children, in\r\nPassy, Auteuil, or some other of the little towns in reach of Paris. The\r\nprincipal hours of the day you will attend to your studies, and in those\r\nof relaxation associate with the family. You will learn to speak better\r\nfrom women and children in three months, than from men in a year. Such a\r\nsituation, too, will render more easy a due attention to economy of time\r\nand money. Having pursued your main studies here about two years, and\r\nacquired a facility in speaking French, take a tour of four or five\r\nmonths through this country and Italy, return then to Virginia, and pass\r\na year in Williamsburg, under the care of Mr. Wythe; and you will be\r\nready to enter on the public stage, with superior advantages. I have\r\nproposed to you to carry on the study of the law, with that of politics\r\nand history. Every political measure will, for ever, have an intimate\r\nconnection with the laws of the land; and he who knows nothing of these,\r\nwill always be perplexed, and often foiled by adversaries having\r\nthe advantage of that knowledge over him. Besides, it is a source of\r\ninfinite comfort to reflect, that under every change of fortune, we\r\nhave a resource in ourselves, from which we may be able to derive an\r\nhonorable subsistence. I would, therefore, propose not only the study,\r\nbut the practice of the law for some time, to possess yourself of the\r\nhabit of public speaking. With respect to modern languages, French, as\r\nI have before observed, is indispensable. Next to this, the Spanish\r\nis most important to an American. Our connection with Spain is already\r\nimportant, and will become daily more so. Besides this, the ancient part\r\nof American history is written chiefly in Spanish. To a person who would\r\nmake a point of reading and speaking French and Spanish, I should\r\ndoubt the utility of learning Italian. These three languages, being all\r\ndegeneracies from the Latin, resemble one another so much, that I doubt\r\nthe probability of keeping in the head a distinct knowledge of them\r\nall. I suppose that he who learns them all, will speak a compound of the\r\nthree, and neither perfectly. The journey which I propose to you,\r\nneed not be expensive, and would be very useful. With your talents\r\nand industry, with science, and that steadfast honesty which eternally\r\npursues right, regardless of consequences, you may promise yourself\r\nevery thing--but health, without which there is no happiness. An\r\nattention to health, then, should take place of every other object. The\r\ntime necessary to secure this by active exercises, should be devoted\r\nto it, in preference to every other pursuit. I know the difficulty with\r\nwhich a studious man tears himself from his studies, at any given moment\r\nof the day. But his happiness, and that of his family, depend on it.\r\nThe most uninformed mind with a healthy body, is happier than the wisest\r\nvaletudinarian. I need not tell you, that if I can be useful to you in\r\nany part of this, or any other plan you shall adopt, you will make me\r\nhappy by commanding my services.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good, Sir, as to return my most respectful thanks for the\r\ndiploma with which I am honored by the society instituted with you, for\r\nthe encouragement of the study of Natural History. I am afraid it\r\nwill never be in my power to contribute any thing to the object of the\r\ninstitution. Circumstances have thrown me into a very different line of\r\nlife; and not choice, as I am happy to find in your case. In the year\r\n1781, while confined to my room by a fall from my horse, I wrote some\r\nNotes, in answer to the inquiries of M. de Marbois, as to the natural\r\nand political state of Virginia. They were hasty and undigested: yet as\r\nsome of these touch slightly on some objects of its natural history, I\r\nwill take the liberty of asking the society to accept a copy of them.\r\nFor the same reason, and because too, they touch on the political\r\ncondition of our country, I will beg leave to present you with a copy,\r\nand ask the favor of you to find a conveyance for them, from London to\r\nEdinburgh. They are printed by Stockdale, bookseller, Piccadilly, and\r\nwill be ready in three or four weeks from this time. I will direct him\r\nto deliver two copies to your order. Repeating, constantly, the\r\nproffer of my services, I shall only add assurances of the esteem and\r\nattachment, with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVIII.--TO STEPHEN CATHALAN, JUNIOR, July 21,1787\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN CATHALAN, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nParis, July 21,1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received your favor of May the 9th, just as I was stepping into the\r\nbarge on my departure from Cette; which prevented my answering it from\r\nthat place. On my arrival here, I thought I would avail myself of the\r\nopportunity of paying your balance, to make a little acquaintance with\r\nSir John Lambert. One or two unsuccessful attempts to find him at home,\r\nwith the intermediate procrastinations well known to men of business,\r\nprevented my seeing him till yesterday, and have led me on to this\r\nmoment, through a perpetual remorse of conscience for not writing\r\nto you, and in the constant belief that it would be to morrow and to\r\nmorrow. At length, I have seen him, paid him the eighty-five livres\r\nwhich you have been so kind as to advance for me, and am actually at my\r\nwriting table, returning you thanks for this kindness, and to yourself\r\nand the family for the thousand others I received at their hands,\r\nat Marseilles. My journey, after leaving you, wanted nothing but\r\nthe company of Madame Cathalan and yourself, to render it perfectly\r\nagreeable. I felt the want of it peculiarly on the _canal de Languedoc_,\r\nwhere, with society, the mode of travelling would have been charming. I\r\nwas much indebted to M. Minaudier, for a good equipment from Agde, and\r\nunceasing attentions to that place; for which I was indebted to your\r\nrecommendations as well as to his goodness.\r\n\r\nI am honored with your father’s letters of June the 30th; and as he does\r\nnot read English, and I cannot write French, I must beg leave to answer\r\nhim through you. I thank him for his hints on the subject of tobacco.\r\nI am now pressing for arrangements as to that article, to take place on\r\nthe expiration of Mr. Morris’s contract, and the order of Bernis.\r\nWhat form this business will take, or what will be the nature of the\r\narrangements, or whether there will be any, I am as yet unable to say. I\r\nwill take care to inform you the moment there is a decision.\r\n\r\nThe public business with which Mr. Barclay has been charged rendering\r\nit necessary for him to repair to Congress, and the interest of his\r\ncreditors, his family, and himself requiring his return to America, he\r\nhas departed for that country. I know nothing of Mr. Barclay’s affairs\r\nin this country. He has good possessions in America, which, he assured\r\nme, were much more than sufficient to satisfy all the demands against\r\nhim. He went, determined to convert those immediately into money, and to\r\ncollect the debts due to him there, that he might be enabled to pay his\r\ndebts. My opinion of his integrity is such, as to leave no doubt in my\r\nmind, that he will do every thing in his power to render justice to his\r\ncreditors; and I know so well his attachment to M. Cathalan, as to be\r\nsatisfied, that if he makes any difference among his creditors, he will\r\nbe among the most favored. Mr. Barclay is an honest and honorable man,\r\nand is more goaded towards the payment of his debts by his own feelings,\r\nthan by all the processes of law, which could be set on foot against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNo arrangements having ever been made as yet, for cases like that of\r\nthe carpenter of the American ship Sally, I am unable to answer on that\r\nsubject. I am in hopes, his money will last till he recovers his senses,\r\nor till we can receive instructions what to do in that and similar\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nM. Cathalan wishes a copy of my Notes on Virginia. If you will be so\r\ngood as to advise me by what channel they will go safely, I will do\r\nmyself the honor of sending a copy, either of the original or of the\r\ntranslation. Present me affectionately to Mrs. Cathalan, the mother and\r\ndaughter; tell the latter I feed on the hopes of seeing her one day at\r\nParis. My friendly respects wait also on your father; and on yourself,\r\nassurances of the esteem and consideration with which I have the honor\r\nto be, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIX.--TO THE DELEGATES OF RHODE ISLAND, July 22,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DELEGATES OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nParis, July 22,1787.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI was honored, in the month of January last, with a letter from the\r\nhonorable the Delegates of Rhode Island in Congress, enclosing a letter\r\nfrom the corporation of Rhode Island College to his Most Christian\r\nMajesty, and some other papers. I was then in the hurry of a preparation\r\nfor a journey into the south of France, and therefore unable, at that\r\nmoment, to make the inquiries which the object of the letter rendered\r\nnecessary. As soon as I returned, which was in the last month, I\r\nturned my attention to that object, which was the establishment of a\r\nprofessorship of the French language in the College, and the obtaining\r\na collection of the best French authors, with the aid of the King.\r\nThat neither the College nor myself might be compromitted uselessly, I\r\nthought it necessary to sound, previously, those who were able to inform\r\nme what would be the success of the application. I was assured, so as to\r\nleave no doubt, that it would not be complied with; that there had\r\nnever been an instance of the King’s granting such a demand in a foreign\r\ncountry, and that they would be cautious of setting the precedent: that\r\nin this moment, too, they were embarrassed with the difficult operation\r\nof putting down all establishments of their own, which could possibly be\r\ndispensed with, in order to bring their expenditures down to the level\r\nof their receipts. Upon such information I was satisfied, that it was\r\nmost prudent not to deliver the letter, and spare to both parties the\r\ndisagreeableness of giving and receiving a denial. The King did give\r\nto two colleges in America copies of the works printing in the public\r\npress. But were this to be obtained for the College of Rhode Island,\r\nit would extend only to a volume or two of Buffon’s works, still to\r\nbe printed, Manilius’s Astronomicon, and one or two other works in the\r\npress, which are of no consequence. I did not think this an object for\r\nthe College worth being pressed. I beg the favor of you, gentlemen,\r\nto assure the corporation, that no endeavors of mine should have been\r\nspared, could they have effected their wish: and that they have been\r\nfaithfully used in making the preliminary inquiries which are necessary,\r\nand which ended in an assurance, that nothing could be done. These\r\npapers having been transmitted to me through your delegation, will,\r\nI hope, be an apology for my availing myself of the same channel for\r\ncommunicating the result.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXX.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, July 23, 1787\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nParis, July 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor, a few days ago, of putting into the hands of your\r\nExcellency, some observations on the other articles of American produce,\r\nbrought into the ports of this country. That of our tobaccos, from the\r\nparticular form of their administration here, and their importance to\r\nthe King’s revenues, has been placed on a separate line, and considered\r\nseparately. I will now ask permission to bring that subject under your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe mutual extension of their commerce was among the fairest advantages\r\nto be derived to France and the United States, from the independence of\r\nthe latter. An exportation of eighty millions, chiefly in raw materials,\r\nis supposed to constitute the present limits of the commerce of the\r\nUnited States with the nations of Europe; limits, however, which extend\r\nas their population increases. To draw the best proportion of this into\r\nthe ports of France, rather than of any other nation, is believed to\r\nbe the wish and interest of both. Of these eighty millions, thirty are\r\nconstituted by the single article of tobacco. Could the whole of this\r\nbe brought into the ports of France, to satisfy its own demands, and the\r\nresidue to be re-vended to other nations, it would be a powerful link\r\nof commercial connection. But we are far from this. Even her own\r\nconsumption, supposed to be nine millions, under the administration\r\nof the monopoly to which it is farmed, enters little, as an article of\r\nexchange, into the commerce of the two nations. When this article was\r\nfirst put into Farm, perhaps it did not injure the commercial interests\r\nof the kingdom; because nothing but British manufactures were then\r\nallowed to be given in return for American tobaccos. The laying the\r\ntrade open, then, to all the subjects of France, could not have relieved\r\nher from a payment in money. Circumstances are changed; yet the old\r\ninstitution remains. The body to which this monopoly was given, was\r\nnot mercantile. Their object is to simplify, as much as possible, the\r\nadministration of their affairs. They sell for cash; they purchase,\r\ntherefore, with cash. Their interest, their principles, and their\r\npractice seem opposed to the general interest of the kingdom, which\r\nwould require, that this capital article should be laid open to a free\r\nexchange for the productions of this country. So far does the spirit of\r\nsimplifying their operations govern this body, that, relinquishing the\r\nadvantages to be derived from a competition of sellers, they contracted\r\nsome time ago with a single person (Mr. Morris) for three years’\r\nsupplies of American tobacco, to be paid for in cash. They obliged\r\nthemselves, too, expressly, to employ no other person to purchase in\r\nAmerica, during that term. In consequence of this, the mercantile houses\r\nof France, concerned in sending her productions to be exchanged for\r\ntobacco, cut off for three years from the hope of selling these tobaccos\r\nin France, were of necessity to abandon that commerce. In consequence of\r\nthis, too, a single individual, constituted sole purchaser of so great a\r\nproportion of the tobaccos made, had the price in his own power. A great\r\nreduction in it took place, and that not only on the quantity he bought,\r\nbut on the whole quantity made. The loss to the States producing the\r\narticle, did not go to cheapen it for their friends here. Their price\r\nwas fixed. What was gained on their consumption, was to enrich the\r\nperson purchasing it; the rest, the monopolists and merchants of other\r\ncountries. The effect of this operation was vitally felt by every farmer\r\nin America, concerned in the culture of this plant. At the end of the\r\nyear, he found he had lost a fourth or a third of his revenue; the\r\nState, the same proportion of its subjects of exchange with other\r\nnations: the manufactures of this country, too, were either not to go\r\nthere at all, or go through the channel of a new monopoly, which, freed\r\nfrom the control of competition in prices and qualities, was not likely\r\nto extend their consumption. It became necessary to relieve the two\r\ncountries from the fatal effects of this double monopoly. I had the\r\nhonor of addressing a letter, on the 15th day of August, 1785, to his\r\nlate Excellency, the Count de Vergennes, upon this subject, a copy of\r\nwhich I do myself the honor herein to enclose. The effectual mode of\r\nrelief was to lay the commerce open. But the King’s interest was also\r\nto be guarded. A committee was appointed to take this matter into\r\nconsideration; and the result was, an order to the Farmers General, that\r\nno such contract should be made again. And to furnish such aliment as\r\nmight keep that branch of commerce alive, till the expiration of the\r\npresent contract, they were required to put the merchants in general on\r\na level with Mr. Morris, for the quantity of twelve or fifteen thousand\r\nhogsheads a year. That this relief, too, might not be intercepted from\r\nthe merchants of the two suffering nations, by those of a neighboring\r\none, and that the transportation of so bulky an article might go to\r\nnourish their own shipping, no tobaccos were to be counted of this\r\npurchase, but those brought in French or American vessels. Of this\r\norder, made at Bernis, his Excellency, Count de Vergennes, was pleased\r\nto honor me with a communication, by a letter of the 30th of May, 1786;\r\ndesiring that I would publish it as well in America as to the American\r\nmerchants in France. I did so; communicating it to Congress at the same\r\ntime. This order, thus viewed, with the transactions which produced\r\nit, will be seen to have been necessary; and its punctual and candid\r\nexecution has been rendered still more so, by the speculations of the\r\nmerchants, entered into on the faith of it. Otherwise it would become\r\nthe instrument of their ruin instead of their relief. A twelvemonth\r\nhas elapsed some time since; and it is questioned, whether the Farmers\r\nGeneral have purchased, within that time, the quantity prescribed, and\r\non the conditions prescribed. It would be impossible for the merchants\r\nto prove the negative; it will be easy for the Farmers General to show\r\nthe affirmative, if it exists. I hope that a branch of commerce of this\r\nextent, will be thought interesting enough to both nations to render it\r\nthe desire of your Excellency to require, as I deem it my duty to ask,\r\na report of the purchases they have made, according to the conditions\r\nof the order of Bernis, specifying in that report, 1. The quantities\r\npurchased; 2. the prices paid; 3. the dates of the purchase and payment;\r\n4. the flag of the vessel in which imported; 5. her name; 6. her port\r\nof delivery; and 7. the name of the seller. The four first articles make\r\npart of the conditions required by the order of Bernis; the three last\r\nmay be necessary for the correction of any errors, which should happen\r\nto arise in the report.\r\n\r\nBut the order of Bernis was never considered but as a temporary relief.\r\nThe radical evil will still remain. There will be but one purchaser in\r\nthe kingdom, and the hazard of his refusal will damp every mercantile\r\nspeculation. It is very much to be desired, that before the expiration\r\nof this order, some measure may be devised, which may bring this great\r\narticle into free commerce between the two nations. Had this been\r\npracticable at the time it was put into Farm, that mode of collecting\r\nthe revenue would probably never have been adopted: now that it has\r\nbecome practicable, it seems reasonable to discontinue this mode, and to\r\nsubstitute some of those practised on other imported articles, on which\r\na revenue is levied, without absolutely suppressing them in commerce.\r\nIf the revenue can be secured, the interests of a few individuals will\r\nhardly be permitted to weigh against those of as many millions, equally\r\nsubjects of his Majesty, and against those, too, of a nation allied\r\nto him by all the ties of treaty, of interest, and of affection. The\r\nprivileges of the most favored nation have been mutually exchanged by\r\ntreaty. But the productions of other nations, which do not rival those\r\nof France, are suffered to be bought and sold freely within the kingdom.\r\nBy prohibiting all his Majesty’s subjects from dealing in tobacco,\r\nexcept with a single company, one third of the exports of the United\r\nStates are rendered uncommerciable here. This production is so\r\npeculiarly theirs, that its shackles affect no other nation. A relief\r\nfrom these shackles will form a memorable epoch in the commerce of\r\nthe two nations. It will establish at once a great basis of exchange\r\nserving, like a point of union, to draw to it other members of our\r\ncommerce. Nature, too, has conveniently assorted our wants and our\r\nsuperfluities to each other. Each nation has exactly to spare the\r\narticles which the other wants. We have a surplus of rice, tobacco,\r\nfurs, peltry, potash, lamp-oils, timber, which France wants; she has a\r\nsurplus of wines, brandies, esculent oils, fruits, and manufactures of\r\nall kinds, which we want. The governments have nothing to do, but not\r\nto hinder their merchants from making the exchange. The difference of\r\nlanguage, laws, and customs, will be some obstacle for a time; but the\r\ninterest of the merchants will surmount them. A more serious obstacle\r\nis our debt to Great Britain. Yet, since the treaty between this country\r\nand that, I should not despair of seeing that debt paid, in part, with\r\nthe productions of France, if our produce can obtain here a free course\r\nof exchange for them. The distant prospect is still more promising. A\r\ncentury’s experience has shown, that we double our numbers every twenty\r\nor twenty-five years. No circumstance can be foreseen, at this moment,\r\nwhich will lessen our rate of multiplication for centuries to come. For\r\nevery article of the productions and manufactures of this country, then,\r\nwhich can be introduced into habit there, the demand will double every\r\ntwenty or twenty-five years. And to introduce the habit, we have only to\r\nlet the merchants alone. Whether we may descend, by a single step,\r\nfrom the present state to that of perfect freedom of commerce in this\r\narticle; whether any, and what, intermediate operation may be necessary\r\nto prepare the way to this; what cautions must be observed for the\r\nsecurity of his Majesty’s revenue, which we do not wish to impair, will\r\nrest with the wisdom of his ministers, whose knowledge of the subject\r\nwill enable them to devise the best plans, and whose patriotism and\r\njustice will dispose them to pursue them. To the friendly dispositions\r\nof your Excellency, of which we have had such early and multiplied\r\nproofs, I take the liberty of committing this subject, particularly,\r\ntrusting that some method may be devised of reconciling the collection\r\nof his Majesty’s revenues with the interests of the two nations; and\r\nhave the honor of assuring you of those sincere sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I am your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXI.--TO MR. SKIPWITH, July 28, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SKIPWITH.\r\n\r\nParis, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA long journey has prevented me from writing to any of my friends for\r\nsome time past. This was undertaken with a view to benefit a dislocated\r\nand ill-set wrist, by the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence. Finding\r\nthis hope vain, I was led from other views to cross the Alps as far as\r\nTurin, Milan, Genoa; to follow the Mediterranean as far as Cette, the\r\ncanal of Languedoc, the Garonne, &c, to Paris. A most pleasing journey\r\nit proved; arts and agriculture offering something new at every step,\r\nand often things worth our imitation. But the accounts from our country\r\ngive me to believe, that we are not in a condition to hope for the\r\nimitation of any thing good. All my letters are filled with details of\r\nour extravagance. From these accounts, I look back to the time of the\r\nwar, as a time of happiness and enjoyment, when amidst the privation\r\nof many things not essential to happiness, we could not run in debt,\r\nbecause nobody would trust us; when we practised, of necessity, the\r\nmaxim of buying nothing but what we had money in our pockets to pay\r\nfor; a maxim, which, of all others, lays the broadest foundation for\r\nhappiness. I see no remedy to our evils, but an open course of law.\r\nHarsh as it may seem, it would relieve the very patients who dread it,\r\nby stopping the course of their extravagance, before it renders their\r\naffairs entirely desperate. The eternal and bitter strictures on our\r\nconduct, which teem in every London paper, and are copied from them into\r\nothers, fill me with anxiety on this subject. The state of things in\r\nEurope is rather threatening at this moment. The innovations of the\r\nEmperor in his dominions, have excited a spirit of resistance. His\r\nsubjects in Brabant and Flanders are arming, and he has put forty-five\r\nthousand troops in motion towards that country. I believe they will come\r\nto blows. The parties in Holland have already spilt too much blood to be\r\neasily stopped. If left to themselves, I apprehend the Stadtholderians\r\nwill be too strong; and if foreign powers interfere, the weight is still\r\non their side. England and Prussia will be too much for France. As it is\r\ncertain that neither of these powers wish for war, and that England and\r\nFrance are particularly averse to it, perhaps the matter may end in an\r\narmed mediation. If the mediators should not agree, they will draw their\r\nnegotiations into length, and trust to the chapter of accidents for\r\ntheir final solution. With respect to our country, it stands well with\r\nthe present ministry here. The non-payment of our debt is against us. We\r\nare occupied in procuring favorable terms of reception for our produce.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAdieu, my Dear Sir, and be assured of the sentiments of sincere esteem\r\nof your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXII.--TO J. W. EPPES, July 28,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. W. EPPES.\r\n\r\nParis, July 28,1787.\r\n\r\nDear Jack,\r\n\r\nThe letter which you were so kind as to write to me the 22nd of May,\r\n1786, was not delivered to me till the 3rd of May, 1787, when it found\r\nme in the neighborhood of Marseilles. Before that time you must have\r\ntaken your degree, as mentioned in your letter. Those public testimonies\r\nwhich are earned by merit, and not by solicitation, may always be\r\naccepted without the imputation of vanity. Of this nature is the\r\ndegree which your masters proposed to confer on you. I congratulate you\r\nsincerely on it. It will be a pleasing event to yourself; it will be the\r\nsame to your parents and friends, and to none more than myself. Go on\r\ndeserving applause, and you will be sure to meet with it: and the way to\r\ndeserve it, is to be good, and to be industrious. I am sure you will be\r\ngood, and hope you will be industrious. As to your future plan, I am\r\ntoo distant from you, to advise you on sure grounds. In general, I am\r\nof opinion that till the age of about sixteen, we are best employed on\r\nlanguages; Latin, Greek, French, and Spanish, or such of them as we can.\r\nAfter this, I think the College of William and Mary the best place to\r\ngo through courses of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy in its different\r\nbranches, and Law. Of the languages I have mentioned, I think Greek the\r\nleast useful. Write me word, from time to time, how you go on. I shall\r\nalways be glad to assist you with any books you may have occasion for,\r\nand you may count with certainty on every service I can ever render you,\r\nas well as on the sincere esteem of, Dear Jack, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIII.--TO A. DONALD, July 28, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. DONALD.\r\n\r\nParis, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received with infinite satisfaction your letter of the 1st of March:\r\nit was the first information I had of your being in America. There is no\r\nperson whom I shall see again with more cordial joy, whenever it shall\r\nbe my lot to return to my native country; nor any one whose prosperity,\r\nin the mean time, will be more interesting to me. I find as I grow\r\nolder, that I set a higher value on the intimacies of my youth, and am\r\nmore afflicted by whatever loses one of them to me. Should it be in my\r\npower to render any service, in your shipment of tobacco to Havre de\r\nGrace, I shall do it with great pleasure. The order of Bernis has, I\r\nbelieve, been evaded by the Farmers General as much as possible. At\r\nthis moment, I receive information from most of the seaports, that they\r\nrefuse taking any tobacco, under the pretext, that they have purchased\r\ntheir whole quantity. From Havre I have heard nothing, and believe you\r\nwill stand a better chance there than any where else. Being one of the\r\nports of manufacture, too, it is entitled to a higher price. I have now\r\ndesired that the Farmers may make a distinct return of their purchases,\r\nwhich are conformable to the order of Bernis. If they have really bought\r\ntheir quantity, on those terms, we must be satisfied: if they have not,\r\nI shall propose their being obliged to make it up instantly. There is a\r\nconsiderable accumulation of tobacco in the ports.\r\n\r\nAmong many good qualities which my countrymen possess, some of a\r\ndifferent character unhappily mix themselves. The most remarkable are\r\nindolence, extravagance, and infidelity to their engagements. Cure the\r\ntwo first, and the last would disappear, because it is a consequence\r\nof them, and not proceeding from a want of morals. I know of no remedy\r\nagainst indolence and extravagance, but a free course of justice. Every\r\nthing else is merely palliative: but unhappily, the evil has gained\r\ntoo generally the mass of the nation, to leave the course of justice\r\nunobstructed. The maxim of buying nothing without the money in our\r\npockets to pay for it, would make of our country one of the happiest\r\nupon earth. Experience during the war proved this; as I think every man\r\nwill remember, that under all the privations it obliged him to submit\r\nto, during that period, he slept sounder, and awaked happier than he\r\ncan do now. Desperate of finding relief from a free course of justice,\r\nI look forward to the abolition of all credit, as the only other\r\nremedy which can take place. I have seen, therefore, with pleasure, the\r\nexaggerations of our want of faith, with which the London papers\r\nteem. It is, indeed, a strong medicine for sensible minds, but it is a\r\nmedicine. It will prevent their crediting us abroad, in which case, we\r\ncannot be credited at home. I have been much concerned at the losses\r\nproduced by the fire of Richmond. I hope you have escaped them. It will\r\ngive me much pleasure to hear from you, as often as you can spare a\r\nmoment to write. Be assured that nobody entertains for you sentiments of\r\nmore perfect and sincere esteem than, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIV.--TO WILLIAM DRAYTON, July 30, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DRAYTON.\r\n\r\nParis, July 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHaving observed that the consumption of rice in this country, and\r\nparticularly in this capital, was very great, I thought it my duty\r\nto inform myself from what markets they draw their supplies, in what\r\nproportion from ours, and whether it might not be practicable to\r\nincrease that proportion. This city being little concerned in foreign\r\ncommerce, it is difficult to obtain information on particular branches\r\nof it in the detail. I addressed myself to the retailers of rice, and\r\nfrom them received a mixture of truth and error, which I was unable to\r\nsift apart in the first moment. Continuing, however, my inquiries, they\r\nproduced at length this result; that the dealers here, were in the habit\r\nof selling two qualities of rice, that of Carolina, with which they were\r\nsupplied chiefly from England, and that of Piedmont: that the Carolina\r\nrice was long, slender, white, and transparent, answers well when\r\nprepared with milk, sugar, &ic. but not so well when prepared _au gras_;\r\nthat that of Piedmont was shorter, thicker, and less white, but that it\r\npresented its form better when dressed _au gras_, was better tasted,\r\nand therefore preferred by good judges for those purposes: that the\r\nconsumption of rice, in this form, was much the most considerable, but\r\nthat the superior beauty of the Carolina rice, seducing the eye of those\r\npurchasers who are attached to appearances, the demand for it was\r\nupon the whole as great as for that of Piedmont. They supposed this\r\ndifference of quality to proceed from a difference of management; that\r\nthe Carolina rice was husked with an instrument which broke it more,\r\nand that less pains were taken to separate the broken from the unbroken\r\ngrains; imagining that it was the broken grains which dissolved in oily\r\npreparations: that the Carolina rice costs somewhat less than that\r\nof Piedmont; but that being obliged to sort the whole grains from the\r\nbroken, in order to satisfy the taste of their customers, they ask and\r\nreceive as much for the first quality of Carolina, when sorted, as for\r\nthe rice of Piedmont; but the second and third qualities, obtained by\r\nsorting, are sold much cheaper. The objection to the Carolina rice\r\nthen, being, that it crumbles in certain forms of preparation, and\r\nthis supposed to be the effect of a less perfect machine for husking, I\r\nflattered myself I should be able to learn what might be the machine of\r\nPiedmont, when I should arrive at Marseilles, to which place I was to\r\ngo in the course of a tour through the seaport towns of this country.\r\nAt Marseilles, however, they differed as much in the account of the\r\nmachine, as at Paris they had differed about other circumstances. Some\r\nsaid it was husked between mill-stones, others between rubbers of wood\r\nin the form of mill-stones, others of cork. They concurred in one fact,\r\nhowever, that the machine might be seen by me, immediately on crossing\r\nthe Alps. This would be an affair of three weeks. I crossed them, and\r\nwent through the rice country from Vercelli to Pavia, about sixty\r\nmiles. I found the machine to be absolutely the same with that used\r\nin Carolina, as well as I could recollect a description which Mr. E.\r\nRutledge had given me of it. It is on the plan of a powder-mill. In some\r\nof them, indeed, they arm each pestle with an iron tooth, consisting of\r\nnine spikes hooped together, which I do not remember in the description\r\nof Mr. Rutledge. I therefore had a tooth made, which I have the honor\r\nof forwarding you with this letter; observing, at the same time, that\r\nas many of their machines are without teeth as with them, and of course,\r\nthat the advantage is not very palpable. It seems to follow, then, that\r\nthe rice of Lombardy (for though called Piedmont rice, it does not grow\r\nin that country, but in Lombardy) is of a different species from that of\r\nCarolina; different in form, in color, and in quality. We know that in\r\nAsia they have several distinct species of this grain. Monsieur Poivre,\r\na former Governor of the Isle of France, in travelling through several\r\ncountries of Asia, observed with particular attention the objects of\r\ntheir agriculture, and he tells us, that in Cochin-China they cultivate\r\nsix several kinds of rice, which he describes, three of them requiring\r\nwater, and three growing on highlands. The rice of Carolina is said to\r\nhave come from Madagascar, and De Poivre tells us, it is the white rice\r\nwhich is cultivated there. This favors the probability of its being of a\r\ndifferent species originally, from that of Piedmont; and time, culture,\r\nand climate may have made it still more different. Under this idea, I\r\nthought it would be well to furnish you with some of the Piedmont rice,\r\nunhusked, but was told it was contrary to the laws to export it in\r\nthat form. I took such measures as I could, however, to have a quantity\r\nbrought out, and lest these should fail, I brought, myself, a few\r\npounds. A part of this I have addressed to you by the way of London;\r\na part comes with this letter; and I shall send another parcel by some\r\nother conveyance, to prevent the danger of miscarriage. Any one of them\r\narriving safe, may serve to put in seed, should the society think it\r\nan object. This seed, too, coming from Vercelli, where the best rice is\r\nsupposed to grow, is more to be depended on, than what may be sent me\r\nhereafter. There is a rice from the Levant, which is considered as of a\r\nquality still different, and some think it superior to that of Piedmont.\r\nThe troubles which have existed in that country for several years back,\r\nhave intercepted it from the European market, so that it is become\r\nalmost unknown. I procured a bag of it, however, at Marseilles, and\r\nanother of the best rice of Lombardy, which are on their way to\r\nthis place, and when arrived, I will forward you a quantity of each,\r\nsufficient to enable you to judge of their qualities when prepared for\r\nthe table. I have also taken measures to have a quantity of it brought\r\nfrom the Levant, unhusked. If I succeed, it shall be forwarded in\r\nlike manner. I should think it certainly advantageous to cultivate, in\r\nCarolina and Georgia, the two qualities demanded at market; because the\r\nprogress of culture, with us, may soon get beyond the demand for the\r\nwhite rice; and because, too, there is often a brisk demand for the one\r\nquality, when the market is glutted with the other. I should hope there\r\nwould be no danger of losing the species of white rice, by a confusion\r\nwith the other. This would be a real misfortune, as I should not\r\nhesitate to pronounce the white, upon the whole, the most precious of\r\nthe two, for us.\r\n\r\nThe dry rice of Cochin-China has the reputation of being the whitest to\r\nthe eye, best flavored to the taste, and most productive. It seems then\r\nto unite the good qualities of both the others known to us. Could it\r\nsupplant them, it would be a great happiness, as it would enable us to\r\nget rid of those ponds of stagnant water, so fatal to human health and\r\nlife. But such is the force of habit, and caprice of taste, that\r\nwe could not be sure beforehand, it would produce this effect. The\r\nexperiment, however, is worth trying, should it only end in producing\r\na third quality, and increasing the demand. I will endeavor to procure\r\nsome to be brought from Cochin-China. The event, however, will be\r\nuncertain and distant.\r\n\r\nI was induced, in the course of my journey through the south of France,\r\nto pay very particular attention to the objects of their culture,\r\nbecause the resemblance of their climate to that of the southern parts\r\nof the United States authorizes us to presume we may adopt any of their\r\narticles of culture, which we would wish for. We should not wish for\r\ntheir wines, though they are good and abundant. The culture of the vine\r\nis not desirable in lands capable of producing any thing else. It is a\r\nspecies of gambling, and of desperate gambling too, wherein, whether you\r\nmake much or nothing, you are equally ruined. The middling crop alone is\r\nthe saving point, and that the seasons seldom hit. Accordingly, we see\r\nmuch wretchedness among this class of cultivators. Wine, too, is so\r\ncheap in these countries, that a laborer with us, employed in the\r\nculture of any other article, may exchange it for wine, more and better\r\nthan he could raise himself. It is a resource for a country, the whole\r\nof whose good soil is otherwise employed, and which still has some\r\nbarren spots, and a surplus of population to employ on them. There the\r\nvine is good, because it is something in the place of nothing. It may\r\nbecome a resource to us at a still earlier period: when the increase of\r\npopulation shall increase our productions beyond the demand for them,\r\nboth at home and abroad. Instead of going on to make an useless surplus\r\nof them, we may employ our supernumerary hands on the vine. But that\r\nperiod is not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe almond tree is also so precarious, that none can depend for\r\nsubsistence on its produce, but persons of capital.\r\n\r\nThe caper, though a more tender plant, is more certain in its produce,\r\nbecause a mound of earth of the size of a cucumber hill, thrown over the\r\nplant in the fall, protects it effectually against the cold of winter.\r\nWhen the danger of frost is over in the spring, they uncover it, and\r\nbegin its culture. There is a great deal of this in the neighborhood of\r\nToulon. The plants are set about eight feet apart, and yield, one year\r\nwith another, about two pounds of caper each, worth on the spot six\r\npence sterling the pound. They require little culture, and this may\r\nbe performed either with the plough or hoe. The principal work is the\r\ngathering of the fruit as it forms. Every plant must be picked every\r\nother day, from the last of June till the middle of October. But this is\r\nthe work of women and children. This plant does well in any kind of soil\r\nwhich is dry, or even in walls where there is no soil, and it lasts the\r\nlife of a man. Toulon would be the proper port to apply for them. I must\r\nobserve, that the preceding details cannot be relied on with the fullest\r\ncertainty, because, in the canton where this plant is cultivated, the\r\ninhabitants speak no written language, but a medley, which I could\r\nunderstand but very imperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe fig and mulberry are so well known in America, that nothing need\r\nbe said of them. Their culture, too, is by women and children, and\r\ntherefore earnestly to be desired in countries where there are\r\nslaves. In these, the women and children are often employed in labors\r\ndisproportioned to their sex and age. By presenting to the master\r\nobjects of culture, easier and equally beneficial, all temptation to\r\nmisemploy them would be removed, and the lot of this tender part of our\r\nspecies be much softened. By varying too the articles of culture, we\r\nmultiply the chances for making something, and disarm the seasons, in a\r\nproportionable degree, of their calamitous effects.\r\n\r\nThe olive is a tree the least known in America, and yet the most worthy\r\nof being known. Of all the gifts of heaven to man, it is next to the\r\nmost precious, if it be not the most precious. Perhaps it may claim\r\na preference even to bread; because there is such an infinitude of\r\nvegetables, which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment. In\r\npassing the Alps at the Col de Tende, where they are mere masses of\r\nrock, wherever there happens to be a little soil, there are a number of\r\nolive trees, and a village supported by them. Take away these trees, and\r\nthe same ground, in corn, would not support a single family. A pound of\r\noil, which can be bought for three or four pence sterling, is equivalent\r\nto many pounds of flesh, by the quantity of vegetables it will prepare,\r\nand render fit and comfortable food. Without this tree, the country of\r\nProvence and territory of Genoa, would not support one half, perhaps\r\nnot one third, their present inhabitants. The nature of the soil is of\r\nlittle consequence, if it be dry. The trees are planted from fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet apart, and when tolerably good, will yield fifteen or twenty\r\npounds of oil yearly, one with another. There are trees which yield much\r\nmore. They begin to render good crops at twenty years old, and last till\r\nkilled by cold, which happens at some time or other, even in their best\r\npositions in France. But they put out again from their roots. In Italy,\r\nI am told, they have trees of two hundred years old. They afford an\r\neasy but constant employment through the year, and require so little\r\nnourishment, that if the soil be fit for any other production, it may\r\nbe cultivated among the olive trees, without injuring them. The northern\r\nlimits of this tree, are the mountains of the Cevennes, from about the\r\nmeridian of Carcassonne to the Rhone, and from thence, the Alps and\r\nApennines as far as Genoa, I know, and how much farther I am not\r\ninformed. The shelter of these mountains may be considered as equivalent\r\nto a degree and a half of latitude, at least; because westward of the\r\ncommencement of the Cevennes, there are no olive trees in 43 1/2°\r\nor even 43° of latitude, whereas, we find them now on the Rhone at\r\nPierrelatte, in 44 1/2°, and formerly they were at Tains, above the\r\nmouth of the Isere, in 45°, sheltered by the near approach of the\r\nCevennes and Alps, which only leave there a passage for the Rhone.\r\nWhether such a shelter exists or not, in the States of South Carolina\r\nand Georgia, I know not. But this we may say, either that it exists, or\r\nthat it is not necessary there; because we know that they produce\r\nthe orange in open air; and wherever the orange will stand at all,\r\nexperience shows that the olive will stand well; being a hardier tree.\r\nNotwithstanding the great quantities of oil made in France, they have\r\nnot enough for their own consumption, and therefore import from other\r\ncountries. This is an article, the consumption of which will always keep\r\npace with its production. Raise it; and it begets its own demand. Little\r\nis carried to America, because Europe has it not to spare. We therefore\r\nhave not learned the use of it. But cover the southern States with it,\r\nand every man will become a consumer of oil, within whose reach it can\r\nbe brought, in point of price. If the memory of those persons is held\r\nin great respect in South Carolina, who introduced there the culture\r\nof rice, a plant which sows life and death with almost equal hand, what\r\nobligations would be due to him who should introduce the olive tree, and\r\nset the example of its culture! Were the owner of slaves to view it\r\nonly as the means of bettering their condition, how much would he better\r\nthat, by planting one of those trees for every slave he possessed!\r\nHaving been myself an eye-witness to the blessings which this tree sheds\r\non the poor, I never had my wishes so kindled for the introduction of\r\nany article of new culture into our own country. South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia appear to me to be the States, wherein its success, in favorable\r\npositions at least, could not be doubted, and I flattered myself, it\r\nwould come within the views of the society for agriculture, to begin the\r\nexperiments which are to prove its practicability. Carcassonne is the\r\nplace from which the plants may be most certainly and cheaply obtained.\r\nThey can be sent from thence by water to Bordeaux, where they may be\r\nembarked on vessels bound to Charleston. There is too little intercourse\r\nbetween Charleston and Marseilles, to propose this as the port of\r\nexportation. I offer my services to the society, for the obtaining and\r\nforwarding any number of plants which may be desired.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit the subject of climates, and the plants adapted to them,\r\nI will add, as a matter of curiosity, and of some utility too, that\r\nmy journey through the southern parts of France, and the territory of\r\nGenoa, but still more the crossing of the Alps, enabled me to form a\r\nscale of the tenderer plants, and to arrange them according to their\r\ndifferent powers of resisting cold. In passing the Alps at the Col de\r\nTende, we cross three very high mountains, successively. In ascending,\r\nwe lose these plants, one after another, as we rise, and find them again\r\nin the contrary order, as we descend on the other side; and this is\r\nrepeated three times. Their order, proceeding from the tenderest to the\r\nhardiest, is as follows. Caper, orange, palm, aloe, olive, pomegranate,\r\nwalnut, fig, almond. But this must be understood of the plant only;\r\nfor as to the fruit, the order is somewhat different. The caper, for\r\nexample, is the tenderest plant; yet, being so easily protected, it is\r\namong the most certain in its fruit. The almond, the hardiest plant,\r\nloses its fruit the oftenest, on account of its forwardness. The palm,\r\nhardier than the caper and orange, never produces perfect fruit here.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of sending you, the last year, some seeds of the sulla\r\nof Malta, or Spanish saintfoin. Lest they should have miscarried, I\r\nnow pack with the rice a canister of the same kind of seed, raised\r\nby myself. By Colonel Franks, in the month of February last, I sent a\r\nparcel of acorns of the cork-oak, which I desired him to ask the favor\r\nof the Delegates of South Carolina in Congress, to forward to you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXV.--TO JAMES MADISON, August 2, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, August 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last was of June the 20th. Yours, received since that date, are of\r\nMay the 15th, and June the 6th. In mine, I acknowledged the receipt of\r\nthe paccan nuts which came sealed up. I have reason to believe those in\r\nthe box have arrived at L’Orient. By the Mary, Captain Howland, lately\r\nsailed from Havre to New York, I shipped three boxes of books, one\r\nmarked J. M. for yourself, one marked B. F. for Dr. Franklin, and one\r\nmarked W. H. for William Hay in Richmond. I have taken the liberty of\r\naddressing them all to you, as you will see by the enclosed bill of\r\nlading, in hopes you will be so good as to forward the other two. You\r\nwill have opportunities of calling on the gentlemen for the freight,\r\n&c. In yours, you will find the books, noted in the account enclosed\r\nherewith. You have now Mably’s works complete, except that on Poland,\r\nwhich I have never been able to get, but shall not cease to search\r\nfor. Some other volumes are wanting too, to complete your collection of\r\nChronologies. The fourth volume of D’Albon was lost by the bookbinder,\r\nand I have not yet been able to get one to replace it. I shall continue\r\nto try. The _Memoires sur les Droits et Impositions en Europe_ (cited by\r\nSmith) was a scarce and excessively dear book. They are now reprinting\r\nit. I think it will be in three or four quartos, of from nine to twelve\r\nlivres a volume. When it is finished, I shall take a copy for you.\r\nAmelot’s Travels into China, I can learn nothing of. I put among the\r\nbooks sent you, two somewhat voluminous, and the object of which\r\nwill need explanation; these are the _Tableau de Paris_ and _L’Espion\r\nAnglois_. The former is truly a picture of private manners in Paris, but\r\npresented on the dark side, and a little darkened moreover. But there\r\nis so much truth in its groundwork, that it will be well worth your\r\nreading. You will then know Paris (and probably the other large cities\r\nof Europe) as well as if you had been there for years. _L’Espion\r\nAnglois_ is no caricature. It will give you a just idea of the wheels by\r\nwhich the machine of government is worked here. There are in it, also,\r\nmany interesting details of the last war, which, in general, may be\r\nrelied on. It may be considered as the small history of great events.\r\nI am in hopes, when you shall have read them, you will not think I have\r\nmisspent your money for them. My method for making out this assortment\r\nwas, to revise the list of my own purchases since the invoice of 1785,\r\nand to select such as I had found worth your having. Besides this,\r\nI have casually met with, and purchased, some few curious and cheap\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nI must trouble you on behalf of a Mr. Thomas Burke, at Loughburke near\r\nLoughrea in Ireland, whose brother, James Burke, is supposed to have\r\ndied, in 1785, on his passage from Jamaica, or St. Eustatius, to New\r\nYork. His property on board the vessel is understood to have come to the\r\nhands of Alderman Groom at New York. The enclosed copy of a letter\r\nto him will more fully explain it. A particular friend of mine here,\r\napplies to me for information, which I must ask the favor of you to\r\nprocure, and forward to me.\r\n\r\nWriting news to others, much pressed in time, and making this letter one\r\nof private business, I did not intend to have said any thing to you on\r\npolitical subjects. But I must press one subject. Mr. Adams informs me\r\nhe has borrowed money in Holland, which, if confirmed by Congress,\r\nwill enable them to pay, not only the interest due here to the foreign\r\nofficers, but the principal. Let me beseech you to reflect on the\r\nexpediency of transferring this debt to Holland. All our other debts\r\nin Europe do not injure our reputation so much as this. These gentlemen\r\nhave connections both in and out of office, and these again their\r\nconnections, so that our default on this article is further known,\r\nmore blamed, and excites worse dispositions against us, than you can\r\nconceive. If you think as I do, pray try to procure an order for paying\r\noff their capital. Mr. Adams adds, that if any certain tax is provided\r\nfor the payment of interest, Congress may borrow enough in Holland to\r\npay off their whole debts in France, both public and private, to the\r\ncrown, to the Farmers, and to Beaumarchais. Surely it will be better\r\nto transfer these debts to Holland. So critical is the state of that\r\ncountry, that I imagine the monied men of it, would be glad to place\r\ntheir money in foreign countries, and that Mr. Adams could borrow there\r\nfor us, without a certain tax for the interest, and saving our faith\r\ntoo, by previous explanations on that subject. This country is really\r\nsupposed on the eve of a * * * *. Such a spirit has risen within a few\r\nweeks, as could not have been believed. They see the great deficit in\r\ntheir revenues, and the hopes of economy lessen daily. The parliament\r\nrefuse to register any act for a new tax, and require an Assembly of\r\nthe States. The object of this Assembly is evidently to give law to the\r\nKing, to fix a constitution, to limit expenses. These views are said to\r\ngain upon the nation.*\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n     [ * The parts of this letter marked by asterisks, are in\r\n     cipher, and unintelligible.]\r\n\r\nA final decision of some sort, should be made on Beaumarchais’ affairs.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, Dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVI.--TO THOMAS BARCLAY, August 3, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 3, 1787,\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of June the\r\n29th, and July the 6th and 8th.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the affair of Geraud and Roland in Holland, had\r\nbetter be committed to Mr. Dumas in Holland, as lawsuits must always\r\nbe attended to by some person on the spot. For the same reason, I\r\nthink that of La Vayse and Puchilberg should be managed by the agent at\r\nL’Orient, and Gruel’s by the agent at Nantes. I shall always be ready\r\nto assist the agents of L’Orient and Nantes, in any way in my power; but\r\nwere the details to be left to me, they would languish, necessarily, on\r\naccount, of my distance from the place, and perhaps suffer too, for want\r\nof verbal consultations with the lawyers entrusted with them. You are\r\nnow with Congress, and can take their orders on the subject. I shall\r\ntherefore, do nothing in these matters, in reliance that you will\r\nput them into such channel as they direct, furnishing the necessary\r\ndocuments and explanations.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWith respect to French’s affair, being perfectly satisfied myself, I\r\nhave not ceased, nor shall I ‘cease, endeavoring to satisfy others, that\r\nyour conduct has been that of an honest and honorable debtor, and\r\ntheirs the counterpart of Shylock in the play. I enclose you a letter\r\ncontaining my testimony on your general conduct, which I have written to\r\nrelieve a debt of justice pressing on my mind, well knowing at the same\r\ntime, you will not stand in need of it in America. Your conduct is too\r\nwell known to Congress, your character to all the world, to need any\r\ntestimonials.\r\n\r\nThe moment I close my despatches for the packet, which will be the\r\n9th instant, I shall with great pleasure go to pay my respects to\r\nMrs. Barclay at St. Germain, to satisfy her on the subject of your\r\ntransactions, and to assure her that my resources shall be hers, as long\r\nas I have any. A multitude of letters to write, prevents my entering\r\ninto the field of public news, further than to observe, that it is\r\nextremely doubtful whether the affairs of Holland will, or will not\r\nproduce a war between France, on one side, and England and Prussia, on.\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of the sincere esteem and respect, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your friend\r\n\r\nand servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVII.--TO E. CARRINGTON, August 4,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, August 4,1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince mine of the 16th of January, I have been honored by your favors of\r\nApril the 24th and June the 9th. I am happy to find that the States have\r\ncome so generally into the scheme of the federal convention, from which,\r\nI am sure, we shall see wise propositions. I confess, I do not go as\r\nfar in the reforms thought necessary, as some of my correspondents in\r\nAmerica; but if the convention should adopt such propositions, I shall\r\nsuppose them necessary. My general plan would be, to make the States\r\none as to every thing connected with foreign nations, and several as\r\nto every thing purely domestic. But with all the imperfections of our\r\npresent government, it is, without comparison, the best existing, or\r\nthat ever did exist. Its greatest defect is the imperfect manner in\r\nwhich matters of commerce have been provided for. It has been so often\r\nsaid, as to be generally believed, that Congress have no power by the\r\nConfederation to enforce any thing; for example, contributions of money.\r\nIt was not necessary to give them that power expressly; they have it\r\nby the law of nature. When two parties make a compact, there results to\r\neach a power of compelling the other to execute it. Compulsion was never\r\nso easy as in our case, where a single frigate would soon levy on the\r\ncommerce of any State the deficiency of its contributions; nor more\r\nsafe than in the hands of Congress, which has always shown that it\r\nwould wait, as it ought to do, to the last extremities, before it\r\nwould execute any of its powers which are disagreeable. I think it\r\nvery material, to separate, in the hands of Congress, the executive and\r\nlegislative powers, as the judiciary already are, in some degree. This,\r\nI hope, will be done. The want of it has been the source of more\r\nevil, than we have experienced from any other cause. Nothing is so\r\nembarrassing nor so mischievous, in a great assembly, as the details\r\nof execution. The smallest trifle of that kind, occupies as long as the\r\nmost important act of legislation, and takes place of every thing else.\r\nLet any man recollect, or look over, the files of Congress: he will\r\nobserve the most important propositions hanging over, from week to week,\r\nand month to month, till the occasions have passed them, and the things\r\nnever done. I have ever viewed the executive details as the greatest\r\ncause of evil to us, because they in fact place us as if we had no\r\nfederal head, by diverting the attention of that head from great to\r\nsmall objects; and should this division of power not be recommended by\r\nthe convention, it is my opinion, Congress should make it, itself, by\r\nestablishing an executive committee.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVIII.--TO DR. CURRIE, August 4, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. CURRIE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am favored with your letter of May the 2nd, and most cordially\r\nsympathize in your late immense losses. It is a situation in which a man\r\nneeds the aid of all his wisdom and philosophy. But as it is better\r\nto turn from the contemplation of our misfortunes, to the resources\r\nwe possess for extricating ourselves, you will, of course, have found\r\nsolace in your vigor of mind, health of body, talents, habits of\r\nbusiness, in the consideration that you have time yet to retrieve every\r\nthing, and a knowledge that the very activity necessary for this, is a\r\nstate of greater happiness than the unoccupied one, to which you had a\r\nthought of retiring. I wish the bulk of my extravagant countrymen had as\r\ngood prospects and resources as you. But with many of them, a feebleness\r\nof mind makes them afraid to probe the true state of their affairs, and\r\nprocrastinate the reformation which alone can save something, to those\r\nwho may yet be saved. How happy a people were we during the war, from\r\nthe single circumstance that we could not run in debt! This counteracted\r\nall the inconveniences we felt, as the present facility of ruining\r\nourselves overweighs all the blessings of peace. I know no condition\r\nhappier than that of a Virginia farmer might be, conducting himself as\r\nhe did during the war. His estate supplies a good table, clothes itself\r\nand his family with their ordinary apparel, furnishes a small surplus to\r\nbuy salt, sugar, coffee, and a little finery for his wife and daughters,\r\nenables him to receive and to visit his friends, and furnishes him\r\npleasing and healthy occupation. To secure all this, he needs but one\r\nact of self-denial, to put off buying any thing till he has the money to\r\npay for it. Mr. Ammonett did not come. He wrote to me, however, and I am\r\nmaking inquiry for the town and family he indicated. As yet, neither\r\ncan be heard of, and were they to be found, the length of time would\r\nprobably bar all claims against them. I have seen no object present\r\nso many desperate faces. However, if inquiry can lighten our way, that\r\nshall not be wanting, and I will write to him as soon as we discover\r\nany thing, or despair of discovering. Littlepage has succeeded well in\r\nPoland. He has some office, it is said, worth five hundred guineas a\r\nyear. The box of seeds you were so kind as to forward me, came safe to\r\nhand. The arrival of my daughter, in good health, has been a source\r\nof immense comfort to me. The injury of which you had heard, was a\r\ndislocated wrist, and though it happened eleven months ago, was a simple\r\ndislocation, and immediately aided by the best surgeon in Paris, it is\r\nneither well, nor ever will be, so as to render me much service. The\r\nfingers remain swelled and crooked, the hand withered, and the joint\r\nhaving a very confined motion. You ask me when I shall return. My\r\ncommission expires next spring, and if not renewed, I shall return then.\r\nIf renewed, I shall stay somewhat longer: how much, will not depend on\r\nme altogether. So far as it does, I cannot fix the epoch of my return,\r\nthough I always flatter myself it is not very distant. My habits are\r\nformed to those of my own country. I am past the time of changing them,\r\nand am, therefore, less happy any where else than there.\r\n\r\nI shall always be happy to hear from you, being with very sincere\r\nesteem, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIX.--TO MR. HAWKINS, August 4, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAWKINS.\r\n\r\nParis, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of March the 8th and\r\nJune the 9th, and to give you many thanks for the trouble you have taken\r\nwith the _dionæa muscipula_. I have not yet heard any thing of them,\r\nwhich makes me fear they have perished by the way. I believe the most\r\neffectual means of conveying them hither will be by the seed. I must add\r\nmy thanks too for the vocabularies. This is an object I mean to pursue,\r\nas I am persuaded that the only method of investigating the filiation of\r\nthe Indian nations, is by that of their languages.\r\n\r\nI look up with you to the federal convention, for an amendment of our\r\nfederal affairs; yet I do not view them in so disadvantageous a light\r\nat present, as some do. And above all things, I am astonished at some\r\npeople’s considering a kingly government as a refuge. Advise such to\r\nread the fable of the frogs, who solicited Jupiter for a king. If that\r\ndoes not put them to rights, send them to Europe, to see something of\r\nthe trappings of monarchy, and I will undertake, that every man shall go\r\nback thoroughly cured. If all the evils which can arise among us, from\r\nthe republican form of our government, from this day to the day of\r\njudgment, could be put into a scale against what this country suffers\r\nfrom its monarchical form, in a week, or England, in a month, the latter\r\nwould preponderate. Consider the contents of the Red Book in England, or\r\nthe Almanac Royale of France, and say what a people gain by monarchy.\r\nNo race of kings has ever presented above one man of common, sense, in\r\ntwenty generations. The best they can do is, to leave things to their\r\nministers; and what are their ministers, but a committee, badly chosen?\r\nIf the king ever meddles, it is to do harm. Adieu, my Dear Sir, and be\r\nassured of the esteem of your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXX.--TO COLONEL MONROE, August 5, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 5, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA journey of between three and four months, into the southern parts of\r\nFrance and northern of Italy, has prevented my writing to you. In\r\nthe mean time, you have changed your ground, and engaged in different\r\noccupations, so that I know not whether the news of this side the water\r\nwill even amuse you. However, it is all I have for you. The storm which\r\nseemed to be raised suddenly in Brabant, will probably blow over.\r\nThe Emperor, on his return to Vienna, pretended to revoke all the\r\nconcessions which had been made by his Governors General, to his\r\nBrabantine subjects; but he, at the same time, called for deputies from\r\namong them to consult with. He will use their agency to draw himself out\r\nof the scrape, and all there I think will be quieted. Hostilities go on\r\noccasionally in Holland. France espouses the cause of the Patriots, as\r\nyou know, and England and Prussia that of the Stadtholder. France and\r\nEngland are both unwilling to bring on a war, but a hasty move of the\r\nKing of Prussia will perplex them. He has thought the stopping his\r\nsister sufficient cause for sacrificing a hundred or two thousand of his\r\nsubjects, and as many Hollanders and French. He has therefore ordered\r\ntwenty thousand men to march, without consulting England, or even his\r\nown ministers. He may thus drag England into a war, and of course this\r\ncountry, against their will. But it is certain they will do every thing\r\nthey can, to prevent it; and that in this, at least, they agree.\r\n\r\nThough such a war might be gainful to us, yet it is much to be\r\ndeprecated by us at this time. In all probability, France would be\r\nunequal to such a war by sea and by land, and it is not our interest or\r\neven safe for us, that she should be weakened. The great improvements\r\nin their constitution, effected by the _Assemblée des Notables_, you\r\nare apprized of. That of partitioning the country into a number\r\nof subordinate governments, under the administration of Provincial\r\nAssemblies, chosen by the people, is a capital one. But to the delirium\r\nof joy which these improvements gave the nation, a strange reverse of\r\ntemper has suddenly succeeded. The deficiencies of their revenue\r\nwere exposed, and they were frightful. Yet there was an appearance\r\nof intention to economize and reduce the expenses of government. But\r\nexpenses are still very, inconsiderately incurred, and all reformation\r\nin that point despaired of. The public credit is affected; and such a\r\nspirit of discontent has arisen, as has never been seen. The parliament\r\nrefused to register the edict for a stamp tax, or any other tax, and\r\ncall for the States General, who alone, they say, can impose a new\r\ntax. They speak with a boldness unexampled. The King has called them to\r\nVersailles to-morrow, where he will hold a _lit de justice_ and compel\r\nthem to register the tax. How the chapter will finish, we must wait to\r\nsee. By a vessel lately sailed from Havre to New York, I have sent\r\nyou some more _livraisons_ of the _Encyclopédie_, down to the 22nd\r\ninclusive. They were in a box with Dr. Currie’s, and addressed to Mr.\r\nMadison, who will forward them to Richmond. I have heard you are in the\r\nAssembly. I will beg the favor of you, therefore, to give me, at the\r\nclose of the session, a history of the most remarkable acts passed,\r\nthe parties and views of the House, &c. This, with the small news of\r\nmy country, crops and prices, furnish you abundant matter to treat\r\nme, while I have nothing to give you in return, but the history of\r\nthe follies of nations in their dotage. Present me in respectful and\r\nfriendly terms to Mrs. Monroe, and be assured of the sincere sentiments\r\nof esteem and attachment, with which I am Dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXI.--TO JOHN JAY, August 6,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 6,1787.\r\n\r\nThe last letter I had the honor of addressing you was dated June\r\nthe 21st. I have now that of enclosing you a letter from the Swedish\r\nambassador, praying that inquiry may be made for a vessel of his nation,\r\npiratically carried off, and measures taken relative to the vessel,\r\ncargo, and crew. Also a letter from William Russell and others, citizens\r\nof America, concerned in trade to the island of Guadaloupe, addressed\r\nto the Marechal de Castries, and complaining of the shutting to them the\r\nport of Point a Pitre, and receiving them only at Basse-terre. This was\r\nenclosed to me by the subscribers, to be delivered to the Marechal de\r\nCastries. But the present is not the moment to move in that business:\r\nand moreover, I suppose, that whenever parties are within the reach of\r\nCongress, they should apply to them, and my instructions come through\r\nthat channel. Matters, arising within the kingdom of France, to which\r\nmy commission is limited, and not admitting time to take the orders\r\nof Congress, I suppose I may move in originally. I also enclose you\r\nthe copy of a letter from Mr. Barclay, closing his proceedings in our\r\naffairs with Morocco. Before this reaches you, he will have had the\r\nhonor of presenting himself to you in person. After his departure, the\r\nparliament of Bordeaux decided that he was liable to arrest. This was\r\ndone on a letter from the minister, informing them that Mr. Barclay\r\nwas invested with no character which privileged him from arrest. His\r\nconstant character of consul was no protection, and they did not explain\r\nwhether his character to Morocco was not originally diplomatic, or\r\nwas expired. Mr. Barclay’s proceedings under this commission being now\r\nclosed, it would be incumbent on me to declare with respect to them, as\r\nwell as his consular transactions, my opinion of the judgment, zeal, and\r\ndisinterestedness with which he has conducted himself; were it not that\r\nCongress has been so possessed of those transactions from time to time,\r\nas to judge for themselves. I cannot but be uneasy, lest my delay of\r\nentering on the subject of the consular convention, may be disapproved.\r\nMy hope was and is, that more practicable terms might be obtained: in\r\nthis hope, I do nothing till further orders, observing by an extract\r\nfrom the journals you were pleased to send me, that Congress have\r\nreferred the matter to your consideration, and conscious that we are not\r\nsuffering in the mean time, as we have not a single consul in France,\r\nsince the departure of Mr. Barclay. I mentioned to you in my last, the\r\nrevival of the hopes of the Chevalier de la Luzerne. I thought it\r\nmy duty to remind the Count de Montmorin, the other day, of the long\r\nabsence of their minister from Congress. He told me, the Chevalier de\r\nla Luzerne would not be sent back, but that we might rely, that in the\r\nmonth of October a person would be sent, with whom we should be content.\r\nHe did not name the person, though there is no doubt that it is the\r\nCount de Mourtier. It is an appointment, which, according to the opinion\r\nI have formed of him, bids as fair to give content, as any one which\r\ncould be made.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned in my last letter, that I had proposed the reducing the\r\nsubstance of Monsieur de Calonne’s letter into the form of an _Arrêt_,\r\nwith some alterations, which, on consultation with the merchants at the\r\ndifferent ports I visited, I had found to be necessary. I received soon\r\nafter a letter from the Comptroller General, informing me, that the\r\nletter of Monsieur de Calonne was in a course of execution. Of this, I\r\nenclose you a copy. I was, in that moment, enclosing to him my general\r\nobservations on that letter, a copy of which is also enclosed. In these\r\nI stated all the alterations I wished to have made. It became expedient\r\nsoon after, to bring on the article of tobacco; first, to know whether\r\nthe Farmers had executed the order of Bernis, and also to prepare some\r\narrangements to succeed the expiration of this order. So that I am\r\nnow pursuing the whole subject of our commerce, 1. to have necessary\r\namendments made in Monsieur de Calonne’s letter; 2. to put it into a\r\nmore stable form; 3. to have full execution of the order of Bernis; 4.\r\nto provide arrangements for the article of tobacco, after that order\r\nshall be expired. By the copy of my letter on the two last points,\r\nyou will perceive that I again press the abolition of the Farm of this\r\narticle. The conferences on that subject give no hope of effecting that.\r\nSome poor palliative is probably all we shall obtain. The Marquis de la\r\nFayette goes hand in hand with me in all these transactions, and is\r\nan invaluable auxiliary to me. I hope it will not be imputed either\r\nto partiality or affectation, my naming this gentleman so often in my\r\ndespatches. Were I not to do it, it would be a suppression of truth, and\r\nthe taking to myself the whole merit where he has the greatest share.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, on his return to Vienna, disavowed the concessions of\r\nhis Governors General to his subjects of Brabant. He at the same time\r\nproposed their sending deputies to him, to consult on their affairs.\r\nThey refused in the first moment; but afterwards nominated deputies;\r\nwithout giving them any power, however, to concede any thing. In the\r\nmean time, they are arming and training themselves. Probably the Emperor\r\nwill avail himself of the aid of these deputies, to tread back his\r\nsteps. He will be the more prompt to do this, that he may be in\r\nreadiness to act freely, if he finds occasion, in the new scenes\r\npreparing in Holland. What these will be, cannot be foreseen. You\r\nwell know, that the original party-divisions of that country were into\r\nStadtholderians, Aristocrats, and Democrats. There was a subdivision\r\nof the Aristocrats, into violent and moderate, which was important.\r\nThe violent Aristocrats would have wished to preserve all the powers\r\nof government in the hands of the Regents, and that these should remain\r\nself-elective: but choosing to receive a modification of these powers\r\nfrom the Stadtholder, rather than from the people, they threw themselves\r\ninto his scale. The moderate Aristocrats would have consented to a\r\ntemperate mixture of democracy, and particularly, that the Regents\r\nshould be elected by the people. They were the declared enemies of the\r\nStadtholder, and acted in concert with the Democrats, forming with them\r\nwhat was called the Patriots. It is the opinion of dispassionate\r\npeople on the spot, that their views might have been effected. But the\r\ndemocratic party aimed at more. They talked of establishing tribunes of\r\nthe people, of annual accounts, of depriving the magistrates at the will\r\nof the people, &c.; of enforcing all this with the arms in the hands of\r\nthe _corps francs_; and in some places, as at Heusden, Sprang, &c.\r\nbegan the execution of these projects. The moderate Aristocrats found it\r\ndifficult to strain their principles to this pitch. A schism took place\r\nbetween them and the Democrats, and the former have for some time been\r\ndropping off from the latter into the scale of the Stadtholder. This\r\nis the fatal coalition which governs without obstacle in Zealand,\r\nFriesland, and Guelderland, which constitutes the States of Utrecht, at\r\nAmersfort, and, with their aid, the plurality in the States General.\r\nThe States of Holland, Groningen, and Overyssel, vote as yet in the\r\nopposition. But the coalition gains ground in the States of Holland, and\r\nhas been prevalent in the Council of Amsterdam. If its progress be not\r\nstopped by a little moderation in the Democrats, it will turn the scale\r\ndecidedly in favor of the Stadtholder, in the event of their being left\r\nto themselves without foreign interference. If foreign powers interfere,\r\ntheir prospect does not brighten. I see no sure friends to the Patriots\r\nbut France, while Prussia and England are their assured enemies. Nor is\r\nit probable, that characters so greedy, so enterprising, as the Emperor\r\nand Empress, will be idle during such a struggle. Their views have long\r\nshown which side they would take. That France has engaged to interfere,\r\nand to support the Patriots, is beyond doubt. This engagement was\r\nentered into during the life of the late King of Prussia, whose eye was\r\nprincipally directed on the Emperor, and whose dispositions towards the\r\nPrince of Orange would have permitted him to be clipped a little close.\r\nBut the present King comes in with warmer dispositions towards the\r\nPrincess his sister. He has shown decidedly, that he will support her,\r\neven to the destruction of the balance of Europe, and the disturbance\r\nof its peace. The King of England has equally decided to support that\r\nhouse, at the risk of plunging his nation into another war. He supplies\r\nthe Prince with money at this moment. A particular remittance of one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand guineas is known of. But his ministry is\r\ndivided. Pitt is against the King’s opinion, the Duke of Richmond and\r\nthe rest of the ministers for it. Or, at least, such is the belief here.\r\nMr. Adams will have informed you more certainly. This division in the\r\nEnglish ministry, with the ill condition of their finances for war,\r\nproduces a disposition even in the King, to try first every pacific\r\nmeasure: and that country and this were laboring jointly to stop\r\nthe course of hostilities in Holland, to endeavor to effect an\r\naccommodation, and were scarcely executing at all the armaments ordered\r\nin their ports; when all of a sudden an inflammatory letter, written\r\nby the Princess of Orange to the King of Prussia, induces him, without\r\nconsulting England, without consulting even his own Council, to issue\r\norders by himself to his generals, to march twenty thousand men to\r\nrevenge the insult supposed to be offered to his sister. With a pride\r\nand egotism planted in the heart of every King, he considers her being\r\nstopped in the road, as a sufficient cause to sacrifice a hundred or two\r\nthousand of his own subjects, and as many of his enemies, and to spread\r\nfire, sword, and desolation over the half of Europe. This hasty measure\r\nhas embarrassed England, undesirous of war, if it can be avoided,\r\nyet unwilling to separate from the power who is to render its success\r\nprobable. Still you may be assured, that that court is going on in\r\nconcurrence with this, to prevent extremities, if possible; always\r\nunderstood, that if the war cannot be prevented, they will enter into\r\nit as parties, and in opposition to one another. This event is, in my\r\nopinion, to be deprecated by the friends of France. She never was equal\r\nto such a war by land, and such a one by sea; and less so now, than in\r\nany moment of the present reign. You remember that the nation was in a\r\ndelirium of joy on the convocation of the _Notables_, and on the various\r\nreformations agreed on between them and the government. The picture of\r\nthe distress of their finances was indeed frightful, but the intentions\r\nto reduce them to order seemed serious. The constitutional reformations\r\nhave gone on well, but those of expenses make little progress. Some\r\nof the most obviously useless have indeed been lopped off, but the\r\nremainder is a heavy mass, difficult to be reduced. Despair has seized\r\nevery mind, and they have passed from an extreme of joy to one of\r\ndiscontent. The parliament, therefore, oppose the registering any new\r\ntax, and insist on an Assembly of the States General. The object of\r\nthis is to limit expenses, and dictate a constitution. The edict for\r\nthe stamp tax has been the subject of reiterated orders and refusals to\r\nregister. At length, the King has summoned the parliament to Versailles\r\nto hold a bed of justice, in which he will order them, in person,\r\nto register the edict. At the moment of my writing, they are gone to\r\nVersailles for this purpose. There will yet remain to them, to protest\r\nagainst the register, as forced, and to issue orders against its\r\nexecution on pain of death. But as the King would have no peaceable mode\r\nof opposition left, it remains to be seen, whether they will push the\r\nmatter to this extremity. It is evident, I think, that the spirit of\r\nthis country is advancing towards a revolution in their constitution.\r\nThere are not wanting persons at the helm, friends to the progress\r\nof this spirit. The Provincial Assemblies will be the most probable\r\ninstrument of effecting it.\r\n\r\nSince writing thus far, I have received an intimation, that it will be\r\nagreeable not to press our commercial regulations at this moment, the\r\nministry being too much occupied with the difficulties surrounding them,\r\nto spare a moment on any subject which will admit of delay. Our business\r\nmust, therefore, be suspended for a while. To press it out of season,\r\nwould be to defeat, it. It would be felt as a vital benefit here, could\r\nwe relieve their finances, by paying what we owe. Congress will judge\r\nby Mr. Adams’s letters, how far the transferring all our debts in this\r\ncountry to Holland is practicable. On the replenishing their treasury\r\nwith our principal and interest, I should not be afraid to ask\r\nconcessions in favor of our West India trade. It would produce a great\r\nchange of opinion as to us and our affairs. In the _Assemblée des\r\nNotables_, hard things were said of us. They were induced, however,\r\nin committing us to writing, to smother their ideas a little. In their\r\nvotes, now gone to be printed, our debt is described in these words.\r\nThe twenty-first article of the account, formed of the interest of the\r\nclaims of his Majesty on the United States of America, cannot be drawn\r\nout for the present, except as a document. The recovery of these claims,\r\nas well principal as perhaps even interest, although they appear to\r\nrest on the most solid security, may, nevertheless, be long delayed, and\r\nshould not, consequently, be taken into account in estimating the annual\r\nrevenue. This article amounts to one million and six hundred thousand\r\nlivres.’ Above all things, it is desirable to hush the foreign officers\r\nby payment. Their wants, the nature of their services, their access\r\nto high characters, and connections with them, bespeak the reasons for\r\nthis. I hear also that Mr. Beaumarchais means to make himself heard,\r\nif a memorial which he sends by an agent in the present packet is not\r\nattended to, as he thinks it ought to be. He called on me with it,\r\nand desired me to recommend his case to a decision, and to note in my\r\ndespatch, that it was the first time he had spoken to me on the\r\nsubject. This is true, it being the first time I ever saw him; but my\r\nrecommendations would be as displaced as unnecessary. I assured him\r\nCongress would do in that business what justice should require, and\r\ntheir means enable them. The information sent me by Mr. Montgomery\r\nfrom Alicant, of the death of the Dey of Algiers, was not true. I had\r\nexpressed my doubt of it in my last, when I communicated it. I send\r\nherewith the newspapers to this date, and a remonstrance of the\r\nparliament, to show you in what language the King can be addressed at\r\nthis day. I have received no journal of Congress since the beginning of\r\nNovember last, and will thank you for them, if printed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 7. The parliament were received yesterday very harshly\r\nby the King. He obliged them to register the two edicts for the _impôt\r\nterritorial_ and stamp tax. When speaking in my letter of the reiterated\r\norders and refusals to register, which passed between the King and\r\nparliament, I omitted to insert the King’s answer to a deputation of\r\nparliament, which attended him at Versailles. It may serve to show\r\nthe spirit which exists between them. It was in these words, and these\r\nonly:--‘_Je vous ferai savoir mes intentions. Allez-vous-en. Qu’on ferme\r\nla porte._’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXII.--TO JOHN CHURCHMAN, August 8, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CHURCHMAN.\r\n\r\nParis, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor of June the 6th, and immediately\r\ncommunicated its contents to a member of the Academy. He told me that\r\nthey had received the other copy of your memorial, which you mention to\r\nhave sent through another channel; that your ideas were not conveyed so\r\nexplicitly, as to enable them to decide finally on their merit, but that\r\nthey had made an entry in their journals, to preserve to you the claim\r\nof the original idea. As far as we can conjecture it here, we imagine\r\nyou make a table of variations of the needle, for all the different\r\nmeridians whatever. To apply this table to use in the voyage between\r\nAmerica and Europe, suppose the variation to increase a degree in every\r\none hundred and sixty miles. Two difficulties occur; 1. a ready and\r\naccurate method of finding the variation of the place; 2. an instrument\r\nso perfect, as that (though the degree on it shall represent one hundred\r\nand sixty miles) it shall give the parts of the degree so minutely, as\r\nto answer the purpose of the navigator. The variation of the needle\r\nat Paris, actually, is 21° west. I make no question you have provided\r\nagainst the doubts entertained here, and I shall be happy that our\r\ncountry may have the honor of furnishing the old world, what it has so\r\nlong sought in vain.\r\n\r\nI am with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIII.--TO MONSIEUR L HOMMANDE, August 9, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR L HOMMANDE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAt the time you honored me with your letter of May the 31st, I was not\r\nreturned from a journey I had taken into Italy. This circumstance,\r\nwith the mass of business which had accumulated during my absence, must\r\napologize for the delay of my answer. Every discovery, which multiplies\r\nthe subsistence of man, must be a matter of joy to every friend to\r\nhumanity. As such, I learn with great satisfaction, that you have\r\nfound the means of preserving flour more perfectly than has been done\r\nhitherto. But I am not authorized to avail my country of it, by making\r\nany offer for its communication. Their policy is to leave their citizens\r\nfree, neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits. Though the\r\ninterposition of government in matters of invention has its use, yet it\r\nis in practice so inseparable from abuse, that they think it better\r\nnot to meddle with it. We are only to hope, therefore, that those\r\ngovernments, who are in the habit of directing all the actions of their\r\nsubjects by particular law, may be so far sensible of the duty they\r\nare under of cultivating useful discoveries, as to reward you amply for\r\nyours, which is among the most interesting to humanity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great consideration and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIV.--TO PETER CARR, August 10, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARR.\r\n\r\nParis, August 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Peter,\r\n\r\nI have received your two letters of December the 30th and April the\r\n18th, and am very happy to find by them, as well as by letters from Mr.\r\nWythe, that you have been so fortunate as to attract his notice and\r\ngood will: I am sure you will find this to have been one of the most\r\nfortunate events of your life, as I have ever been sensible it was of\r\nmine. I enclose you a sketch of the sciences to which I would wish you\r\nto apply, in such order as Mr. Wythe shall advise: I mention also the\r\nbooks in them worth your reading, which submit to his correction. Many\r\nof these are among your father’s books, which you should have brought\r\nto you. As I do not recollect those of them not in his library, you must\r\nwrite to me for them, making out a catalogue of such as you think you\r\nshall have occasion for in eighteen months from the date of your letter,\r\nand consulting Mr. Wythe on the subject. To this sketch I will add a few\r\nparticular observations.\r\n\r\n1. Italian. I fear the learning this language will confound your French\r\nand Spanish. Being all of them degenerated dialects of the Latin, they\r\nare apt to mix in conversation. I have never seen a person speaking the\r\nthree languages, who did not mix them. It is a delightful language, but\r\nlate events having rendered the Spanish more useful, lay it aside to\r\nprosecute that.\r\n\r\n2. Spanish. Bestow great attention on this, and endeavor to acquire an\r\naccurate knowledge of it. Our future connections with Spain and Spanish\r\nAmerica, will render that language a valuable acquisition. The ancient\r\nhistory of a great part of America, too, is written in that language. I\r\nsend you a dictionary.\r\n\r\n3. Moral Philosophy. I think it lost time to attend lectures on this\r\nbranch. He who made us would have been a pitiful bungler, if he had\r\nmade the rules of our moral conduct a matter of science. For one man\r\nof science, there are thousands who are not. What would have become of\r\nthem? Man was destined for society. His morality, therefore, was to be\r\nformed to this object. He was endowed with a sense of right and wrong,\r\nmerely relative to this. This sense is as much a part of his nature,\r\nas the sense of hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true foundation of\r\nmorality, and not the [Greek: no alon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greek phrase page216]\r\n\r\ntruth, &c, as fanciful writers have imagined. The moral sense, or\r\nconscience, is as much a part of man, as his leg or arm. It is given to\r\nall human beings, in a stronger or weaker degree, as force of members\r\nis given them in a greater or less degree. It may be strengthened\r\nby exercise, as may any particular limb of the body. This sense is\r\nsubmitted, indeed, in some degree, to the guidance of reason; but it is\r\na small stock which is required for this: even a less one than what we\r\ncall common sense. State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor.\r\nThe former will decide it as well, and often better than the latter,\r\nbecause he has not been led astray by artificial rules. In this branch,\r\ntherefore, read good books, because they will encourage, as well as\r\ndirect your feelings. The writings of Sterne, particularly, form the\r\nbest course of morality that ever was written. Besides these, read the\r\nbooks mentioned in the enclosed paper: and, above all things, lose no\r\noccasion of exercising your dispositions to be grateful, to be generous,\r\nto be charitable, to be humane, to be true, just, firm, orderly,\r\ncourageous, &c. Consider every act of this kind, as an exercise which\r\nwill strengthen your moral faculties, and increase your worth.\r\n\r\n4. Religion, Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object.\r\nIn the first place, divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty and\r\nsingularity of opinion. Indulge them in any other subject rather than\r\nthat of religion. It is too important, and the consequences of error may\r\nbe too serious. On the other hand, shake off all the fears and servile\r\nprejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason\r\nfirmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.\r\nQuestion with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be\r\none, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded\r\nfear. You will naturally examine, first, the religion of your own\r\ncountry. Read the Bible, then, as you would read Livy or Tacitus. The\r\nfacts which are within the ordinary course of nature, you will believe\r\non the authority of the writer, as you do those of the same kind in Livy\r\nand Tacitus. The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor, in one\r\nscale, and their not being against the laws of nature, does not weigh\r\nagainst them. But those facts in the Bible, which contradict the laws of\r\nnature, must be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces.\r\nHere you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from\r\nGod. Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and\r\nwhether that evidence is so strong, as that its falsehood would be more\r\nimprobable than a change of the laws of nature, in the case he relates.\r\nFor example, in the book of Joshua we are told the sun stood still\r\nseveral hours. Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus, we should\r\nclass it with their showers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts, &c.\r\nBut it is said, that the writer of that book was inspired. Examine,\r\ntherefore, candidly, what evidence there is of his having been inspired.\r\nThe pretension is entitled to your inquiry, because millions believe it.\r\nOn the other hand, you are astronomer enough to know, how contrary it\r\nis to the law of nature, that a body revolving on its axis, as the earth\r\ndoes, should have stopped, should not, by that sudden stoppage, have\r\nprostrated animals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain\r\ntime have resumed its revolution, and that without a second general\r\nprostration. Is this arrest of the earth’s motion, or the evidence which\r\naffirms it, most within the law of probabilities? You will next read the\r\nNew Testament. It is the history of a personage called Jesus. Keep in\r\nyour eye the opposite pretensions, 1. of those who say he was begotten\r\nby God, born of a virgin, suspended, and reversed the laws of nature at\r\nwill, and ascended bodily into heaven: and, 2. of those who say he was\r\na man, of illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic mind,\r\nwho set out without pretensions to divinity, ended in believing them,\r\nand was punished capitally for sedition, by being gibbeted, according\r\nto the Roman law, which punished the first commission of that offence by\r\nwhipping, and the second by exile or death _in furca_. See this law in\r\nthe Digest, Lib. 48, tit. 19, § 28. 3. and Lipsius, Lib. 2. _De Cruce_,\r\ncap. 2. These questions are examined in the books I have mentioned,\r\nunder the head of Religion, and several others. They will assist you in\r\nyour inquiries; but keep your reason firmly on the watch in reading\r\nthem all. Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its\r\nconsequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will find\r\nincitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its\r\nexercise, and the love of others which it will procure you. If you find\r\nreason to believe there is a God, a consciousness that you are acting\r\nunder his eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional\r\nincitement: if that there be a future state, the hope of a happy\r\nexistence in that, increases the appetite to deserve it: if that Jesus\r\nwas also a God, you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love.\r\nIn fine, I repeat, you must lay aside all prejudice on both sides,\r\nand neither believe nor reject any thing, because any other person, or\r\ndescription of persons, have rejected or believed it. Your own reason is\r\nthe only oracle given you by Heaven, and you are answerable not for the\r\nrightness, but uprightness of the decision. I forgot to observe, when\r\nspeaking of the New Testament, that you should read all the histories\r\nof Christ, as well of those whom a council of ecclesiastics have decided\r\nfor us to be Pseudo-evangelists, as those they named Evangelists.\r\nBecause these Pseudo-evangelists pretended to inspiration as much as the\r\nothers, and you are to judge their pretensions by your own reason, and\r\nnot by the reason of those ecclesiastics. Most of these are lost. There\r\nare some, however, still extant, collected by Fabricius, which I will\r\nendeavor to get and send you.\r\n\r\n5. Travelling. This makes men wiser, but less happy. When men of sober\r\nage travel, they gather knowledge, which they may apply usefully for\r\ntheir country; but they are subject ever after to recollections mixed\r\nwith regret; their affections are weakened by being extended over more\r\nobjects; and they learn new habits, which cannot be gratified when\r\nthey return home. Young men who travel are exposed to all these\r\ninconveniences in a higher degree, to others still more serious, and do\r\nnot acquire that wisdom for which a previous foundation is requisite, by\r\nrepeated and just observations at home. The glare of pomp and pleasure\r\nis analogous to the motion of the blood; it absorbs all their affection\r\nand attention; they are torn from it as from the only good in this\r\nworld, and return to their home as to a place of exile and condemnation.\r\nTheir eyes are for ever turned back to the object they have lost, and\r\nits recollection poisons the residue of their lives. Their first and\r\nmost delicate passions are hackneyed on unworthy objects here, and they\r\ncarry home the dregs, insufficient to make themselves or any body else\r\nhappy. Add to this, that a habit of idleness, an inability to apply\r\nthemselves to business is acquired, and renders them useless to\r\nthemselves and their country. These observations are founded in\r\nexperience. There is no place where your pursuit of knowledge will be\r\nso little obstructed by foreign objects, as in your own country, nor any\r\nwherein the virtues of the heart will be less exposed to be weakened. Be\r\ngood, be learned, and be industrious, and you will not want the aid\r\nof travelling, to render you precious to your country, dear to your\r\nfriends, happy within yourself. I repeat my advice, to take a great deal\r\nof exercise, and on foot. Health is the first requisite after morality.\r\nWrite to me often, and be assured of the interest I take in your\r\nsuccess, as well as the warmth of those sentiments of attachment with\r\nwhich I am, Dear Peter, your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXV.--TO DR. GILMER, August 11, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GILMER.\r\n\r\nParis, August 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Doctor,\r\n\r\nYour letter of January the 9th, 1787, came safely to hand in the month\r\nof June last. Unluckily you forgot to sign it, and your hand-writing is\r\nso Protean, that one cannot be sure it is yours. To increase the causes\r\nof incertitude, it was dated Pen-Park, a name which I only know, as the\r\nseat of John Harmer. The hand-writing, too, being somewhat in his style,\r\nmade me ascribe it hastily to him, indorse it with his name, and let\r\nit lie in my bundle to be answered at leisure. That moment of leisure\r\narriving, I sat down to answer it to John Harmer, and now, for the\r\nfirst time, discover marks of its being yours, and particularly those\r\nexpressions of friendship to myself and family, which you have ever been\r\nso good as to entertain, and which are to me among the most precious\r\npossessions. I wish my sense of this, and my desires of seeing you rich\r\nand happy, may not prevent my seeing any difficulty in the case you\r\nstate of George Harmer’s wills; which, as you state them, are thus.\r\n\r\n1. A will, dated December the 26th, 1779, written in his own hand, and\r\ndevising to his brother the estates he had received from him.\r\n\r\n2. Another will, dated June the 25th, 1782, written also in his own\r\nhand, devising his estate to trustees, to be conveyed to such of his\r\nrelations, I. H., I. L., or H. L., as should become capable of acquiring\r\nproperty, or, on failure of that, to be sold, and the money remitted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3. A third will, dated September the 12th, 1786, devising all his estate\r\nat Marrowbone, and his tracts at Horse-pasture and Poison-field to you;\r\nwhich will is admitted to record, and of course has been duly executed.\r\n\r\nYou say the learned are divided on these wills. Yet I see no cause of\r\ndivision, as it requires little learning to decide, that ‘the first\r\ndeed and last will must always prevail.’ I am afraid, therefore, the\r\ndifficulty may arise on the want of words of inheritance in the devise\r\nto you: for you state it as a devise to ‘George Gilmer’ (without adding\r\n‘and to his heirs’) of ‘all the _estate_ called Marrowbone,’ ‘the\r\n_tract_ called Horse-pasture,’ and ‘the tract called Poison-field.’ If\r\nthe question is on this point, and you have copied the words of the will\r\nexactly, I suppose you take an estate in fee simple in Marrowbone, and\r\nfor life only in Horse-pasture and Poison-field; the want of words of\r\ninheritance in the two last cases, being supplied as to the first, by\r\nthe word ‘estate,’ which has been repeatedly decided to be descriptive\r\nof the quantum of interest devised, as well as of its locality. I am in\r\nhopes, however, you have not copied the words exactly, that there are\r\nwords of inheritance to all the devises, as the testator certainly\r\nknew their necessity, and that the conflict only will be between the\r\ndifferent wills, in which case, I see nothing which can be opposed to\r\nthe last. I shall be very happy to eat at Pen-park some of the good\r\nmutton and beef of Marrowbone, Horse-pasture, and Poison-field, with\r\nyourself and Mrs. Gilmer, and my good old neighbors. I am as happy no\r\nwhere else, and in no other society, and all my wishes end, where I hope\r\nmy days will end, at Monticello. Too many scenes of happiness mingle\r\nthemselves with all the recollections of my native woods and fields, to\r\nsuffer them to be supplanted in my affection by any other. I consider\r\nmyself here as a traveller only, and not a resident. My commission\r\nexpires next spring, and if not renewed, I shall of course return then.\r\nIf renewed, I shall remain here some time longer. How much, I cannot\r\nsay; yet my wishes shorten the period. Among the strongest inducements,\r\nwill be that of your society and Mrs. Gilmer’s, which I am glad to find\r\nbrought more within reach, by your return to Pen-park. My daughters are\r\nimportunate to return also. Patsy enjoys good health, and is growing\r\nto my stature. Maria arrived here about a month ago, after a favorable\r\nvoyage, and in perfect health. My own health has been as good as ever,\r\nafter the first year’s probation. If you knew how agreeable to me are\r\nthe details of the small news of my neighborhood, your charity would\r\ninduce you to write frequently. Your letters lodged in the post-office\r\nat Richmond (to be forwarded to New York) come with certainty. We are\r\ndoubtful yet, whether there will be war or not. Present me with warm\r\naffection to Mrs. Gilmer, and be assured yourself of the unvarying\r\nsentiments of esteem and attachment, with which I am, Dear Doctor, your\r\nsincere friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVI.--TO JOSEPH JONES, August 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH JONES.\r\n\r\nParis, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have never yet thanked you, but with the heart, for the act of\r\nAssembly confirming the agreement with Maryland, the pamphlet, and\r\npapers, I received from you a twelvemonth ago. Very soon after their\r\nreceipt, I got my right wrist dislocated, which prevented me long from\r\nwriting, and as soon as that was able to bear it, I took a long journey,\r\nfrom which I am but lately returned. I am anxious to hear what\r\nour federal convention recommends, and what the States will do in\r\nconsequence of their recommendation. * * * * With all the defects of\r\nour constitution, whether general or particular, the comparison of our\r\ngovernments with those of Europe, is like a comparison of heaven and\r\nhell. England, like the earth, may be allowed to take the intermediate\r\nstation. And yet I hear there are people among you, who think the\r\nexperience of our governments has already proved, that republican\r\ngovernments will not answer. Send those gentry here, to count the\r\nblessings of monarchy. A king’s sister, for instance, stopped in the\r\nroad, and on a hostile journey, is sufficient cause for him to march\r\nimmediately twenty thousand men to revenge this insult, when he had\r\nshown himself little moved by the matter of right then in question.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFrom all these broils we are happily free, and that God may keep us long\r\nso, and yourself in health and happiness, is the prayer of,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, August 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was happy to find, by the letter of August the 1st, 1786, which you\r\ndid me the honor to write to me, that the modern dress for your statue,\r\nwould meet your approbation. I found it strongly the sentiment of\r\nWest, Copely, Trumbull, and Brown, in London; after which it would be\r\nridiculous to add, that it was my own. I think a modern in an antique\r\ndress, as just an object of ridicule, as a Hercules or Marius with a\r\nperiwig and chapeau bras.\r\n\r\nI remember having written to you, while Congress sat at Annapolis, on\r\nthe water communication between ours and the western country, and to\r\nhave mentioned, particularly, the information I had received of\r\nthe plain face of the country between the sources of Big-beaver and\r\nCayohoga, which made me hope that a canal, of no great expense, might\r\nunite the navigation of Lake Erie and the Ohio. You must since have had\r\noccasion of getting better information on this subject, and if you have,\r\nyou would oblige me by a communication of it. I consider this canal, if\r\npracticable, as a very important work.\r\n\r\nI remain in hopes of great and good effects from the decision of the\r\nAssembly over which you are presiding. To make our States one as to all\r\nforeign concerns, preserve them several as to all merely domestic,\r\nto give to the federal head some peaceable mode of enforcing its just\r\nauthority, to organize that head into legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary departments, are great desiderata in our federal constitution.\r\nYet with all its defects, and with all those of our particular\r\ngovernments, the inconveniences resulting from them are so light, in\r\ncomparison with those existing in every other government on earth, that\r\nour citizens may certainly be considered as in the happiest political\r\nsituation which exists.\r\n\r\nThe _Assemblée des Notables_ has been productive of much good in this\r\ncountry. The reformation of some of the most oppressive laws has taken\r\nplace, and is taking place. The allotment of the State into subordinate\r\ngovernments, the administration of which is committed to persons chosen\r\nby the people, will work in time a very beneficial change in their\r\nconstitution. The expense of the trappings of monarchy, too, is\r\nlightening. Many of the useless officers, high and low, of the King,\r\nQueen, and Princes, are struck off. Notwithstanding all this, the\r\ndiscovery of the abominable abuses of public money by the late\r\nComptroller General, some new expenses of the court, not of a piece with\r\nthe projects of reformation, and the imposition of new taxes, have, in\r\nthe course of a few weeks, raised a spirit of discontent in this nation,\r\nso great and so general, as to threaten serious consequences. The\r\nparliaments in general, and particularly that of Paris, put themselves\r\nat the head of this effervescence, and direct its object to the calling\r\nthe States General, who have not been assembled since 1614. The object\r\nis to fix a constitution, and to limit expenses. The King has been\r\nobliged to hold a bed of justice, to enforce the registering the new\r\ntaxes: the parliament, on their side, propose to issue a prohibition\r\nagainst their execution. Very possibly this may bring on their exile.\r\nThe mild and patriotic character of the new ministry is the principal\r\ndependence against this extremity.\r\n\r\nThe turn which the affairs of Europe will take, is not yet decided.\r\n\r\nA war, wherein France, Holland, and England should be parties, seems,\r\n_primâ facie_, to promise much advantage to us. But, in the first place,\r\nno war can be safe for us, which threatens France with an unfavorable\r\nissue. And, in the next, it will probably embark us again into the\r\nocean of speculation, engage us to overtrade ourselves, convert us into\r\nsea-rovers, under French and Dutch colors, divert us from agriculture,\r\nwhich is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute\r\nmost to real wealth, good morals, and happiness. The wealth acquired by\r\nspeculation and plunder, is fugacious in its nature, and fills society\r\nwith the spirit of gambling. The moderate and sure income of husbandry\r\nbegets permanent improvement, quiet life, and orderly conduct, both\r\npublic and private. We have no occasion for more commerce than to\r\ntake off our superfluous produce, and the people complain that some\r\nrestrictions prevent this; yet the price of articles with us, in\r\ngeneral, shows the contrary. Tobacco, indeed, is low, not because we\r\ncannot carry it where we please, but because we make more than the\r\nconsumption requires. Upon the whole, I think peace advantageous to\r\nus, necessary for Europe, and desirable for humanity. A few days will\r\ndecide, probably, whether all these considerations are to give way to\r\nthe bad passions of Kings, and those who would be Kings.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 15. The parliament is exiled to Troyes this morning. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVIII.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, August 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nParis, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI remember when you left us, it was with a promise to supply all the\r\ndefects of correspondence in our friends, of which we complained, and\r\nwhich you had felt in common with us. Yet I have received but one letter\r\nfrom you, which was dated June the 5th, 1786, and I answered it August\r\nthe 14th, 1786. Dropping that, however, and beginning a new account,\r\nI will observe to you, that wonderful improvements are making here in\r\nvarious lines. In architecture, the wall of circumvallation round\r\nParis, and the palaces by which we are to be let out and in, are\r\nnearly completed; four hospitals are to be built instead of the old\r\n_hôtel-dieu_; one of the old bridges has all its houses demolished, and\r\na second nearly so; a new bridge is begun at the Place Louis XV.; the\r\nPalais Royal is gutted, a considerable part in the centre of the\r\ngarden being dug out, and a subterranean circus begun, wherein will be\r\nequestrian exhibitions, &c. In society, the _habit habille_ is almost\r\nbanished, and they begin to go even to great suppers in frock: the court\r\nand diplomatic corps, however, must always be excepted. They are too\r\nhigh to be reached by any improvement. They are the last refuge from\r\nwhich etiquette, formality, and folly will be driven. Take away these,\r\nand they would be on a level with other people.\r\n\r\n     [After describing the unsettled state of Europe, as in some\r\n     of the preceding letters, the writer proceeds.]\r\n\r\nSo much for the blessings of having Kings, and magistrates who would be\r\nKings. From these events our young republics may learn useful lessons,\r\nnever to call on foreign powers to settle their differences, to guard\r\nagainst hereditary magistrates, to prevent their citizens from becoming\r\nso established in wealth and power, as to be thought worthy of alliance\r\nby marriage with the nieces, sisters, &c. of Kings, and, in short, to\r\nbesiege the throne of Heaven with eternal prayers, to extirpate from\r\ncreation this class of human lions, tigers, and mammoths, called Kings;\r\nfrom whom, let him perish who does not say, ‘Good Lord, deliver us;’ and\r\nthat so we may say, one and all, or perish, is the fervent prayer of\r\nhim who has the honor to mix with it sincere wishes for your health and\r\nhappiness, and to be, with real attachment and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIX.--TO JOHN JAY, August 15, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nAn American gentleman leaving Paris this afternoon, to go by the way\r\nof L’Orient to Boston, furnishes me the rare occasion of a conveyance,\r\nother than the packet, sure and quick. My letter by the packet informed\r\nyou of the bed of justice, for enregistering the stamp tax and land\r\ntax. The parliament, on their return came to an _Arrêtée_ (a resolution)\r\nwhich, besides protesting against the enregistering, as done by force,\r\nlaid the foundation for an _Arrêt de defence_ (an act) against the\r\nexecution of the two new laws. The question on the final _Arrêt_ was\r\nadjourned to the day before yesterday. It is believed they did not\r\nconclude on this _Arrêt_, as it has not appeared. However, there was a\r\nconcourse of about ten thousand people at the parliament house, who, on\r\ntheir adjournment, received them with acclamations of joy, loosened\r\nthe horses of the most eminent speakers against the tax from their\r\ncarriages, and drew them home. This morning, the parliament is exiled\r\nto Troyes. It is believed to proceed, principally, from the fear of a\r\npopular commotion here.\r\n\r\nThe officer charged by this court, to watch the English squadron, which\r\nwas under sailing orders, returned about a week ago with information\r\nthat it had sailed, having shaped its course west-wardly. This is\r\nanother step towards war. It is the more suspicious, as their minister\r\nhere denies the fact. Count Adhemar is here from London, by leave from\r\nhis court. The Duke of Dorset, the British ambassador here, has lately\r\ngone to London on leave. Neither of these ambassadors has the confidence\r\nof his court, on the point of abilities. The latter merits it for his\r\nhonesty. The minister of the British court, resident here, remains; but\r\nMr. Eden, their ambassador to Spain, under pretence of taking this\r\nin his route, is in truth their _fac-totum_ in the present emergency.\r\nNothing worth noting has occurred since my last, either in the Dutch or\r\nAustrian Netherlands.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XC.--TO JOHN ADAMS, August 30, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, August 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince your favor of July the 10th, mine have been of July the 17th,\r\n23rd, and 28th. The last enclosed a bill of exchange from Mr. Grand, on\r\nTessier, for £46. 17s. 10d. sterling, to answer General Sullivan’s bill\r\nfor that sum. I hope it got safe to hand, though I have been anxious\r\nabout it, as it went by post, and my letters through that channel\r\nsometimes miscarry.\r\n\r\nFrom the separation of the _Notables_ to the present moment, has been\r\nperhaps the most interesting interval ever known in this country.\r\nThe propositions of the government, approved by the _Notables_, were\r\nprecious to the nation, and have been in an honest course of execution,\r\nsome of them being carried into effect, and others preparing. Above all,\r\nthe establishment of the Provincial Assemblies, some of which have begun\r\ntheir sessions, bid fair to be the instrument for circumscribing the\r\npower of the crown, and raising the people into consideration. The\r\nelection given to them, is what will do this. Though the minister, who\r\nproposed these improvements, seems to have meant them as the price\r\nof the new supplies, the game has been so played, as to secure the\r\nimprovements to the nation, without securing the price. The _Notables_\r\nspoke softly on the subject of the additional supplies. But the\r\nparliament took them up roundly, refused to register the edicts for the\r\nnew taxes, till compelled in a bed of justice, and suffered themselves\r\nto be transferred to Troyes, rather than withdraw their opposition. It\r\nis urged principally against the King, that his revenue is one hundred\r\nand thirty millions more than that of his predecessor was, and yet he\r\ndemands one hundred and twenty millions further. You will see this well\r\nexplained in the ‘_Conference entre un Ministre d’etat et un Conseiller\r\nau parliament,_’ which I send you with some small pamphlets. In the\r\nmean time, all tongues in Paris (and in France as it is said) have been\r\nlet loose, and never was a license of speaking against the government,\r\nexercised in London more freely or more universally. Caricatures,\r\nplacards, _bons-mots_, have been indulged in by all ranks of people,\r\nand I know of no well attested instance of a single punishment. For some\r\ntime, mobs of ten, twenty, and thirty thousand people collected daily,\r\nsurrounded the Parliament house, huzzaed the members, even entered\r\nthe doors and examined into their conduct, took the horses out of the\r\ncarriages of those who did well, and drew them home. The government\r\nthought it prudent to prevent these, drew some regiments into the\r\nneighborhood, multiplied the guards, had the streets constantly\r\npatrolled by strong parties, suspended privileged places, forbade all\r\nclubs, &c. The mobs have ceased: perhaps this may be partly owing to the\r\nabsence of Parliament. The Count d’Artois, sent to hold a bed of justice\r\nin the _Cour des Aides_, was hissed and hooted without reserve, by the\r\npopulace; the carriage of Madame de (I forget the name), in the Queen’s\r\nlivery, was stopped by the populace, under a belief that it was Madame\r\nde Polignac, whom they would have insulted; the Queen, going to the\r\ntheatre at Versailles with Madame de Polignac, was received with a\r\ngeneral hiss. The King, long in the habit of drowning his cares in\r\nwine, plunges deeper and deeper. The Queen cries, but sins on. The Count\r\nd’Artois is detested, and Monsieur, the general favorite. The Archbishop\r\nof Toulouse is made minister principal, a virtuous, patriotic, and able\r\ncharacter. The Marechal de Castries retired yesterday, notwithstanding\r\nstrong solicitations to remain in office. The Marechal de Segur retired\r\nat the same time, prompted to it by the court. Their successors are not\r\nyet known. Monsieur de St. Priest goes ambassador to Holland, in the\r\nroom of Verac, transferred to Switzerland, and the Count de Moustier\r\ngoes to America, in the room of the Chevalier de la Luzerne, who has\r\na promise of the first vacancy. These nominations are not yet made\r\nformally, but they are decided on, and the parties are ordered to\r\nprepare for their destination.\r\n\r\nAs it has been long since I have had a confidential conveyance to you,\r\nI have brought together the principal facts from the adjournment of the\r\nNotables, to the present moment, which, as you will perceive from their\r\nnature, required a confidential conveyance. I have done it the rather,\r\nbecause, though you will have heard many of them, and seen them in the\r\npublic papers, yet, floating in the mass of lies which constitute the\r\natmosphere of London and Paris, you may not have been sure of their\r\ntruth; and I have mentioned every truth of any consequence, to enable\r\nyou to stamp as false, the facts pretermitted. I think that in the\r\ncourse of three months, the royal authority has lost, and the rights\r\nof the nation gained, as much ground by a revolution of public opinion\r\nonly, as England gained in all her civil wars under the Stuarts. I\r\nrather believe, too, they will retain the ground gained, because it\r\nis defended by the young and the middle-aged, in opposition to the old\r\nonly. The first party increases, and the latter diminishes daily, from\r\nthe course of nature. You may suppose, that in this situation, war would\r\nbe unwelcome to France. She will surely avoid it, if not forced into it\r\nby the courts of London and Berlin. If forced, it is probable she\r\nwill change the system of Europe totally, by an alliance with the two\r\nempires, to whom nothing would be more desirable. In the event of such\r\na coalition, not only Prussia, but the whole European world must receive\r\nfrom them their laws. But France will probably endeavor to preserve the\r\npresent system, if it can be done, by sacrificing, to a certain degree,\r\nthe pretensions of the patriotic party in Holland. But of all these\r\nmatters, you can judge, in your position, where less secrecy is\r\nobserved, better than I can.\r\n\r\nI have news from America as late as July the 19th. Nothing had\r\ntranspired from the federal convention. I am sorry they began their\r\ndeliberations by so abominable a precedent, as that of tying up the\r\ntongues of their members. Nothing can justify this example, but the\r\ninnocence of their intentions, and ignorance of the value of public\r\ndiscussions. I have no doubt that all their other measures will be good\r\nand wise. It is really an assembly of demigods. General Washington was\r\nof opinion, that they should not separate till October.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of friendship and respect,\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCI.--TO MR. WYTHE, September 16,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WYTHE.\r\n\r\nParis, September 16,1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of December the 13th\r\nand 22nd, 1786, and of January, 1787. These should not have been so\r\nlong unanswered, but that they arrived during my absence on a journey of\r\nbetween three and four months, through the southern parts of France and\r\nnorthern of Italy. In the latter country, my time allowed me to go no\r\nfurther than Turin, Milan, and Genoa: consequently, I scarcely got\r\ninto classical ground. I took with me some of the writings, in which\r\nendeavors have been made to investigate the passage of Annibal over the\r\nAlps, and was just able to satisfy myself, from a view of the\r\ncountry, that the descriptions given of his march are not sufficiently\r\nparticular, to enable us, at this day, even to guess at his track across\r\nthe Alps. In architecture, painting, sculpture, I found much amusement:\r\nbut more than all, in their agriculture, many objects of which might be\r\nadopted with us to great advantage. I am persuaded, there are many parts\r\nof our lower country where the olive tree might be raised, which is\r\nassuredly the richest gift of Heaven. I can scarcely except bread. I see\r\nthis tree supporting thousands among the Alps, where there is not soil\r\nenough to make bread for a single family. The caper, too, might be\r\ncultivated with us. The fig we do raise. I do not speak of the vine,\r\nbecause it is the parent of misery. Those who cultivate it are always\r\npoor, and he who would employ himself with us in the culture of corn,\r\ncotton, &c. can procure, in exchange for them, much more wine, and\r\nbetter, than he could raise by its direct culture.\r\n\r\nI sent you formerly copies of the documents on the Tagliaferro family,\r\nwhich I had received from Mr. Febroni. I now send the originals. I have\r\nprocured for you a copy of Polybius, the best edition; but the best\r\nedition of Vitruvius which is with the commentaries of Ficinus, is not\r\nto be got here. I have sent to Holland for it. In the mean time, the\r\nPolybius comes in a box containing books for Peter Carr, and for some of\r\nmy friends in Williamsburg and its vicinities. I have taken the liberty\r\nof addressing the box to you. It goes to New York in the packet-boat\r\nwhich carries this letter, and will be forwarded to you by water, by Mr.\r\nMadison. Its freight to New York is paid here. The transportation from\r\nthence to Williamsburg, will be demanded of you, and shall stand as the\r\nequivalent to the cost of Polybius and Vitruvius, if you please. The\r\ndifference either way, will not be worth the trouble of raising and\r\ntransmitting accounts. I send you herewith a state of the contents of\r\nthe box, and for whom each article is. Among these are some, as you will\r\nperceive, of which I ask your acceptance. It is a great comfort to me,\r\nthat while here, I am able to furnish some amusement to my friends, by\r\nsending them such productions of genius, ancient and modern, as might\r\notherwise escape them; and I hope they will permit me to avail myself of\r\nthe occasion, while it lasts.\r\n\r\nThis world is going all to war. I hope ours will remain clear of it. It\r\nis already declared between the Turks and Russians, and considering the\r\npresent situation of Holland, it cannot fail to spread itself all over\r\nEurope. Perhaps it may not be till next spring, that the other powers\r\nwill be engaged in it: nor is it as yet clear, how they will arrange\r\nthemselves. I think it not impossible, that France and the two empires\r\nmay join against all the rest. The Patriotic party in Holland will\r\nbe saved by this, and the Turks sacrificed. The only thing which can\r\nprevent the union of France and the two empires, is the difficulty of\r\nagreeing about the partition of the spoils. Constantinople is the key of\r\nAsia. Who shall have it, is the question. I cannot help looking forward\r\nto the re-establishment of the Greeks as a people, and the language of\r\nHomer becoming again a living language, as among possible events. You\r\nhave now with you Mr. Paradise, who can tell you how easily the modern\r\nmay be improved into the ancient Greek.\r\n\r\nYou ask me in your letter, what ameliorations I think necessary in our\r\nfederal constitution. It is now too late to answer the question, and\r\nit would always have been presumption in me to have done it. Your own\r\nideas, and those of the great characters who were to be concerned with\r\nyou in these discussions, will give the law, as they ought to do, to us\r\nall. My own general idea was, that the States should severally preserve\r\ntheir sovereignty in whatever concerns themselves alone, and that\r\nwhatever may concern another State, or any foreign nation, should be\r\nmade a part of the federal sovereignty: that the exercise of the federal\r\nsovereignty should be divided among three several bodies, legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary, as the State sovereignties are: and that\r\nsome peaceable means should be contrived, for the federal head to force\r\ncompliance on the part of the States. I have reflected on your idea of\r\nwooden or ivory diagrams, for the geometrical demonstrations. I should\r\nthink wood as good as ivory; and that in this case, it might add to the\r\nimprovement of the young gentlemen, that they should make the figures\r\nthemselves. Being furnished by a workman with a piece of vineer, no\r\nother tool than a penknife and a wooden rule would be necessary. Perhaps\r\npasteboards, or common cards, might be still more convenient. The\r\ndifficulty is, how to reconcile figures which must have a very sensible\r\nbreadth, to our ideas of a mathematical line, which, as it has neither\r\nbreadth nor thickness, will revolt more at these, than at simple lines\r\ndrawn on paper or slate. If, after reflecting on this proposition, you\r\nwould prefer having them made here, lay your commands on me, and they\r\nshall be executed.\r\n\r\nI return you a thousand thanks for your goodness to my nephew. After my\r\ndebt to you for whatever I am myself, it is increasing it too much,\r\nto interest yourself for his future fortune. But I know that to you, a\r\nconsciousness of doing good is a luxury ineffable. You have enjoyed it\r\nalready, beyond all human measure, and that you may long live to enjoy\r\nit, and to bless your country and friends, is the sincere prayer of him,\r\nwho is, with every possible sentiment of esteem and respect, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCII.--TO JOHN JAY, September 19, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, September 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you were of the 6th and 15th of August; since which,\r\nI have been honored with yours of July the 24th, acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of mine of the 14th and 23d of February. I am anxious to hear\r\nyou have received that also of May the 4th, written from Marseilles.\r\nAccording to the desires of Congress, expressed in their vote confirming\r\nthe appointments of Francisco Giuseppa and Girolamo Chiappi, their\r\nagents in Morocco, I have written letters to these gentlemen, to begin a\r\ncorrespondence with them. To the first, I have enclosed the ratification\r\nof the treaty with the Emperor of Morocco, and shall send it either by\r\nour agent at Marseilles, who is now here, or by the Count Daranda, who\r\nsets out for Madrid in a few days, having relinquished his embassy here.\r\nI shall proceed on the redemption of our captives at Algiers, as soon as\r\nthe commissioners of the treasury shall enable me, by placing the money\r\nnecessary under my orders. The prisoners redeemed by the religious order\r\nof Mathurins, cost about four hundred dollars each, and the General of\r\nthe order told me, that they had never been able to redeem foreigners on\r\nso good terms as their own countrymen. Supposing that their redemption,\r\nclothing, feeding, and transportation should amount to five hundred\r\ndollars each, there must be, at least, a sum of ten thousand dollars set\r\napart for this purpose. Till this is done, I shall take no other step\r\nthan the preparatory one, of destroying at Algiers all idea of our\r\nintending to redeem the prisoners. This, the General of the Mathurins\r\ntold me, was indispensably necessary, and that it must not, on any\r\naccount, transpire, that the public would interest themselves for their\r\nredemption. This was rendered the more necessary, by the declaration of\r\nthe Dey to the Spanish consul, that he should hold him responsible, at\r\nthe Spanish price, for our prisoners, even for such as should die. Three\r\nof them have died of the plague. By authorizing me to redeem at the\r\nprices usually paid by the European nations, Congress, I suppose, could\r\nnot mean the Spanish price, which is not only unusual but unprecedented,\r\nand would make our vessels the first object with those pirates. I\r\nshall pay no attention, therefore, to the Spanish price, unless further\r\ninstructed. Hard as it may seem, I should think it necessary, not to\r\nlet it be known even to the relations of the captives, that we mean to\r\nredeem them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to inclose you a paper from the admiralty of\r\nGuadaloupe, sent to me as a matter of form, and to be lodged, I suppose,\r\nwith our marine records. I enclose, also, a copy of a letter from the\r\nCount de Florida Blanca to Mr. Carmichael, by which you will perceive,\r\nthey have referred the settlement of the claim of South Carolina for\r\nthe use of their frigate, to Mr. Gardoqui, and to the Delegates of South\r\nCarolina in Congress.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to inform you in my last letter, of the parliament’s\r\nbeing transferred to Troyes. To put an end to the tumults in Paris,\r\nsome regiments were brought nearer, the patroles were strengthened and\r\nmultiplied, some mutineers punished by imprisonment: it produced the\r\ndesired effect. It is confidently believed, however, that the parliament\r\nwill be immediately recalled, the stamp tax and land tax repealed, and\r\nother means devised of accommodating their receipts and expenditures.\r\nThose supposed to be in contemplation, are, a rigorous levy of the old\r\ntax of the _deux vingtiemes_, on the rich, who had, in a great measure,\r\nwithdrawn their property from it, as well as on the poor, on whom it had\r\nprincipally fallen. This will greatly increase the receipts: while they\r\nare proceeding on the other hand, to reform their expenses far beyond\r\nwhat they had promised. It is said these reformations will amount to\r\neighty millions. Circumstances render these measures more and more\r\npressing. I mentioned to you in my last letter, that the officer\r\ncharged by the ministry to watch the motion of the British squadron, had\r\nreturned with information that it had sailed westwardly. The fact was\r\nnot true. He had formed his conclusion too hastily, and thus led the\r\nministry into error. The King of Prussia, urged on by England, has\r\npressed more and more the affairs of Holland and lately has given to the\r\nStates General of Holland four days only to comply with his demand.\r\nThis measure would, of itself, have rendered it impossible for France\r\nto proceed longer in the line of accommodation with Prussia. In the\r\nsame moment, an event takes place, which seems to render all attempt at\r\naccommodation idle. The Turks have declared war against the Russians,\r\nand that under circumstances which exclude all prospect of preventing\r\nits taking place. The King of Prussia having deserted his ancient\r\nfriends, there remain only France and Turkey, perhaps Spain also,\r\nto oppose the two empires, Prussia and England. By such a piece of\r\nQuixotism, France might plunge herself into ruin with the Turks and\r\nDutch, but would save neither. But there is certainly a confederacy\r\nsecretly in contemplation, of which the public have not yet the smallest\r\nsuspicion; that is between France and the two empires. I think it\r\nsure that Russia has desired this, and that the Emperor, after some\r\nhesitation, has acceded. It rests on this country to close. Her\r\nindignation against the King of Prussia will be some spur. She will\r\nthereby save her party in Holland, and only abandon the Turks to that\r\nfate she cannot ward off, and which their precipitation has brought on\r\nthemselves, by the instigation of the English ambassador at the Porte,\r\nand against the remonstrances of the French ambassador. Perhaps this\r\nformidable combination, should it take place, may prevent the war of the\r\nwestern powers, as it would seem that neither England nor Prussia would\r\ncarry their false calculations so far, as, with the aid of the Turks\r\nonly, to oppose themselves to such a force. In that case, the Patriots\r\nof Holland would be peaceably established in the powers of their\r\ngovernment, and the war go on against the Turks only, who would probably\r\nbe driven from Europe. This new arrangement would be a total change\r\nof the European system, and a favorable one for our friends. The\r\nprobability of a general war, in which this country would be engaged\r\non one side, and England on the other, has appeared to me sufficient to\r\njustify my writing to our agents in the different ports of France, to\r\nput our merchants on their guard, against risking their property in\r\nFrench or English bottoms. The Emperor, instead of treading back his\r\nsteps in Brabant, as was expected, has pursued the less honorable plan\r\nof decoying his subjects thence by false pretences, to let themselves\r\nbe invested by his troops, and this done, he dictates to them his own\r\nterms. Yet it is not certain the matter will end with that.\r\n\r\nThe Count De Moustier is nominated Minister Plenipotentiary to America;\r\nand a frigate is ordered to Cherbourg, to carry him over. He will\r\nendeavor to sail by the middle of the next month, but if any delay\r\nshould make him pass over the whole of October, he will defer his voyage\r\nto the spring, being unwilling to undertake a winter passage. Monsieur\r\nde St. Priest is sent ambassador to Holland, in the room of Monsieur\r\nde Verac, appointed to Switzerland. The Chevalier de Luzerne might,\r\nI believe,have gone to Holland, but he preferred a general promise of\r\npromotion, and the possibility that it might be to the court of London.\r\nHis prospects are very fair. His brother, the Count de la Luzerne, (now\r\nGovernor in the West Indies) is appointed minister of the marine, in\r\nthe place of Monsieur de Castries, who has resigned. The Archbishop of\r\nToulouse is appointed ministre principal, and his brother Monsieur\r\nde Brienne, minister of war, in the place of Monsieur de Segur. The\r\ndepartment of the Comptroller has had a very rapid succession of\r\ntenants. From Monsieur de Calonne it passed to Monsieur de Forqueux,\r\nfrom him to Villedeuil, and from him to Lambert, who holds it at\r\npresent, but divided with a Monsieur Cabarrus (whom I believe you knew\r\nin Spain), who is named _Directeur du tresor royal_, the office into\r\nwhich M. Necker came at first. I had the honor to inform you, that\r\nbefore the departure of the Count de Luzerne to his government in the\r\nWest Indies, I had pressed on him the patronage of our trade with the\r\nFrench islands; that he appeared well disposed, and assured me he would\r\nfavor us as much as his instructions, and the laws of the colonies,\r\nwould permit. I am in hopes, these dispositions will be strengthened by\r\nhis residence in the islands, and that his acquaintance among the people\r\nthere will be an additional motive to favor them. Probably they will\r\ntake advantage of his appointment, to press indulgences in commerce with\r\nus. The ministry is of a liberal complexion, and well disposed to\r\nus. The war may add to the motives for opening their islands to other\r\nresources for their subsistence, and for doing what may be agreeable to\r\nus. It seems to me at present, then, that the moment of the arrival of\r\nthe Count de la Luzerne will be the moment for trying to obtain a\r\nfreer access to their islands. It would be very material to do this, if\r\npossible, in a permanent way, that is to say, by treaty. But I know of\r\nnothing we have to offer in equivalent. Perhaps the payment of our\r\ndebt to them might be made use of as some inducement, while they are\r\nso distressed for money. Yet the borrowing the money in Holland will\r\nbe rendered more difficult by the same event, in proportion as it will\r\nincrease the demand for money by other powers.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of Ley den and France, to this date, are enclosed, together\r\nwith some pamphlets on the internal affairs of this country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIII.--TO CHARLES THOMSON, September 20, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.\r\n\r\nParis, September 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of April the 28th did not come to my hands till the 1st\r\ninstant. Unfortunately, the boxes of plants, which were a day too late\r\nto come by the April packet, missed the packet of June the 10th also,\r\nand only came by that of July the 25th. They are not yet arrived at\r\nParis, but I expect them daily. I am sensible of your kind attention to\r\nthem, and that as you were leaving New York, you took the course which\r\nbade fair to be the best. That they were forgotten in the hands in\r\nwhich you placed them, was probably owing to much business, and more\r\nimportant. I have desired Mr. Madison to refund to you the money,\r\nyou were so kind as to advance for me. The delay of your letter will\r\napologize for this delay of the repayment. I thank you also, for the\r\nextract of the letter you were so kind as to communicate to me, on the\r\nantiquities found in the western country. I wish that the persons who\r\ngo thither, would make very exact descriptions of what they see of that\r\nkind, without forming any theories. The moment a person forms a theory,\r\nhis imagination sees in every object, only the traits which favor that\r\ntheory. But it is too early to form theories on those antiquities.\r\nWe must wait with patience till more facts are collected. I wish your\r\nPhilosophical Society would collect exact descriptions of the several\r\nmonuments as yet known, and insert them naked in their Transactions, and\r\ncontinue their attention to those hereafter to be discovered. Patience\r\nand observation may enable us, in time, to solve the problem, whether\r\nthose who formed the scattering monuments in our western country, were\r\ncolonies sent off from Mexico or the founders of Mexico itself; whether\r\nboth were the descendants or the progenitors of the Asiatic red men.\r\nThe Mexican tradition, mentioned by Dr. Robertson, is an evidence, but\r\na feeble one, in favor of the one opinion. The number of languages\r\nradically different, is a strong evidence in favor of the contrary one.\r\nThere is an American by the name of Ledyard, he who was with Captain\r\nCook on his last voyage, and wrote an account of that voyage, who has\r\ngone to St. Petersburg; from thence he was to go to Kamtschatka; to\r\ncross over thence to the northwest coast of America, and to penetrate\r\nthrough the main continent, to our side of it. He is a person of\r\ningenuity and information. Unfortunately, he has too much imagination.\r\nHowever, if he escapes safely, he will give us new, curious, and useful\r\ninformation. I had a letter from him, dated last March, when he was\r\nabout to leave St. Petersburg on his way to Kamtschatka.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inclination of the strata of rocks, I had observed\r\nthem between the Blue Ridge and North Mountains in Virginia, to be\r\nparallel with the pole of the earth. I observed the same thing in most\r\ninstances in the Alps, between Cette and Turin: but in returning along\r\nthe precipices of the Apennines, where they hang over the Mediterranean,\r\ntheir direction was totally different and various: and you mention, that\r\nin our western country, they are horizontal. This variety proves they\r\nhave not been formed by subsidence, as some writers of theories of the\r\nearth have pretended; for then they should always have been in circular\r\nstrata, and concentric. It proves, too, that they have not been formed\r\nby the rotation of the earth on its axis, as might have been suspected,\r\nhad all these strata been parallel with that axis. They may, indeed,\r\nhave been thrown up by explosions, as Whitehurst supposes, or have been\r\nthe effect of convulsions. But there can be no proof of the explosion,\r\nnor is it probable that convulsions have deformed every spot of the\r\nearth. It is now generally agreed that rock grows, and it seems that it\r\ngrows in layers in every direction, as the branches of trees grow in\r\nall directions. Why seek further the solution of this phenomenon? Every\r\nthing in nature decays. If it were not reproduced then by growth, there\r\nwould be a chasm.\r\n\r\nI remember you asked me in a former letter, whether the steam-mill\r\nin London was turned by the steam immediately, or by the intermediate\r\nagency of water raised by the steam. When I was in London, Boulton\r\nmade a secret of his mill. Therefore, I was permitted to see it only\r\nsuperficially. I saw no water-wheels, and therefore supposed none.\r\nI answered you, accordingly, that there were none. But when I was at\r\nNismes, I went to see the steam-mill there, and they showed it to me in\r\nall its parts. I saw that their steam raised water, and that this\r\nwater turned a wheel. I expressed my doubts of the necessity of the\r\ninter-agency of water, and that the London mill was without it. But they\r\nsupposed me mistaken; perhaps I was so: I have had no opportunity since\r\nof clearing up the doubt.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI had a letter from Mr. Churchman, but not developing his plan of\r\nknowing the longitude, fully. I wrote him what was doubted about it, so\r\nfar as we could conjecture what it was.\r\n\r\nI am with very great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIV.--TO JOHN JAY, September 22,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 22,1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe letters of which the inclosed are copies, are this moment received,\r\nand as there is a possibility that they may reach Havre before the\r\npacket sails, I have the honor of enclosing them to you. They contain a\r\npromise of reducing the duties on tar, pitch, and turpentine, and that\r\nthe government will interest itself with the city of Rouen, to reduce\r\nthe local duty on potash. By this you will perceive, that we are getting\r\non a little in this business, though under their present embarrassments,\r\nit is difficult to procure the attention of the ministers to it. The\r\nparliament has enregistered the edict for a rigorous levy of the _deux\r\nvingtièmes_. As this was proposed by the King in lieu of the _impôt\r\nterritorial_, there is no doubt now, that the latter, with the stamp\r\ntax, will be immediately repealed. There can be no better proof of the\r\nrevolution in the public opinion, as to the powers of the monarch,\r\nand of the force, too, of that opinion. Six weeks ago, we saw the King\r\ndisplaying the plenitude of his omnipotence, as hitherto conceived, to\r\nenforce these two acts. At this day, he is forced to retract them by the\r\npublic voice; for as to the opposition of the parliamemt, that body is\r\ntoo little esteemed to produce this effect in any case, where the public\r\ndo not throw themselves into the same scale.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCV.--TO JOHN JAY, September 22, 1787\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWhen I had the honor of addressing you this morning, intelligence\r\nwas handing about, which I did not think well enough authenticated to\r\ncommunicate to you. As it is now ascertained, I avail myself of the\r\nchance that another post may yet reach Havre, before the departure of\r\nthe packet. This will depend on the wind, which has for some days\r\nbeen unfavorable. I must premise that this court, about ten days\r\nago, declared, by their _Chargé des Affaires_ in Holland, that if\r\nthe Prussian troops continued to menace Holland with an invasion, his\r\nMajesty was determined, in quality of ally, to succor that province. An\r\nofficial letter from the Hague, of the 18th instant, assures that the\r\nPrussian army entered the territory of Holland on the 15th, that most\r\nof the principal towns had submitted, some after firing a gun or two,\r\nothers without resistance: that the Rhingrave de Salm had evacuated\r\nUtrecht, with part of the troops under his command, leaving behind him\r\none hundred and forty-four pieces of cannon, with great warlike stores:\r\nthat the standard of Orange was hoisted every where: that no other\r\ncockade could be worn at the Hague: that the States General were to\r\nassemble that night for reinstating the Stadtholder in all his rights.\r\nThe letter concludes, ‘We have this moment intelligence that Woerden\r\nhas capitulated; so that Amsterdam remains without defence.’ So far the\r\nletter. We know, otherwise, that Monsieur de St. Priest, who had set\r\nout on his embassy to the Hague, has stopped at Antwerp, not choosing\r\nto proceed further till new orders. This Court has been completely\r\ndeceived, first by its own great desire to avoid a war, and secondly by\r\ncalculating that the King of Prussia would have acted on principles\r\nof common sense, which would surely have dictated, that a power, lying\r\nbetween the jaws of Russia and Austria, should not separate itself from\r\nFrance, unless, indeed, he had assurances of dispositions in those\r\ntwo powers, which are not supposed to exist. On the contrary, I am\r\npersuaded that they ask the alliance of France, whom we suppose to\r\nbe under hesitations between her reluctance to abandon the Turks, her\r\njealousy of increasing by their spoils the power of the two empires, and\r\nher inability to oppose them. If they cannot obtain her alliance, they\r\nwill surely join themselves to England and Prussia.\r\n\r\nOfficial advices are received, that the first division of the Russian\r\narmy has passed the Borysthenes into the Polish Ukraine, and is marching\r\ntowards the frontiers of Turkey. Thus, we may consider the flames of\r\nwar as completely kindled in two distinct parts of this quarter of\r\nthe globe, and that though France and England have not yet engaged\r\nthemselves in it, the probabilities are that they will do it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVI.--TO MR. CARNES, September 22, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARNES.\r\n\r\nParis, September 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am honored by your favor of the 17th instant. A war between France and\r\nEngland does not necessarily engage America in it; and I think she\r\nwill be disposed rather to avail herself of the advantages of a neutral\r\npower. By the former usage of nations, the goods of a friend were safe,\r\nthough taken in an enemy bottom, and those of an enemy were lawful\r\nprize, though found in a free bottom. But in our treaties with France,\r\n&c. we have established the simpler rule, that a free bottom makes free\r\ngoods, and an enemy bottom, enemy goods. The same rule has been adopted\r\nby the treaty of armed neutrality between Russia, Sweden, Denmark,\r\nHolland, and Portugal, and assented to by France and Spain. Contraband\r\ngoods, however, are always excepted, so that they may still be\r\nseized; but the same powers have established that naval stores are not\r\ncontraband: and this may be considered now as the law of nations. Though\r\nEngland acquiesced under this during the late war, rather than draw on\r\nherself the neutral powers, yet she never acceded to the new principle,\r\nand her obstinacy on this point is what has prevented the late renewal\r\nof her treaty with Russia. On the commencement of a new war, this\r\nprinciple will probably be insisted on by the neutral powers, whom we\r\nmay suppose to be Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, America, and perhaps Spain.\r\n_Quere_; if England will again acquiesce. Supposing these details\r\nmight be useful to you, I have taken the liberty of giving them, and\r\nof assuring you of the esteem with which I am, Sir, your very humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVII.--TO JOHN JAY, September 24, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 24, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe times are now so critical, that every day brings something new\r\nand important, not known the day before. Observing the wind still\r\nunfavorable, I am in hopes the packet may not sail to-morrow, and that\r\nthis letter may be at Havre in time for that conveyance. Mr. Eden has\r\nwaited on Count Montmorin to inform him, officially, that England must\r\nconsider its convention with France, relative to the giving notice of\r\nits naval armaments, as at an end, and that they are arming generally.\r\nThis is considered here as a declaration of war. The Dutch ambassador\r\ntold me yesterday, that he supposed the Prussian troops probably in\r\npossession of the Hague. I asked him if it would interrupt the course of\r\nbusiness, commercial or banking, in Amsterdam; and particularly, whether\r\nour depot of money there was safe. He said, the people of Amsterdam\r\nwould be surely so wise as to submit, when they should see that they\r\ncould not oppose the Stadtholder: therefore he supposed our depot safe,\r\nand that there would be no interruption of business. It is the hour of\r\nthe departure of the post: so I have only time to add assurances of the\r\nrespect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVIII,--TO JOHN ADAMS, September 28, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, September 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received your favor by Mr. Cutting, and thank you sincerely for the\r\ncopy of your book. The departure of a packet-boat, which always gives me\r\nfull employment for some time before, has only permitted me to look into\r\nit a little. I judge of it from the first volume, which I thought formed\r\nto do a great deal of good. The first principle of a good government,\r\nis certainly a distribution of its powers into executive, judiciary, and\r\nlegislative, and a subdivision of the latter into two or three\r\nbranches. It is a good step gained, when it is proved that the English\r\nconstitution, acknowledged to be better than all which have preceded\r\nit, is only better, in proportion as it has approached nearer to this\r\ndistribution of powers. From this, the last step is easy, to show by\r\na comparison of our constitutions with that of England, how much more\r\nperfect they are. The article of Confederations is certainly worthy of\r\nyour pen. It would form a most interesting addition, to show, what has\r\nbeen the nature of the Confederations which have existed hitherto, what\r\nwere their excellencies, and what their defects.\r\n\r\nA comparison of ours with them would be to the advantage of ours,\r\nand would increase the veneration of our countrymen for it. It is\r\na misfortune, that they do not sufficiently know the value of their\r\nconstitutions, and how much happier they are rendered by them, than any\r\nother people on earth, by the governments under which they live.\r\n\r\nYou know all that has happened in the United Netherlands. You know\r\nalso that our friends, Van Staphorsts, will be among the most likely to\r\nbecome objects of severity, if any severities should be exercised. Is\r\nthe money in their hands entirely safe? If it is not, I am sure you have\r\nalready thought of it. Are we to suppose the game already up, and that\r\nthe Stadtholder is to be reestablished, perhaps erected into a monarch,\r\nwithout the country lifting a finger in opposition to it? If so, it is a\r\nlesson the more for us. In fact, what a crowd of lessons do the present\r\nmiseries of Holland teach us? Never to have an hereditary officer of any\r\nsort: never to let a citizen ally himself with kings: never to call in\r\nforeign nations to settle domestic differences: never to suppose that\r\nany nation will expose itself to war for us, &c. Still I am not without\r\nhopes, that a good rod is in soak for Prussia, and that England will\r\nfeel the end of it. It is known to some, that Russia made propositions\r\nto the Emperor and France, for acting in concert; that the Emperor\r\nconsents, and has disposed four camps of one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand men, from the limits of Turkey to those of Prussia. This court\r\nhesitates, or rather its Premier hesitates; for the Queen, Montmorin,\r\nand Breteuil are for the measure. Should it take place, all may yet come\r\nto rights, except for the Turks, who must retire from Europe, and this\r\nthey must do, were France Quixotic enough to undertake to support them.\r\nWe, I hope, shall be left free to avail ourselves of the advantages of\r\nneutrality: and yet, much I fear, the English, or rather their stupid\r\nKing, will force us out of it. For thus I reason. By forcing us into the\r\nwar against them, they will be engaged in an expensive land war, as well\r\nas a sea war. Common sense dictates, therefore, that they should let\r\nus remain neuter: ergo, they will not let us remain neuter. I never yet\r\nfound any other general rule for foretelling what they will do, but that\r\nof examining what they ought not to do.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with my best respects to Mrs. Adams, and\r\nsentiments of perfect esteem and regard to yourself, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIX.--TO COLONEL SMITH, September 28,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL SMITH.\r\n\r\nParis, September 28,1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor by Mr. Cutting. I had before had a\r\ntransient acquaintance with him, and knew him to be sensible. Your\r\nrecommendation is always a new merit. I really think, and had taken the\r\nliberty some time ago of hinting to Congress, that they would do well\r\nto have a diplomatic character at Lisbon. There is no country whose\r\ncommerce is more interesting to us. I wish Congress would correspond\r\nto the wishes of that court, in sending a person there, and to mine,\r\nin sending yourself. For I confess, I had rather see you there than at\r\nLondon, because I doubt whether it be honorable for us to keep any body\r\nat London, unless they keep some person at New York. Of all nations on\r\nearth, they require to be treated with the most hauteur. They require to\r\nbe kicked into common good manners. You ask, if you shall say any thing\r\nto Sullivan about the bill. No. Only that it is paid. I have, within\r\nthese two or three days, received letters from him explaining the\r\nmatter. It was really for the skin and bones of the moose, as I had\r\nconjectured. It was my fault, that I had not given him a rough idea\r\nof the expense I would be willing to incur for them. He had made the\r\nacquisition an object of a regular campaign, and that too of a winter\r\none. The troops he employed sallied forth, as he writes me, in the month\r\nof March--much snow--a herd attacked--one killed--in the wilderness--a\r\nroad to cut twenty miles--to be drawn by hand from the frontiers to his\r\nhouse--bones to be cleaned, &c. &c. &c. In fine, he put himself to\r\nan infinitude of trouble, more than I meant: he did it cheerfully, and I\r\nfeel myself really under obligations to him. That the tragedy might not\r\nwant a proper catastrophe, the box, bones, and all are lost: so that\r\nthis chapter of Natural History will still remain a blank. But I have\r\nwritten to him not to send me another. I will leave it for my successor\r\nto fill up, whenever I shall make my bow here. The purchase for Mrs.\r\nAdams shall be made, and sent by Mr. Cutting. I shall always be happy\r\nto receive her commands. Petit shall be made happy by her praises of his\r\nlast purchase for her. I must refer you to Mr. Adams for the news. Those\r\nrespecting the Dutch you know as well as I. Nor should they be written\r\nbut with the pen of Jeremiah. Adieu, mon ami! Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER C.--TO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE BUFFON, October 3, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE BUFFON.\r\n\r\nParis, October 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of informing you, some time ago, that I had written to\r\nsome of my friends in America, desiring they would send me such of the\r\nspoils of the moose, caribou, elk, and deer, as might throw light on\r\nthat class of animals; but more particularly, to send me the complete\r\nskeleton, skin, and horns of the moose, in such condition as that the\r\nskin might be sewed up and stuffed, on its arrival here. I am happy to\r\nbe able to present to you at this moment, the bones and skin of a moose,\r\nthe horns of another individual of the same species, the horns of the\r\ncaribou, the elk, the deer, the spiked-horned buck, and the roebuck of\r\nAmerica. They all come from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and were\r\nreceived by me yesterday. I give you their popular names, as it rests\r\nwith yourself to decide their real names. The skin of the moose was\r\ndressed with the hair on, but a great deal of it has come off, and the\r\nrest is ready to drop off. The horns of the elk are remarkably small. I\r\nhave certainly seen some of them, which would have weighed five or six\r\ntimes as much. This is the animal which we call elk in the southern\r\nparts of America, and of which I have given some description in the\r\nNotes on Virginia, of which I had the honor of presenting you a copy. I\r\nreally doubt, whether the flat-horned elk exists in America: and I think\r\nthis may be properly classed with the elk, the principal difference\r\nbeing in the horns. I have seen the _daim_, the _cerf_, the _chevreuil_,\r\nof Europe. But the animal we call elk, and which may be distinguished as\r\nthe round-horned elk, is very different from them. I have never seen the\r\n_brand-hirtz_ or _cerf d’Ardennes_, nor the European elk. Could I get\r\na sight of them, I think I should be able to say which of them the\r\nAmerican elk resembles most, as I am tolerably well acquainted with\r\nthat animal. I must observe, also, that the horns of the deer, which\r\naccompany these spoils, are not of the fifth or sixth part of the weight\r\nof some that I have seen. This individual has been of three years\r\nof age, according to our method of judging. I have taken measures,\r\nparticularly, to be furnished with large horns of our elk and our deer,\r\nand therefore beg of you not to consider those now sent, as furnishing a\r\nspecimen of their ordinary size. I really suspect you will find that\r\nthe moose, the round-horned elk, and the American deer are species not\r\nexisting in Europe. The moose is, perhaps, of a new class. I wish these\r\nspoils, Sir, may have the merit of adding any thing new to the treasures\r\nof nature, which have so fortunately come under your observation, and\r\nof which she seems to have given you the key: they will in that case\r\nbe some gratification to you, which it will always be pleasing to me\r\nto have procured; having the honor to be, with sentiments of the most\r\nperfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CI.--TO MR. DUMAS, October 4,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nParis, October 4,1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received your favor of the 23rd of September two days ago. That of the\r\n28th and 29th was put in my hands this morning. I immediately waited on\r\nthe ambassadors, ordinary and extraordinary, of the United Netherlands,\r\nand also on the envoy of Prussia, and asked their good offices to have\r\nan efficacious protection extended to your person, your family, and your\r\neffects, observing, that the United States know no party, but are the\r\nfriends and allies of the United Netherlands as a nation, and would\r\nexpect from their friendship, that the person who is charged with their\r\naffairs, until the arrival of a minister, should be covered from all\r\ninsult and injury, which might be offered him by a lawless mob; well\r\nassured that their minister, residing with Congress, would on all\r\noccasions receive the same. They have been so good as to promise me,\r\neach, that he will in his first despatches press this matter on the\r\nproper power, and give me reason to hope that it will be efficacious\r\nfor your safety. I will transmit your letter to Mr. Jay by the Count\r\nde Moustier, who sets out within a week for New York, as Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary for France, in that country. I sincerely sympathize in\r\nyour sufferings, and wish that what I have done may effect an end to\r\nthem; being with much respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CII.--TO JOHN JAY, October 8, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing you on the 19th of September, twice on the\r\n22nd, and again on the 24th. The two first went by the packet, the\r\nthird by a vessel bound to Philadelphia. I have not yet learned by what\r\noccasion the last went. In these several letters, I communicated to\r\nyou the occurrences of Europe, as far as they were then known.\r\nNotwithstanding the advantage which the Emperor seemed to have gained\r\nover his subjects of Brabant, by the military arrangements he had been\r\npermitted to make under false pretexts, he has not obtained his ends. He\r\ncertainly wished to enforce his new regulations; but he wished more to\r\nbe cleared of all domestic difficulties, that he might be free to act\r\nin the great scenes which are preparing for the theatre of Europe.\r\nHe seems, therefore, to have instructed his Governor General of the\r\nNetherlands to insist on compliance as far as could be insisted, without\r\nproducing resistance by arms; but at the same time, to have furnished\r\nhim with a sufficiently complete recantation, to prevent the effects of\r\ninsurrection. The Governor pressed; the people were firm; a small act of\r\nforce was then attempted, which produced a decided resistance, in which\r\nthe people killed several of the military: the last resource was\r\nthen used, which was the act of recantation; this produced immediate\r\ntranquillity, and every thing there is now finally settled, by the\r\nEmperor’s relinquishment of his plans.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the evening of September the 22nd informed you that the\r\nPrussian troops had entered Holland, and that of the 24th, that England\r\nhad announced to this court that she was arming generally. These two\r\nevents being simultaneous, proved that the two sovereigns acted in\r\nconcert. Immediately after, the court of London announced to the other\r\ncourts of Europe, that if France entered Holland with armed force, she\r\nwould consider it as an act of hostility, and declare war against her;\r\nsending Mr. Grenville here, at the same time, to make what she called a\r\nconciliatory proposition. This proposition was received as a new insult,\r\nMr. Grenville very coolly treated, and he has now gone back. It is said,\r\nhe has carried the ultimatum of France. What it is, particularly, has\r\nnot transpired; it is only supposed, in general, to be very firm. You\r\nwill see, in one of the Leyden gazettes, one of the letters written by\r\nthe ministers of England to the courts of their respective residence,\r\ncommunicating the declaration before mentioned. In the mean time,\r\nHolland has been sooner reduced by the Prussian troops, than could have\r\nbeen expected. The abandonment of Utrecht by the Rhingrave of Salm,\r\nseems to have thrown the people under a general panic, during which\r\nevery place submitted, except Amsterdam. That had opened conferences\r\nwith the Duke of Brunswick; but as late as the 2nd instant, no\r\ncapitulation was yet concluded. The King of Prussia, on his first move,\r\ndemanded categorically of the King of Poland, what part he intended to\r\nact in the event of war. The latter answered, he should act as events\r\nshould dictate; and is, in consequence of this species of menace from\r\nPrussia, arming himself. He can bring into the field about seventy\r\nthousand good cavalry. In the mean time, though nothing transpires\r\npublicly of the confederation between France and the two empires,\r\nmentioned in my letter of September the 19th, it is not the less sure\r\nthat it is on the carpet, and will take place. To the circumstances\r\nbefore mentioned, may be added, as further indications of war, the\r\nnaming as Generalissimo of their marine on the Atlantic, Monsieur de\r\nSuffrein, on the Mediterranean, Monsieur Albert de Rioms, the recalling\r\nMonsieur de St. Priest, their ambassador, from Antwerp, before he had\r\nreached the Hague, and the activity of their armies by sea. On the other\r\nhand, the little movement by land would make one suppose they expected\r\nto put the King of Prussia into other hands. They too, like the\r\nEmperor, are arranging matters at home. The rigorous levy of the _deux\r\nvingtiemes_ is enregistered, the stamp act and _impot territorial_ are\r\nrevoked, the parliament recalled, the nation soothed by these acts, and\r\ninspired by the insults of the British court. The part of the Council\r\nstill leaning towards peace are become unpopular, and perhaps may feel\r\nthe effects of it. No change in the administration has taken place since\r\nmy last, unless we may consider as such, Monsieur Cabarrus’s refusal\r\nto stand in the lines. Thinking he should be forced to follow, too\r\nseriously, plans formed by others, he has declined serving.\r\n\r\nShould this war take place, as is quite probable, and should it be as\r\ngeneral as it threatens to be, our neutrality must be attended with\r\ngreat advantages. Whether of a nature to improve our morals or our\r\nhappiness, is another question. But is it sure that Great Britain, by\r\nher searches, her seizures, and other measures for harassing us, will\r\npermit us to preserve our neutrality? I know it may be argued, that the\r\nland-war, which she would superadd to her sea-war, by provoking us to\r\njoin her enemies, should rationally hold her to her good behavior with\r\nus. But since the accession of the present monarch, has it not been\r\npassion, and not reason, which, nine times out of ten, has dictated her\r\nmeasures? Has there been a better rule of prognosticating what he\r\nwould do, than to examine what he ought not to do? When I review\r\nhis dispositions and review his conduct, I have little hope of his\r\npermitting our neutrality. He will find subjects of provocation in\r\nvarious articles of our treaty with France, which will now come into\r\nview, in all their consequences, and in consequences very advantageous\r\nto the one, and injurious to the other country. I suggest these doubts,\r\non a supposition that our magazines are not prepared for war, and in the\r\nopinion that provisions for that event should be thought of.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter from Mr. Dumas came to me open, though directed\r\nto you. I immediately waited on the ambassadors, ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, of Holland, and the envoy of Prussia, and prayed them\r\nto interest themselves to have his person, his family, and his\r\ngoods protected. They promised me readily to do it, and have written\r\naccordingly; I trust it will be with effect. I could not avoid enclosing\r\nyou the letter from Monsieur Bouebe, though I have satisfied him he is\r\nto expect nothing from Congress for his inventions. These are better\r\ncertified than most of those things are; but if time stamps their worth,\r\ntime will give them to us. He expects no further answer. The gazettes of\r\nLeyden and France to this date accompany this, which will be delivered\r\nyou by the Count de Moustier, Minister Plenipotentiary from this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, October 8, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe bearer hereof, the Count de Moustier, successor to Monsieur de la\r\nLuzerne, would, from his office, need no letter of introduction to you\r\nor to any body. Yet I take the liberty of recommending him to you, to\r\nshorten those formal approaches, which the same office would otherwise\r\nexpose him to, in making your acquaintance. He is a great enemy to\r\nformality, etiquette, ostentation, and luxury. He goes with the best\r\ndispositions to cultivate society, without poisoning it by ill example.\r\nHe is sensible, disposed to view things favorably, and being well\r\nacquainted with the constitution of England, her manners, and language,\r\nis the better prepared for his station with us. But I should have\r\nperformed only the lesser, and least pleasing half of my task, were\r\nI not to add my recommendations of Madame de Brehan. She is goodness\r\nitself. You must be well acquainted with her. You will find her well\r\ndisposed to meet your acquaintance, and well worthy of it. The way to\r\nplease her, is to receive her as an acquaintance of a thousand years’\r\nstanding. She speaks little English. You must teach her more, and learn\r\nFrench from her. She hopes, by accompanying Monsieur de Moustier, to\r\nimprove her health, which is very feeble, and still more, to improve\r\nher son in his education, and to remove him to a distance from the\r\nseductions of this country. You will wonder to be told, that there are\r\nno schools in this country to be compared to ours in the sciences. The\r\nhusband of Madame de Brehan is an officer, and obliged by the times to\r\nremain with the army. Monsieur de Moustier brings your watch. I have\r\nworn it two months, and really find it a most incomparable one. It will\r\nnot want the little re-dressing, which new watches generally do, after\r\ngoing about a year. It costs six hundred livres. To open it in all its\r\nparts, press the little pin on the edge with the point of your nail;\r\nthat opens the crystal; then open the dial-plate in the usual way; then\r\npress the stem, at the end within the loop, and it opens the back for\r\nwinding up or regulating.\r\n\r\nDe Moustier is remarkably communicative. With adroitness he may\r\nbe pumped of any thing. His openness is from character, not from\r\naffectation. An intimacy with him may, on this account, be politically\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nI am, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIV.--TO JOHN JAY, October 8, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n(Private.) Paris, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe Count de Moustier, Minister Plenipotentiary from the court of\r\nVersailles to the United States, will have the honor of delivering you\r\nthis. The connection of your offices will necessarily connect you in\r\nacquaintance; but I beg leave to present him to you, on account of\r\nhis personal as well as his public character. You will find him open,\r\ncommunicative, candid, simple in his manners, and a declared enemy to\r\nostentation and luxury. He goes with a resolution to add no aliment\r\nto it by his example, unless he finds that the dispositions of our\r\ncountrymen require it indispensably. Permit me, at the same time, to\r\nsolicit your friendly notice, and through you, that also of Mrs. Jay, to\r\nMadame la Marquise de Brehan, sister-in-law to Monsieur de Moustier. She\r\naccompanies him, in hopes that a change of climate may assist her feeble\r\nhealth, and also, that she may procure a more valuable education for\r\nher son, and safer from seduction, in America than in France. I think\r\nit impossible to find a better woman, more amiable, more modest, more\r\nsimple in her manners, dress, and way of thinking. She will deserve the\r\nfriendship of Mrs. Jay, and the way to obtain hers, is to receive her\r\nand treat her without the shadow of etiquette.\r\n\r\nThe Count d’Aranda leaves us in a day or two. He desired me to recall\r\nhim to your recollection, and to assure you of his friendship. In a\r\nletter which I mean as a private one, I may venture details too minute\r\nfor a public one, yet not unamusing, or unsatisfactory. I may venture\r\nnames too, without the danger of their getting into a newspaper. There\r\nhas long been a division in the Council here, on the question of war\r\nand peace. Monsieur de Montmorin and Monsieur de Breteuil have been\r\nconstantly for war. They are supported in this by the Queen. The King\r\ngoes for nothing. He hunts one half the day, is drunk the other, and\r\nsigns whatever he is bid. The Archbishop of Toulouse desires peace.\r\nThough brought in by the Queen, he is opposed to her in this capital\r\nobject, which would produce an alliance with her brother. Whether the\r\nArchbishop will yield or not, I know not. But an intrigue is already\r\nbegun for ousting him from his place, and it is rather probable it will\r\nsucceed. He is a good and patriotic minister for peace, and very capable\r\nin the department of finance. At least he is so in theory. I have heard\r\nhis talents for execution censured.\r\n\r\nCan I be useful here to Mrs. Jay or yourself, in executing any\r\ncommissions, great or small? I offer you my services with great\r\ncordiality. You know whether any of the wines of this country may\r\nattract your wishes. In my tour, last spring, I visited the best\r\nvineyards of Burgundy, Cote-rotie, Hermitage, Lunelle, Frontignan, and\r\nwhite and red Bordeaux, got acquainted with the proprietors, and can\r\nprocure for you the best crops from the vigneron himself. Mrs. Jay knows\r\nif there is any thing else here, in which I could be useful to her.\r\nCommand me without ceremony, as it will give me real pleasure to serve\r\nyou; and be assured of the sincere attachment and friendship, with which\r\nI am, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CV.--TO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE MOUSTIER, October 9,1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\nParis, October 9,1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson has the honor of presenting his respects to Monsieur le\r\nComte de Moustier, and of taking leave of him by letter, which he is\r\nprevented doing in person, by an unexpected visit to Versailles to-day.\r\nHe will hope to have the pleasure of sometimes hearing from him, and\r\nwill take the liberty occasionally, of troubling him with a letter.\r\nHe considers the Count de Moustier as forming with himself the two end\r\nlinks of that chain which holds the two nations together, and is happy\r\nto have observed in him dispositions to strengthen rather than to\r\nweaken it. It is a station of importance, as on the cherishing good\r\ndispositions and quieting bad ones, will depend in some degree the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of the two countries. The Count de Moustier\r\nwill find the affections of the Americans with France, but their habits\r\nwith England. Chained to that country by circumstances, embracing what\r\nthey loathe, they realize the fable of the living and the dead bound\r\ntogether. Mr. Jefferson troubles the Count de Moustier with two letters,\r\nto gentlemen whom he wishes to recommend to his particular acquaintance,\r\nand to that of Madame de Brehan. He bids Monsieur de Moustier a most\r\nfriendly adieu, and wishes him every thing which may render agreeable\r\nhis passage across the water, and his residence beyond it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVI.--TO MADAME DE BREHAN, October 9, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE BREHAN.\r\n\r\nParis, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nPersuaded, Madam, that visits at this moment must be troublesome I beg\r\nyou to accept my adieus, in this form. Be assured, that no one mingles\r\nwith them more regret at separating from you. I will ask your permission\r\nto inquire of you by letter sometimes, how our country agrees with your\r\nhealth and your expectations, and will hope to hear it from yourself.\r\nThe imitation of European manners, which you will find in our towns,\r\nwill, I fear, be little pleasing. I beseech you to practise still your\r\nown, which will furnish them a model of what is perfect. Should you be\r\nsingular, it will be by excellence, and after a while you will see the\r\neffect of your example.\r\n\r\nHeaven bless you, Madam, and guard you under all circumstances; give you\r\nsmooth waters, gentle breezes, and clear skies, hushing all its elements\r\ninto peace, and leading with its own hand the favored bark, till it\r\nshall have safely landed its precious charge on the shores of our new\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVII.--TO MR. DUMAS, October 14, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nParis, October 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favors of October the 23rd and 26th. With\r\nrespect to the mission you suggest, in the former, no powers are lodged\r\nin the hands of Mr. Adams and myself. Congress commissioned Mr. Adams,\r\nDoctor Franklin, and myself, to treat with the Emperor on the subjects\r\nof amity and commerce: at the same time, they gave us the commission to\r\nPrussia, with which you are acquainted. We proposed treating through the\r\nImperial ambassador here. It was declined on their part, and our powers\r\nexpired, having been given but for two years. Afterwards, the same\r\nambassador here was instructed to offer to treat with us. I informed\r\nhim our powers were expired, but that I would write to Congress on the\r\nsubject. I did so, but have never yet received an answer. Whether this\r\nproceeds from a change of opinion in them, or from the multiplicity\r\nof their occupations, I am unable to say: but this state of facts will\r\nenable you to see that we have no powers, in this instance, to take the\r\nmeasures you had thought of. I sincerely sympathize with you in your\r\nsufferings. Though forbidden by my character to meddle in the internal\r\naffairs of an allied State, it is the wish of my heart that their\r\ntroubles may have such an issue, as will secure the greatest degree\r\nof happiness to the body of the people: for it is with the mass of the\r\nnation we are allied, and not merely with their governors. To inform\r\nthe minds of the people, and to follow their will, is the chief duty of\r\nthose placed at their head. What party in your late struggles was most\r\nlikely to do this, you are more competent to judge than I am. Under\r\nevery event, that you maybe safe and happy, is the sincere wish of him,\r\nwho has the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVIII.--TO MADAME DE CORNY, October 18, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nI now have the honor, Madam, to send you the Memoire of M. de Calonne.\r\nDo not injure yourself by hurrying its perusal. Only, when you shall\r\nhave read it at your ease, be so good as to send it back, that it may be\r\nreturned to the Duke of Dorset. You will read it with pleasure. It has\r\ncarried comfort to my heart, because it must do the same to the King and\r\nthe nation. Though it does not prove M. de Calonne to be more innocent\r\nthan his predecessors, it shows him not to have been that exaggerated\r\nscoundrel, which the calculations and the clamors of the public\r\nhave supposed. It shows that the public treasures have not been so\r\ninconceivably squandered, as the parliaments of Grenoble, Toulouse, &c.\r\nhad affirmed. In fine, it shows him less wicked, and France less badly\r\ngoverned, than I had feared. In examining my little collection of books,\r\nto see what it could furnish you on the subject of Poland, I find a\r\nsmall piece which may serve as a supplement to the history I had sent\r\nyou. It contains a mixture of history and politics, which I think you\r\nwill like--How do you do this morning? I have feared you exerted and\r\nexposed yourself too much yesterday. I ask you the question, though I\r\nshall not await its answer. The sky is clearing, and I shall away to my\r\nhermitage. God bless you, my Dear Madam, now and always. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIX.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, October 23, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nParis, October 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of troubling your Excellency on the subject of the\r\n_Arrêt_, which has lately appeared, for prohibiting the importation\r\nof whale-oils and spermaceti, the produce of foreign fisheries. This\r\nprohibition, being expressed in general terms, seems to exclude the\r\nwhale-oils of the United States of America, as well as of the nations\r\nof Europe. The uniform disposition, however, which his Majesty and his\r\nministers have shown to promote the commerce between France and the\r\nUnited States, by encouraging our productions to come hither, and\r\nparticularly those of our fisheries, induces me to hope, that these were\r\nnot within their view, at the passing of this _Arrêt_. I am led the more\r\ninto this opinion, when I recollect the assiduity exercised for several\r\nmonths, in the year 1785, by the committee appointed by government to\r\ninvestigate the objects of commerce of the two countries, and to report\r\nthe encouragements of which it was susceptible; the result of that\r\ninvestigation, which his Majesty’s Comptroller General did me the\r\nhonor to communicate, in a letter of the 22nd of October, 1786, stating\r\ntherein the principles which should be established for the future\r\nregulation of that commerce, and particularly distinguishing the article\r\nof whale-oils by an abatement of the duties on them for the present,\r\nand a promise of farther abatement after the year 1790; the thorough\r\nre-investigation with which Monsieur de Lambert honored this subject\r\nwhen the letter of 1786 was to be put into the form of an _Arrêt_; that\r\n_Arrêt_ itself, bearing date the 29th of December last, which ultimately\r\nconfirmed the abatements of duty present and future, and declared\r\nthat his Majesty reserved to himself to grant other favors to that\r\nproduction, if, on further information, he should find it for the\r\ninterest of the two nations; and finally, the letter in which Monsieur\r\nde Lambert did me the honor to enclose the _Arrêt_, and to assure me,\r\nthat the duties which had been levied on our whale-oils, contrary to the\r\nintention of the letter of 1786, should be restored. On a review, then,\r\nof all these circumstances, I cannot but presume, that it has not\r\nbeen intended to reverse, in a moment, views so maturely digested, and\r\nuniformly pursued; and that the general expressions of the _Arrêt_ of\r\nSeptember the 28th had within their contemplation the nations of Europe\r\nonly. This presumption is further strengthened by having observed, that\r\nin the treaties of commerce, made since the epoch of our independence,\r\nthe _jura gentis amicissimcæ_ conceded to other nations, are expressly\r\nrestrained to those of the ‘most favored European nation’: his Majesty\r\nwisely foreseeing that it would be expedient to regulate the commerce of\r\na nation, which brings nothing but raw materials to employ the industry\r\nof his subjects, very differently from that of the European nations,\r\nwho bring mostly what has already passed through all the stages of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nOn these circumstances, I take the liberty of asking information from\r\nyour Excellency, as to the extent of the late _Arrêt_: and if I have not\r\nbeen mistaken in supposing it did not mean to abridge that of December\r\nthe 29th, I would solicit an explanatory _Arrêt_, to prevent the\r\nmisconstruction of it, which will otherwise take place. It is much to be\r\ndesired too, that this explanation could be given as soon as possible,\r\nin order that it may be handed out with the _Arrêt_ of September the\r\n28th. Great alarm may otherwise be spread among the merchants, and\r\nadventurers in the fisheries, who, confiding in the stability of\r\nregulations, which his Majesty’s wisdom had so long and well matured,\r\nhave embarked their fortunes in speculations in this branch of business.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject to one of the principal members of our\r\nUnion, induces me to attend with great anxiety the re-assurance from\r\nyour Excellency, that no change has taken place in his Majesty’s views\r\non this subject; and that his dispositions to multiply, rather than\r\ndiminish, the combinations of interest between the two people, continue\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\nCommerce is slow in changing its channel. That between this country\r\nand the United States is as yet but beginning; and this beginning has\r\nreceived some checks. The _Arrêt_ in question would be a considerable\r\none, without the explanation I have the honor to ask. I am persuaded,\r\nthat a continuation of the dispositions which have been hitherto\r\nmanifested towards us, will insure effects, political and commercial, of\r\nvalue to both nations.\r\n\r\nI have had too many proofs of the friendly interest your Excellency is\r\npleased to take in whatever may strengthen the bands and connect the\r\nviews of the two countries, to doubt your patronage of the present\r\napplication; or to pretermit any occasion of repeating assurances of\r\nthose sentiments of high respect and esteem, with which I have the honor\r\nto be\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CX.--TO JOHN JAY, November 3, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, November 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you were of the 8th and 27th of October. In the\r\nformer? I mentioned to you the declaration of this country, that they\r\nwould interpose with force, if the Prussian troops entered Holland; the\r\nentry of those troops into Holland; the declaration of England, that if\r\nFrance did oppose force, they would consider it as an act of war; the\r\nnaval armaments on both sides; the nomination of the Bailli de Suffrein\r\nas Generalissimo on the ocean; and the cold reception of Mr. Grenville\r\nhere, with his conciliatory propositions, as so many symptoms which\r\nseemed to indicate a certain and immediate rupture. It was indeed\r\nuniversally and hourly expected. But the king of Prussia, a little\r\nbefore these last events, got wind of the alliance on the carpet between\r\nFrance and the two empires: he awaked to the situation in which\r\nthat would place him: he made some application to the court of St.\r\nPetersburg, to divert the Empress from the proposed alliance, and\r\nsupplicated the court of London not to abandon him. That court had also\r\nreceived a hint of the same project; both seemed to suspect, for the\r\nfirst time, that it would be possible for France to abandon the Turks,\r\nand that they were likely to get more than they had played for at\r\nConstantinople: for they had meant nothing more there, than to divert\r\nthe Empress and Emperor from the affairs of the west, by employing them\r\nin the east, and, at the same time, to embroil them with France as\r\nthe patroness of the Turks. The court of London engaged not to\r\nabandon Prussia: but both of them relaxed a little the tone of their\r\nproceedings. The King of Prussia sent a Mr. Alvensleben here, expressly\r\nto explain and soothe: the King of England, notwithstanding the cold\r\nreception of his propositions by Grenville, renewed conferences here\r\nthrough Eden and the Duke of Dorset. The minister, in the affection of\r\nhis heart for peace, readily joined in conference, and a declaration and\r\ncounter-declaration were cooked up at Versailles, and sent to London for\r\napprobation. They were approved, arrived here at one o’clock the 27th,\r\nwere signed that night at Versailles, and on the next day, I had the\r\nhonor of enclosing them to you, under cover to the Count de Moustier,\r\nwhom I supposed still at Brest, dating my letter as of the 27th, by\r\nmistake for the 28th. Lest, however, these papers should not have got to\r\nBrest before the departure of the Count de Moustier, I now enclose you\r\nother copies. The English declaration states a notification of this\r\ncourt, in September, by Barthelemy, their minister at London, ‘that\r\nthey would send succors into Holland,’ as the first cause of England’s\r\narming; desires an explanation of the intentions of this court, as to\r\nthe affairs of Holland, and proposes to disarm; on condition, however,\r\nthat the King of France shall not retain any hostile views in any\r\nquarter, for what has been done in Holland. This last phrase was to\r\nsecure Prussia, according to promise. The King of France acknowledges\r\nthe notification by his minister at London, promises he will do nothing\r\nin consequence of it, declares he has no intention to intermeddle with\r\nforce in the affairs of Holland, and that he will entertain hostile\r\nviews in no quarter, for what has been done there. He disavows having\r\never had any intention to interpose with force in the affairs of that\r\nrepublic. This disavowal begins the sentence, which acknowledges he had\r\nnotified the contrary to the court of London, and it includes no apology\r\nto soothe the feelings which may be excited in the breasts of the\r\nPatriots of Holland, at hearing the King declare he never did intend to\r\naid them with force, when promises to do this were the basis of those\r\nvery attempts to better their constitution, which have ended in its\r\nruin, as well as their own.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed these declarations, because, being somewhat wrapped up\r\nin their expressions, their full import might escape, on a transient\r\nreading; and it is necessary it should not escape. It conveys to us the\r\nimportant lesson, that no circumstances of morality, honor, interest, or\r\nengagement, are sufficient to authorize a secure reliance on any nation,\r\nat all times, and in all positions. A moment of difficulty, or a moment\r\nof error, may render for ever useless the most friendly dispositions\r\nin the King, in the major part of his ministers, and the whole of his\r\nnation. The present pacification is considered by most, as only a short\r\ntruce. They calculate on the spirit of the nation, and not on the aged\r\nhand which guides its movements. It is certain, that from this moment\r\nthe whole system of Europe changes. Instead of counting together\r\nEngland, Austria, and Russia, as heretofore, against France, Spain,\r\nHolland, Prussia, and Turkey, the division will probably be, England,\r\nHolland, and Prussia, against France, Austria, Russia, and perhaps\r\nSpain. This last power is not sure, because the dispositions of its heir\r\napparent are not sure. But whether the present be truce or peace, it\r\nwill allow time to mature the conditions of the alliance between France\r\nand the two empires, always supposed to be on the carpet. It is thought\r\nto be obstructed by the avidity of the Emperor, who would swallow a good\r\npart of Turkey, Silesia, Bavaria, and the rights of the Germanic body.\r\nTo the two or three first articles, France might consent, receiving in\r\ngratification a well rounded portion of the Austrian Netherlands, with\r\nthe islands of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, and perhaps Lower Egypt. But\r\nall this is in embryo, uncertainly known, and counterworked by the\r\nmachinations of the courts of London and Berlin. The following solution\r\nof the British armaments is supposed in a letter of the 25th ultimo,\r\nfrom Colonel Blachden of Connecticut, now at Dunkirk, to the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette. I will cite it in his own words. “A gentleman who left\r\nLondon two days ago, and came to this place to-day, informs me that\r\nit is now generally supposed that Mr. Pitt’s great secret, which has\r\npuzzled the whole nation so long, and to accomplish which design, the\r\nwhole force of the nation is armed, is to make a vigorous effort for\r\nthe recovery of America. When I recollect the delay they have made in\r\ndelivering the forts in America, and that little more than a year ago,\r\none of the British ministry wrote to the King a letter, in which were\r\nthese remarkable words, ‘If your Majesty pleases, America may yet be\r\nyours;’ add to this, if it were possible for the present ministry in\r\nEngland to effect such a matter, they would secure their places and\r\ntheir power for a long time, and should they fail in the end, they would\r\nbe certain of holding them during the attempt, which it is in their\r\npower to prolong as much as they please, and at all events, they would\r\nboast of having endeavored the recovery of what a former ministry had\r\nabandoned, it is possible.” A similar surmise has come in a letter from\r\na person in Rotterdam to one at this place. I am satisfied that the\r\nKing of England believes the mass of our people to be tired of their\r\nindependence, and desirous of returning under his government; and that\r\nthe same opinion prevails in the ministry and nation. They have hired\r\ntheir news-writers to repeat this lie in their gazettes so long, that\r\nthey have become the dupes of it themselves. But there is no occasion\r\nto recur to this, in order to account for their arming. A more rational\r\npurpose avowed, that purpose executed, and when executed, a solemn\r\nagreement to disarm, seem to leave no doubt, that the re-establishment\r\nof the Stadtholder was their object. Yet it is possible, that having\r\nfound that this court will not make war in this moment for any ally, new\r\nviews may arise, and they may think the moment favorable for executing\r\nany purposes they may have, in our quarter. Add to this, that reason is\r\nof no aid in calculating their movements. We are, therefore, never safe\r\ntill our magazines are filled with arms. The present season of truce, or\r\npeace, should, in my opinion, be improved without a moment’s respite,\r\nto effect this essential object, and no means be omitted, by which money\r\nmay be obtained for the purpose. I say this, however, with due deference\r\nto the opinion of Congress, who are better judges of the necessity and\r\npracticability of the measure.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you, in a former letter, the application I had made to\r\nthe Dutch ambassadors and Prussian envoy, for the protection of Mr.\r\nDumas. The latter soon after received an assurance, that he was put\r\nunder the protection of the States of Holland; and the Dutch ambassador\r\ncalled on me a few days ago, to inform me, by instruction from\r\nhis constituents, ‘that the States General had received a written\r\napplication from Mr. Adams, praying their protection of Dumas: that they\r\nhad instructed their greffier, Fagel, to assure Mr. Adams, by letter,\r\nthat he was under the protection of the States of Holland; but to inform\r\nhim, at the same time, that Mr. Dumas’s conduct, out of the line of\r\nhis office, had been so extraordinary, that they would expect _de\r\nl’honnêteté de Mr. Adams_, that he would charge some other person with\r\nthe affairs of the United States, during his absence.’\r\n\r\nYour letter, of September the 8th, has been duly received. I shall pay\r\ndue attention to the instructions relative to the medals, and give any\r\naid I can, in the case of Boss’s vessel. As yet, however, my endeavors\r\nto find _Monsieur Pauly, avocat au conseil d’état, rue Coquilliere_,\r\nhave been ineffectual. There is no such person living in that street.\r\nI found a _Monsieur Pauly, avocat au parlement_, in another part of\r\nthe town; he opened the letter, but said it could not mean him. I shall\r\nadvertise in the public papers. If that fails, there will be no other\r\nchance of finding him. Mr. Warnum will do well, therefore, to send some\r\nother description by which the person may be found. Indeed some friend\r\nof the party interested should be engaged to follow up this business,\r\nas it will require constant attention, and probably a much larger sum of\r\nmoney than that named in the bill inclosed in Mr. Warnum’s letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a letter from O’Bryan to me, containing\r\ninformation from Algiers, and one from Mr. Montgomery at Alicant.\r\nThe purpose of sending you this last, is to show you how much the\r\ndifficulties of ransom are increased since the Spanish negotiations.\r\nThe Russian captives have cost about eight thousand livres apiece, on an\r\naverage. I certainly have no idea that we should give any such sum; and,\r\ntherefore, if it should be the sense of Congress to give such a price, I\r\nwould be glad to know it by instruction. My idea is, that we should not\r\nransom but on the footing of the nation which pays least, that it may be\r\nas little worth their while to go in pursuit of us, as any nation. This\r\nis cruelty to the individuals now in captivity, but kindness to the\r\nhundreds that would soon be so, were we to make it worth the while of\r\nthose pirates to go out of the Streights, in quest of us. As soon as\r\nmoney is provided, I shall put this business into train. I have taken\r\nmeasures to damp, at Algiers, all expectations of our proposing to\r\nransom, at any price. I feel the distress which this must occasion to\r\nour countrymen there, and their connections; but the object of it is\r\ntheir ultimate good, by bringing down their holders to such a price as\r\nwe ought to pay, instead of letting them remain in such expectations as\r\ncannot be gratified. The gazettes of France and Leyden accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The annexed are translations of the declaration and\r\n     counter-declaration, referred to in the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\nDECLARATION.\r\n\r\nThe events which have taken place in the republic of the United\r\nProvinces appearing no longer to leave any subject of discussion, and\r\nstill less of dispute, between the two courts, the undersigned are\r\nauthorized to ask, if it be the intention of his Most Christian Majesty\r\nto act in pursuance of the notification given, on the 16th of last\r\nmonth, by the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Most Christian Majesty,\r\nwhich, announcing his purpose of aiding Holland, has occasioned maritime\r\narmaments on the part of his Majesty, which armaments have become\r\nreciprocal.\r\n\r\nIf the court of Versailles is disposed to explain itself on this\r\nsubject, and on the conduct adopted towards the republic, in a manner\r\nconformably to the desire, evinced by each party, to preserve a good\r\nunderstanding between the two courts, it being also understood, at\r\nthe same time, that no hostile view is entertained, in any quarter,\r\nin consequence of the past; his Majesty, always eager to manifest his\r\nconcurrence in the friendly sentiments of his Most Christian Majesty,\r\nagrees forthwith that the armaments, and, in general, all preparations\r\nfor war, shall be mutually discontinued, and that the marines of the two\r\nnations shall be placed on the footing of a peace establishment, such as\r\nexisted on the first of January of the present year.\r\n\r\nSigned. Dorset Wm. Eden.\r\n\r\nAt Versailles, the 27th of October, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-DECLARATION.\r\n\r\nIt neither being, nor ever having been, the intention of his Majesty\r\nto interpose by force in the affairs of the republic of the United\r\nProvinces, the communication made to the court of London by M.\r\nBarthelemy having had no other object than to announce to that court an\r\nintention, the motives of which no longer-exist, especially since the\r\nKing of Prussia has made known his resolution, his Majesty makes no\r\ndifficulty in declaring, that he has no wish to act in pursuance of the\r\ncommunication aforesaid, and that he entertains no hostile view in any\r\nquarter, relative to what has passed in Holland.\r\n\r\nConsequently, his Majesty, desiring to concur in the sentiments of his\r\nBritannic Majesty, for the preservation of a good understanding between\r\nthe two courts, consents with pleasure to the proposition of his\r\nBritannic Majesty, that the armaments, and, in general, all preparations\r\nfor war, shall be mutually discontinued, and that the marines of the two\r\nnations shall be replaced upon the footing of the peace establishment,\r\nas it existed on the first day of January of the present year.\r\n\r\nSigned. Montmorin.\r\n\r\nAt Versailles, the 27th of October, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXI.--TO JOHN JAY, November 3, 1787\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n(Private.) Paris, November 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI shall take the liberty of confiding sometimes to a private letter,\r\nsuch details of the small history of the court or cabinet, as may be\r\nworthy of being known, and yet not proper to be publicly communicated.\r\nI doubt whether the administration is yet in a permanent form. The Count\r\nde Montmorin and Baron de Breteuil are, I believe, firm enough in their\r\nplaces. It was doubted whether they would wait for the Count de la\r\nLuzerne, if the war had taken place: but at present I suppose they will.\r\nI wish it also, because M. de Hector, his only competitor, has on some\r\noccasions shown little value for the connection with us. Lambert, the\r\nComptroller General, is thought to be very insecure. I should be sorry\r\nalso to lose him. I have worked several days with him, the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, and Monsieur du Pont (father of the young gentleman gone to\r\nAmerica with the Count de Moustier), to reduce into one _Arrêt_ whatever\r\nconcerned our commerce. I have found him a man of great judgment and\r\napplication, possessing good general principles on subjects of commerce,\r\nand friendly dispositions towards us. He passed the _Arrêt_ in a very\r\nfavorable form, but it has been opposed in the Council, and will,\r\nI fear, suffer some alteration in the article of whale-oil. That\r\nof tobacco, which was put into a separate instrument, experiences\r\ndifficulties also, which do not come from him. M. du Pont has rendered\r\nus essential services on these occasions. I wish his son could be so\r\nwell noticed, as to make a favorable report to his father; he would, I\r\nthink, be gratified by it, and his good dispositions be strengthened,\r\nand rendered further useful to us. Whether I shall be able to send you\r\nthese regulations by the present packet, will depend on their getting\r\nthrough the Council in time. The Archbishop continues well with his\r\npatroness. Her object is, a close connection with her brother. I suppose\r\nhe convinces her, that peace will furnish the best occasion of cementing\r\nthat connection.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninstructive to give you the origin and nature of\r\nhis influence with the Queen. When the Duke de Choiseul proposed the\r\nmarriage of the Dauphin with this lady, he thought it proper to send a\r\nperson to Vienna, to perfect her in the language. He asked his friend,\r\nthe Archbishop of Toulouse, to recommend to him a proper person. He\r\nrecommended a certain Abbe. The Abbe, from his first arrival at Vienna,\r\neither tutored by his patron, or prompted by gratitude, impressed on\r\nthe Queen’s mind the exalted talents and merit of the Archbishop, and\r\ncontinually represented him as the only man fit to be placed at the helm\r\nof affairs. On his return to Paris, being retained near the person of\r\nthe Queen, he kept him constantly in her view. The Archbishop was named\r\nof the _Assembly des Notables_, had occasion enough there to prove his\r\ntalents, and Count de Vergennes, his great enemy, dying opportunely, the\r\nQueen got him into place. He uses the Abbe even yet, for instilling all\r\nhis notions into her mind. That he has imposing talents and patriotic\r\ndispositions, I think is certain. Good judges think him a theorist only,\r\nlittle acquainted with the details of business, and spoiling all his\r\nplans by a bungled execution. He may perhaps undergo a severe trial. His\r\nbest actions are exciting against him a host of enemies, particularly\r\nthe reduction of the pensions, and reforms in other branches of economy.\r\nSome think the other ministers are willing he should stay in, till he\r\nhas effected this odious, yet necessary work, and that they will then\r\nmake him the scape-goat of the transaction. The declarations too, which\r\nI send you in my public letter, if they should become public, will\r\nprobably raise an universal cry. It will all fall on him, because\r\nMontmorin and Breteuil say, without reserve, that the sacrifice of the\r\nDutch has been against their advice. He will, perhaps, not permit these\r\ndeclarations to appear in this country. They are absolutely unknown:\r\nthey were communicated to me by the Duke of Dorset, and I believe no\r\nother copy has been given here. They will be published doubtless in\r\nEngland, as a proof of their triumph, and may from thence make their way\r\ninto this country. If the Premier can stem a few months, he may remain\r\nlong in office, and will never make war if he can help it. If he should\r\nbe removed, the peace will probably be short. He is solely chargeable\r\nwith the loss of Holland. True, they could not have raised money by\r\ntaxes to supply the necessities of war; but could they do it were their\r\nfinances ever so well arranged? No nation makes war now-a-days, but by\r\nthe aid of loans: and it is probable, that in a war for the liberties\r\nof Holland, all the treasures of that country would have been at their\r\nservice. They have now lost the cow which furnishes the milk of war.\r\nShe will be on the side of their enemies, whenever a rupture shall\r\ntake place: and no arrangement of their finances can countervail this\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt, you permit access to the letters of your foreign\r\nministers, by persons only of the most perfect trust. It is in the\r\nEuropean system to bribe the clerks high, in order to obtain copies\r\nof interesting papers. I am sure you are equally attentive to the\r\nconveyance of your letters to us, as you know that all are opened that\r\npass through any post-office of Europe. Your letters which come by the\r\npacket, if put into the mail at New York, or into the post-office at\r\nHavre, wear proofs that they have been opened. The passenger to whom\r\nthey are confided, should be cautioned always to keep them in his own\r\nhands, till he can deliver them personally in Paris.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXII.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, November 6, 1787\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, November 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of asking your Excellency’s perusal of the enclosed\r\ncase of an American hostage, confined in the prisons of Dunkirk. His\r\ncontinuance there seems to be useless, and yet endless. Not knowing how\r\nfar the government can interfere for his relief, as it is a case wherein\r\nprivate property is concerned, I do not presume to ask his liberation\r\nabsolutely: but I will solicit from your Excellency such measures in his\r\nbehalf, as the laws and usages of the country may permit.\r\n\r\nThe Comptroller General having been so good as to explain to me in a\r\nconversation, that he wished to know what duties were levied in England\r\non American whale-oil, I have had the honor of informing him by letter,\r\nthat the ancient duties on that article are seventeen pounds, six\r\nshillings, and six pence, sterling, the ton, and that some late\r\nadditional duties make them amount to about eighteen pounds sterling.\r\nThat the common whale-oil sells there but for about twenty pounds\r\nsterling, the ton, and of course the duty amounts to a prohibition. This\r\nduty was originally laid on all foreign fish-oil, with a view to favor\r\nthe British and American fisheries. When we became independent, and of\r\ncourse foreign to Great Britain, we became subject to the foreign\r\nduty. No duty, therefore, which France may think proper to lay on this\r\narticle, can drive it to the English market. It could only oblige the\r\ninhabitants of Nantucket to abandon their fishery. But the poverty\r\nof their soil offering them no other resource, they must quit their\r\ncountry, and either establish themselves in Nova Scotia, where, as\r\nBritish fishermen, they may participate of the British premium, in\r\naddition to the ordinary price of their whale-oil, or they must accept\r\nthe conditions which this government offers, for the establishment they\r\nhave proposed at Dunkirk. Your Excellency will judge, what conditions\r\nmay counterbalance, in their minds, the circumstances of the vicinity\r\nof Nova Scotia, sameness of langague,[sp.] laws, religion, customs,\r\nand kindred. Remaining in their native country, to which they are most\r\nsingularly attached, excluded from commerce with England, taught to look\r\nto France as the only country from which they can derive sustenance,\r\nthey will, in case of war, become useful rovers against its enemies.\r\nTheir position, their poverty, their courage, their address, and their\r\nhatred, will render them formidable scourges on the British commerce.\r\nIt is to be considered then, on the one hand, that the duty which M. de\r\nCalonne had proposed to retain on their oil, may endanger the shifting\r\nthis useful body of seamen out of our joint scale into that of the\r\nBritish; and also may suppress a considerable subject of exchange for\r\nthe productions of France: on the other hand, that it may produce an\r\naddition to his Majesty’s revenue. What I have thus far said, is on\r\nthe supposition, that the duty may operate a diminution of the price\r\nreceived by the fishermen. If it act in the contrary direction, and\r\nproduce an augmentation of price to the consumer, it immediately brings\r\ninto competition a variety of other oils, vegetable and animal, a good\r\npart of which France receives from abroad, and the fisherman, thus\r\nlosing his market, is compelled equally to change either his calling or\r\ncountry. When M. de Calonne first agreed to reduce the duties to what he\r\nhas declared, I had great hopes the commodity could bear them, and\r\nthat it would become a medium of commerce between France and the United\r\nStates. I must confess, however, that my expectations have not been\r\nfulfilled, and that but little has come here as yet. This induces me\r\nto fear, that it is so poor an article, that any duty whatever will\r\nsuppress it. Should this take place, and the spirit of emigration once\r\nseize those people, perhaps an abolition of all duty might then come too\r\nlate to stop, what it would now easily prevent. I fear there is danger\r\nin the experiment; and it remains for the wisdom of his Majesty and his\r\nministers to decide, whether the prospect of gain to the revenue, or\r\nestablishing a national fishery, may compensate this danger. If the\r\ngovernment should decide to retain the duty, I shall acquiesce in it\r\ncheerfully, and do every thing in my power to encourage my countrymen\r\nstill to continue their occupation.\r\n\r\nThe actual session of our several legislatures would render it\r\ninteresting to forward immediately the regulations proposed on our\r\ncommerce; and the expiration of the order of Bernis, at the close of\r\nthis month, endangers a suspension and derangement in the commerce of\r\ntobacco, very embarrassing to the merchants of the two countries.\r\nPardon me therefore, Sir, if I appear solicitous to obtain the ultimate\r\ndecision of his Majesty’s Council on these subjects, and to ask as early\r\na communication of that decision, as shall be convenient.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, November 13, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThis will be delivered you by young Mr. Rutledge. Your knowledge of his\r\nfather will introduce him to your notice. He merits it, moreover, on his\r\nown account.\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge your favors of October the 8th and 26th. That of\r\nAugust the 25th was duly received, nor can I recollect by what accident\r\nI was prevented from acknowledging it in mine of September the 28th. It\r\nhas been the source of my subsistence hitherto, and must continue to\r\nbe so, till I receive letters on the affairs of money from America. Van\r\nStaphorsts and Willinks have answered my drafts. Your books for Marquis\r\nde la Fayette are received here. I will notify it to him, who is at\r\npresent with his Provincial Assembly in Auvergne.\r\n\r\nLittle is said lately of the progress of the negotiations between\r\nthe courts of Petersburg, Vienna, and Versailles. The distance of the\r\nformer, and the cautious, unassuming character of its minister here,\r\nis one cause of delays: a greater one is, the greediness and instable\r\ncharacter of the Emperor. Nor do I think that the Principal here,\r\nwill be easily induced to lend himself to any connection, which shall\r\nthreaten a war within a considerable number of years. His own reign\r\nwill be that of peace only, in all probability; and were any accident\r\nto tumble him down, this country would immediately gird on its sword and\r\nbuckler, and trust to occurrences for supplies of money. The wound their\r\nhonor has sustained, festers in their hearts; and it may be said with\r\ntruth, that the Archbishop and a few priests, determined to support his\r\nmeasures, because proud to see their order come again into power, are\r\nthe only advocates for the line of conduct which has been pursued. It is\r\nsaid, and believed through Paris literally, that the Count de\r\nMontmorin ‘_pleuroit comme un enfant_,’ when obliged to sign the\r\ncounter-declaration. Considering the phrase as figurative, I believe it\r\nexpresses the distress of his heart. Indeed, he has made no secret of\r\nhis individual opinion. In the mean time, the Principal goes on with\r\na firm and patriotic spirit in reforming the cruel abuses of the\r\ngovernment, and preparing a new constitution, which will give to this\r\npeople as much liberty as they are capable of managing. This, I think,\r\nwill be the glory of his administration, because, though a good theorist\r\nin finance, he is thought to execute badly. They are about to open a\r\nloan of one hundred millions to supply present wants, and it is said,\r\nthe preface of the _Arrêt_ will contain a promise of the convocation of\r\nthe States General during the ensuing year. Twelve or fifteen Provincial\r\nAssemblies are already in action, and are going on well: and I think,\r\nthat, though the nation suffers in reputation, it will gain infinitely\r\nin happiness under the present administration. I enclose to Mr. Jay a\r\npamphlet, which I will beg of you to forward. I leave it open for your\r\nperusal. When you shall have read it, be so good as to stick a wafer in\r\nit. It is not yet published, nor will be for some days. This copy has\r\nbeen ceded to me as a favor.\r\n\r\nHow do you like our new constitution? I confess there are things in it,\r\nwhich stagger all my dispositions to subscribe to what such an Assembly\r\nhas proposed. The House of federal representatives will not be adequate\r\nto the management of affairs, either foreign or federal. Their President\r\nseems a bad edition of a Polish King. He may be elected from four years\r\nto four years, for life. Reason and experience prove to us, that a\r\nchief magistrate, so continuable, is an office for life. When one or\r\ntwo generations shall have proved, that this is an office for life, it\r\nbecomes, on every succession, worthy of intrigue, of bribery, of force,\r\nand even of foreign interference. It will be of great consequence to\r\nFrance and England, to have America governed by a Galloman or Angloman.\r\nOnce in office, and possessing the military force of the Union, without\r\nthe aid or check of a council, he would not be easily dethroned, even\r\nif the people could be induced to withdraw their votes from him. I wish\r\nthat at the end of the four years, they had made him for ever ineligible\r\na second time. Indeed, I think all the good of this new constitution\r\nmight have been couched in three or four new articles to be added to the\r\ngood, old, and venerable fabric, which should have been preserved even\r\nas a religious relique. Present me and my daughters affectionately to\r\nMrs. Adams. The younger one continues to speak of her warmly. Accept\r\nyourself assurances of the sincere esteem and respect, with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIV.--TO COLONEL SMITH, November 13, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL SMITH.\r\n\r\nParis, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of October the\r\n4th, 8th, and 26th. In the last, you apologize for your letters of\r\nintroduction to Americans coming here. It is so far from needing apology\r\non your part, that it calls for thanks on mine. I endeavor to show\r\ncivilities to all the Americans who come here, and who will give me\r\nopportunities of doing it: and it is a matter of comfort to know, from\r\na good quarter, what they are, and how far I may go in my attentions to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCan you send me Woodmason’s bills for the two copying presses, for the\r\nMarquis de la Fayette and the Marquis de Chastellux? The latter makes\r\none article in a considerable account, of old standing, and which I\r\ncannot present for want of this article. I do not know whether it is\r\nto yourself or Mr. Adams I am to give my thanks for the copy of the new\r\nconstitution. I beg leave, through you, to place them where due. It will\r\nyet be three weeks before I shall receive them from America. There\r\nare very good articles in it; and very bad. I do not know which\r\npreponderate. What we have lately read in the history of Holland, in\r\nthe chapter on the Stadtholder, would have sufficed to set me against\r\na chief magistrate eligible for a long duration, if I had ever been\r\ndisposed towards one: and what we have always read of the elections of\r\nPolish Kings, should have for ever excluded the idea of one continuable\r\nfor life. Wonderful is the effect of impudent and persevering lying.\r\nThe British ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat, and\r\nmodel into every form, lies about our being in anarchy, that the world\r\nhas at length believed them, the English nation has believed them,\r\nthe ministers themselves have come to believe them, and what is more\r\nwonderful, we have believed them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy\r\nexist? Where did it ever exist, except in the single instance of\r\nMassachusetts? And can history produce an instance of rebellion so\r\nhonorably conducted? I say nothing of its motives. They were founded in\r\nignorance, not wickedness. God forbid, we should ever be twenty years\r\nwithout such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well\r\ninformed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to\r\nthe importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under\r\nsuch misconceptions, it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the\r\npublic liberty. We have had thirteen States independent for eleven\r\nyears. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a\r\ncentury and a half for each State. What country before ever existed a\r\ncentury and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve\r\nits liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this\r\npeople preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy\r\nis to set them right as to facts, pardon, and pacify them. What signify\r\na few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be\r\nrefreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It\r\nis its natural manure. Our convention has been too much impressed by the\r\ninsurrection of Massachusetts: and on the spur of the moment, they are\r\nsetting up a kite to keep the hen-yard in order. I hope in God, this\r\narticle will be rectified before the new constitution is accepted. You\r\nask me, if any thing transpires here on the subject of South America?\r\nNot a word. I know that there are combustible materials there, and\r\nthat they wait the torch only. But this country probably will join\r\nthe extinguishers. The want of facts worth communicating to you,\r\nhas occasioned me to give a little loose to dissertation. We must be\r\ncontented to amuse, when we cannot inform.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Mrs. Smith, and be assured of the sincere esteem\r\nof, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXV.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, December 11, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, December 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am later in acknowledging the receipt of your favors of October the\r\n15th, and November the 5th and 15th, because we have been long expecting\r\na packet, which I hoped would bring communications worth detailing to\r\nyou; and she arrived only a few days ago, after a very long passage\r\nindeed. I am very sorry you have not been able to make out the cipher\r\nof my letter of September the 25th, because it contained things which\r\nI wished you to know at that time. They have lost now a part of their\r\nmerit; * but still I wish you could decipher them, as there remains\r\na part, which it might yet be agreeable to you to understand. I have\r\nexamined the cipher, from which it was written. It as precisely a copy\r\nof those given to Messrs. Barclay and Lambe. In order that you may\r\nexamine whether yours corresponds, I will now translate into cipher, the\r\nthree first lines of my letter of June the 14th.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThis will serve to show, whether your cipher corresponds with mine, as\r\nwell as my manner of using it. But I shall not use it in future, till I\r\nknow from you the result of your re-examination of it. I have the honor\r\nnow, to return you the letter you had been so good as to enclose to me.\r\nAbout the same time of Liston’s conversation with you, similar ones were\r\nheld with me by Mr. Eden. He particularly questioned me on the effect\r\nof our treaty with France, in the case of a war, and what might be our\r\ndispositions. I told him without hesitation, that our treaty obliged\r\nus to receive the armed vessels of France, with their prizes, into our\r\nports, and to refuse the admission of prizes made on her by her enemies;\r\nthat there was a clause by which we guarantied to France her American\r\npossessions, and which might, perhaps, force us into the war, if these\r\nwere attacked. ‘Then it will be war,’ said he, ‘for they will assuredly\r\nbe attacked.’ I added, that our dispositions would be to be neutral, and\r\nthat I thought it the interest of both those powers that we should be\r\nso, because it would relieve both from all anxiety as to the feeding\r\ntheir West India islands, and England would, moreover, avoid a heavy\r\nland war on our continent, which would cripple all her proceedings\r\nelsewhere. He expected these sentiments from me personally, and he knew\r\nthem to be analogous to those of our country. We had often before had\r\noccasions of knowing each other: his peculiar bitterness towards us\r\nhad sufficiently appeared, and I had never concealed from him, that I\r\nconsidered the British as our natural enemies, and as the only nation\r\non earth, who wished us ill from the bottom of their souls. And I am\r\nsatisfied, that were our continent to be swallowed up by the ocean,\r\nGreat Britain would be in a bonfire from one end to the other. Mr.\r\nAdams, as you know, has asked his recall. This has been granted, and\r\nColonel Smith is to return too; Congress having determined to put an end\r\nto their commission at that court. I suspect and hope they will make no\r\nnew appointment.\r\n\r\nOur new constitution is powerfully attacked in the American newspapers.\r\nThe objections are, that its effect would be to form the thirteen States\r\ninto one; that, proposing to melt all down into one general government,\r\nthey have fenced the people by no declaration of rights; they have not\r\nrenounced the power of keeping a standing army; they have not secured\r\nthe liberty of the press; they have reserved the power of abolishing\r\ntrials by jury in civil cases; they have proposed that the laws of the\r\nfederal legislatures shall be paramount the laws and constitutions of\r\nthe States; they have abandoned rotation in office; and particularly\r\ntheir President may be re-elected from four years to four years, for\r\nlife, so as to render him a King for life, like a King of Poland; and\r\nthey have not given him either the check or aid of a council. To these,\r\nthey add calculations of expense, &c. &.c. to frighten the people. You\r\nwill perceive that those objections are serious and some of them not\r\nwithout foundation. The constitution, however, has been received with\r\na very general enthusiasm, and as far as can be judged from external\r\ndemonstrations, the bulk of the people are eager to adopt it. In the\r\neastern States, the printers will print nothing against it, unless the\r\nwriter subscribes his name. Massachusetts and Connecticut have called\r\nconventions in January, to consider of it. In New York, there is a\r\ndivision. The Governor (Clinton) is known to be hostile to it. Jersey,\r\nit is thought, will certainly accept it. Pennsylvania is divided; and\r\nall the bitterness of her factions has been kindled anew on it. But the\r\nparty in favor of it is strongest, both in and out of the legislature.\r\nThis is the party anciently of Morris, Wilson, &c., Delaware will do\r\nwhat Pennsylvania shall do. Maryland is thought favorable to it; yet it\r\nis supposed Chase and Paca will oppose it. As to Virginia, two of her\r\nDelegates, in the first place, refused to sign it. These were Randolph,\r\nthe Governor, and George Mason. Besides these, Henry, Harrison, Nelson,\r\nand the Lees are against it. General Washington will be for it, but it\r\nis not in his character to exert himself much in the case. Madison\r\nwill be its main pillar; but though an immensely powerful one, it is\r\nquestionable whether he can bear the weight of such a host. So that the\r\npresumption is, that Virginia will reject it. We know nothing of the\r\ndispositions of the States south of this. Should it fall through, as is\r\npossible, notwithstanding the enthusiasm with which it was received in\r\nthe first moment, it is probable that Congress will propose, that, the\r\nobjections which the people shall make to it being once known, another\r\nconvention shall be assembled, to adopt the improvements generally\r\nacceptable, and omit those found disagreeable. In this way, union may\r\nbe produced under a happy constitution, and one which shall not be too\r\nenergetic, as are the constitutions of Europe. I give you these details,\r\nbecause, possibly, you may not have received them all. The sale of our\r\nwestern lands is immensely successful. Five millions of acres have been\r\nsold at private sale, for a dollar an acre, in certificates; and at the\r\npublic sales, some of them had sold as high as two dollars and forty\r\ncents the acre. The sales had not been begun two months. By these\r\nmeans, taxes, &c. our domestic debt, originally twenty-eight millions\r\nof dollars, was reduced, by the 1st day of last October, to twelve\r\nmillions, and they were then in treaty-for two millions of acres more,\r\nat a dollar, private sale. Our domestic debt will thus be soon paid off,\r\nand that done, the sales will go on for money, at a cheaper rate, no\r\ndoubt, for the payment of our foreign debt. The _petite guerre_, always\r\nwaged by the Indians, seems not to abate the ardor of purchase or\r\nemigration. Kentucky is now counted at sixty thousand. Frankland is also\r\ngrowing fast.\r\n\r\nI have been told, that the cutting through the Isthmus of Panama, which\r\nthe world has so often wished, and supposed practicable, has at times\r\nbeen thought of by the government of Spain, and that they once proceeded\r\nso far, as to have a survey and examination made of the ground; but\r\nthat the result was, either impracticability or too great difficulty.\r\nProbably the Count de Campomanes, or Don Ulloa, can give you information\r\non this head. I should be exceedingly pleased to get as minute details\r\nas possible on it, and even copies of the survey, report, &c. if they\r\ncould be obtained at a moderate expense. I take the liberty of asking\r\nyour assistance in this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVI.--TO JOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, December 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, I received from Fiseaux & Co. of Amsterdam, a\r\nletter notifying me that the principal of their loan to the United\r\nStates would become due the first day of January. I answered them that\r\nI had neither powers nor information on the subject, but would transmit\r\ntheir letter to the board of treasury. I did so, by the packet which\r\nsailed from Havre, August the 10th. The earliest answer possible would\r\nhave been by the packet which arrived at Havre three or four days ago.\r\nBut by her I do not receive the scrip of a pen from any body. This makes\r\nme suppose, that my letters are committed to Paul Jones, who was to sail\r\na week after the departure of the packet; and that possibly, he may be\r\nthe bearer of orders from the treasury, to repay Fiseaux’ loan, with the\r\nmoney you borrowed. But it is also possible, he may bring no order on\r\nthe subject. The slowness with which measures are adopted on our side\r\nthe water, does not permit us to count on punctual answers; but, on the\r\ncontrary, renders it necessary for us to suppose, in the present case,\r\nthat no orders will arrive in time, and to consider whether any thing,\r\nand what, should be done. As it may be found expedient to transfer all\r\nour foreign debts to Holland, by borrowing there, and as it may always\r\nbe prudent to preserve a good credit in that country, because we may\r\nbe forced into wars, whether we will or not, I should suppose it very\r\nimprudent to suffer our credit to be annihilated, for so small a sum\r\nas fifty-one thousand guelders. The injury will be greater too, in\r\nproportion to the smallness of the sum; for they will ask, ‘How can a\r\npeople be trusted for large sums, who break their faith for such small\r\nones?’ You know best what effect it will have on the minds of the\r\nmoney-lenders of that country, should we fail in this payment. You know\r\nbest also, whether it is practicable and prudent for us, to have this\r\ndebt paid without orders. I refer the matter, therefore, wholly to\r\nyour consideration, willing to participate with you in any risk and any\r\nresponsibility, which may arise. I think it one of those cases, where\r\nit is a duty to risk one’s self. You will perceive, by the enclosed, the\r\nnecessity of an immediate answer, and that, if you think any thing\r\ncan and should be done, all the necessary authorities from you should\r\naccompany your letter. In the mean time, should I receive any orders\r\nfrom the treasury by Paul Jones, I will pursue them, and consider\r\nwhatever you shall have proposed or done, as _non avenue_.\r\n\r\nI am, with much affection, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, December 20, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, December 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of October the 8th, by the Count de Moustier.\r\nYours of July the 18th, September the 6th, and October the 24th, were\r\nsuccessively received, yesterday, the day before, and three or four\r\ndays before that. I have only had time to read the letters; the printed\r\npapers communicated with them, however interesting, being obliged to lie\r\nover till I finish my despatches for the packet, which despatches must\r\ngo from hence the day after to-morrow. I have much to thank you for;\r\nfirst and most for the ciphered paragraph respecting myself. These\r\nlittle informations are very material towards forming my own decisions.\r\nI would be glad even to know, when any individual member thinks I have\r\ngone wrong in any instance. If I know myself, it would not excite ill\r\nblood in me, while it would assist to guide my conduct, perhaps to\r\njustify it, and to keep me to my duty, alert. I must thank you too, for\r\nthe information in Thomas Burke’s case; though you will have found by a\r\nsubsequent letter, that I have asked of you a further investigation of\r\nthat matter. It is to gratify the lady who is at the head of the convent\r\nwherein my daughters are, and who, by her attachment and attention to\r\nthem, lays me under great obligations, I shall hope, therefore, still\r\nto receive from you the result of all the further inquiries my\r\nsecond letter had asked. The parcel of rice which you informed me had\r\nmiscarried, accompanied my letter to the Delegates of South Carolina.\r\nMr. Bourgoin was to be the bearer of both, and both were delivered\r\ntogether into the hands of his relation here, who introduced him to\r\nme, and who, at a subsequent moment, undertook to convey them to Mr.\r\nBourgoin. This person was an engraver, particularly recommended to\r\nDr. Franklin and Mr. Hopkinson. Perhaps he may have mislaid the little\r\nparcel of rice among his baggage. I am much pleased, that the sale\r\nof western lands is so successful. I hope they will absorb all the\r\ncertificates of our domestic debt speedily, in the first place, and that\r\nthen, offered for cash, they will do the same by our foreign ones.\r\n\r\nThe season admitting only of operations in the cabinet, and these\r\nbeing in a great measure secret, I have little to fill a letter, I\r\nwill therefore make up the deficiency, by adding a few words on the\r\nconstitution proposed by our convention.\r\n\r\nI like much the general idea of framing a government, which should go on\r\nof itself, peaceably, without needing continual recurrence to the\r\nState legislatures. I like the organization of the government into\r\nlegislative, judiciary, and executive. I like the power given the\r\nlegislature to levy taxes, and for that reason solely, I approve of the\r\ngreater House being chosen by the people directly. For though I think\r\na House, so chosen, will be very far inferior to the present Congress,\r\nwill be very illy qualified to legislate for the Union, for foreign\r\nnations, &c.; yet this evil does not weigh against the good of\r\npreserving inviolate the fundamental principle, that the people are\r\nnot to be taxed but by representitives[sp.] chosen immediately by\r\nthemselves. I am captivated by the compromise of the opposite claims of\r\nthe great and little States, of the latter to equal, and the former to\r\nproportional influence. I am much pleased, too, with the substitution\r\nof the method of voting by persons, instead of that of voting by States:\r\nand I like the negative given to the Executive, conjointly with a third\r\nof either House; though I should have liked it better, had the judiciary\r\nbeen associated for that purpose, or invested separately with a similar\r\npower. There are other good things of less moment.\r\n\r\nI will now tell you what I do not like. First, the omission of a bill of\r\nrights, providing clearly, and without the aid of sophism, for freedom\r\nof religion, freedom of the press, protection against standing armies,\r\nrestriction of monopolies, the eternal and unremitting force of the\r\n_habeas corpus_ laws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable\r\nby the laws of the land, and not by the laws of nations. To say, as Mr.\r\nWilson does, that a bill of rights was not necessary, because all is\r\nreserved in the case of the general government which is not given, while\r\nin the particular ones, all is given which is not reserved, might do\r\nfor the audience to which it was addressed: but it is surely a _gratis\r\ndictum_, the reverse of which might just as well be said; and it is\r\nopposed by strong inferences from the body of the instrument, as well as\r\nfrom the omission of the clause of our present Confederation, which had\r\nmade the reservation in express terms. It was hard to conclude, because\r\nthere has been a want of uniformity among the States as to the cases\r\ntriable by jury, because some have been so incautious as to dispense\r\nwith this mode of trial in certain cases, therefore the more prudent\r\nStates shall be reduced to the same level of calamity. It would have\r\nbeen much more just and wise to have concluded the other way, that as\r\nmost of the States had preserved with jealousy this sacred palladium of\r\nliberty, those who had wandered, should be brought back to it: and to\r\nhave established general right rather than general wrong. For I consider\r\nall the ill as established, which maybe established. I have a right to\r\nnothing, which another has a right to take away; and Congress will have\r\na right to take away trials by jury in all civil cases. Let me add,\r\nthat a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every\r\ngovernment on earth, general or particular; and what no just government\r\nshould refuse, or rest on inference.\r\n\r\nThe second feature I dislike, and strongly dislike, is the abandonment,\r\nin every instance, of the principle of rotation in office, and most\r\nparticularly in the case of the President. Reason and experience tell\r\nus, that the first magistrate will always be re-elected if he may be\r\nre-elected. He is then an officer for life.\r\n\r\nThis once observed, it becomes of so much consequence to certain\r\nnations, to have a friend or a foe at the head of our affairs, that they\r\nwill interfere with money and with arms. A Galloman, or an Angloman,\r\nwill be supported by the nation he befriends. If once elected, and at a\r\nsecond or third election outvoted by one or two votes, he will pretend\r\nfalse votes, foul play, hold possession of the reins of government,\r\nbe supported by the States voting for him, especially if they be the\r\ncentral ones, lying in a compact body themselves, and separating their\r\nopponents; and they will be aided by one nation in Europe, while the\r\nmajority are aided by another. The election of a President of America,\r\nsome years hence, will be much more interesting to certain nations of\r\nEurope, than ever the election of a King of Poland was. Reflect on all\r\nthe instances in history, ancient and modern, of elective monarchies,\r\nand say, if they do not give foundation for my fears; the Roman\r\nEmperors, the Popes while they were of any importance, the German\r\nEmperors till they became hereditary in practice, the Kings of Poland,\r\nthe Deys of the Ottoman dependencies. It may be said, that if elections\r\nare to be attended with these disorders, the less frequently they\r\nare repeated the better. But experience says, that to free them from\r\ndisorder, they must be rendered less interesting by a necessity of\r\nchange. No foreign power, nor domestic party, will waste their blood and\r\nmoney to elect a person, who must go out at the end of a short period.\r\nThe power of removing every fourth year by the vote of the people, is\r\na power which they will not exercise, and if they were disposed\r\nto exercise it, they would not be permitted. The King of Poland is\r\nremovable every day by the diet. But they never remove him. Nor would\r\nRussia, the Emperor, &c. permit them to do it. Smaller objections are,\r\nthe appeals on matters of fact as well as law; and the binding all\r\npersons, legislative, executive, and judiciary, by oath, to maintain\r\nthat constitution. I do not pretend to decide, what would be the best\r\nmethod of procuring the establishment of the manifold good things in\r\nthis constitution, and of getting rid of the bad. Whether by adopting\r\nit, in hopes of future amendment; or, after it shall have been duly\r\nweighed and canvassed by the people, after seeing the parts they\r\ngenerally dislike, and those they generally approve, to say to them,\r\n‘We see now what you wish. You are willing to give to your federal\r\ngovernment such and such powers: but you wish, at the same time, to have\r\nsuch and such fundamental rights secured to you, and certain sources of\r\nconvulsion taken away. Be it so. Send together your deputies again. Let\r\nthem establish your fundamental rights by a sacrosanct declaration, and\r\nlet them pass the parts of the constitution you have approved. These\r\nwill give powers to your federal government sufficient for your\r\nhappiness.’ This is what might be said, and would probably produce a\r\nspeedy, more perfect, and more permanent form of government. At all\r\nevents, I hope you will not be discouraged from making other trials, if\r\nthe present one should fail. We are never permitted to despair of\r\nthe commonwealth. I have thus told you freely what I like, and what I\r\ndislike, merely as a matter of curiosity; for I know it is not in my\r\npower to offer matter of information to your judgment, which has been\r\nformed after hearing and weighing every thing which the wisdom of\r\nman could offer on these subjects. I own, I am not a friend to a very\r\nenergetic government. It is always oppressive. It places the governors\r\nindeed more at their ease, at the expense of the people. The late\r\nrebellion in Massachusetts has given more alarm, than I think it should\r\nhave done. Calculate that one rebellion in thirteen States in the course\r\nof eleven years, is but one for each State in a century and a half. No\r\ncountry should be so long without one. Nor will any degree of power in\r\nthe hands of government prevent insurrections. In England, where the\r\nhand of power is heavier than with us, there are seldom half a dozen\r\nyears without an insurrection. In France, Where it is still heavier, but\r\nless despotic, as Montesquieu supposes, than in some other countries,\r\nand where there are always two or three hundred thousand men ready to\r\ncrush insurrections, there have been three in the course of the three\r\nyears I have been here, in every one of which greater numbers were\r\nengaged than in Massachusetts, and a great deal more blood was spilt. In\r\nTurkey, where the sole nod of the despot is death, insurrections are the\r\nevents of every day. Compare again the ferocious depredations of\r\ntheir insurgents, with the order, the moderation, and the almost\r\nself-extinguishment of ours. And say, finally, whether peace is best\r\npreserved by giving energy to the government, or information to the\r\npeople. This last is the most certain and the most legitimate engine of\r\ngovernment. Educate and inform the whole mass of the people. Enable them\r\nto see that it is their interest to preserve peace and order, and they\r\nwill preserve them. And it requires no very high degree of education\r\nto convince them of this. They are the only sure reliance for the\r\npreservation of our liberty. After all, it is my principle that the\r\nwill of the majority should prevail. If they approve the proposed\r\nconstitution in all its parts, I shall concur in it cheerfully, in\r\nhopes they will amend it, whenever they shall find it works wrong. This\r\nreliance cannot deceive us, as long as we remain virtuous; and I think\r\nwe shall be so, as long as agriculture is our principal object, which\r\nwill be the case, while there remain vacant lands in any part of\r\nAmerica. When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in\r\nEurope, we shall become corrupt as in Europe, and go to eating\r\none another as they do there. I have tired you by this time with\r\ndisquisitions which you have already heard repeated by others, a\r\nthousand and a thousand times; and, therefore, shall only add assurances\r\nof the esteem and attachment, with which I have the honor to be, Dear\r\nSir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. The instability of our laws is really an immense evil. I think it\r\nwould be well to provide in our constitutions, that there shall always\r\nbe a twelvemonth between the engrossing a bill and passing it: that it\r\nshould then be offered to its passage without changing a word: and that\r\nif circumstances should be thought to require a speedier passage, it\r\nshould take two thirds of both Houses, instead of a bare majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVIII.--TO E. CARRINGTON, December 21, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. CARRINGTON\r\n\r\nParis, December 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have just received your two favors of October the 23rd and November\r\nthe 10th. I am much obliged to you for your hints in the Danish\r\nbusiness. They are the only information I have on that subject, except\r\nthe resolution of Congress, and warn me of a rock on which I should most\r\ncertainly have split. The vote plainly points out an agent, only leaving\r\nit to my discretion to substitute another. My judgment concurs with that\r\nof Congress as to his fitness. But I shall inquire for the surest banker\r\nat Copenhagen to receive the money, not because I should have had any\r\ndoubts, but because I am informed others have them. Against the failure\r\nof a banker, were such an accident, or any similar one to happen, I\r\ncannot be held accountable in a case, where I act without particular\r\ninterest. My principal idea in proposing the transfer of the French\r\ndebt, was, to obtain on the new loans a much longer day for the\r\nreimbursement of the principal, hoping that the resources of the United\r\nStates could have been equal to the article of interest alone. But I\r\nshall endeavor to quiet, as well as I can, those interested. A part of\r\nthem will probably sell out at any rate: and one great claimant may be\r\nexpected to make a bitter attack on our honor. I am very much pleased\r\nto hear, that our western lands sell so successfully. I turn to this\r\nprecious resource, as that which will, in every event, liberate us from\r\nour domestic debt, and perhaps too from our foreign one: and this, much\r\nsooner than I had expected. I do not think any thing could have been\r\ndone with them in Europe. Individual speculators and sharpers had duped\r\nso many with their unlocated land-warrants, that every offer would have\r\nbeen suspected.\r\n\r\nAs to the new constitution, I find myself nearly a neutral. There is a\r\ngreat mass of good in it, in a very desirable form; but there is also,\r\nto me, a bitter pill or two. I have written somewhat lengthily to Mr.\r\nMadison on this subject, and will take the liberty to refer you to that\r\npart of my letter to him. I will add one question to what I have said\r\nthere. Would it not have been better to assign to Congress exclusively,\r\nthe article of imposts for federal purposes, and to have left direct\r\ntaxation exclusively to the States? I should suppose the former fund\r\nsufficient for all probable events, aided by the land office.\r\n\r\nThe form which the affairs of Europe may assume, is not yet decipherable\r\nby those out of the cabinet. The Emperor gives himself, at present,\r\nthe airs of a mediator. This is necessary to justify a breach with the\r\nPorte. He has his eye at the same time on Germany, and particularly on\r\nBavaria, the Elector of which has, for a long time, been hanging over\r\nthe grave. Probably, France would now consent to the exchange of the\r\nAustrian Netherlands, to be created into a kingdom for the Duke de\r\nDeux-ponts, against the electorate of Bavaria. This will require a\r\nwar. The Empress longs for Turkey, and viewing France as her principal\r\nobstacle, would gladly negotiate her acquiescence. To spur on this, she\r\nis coquetting it with England. The King of Prussia, too, is playing\r\na double game between France and England. But I suppose the former\r\nincapable of forgiving him, or of ever reposing confidence in him.\r\nPerhaps the spring may unfold to us the final arrangement, which will\r\ntake place among the powers of this continent.\r\n\r\nI often doubt whether I should trouble Congress or my friends with these\r\ndetails of European politics. I know they do not excite that interest\r\nin America, of which it is impossible for one to divest himself here. I\r\nknow too, that it is a maxim with us, and I think it is a wise one, not\r\nto entangle ourselves with the affairs of Europe. Still, I think,\r\nwe should know them. The Turks have practised the same maxim of not\r\nmeddling in the complicated wrangles of this continent. But they have\r\nunwisely chosen to be ignorant of them also, and it is this total\r\nignorance of Europe, its combinations, and its movements, which exposes\r\nthem to that annihilation possibly about taking place. While there are\r\npowers in Europe which fear our views, or have views on us, we should\r\nkeep an eye on them, their connections, and oppositions, that in a\r\nmoment of need, we may avail ourselves of their weakness with respect to\r\nothers as well as ourselves, and calculate their designs and movements,\r\non all the circumstances under which they exist. Though I am persuaded,\r\ntherefore, that these details are read by many with great indifference,\r\nyet I think it my duty to enter into them, and to run the risk of giving\r\ntoo much, rather than too little information.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with perfect esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. The resolution of Congress, relative to the prize money received\r\nhere, speaks of that money as paid to me. I hope this matter is properly\r\nunderstood. The treasury board desired me to receive it, and apply it to\r\nsuch and such federal purposes; and they would pay the dividends of\r\nthe claimants in America. This would save the expense of remittance. I\r\ndeclined, however, receiving the money, and ordered it into the hands\r\nof their banker, who paid it away for the purposes to which they had\r\ndestined it. I should be sorry an idea should get abroad, that I had\r\nreceived the money of those poor fellows, and applied it to other\r\npurposes. I shall, in like manner, order the Danish and Barbary money\r\ninto the hands of bankers, carefully avoiding ever to touch a sou of\r\nit, or having any other account to make out than what the banker will\r\nfurnish. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIX.--TO MONSIEUR LIMOZIN, December 22, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\nParis, December 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the\r\n18th and 19th of November, and two of the 18th of the present month.\r\nI did not write to you immediately on the receipt of the two first,\r\nbecause the observation they contained were to be acted on here. I\r\nwas much obliged to you for them, as I have been frequently before for\r\nothers, and you will find that I have profited by them in the _Arrêt_\r\nwhich is to come out for the regulation of our commerce, wherein most\r\nof the things are provided for, which you have from time to time\r\nrecommended. With respect to the article of yellow wax, I think there\r\nis a general clause in the _Arrêt_, which will take it in; but I am not\r\nsure of it. If there be not, it is now too late to get any alteration\r\nmade. You shall receive the _Arrêt_ the moment it is communicated to me.\r\n\r\nI have examined the case of Captain Thomas, with all the dispositions\r\npossible, to interpose for him. But on mature reflection, I find it is\r\none of those cases wherein my solicitation would be ill received. The\r\ngovernment of France, to secure to its subjects the carrying trade\r\nbetween her colonies and the mother country, have made a law, forbidding\r\nany foreign vessels to undertake to carry between them. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, an American vessel has undertaken, and has brought a cargo. For me\r\nto ask that this vessel shall be received, would be to ask a repeal of\r\nthe law, because there is no more reason for receiving her, than there\r\nwill be for receiving the second, third, &c, which shall act against the\r\nsame law, nor for receiving an American vessel, more than the vessels of\r\nother nations. Captain Thomas has probably engaged in this business, not\r\nknowing the law; but ignorance of the law is no excuse, in any country.\r\nIf it were, the laws would lose their effect, because it can be always\r\npretended. Were I to make this application to the Comptroller General,\r\nhe might possibly ask me, whether, in a like case, of a French vessel in\r\nAmerica acting through ignorance, against law, we would suspend the law\r\nas to her? I should be obliged honestly to answer, that with us there\r\nis no power which can suspend the law for a moment; and Captain Thomas\r\nknows that this answer would be the truth. The Senegal company seems to\r\nbe as much engaged in it as he is. I should suppose his most probable\r\nmeans of extrication, would be with their assistance, and availing\r\nhimself of their privileges, and the apparent authority he has received\r\nfrom the officers of government there. I am sorry his case is such a\r\none, as I cannot present to the minister. A jealousy of our taking\r\naway their carrying trade, is the principal reason which obstructs our\r\nadmission into their West India islands. It would not be right for me to\r\nstrengthen that jealousy.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXX.--TO JOHN JAY, December 31, 1787\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, December 31, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSince the receipt of the letter of Monsieur de Calonne, of October the\r\n22nd, 1786, I have several times had the honor of mentioning to you,\r\nthat I was endeavoring to get the substance of that letter reduced into\r\nan _Arrêt_, which, instead of being revocable by a single letter of a\r\nComptroller General, would require an _Arrêt_ to repeal or alter it, and\r\nof course must be discussed in full Council, and so give time to prevent\r\nit. This has been pressed as much as it could be with prudence. One\r\ncause of delay has been the frequent changes of the Comptroller General;\r\nas we had always our whole work to begin again, with every new one.\r\nMonsieur Lambert’s continuance in office for some months has enabled us,\r\nat length, to get through the business; and I have just received from\r\nhim a letter, and the _Arrêt_ duly authenticated; of which I have the\r\nhonor to send you a number of printed copies. You will find, that the\r\nseveral alterations and additions are made, which, on my visit, to the\r\nseaports, I had found to be necessary, and which my letters of June the\r\n21st and August the 6th particularly mentioned to you. Besides these,\r\nwe have obtained some new articles of value, for which openings arose\r\nin the course of the negotiation. I say we have done it, because\r\nthe Marquis de la Fayette has gone hand in hand with me through this\r\nbusiness, and has been a most invaluable aid. I take the liberty of\r\nmaking some observations on the articles of the _Arrêt_, severally, for\r\ntheir explanation, as well as for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nArticle 1. In the course of our conferences with the Comptroller\r\nGeneral, we had prevailed on him to pass this article with a suppression\r\nof all duty. When he reported the _Arrêt_, however, to the Council, this\r\nsuppression was objected to, and it was insisted to re-establish the\r\nduties of seven livres and ten sous, and of ten sous the livre, reserved\r\nin the letter of M. de Calonne. The passage of the _Arrêt_ was stopped,\r\nand the difficulty communicated to me. I urged every thing I could,\r\nin letters and in conferences, to convince them that whale-oil was an\r\narticle which could bear no duty at all. That if the duty fell on the\r\nconsumer, he would choose to buy vegetable oils; if on the fisherman, he\r\ncould no longer live by his calling, remaining in his own country;\r\nand that if he quitted his own country, the circumstances of vicinity,\r\nsameness of language, laws, religion, and manners, and perhaps the\r\nties of kindred, would draw him to Nova Scotia, in spite of every\r\nencouragement which could be given at Dunkirk; and that thus those\r\nfishermen would be shifted out of a scale friendly to France, into one\r\nalways hostile. Nothing, however, could prevail. It hung on this article\r\nalone, for two months, during which we risked the total loss of the\r\n_Arrêt_ on the stability in office of Monsieur Lambert; for if he had\r\ngone out, his successor might be less favorable; and if Monsieur Necker\r\nwere the successor, we might lose the whole, as he never set any\r\nstore by us, or the connection with us. About ten days ago, it became\r\nuniversally believed that Monsieur Lambert was to go out immediately.\r\nI therefore declined further insisting on the total suppression, and\r\ndesired the _Arrêt_ might pass, leaving the duties on whale-oil, as\r\nMonsieur de Calonne had promised them; but with a reservation, which\r\nmay countenance our bringing on this matter again, at a more favorable\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. The other fish-oils are placed in a separate article;\r\nbecause, whatever encouragements we may hereafter obtain for whale-oils,\r\nthey will not be extended to those which their own fisheries produce.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. A company had silently, and by unfair means, obtained a\r\nmonopoly for the making and selling spermaceti candles: as soon as we\r\ndiscovered it, we solicited its suppression, which is effected by this\r\nclause.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The duty of an eighth per cent, is merely to oblige the\r\nmasters of vessels to enter their cargoes, for the information of\r\ngovernment; without inducing them to attempt to smuggle.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. Tar, pitch, and turpentine of America, coming in competition\r\nwith the same articles produced in the southwestern parts of France,\r\nwe could obtain no greater reduction, than two and a half per cent. The\r\nduties before were from four to six times that amount.\r\n\r\nArticle 10. The right of _entrepôt_, given by this article, is almost\r\nthe same thing, as the making all their ports, free ports for us. The\r\nships are indeed subject to be visited, and the cargoes must be reported\r\nin ports of _entrepôt_, which need not be done in the free ports.\r\nBut the communication between the _entrepôt_ and the country is not\r\ninterrupted by continual search of all persons passing into the country,\r\nwhich has proved so troublesome to the inhabitants of our free ports,\r\nas that a considerable proportion of them have wished to give back the\r\nprivilege of their freedom.\r\n\r\nArticle 13. This article gives us the privileges and advantages of\r\nnative subjects, in all their possessions in Asia, and in the scales\r\nleading thereto. This expression means, at present, the isles of France\r\nand Bourbon, and will include the Cape of Good Hope, should any future\r\nevent put it into the hands of France. It was with a view to this, that\r\nI proposed the expression, because we were then in hourly expectation\r\nof a war, and it was suspected that France would take possession of\r\nthat place. It will, in no case, be considered as including any thing\r\nwestward of the Cape of Good Hope. I must observe further, on this\r\narticle, that it will only become valuable, on the suppression of their\r\nEast India Company; because, as long as their monopoly continues, even\r\nnative subjects cannot enter their Asiatic ports, for the purposes of\r\ncommerce. It is considered, however, as certain, that this Company will\r\nbe immediately suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe article of tobacco could not be introduced into the _Arrêt_; because\r\nit was necessary to consider the Farmers General as parties to that\r\narrangement. It rests, therefore, of necessity, on the basis of a letter\r\nonly. You will perceive that this is nothing more than a continuation of\r\nthe order of Bernis, only leaving the prices unfixed; and like that, it\r\nwill require a constant and vexatious attention, to have its execution\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nThe States who have much to carry, and few carriers, will observe,\r\nperhaps, that the benefits of these regulations are somewhat narrowed,\r\nby confining them to articles brought hither in French or American\r\nbottoms. But they will consider, that nothing in these instruments moves\r\nfrom us. The advantages they hold out are all given by this country to\r\nus, and the givers will modify their gifts as they please. I suppose it\r\nto be a determined principle of this court not to suffer our carrying\r\nbusiness, so far as their consumption of our commodities extends,\r\nto become a nursery for British seamen. Nor would this, perhaps, be\r\nadvantageous to us, considering the dispositions of the two nations\r\ntowards us. The preference which our shipping will obtain on this\r\naccount, may counterpoise the discouragements it experiences from the\r\naggravated dangers of the Barbary States. Nor is the idea unpleasing,\r\nwhich shows itself in various parts of these papers, of naturalizing\r\nAmerican bottoms, and American citizens in France and in its foreign\r\npossessions. Once established here, and in their eastern settlements,\r\nthey may revolt less at the proposition to extend it to those westward.\r\nThey are not yet, however, at that point; we must be contented to go\r\ntowards it a step at a time, and trust to future events for hastening\r\nour progress.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the alliance between this and the two imperial courts,\r\nnothing certain transpires. We are enabled to conjecture its progress,\r\nonly from facts which now and then show themselves. The following may be\r\nconsidered as indications of it. 1. The Emperor has made an attempt to\r\nsurprise Belgrade. The attempt failed, but will serve to plunge him into\r\nthe war, and to show that he had assumed the character of mediator, only\r\nto enable himself to gain some advantage by surprise. 2. The mediation\r\nof France is probably at an end, and their abandonment of the Turks\r\nagreed on; because they have secretly ordered their officers to quit the\r\nTurkish service. This fact is known to but few, and not intended to be\r\nknown: but I think it certain. 3. To the offer of mediation lately made\r\nby England and Prussia, the court of Petersburg answered, that having\r\ndeclined the mediation of a friendly power (France), she could not\r\naccept that of two courts, with whose dispositions she had reason to be\r\ndissatisfied. 4. The States General are said to have instructed their\r\nambassador here, lately, to ask of M. de Montmorin, whether the inquiry\r\nhad been made, which they had formerly desired; ‘By what authority the\r\nFrench engineers had been placed in the service of Holland?’ And that he\r\nanswered, that the inquiry had not been made, nor should be made.\r\nThough I do not consider the channel through which I get this fact,\r\nas absolutely sure, yet it is so respectable, that I give credit to it\r\nmyself. 5. The King of Prussia is withdrawing his troops from Holland.\r\nShould this alliance show itself it would seem that France, thus\r\nstrengthened, might dictate the re-establishment of the affairs of\r\nHolland, in her own form. For it is not conceivable, that Prussia would\r\ndare to move, nor that England would alone undertake such a war, and\r\nfor such a purpose. She appears, indeed, triumphant at present; but the\r\nquestion is, Who will triumph last?\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from Mr. Dumas. I received one from him myself,\r\nwherein he assures me, that no difficulties shall be produced, by what\r\nhe had suggested relative to his mission to Brussels. The gazettes of\r\nFrance and Leyden to this date accompany this letter, which, with the\r\nseveral papers put under your cover, I shall send to M. Limozin, our\r\nagent at Havre, to be forwarded by the Juno, Captain Jenkins, which\r\nsails from that port for New York, on the 3d of January.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXI.--TO MONSIEUR LAMBERT, January 3, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LAMBERT.\r\n\r\nParis, January 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am honored with your Excellency’s letter of the 29th of December,\r\nenclosing the _Arrêt_ on the commerce between France and the United\r\nStates. I availed myself of the occasion of a vessel sailing this day\r\nfrom Havre for New York, to forward it to Congress. They will receive\r\nwith singular satisfaction, this new testimony of his Majesty’s\r\nfriendship for the United States, of his dispositions to promote their\r\ninterest, and to strengthen the bands which connect the two nations.\r\n\r\nPermit me, Sir, to return you, personally, my sincere thanks for the\r\ngreat attention you have paid to this subject, for the sacrifices you\r\nhave kindly made of a time so precious as yours, every moment of which\r\nis demanded and is occupied by objects interesting to the happiness of\r\nmillions; and to proffer you the homage of those sincere sentiments\r\nof attachment and respect, with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXII.--TO LE COMTE BERNSTORFF, January 21, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LE COMTE BERNSTORFF, _Minister of Foreign Affairs, Copenhagen_.\r\n\r\nParis, January 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am instructed by the United States of America, in Congress assembled,\r\nto bring again under the consideration of his Majesty, the King of\r\nDenmark, and of his ministers, the case of the three prizes taken from\r\nthe English during the late war, by an American squadron under the\r\ncommand of Commodore Paul Jones, put into Bergen in distress, there\r\nrescued from our possession by orders from the court of Denmark,\r\nand delivered back to the English. Dr. Franklin, then Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary from the United States at the court of Versailles, had\r\nthe honor of making applications to the court of Denmark, for a just\r\nindemnification to the persons interested, and particularly by a letter\r\nof the 22nd of December, 1779, a copy of which I have now the honor of\r\nenclosing to your Excellency. In consequence of this, the sum of ten\r\nthousand pounds was proposed to him, as an indemnification, through\r\nthe Baron de Waltersdorff, then at Paris. The departure of both those\r\ngentlemen from this place, soon after, occasioned an intermission in\r\nthe correspondence on this subject. But the United States continue to\r\nbe very sensibly affected by this delivery of their prizes to Great\r\nBritain, and the more so, as no part of their conduct had forfeited\r\ntheir claim to those rights of hospitality, which civilized nations\r\nextend to each other. Not only a sense of justice due to the individuals\r\ninterested in those prizes, but also an earnest desire that no subject\r\nof discontent may check the cultivation and progress of that friendship,\r\nwhich they wish may subsist and increase between the two countries,\r\nprompt them to remind his Majesty of the transaction in question; and\r\nthey flatter themselves, that his Majesty will concur with them in\r\nthinking, that as restitution of the prizes is not practicable, it is\r\nreasonable and just that he should render, and that they should accept,\r\na compensation equivalent to the value of them. And the same principles\r\nof justice towards the parties, and of amity to the United States,\r\nwhich influenced the breast of his Majesty to make, through the Baron de\r\nWaltersdorff, the proposition of a particular sum, will surely lead him\r\nto restore their full value, if that were greater, as is believed, than\r\nthe sum proposed. In order to obtain, therefore, a final arrangement of\r\nthis demand, Congress have authorized me to depute a special agent to\r\nCopenhagen, to attend the pleasure of his Majesty. No agent could be so\r\nadequate to this business, as the Commodore Paul Jones, who commanded\r\nthe squadron which took the prizes. He will therefore have the honor\r\nof delivering this letter to your Excellency, in person; of giving such\r\ninformation as may be material, relative to the whole transaction; of\r\nentering into conferences for its final adjustment; and being himself\r\nprincipally interested, not only in his own right, but as the natural\r\npatron of those who fought under him, whatever shall be satisfactory\r\nto him, will have a great right to that ultimate approbation, which\r\nCongress have been pleased to confide to me.\r\n\r\nI beg your Excellency to accept the homage of that respect, which your\r\nexalted station, talents, and merit impress, as well as those sentiments\r\nof esteem and regard, with which I have the honor to be\r\n\r\nYour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIII.--TO WILLIAM RUTLEDGE, February 2, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nParis, February 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI should have sooner answered your favor of January the 2nd, but that we\r\nhave expected for some time, to see you here. I beg you not to think of\r\nthe trifle I furnished you with, nor to propose to return it, till you\r\nshall have that sum more than you know what to do with. And on every\r\nother occasion of difficulty, I hope you will make use of me freely.\r\nI presume you will now remain at London, to see the trial of Hastings.\r\nWithout suffering yourself to be imposed on by the pomp in which it\r\nwill be enveloped, I would recommend to you to consider and decide for\r\nyourself these questions. If his offence is to be decided by the law of\r\nthe land, why is he not tried in that court in which his fellow citizens\r\nare tried, that is, the King’s Bench? If he is cited before another\r\ncourt, that he may be judged, not according to the law of the land, but\r\nby the discretion of his judges, is he not disfranchised of his most\r\nprecious right, the benefit of the laws of his country, in common\r\nwith his fellow citizens? I think you will find, in investigating this\r\nsubject, that every solid argument is against the extraordinary court,\r\nand that every one in its favor is specious only. It is a transfer from\r\na judicature of learning and integrity, to one, the greatness of which\r\nis both illiterate and unprincipled. Yet such is the force of prejudice\r\nwith some, and of the want of reflection in others, that many of our\r\nconstitutions have copied this absurdity, without suspecting it to be\r\none. I am glad to hear that our new constitution is pretty sure of being\r\naccepted by States enough to secure the good it contains, and to meet\r\nwith such opposition in some others, as to give us hopes it will be\r\naccommodated to them, by the amendment of its most glaring faults,\r\nparticularly the want of a declaration of rights.\r\n\r\nThe long expected edict for the Protestants at length appears here.\r\nIts analysis is this. It is an acknowledgment (hitherto withheld by the\r\nlaws) that Protestants can beget children, and that they can die, and be\r\noffensive unless buried. It does not give them permission to think, to\r\nspeak, or to worship. It enumerates the humiliations to which they shall\r\nremain subject, and the burthens to which they shall continue to be\r\nunjustly exposed. What are we to think of the condition of the human\r\nmind in a country, where such a wretched thing as this has thrown the\r\nState into convulsions, and how must we bless our own situation in a\r\ncountry, the most illiterate peasant of which is a Solon, compared\r\nwith the authors of this law. There is modesty often, which does\r\nitself injury; our countrymen possess this. They do not know their own\r\nsuperiority. You see it; you are young, you have time and talents to\r\ncorrect them. Study the subject while in Europe, in all the instances\r\nwhich will present themselves to you, and profit your countrymen of\r\nthem, by making them to know and value themselves.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the esteem with which I am your\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIV.--TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY, Feb. 7, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nParis, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nYour favors of November the 10th and 13th, and December the 5th, have\r\nbeen duly received. Commodore Jones left this place for Copenhagen,\r\nthe 5th instant, to carry into execution the resolution of Congress, of\r\nOctober the 25th. Whatever monies that court shall be willing to allow,\r\nshall be remitted to your bankers, either in Amsterdam or Paris, as\r\nshall be found most beneficial, allowing previously to be withdrawn\r\nCommodore Jones’s proportion, which will be necessary for his\r\nsubsistence. I desired him to endeavor to prevail on the Danish\r\nminister, to have the money paid in Amsterdam or Paris, by their banker\r\nin either of those cities, if they have one.\r\n\r\nM. Ast (secretary to the consulate) is at L’Orient. Whether he comes up\r\nwith the papers, or sends them, they shall be received, sealed up, and\r\ntaken care of. I will only ask the favor of you, that I may never be\r\ndesired to break the seals, unless very important cause for it should\r\narise.\r\n\r\nI have just received from Messrs. Willincks and Van Staphorsts, a\r\nletter of January the 31st, in which are these words: ‘The official\r\ncommunication we have of the actual situation and prospect of the\r\nfinances of the United States, would render such a partial payment as\r\nthat to Fiseaux’s house of no avail towards the support of the public\r\ncredit, unless effectual measures shall be adopted, to provide funds for\r\nthe two hundred and seventy thousand florins, interest, that will be due\r\nthe first of June next; a single day’s retard in which would ground a\r\nprejudice of long duration.’ They informed me, at the same time, that\r\nthey have made to you the following communication; that Mr. Stanitski,\r\nour principal broker, and holder of thirteen hundred and forty thousand\r\ndollars, of certificates of our domestic debt, offers to have our loan\r\nof a million of guilders (of which six hundred and twenty-two thousand\r\neight hundred and forty are still unfilled) immediately made up, on\r\ncondition that he may retain thereout one hundred and eighty thousand\r\nguilders, being one year’s interest on his certificates, allowing a\r\ndeduction of ten per cent, from his said interest, as a compensation\r\nfor his receiving it in Amsterdam instead of America, and not pretending\r\nthat this shall give him any title to ask any payment of future interest\r\nin Europe. They observe, that this will enable them to face the demands\r\nof Dutch interest, till the 1st of June, 1789, pay the principal of\r\nFiseaux’ debt, and supply the current expenses of your legation in\r\nEurope. On these points, it is for you to decide. I will only take the\r\nliberty to observe, that if they shall receive your acceptance of the\r\nproposition, some days credit will still be to be given for producing\r\nthe cash, and that this must be produced fifteen days before it is\r\nwanting, because that much previous notice is always given to the\r\ncreditors, that their money is ready. It is, therefore, but three months\r\nfrom this day, before your answer should be in Amsterdam. It might\r\nanswer a useful purpose also, could I receive a communication of that\r\nanswer ten days earlier than they. The same stagnation attending our\r\npassage from the old to the new form of government, which stops the\r\nfeeble channel of money hitherto flowing towards our treasury, has\r\nsuspended also what foreign credit we had. So that, at this moment, we\r\nmay consider the progress of our loan as stopped. Though much an\r\nenemy to the system of borrowing, yet I feel strongly the necessity of\r\npreserving the power to borrow. Without this, we might be overwhelmed by\r\nanother nation, merely by the force of its credit. However, you can best\r\njudge whether the payment of a single year’s interest on Stanitski’s\r\ncertificates, in Europe, instead of America, may be more injurious to\r\nus than the shock of our credit in Amsterdam, which may be produced by a\r\nfailure to pay our interest.\r\n\r\nI have only to offer any services which I can render in this business,\r\neither here or by going to Holland, at a moment’s warning, if that\r\nshould be necessary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXV.--TO DOCTOR PRICE, February 7, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRICE.\r\n\r\nParis, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is rendering mutual service to men of virtue and understanding,\r\nto make them acquainted with one another. I need no other apology for\r\npresenting to your notice the bearer hereof, Mr. Barlow. I know you\r\nwere among the first who read the “Vision of Columbus,” while yet in\r\nmanuscript: and think the sentiments I heard you express of that poem,\r\nwill induce you to be pleased with the acquaintance of their author. He\r\ncomes to pass a few days only at London, merely to know something of it.\r\nAs I have little acquaintance there, I cannot do better for him than to\r\nask you to be so good as to make him known to such persons, as his turn\r\nand his time might render desirable to him.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the volume you were so kind as to send me some time\r\nago. Every thing you write is precious, and this volume is on the most\r\nprecious of all our concerns. We may well admit morality to be the child\r\nof the understanding rather than of the senses, when we observe that\r\nit becomes dearer to us as the latter weaken, and as the former grows\r\nstronger by time and experience, till the hour arrives in which all\r\nother objects lose all their value. That that hour may be distant with\r\nyou, my friend, and that the intermediate space may be filled with\r\nhealth and happiness, is the sincere prayer of him who is, with\r\nsentiments of great respect and friendship, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVI.--TO A. DONALD, February.7, 1788\r\n\r\nTO A. DONALD.\r\n\r\nParis, February.7, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received duly your friendly letter of November the 12th. By this time,\r\nyou will have seen published by Congress, the new regulations obtained\r\nfrom this court, in favor of our commerce. You will observe, that the\r\narrangement relative to tobacco is a continuation of the order of Berni\r\nfor five years, only leaving the price to be settled between the\r\nbuyer and seller. You will see too, that all contracts for tobacco are\r\nforbidden, till it arrives in France. Of course, your proposition for a\r\ncontract is precluded.\r\n\r\nI fear the prices here will be low, especially if the market be crowded.\r\nYou should be particularly attentive to the article, which requires that\r\nthe tobacco should come in French or American bottoms, as this article\r\nwill, in no instance, be departed from.\r\n\r\nI wish with all my soul, that the nine first conventions may accept the\r\nnew constitution, because this will secure to us the good it contains,\r\nwhich I think great and important. But I equally wish, that the four\r\nlatest conventions, which ever they be, may refuse to accede to it,\r\ntill a declaration of rights be annexed. This would probably command the\r\noffer of such a declaration, and thus give to the whole fabric, perhaps,\r\nas much perfection as any one of that kind ever had. By a declaration of\r\nrights, I mean one which shall stipulate freedom of religion, freedom\r\nof the press, freedom of commerce against monopolies, trial by juries\r\nin all cases, no suspensions of the _habeas corpus_, no standing armies.\r\nThese are fetters against doing evil, which no honest government should\r\ndecline. There is another strong feature in the new constitution, which\r\nI as strongly dislike. That is, the perpetual re-eligibility of the\r\nPresident. Of this I expect no amendment at present, because I do not\r\nsee that any body has objected to it on your side the water. But it will\r\nbe productive of cruel distress to our country, even in your day and\r\nmine. The importance to France and England, to have our government in\r\nthe hands of a friend or foe, will occasion their interference by money,\r\nand even by arms. Our President will be of much more consequence to them\r\nthan a King of Poland. We must take care, however, that neither this,\r\nnor any other objection to the new form, produces a schism in our Union.\r\nThat would be an incurable evil, because near friends falling out, never\r\nre-unite cordially; whereas, all of us going together, we shall be sure\r\nto cure the evils of our new constitution, before they do great harm.\r\nThe box of books I had taken the liberty to address to you, is but just\r\ngone from Havre for New York. I do not see, at present, any symptoms\r\nstrongly indicating war. It is true, that the distrust existing between\r\nthe two courts of Versailles and London, is so great, that they can\r\nscarcely do business together. However, the difficulty and doubt\r\nof obtaining money make both afraid to enter into war. The little\r\npreparations for war, which we see, are the effect of distrust, rather\r\nthan of a design to commence hostilities. And in such a state of mind,\r\nyou know, small things may produce a rupture: so that though peace is\r\nrather probable, war is very possible.\r\n\r\nYour letter has kindled all the fond recollections of ancient times;\r\nrecollections much dearer to me than any thing I have known since. There\r\nare minds which can be pleased by honors and preferments; but I see\r\nnothing in them but envy and enmity. It is only necessary to possess\r\nthem, to know how little they contribute to happiness, or rather how\r\nhostile they are to it. No attachments soothe the mind so much as those\r\ncontracted in early life; nor do I recollect any societies which have\r\ngiven me more pleasure, than those of which you have partaken with me.\r\n1 had rather be shut up in a very modest cottage, with my books, my\r\nfamily, and a few old friends, dining on simple bacon, and letting the\r\nworld roll on as it liked, than to occupy the most splendid post, which\r\nany human power can give. I shall be glad to hear from you often. Give\r\nme the small news as well as the great. Tell Dr. Currie, that I believe\r\nI am indebted to him a letter, but that like the mass of our countrymen,\r\nI am not, at this moment, able to pay all my debts; the post being to\r\ndepart in an hour, and the last stroke of a pen I am able to send by it,\r\nbeing that which assures you of the sentiments of esteem and attachment,\r\nwith which I am, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVII.--TO M. WARVILLE, February 12, 1888\r\n\r\nTO M. WARVILLE.\r\n\r\nParis, February 12, 1888.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am very sensible of the honor you propose to me, of becoming a member\r\nof the society for the abolition of the slave-trade. You know that\r\nnobody wishes more ardently, to see an abolition, not only of the trade,\r\nbut of the condition of slavery: and certainly nobody will be more\r\nwilling to encounter every sacrifice for that object. But the influence\r\nand information of the friends to this proposition in France will be\r\nfar above the need of my association. I am here as a public servant,\r\nand those whom I serve, having never yet been able to give their\r\nvoice against the practice, it is decent for me to avoid too public\r\na demonstration of my wishes to see it abolished. Without serving the\r\ncause here, it might render me less able to serve it beyond the water. I\r\ntrust you will be sensible of the prudence of those motives, therefore,\r\nwhich govern my conduct on this occasion, and be assured of my wishes\r\nfor the success of your undertaking, and the sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, March 2, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, March 2, 1788.--Sunday.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received this day, a letter from Mrs. Adams, of the 26th ultimo,\r\ninforming me you would set out on the 29th for the Hague. Our affairs at\r\nAmsterdam press on my mind like a mountain. I have no information to\r\ngo on, but that of Willincks and Van Staphorsts, and according to that,\r\nsomething seems necessary to be done. I am so anxious to confer with\r\nyou on this subject, and to see you and them together, and get some\r\neffectual arrangement made in time, that I determine to meet you at the\r\nHague. I will set out the moment some repairs are made to my carriage:\r\nit is promised me at three o’clock to-morrow; but probably they will\r\nmake it night, and that I may not set out till Tuesday morning. In that\r\ncase, I shall be at the Hague on Friday night: in the mean time, you\r\nwill perhaps have made all your bows there. I am sensible how irksome\r\nthis must be to you, in the moment of your departure. But it is a great\r\ninterest of the United States, which is at stake, and I am sure you will\r\nsacrifice to that your feelings and your interest. I hope to shake you\r\nby the hand within twenty-four hours after you receive this; and in\r\nthe mean time, I am, with much esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIX.--TO JOHN JAY, March 16, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nAmsterdam, March 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn a letter of the 13th instant, which I had the honor of addressing you\r\nfrom this place, I mentioned in general terms, the object of my journey\r\nhither, and that I should enter into more particular details, by the\r\nconfidential conveyance which would occur through Mr. Adams and Colonel\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nThe board of treasury had, in the month of December, informed me and\r\nour bankers here, that it would be impossible for them to make any\r\nremittances to Europe for the then ensuing year, and that they must,\r\ntherefore, rely altogether on the progress of the late loan. But this,\r\nin the mean time, after being about one third filled, had ceased to\r\nget forward. The bankers who had been referred to me for advice, by Mr.\r\nAdams, stated these circumstances, and pressed their apprehension for\r\nthe ensuing month of June, when two hundred and seventy thousand florins\r\nwould be wanting for interest. In fine, they urged an offer of the\r\nholders of the former bonds, to take all those remaining on hand,\r\nprovided they might receive out of them the interest on a part of our\r\ndomestic debt, of which they had also become the holders. This would\r\nhave been one hundred and eighty thousand florins. To this proposition,\r\nI could not presume any authority to listen. Thus pressed between the\r\ndanger of failure on one hand, and this proposition on the other, I\r\nheard of Mr. Adams being gone to the Hague to take leave. His knowledge\r\nof the subject was too valuable to be neglected under the present\r\ndifficulty, and it was the last moment in which we could be availed of\r\nit. I set out immediately, therefore, for the Hague, and we came on to\r\nthis place together, in order to see what could be done. It was easier\r\nto discover, than to remove, the causes which obstructed the progress\r\nof the loan. Our affairs here, like those of other nations, are in the\r\nhands of particular bankers. These employ particular, and they have\r\ntheir particular circle of money-lenders. These moneylenders, as I have\r\nbefore mentioned, while placing a part of their money in our\r\nforeign loans, had at the same time employed another part in a joint\r\nspeculation, to the amount of eight hundred and forty thousand dollars,\r\nin our domestic debt. A year’s interest was becoming due on this, and\r\nthey wished to avail themselves of our want of money for the foreign\r\ninterest, to obtain payment of the domestic. Our first object was to\r\nconvince our bankers, that there was no power on this side the Atlantic\r\nwhich could accede to this proposition, or give it any countenance. They\r\nat length, therefore, but with difficulty, receded from this ground, and\r\nagreed to enter into conferences with the brokers and lenders, and to\r\nuse every exertion to clear the loan from the embarrassment in which\r\nthis speculation had engaged it. What will be the result of these\r\nconferences, is not yet known. We have hopes, however, that it is not\r\ndesperate, because the bankers consented yesterday, to pay off the\r\ncapital of fifty-one thousand florins, which had become due on the first\r\nday of January, and which had not yet been paid. We have gone still\r\nfurther. The treasury board gives no hope of remittances, till the new\r\ngovernment can procure them. For that government to be adopted, its\r\nlegislature assembled, its system of taxation and collection arranged,\r\nthe money gathered from the people into the treasury, and then remitted\r\nto Europe, must extend considerably into the year 1790. To secure our\r\ncredit then, for the present year only, is but to put off the evil day\r\nto the next. What remains of the last loan, when it shall be filled up,\r\nwill little more than clear us of present demands, as may be seen by the\r\nestimate enclosed. We thought it better, therefore, to provide at once\r\nfor the years 1789 and 1790 also; and thus to place the government at\r\nits ease, and her credit in security, during that trying interval.\r\nThe same estimate will show, that another million of florins will be\r\nnecessary to effect this. We stated this to our bankers, who concurred\r\nin our views, and that to ask the whole sum at once would be better than\r\nto make demands from time to time, so small, as that they betray to\r\nthe money-holders the extreme feebleness of our resources. Mr. Adams,\r\ntherefore, has executed bonds for another million of florins; which,\r\nhowever, are to remain unissued till Congress shall have ratified\r\nthe measure that this transaction is something or nothing, at their\r\npleasure. We suppose its expediency so apparent, as to leave little\r\ndoubt of its ratification. In this case, much time will have been saved\r\nby the execution of the bonds at this moment, and the proposition will\r\nbe presented here under a more favorable appearance, according to the\r\nopinion of the bankers. Mr. Adams is under a necessity of setting out\r\nto-morrow morning, but I shall stay two or three days longer, to attend\r\nto and encourage the efforts of the bankers; though it is yet doubtful\r\nwhether they will ensure us a safe passage over the month of June. Not\r\nhaving my letters here to turn to, I am unable to say whether the last I\r\nwrote, mentioned the declaration of the Emperor that he should take part\r\nin the war against the Turks. This declaration appeared a little before,\r\nor a little after that letter, I do not recollect which. Some little\r\nhostilities have taken place between them. The court of Versailles seems\r\nto pursue immoveably its pacific system, and from every appearance in\r\nthe country from which I write, we must conclude that its tragedy is\r\nwound up. The triumph appears complete, and tranquillity perfectly\r\nestablished. The numbers who have emigrated are differently estimated,\r\nfrom twenty to forty thousand. A little before I left Paris, I received\r\na piece of intelligence, which should be communicated, leaving you to\r\nlay what stress on it, it may seem to deserve. Its authenticity may be\r\nsurely relied on. At the time of the late pacification, Spain had about\r\nfifteen ships of the line nearly ready for sea. The convention\r\nfor disarming did not extend to her, nor did she disarm. This gave\r\ninquietude to the court of London, and they demanded an explanation.\r\nOne was given, they say, which is perfectly satisfactory. The Russian\r\nminister at Versailles, getting knowledge of this, became suspicious\r\non his part. He recollected that Spain, during the late war, had been\r\nopposed to the entrance of a Russian fleet into the Mediterranean, and\r\nconcluded, if England was not the object of this armament, Russia\r\nmight be. It is known that that power means to send a fleet of about\r\ntwenty-four ships into the Mediterranean this summer. He sent to the\r\nCount de Montmorin, and expressed his apprehensions. The Count de\r\nMontmorin declared, that the object of Spain in that armament was\r\ntotally different; that he was not sure she would succeed; but that\r\nFrance and Spain were to be considered as one, and that the former would\r\nbecome guarantee for the latter, that she would make no opposition to\r\nthe Russian fleet. If neither England nor Russia be the object, the\r\nquestion recurs, Who is it for? You know best, if our affairs with Spain\r\nare in a situation to give jealousy to either of us. I think it very\r\npossible, that the satisfaction of the court of London may have been\r\npretended or premature. It is possible also, that the affairs of Spain\r\nin South America may require them to assume a threatening appearance. I\r\ngive you the facts, however, and you will judge whether they are objects\r\nof attention or of mere curiosity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. I enclose herewith an extract of a letter from the Count de\r\nVergennes to the French ambassador at the Hague, which will make a\r\nremarkable chapter in the history of the late revolution here. It is not\r\npublic, nor should be made so by us. Probably those who have been the\r\nvictims of it, will some day publish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXX.--TO MR. DUMAS, March 29, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nAmsterdam, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 14th, 18th,\r\nand 23rd instant. I would have preferred doing it in person, but the\r\nseason, and the desire of seeing what I have not yet seen, invite me to\r\ntake the route of the Rhine. I shall leave this place to-morrow morning,\r\nand probably not reach Paris till the latter end of April. In the moment\r\nwe were to have conferred on the subject of paying the arrears due to\r\nyou, a letter of the 20th of February, from the board of treasury, was\r\nreceived, forbidding the application of money to any purpose, (except\r\nour current claims,) till the June interest should be actually in hand.\r\nBeing by the letter, tied up from giving an order in your favor, I\r\nreturn you the letter you had written to Mr. Jay, on the supposition\r\nthat the order for your arrears was given. It has been suggested,\r\nhowever, that if you could receive bonds of the loan, you could make\r\nthem answer your purpose, and the commissioners say, this would in no\r\nwise interfere with the views of the treasury board, nor the provision\r\nfor the June interest. I have, therefore, recommended to them in\r\nwriting, to give you bonds to the amount of your balance, if you choose\r\nto take them, rather than to wait. I wish this may answer your purpose.\r\nI remember that in the conversation which I had the honor of having with\r\nyou, on the evening I was at the Hague, you said that your enemies had\r\nendeavored to have it believed, that Congress would abandon you, and\r\nwithdraw your appointments. An enemy generally says and believes what\r\nhe wishes, and your enemies, particularly, are not those who are most in\r\nthe counsels of Congress, nor the best qualified to tell what Congress\r\nwill do. From the evidences you have received of their approbation, and\r\nfrom their well known steadiness and justice, you must be assured of\r\na continuance of their favor, were they to continue under the present\r\nform. Nor do I see any thing in the new government which threatens us\r\nwith less firmness. The Senate, who will make and remove their foreign\r\nofficers, must, from its constitution, be a wise and steady body.\r\nNor would a new government begin its administration by discarding old\r\nservants; servants who have put all to the risk, and when the risk was\r\ngreat, to obtain that freedom and security under which themselves\r\nwill be what they shall be. Upon the whole, my Dear Sir, tranquillize\r\nyourself and your family upon this subject. All the evidence, which\r\nexists as yet, authorizes you to do this, nor can I foresee any cause\r\nof disquiet in future. That none may arise, that yourself and family may\r\nenjoy health, happiness, and the continued approbation of those by whom\r\nyou wish most to be approved, is the sincere wish of him, who has the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and attachment, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXI.--TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY, March 29, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nAmsterdam, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI cannot close my letter, without some observations on the transfer of\r\nour domestic debt to foreigners. This circumstance, and the failure to\r\npay off Fiseaux’ loan, were the sole causes of the stagnation of our\r\nlate loan. For otherwise our credit would have stood on more hopeful\r\ngrounds than heretofore. There was a condition in the last loan, that,\r\nthe lenders furnishing one third of the money, the remaining two thirds\r\nof the bonds should remain eighteen months unsold, and at their option\r\nto take or not, and that in the mean time, the same bankers should\r\nopen no other loan for us. These same lenders became purchasers of our\r\ndomestic debt, and they were disposed to avail themselves of the power\r\nthey had thus acquired over us as to our foreign demands, to make us\r\npay the domestic one. Should the present necessities have obliged you\r\nto comply with their proposition for the present year, I should be of\r\nopinion it ought to be the last instance. If the transfer of these debts\r\nto Europe meet with any encouragement from us, we can no more borrow\r\nmoney here, let our necessities be what they will. For who will give\r\nninety-six per cent, for the foreign obligations of the same nation,\r\nwhose domestic ones can be bought at the same market for fifty-five\r\nper cent.; the former, too, bearing an interest of only five per cent.,\r\nwhile the latter yields six. If any discouragements can be honestly\r\nthrown on this transfer, it would seem advisable, in order to keep the\r\ndomestic debt at home. It would be a very effectual one, if, instead of\r\nthe title existing in our treasury books alone, it was made to exist\r\nin loose papers, as our loan office debts do. The European holder would\r\nthen be obliged to risk the title paper of his capital, as well as his\r\ninterest, in the hands of his agent in America, whenever the interest\r\nwas to be demanded; whereas, at present, he trusts him with the interest\r\nonly. This single circumstance would put a total stop to all future\r\nsales of domestic debt at this market. Whether this, or any other\r\nobstruction, can or should be thrown in the way of these operations,\r\nis not for me to decide; but I have thought the subject worthy your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, May 2, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, May 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am honored with your Excellency’s letter by the last packet, and thank\r\nyou for the information it contains on the communication between the\r\nCayahoga and Big Beaver. I have ever considered the opening a canal\r\nbetween those two water courses, as the most important work in that\r\nline, which the state of Virginia could undertake. If will infallibly\r\nturn through the Potomac all the commerce of Lake Erie, and the country\r\nwest of that, except what may pass down the Mississippi; and it is\r\nimportant that it be soon done, lest that commerce should, in the mean\r\ntime, get established in another channel. Having, in the spring of the\r\nlast year, taken a journey through the southern parts of France, and\r\nparticularly examined the canal of Languedoc, through its whole course,\r\nI take the liberty of sending you the notes I made on the spot, as you\r\nmay find in them something perhaps, which may be turned to account, some\r\ntime or other, in the prosecution of the Potomac canal. Being merely a\r\ncopy from my travelling notes, they are undigested and imperfect, but\r\nmay still, perhaps, give hints capable of improvement in your mind.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Europe are in such a state still, that it is impossible\r\nto say what form they will take ultimately. France and Prussia, viewing\r\nthe Emperor as their most dangerous and common enemy, had heretofore\r\nseen their common safety as depending on a strict connection with\r\none another. This had naturally inclined the Emperor to the scale\r\nof England, and the Empress also, as having views in common with the\r\nEmperor, against the Turks. But these two powers would, at any time,\r\nhave gladly quitted England, to coalesce with France, as being the power\r\nwhich they met every where, opposed as a barrier to all their schemes\r\nof aggrandizement. When, therefore, the present King of Prussia took\r\nthe eccentric measure of bidding defiance to France, by placing his\r\nbrother-in-law on the throne of Holland, the two empires immediately\r\nseized the occasion of soliciting an alliance with France. The motives\r\nfor this appeared so plausible, that it was believed the latter would\r\nhave entered into this alliance, and that thus the whole political\r\nsystem of Europe would have taken a new form. What has prevented this\r\ncourt from coming into it, we know not. The unmeasurable ambition of the\r\nEmperor, and his total want of moral principle and honor, are suspected.\r\nA great share of Turkey, the recovery of Silesia, the consolidation of\r\nhis dominions by the Bavarian exchange, the liberties of the Germanic\r\nbody, all occupy his mind together; and his head is not well enough\r\norganized, to pursue so much only of all this, as is practicable.\r\nStill it was thought that France might safely have coalesced with these\r\npowers, because Russia and herself holding close together, as their\r\ninterests would naturally dictate, the Emperor could never stir, but\r\nwith their permission. France seems, however, to have taken the worst\r\nof all parties, that is, none at all. She folds her arms, lets the\r\ntwo empires go to work to cut up Turkey as they can, and holds Prussia\r\naloof, neither as a friend nor foe. This is withdrawing her opposition\r\nfrom the two empires, without the benefit of any condition whatever. In\r\nthe mean time, England has clearly overreached herself. She excited\r\nthe war between the Russians and Turks, in hopes that France, still\r\nsupporting the Turks, would be embarrassed with the two empires. She did\r\nnot foresee the event which has taken place, of France abandoning the\r\nTurks, and that which may take place, of her union with the two empires.\r\nShe allied herself with Holland, but cannot obtain the alliance of\r\nPrussia. This latter power would be very glad to close again the breach\r\nwith France, and therefore, while there remains an opening for this,\r\nholds off from England, whose fleets could not enter into Silesia, to\r\nprotect that from the Emperor. Thus you see, that the old system is\r\nunhinged, and no new one hung in its place. Probabilities are rather\r\nin favor of a connection between the two empires, France, and Spain.\r\nSeveral symptoms show themselves, of friendly dispositions between\r\nRussia and France, unfriendly ones between Russia and England, and such\r\nas are barely short of hostility between England and France. But into\r\nreal hostilities, this country would with difficulty be drawn. Her\r\nfinances are too deranged, her internal union too much dissolved, to\r\nhazard a war. The nation is pressing on fast, to a fixed constitution.\r\nSuch a revolution in the public opinion has taken place, that the crown\r\nalready feels its powers bounded, and is obliged, by its measures, to\r\nacknowledge limits.\r\n\r\nA States-General will be called at some epoch not distant; they will\r\nprobably establish a civil list, and leave the government to temporary\r\nprovisions of money, so as to render frequent assemblies of the national\r\nrepresentative necessary. How that representative will be organized, is\r\nyet uncertain. Among a thousand projects, the best seems to me, that of\r\ndividing them into two Houses, of Commons and Nobles; the Commons to be\r\nchosen by the Provincial Assemblies, who are chosen themselves by the\r\npeople, and the Nobles by the body of _Noblesse_, as in Scotland. But\r\nthere is no reason to conjecture, that this is the particular scheme\r\nwhich will be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe war between the Russians and Turks has made an opening for our\r\nCommodore Paul Jones. The Empress has invited him into her service.\r\nShe insures to him the rank of rear-admiral; will give him a separate\r\ncommand, and it is understood, that he is never to be commanded. I think\r\nshe means to oppose him to the Captain Pacha, on the Black Sea. He is by\r\nthis time, probably, at St. Petersburg. The circumstances did not permit\r\nhis awaiting the permission of Congress, because the season was close at\r\nhand for opening the campaign. But he has made it a condition, that he\r\nshall be free at all times to return to the orders of Congress, whenever\r\nthey shall please to call for him; and also, that he shall not, in any\r\ncase be expected to bear arms against France. I believe Congress had it\r\nin contemplation to give him the grade of admiral, from the date of\r\nhis taking the Serapis. Such a measure now, would greatly gratify him,\r\nsecond the efforts of fortune in his favor, and better the opportunities\r\nof improving him for our service, whenever the moment shall come in\r\nwhich we may want him.\r\n\r\nThe danger of our incurring something like a bankruptcy in Holland,\r\nwhich might have been long, and even fatally felt in a moment of crisis,\r\ninduced me to take advantage of Mr. Adams’s journey to take leave at\r\nthe Hague, to meet him there, get him to go on to Amsterdam, and try to\r\navert the impending danger. The moment of paying a great sum of annual\r\ninterest was approaching. There was no money on hand; the board of\r\ntreasury had notified that they could not remit any; and the progress\r\nof the loan, which had been opened there, had absolutely stopped.\r\nOur bankers there gave me notice of all this; and that a single day’s\r\nfailure in the payment of interest, would have the most fatal effect\r\non our credit. I am happy to inform you, we were able to set the loan\r\na going again, and that the evil is at least postponed. Indeed, I am\r\ntolerably satisfied, that if the measures we proposed, are ratified\r\nby Congress, all European calls for money (except the French debt)\r\nare secure enough, till the end of the year 1790; by which time, we\r\ncalculated that the new government might be able to get money into\r\nthe treasury. Much conversation with the bankers, brokers, and\r\nmoney-holders, gave me insight into the state of national credit there,\r\nwhich I had never before been able satisfactorily to get. The English\r\ncredit is the first, because they never open a loan, without laying and\r\nappropriating taxes for the payment of the interest, and there has never\r\nbeen an instance of their failing one day, in that payment. The Emperor\r\nand Empress have good credit, because they use it little, and have\r\nhitherto been very punctual. This country is among the lowest, in point\r\nof credit. Ours stands in hope only. They consider us as the surest\r\nnation on earth for the repayment of the capital; but as the punctual\r\npayment of interest is of absolute necessity in their arrangements,\r\nwe cannot borrow but with difficulty and disadvantage. The monied\r\nmen, however, look towards our new government with a great degree of\r\npartiality, and even anxiety. If they see that set out on the English\r\nplan, the first degree of credit will be transferred to us. A favorable\r\noccasion will arise to our new government of asserting this ground to\r\nthemselves. The transfer of the French debt, public and private,\r\nto Amsterdam, is certainly desirable. An act of the new government,\r\ntherefore, for opening a loan in Holland for the purpose, laying taxes\r\nat the same time for paying annually the interest and a part of the\r\nprincipal, will answer the two valuable purposes, of ascertaining the\r\ndegree of our credit, and of removing those causes of bickering and\r\nirritation, which should never be permitted to subsist with a nation,\r\nwith which it is so much our interest to be on cordial terms as with\r\nFrance. A very small portion of this debt, I mean that part due to the\r\nFrench officers, has done us an injury, of which those in office in\r\nAmerica cannot have an idea. The interest is unpaid for the last three\r\nyears; and these creditors, highly connected, and at the same time\r\nneedy, have felt and communicated hard thoughts of us. Borrowing, as we\r\nhave done, three hundred thousand florins a year, to pay our interest\r\nin Holland, it would have been worth while to have added twenty thousand\r\nmore, to suppress those clamors. I am anxious about every thing which\r\nmay affect our credit. My wish would be, to possess it in the highest\r\ndegree, but to use it little. Were we without credit, we might be\r\ncrushed by a nation of much inferior resources, but possessing higher\r\ncredit. The present system of war renders it necessary to make exertions\r\nfar beyond the annual resources of the State, and consume in one year\r\nthe efforts of many. And this system we cannot change. It remains, then,\r\nthat we cultivate our credit with the utmost attention.\r\n\r\nI had intended to have written a word to your Excellency on the subject\r\nof the new constitution, but I have already spun out my letter to an\r\nimmoderate length. I will just observe, therefore, that according to\r\nmy ideas, there is a great deal of good in it. There are two things,\r\nhowever, which I dislike strongly, 1. The want of a declaration of\r\nrights. I am in hopes the opposition in Virginia will remedy this,\r\nand produce such a declaration. 2. The perpetual re-eligibility of the\r\nPresident. This, I fear, will make that an office for life, first, and\r\nthen hereditary. I was much an enemy to monarchies before I came to\r\nEurope. I am ten thousand times more so, since I have seen what they\r\nare. There is scarcely an evil known in these countries, which may not\r\nbe traced to their king, as its source, nor a good, which is not derived\r\nfrom the small fibres of republicanism existing among them. I can\r\nfurther say, with safety, there is not a crowned head in Europe, whose\r\ntalents or merits would entitle him to be elected a vestryman by the\r\npeople of any parish in America. However, I shall hope, that before\r\nthere is danger of this change taking place in the office of President,\r\nthe good sense and free spirit of our countrymen will make the changes\r\nnecessary to prevent it. Under this hope, I look forward to the general\r\nadoption of the new constitution with anxiety, as necessary for us under\r\nour present circumstances. I have so much trespassed on your patience\r\nalready, by the length of this letter, that I will add nothing further,\r\nthan those assurances of sincere esteem and attachment, with which I\r\nhave the honor to be, your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, May 3,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, May 3,1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMine of February the 6th acknowledged the receipt of yours of December\r\nthe 9th and 20th; since that, those of February the 19th and 20th have\r\ncome to hand. The present will be delivered you by Mr. Warville, whom\r\nyou will find truly estimable, and a great enthusiast for liberty. His\r\nwritings will have shown you this.\r\n\r\nFor public news, I must refer you to my letters to Mr. Jay. Those\r\nI wrote to him from Amsterdam will have informed you of my journey\r\nthither. While there, I endeavored to get, as well as I could, into the\r\nstate of national credit there; for though I am an enemy to the using\r\nour credit but under absolute necessity, yet the possessing a good\r\ncredit I consider as indispensable, in the present system of carrying on\r\nwar. The existence of a nation having no credit, is always precarious.\r\nThe credit of England is the best. Their paper sells at par on the\r\nexchange of Amsterdam, the moment any of it is offered, and they can\r\ncommand there any sum they please. The reason is, that they never\r\nborrow, without establishing taxes for the payment of the interest, and\r\nthey never yet failed one day in that payment. The Emperor and Empress\r\nhave good credit enough. They use it little and have been ever punctual.\r\nThis country cannot borrow at all there; for though they always pay\r\ntheir interest within the year, yet it is often some months behind. It\r\nis difficult to assign to our credit its exact station in this scale.\r\nThey consider us as the most certain nation on earth for the principal;\r\nbut they see that we borrow of themselves to pay the interest, so that\r\nthis is only a conversion of their interest into principal. Our paper,\r\nfor this reason, sells for from four to eight per cent, below par, on\r\nthe exchange, and our loans are negotiated with the Patriots only.\r\nBut the whole body of money-dealers, Patriot and Stadtholderian, look\r\nforward to our new government with a great degree of partiality and\r\ninterest. They are disposed to have much confidence in it, and it was\r\nthe prospect of its establishment, which enabled us to set the loan of\r\nlast year into motion again. They will attend steadfastly to its first\r\nmoney operations. If these are injudiciously begun, correction, whenever\r\nthey shall be corrected, will come too late. Our borrowings will always\r\nbe difficult and disadvantageous. If they begin well, our credit will\r\nimmediately take the first station. Equal provision for the interest,\r\nadding to it a certain prospect for the principal, will give us a\r\npreference to all nations, the English not excepted. The first act of\r\nthe new government should be some operation, whereby they may assume to\r\nthemselves this station. Their European debts form a proper subject for\r\nthis. Digest the whole, public and private, Dutch, French, and Spanish,\r\ninto a table, showing the sum of interest due every year, and the\r\nportions of principal payable the same year. Take the most certain\r\nbranch of revenue, and one which shall suffice to pay the interest, and\r\nleave such a surplus as may accomplish all the payments of the capital,\r\nas terms somewhat short of those, at which they will become due. Let the\r\nsurpluses of those years, in which no reimbursement of principal falls,\r\nbe applied to buy up our paper on the exchange of Amsterdam, and thus\r\nanticipate the demands of principal. In this way our paper will be kept\r\nup at par; and this alone will enable us to command in four and twenty\r\nhours, at any time, on the exchange of Amsterdam, as many millions as\r\nthat capital can produce. The same act which makes this provision for\r\nthe existing debts, should go on to open a loan to their whole amount;\r\nthe produce of that loan to be applied, as fast as received, to the\r\npayment of such parts of the existing debts as admit of payment. The\r\nrate of interest to be as the government should privately instruct their\r\nagent, because it must depend on the effect these measures would have on\r\nthe exchange. Probably it could be lowered from time to time. Honest and\r\nannual publications of the payments made, will inspire confidence, while\r\nsilence would conceal nothing from those interested to know.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the _comte rendu_ which I send you, that this\r\ncountry now calls seriously for its interest at least. The nonpayment\r\nof this, hitherto, has done our credit little injury, because the\r\ngovernment here, saying nothing about it, the public have supposed they\r\nwished to leave us at our ease as to the payment. It is now seen that\r\nthey call for it, and they will publish annually the effect of that\r\ncall. A failure here, therefore, will have the same effect on our credit\r\nhereafter, as a failure at Amsterdam. I consider it, then, as of a\r\nnecessity not to be dispensed with, that these calls be effectually\r\nprovided for. If it shall be seen, that the general provision before\r\nhinted at cannot be in time, then it is the present government which\r\nshould take on itself to borrow in Amsterdam what may be necessary. The\r\nnew government should by no means be left by the old to the necessity of\r\nborrowing a stiver, before it can tax for its interest. This will be\r\nto destroy the credit of the new government in its birth. And I am of\r\nopinion, that if the present Congress will add to the loan of a million\r\n(which Mr. Adams and myself have proposed this year) what may be\r\nnecessary for the French calls to the year 1790, the money can be\r\nobtained at the usual disadvantage. Though I have not at this\r\nmoment received such authentic information from our bankers as I may\r\ncommunicate to Congress, yet I know privately from one of them (Mr.\r\nJacob Van Staphorst, who is here), that they had on Hand a fortnight ago\r\nfour hundred thousand florins, and the sale going on well. So that the\r\nJune interest, which had been in so critical a predicament, was already\r\nsecured. If the loan of a million on Mr. Adams’s bonds of this year be\r\nratified by Congress, the applications of the money on hand may go on\r\nimmediately, according to the statement I sent to Mr. Jay. One article\r\nin this I must beg you to press on the treasury board; that is, an\r\nimmediate order for the payment of the three years’ arrearages to the\r\nFrench officers. They were about holding a meeting to take desperate\r\nmeasures on this subject, when I was called to Holland. I desired them\r\nto be quiet till my return, and since my return I have pressed a further\r\ntranquillity till July, by which time I have given them reason to hope I\r\nmay have an answer from the treasury board to my letters of March. Their\r\nill humor can be contained no longer; and as I know no reason why\r\nthey may not be paid at that time, I shall have nothing to urge in our\r\ndefence after that.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nYou remember the report, drawn by Governor Randolph, on the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi. When I came to Europe, Mr. Thomson was so kind as to\r\nhave me a copy of it made out. I lent it to Dr. Franklin, and he mislaid\r\nit, so that it could never be found. Could you make interest with him\r\nto have me another copy made, and send it to me? By Mr. Warville I send\r\nyour pedometer. To the loop at the bottom of it you must sew a tape, and\r\nat the other end of the tape a small hook (such as we use under the\r\nname of hooks and eyes), cut a little hole in the bottom of your left\r\nwatch-pocket, pass the hook and tape through it, and down between the\r\nbreeches and drawers, and fix the hook on the edge of your knee-band,\r\nan inch from the knee-buckle; then hook the instrument itself by its\r\nswivel-hook on the upper edge of the watch-pocket. Your tape being well\r\nadjusted in length, your double steps will be exactly counted by the\r\ninstrument, the shortest hand pointing out the thousands, the flat hand\r\nthe hundreds, and the long hand the tens and units. Never turn the hands\r\nbackward; indeed, it is best not to set them to any given place, but to\r\nnote the number they stand at when you begin to walk. The adjusting the\r\ntape to its exact length is a critical business, and will cost you many\r\ntrials. But once done, it is done for ever. The best way is to have a\r\nsmall buckle fixed on the middle of the tape, by which you can take\r\nit up, and let it out at pleasure. When you choose it should cease to\r\ncount, unhook it from the top of the watch-pocket, and let it fall down\r\nto the bottom of the pocket.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the most sincere esteem and attachment, Dear\r\nSir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIV.--TO JOHN JAY, May 4, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, May 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you in two letters of the 13th and 16th of\r\nMarch from Amsterdam, and have since received Mr. Ramson’s of February\r\nthe 20th. I staid at Amsterdam about ten or twelve days after the\r\ndeparture of Mr. Adams, in hopes of seeing the million of the last year\r\nfilled up. This, however, could not be accomplished on the spot. But\r\nthe prospect was so good as to have dissipated all fears; and since my\r\nreturn here, I learn (not officially from our bankers, but) through a\r\ngood channel, that they have received near four hundred thousand florins\r\nsince the date of the statement I sent you in my letter of March the\r\n16th; and I presume we need not fear the completion of that loan, which\r\nwill provide for all our purposes of the year 1788, as stated in\r\nthat paper. I hope, therefore, to receive from the treasury orders in\r\nconformity thereto, that I may be able to proceed to the redemption of\r\nour captives. A provision for the purposes of the years 1789 and 1790,\r\nas stated in the same paper, will depend on the ratification by Congress\r\nof Mr. Adams’s bonds of this year for another million of florins. But\r\nthere arises a new call from this government, for its interest at least.\r\nTheir silence hitherto has made it be believed in general, that they\r\nconsented to the nonpayment of our interest to them, in order to\r\naccommodate us. You will perceive in the seventy-fifth and seventy-sixth\r\npages of the _compte rendu_, which I have the honor to send you, that\r\nthey call for this interest, and will publish whether it be paid or not;\r\nand by No. 25, page eighty-one, that they count on its regular receipt\r\nfor the purposes of the year. These calls, for the first days of\r\nJanuary, 1789 and 1790, will amount to about a million and a half of\r\nflorins more; and if to be raised by loan, it must be for two millions,\r\nas well to cover the expenses of the loan, as that loans are not opened\r\nfor fractions of millions. This publication seems to render a provision\r\nfor this interest as necessary as for that of Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nI had taken measures to have it believed at Algiers, that our government\r\nwithdrew its attention from our captives there. This was to prepare\r\ntheir captors for the ransoming them at a reasonable price. I find,\r\nhowever, that Captain O’Bryan is apprized that I have received some\r\nauthority on this subject. He writes me a cruel letter, supposing me the\r\nobstacle to their redemption. Their own interest requires that I should\r\nleave them to think thus hardly of me. Were the views of government\r\ncommunicated to them, they could not keep their own secret, and such\r\na price would be demanded for them, as Congress, probably, would\r\nthink ought not to be given, lest it should be the cause of involving\r\nthousands of others of their citizens in the same condition. The moment\r\nI have money, the business shall be set in motion.\r\n\r\nBy a letter from Joseph Chiappe, our agent at Mogadore, I am notified of\r\na declaration of the Emperor of Morocco, that if the States General\r\nof the United Netherlands do not, before the month of May, send him an\r\nambassador, to let him know whether it is war or peace between them, he\r\nwill send one to them with five frigates; and that if their dispositions\r\nbe unfavorable, their frigates shall proceed to America to make prizes\r\non the Dutch, and to sell them there. It seems to depend on the Dutch,\r\ntherefore, whether the Barbary powers shall learn the way to our coasts,\r\nand whether we shall have to decide the question of the legality of\r\nselling in our ports vessels taken from them. I informed you, in a\r\nformer letter, of the declaration made by the court of Spain to that of\r\nLondon, relative to its naval armament, and also of the declaration of\r\nthe Count de Montmorin to the Russian minister here on the same subject.\r\nI have good information, that the court of Spain has itself made a\r\nsimilar and formal declaration to the minister of Russia at Madrid.\r\nSo that Russia is satisfied she is not the object. I doubt whether the\r\nEnglish are equally satisfied as to themselves. The season has hitherto\r\nprevented any remarkable operation between the Turks and the two\r\nempires. The war, however, will probably go on, and the season now\r\nadmits of more important events. The Empress has engaged Commodore Paul\r\nJones in her service. He is to have the rank of rear-admiral, with\r\na separate command, and it is understood that he is in no case to be\r\ncommanded. He will probably be opposed to the Captain Pacha on the Black\r\nSea. He received this invitation at Copenhagen, and as the season for\r\ncommencing the campaign, was too near to admit time for him to ask\r\nand await the permission of Congress, he accepted the offer, only\r\nstipulating, that he should be always free to return to the orders of\r\nCongress whenever called for, and that he should not be expected to bear\r\narms against France. He conceived, that the experience he should gain\r\nwould enable him to be more useful to the United States, should they\r\never have occasion for him. It has been understood, that Congress had\r\nhad it in contemplation to give him the grade of rear-admiral, from the\r\ndate of the action of the Serapis, and it is supposed, that such a mark\r\nof their approbation would have a favorable influence on his fortune in\r\nthe north. Copies of the letters which passed between him and the Danish\r\nminister are herewith transmitted. I shall immediately represent to\r\nCount Bernstorff, that the demand for our prizes can have no connection\r\nwith a treaty of commerce; that there is no reason why the claims of\r\nour seamen should await so distant and uncertain an event; and press the\r\nsettlement of this claim.\r\n\r\nThis country still pursues its line of peace. The ministry seem now all\r\nunited in it; some from a belief of their inability to carry on a war;\r\nothers from a desire to arrange their internal affairs, and improve\r\ntheir constitution. The differences between the King and parliaments\r\nthreaten a serious issue. Many symptoms indicate that the government has\r\nin contemplation some act of highhanded authority. An extra number of\r\nprinters have for several days been employed, the apartment wherein they\r\nare at work being surrounded by a body of guards, who permit no body\r\neither to come out or go in. The commanders of the provinces, civil and\r\nmilitary, have been ordered to be at their stations on a certain day\r\nof the ensuing week. They are accordingly gone: so that the will of the\r\nKing is probably to be announced through the whole kingdom on the same\r\nday. The parliament of Paris, apprehending that some innovation is to\r\nbe attempted, which may take from them the opportunity of deciding on it\r\nafter it shall be made known, came last night to the resolution of\r\nwhich I have the honor to enclose you a manuscript copy. This you will\r\nperceive to be, in effect, a declaration of rights. I am obliged to\r\nclose here the present letter, lest I should miss the opportunity of\r\nconveying it by a passenger who is to call for it. Should the delay of\r\nthe packet admit any continuation of these details, they shall be the\r\nsubject of another letter, to be forwarded by post. The gazettes of\r\nLeyden and France accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXV.--TO THE COUNT DE MOUSTIER, May 17, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\nParis, May 17, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have at length an opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your\r\nfavors of February, and March the 14th, and congratulating you on your\r\nresurrection from the dead, among whom you had been confidently entombed\r\nby the news-dealers of Paris. I am sorry that your first impressions\r\nhave been disturbed by matters of etiquette, where surely they\r\nshould least have been expected to occur. These disputes are the most\r\ninsusceptible of determination, because they have no foundation in\r\nreason. Arbitrary and senseless in their nature, they are arbitrarily\r\ndecided by every nation for itself. These decisions are meant to prevent\r\ndisputes, but they produce ten, where they prevent one. It would have\r\nbeen better, therefore, in a new country, to have excluded etiquette\r\naltogether; or if it must be admitted in some form or other, to have\r\nmade it depend on some circumstance founded in nature, such as the age\r\nor station of the parties. However, you have got over all this, and I\r\nam in hopes have been able to make up a society suited to your own\r\ndispositions. Your situation will doubtless be improved by the adoption\r\nof the new constitution, which I hope will have taken place before\r\nyou receive this. I see in this instrument a great deal of good.\r\nThe consolidation of our government, a just representation, an\r\nadministration of some permanence, and other features of great value,\r\nwill be gained by it. There are, indeed, some faults, which revolted me\r\na good deal in the first moment; but we must be contented to travel on\r\ntowards perfection, step by step. We must be contented with the ground\r\nwhich this constitution will gain for us, and hope that a favorable\r\nmoment will come for correcting what is amiss in it. I view in the same\r\nlight the innovations making here. The new organization of the judiciary\r\ndepartment is undoubtedly for the better. The reformation of the\r\ncriminal code is an immense step taken towards good. The composition\r\nof the Plenary court is indeed vicious in the extreme; but the basis of\r\nthat court may be retained, and its composition changed. Make of it a\r\nrepresentative of the people, by composing it of members sent from\r\nthe Provincial Assemblies, and it becomes a valuable member of the\r\nconstitution. But it is said, the court will not consent to do this:\r\nthe court, however, has consented to call the States General, who will\r\nconsider the Plenary court but as a canvass for them to work on. The\r\npublic mind is manifestly advancing on the abusive prerogatives of\r\ntheir governors, and bearing them down. No force in the government can\r\nwithstand this, in the long run. Courtiers had rather give up power than\r\npleasures; they will barter, therefore, the usurped prerogatives of\r\nthe King for the money of the people. This is the agent by which modern\r\nnations will recover their rights. I sincerely wish that, in this\r\ncountry, they may be contented with a peaceable and passive opposition.\r\nAt this moment we are not sure of this; though as yet it is difficult\r\nto say what form the opposition will take. It is a comfortable\r\ncircumstance, that their neighboring enemy is under the administration\r\nof a minister disposed to keep the peace. Engage in war who will, may\r\nmy country long continue your peaceful residence, and merit your good\r\noffices with that nation, whose affections it is their duty and interest\r\nto cultivate.\r\n\r\nAccept these and all other the good wishes of him, who has the honor to\r\nbe, with sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVI.--TO JOHN JAY, May 23,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, May 23,1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote my letter of the 4th instant, I had no reason to doubt that\r\na packet would have sailed on the 10th, according to the established\r\norder. The passengers had all, except one, gone down to Havre in this\r\nexpectation. However, none has sailed, and perhaps none will sail, as\r\nI think the suppression of the packets is one of the economies in\r\ncontemplation. An American merchant, concerned in the commerce of the\r\nwhale-oil, proposed to government to despatch his ships from Havre and\r\nBoston at stated periods, and to take on board the French courier and\r\nmail, and the proposition has been well enough received. I avail myself\r\nof a merchant vessel going from Havre, to write the present.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 4th, I stated to you the symptoms which indicated\r\nthat government had some great stroke of authority in contemplation.\r\nThat night they sent guards to seize Monsieur d’Epremenil and Monsieur\r\nGoiskind, two members of parliament, in their houses. They escaped,\r\nand took sanctuary in the Palais (or parliament house). The parliament\r\nassembled itself extraordinarily, summoned the Dukes and Peers\r\nspecially, and came to the resolution of the 5th, which they sent to\r\nVersailles by deputies, determined not to leave the palace till they\r\nreceived an answer. In the course of that night a battalion of guards\r\nsurrounded the house. The two members were taken by the officers from\r\namong their fellows, and sent off to prison, the one to Lyons, the other\r\n(d’Epremenil), the most obnoxious, to an island in the Mediterranean.\r\nThe parliament then separated. On the 8th, a bed of justice was held at\r\nVersailles, wherein were enregistered the six ordinances which had been\r\npassed in Council on the 1st of May, and which I now send you. They\r\nwere in like manner enregistered in beds of justice, on the same day, in\r\nnearly all the parliaments of the kingdom. By these ordinances, 1. The\r\ncriminal law is reformed, by abolishing examination on the _sellette_,\r\nwhich, like our holding up the hand at the bar, remained a stigma on the\r\nparty, though innocent; by substituting an oath, instead of torture, on\r\nthe _question préalable_, which is used after condemnation, to make the\r\nprisoner discover his accomplices; (the torture, abolished in 1780, was\r\non the _question préparatoire_, previous to judgment, in order to make\r\nthe prisoner accuse himself;) by allowing counsel to the prisoner for\r\nhis defence; obliging the judges to specify in their judgments the\r\noffence for which he is condemned; and respiting execution a month,\r\nexcept in the case of sedition. This reformation is unquestionably good,\r\nand within the ordinary legislative powers of the crown. That it should\r\nremain to be made at this day, proves that the monarch is the last\r\nperson in his kingdom who yields to the progress of philanthropy and\r\ncivilization. 2. The organization of the whole judiciary department is\r\nchanged, by the institution of subordinate jurisdictions, the taking\r\nfrom the parliaments the cognizance of all causes of less value than\r\ntwenty thousand livres, reducing their numbers to about a fourth, and\r\nsuppressing a number of special courts. Even this would be a great\r\nimprovement, if it did not imply that the King is the only person\r\nin this nation, who has any rights or any power. 3. The right of\r\nregistering the laws is taken from the parliaments, and transferred to\r\na Plenary court, created by the King. This last is the measure most\r\nobnoxious to all persons. Though the members are to be for life, yet a\r\ngreat proportion of them are from descriptions of men always candidates\r\nfor the royal favor in other lines. As yet, the general consternation\r\nhas not sufficiently passed over, to say whether the matter will end\r\nhere. I send you some papers, which indicate symptoms of resistance.\r\nThese are the resolution of the _Noblesse_ of Brittany, the declaration\r\nof the Advocate General of Provence, which is said to express the\r\nspirit of that province; and the _Arrêté of the Châtelet_, which is the\r\nhustings-court of the city of Paris. Their refusal to act under the\r\nnew character assigned them, and the suspension of their principal\r\nfunctions, are very embarrassing. The clamors this will excite, and\r\nthe disorders it may admit, will be loud, and near to the royal ear and\r\nperson. The parliamentary fragments permitted to remain, have already\r\nsome of them refused, and probably all will refuse, to act under that\r\nform. The assembly of the clergy which happens to be sitting, have\r\naddressed the King to call the States General immediately. Of the Dukes\r\nand Peers (thirty-eight in number), nearly half are either minors or\r\nsuperannuated; two thirds of the acting half seem disposed to avoid\r\ntaking a part; the rest, about eight or nine, have refused, by letters\r\nto the King, to act in the new courts. A proposition excited among the\r\nDukes and Peers, to assemble and address the King for a modification of\r\nthe Plenary court, seems to show that the government would be willing to\r\ncompromise on that head. It has been prevented by the Dukes and Peers in\r\nopposition, because they suppose that no modification to be made by the\r\ngovernment will give to that body the form they desire, which is that of\r\na representative of the nation. They foresee that if the government\r\nis forced to this, they will call them, as nearly as they can, in the\r\nancient forms; in which case, less good will be to be expected from\r\nthem. But they hope they may be got to concur in a declaration of\r\nrights, at least, so that the nation may be acknowledged to have some\r\nfundamental rights, not alterable by their ordinary legislature, and\r\nthat this may form a ground-work for future improvements. These seem to\r\nbe the views of the most enlightened and disinterested characters of the\r\nopposition. But they may be frustrated by the nation’s making no cry at\r\nall, or by a hasty and premature appeal to arms. There is neither\r\nhead nor body in the nation, to promise a successful opposition to\r\ntwo hundred thousand regular troops. Some think the army could not\r\nbe depended on by the government; but the breaking men to military\r\ndiscipline, is breaking their spirits to principles of passive\r\nobedience. A firm, but quiet opposition, will be the most likely\r\nto succeed. Whatever turn this crisis takes, a revolution in their\r\nconstitution seems inevitable, unless foreign war supervene, to suspend\r\nthe present contest. And a foreign war they will avoid, if possible,\r\nfrom an inability to get money. The loan of one hundred and twenty\r\nmillions, of the present year, is filled up by such subscriptions as may\r\nbe relied on. But that of eighty millions, proposed for the next year,\r\ncannot be filled up, in the actual situation of things.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians have been successful in an attack upon Schabatz, intended\r\nas a preliminary to that of Belgrade. In that on Dubitza, another town\r\nin the neighborhood of Belgrade, they have been repulsed, and as is\r\nsuspected, with considerable loss. It is still supposed the Russian\r\nfleet will go into the Mediterranean, though it will be much retarded by\r\nthe refusal of the English government to permit its sailors to engage in\r\nthe voyage. Sweden and Denmark are arming from eight to twelve ships of\r\nthe line each. The English and Dutch treaty you will find in the Leyden\r\ngazettes of May the 9th and 13th. That between England and Prussia is\r\nsupposed to be stationary. Monsieur de St. Priest, the ambassador from\r\nthis court to the Hague, has either gone, or is on the point of going.\r\nThe Emperor of Morocco has declared war against England. I enclose you\r\nhis orders in our favor, on that occasion. England sends a squadron\r\nto the Mediterranean for the protection of her commerce, and she is\r\nreinforcing her possessions in the two Indies. France is expecting the\r\narrival of an embassy from Tippoo Saib, is sending some regiments to the\r\nEast Indies, and a fleet of evolution into the Atlantic. Seven ships of\r\nthe line and several frigates, sailed from Cadiz on the 22nd of April,\r\ndestined to perform evolutions off the Western Islands, as the Spaniards\r\nsay, but really to their American possessions, as is suspected. Thus\r\nthe several powers are by little and little, taking the position of war,\r\nwithout an immediate intention of waging it. But that the present ill\r\nhumor will finally end in war, is doubted by nobody.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of February the 5th, I had the honor of informing you of\r\nthe discontent produced by our _Arrêt_ of December the 29th, among the\r\nmerchants of this country, and of the deputations from the chambers of\r\ncommerce to the minister, on that subject. The articles attacked, were\r\nthe privileges on the sale of our ships, and the _entrepôt_ for codfish.\r\nThe former I knew to be valuable: the latter I supposed not so; because\r\nduring the whole of the time we have had four free ports in this\r\nkingdom, we have never used them for the smuggling of fish. I concluded,\r\ntherefore, the ports of _entrepôt_ would not be used for that purpose. I\r\nsaw that the ministers would sacrifice something to quiet the merchants,\r\nand was glad to save the valuable article relative to our ships, by\r\nabandoning the useless one for our codfish. It was settled, therefore,\r\nin our conferences, that an _Arrêt_ should be passed, abridging the\r\nformer one only as to the entrepot of codfish. I was in Holland when the\r\n_Arrêt_ came out; and did not get a copy of it till yesterday. Surprised\r\nto find that fish-oil was thereby also excluded from the entrepot, I\r\nhave been to-day to make some inquiry into the cause; and from what I\r\ncan learn, I conclude it must have been a mere error in the clerk who\r\nformed the _Arrêt_, and that it escaped attention on its passage. The\r\n_entrepôt_ of whale-oil was not objected to by a single deputy at\r\nthe conferences, and the excluding it is contrary to the spirit of\r\nencouragement the ministers have shown a disposition to give. I trust,\r\ntherefore, I may get it altered on the first occasion which occurs,\r\nand I believe one will soon occur. In the mean time, we do not store a\r\nsingle drop for re-exportation, as all which comes here is needed\r\nfor the consumption of this country; which will alone, according to\r\nappearances, become so considerable as to require all we can produce.\r\n\r\nBy a letter of the 8th instant, from our bankers, I learn that they had\r\ndisposed of bonds enough to pay our June interest, and to replace the\r\ntemporary advances made by Mr. Grand, and from a fund placed here by the\r\nState of Virginia. I have desired them, accordingly, to replace these\r\nmonies, which had been lent for the moment only, and in confidence of\r\nimmediate repayment. They add, that the payment of the June interest\r\nand the news from America, will, as they trust, enable them to place\r\nthe remaining bonds of the last year’s million. I suppose, indeed, that\r\nthere is no doubt of it, and that none would have been expressed, if\r\nthose two houses could draw better together than they do. In the mean\r\ntime, I hope the treasury board will send an order for so much as may be\r\nnecessary for executing the purposes of Congress, as to our captives at\r\nAlgiers.\r\n\r\nI send you herewith, a _Mémoire_ of Monsieur Caseaux, whose name is\r\nfamiliar on the journals of Congress. He prepared it to be delivered to\r\nthe King, but I believe he will think better, and not deliver it. The\r\ngazettes of France and Leyden accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. May 27, 1788. I have kept my letter open to the moment of Mr.\r\nWarville’s departure (he being the bearer of it), that I might add\r\nany new incidents that should occur. The refusal of the _Châtelet_ and\r\n_Grande Chambre_ of Paris to act in the new character assigned them,\r\ncontinues. Many of the _grandes bailliages_ accept, some conditionally,\r\nsome fully. This will facilitate greatly the measures of government, and\r\nmay possibly give them a favorable issue. The parliament of Toulouse,\r\nconsidering the edicts as nullities, went on with their business. They\r\nhave been exiled in consequence. Monsieur de St. Priest left Paris for\r\nthe Hague, on the 23rd. I mention this fact, because it denotes the\r\nacquiescence of this government in the late revolution there. A second\r\ndivision of a Spanish fleet will put to sea soon. Its destination\r\nnot declared. Sweden is arming to a greater extent than was at first\r\nsupposed. From twelve so sixteen sail of the line are spoken of, on good\r\ngrounds, Denmark, for her own security, must arm in proportion to this.\r\nT. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVII.--TO JOHN BROWN, May 26,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BROWN.\r\n\r\nParis, May 26,1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt was with great pleasure I saw your name on the roll of Delegates, but\r\nI did not know you had actually come onto New-York, till Mr. Paradise\r\ninformed me of it. Your removal from Carolina to Kentucky was not an\r\nindifferent event to me. I wish to see that country in the hands of\r\npeople well disposed, who know the value of the connection between that\r\nand the maritime States, and who wish to cultivate it. I consider their\r\nhappiness as bound up together, and that every measure should be taken,\r\nwhich may draw the bands of union tighter. It will be an efficacious one\r\nto receive them into Congress, as I perceive they are about to desire\r\nto this be added an honest and disinterested conduct in Congress, as\r\nto every thing relating to them, we may hope for a perfect harmony. The\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi was, perhaps, the strongest trial to which\r\nthe justice of the federal government could be put. If ever they thought\r\nwrong about it, I trust they have got to rights. I should think it\r\nproper for the western country to defer pushing their right to that\r\nnavigation to extremity, as long as they can do without it, tolerably;\r\nbut that the moment it becomes absolutely necessary for them, it will\r\nbecome the duty of the maritime states to push it to every extremity,\r\nto which they would their own right of navigating the Chesapeake, the\r\nDelaware, the Hudson, or any other water. A time of peace will not\r\nbe the surest for obtaining this object. Those, therefore, who have\r\ninfluence in the new country, would act wisely, to endeavor to keep\r\nthings quiet till the western parts of Europe shall be engaged in war.\r\nNotwithstanding the aversion of the courts of London and Versailles to\r\nwar, it is not certain that some incident may not engage them in it.\r\nEngland, France, Spain, Russia, Sweden, and Denmark will all have fleets\r\nat sea, or ready to put to sea immediately. Who can answer for the\r\nprudence of all their officers? War is their interest. Even their courts\r\nare pacific from impotence only, not from disposition. I wish to Heaven\r\nthat our new government may see the importance of putting themselves\r\nimmediately into a respectable position. To make provision for the\r\nspeedy payment of their foreign debts, will be the first operation\r\nnecessary. This will give them credit. A concomitant one should be,\r\nmagazines and manufactures of arms. This country is at present in a\r\ncrisis of very uncertain issue. I am in hopes it will be a favorable one\r\nto the rights and happiness of the people; and that this will take place\r\nquietly. Small changes in the late regulations will render them wholly\r\ngood. The campaign opens between the Turks and the two empires, with an\r\naspect rather favorable to the former. The Russians seem not yet thawed\r\nfrom the winter’s torpitude. They have no army yet in motion: and the\r\nEmperor has been worsted in two thirds of the small actions, which\r\nthey have had as yet. He is said to be rather retiring. I do not think,\r\nhowever, that the success of the Turks in the partisan affairs which\r\nhave taken place, can authorize us to presume, that they will be\r\nsuperior also in great decisions. Their want of discipline and skill in\r\nmilitary manœuvres is of little consequence in small engagements, and\r\nof great in larger ones. Their grand army was at Adrianople by the last\r\naccounts, and to get from thence to Belgrade will require a month. It\r\nwill be that time at least then, before we can have any very interesting\r\nnews from them. In the mean time, the plague rages at Constantinople to\r\na terrible degree. I cannot think but that it would be desirable to all\r\ncommercial nations, to have that nation and all its dependencies driven\r\nfrom the sea-coast, into the interior parts of Asia and Africa. What a\r\nfield would, thus be restored to commerce! The finest parts of the old\r\nworld are now dead, in a great degree, to commerce, to arts, to science,\r\nand to society. Greece, Syria, Egypt, and the northern coast of Africa,\r\nconstituted the whole world almost for the Romans, and to us they are\r\nscarcely known, scarcely accessible at all. The present summer will\r\nenable us to judge, what turn this contest will take. I am greatly\r\nanxious to hear that nine States accept our new constitution. We must\r\nbe contented to accept of its good, and to cure what is evil in it\r\nhereafter. It seems necessary for our happiness at home; I am sure it is\r\nso for our respectability abroad. I shall, at all times, be glad to hear\r\nfrom you, from New York, from Kentucky, or whatever region of the\r\nearth you inhabit; being with sentiments of very sincere esteem and\r\nattachment, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVIII.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, May 27, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, May 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of April the 14th and 29th, and May the 8th, have lately\r\ncome to hand. That of January the 29th, by M. de Moinedo, had been left\r\nhere during my absence on a journey to Amsterdam. That gentleman had\r\ngone, as I presume, before my return, from my being unable to learn any\r\nthing of him.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Isthmus of Panama, I am assured by Burgoine (who\r\nwould not chose to be named, however), that a survey was made, that a\r\ncanal appeared very practicable, and that the idea was suppressed for\r\npolitical reasons altogether. He has seen and minutely examined the\r\nreport. This report is to me a vast _desideratum_, for reasons political\r\nand philosophical. I cannot help suspecting the Spanish squadrons to\r\nbe gone to South America, and that some disturbances have been excited\r\nthere by the British. The court of Madrid may suppose we would not see\r\nthis with an unwilling eye. This may be true as to the uninformed part\r\nof our people: but those who look into futurity farther than the present\r\nmoment or age, and who combine well what is, with what is to be, must\r\nsee that our interests, well understood, and our wishes are, that Spain\r\nshall (not for ever, but) very long retain her possessions in that\r\nquarter; and that her views and ours must, in a good degree, and for a\r\nlong time, concur. It is said in our gazettes, that the Spaniards have\r\nsunk one of our boats on the Mississippi, and that our people retaliated\r\non one of theirs. But my letters, not mentioning this fact, have made\r\nme hope it is not true, in which hope your letter confirms me. There are\r\nnow one hundred thousand inhabitants in Kentucky. They have accepted the\r\noffer of independence, on the terms proposed by Virginia, and they have\r\ndecided that their independent government shall begin on the first day\r\nof the next year. In the mean time, they claim admittance into Congress.\r\nGeorgia has ceded her western territory to the United States, to take\r\nplace with the commencement of the new federal government. I do not know\r\nthe boundaries. There has been some dispute of etiquette with the new\r\nFrench minister, which has disgusted him.\r\n\r\nThe following is a state of the progress and prospects of the new plan\r\nof government.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Massachusetts has been noble. She accepted the\r\nconstitution, but voted that it should stand as a perpetual instruction\r\nto her Delegates, to endeavor to obtain such and such reformations; and\r\nthe minority, though very strong both in numbers and abilities, declared\r\n_viritim_ and _seriatim_, that acknowledging the principle that the\r\nmajority must give the law, they would now support the new constitution\r\nwith their tongues, and with their blood, if necessary. I was much\r\npleased with many and essential parts of this instrument, from the\r\nbeginning. But I thought I saw in it many faults, great and small.\r\nWhat I have read and reflected, has brought me over from several of my\r\nobjections, of the first moment, and to acquiesce under some others. Two\r\nonly remain, of essential consideration, to wit, the want of a bill of\r\nrights, and the expunging the principle of necessary rotation in the\r\noffices of President and Senator. At first, I wished that when nine\r\nStates should have accepted the constitution, so as to insure us what is\r\ngood in it, the other four might hold off till the want of the bill of\r\nrights at least, might be supplied. But I am now convinced that the\r\nplan of Massachusetts is the best, that is, to accept and to amend\r\nafterwards. If the States which were to decide after her, should all\r\ndo the same, it is impossible but they must obtain the essential\r\namendments. It will be more difficult, if we lose this instrument, to\r\nrecover what is good in it, than to correct what is bad, after we shall\r\nhave adopted it. It has, therefore, my hearty prayers, and I wait with\r\nanxiety for news of the votes of Maryland, South Carolina, and Virginia.\r\nThere is no doubt that General Washington will accept the presidentship;\r\nthough he is silent on the subject. He would not be chosen to the\r\nVirginia convention. A riot has taken place in New York, which I will\r\nstate to you from an eye-witness. It has long been a practice with the\r\nsurgeons of that city, to steal from the grave bodies recently buried.\r\nA citizen had lost his wife: he went, the first or second evening after\r\nher burial, to pay a visit to her grave.. He found that it had been\r\ndisturbed, and suspected from what quarter. He found means to be\r\nadmitted to the anatomical lecture of that day, and on his entering the\r\nroom, saw the body of his wife, naked and under dissection. He raised\r\nthe people immediately. The body, in the mean time, was secreted. They\r\nentered into and searched the houses of the physicians whom they most\r\nsuspected, but found nothing. One of them however more guilty or more\r\ntimid than the rest, took asylum in the prison. The mob considered\r\nthis an acknowledgment of guilt. They attacked the prison. The Governor\r\nordered militia to protect the culprit, and suppress the mob. The\r\nmilitia, thinking the mob had just provocation, refused to turn out.\r\nHereupon the people of more reflection, thinking it more dangerous that\r\neven a guilty person should be punished without the forms of law,\r\nthan that he should escape, armed themselves, and went to protect the\r\nphysician. They were received by the mob with a volley of stones, which\r\nwounded several of them. They hereupon fired on the mob and killed four.\r\nBy this time, they received a reinforcement of other citizens of\r\nthe militia horse, the appearance of which, in the critical moment,\r\ndispersed the mob. So ended this chapter of history, which I have\r\ndetailed to you, because it may be represented as a political riot, when\r\npolitics had nothing to do with it. Mr. Jay and Baron Steuben were both\r\ngrievously wounded in the head by stones. The former still kept his bed,\r\nand the latter his room, when the packet sailed, which was the 24th of\r\nApril. I am, with sentiments of great esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIX.--TO JOHN JAY, May 27, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n(Private.) Paris, May 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe change which is likely to take place in the form of our government,\r\nseems to render it proper, that, during the existence of the present\r\ngovernment, an article should be mentioned which concerns me personally.\r\nUncertain, however, how far Congress may have decided to do business\r\nwhen so near the close of their administration; less capable than those\r\non the spot of foreseeing the character of the new government; and not\r\nfully confiding in my own judgment, where it is so liable to be seduced\r\nby feeling, I take the liberty of asking your friendly counsel, and that\r\nof my friend Mr. Madison, and of referring the matter to your judgments\r\nand discretion.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay when in Europe was authorized to settle all the European\r\naccounts of the United States: he settled those of Dr. Franklin and Mr.\r\nAdams, and it was intended between us, that he should settle mine.\r\nBut as what may be done at any time is often put off to the last, this\r\nsettlement had been made to give way to others, and that of Beaumarchais\r\nbeing pressed on Mr. Barclay before his departure for Morocco, and\r\nhaving long retarded his departure, it was agreed that my affair should\r\nawait his return from that mission: you know the circumstances which\r\nprevented his return to Paris after that mission was finished. My\r\naccount is therefore unsettled, but I have no anxiety on any article of\r\nit, except one, that is, the outfit. This consists of, 1. clothes; 2.\r\ncarriage and horses; 3. household furniture. When Congress made their\r\nfirst appointments of ministers to be resident in Europe, I have\r\nunderstood (for I was not then in Congress) that they allowed them all\r\ntheir expenses, and a fixed sum over and above for their time. Among\r\ntheir expenses, was necessarily understood their outfit. Afterwards\r\nthey thought proper to give them fixed salaries of eleven thousand\r\none hundred and eleven dollars and one ninth a year; and again, by\r\na resolution of May the 6th and 8th, 1784, the ‘salaries’ of their\r\nministers at foreign courts were reduced to nine thousand dollars,\r\nto take place on the 1st of August ensuing. On the 7th of May I\r\nwas appointed, in addition to Mr. Adams and Dr. Franklin, for the\r\nnegotiation of treaties of commerce; but this appointment being\r\ntemporary, for two years only, and not as of a resident minister, the\r\narticle of outfit did not come into question. I asked an advance of six\r\nmonths’ salary, that I might be in cash to meet the first expenses; which\r\nwas ordered. The year following, I was appointed to succeed Dr. Franklin\r\nat this court. This was the first appointment of a minister resident,\r\nsince the original ones, under which all expenses were to be paid. So\r\nmuch of the ancient regulation, as respected annual expenses, had been\r\naltered to a sum certain; so much of it as respected first expenses,\r\nor outfit, remained unaltered; and I might therefore expect, that the\r\nactual expenses for outfit were to be paid. When I prepared my account\r\nfor settlement with Mr. Barclay, I began a detail of the articles of\r\nclothes, carriage, horses, and household furniture. I found that they\r\nwere numerous, minute, and incapable, from their nature, of being\r\nvouched; and often entered in my memorandum-book under a general head\r\nonly, so that I could not specify them. I found they would exceed a\r\nyear’s salary. Supposing, therefore, that, mine being the first case,\r\nCongress would make a precedent of it, and prefer a sum fixed for the\r\noutfit, as well as the salary, I have charged it in my account at a\r\nyear’s salary; presuming there can be no question that an outfit is a\r\nreasonable charge. It is the usage here (and I suppose at all courts),\r\nthat a minister resident, shall establish his house in the first\r\ninstant. If this is to be done out of his salary, he will be a\r\ntwelvemonth at least without a copper to live on. It is the universal\r\npractice, therefore, of all nations, to allow the outfit as a separate\r\narticle from the salary. I have inquired here into the usual amount of\r\nit. I find that, sometimes, the sovereign pays the actual cost. This is\r\nparticularly the case of the Sardinian ambassador now coming here, who\r\nis to provide a service of plate, and every article of furniture, and\r\nother matters of first expense, to be paid for by his court. In other\r\ninstances, they give a service of plate, and a fixed sum for all other\r\narticles, which fixed sum is in no case lower than a year’s salary.\r\n\r\nI desire no service of plate, having no ambition for splendor. My\r\nfurniture, carriage, and apparel are all plain, yet they have cost me\r\nmore than a year’s salary. I suppose that in every country, and in every\r\ncondition of life, a year’s expense would be found a moderate measure\r\nfor the furniture of a man’s house. It is not more certain to me, that\r\nthe sun will rise to-morrow, than that our government must allow the\r\noutfit, on their future appointment of foreign ministers; and it would\r\nbe hard on me, so to stand between the discontinuance of a former rule,\r\nand institution of a future one, as to have the benefit of neither. I\r\nknow, I have so long known the character of our federal head, in its\r\npresent form, that I have the most unlimited confidence in the justice\r\nof its decisions. I think I am so far known to many of the present\r\nCongress, as that I may be cleared of all views of making money out of\r\nany public employment, or of desiring any thing beyond actual and decent\r\nexpenses, proportioned to the station in which they have been pleased to\r\nplace me, and to the respect they would wish to see attached to it. It\r\nwould seem right, that they should decide the claims of those who\r\nhave acted under their administration, and their pretermission of any\r\narticle, might amount to a disallowance of it in the opinion of the new\r\ngovernment. It would be painful to me to meet that government with a\r\nclaim under this kind of cloud, and to pass it in review before their\r\nseveral Houses of legislation, and boards of administration, to whom I\r\nshall be unknown; and being for money actually expended, it would be\r\ntoo inconvenient to me to relinquish it in silence. I anxiously ask it,\r\ntherefore, to be decided on by Congress before they go out of office,\r\nif it be not out of the line of proceeding they may have chalked out for\r\nthemselves. If it be against their inclination to determine it, would\r\nit be agreeable to them to refer it to the new government, by some\r\nresolution, which should show they have not meant to disallow it, by\r\npassing it over? Not knowing the circumstances under which Congress may\r\nexist and act at the moment you shall receive this, I am unable to judge\r\nwhat should be done on this subject. It is therefore that I ask the aid\r\nof your friendship and that of Mr. Madison, that you will do for me\r\nin this regard, what you think it is right should be done, and what it\r\nwould be right for me to do, were I on the spot, or were I apprized of\r\nall existing circumstances. Indeed, were you two to think my claim\r\nan improper one, I would wish it to be suppressed, as I have so much\r\nconfidence in your judgment, that I should suspect my own in any case\r\nwhere it varied from yours, and more especially, in one where it\r\nis liable to be warped by feeling. Give me leave, then, to ask your\r\nconsultation with Mr. Madison on this subject; and to assure you that\r\nwhatever you are so good as to do herein, will be perfectly approved,\r\nand considered as a great obligation conferred on him, who has the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and attachment, Dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXL.*--TO JAMES MADISON, May 28, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, May 28, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter for Mr. Jay, being of a private nature. I have\r\nthought it better to put it under your cover, lest it might be opened\r\nby some of his clerks, in the case of his absence. But I enclose a press\r\ncopy of it for yourself, as you will perceive the subject of it referred\r\nto you, as well as to him. I ask your aid in it so far as you think\r\nright, and to have done what you think right. If you will now be so good\r\nas to cast your eye over the copy enclosed, what follows the present\r\nsentence, will be some details, supplementary to that only, necessary\r\nfor your information, but not proper for me to state to Mr. Jay.\r\n\r\n      [*  It will be seen that a few words of this letter are in\r\n          cipher. It is published, however, as written, because\r\n          enough of it is literal to interest the reader, to whom\r\n          also a specimen of the cipher, used by the Author, may\r\n          not be unacceptable.]\r\n\r\n378.227.1247. though appointed a minister resident at the court of 514.\r\nhe never was 663. in that character. He was continually passing from\r\n1042. to 514. and 514. to 1042., so that he had no occasion to establish\r\na household at either. Accordingly, he staid principally in furnished\r\nlodgings. Of all our ministers, he had the least occasion for an\r\noutfit, and I suppose spent almost nothing on that article. He was of\r\na disposition, too, to restrain himself within any limits of expense\r\nwhatever, and it suited his recluse turn, which is, to avoid society.\r\nShould he judge of what others should do, by what he did, it would be\r\nan improper criterion. He was in Europe as a voyageur only, and it was\r\nwhile the salary was five hundred guineas more than at present.\r\n\r\n145.1267.1046.7. he came over, when, instead of outfit and salary, all\r\nexpenses were paid. Of rigorous honesty, and careless of appearances, he\r\nlived for a considerable time as an economical private individual. After\r\nhe was fixed at 812.141. and the salary at a sum certain, he continued\r\nhis economical style, till, out of the difference between his expenses\r\nand his salary, he could purchase furniture for his house. This was the\r\neasier, as the salary was at two thousand five hundred guineas then.\r\nHe was obliged, too, to be passing between 1042. and 812.141. so as to\r\navoid any regular current of expenses. When he established himself, his\r\npecuniary affairs were under the direction of 964.814.7.101.994., one\r\nof the most estimable characters on earth, and the most attentive and\r\nhonorable economists. Neither had a wish to lay up a copper, but both\r\nwished to make both ends meet. I suspected, however, from an expression\r\ndropped in conversation, that they were not able to do this, and that\r\na deficit in their accounts appeared in their winding up. If this\r\nconjecture be true, it is a proof that the salary, so far from admitting\r\nsavings, is unequal to a very plain style of life; for such was theirs.\r\nI presume Congress will be asked to allow it, and it is evident to me,\r\nfrom what I saw while in 1093. that it ought to be done, as they did\r\nnot expend a shilling which should have been avoided. Would it be more\r\neligible to set the example of making good a deficit, or to give him\r\nan outfit, which will cover it? The impossibility of living on the sum\r\nallowed, respectably, was the true cause of his insisting on his recall.\r\n821.267.1292. He came over while all expenses were paid. He rented a\r\nhouse with standing furniture, such as tables, chairs, presses, &c., and\r\nbought all other necessaries. The latter were charged in his account;\r\nthe former was included in the article of house-rent, and paid during\r\nthe whole time of his stay here; and as the established rate of hire\r\nfor furniture is from thirty to forty per cent, per annum, the standing\r\nfurniture must have been paid for three times over, during the eight\r\nyears he staid here. His salary was two thousand five hundred guineas.\r\nWhen Congress reduced it to less than two thousand, he refused to accede\r\nto it, asked his recall, and insisted that whenever they chose to alter\r\nthe conditions on which he came out, if he did not approve of it, they\r\nought to replace him in America on the old conditions. He lived plain,\r\nbut as decently as his salary would allow. He saved nothing, but avoided\r\ndebt. He knew he could not do this on the reduced salary, and therefore\r\nasked his recall with decision.\r\n\r\nTo 935.145. succeeded. He had established a certain style of living. The\r\nsame was expected from 1214. and there were five hundred guineas a\r\nyear less to do it on. It has been aimed at, however, as far as was\r\npracticable. This rendered it constantly necessary to step neither to\r\nthe right nor to the left, to incur any expense which could possibly be\r\navoided, and it called for an almost womanly attention to the details\r\nof the household, equally perplexing, disgusting, and inconsistent with\r\nbusiness. You will be sensible, that, in this situation, no savings\r\ncould be made for reimbursing the half year’s salary, ordered to be\r\nadvanced under the former commission, and more than as much again,\r\nwhich was unavoidably so applied, without order, for the purchase of the\r\noutfit. The reason of the thing, the usage of all nations, the usage of\r\nour own, by paying all expenses of preceding ministers, which gave them\r\nthe outfit, as far as their circumstances appeared to them to render it\r\nnecessary, have made me take for granted all along, that it would not\r\nbe refused to me: nor should I have mentioned it now, but that the\r\nadministration is passing into other hands, and more complicated forms.\r\nIt would be disagreeable to me to be presented to them, in the first\r\ninstance, as a suitor. Men come into business at first with visionary\r\nprinciples. It is practice alone, which can correct and conform them\r\nto the actual current of affairs. In the mean time, those to whom their\r\nerrors were first applied, have been their victims. The government may\r\ntake up the project of appointing foreign ministers without outfits,\r\nand they may ruin two or three individuals, before they find that that\r\narticle is just as indispensable as the salary. They must then fall into\r\nthe current of general usage, which has become general, only because\r\nexperience has established its necessity. Upon the whole, be so good as\r\nto reflect on it, and to do, not what your friendship to me, but your\r\nopinion of what is right, shall dictate.\r\n\r\nAccept, in all cases, assurances of the sincere esteem and respect with\r\nwhich I am, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLI.--TO PETER CARU, May 23, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARU.\r\n\r\nParis, May 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Peter,\r\n\r\nThe preceding letter [* For the letter referred to, see ante, LXXIV.]\r\nwas written at its date, and I supposed you in possession of it, when\r\nyour letters of December the 10th, 1787, and March the 18th, 1788, told\r\nme otherwise. Still I supposed it on its way to you, when a few days\r\nago, having occasion to look among some papers in the drawer, where\r\nmy letters are usually put away, till an opportunity of sending them\r\noccurs, I found that this letter had slipped among them, so that it\r\nhad never been forwarded. I am sorry for it, on account of the remarks\r\nrelative to the Spanish language only. Apply to that with all the\r\nassiduity you can. That language and the English covering nearly the\r\nwhole face of America, they should be well known to every inhabitant,\r\nwho means to look beyond the limits of his farm. I like well the\r\ndistribution of your time, mentioned in your letter of March the 18th;\r\nand the counsels of Mr. Wythe, so kindly extended to you, leave it\r\nnecessary for me to add nothing of that kind. Be assiduous in learning,\r\ntake much exercise for your health, and practise much virtue. Health,\r\nlearning, and virtue, will insure your happiness; they will give you\r\na quiet conscience, private esteem, and public honor. Beyond these, we\r\nwant nothing but physical necessaries, and they are easily obtained.\r\nMy daughters are well, and join me in love to yourself, your mother,\r\nbrothers, and sisters.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, Dear Peter, your affectionate\r\n\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLII.--TO THE COMTE DE BERNSTORFF, June 19, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMTE DE BERNSTORFF.\r\n\r\nParis, June 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing your Excellency, by Admiral Paul Jones,\r\non the 21st of January, on the subject of the prizes taken under his\r\ncommand during the late war, and sent into Bergen. I communicated at the\r\nsame time a copy of the powers which the Congress of the United States\r\nof America had been pleased to confide to me therein, having previously\r\nshown the original to the Baron de Blome, Envoy Extraordinary of his\r\nMajesty, the King of Denmark, at this court; and I furnished, at the\r\nsame time, to Admiral Paul Jones, such authority as I was empowered\r\nto delegate, for the arrangement of this affair. That officer has\r\ntransmitted me a copy of your Excellency’s letter to him of the 4th of\r\nApril, wherein you are pleased to observe, that the want of full powers\r\non his part was an invincible obstacle to the definitive discussion of\r\nthis claim with him, and to express your dispositions to institute a\r\nsettlement at this place. Always assured of the justice and honor of\r\nthe court of Denmark, and encouraged by the particular readiness of your\r\nExcellency to settle and remove this difficulty from between the two\r\nnations, I take the liberty of recalling your attention to it. The place\r\nof negotiation proposed by your Excellency, meets no objection from us,\r\nand it removes, at the same time, that which the want of full powers in\r\nAdmiral Paul Jones had produced in your mind. These full powers Congress\r\nhave been pleased to honor me with. The arrangement taken between the\r\nperson to be charged with your full powers and myself, will be final\r\nand conclusive. You are pleased to express a willingness to treat at\r\nthe same time on the subjects of amity and commerce. The powers formerly\r\ncommunicated on our part, were given to Mr. Adams, Doctor Franklin, and\r\nmyself, for a limited term only. That term has expired, and the other\r\ntwo gentlemen returned to America; so that no person is commissioned at\r\nthis moment to renew those conferences. I may safely, however, assure\r\nyour Excellency, that the same friendly dispositions still continue, and\r\nthe same desire of facilitating and encouraging a commerce between the\r\ntwo nations, which produced the former appointment. But our nation is,\r\nat this time, proposing a change in the organization of its government.\r\nFor this change to be agreed to by all the members of the Union, the new\r\nadministration chosen and brought into activity, their domestic matters\r\narranged, which will require their first attention, their foreign system\r\nafterwards decided on and carried into full execution, will require very\r\nconsiderable length of time. To place under the same delay the private\r\nclaims which I have the honor to present to your Excellency, would be\r\nhard on the persons interested: because these claims have no connection\r\nwith the system of commercial connection, which may be established\r\nbetween the two nations, nor with the particular form of our\r\nadministration. The justice due to them is complete, and the present\r\nadministration as competent to final settlement as any future one will\r\nbe, should a future change take place. These individuals have already\r\nlingered nine years in expectation of their hard and perilous earnings.\r\nTime lessens their numbers continually, disperses their representatives,\r\nweakens the evidence of their right, and renders more and more\r\nimpracticable his Majesty’s dispositions to repair the private injury,\r\nto which public circumstances constrained him. These considerations, the\r\njust and honorable intentions of your Excellency, and the assurances you\r\ngive us in your letter, that no delay is wished on your part, give me\r\nstrong hopes that we may speedily obtain that final arrangement, which\r\nexpress instructions render it my duty to urge. I have the honor,\r\ntherefore, of agreeing with your Excellency, that the settlement of this\r\nmatter, formerly begun at Paris, shall be continued there; and to\r\nask that you will be pleased to give powers and instructions for this\r\npurpose to such persons as you shall think proper, and in such full form\r\nas may prevent those delays, to which the distance between Copenhagen\r\nand Paris might otherwise expose us.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound respect,\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIII.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, June 20, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nParis, June 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHaving had the honor of mentioning to your Excellency the wish of\r\nCongress, that certain changes should be made in the articles for a\r\nconsular convention, which had been sent to them, I have now that,\r\nconformably to the desire you expressed, of giving a general idea of the\r\nalterations to be proposed.\r\n\r\nThe fourth article gives to the consuls the immunities of the law of\r\nnations. It has been understood, however, that the laws of France do not\r\nadmit of this; and that it might be desirable to expunge this article.\r\nIn this we are ready to concur, as in every other case, where an article\r\nmight call for changes in the established laws, either inconvenient or\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nAfter establishing in favor of consuls, the general immunities of the\r\nlaw of nations, one consequence of which would have been, that they\r\ncould not have been called upon to give testimony in courts of justice,\r\nthe fifth article requires, that after the observance of certain\r\nformalities, which imply very high respect, they shall make a\r\ndeclaration; but _in their own houses_ [_chez eux_] as may be pretended,\r\nif not justly inferred, from the expressions in the article. But our\r\nlaws require, indispensably, a personal examination of witnesses in the\r\npresence of the parties, of their counsel, the jury, and judges, each of\r\nwhom has a right to ask of them all questions pertinent to the fact.\r\nThe first and highest officers of our government are obliged to appear\r\npersonally to the order of a court, to give evidence. The court takes\r\ncare that they are treated with respect. It is proposed, therefore,\r\nto omit this article for these particular reasons, as well as for the\r\ngeneral one, that the fourth being expunged, this, which was but an\r\nexception to that, falls of course.\r\n\r\nThe seventh, eighth, tenth, and fourteenth articles extend their\r\npre-eminences far beyond those, which the laws of nations would have\r\ngiven. These articles require that the declarations made in the presence\r\nof consuls, and certified by them, shall be received in evidence in all\r\ncourts whatever: and, in some instances, give to their certificates a\r\ncredibility which excludes all other testimony. The cases are rare, in\r\nwhich our laws admit written evidence of facts; and such evidence, when\r\nadmitted, must have been given in the presence of both parties, and must\r\ncontain the answers to all the pertinent questions, which they may have\r\ndesired to ask of the witness: and to no evidence, of whatever nature,\r\nwritten or oral, do our laws give so high credit, as to exclude all\r\ncounter-proof. These principles are of such ancient foundation in our\r\nsystem of jurisprudence, and are so much valued and venerated by our\r\ncitizens, that perhaps it would be impossible to execute articles, which\r\nshould contravene them, nor is it imagined that these stipulations can\r\nbe so interesting to this country, as to balance the inconvenience and\r\nhazard of such an innovation with us. Perhaps it might be found, that\r\nthe laws of both countries require a modification of this article; as\r\nit is inconceivable that the certificate of an American consul in\r\nFrance could be permitted by one of its courts to establish a fact, the\r\nfalsehood of which should be notorious to the court itself.\r\n\r\nThe eighth article gives to the consuls of either nation a jurisdiction,\r\nin certain cases, over foreigners of any other. On a dispute arising in\r\nFrance, between an American and a Spaniard or an Englishman, it would\r\nnot be fair to abandon the Spaniard or Englishman to an American consul.\r\nOn the contrary, the territorial judge, as neutral, would seem to be the\r\nmost impartial. Probably, therefore, it will be thought convenient for\r\nboth parties, to correct this stipulation.\r\n\r\nA dispute arising between two subjects of France, the one being in\r\nFrance and the other in the United States, the regular tribunals of\r\nFrance would seem entitled to a preference of jurisdiction. Yet the\r\ntwelfth article gives it to their consul in America; and to the consul\r\nof the United States in France, in a like case between their citizens.\r\n\r\nThe power given by the tenth article, of arresting and sending back a\r\nvessel, its captain, and crew, is a very great one indeed, and, in\r\nour opinion, more safely lodged with the territorial judge. We would\r\nourselves trust the tribunals of France to decide, when there is just\r\ncause for so high-handed an act of authority over the persons and\r\nproperty of so many of our citizens, to all of whom these tribunals will\r\nstand in a neutral and impartial relation, rather than any single person\r\nwhom we may appoint as consul, who will seldom be learned in the laws,\r\nand often susceptible of influence from private interest and personal\r\npique. With us, applications for the arrest of vessels, and of their\r\nmasters, are made to the admiralty courts. These are composed of the\r\nmost learned and virtuous characters in the several States, and the\r\nmaritime law, common to all nations, is the rule of their proceedings.\r\nThe exercise of foreign jurisdiction, within the pale of their own\r\nlaws, in a very high case, and wherein those laws have made honorable\r\nprovisions, would be a phenomenon never yet seen in our country, and\r\nwhich would be seen with great jealousy and uneasiness. On the contrary,\r\nto leave this power with the territorial judge will inspire confidence\r\nand friendship, and be really, at the same time, more secure against\r\nabuse. The power of arresting deserted seamen seems necessary for the\r\npurposes of navigation and commerce, and will be more attentively and\r\neffectually exercised by the consul, than by the territorial judge.\r\nTo this part of the tenth article, therefore, as well as to that which\r\nrequires the territorial judge to assist the consul in the exercise of\r\nthis function, we can accede. But the extension of the like power to\r\npassengers, seems not necessary for the purposes either of navigation\r\nor commerce. It does not come, therefore, within the functions of the\r\nconsul, whose institution is for those two objects only, nor within the\r\npowers of a commissioner, authorized to treat and conclude a convention,\r\nsolely for regulating the powers, privileges, and duties of consuls.\r\nThe arrest and detention of passengers, moreover, would often be in\r\ncontradiction to our bills of rights, which, being fundamental, cannot\r\nbe obstructed in their operation by any law or convention whatever.\r\n\r\nConsular institutions being entirely new with us, Congress think it wise\r\nto make their first convention probationary, and not perpetual. They\r\npropose, therefore, a clause for limiting its duration to a certain term\r\nof years. If after the experience of a few years, it should be found to\r\nanswer the purposes intended by it, both parties will have sufficient\r\ninducements to renew it, either in its present form, or with such\r\nalterations and amendments, as time, experience, and other circumstances\r\nmay indicate.\r\n\r\nThe convention, as expressed in the French language, will fully answer\r\nour purposes in France, because it will there be understood. But it will\r\nnot equally answer the purposes of France in America, because it will\r\nnot there be understood. In very few of the courts, wherein it may be\r\npresented, will there be found a single judge or advocate, capable of\r\ntranslating it at all, much less of giving to all its terms, legal\r\nand technical, their exact equivalent in the laws and language of\r\nthat country. Should any translation which Congress would undertake to\r\npublish, for the use of our courts, be conceived on any occasion not to\r\nrender fully the idea of the French original, it might be imputed as an\r\nindirect attempt to abridge or extend the terms of a contract, at the\r\nwill of one party only. At no place are there better helps than here,\r\nfor establishing an English text equivalent to the French, in all its\r\nphrases; no persons can be supposed to know what is meant by these\r\nphrases, better than those who form them; and no time more proper to\r\nascertain their meaning in both languages than that at which they are\r\nformed. I have, therefore, the honor to propose, that the convention\r\nshall be faithfully expressed in English as well as in French, in two\r\ncolumns, side by side, that these columns be declared each of them to be\r\ntext, and to be equally original and authentic in all courts of justice.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is a general sketch of the alterations, which our laws and\r\nour manner of thinking render necessary in this convention, before the\r\nfaith of our country is engaged for its execution. Some of its articles,\r\nin their present form, could not be executed at all, and others would\r\nproduce embarrassments and ill humor, to which it would not be prudent\r\nfor our government to commit itself. Inexact execution on the one part,\r\nwould naturally beget dissatisfaction and complaints on the other; and\r\nan instrument intended to strengthen our connection, might thus become\r\nthe means of loosening it. Fewer articles, better observed, will better\r\npromote our common interests. As to ourselves, we do not find the\r\ninstitution of consuls very necessary. Its history commences in times of\r\nbarbarism, and might well have ended with them. During these, they were,\r\nperhaps, useful, and may still be so in countries not yet emerged from\r\nthat condition. But all civilized nations at this day understand so\r\nwell the advantages of commerce, that they provide protection and\r\nencouragement for merchant strangers and vessels coming among them.\r\nSo extensive, too, have commercial connections now become, that every\r\nmercantile house has correspondents in almost every port. They address\r\ntheir vessels to these correspondents, who are found to take better care\r\nof their interests, and to obtain more effectually the protection of the\r\nlaws of the country for them, than the consul of their nation can. He is\r\ngenerally a foreigner, unpossessed of the little details of knowledge\r\nof greatest use to them. He makes national questions of all the\r\ndifficulties which arise; the correspondent prevents them. We carry on\r\ncommerce with good success in all parts of the world; yet we have not\r\na consul in a single port, nor a complaint for the want of one, except\r\nfrom the persons who wish to be consuls themselves. Though these\r\nconsiderations may not be strong enough to establish the absolute\r\ninutility of consuls, they may make us less anxious to extend their\r\nprivileges and jurisdictions, so as to render them objects of jealousy\r\nand irritation, in the places of their residence. That this government\r\nthinks them useful, is sufficient reason for us to give them all the\r\nfunctions and facilities which our circumstances will admit. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of declining every article which will be useless to us, we\r\naccede to every one which will not be inconvenient. Had this nation been\r\nalone concerned, our desire to gratify them might have tempted us to\r\npress still harder on the laws and opinions of our country. But your\r\nExcellency knows, that we stand engaged in treaties with some nations,\r\nwhich will give them occasion to claim whatever privileges we yield to\r\nany other. This renders circumspection more necessary. Permit me to add\r\none other observation. The English allow to foreign consuls scarcely any\r\nfunctions within their ports. This proceeds, in a great measure, from\r\nthe character of their laws, which eye, with peculiar jealousy, every\r\nexemption from their control. Ours are the same in their general\r\ncharacter, and rendered still more unpliant, by our having thirteen\r\nparliaments to relax, instead of one. Upon the whole, I hope your\r\nExcellency will see the causes of the delay which this convention has\r\nmet with, in the difficulties it presents, and our desire to surmount\r\nthem: and will be sensible that the alterations proposed, are dictated\r\nto us by the necessity of our circumstances, and by a caution, which\r\ncannot be disapproved, to commit ourselves to no engagements which we\r\nforesee we might not be able o fulfil.\r\n\r\nThese alterations, with some other smaller ones, which may be offered\r\non the sole principle of joint convenience, shall be the subject of more\r\nparticular explanation, whenever your Excellency shall honor me with\r\na conference thereon. I shall then, also, point out the verbal changes\r\nwhich appear to me necessary, to accommodate the instrument to the\r\nviews before expressed. In the mean time, I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect respect and esteem, your Excellency’s\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIV.--TO DOCTOR GORDON, July 16, 1788\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR GORDON.\r\n\r\nParis, July 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn your favor of the 8th instant, you mentioned that you had written to\r\nme in February last. This letter never came to hand. That of April\r\nthe 24th came here during my absence on a journey through Holland and\r\nGermany; and my having been obliged to devote the first moments after my\r\nreturn to some very pressing matters, must be my apology for not having\r\nbeen able to write to you till now. As soon as I knew that it would be\r\nagreeable to you to have such a disposal of your work for translation,\r\nas I had made for Dr. Ramsay, I applied to the same bookseller with\r\npropositions on your behalf. He told me, that he had lost so much by\r\nthat work, that he could hardly think of undertaking another, and, at\r\nany rate, not without first seeing and examining it. As he was the only\r\nbookseller I could induce to give any thing on the former occasion,\r\nI went to no other with my proposal, meaning to ask you to send me\r\nimmediately as much of the work as is printed. This you can do by\r\nthe Diligence, which comes three times a week from London to Paris.\r\nFurnished with this, I will renew my proposition, and do the best for\r\nyou I can; though I fear that the ill success of the translation of\r\nDr. Ramsay’s work, and of another work on the subject of America, will\r\npermit less to be done for you than I had hoped. I think Dr. Ramsay\r\nfailed from the inelegance of the translation, and the translator’s\r\nhaving departed entirely from the Doctor’s instructions. I will be\r\nobliged to you, to set me down as subscriber for half a dozen copies,\r\nand to ask Mr. Trumbull (No. 2, North street, Rathbone Place) to pay\r\nyou the whole subscription price for me, which he will do on showing him\r\nthis letter. These copies can be sent by the Diligence. I have not yet\r\nreceived the pictures Mr. Trumbull was to send me, nor consequently that\r\nof M. de la Fayette. I will take care of it when it arrives. His title\r\nis simply, Le Marquis de la Fayette.\r\n\r\nYou ask, in your letter of April the 24th, details of my sufferings by\r\nColonel Tarleton. I did not suffer by him. On the contrary, he behaved\r\nvery genteelly with me. On his approach to Charlottesville, which is\r\nwithin three miles of my house at Monticello, he despatched a troop of\r\nhis horse, under Captain McLeod, with the double object of taking me\r\nprisoner, with the two Speakers of the Senate and Delegates, who then\r\nlodged with me, and of remaining there in _vidette_, my house commanding\r\na view often or twelve miles round about. He gave strict orders to\r\nCaptain McLeod to suffer nothing to be injured. The troop failed in\r\none of their objects, as we had notice of their coming, so that the\r\ntwo Speakers had gone off about two hours before their arrival at\r\nMonticello, and myself, with my family, about five minutes. But Captain\r\nMcLeod preserved every thing with sacred care, during about eighteen\r\nhours that he remained there. Colonel Tarleton was just so long at\r\nCharlottesville, being hurried from thence by the news of the rising of\r\nthe militia, and by a sudden fall of rain which threatened to swell the\r\nriver and intercept his return. In general he did little injury to the\r\ninhabitants on that short and hasty excursion, which was of about sixty\r\nmiles from their main army, then in Spotsylvania, and ours in Orange. It\r\nwas early in June, 1781. Lord Cornwallis then proceeded to the Point of\r\nFork, and encamped his army from thence all along the main James River,\r\nto a seat of mine called Elk-hill, opposite to Elk Island, and a little\r\nbelow the mouth of the Byrd Creek. (You will see all these places\r\nexactly laid down in the map annexed to my Notes on Virginia, printed by\r\nStockdale.) He remained in this position ten days, his own head-quarters\r\nbeing in my house, at that place. I had time to remove most of the\r\neffects out of the house. He destroyed all my growing crops of corn and\r\ntobacco; he burned all my barns, containing the same articles of the\r\nlast year, having first taken what corn he wanted; he used, as was to be\r\nexpected, all my stock of cattle, sheep, and hogs, for the sustenance\r\nof his army, and carried off all the horses capable of service; of those\r\ntoo young for service he cut the throats; and he burned all the fences\r\non the plantation so as to leave it an absolute waste. He carried off\r\nalso about thirty slaves. Had this been to give them freedom, he would\r\nhave done right: but it was to consign them to inevitable death from\r\nthe small-pox and putrid fever, then raging in his camp. This I knew\r\nafterwards to be the fate of twenty-seven of them. I never had news of\r\nthe remaining three, but presume they shared the same fate. When I say\r\nthat Lord Cornwallis did all this, I do not mean that he carried about\r\nthe torch in his own hands, but that it was all done under his eye; the\r\nsituation of the house in which he was, commanding a view of every part\r\nof the plantation, so that he must have seen every fire. I relate these\r\nthings on my own knowledge, in a great degree, as I was on the ground\r\nsoon after he left it. He treated the rest of the neighborhood somewhat\r\nin the same style, but not with that spirit of total extermination\r\nwith which he seemed to rage over my possessions. Wherever he went, the\r\ndwelling-houses were plundered of every thing which could be carried\r\noff. Lord Cornwallis’s character in England would forbid the belief that\r\nhe shared in the plunder; but that his table was served with the\r\nplate thus pillaged from private houses, can be proved by many hundred\r\neye-witnesses. From an estimate I made at that time, on the best\r\ninformation I could collect, I supposed the State of Virginia lost under\r\nLord Cornwallis’s hands, that year, about thirty thousand slaves; and\r\nthat of these, about twenty-seven thousand died of the small-pox and\r\ncamp-fever, and the rest were partly sent to the West Indies, and\r\nexchanged for rum, sugar, coffee, and fruit, and partly sent to New\r\nYork, from whence they went, at the peace, either to Nova Scotia or\r\nEngland. From this last place, I believe they have been lately sent to\r\nAfrica. History will never relate the horrors committed by the British\r\narmy, in the southern States of America. They raged in Virginia six\r\nmonths only, from the middle of April to the middle of October, 1781,\r\nwhen they were all taken prisoners; and I give you a faithful specimen\r\nof their transactions for ten days of that time, and on one spot only.\r\n_Ex pede Herculem_. I suppose their whole devastations during those six\r\nmonths, amounted to about three millions sterling. The copiousness of\r\nthis subject has only left me space to assure you of the sentiments of\r\nesteem and respect, with which I am, Sir, your most obedient, humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLV.--TO JAMES MADISON, July 19, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON, _of William and Mary College_.\r\n\r\nParis, July 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was of the 13th of August last. As you seem\r\nwilling to accept of the crumbs of science on which we are subsisting\r\nhere, it is with pleasure I continue to hand them on to you, in\r\nproportion as they are dealt out. Herschel’s volcano in the moon you\r\nhave doubtless heard of, and placed among the other vagaries of a head,\r\nwhich seems not organized for sound induction. The wildness of the\r\ntheories hitherto proposed by him, on his own discoveries, seems to\r\nauthorize us to consider his merit as that of a good optician only. You\r\nknow also, that Doctor Ingenhouse had discovered, as he supposed from\r\nexperiment, that vegetation might be promoted by occasioning streams of\r\nthe electrical fluid to pass through a plant, and that other physicians\r\nhad received and confirmed this theory. He now, however, retracts it,\r\nand finds by more decisive experiments, that the electrical fluid can\r\nneither forward nor retard vegetation. Uncorrected still of the rage of\r\ndrawing general conclusions from partial and equivocal observations, he\r\nhazards the opinion that light promotes vegetation. I have heretofore\r\nsupposed from observation, that light affects the color of living\r\nbodies, whether vegetable or animal; but that either the one or the\r\nother receives nutriment from that fluid, must be permitted to be\r\ndoubted of, till better confirmed by observation. It is always better to\r\nhave no ideas, than false ones; to believe nothing, than to believe what\r\nis wrong. In my mind, theories are more easily demolished than rebuilt.\r\n\r\nAn Abbe here, has shaken, if not destroyed, the theory of De Dominis,\r\nDescartes and Newton, for explaining the phenomenon of the rainbow.\r\nAccording to that theory, you know, a cone of rays issuing from the sun,\r\nand falling on a cloud in the opposite part of the heavens, is reflected\r\nback in the form of a smaller cone, the apex of which is the eye of the\r\nobserver: so that the eye of the observer must be in the axis of both\r\ncones, and equally distant from every part of the bow. But he observes,\r\nthat he has repeatedly seen bows, the one end of which has been very\r\nnear to him, and the other at a very great distance. I have often\r\nseen the same thing myself. I recollect well to have seen the end of a\r\nrainbow between myself and a house, or between myself and a bank, not\r\ntwenty yards distant; and this repeatedly. But I never saw, what he\r\nsays he has seen, different rainbows at the same time, intersecting\r\neach other. I never saw coexistent bows, which were not concentric\r\nalso. Again, according to the theory, if the sun is in the horizon, the\r\nhorizon intercepts the lower half of the bow, if above the horizon, that\r\nintercepts more than the half, in proportion. So that generally the bow\r\nis less than a semicircle, and never more. He says he has seen it more\r\nthan a semicircle. I have often seen the leg of the bow below my level.\r\nMy situation at Monticello admits this, because there is a mountain\r\nthere in the opposite direction of the afternoon’s sun, the valley\r\nbetween which and Monticello is five hundred feet deep. I have seen a\r\nleg of a rainbow plunge down on the river running through the valley.\r\nBut I do not recollect to have remarked at any time, that the bow was\r\nmore than half a circle. It appears to me, that these facts demolish the\r\nNewtonian hypothesis, but they do not support that erected in its stead\r\nby the Abbe. He supposes a cloud between the sun and observer, and that\r\nthrough some opening in that cloud, the rays pass, and form an iris on\r\nthe opposite part of the heavens, just as a ray passing through a hole\r\nin the shutter of a darkened room, and falling on a prism there, forms\r\nthe prismatic colors on the opposite wall. According to this, we might\r\nsee bows of more than the half circle, as often as of less. A thousand\r\nother objections occur to this hypothesis, which need not be suggested\r\nto you. The result is, that we are wiser than we were, by having an\r\nerror the less in our catalogue; but the blank occasioned by it, must\r\nremain for some happier hypothesist to fill up.\r\n\r\nThe dispute about the conversion and reconversion of water and air, is\r\nstill stoutly kept up. The contradictory experiments of chemists, leave\r\nus at liberty to conclude what we please. My conclusion is, that art has\r\nnot yet invented sufficient aids, to enable such subtle bodies to make a\r\nwell defined impression on organs as blunt as ours: that it is laudable\r\nto encourage investigation, but to hold back conclusion. Speaking one\r\nday with Monsieur de Buffon on the present ardor of chemical inquiry, he\r\naffected to consider chemistry but as cookery, and to place the toils\r\nof the laboratory on a footing with those of the kitchen. I think it,\r\non the contrary, among the most useful of sciences, and big with future\r\ndiscoveries for the utility and safety of the human race. It is yet,\r\nindeed, a mere embryon. Its principles are contested; experiments seem\r\ncontradictory; their subjects are so minute as to escape our senses; and\r\ntheir result too fallacious to satisfy the mind. It is probably an\r\nage too soon, to propose the establishment of a system. The attempt,\r\ntherefore, of Lavoisier to reform the chemical nomenclature, is\r\npremature. One single experiment may destroy the whole filiation of\r\nhis terms, and his string of sulfates, sulfiles, and sulfures may have\r\nserved no other end, than to have retarded the progress of the science,\r\nby a jargon, from the confusion of which, time will be requisite to\r\nextricate us. Accordingly, it is not likely to be admitted generally.\r\n\r\nYou are acquainted with the properties of the composition of nitre,\r\nsalt of tartar, and sulphur, called _pulvis fulminans_. Of this, the\r\nexplosion is produced by heat alone. Monsieur Bertholet, by dissolving\r\nsilver in the nitrous acid, precipitating it with lime-water, and drying\r\nthe precipitate on ammoniac, has discovered a powder, which fulminates\r\nmost powerfully, on coming into contact with any substance whatever.\r\nOnce made, it cannot be touched. It cannot be put into a bottle, but\r\nmust remain in the capsula, where dried. The property of the spathic\r\nacid, to corrode flinty substances, has been lately applied by a Mr.\r\nPuymaurin, to engrave on glass, as artists engrave on copper, with\r\naquafortis.\r\n\r\nM. de la Place has discovered, that the secular acceleration and\r\nretardation of the moon’s motion, is occasioned by the action of the\r\nsun, in proportion as his excentricity changes, or, in other words,\r\nas the orbit of the earth increases or diminishes. So that this\r\nirregularity is now perfectly calculable.\r\n\r\nHaving seen announced in a gazette, that some person had found, in a\r\nlibrary of Sicily, an Arabic translation of Livy, which was thought to\r\nbe complete, I got the _chargé des affaires_ of Naples here, to write to\r\nNaples to inquire into the fact. He obtained in answer, that an Arabic\r\ntranslation was found, and that it would restore to us seventeen of the\r\nbooks lost, to wit, from the sixtieth to the seventy-seventh, inclusive:\r\nthat it was in possession of an Abbe Vella, who, as soon as he shall\r\nhave finished a work he has on hand, will give us an Italian, and\r\nperhaps a Latin translation of this Livy. There are persons, however,\r\nwho doubt the truth of this discovery, founding their doubts on some\r\npersonal circumstances relating to the person who says he has this\r\ntranslation. I find, nevertheless, that the _chargé des affaires_\r\nbelieves in the discovery, which makes me hope it may be true.\r\n\r\nA countryman of ours, a Mr. Ledyard of Connecticut, set out from hence\r\nsome time ago for St. Petersburg, to go thence to Kamtschatka, thence\r\nto cross over to the western coast of America, and penetrate through\r\nthe continent, to the other side of it. He had got within a few days’\r\njourney of Kamtschatka, when he was arrested by order of the Empress\r\nof Russia, sent back, and turned adrift in Poland. He went to London;\r\nengaged under the auspices of a private society, formed there for\r\npushing discoveries into Africa; passed by this place, which he left\r\na few days ago for Marseilles, where he will embark for Alexandria and\r\nGrand Cairo; thence explore the Nile to its source; cross the head of\r\nthe Niger, and descend that to its mouth. He promises me, if he escapes\r\nthrough his journey, he will go to Kentucky, and endeavor to penetrate\r\nwestwardly to the South Sea.\r\n\r\nThe death of M. de Buffon you have heard long ago. I do not know whether\r\nwe shall have anything posthumous of his. As to political news, this\r\ncountry is making its way to a good constitution. The only danger is,\r\nthey may press so fast as to produce an appeal to arms, which might have\r\nan unfavorable issue for them. As yet the appeal is not made. Perhaps\r\nthe war, which seems to be spreading from nation to nation, may reach\r\nthem this would insure the calling of the States General, and this, as\r\nis supposed, the establishment of a constitution.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and respect,\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVI.--TO E. RUTLEDGE, July 18, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMessrs. Berard were to have given me particular accounts of the proceeds\r\nof the shipments of rice made to them. But they have failed. I fear,\r\nfrom what they mention, that the price has been less advantageous than\r\nusual; which is unlucky, as it falls the first essay. If on the whole,\r\nhowever, you get as much as you would have done by a sale on the spot,\r\nit should encourage other adventures, because the price at Havre or\r\nRouen is commonly higher, and because I think you may, by trials, find\r\nout the way to avail yourselves of the Paris retail price. The Carolina\r\nrice, sold at Paris, is separated into three kinds; 1. the whole grains;\r\n2. the broken grains; 3. the small stuff; and sell at ten, eight, and\r\nsix livres the French pound, retail. The whole grains, which constitute\r\nthe first quality, are picked out by hand. I would not recommend this\r\noperation to be done with you, because labor is dearer there than here.\r\nBut I mention these prices, to show, that after making a reasonable\r\ndeduction for sorting, and leaving a reasonable profit to the retailer,\r\nthere should still remain a great wholesale price. I shall wish to know\r\nfrom you, how much your cargo of rice shipped to Berard netts you, and\r\nhow much it would have _netted_ in hard money, if you had sold it at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nYou promise, in your letter of October the 23rd, 1787, to give me in\r\nyour next, at large, the conjectures of your philosopher on the descent\r\nof the Creek Indians from the Carthaginians, supposed to have been\r\nseparated from Hanno’s fleet, during his periplus. I shall be very glad\r\nto receive them, and see nothing impossible in his conjecture. I am glad\r\nhe means to appeal to similarity of language, which I consider as the\r\nstrongest kind of proof it is possible to adduce. I have somewhere read,\r\nthat the language of the ancient Carthaginians is still spoken by their\r\ndescendants, inhabiting the mountainous interior parts of Barbary, to\r\nwhich they were obliged to retire by the conquering Arabs. If so, a\r\nvocabulary of their tongue can still be got, and if your friend will get\r\none of the Creek languages, the comparison will decide. He probably may\r\nhave made progress in this business: but if he wishes any inquiries to\r\nbe made on this side the Atlantic, I offer him my services cheerfully;\r\nmy wish being, like his to ascertain the history of the American\r\naborigines.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the accesion of your State to the new federal\r\nconstitution. This is the last I have yet heard of, but I expect daily\r\nto hear that my own has followed the good example, and suppose it to be\r\nalready established. Our government wanted bracing. Still we must take\r\ncare not to run from one extreme to another; not to brace too high. I\r\nown, I join those in opinion, who think a bill of rights necessary. I\r\napprehend too, that the total abandonment of the principle of rotation\r\nin the offices of President and Senator, will end in abuse. But my\r\nconfidence is, that there will, for a long time, be virtue and good\r\nsense enough in our countrymen, to correct abuses. We can surely boast\r\nof having set the world a beautiful example of a government reformed by\r\nreason alone, without bloodshed. But the world is too far oppressed to\r\nprofit by the example. On this side of the Atlantic, the blood of the\r\npeople has become an inheritance, and those who fatten on it, will\r\nnot relinquish it easily. The struggle in this country is, as yet,\r\nof doubtful issue. It is, in fact, between the monarchy and the\r\nparliaments. The nation is no otherwise concerned, but as both parties\r\nmay be induced to let go some of its abuses, to court the public favor.\r\nThe danger is, that the people, deceived by a false cry of liberty, may\r\nbe led to take side with one party, and thus give the other a pretext\r\nfor crushing them still more. If they can avoid the appeal to arms, the\r\nnation will be sure to gain much by this controversy. But if that appeal\r\nis made, it will depend entirely on the disposition of the army, whether\r\nit issue in liberty or despotism. Those dispositions are not as yet\r\nknown. In the mean time, there is great probability that the war kindled\r\nin the east, will spread from nation to nation, and, in the long run,\r\nbecome general.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am, with the most sincere esteem and attachment, my dear; Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVII.--TO MR. BELLINI, July 25,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BELLINI.\r\n\r\nParis, July 25,1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThough I have written to you seldom, you are often the object of\r\nmy thoughts, and always of my affection. The truth is, that the\r\ncircumstances with which I am surrounded, offer little worth detailing\r\nto you. You are too wise to feel an interest in the squabbles, in\r\nwhich the pride, the dissipations, and the tyranny of kings, keep this\r\nhemisphere constantly embroiled. Science, indeed, finds some aliment\r\nhere, and you are one of her sons. But this I have pretty regularly\r\ncommunicated to Mr. Madison, with whom, I am sure, you participate of\r\nit. It is with sincere pleasure I congratulate you on the good fortune\r\nof our friend Mazzei, who is appointed here, to correspond with the King\r\nof Poland. The particular character given him is not well defined, but\r\nthe salary is, which is more important. It is eight thousand livres a\r\nyear, which will enable him to live comfortably, while his duties will\r\nfind him that occupation, without which he cannot exist. Whilst this\r\nappointment places him at his ease, it affords a hope of permanence\r\nalso. It suspends, if not entirely prevents, the visit he had intended\r\nto his native country, and the return to his adoptive one, which the\r\ndeath of his wife had rendered possible. This last event has given him\r\nthree quarters of the globe elbow-room, which he had ceded to her, on\r\ncondition she would leave him quiet in the fourth. Their partition of\r\nthe next world will be more difficult, if it be divided only into two\r\nparts, according to the protestant faith. Having seen by a letter you\r\nwrote him, that you were in want of a pair of spectacles, I undertook\r\nto procure you some, which I packed in a box of books addressed to Mr.\r\nWythe, and of which I beg your acceptance. This box lay forgotten at\r\nHavre the whole of the last winter, but was at length shipped, and I\r\ntrust has come to hand. I packed with the spectacles three or four pair\r\nof glasses, adapted to the different periods of life, distinguished from\r\neach other by numbers, and easily changed. You see I am looking forward\r\nin hope of a long life for you; and that it may be long enough to carry\r\nyou through the whole succession of glasses, is my sincere prayer.\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Bellini, assure her of my affectionate\r\nremembrance of her, and my wishes for her health and happiness; and\r\naccept yourself very sincere professions of the esteem and attachment\r\nwith which I am, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, July 31, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, July 31, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you were of the 3rd and the 25th of May. Yours from\r\nOrange, of April the 22nd, came to hand on the 10th instant.\r\n\r\nMy letter to Mr. Jay containing all the public news that is well\r\nauthenticated, I will not repeat it here, but add some details in the\r\nsmaller way, which you may be glad to know. The disgrace of the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette, which, at any other period of their history, would have\r\nhad the worst consequences for him, will, on the contrary, mark him\r\nfavorably to the nation, at present. During the present administration,\r\nhe can expect nothing; but perhaps it may serve him with their\r\nsuccessors, whenever a change shall take place. No change of the\r\nPrincipal will probably take place, before the meeting of the States\r\nGeneral; though a change is to be wished, for his operations do not\r\nanswer the expectations formed of him. These had been calculated, on his\r\nbrilliancy in society. He is very feebly aided too. Montmorin is weak,\r\nthough a most worthy character. He is indolent and inattentive too,\r\nin the extreme. Luzerne is considerably inferior in abilities to his\r\nbrother, whom you know. He is a good man too, but so much out of his\r\nelement, that he has the air of one _huskanoyed_. The _Garde des Sceaux_\r\nis considered as the Principal’s bull-dog, braving danger like the\r\nanimal. His talents do not pass mediocrity. The Archbishop’s brother,\r\nand the new minister Villedeuil, and Lambert, have no will of their\r\nown. They cannot raise money for the peace establishment the next\r\nyear, without the States General; much less if there be war; and their\r\nadministration will probably end with the States General.\r\n\r\nLittlepage, who was here as a secret agent for the King of Poland,\r\nrather overreached himself. He wanted more money. The King furnished it,\r\nmore than once. Still he wanted more, and thought to obtain a high bid,\r\nby saying he was called for in America, and asking leave to go there.\r\nContrary to his expectation, he received leave; but he went to Warsaw\r\ninstead of America, and from thence, to join the * * * * I do not know\r\n\r\n     [* Several paragraphs of this letter are in cipher, A few\r\n     words here could not be deciphered.]\r\n\r\nthese facts certainly, but collect them, by putting several things\r\ntogether. The King then sent an ancient secretary here, in whom he had\r\nmuch confidence, to look out for a correspondent, a mere letter-writer\r\nfor him. A happy hazard threw Mazzei in his way. He recommended him,\r\nand he is appointed. He has no diplomatic character whatever, but is to\r\nreceive eight thousand livres a year, as an intelligencer. I hope\r\nthis employment may have some permanence. The danger is, that he will\r\nover-act his part.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Luzerne had been for many years married to his\r\nbrother’s wife’s sister, secretly. She was ugly and deformed, but\r\nsensible, amiable, and rather rich. When he was ambassador to London,\r\nwith ten thousand guineas a year, the marriage was avowed, and he\r\nrelinquished his cross of Malta, from which he derived a handsome\r\nrevenue for life, and which was very open to advancement. Not long ago,\r\nshe died. His real affection for her, which was great and unfeigned, and\r\nperhaps the loss of his order, for so short-lived a satisfaction, has\r\nthrown him almost into a state of despondency. He is now here.\r\n\r\nI send you a book of Dupont’s, on the subject of the commercial treaty\r\nwith England. Though its general matter may not be interesting, yet\r\nyou will pick up, in various parts of it, such excellent principles and\r\nobservations, as will richly repay the trouble of reading it. I send\r\nyou, also, two little pamphlets of the Marquis de Condorcet, wherein is\r\nthe most judicious statement I have seen, of the great questions\r\nwhich agitate this nation at present. The new regulations present a\r\npreponderance of good over their evil; but they suppose that the\r\nKing can model the constitution at will, or, in other words, that his\r\ngovernment is a pure despotism. The question then arising is, whether a\r\npure despotism in a single head, or one which is divided among a king,\r\nnobles, priesthood, and numerous magistracy, is the least bad. I should\r\nbe puzzled to decide: but I hope they will have neither, and that they\r\nare advancing to a limited, moderate government, in which the people\r\nwill have a good share.\r\n\r\nI sincerely rejoice at the acceptance of our new constitution by\r\nnine States. It is a good canvass, on which some strokes only want\r\nretouching. What these are, I think are sufficiently manifested by the\r\ngeneral voice from north to south, which calls for a bill of rights.\r\nIt seems pretty generally understood, that this should go to juries,\r\n_habeas corpus_, standing armies, printing, religion, and monopolies.\r\nI conceive there may be difficulty in finding general modifications of\r\nthese, suited to the habits of all the States. But if such cannot be\r\nfound, then it is better to establish trials by jury, the right of\r\n_habeas corpus_, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion, in all\r\ncases, and to abolish standing armies in time of peace, and monopolies\r\nin all cases, than not to do it in any. The few cases wherein these\r\nthings may do evil, cannot be weighed against the multitude, wherein the\r\nwant of them will do evil. In disputes between a foreigner and a native,\r\na trial by jury may be improper. But if this exception cannot be agreed\r\nto, the remedy will be to model the jury, by giving the _medietas\r\nlinguæ_, in civil as well as criminal cases. Why suspend the _habeas\r\ncorpus_ in insurrections and rebellions? The parties who may be\r\narrested, may be charged instantly with a well-defined crime: of course,\r\nthe judge will remand them. If the public safety requires, that the\r\ngovernment should have a man imprisoned on less probable testimony in\r\nthose than in other emergencies, let him be taken and tried, retaken and\r\nretried, while the necessity continues, only giving him redress against\r\nthe government, for damages. Examine the history of England. See how\r\nfew of the cases of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ law have been\r\nworthy of that suspension. They have been either real treason, wherein\r\nthe parties might as well have been charged at once, or sham plots,\r\nwhere it was shameful they should ever have been suspected. Yet for the\r\nfew cases, wherein the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ has done real\r\ngood, that operation is now become habitual, and the minds of the nation\r\nalmost prepared to live under its constant suspension. A declaration,\r\nthat the federal government will never restrain the presses from\r\nprinting any thing they please, will not take away the liability of the\r\nprinters for false facts printed. The declaration, that religious faith\r\nshall be unpunished, does not give impunity to criminal acts, dictated\r\nby religious error. The saying--there shall be no monopolies, lessens\r\nthe incitements to ingenuity, which is spurred on by the hope of a\r\nmonopoly for a limited time, as of fourteen years; but the benefit of\r\neven limited monopolies is too doubtful, to be opposed to that of their\r\ngeneral suppression. If no check can be found to keep the number of\r\nstanding troops within safe bounds, while they are tolerated as far as\r\nnecessary, abandon them altogether, discipline well the militia,\r\nand guard the magazines with them. More than magazine guards will be\r\nuseless, if few, and dangerous, if many. No European nation can ever\r\nsend against us such a regular army as we need fear, and it is hard, if\r\nour militia are not equal to those of Canada or Florida. My idea then,\r\nis, that though proper exceptions to these general rules are desirable,\r\nand probably practicable, yet if the exceptions cannot be agreed on,\r\nthe establishment of the rules, in all cases, will do ill in very few.\r\nI hope, therefore, a bill of rights will be formed, to guard the people\r\nagainst the federal government, as they are already guarded against\r\ntheir State governments, in most instances. The abandoning the principle\r\nof necessary rotation in the Senate, has, I see, been disapproved by\r\nmany: in the case of the President, by none. I readily, therefore,\r\nsuppose my opinion wrong, when opposed by the majority, as in the former\r\ninstance, and the totality, as in the latter. In this, however, I should\r\nhave done it with more complete satisfaction, had we all judged from the\r\nsame position.\r\n\r\nSolicitations, which cannot be directly refused, oblige me to trouble\r\nyou often with letters, recommending and introducing to you persons who\r\ngo from hence to America. I will beg the favor of you to distinguish\r\nthe letters wherein I appeal to recommendations from other persons, from\r\nthose which I write on my own knowledge. In the former, it is never my\r\nintention to compromit myself or you. In both instances, I must beg you\r\nto ascribe the trouble I give you, to circumstances which do not leave\r\nme at liberty to decline it.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIX.--TO JOHN JAY, August 3, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you were of the 4th and 23d of May, with a Postscript\r\nof the 27th. Since that, I have been honored with yours of April the\r\n24th, May the 16th, and June the 9th.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable internal occurrences since my last are these. The\r\n_Noblesse_ of Bretagne, who had received with so much warmth the late\r\ninnovations in the government, assembled, and drew up a memorial to the\r\nKing, and chose twelve members of their body to come and present it.\r\nAmong these was the Marquis de la Rouerie (Colonel Armand). The King,\r\nconsidering the _Noblesse_ as having no legal right to assemble,\r\ndeclined receiving the memorial. The deputies, to give greater weight to\r\nit, called a meeting of the landed proprietors of Bretagne, resident at\r\nParis, and proposed to them to add their signatures--They did so, to the\r\nnumber of about sixty, of whom the Marquis de la Fayette was one. The\r\ntwelve deputies, for having called this meeting, were immediately\r\nsent to the Bastile where they now are, and the Parisian signers were\r\ndeprived of such favors as they held of the court. There were only four\r\nof them, however, who held any thing of that kind. The Marquis de la\r\nFayette was one of these. They had given him a military command, to\r\nbe exercised in the south of France, during the months of August and\r\nSeptember of the present year. This they took from him; so that he is\r\ndisgraced, in the ancient language of the court, but in truth, honorably\r\nmarked in the eyes of the nation. The ministers are so sensible of\r\nthis, that they have had, separately, private conferences with him, to\r\nendeavor, through him, to keep things quiet. From the character of the\r\nprovince of Bretagne, it was much apprehended, for some days, that the\r\nimprisonment of their deputies would have produced an insurrection.\r\nBut it took another turn. The _Cours intermédiaire_ of the province,\r\nacknowledged to be a legal body, deputed eighteen members of their body\r\nto the King. To these he gave an audience, and the answer, of which I\r\nsend you a copy. This is hard enough. Yet I am in hopes the appeal to\r\nthe sword will be avoided, and great modifications in the government be\r\nobtained without bloodshed. As yet none has been spilt, according to\r\nthe best evidence I have been able to obtain, notwithstanding what the\r\nforeign newspapers have said to the contrary. The convocation of the\r\nStates General has now become inevitable. Whenever the time shall be\r\nannounced certainly, it will keep the nation quiet till they meet.\r\nAccording to present probabilities, this must be in the course of the\r\nnext summer; but to what movements their meeting and measures may give\r\noccasion, cannot be foreseen. Should a foreign war take place, still\r\nthey must assemble the States General, because they cannot, but by\r\ntheir aid, obtain money to carry it on. Monsieur de Malesherbes will, I\r\nbelieve, retire from the King’s Council. He has been much opposed to\r\nthe late acts of authority. The Baron de Breteuil has resigned his\r\nsecretaryship of the domestic department; certainly not for the same\r\nreasons, as he is known to have been of opinion, that the King had\r\ncompromitted too much of his authority. The real reason has probably\r\nbeen, an impatience of acting under a principal minister. His successor\r\nis M. de Villedeuil, lately Comptroller General.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors of Tippoo Saib have arrived here. If their mission has\r\nany other object than that of pomp and ceremony, it is not yet made\r\nknown. Though this court has not avowed that they are in possession of\r\nTrincomale, yet the report is believed, and that possession was taken by\r\nGeneral Conway, in consequence of orders given in the moment that they\r\nthought a war certain. The dispute with the States General of the United\r\nNetherlands, on account of the insult to M. de St. Priest, does not tend\r\nas yet towards a settlement. He has obtained leave to go to the waters,\r\nand perhaps from thence he may come to Paris, to await events. Sweden\r\nhas commenced hostilities against Russia, by the taking a little\r\nfortress by land. This having been their intention, it is wonderful,\r\nthat when their fleet lately met three Russian ships of one hundred guns\r\neach, they saluted instead of taking them. The Empress has declared war\r\nagainst them in her turn. It is well understood, that Sweden is set\r\non by England, and paid by the Turks. The prospect of Russia has much\r\nbrightened by some late successes. Their fleet of galleys and gun-boats,\r\ntwenty-seven in number, having been attacked by fifty-seven Turkish\r\nvessels of the same kind, commanded by the Captain Pacha, these were\r\nrepulsed, with the loss of three vessels. In the action, which was on\r\nthe 18th of June, Admiral Paul Jones commanded the right wing of the\r\nRussians, and the Prince of Nassau the left. On the 26th of the same\r\nmonth, the Turkish principal fleet, that is to say, their ships of the\r\nline, frigates, &c, having got themselves near the swash, at the\r\nmouth of the Borysthenes, the Prince of Nassau took advantage of their\r\nposition, attacked them while so engaged in the mud that they could not\r\nmanoeuvre, burnt six, among which were the admiral’s and vice-admiral’s,\r\ntook two, and made between three and four thousand prisoners. The first\r\nreports gave this success to Admiral Paul Jones; but it is now rendered\r\nrather probable that he was not there, as he commands the vessels of war\r\nwhich are said not to have been there. It is supposed, that his presence\r\nin the affair of the 18th was accidental. But if this success has been\r\nso complete as it is represented, the Black Sea must be tolerably open\r\nto the Russians: in which case, we may expect, from what we know of that\r\nofficer, that he will improve to the greatest advantage the situation of\r\nthings on that sea. The Captain Pacha’s standard was taken in the last\r\naction, and himself obliged to make his escape in a small vessel. Prince\r\nPotemkin immediately got under march for Oczakow, to take advantage of\r\nthe consternation into which that place was thrown.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish squadron, after cruising off the Western Isles and Cape St.\r\nVincent, has returned into port.\r\n\r\nA dispute has arisen between the Papal See and the King of Naples, which\r\nmay, in its progress, enable us to estimate what degree of influence\r\nthat See retains at the present day. The kingdom of Naples, at an early\r\nperiod of its history, became feudatory to the See of Rome, and in\r\nacknowledgment thereof, has annually paid a hackney to the Pope in\r\nRome, to which place it has always been sent by a splendid embassy. The\r\nhackney has been refused by the King this year, and the Pope, giving\r\nhim three months to return to obedience, threatens, if he does not, to\r\nproceed seriously against him.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks ago a person called on me, and informed me, that Silas\r\nDeane had taken him in for a sum of one hundred and twenty guineas, and\r\nthat being unable to obtain any other satisfaction, he had laid hands on\r\nhis account book and letter book, and had brought them off to Paris,\r\nto offer them first to the United States, if they would repay him his\r\nmoney, and if not, that he should return to London, and offer them\r\nto the British minister. I desired him to leave them with me four and\r\ntwenty hours, that I might judge whether they were worth our notice. He\r\ndid so. They were two volumes. One contained all his accounts with the\r\nUnited States, from his first coming to Europe to January the 10th,\r\n1781. Presuming that the treasury board was in possession of this\r\naccount till his arrival in Philadelphia, August, 1778, and that he had\r\nnever given in the subsequent part, I had that subsequent part copied\r\nfrom the book, and now enclose it, as it may on some occasion or other,\r\nperhaps, be useful in the treasury office. The other volume contained\r\nall his correspondences from March the 30th to August the 23d, 1777. I\r\nhad a list of the letters taken by their dates and addresses, which will\r\nenable you to form a general idea of the collection. On perusal of many\r\nof them, I thought it desirable that they should not come to the hands\r\nof the British minister, and from an expression dropped by the possessor\r\nof them, I believe he would have fallen to fifty or sixty guineas. I did\r\nnot think them important enough, however, to justify my purchasing\r\nthem without authority; though, with authority, I should have done it.\r\nIndeed, I would have given that sum to cut out a single sentence, which\r\ncontained evidence of a fact, not proper to be committed to the hands\r\nof enemies. I told him I would state his proposition to you, and await\r\norders. I gave him back the books, and he returned to London without\r\nmaking any promise, that he would await the event of the orders you\r\nmight think proper to give.\r\n\r\nNews of the accession of nine States to the new form of federal\r\ngovernment has been received here about a week. I have the honor to\r\ncongratulate you sincerely on this event. Of its effect at home, you\r\nare in the best situation to judge. On this side the Atlantic, it\r\nis considered as a very wise reformation. In consequence of this,\r\nspeculations are already begun here, to purchase up our domestic\r\nliquidated debt. Indeed, I suspect that orders may have been previously\r\nlodged in America to do this, as soon as the new constitution was\r\naccepted effectually. If it is thought that this debt should be retained\r\nat home, there is not a moment to lose; and I know of no means of\r\nretaining it, but those I suggested to the treasury board, in my letter\r\nto them of March the 29th. The transfer of these debts to Europe will\r\nexcessively embarrass, and perhaps totally prevent the borrowing any\r\nmoney in Europe, till these shall be paid off. This is a momentous\r\nobject, and, in my opinion, should receive instantaneous attention.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France, to the departure of my letter, will accompany\r\nit, and those of Leyden to the 22nd of July, at which time their\r\ndistribution in this country was prohibited. How long the prohibition\r\nmay continue, I cannot tell. As far as I can judge, it is the only paper\r\nin Europe worth reading. Since the suppression of the packet-boats, I\r\nhave never been able to find a safe conveyance for a letter to you, till\r\nthe present by Mrs. Barclay. Whenever a confidential person shall be\r\ngoing from hence to London, I shall send my letters for you to the\r\ncare of Mr. Trumbull, who will look out for safe conveyances. This will\r\nrender the epochs of my writing very irregular. There is a proposition\r\nunder consideration, for establishing packet-boats on a more economical\r\nplan, from Havre to Boston; but its success is uncertain, and still\r\nmore, its duration.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CL.--TO COLONEL MONROE, August 9, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my last to you, I have to thank your for your favors of July the\r\n27th, 1787, and April the 10th, 1788, and the details they contained;\r\nand in return, will give you now the leading circumstances of this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThis nation is at present under great internal agitation. The authority\r\nof the crown on one part, and that of the parliaments on the other, are\r\nfairly at issue. Good men take part with neither, but have raised an\r\nopposition, the object of which is to obtain a fixed and temperate\r\nconstitution. There was a moment when this opposition ran so high, as to\r\nendanger an appeal to arms, in which case, perhaps, it would have been\r\ncrushed. The moderation of government has avoided this, and they are\r\nyielding daily one right after another to the nation. They have given\r\nthem Provincial Assemblies, which will be very perfect representations\r\nof the nation, and stand somewhat in the place of our State Assemblies;\r\nthey have reformed the criminal law; acknowledged the King cannot lay a\r\nnew tax, without the consent of the States General; and they will call\r\nthe States General the next year. The object of this body, when met,\r\nwill be a bill of rights, a civil list, a national assembly meeting at\r\ncertain epochs, and some other matters of that kind. So that I think\r\nit probable this country will, within two or three years, be in the\r\nenjoyment of a tolerably free constitution, and that without its having\r\ncost them a drop of blood; for none has yet been spilt, though the\r\nEnglish papers have set the whole nation to cutting throats.\r\n\r\nBe assured of those sentiments of esteem and attachment, with which I\r\nam, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLI.--TO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-CŒUR, August 9, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-CŒUR.\r\n\r\nParis, August 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWhile our second revolution is just brought to a happy end with you,\r\nyours here is but cleverly under way. For some days I was really\r\nmelancholy with the apprehension, that arms would be appealed to, and\r\nthe opposition crushed in its first efforts. But things seem now to wear\r\na better aspect. While the opposition keeps at its highest wholesome\r\npoint, government, unwilling to draw the sword, is not forced to do it.\r\nThe contest here is exactly what it was in Holland: a contest between\r\nthe monarchical and aristocratical parts of the government for a\r\nmonopoly of despotism over the people. The aristocracy in Holland,\r\nseeing that their common prey was likely to escape out of their\r\nclutches, chose rather to retain its former portion, and therefore\r\ncoalesced with the single head. The people remained victims. Here,\r\nI think, it will take a happier turn. The parliamentary part of the\r\naristocracy is alone firmly united. The _Noblesse_ and Clergy, but\r\nespecially the former, are divided partly between the parliamentary and\r\nthe despotic party, and partly united with the real patriots, who\r\nare endeavoring to gain for the nation what they can, both from the\r\nparliamentary and the single despotism. I think I am not mistaken in\r\nbelieving, that the King and some of his ministers are well affected to\r\nthis band; and surely, that they will make great cessions to the\r\npeople, rather than small ones to the parliament. They are, accordingly,\r\nyielding daily to the national reclamations, and will probably end in\r\naccording a well-tempered constitution. They promise the States General\r\nfor the next year, and I have good information that an Arrêt will appear\r\nthe day after to-morrow, announcing them for May, 1789. How they will be\r\ncomposed, and what they will do, cannot be foreseen. Their convocation,\r\nhowever, will tranquillize the public mind, in a great degree, till\r\ntheir meeting. There are, however, two intervening difficulties. 1.\r\nJustice cannot till then continue completely suspended, as it now is.\r\nThe parliament will not resume their functions, but in their entire\r\nbody. The _bailliages_ are afraid to accept of them. What will be done?\r\n2. There are well-founded fears of a bankruptcy before the month of May.\r\nIn the mean time, the war is spreading from nation to nation. Sweden\r\nhas commenced hostilities against Russia; Denmark is showing its teeth\r\nagainst Sweden; Prussia against Denmark; and England too deeply engaged\r\nin playing the back game, to avoid coming forward, and dragging this\r\ncountry and Spain in with her. But even war will not prevent the\r\nassembly of the States General, because it cannot be carried on without\r\nthem. War, however, is not the most favorable moment for divesting the\r\nmonarchy of power. On the contrary, it is the moment when the energy of\r\na single hand shows itself in the most seducing form.\r\n\r\nA very considerable portion of this country has been desolated by a\r\nhail. I considered the newspaper accounts of hailstones of ten pounds\r\nweight as exaggerations. But in a conversation with the Duke de la\r\nRochefoucault the other day, he assured me, that though he could not\r\nsay he had seen such himself, yet he considered the fact as perfectly\r\nestablished. Great contributions, public and private, are making for the\r\nsufferers. But they will be like the drop of water from the finger of\r\nLazarus. There is no remedy for the present evil, nor way to prevent\r\nfuture ones, but to bring the people to such a state of ease, as not to\r\nbe ruined by the loss of a single crop. This hail may be considered as\r\nthe _coup de grace_ to an expiring victim. In the arts there is nothing\r\nnew discovered since you left us, which is worth communicating. Mr.\r\nPaine’s iron bridge was exhibited here with great approbation. An\r\nidea has been encouraged of executing it in three arches at the King’s\r\ngarden. But it will probably not be done.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of perfect esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLII.--TO JOHN JAY, August 10, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 10, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have waited till the last moment of Mrs. Barclay’s departure, to write\r\nyou the occurrences since my letter of the 3rd instant. We have received\r\nthe Swedish account of an engagement between their fleet and the\r\nRussian, on the Baltic, wherein they say they took one, and burned\r\nanother Russian vessel, with the loss of one on their side, and that the\r\nvictory remained with them. They say, at the same time, that their fleet\r\nreturned into port, and the Russians kept the sea; we must, therefore,\r\nsuspend our opinion till we get the Russian version of this engagement.\r\nThe Swedish manifesto was handed about to-day at Versailles, by the\r\nSwedish ambassador, in manuscript. The King complains that Russia has\r\nbeen ever endeavoring to sow divisions in his kingdom, in order to\r\nre-establish the ancient constitution; that he has long borne it,\r\nthrough a love of peace, but finds it no longer bearable: that still,\r\nhowever, he will make peace on these conditions; 1. That the Empress\r\npunishes her minister for the note he gave in to the court of Stockholm;\r\n2. that she restore Crimea to the Turks; and 3. that she repay to him\r\nall the expenses of his armament. The Russian force, in vessels of war\r\non the Black Sea, are five frigates, and three ships of the line; but\r\nthose of the line are shut up in port, and cannot come out till Oczakow\r\nshall be taken. This fleet is commanded by Paul Jones, with the rank of\r\nrear-admiral. The Prince of Nassau commands the galleys and gun-boats.\r\nIt is now ascertained, that the States General will assemble the next\r\nyear, and probably in the month of May. Tippoo Saib’s ambassadors had\r\ntheir reception to-day at Versailles with unusual pomp. The presence was\r\nso numerous, that little could be caught of what they said to the king,\r\nand he answered to them: from what little I could hear, nothing more\r\npassed than mutual assurances of good will. The name of the Marechal\r\nde Richelieu is sufficiently remarkable in history, to justify\r\nmy mentioning his death, which happened two days ago; he was aged\r\nninety-two years.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIII.--TO JOHN JAY, August 11, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the last night, written in the moment of Mrs. Barclay’s\r\ndeparture, I had the honor of mentioning to you, that it was now pretty\r\ncertain that the States General would be assembled in the next year,\r\nand probably in the month of May. This morning an _Arrêt_ is published,\r\nannouncing that their meeting is fixed on the first day of May next, of\r\nwhich I enclose you a copy by post, in hopes it will get to Bordeaux in\r\ntime for Mrs. Barclay. This _Arrêt_ ought to have a great effect towards\r\ntranquillizing the nation. There are still, however, two circumstances\r\nwhich must continue to perplex the administration. The first is, the\r\nwant of money, occasioned not only by the difficulty of filling up the\r\nloan of the next year, but by the withholding the ordinary supplies of\r\ntaxes, which is said to have taken place in some instances: this\r\ngives apprehension of a bankruptcy under some form or other, and has\r\noccasioned the stocks to fall, in the most alarming manner. The second\r\ncircumstance is, that justice, both civil and criminal, continues\r\nsuspended. The parliament will not resume their functions, but with\r\ntheir whole body, and the greater part of the _bailliages_ declined\r\nacting; the present _Arrêt_ announces a perseverance in this plan. I\r\nhave information from Algiers, of the 5th of June, that the plague is\r\nraging there, with great violence; that one of our captives was dead of\r\nit, and another ill, so that we have there, in all, now, only fifteen or\r\nsixteen; that the captives are more exposed to its ravages, than\r\nothers; that the great redemptions by the Spaniards, Portuguese, and\r\nNeapolitans, and the havoc made by the plague, had now left not more\r\nthan four hundred slaves in Algiers; so that their redemption was become\r\nnot only exorbitant, but almost inadmissible; that common sailors were\r\nheld at four hundred pounds sterling, and that our fifteen or sixteen\r\ncould probably not be redeemed for less than from twenty-five to thirty\r\nthousand dollars. An Algerine cruiser, having twenty-eight captives of\r\nGenoa aboard, was lately chased ashore, by two Neapolitan vessels: the\r\ncrew and captives got safe ashore, and the latter, of course, recovered\r\ntheir freedom. The Algerine crew was well treated, and would be sent\r\nback by the French. But the government of Algiers demands of France,\r\nsixty thousand sequins, or twenty-seven thousand pounds sterling, for\r\nthe captives escaped; that is, nearly one thousand pounds each. The\r\ngreater part of the regency were for an immediate declaration of war\r\nagainst France; but the Dey urged the heavy war the Turks were at\r\npresent engaged in; that it would be better not to draw another power\r\non them, at present; that they would decline renewing the treaty of\r\none hundred years, which expired two years ago, so as to be free to act\r\nhereafter; but, for the present, they ought to accept payment for the\r\ncaptives, as a satisfaction. They accordingly declared to the French\r\nconsul, that they would put him, and all his countrymen there, into\r\nirons, unless the sixty thousand sequins were paid: the consul told\r\nthem, his instructions were, positively, that they should not be paid.\r\nIn this situation stood matters between that pettifogging nest of\r\nrobbers and this great kingdom, which will finish, probably, by\r\ncrouching under them, and paying the sixty thousand sequins. From the\r\npersonal characters of the present administration, I should have hoped,\r\nunder any other situation than the present, they might have ventured to\r\nquit the beaten track of politics hitherto pursued, in which the honor\r\nof their nation has been calculated at nought, and to join in a league\r\nfor keeping up a perpetual cruise against these pirates, which, though a\r\nslow operation, would be a sure one for destroying all their vessels and\r\nseamen, and turning the rest of them to agriculture. But a desire of not\r\nbringing upon themselves another difficulty, will probably induce the\r\nministers to do as their predecessors have done.\r\n\r\nAugust 12. The enclosed paper of this morning gives some particulars\r\nof the action between the Russians and Swedes, the manifesto of the\r\nEmpress, and the declaration of the court of Versailles, as to the\r\naffair of Trincomale.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIV.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, August 12, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, August 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my last to you, I have been honored with yours of the 18th and\r\n29th of May, and 5th of June. My latest American intelligence is of the\r\n24th of June, when nine certainly, and probably ten States, had accepted\r\nthe new constitution, and there was no doubt of the eleventh (North\r\nCarolina), because there was no opposition there. In New York, two\r\nthirds of the State were against it, and certainly if they had been\r\ncalled to the decision, in any other stage of the business, they\r\nwould have rejected it; but before they put it to the vote, they would\r\ncertainly have heard that eleven States had joined in it, and they\r\nwould find it safer to go with those eleven, than put themselves into\r\nopposition, with Rhode Island only. Though I am much pleased with this\r\nsuccessful issue of the new constitution, yet I am more so, to find that\r\none of its principal defects (the want of a declaration of rights) will\r\npretty certainly be remedied. I suppose this, because I see that\r\nboth people and conventions, in almost every State, have concurred in\r\ndemanding it. Another defect, the perpetual re-eligibility of the\r\nsame President, will probably not be cured, during the life of General\r\nWashington. His merit has blinded our countrymen to the danger of making\r\nso important an officer re-eligible. I presume there will not be a vote\r\nagainst him, in the United States. It is more doubtful, who will be\r\nVice-President. The age of Dr. Franklin, and the doubt whether he would\r\naccept it, are the only circumstances that admit a question, but that he\r\nwould be the man. After these two characters of first magnitude, there\r\nare so many which present themselves equally, on the second line, that\r\nwe cannot see which of them will be singled out. John Adams, Hancock,\r\nJay, Madison, Rutledge, will be all voted for. Congress has acceded to\r\nthe prayer of Kentucky to become an independent member of the Union. A\r\ncommittee was occupied in settling the plan of receiving them, and their\r\ngovernment is to commence on the 1st day of January next.\r\n\r\nYou are, I dare say, pleased, as I am, with the promotion of our\r\ncountryman, Paul Jones. He commanded the right wing, in the first\r\nengagement between the Russian and Turkish galleys; his absence from\r\nthe second, proves his superiority over the Captain Pacha, as he did not\r\nchoose to bring his ships into the shoals in which the Pacha ventured,\r\nand lost those entrusted to him. I consider this officer as the\r\nprincipal hope of our future efforts on the ocean. You will have heard\r\nof the action between the Swedes and Russians, on the Baltic; as yet,\r\nwe have only the Swedish version of it. I apprehend this war must catch\r\nfrom nation to nation, till it becomes general.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the internal affairs of this country, I hope they will\r\nbe finally well arranged, and without having cost a drop of blood.\r\nLooking on as a by-stander, no otherwise interested, than as\r\nentertaining a sincere love for the nation in general, and a wish to see\r\ntheir happiness promoted, keeping myself clear of the particular\r\nviews and passions of individuals, I applaud extremely the patriotic\r\nproceedings of the present ministry. Provincial Assemblies established,\r\nthe States General called, the right of taxing the nation without their\r\nconsent abandoned, _corvées_ abolished, torture abolished, the\r\ncriminal code reformed, are facts which will do eternal honor to their\r\nadministration, in history. But were I their historian, I should not\r\nequally applaud their total abandonment of their foreign affairs. A\r\nbolder front in the beginning, would have prevented the first loss, and\r\nconsequently, all the others. Holland, Prussia, Turkey, and Sweden, lost\r\nwithout the acquisition of a single new ally, are painful reflections\r\nfor the friends of France. They may, indeed, have in their places the\r\ntwo empires, and perhaps Denmark; in which case, physically speaking,\r\nthey will stand on as good ground as before, but not on as good moral\r\nground. Perhaps, seeing more of the internal working of the machine,\r\nthey saw, more than we do, the physical impossibility of having money\r\nto carry on a war. Their justification must depend on this, and their\r\natonement, on the internal good they are doing to their country; this\r\nmakes me completely their friend.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, you friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLV.--TO M. CATHALAN, August 13,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. CATHALAN.\r\n\r\nParis, August 13,1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors, of June, and\r\nJuly the 11th, and to thank you for the political intelligence they\r\ncontained, which is always interesting to me. I will ask a continuance\r\nof them, and especially that you inform me, from time to time, of the\r\nmovements in the ports of Marseilles and Toulon, which may seem to\r\nindicate peace or war. These are the most certain presages possible; and\r\nbeing conveyed to me from all the ports, they will always enable me to\r\njudge of the intentions or expectations of the ministry, and to notify\r\nyou of the result of the intelligence from all the ports, that you may\r\ncommunicate it to the American commerce.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you, that the new constitution proposed to\r\nthe United States, has been established by the votes of nine States.\r\nIt is happy for us to get this operation over before the war kindled in\r\nEurope could affect us, as by rendering us more respectable, we shall be\r\nmore probably permitted, by all parties, to remain neutral.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of putting under your cover a letter for Mr. Bernard,\r\ncontaining some seeds, and another to Giuseppe Chiappe, our consul\r\nat Mogadore. I thank you for your settlement of the price of the\r\n_Observations Météorologiques_, and I have repaid the sixty livres to\r\nSir John Lambert, in your name. When the nursery man, whom you have been\r\nso good as to employ to prepare the olives and olive plants, to be sent\r\nto Charleston, shall be executing that commission, I shall be glad if\r\nhe will, at the same time, prepare a few plants only, of the following\r\nkinds. Figs, the best kind for drying, and the best kind for eating\r\nfresh, raisins, the best kind for drying, prugnolles, cork trees,\r\npistaches, capers. I desire only a few plants of each of these, that\r\nthey may not take too much of the place of the olives, which is our\r\ngreat object, and the sole one we have at heart. If you will be so good\r\nas to give the nursery man this order immediately, it will save you the\r\nnecessity of recurring to my letter, when the season comes.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVI.--TO JOHN JAY, August 20,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 20,1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor to write to you on the 3rd, 10th, and 11th instant, with\r\na postscript of the 12th; all of which went by Mrs. Barclay. Since that\r\ndate, we have received an account of a third victory obtained by the\r\nRussians over the Turks, on the Black Sea, in which the Prince of\r\nNassau, with his galleys, destroyed two frigates, three smaller vessels,\r\nand six galleys. The Turkish power on that sea is represented, by their\r\nenemies, as now annihilated. There is reason to believe, however, that\r\nthis is not literally true, and that aided by the supplies furnished by\r\nthe English, they are making extraordinary efforts to re-establish\r\ntheir marine. The Russian minister here has shown the official report of\r\nAdmiral Greigh, on the combat of July the 17th, in which he claims the\r\nvictory, and urges in proof of it, that he kept the field of battle.\r\nThis report is said to have been written on it. As this paper, together\r\nwith the report of the Swedish admiral, is printed in the Leyden gazette\r\nof the 15th instant, I enclose it to you. The court of Denmark has\r\ndeclared, it will furnish Russia the aid stipulated in their treaty: and\r\nit is not doubted they will go beyond this, and become principals in the\r\nwar. The next probable moves are, that the King of Prussia will succor\r\nSweden; and Poland, Russia, by land: and a possible consequence is, that\r\nEngland may send a squadron into the Baltic, to restore equilibrium in\r\nthat sea. In my letter of the 11th, I observed to you, that this country\r\nwould have two difficulties to struggle with, till the meeting of their\r\nStates General, and that one of these was the want of money: this has,\r\nin fact, overborne all their resources, and the day before yesterday,\r\nthey published an _Arrêt_, suspending all reimbursements of capital, and\r\nreducing the payments of the principal mass of demands for interest,\r\nto twelve sous in the livre; the remaining eight sous to be paid with\r\ncertificates. I enclose you a newspaper with the _Arrêt_. In this paper\r\nyou will see the exchange of yesterday, and I have inserted that of\r\nthe day before, to show you the fall. The consternation is, as yet, too\r\ngreat to let us judge of the issue. It will probably ripen the public\r\nmind to the necessity of a change in their constitution, and to the\r\nsubstituting the collected wisdom of the whole, in place of a single\r\nwill, by which they have been hitherto governed. It is a remarkable\r\nproof of the total incompetency of a single head to govern a nation\r\nwell, when, with a revenue of six hundred millions, they are led to a\r\ndeclared bankruptcy, and to stop the wheels of government, even in its\r\nmost essential movements, for want of money.\r\n\r\nI send the present letter by a private conveyance to a sea-port, in\r\nhopes a conveyance may be found by some merchant vessel.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVII.--TO MR. CUTTING, August 23, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\nParis, August 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favors of the 3rd, 8th, 14th, and 15th\r\ninstant, and have now the honor of enclosing you a letter of\r\nintroduction to Doctor Ramsay.\r\n\r\nI think a certainty that England and France must enter into the war, was\r\na great inducement to the ministry here to suspend the portion of public\r\npayments, which they have lately suspended. By this operation, they\r\nsecure two hundred and three millions of livres, or eight millions and a\r\nhalf of guineas, in the course of this and the ensuing year, which\r\nwill be sufficient for the campaign of the first year: for what is to,\r\nfollow, the States General must provide. The interesting question now\r\nis, how the States General shall be composed? There are three opinions.\r\n1. To place the three estates, Clergy, _Noblesse_, and Commons, in three\r\ndifferent Houses. The Clergy would, probably, like this, and some of\r\nthe Nobility; but it has no partisans out of those orders. 2. To put the\r\nClergy and _Noblesse_ into one House, and the Commons into another. The\r\n_Noblesse_ will be generally for this. 3. To put the three orders\r\ninto one House, and make the Commons the majority of that House. This\r\nre-unites the greatest number of partisans, and I suspect it is well\r\npatronized in the ministry, who, I am persuaded, are proceeding\r\n_bona fide_, to improve the constitution of their country. As to the\r\nopposition which the English expect from the personal character of the\r\nKing, it proves they do not know what his personal character is. He is\r\nthe honestest man in his kingdom, and the most regular and economical.\r\nHe has no foible which will enlist him against the good of his people;\r\nand whatever constitution will promote this, he will befriend. But he\r\nwill not befriend it obstinately: he has given repeated proofs of a\r\nreadiness to sacrifice his opinion to the wish of the nation. I believe\r\nhe will consider the opinion of the States General, as the best evidence\r\nof what will please and profit the nation, and will conform to it. All\r\nthe characters at court may not be of this disposition, and from thence\r\nmay, possibly, arise representations, capable of leading the King\r\nastray; but upon a full view of all circumstances, I have sanguine\r\nhopes, that such a constitution will be established here, as will\r\nregenerate the energy of the nation, cover its friends, and make its\r\nenemies tremble. I am, with very great esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVIII.--TO JOHN JAY, September 3, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. Barclay I had the honor of sending you letters of the 3rd, 10th,\r\nand 11th of August; since which, I wrote you of the 20th of the same\r\nmonth, by a casual conveyance, as is the present.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 20th, I informed you of the act of public bankruptcy\r\nwhich had taken place here. The effect of this would have been a forced\r\nloan of about one hundred and eighty millions of livres, in the course\r\nof the present and ensuing year. But it did not yield a sufficient\r\nimmediate relief. The treasury became literally moneyless, and all\r\npurposes depending on this mover came to a stand. The Archbishop was\r\nhereupon removed, with Monsieur Lambert, the Comptroller General; and\r\nMr. Necker was called in, as Director General of the finance. To soften\r\nthe Archbishop’s dismission, a cardinal’s hat is asked for him from\r\nRome, and his nephew promised the succession to the Archbishopric of\r\nSens. The public joy, on this change of administration, was very great\r\nindeed. The people of Paris were amusing themselves with trying and\r\nburning the Archbishop in effigy, and rejoicing on the appointment\r\nof Mr. Necker. The commanding officer of the city-guards undertook\r\nto forbid this, and not being obeyed, he charged the mob with fixed\r\nbayonets, killed two or three, and wounded many: this stopped their\r\nrejoicings for that day; but enraged at being thus obstructed in\r\namusements wherein they had committed no disorder whatever, they\r\ncollected in great numbers the next day, attacked the guards in various\r\nplaces, burnt ten or twelve guard-houses, killed two or three of the\r\nguards, and had about six or eight of their own number killed. The\r\ncity was hereupon put under martial law, and after a while, the tumult\r\nsubsided, and peace was restored. The public stocks rose ten per cent,\r\non the day of Mr. Necker’s appointment: he was immediately offered\r\nconsiderable sums of money, and has been able so far to wave the benefit\r\nof the act of bankruptcy, as to pay in cash all demands, except the\r\n_remboursements des capitaux_. For these, and for a sure supply of\r\nother wants, he will depend on the States General, and will hasten their\r\nmeetings, as is thought. No other change has yet taken place in the\r\nadministration. The minister of war, however, must certainly follow his\r\nbrother, and some think, and all wish, that Monsieur de Lamoignon, the\r\n_Garde des Sceaux_, may go out also. The administration of justice is\r\nstill suspended. The whole kingdom seems tranquil at this moment.\r\n\r\nAbroad, no event worth noting has taken place since my last. The court\r\nof Denmark has not declared it will do any thing more, than furnish the\r\nstipulated aid to Russia. The King of Prussia has as yet made no move,\r\nwhich may decide whether he will engage in the war, nor has England sent\r\nany squadron into the Baltic. As the season for action is considerably\r\npassed over, it is become more doubtful, whether any other power will\r\nenter the lists till the next campaign; this will give time for stopping\r\nthe further progress of the war, if they really wish to stop it. Two\r\ncamps of twenty-five thousand men each are forming in this country on\r\nits northern limits. The Prince of Conde has the command of one, and the\r\nDuke de Broglio of the other.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with the enclosed letter from a Henry Watson, claiming\r\nprize monies, as having served under Admiral Paul Jones, which I suppose\r\nshould go to the treasury, or war-office.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble; servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIX.--TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY, Sep. 6, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nYour favor of July the 3rd came to hand some days ago, and that of July\r\nthe 22nd in the afternoon of yesterday. Knowing that a Mr. Vannet was to\r\nleave Paris this morning to go to Virginia in a vessel bound from Havre\r\nto Potomac, I have engaged him to receive the papers which are the\r\nsubject of those letters, to take care of them from thence to Havre,\r\nand on the voyage; and when he shall have arrived in Potomac, instead\r\nof going directly to Richmond, as he intended, he will proceed with them\r\nhimself to New York. I shall pay here all expenses to their delivery at\r\nthe ship’s side in America, freight included: unless, perhaps, he may\r\nfind it necessary to put another covering over them, if he should not\r\nbe able to get them into the cabin; in this case, you will have to\r\nreimburse him for that. I engage to him that you shall pay him their\r\ntransportation from the ship’s side to New York, and his own reasonable\r\nexpenses from the place of his landing to New York, and back to the\r\nplace of landing. As he takes that journey for this object only, it\r\nwould be reasonable that you give him some gratuity for his time and\r\ntrouble, and I suppose it would be accepted by him; but I have made no\r\nagreement for this. The papers are contained in a large box and a trunk.\r\nThey were sent here by Mr. Ast, during my absence in Holland. When they\r\narrived at the gates of Paris, the officers of the customs opened the\r\ntrunk, to see whether it contained dutiable articles; but finding only\r\nbooks and papers, they concluded the contents of the box to be of the\r\nsame nature, and did not open that. You receive it, therefore, as it\r\ncame from the hands of Mr. Ast. A small trunk, which came as a third\r\npackage from Mr. Ast, and which has never been opened, I have put into\r\nthe great trunk, without displacing, or ever having touched a single\r\npaper, except as far as was necessary to make room for that. I shall\r\nhave the whole corded and plumbed by the Custom-house here, not only to\r\nprevent their being opened at the Custom-houses on the road, and at the\r\nport of exportation, but to prove to you, whether they shall have been\r\nopened by any body else after going out of my hands. If the stamped\r\nleads are entire, and the cords uncut, when you receive them, you will\r\nbe sure they have not been opened; they will be wrapt in oil-cloth here\r\nto guard them against the damps of the sea; and, as I mentioned\r\nbefore, Mr. Vannet will put them under another covering, if he finds it\r\nnecessary, at Havre.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with your last letter, I received from the office of\r\nForeign Affairs the ratification by Congress of the loan of 1788, for\r\nanother million of guilders. As the necessity of this loan resulted\r\nfrom the estimate made by Mr. Adams and myself, which estimate was laid\r\nbefore Congress, I suppose their ratification of the loan implies that\r\nof the estimate. One article of this was for the redemption of our\r\ncaptives at Algiers. Though your letter says nothing on this subject,\r\nI am in hopes you have sent orders to the commissioners of the loans\r\nat Amsterdam to furnish, as soon as they shall have it, what may be\r\nnecessary for this pressing call. So also for the foreign officers. If\r\nthe ratification of the loan has been made by Congress, with a view\r\nto fulfil the objects of the estimate, a general order from you to the\r\ncommissioners of the loans at Amsterdam, to pay the monies from time to\r\ntime, according to that estimate, or to such other as you shall furnish\r\nthem with, might save the trouble of particular orders on every single\r\noccasion, and the disappointments arising from the delay or miscarriage\r\nof such orders: but it is for you to decide on this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLX.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nParis, September 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last war, the house of Schweighaeuser and Dobree of\r\nNantes, and Puchilberg of L’Orient, presented to Dr. Franklin a demand\r\nagainst the United States of America. He, being acquainted with the\r\ncircumstances of the demand, and knowing it to be unfounded, refused\r\nto pay it. They thereupon procured seizure, by judiciary authority, of\r\ncertain arms and other military stores which we had purchased in this\r\ncountry, and had deposited for embarkation at Nantes: and these\r\nstores have remained in that position ever since. Congress have lately\r\ninstructed me to put an end to this matter. Unwilling to trouble your\r\nExcellency, whenever it can be avoided, I proposed to the parties to\r\nhave the question decided by arbitrators, to be chosen by us jointly.\r\nThey have refused it, as you will see by their answers to my letters,\r\ncopies of both which I have the honor to enclose you. I presume it to\r\nbe well settled in practice, that the property of one sovereign is not\r\npermitted to be seized within the dominions of another; and that this\r\npractice is founded not only in mutual respect, but in mutual utility.\r\nTo what the contrary practice would lead, is evident in the present\r\ncase, wherein military stores have been stopped, in the course of a war,\r\nin which our greatest difficulties proceeded from the want of military\r\nstores. In their letter, too, they make a merit of not having seized\r\none of our ships of war, and certainly the principle which admits the\r\nseizure of arms, would admit that of a whole fleet, and would often\r\nfurnish an enemy the easiest means of defeating an expedition. The\r\nparties obliging me, then, to have recourse to your Excellency on this\r\noccasion, I am under the necessity of asking an order from you for the\r\nimmediate delivery of the stores and other property of the United States\r\nat Nantes, detained by the house of Schweighaeuser and Dobree, and that\r\nof Puchilberg, or by either of them, under a pretence of a judicial\r\nseizure.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXI.--TO M. DE REYNEVAL, September 16, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, September 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nI have the honor now to enclose you my observations on the alteration\r\nproposed in the consular convention. There remain only three articles of\r\nthose heretofore in question between us, to which I am unable to\r\nagree; that is to say, the second, proposing still to retain personal\r\nimmunities for the consuls, and others attached to their office; the\r\neighth, proposing that the navigation code of each nation shall be\r\nestablished in the territories of the other; and the ninth, insisting\r\nthat the ship’s roll shall be conclusive evidence that a person belongs\r\nto the ship.\r\n\r\nThere are several new matters introduced into the draught: some of these\r\nare agreed to; others cannot be admitted, as being contrary to the\r\nsame principles which had obliged me to disagree to some of the former\r\narticles. The greatest part of the eleventh, and the whole of the\r\ntwelfth new articles, are in this predicament. They propose, that no\r\nperson shall be arrested on board a merchant vessel, for any cause, but\r\nin presence of the consul; that no such vessel shall be visited, but\r\nin his presence; and that when the officers of justice have reason to\r\nbelieve that a criminal has taken refuge on board a vessel of war, the\r\ncaptain’s word shall be conclusive evidence that he is not there.\r\n\r\nTo the objections which I had the honor of stating in my letter to his\r\nExcellency, the Count de Montmorin, I have now that of adding some other\r\nobservations, of which I request your perusal. I enclose with them a\r\ndraught, on the basis of the one you were pleased to give me, altered so\r\nas to reconcile it to the spirit of our laws.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXII.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA ROUERIE, September 16,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA ROUERIE.\r\n\r\nParis, September 16,1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nOn receiving the first letters which you did me the honor to write to me\r\non the arrears due to you from the United States, I informed you that\r\nI had nothing to do in the money department; that the subject of your\r\nletters belonged altogether to the treasury board, and to Mr. Grand,\r\ntheir banker here, to the former of whom I forwarded your letters. As\r\nI felt an anxiety, however, that the foreign officers should be paid, I\r\ntook the liberty of pressing the treasury board, from time to time, to\r\nexert themselves for that effect; and I availed myself of an opportunity\r\nwhich occurred last spring, of setting on foot measures, which, with\r\ntheir approbation, might furnish the means of effecting this payment.\r\nSo far my information to you went, and I added a supposition, that the\r\ntreasury board would probably give orders on the subject, in the course\r\nof the month of July. But I made you no promise; it would have been\r\nstrange if I had; nor does my office, nor any thing I have ever said\r\nor done, subject me to the demand of immediate payment, which you are\r\npleased to make on me, nor call on me for any declaration or answer,\r\npositive or negative.\r\n\r\nFinding that my interference, which was friendly only, and avowed to be\r\ninofficial, has given occasion to your letter of yesterday, in a style\r\nwhich I did not expect, and to which I can have no motive for\r\nfurther exposing myself, I must take the liberty of desiring that the\r\ncorrespondence between us on this subject may cease. I presume that the\r\ncertificate given you points out the person, here or elsewhere, to whom\r\nyour applications are to be made, and that he will inform you when he\r\nreceives orders on your subject.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIII.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, September 20, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nParis, September 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe evening of your departure, a letter came by the way of London and\r\nNew York, addressed to you, and probably from Virginia. I think you\r\nwished your American letters to remain here; I shall therefore keep it.\r\nThe passport now enclosed came the day after your departure; so also\r\ndid a mass of American letters for me, as low down as August the 10th.\r\nI shall give you their substance. The convention of Virginia annexed\r\nto their ratification of the new constitution a copy of the State\r\ndeclaration of rights, not by way of condition, but to announce\r\ntheir attachment to them. They added also propositions for specific\r\nalterations of the constitution. Among these was one for rendering the\r\nPresident incapable of serving more than eight years, in any term of\r\nsixteen. New York has followed the example of Virginia, expressing the\r\nsubstance of her bill of rights (that is, Virginia’s), and proposing\r\namendments: these last differ much from those of Virginia; but they\r\nconcur as to the President, only proposing that he shall be incapable\r\nof being elected more than twice. But I own I should like better than\r\neither of these, what Luther Martin tells us was repeatedly voted and\r\nadhered to by the federal convention, and only altered about twelve days\r\nbefore their rising, when some members had gone off; to wit, that he\r\nshould be elected for seven years, and incapable for ever after. But New\r\nYork has taken another step, which gives uneasiness; she has written a\r\ncircular letter to all the legislatures, asking their concurrence in\r\nan immediate convention for making amendments. No news yet from North\r\nCarolina. Electors are to be chosen the first Wednesday in January;\r\nthe President to be elected the first Wednesday in February; the new\r\nlegislature to meet the third week in March:--the place is not yet\r\ndecided on. Philadelphia was first proposed, and had six and a half\r\nvotes; the half vote was Delaware, one of whose members wanted to take\r\na vote on Wilmington; then Baltimore was proposed and carried, and\r\nafterwards rescinded: so that the matter stood open as ever on the 10th\r\nof August; but it was allowed the dispute lay only between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, and rather thought in favor of the last. The Rhode Island\r\nDelegates had retired from Congress. Dr. Franklin was dangerously ill\r\nof the gout and stone on the 21st of July. My letters of August the 10th\r\nnot mentioning him, I hope he was recovered. Warville, &c. were arrived.\r\nCongress had referred the decision, as to the independence of Kentucky,\r\nto the new government. Brown ascribes this to the jealousy of the\r\nnorthern States, who want Vermont to be received at the same time,\r\nin order to preserve a balance of interests in Congress. He was just\r\nsetting out for Kentucky, disgusted, yet disposed to persuade to an\r\nacquiescence, though doubting they would immediately separate from the\r\nUnion. The principal obstacle to this, he thought, would be the Indian\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe following is a quotation from a letter from Virginia, dated July the\r\n12th. ‘P------n, though much impaired in health, and in every respect in\r\nthe decline of life, showed as much zeal to carry the new constitution,\r\nas if he had been a young man; perhaps more than he discovered in the\r\ncommencement of the late revolution,in his opposition to Great Britain.\r\nW------e acted as chairman to the committee of the whole, and of course\r\ntook but little part in the debate; but was for the adoption, relying\r\non subsequent amendments. B------r said nothing, but was for it. The\r\nG------r exhibited a curious spectacle to view. Having refused to sign\r\nthe paper, every body supposed him against it; but he afterwards had\r\nwritten a letter, and having taken a part, which might be called rather\r\nvehement than active, he was constantly laboring to show, that his\r\npresent conduct was consistent with that letter, and that letter with\r\nhis refusal to sign. M--d--n took the principal share in the debate for\r\nit; in which, together with the aid I have already mentioned, he was\r\nsomewhat assisted by I--nn--s, Lee, M------l, C------n, and G. N------s.\r\nM--s--n, H------y, and Gr------n were the principal supporters of the\r\nopposition. The discussion, as might be expected, where the parties\r\nwere so nearly on a balance, was conducted generally with great order,\r\npropriety, and respect of either party to the other.’\r\n\r\nThe assembly of Virginia, hurried to their harvests, would not enter\r\ninto a discussion of the district bill, but suspended it to the next\r\nsession. E. Winston is appointed a judge, vice Gabriel Jones, resigned.\r\nR. Goode and Andrew Moore, Counsellors, vice B. Starke, dead, and Joseph\r\nEgglestone, resigned. It is said Wilson, of Philadelphia, is talked of\r\nto succeed Mr. A. in London. _Quære?_\r\n\r\nThe dispute about Virgil’s tomb and the laurel, seems to be at length\r\nsettled, by the testimony of two travellers, given separately, and\r\nwithout a communication with each other. These both say, that attempting\r\nto pluck off a branch of the laurel, it followed their hand, being, in\r\nfact, nothing more than a plant or bough recently cut, and stuck in the\r\nground for the occasion. The Cicerone acknowledged the roguery, and said\r\nthey practised it with almost every traveller, to get money. You will,\r\nof course, tug well at the laurel which shall be shown you, to see if\r\nthis be the true solution.\r\n\r\nThe President Dupaty is dead. Monsieur de Barentin, _prémier president\r\nde la cour des aides_, is appointed _Garde des Sceaux_. The stocks are\r\nrather lower than when you left this. Present me in the most friendly\r\nterms to Messrs. Shippen and Rutledge. I rely on your communicating to\r\nthem the news, and, therefore, on their pardoning me for not repeating\r\nit in separate letters to them. You can satisfy them how necessary this\r\neconomy of my time and labor is. This goes to Geneva _poste restante_. I\r\nshall not write again till you tell me where to write to.\r\n\r\nAccept very sincere assurances of the affection, with which I am, Dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh; Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIV.--TO JOHN JAY, September 24,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, September 24,1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that the vessel is not yet sailed from Havre, which is\r\nto carry my letters of the 3rd and 5th instant, I am in hopes you will\r\nreceive the present with them. The Russian accounts of their victories\r\non the Black Sea must have been greatly exaggerated. According to these,\r\nthe Captain Pacha’s fleet was annihilated; yet themselves have lately\r\nbrought him on the stage again, with fifteen ships of the line, in order\r\nto obtain another victory over him. I believe the truth to be, that he\r\nhas suffered some checks, of what magnitude it is impossible to say,\r\nwhere one side alone is heard, and that he is still master of that sea.\r\nHe has relieved Oczakow, which still holds out; Choczim also is still\r\nuntaken, and the Emperor’s situation is apprehended to be bad. He spun\r\nhis army into a long cord, to cover several hundred miles of frontier,\r\nwhich put it in the power of the Turks to attack with their whole force\r\nwherever they pleased. Laudon, now called to head the imperial army, is\r\nendeavoring to collect it; but in the mean time the campaign is drawing\r\nto a close, and has been worse than fruitless. The resistance of Russia\r\nto Sweden has been successful in every point by sea and land, This, with\r\nthe interference of Denmark, and the discontent of the Swedish nation;\r\nat the breach of their constitution, by the King’s undertaking an\r\noffensive war without the consent of the Senate, has obliged him to\r\nwithdraw his attacks by land, and to express a willingness for peace;\r\none third of his officers have refused to serve. England and Prussia\r\nhave offered their mediation between Sweden and Russia, in such\r\nequivocal terms, as to leave themselves at liberty to say it was an\r\noffer, or was not, just as it shall suit them. Denmark is asking the\r\ncounter-offer of mediation from this court. If England and Prussia make\r\na peace effectually in the north (which it is absolutely in their power\r\nto do), it will be a proof they do not intend to enter into the war;\r\nif they do not impose a peace, I should suspect they mean to engage\r\nthemselves; as one can hardly suppose they would let the war go on in\r\nits present form, wherein Sweden must be crushed between Russia and\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nThe _Garde des Sceaux_, M. de Lamoignon, was dismissed the 14th instant,\r\nand M. de Barentin is appointed in his room. The deputies of Bretagne\r\nare released from the Bastile, and M. d’Epermesnil and M. Sabatier\r\nrecalled from their confinement. The parliament is not yet reinstated;\r\nbut it is confidently said it will be this week. The stocks continue\r\nlow, and the treasury under a hard struggle to keep the government in\r\nmotion. It is believed the meeting of the States General will be as\r\nearly as January, perhaps December. I have received a duplicate of the\r\nratification of the loan of 1788, by Congress, and a duplicate of a\r\nletter of July the 22nd, from the treasury board, on another subject,\r\nbut none on that of the captives, or foreign officers. I suppose\r\nsome cause of delay must have intervened between the ratification of\r\nCongress, and the consequent orders of the treasury board.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant;\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXV.--TO M. DE REYNEVAL, October 1, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\nParis, October 1, 1788\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have now the honor of enclosing to you a copy of the letter of\r\nSeptember the 16th, which I had that of writing to his Excellency\r\nthe Count de Montmorin, with the papers therein referred to, and of\r\nsoliciting the order I have asked for. The originals were sent at the\r\ndate before mentioned. Notwithstanding the refusal of the houses of\r\nSchweighaeuser and Dobree, and of Puchilberg, to settle their claim\r\nagainst the United States by arbitration, as I proposed to them, the\r\nUnited States will still be ready to do them justice. But those houses\r\nmust first retire from the only two propositions they have ever made;\r\nto wit, either a payment of their demand without discussion, or a\r\ndiscussion before the tribunals of the country. In the mean time, I\r\nshall hope an acknowledgment with respect to us, of the principle which\r\nholds as to other nations; that our public property here cannot be\r\nseized by the territorial judge. It is the more interesting to us, as\r\nwe shall be more and longer exposed than other nations, to draw arms\r\nand military stores from Europe. Our preference of this country has\r\noccasioned us to draw them from hence alone, since the peace: and the\r\nfriendship we have constantly experienced from the government, will, we\r\ndoubt not, on this and every other occasion, insure to us the protection\r\nof what we purchase. I have the honor to be, Sir, your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVI.--TO MR. CUTTING, October 2, 1788\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\nParis, October 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 16th and\r\n23rd ultimo and to thank you for the intelligence they conveyed. That\r\nrespecting the case of the interrogatories in Pennsylvania, ought\r\nto make noise. So evident a heresy in the common law ought not to be\r\ntolerated on the authority of two or three civilians, who happened,\r\nunfortunately, to make authority in the courts of England. I hold it\r\nessential, in America, to forbid that any English decision which has\r\nhappened since the accession of Lord Mansfield to the bench, should ever\r\nbe cited in a court: because, though there have come many good ones\r\nfrom him, yet there is so much sly poison instilled into a great part of\r\nthem, that it is better to proscribe the whole. Can you inform me what\r\nhas been done by England on the subject of our wheat and flour?\r\nThe papers say it is prohibited, even in Hanover. How do their\r\nwhale-fisheries turn out, this year? I hope a deep wound will be given\r\nthem in that article soon, and such as will leave us in no danger from\r\ntheir competition.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am, with very great esteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient, humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVII.--TO JOHN JAY, November 14, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, November 14, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of December the 21st, 1787, I had the honor of\r\nacknowledging the receipts of your two favors of July the 27th, 1787,\r\nwhich had come to my hands December the 19th, and brought with them\r\nmy full powers for treating on the subject of the consular convention.\r\nBeing then much engaged in getting forward the _Arrêt_ which came out\r\nthe 29th of December, and willing to leave some interval between\r\nthat act, and the solicitation of a reconsideration of our consular\r\nconvention, I had declined mentioning it, for some time, and was just\r\nabout to bring it on the carpet, when it became necessary for me to go\r\nto Amsterdam. Immediately after my return, which was about the last\r\nof April, I introduced the subject to the Count de Montmorin, and have\r\nfollowed it unremittingly, from that time. The office of Marine, as well\r\nas that of Foreign Affairs, being to be consulted in all the stages of\r\nthe negotiation, has protracted its conclusions till this time: it is\r\nat length signed this day, and I have now the honor to enclose the\r\noriginal, for the ratification of Congress. The principal changes\r\neffected are the following:\r\n\r\nThe clauses of the Convention of 1784, clothing consuls with privileges\r\nof the law of nations, are struck out, and they are expressly subjected,\r\nin their persons and property, to the laws of the land.\r\n\r\nThat giving the right of sanctuary to their houses, is reduced to a\r\nprotection of their chancery room and its papers.\r\n\r\nTheir coercive powers over passengers are taken away; and over those,\r\nwhom they might have termed deserters of their nation, are restrained to\r\ndeserted seamen only.\r\n\r\nThe clause, allowing them to arrest and send back vessels, is struck\r\nout, and instead of it, they are allowed to exercise a police over the\r\nships of their nation generally.\r\n\r\nSo is that, which declared the indelibility of the character of subject,\r\nand the explanation and extension of the eleventh article of the treaty\r\nof amity.\r\n\r\nThe innovations in the laws of evidence are done away: and the\r\nconvention is limited to twelve years’ duration. Convinced that the fewer\r\nexamples, the better, of either persons or causes unamenable to the laws\r\nof the land, I could have wished, still more had been done; but more\r\ncould not be done, with good humor. The extensions of authority given\r\nby the convention of 1784, were so homogeneous with the spirit of this\r\ngovernment, that they were prized here. Monsieur de Reyneval has had the\r\nprincipal charge of arranging this instrument with me; and, in justice\r\nto him, I must say, I could not have desired more reasonable and\r\nfriendly dispositions, than he demonstrated through the whole of it.\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith the several schemes successively proposed between us,\r\ntogether with the copies of the written observations given in with them,\r\nand which served as texts of discussion, in our personal conferences.\r\nThey may serve as a commentary on any passage which may need it, either\r\nnow or hereafter, and as a history how any particular passage comes to\r\nstand as it does. No. 1. is the convention of 1784. No. 2. is my first\r\nscheme. No. 3. theirs in answer to it. No. 4. my next, which brought us\r\nso near together, that, in a conference on that, we arranged it in the\r\nform in which it has been signed. I add No. 5. the copy of a translation\r\nwhich I have put into their hands, with a request, that if they find any\r\npassages in which the sense of the original is not faithfully rendered,\r\nthey will point them out to me; otherwise, we may consider it as having\r\ntheir approbation. This, and the convention of 1784, (marked No. 1.) are\r\nplaced side by side, so as to present to the eye, with less trouble, the\r\nchanges made; and I enclose a number of printed copies of them, for the\r\nuse of the members, who will have to decide on the ratification. It is\r\ndesirable that the ratification should be sent here for exchange, as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the consular appointments, it is a duty on me to add\r\nsome observations, which my situation here has enabled me to make.\r\nI think it was in the spring of 1784, that Congress (harassed by\r\nmultiplied applications from foreigners, of whom nothing was known but\r\non their own information, or on that of others as unknown as themselves)\r\ncame to a resolution, that the interest of America would not permit the\r\nnaming any person not a citizen, to the office of consul, vice-consul,\r\nagent, or commissary. This was intended as a general answer to that\r\nswarm of foreign pretenders. It appears to me, that it will be best,\r\nstill to preserve a part of this regulation. Native citizens, on several\r\nvaluable accounts, are preferable to aliens, and to citizens alien-born.\r\nThey possess our language, know our laws, customs, and commerce; have,\r\ngenerally, acquaintance in the United States; give better satisfaction;\r\nand are more to be relied on, in point of fidelity. Their disadvantages\r\nare, an imperfect acquaintance with the language of this country, and an\r\nignorance of the organization of its judicial and executive powers,\r\nand consequent awkwardness, whenever application to either of these\r\nis necessary, as it frequently is. But it happens, that in some of\r\nthe principal ports of France, there is not a single American (as in\r\nMarseilles, L’Orient, and Havre), in others but one (as in Nantes and\r\nRouen), and in Bordeaux only, are there two or three. Fortunately for\r\nthe present moment, most of these are worthy of appointments. But we\r\nshould look forward to future times, when there may happen to be no\r\nnative citizens in a port, but such as, being bankrupt, have taken\r\nasylum in France from their creditors, or young ephemeral adventurers\r\nin commerce, without substance or conduct, or other descriptions, which\r\nmight disgrace the consular office, without protecting our commerce. To\r\navail ourselves of our good native citizens, when we have one in a\r\nport, and when there are none, to have yet some person to attend to our\r\naffairs, it appears to me advisable to declare, by a standing law, that\r\nno person but a native citizen shall be capable of the office of consul,\r\nand that the consul’s presence in his port should suspend, for the time,\r\nthe functions of the vice-consul. This is the rule of 1784, restrained\r\nto the office of consul, and to native citizens. The establishing\r\nthis, by a standing law, will guard against the effect of particular\r\napplications, and will shut the door against such applications, which\r\nwill otherwise be numerous. This done, the office of vice-consul may\r\nbe given to the best subject in the port, whether citizen or alien,\r\nand that of consul, be kept open for any native citizen of superior\r\nqualifications, who might come afterwards to establish himself in the\r\nport. The functions of the vice-consul would become dormant during the\r\npresence of his principal, come into activity again on his departure,\r\nand thus spare us and them the painful operation of revoking and\r\nreviving their commissions perpetually. Add to this, that during the\r\npresence of the consul, the vice-consul would not be merely useless, but\r\nwould be a valuable counsellor to his principal, new in the office, the\r\nlanguage, laws, and customs of the country. Every consul and vice-consul\r\nshould be restrained in his jurisdiction, to the port for which he is\r\nnamed, and the territory nearer to that than to any other consular or\r\nvice-consular port, and no idea be permitted to arise, that the grade\r\nof consul gives a right to any authority whatever over a vice-consul, or\r\ndraws on any dependence.\r\n\r\nIt is now proper I should give some account of the state of our dispute\r\nwith Schweighaeuser and Dobree. In the conversation I had with Dobree,\r\nat Nantes, he appeared to think so rationally on this subject, that I\r\nthought there would be no difficulty in accommodating it with him, and\r\nI wished rather to settle it by accommodation, than to apply to the\r\nminister. I afterwards had it intimated to him, through the medium\r\nof Mr. Carnes, that I had it in idea, to propose a reference to\r\narbitrators. He expressed a cheerful concurrence in it. I thereupon made\r\nthe proposition to him formally, by letter, mentioning particularly,\r\nthat we would choose our arbitrators of some neutral nation, and, of\r\npreference, from among the Dutch refugees here. I was surprised to\r\nreceive an answer from him, wherein, after expressing his own readiness\r\nto accede to this proposition, he added, that on consulting Mr.\r\nPuchilberg, he had declined it; nevertheless, he wished a fuller\r\nexplanation from me, as to the subjects to be submitted to arbitration.\r\nI gave him that explanation, and he answered finally, that Mr.\r\nPuchilberg refused all accommodation, and insisted that the matter\r\nshould be decided by the tribunals of the country. Accommodation being\r\nat an end, I wrote to Monsieur de Montmorin, and insisted on the usage\r\nof nations, which does not permit the effects of one sovereign, to\r\nbe seized in the territories of another, and subjected to judiciary\r\ndecision there. I am promised that the stores shall be delivered; but\r\nthe necessary formalities will occasion some delay. The King being\r\nauthorized to call all causes before himself, ours will be evoked from\r\nthe tribunal where it is, and will be ended by an order to deliver\r\nup the stores arrested, leaving it to the justice of Congress, to do\r\nafterwards what is right, as to the demand of Schweighaeuser and Dobree.\r\nI wish I could receive instructions what to do with the stores, when\r\ndelivered. The arms had certainly better be sent to America, as they are\r\ngood, and yet will sell here for little or nothing. The gun-stocks\r\nand old iron had better be sold here; but what should be done with the\r\nanchors? Being thoroughly persuaded that Congress wish that substantial\r\njustice should be done to Schweighaeuser and Dobree, I shall, after the\r\nstores are secured, repeat my proposition of arbitration to them. If\r\nthey then refuse it, I shall return all the papers to America, and\r\nconsider my powers for settling this matter as at an end.\r\n\r\nI have received no answer yet from Denmark on the subject of the prizes;\r\nnor do I know whether to ascribe this silence to an intention to evade\r\nthe demand, or to the multitude of affairs they have had on their hands\r\nlately. Patience seems to be prudence, in this case; to indispose them,\r\nwould do no good, and might do harm. I shall write again soon, if no\r\nanswer be received in the mean time.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\n\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The following is the translation of the convention referred\r\n     to as No. 5. in the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\n_Convention between his Most Christian Majesty and the United States of\r\nAmerica, for the purpose of defining and establishing the Functions and\r\nPrivileges of their respective Consuls and Vice-Consuls_.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Most Christian King, and the United States of America,\r\nhaving, by the twenty-ninth article of the treaty of amity and commerce\r\nconcluded between them, mutually granted the liberty of having, in\r\ntheir respective States and ports, Consuls, Vice-Consuls, Agents, and\r\nCommissaries, and being willing, in consequence thereof, to define\r\nand establish, in a reciprocal and permanent manner, the functions\r\nand privileges of Consuls and Vice-Consuls, which they have judged it\r\nconvenient to establish of preference, his M. C. Majesty has nominated\r\nthe Sieur Count of Montmorin of St. Herent, Marechal of his Camps and\r\nArmies, Knight of his Orders and of the Golden Fleece, his Counsellor\r\nin all his Councils, Minister and Secretary of State, and of his\r\nCommandments and Finances, having the department of foreign affairs, and\r\nthe United States have nominated Thomas Jefferson, citizen of the United\r\nStates of America and their Minister Plenipotentiary near the King, who\r\nafter having communicated to each other their respective full powers,\r\nhave agreed on what follows:\r\n\r\nArticle I. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls named by the M. C. K. and the\r\nUnited States, shall be bound to present their commissions according to\r\nthe forms which shall be established respectively by the M. C. K. within\r\nhis dominions, and by the Congress within the United States; there shall\r\nbe delivered to them, without any charges, the _Exequatur_ necessary for\r\nthe exercise of their functions; and on exhibiting the said _Exequatur_,\r\nthe governors, commanders, heads of justice, bodies corporate,\r\ntribunals, and other officers having authority in the ports and places\r\nof their consulates, shall cause them to enjoy immediately, and without\r\ndifficulty, the pre-eminences, authority, and privileges, reciprocally\r\ngranted, without exacting from the said Consuls and Vice-Consuls any\r\nfee, under any pretext whatever.\r\n\r\nArticle II. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls, and persons attached to their\r\nfunctions, that is to say, their chancellors and secretaries, shall\r\nenjoy a full and entire immunity for their chancery and the papers\r\nwhich shall be therein contained: they shall be exempt from aU, personal\r\nservice, from soldiers’ billets, militia, watch, guard, guardianship,\r\ntrusteeship, as well as from all duties, taxes, impositions, and charges\r\nwhatsoever, except on the estate real and personal of which they may\r\nbe the proprietors or possessors, which shall be subject to the taxes\r\nimposed on the estates of all other individuals: and in all other\r\ninstances they shall be subject to the laws of the land, as the natives\r\nare.\r\n\r\nThose of the said Consuls and Vice-Consuls who shall exercise commerce,\r\nshall be respectively subject to all taxes, charges, and impositions\r\nestablished on other merchants.\r\n\r\nThey shall place over the outward door of their house the arms of their\r\nsovereign: but this mark of indication shall not give to the said house\r\nany privilege of asylum for any person or property whatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle III. The respective Consuls and Vice-Consuls may establish\r\nagents in the different ports and places of their departments, where\r\nnecessity shall require. These agents maybe chosen among the merchants,\r\neither national or foreign, and furnished with a commission from one\r\nof the said Consuls; they shall confine themselves respectively to the\r\nrendering to their respective merchants, navigators, and vessels, all\r\npossible service, and to inform the nearest Consul of the wants of\r\nthe said merchants, navigators, and vessels, without the said agents\r\notherwise participating in the immunities, rights, and privileges\r\nattributed to Consuls and Vice-Consuls, and without power, under any\r\npretext whatever, to exact from the said merchants any duty or emolument\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle IV. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls respectively, may establish a\r\nchancery, where shall be deposited the consular determinations, acts,\r\nand proceedings, as also testaments, obligations, contracts, and other\r\nacts done by or between persons of their nation, and effects left by\r\ndecedents, or saved from shipwreck.\r\n\r\nThey may, consequently, appoint fit persons to act in the said chancery,\r\nqualify and swear them in, commit to them the custody of the seal, and\r\nauthority to seal commissions, sentences, and other consular acts,\r\nand also to discharge the functions of notaries and registers of the\r\nconsulate.\r\n\r\nArticle V. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls respectively, shall have the\r\nexclusive right of receiving in their chancery, or on board their\r\nvessels, the declarations and all other the acts which the captains,\r\nmasters, crews, passengers, and merchants of their nation may choose to\r\nmake there, even their testaments and other disposals by last will: and\r\nthe copies of the said acts, duly authenticated by the said Consuls or\r\nVice-Consuls, under the seal of their consulate, shall receive faith\r\nin law, equally as their originals would, in all the tribunals of the\r\ndominions of the M. C. King and of the United States.\r\n\r\nThey shall also have, and exclusively, in case of the absence of the\r\ntestamentary executor, guardian, or lawful representative, the right\r\nto inventory, liquidate, and proceed to the sale of the personal estate\r\nleft by subjects or citizens of their nation, who shall die within\r\nthe extent of their consulate; they shall proceed therein with the\r\nassistance of two merchants of their said nation, or, for want of them,\r\nof any other at their choice, and shall cause to be deposited in their\r\nchancery, the effects and papers of the said estates; and no officer,\r\nmilitary, judiciary, or of the police of the country, shall disturb them\r\nor interfere therein, in any manner whatsoever: but the said Consuls\r\nand Vice-Consuls shall not deliver up the said effects, nor the proceeds\r\nthereof, to the lawful representatives or to their order, till they\r\nshall have caused to be paid all debts which the deceased shall have\r\ncontracted in the country; for which purpose the creditor shall have a\r\nright to attach the said effects in their hands, as they might in those\r\nof any other individual whatever, and proceed to obtain sale of them,\r\ntill payment of what shall be lawfully due to them. When the debts\r\nshall not have been contracted by judgment, deed, or note, the signature\r\nwhereof shall be known, payment shall not be ordered, but on the\r\ncreditor’s giving sufficient surety resident in the country, to refund\r\nthe sums he shall have unduly received, principal, interest, and costs;\r\nwhich surety, nevertheless, shall stand duly discharged after the\r\nterm of one year, in time of peace, and of two, in time of war, if the\r\ndischarge cannot be formed before the end of this term, against the*\r\nrepresentatives who shall present themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd in order that the representatives may not be unjustly kept out of\r\nthe effects of the deceased, the Consuls and Vice-Consuls shall notify\r\nhis death in some one of the gazettes published within their consulate,\r\nand that they shall retain the said effects in their hands four months,\r\nto answer all just demands which shall be presented; and they shall be\r\nbound, after this delay, to deliver to the persons succeeding thereto,\r\nwhat shall be more than sufficient for the demands which shall have been\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nArticle VI. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls, respectively, shall receive\r\nthe declarations, protests, and reports of all captains and masters of\r\ntheir respective nations, on account of average losses sustained at sea;\r\nand these captains and masters shall lodge in the chancery of the said\r\nConsuls and Vice-Consuls, the acts which they may have made in other\r\nports, on account of the accidents which may have happened to them on\r\ntheir voyage. If a subject of the M. C. K. and a citizen of the United\r\nStates, or a foreigner, are interested in the said cargo, the average\r\nshall be settled by the tribunals of the country, and not by the Consuls\r\nor Vice-Consuls; but when only the subjects or citizens of their own\r\nnation shall be interested, the respective Consuls or Vice-Consuls shall\r\nappoint skilful persons to settle the damages and average.\r\n\r\nArticle VII. In cases where by tempest, or other accident, French ships\r\nor vessels shall be stranded on the coasts of the United States, and\r\nships or vessels of the United States shall be stranded on the coasts of\r\nthe dominions of the M. C. K.,the Consul or Vice-Consul nearest to the\r\nplace of shipwreck shall do whatever he may judge proper, as well\r\nfor the purpose of saving the said ship or vessel, its cargo and\r\nappurtenances, as for the storing and the security of the effects\r\nand merchandise saved. He may take an inventory of them, without the\r\nintermeddling of any officers of the military, of the customs, of\r\njustice, or of the police of the country, otherwise than to give to the\r\nConsuls, Vice-Consuls, captain, and crew of the vessels shipwrecked or\r\nstranded, all the succor and favor which they shall ask of them, either\r\nfor the expedition and security of the saving and of the effects saved,\r\nas to prevent all disturbance.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to prevent all kind of dispute and discussion in the said\r\ncases of shipwreck, it is agreed that when there shall be no Consul or\r\nVice-Consul to attend to the saving of the wreck, or that the residence\r\nof the said Consul or Vice-Consul (he not being at the place of the\r\nwreck) shall be more distant from the said place than that of the\r\ncompetent judge of the country, the latter shall immediately proceed\r\ntherein, with all the despatch, certainty, and precautions, prescribed\r\nby the respective laws; but the said territorial judge shall retire, on\r\nthe arrival of the Consul or Vice-Consul, and shall deliver over to\r\nhim the report of his proceedings, the expenses of which the Consul and\r\nVice-Consul shall cause to be reimbursed to him, as well as those of\r\nsaving the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe merchandise and effects saved, shall be deposited in the nearest\r\nCustom-house, or other place of safety, with the inventory thereof,\r\nwhich shall have been made by the Consul or Vice-Consul, or by the judge\r\nwho shall have proceeded in their absence, that the said effects and\r\nmerchandise may be afterwards delivered (after levying therefrom the\r\ncosts), and without form of process, to the owners, who, being\r\nfurnished with an order for their delivery, from the nearest Consul or\r\nVice-Consul, shall reclaim them by themselves, or by their order, either\r\nfor the purpose of re-exporting such merchandise, in which case, they\r\nshall-pay no kind of duty of exportation, or for that of selling them in\r\nthe country, if they be not prohibited there; and in this last case, the\r\nsaid merchandise, if they be damaged, shall be allowed an abatement of\r\nentrance duties, proportioned to the damage they have sustained, which\r\nshall be ascertained by the affidavits taken at the time the vessel was\r\nwrecked or struck.\r\n\r\nArticle VIII. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls shall exercise police over\r\nall the vessels of their respective nations, and shall have on board the\r\nsaid vessels, all power and jurisdiction in civil matters, in all the\r\ndisputes which may there arise; they shall have an entire inspection\r\nover the said vessels, their crew, and the changes and substitutions\r\nthere to be made. For which purpose they may go on board the said\r\nvessels whenever they may judge it necessary: well understood, that\r\nthe functions hereby allowed shall be confined to the interior of the\r\nvessels, and that they shall not take place in any case, which shall\r\nhave any interference with the police of the ports where the said\r\nvessels shall be.\r\n\r\nArticle IX. The Consuls and Vice-Consuls may cause to be arrested the\r\ncaptains, officers, mariners, sailors, and all other persons, being part\r\nof the crews of the vessels of their respective nations, who shall\r\nhave deserted from the said vessels, in order to send them back, and\r\ntransport them out of the country. For which purpose, the said Consuls\r\nand Vice-Consuls shall address themselves to the courts, judges, and\r\nofficers competent, and shall demand the said deserters in writing,\r\nproving by an exhibition of the registers of the vessel or ship’s roll,\r\nthat those men were part of the said crews: and on this demand, so\r\nproved (saving, however, where the contrary is proved), the delivery\r\nshall not be refused¦; and there shall be given all aid and assistance\r\nto the said Consuls and Vice-Consuls, for the search, seizure, and\r\narrest of the said deserters, who shall even be detained and kept in the\r\nprisons of the country, at their request and expense, until they shall\r\nhave found an opportunity of sending them back. But if they be not sent\r\nback within three months, to be counted from the day of their arrest,\r\nthey shall be set at liberty, and shall be no more arrested for the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nArticle X. In cases where the respective subjects, or citizens, shall\r\nhave committed any crime, or breach of the peace, they shall be amenable\r\nto the judges of the country.\r\n\r\nArticle XI. When the said offenders shall be a part of the crew of a\r\nvessel of their nation, and shall have withdrawn themselves on board\r\nthe said vessel, they may be there seized and arrested by order of the\r\njudges of the country: these shall give notice thereof to the Consul\r\nor Vice-Consul, who may repair on board, if he thinks proper: but this\r\nnotification shall not, in any case, delay execution of the order in\r\nquestion. The persons arrested shall not afterwards be set at liberty,\r\nuntil the Consul or Vice-Consul shall have been notified thereof; and\r\nthey shall be delivered to him, if he requires it, to be put again\r\nonboard of the vessel on which they were arrested, or of others of their\r\nnation, and to be sent out of the country.\r\n\r\nArticle XII.

S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, November 18, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, November 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 31st of July; since which, I have received\r\nyours of July the 24th, August the 10th, and 23rd. The first part of\r\nthis long silence in me was occasioned by a knowledge that you were\r\nabsent from New York; the latter part, by a want of opportunity, which\r\nhas been longer than usual. Mr. Shippen being just arrived here, and\r\nto set out to-morrow for London, I avail myself of that channel of\r\nconveyance. Mr. Carrington was so kind as to send me the second volume\r\nof the American Philosophical Transactions, the Federalist, and some\r\nother interesting pamphlets; and I am to thank you for another copy of\r\nthe Federalist, and the report of the instructions to the ministers for\r\nnegotiating peace. The latter unluckily omitted exactly the passage I\r\nwanted, which was what related to the navigation of the Mississippi.\r\nWith respect to the Federalist, the three authors had been named to me.\r\nI read it with care, pleasure, and improvement, and was satisfied there\r\nwas nothing in it by one of those hands, and not a great deal by a\r\nsecond. It does the highest honor to the third, as being, in my opinion,\r\nthe best commentary on the principles of government, which ever was\r\nwritten. In some parts, it is discoverable that the author means only\r\nto say what may be best said in defence of opinions, in which he did not\r\nconcur. But in general, it establishes firmly the plan of government.\r\nI confess, it has rectified me on several points. As to the bill of\r\nrights, however, I still think it should be added; and I am glad to see,\r\nthat three States have at length considered the perpetual re-eligibility\r\nof the President, as an article which should be amended. I should\r\ndeprecate with you, indeed, the meeting of a new convention. I hope\r\nthey will adopt the mode of amendment by Congress and the Assemblies, in\r\nwhich case, I should not fear any dangerous innovation in the plan. But\r\nthe minorities are too respectable, not to be entitled to some sacrifice\r\nof opinion in the majority; especially, when a great proportion of them\r\nwould be contented with a bill of rights. Here, things internally, are\r\ngoing on well. The _Notables_ now in session, have, indeed, passed one\r\nvote, which augurs ill to the rights of the people; but if they do not\r\nobtain now so much as they have a right to, they will in the long\r\nrun. The misfortune is, that they are not yet ripe for receiving the\r\nblessings to which they are entitled. I doubt, for instance, whether\r\nthe body of the nation, if they could be consulted, would accept of\r\na _habeas corpus_ law, if offered them by the King. If the _Etats\r\nGeneraux_, when they assemble, do not aim at too much, they may begin\r\na good constitution. There are three articles which they may easily\r\nobtain; 1. their own meeting, periodically; 2. the exclusive right of\r\ntaxation; 3. the right of registering laws and proposing amendments to\r\nthem, as exercised now by the parliaments. This last would be readily\r\napproved by the court, on account of their hostility against the\r\nparliaments, and would lead immediately to the origination of laws:\r\nthe second has been already solemnly avowed by the King; and it is well\r\nunderstood, there would be no opposition to the first. If they push at\r\nmuch more, all may fail. I shall not enter further into public details,\r\nbecause my letter to Mr. Jay will give them. That contains a request of\r\npermission to return to America the next spring, for the summer only.\r\nThe reasons therein urged, drawn from my private affairs, are very\r\ncogent. But there is another, more cogent on my mind, though of a nature\r\nnot to be explained in a public letter. It is the necessity of attending\r\nmy daughters, myself, to their own country, and depositing them safely\r\nin the hands of those, with whom I can safely leave them. I have\r\ndeferred this request as long as circumstances would permit, and am in\r\nhopes it will meet with no difficulty. I have had too many proofs\r\nof your friendship, not to rely on your patronage of it, as, in all\r\nprobability, nothing can suffer by a short absence. But the immediate\r\npermission is what I am anxious about; as by going in April and\r\nreturning in October, I shall be sure of pleasant and short passages,\r\nout and in. I must intreat your attention, my friend, to this matter,\r\nand that the answers may be sent me through several channels.\r\n\r\nMr. Liniozin, at Havre, sent you, by mistake, a package belonging to\r\nsomebody else. I do not know what it contained, but he has written to\r\nyou on the subject, and prayed me to do the same, he is likely to suffer\r\nif it be not returned.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the funding their foreign debt will be among the first\r\noperations of the new government, I send you two estimates; the one by\r\nmyself, the other by a gentleman infinitely better acquainted with the\r\nsubject, showing what fund will suffice to discharge the principal and\r\ninterest, as it shall become due, aided by occasional loans, which the\r\nsame fund will repay. I enclose them to you, because collating them\r\ntogether, and with your own ideas, you will be able to advise something\r\nbetter than either; but something must be done. This government will\r\nexpect, I fancy, a very satisfactory provision for the payment of their\r\ndebt, from the first session of the new Congress. Perhaps, in this\r\nmatter, as well as the arrangement of your foreign affairs, I may be\r\nable, when on the spot with you, to give some information and suggest\r\nsome hints, which may render my visit to my native country not\r\naltogether useless. I consider as no small advantage, the resuming the\r\ntone of mind of my constituents, which is lost by long absence, and can\r\nonly be recovered by mixing with them; and shall, particularly, hope for\r\nmuch profit and pleasure, by contriving to pass as much time as possible\r\nwith you. Should you have a trip to Virginia in contemplation, for that\r\nyear, I hope you will time it so as that we may be there together. I\r\nwill camp you at Monticello, where, if illy entertained otherwise, you\r\nshall not want books. In firm hope of a happy meeting with you in the\r\nspring, or early in summer, I conclude, with assurances of the sincere\r\nesteem and attachment, with which I am, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIX.--TO A. DONALD, November 18,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. DONALD.\r\n\r\nParis, November 18,1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOften solicited by persons on this side the water, to inquire for their\r\nfriends in America, about whose fate they are uncertain, I can only hand\r\non their requests to my friends in America. The enclosed letter from,\r\nthe Chevalier de Sigougne desires some inquiry after his brother, whom\r\nhe supposes to have settled at Todd’s Bridge. As this is within your\r\nreach, I must refer the request to your humanity, and beg of you, if you\r\ncan hear of him, you will be so good as to give me an account of him,\r\nreturning me the enclosed letter at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe campaign between the Turks and Russians has been tolerably\r\nequal. The Austrians have suffered through the whole of it. By the\r\ninterposition of Prussia and England, peace is likely to be made between\r\nRussia, Denmark, and Sweden. This is a proof that England does not mean\r\nto engage in the war herself. This country will certainly engage herself\r\nin no manner, externally, before the meeting of her States General. This\r\nassembly has been so long disused, that the forms of its convocation\r\noccasion difficulty. The _Notables_ have been convened to prescribe\r\nthem, and they are now in session. I am in hopes this will end in giving\r\na good degree of liberty to this country. They enjoy, at present, the\r\nmost perfect tranquillity within; their stocks, however, continue low,\r\nand money difficult to be got for current expenses. It is hoped,\r\nthat Mr. Necker’s talents and popularity, with the aid of a National\r\nAssembly, will extricate them from their difficulties. We have been\r\ndaily expecting to hear of the death of the King of England: our last\r\nnews is of the 11th, when he was thought in the utmost danger. This\r\nevent might produce a great change in the situation of things: it\r\nis supposed Mr. Fox would come into place, and he has been generally\r\nunderstood to be disposed for war. Should the King survive, I think the\r\ncontinuance of peace more probable at present, than it has been for some\r\ntime past. Be so good as to contrive the enclosed letter, by a very safe\r\nconveyance. Remember me in the most friendly terms to Dr. Currie, and\r\nbe assured yourself of the esteem and attachment, with which I am. Dear\r\nSir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXX.--TO JOHN JAY, November 19, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, November 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nSince my letter of September the 5th, wherein I acknowledged Mr.\r\nRemsen’s favor of July the 25th, I have written those of September the\r\n24th, and of the 14th instant. This last will accompany the present,\r\nboth going by the way of London, for want of a direct opportunity; but\r\nthey go by a private hand.\r\n\r\nNo late event worth notice has taken place between the Turks and\r\nAustrians. The former continue in the territories of the latter, with\r\nall the appearances of superiority. On the side of Russia, the war wears\r\nan equal face, except that the Turks are still masters of the Black sea.\r\nOczakow is not yet taken. Denmark furnished to Russia its stipulated\r\nquota of troops with so much alacrity, and was making such other warlike\r\npreparations, that it was believed they meant to become principals\r\nin the war against Sweden. Russia and England hereupon interposed\r\nefficaciously. Their ministers appointed to meditate, gave notice to\r\nthe court of Copenhagen, that they would declare war against them in the\r\nname of their two sovereigns, if they did not immediately withdraw their\r\ntroops from the Swedish territories. The court of London has since\r\nsaid, that their minister (Elliott) went further in this than he\r\nwas authorized. However, the Danish troops are retiring. Poland\r\nis augmenting its army from twenty to an hundred thousand men.\r\nNevertheless, it seems as if England and Prussia meant in earnest to\r\nstop the war in that quarter, contented to leave the two empires in\r\nthe hands of the Turks. France, desired by Sweden to join the courts\r\nof London and Berlin in their mediation between Sweden and Russia, has\r\ndeclined it. We may be assured, she will meddle in nothing external\r\nbefore the meeting of the States General. Her temporary annihilation\r\nin the political scale of Europe, leaves to England and Prussia\r\nthe splendid roll, of giving the law without meeting the shadow of\r\nopposition. The internal tranquillity of this country is perfect: their\r\nstocks, however, continue low, and the difficulty of getting money to\r\nface current expenses very great. In the contest between the King and\r\nparliament, the latter, fearing the power of the former, passed the\r\nconvoking the States General. The government found itself obliged\r\nby other difficulties, also, to recur to the same expedient. The\r\nparliament, after its recall, showed that it was now become apprehensive\r\nof the States General, and discovered a determination to cavil at their\r\nform, so as to have a right to deny their legality, if that body should\r\nundertake to abridge their powers. The court, hereupon, very adroitly\r\ndetermined to call the same _Notables_, who had been approved by the\r\nnation the last year, to decide on the form of convoking the _Etats\r\nGeneraux_: thus withdrawing itself from the disputes which the\r\nparliament might excite, and committing them with the nation. The\r\n_Notables_ are now in session. The government had manifestly discovered\r\na disposition that the _Tiers-Etat_, or Commons, should have as many\r\nrepresentatives in the States General, as the Nobility and Clergy\r\ntogether: but five Bureaux of the _Notables_ have voted by very great\r\nmajorities, that they should have only an equal number with each of the\r\nother orders singly. One bureau, by a majority of a single voice, had\r\nagreed to give the Commons the double number of representatives. This\r\nis the first symptom of a decided combination between the Nobility and\r\nClergy, and will necessarily throw the people into the scale of the\r\nKing. It is doubted, whether the States can be called so early as\r\nJanuary, though the government, urged by the want of money, is for\r\npressing the convocation. It is still more uncertain what the States\r\nwill do when they meet: there are three objects which they may attain,\r\nprobably without opposition from the court; 1. A periodical meeting\r\nof the States; 2. their exclusive right of taxation; 3. the right of\r\nen-registering laws and proposing amendments to them, as now exercised\r\nby the parliaments. This would lead, as it did in England, to the right\r\nof originating laws. The parliament would, by the last measure, be\r\nreduced to a mere judiciary body, and would probably oppose it. But\r\nagainst the King and nation their opposition could not succeed. If the\r\nStates stop here, for the present moment, all will probably end well,\r\nand they may, in future sessions, obtain a suppression of _lettres de\r\ncachet_, a free press, a civil list, and other valuable mollifications\r\nof their government. But it is to be feared, that an impatience to\r\nrectify every thing at once, which prevails in some minds, may terrify\r\nthe court, and lead them to appeal to force, and to depend on that\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBefore this can reach you, you will probably have heard of an _Arrêt_,\r\npassed the 28th of September, for prohibiting the introduction of\r\nforeign whale-oils, without exception. The English had glutted the\r\nmarkets of this country with their oils: it was proposed to exclude\r\nthem, and an _Arrêt_ was drawn, with an exception for us: in the last\r\nstage of the _Arrêt_, the exception was struck out, without my having\r\nany warning, or even suspicion of this. I suspect this stroke came from\r\nthe Count de la Luzerne, minister of marine; but I cannot affirm it\r\npositively. As soon as I was apprized of this, which was several days\r\nafter it passed (because it was kept secret till published in their\r\nseaports), I wrote to the Count de Montmorin a letter, of which the\r\nenclosed is a copy, and had conferences on the subject, from time to\r\ntime, with him and the other ministers. I found them prepossessed by the\r\npartial information of their Dunkirk fishermen; and therefore thought it\r\nnecessary to give them a view of the whole subject in writing, which\r\nI did, in the piece, of which I enclose you a printed copy. I therein\r\nentered into more details, than the question between us seemed\r\nrigorously to require. I was led to them by other objects. The most\r\nimportant was to disgust Mr. Necker, as an economist, against their new\r\nfishery, by letting him foresee its expense. The particular manufactures\r\nsuggested to them, were in consequence of repeated applications from\r\nthe shippers of rice and tobacco: other details, which do not appear\r\nimmediately pertinent, were occasioned by circumstances which had arisen\r\nin conversation, or an apparent necessity of giving information on the\r\nwhole matter. At a conference, in the presence of M. Lambert, on the\r\n16th (where I was ably aided by the Marquis de la Fayette, as I have\r\nbeen through the whole business), it was agreed to except us from the\r\nprohibition. But they will require rigorous assurance, that the oils\r\ncoming under our name are really of our fishery. They fear we shall\r\ncover the introduction of the English oils from Halifax. The _Arrêt_ for\r\nexcepting us was communicated to me, but the formalities of proving the\r\noils to be American were not yet inserted. I suppose they will require\r\nevery vessel to bring a certificate from their Consul or Vice-Consul\r\nresiding in the State from which it comes. More difficult proofs were\r\nsometimes talked of. I supposed I might surely affirm to them, that our\r\ngovernment would do whatever it could to prevent this fraud, because it\r\nis as much our interest as theirs to keep the market for the French\r\nand American oils only. I am told Massachusetts has prohibited the\r\nintroduction of foreign fish-oils into her ports. This law, if well\r\nexecuted, will be an effectual guard against fraud; and a similar one in\r\nthe other States, interested in the fishery, would much encourage this\r\ngovernment to continue her indulgence to us. Though the _Arrêt_, then,\r\nfor the re-admission of our oils is not yet passed, I think I may assure\r\nyou it will be so in a few days, and of course that this branch of\r\ncommerce, after so threatening an appearance, will be on a better\r\nfooting than ever, as enjoying, jointly with the French oil, a monopoly\r\nof their markets. The continuance of this will depend on the growth of\r\ntheir fishery. Whenever they become able to supply their own wants, it\r\nis very possible they may refuse to take our oils; but I do not believe\r\nit possible for them to raise their fishery to that, unless they can\r\ncontinue to draw off our fishermen from us. Their seventeen ships, this\r\nyear, had one hundred and fifty of our sailors on board. I do not know\r\nwhat number the English have got into their service. You will readily\r\nperceive, that there are particulars in these printed observations,\r\nwhich it would not be proper to suffer to become public. They were\r\nprinted, merely that a copy might be given to each minister, and care\r\nhas been taken to let them go into no other hands.\r\n\r\nI must now trouble Congress with a petition on my own behalf. When\r\nI left my own house in October, 1783, it was to attend Congress as a\r\nmember, and in expectation of returning in five or six months. In the\r\nmonth of May following, however, I was desired to come to Europe, as\r\nmember of a commission, which was to continue two years only. I came\r\noff immediately, without going home to make any other arrangements in my\r\naffairs, thinking they would not suffer greatly before I should return\r\nto them. Before the close of the two years, Doctor Franklin retiring\r\nfrom his charge here, Congress were pleased to name me to it; so that I\r\nhave been led on by events to an absence of five years, instead of five\r\nmonths. In the mean time, matters of great moment to others as well as\r\nmyself, and which can be arranged by nobody but myself, will await no\r\nlonger. Another motive, of still more powerful co-agency on my mind, is\r\nthe necessity of carrying my family back to their friends and country.\r\nI must, therefore, ask of Congress a leave of short absence. Allowing\r\nthree months on the sea, going and coming, and two months at my own\r\nhouse, which will suffice for my affairs, I need not be from Paris but\r\nbetween five and six months. I do not foresee any thing which can suffer\r\nduring my absence. The consular convention is finished, except as to the\r\nexchange of ratification, which will be the affair of a day only. The\r\ndifference with Schweighaeuser and Dobree, relative to our arms, will be\r\nfinished. That of Denmark, if ever finished, will probably be long spun\r\nout. The ransom of the Algerine captives is the only matter likely to\r\nbe on hand. That cannot be set on foot till the money is raised in\r\nHolland, and an order received for its application: probably these will\r\ntake place, so that I may set it into motion, before my departure; if\r\nnot, I can still leave it on such a footing, as to be put into motion\r\nthe moment the money can be paid. And even when the leave of Congress\r\nshall be received, I will not make use of it, if there is any thing\r\nof consequence which may suffer; but would, postpone my departure till\r\ncircumstances will admit it. But should these be as I expect they will,\r\nit will be vastly desirable to me to receive the permission immediately,\r\nso that I may go out as soon as the vernal equinox is over, and be sure\r\nof my return in good time and season in the fall. Mr. Short, who had had\r\nthoughts of returning to America, will postpone that return till I come\r\nback. His talents and character allow me to say, with confidence, that\r\nnothing will suffer in his hands. The friendly dispositions of Monsieur\r\nde Montmorin would induce him readily to communicate with Mr. Short in\r\nhis present character; but should any of his applications be necessary\r\nto be laid before the Council, they might suffer difficulty: nor could\r\nhe attend the diplomatic societies, which are the most certain sources\r\nof good intelligence. Would Congress think it expedient to remove the\r\ndifficulties, by naming him secretary of legation, so that he would act\r\nof course as _chargé des affaires_ during my absence? It would be just,\r\nthat the difference between the salary of a secretary and a secretary of\r\nlegation should cease, as soon as he should cease to be charged with the\r\naffairs of the United States; that is to say, on my return: and he would\r\nexpect that. So that this difference for five or six months would be an\r\naffair of about one hundred and seventy guineas only, which would be not\r\nmore than equal to the additional expense that would be brought on him\r\nnecessarily by the change of character. I mention these particulars,\r\nthat Congress may see the end as well as beginning of the proposition,\r\nand have only to add, ‘their will be done.’ Leave for me being obtained,\r\nI will ask it, Sir, of your friendship, to avail yourself of various\r\noccasions to the ports of France and England to convey me immediate\r\nnotice of it, and relieve me as soon as possible from the anxiety of\r\nexpectation, and the uncertainty in which I shall be. We have been in\r\ndaily expectation of hearing of the death of the King of England. Our\r\nlatest news are of the 11th. He had then been despaired of for three or\r\nfour days; but as my letter is to pass through England, you will have\r\nlater accounts of him than that can give you. I send you the newspapers\r\nto this date, and have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. The last crop of corn in France has been so short, that they\r\napprehend want. Mr. Necker desires me to make known this scarcity to our\r\nmerchants, in hopes they would send supplies. I promised him I would. If\r\nit could be done without naming him, it would be agreeable to him, and\r\nprobably advantageous to the adventurers. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The annexed are the observations on the subject of admitting our\r\nwhale-oil in the markets of France, referred to in the preceding\r\nletter.]\r\n\r\nWhale-oil enters, as a raw material, into several branches of\r\nmanufacture, as of wool, leather, soap: it is used also in painting,\r\narchitecture, and navigation. But its great consumption is in lighting\r\nhouses and cities. For this last purpose, however, it has a powerful\r\ncompetitor in the vegetable oils. These do well in warm, still weather,\r\nbut they fix with cold, they extinguish easily with the wind, their crop\r\nis precarious, depending on the seasons, and to yield the same light,\r\na larger wick must be used, and greater quantity of oil consumed.\r\nEstimating all these articles of difference together, those employed in\r\nlighting cities find their account in giving about twenty-five per\r\ncent, more for whale than for vegetable oils. But higher than this the\r\nwhale-oil, in its present form, cannot rise; because it then becomes\r\nmore advantageous to the city lighters to use others. This competition,\r\nthen, limits its price, higher than which no encouragement can raise it;\r\nand it becomes, as it were, a law of its nature. But, at this low price,\r\nthe whale-fishery is the poorest business into which a merchant or\r\nsailor can enter. If the sailor, instead of wages, has a part of what is\r\ntaken, he finds that this, one year with another, yields him less than\r\nhe could have got as wages in any other business. It is attended, too,\r\nwith great risk, singular hardships, and long absence from his family,\r\nif the voyage is made solely at the expense of the merchant, he finds\r\nthat, one year with another, it does not reimburse him his expense. As\r\nfor example; an English ship of three hundred tons and forty-two hands\r\nbrings home, _communibus annis_, after four months’ voyage, twenty-five\r\ntons of oil, worth four hundred and thirty-seven pounds ten shillings\r\nsterling. But the wages of the officers and seamen will be four hundred\r\npounds; the outfit, then, and the merchants’ profit, must be paid by the\r\ngovernment: and it is accordingly on this idea, that the British bounty\r\nis calculated. From the poverty of this business, then, it has happened,\r\nthat the nations who have taken it up have successively abandoned it.\r\nThe Basques began it: but though the most economical and enterprising of\r\nthe inhabitants of France, they could not continue it; and it is said,\r\nthey never employed more than thirty ships a year. The Dutch and Hanse\r\ntowns succeeded them. The latter gave it up long ago. The English\r\ncarried it on, in competition with the Dutch, during the last and\r\nbeginning of the present century: but it was too little profitable for\r\nthem, in comparison with other branches of commerce open to them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the inhabitants of the barren island of Nantucket had\r\ntaken up this fishery, invited to it by the whales presenting themselves\r\non their own shore. To them, therefore, the English relinquished it,\r\ncontinuing to them, as British subjects, the importation of their oils\r\ninto England, duty free, while foreigners were subject to a duty of\r\neighteen pounds five shillings sterling a ton. The Dutch were enabled\r\nto continue it long, because, 1. They are so near the northern fishing\r\ngrounds, that a vessel begins her fishing very soon after she is out\r\nof port. 2. They navigate with more economy than the other nations of\r\nEurope. 3. Their seamen are content with lower wages: and, 4. Their\r\nmerchants, with a lower profit on their capital. Under all these\r\nfavorable circumstances, however, this branch of business, after long\r\nlanguishing, is at length nearly extinct with them. It is said, they did\r\nnot send above half a dozen ships in pursuit of the whale this present\r\nyear. The _Nantuckois_, then, were the only people who exercised\r\nthis fishery to any extent at the commencement of the late war. Their\r\ncountry, from its barrenness yielding no subsistence, they were obliged\r\nto seek it in the sea which surrounded them. Their economy was more\r\nrigorous than that of the Dutch. Their seamen, instead of wages, had a\r\nshare in what was taken: this induced them to fish with fewer hands,\r\nso that each had a greater dividend in the profit; it made them more\r\nvigilant in seeking game, bolder in pursuing it, and parsimonious in all\r\ntheir expenses. London was their only market. When, therefore, by\r\nthe late revolution, they became aliens in Great Britain, they became\r\nsubject to the alien duty of eighteen pounds five shillings the ton of\r\noil, which being more than equal to the price of the common whale-oil,\r\nthey are obliged to abandon that fishery. So that this people, who,\r\nbefore the war, had employed upwards of three hundred vessels a year in\r\nthe whale-fishery (while Great Britain had herself never employed one\r\nhundred), have now almost ceased to exercise it. But they still had the\r\nseamen, the most important material for this fishery; and they still\r\nretained the spirit for fishing: so that, at the re-establishment\r\nof peace, they were capable, in a very short time, of reviving their\r\nfishery in all its splendor. The British government saw that the moment\r\nwas critical. They knew that their own share in that fishery was as\r\nnothing: that the great mass of fishermen was left with a nation now\r\nseparated from them: that these fishermen, however, had lost their\r\nancient market; had no other resource within their country to which they\r\ncould turn and they hoped, therefore, they might, in the present moment\r\nof distress, be decoyed over to their establishments, and be added\r\nto the mass of their seamen. To effect this, they offered extravagant\r\nadvantages to all persons who should exercise the whale-fishery from\r\nBritish establishments. But not counting with much confidence on a long\r\nconnection with their remaining possessions on the continent of America,\r\nforeseeing that the _Nantuckois_ would settle in them, preferably, if\r\nput on an equal footing with those of Great Britain, and that thus they\r\nmight have to purchase them a second time, they confined their high\r\noffers to settlers in Great Britain. The _Nantuckois_, left without\r\nresource by the loss of their market, began to think of removing to the\r\nBritish dominions; some to Nova Scotia, preferring smaller advantages in\r\nthe neighborhood of their ancient country and friends; others to Great\r\nBritain, postponing country and friends to high premiums. A vessel was\r\nalready arrived from Halifax to Nantucket, to take off some of those\r\nwho proposed to remove; two families had gone on board, and others\r\nwere going, when a letter was received there, which had been written\r\nby Monsieur le Marquis de la Fayette, to a gentleman in Boston, and\r\ntransmitted by him to Nantucket. The purport of the letter was to\r\ndissuade their accepting the British proposals, and to assure them that\r\ntheir friends in France would endeavor to do something for them. This\r\ninstantly suspended their design: not another went on board, and the\r\nvessel returned to Halifax with only the two families.\r\n\r\nIn fact the French government had not been inattentive to the views\r\nof the British, nor insensible to the crisis. They saw the danger of\r\npermitting five or six thousand of the best seamen existing, to be\r\ntransferred by a single stroke to the marine strength of their\r\nenemy, and to carry over with them an art which they possessed almost\r\nexclusively. The counterplan which they set on foot was to tempt the\r\n_Nantuckois_, by high offers, to come and settle in France. This was in\r\nthe year 1785. The British, however, had in their favor, a sameness of\r\nlanguage, religion, laws, habits, and kindred. Nine families only, of\r\nthirty-three persons in the whole, came to Dunkirk; so that this\r\nproject was not likely to prevent their emigration to the English\r\nestablishments, if nothing else had happened.\r\n\r\nFrance had effectually aided in detaching the United States of America\r\nfrom the force of Great Britain: but as yet they seemed to have indulged\r\nonly a silent wish to detach them from her commerce. They had done\r\nnothing to induce that event. In the same year, 1785, while M. de\r\nCalonne was in treaty with the _Nantuckois_, an estimate of the commerce\r\nof the United States was submitted to the Count de Vergennes, and it\r\nwas shown, that, of three millions of pounds sterling, to which their\r\nexports amounted, one third might be brought to France, and exchanged\r\nagainst her productions and manufactures, advantageously for both\r\nnations; provided the obstacles of prohibition, monopoly, and duty, were\r\neither done away, or moderated as far as circumstances would admit. A\r\ncommittee, which had been appointed to investigate a particular one of\r\nthese objects, was thereupon instructed to extend its researches to\r\nthe whole, and see what advantages and facilities the government could\r\noffer, for the encouragement of a general commerce with the United\r\nStates. The committee was composed of persons well skilled in commerce;\r\nand after laboring assiduously for several months, they made their\r\nreport: the result of which was given in the letter of his Majesty’s\r\nComptroller General, of the 22nd of October, 1786, wherein he stated the\r\nprinciples which should be established, for the future regulation of the\r\ncommerce between France and the United States. It was become tolerably\r\nevident, at the date of this letter, that the terms offered to the\r\n_Nantuckois_ would not produce their emigration to Dunkirk; and that it\r\nwould be safest, in every event, to offer some other alternative, which\r\nmight prevent their acceptance of the British offers. The obvious one\r\nwas, to open the ports of France to their oils, so that they might still\r\nexercise their fishery, remaining in their native country, and find a\r\nnew market for its produce, instead of that which they had lost. The\r\narticle of whale-oil was, accordingly, distinguished in the letter of\r\nM. de Calonne, by an immediate abatement of duty, and promise of further\r\nabatement, after the year 1790. This letter was instantly sent\r\nto America, and bid fair to produce there the effect intended, by\r\ndetermining the fishermen to carry on their trade from their own homes,\r\nwith the advantage only of a free market in France, rather than remove\r\nto Great Britain, where a free market and great bounty were offered\r\nthem. An _Arrêt_ was still to be prepared, to give legal sanction to the\r\nletter of M. de Calonne. Monsieur Lambert, with a patience and assiduity\r\nalmost unexampled, went through all the investigations necessary to\r\nassure himself, that the conclusion of the committee had been just.\r\nFrequent conferences on this subject were held in his presence; the\r\ndeputies of the chambers of commerce were heard, and the result was, the\r\n_Arrêt_ of December the 29th, 1787, confirming the abatements of duty,\r\npresent and future, which the letter of October, 1786, had promised,\r\nand reserving to his Majesty, to grant still further favors to that\r\nproduction, if, on further information, he should find it for the\r\ninterest of the two nations.\r\n\r\nThe English had now begun to deluge the markets of France with their\r\nwhale-oils; and they were enabled by the great premiums given by\r\ntheir government, to undersell the French fisherman, aided by feebler\r\npremiums, and the American, aided by his poverty alone. Nor is it\r\ncertain, that these speculations were not made at the risk of the\r\nBritish government, to suppress the French and American fishermen in\r\ntheir only market. Some remedy seemed necessary. Perhaps it would not\r\nhave been a bad one, to subject, by a general law, the merchandise of\r\nevery nation and of every nature, to pay additional duties in the ports\r\nof France, exactly equal to the premiums and drawbacks given on the same\r\nmerchandise by their own government. This might not only counteract the\r\neffect of premiums in the instance of whale-oils, but attack the whole\r\nBritish system of bounties and drawbacks, by the aid of which they\r\nmake London the centre of commerce for the whole earth. A less general\r\nremedy, but an effectual one, was, to prohibit the oils of all European\r\nnations: the treaty with England requiring only, that she should be\r\ntreated as well as the most favored European nation. But the remedy\r\nadopted was, to prohibit all oils, without exception.\r\n\r\nTo know how this remedy will operate, we must consider the quantity of\r\nwhale-oil which France consumes annually, the quantity she obtains from\r\nher own fishery; and, if she obtains less than she consumes, we are to\r\nconsider what will follow the prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe annual consumption of France, as stated by a person who has good\r\nopportunities of knowing it, is as follows.\r\n\r\n                                     lbs. pesant.    quinteaux.    tons.\r\n\r\nParis, according to the registers of\r\n1786,.................................2,800,000        28,000      1750\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven other cities, lighted\r\nby M.

It is treating these conjectures with great respect,\r\nto place them on an equal footing with the estimate of the person before\r\nalluded to, and to suppose the truth half way between them. But we will\r\ndo it, and call the present consumption of France only sixty thousand\r\nquintals, or three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons a year. This\r\nconsumption is increasing fast, as the practice of lighting cities is\r\nbecoming more general, and the superior advantages of lighting them with\r\nwhale-oil are but now beginning to be known.\r\n\r\nWhat do the fisheries of France furnish? She has employed, this year,\r\nfifteen vessels in the southern, and two in the northern fishery,\r\ncarrying forty-five hundred tons in the whole, or two hundred and\r\nsixty-five each, on an average. The English ships, led by Nantuckois as\r\nwell as the French, have never averaged in the southern fishery, more\r\nthan one fifth of their burthen, in the best year. The fifteen ships\r\nof France, according to this ground of calculation, and supposing the\r\npresent to have been one of the best years, should have brought,\r\none with another, one fifth of two hundred and sixty-five tons, or\r\nfifty-three tons each. But we are told, they have brought near the\r\ndouble of that, to wit, one hundred tons each, and fifteen hundred tons\r\nin the whole. Supposing the two northern vessels to have brought home\r\nthe cargo which is common from the northern fishery, to wit, twenty-five\r\ntons each, the whole produce this year will then be fifteen hundred and\r\nfifty tons. This is five and a half months’provision, or two fifths of\r\nthe annual consumption. To furnish for the whole year, would require\r\nforty ships of the same size, in years as fortunate as the present, and\r\neighty-five, _communibus annis_; forty-four tons, or one sixth of the\r\nburthen, being as high an average as should be counted on, one year\r\nwith another: and the number must be increased, with the increasing\r\nconsumption. France, then, is evidently not yet in a condition to\r\nsupply her own wants. It is said, indeed, she has a large stock on hand,\r\nunsold, occasioned by the English competition. Thirty-three thousand\r\nquintals, including this year’s produce, are spoken of: this is between\r\nsix and seven months’provision; and supposing by the time this is\r\nexhausted that the next year’s supply comes in, that will enable her to\r\ngo on five or six months longer; say a twelvemonth in the whole. But,\r\nat the end of the twelvemonth, what is to be done? The manufacturers\r\ndepending on this article, cannot maintain their competition against\r\nthose of other countries, if deprived of their equal means. When the\r\nalternative, then, shall be presented, of letting them drop, or opening\r\nthe ports to foreign whale-oil, it is presumable the latter will be\r\nadopted, as the lesser evil. But it will be too late for America. Her\r\nfishery, annihilated during the late war, only began to raise its head,\r\non the prospect of a market held out by this country. Crushed by the\r\n_Arrêt_ of September the 28th, in its first feeble effort to revive, it\r\nwill rise no more. Expeditions, which require the expense of the outfit\r\nof vessels, and from nine to twelve months’ navigation, as the southern\r\nfishery does, most frequented by the Americans, cannot be undertaken\r\nin sole reliance on a market, which is opened and shut from one day to\r\nanother, with little or no warning. The English alone, then, will remain\r\nto furnish these supplies, and they must be received, even from them.\r\nWe must accept bread from our enemies, if our friends cannot furnish\r\nit. This comes exactly to the point, to which that government has\r\nbeen looking. She fears no rival in the whale-fishery, but America: or\r\nrather, it is the whale-fishery of America, of which she is endeavoring\r\nto possess herself. It is for this object, she is making the present\r\nextraordinary efforts, by bounties and other encouragements: and her\r\nsuccess, so far, is very flattering. Before the war, she had not one\r\nhundred vessels in the whale-trade, while America employed three hundred\r\nand nine. In 1786, Great Britain employed one hundred and fifty-one\r\nvessels; in 1787, two hundred and eighty-six; in 1788, three hundred\r\nand fourteen, nearly the ancient American number: while the latter has\r\nfallen to about eighty. They have just changed places then; England\r\nhaving gained, exactly what America has lost. France, by her ports and\r\nmarkets, holds the balance between the two contending parties, and gives\r\nthe victory, by opening and shutting them, to which she pleases. We have\r\nstill precious remains of seamen, educated in this fishery, and capable\r\nby their poverty, their boldness, and address, of recovering it from\r\nthe English, in spite of their bounties. But this Arret endangers the\r\ntransferring to Great Britain every man of them, who is not invincibly\r\nattached to his native soil. There is no other nation in present\r\ncondition to maintain a competition with Great Britain in the\r\nwhale-fishery. The expense, at which it is supported on her part, seems\r\nenormous. Two hundred and fifty-five vessels, of seventy-five thousand\r\nfour hundred and thirty-six tons, employed by her, this year, in the\r\nnorthern fishery, at forty-two men each; and fifty-nine in the southern,\r\nat eighteen men each, make eleven thousand seven hundred and seventy-two\r\nmen. These are known to have cost the government fifteen pounds each, or\r\none hundred and seventy-six thousand five hundred and eighty pounds, in\r\nthe whole, and that, to employ the principal part of them from three to\r\nfour months only. The northern ships have brought home twenty, and the\r\nsouthern sixty tons of oil, on an average; making eighty-six hundred\r\nand forty tons. Every ton of oil, then, has cost the government twenty\r\npounds in bounty. Still, if they can beat, us out of the field, and\r\nhave it to themselves, they will think their money well employed. If\r\nFrance undertakes, solely, the competition against them, she must do\r\nit at equal expense. The trade is too poor to support itself. The\r\neighty-five ships, necessary to supply even her present consumption,\r\nbountied, as the English are, will require a sacrifice of twelve hundred\r\nand eighty-five thousand two hundred livres a year, to maintain three\r\nthousand five hundred and seventy seamen, and that, a part of the year\r\nonly; and if she will put it to twelve thousand men, in competition with\r\nEngland, she must sacrifice, as they do, four or five millions a year.\r\nThe same number of men might, with the same bounty, be kept in as\r\nconstant employ, carrying stone from Bayonne to Cherburg, or coal from\r\nNewcastle to Havre, in which navigations they would be always at\r\nhand, and become as good seamen. The English consider among their best\r\nsailors, those employed to carry coal from Newcastle to London. France\r\ncannot expect to raise her fishery, even to the supply of her own\r\nconsumption, in one year, or in several years. Is it not better, then,\r\nby keeping her ports open to the United States, to enable them to aid in\r\nmaintaining the field against the common adversary, till she shall be in\r\ncondition to take it herself, and to supply her own wants? Otherwise her\r\nsupplies must aliment that very force, which is keeping her under. On\r\nour part, we can never be dangerous competitors to France. The extent\r\nto which we can exercise this fishery, is limited to that of the barren\r\nisland of Nantucket, and a few similar barren spots; its duration, to\r\nthe pleasure of this government, as we have no other market. A material\r\nobservation must be added here: sudden vicissitudes of opening and\r\nshutting ports, do little injury to merchants settled on the opposite\r\ncoast, watching for the opening, like the return of a tide, and ready to\r\nenter with it. But they ruin the adventurer, whose distance requires six\r\nmonths’ notice. Those who are now arriving from America, in consequence\r\nof the Arret of December the 29th, will consider it as the false light\r\nwhich has led them to their ruin. They will be apt to say, that they\r\ncome to the ports of France by invitation of that _Arrêt_, that the\r\nsubsequent one of September the 28th, which drives them from those\r\nports, founds itself on a single principle, viz. ‘that the prohibition\r\nof foreign oils is the most useful encouragement which can be given\r\nto that branch of industry.’ They will say, that, if this be a true\r\nprinciple, it was as true on the 29th of December 1787, as on the 20th\r\nof September, 1788: it was then weighed against other motives, judged\r\nweaker and overruled, and it is hard it should be now revived, to ruin\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe refinery for whale-oil, lately established at Rouen, seems to be\r\nan object worthy of national attention. In order to judge of its\r\nimportance, the different qualities of whale-oil must be noted. Three\r\nqualities are known in the American and English markets. 1st. That of\r\nthe spermaceti whale. 2nd. Of the Greenland whale. 3rd. Of the Brazil\r\nwhale. 1. The spermaceti whale found by the _Nantuckois_, in the\r\nneighborhood of the Western Islands, to which they had gone in pursuit\r\nof other whales, retired thence to the coast of Guinea, afterwards to\r\nthat of Brazil, and begins now to be best found in the latitude of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and even of Cape Horn. He is an active, fierce\r\nanimal, and requires vast address and boldness in the fisherman. The\r\ninhabitants of Brazil make little expeditions from their coast, and take\r\nsome of these fish. But the Americans are the only distant people, who\r\nhave been in the habit of seeking and attacking him, in numbers. The\r\nBritish, however, led by the _Nantuckois_, whom they have decoyed into\r\ntheir service, have begun this fishery. In 1785, they had eighteen ships\r\nin it; in 1787, thirty-eight; in 1788, fifty-four, or, as some say,\r\nsixty-four. I have calculated on the middle number, fifty-nine. Still\r\nthey take but a very small proportion of their own demand; we furnish\r\nthe rest. Theirs is the only market to which we carry that oil, because\r\nit is the only one where its properties are known. It is luminous,\r\nresists coagulation by cold, to the forty-first degree of Fahrenheit’s\r\nthermometer, and fourth of Reaumur’s, and yields no smell at all: it is\r\nused, therefore, within doors, to lighten shops, and even in the richest\r\nhouses, for antichambers, stairs, galleries, &c. It sells at the London\r\nmarket for treble the price of common whale-oil. This enables the\r\nadventurer to pay the duty of eighteen pounds five shillings sterling\r\nthe ton, and still to have a living profit. Besides the mass of oil\r\nproduced from the whole body of the whale, his head yields three or\r\nfour barrels of what is called head-matter, from which is made the solid\r\nspermaceti, used for medicine and candles. This sells by the pound at\r\ndouble the price of the oil. The disadvantage of this fishery is, that\r\nthe sailors are from nine to twelve months absent on the voyage; of\r\ncourse, they are not at hand on any sudden emergency, and are even\r\nliable to be taken, before they know that war is begun. It must be\r\nadded, on the subject of this whale, that he is rare and shy, soon\r\nabandoning the grounds where he is hunted. This fishery, less losing\r\nthan the other, and often profitable, will occasion it to be so\r\nthronged, soon, as to bring it on a level with the other. It will then\r\nrequire the same expensive support, or to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n2. The Greenland whale-oil is next in quality. It resists coagulation\r\nby cold, to thirty-six degrees of Fahrenheit, and two of Reaumur, but it\r\nhas a smell insupportable within doors, and is not luminous. It sells,\r\ntherefore, in London, at about sixteen pounds the ton. This whale is\r\nclumsy and timid; he dives when struck, and comes up to breathe by the\r\nfirst cake of ice, where the fishermen need little address or courage\r\nto find and take him. This is the fishery mostly frequented by European\r\nnations; it is this fish which yields the fin in quantity, and the\r\nvoyages last about three or four months.\r\n\r\nThe third quality is that of the small Brazil whale. He was originally\r\nfound on the coast of Nantucket, and first led that people to this\r\npursuit: he retired, first to the Banks of Newfoundland, then to the\r\nWestern Islands, and is now found within soundings on the coast of\r\nBrazil, during the months of December, January, February, and March. His\r\noil chills at fifty-two degrees of Fahrenheit, and eight of Reaumur, is\r\nblack and offensive; worth, therefore, but thirteen pounds the ton,\r\nin London. In warm summer nights, however, it burns better than the\r\nGreenland oil.\r\n\r\nTo the qualities of the oils thus described, it is to be added, that an\r\nindividual has discovered methods, 1. of converting a great part of\r\nthe oils of the spermaceti-whale, into the solid substance called\r\nspermaceti, heretofore produced from his head alone; 2. of refining\r\nthe Greenland whale-oil, so as to take from it all smell, and render it\r\nlimpid and luminous as that of the spermaceti-whale; 3. of curdling\r\nthe oil of the Brazil whale into tallow, resembling that of beef, and\r\nanswering all its purposes. This person is engaged by the company, which\r\nhas established the refinery at Rouen: their works will cost them half a\r\nmillion of livres; will be able to refine all the oil which can be used\r\nin the kingdom, and even to supply foreign markets. The effects of the\r\nrefinery, then, would be, 1. to supplant the solid spermaceti of all\r\nother nations, by theirs, of equal quality and lower price; 2. to\r\nsubstitute, instead of spermaceti-oil, their black whale-oil refined,\r\nof equal quality and lower price; 3. to render the worthless oil of the\r\nBrazil, equal in value to tallow; and 4. by accommodating these oils to\r\nuses, to which they could never otherwise have been applied, they will\r\nextend the demand beyond its present narrow limits, to any supply which\r\ncan be furnished, and thus give the most effectual encouragement and\r\nextension to the whale-fishery. But these works were calculated on the\r\n_Arrêt_ of December the 29th, which admitted here, freely and fully,\r\nthe produce of the American fishery. If confined to that of the French\r\nfishery alone, the enterprise may fail, for want of matter to work on.\r\n\r\nAfter this review of the whale-fishery as a political institution, a few\r\nconsiderations shall be added on its produce, as a basis of commercial\r\nexchange between France and the United States. The discussions it has\r\nundergone, on former occasions, in this point of view, leaves little new\r\nto be now urged.\r\n\r\nThe United States, not possessing mines of the precious metals, can\r\npurchase necessaries from other nations, so far only as their produce is\r\nreceived in exchange. Without enumerating our smaller articles, we have\r\nthree of principal importance, proper for the French market; to wit,\r\ntobacco, whale-oil, and rice. The first and most important, is tobacco.\r\nThis might furnish an exchange for eight millions of the productions of\r\nthis country; but it is under a monopoly, and that not of a mercantile,\r\nbut of a financiering company, whose interest is, to pay in money\r\nand not in merchandise, and who are so much governed by the spirit of\r\nsimplifying their purchases and proceedings, that they find means to\r\nelude every endeavor on the part of government, to make them diffuse\r\ntheir purchases among the merchants in general. Little profit is\r\nderived from this, then, as an article of exchange for the produce and\r\nmanufactures of France. Whale-oil might be next in importance; but\r\nthat is now prohibited. American rice is not yet of great, but it is of\r\ngrowing consumption in France, and being the only article of the three\r\nwhich is free, it may become a principal basis of exchange. Time and\r\ntrial may add a fourth, that is, timber. But some essays, rendered\r\nunsuccessful by unfortunate circumstances, place that, at present, under\r\na discredit, which it will be found hereafter not to have merited. The\r\nEnglish know its value, and were supplied with it, before the war. A\r\nspirit of hostility, since that event, led them to seek Russian rather\r\nthan American supplies; a new spirit of hostility has driven them back\r\nfrom Russia, and they are now making contracts for American timber.\r\nBut of the three articles before mentioned, proved by experience to be\r\nsuitable for the French market, one is prohibited, one under monopoly,\r\nand one alone free, and that the smallest and of very limited\r\nconsumption. The way to encourage purchasers, is, to multiply their\r\nmeans of payment. Whale-oil might be an important one. In one scale, are\r\nthe interests of the millions who are lighted, shod, or clothed with the\r\nhelp of it, and the thousands of laborers and manufacturers, who would\r\nbe employed in producing the articles which might be given in exchange\r\nfor it, if received from America: in the other scale, are the\r\ninterests of the adventurers in the whale-fishery each of whom, indeed,\r\npolitically considered, may be of more importance to the State, than\r\na simple laborer or manufacturer; but to make the estimate with the\r\naccuracy it merits, we should multiply the numbers in each scale into\r\ntheir individual importance, and see which preponderates.\r\n\r\nBoth governments have seen with concern, that their commercial\r\nintercourse does not grow as rapidly as they would wish. The system\r\nof the United States is, to use neither prohibitions nor premiums.\r\nCommerce, there, regulates itself freely, and asks nothing better.\r\nWhere a government finds itself under the necessity of undertaking that\r\nregulation, it would seem, that it should conduct it as an intelligent\r\nmerchant would; that is to say, invite customers to purchase, by\r\nfacilitating their means of payment, and by adapting goods to their\r\ntaste. If this idea be just, government here has two operations to\r\nattend to, with respect to the commerce of the United States; 1. to\r\ndo away, or to moderate, as much as possible, the prohibitions\r\nand monopolies of their materials for payment; 2. to encourage the\r\ninstitution of the principal manufactures, which the necessities, or the\r\nhabits of their new customers call for. Under this latter head, a hint\r\nshall be suggested, which must find its apology in the motive from which\r\nit flows; that is, a desire of promoting mutual interests and close\r\nfriendship. Six hundred thousand of the laboring poor of America,\r\ncomprehending slaves under that denomination, are clothed in three\r\nof the simplest manufactures possible; to wit, oznaburgs, plains,\r\nand duffel blankets. The first is a linen; the two last, woollens. It\r\nhappens, too, that they are used exactly by those who cultivate\r\nthe tobacco and rice, and in a good degree by those employed in the\r\nwhale-fishery. To these manufactures they are so habituated, that no\r\nsubstitute will be received. If the vessels which bring tobacco, rice,\r\nand whale-oil, do not find them in the ports of delivery, they must be\r\nsought where they can be found; that is, in England, at present. If they\r\nwere made in France, they would be gladly taken in exchange there. The\r\nquantities annually used by this description of people, and their value,\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n     Oznaburgs 2,700,000 aunes, at sixteen sous the aune, worth\r\n          2,160,000\r\n\r\n     Plains    1,350,000 aunes, at two livres the aune,\r\n          2,700,000\r\n\r\n     Duffel Blankets 300,000 aunes, at seven and 4/5ths livres each\r\n          2,160,000\r\n         ----------\r\n          7,020,000\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say, how much should be added, for the\r\nconsumption of inhabitants of other descriptions; a great deal surely.\r\nBut the present view shall be confined to the one description named.\r\nSeven millions of livres, are nine millions of days’ work, of those who\r\nraise, spin, and weave the wool and flax; and, at three hundred working\r\ndays to the year, would maintain thirty thousand people. To introduce\r\nthese simple manufactures, suppose government to give five per cent, on\r\nthe value of what should be exported of them, for ten years to come: if\r\nnone should be exported, nothing would be to be paid: but on the other\r\nhand, if the manufactures, with this encouragement, should rise to\r\nthe full demand, it will be a sacrifice of three hundred and fifty-one\r\nthousand livres a year, for ten years only, to produce a perpetual\r\nsubsistence for more than thirty thousand people (for the demand will\r\ngrow with our population); while she must expend perpetually one million\r\ntwo hundred and eighty-five thousand livres a year, to maintain the\r\nthree thousand five hundred and seventy seamen, who would supply her\r\nwith whale-oil. That is to say, for each seaman, as much as for thirty\r\nlaborers and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our subject, and to conclude.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, we consider the _Arrêt_ of September the 28th, in a\r\npolitical or a commercial light, it would seem, that the United States\r\nshould be excepted from its operation. Still more so, when they invoke\r\nagainst it the amity subsisting between the two nations, the desire of\r\nbinding them together by every possible interest and connection, the\r\nseveral acts in favor of this exception, the dignity of legislation,\r\nwhich admits not of changes backwards and forwards, the interests of\r\ncommerce, which requires steady regulations, the assurances of the\r\nfriendly motives which have led the King to pass these acts, and the\r\nhope, that no cause will arise, to change either his motives or his\r\nmeasures towards us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXI.--TO JOHN JAY, November 29, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, November 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn the hurry of making up my letter of the 19th instant, I omitted the\r\nenclosed printed paper, on the subject of whale-oil. That omission\r\nis now supplied by another conveyance, by the way of London. The\r\nexplanatory _Arrêt_ is not yet come out. I still take for granted, it\r\nwill pass, though there be an opposition to it in the Council. In the\r\nmean time, orders are given to receive our oils which may arrive. The\r\napprehension of a want of corn has induced them to turn their eyes to\r\nforeign supplies; and to show their preference of receiving them from\r\nus, they have passed the enclosed _Arrêt_, giving a premium on wheat\r\nand flour from the United States, for a limited time. This, you will\r\ndoubtless think proper to have translated and published. The _Notables_\r\nare still in session: the votes of the separate bureaux have not yet\r\nbeen reduced to a joint act, in an assembly of the whole. I see no\r\nreason to suppose they will change the separate votes relative to the\r\nrepresentation of the _Tiers Etat_ in the States General. In the mean\r\ntime, the stream of public indignation, heretofore directed against the\r\ncourt, sets strongly against the _Notables_. It is not yet decided when\r\nthe States will meet: but certainly they cannot, till February or March.\r\nThe Turks have retired across the Danube. This movement indicates their\r\ngoing into winter-quarters, and the severity of the weather must hasten\r\nit. The thermometer was yesterday at eight degrees of Fahrenheit, that\r\nis, twenty-four degrees below freezing; a degree of cold equal to that\r\nof the year 1740, which they count here among their coldest winters.\r\nThis having continued many days, and being still likely to continue, and\r\nthe wind from northeast, render it probable, that all enterprise must be\r\nsuspended between the three great belligerent powers. Poland is\r\nlikely to be thrown into great convulsions. The Empress of Russia has\r\nperemptorily demanded such aids from Poland, as might engage it in the\r\nwar. The King of Prussia, on the other hand, threatens to march an army\r\non their borders. The vote of the Polish confederacy for one hundred\r\nthousand men, was a coalition of the two parties, in that single act\r\nonly. The party opposed to the King, have obtained a majority, and have\r\nvoted that this army shall be independent of him. They are supported by\r\nPrussia, while the King depends on Russia. Authentic information from\r\nEngland leaves not a doubt, that the King is lunatic; and that, instead\r\nof the effect, is the cause of the illness, under which he has been so\r\nnear dying. I mention this, because the English newspapers, speaking by\r\nguess on that as they do on all other subjects, might mislead you as to\r\nhis true situation; or rather, might mislead others, who know less\r\nthan you do, that a thing is not rendered the more probable, by being\r\nmentioned in those papers.\r\n\r\nI enclose those of Leyden to the present date, with the gazettes of\r\nFrance, and have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect\r\nesteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, CLXXII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, December 4, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, December 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of August the 31st came to hand yesterday; and a confidential\r\nconveyance offering, by the way of London, I avail myself of it, to\r\nacknowledge the receipt.\r\n\r\nI have seen, with infinite pleasure, our new constitution accepted by\r\neleven States, not rejected by the twelfth; and that the thirteenth\r\nhappens to be a state of the least importance. It is true, that the\r\nminorities in most of the accepting States have been very respectable;\r\nso much so, as to render it prudent, were it not otherwise reasonable,\r\nto make some sacrifice to them. I am in hopes, that the annexation of\r\na bill of rights to the constitution will alone draw over so great\r\na proportion of the minorities, as to leave little danger in the\r\nopposition of the residue; and that this annexation may be made by\r\nCongress and the Assemblies, without calling a convention, which\r\nmight endanger the most valuable parts of the system. Calculation has\r\nconvinced me, that circumstances may arise, and probably will arise,\r\nwherein all the resources of taxation will be necessary for the safety\r\nof the State. For though I am decidedly of opinion, we should take no\r\npart in European quarrels, but cultivate peace and commerce with all,\r\nyet who can avoid seeing the source of war in the tyranny of those\r\nnations, who deprive us of the natural right of trading with our\r\nneighbors? The produce of the United States will soon exceed the\r\nEuropean demand: what is to be done with the surplus, when there shall\r\nbe one? It will be employed, without question, to open, by force, a\r\nmarket for itself, with those placed on the same continent with us,\r\nand who wish nothing better. Other causes, too, are obvious, which\r\nmay involve us in war; and war requires every resource of taxation and\r\ncredit. The power of making war often prevents it, and in our case,\r\nwould give efficacy to our desire of peace. If the new government wears\r\nthe front which I hope it will, I see no impossibility in the availing\r\nourselves of the wars of others, to open the other parts of America to\r\nour commerce, as the price of our neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe campaign between the Turks and two Empires has been clearly in favor\r\nof the former. The Emperor is secretly trying to bring about a peace.\r\nThe alliance between England, Prussia, and Holland, (and some suspect\r\nSweden also) renders their mediation decisive, wherever it is proposed.\r\nThey seemed to interpose it so magisterially between Denmark and Sweden,\r\nthat the former submitted to its dictates, and there was all reason\r\nto believe, that the war in the northwestern parts of Europe would be,\r\nquieted. All of a sudden, a new flame bursts out in Poland. The King and\r\nhis party are devoted to Russia. The opposition rely on the protection\r\nof Prussia. They have lately become the majority in the confederated\r\ndiet, and have passed a vote for subjecting their army to a commission\r\nindependent of the King, and propose a perpetual diet, in which case\r\nhe will be a perpetual cipher. Russia declares against such a change\r\nin their constitution, and Prussia has put an army into readiness, for\r\nmarching, at a moment’s warning, on the frontier of Poland. These events\r\nare too recent, to see, as yet, what turn they will take, or what effect\r\nthey will have on the peace of Europe. So is that also, of the lunacy\r\nof the King of England, which is a decided fact, notwithstanding all the\r\nstuff the English papers publish, about his fevers, his deliriums, &c.\r\nThe truth is, that the lunacy declared itself almost at once, and with\r\nas few concomitant complaints, as usually attend the first developement\r\nof that disorder. I suppose a regency will be established, and if it\r\nconsists of a plurality of members, it will, probably, be peaceable. In\r\nthis event, it will much favor the present wishes of this country,\r\nwhich are so decidedly for peace, that they refused to enter into the\r\nmediation between Sweden and Russia, lest it should commit them. As soon\r\nas the convocation of the States General was announced, a tranquillity\r\ntook place through the whole kingdom: happily, no open rupture had\r\ntaken place, in any part of it. The parliament were re-instated in their\r\nfunctions, at the same time. This was all they desired; and they had\r\ncalled for the States General, only through fear that the crown could\r\nnot otherwise be forced to re-instate them. Their end obtained, they\r\nbegan to foresee danger to themselves, in the States General. They began\r\nto lay the foundation for caviling at the legality of that body, if its\r\nmeasures should be hostile to them. The court, to clear itself of the\r\ndispute, convened the _Notables_, who had acted with general approbation\r\non the former occasion, and referred to them the forms of calling and\r\norganizing the States General. These _Notables_ consist principally\r\nof Nobility and Clergy; the few of the _Tiers Etat_ among them, being\r\neither parliament men, or other privileged persons. The court wished,\r\nthat, in the future States General, the members of the _Tiers Etat_\r\nshould equal those of both the other orders, and that they should form\r\nbut one House, all together, and vote by persons, not by orders. But the\r\n_Notables_, in the true spirit of Priests and Nobles, combining together\r\nagainst the people, have voted, by five bureaux out of six, that the\r\npeople, or _Tiers Etat_, shall have no greater number of deputies, than\r\neach of the other orders separately, and that they shall vote by orders:\r\nso that two orders concurring in a vote, the third will be overruled;\r\nfor it is not here as in England, where each of the three branches has\r\na negative on the other two. If this project of theirs succeeds, a\r\ncombination between the two Houses of Clergy and Nobles will render the\r\nrepresentation of the _Tiers Etat_ merely nugatory. The bureaux are to\r\nassemble together, to consolidate their separate votes: but I see no\r\nreasonable hope of their changing this. Perhaps the King, knowing that\r\nhe may count on the support of the nation, and attach it more closely to\r\nhim, may take on himself to disregard the opinion of the _Notables_ in\r\nthis instance, and may call an equal representation of the people, in\r\nwhich precedents will support him. In every event, I think the present\r\ndisquiet will end well. The nation has been awaked by our Revolution;\r\nthey feel their strength, they are enlightened, their lights are\r\nspreading, and they will not retrograde. The first States General may\r\nestablish three important points, without opposition from the court; 1.\r\ntheir own periodical convocation; 2. their exclusive right of taxation\r\n(which has been confessed by the King); 3. the right of registering\r\nlaws, and of previously proposing amendments to them, as the parliaments\r\nhave, by usurpation, been in the habit of doing. The court will consent\r\nto this, from its hatred to the parliaments, and from the desire of\r\nhaving to do with one, rather than many legislatures. If the States are\r\nprudent, they will not aim at more than this at first, lest they should\r\nshock the dispositions of the court, and even alarm the public\r\nmind, which must be left to open itself, by degrees, to successive\r\nimprovements. These will follow, from the nature of things: how far they\r\ncan proceed, in the end, towards a thorough reformation of abuse, cannot\r\nbe foreseen. In my opinion, a kind of influence, which none of their\r\nplans of reform take into account, will elude them all; I mean the\r\ninfluence of women in the government. The manners of the nation allow\r\nthem to visit, alone, all persons in office, to solicit the affairs of\r\nthe husband, family, or friends, and their solicitations bid defiance\r\nto laws and regulations. This obstacle may seem less to those, who, like\r\nour countrymen, are in the precious habit of considering right, as\r\na barrier against all solicitation. Nor can such an one, without the\r\nevidence of his own eyes, believe in the desperate state to which things\r\nare reduced in this country, from the omnipotence of an influence,\r\nwhich, fortunately for the happiness of the sex itself, does not\r\nendeavor to extend itself, in our country, beyond the domestic line.\r\n\r\nYour communications to the Count de Moustier, whatever they may have\r\nbeen, cannot have done injury to my endeavors here, to open the West\r\nIndies to us. On this head, the ministers are invincibly mute, though I\r\nhave often tried to draw them into the subject. I have therefore found\r\nit necessary to let it lie, till war, or other circumstances, may force\r\nit on. Whenever they are in war with England, they must open the islands\r\nto us, and perhaps, during that war, they may see some price which might\r\nmake them agree to keep them always open. In the mean time, I have laid\r\nmy shoulder to the opening the markets of this country to our produce,\r\nand rendering its transportation a nursery for our seamen. A maritime\r\nforce is the only one, by which we can act on Europe. Our navigation law\r\n(if it be wise to have any) should be the reverse of that of England.\r\nInstead of confining importations to home-bottoms, or those of\r\nthe producing nation, I think we should confine exportations to\r\nhome-bottoms, or to those of nations having treaties with us. Our\r\nexportations are heavy, and would nourish a great force of our own,\r\nor be a tempting price to the nation to whom we should offer a\r\nparticipation of it, in exchange for free access to all their\r\npossessions. This is an object to which our government alone is\r\nadequate, in the gross; but I have ventured to pursue it here, so far as\r\nthe consumption of our productions by this country extends. Thus, in\r\nour arrangements relative to tobacco, none can be received here, but\r\nin French or American bottoms. This is employment for near two thousand\r\nseamen, and puts nearly that number of British out of employ. By the\r\n_Arrêt_ of December, 1787, it was provided, that our whale-oils should\r\nnot be received here, but in French or American bottoms; and by later\r\nregulations, all oils, but those of France and America, are excluded.\r\nThis will put one hundred English whale vessels immediately out of\r\nemploy, and one hundred and fifty ere long; and call so many of French\r\nand American into service. We have had six thousand seamen formerly\r\nin this business, the whole of whom we have been likely to lose.\r\nThe consumption of rice is growing fast in this country, and that of\r\nCarolina gaining ground on every other kind. I am of opinion, the whole\r\nof the Carolina rice can be consumed here. Its transportation employs\r\ntwo thousand five hundred sailors, almost all of them English at\r\npresent; the rice being deposited at Cowes, and brought from thence\r\nhere. It would be dangerous to confine this transportation to French and\r\nAmerican bottoms, the ensuing year, because they will be much engrossed\r\nby the transportation of wheat and flour hither, and the crop of rice\r\nmight lie on hand for want of vessels; but I see no objections to the\r\nextension of our principle to this article also, beginning with the year\r\n1790. However, before there is a necessity of deciding on this, I hope\r\nto be able to consult our new government in person, as I have asked of\r\nCongress a leave of absence for six months, that is to say, from April\r\nto November next. It is necessary for me to pay a short visit to my\r\nnative country, first, to reconduct my family thither, and place them\r\nin the hands of their friends, and secondly, to place my private affairs\r\nunder certain arrangements. When I left my own house, I expected to be\r\nabsent but five months, and I have been led by events to an absence\r\nof five years. I shall hope, therefore, for the pleasure of personal\r\nconferences with your Excellency, on the subject of this letter, and\r\nothers interesting to our country; of getting my own ideas set to rights\r\nby a communication of yours, and of taking again the tone of sentiment\r\nof my own country, which we lose in some degree, after a certain\r\nabsence. You know, doubtless, of the death of the Marquis de Chastellux.\r\nThe Marquis de la Fayette is out of favor with the court, but high in\r\nfavor with the nation. I once feared for his personal liberty, but I\r\nhope he is on safe ground at present.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the whale-fishery, I enclose you some observations I\r\ndrew up for the ministry here, in order to obtain a correction of their\r\n_Arrêt_ of September last, whereby they had involved our oils with the\r\nEnglish, in a general exclusion from their ports. They will accordingly\r\ncorrect this, so that our oils will participate with theirs, in the\r\nmonopoly of their markets. There are several things incidentally\r\nintroduced, which do not seem pertinent to the general question: they\r\nwere rendered necessary by particular circumstances, the explanation\r\nof which would add to a letter already too long. I will trespass no\r\nfurther, than to assure you of the sentiments of sincere attachment\r\nand respect, with which I have the honor to be your Excellency’s most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. The observations enclosed, though printed, have been put into\r\nconfidential hands only. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, December 5, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, December 5, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of writing to you on the 2nd of August, and of adding\r\na Postscript of August the 6th.\r\n\r\nYou recollect well the _Arrêt_ of December the 29th, 1787, in favor of\r\nour commerce, and which, among other things, gave free admission to our\r\nwhale-oil, under a duty of about two louis a ton. In consequence of the\r\nEnglish treaty, their oils flowed in, and over-stocked the market. The\r\nlight duty they were liable to under the treaty, still lessened by false\r\nestimates and aided by the high premiums of the British government,\r\nenabled them to undersell the French and American oils. This produced an\r\noutcry of the Dunkirk fishery. It was proposed to exclude all European\r\noils, which would not infringe the British treaty. I could not but\r\nencourage this idea, because it would give to the French and American\r\nfisheries a monopoly of the French market. The _Arrêt_ was so drawn\r\nup; but, in the very moment of passing it, they struck out the word\r\nEuropean, so that our oils became involved. This, I believe, was the\r\neffect of a single person in the ministry. As soon as it was known to\r\nme, I wrote to Monsieur de Montmorin, and had conferences with him and\r\nthe other ministers. I found it necessary to give them information on\r\nthe subject of the whale-fishery, of which they knew little but from the\r\npartial information of their Dunkirk adventurers. I therefore wrote the\r\nobservations (of which I enclose you a printed copy), had them printed\r\nto entice them to read them, and particularly developed the expense at\r\nwhich they are carrying on that fishery, and at which they must continue\r\nit, if they do continue it. This part was more particularly intended for\r\nMr. Necker, who was quite a stranger to the subject, who has principles\r\nof economy, and will enter into calculations. Other subjects are\r\nincidentally introduced; though little connected with the main question,\r\nthey had been called for by other circumstances. An immediate order was\r\ngiven for the present admission of our oils, till they could form\r\nan _Arrêt_; and, at a conference, the draught of an _Arrêt_ was\r\ncommunicated to me, which re-established that of December the 29th. They\r\nexpressed fears, that, under cover of our name, the Nova Scotia oils\r\nwould be introduced; and a blank was left in the draught for the means\r\nof preventing that. They have since proposed, that the certificate of\r\ntheir consul shall accompany the oils, to authorize their admission,\r\nand this is what they will probably adopt. It was observed, that if our\r\nStates would prohibit all foreign oils from being imported into them, it\r\nwould be a great safeguard, and an encouragement to them to continue the\r\nadmission. Still there remains an expression in the _Arrêt_, that it is\r\nprovisory only. However, we must be contented with it as it is; my\r\nhope being, that the legislature will be transferred to the National\r\nAssembly, in whose hands it will be more stable, and with whom it will\r\nbe more difficult to obtain a repeal, should the ministry hereafter\r\ndesire it. If they could succeed in drawing over as many of our\r\nNantucket men as would supply their demands of oil, we might then fear\r\nan exclusion; but the present _Arrêt_, as soon as it shall be passed,\r\nwill, I hope, place us in safety till that event, and that event may\r\nnever happen. I have entered into all these details, that you may be\r\nenabled to quiet the alarm which must have been raised by the _Arrêt_\r\nof September the 28th, and assure the adventurers that they may pursue\r\ntheir enterprises as safely as if that had never been passed, and more\r\nprofitably, because we participate now of a monopolized, instead of an\r\nopen market. The enclosed observations, though printed, have only been\r\ngiven to the ministers, and one or two other confidential persons. You\r\nwill see that they contain matter which should be kept from the English,\r\nand will therefore trust them to the perusal only of such persons as you\r\ncan confide in. We are greatly indebted to the Marquis de la Fayette\r\nfor his aid on this, as on every other occasion. He has paid the closest\r\nattention to it, and combated for us with the zeal of a native.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of reconducting my family to America, and of placing my\r\naffairs there under permanent arrangements, has obliged me to ask of\r\nCongress a six months’ absence, to wit, from April to November next.\r\nI hope, therefore, to have the pleasure of seeing you there, and\r\nparticularly, that it will be at New York that I shall find you. Be so\r\ngood as to present my sincere esteem to Mrs. Adams, and believe me\r\nto be, with very affectionate attachment, Dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIV.--TO MR. SHORT, December 8, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\nParis, December 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 21st of November, addressed to Milan, _poste\r\nrestante_, according to the desire expressed through Mrs. Paradise.\r\nI have lately received yours of the 19th of November, and sincerely\r\nfelicitate you on your recovery. I wish you may have suffered this to be\r\nsufficiently established before you set out on your journey. The present\r\nletter will probably reach you amidst the classical enjoyments of\r\nRome. I feel myself kindle at the reflection, to make that journey; but\r\ncircumstances will oblige me to postpone it at least. We are here\r\nunder a most extraordinary degree of cold. The thermometer has been ten\r\ndegrees of Reaumur below freezing: this is eight degrees of Fahrenheit\r\nabove zero, and was the degree of cold here in the year 1740. The long\r\ncontinuance of this severity, and the snow now on the ground, give\r\nphysical prognostications of a hard winter. You will be in a privileged\r\nclimate, and will have had an enviable escape from this. The _Notables_\r\nare not yet separated, nor is their treasonable vote against the people\r\nyet consolidated; but it will be. The parliament have taken up the\r\nsubject, and passed a very laudable vote in opposition. They have made\r\nit the occasion of giving sketches of what should be a bill of rights.\r\nPerhaps this opposition of authority may give the court an option\r\nbetween the two. Stocks are rising slowly, but steadily. The loan of\r\n1784 is at thirteen loss; the _caisse d’escompte_, four thousand and\r\nseventy-five. The Count de Bryenne has retired, and M. de Puysegur\r\nsucceeded to his place. Madame de Chambonois (sister of M. de Langear)\r\nis dead of the small-pox. Pio is likely to receive a good appointment in\r\nhis own country, which will take him from us. Corn is likely to become\r\nextremely scarce in France, Spain, and England. This country has offered\r\na premium of forty sous the quintal on flour of the United States,\r\nand thirty sous the quintal on our wheat, to be brought here between\r\nFebruary and June.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington writes me, that industry and economy begin to take\r\nplace of that idleness and extravagance which had succeeded the close\r\nof the war. The Potomac canal is in great forwardness. J. M. writes me\r\nword, that Mr. Jay and General Knox are talked of in the Middle States\r\nfor Vice-Presidents, but he queries whether both will not prefer their\r\npresent births. It seems agreed, that some emendations will be made to\r\nthe new constitution. All are willing to add a bill of rights; but they\r\nfear the power of internal taxation will be abridged. The friends of\r\nthe new government will oppose the method of amendment by a federal\r\nconvention, which would subject the whole instrument to change, and they\r\nwill support the other method, which admits Congress, by a vote of two\r\nthirds, to submit specific changes to the Assemblies, three fourths of\r\nwhom must concur to establish them.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter is from Pallegrino, one of the Italian laborers\r\nestablished in our neighborhood. I fancy it contains one for his father.\r\nI have supposed it would not be unpleasant to you to have the delivery\r\nof it, as it may give you a good opportunity of conferring with one of\r\nthat class as much as you please. I obey at the same time my own wishes\r\nto oblige the writer. Mazzei is at this time ill, but not in danger. I\r\nam impatient to receive further letters from you, which may assure me of\r\nthe solidity of your recovery, being, with great anxiety for your health\r\nand happiness, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The annexed is here inserted in the Author’s MS. To whom\r\n     addressed, does not appear.]\r\n\r\nThe Minister Plenipotentiary for the United States of America finds\r\nhimself under the necessity of declining to authenticate writings\r\ndestined to be sent to the United States, for this main reason, that\r\nsuch authentication is not legal evidence there. After a reason so\r\nsufficient, it seems superfluous to add, that, were his authentication\r\nadmissible in the courts of the United States, he could never give it to\r\nany seal or signature, which had not been put in his presence; that he\r\ncould never certify a copy, unless both that and the original were in a\r\nhand-writing legible to him, and had been compared together by him,\r\nword by word: that so numerous are the writings presented, that their\r\nauthentication alone would occupy the greater part of his time, and,\r\nwithdrawing him from his proper duties, would change the nature of his\r\noffice to that of a notary. He observes to those who do him the honor\r\nof addressing themselves to him on this subject, that the laws for the\r\nauthentication of foreign writings are not the same through all the\r\nUnited States, some requiring an authentication under the seal of the\r\n_Prevoté_ of a city, and others admitting that of a Notary: but that\r\nwritings authenticated in both these manners, will, under the one or the\r\nother, be admitted in most, if not all of the United States. It would\r\nseem advisable, then, to furnish them with this double authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXV.--TO DOCTOR GILMER, December 16, 1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR GILMER.\r\n\r\nPaife, December 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Doctor,\r\n\r\nYour last letter of December the 23rd was unlucky, like the former one,\r\nin arriving while I was absent on a call of public business in Holland.\r\nI was discouraged from answering the law part of it on my return,\r\nbecause I foresaw such a length of time between the date of that and\r\nreceipt of the answer, as would give it the air of a prescription after\r\nthe death of the patient. I hope the whole affair is settled, and that\r\nyou are established in good titles to all the lands. Still, however,\r\nbeing on the subject, I cannot help adding a word, in answer to the\r\nobjection which you say is raised on the words ‘the estate,’ instead of\r\n‘my estate.’ It has long been confessed in the courts, that the\r\nfirst decision, that a devise of lands to a person without words\r\nof inheritance, should carry an estate for life only, was an absurd\r\ndecision, founded on feudal principles, after feudal ideas had long been\r\nlost by the unlettered writers of their own wills: and it has often been\r\nsaid, that were the matter to begin again, it should be decided that\r\nsuch a devise should carry a fee simple, as every body is sensible\r\ntestators intend, by these expressions. The courts, therefore,\r\ncircumscribe the authority of this chain of decisions, all hanging on\r\nthe first link, as much as possible; and they avail themselves of every\r\npossible circumstance which may render any new case unlike the old one,\r\nand authorize them to conform their judgments to common sense, and the\r\nwill of the testator. Hence they decide, that in a devise of ‘my estate\r\nat M.’ to such a one, without words of inheritance, the word estate is\r\ndescriptive of the duration of the interest bequeathed, as well as its\r\nlocality. From the same desire of getting back into the paths of common\r\nsense, they would not suffer the particle ‘the’ instead of ‘my’, to make\r\na difference. ‘My estate at M.’ means not only my lands at M., but my\r\nfee simple in them. ‘The estate at M.’ means not only ‘the lands the\r\ntestator holds at M., but the fee simple he has in them.’ Another\r\nobjection will be made, perhaps, viz. that the testator devises in\r\nthe same clause his estate called Marrow-bone, his tract called\r\nHorse-pasture, and his tract called Poison-field; that it is probable he\r\nintended to give the same interest in all; and as it is confessed that\r\nthe word tract conveys but an estate for life, we must conclude that the\r\nword estate was meant to convey the same. I should reverse the argument,\r\nand say, as it confessed the word estate, conveys an estate in fee\r\nsimple, we must conclude the word tract was meant to convey the same;\r\nthat this conclusion coincides with the wishes of the courts, as\r\nbringing them back to what is right and consentaneous to the intention\r\nof the testator, as furnishing them a circumstance to distinguish the\r\ncase from the original one, and withdraw it from its authority; whereas,\r\nthe contrary conclusion tends to lead them further from the meaning of\r\ntestators, and to fix them in error.\r\n\r\nBut I perceive that my wishes to see the weight of no objection where\r\nyou are interested, are leading me to write an argument, where I had\r\npromised I would say only a word. I will, therefore, talk the subject\r\nover with you at Monticello, or Pen-park. I have asked of Congress a\r\nleave of five or six months’ absence next year, that I may carry my\r\ndaughters home, and assist in the arrangement of my affairs. I shall\r\npass two of the months at Monticello, that is to say, either June and\r\nJuly, or July and August, according to the time I may sail, which I hope\r\nwill be in April: and then go on to New York and Boston, from whence I\r\nshall embark again for Europe, so as to get here before the winter sets\r\nin. I look forward with great fondness to the moment, when I can again\r\nsee my own country and my own neighbors, and endeavor to anticipate as\r\nlittle as possible the pain of another separation from them. I hope\r\nI shall find you all under the peaceable establishment of the new\r\nconstitution, which, as far as I can judge from public papers, seems to\r\nhave become necessary for the happiness of our country. I thank you for\r\nyour kind inquiries about my wrist. I followed advice with it, till I\r\nsaw, visibly, that the joint had never been replaced, and that it was\r\nabsurd to expect that cataplasms and waters would reduce dislocated\r\nbones. From that moment I have done nothing. I have for ever lost the\r\nuse of my hand, except that I can write: and a withered hand and swelled\r\nand crooked fingers, still remaining twenty-seven months after the\r\naccident, make me fear I do not yet know the worst of it. But this, too,\r\nwe will talk over at Monticello, and endeavor that it be the only pain\r\nto which our attention may be recalled. Adieu, my dear friend. Kiss and\r\nbless every body for me, Mrs. Gilmer especially. Assure her and\r\nyourself of the sincere and constant attachment of, Dear Doctor, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVI.--TO THOMAS PAINE, December 23,1788\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\nParis, December 23,1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is true that I received very long ago your favors of September the\r\n9th and 15th, and that I have been in daily intention of answering them,\r\nfully and confidentially; but you know such a correspondence between\r\nyou and me cannot pass through the post, nor even by the couriers\r\nof ambassadors. The French packet-boats being discontinued, I am now\r\nobliged to watch opportunities by Americans going to London, to write\r\nmy letters to America. Hence it has happened, that these, the sole\r\nopportunities by which I can write to you without fear, have been lost,\r\nby the multitude of American letters I had to write. I now determine,\r\nwithout foreseeing any such conveyance, to begin my letter to you,\r\nso that when a conveyance occurs, I shall only have to add recent\r\noccurrences. Notwithstanding the interval of my answer which has taken\r\nplace, I must beg a continuance of your correspondence; because I\r\nhave great confidence in your communications, and since Mr. Adams’s\r\ndeparture, I am in need of authentic information from that country.\r\n\r\nI will begin with the subject of your bridge, in which I feel myself\r\ninterested; and it is with great pleasure that I learn, by your favor\r\nof the 16th, that the execution of the arch of experiment exceeds\r\nyour expectations. In your former letter you mention, that, instead of\r\narranging your tubes and bolts as ordinates to the cord of the arch, you\r\nhad reverted to your first idea, of arranging them in the direction of\r\nradii. I am sure it will gain both in beauty and strength. It is true\r\nthat the divergence of these radii recurs as a difficulty, in getting\r\nthe rails on upon the bolts; but I thought this fully removed by the\r\nanswer you first gave me, when I suggested that difficulty, to wit, that\r\nyou should place the rails first, and drive the bolts through them,\r\nand not, as I had imagined, place the bolts first, and put the rails on\r\nthem. I must doubt whether what you now suggest will be as good as\r\nyour first idea; to wit, to have every rail split into two pieces\r\nlongitudinally, so that there shall be but the halves of the holes in\r\neach, and then to clamp the two halves together. The solidity of this\r\nmethod cannot be equal to that of the solid rail, and it increases the\r\nsuspicious parts of the whole machine, which, in a first experiment,\r\nought to be rendered as few as possible. But of all this the practical\r\niron men are much better judges than we theorists. You hesitate between\r\nthe catenary and portion of a circle. I have lately received from Italy\r\na treatise on the equilibrium of arches, by the Abbe Mascheroni. It\r\nappears to be a very scientifical work. I have not yet had time to\r\nengage in it; but I find that the conclusions of his demonstrations are,\r\nthat every part of the catenary is in perfect equilibrium. It is a great\r\npoint, then, in a new experiment, to adopt the sole arch, where the\r\npressure will be equally borne by every point of it. If any one point is\r\npushed with accumulated pressure, it will introduce a danger, foreign to\r\nthe essential part of the plan. The difficulty you suggest, is, that the\r\nrails being all in catenaries, the tubes must be of different lengths,\r\nas these approach nearer or recede farther from each other, and\r\ntherefore you recur to the portions of concentric circles, which are\r\nequidistant in all their parts. But I would rather propose, that you\r\nmake your middle rail an exact catenary, and the interior and exterior\r\nrails parallels to that. It is true, they will not be exact catenaries,\r\nbut they will depart very little from it; much less than portions of\r\ncircles will. Nothing has been done here on the subject since you went\r\naway. There is an Abbe D’Arnal at Nismes, who had obtained an exclusive\r\nprivilege for navigating the rivers of this country by the aid of the\r\nsteam-engine. This interests Mr. Rumsey, who had hoped the same thing.\r\nD’Arnal’s privilege was published in a paper of the 10th of November.\r\nProbably, therefore, his application for it was previous to the delivery\r\nof Mr. Rumsey’s papers to the secretary of the Academy of Sciences,\r\nwhich was in the latter part of the month of August. However, D’Arnal is\r\nnot a formidable competitor. He is not in circumstances to make any use\r\nhimself of his privilege, and he has so illy succeeded with a steam-mill\r\nhe erected at Nismes, that he is not likely to engage others to venture\r\nin his projects. To say another word of the catenarian arch, without\r\ncaring about mathematical demonstrations, its nature proves it to be in\r\nequilibrio in every point. It is the arch formed by a string fixed at\r\nboth ends, and swaying loose in all the intermediate points. Thus at\r\nliberty, they must finally take that position, wherein every one will\r\nbe equally pressed; for if any one was more pressed than the neighboring\r\npoint, it would give way, from the flexibility of the matter of the\r\nstring.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of sincere esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVII.--TO JOHN JAY, January 11, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, January 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters were of the 14th, 19th, and 29th of November, by the way\r\nof London. The present will go the same way, through a private channel.\r\n\r\nAll military operations in Europe seem to have been stopped, by the\r\nexcessive severity of the weather. In this country, it is unparalleled\r\nin so early a part of the winter, and in duration, having continued\r\nsince the middle of November, during which time it has been as low as\r\nnine degrees below nought, that is to say, forty degrees below freezing,\r\nby Fahrenheit’s thermometer; and it has increased the difficulties of\r\nthe administration here. They had, before, to struggle with the want of\r\nmoney, and want of bread for the people, and now, the want of fuel for\r\nthem, and want of employment. The siege of Oczakow is still continued,\r\nthe soldiers sheltering themselves in the Russian manner, in\r\nsubterraneous barracks; and the Captain Pacha has retired with his\r\nfleet. The death of the King of Spain has contributed, with the insanity\r\nof the English King, to render problematical the form which the affairs\r\nof Europe will ultimately take. Some think a peace possible between the\r\nTurks and two Empires, with the cession of Crimea to the former, as less\r\nimportant to Russia than Poland, which she is in danger of losing. In\r\nthis case, the two Empires might attack the King of Prussia, and the\r\nscene of war be only changed. He is certainly uneasy at the accident\r\nhappened to his principal ally. There seems no doubt, but that the\r\nPrince of Wales will be sole regent; but it is also supposed, they\r\nwill not give him the whole executive power, and particularly, that of\r\ndeclaring war without the consent of the parliament. Should his personal\r\ndispositions, therefore, and that of a new ministry, be the same which\r\nthe King had, of co-operating with Prussia, yet the latter cannot count\r\non their effect. Probably, the parliament will not consent to war, so\r\nthat I think we may consider the two great powers of France and England\r\nas absolutely at rest for some time.\r\n\r\nAs the character of the Prince of Wales is becoming interesting, I have\r\nendeavored to learn what it truly is. This is less difficult in his\r\ncase, than in that of other persons of his rank, because he has taken no\r\npains to hide himself from the world. The information I most rely on,\r\nis from a person here, with whom I am intimate, who divides his time\r\nbetween Paris and London, an Englishman by birth, of truth, sagacity,\r\nand science. He is of a circle, when in London, which has had good\r\nopportunities of knowing the Prince; but he has also, himself, had\r\nspecial occasions of verifying their information, by his own personal\r\nobservation. He happened, when last in London, to be invited to a dinner\r\nof three persons. The Prince came by chance, and made the fourth. He\r\nate half a leg of mutton; did not taste of small dishes, because small;\r\ndrank Champagne and Burgundy as small beer during dinner, and Bordeaux\r\nafter dinner, as the rest of the company. Upon the whole, he ate as much\r\nas the other three, and drank about two bottles of wine without seeming\r\nto feel it. My informant sat next him, and being till then unknown\r\nto the Prince, personally, (though not by character), and lately from\r\nFrance, the Prince confined his conversation almost entirely to him.\r\nObserving to the Prince that he spoke French without the least foreign\r\naccent, the Prince told him, that when very young, his father had put\r\nonly French servants about him, and that it was to that circumstance he\r\nowed his pronunciation. He led him from this to give an account of his\r\neducation, the total of which was the learning a little Latin. He has\r\nnot a single element of Mathematics, of Natural or Moral Philosophy, or\r\nof any other science on earth, nor has the society he has kept been such\r\nas to supply the void of education. It has been that of the lowest, the\r\nmost illiterate and profligate persons of the kingdom, without choice\r\nof rank or mind, and with whom the subjects of conversation are only\r\nhorses, drinking-matches, bawdy houses, and in terms the most vulgar.\r\nThe young nobility, who begin by associating with him, soon leave him,\r\ndisgusted with the insupportable profligacy of his society; and Mr. Fox,\r\nwho has been supposed his favorite, and not over nice in the choice\r\nof company, would never keep his company habitually. In fact, he never\r\nassociated with a man of sense. He has not a single idea of justice,\r\nmorality, religion, or of the rights of men, or any anxiety for the\r\nopinion of the world. He carries that indifference for fame so far, that\r\nhe would probably not be hurt were he to lose his throne, provided he\r\ncould be assured of having always meat, drink, horses, and women. In\r\nthe article of women, nevertheless, he is become more correct, since his\r\nconnection with Mrs. Fitzherbert, who is an honest and worthy woman:\r\nhe is even less crapulous than he was. He had a fine person, but it\r\nis becoming coarse. He possesses good native common sense; is affable,\r\npolite, and very good humored. Saying to my informant on another\r\noccasion, ‘your friend, such a one, dined with me yesterday, and I made\r\nhim damned drunk;’ he replied, ‘I am sorry for it; I had heard that your\r\nroyal highness had left off drinking;’ the Prince laughed, tapped him on\r\nthe shoulder very good-naturedly, without saying a word, or ever after\r\nshowing any displeasure. The Duke of York, who was for some time\r\ncried up as the prodigy of the family, is as profligate, and of less\r\nunderstanding. To these particular traits, from a man of sense and\r\ntruth, it would be superfluous to add the general terms of praise or\r\nblame, in which he is spoken of by other persons, in whose impartiality\r\nand penetration, I have less confidence. A sample is better than a\r\ndescription. For the peace of Europe, it is best that the King should\r\ngive such gleamings of recovery, as would prevent the regent or his\r\nministry from thinking themselves firm, and yet, that he should\r\nnot recover. This country advances with a steady pace towards the\r\nestablishment of a constitution, whereby the people will resume the\r\ngreat mass of those powers, so fatally lodged in the hands of the King.\r\nDuring the session of the _Notables_, and after their votes against the\r\nrights of the people, the Parliament of Paris took up the subject, and\r\npassed a vote in opposition to theirs, (which I send you.) This was not\r\ntheir genuine sentiment: it was a manœuvre of the young members, who are\r\ntruly well disposed, taking advantage of the accidental absence of many\r\nold members, and bringing others over by the clause, which, while it\r\nadmits the negative of the States General in legislation, reserves still\r\nto the parliament the right of enregistering, that is to say, another\r\nnegative. The _Notables_ persevered in their opinion. The Princes of the\r\nblood (Monsieur and the Duke d’Orleans excepted) presented and published\r\na memoire, threatening a scission. The parliament were proposing to\r\napprove of that memoire (by way of rescinding their former vote), and\r\nwere prevented from it by the threat of a young member, to impeach\r\n(_denoncer_) the memoire and the Princes who signed it. The vote of the\r\n_Notables_, therefore, remaining balanced by that of the parliament,\r\nthe voice of the nation becoming loud and general for the rights of the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_, a strong probability that if they were not allowed one\r\nhalf the representation, they would send up their members with express\r\ninstructions to agree to no tax and to no adoption of the public\r\ndebts, and the court really wishing to give them a moiety of the\r\nrepresentation, this was decided on ultimately. You are not to suppose\r\nthat these dispositions of the court proceed from any love of the\r\npeople, or justice towards their rights. Courts love the people always,\r\nas wolves do the sheep. The fact is this. The court wants money. From\r\nthe _Tiers-Etat_ they cannot get it, because they are already squeezed\r\nto the last drop. The clergy and the nobles, by their privileges and\r\ntheir influence, have hitherto screened their property, in a great\r\ndegree, from public contribution. That half of the orange, then, remains\r\nyet to be squeezed, and for this operation there is no agent powerful\r\nenough, but the people. They are, therefore, brought forward as the\r\nfavorites of the court, and will be supported by them. The moment of\r\ncrisis will be the meeting of the States; because their first act will\r\nbe, to decide whether they shall vote by persons or by orders. The\r\nclergy will leave nothing unattempted to obtain the latter; for they see\r\nthat the spirit of reformation will not confine itself to the political,\r\nbut will extend to the ecclesiastical establishment also. With respect\r\nto the nobles, the younger members are generally for the people, and the\r\nmiddle aged are daily coming over to the same side: so that by the time\r\nthe States meet, we may hope there will be a majority of that body,\r\nalso, in favor of the people, and consequently for voting by persons,\r\nand not by orders.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, by the report of Mr. Necker (in the gazette of\r\nFrance), 1. a renewal of the renunciation of the power of imposing a new\r\ntax by the King, and a like renunciation of the power of continuing any\r\nold one; 2. an acknowledgment that the States are to appropriate the\r\npublic monies, which will go to the binding the court to a civil list;\r\n3. a consent to the periodical meeting of the States; 4. to consider of\r\nthe restrictions of which _lettres de cachet_ are susceptible; 5. the\r\ndegree of liberty to be given to the press; 6. a bill of rights; and 7.\r\nthere is a passage which looks towards the responsibility of ministers.\r\nNothing is said of communicating to them a share in the legislation. The\r\nministry, perhaps, may be unwilling to part with this, but it will be\r\ninsisted on in the States. The letters of convocation will not appear\r\ntill towards the latter end of the month: neither time nor place are yet\r\ndeclared, but Versailles is talked of, and we may well presume that some\r\ntime in April will be fixed on. In the mean time, Mr. Necker gets money\r\nto keep the machine in motion. Their funds rose slowly, but steadily,\r\ntill within these few days, when there was a small check. However,\r\nthey stand very well, and will rise. The _caisse d’escompte_ lent the\r\ngovernment twenty-five millions, two days ago. The navy of this country\r\nsustained a heavy loss lately, by the death of the Bailli de Suffrein.\r\nHe was appointed Generalissimo of the Atlantic, when war was hourly\r\nexpected with England, and is certainly the officer on whom the nation\r\nwould have reposed its principal hopes, in such a case. We just now\r\nhear of the death of the Speaker of the House of Commons, before\r\nthe nomination of a regent, which adds a new embarrassment to the\r\nre-establishment of government in England. Since writing mine of\r\nNovember the 29th, yours of the 23rd of September has come to hand. As\r\nthe General of the Mathurins was to be employed in the final redemption\r\nof our captives, I thought that their previous support had better be\r\nput into his hands, and conducted by himself in such a way as not to\r\ncounterwork his plan of redemption, whenever we can enable him to begin\r\non it. I gave him full powers as to the amount and manner of subsisting\r\nthem. He has undertaken it, informing me, at the same time, that it\r\nwill be on a very low scale, to avoid suspicion of its coming from the\r\npublic. He spoke of but three sous a day per man, as being sufficient\r\nfor their physical necessaries, more than which, he thinks it not\r\nadvisable to give. I have no definitive answer yet from our bankers,\r\nwhether we may count on the whole million last agreed to be borrowed,\r\nbut I have no doubt of it, from other information, though I have not\r\ntheir formal affirmative. The gazettes of Leyden and France to this\r\ndate, accompany this. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXVIII.--TO JAMES MADISON, January 12, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, January 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 18th of November; since which, I have received\r\nyours of the 21st of September, and October the 8th, with the pamphlet\r\non the Mohicon language, for which, receive my thanks. I endeavor to\r\ncollect all the vocabularies I can of the American Indians, as of those\r\nof Asia, persuaded, that if they ever had a common parentage, it will\r\nappear in their languages.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to see the vote of Congress, of September the 16th, on the\r\nsubject of the Mississippi, as I had before seen, with great uneasiness,\r\nthe pursuit of other principles, which I could never reconcile to my\r\nown ideas of probity or wisdom, and from which, and my knowledge of the\r\ncharacter of our western settlers, I saw that the loss of that country\r\nwas a necessary consequence. I wish this return to true policy may be in\r\ntime to prevent evil. There has been a little foundation for the reports\r\nand fears relative to the Marquis de la Fayette. He has, from the\r\nbeginning, taken openly part with those who demand a constitution; and\r\nthere was a moment that we apprehended the Bastile: but they ventured on\r\nnothing more, than to take from him a temporary service, on which he\r\nhad been ordered; and this, more to save appearances for their own\r\nauthority, than any thing else; for at the very time they pretended\r\nthat they had put him into disgrace, they were constantly conferring and\r\ncommunicating with him. Since this, he has stood on safe ground, and is\r\nviewed as among the foremost of the patriots. Every body here is trying\r\ntheir hand at forming declarations of rights. As something of that kind\r\nis going on with you also, I send you two specimens from hence. The\r\none is by our friend of whom I have just spoken. You will see that it\r\ncontains the essential principles of ours, accommodated as much as\r\ncould be, to the actual state of things here. The other is from a very\r\nsensible man, a pure theorist, of the sect called the _Economists_, of\r\nwhich Turgot was considered as the head. The former is adapted to the\r\nexisting abuses, the latter goes to those possible, as well as to those\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Doctor Spence, supposed to have been taken by the\r\nAlgerines, I think the report extremely improbable. O’Bryan, one of our\r\ncaptives there, has constantly written to me, and given me information\r\non every subject he thought interesting. He could not have failed to\r\nknow if such a capture had been made, though before his time, nor to\r\ninform me of it. I am under perpetual anxiety for our captives there.\r\nThe money, indeed, is not yet ready at Amsterdam; but when it shall\r\nbe, there are no orders from the board of treasury to the bankers, to\r\nfurnish what may be necessary for the redemption of the captives: and\r\nit is so long since Congress approved the loan, that the orders of the\r\ntreasury for the application of the money would have come, if they\r\nhad intended to send any. I wrote to them early on the subject, and\r\npointedly. I mentioned it to Mr. Jay also, merely that he might suggest\r\nit to them. The payments to the foreign officers will await the same\r\nformality.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to the case of Mrs. Burke. We have no\r\nnews of Doctor Franklin since July last, when he was very ill. Though\r\nthe silence of our letters on that subject is a proof that he is well,\r\nyet there is an anxiety here among his friends. We have lately had three\r\nbooks published, which are of great merit, in different lines. The\r\none is in seven volumes, octavo, by an Abbe Barthelemy, wherein he has\r\ncollected every subject of Grecian Literature, after a labor of thirty\r\nyears. It is called ‘Les Voyages d’Anacharsis.’ I have taken a copy for\r\nyou, because the whole impression was likely to be run off at once.\r\nThe second is a work on government, by the Marquis de Condorcet, two\r\nvolumes, octavo. I shall secure you a copy. The third are the works of\r\nthe King of Prussia, in sixteen volumes, octavo. These were a little\r\ngarbled at Berlin, before printed. The government lays its hands on\r\nall which come here, and change some leaves. There is a genuine\r\nedition published at Basle, where even the garblings of Berlin are\r\nre-established. I doubt the possibility of getting a copy, so vigilant\r\nis the government as to this work. I shall obtain you one, if it be\r\npossible. As I write all the public news to Mr. Jay, I will not repeat\r\nit to you. I have just received the Flora Caroliniana of Walter, a very\r\nlearned and good work. I am, with very sincere esteem and respect, Dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIX.--TO JOHN JAY, January 14, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, January 14, 1789.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 11th, I have said nothing of the _Arrêt_ explanatory\r\nof that of September the 28th, on the subject of whale-oils, which\r\nmy letter of November the 19th gave you reason to expect. Though this\r\nexplanatory _Arrêt_ has been passed so long ago as the 7th of December,\r\nit has not been possible for me to obtain an authentic copy of it, till\r\nlast night. I now enclose that to you, with a copy of a letter to me\r\nfrom Mr. Necker, on the subject. The reception of our oils in the mean\r\ntime, is provided for by an intermediate order. You will observe, that\r\nin the _Arrêt_ it is said to be passed ‘_provisoirement,_’ and that Mr.\r\nNecker expressly holds up to us in his letter, a repeal, whenever the\r\nnational fishery supplies their wants. The _Arrêt_, however, is not\r\nlimited in its duration, and we have several chances against its repeal.\r\nIt may be questioned, whether Mr. Necker thinks the fishery worth the\r\nexpense. It may be well questioned, whether, either with or without\r\nencouragement, the nation, whose navigation is the least economical of\r\nall in Europe, can ever succeed in the whale-fishery, which calls for\r\nthe most rigorous economy. It is hoped that a share in the legislation\r\nwill pass immediately into the hands of the States General, so as to\r\nbe no longer in the power of the _commis_ of a bureau, or even of his\r\nminister, to smuggle a law through, unquestioned; and we may even hope\r\nthat the national demand for this oil will increase faster than both\r\ntheir and our fisheries together will supply. But in spite of all these\r\nhopes, if the English should find means to cover their oils under our\r\nname, there will be great danger of a repeal. It is essential, then,\r\nthat our government take effectual measures to prevent the English from\r\nobtaining genuine sea-papers, that they enable their consuls in the\r\nports of France (as soon as they shall be named) to detect counterfeit\r\npapers, and that we convince this government that we use our best\r\nendeavors, with good faith, as it is clearly our interest to do; for the\r\nrivalship of the English is the only one we have to fear. It had already\r\nbegun to render our oils invendible in the ports of France. You will\r\nobserve that Mr. Necker renews the promise of taking off the ten sous\r\npour livre, at the end of the next year.\r\n\r\nOczakow is at length taken by assault. The assailants were fourteen\r\nthousand, and the garrison twelve thousand, of whom seven thousand were\r\ncut to pieces before they surrendered. The Russians lost three thousand\r\nmen. This is the Russian version, of which it is safe to believe no\r\npart, but that Oczakow is taken. The Speaker of the English House of\r\nCommons, having died suddenly, they have chosen Mr. Grenville, a young\r\nman of twenty-seven years of age. This proves that. Mr. Pitt is firm\r\nwith the present parliament.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXX.--TO MADAME NECKER, January 24, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME NECKER.\r\n\r\nParis, January 24, 1789.\r\n\r\nI have received, Madam, with a great deal of sensibility, the letter of\r\nthe 22nd instant, with which you were pleased to honor me on the claims\r\nof Monsieur Klein against the United States; and immediately endeavored\r\nto inform myself of their foundation, by an examination of the journals\r\nof Congress. Congress consisting of many persons, can only speak by the\r\norgan of their records. If they have any engagements, they are to\r\nbe found there. If not found there, they can never have existed. I\r\nproceeded to this examination, with all the partialities which were\r\nnaturally inspired by the interest you are so good as to take in\r\nhis behalf, the desire of doing what will be agreeable to you, and a\r\ndisposition to obtain for him the justice which might be his due. I have\r\nextracted, literally, from those journals, every thing I find in them\r\non his subject, and I take the liberty of enclosing you those extracts.\r\nFrom them, as well as from what I recollect of the ordinary train of\r\nbusiness about the years 1778 and 1779, I presume the following to be\r\nvery nearly the history of Monsieur Klein’s case.\r\n\r\nCongress were generally desirous of adding to their army during the war.\r\nAmong other methods attempted, it was usual for foreigners (multitudes\r\nof whom went to ask command), when they found there was no vacancy,\r\nto propose to raise troops themselves, on condition they should have\r\ncommissions to command them. I suppose that Messrs. Klein, Fearer, and\r\nKleinsmit (named in the resolution of Congress of 1778, and whom, from\r\ntheir names, I conjecture to be Germans) offered to enlist a body of men\r\nfrom among the German prisoners taken with General Burgoyne at Saratoga,\r\non condition that Fearer and Kleinsmit should be captains over them, and\r\nKlein, lieutenant colonel. Three months seem to have been allowed them\r\nfor raising their corps. However, at the end of ten months it seems they\r\nhad engaged but twenty-four men, and that all of these, except five, had\r\ndeserted. Congress, therefore, put an end to the project, June the 21st,\r\n1779, (and not in July, 1780, as Monsieur Klein says) by informing him\r\nthey had no further use for his services, and giving him a year’s pay\r\nand subsistence to bring him to Europe. He chose to stay there three and\r\na half longer, as he says, to solicit what was due to him. Nothing could\r\never have been due to him, but pay and subsistence for the ten months\r\nhe was trying to enlist men, and the donation of a year’s pay and\r\nsubsistence; and it is not probable he would wait three years and a half\r\nto receive these. I suppose he has staid, in hopes of finding some other\r\nopening for employment. If these articles of pay and subsistence have\r\nnot been paid to him, he has the certificates of the paymaster and\r\ncommissary to prove it; because it was an invariable rule, when demands\r\ncould not be paid, to give the party a certificate, to establish the sum\r\ndue to him. If he has not such a certificate, it is a proof he has\r\nbeen paid. If he has it, he can produce it, and in that case, I will\r\nundertake to represent his claim to our government, and will answer for\r\ntheir justice.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to correct several inaccuracies in the letter of\r\nMonsieur Klein, such as that Congress engaged to give him a regiment;\r\nthat he paid the recruiting money out of his own pocket; that his\r\nsoldiers had nothing but bread and water; that Congress had promised\r\nhim they would pay his soldiers in specie, &c.; some of which are\r\nimpossible, and others very improbable; but these would be details too\r\nlengthy, Madam, for you to be troubled with. Klein’s object is to\r\nbe received at the hospital of invalids. I presume he is not of the\r\ndescription of persons entitled to be received there, and that his\r\nAmerican commission and American grievances are the only ground he has,\r\nwhereon to raise a claim to reception. He has therefore tried to make\r\nthe most of them. Few think there is any immorality in scandalizing\r\ngovernments or ministers; and M. Klein’s distresses render this resource\r\nmore innocent in him, than it is in most others.\r\n\r\nYour commands, Madam, to give what information I could, have drawn thus\r\nmuch from me. I would not wish to weaken the hopes he so justly rests\r\non your, known goodness and benevolence. On the contrary, the weaker his\r\nclaims elsewhere, the stronger they will plead in your bosom to procure\r\nhim relief; and whatever may be done for him here, I repeat it, that if\r\nhe has any just demand against the United States, and will furnish\r\nme with proofs of it, I will solicit it with zeal, and, I trust, with\r\neffect. To procure him justice will be one gratification, and a great\r\nadditional one will be, that he has procured me the occasion of offering\r\nyou my portion of the general tribute so justly due, for all the good\r\nyou have done, and all you are perpetually endeavoring to do. Accept\r\nthen, Madam, I pray you, this homage from one, whose motives are\r\npure truth and justice, when he assures you of the sincerity of those\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect, with which he has the honor to be,\r\nMadam, your most obedient and most\r\n\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXI.--TO JOHN JAY, February 1, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, February 1, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters have been of the 11th, 14th, and 21st of January. The\r\npresent conveyance being through the post to Havre, from whence a vessel\r\nis to sail for New York, I avail myself of it, principally to send\r\nyou the newspapers. That of Leyden of the 24th, contains a note of the\r\n_Chargé des Affaires_ of France, at Warsaw, which is interesting. It\r\nshows a concert between France and Russia; it is a prognostication that\r\nRussia will interfere in the affairs of Poland, and if she does, it is\r\nmost probable that the King of Prussia must be drawn into the war. The\r\nrevolution which has taken place in Geneva, is a remarkable and late\r\nevent. With the loss of only two or three lives, and in the course of\r\none week, riots, begun at first on account of a rise in the price of\r\nbread, were improved and pointed to a reformation of their\r\nconstitution; and their ancient constitution has been almost completely\r\nre-established. Nor do I see any reason to doubt of the permanence\r\nof the re-establishment. The King of England has shown such marks of\r\nreturning reason, that the regency bill was postponed in the House\r\nof Lords, on the 19th instant. It seems now probable, there may be no\r\nchange of the ministry, perhaps no regent. We may be sure, however, that\r\nthe present ministry make the most of those favorable symptoms. There\r\nhas been a riot in Brittany, begun on account of the price of bread, but\r\nconverted into a quarrel between the _Noblesse_ and _Tiers-Etat_. Some\r\nfew lives were lost in it. All is quieted for the present moment. In\r\nBurgundy and Franche Compte, the opposition of the nobles to the views\r\nof government is very warm. Every where else, however, the revolution\r\nis going on quietly and steadily, and the public mind ripening so\r\nfast, that there is great reason to hope a good result from the States\r\nGeneral. Their numbers (about twelve hundred) give room to fear, indeed,\r\nthat they may be turbulent. Having never heard of Admiral Paul Jones\r\nsince the action, in which he took a part before Oczakow, I began to be\r\na little uneasy. But I have now received a letter from him, dated at\r\nSt. Petersburg, the 31 st of January, where he had just arrived, at the\r\ndesire of the Empress. He has hitherto commanded on the Black Sea. He\r\ndoes not know whether he shall be employed there, or where, the ensuing\r\ncampaign. I have no other interesting intelligence, which would not\r\nlead me into details, improper for the present mode of conveyance. After\r\nobserving, therefore, that the gazettes of France and Leyden, to the\r\npresent date, accompany this, I shall only add assurance of the sincere\r\nesteem and respect, with which I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXII.--TO JOHN JAY, February 4, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, February 4, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of November the 25th, by Gouverneur Morris, is duly received.\r\nI must beg you to take the trouble of deciphering yourself what follows,\r\nand to communicate it to nobody but the President, at least for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWe had before understood, through different channels, that the conduct\r\nof the Count de Moustier was politically and morally offensive. It was\r\ndelicate for me to speak on the subject to the Count de Montmorin.\r\nThe invaluable mediation of our friend, the Marquis de la Fayette, was\r\ntherefore resorted to, and the subject explained, though not pressed.\r\nLater intelligence showing the necessity of pressing it, it was\r\nyesterday resumed, and represented through the same medium to the Count\r\nde Montmorin, that recent information proved to us, that his minister’s\r\nconduct had rendered him personally odious in America, and might even\r\ninfluence the dispositions of the two nations; that his recall was\r\nbecome a matter of mutual concern; that we had understood he was\r\ninstructed to remind the new government of their debt to this country,\r\nand that he was in the purpose of doing it in very harsh terms; that\r\nthis could not increase their desire of hastening payment, and might\r\nwound their affections: that, therefore, it was much to be desired that\r\nhis discretion should not be trusted to, as to the form in which the\r\ndemand should be made, but that the letter should be written here, and\r\nhe instructed to add nothing but his signature: nor was his private\r\nconduct omitted. The Count de Montmorin was sensibly impressed. He very\r\nreadily determined that the letter should be formed here, but said that\r\nthe recall was a more difficult business: that as they had no particular\r\nfact to allege against the Count de Moustier, they could not recall him\r\nfrom that ministry, without giving him another, and there was no vacancy\r\nat present. However, he would hazard his first thoughts on the subject,\r\nsaving the right of correcting them by further consideration. They\r\nwere these: that there was a loose expression in one of de Moustier’s\r\nletters, which might be construed into a petition for leave of absence;\r\nthat he would give him permission to return to France; that it had been\r\nbefore decided, on the request of the Marquis de la Luzerne, that Otto\r\nshould go to him to London; that they would send a person to America\r\nas _Chargé des Affaires_ in place of Otto, and that if the President\r\n(General Washington) approved of him, he should be afterwards made\r\nminister. He had cast his eye on Colonel Ternant, and desired the\r\nMarquis to consult me, whether he would be agreeable. At first I\r\nhesitated, recollecting to have heard Ternant represented in America, as\r\nan hypochondriac, discontented man, and paused for a moment between him\r\nand Barthelemy, at London, of whom I have heard a great deal of good.\r\nHowever, I concluded it safer to take one whom we knew and who knew us.\r\nThe Marquis was decidedly of this opinion. Ternant will see that his\r\npredecessor is recalled for unconciliatory deportment, and that he\r\nwill owe his own promotion to the approbation of the President.\r\nHe established a solid reputation in Europe, by his conduct when\r\nGeneralissimo of one of the United Provinces, during their late\r\ndisturbances; and it is generally thought, that if he had been put at\r\nthe head of the principal province, instead of the Rhingrave de Salm,\r\nhe would have saved that cause. Upon the whole, I believe you may expect\r\nthat the Count de Moustier will have an immediate leave of absence,\r\nwhich will soon after become a recall in effect. I will try also to have\r\nthe consuls admonished as to the line of conduct they should observe. I\r\nshall have the honor of writing you a general letter, within a few days.\r\nI have now that of assuring you of the sentiments of sincere esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I am, Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIII.--TO WILLIAM SHORT, February 9,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nParis, February 9,1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 22nd of January, on which day I received yours\r\nof December the 31st, and since that, the other of January the 14th. We\r\nhave now received news from America down to the middle of December.\r\nThey had then had no cold weather. All things relative to our new\r\nconstitution were going on well. Federal senators are; New Hampshire,\r\nPresident Langdon and Bartlett. Massachusetts, Strong and Dalton.\r\nConnecticut, Dr. Johnson and Ellsworth. New Jersey, Patterson and\r\nEllmer. Pennsylvania, Robert Morris and M’Clay. Delaware, Reed and\r\nBassett. Virginia, Richard Henry Lee and Grayson. Maryland, Charles\r\nCarroll, of Carrolton, and John Henry. All of these are federalists,\r\nexcept those of Virginia; so that a majority of federalists are secured\r\nin the Senate, and expected in the House of Representives. General\r\nWashington will be President, and probably Mr. Adams Vice-President. So\r\nthat the constitution will be put under way by those who will give it a\r\nfair trial. It does not seem probable that the attempt of New York,\r\nto have another convention to make amendments, will succeed, though\r\nVirginia concurs in it. It is tolerably certain that Congress will\r\npropose amendments to the Assemblies, as even the friends of the\r\nconstitution are willing to make amendments; some from a conviction they\r\nare necessary, others, from a spirit of conciliation. The addition of\r\na bill of rights will, probably, be the most essential change. A vast\r\nmajority of anti-federalists have got into the Assembly of Virginia,\r\nso that Mr. Henry is omnipotent there. Mr. Madison was left out as a\r\nsenator by eight or nine votes; and Henry has so modeled the districts\r\nfor representatives, as to tack Orange to counties where himself has\r\ngreat influence, that Madison may not be elected into the lower federal\r\nHouse, which was the place he had wished to serve in, and not the\r\nSenate. Henry pronounced a philippic against Madison in open\r\nAssembly, Madison being then at Philadelphia. Mifflin is President\r\nof Pennsylvania, and Peters, Speaker. Colonel Howard is Governor of\r\nMaryland. Beverly Randolph, Governor of Virginia; (this last is said\r\nby a passenger only, and he seems not very sure.) Colonel Humphreys is\r\nattacked in the papers for his French airs, for bad poetry, bad prose,\r\nvanity, &c. It is said his dress, in so gay a style, gives general\r\ndisgust against him. I have received a letter from him. He seems fixed\r\nwith General Washington. Mayo’s bridge, at Richmond, was completed, and\r\ncarried away in a few weeks. While up, it was so profitable that he\r\nhad great offers for it. A turnpike is established at Alexandria, and\r\nsucceeds. Rhode Island has again refused to call a convention. Spain has\r\ngranted to Colonel Morgan, of New Jersey, a vast tract of land on the\r\nwestern side of the Mississippi, with the monopoly of the navigation\r\nof that river. He is inviting settlers, and they swarm to him. Even the\r\nsettlement of Kentucky is likely to be much weakened by emigrations to\r\nMorgan’s grant. Warville has returned, charmed with our country. He is\r\ngoing to carry his wife and children to settle there. Gouverneur\r\nMorris has just arrived here; deputed, as is supposed, to settle Robert\r\nMorris’s affairs, which continue still deranged. Doctor Franklin was\r\nwell when he left America, which was about the middle of December.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI send Mr. Rutledge two letters by this post. Be so good as to present\r\nhim my esteem, and to be assured yourself, of the sincere esteem\r\nand attachment with which I am and shall ever be? Dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIV.--TO M. DE VILLEDEUIL, February 10, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE VILLEDEUIL.\r\n\r\nParis, February 10, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of troubling your Excellency with the following case,\r\nwhich I understand to be within your department. Mr. Jay, secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs, to the United States of America, having occasion\r\nto send me despatches of great importance, and by a courier express,\r\nconfided them to a Mr. Nesbitt, who offered himself in that character.\r\nHe has delivered them safely: but, in the moment of delivering them,\r\nexplained to me his situation, which is as follows. He was established\r\nin commerce at L’Orient, during the war. Losses by shipwreck, by\r\ncapture, and by the conclusion of the peace at a moment when he did not\r\nexpect it, reduced him to bankruptcy, and he returned to America, with\r\nthe consent of his creditors, to make the most of his affairs there.\r\nHe has been employed in this ever since, and now wishing to see his\r\ncreditors, and to consult them on their mutual interests, he availed\r\nhimself of Mr. Jay’s demand for a courier, to come under the safe\r\nconduct of that character to Paris, where he flattered himself he might\r\nobtain that of your Excellency, for the purpose of seeing his creditors,\r\nsettling, and arranging with them. He thinks a twelvemonth will be\r\nnecessary for this. Understanding that it is not unusual to grant safe\r\nconducts in such cases, and persuaded it will be for the benefit of\r\nhis creditors, I take the liberty of enclosing his memoir to your\r\nExcellency, and of soliciting your favorable attention to it, assured\r\nthat it will not be denied him, if it be consistent with the established\r\nusage; and if inadmissible, praying that your Excellency will have the\r\ngoodness to give me as early an answer as the other arduous occupations\r\nin which you are engaged, will admit, in order that he may know whether\r\nhe may see his creditors, or must return without. I am encouraged to\r\ntrouble your Excellency with this application, by the goodness with\r\nwhich you have been pleased to attend to our interests on former\r\noccasions, and by the desire of availing myself of every occasion of\r\nproffering to you the homage of those sentiments of attachment and\r\nrespect, with which I have the honor to be your Excellency’s most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXV.--TO MR. CARNES, February 15,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARNES.\r\n\r\nParis, February 15,1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of January the 23rd,\r\nand February the 9th and 10th. Your departure for America so soon,\r\npuzzles me as to the finishing the affair of Schweighaeuser and Dobree,\r\nin which I could have reposed myself on you. It remains, that I ask\r\nyou to recommend some person who may be perfectly relied on, in that\r\nbusiness. In fact, it is probably the only one I shall have occasion to\r\ntrouble them with before my own departure for America, which I expect\r\nto take place in May; and I fix my return to Paris, in December. While\r\nI ask your recommendation of a person to finish Dobree’s business with\r\nfidelity, I must ask your secrecy on the subject of that very business,\r\nso as not to name it at all, even to the person you shall recommend.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the distressed American who needs one hundred and forty\r\nlivres to enable him to return to America, I have no authority to apply\r\nany public monies to that purpose, and the calls of that nature are\r\nso numerous, that I am obliged to refuse myself to them in my private\r\ncapacity. As to Captain Newell’s case, you are sensible, that being\r\nin the channel of the laws of the land, to ask a special order from\r\ngovernment, would expose us, in reciprocity to like demands from them\r\nin America, to which our laws would never permit us to accede. Speaking\r\nconscientiously, we must say it is wrong in any government to interrupt\r\nthe regular course of justice. A minister has no right to intermeddle\r\nin a private suit, but when the laws of the country have been palpably\r\nperverted to the prejudice of his countryman.\r\n\r\nWhen you shall be so kind as to recommend to me a correspondent in your\r\nport during your absence, I will ask the favor of you also to give me\r\nsome idea of the time you expect to return.\r\n\r\nI have the honor, after wishing you pleasant and prosperous voyages, to\r\nassure you of the esteem and attachment, with which I am, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVI.--TO DR. BANCROFT, March 2, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. BANCROFT.\r\n\r\nParis, March 2, 1789\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have just received a letter of January the 31st from Admiral Paul\r\nJones, at Petersburg, which charging me with the execution of some\r\ncommissions, and these requiring money, he tells me you will answer my\r\ndrafts, to the amount of four or five thousand livres, on his account.\r\nBe so good as to inform me whether you will pay such drafts.\r\n\r\nA Monsieur Foulloy, who has been connected with Deane, lately offered me\r\nfor sale two volumes of Deane’s letter books and account books, that he\r\nhad taken instead of money, which Deane owed him. I have purchased them\r\non public account. He tells me Deane has still six or eight volumes\r\nmore, and being to return soon to London, he will try to get them\r\nalso, in order to make us pay high for them. You are sensible of the\r\nimpropriety of letting such books get into hands which might make\r\nan unfriendly use of them. You are sensible of the immorality of an\r\nex-minister’s selling his secrets for money and, consequently, that\r\nthere can be no immorality in tempting him with money to part with them;\r\nso that they may be restored to that government to whom they properly\r\nbelong. Your former acquaintance with Deane may, perhaps, put it in your\r\npower to render our country the service of recovering those books. It\r\nwould not do to propose it to him as for Congress. What other way would\r\nbest bring it about, you know best. I suppose his distresses and his\r\ncrapulous habits will not render him difficult on this head. On the\r\nsupposition that there are six or eight volumes, I think you might\r\nventure as far as fifty guineas, and proportionably for fewer. I will\r\nanswer your draft to this amount and purpose, or you may retain it out\r\nof any monies you may propose to pay me for admiral Jones. There is no\r\ntime to lose in this negotiation, as, should Foulloy arrive there\r\nbefore it is closed, he will spoil the bargain. If you should be able to\r\nrecover these books, I would ask the favor of you to send them to me by\r\nthe Diligence, that I may carry them back with me to America. I make no\r\napology for giving you this trouble. It is for our common country, and\r\ncommon interest.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere and great esteem and attachment, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVII.--TO M. DE MALESHERBES, March 11, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE MALESHERBES.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, March 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nYour zeal to promote the general good of mankind, by an interchange\r\nof useful things, and particularly in the line of agriculture, and the\r\nweight which your rank and station would give to your interposition,\r\ninduce me to ask it, for the purpose of obtaining one of the species of\r\nrice which grows in Cochin-China on high lands, and which needs no\r\nother watering than the ordinary rains. The sun and soil of Carolina are\r\nsufficiently powerful to insure the success of this plant, and Monsieur\r\nde Poivre gives such an account of its quality, as might induce the\r\nCarolinians to introduce it instead of the kind they now possess, which,\r\nrequiring the whole country to be laid under water during a certain\r\nseason of the year, sweeps off numbers of the inhabitants annually, with\r\npestilential fevers. If you would be so good as to interest yourself\r\nin the procuring for me some seeds of the dry rice of Cochin-China, you\r\nwould render the most precious service to my countrymen, on whose behalf\r\nI take the liberty of asking your interposition: very happy, at the same\r\ntime, to have found such an occasion of repeating to you the homage of\r\nthose sentiments of respect and esteem, with which I have the honor to\r\nbe, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXVIII.--TO JOHN JAY, March 12, 1789\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, March 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you, on the 1st instant, through the post.\r\nI write the present, uncertain whether Mr. Nesbitt, the bearer of your\r\nlast, will be the bearer of this, or whether it may not have to wait\r\nsome other private occasion. They have reestablished their packet-boats\r\nhere, indeed; but they are to go from Bordeaux, which, being between\r\nfour and five hundred miles from hence, is too far to send a courier\r\nwith any letters but on the most extraordinary occasions and without a\r\ncourier, they must pass through the post-office. I shall, therefore, not\r\nmake use of this mode of conveyance, but prefer sending my letters by\r\na private hand by the way of London. The uncertainty of finding private\r\nconveyances to London, is the principal objection to this.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of your letter, advising me to purchase the two volumes\r\nof Deane’s letters and accounts, I wrote to the person who had them,\r\nand after some offers and refusals, he let me have them for twenty-five\r\nlouis, instead of twenty louis asked at first. He told me that Deane\r\nhad still six or eight volumes more, and that when he should return to\r\nLondon he would try to get them, in order to make himself whole for the\r\nmoney he had lent Deane. As I knew he would endeavor to make us pay dear\r\nfor them, and it appeared to be your opinion, and that of the members\r\nyou had consulted, that it was an object worthy attention, I wrote\r\nimmediately to a friend in London to endeavor to purchase them from\r\nDeane himself, whose distresses and crapulous habits will probably\r\nrender him more easy to deal with. I authorized him to go as far as\r\nfifty guineas. I have as yet no answer from him. I enclose you a letter\r\nwhich I wrote last month to our bankers in Holland. As it will itself\r\nexplain the cause of its being written, I shall not repeat its substance\r\nhere. In answer to my proposition, to pay bills for the medals and the\r\nredemption of our captives, they quote a resolution of Congress (which,\r\nhowever, I do not find in the printed journals), appropriating the loans\r\nof 1787 and 1788 to the payment of interest on the Dutch loans till\r\n1790, inclusive, and the residue to salaries and contingencies in\r\nEurope, and they argue, that, according to this, they are not to pay\r\nany thing in Europe till they shall first have enough to pay all the\r\ninterest which will become due to the end of the year 1790; and that it\r\nis out of personal regard, that they relax from this so far as to pay\r\ndiplomatic salaries. So that here is a clear declaration they will\r\nanswer no other demands, till they have in hand money enough for all the\r\ninterest to the end of the year 1790. It is but a twelvemonth since\r\nI have had occasion to pay attention to the proceedings of those\r\ngentlemen; but during that time I have observed, that as soon as a sum\r\nof interest is becoming due, they are able to borrow just that, and no\r\nmore; or at least only so much more as may pay our salaries, and keep us\r\nquiet. Were they not to borrow for the interest, the failure to pay\r\nthat would sink the value of the capital, of which they are considerable\r\nsharers. So far their interests and ours concur. But there, perhaps,\r\nthey may separate. I think it possible they may choose to support our\r\ncredit to a certain point, and let it go no further, but at their will;\r\nto keep it so poised, as that it may be at their mercy. By this, they\r\nwill be sure to keep us in their own hands. They write word to the\r\ntreasury, that in order to raise money for the February interest, they\r\nwere obliged to agree with the subscribers, that Congress should open no\r\nother loan at Amsterdam this year, till this one be filled up, and that\r\nthis shall not be filled but by the present subscribers, and they not\r\nobliged to fill it. This is delivering us, bound hand and foot, to the\r\nsubscribers, that is, to themselves. Finding that they would not raise\r\nmoney for any other purposes, without being pushed, I wrote the letter I\r\nenclose you. They answer, as I have stated, by refusing to pay, alleging\r\nthe appropriation of Congress. I have written again to press them\r\nfurther, and to propose to them the payment of thirty thousand florins\r\nonly, for the case of our captives, as I am in hopes this may do. In\r\nthe close of my letter to them, you will observe I refer them, as to the\r\narticle of foreign officers, to the board of treasury. I had, in truth,\r\nreceived the printed journals a few days before, but had not yet had\r\ntime to read them carefully, and, particularly, had not then noted the\r\nvote of Congress of August the 20th, directing me to attend to that\r\narticle. I shall not fail to do what I can in it; but I am afraid they\r\nwill consider this also as standing on the same ground with the other\r\ncontingent articles.\r\n\r\nThis country, being generally engaged in its elections, affords nothing\r\nnew and worthy of communication. The hopes of accommodation between\r\nTurkey and the two empires do not gain strength. The war between Russia\r\nand Denmark on the one hand, and Sweden on the other, is likely also to\r\ngo on, the mediation of England being rendered of little force by the\r\naccident to its Executive. The progress of this war, and also of the\r\nbroils in Poland, may possibly draw the King of Prussia into it during\r\nthe ensuing campaign: and it must, before it be finished, take in this\r\ncountry, and perhaps England. The ill humor on account of the Dutch\r\nrevolution continues to rankle here. They have recalled their ambassador\r\nfrom the Hague, manifestly to show their dissatisfaction with that\r\ncourt, and some very dry memorials have lately been exchanged on the\r\nsubject of the money this country assumed to pay the Emperor for the\r\nDutch. I send you very full extracts of these, which will show you the\r\ndispositions of the two courts towards each other. Whether, and when\r\nthis country will be able to take an active part, will depend on\r\nthe issue of their States General. If they fund their public debts\r\njudiciously, and will provide further funds for a war, on the English\r\nplan, 1 believe they will be able to borrow any sums they please. In the\r\nmean time, the situation of England will leave them at leisure to settle\r\ntheir internal affairs well. That ministry, indeed, pretend their King\r\nis perfectly re-established. No doubt they will make the most of his\r\namendment, which is real, to a certain degree. But as, under pretence of\r\nthis, they have got rid of the daily certificate of the physicians, and\r\nthey are possessed of the King’s person, the public must judge hereafter\r\nfrom such facts only as they can catch. There are several at present,\r\nwhich, put together, induce a presumption that the King is only better,\r\nnot well. And should he be well, time will be necessary to give a\r\nconfidence, that it is not merely a lucid interval. On the whole, I\r\nthink we may conclude that that country will not take a part in the war\r\nthis year, which was by no means certain before.\r\n\r\nM. del Pinto, formerly minister of Portugal at London, and the same who\r\nnegotiated the treaty with us, being now put at the head of the ministry\r\nof that country, I presume that negotiation may be renewed successfully,\r\nif it be the desire of our government. Perhaps an admission of our flour\r\ninto their ports may be obtained now, as M. del Pinto seemed impressed\r\nwith our reasoning on that subject, and promised to press it on his\r\ncourt, though he could not then venture to put it into the treaty. There\r\nis not the same reason to hope any relaxation as to our reception in\r\nBrazil, because he would scarcely let us mention that at all. I think,\r\nmyself, it is their interest to take away all temptations to our\r\ncooperation in the emancipation of their colonies; and I know no means\r\nof doing this, but the making it our interest that they should continue\r\ndependant, nor any other way of making this our interest, but by\r\nallowing us a commerce with them. However, this is a mode of reasoning\r\nwhich their ministry, probably, could not bear to listen to. I send\r\nherewith the gazettes of France and Leyden, and have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXXIX.--TO F. HOPKINSON, March 13, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\nParis, March 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my last, which was of December the 21st, yours of December the\r\n9th and 21st are received. Accept my thanks for the papers and pamphlets\r\nwhich accompanied them, and mine and my daughters for the book of songs.\r\nI will not tell you how much they have pleased us, nor how well the last\r\nof them merits praise for its pathos, but relate a fact only, which\r\nis, that while my elder daughter was playing it on the harpsichord, I\r\nhappened to look towards the fire, and saw the younger one all in\r\ntears. I asked her if she was sick? She said, ‘No; but the tune was so\r\nmournful.’\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the _Encyclopédie_ has published something as to an\r\nadvanced price on his future volumes, which, I understand, alarms the\r\nsubscribers. It was in a paper which I do not take, and therefore I have\r\nnot yet seen it, nor can I say what it is. I hope that by this time\r\nyou have ceased to make wry faces about your vinegar, and that you have\r\nreceived it safe and good. You say that I have been dished up to you\r\nas an anti-federalist, and ask me if it be just. My opinion was never\r\nworthy enough of notice, to merit citing; but since you ask it, I will\r\ntell it to you. I am not a federalist, because I never submitted the\r\nwhole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever,\r\nin religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in any thing else, where\r\nI was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last\r\ndegradation of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to heaven but\r\nwith a party, I would not go there at all. Therefore, I protest to you,\r\nI am not of the party of federalists. But I am much farther from that\r\nof the anti-federalists. I approved, from the first moment, of the\r\ngreat mass of what is in the new constitution; the consolidation of the\r\ngovernment; the organization into executive, legislative, and judiciary;\r\nthe subdivision of the legislative; the happy compromise of interests\r\nbetween the great and little States, by the different manner of voting\r\nin the different Houses; the voting by persons instead of States; the\r\nqualified negative on laws given to the executive, which, however, I\r\nshould have liked better if associated with the judiciary also, as in\r\nNew York; and the power of taxation. I thought at first that the latter\r\nmight have been limited. A little reflection soon convinced me it ought\r\nnot to be. What I disapproved from the first moment, also, was the want\r\nof a bill of rights, to guard liberty against the legislative as well as\r\nexecutive branches of the government; that is to say, to secure freedom\r\nin religion, freedom of the press, freedom from monopolies, freedom from\r\nunlawful imprisonment, freedom from a permanent military, and a trial by\r\njury, in all cases determinable by the laws of the land. I disapproved,\r\nalso, the perpetual re-eligibility of the President. To these points\r\nof disapprobation I adhere. My first wish was, that the nine first\r\nconventions might accept the constitution, as the means of securing to\r\nus the great mass of good it contained, and that the four last might\r\nreject it, as the means of obtaining amendments. But I was corrected in\r\nthis wish, the moment I saw the much better plan of Massachusetts,\r\nand which had never occurred to me. With respect to the declaration of\r\nrights, I suppose the majority of the United States are of my opinion:\r\nfor I apprehend all the anti-federalists, and a very respectable\r\nproportion of the federalists, think that such a declaration should now\r\nbe annexed. The enlightened part of Europe have given us the greatest\r\ncredit for inventing this instrument of security for the rights of the\r\npeople, and have been not a little surprised to see us so soon give it\r\nup. With respect to the re-eligibility of the President, I find myself\r\ndiffering from the majority of my countrymen; for I think there are but\r\nthree States of the eleven which have desired an alteration of this.\r\nAnd, indeed, since the thing is established, I would wish it not to be\r\naltered during the life of our great leader, whose executive talents are\r\nsuperior to those, I believe, of any man in the world, and who, alone,\r\nby the authority of his name, and the confidence reposed in his perfect\r\nintegrity, is fully qualified to put the new government so under way, as\r\nto secure it against the efforts of opposition. But having derived from\r\nour error all the good there was in it, I hope we shall correct it, the\r\nmoment we can no longer have the same name at the helm.\r\n\r\nThese, my dear friend, are my sentiments, by which you will see I was\r\nright in saying, I am neither federalist nor anti-federalist; that I am\r\nof neither party, nor yet a trimmer between parties. These, my opinions,\r\nI wrote, within a few hours after I had read the constitution, to one or\r\ntwo friends in America. I had not then read one single word printed on\r\nthe subject. I never had an opinion in politics or religion, which I was\r\nafraid to own. A costive reserve on these subjects might have procured\r\nme more esteem from some people, but less from myself. My great wish\r\nis, to go on in a strict but silent performance of my duty: to avoid\r\nattracting notice, and to keep my name out of newspapers, because I find\r\nthe pain of a little censure, even when it is unfounded, is more acute\r\nthan the pleasure of much praise. The attaching circumstance of my\r\npresent office, is, that I can do its duties unseen by those for whom\r\nthey are done. You did not think, by so short a phrase in your letter,\r\nto have drawn on yourself such an egotistical dissertation. I beg your\r\npardon for it, and will endeavor to merit that pardon by the constant\r\nsentiments of esteem and attachment, with which I am, Dear Sir, your\r\nsincere friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXC.--TO MADAME DE BREHAN, March 14, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE BREHAN.\r\n\r\nParis, March 14, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Madam,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing to you on the 15th of February; soon after\r\nwhich, I had that of receiving your favor of December the 29th. I have\r\na thousand questions to ask you about your journey to the Indian treaty,\r\nhow you like their persons, their manners, their costumes, cuisine, &c.\r\nBut this I must defer till I can do it personally in New York, where I\r\nhope to see you for a moment in the summer, and to take your commands\r\nfor France. I have little to communicate to you from this place. It is\r\ndeserted: every body being gone into the country to choose or be chosen\r\ndeputies to the States General. I hope to see that great meeting before\r\nmy departure. It is to be on the 27th of next month. A great political\r\nrevolution will take place in your country, and that without bloodshed.\r\nA King with two hundred thousand men at his orders, is disarmed by the\r\nforce of the public opinion and the want of money. Among the economies\r\nbecoming necessary, perhaps one may be the opera. They say, it has cost\r\nthe public treasury an hundred thousand crowns the last year. A\r\nnew theatre is established since your departure; that of the _Opera\r\nBuffone_, where Italian operas are given, and good music. It is in the\r\n_Château des Tuileries_. Paris is every day enlarging and beautifying. I\r\ndo not count among its beauties, however, the wall with which they\r\nhave enclosed us. They have made some amends for this, by making fine\r\nboulevards within and without the walls. These are in considerable\r\nforwardness, and will afford beautiful rides round the city, of between\r\nfifteen and twenty miles in circuit. We have had such a winter, Madam,\r\nas makes me shiver yet, whenever I think of it. All communications,\r\nalmost, were cut off. Dinners and suppers were suppressed, and the money\r\nlaid out in feeding and warming the poor, whose labors were suspended by\r\nthe rigor of the season. Loaded carriages passed the Seine on the ice,\r\nand it was covered with thousands of people from morning till night,\r\nskating and sliding. Such sights were never seen before, and they\r\ncontinued two months. We have nothing new and excellent in your charming\r\nart of painting. In fact, I do not feel an interest in any pencil but\r\nthat of David. But I must not hazard details on a subject wherein I am\r\nso ignorant, and you such a connoisseur. Adieu, my dear Madam; permit\r\nme always the honor of esteeming and being esteemed by you, and of\r\ntendering you the homage of that respectful attachment with which I am,\r\nand shall ever be, Dear Madam, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCI.--TO JAMES MADISON, March 15, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, March 15, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 12th of January; since which I have received\r\nyours of October the 17th, December the 8th and 12th. That of October\r\nthe 17th came to hand only February the 23rd.\r\n\r\nHow it happened to be four months on the way, I cannot tell, as I never\r\nknew by what hand it came. Looking over my letter of January the 12th,\r\nI remark an error of the word ‘probable’ instead of’ improbable,’ which,\r\ndoubtless, however, you had been able to correct.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts on the subject of the declaration of rights, in the letter\r\nof October the 17th, I have weighed with great satisfaction. Some of\r\nthem had not occurred to me before, but were acknowledged just, in the\r\nmoment they were presented to my mind. In the arguments in favor of a\r\ndeclaration of rights, you omit one which has great weight with me; the\r\nlegal check which it puts into the hands of the judiciary. This is a\r\nbody, which, if rendered independent and kept strictly to their own\r\ndepartment, merits great confidence for their learning and integrity. In\r\nfact, what degree of confidence would be too much, for a body composed\r\nof such men as Wythe, Blair, and Pendleton? On characters like these,\r\nthe ‘_civium ardor prava jubentium_’ would make no impression. I am\r\nhappy to find that, on the whole, you are a friend to this amendment.\r\nThe declaration of rights is, like all other human blessings, alloyed\r\nwith some inconveniences, and not accomplishing fully its object. But\r\nthe good, in this instance, vastly overweighs the evil. I cannot refrain\r\nfrom making short answers to the objections which your letter states to\r\nhave been raised. 1. That the rights in question are reserved, by the\r\nmanner in which the federal powers are granted. Answer. A constitutive\r\nact, may, certainly, be so formed, as to need no declaration of rights.\r\nThe act itself has the force of a declaration, as far as it goes; and if\r\nit goes to all material points, nothing more is wanting. In the draught\r\nof a constitution which I had once a thought of proposing in Virginia,\r\nand printed afterwards, I endeavored to reach all the great objects\r\nof public liberty, and did not mean to add a declaration of rights.\r\nProbably the object was imperfectly executed; but the deficiencies would\r\nhave been supplied by others, in the course of discussion. But in a\r\nconstitutive act which leaves some precious articles unnoticed, and\r\nraises implications against others, a declaration of rights becomes\r\nnecessary, by way of supplement. This is the case of our new federal\r\nconstitution. This instrument forms us into one State, as to certain\r\nobjects, and gives us a legislative and executive body for these\r\nobjects. It should, therefore, guard us against their abuses of power,\r\nwithin the field submitted to them. 2. A positive declaration of some\r\nessential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude.\r\nAnswer. Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our\r\nrights, let us secure what we can. 3. The limited powers of the federal\r\ngovernment, and jealousy of the subordinate governments, afford a\r\nsecurity which exists in no other instance. Answer. The first member\r\nof this seems resolvable into the first objection before stated. The\r\njealousy of the subordinate governments is a precious reliance.\r\nBut observe that those governments are only agents. They must have\r\nprinciples furnished them, whereon to found their opposition. The\r\ndeclaration of rights will be the text, whereby they will try all the\r\nacts of the federal government. In this view, it is necessary to\r\nthe federal government also; as by the same text, they may try the\r\nopposition of the subordinate governments. 4. Experience proves the\r\ninefficacy of a bill of rights. True. But though it is not absolutely\r\nefficacious under all circumstances, it is of great potency always, and\r\nrarely inefficacious. A brace the more will often keep up the building\r\nwhich would have fallen, with that brace the less. There is a remarkable\r\ndifference between the characters of the inconveniences which attend\r\na declaration of rights, and those which attend the want of it. The\r\ninconveniences of the declaration are, that it may cramp government in\r\nits useful exertions. But the evil of this is short-lived, moderate,\r\nand reparable. The inconveniences of the want of a declaration are\r\npermanent, afflicting, and irreparable. They are in constant progression\r\nfrom bad to worse. The executive, in our governments, is not the sole,\r\nit is scarcely the principal object of my jealousy. The tyranny of the\r\nlegislatures is the most formidable dread at present, and will be for\r\nmany years. That of the executive will come in its turn; but it will\r\nbe at a remote period. I know there are some among us, who would now\r\nestablish a monarchy. But they are inconsiderable in number and weight\r\nof character. The rising race are all republicans. We were educated in\r\nroyalism; no wonder, if some of us retain that idolatry still. Our young\r\npeople are educated in republicanism; an apostacy from that to royalism\r\nis unprecedented and impossible. I am much pleased with the prospect\r\nthat a declaration of rights will be added; and I hope it will be done\r\nin that way, which will not endanger the whole frame of government, or\r\nany essential part of it.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto avoided public news in my letters to you, because your\r\nsituation insured you a communication of my letters to Mr. Jay. This\r\ncircumstance being changed, I shall, in future, indulge myself in these\r\ndetails to you. There had been some slight hopes that an accommodation\r\nmight be effected between the Turks and two empires; but these hopes do\r\nnot strengthen, and the season is approaching which will put an end to\r\nthem, for another campaign at least. The accident to the King of England\r\nhas had great influence on the affairs of Europe. His mediation, joined\r\nwith that of Prussia, would certainly have kept Denmark quiet, and so\r\nhave left the two empires in the hands of the Turks and Swedes. But the\r\ninactivity to which England is reduced, leaves Denmark more free, and\r\nshe will probably go on in opposition to Sweden. The King of Prussia,\r\ntoo, had advanced so far, that he can scarcely retire. This is rendered\r\nthe more difficult by the troubles he has excited in Poland. He cannot,\r\nwell abandon the party he had brought forward there; so that it is very\r\npossible he may be engaged in the ensuing campaign. France will be quiet\r\nthis year, because this year, at least, is necessary for settling her\r\nfuture constitution. The States will meet the 27th of April: and the\r\npublic mind will. I think, by that time, be ripe for a just decision\r\nof the question, whether they shall vote by orders or persons. I think\r\nthere is a majority of the Nobles already for the latter. If so,\r\ntheir affairs cannot but go on well. Besides settling for themselves a\r\ntolerably free constitution, perhaps as free a one as the nation is as\r\nyet prepared to bear, they will fund their public debts. This will give\r\nthem such a credit, as will enable them to borrow any money they may\r\nwant, and of course, to take the field again, when they think proper.\r\nAnd I believe they mean to take the field as soon as they can. The pride\r\nof every individual in the nation suffers under the ignominies they have\r\nlately been exposed to, and I think the States General will give money\r\nfor a war, to wipe off the reproach. There have arisen new bickerings\r\nbetween this court and that of the Hague; and the papers which have\r\npassed, show the most bitter acrimony rankling at the heart of this\r\nministry. They have recalled their ambassador from the Hague, without\r\nappointing a successor. They have given a note to the Diet of Poland,\r\nwhich shows a disapprobation of their measures. The insanity of the King\r\nof England has been fortunate for them, as it gives them time to put\r\ntheir house in order. The English papers tell you the King is well; and\r\neven the English ministry say so. They will naturally set the best foot\r\nforemost; and they guard his person so well, that it is difficult for\r\nthe public to contradict them. The King is probably better, but not\r\nwell, by a great deal. 1. He has been bled, and judicious physicians\r\nsay, that in his exhausted state, nothing could have induced a\r\nrecurrence to bleeding, but symptoms of relapse. 2. The Prince of Wales\r\ntells the Irish deputation, he will give them a definitive answer in\r\nsome days; but if the King had been well, he could have given it at\r\nonce. 3. They talk of passing a standing law, for providing a regency in\r\nsimilar cases. They apprehend then, they are not yet clear of the danger\r\nof wanting a regency.\r\n\r\n4. They have carried the King to church; but it was his private chapel.\r\nIf he be well, why do not they show him publicly to the nation, and\r\nraise them from that consternation into which they have been thrown,\r\nby the prospect of being delivered over to the profligate hands of the\r\nPrince of Wales. In short, judging from little facts, which are known in\r\nspite of their teeth, the King is better, but not well. Possibly he\r\nis getting well, but still time will be wanting to satisfy even the\r\nministry, that it is not merely a lucid interval. Consequently, they\r\ncannot interrupt France this year in the settlement of her affairs, and\r\nafter this year it will be too late.\r\n\r\nAs you will be in a situation to know when the leave of absence will be\r\ngranted me, which I have asked, will you be so good as to communicate\r\nit, by a line, to Mr. Lewis and Mr. Eppes? I hope to see you in the\r\nsummer, and that if you are not otherwise engaged, you will encamp with\r\nme at Monticello for a while.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere attachment, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, CXCII.--TO THOMAS PAINE, March 17,1789\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\nParis, March 17,1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you extended from December the 23rd to January the\r\n11th. A confidential opportunity now arising, I can acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of yours of January the 15th, at the date of which you could not\r\nhave received mine.\r\n\r\nYou knew, long ago, that the meeting of the States is to be at\r\nVersailles, on the 27th of April. This country is entirely occupied\r\nin its elections, which go on quietly and well. The Duke d’Orleans is\r\nelected for Villers Cotterets. The Prince of Conde has lost the election\r\nhe aimed at; nor is it certain he can be elected any where. We have\r\nno news from Auvergne, whither the Marquis de la Fayette is gone. In\r\ngeneral, all the men of influence in the country are gone into\r\nthe several provinces, to get their friends elected, or be elected\r\nthemselves. Since my letter to you, a tumult arose in Bretagne, in which\r\nfour or five lives were lost. They are now quieter, and this is the only\r\ninstance of a life lost, as yet, in this revolution. The public mind is\r\nnow so far ripened by time and discussion, that there seems to be but\r\none opinion on the principal points. The question of voting by persons\r\nor orders is the most controverted; but even that seems to have gained\r\nalready a majority among the Nobles. I fear more from the number of\r\nthe Assembly, than from any other cause. Twelve hundred persons are\r\ndifficult to keep to order, and will be so, especially, till they shall\r\nhave had time to frame rules of order. Their funds continue stationary,\r\nand at the level they have stood at for some years past. We hear\r\nso little of the parliaments for some time past, that one is hardly\r\nsensible of their existence. This unimportance is probably the\r\nforerunner of their total re-modification by the nation. The article\r\nof legislation is the only interesting one on which the court has not\r\nexplicitly declared itself to the nation. The Duke d’Orleans has given\r\ninstructions to his proxies in the _bailliages_, which would be deemed\r\nbold in England, and are reasonable beyond the reach of an Englishman,\r\nwho, slumbering under a kind of half reformation in politics and\r\nreligion, is not excited by any thing he sees or feels, to question the\r\nremains of prejudice. The writers of this country, now taking the field\r\nfreely, and unrestrained, or rather revolted by prejudice, will rouse us\r\nall from the errors in which we have been hitherto rocked.\r\n\r\nWe had, at one time, some hope, that an accommodation would have been\r\neffected between the Turks and two empires. Probably the taking Oczakow,\r\nwhile it has attached the Empress more to the Crimea, is not important\r\nenough to the Turks, to make them consent to peace. These hopes are\r\nvanishing. Nor does there seem any prospect of peace between Russia\r\nand Sweden. The palsied condition of England leaves it probable, that\r\nDenmark will pursue its hostilities against Sweden. It does not\r\nseem certain whether the King of Prussia has advanced so far in that\r\nmediation, and in the troubles he has excited in Poland, as to be\r\nobliged to become a party. Nor will his becoming a party draw in this\r\ncountry, the present year, if England remains quiet. Papers which have\r\nlately passed between this court and the government of Holland, prove\r\nthat this nourishes its discontent, and only waits to put its house in\r\norder, before it interposes. They have recalled their ambassador from\r\nthe Hague, without naming a successor. The King of Sweden, not thinking\r\nthat Russia and Denmark are enough for him, has arrested a number of his\r\nNobles, of principal rank and influence. It is a bold measure, at least,\r\nand he is too boyish a character to authorize us to presume it a wise\r\none, merely because he has adopted it. His army was before disgusted. He\r\nnow puts the Nobles and all their dependants on the same side, and they\r\nare sure of armed support, by Russia on the north, and Denmark on the\r\nsouth. He can have no salvation but in the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nI have received two letters from Ledyard, the one dated Alexandria,\r\nAugust the 15th, the other Grand Cairo, September the 10th; and one\r\nlately from Admiral Paul Jones, dated St. Petersburg, January the 31st.\r\nHe was just arrived there, on the call of the Empress, and was uncertain\r\nwhere he should be employed the next campaign. Mr. Littlepage has\r\nreturned from the Black Sea to Warsaw, where he has been perfectly\r\nreceived by the King. I saw this from under the King’s own hand, and was\r\npleased with the parental expressions towards him.\r\n\r\nWe have no news from America later than the middle of January. My\r\nletters inform me, that even the friends of the new constitution have\r\ncome over to the expediency of adding a declaration of rights. There\r\nis reason to hope that this will be proposed by Congress to the\r\nseveral legislatures, and that the plan of New York for calling a new\r\nconvention, will be rejected. Hitherto, no State had acceded to it but\r\nVirginia, in which Henry and anti-federalism had got full possession of\r\ntheir legislature. But the people are better disposed. My departure for\r\nAmerica is likely to be retarded, by the want of a Congress to give me\r\npermission. I must attend it from the new government. I am anxious\r\nto know how much we ought to believe of the recovery of the King of\r\nEngland. By putting little facts together, I see that he is not well.\r\nMr. Rumsey (who came in while I was writing the preceding page) tells me\r\nyou have a long letter ready for me. I shall be happy to receive it.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere attachment, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIII.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, March 18, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nParis, March 18, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of November the 29th, 1788, came to hand the last month. How\r\nit happened that mine of August, 1787, was fourteen months on its way,\r\nis inconceivable. I do not recollect by what conveyance I sent it. I\r\nhad concluded, however, either that it had miscarried, or that you\r\nhad become indolent, as most of our countrymen are, in matters of\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nThe change in this country since you left it, is such as you can form\r\nno idea of. The frivolities of conversation have given way entirely to\r\npolitics. Men, women, and children talk nothing else: and all, you know,\r\ntalk a great deal. The press groans with daily productions, which, in\r\npoint of boldness, make an Englishman stare, who hitherto has thought\r\nhimself the boldest of men. A complete revolution in this government,\r\nhas, within the space of two years (for it began with the _Notables_\r\nof 1787), been effected merely by the force of public opinion, aided,\r\nindeed, by the want of money, which the dissipations of the court had\r\nbrought on. And this revolution has not cost a single life, unless we\r\ncharge to it a little riot lately in Bretagne, which began about the\r\nprice of bread, became afterwards political, and ended in the loss of\r\nfour or five lives. The assembly of the States General begins the 27th\r\nof April. The representation of the people will be perfect. But they\r\nwill be alloyed by an equal number of nobility and clergy. The first\r\ngreat question they will have to decide, will be, whether they shall\r\nvote by orders or persons. And I have hopes, that the majority of the\r\nNobles are already disposed to join the _Tiers-Etat_, in deciding\r\nthat the vote shall be by persons. This is the opinion _a la mode_ at\r\npresent, and mode has acted a wonderful part in the present instance.\r\nAll the handsome young women, for example, are for the _Tiers-Etat_ and\r\nthis is an army more powerful in France, than the two hundred thousand\r\nmen of the King. Add to this, that the court itself is for the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_, as the only agent which can relieve their wants: not by\r\ngiving money themselves (they are squeezed to the last drop), but by\r\npressing it from the non-contributing orders. The King stands engaged\r\nto pretend no more to the power of laying, continuing, or appropriating\r\ntaxes; to call the States General periodically; to submit _lettres de\r\ncachet_ to legal restrictions; to consent to freedom of the press; and\r\nthat all this shall be fixed by a fundamental constitution, which\r\nshall bind his successors. He has not offered a participation in the\r\nlegislature, but it will surely be insisted on. The public mind is\r\nso ripened on all these subjects, that there seems to be now but one\r\nopinion. The clergy, indeed, think separately, and the old men among the\r\nNobles: but their voice is suppressed by the general one of the\r\nnation. The writings published on this occasion are, some of them, very\r\nvaluable; because, unfettered by the prejudices under which the English\r\nlabor, they give a full scope to reason, and strike out truths, as\r\nyet unperceived and unacknowledged on the other side the channel. An\r\nEnglishman, dozing under a kind of half reformation, is not excited\r\nto think by such gross absurdities as stare a Frenchman in the face,\r\nwherever he looks, whether it be towards the throne or the altar. In\r\nfine, I believe this nation will, in the course of the present year,\r\nhave as full a portion of liberty dealt out to them, as the nation can\r\nbear at present, considering how uninformed the mass of their people is.\r\nThis circumstance will prevent the immediate establishment of the trial\r\nby jury. The palsied state of the executive in England is a fortunate\r\ncircumstance for France, as it will give her time to arrange her\r\naffairs internally. The consolidation and funding their debts, will give\r\ngovernment a credit which will enable them to do what they please.\r\nFor the present year the war will be confined to the two empires and\r\nDenmark, against Turkey and Sweden. It is not yet evident, whether\r\nPrussia will be engaged. If the disturbances of Poland break out into\r\novert acts, it will be a power divided in itself, and so of no weight.\r\nPerhaps by the next year England and France may be ready to take the\r\nfield. It will depend on the former principally, for the latter, though\r\nshe may be then able, must wish still a little time to see her new\r\narrangements well under way. The English papers and English ministry\r\nsay the King is well. He is better, but not well: no malady requires a\r\nlonger time to insure against its return than insanity. Time alone can\r\ndistinguish accidental insanity from habitual lunacy.\r\n\r\nThe operations which have taken place in America lately fill me with\r\npleasure. In the first place, they realize the confidence I had, that,\r\nwhenever our affairs go obviously wrong, the good sense of the people\r\nwill interpose, and set them to rights. The example of changing a\r\nconstitution, by assembling the wise men of the State, instead of\r\nassembling armies, will be worth as much to the world as the former\r\nexamples we had given them. The constitution, too, which was the result\r\nof our deliberations, is unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented to\r\nmen, and some of the accommodations of interest which it has adopted\r\nare greatly pleasing to me, who have before had occasions of seeing how\r\ndifficult those interests were to accommodate. A general concurrence of\r\nopinion seems to authorize us to say it has some defects. I am one of\r\nthose who think it a defect, that the important rights, not placed in\r\nsecurity by the frame of the constitution itself, were not explicitly\r\nsecured by a supplementary declaration. There are rights which it is\r\nuseless to surrender to the government, and which governments have\r\nyet always been fond to invade. These are the rights of thinking,\r\nand publishing our thoughts by speaking or writing; the right of free\r\ncommerce; the right of personal freedom. There are instruments for\r\nadministering the government so peculiarly trust-worthy, that we\r\nshould never leave the legislature at liberty to change them. The\r\nnew constitution has secured these in the executive and legislative\r\ndepartments; but not in the judiciary. It should have established trials\r\nby the people themselves, that is to say, by jury. There are instruments\r\nso dangerous to the rights of the nation, and which place them so\r\ntotally at the mercy of their governors, that those governors, whether\r\nlegislative or executive, should be restrained from keeping such\r\ninstruments on foot, but in well defined cases. Such an instrument is a\r\nstanding army. We are now allowed to say, such a declaration of rights,\r\nas a supplement to the constitution, where that is silent, is wanting,\r\nto secure us in these points. The general voice has legitimated this\r\nobjection. It has not, however, authorized me to consider as a\r\nreal defect, what I thought, and still think one, the perpetual\r\nre-eligibility of the President. But three States out of eleven having\r\ndeclared against this, we must suppose we are wrong, according to the\r\nfundamental law of every society, the _lex majoris partis_, to which we\r\nare bound to submit. And should the majority change their opinion, and\r\nbecome sensible that this trait in their constitution is wrong, I would\r\nwish it to remain uncorrected, as long as we can avail ourselves of\r\nthe services of our great leader, whose talents and whose weight of\r\ncharacter, I consider as peculiarly necessary to get the government\r\nso under way, as that it may afterwards be carried on by subordinate\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nI must give you sincere thanks for the details of small news contained\r\nin your letter. You know how previous that kind of information is to a\r\nperson absent from his country, and how difficult it is to be procured.\r\nI hope to receive soon permission to visit America this summer, and to\r\npossess myself anew, by conversation with my countrymen, of their spirit\r\nand their ideas. I know only the Americans of the year 1784. They tell\r\nme this is to be much a stranger to those of 1789. This renewal of\r\nacquaintance is no indifferent matter to one, acting at such a\r\ndistance, as that instructions cannot be received hot and hot. One of my\r\npleasures, too, will be that of talking over the old and new with you.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, and at all times, I have the honor to be, with great\r\nand sincere esteem. Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCIV.--TO DOCTOR WILLARD, March 24, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WILLARD.\r\n\r\nParis, March 24, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have been lately honored with your letter of September the 24th, 1788,\r\naccompanied by a diploma for a Doctorate of Laws, which the University\r\nof Harvard has been pleased to confer on me. Conscious how little I\r\nmerit it, I am the more sensible of their goodness and indulgence to\r\na stranger, who has had no means ef serving or making himself known to\r\nthem. I beg you to return them my grateful thanks, and to assure them\r\nthat this notice from so eminent a seat of science is very precious to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable publications we have had in France, for a year\r\nor two past, are the following. _Les Voyages d’Anacharsis, par Abbe\r\nBarthelemi_, seven volumes, octavo. This is a very elegant digest of\r\nwhatever is known of the Greeks; useless, indeed, to him who has read\r\nthe original authors, but very proper for one who reads modern languages\r\nonly. The works of the King of Prussia. The Berlin edition is in sixteen\r\nvolumes, octavo. It is said to have been gutted at Berlin; and here\r\nit has been still more mangled. There are one or two other editions\r\npublished abroad, which pretend to have rectified the maltreatment both\r\nof Berlin and Paris. Some time will be necessary to settle the public\r\nmind as to the best edition.\r\n\r\nMontignot has given us the original Greek, and a French translation of\r\nthe seventh book of Ptolemy’s great work, under the title of _Etat des\r\nEtoiles fixes au second siecle_, in quarto. He has given the designation\r\nof the same stars by Flamsteed and Bayer, and their position in the\r\nyear 1786. A very remarkable work is the _Mechanique Analytique of La\r\nGrange_, in quarto. He is allowed to be the greatest mathematician now\r\nliving, and his personal worth is equal to his science. The object of\r\nhis work is to reduce all the principles of mechanics to the single one\r\nof the equilibrium, and to give a simple formula applicable to them\r\nall. The subject is treated in the algebraic method, without diagrams to\r\nassist the conception. My present occupations not permitting me to read\r\nany thing which requires a long and undisturbed attention, I am not able\r\nto give you the character of this work from my own examination. It has\r\nbeen received with great approbation in Europe. In Italy, the works of\r\nSpallanzani on Digestion and Generation are valuable. Though, perhaps,\r\ntoo minute, and therefore tedious, he has developed some useful truths,\r\nand his book is well worth attention; it is in four volumes, octavo.\r\nClavigero, an Italian also, who has resided thirty-six years in Mexico,\r\nhas given us a History of that country, which certainly merits more\r\nrespect than any other work on the same subject. He corrects many errors\r\nof Dr. Robertson; and though sound philosophy will disapprove many of\r\nhis ideas, we must still consider it as an useful work, and assuredly\r\nthe best we possess on the same subject. It is in four thin volumes,\r\nsmall quarto. De la Lande has not yet published a fifth volume.\r\n\r\nThe chemical dispute about the conversion and reconversion of air and\r\nwater, continues still undecided. Arguments and authorities are so\r\nbalanced, that we may still safely believe, as our fathers did before\r\nus, that these principles are distinct. A schism of another kind has\r\ntaken place among the chemists. A particular set of them here have\r\nundertaken to remodel all the terms of the science, and to give to every\r\nsubstance a new name, the composition, and especially the termination of\r\nwhich, shall define the relation in which it stands to other substances\r\nof the same family. But the science seems too much in its infancy as\r\nyet, for this reformation; because, in fact, the reformation of this\r\nyear must be reformed again the next year, and so on, changing the names\r\nof substances as often as new experiments develope properties in them\r\nundiscovered before. The new nomenclature has, accordingly, been already\r\nproved to need numerous and important reformations. Probably it will\r\nnot prevail. It is espoused by the minority only here, and by very few,\r\nindeed, of the foreign chemists. It is particularly rejected in England.\r\n\r\nIn the arts, I think two of our countrymen have presented the most\r\nimportant inventions. Mr. Paine, the author of ‘Common Sense,’ has\r\ninvented an iron bridge, which promises to be cheaper by a great deal\r\nthan stone, and to admit of a much greater arch. He supposes it may be\r\nventured for an arch of five hundred feet. He has obtained a patent for\r\nit in England, and is now executing the first experiment with an arch\r\nof between ninety and one hundred feet. Mr. Rumsey has also obtained\r\na patent for his navigation by the force of steam in England, and is\r\nsoliciting a similar one here. His principal merit is in the improvement\r\nof the boiler, and instead of the complicated machinery of oars and\r\npaddles, proposed by others, the substitution of so simple a thing\r\nas the reaction of a stream of water on his vessel. He is building\r\na sea-vessel at this time in England, and she will be ready for an\r\nexperiment in May. He has suggested a great number of mechanical\r\nimprovements in a variety of branches, and, upon the whole, is the most\r\noriginal and the greatest mechanical genius I have ever seen. The return\r\nof La Peyrouse (whenever that shall happen) will probably add to our\r\nknowledge in Geography, Botany, and Natural History. What a field have\r\nwe at our doors to signalize ourselves in! The Botany of America is\r\nfar from being exhausted, its Mineralogy is untouched, and its Natural\r\nHistory or Zoology totally mistaken and misrepresented. As far as I have\r\nseen, there is not one single species of terrestrial birds common to\r\nEurope and America, and I question if there be a single species of\r\nquadrupeds. (Domestic animals are to be excepted.) It is for such\r\ninstitutions as that over which you preside so worthily, Sir, to do\r\njustice to our country, its productions, and its genius. It is the work\r\nto which the young men, whom you are forming, should lay their hands.\r\nWe have spent the prime of our lives in procuring them the precious\r\nblessing of liberty. Let them spend theirs in showing that it is the\r\ngreat parent of science and of virtue; and that a nation will be great\r\nin both, always in proportion as it is free. Nobody wishes more warmly\r\nfor the success of your good exhortations on this subject, than he who\r\nhas the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCV.--TO J. SARSFIELD, April 3, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. SARSFIELD.\r\n\r\nParis, April 3, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI could not name to you the day of my departure from Paris, because I\r\ndo not know it. I have not yet received my _congé_, though I hope to\r\nreceive it soon, and to leave this some time in May, so that I may be\r\nback before the winter.\r\n\r\nImpost is a duty paid on any imported article, in the moment of its\r\nimportation, and of course, it is collected in the sea-ports only.\r\nExcise is a duty on any article, whether imported or raised at home,\r\nand paid in the hands of the consumer or retailer; consequently, it is\r\ncollected through the whole country. These are the true definitions of\r\nthese words as used in England, and in the greater part of the United\r\nStates. But in Massachusetts, they have perverted the word excise to\r\nmean a tax on all liquors, whether paid in the moment of importation or\r\nat a later moment, and on nothing else. So that in reading the debates\r\nof the Massachusetts convention, you must give this last meaning to the\r\nword excise.\r\n\r\nRotation is the change of officers required by the laws at certain\r\nepochs, and in a certain order: thus, in Virginia, our justices of the\r\npeace are made sheriffs one after the other, each remaining in office\r\ntwo years, and then yielding it to his next brother in order of\r\nseniority. This is the just and classical meaning of the word. But in\r\nAmerica we have extended it (for want of a proper word) to all cases of\r\nofficers who must be necessarily changed at a fixed epoch, though the\r\nsuccessor be not pointed out in any particular order, but comes in\r\nby free election. By the term rotation in office, then, we mean an\r\nobligation on the holder of that office to go out at a certain period.\r\nIn our first Confederation, the principle of rotation was established\r\nin the office of President of Congress, who could serve but one year in\r\nthree, and in that of a member of Congress, who could serve but three\r\nyears in six.\r\n\r\nI believe all the countries in Europe determine their standard of money,\r\nin gold as well as silver. Thus, the laws of England direct that a pound\r\nTroy of gold, of twenty-two carats fine, shall be cut into forty-four\r\nand a half guineas, each of which shall be worth twenty-one and a\r\nhalf shillings, that is, into 956 3/4 shillings. This establishes the\r\nshilling at 5.518 grains of pure gold. They direct that a pound of\r\nsilver, consisting of 11 1/10 ounces of pure silver, and 9/10 of an\r\nounce alloy, shall be cut into sixty-two shillings. This establishes\r\nthe shilling at 85.93 grains of pure silver, and, consequently, the\r\nproportion of gold to silver as 85.93 to 5.518, or as 15.57 to 1. If\r\nthis be the true proportion between the value of gold and silver at the\r\ngeneral market of Europe, then the value of the shilling, depending\r\non two standards, is the same, whether a payment be made in gold or\r\nin silver. But if the proportion at the general market of Europe be as\r\nfifteen to one, then the Englishman who owes a pound weight of gold\r\nat Amsterdam, if he sends the pound of gold to pay it, sends 1043.72\r\nshillings; if he sends fifteen pounds of silver, he sends only 1030.5\r\nshillings; if he pays half in gold and half in silver, he pays only\r\n1037.11 shillings. And this medium between the two standards of gold\r\nand silver, we must consider as furnishing the true medium value of\r\nthe shilling. If the parliament should now order the pound of gold (of\r\none-twelfth alloy as before) to be cut into a thousand shillings instead\r\nof nine hundred and fifty-six and three fourths, leaving the silver as\r\nit is, the medium or true value of the shilling would suffer a change of\r\nhalf the difference; and in the case before stated, to pay a debt of a\r\npound weight of gold, at Amsterdam, if he sent the pound weight of gold,\r\nhe would send 1090.9 shillings; if he sent fifteen pounds of silver,\r\nhe would send 1030.5 shillings; if half in gold and half in silver,\r\nhe would send 1060.7 shillings; which shows, that this parliamentary\r\noperation would reduce the value of the shilling in the proportion of\r\n1060.7 to 1037.11.\r\n\r\nNow this is exactly the effect of the late change in the quantity of\r\ngold contained in your louis. Your _marc d’argent fin_ is cut into 53.45\r\nlivres (fifty-three livres and nine sous), the _marc de l’or fin_\r\nwas cut, heretofore, by law, into 784.6 livres (seven hundred and\r\neighty-four livres and twelve sous); gold was to silver, then, as 14.63\r\nto 1. And if this was different from the proportion at the markets of\r\nEurope, the true value of your livre stood half way between the two\r\nstandards. By the ordinance of October the 30th, 1785, the marc of pure\r\ngold has been cut into 828.6 livres. If your standard had been in gold\r\nalone, this would have reduced the value of the livre, in the proportion\r\nof 828.6 to 784.6. But as you had a standard of silver as well as gold,\r\nthe true standard is the medium between the two; consequently, the value\r\nof the livre is reduced only one half the difference, that is, as 806.6\r\nto 784.6, which is very nearly three per cent. Commerce, however, has\r\nmade a difference of four per cent., the average value of the pound\r\nsterling, formerly twenty-four livres, being now twenty-five livres.\r\nPerhaps some other circumstance has occasioned an addition of one per\r\ncent, to the change of your standard.\r\n\r\nI fear I have tired you by these details. I did not mean to be so\r\nlengthy when I began. I beg you to consider them as an appeal to your\r\njudgment, which I value, and from which I will expect a correction, if\r\nthey are wrong.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great esteem and attachment, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCVI.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, May 6,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, May 6,1789.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nAs it becomes more and more possible that the _Noblesse_ will go\r\nwrong, I become uneasy for you. Your principles are decidedly with the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_, and your instructions against them. A complaisance to the\r\nlatter on some occasions, and an adherence to the former on others, may\r\ngive an appearance of trimming between the two parties, which may lose\r\nyou both. You will, in the end, go over wholly to the _Tiers-Etat_,\r\nbecause it will be impossible for you to live in a constant sacrifice of\r\nyour own sentiments to the prejudices of the _Noblesse_. But you would\r\nbe received by the _Tiers-Etat_, at any future day, coldly, and without\r\nconfidence. This appears to me the moment to take at once that honest\r\nand manly stand with them, which your own principles dictate. This will\r\nwin their hearts for ever, be approved by the world, which marks and\r\nhonors you as the man of the people, and will be an eternal consolation\r\nto yourself. The _Noblesse_, and especially the _Noblesse of Auvergne_,\r\nwill always prefer men who will do their dirty work for them. You are\r\nnot made for that. They will therefore soon drop you, and the people, in\r\nthat case, will perhaps not take you up. Suppose a scission should take\r\nplace. The Priests and Nobles will secede, the nation will remain in\r\nplace, and, with the King, will do its own business. If violence should\r\nbe attempted, where will you be? You cannot then take side with the\r\npeople in opposition to your own vote, that very vote which will have\r\nhelped to produce the scission. Still less can you array yourself\r\nagainst the people. That is impossible. Your instructions are indeed\r\na difficulty. But to state this at its worst, it is only a single\r\ndifficulty, which a single effort surmounts. Your instructions can never\r\nembarrass you a second time, whereas an acquiescence under them will\r\nre-produce greater difficulties every day, and without end. Besides, a\r\nthousand circumstances offer as many justifications of your departure\r\nfrom your instructions. Will it be impossible to persuade all parties,\r\nthat (as for good legislation two Houses are necessary) the placing\r\nthe privileged classes together in one House, and the unprivileged in\r\nanother, would be better for both than a scission? I own I think it\r\nwould. People can never agree without some sacrifices; and it appears\r\nbut a moderate sacrifice in each party, to meet on this middle ground.\r\nThe attempt to bring this about might satisfy your instructions, and a\r\nfailure in it would justify your siding with the people, even to those\r\nwho think instructions are laws of conduct. Forgive me, my dear friend,\r\nif my anxiety for you makes me talk of things I know nothing about.\r\nYou must not consider this as advice. I know you and myself too well\r\nto presume to offer advice. Receive it merely as the expression of my\r\nuneasiness, and the effusion of that sincere friendship, with which I\r\nam, my dear Sir, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCVII.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, May 8, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, May 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of January the 26th, to March the 27th, is duly received, and\r\nI thank you for the interesting papers it contained. The answer of\r\nDon Ulloa, however, on the subject of the canal through the American\r\nisthmus, was not among them, though mentioned to be so. If you have\r\nomitted it through accident, I shall thank you for it at some future\r\noccasion, as I wish much to understand that subject thoroughly. Our\r\nAmerican information comes down to the 16th of March. There had not yet\r\nbeen members enough assembled of the new Congress, to open the tickets.\r\nThey expected to do it in a day or two. In the mean time, it was said\r\nfrom all the States, that their vote had been unanimous for General\r\nWashington, and a good majority in favor of Mr. Adams, who is certainly,\r\ntherefore, Vice-President. The new government would be supported by very\r\ncordial and very general dispositions in its favor from the people. I\r\nhave not yet seen a list of the new Congress. This delay in the meeting\r\nof the new government has delayed the determination on my petition for\r\nleave of absence. However, I expect to receive it every day, and am in\r\nreadiness to sail the instant I receive it, so that this is probably\r\nthe last letter I shall write you hence, till my return. While there,\r\nI shall avail government of the useful information I have received from\r\nyou, and shall not fail to profit of any good occasion which may occur,\r\nto show the difference between your real situation, and what it ought to\r\nbe. I consider Paris and Madrid as the two only points, at which Europe\r\nand America should touch closely, and that a connection at these points\r\nshould be fostered.\r\n\r\nWe have had in this city a very considerable riot, in which about one\r\nhundred people have been probably killed. It was the most unprovoked,\r\nand is therefore, justly, the most unpitied catastrophe of that kind\r\nI ever knew. Nor did the wretches know what they wanted, except to do\r\nmischief. It seems to have had no particular connection with the great\r\nnational question now in agitation. The want of bread is very seriously\r\ndreaded through the whole kingdom. Between twenty and thirty ship-loads\r\nof wheat and flour has already arrived from the United States, and there\r\nwill be about the same quantity of rice sent from Charleston to this\r\ncountry directly, of which about half has arrived. I presume that,\r\nbetween wheat and rice, one hundred ship-loads may be counted on in the\r\nwhole from us. Paris consumes about a ship-load a day, (say two hundred\r\nand fifty tons.) The total supply of the West Indies, for this year,\r\nrests with us, and there is almost a famine in Canada and Nova Scotia.\r\nThe States General were opened the day before yesterday. Viewing it as\r\nan opera, it was imposing; as a scene of business, the King’s speech was\r\nexactly what it should have been, and very well delivered; not a word\r\nof the Chancellor’s was heard by any body, so that, as yet, I have never\r\nheard a single guess at what it was about. Mr. Necker’s was as good as\r\nsuch a number of details would permit it to be. The picture of their\r\nresources was consoling, and generally plausible. I could have wished\r\nhim to have dwelt more on those great constitutional reformations, which\r\nhis _Rapport au Roy_ had prepared us to expect. But they observe, that\r\nthese points are proper for the speech of the Chancellor. We are in\r\nhopes, therefore, they were in that speech, which, like the Revelations\r\nof St. John, were no revelations at all. The _Noblesse_, on coming\r\ntogether, show that they are not as much reformed in their principles\r\nas we had hoped they would be. In fact, there is real danger of their\r\ntotally refusing to vote by persons. Some found hopes on the lower\r\nclergy, which constitute four-fifths of the deputies of that order. If\r\nthey do not turn the balance in favor of the _Tiers-Etat_, there is\r\nreal danger of a scission. But I shall not consider even that event\r\nas rendering things desperate. If the King will do business with the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_, which constitutes the nation, it may be well done without\r\nPriests or Nobles. From the best information I can obtain, the King\r\nof England’s madness has terminated in an imbecility, which may very\r\npossibly be of long continuance. He is going with his Queen to Germany.\r\nEngland chained to rest, the other parts of Europe may recover or retain\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCVIII.--TO JOHN JAY, May 9, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, May 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSince my letter of March the 1st, by the way of Havre, and those of\r\nMarch the 12th and 15th, by the way of London, no opportunity of writing\r\nhas occurred, till the present to London.\r\n\r\nThere are no symptoms of accommodation between the Turks and two\r\nempires, nor between Russia and Sweden. The Emperor was, on the 16th of\r\nthe last month, expected to die, certainly; he was, however, a little\r\nbetter when the last news came away, so that hopes were entertained of\r\nhim; but it is agreed that he cannot get the better of his complaints\r\nultimately, so that his life is not at all counted on. The Danes\r\nprofess, as yet, to do no more against Sweden than furnish their\r\nstipulated aid. The agitation of Poland is still violent, though\r\nsomewhat moderated by the late change in the demeanor of the King of\r\nPrussia. He is much less thrasonic than he was. This is imputed to the\r\nturn which the English politics may be rationally expected to take. It\r\nis very difficult to get at the true state of the British King j but\r\nfrom the best information we can get, his madness has gone off, but he\r\nis left in a state of imbecility and melancholy. They are going to carry\r\nhim to Hanover, to see whether such a journey may relieve him. The Queen\r\naccompanies him. If England. should, by this accident, be reduced to\r\ninactivity, the southern countries of Europe may escape the present\r\nwar. Upon the whole, the prospect for the present year, if no unforeseen\r\naccident happens, is certain peace for the powers not already engaged,\r\na probability that Denmark will not become a principal, and a mere\r\npossibility that Sweden and Russia may be accommodated. The interior\r\ndisputes of Sweden are so exactly detailed in the Leyden gazette, that I\r\nhave nothing to add on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of this country has advanced thus far without\r\nencountering any thing which deserves to be called a difficulty. There\r\nhave been riots in a few instances, in three or four different places,\r\nin which there may have been a dozen or twenty lives lost. The exact\r\ntruth is not be got at. A few days ago, a much more serious riot took\r\nplace in this city, in which it became necessary for the troops to\r\nengage in regular action with the mob, and probably about one hundred of\r\nthe latter were killed. Accounts vary from twenty to two hundred. They\r\nwere the most abandoned banditti of Paris, and never was a riot more\r\nunprovoked and unpitied. They began, under a pretence that a paper\r\nmanufacturer had proposed in an assembly, to reduce their wages to\r\nfifteen sous a day. They rifled his house, destroyed every thing in his\r\nmagazines and shops, and were only stopped in their career of mischief,\r\nby the carnage above mentioned. Neither this nor any other of the riots,\r\nhave had a professed connection with the great national reformation\r\ngoing on. They are such as have happened every year since I have been\r\nhere, and as will continue to be produced by common incidents. The\r\nStates General were opened on the 4th instant, by a speech from the\r\nthrone, one by the _Garde des Sceaux_, and one from Mr. Necker. I hope\r\nthey will be printed in time to send you herewith: lest they should not,\r\nI will observe, that that of Mr, Necker stated the real and ordinary\r\ndeficit to be fifty-six millions, and that he showed that this could\r\nbe made up without a new tax, by economies and bonifications which he\r\nspecified. Several articles of the latter are liable to the objection,\r\nthat they are proposed on branches of the revenue, of which the nation\r\nhas demanded a suppression. He tripped too lightly over the great\r\narticles of constitutional reformation, these being not as clearly\r\nannounced in this discourse as they were in his _Rapport au Roy_, which\r\nI sent you some time ago. On the whole, his discourse has not satisfied\r\nthe patriotic party. It is now, for the first time, that their\r\nrevolution is likely to receive a serious check, and begins to wear a\r\nfearful appearance. The progress of light and liberality in the order\r\nof the _Noblesse_ has equalled expectation in Paris only, and its\r\nvicinities. The great mass of deputies of that order, which come from\r\nthe country, show that the habits of tyranny over the people, are\r\ndeeply rooted in them. They will consent, indeed, to equal taxation; but\r\nfive-sixths of that chamber are thought to be, decidedly, for voting\r\nby orders; so that, had this great preliminary question rested on this\r\nbody, which formed heretofore the sole hope, that hope would have been\r\ncompletely disappointed. Some aid, however, comes in from a quarter\r\nwhence none was expected. It was imagined the ecclesiastical elections\r\nwould have been generally in favor of the higher clergy; on the\r\ncontrary, the lower clergy have obtained five-sixths of these\r\ndeputations. These are the sons of peasants, who have done all the\r\ndrudgery of the service, for ten, twenty, and thirty guineas a year, and\r\nwhose oppressions and penury, contrasted with the pride and luxury of\r\nthe higher clergy, have rendered them perfectly disposed to humble the\r\nlatter. They have done it, in many instances, with a boldness they were\r\nthought insusceptible of. Great hopes have been formed, that these would\r\nconcur with the _Tiers-Etat_, in voting by persons. In fact, about half\r\nof them seem as yet so disposed; but the bishops are intriguing, and\r\ndrawing them over with the address which has ever marked ecclesiastical\r\nintrigue. The deputies of the _Tiers-Etat_ seem, almost to a man,\r\ninflexibly determined against the vote by orders. This is the state of\r\nparties, as well as can be judged from conversation only, during the\r\nfortnight they have been now together. But as no business has been yet\r\nbegun, no votes as yet taken, this calculation cannot be considered\r\nas sure. A middle proposition is talked of, to form the two privileged\r\norders into one chamber. It is thought more possible to bring them\r\ninto it, than the _Tiers-Etat_. Another proposition is, to distinguish\r\nquestions, referring those of certain descriptions to a vote by persons,\r\nothers to a vote by orders. This seems to admit of endless altercation,\r\nand the _Tiers-Etat_ manifest no respect for that, or any other\r\nmodification whatever. Were this single question accommodated, I am of\r\nopinion, there would not occur the least difficulty in the great and\r\nessential points of constitutional reformation. But on this preliminary\r\nquestion the parties are so irreconcilable, that it is impossible to\r\nforesee what issue it will have. The _Tiers-Etat_, as constituting the\r\nnation, may propose to do the business of the nation, either with or\r\nwithout the minorities in the Houses of Clergy and Nobles, which side\r\nwith them. In that case, if the King should agree to it, the majorities\r\nin those two Houses would secede, and might resist the tax-gatherers.\r\nThis would bring on a civil war. On the other hand, the privileged\r\norders, offering to submit to equal taxation, may propose to the King\r\nto continue the government in its former train, resuming to himself\r\nthe power of taxation. Here, the tax-gatherers might be resisted by\r\nthe people. In fine, it is but too possible, that between parties so\r\nanimated, the King may incline the balance as he pleases. Happy that he\r\nis an honest, unambitious man, who desires neither money nor power for\r\nhimself; and that his most operative minister, though he has appeared to\r\ntrim a little, is still, in the main, a friend to public liberty.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you in a former letter, the construction which\r\nour bankers at Amsterdam had put on the resolution of Congress,\r\nappropriating the last Dutch loan, by which the money for our captives\r\nwould not be furnished till the end of the year 1790. Orders from the\r\nboard of treasury have now settled this question. The interest of\r\nthe next month is to be first paid, and after that, the money for the\r\ncaptives and foreign officers is to be furnished, before any other\r\npayment of interest. This insures it when the next February interest\r\nbecomes payable. My representations to them, on account of the contracts\r\nI had entered into for making the medals, have produced from them the\r\nmoney for that object, which is lodged in the hands of Mr. Grand.\r\n\r\nMr. Necker, in his discourse, proposes among his bonifications of\r\nrevenue, the suppression of our two free ports of Bayonne and L’Orient,\r\nwhich, he says, occasion a loss of six hundred thousand livres annually,\r\nto the crown, by contraband. (The speech being not yet printed, I state\r\nthis only as it struck my ear when he delivered it. If I have mistaken\r\nit, I beg you to receive this as my apology, and to consider what\r\nfollows, as written on that idea only.) I have never been able to see\r\nthat these free ports were worth one copper to us. To Bayonne our trade\r\nnever went, and it is leaving L’Orient. Besides, the right of _entrepot_\r\nis a perfect substitute for the right of free port. The latter is a\r\nlittle less troublesome only, to the merchants and captains. I should\r\nthink, therefore, that a thing so useless to us and prejudicial to them\r\nmight be relinquished by us, on the common principles of friendship.\r\nI know the merchants of these ports will make a clamor, because the\r\nfranchise covers their contraband with all the world. Has Monsieur\r\nde Moustier said any thing to you on this subject? It has never been\r\nmentioned to me. If not mentioned in either way, it is rather an\r\nindecent proceeding, considering that this right of free port is founded\r\nin treaty. I shall ask of M. de Montmorin, on the first occasion,\r\nwhether he has communicated this to you through his minister; and if he\r\nhas not, I will endeavor to notice the infraction to him in such manner,\r\nas neither to reclaim nor abandon the right of free port, but leave our\r\ngovernment free to do either.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France and Leyden, as usual, will accompany this. I am\r\nin hourly expectation of receiving from you my leave of absence, and\r\nkeep my affairs so arranged, that I can leave Paris within eight days\r\nafter receiving the permission.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\n\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXCIX.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, May 10, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, May 10, 1780,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge, the honor of your two letters of November the\r\n27th and February the 13th, both of which have come to hand since my\r\nlast to you of December the 4th and 5th. The details you are so good as\r\nto give me on the subject of the navigation of the waters of the Potomac\r\nand Ohio, are very pleasing to me, as I consider the union of those two\r\nrivers, as among the strongest links of connection between the eastern\r\nand western sides of our confederacy. It will, moreover, add to the\r\ncommerce of Virginia, in particular, all the upper parts of the Ohio and\r\nits waters. Another vast object, and of much less difficulty, is to add\r\nalso, all the country on the lakes and their waters. This would enlarge\r\nour field immensely, and would certainly be effected by an union of\r\nthe upper waters of the Ohio and lake Erie. The Big Beaver and Cayahoga\r\noffer the most direct line, and according to information I received from\r\nGeneral Hand, and which I had the honor of writing you in the year 1783,\r\nthe streams in that neighborhood head in lagoons, and the country is\r\nflat. With respect to the doubts which you say are entertained by\r\nsome, whether the upper waters of Potomac can be rendered capable of\r\nnavigation, on account of the falls and rugged banks, they are answered,\r\nby observing, that it is reduced to a maxim, that whenever there is\r\nwater enough to float a batteau, there may be navigation for a batteau.\r\nCanals and locks may be necessary, and they are expensive; but I\r\nhardly know what expense would be too great for the object in question.\r\nProbably, negotiation with the Indians, perhaps even settlement, must\r\nprecede the execution of the Cayahoga canal. The States of Maryland\r\nand Virginia should make a common object of it. The navigation, again,\r\nbetween Elizabeth River and the Sound is of vast importance, and in\r\nmy opinion, it is much better that these should be done at public than\r\nprivate expense.\r\n\r\nThough we have not heard of the actual opening of the new Congress,\r\nand consequently, have not official information of your election as\r\nPresident of the United States, yet, as there never could be a doubt\r\nentertained of it, permit me to express here my felicitations, not\r\nto yourself, but to my country. Nobody who has tried both public and\r\nprivate life, can doubt but that you were much happier on the banks of\r\nthe Potomac than you will be at New York. But there was nobody so well\r\nqualified as yourself, to put our new machine into a regular course of\r\naction; nobody, the authority of whose name could have so effectually\r\ncrushed opposition at home, and produced respect abroad. I am sensible\r\nof the immensity of the sacrifice on your part. Your measure of fame was\r\nfull to the brim; and therefore, you have nothing to gain. But there are\r\ncases wherein it is a duty to risk all against nothing, and I believe\r\nthis was exactly the case. We may presume, too, according to every rule\r\nof probability, that after doing a great deal of good, you will be found\r\nto have lost nothing but private repose.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mr. Jay, of the 19th of November, I asked a leave of\r\nabsence to carry my children back to their own country, and to settle\r\nvarious matters of a private nature, which were left unsettled, because\r\nI had no idea of being absent so long. I expected that letter would have\r\nbeen received in time to be decided on by the government then existing.\r\nI know now that it would arrive when there was no Congress, and\r\nconsequently, that if must have awaited your arrival at New York. I hope\r\nyou found the request not an unreasonable one. I am excessively anxious\r\nto receive the permission without delay, that I may be able to get back\r\nbefore the winter sets in. Nothing can be so dreadful to me, as to be\r\nshivering at sea for two or three months, in a winter passage. Besides,\r\nthere has never been a moment at which the presence of a minister here\r\ncould be so well dispensed with, from certainty of no war this summer,\r\nand that the government will be so totally absorbed in domestic\r\narrangements, as to attend to nothing exterior. Mr. Jay will, of course,\r\ncommunicate to you some ciphered letters lately written, and one of\r\nthis date. My public letter to him contains all the interesting public\r\ndetails. I enclose with the present, some extracts of a letter from Mr.\r\nPaine, which he desired me to communicate: your knowledge of the writer\r\nwill justify my giving you the trouble of these communications, which\r\ntheir interesting nature and his respectability will jointly recommend\r\nto notice. I am in great pain for the Marquis de la Fayette. His\r\nprinciples, you know, are clearly with the people; but having been\r\nelected for the _Noblesse_ of Auvergne, they have laid him under express\r\ninstructions to vote for the decision by orders and not persons. This\r\nwould ruin him with the _Tiers-Etat_, and it is not possible he could\r\ncontinue long to give satisfaction to the _Noblesse_. I have not\r\nhesitated to press on him to burn his instructions, and follow his\r\nconscience as the only sure clue, which will eternally guide a man clear\r\nof all doubts and inconsistencies. If he cannot effect a conciliatory\r\nplan, he will surely take his stand manfully at once with the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_. He will in that case be what he pleases with them, and\r\nI am in hopes that base is now too solid to render it dangerous to be\r\nmounted on it. In hopes of being able, in the course of the summer, to\r\npay my respects to you personally in New York, I have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [Extract of the letter from Thomas Paine, referred to in the\r\n     preceding, to General Washington.]\r\n\r\n‘London, March the 12th, 1789. I do not think it is worth while for\r\nCongress to appoint any minister at this court. The greater distance\r\nCongress observes on this point, the better. It will be all money thrown\r\naway to go to any expense about it, at least during the present reign. I\r\nknow the nation well, and the line of acquaintance I am in enables me\r\nto judge better on this matter than any other American can judge,\r\nespecially at a distance. I believe I am not so much in the good\r\ngraces of the Marquis of Lansdowne as I used to be. I do not answer his\r\npurpose. He was always talking of a sort of re-connection of England\r\nand America, and my coldness and reserve on this subject checked\r\ncommunication. I believe he would be a good minister for England, with\r\nrespect to a better agreement with France.’\r\n\r\n(Same letter continued) ‘April 10. The acts for regulating the trade\r\nwith America are to be continued as last year. A paper from the Privy\r\nCouncil respecting the American fly is before parliament. I had some\r\nconversation with Sir Joseph Banks upon this subject, as he was the\r\nperson whom the Privy Council referred to. I told him that the Hessian\r\nfly attacked only the green plant, and did not exist in the dry grain.\r\nHe said, that with respect to the Hessian fly they had no apprehension,\r\nbut it was the weevil they alluded to. I told him the weevil had always,\r\nmore or less, been in the wheat countries of America, and that if the\r\nprohibition was on that account, it was as necessary fifty or sixty\r\nyears ago as now; that I believed it was only a political manœuvre of\r\nthe ministry to please the landed interest, as a balance for prohibiting\r\nthe exportation of wool, to please the manufacturing interest. He did\r\nnot reply, and as we are on very sociable terms, I went farther, by\r\nsaying, the English ought not to complain of the non-payment of debts\r\nfrom America, while they prohibit the means of payment. I suggest to you\r\na thought on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe debts due before the war ought to be distinguished from the debts\r\ncontracted since, and all and every mode of payment and remittance under\r\nwhich they might have been discharged at the time they were contracted,\r\nought to accompany those debts so long as any of them shall continue\r\nunpaid, because the circumstances of payment became united with the\r\ndebt, and cannot be separated by subsequent acts of one side only. If\r\nthis was taken up in America, and insisted on as a right coeval\r\nwith, and inseparable from those debts, it would force some of the\r\nrestrictions here to give way. While writing this, I am informed that\r\nthe minister has had a conference with some of the American creditors,\r\nand proposed to them to assume the debts, and give them ten shillings\r\nin the pound. The conjecture is, that he means, when the new Congress\r\nis established, to demand the payment. If you are writing to General\r\nWashington, it may not be amiss to mention this, and if I hear further\r\non this matter, I will inform you. But as, being a money matter, it\r\ncannot come forward but through parliament; there will be notice given\r\nof the business. This would be a proper time to show that the British\r\nacts since the peace militate against the payment, by narrowing\r\nthe means by which those debts might have been paid when they were\r\ncontracted, and which ought to be considered as constituent parts of the\r\ncontract.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CC.--TO JAMES MADISON, May 11,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, May 11,1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 15th of March. I am now in hourly expectation\r\nof receiving my leave of absence. The delay of it a little longer will\r\nendanger the throwing my return into the winter, the very idea of which\r\nis horror itself to me. I am in hopes this is the last letter I shall\r\nhave the pleasure of writing you before my departure.\r\n\r\nThe madness of the King of England has gone off, but left him in a state\r\nof imbecility and melancholy. They talk of carrying him to Hanover. If\r\nthey do, it will be a proof he does not mend, and that they take that\r\nmeasure, to authorize them to establish a regency. But if he grows\r\nbetter, they will perhaps keep him at home, to avoid the question, Who\r\nshall be regent? As that country cannot be relied on in the present\r\nstate of its executive, the King of Prussia has become more moderate; he\r\nthrows cold water on the fermentation he had excited in Poland. The King\r\nof Sweden will act as nobody, not even himself, can foresee; because he\r\nacts from the caprice of the moment, and because the discontents of\r\nhis army and nobles may throw him under internal difficulties, while\r\nstruggling with external ones. Denmark will probably only furnish\r\nits stipulated aid to Russia. France is fully occupied with internal\r\narrangements. So that, on the whole, the prospect of this summer is,\r\nthat the war will continue between the powers actually engaged in the\r\nclose of the last campaign, and extend to no others; certainly it will\r\nnot extend, this year, to the southern States of Europe. The revolution\r\nof France has gone on with the most unexampled success, hitherto. There\r\nhave been some mobs, occasioned by the want of bread, in different parts\r\nof the kingdom, in which there may have been some lives lost; perhaps a\r\ndozen or twenty. These had no professed connection, generally, with the\r\nconstitutional revolution. A more serious riot happened lately in Paris,\r\nin which about one hundred of the mob were killed. This execution has\r\nbeen universally approved, as they seemed to have no view but mischief\r\nand plunder. But the meeting of the States General presents serious\r\ndifficulties, which it had been hoped the progress of reason would have\r\nenabled them to get over. The nobility of and about Paris have come\r\nover, as was expected, to the side of the people, in the great question\r\nof voting by persons or orders. This had induced a presumption, that\r\nthose of the country were making the same progress, and these form the\r\ngreat mass of the deputies of that order. But they are found to be where\r\nthey were centuries ago, as to their disposition to keep distinct from\r\nthe people, and even to tyrannize over them. They agree, indeed, to\r\nabandon their pecuniary privileges. The clergy seem at present much\r\ndivided. Five-sixths of that representation consists of the lower\r\nclergy, who, being the sons of the peasantry, are very well with the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_. But the Bishops are intriguing, and drawing them over\r\ndaily. The _Tiers-Etat_ is so firm to vote by persons or to go home,\r\nthat it is impossible to conjecture what will be the result. This is the\r\nstate of parties, as well as we can conjecture from the conversation of\r\nthe members; for as yet no vote has been given, which will enable us to\r\ncalculate on certain ground.\r\n\r\nHaving formerly written to you on the subject of our finances, I enclose\r\nyou now an abstract of a paper on that subject, which Gouverneur Morris\r\ncommunicated to me. You will be a better judge of its merit than I am.\r\nIt seems to me worthy good attention.\r\n\r\nI have a box of books packed for you, which I shall carry to Havre,\r\nand send by any ship bound to New York or Philadelphia. I have been so\r\ninexact, as to take no list of them before nailing up the box. Be so\r\ngood as to do this, and I will take with me my bookseller’s account,\r\nwhich will enable us to make a statement of them. They are chiefly\r\n_Encyclopédies_, from the 23rd to the 30th _livraison_. Paul Jones has\r\ndesired me to send to yourself and Colonel Carrington each, his bust.\r\nThey are packed together in the same box. There are three other boxes,\r\nwith two in each, for other gentlemen. I shall send them all together,\r\nand take the liberty of addressing them to you. I rejoice extremely to\r\nhear you are elected, in spite of all cabals. I fear your post will not\r\npermit me to see you but in New York, and consequently for a short time\r\nonly. I shall much regret this.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of sincere attachment and respect, Dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCI.--TO MONSIEUR DE PONTIERE, May 17, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE PONTIERE.\r\n\r\nParis, May 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am honored with your letter of the 6th instant, and am sincerely sorry\r\nthat you should experience inconveniences for the want of the arrearages\r\ndue to you from the United States. I have never ceased to take every\r\nmeasure, which could promise to procure to the foreign officers the\r\npayment of these arrears. At present the matter stands thus. Congress\r\nhave agreed to borrow a sum of money in Holland, to enable them to pay\r\nthe individual demands in Europe. They have given orders that these\r\narrearages shall be paid out of this money, when borrowed, and certain\r\nbankers in Amsterdam are charged to borrow the money. I am myself of\r\nopinion, they will certainly procure the money in the course of the\r\npresent year; but it is not for me to affirm this, nor to make any\r\nengagement. The moment the money is ready, it shall be made known\r\nto Colonel Gourion, who, at the desire of many of the officers, has\r\nundertaken to communicate with me on the subject, and to inform them,\r\nfrom time to time, of the progress of this business. He will readily\r\nanswer your letters on this subject. I depart in a few days for America,\r\nbut shall leave such instructions here, as that this matter will suffer\r\nno delay on that account.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be. Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCII.--TO MR. VAUGHAN, May 17, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nParis, May 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge, all together, the receipt of your favors of March\r\nthe 17th, 26th, and May the 7th, and to return you abundant thanks for\r\nyour attention to the article of dry rice, and the parcel of seeds you\r\nsent me. This is interesting, because, even should it not take place\r\nof the wet rice, in South Carolina, it will enable us to cultivate this\r\ngrain in Virginia, where we have not lands disposed for the wet rice.\r\nThe collection of the works of Monsieur de Poivre has not, as I believe,\r\nbeen ever published. It could hardly have escaped my knowledge, if they\r\nhad been ever announced. The French translation of the book on trade has\r\nnot yet come to my hands. Whenever I receive the copies, they shall be\r\ndistributed, and principally among the members of the _Etats Generaux_.\r\nI doubt whether, at this session, they will take up the subject of\r\ncommerce. Whenever they do, they will find better principles no where\r\nthan in that book. I spoke with Mr. Stewart yesterday on the subject of\r\nthe distribution, and if I should be gone before the books come to\r\nhand, he will execute the commission. Your nation is very far from the\r\nliberality that treatise inculcates. The proposed regulation on the\r\nsubject of our wheat is one proof. The prohibition of it in England\r\nwould, of itself, be of no great moment, because I do not know that\r\nit is much sent there. But it is the publishing a libel on our wheat,\r\nsanctioned with the name of parliament, and which can have no object but\r\nto do us injury, by spreading a groundless alarm in those countries of\r\nEurope where our wheat is constantly and kindly received. It is a mere\r\nassassination. If the insect they pretend to fear, be the Hessian fly,\r\nit never existed in the grain. If it be the weevil, our grain always\r\nhad that; and the experience of a century has proved, that either the\r\nclimate of England is not warm enough to hatch the egg and continue the\r\nrace, or that some other unknown cause prevents any evil from it. How\r\ndifferent from this spirit, my dear Sir, has been your readiness to help\r\nus to the dry rice, to communicate to us the bread tree, &tc. Will any\r\nof our climates admit the cultivation of the latter? I am too little\r\nacquainted with it to judge. I learn that your newspapers speak of the\r\ndeath of Ledyard, at Grand Cairo. I am anxious to know whether there be\r\nfoundation for this. I have not yet had time to try the execution of\r\nthe wood hygrometer proposed by Dr. Franklin. Though I have most of the\r\narticles ready made, I doubt now whether I shall be able to do it before\r\nmy departure for America, the permission for which I expect every hour;\r\nand I shall go off the instant I receive it. While there, I shall have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing your father and friends. I expect to return in\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I have the honor to be, with very great esteem and\r\nrespect, Dear Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCIII.--TO THOMAS PAINE, May 19,1789\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\nParis, May 19,1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of February the 16th to April the 13th, and of May the 3rd\r\nand 10th, are received; and the two last are sent to Mr. Leroy, who will\r\ncommunicate them to the Academy.\r\n\r\nYou know that the States General have met, and probably have seen\r\nthe speeches at the opening of them. The three orders sit in distinct\r\nchambers. The great question, whether they shall vote by orders or\r\npersons can never be surmounted amicably. It has not yet been proposed\r\nin form; but the votes which have been taken on the outworks of that\r\nquestion show, that the _Tiers-Etat_ are unanimous, a good majority\r\nof the Clergy (consisting of the _Curés_) disposed to side with the\r\n_Tiers-Etat_, and in the chamber of the _Noblesse_ there are only\r\nfifty-four in that sentiment, against one hundred and ninety, who are\r\nfor voting by orders. Committees to find means of conciliation are\r\nappointed by each chamber; but conciliation is impossible. Some think\r\nthe Nobles could be induced to unite themselves with the higher Clergy\r\ninto one House, the lower Clergy and _Tiers-Etat_ forming another. But\r\nthe _Tiers-Etat_ are immovable. They are not only firm, but a little\r\ndisdainful. The question is, what will ensue? One idea is to separate,\r\nin order to consult again their constituents, and to take new\r\ninstructions. This would be doing nothing, for the same instructions\r\nwould be repeated; and what, in the mean time, is to become of a\r\ngovernment absolutely without money, and which cannot be kept in motion\r\nwith less than a million of livres a day? The more probable expectation\r\nis as follows. As soon as it shall become evident, that no amicable\r\ndetermination of the manner of voting can take place, the _Tiers-Etat_\r\nwill send an invitation to the two other orders, to come and take their\r\nplaces in the common chamber. A majority of the Clergy will go, and the\r\nminority of the Noblesse. The chamber thus composed, will declare that\r\nthe States General are constituted, will notify it to the King, and\r\nthat they are ready to proceed to business. If the King refuses to do\r\nbusiness with them, and adheres to the Nobles, the common chamber will\r\ndeclare all taxes at an end, will form a declaration of rights, and\r\ndo such other acts as the circumstances will permit, and go home. The\r\ntax-gatherers will then be resisted, and it may well be doubted whether\r\nthe soldiery and their officers will not divide, as the _Tiers-Etat_ and\r\nNobles. But it is more likely that the King will agree to do business\r\nwith the States General, so constituted, professing that the necessities\r\nof the moment force this, and that he means to negotiate (as they go\r\nalong) a reconciliation between the seceding members, and those which\r\nremain. If the matter takes this turn, there may be small troubles and\r\nebullitions excited by the seceding _Noblesse_ and higher Clergy; but no\r\nserious difficulty can arise. M. de Lamoignon, the _Garde des Sceaux_ of\r\nthe last year, has shot himself. The Emperor’s complaint is pulmonary,\r\nand incurable. The Grand Seignior is dead; his successor, young and\r\nwarlike. I congratulate you sincerely on the success of your bridge.\r\nI was sure of it before from theory: yet one likes to be assured from\r\npractice also. I am anxious to see how Mr. Rumsey’s experiment succeeds.\r\n\r\nMay the 21st. I have this moment received a letter from Ledyard, dated\r\nCairo, November the 15th. He therein says, ‘I am doing up my baggage,\r\nand most curious baggage it is, and I leave Cairo in two or three days.\r\nI travel from hence southwest, about three hundred leagues, to a\r\nblack King: there my present conductors leave me to my fate. Beyond, I\r\nsuppose, I go alone. I expect to hit the continent across, between\r\nthe parallels of twelve and twenty degrees north latitude. I shall,\r\nif possible, write you from the kingdom of this black gentleman.’ This\r\nseems to contradict the story of his having died at Cairo, in January,\r\nas he was then, probably, in the interior parts of Africa. If Sir Joseph\r\nBanks has no news from him later than the letter of September, it may\r\ndo him pleasure, if you will communicate the above. If he or any other\r\nperson knows whether there is any foundation for the story of his\r\ndeath, I will thank you to inform me of it. My letter being to go off\r\nto-morrow, I shall only add assurances of the esteem and respect, with\r\nwhich I am, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCIV.--TO MONSIEUR DE ST. ETIENNE, June 3, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE ST. ETIENNE.\r\n\r\nParis, June 3, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAfter you quitted us yesterday evening, we continued our conversation\r\n(Monsieur de la Fayette, Mr. Short, and myself) on the subject of the\r\ndifficulties which environ you. The desirable object being to secure\r\nthe good which the King has offered, and to avoid the ill which seems to\r\nthreaten, an idea was suggested, which appearing to make an impression\r\non Monsieur de la Fayette, I was encouraged to pursue it on my return\r\nto Paris, to put it into form, and now to send it to you and him. It is\r\nthis; that the King, in a _seance royale_, should come forward with\r\na Charter of Rights in his hand, to be signed by himself and by every\r\nmember of the three orders. This charter to contain the five great\r\npoints which the _Resultat_ of December offered on the part of the King;\r\nthe abolition of pecuniary privileges offered by the privileged orders,\r\nand the adoption of the national debt, and a grant of the sum of money\r\nasked from the nation. This last will be a cheap price for the preceding\r\narticles; and let the same act declare your immediate separation till\r\nthe next anniversary meeting. You will carry back to your constituents\r\nmore good than ever was effected before without violence, and you will\r\nstop exactly at the point where violence would otherwise begin. Time\r\nwill be gained, the public mind will continue to ripen and to be\r\ninformed, a basis of support may be prepared with the people themselves,\r\nand expedients occur for gaining still something further at your next\r\nmeeting, and for stopping again at the point of force. I have ventured\r\nto send yourself and Monsieur de la Fayette a sketch of my ideas of\r\nwhat this act might contain, without endangering any dispute. But it is\r\noffered merely as a canvass for you to work on, if it be fit to work on\r\nat all. I know too little of the subject, and you know too much of it,\r\nto justify me in offering any thing but a hint. I have done it, too, in\r\na hurry: insomuch, that since committing it to writing, it occurs to\r\nme that the fifth article may give alarm; that it is in a good degree\r\nincluded in the fourth, and is, therefore, useless. But after all,\r\nwhat excuse can I make, Sir, for this presumption. I have none but an\r\nunmeasurable love for your nation, and a painful anxiety lest despotism,\r\nafter an unaccepted offer to bind its own hands, should seize you again\r\nwith tenfold fury. Permit me to add to these, very sincere assurances of\r\nthe sentiments of esteem and respect, with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The annexed is the Charter accompanying the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Charter of Rights, solemnly established by the King and Nation.\r\n\r\n1. The States General shall assemble, uncalled, on the first day of\r\nNovember, annually, and shall remain together so long as they shall\r\nsee cause. They shall regulate their own elections and proceedings, and\r\nuntil they shall ordain otherwise, their elections shall be in the forms\r\nobserved in the present year, and shall be triennial.\r\n\r\n2. The States General alone shall levy money on the nation, and shall\r\nappropriate it.\r\n\r\n3. Laws shall be made by the States General only, with the consent of\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\n4. No person shall be restrained of his liberty, but by regular process\r\nfrom a court of justice, authorized by a general law. (Except that a\r\nNoble may be imprisoned by order of a court of justice, on the prayer\r\nof twelve of his nearest relations.) On complaint of an unlawful\r\nimprisonment, to any judge whatever, he shall have the prisoner\r\nimmediately brought before him, and shall discharge him, if his\r\nimprisonment be unlawful. The officer, in whose custody the prisoner is,\r\nshall obey the orders of the judge; and both judge and officer shall be\r\nresponsible, civilly and criminally, for a failure of duty herein.\r\n\r\n5. The military shall be subordinate to the civil authority.\r\n\r\n7. Printers shall be liable to legal prosecution for printing and\r\npublishing false facts, injurious to the party prosecuting; but they\r\nshall be under no other restraint.\r\n\r\n7. All pecuniary privileges and exemptions, enjoyed by any description\r\nof persons, are abolished.\r\n\r\n8. All debts already contracted by the King, are hereby made the debts\r\nof the nation; and the faith thereof is pledged for their payment in due\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n9. Eighty millions of livres are now granted to the King, to be raised\r\nby loan, and reimbursed by the nation: and the taxes heretofore paid,\r\nshall continue to be paid to the end of the present year, and no longer.\r\n\r\n10. The States General shall now separate, and meet again on the 1st day\r\nof November next.\r\n\r\nDone, on behalf of the whole nation, by the King and their\r\nrepresentatives in the States General, at Versailles, this ------ day of\r\nJune, 1789.\r\n\r\nSigned by the King, and by every member individually, and in his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCV.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, June 12, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, June 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nAs I may not be able to get at you at Versailles, I write this to\r\ndeliver it myself at your door. With respect to the utility or inutility\r\nof your minority’s joining the Commons, I am unable to form an opinion\r\nfor myself. I know too little of the subject to see what may be its\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nI never knew an instance of the English parliament’s undertaking to\r\nrelieve the poor by a distribution of bread in time of scarcity. In\r\nfact, the English commerce is so extensive and so active, that though\r\nbread may be a little more or less plenty, there can never be an\r\nabsolute failure. The island is so narrow, that corn can be readily\r\ncarried from the sea-ports to its interior parts. But were an absolute\r\nwant to happen, and were the parliament to undertake a distribution of\r\ncorn, I think, that according to the principles of their government,\r\nthey would only vote a sum of money, and address the King to employ\r\nit for the best. The business is, in its nature, executive, and would\r\nrequire too great a variety of detail to be managed by an act of\r\nparliament. However, I repeat it, that I never heard or read of an\r\ninstance of the parliament’s interfering to give bread. If I see you at\r\nVersailles to-day, I can be more particular.\r\n\r\nI am with great sincerity, my dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCVI.--TO JOHN JAY, June 17, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nParis, June 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you on the 9th and 12th of May, by the\r\nway of London. This goes through the same channel to the care of Mr.\r\nTrumbull. Having received no letter from you of later date than the 25th\r\nof November, I am apprehensive that there may have been miscarriages,\r\nand the more so, as I learn, through another channel, that you have\r\nparticularly answered mine of November the 19th.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Grand Seignior, which has happened, renders the\r\ncontinuance of the war more probable, as it has brought to the throne\r\na successor of a more active and ardent temper, and who means to put\r\nhimself at the head of his armies. He has declared the Captain Pacha\r\nhis Generalissimo. The prospects for Russia, on the other hand, are\r\nless encouraging. Her principal ally, the Emperor, is at death’s door,\r\nblazing up a little indeed, from time to time like an expiring taper,\r\nbut certainly to extinguish soon. Denmark, too, is likely to be\r\nrestrained by the threats of England and Prussia, from contributing even\r\nher stipulated naval succors. It is some time since I have been able\r\nto obtain any account of the King of England, on which I can rely with\r\nconfidence. His melancholy continues, and to such a degree, as to render\r\nhim absolutely indifferent to every thing that passes, so that he seems\r\nwilling to let his ministers do every thing they please, provided they\r\nwill let him alone. When forced to speak, his comprehension seems better\r\nthan it was in the first moments after his phrensy went off. His health\r\nis bad: he does not go into public at all, and very few are admitted\r\nto see him. This is his present state, according to the best accounts I\r\nhave been able to get lately. His ministers dictate boldly in the north,\r\nbecause they know it is impossible they should be engaged in the war,\r\nwhile this country is so completely palsied.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen by my former letters, that the question, whether the\r\nStates General should vote by persons or by orders, had stopped their\r\nproceedings in the very first instance in which it could occur, that\r\nis, as to the verification of their powers, and that they had appointed\r\ncommittees to try if there were any means of accommodation. These could\r\ndo nothing. The King then proposed that they should appoint others, to\r\nmeet persons whom he should name, on the same subject. These conferences\r\nalso proved ineffectual. He then proposed a specific mode of verifying.\r\nThe clergy accepted it unconditionally; the _Noblesse_, with such\r\nconditions and modifications, as did away their acceptance altogether.\r\nThe Commons, considering this as a refusal, came to the resolution of\r\nthe 10th instant (which I have the honor to send you), inviting the\r\ntwo other orders to come and take their places in the common room, and\r\nnotifying that they should proceed to the verification of powers, and to\r\nthe affairs of the nation, either with or without them. The Clergy\r\nhave, as yet, given no answer. A few of their members have accepted the\r\ninvitation of the Commons, and have presented themselves in their room,\r\nto have their powers verified; but how many it will detach, in the\r\nwhole, from that body, cannot be known till an answer be decided on. The\r\n_Noblesse_ adhered to their former resolutions, and even the minority,\r\nwell disposed to the Commons, thought they could do more good in their\r\nown chamber, by endeavoring to increase their numbers and fettering the\r\nmeasures of the majority, than by joining the Commons. An intrigue was\r\nset on foot, between the leaders of the majority in that House, the\r\nQueen, and Princes. They persuaded the King to go for some time to\r\nMarly: he went. On the same day, the leaders moved in the chamber of\r\nNobles, that they should address the King, to declare his own sentiments\r\non the great question between the orders. It was intended that this\r\naddress should be delivered to him at Marly, where, separated from\r\nhis ministers, and surrounded by the Queen and Princes, he might be\r\nsurprised into a declaration for the Nobles. The motion was lost,\r\nhowever, by a very great majority, that chamber being not yet quite\r\nripe for throwing themselves into the arms of despotism. Necker and\r\nMontmorin, who had discovered this intrigue, had warned some of the\r\nminority to defeat it, or they could not answer for what would happen.\r\nThese two and St. Priest, are the only members of the Council in\r\nfavor of the Commons. Luzerne, Puy-Segur, and the others, are high\r\naristocrats. The Commons having verified their powers, a motion was\r\nmade the day before yesterday, to declare themselves constituted, and to\r\nproceed to business. I left them at two o’clock yesterday; the debates\r\nnot then finished. They differed only about forms of expression, but\r\nagreed in the substance, and probably decided yesterday, or will decide\r\nto-day. Their next move, I fancy, will be to suppress all taxes, and\r\ninstantly re-establish them till the end of their session, in order\r\nto prevent a premature dissolution: and then they will go to work on\r\na declaration of rights and a constitution. The _Noblesse_, I suppose,\r\nwill be employed altogether in counter operations; the Clergy, that is\r\nto say, the higher Clergy, and such of the _Curés_ as they can bring\r\nover to their side, will be waiting and watching, merely to keep\r\nthemselves in their saddles. Their deportment, hitherto, is that of\r\nmeekness and cunning. The fate of the nation depends on the conduct of\r\nthe King and his ministers. Were they to side openly with the Commons,\r\nthe revolution would be completed without a convulsion, by the\r\nestablishment of a constitution, tolerably free, and in which the\r\ndistinction of Noble and Commoner would be suppressed. But this is\r\nscarcely possible. The King is honest, and wishes the good of his\r\npeople; but the expediency of an hereditary aristocracy is too difficult\r\na question for him. On the contrary, his prejudices, his habits, and his\r\nconnections decide him in his heart to support it. Should they decide\r\nopenly for the _Noblesse_, the Commons, after suppressing taxes,\r\nand finishing their declaration of rights, would probably go home;\r\na bankruptcy takes place in the instant, Mr. Necker must go out, a\r\nresistance to the tax-gatherers follows, and probably a civil war. These\r\nconsequences are too evident and violent, to render this issue likely.\r\nThough the Queen and Princes are infatuated enough to hazard it, the\r\nparty in the ministry would not. Something, therefore, like what I\r\nhinted in my letter of May the 12th, is still the most likely to take\r\nplace. While the Commons, either with or without their friends of the\r\nother two Houses, shall be employed in framing a constitution, perhaps\r\nthe government may set the other two Houses to work on the same subject:\r\nand when the three schemes shall be ready, joint committees may be\r\nnegotiated, to compare them together, to see in what parts they agree;\r\nand probably they will agree in all, except the organization of the\r\nfuture States General. As to this, it may be endeavored, by the aid of\r\nwheedling and intimidation, to induce the two privileged chambers to\r\nmelt themselves into one, and the Commons, instead of one, to agree to\r\ntwo Houses of legislation. I see no other middle ground to which they\r\ncan be brought.\r\n\r\nIt is a tremendous cloud, indeed, which hovers over this nation, and he\r\nat the helm has neither the courage nor the skill necessary to weather\r\nit. Eloquence in a high degree, knowledge in matters of account, and\r\norder, are distinguishing traits in his character. Ambition is his first\r\npassion, virtue his second. He has not discovered that sublime truth,\r\nthat a bold, unequivocal virtue is the best handmaid even to ambition,\r\nand would carry him further, in the end, than the temporizing, wavering\r\npolicy he pursues. His judgment is not of the first order, scarcely even\r\nof the second; his resolution frail; and upon the whole, it is rare\r\nto meet an instance of a person so much below the reputation he has\r\nobtained. As this character, by the post and times in which Providence\r\nhas placed it, is important to be known, I send it to you as drawn by\r\na person of my acquaintance, who knows him well. He is not, indeed, his\r\nfriend, and allowance must, therefore, be made for the high coloring.\r\nBut this being abated, the facts and groundwork of the drawing are\r\njust. If the _Tiers_ separate, he goes at the same time; if they stay\r\ntogether, and succeed in establishing a constitution to their mind, as\r\nsoon as that is placed in safety, they will abandon him to the mercy\r\nof the court, unless he can recover the confidence which he has lost at\r\npresent, and which, indeed, seems to be irrecoverable.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of St. Domingo, without the permission of the\r\ngovernment, have chosen and sent deputies to the States General. The\r\nquestion of their admission is to be discussed by the States. In the\r\nmean time, the government had promised them an Assembly in their own\r\nIsland, in the course of the present year. The death of the Dauphin, so\r\nlong expected, has at length happened. Montmorin told Ternant the other\r\nday, that De Moustier had now asked a _congé_, which would be sent him\r\nimmediately. So that unless a change of ministry should happen, he will,\r\nprobably, be otherwise disposed of. The gazettes of France and Leyden\r\naccompany this. I have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. June 18. The motion under debate with the Commons, for\r\nconstituting their Assembly, passed yesterday by a majority of\r\nfour hundred and odd, against eighty odd. The latter were for it\r\nin substance, but wished some particular amendment. They proceeded\r\ninstantly to the subject of taxation. A member who called on me this\r\nmoment, gave me a state of the proceedings of yesterday, from memory,\r\nwhich I enclose you. He left the House a little before the question was\r\nput, because he saw there was no doubt of its passing, and his brother,\r\nwho remained till the decision, informed him of it. So that we may\r\nexpect, perhaps, in the course of to-morrow, to see whether the\r\ngovernment will interpose with a bold hand, or will begin a negotiation.\r\nBut in the mean time, this letter must go off. I will find some other\r\nopportunity, however, of informing you of the issue. T. J.\r\n\r\n^^^ [Character of Mr. Necker, accompanying the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\nNature bestowed on Mr. Necker an ardent passion for glory, without, at\r\nthe same time, granting him those qualities required for its pursuit by\r\ndirect means. The union of a fruitful imagination with a limited talent,\r\nwith which she has endowed him, is always incompatible with those\r\nfaculties of the mind which qualify their possessor to penetrate, to\r\ncombine, and to comprehend all the relations of objects.\r\n\r\nHe had probably learned in Geneva, his native country, the influence\r\nwhich riches exercise on the success of ambition, without having\r\nrecourse to the school of Paris, where he arrived about the\r\ntwenty-eighth year of his age. A personal affair with his brother, in\r\nwhich the chiefs of the republic conducted themselves unjustly towards\r\nhim, the circumstances of which, moreover, exposed him to ridicule,\r\ndetermined him to forsake his country. On taking his leave, he assured\r\nhis mother that he would make a great fortune at Paris. On his arrival,\r\nhe engaged himself as clerk, at a salary of six hundred livres, with the\r\nbanker Thelusson, a man of extreme harshness in his intercourse with\r\nhis dependants. The same cause which obliged other clerks to abandon the\r\nservice of Thelusson, determined Necker to continue in it. By submitting\r\nto the brutality of his master with a servile resignation, whilst,\r\nat the same time, he devoted the most unremitting attention to his\r\nbusiness, he recommended himself to his confidence, and was taken into\r\npartnership. Ordinary abilities only were requisite to avail him of the\r\nmultitude of favorable circumstances, which, before he entered into the\r\nadministration, built up a fortune of six millions of livres. He owed\r\nmuch of his good fortune to his connections with the Abbe Terrai,\r\nof whose ignorance he did not scruple to profit. His riches,\r\nhis profession, his table, and a virtuous, reasonable, and well\r\ninformed wife, procured him the acquaintance of many persons of\r\ndistinction, among whom were many men of letters, who celebrated his\r\nknowledge and wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe wise and just principles by which Turgot aimed to correct the Abuses\r\nof the administration, not having been received with favor, he seized\r\nthe occasion to flatter ignorance and malignity, by publishing his work\r\nagainst the freedom of the corn trade.\r\n\r\nHe had published, two years before, an eulogy on Colbert. Both these\r\nproductions exhibited the limited capacity of a banker, and, in no\r\ndegree, the enlarged views of a statesman. Not at all delicate in the\r\nchoice of his means, he succeeded to his wish in his object, which was\r\nthe establishing himself in public opinion. Elevated by a secret cabal\r\nto the direction of the finances, he began by refusing the salaries of\r\nhis office. He affected a spirit of economy and austerity, which imposed\r\neven on foreign nations, and showed the possibility of making war\r\nwithout laying new taxes. Such at least was his boast; but, in reality,\r\nthey have been increased under his administration, about twenty\r\nmillions, partly by a secret augmentation of the bailies and of the\r\npoll-tax, partly by some verifications of the twentieths, and partly\r\nby the natural progression, which is tested by the amount of taxes\r\non consumption, the necessary result of the successive increase of\r\npopulation, of riches, and of expensive tastes.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances reared for him an astonishing reputation, which\r\nhis fall has consecrated. People will not reflect, that, in the short\r\nperiod of his ministry, he had more than doubled his fortune. Not\r\nthat he had peculated on the public treasury; his good sense and pride\r\nforbade a resort to this manœuvre of weak minds; but by resorting to\r\nloans and the costly operations of the bank, to provide the funds of\r\nwar, and being still connected with the house to which he addressed\r\nhimself for much the greater part of his negotiations. They have not\r\nremarked that his great principles of economy have nothing more than\r\na false show, and that the loans resorted to, in order to avoid the\r\nimposition of taxes, have been the source of the mischief which has\r\nreduced the finances to their present alarming condition.\r\n\r\nAs to his _compte rendu_; he has been forgiven the nauseous panegyric\r\nwhich he has passed upon himself, and the affectation of introducing\r\nhis wife into it, for the purpose of praising her; and we are spared\r\nthe trouble of examining his false calculations. M. de Calonne has\r\nundertaken this investigation. Without being able to vindicate himself,\r\nhe has already begun to unmask his antagonist, and he promises to do it\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nNecessity has recalled this man to the ministry: and it must be\r\nconfessed, that he is beyond comparison a less mischievous minister\r\nthan his predecessors. I would compare him to a steward, who, by his\r\nmanagement, does not entirely ruin his master, but who enriches himself\r\nat his expense. The desire of glory should inspire him as much as\r\npossible with the energy requisite for the public business. There is\r\nevery likelihood that his ministry will not endure long enough, to cause\r\nit to feel the effects of his false principles of administration: and\r\nit is he alone who is able, if any one can, to preserve order in the\r\nfinances, until the reform is effected which we hope from the assembling\r\nof the States General. In the mean time, the public estimation of his\r\ntalents and virtue is not so high as it has been. There are persons who\r\npretend that he is more firmly established in public opinion than he\r\never was. They deceive themselves. The ambitious desire he has always\r\nmanifested of getting again into the administration, his work on the\r\nImportance of Religious Opinions, and the Memoires of M. de Calonne,\r\nhave greatly impaired his reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, June 18, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, June 18, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of May the 11th. Yours of March the 29th came to\r\nhand ten days ago; and about two days ago, I received a cover of your\r\nhand-writing, under which were a New York paper of May the 4th, and a\r\nletter from Mr. Page to Mazzei. There being no letter from you, makes me\r\nhope there is one on the way, which will inform me of my _congé_. I\r\nhave never received Mr. Jay’s answer to my public letter of November the\r\n19th, which you mention him to have written, and which I fear has been\r\nintercepted. I know only from you, that my letter got safe to hand. My\r\nbaggage has been made up more than a month, so that I shall leave Paris\r\nalmost in the instant of receiving the permission.\r\n\r\nThe campaign begins under unfavorable auspices for Russia. The death of\r\nthe Grand Seignior, who was personally disposed for peace, has brought a\r\nyoung and ardent successor to the throne, determined to push the war to\r\nextremity. Her only ally, the Emperor, is _in articulo mortis_, and the\r\ngrand Duke of Tuscany, should he succeed, loves peace and money. Denmark\r\nis forbidden by England and Prussia to furnish even its stipulated\r\nmaritime aid. There is no appearance of any other power’s engaging\r\nin the war. As far as I can discover, the King of England is somewhat\r\nbetter in his head, but under such a complete depression of spirits,\r\nthat he does not care how the world goes, and leaves his ministers to do\r\nas they please. It is impossible for you to conceive how difficult it is\r\nto know the truth relative to him, he is environed in such an atmosphere\r\nof lies. Men who would not speak a falsehood on any other subject, lie\r\non this, from a principle of duty; so that even eye-witnesses cannot be\r\nbelieved without scanning their principles and connections; and few will\r\nstand this, of the very few permitted to see him.\r\n\r\nCommittees of conciliation having failed in their endeavors to bring\r\ntogether the three chambers of the States General, the King proposed a\r\nspecific mode of verifying their powers; for that having been the\r\nfirst question which presented itself to them, was the one in which the\r\nquestion of voting by persons or orders was first brought on. The clergy\r\naccepted unconditionally. The _Noblesse_ accepted on conditions which\r\nreduced the acceptance to nothing at all. The Commons considered this as\r\na refusal on the part of the Nobles, and thereupon took their definitive\r\nresolution, to invite the other two orders to come and verify their\r\npowers in common, and to notify them they should proceed with or without\r\nthem to verify, and to do the business of the nation. This was on\r\nthe 10th. On the 15th, they moved to declare themselves the National\r\nAssembly. The debates on this were finished yesterday, when the\r\nproposition was agreed to, by four hundred and odd, against eighty odd.\r\nThe minority agreed in substance, but wished some particular amendment.\r\nThey then immediately made the proposition relative to taxes, which I\r\nenclose you, as this moment stated to me, by memory, by a member who\r\nleft the Assembly a little before the question, because there was no\r\nopposition to the matter, but only to the form. He assures me, on the\r\ninformation of another member who was present, that Target’s motion\r\npassed. We shall know, I think, within a day or two, whether the\r\ngovernment will risk a bankruptcy and civil war, rather than see all\r\ndistinction of orders done way, which is what the Commons will push\r\nfor. If the fear of the former alternative prevails, they will spin the\r\nmatter into negotiation. The Commons have in their chamber almost all\r\nthe talents of the nation; they are firm and bold, yet moderate. There\r\nis indeed, among them, a number of very hot-headed members; but those\r\nof most influence are cool, temperate, and sagacious. Every step of this\r\nHouse has been marked with caution and wisdom. The _Noblesse_, on the\r\ncontrary, are absolutely out of their senses. They are so furious, they\r\ncan seldom debate at all. They have few men of moderate talents, and\r\nnot one of great, in the majority. Their proceedings have been very\r\ninjudicious. The Clergy are waiting to profit of every incident to\r\nsecure themselves, and have no other object in view. Among the Commons,\r\nthere is an entire unanimity on the great question of voting by persons.\r\nAmong the _Noblesse_, there are about sixty for the Commons, and about\r\nthree times that number against them. Among the Clergy, about twenty\r\nhave already come over and joined the Commons, and in the course of\r\na few days, they will be joined by many more, not indeed making the\r\nmajority of that House, but very near it. The Bishops and Archbishops\r\nhave been very successful by bribes and intrigues, in detaching the\r\n_Curés_ from the Commons, to whom they were at first attached to a man.\r\nThe Commons are about, five hundred and fifty-four in number, of whom\r\nthree hundred and forty-four are of the Jaw. These do not possess an\r\ninfluence founded in property; but in their habits of business and\r\nacquaintance with the people, and in their means of exciting them as\r\nthey please. The _Curés_, throughout the kingdom, form the mass of the\r\nClergy; they are the only part favorably known to the people, because\r\nsolely charged with the duties of baptism, burial, confession,\r\nvisitation of the sick, instruction of the children, and aiding the\r\npoor; they are themselves of the people, and united with them. The\r\ncarriages and equipage only of the higher Clergy, not their persons, are\r\nknown to the people, and are in detestation with them. The soldiers will\r\nfollow their officers, that is to say, their captains, lieutenants, and\r\nensigns. These are of the lower nobility, and therefore much divided.\r\nThe colonels and higher officers are of the higher nobility, are\r\nseldom with the soldiers, little known to them, not possessing their\r\nattachment. These circumstances give them little weight in the partition\r\nof the army.\r\n\r\nI give you these miscellaneous observations, that knowing somewhat the\r\ndispositions of the parties, you may be able to judge of the future for\r\nyourself, as I shall not be here to continue its communication to you.\r\n\r\nIn hopes to see you soon, I conclude with assurances of the perfect\r\nesteem and respect, with which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCVIII.--TO JOHN JAY, June 24,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, June 24,1789.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 17th and 18th instant gave you the progress of the\r\nStates General to the 17th, when the _Tiers_ had declared the illegality\r\nof all the existing taxes, and their discontinuance from the end of\r\ntheir present session. The next day, being a _jour de fete_, could\r\nfurnish no indication of the impression that vote was likely to make\r\non the government. On the 19th, a Council was held at Marly, in the\r\nafternoon. It was there proposed, that the King should interpose by\r\na declaration of his sentiments in a _seance royale_. The declaration\r\nprepared by M. Necker, while it censured, in general, the proceedings\r\nboth of the Nobles and Commons, announced the King’s views, such as\r\nsubstantially to coincide with the Commons. It was agreed to in Council,\r\nas also that the _seance royale_ should be held on the 22nd, and the\r\nmeetings till then be suspended. While the Council was engaged in this\r\ndeliberation at Marly, the chamber of the Clergy was in debate, whether\r\nthey should accept the invitation of the _Tiers_ to unite with them\r\nin the common chamber. On the first question, to unite simply and\r\nunconditionally, it was decided in the negative by a very small\r\nmajority. As it was known however, that some members who had voted in\r\nthe negative, would be for the affirmative, with some modifications, the\r\nquestion was put with these modifications, and it was determined by a\r\nmajority of eleven members, that their body should join the _Tiers_.\r\nThese proceedings of the Clergy were unknown to the Council at Marly,\r\nand those of the Council were kept secret from every body. The next\r\nmorning (the 20th), the members repaired to the House as usual, found\r\nthe doors shut and guarded, and a proclamation posted up for holding\r\na _seance royale_ on the 22nd, and a suspension of their meetings till\r\nthen. They presumed, in the first moment, that their dissolution\r\nwas decided, and repaired to another place, where they proceeded to\r\nbusiness. They there bound themselves to each other by an oath, never to\r\nseparate of their own accord, till they had settled a constitution for\r\nthe nation on a solid basis, and if separated by force, that they would\r\nre-assemble in some other place. It was intimated to them, however, that\r\nday, privately, that the proceedings of the _seance royale_ would be\r\nfavorable to them. The next day they met in a church, and were joined by\r\na majority of the Clergy. The heads of the aristocracy saw that all was\r\nlost without some violent exertion. The King was still at Marly. Nobody\r\nwas permitted to approach him but their friends. He was assailed by lies\r\nin all shapes. He was made to believe that the Commons were going to\r\nabsolve the army from their oath of fidelity to him, and to raise their\r\npay.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThey procured a committee to be held, consisting of the King and his\r\nministers, to which Monsieur and the Count d’Artois should be admitted.\r\nAt this committee, the latter attacked Mr. Necker personally, arraigned\r\nhis plans, and proposed one which some of his engines had put into his\r\nhands. Mr. Necker, whose characteristic is the want of firmness, was\r\nbrowbeaten and intimidated, and the King shaken. He determined that the\r\ntwo plans should be deliberated on the next day, and the _seance royale_\r\nput off a day longer. This encouraged a fiercer attack on Mr. Necker\r\nthe next day; his plan was totally dislocated, and that of the Count\r\nd’Artois inserted into it. Himself and Monsieur de Montmorin offered\r\ntheir resignation, which was refused; the Count d’Artois saying to\r\nMr. Necker, ‘No, Sir, you must be kept as the hostage; we hold you\r\nresponsible for all the ill which shall happen.’ This change of plan was\r\nimmediately whispered without doors. The nobility were in triumph, the\r\npeople in consternation. When the King passed, the next day, through the\r\nlane they formed from the Chateau to the _Hotel des Etats_ (about half\r\na mile), there was a dead silence. He was about an hour in the House,\r\ndelivering his speech and declaration, copies of which I enclose you.\r\nOn his coming out, a feeble cry of ‘Vive le Roy’ was raised by some\r\nchildren, but the people remained silent and sullen. When the Duke\r\nd’Orleans followed, however, their applauses were excessive. This must\r\nhave been sensible to the King. He had ordered, in the close of\r\nhis speech, that the members should follow him, and resume their\r\ndeliberations the next day. The _Noblesse_ followed him, and so did the\r\nClergy, except about thirty, who, with the _Tiers_, remained in the room\r\nand entered into deliberation. They protested against what the King\r\nhad done, adhered to all their former proceedings, and resolved the\r\ninviolability of their own persons. An officer came twice to order them\r\nout of the room, in the King’s name, but they refused to obey. In the\r\nafternoon, the people, uneasy, began to assemble in great numbers in the\r\ncourts and vicinities of the palace. The Queen was alarmed, and sent for\r\nMr. Necker. He was conducted amidst the shouts and acclamations of the\r\nmultitude, who filled all the apartments of the palace. He was a few\r\nminutes only with the Queen, and about three quarters of an hour with\r\nthe King. Not a word has transpired of what passed at these interviews.\r\nThe King was just going to ride out. He passed through the crowd to his\r\ncarriage, and into it, without being in the least noticed. As Mr. Necker\r\nfollowed him, universal acclamations were raised of ‘_Vive Monsieur\r\nNecker, vive le sauveur de la France opprimée_.’ He was conducted back\r\nto his house with the same demonstrations of affection and anxiety.\r\nAbout two hundred deputies of the _Tiers_, catching the enthusiasm of\r\nthe moment, went to his house, and extorted from him a promise that he\r\nwould not resign. These circumstances must wound the heart of the King,\r\ndesirous as he is, to possess the affections of his subjects. As soon\r\nas the proceedings at Versailles were known at Paris, a run began on\r\nthe _caisse d’escompte_, which is the first symptom always of the public\r\ndiffidence and alarm. It is the less in condition to meet the run, as\r\nMr. Necker has been forced to make free with its funds, for the daily\r\nsupport of the government. This is the state of things as late as I am\r\nable to give them with certainty, at this moment. My letter not being to\r\ngo off till to-morrow evening, I shall go to Versailles to-morrow, and\r\nbe able to add the transactions of this day and to-morrow.\r\n\r\nJune 25. Just returned from Versailles, I am enabled to continue my\r\nnarration. On the 24th, nothing remarkable passed, except an attack by\r\nthe mob of Versailles on the Archbishop of Paris, who had been one\r\nof the instigators of the court, to the proceedings of the, _seance\r\nroyale_. They threw mud and stones at his carriage, broke the windows of\r\nit, and he in a fright promised to join the _Tiers_.\r\n\r\nThis day (the 25th) forty-eight of the Nobles have joined the _Tiers_.\r\nAmong these is the Duke d’Orleans. The Marquis de la Fayette could not\r\nbe of the number, being restrained by his instructions. He is writing\r\nto his constituents, to change his instructions or to accept his\r\nresignation. There are with the _Tiers_ now one hundred and sixty-four\r\nmembers of the Clergy, so that the common chamber consists of upwards\r\nof eight hundred members. The minority of the Clergy, however, call\r\nthemselves the Chamber of the Clergy, and pretend to go on with\r\nbusiness. I found the streets of Versailles much embarrassed with\r\nsoldiers. There was a body of about one hundred horse drawn up in front\r\nof the Hotel of the States, and all the avenues and doors guarded by\r\nsoldiers. Nobody was permitted to enter but the members, and this was by\r\norder of the King; for till now, the doors of the common room have\r\nbeen open, and at least two thousand spectators attending their debates\r\nconstantly. They have named a deputation to wait on the King, and desire\r\na removal of the soldiery from their doors, and seem determined, if this\r\nis not complied with, to remove themselves elsewhere.\r\n\r\nInstead of being dismayed with what has passed, they seem to rise in\r\ntheir demands, and some of them to consider the erasing every vestige\r\nof a difference of order, as indispensable to the establishment and\r\npreservation of a good constitution. I apprehend there is more courage\r\nthan calculation in this project. I did imagine, that seeing that Mr.\r\nNecker and themselves were involved as common enemies in the hatred of\r\nthe aristocrats, they would have been willing to make common cause with\r\nhim, and to wish his continuance in office; and that Mr. Necker, seeing\r\nthat all the trimming he has used towards the court and Nobles has\r\navailed him nothing, would engage himself heartily and solely on the\r\npopular side, and view his own salvation in that alone. The confidence\r\nwhich the people place in him, seems to merit some attention. However,\r\nthe mass of the common chamber are absolutely indifferent to his\r\nremaining in office. They consider his head as unequal to the planning a\r\ngood constitution, and his fortitude to a co-operation in the effecting\r\nit. His dismission is more credited to-day than it was yesterday. If\r\nit takes place, he will retain his popularity with the nation, as the\r\nmembers of the States will not think it important to set themselves\r\nagainst it, but on the contrary, will be willing that he should continue\r\non their side, on his retirement. The run on the _caisse d’escompte_\r\ncontinues. The members of the States admit, that Mr. Necker’s departure\r\nout of office will occasion a stoppage of public payments. But they\r\nexpect to prevent any very ill effect, by assuring the public against\r\nany loss, and by taking immediate measures for continuing payment. They\r\nmay, perhaps, connect these measures with their own existence, so as to\r\ninterest the public in whatever catastrophe may be aimed at them. The\r\ngazettes of France and Leyden accompany this. During the continuance\r\nof this crisis and my own stay, I shall avail myself of every private\r\nconveyance to keep you informed of what passes.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCIX.--TO JOHN JAY, June 29, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, June 29, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 25th gave you the transactions of the States General to\r\nthe afternoon of that day. On the next, the Archbishop of Paris joined\r\nthe _Tiers_, as did some others of the Clergy and _Noblesse_. On the\r\n27th, the question of the St. Domingo deputation came on, and it was\r\ndecided that it should be received. I have before mentioned to you the\r\nferment into which the proceedings at the _seance royale_ of the 23rd\r\nhad thrown the people. The soldiery also were affected by it. It began\r\nin the French guards, extended to those of every other denomination\r\n(except the Swiss), and even to the body-guards of the King. They began\r\nto quit their barracks, to assemble in squads, to declare they would\r\ndefend the life of the King, but would not cut the throats of their\r\nfellow-citizens. They were treated and caressed by the people, carried\r\nin triumph through the streets, called themselves the soldiers of the\r\nnation, and left no doubt on which side they would be, in case of a\r\nrupture. Similar accounts came in from the troops in other parts of the\r\nkingdom, as well those which had not heard of the _seance royale_, as\r\nthose which had, and gave good reason to apprehend that the soldiery,\r\nin general, would side with their fathers and brothers, rather than with\r\ntheir officers. The operation of this medicine, at Versailles, was as\r\nsudden as it was powerful. The alarm there was so complete, that in the\r\nafternoon of the 27th, the King wrote a letter to the President of\r\nthe Clergy, the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault, in these words: [* A\r\ntranslation is here given.]\r\n\r\n     * My Cousin, Wholly engaged in promoted the general good of\r\n     my kingdom, and desirous, above all things, that the\r\n     Assembly of the States General should apply themselves to\r\n     objects of general interest, after the voluntary acceptance\r\n     by your order of my declaration of the 23rd of the present\r\n     month; I pass my word that my faithful Clergy will, without\r\n     delay, unite themselves with the other two orders, to hasten\r\n     the accomplishment of my paternal views. Those whose powers\r\n     are too limited, may decline voting until new powers are\r\n     procured. This will be a new mark of attachment which my\r\n     Clergy will give me. I pray God, my Cousin, to have you in\r\n     his holy keeping. LOUIS.’\r\n\r\nA like letter was written to the Duke de Luxemburgh, President of\r\nthe _Noblesse_. The two chambers entered into debate on the question,\r\nwhether they should obey the letter of the King. There was a\r\nconsiderable opposition; when notes written by the Count d’Artois to\r\nsundry members, and handed about among the rest, decided the matter,\r\nand they went in a body and took their seats with the _Tiers_, and thus\r\nrendered the union of the orders in one chamber complete. As soon as\r\nthis was known to the people of Versailles, they assembled about the\r\npalace, demanded the King and Queen, who came and showed themselves in\r\na balcony. They rent the skies with cries of ‘Vive la Roy,’ ‘Vive la\r\nReine.’ They, called for the Dauphin, who was also produced, and was\r\nthe subject of new acclamations. After feasting themselves and the royal\r\nfamily with this tumultuary reconciliation, they went to the house\r\nof Mr. Necker and M. de Montmorin, with shouts of thankfulness and\r\naffection. Similar emotions of joy took place in Paris, and at this\r\nmoment, the triumph of the Tiers is considered as complete. Tomorrow\r\nthey will recommence business, voting by persons on all questions: and\r\nwhatever difficulties may be opposed in debate by the malcontents of the\r\nClergy and Nobility, every thing must be finally settled at the will of\r\nthe _Tiers_. It remains to see whether they will leave to the nobility\r\nany thing but their titulary appellations. I suppose they will not. Mr.\r\nNecker will probably remain in office. It would seem natural that he\r\nshould endeavor to have the hostile part of the Council removed, but\r\nI question if he finds himself firm enough for that. A perfect\r\nco-operation with the _Tiers_ will be his wisest game. This great crisis\r\nbeing now over, I shall not have matter interesting enough to trouble\r\nyou with, as often as I have done lately. There has nothing remarkable\r\ntaken place in any other part of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most; obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCX.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, July 6, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI never made an offer to any body to have corn or flour brought here\r\nfrom America: no such idea ever entered my head. Mr. Necker desired me\r\nto give information in America, that there would be a want of flour. I\r\ndid so in a letter to Mr. Jay, which he published with my name to it,\r\nfor the encouragement of the merchants. Those here, who have named me\r\non this subject, must have mistaken me for Mr. Parker. I have heard\r\nhim say, he offered to Mr. Necker to bring a large supply, yet I do not\r\nthink I ever repeated this: or if I did, it must have been in a company\r\nI relied on. I will thank you to satisfy Mr. Necker of the truth. It\r\nwould be disagreeable, and perhaps mischievous, were he to have an idea\r\nthat I encouraged censures on him. I will bring you the paper you desire\r\nto-morrow; and shall dine at the Dutchess Danville’s, where I shall be\r\nhappy to meet you.\r\n\r\nAdieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXI.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, July 7,1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 7,1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of yesterday gave me the first information that Monsieur de\r\nMirabeau had suggested to the honorable the Assembly of the Nation, that\r\nI had made an offer to Mr. Necker to obtain from America a quantity\r\nof corn or flour, which had been refused. I know not how Monsieur de\r\nMirabeau has been led into this error. I never in my life made any\r\nproposition to Mr. Necker on the subject: I never said I had made such\r\na proposition. Some time last autumn, Mr. Necker did me the honor to\r\ndesire I would have notified in the United States, that corn and flour\r\nwould meet with a good sale in France. I conveyed this notice, in a\r\nletter to Mr. Jay, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, as you will see by the\r\nextract of my letter published by him in an American gazette, which I\r\nhave the honor to send you. I must beg leave to avail myself of your\r\nfriendship and of your position to have a communication of these facts\r\nmade to the honorable Assembly of the Nation, of which you are a member,\r\nand to repeat to you those sentiments of respect and attachment, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, my dear Sir, your most obedient and most\r\n\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXII.--TO MR. NECKER, July 8, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NECKER.\r\n\r\nParis, July 8, 1789\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a copy of my letter to Monsieur de\r\nla Fayette. When I called on him yesterday, he had already spoken to\r\nMonsieur de Mirabeau, who acknowledged he had been in an error in what\r\nhe had advanced in the Assembly of the Nation, as to the proposition\r\nsupposed to have been made by me to your Excellency, and undertook to\r\ndeclare his error, when the subject should be resumed by the Assembly,\r\nto whom my letter to the Marquis de la Fayette will be also read.\r\n\r\nI have thought it a duty, Sir, thus to correct, in the first moment, an\r\nerror, by which your name had been compromitted by an unfounded use\r\nof mine, and shall be happy in every occasion of proving to you those\r\nsentiments of profound respect and attachment, with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXIII.--TO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN, July 8, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nParis, July 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy hotel having been lately robbed for the third time, I take the\r\nliberty of uniting my wish with that of the inhabitants of this quarter,\r\nthat it might coincide with the arrangements of police, to extend to us\r\nthe protection of a guard. While the _Douane_ remained here, no accident\r\nof that kind happened, but since their removal, other houses in the\r\nneighborhood have been robbed as well as mine. Perhaps it may lessen the\r\ndifficulties of this request, that the house occupied by the people of\r\nthe _Douane_, will lodge abundantly a _corps de garde_. On the one side\r\nof that house is Chaillot, on the other the Roule, on the third the\r\nChamps Elysees, where accidents are said to happen very frequently, all\r\nof which are very distant from any _corps de garde_.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXIV.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, July 9, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nHaving been curious to form some estimate of the quantity of corn and\r\nflour which have been supplied to France this year, I applied to a\r\nperson in the Farms to know upon what quantities the premium had been\r\npaid. He could not give me information, but as to the Atlantic ports,\r\ninto which there have been imported from the United States, from March\r\nto May inclusive, forty-four thousand one hundred and sixteen quintals\r\nof corn, twelve thousand two hundred and twenty-one quintals of flour,\r\nmaking fifty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-seven quintals in\r\nthe whole. Add to this what has been imported since May, suppose nearly\r\ntwenty thousand quintals a month, and what has been furnished to the\r\nFrench islands, which has prevented an equal quantity being exported\r\nfrom France, and you will have the proportion drawn from us. Observe,\r\nthat we have regular and constant markets for our corn and flour in\r\nSpain, Portugal, and all the West India islands, except the French.\r\nThese take nearly our whole quantity. This year, France, the French\r\nWest Indies, and Canada were added. But a regular course of trade is not\r\nquitted in an instant, nor constant customers deserted for accidental\r\nones. This is the reason that so small a proportion has come here.\r\n\r\nI am, Dear Sir, with great sincerity, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXV.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, July 10, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 10, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment by Monsieur de Mirabeau to the National Assembly,\r\nthat he had been in an error as to the offer he supposed me to have\r\nmade, and the reading to them my letter, seem to be all that was\r\nrequisite for any just purpose. As I was unwilling my name should be\r\nused to injure the minister, I am also unwilling it should be used\r\nto injure Monsieur de Mirabeau. I learn that his enemies in Paris are\r\nframing scandalous versions of my letter. I think, therefore, with you,\r\nit may be better to print it, and I send you a copy of it. I gave copies\r\nof it to Monsieur de Montmorin and Monsieur Necker, as was my duty.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere affection, my Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CCXVI.--TO THOMAS PAINE, July 11, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nSince my last, which was of May the 19th, I have received yours of\r\nJune the 17th and 18th. I am struck with the idea of the geometrical\r\nwheel-barrow, and will beg of you a farther account, if it can be\r\nobtained. I have no news yet of my _congé_.\r\n\r\nThough you have doubtless heard most of the proceedings of the States\r\nGeneral since my last, I will take up the narration where that left it,\r\nthat you may be able to separate the true from the false accounts you\r\nhave heard. A good part of what was conjecture in that letter, is now\r\nbecome true history.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly, then, (for that is the name they take,) having\r\nshown through every stage of these transactions a coolness, wisdom, and\r\nresolution to set fire to the four corners of the kingdom, and to perish\r\nwith it themselves, rather than to relinquish an iota from their plan\r\nof a total change of government, are now in complete and undisputed\r\npossession of the sovereignty. The executive and aristocracy are at\r\ntheir feet; the mass of the nation, the mass of the clergy, and the\r\narmy are with them: they have prostrated the old government, and are now\r\nbeginning to build one from the foundation. A committee, charged with\r\nthe arrangement of their business, gave in, two days ago, the following\r\norder of proceedings.\r\n\r\n‘1. Every government should have for its only end, the preservation\r\nof the rights of man: whence it follows, that to recall constantly\r\nthe government to the end proposed, the constitution should begin by a\r\ndeclaration of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.\r\n\r\n‘2. Monarchical government being proper to maintain those rights, it has\r\nbeen chosen by the French nation. It suits especially a great society;\r\nit is necessary for the happiness of France. The declaration of the\r\nprinciples of this government, then, should follow immediately the\r\ndeclaration of the rights of man.\r\n\r\n‘3. It results from the principles of monarchy, that the nation, to\r\nassure its own rights, has yielded particular rights to the monarch: the\r\nconstitution, then, should declare, in a precise manner, the rights of\r\nboth. It should begin by declaring the rights of the French nation, and\r\nthen should declare the rights of the King.\r\n\r\n‘4. The rights of the King and nation not existing but for the happiness\r\nof the individuals who compose it, they lead to an examination of the\r\nrights of citizens.\r\n\r\n‘5. The French nation not being capable of assembling individually to\r\nexercise all its rights, it ought to be represented. It is necessary,\r\nthen, to declare the form of its representation and the rights of its\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n‘6. From the union of the powers of the nation and King, should result\r\nthe enacting and execution of the laws: thus, then, it should first\r\nbe determined how the laws shall be established; afterwards should be\r\nconsidered, how they shall be executed.\r\n\r\n‘7. Laws have for their object the general administration of the\r\nkingdom, the property, and the actions of the citizens. The execution of\r\nthe laws which concern the general administration, requires Provincial\r\nand Municipal Assemblies. It is necessary to examine, therefore, what\r\nshould be the organization of the Provincial Assemblies, and what of the\r\nMunicipal.\r\n\r\n‘8. The execution of the laws, which concern the property and actions of\r\nthe citizens, calls for a judiciary power. It should be determined how\r\nthat should be confided, and then its duties and limits.\r\n\r\n‘9. For the execution of the laws and the defence of the kingdom,\r\nthere exists a public force. It is necessary, then, to determine the\r\nprinciples which should direct it, and how it should be employed.\r\n\r\n‘Recapitulation.\r\n\r\n‘Declaration of the rights of man. Principles of the monarchy. Rights of\r\nthe nation. Rights of the King. Rights of the citizens.\r\n\r\n‘Organization and rights of the National Assembly. Forms necessary for\r\nthe enaction of laws. Organization and functions of the Provincial\r\nand Municipal Assemblies. Duties and limits of the judiciary power.\r\nFunctions and duties of the military power.’\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see that these are the materials of a superb edifice, and the hands\r\nwhich have prepared them are perfectly capable of putting them together,\r\nand of filling up the work, of which these are only the outlines. While\r\nthere are some men among them of very superior abilities, the mass\r\npossess such a degree of good sense, as enables them to decide well. I\r\nhave always been afraid their numbers might lead to confusion. Twelve\r\nhundred men in one room are too many. I have still that fear. Another\r\napprehension is, that a majority cannot be induced to adopt the trial by\r\njury, and I consider that as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man,\r\nby which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.\r\nMr. Paradise is the bearer of this letter. He can supply those details\r\nwhich it would be so tedious to write.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.",
