By that act the Missouri Compromise was repealed and the final\r\nconflict entered upon with the slave power. In addition to the speeches\r\nof Douglas and Chase, representing the best word on the opposing sides\r\nof the famous Nebraska controversy, the new volume includes the notable\r\ncontribution by Edward Everett to the Congressional debates on that\r\nsubject. Besides being an orator of high rank and of literary renown,\r\nEverett represented a distinct body of political opinion. As a\r\nconservative Whig he voiced the sentiment of the great body of the\r\nfollowers of Webster and Clay who had helped to establish the Compromise\r\nof 1850 and who wished to leave that settlement undisturbed. The student\r\nof the Congressional struggles of 1854 will be led by a speech like that\r\nof Everett to appreciate that moderate and conservative spirit toward\r\nslavery which would not persist in any anti-slavery action having a\r\ntendency to disturb the harmony of the Union. That this conservative\r\nopinion looked upon the repeal of the Missouri Compromise as an act of\r\naggression in the interest of slavery is indicated by Everett's speech,\r\nand this gives the speech its historic significance.\r\n\r\nJudah P. Benjamin may be said to have been the ablest legal defender of\r\nslavery in public life during the decade of 1850-60. His speech on\r\nthe right of property in slaves and the right of slavery to national\r\nprotection in the territories was probably the ablest on that side of\r\nthe controversy. Lincoln's speech on the Dred Scott Decision has been\r\nsubstituted for one by John C. Breckinridge on the same subject; this\r\nwill serve to bring into his true proportions this great leader of the\r\ncombined anti-slavery forces. No voice, in the beginnings of secession\r\nand disunion, could better reflect the positive and uncompromising\r\nRepublicanism of the Northwest than that of Wade. The speech from him\r\nwhich we have appropriated is in many ways worthy of the attention of\r\nthe historical student.\r\n\r\nWe may look to Crittenden as the best expositor of the Crittenden\r\nCompromise, the leading attempt at compromise and conciliation in the\r\nmemorable session of Congress of 1860-61. Crittenden's subject and\r\npersonality add historical prominence to his speech. The Crittenden\r\nCompromise would probably have been accepted by Southern leaders like\r\nDavis and Toombs if it had been acceptable to the Republican leaders\r\nof the North. The failure of that Compromise made disunion and war\r\ninevitable. Jefferson Davis' memorable farewell to the Senate, following\r\nthe assured failure of compromise, seems a fitting close to the period\r\nof our history which brings us to the eve of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Professor Johnston on \"Secession\" is retained as\r\noriginally prepared. A study of the speeches, with this introduction\r\nand the appended notes, will give a fair idea of the political issues\r\ndividing the country in the important years immediately preceding the\r\nwar. Limitations of space prevent the publication of the full speeches\r\nfrom the exhaustive Congressional debates, but in several instances\r\nwhere it has seemed especially desirable omissions from the former\r\nvolume have been supplied with the purpose of more fully representing\r\nthe subjects and the speakers. To the reader who is interested in\r\nhistorical politics in America these productions of great political\r\nleaders need no recommendation from the editor.\r\n\r\nJ. A. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALMON PORTLAND CHASE,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO. (BORN 1808, DIED 1873.)\r\n\r\nON THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA BILL; SENATE,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bill for the organization of the Territories of Nebraska and Kansas\r\nbeing under consideration--Mr. CHASE submitted the following amendment:\r\n\r\nStrike out from section 14 the words \"was superseded by the principles\r\nof the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, and;\r\nso that the clause will read:\r\n\r\n\"That the Constitution, and all laws of the United States which are not\r\nlocally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the\r\nsaid Territory of Nebraska as elsewhere within the United States, except\r\nthe eighth section of the act preparatory to the admission of Missouri\r\ninto the Union, approved March 6, 1820, which is hereby declared\r\ninoperative.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE said:\r\n\r\nMr. President, I had occasion, a few days ago to expose the utter\r\ngroundlessness of the personal charges made by the Senator from Illinois\r\n(Mr. Douglas) against myself and the other signers of the Independent\r\nDemocratic Appeal. I now move to strike from this bill a statement\r\nwhich I will to-day demonstrate to be without any foundation in fact\r\nor history. I intend afterward to move to strike out the whole clause\r\nannulling the Missouri prohibition.\r\n\r\nI enter into this debate, Mr. President, in no spirit of personal\r\nunkindness. The issue is too grave and too momentous for the indulgence\r\nof such feelings. I see the great question before me, and that question\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nSir, these crowded galleries, these thronged lobbies, this full\r\nattendance of the Senate, prove the deep, transcendent interest of the\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nA few days only have elapsed since the Congress of the United States\r\nassembled in this Capitol. Then no agitation seemed to disturb the\r\npolitical elements. Two of the great political parties of the country,\r\nin their national conventions, had announced that slavery agitation was\r\nat an end, and that henceforth that subject was not to be discussed in\r\nCongress or out of Congress. The President, in his annual message, had\r\nreferred to this state of opinion, and had declared his fixed purpose to\r\nmaintain, as far as any responsibility attached to him, the quiet of the\r\ncountry. Let me read a brief extract from that message:\r\n\r\n\"It is no part of my purpose to give prominence to any subject which may\r\nproperly be regarded as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the\r\npeople. But while the present is bright with promise, and the future\r\nfull of demand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence,\r\nthe past can never be without useful lessons of admonition and\r\ninstruction. If its dangers serve not as beacons, they will evidently\r\nfail to fulfil the object of a wise design. When the grave shall have\r\nclosed over all those who are now endeavoring to meet the obligations of\r\nduty, the year 1850 will be recurred to as a period filled with anxious\r\napprehension. A successful war had just terminated. Peace brought with\r\nit a vast augmentation of territory. Disturbing questions arose, bearing\r\nupon the domestic institutions of one portion of the Confederacy, and\r\ninvolving the constitutional rights of the States. But, notwithstanding\r\ndifferences of opinion and sentiment, which then existed in relation\r\nto details and specific provisions, the acquiescence of distinguished\r\ncitizens, whose devotion to the Union can never be doubted, had given\r\nrenewed vigor to our institutions, and restored a sense of repose and\r\nsecurity to the public mind throughout the Confederacy. That this repose\r\nis to suffer no shock during my official term, if I have power to avert\r\nit, those who placed me here may be assured.\"\r\n\r\nThe agreement of the two old political parties, thus referred to by the\r\nChief Magistrate of the country, was complete, and a large majority of\r\nthe American people seemed to acquiesce in the legislation of which he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nA few of us, indeed, doubted the accuracy of these statements, and the\r\npermanency of this repose. We never believed that the acts of 1850 would\r\nprove to be a permanent adjustment of the slavery question. We believed\r\nno permanent adjustment of that question possible except by a return to\r\nthat original policy of the fathers of the Republic, by which slavery\r\nwas restricted within State limits, and freedom, without exception or\r\nlimitation, was intended to be secured to every person outside of State\r\nlimits and under the exclusive jurisdiction of the General Government.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, we only represented a small, though vigorous and growing,\r\nparty in the country. Our number was small in Congress. By some we were\r\nregarded as visionaries--by some as factionists; while almost all agreed\r\nin pronouncing us mistaken.\r\n\r\nAnd so, sir, the country was at peace. As the eye swept the entire\r\ncircumference of the horizon and upward to mid-heaven not a cloud\r\nappeared; to common observation there was no mist or stain upon the\r\nclearness of the sky.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly all is changed. Rattling thunder breaks from the cloudless\r\nfirmament. The storm bursts forth in fury. Warring winds rush into\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n     \"_Eurus, Notusque ruunt, creberque procellis Africus_.\"\r\n\r\nYes, sir, \"_creber procellis Africus_\"--the South wind thick with storm.\r\nAnd now we find ourselves in the midst of an agitation, the end and\r\nissue of which no man can foresee.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, who is responsible for this renewal of strife and controversy?\r\nNot we, for we have introduced no question of territorial slavery into\r\nCongress--not we who are denounced as agitators and factionists. No,\r\nsir: the quietists and the finalists have become agitators; they who\r\ntold us that all agitation was quieted, and that the resolutions of the\r\npolitical conventions put a final period to the discussion of slavery.\r\n\r\nThis will not escape the observation of the country. It is Slavery that\r\nrenews the strife. It is Slavery that again wants room. It is Slavery,\r\nwith its insatiate demands for more slave territory and more slave\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAnd what does Slavery ask for now? Why, sir, it demands that a\r\ntime-honored and sacred compact shall be rescinded--a compact which has\r\nendured through a whole generation--a compact which has been\r\nuniversally regarded as inviolable, North and South--a compact, the\r\nconstitutionality of which few have doubted, and by which all have\r\nconsented to abide.\r\n\r\nIt will not answer to violate such a compact without a pretext. Some\r\nplausible ground must be discovered or invented for such an act; and\r\nsuch a ground is supposed to be found in the doctrine which was advanced\r\nthe other day by the Senator from Illinois, that the compromise acts of\r\n1850 \"superseded \"the prohibition of slavery north of 36° 30', in the\r\nact preparatory for the admission of Missouri. Ay,sir, \"superseded\" is\r\nthe phrase--\"superseded by the principles of the legislation of 1850,\r\ncommonly called the compromise measures.\"\r\n\r\nIt is against this statement, untrue in fact, and without foundation in\r\nhistory, that the amendment which I have proposed is directed.\r\n\r\nSir, this is a novel idea. At the time when these measures were before\r\nCongress in 1850, when the questions involved in them were discussed\r\nfrom day to day, from week to week, and from month to month, in this\r\nSenate chamber, who ever heard that the Missouri prohibition was to be\r\nsuperseded? What man, at what time, in what speech, ever suggested the\r\nidea that the acts of that year were to affect the Missouri compromise?\r\nThe Senator from Illinois the other day invoked the authority of Henry\r\nClay--that departed statesman, in respect to whom, whatever may be the\r\ndifferences of political opinion, none question that, among the great\r\nmen of this country, he stood proudly eminent. Did he, in the report\r\nmade by him as the chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, or in any\r\nspeech in support of the compromise acts, or in any conversation in the\r\ncommittee, or out of the committee, ever even hint at this doctrine of\r\nsupersedure? Did any supporter or any opponent of the compromise\r\nacts ever vindicate or condemn them on the ground that the Missouri\r\nprohibition would be affected by them? Well, sir, the compromise acts\r\nwere passed. They were denounced North, and they were denounced South.\r\nDid any defender of them at the South ever justify his support of them\r\nupon the ground that the South had obtained through them the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri prohibition? Did any objector to them at the North ever\r\neven suggest as a ground of condemnation that that prohibition was swept\r\naway by them? No, sir! No man, North or South, during the whole of\r\nthe discussion of those acts here, or in that other discussion which\r\nfollowed their enactment throughout the country, ever intimated any such\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, let us come to the last session of Congress. A Nebraska bill\r\npassed the House and came to the Senate, and was reported from the\r\nCommittee on Territories by the Senator from Illinois, as its chairman.\r\nWas there any provision in it which even squinted toward this notion of\r\nrepeal by supersedure? Why, sir, Southern gentlemen opposed it on\r\nthe very ground that it left the Territory under the operation of the\r\nMissouri prohibition. The Senator from Illinois made a speech in defence\r\nof it. Did he invoke Southern support upon the ground that it superseded\r\nthe Missouri prohibition? Not at all. Was it opposed or vindicated\r\nby anybody on any such ground? Every Senator knows the contrary. The\r\nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Atchison), now the President of this body,\r\nmade a speech upon the bill, in which he distinctly declared that the\r\nMissouri prohibition was not repealed, and could not be repealed.\r\n\r\nI will send this speech to the Secretary, and ask him to read the\r\nparagraphs marked. The Secretary read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I will now state to the Senate the views which induced me to oppose\r\nthis proposition in the early part of this session.\r\n\r\n\"I had two objections to it. One was that the Indian title in that\r\nTerritory had not been extinguished, or, at least, a very small portion\r\nof it had been. Another was the Missouri compromise, or, as it is\r\ncommonly called, the slavery restriction. It was my opinion at that\r\ntime--and I am not now very clear on that subject--that the law of\r\nCongress, when the State of Missouri was admitted into the Union,\r\nexcluding slavery from the Territory of Louisiana north of 36° 30',\r\nwould be enforced in that Territory unless it was specially rescinded,\r\nand whether that law was in accordance with the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States or not, it would do its work, and that work would be to\r\npreclude slave-holders from going into that Territory. But when I came\r\nto look into that question, I found that there was no prospect, no\r\nhope, of a repeal of the Missouri compromise excluding slavery from that\r\nTerritory. Now, sir, I am free to admit, that at this moment, at this\r\nhour, and for all time to come, I should oppose the organization or\r\nthe settlement of that Territory unless my constituents, and\r\nthe constituents of the whole South--of the slave States of the\r\nUnion,--could go into it upon the same footing, with equal rights and\r\nequal privileges, carrying that species of property with them as other\r\npeople of this Union. Yes, sir, I acknowledge that that would have\r\ngoverned me, but I have no hope that the restriction will ever be\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\n\"I have always been of opinion that the first great error committed\r\nin the political history of this country was the ordinance of 1787,\r\nrendering the Northwest Territory free territory. The next great error\r\nwas the Missouri compromise. But they are both irremediable. There is no\r\nremedy for them. We must submit to them. I am prepared to do it. It is\r\nevident that the Missouri compromise cannot be re-pealed. So far as that\r\nquestion is concerned, we might as well agree to the admission of this\r\nTerritory now as next year, or five or ten years hence.\"--_Congressional\r\nGlobe_, Second Session, 32d Cong., vol. xxvi., page 1113.\r\n\r\nThat, sir, is the speech of the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Atchison),\r\nwhose authority, I think, must go for something upon this question. What\r\ndoes he say? \"When I came to look into that question\"--of the possible\r\nrepeal of the Missouri prohibition--that was the question he was looking\r\ninto--\"I found that there was no prospect, no hope, of a repeal of the\r\nMissouri compromise excluding slavery from that Territory.\" And yet,\r\nsir, at that very moment, according to this new doctrine of the Senator\r\nfrom Illinois, it had been repealed three years!\r\n\r\nWell, the Senator from Missouri said further, that if he thought it\r\npossible to oppose this restriction successfully, he never would consent\r\nto the organization of the territory until it was rescinded. But, said\r\nhe, \"I acknowledge that I have no hope that the restriction will ever be\r\nrepealed.\" Then he made some complaint, as other Southern gentlemen have\r\nfrequently done, of the ordinance of 1787, and the Missouri prohibition;\r\nbut went on to say: \"They are both irremediable; there is no remedy for\r\nthem; we must submit to them; I am prepared to do it; it is evident that\r\nthe Missouri compromise cannot be repealed.\"\r\n\r\nNow, sir, when was this said? It was on the morning of the 4th of March,\r\njust before the close of the last session, when that Nebraska bill,\r\nreported by the Senator from Illinois, which proposed no repeal, and\r\nsuggested no supersedure, was under discussion. I think, sir, that all\r\nthis shows pretty clearly that up to the very close of the last session\r\nof Congress nobody had ever thought of a repeal by supersedure. Then\r\nwhat took place at the commencement of the present session? The Senator\r\nfrom Iowa, early in December, introduced a bill for the organization\r\nof the Territory of Nebraska. I believe it was the same bill which was\r\nunder discussion here at the last session, line for line, word for word.\r\nIf I am wrong, the Senator will correct me.\r\n\r\nDid the Senator from Iowa, then, entertain the idea that the Missouri\r\nprohibition had been superseded? No, sir, neither he nor any other man\r\nhere, so far as could be judged from any discussion, or statement, or\r\nremark, had received this notion.\r\n\r\nWell, on the 4th day of January, the Committee on Territories, through\r\ntheir chairman, the Senator from Illinois, made a report on the\r\nterritorial organization of Nebraska; and that report was accompanied by\r\na bill. Now, sir, on that 4th day of January, just thirty days ago, did\r\nthe Committee on Territories entertain the opinion that the compromise\r\nacts of 1850 superseded the Missouri prohibition? If they did, they were\r\nvery careful to keep it to themselves. We will judge the committee by\r\ntheir own report. What do they say in that? In the first place they\r\ndescribe the character of the controversy, in respect to the Territories\r\nacquired from Mexico. They say that some believed that a Mexican law\r\nprohibiting slavery was in force there, while others claimed that the\r\nMexican law became inoperative at the moment of acquisition, and that\r\nslave-holders could take their slaves into the Territory and hold\r\nthem there under the provisions of the Constitution. The Territorial\r\nCompromise acts, as the committee tell us, steered clear of these\r\nquestions. They simply provided that the States organized out of these\r\nTerritories might come in with or without slavery, as they should elect,\r\nbut did not affect the question whether slaves could or could not be\r\nintroduced before the organization of State governments. That question\r\nwas left entirely to judicial decision.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, what did the committee propose to do with the Nebraska\r\nTerritory? In respect to that, as in respect to the Mexican Territory,\r\ndifferences of opinion exist in relation to the introduction of slaves.\r\nThere are Southern gentlemen who contend that notwithstanding the\r\nMissouri prohibition, they can take their slaves into the territory\r\ncovered by it, and hold them there by virtue of the Constitution. On the\r\nother hand the great majority of the American people, North and South,\r\nbelieve the Missouri prohibition to be constitutional and effectual.\r\nNow, what did the committee pro-pose? Did they propose to repeal the\r\nprohibition? Did they suggest that it had been superseded? Did they\r\nadvance any idea of that kind? No, sir. This is their language:\r\n\r\n\"Under this section, as in the case of the Mexican law in New Mexico\r\nand Utah, it is a disputed point whether slavery is prohibited in the\r\nNebraska country by valid enactment. The decision of this question\r\ninvolves the constitutional power of Congress to pass laws prescribing\r\nand regulating the domestic institutions of the various Territories\r\nof the Union. In the opinion of those eminent statesmen who hold that\r\nCongress is invested with no rightful authority to legislate upon the\r\nsubject of slavery in the Territories, the eighth section of the act\r\npreparatory to the admission of Missouri is null and void, while the\r\nprevailing sentiment in a large portion of the Union sustains the\r\ndoctrine that the Constitution of the United States secures to every\r\ncitizen an inalienable right to move into any of the Territories with\r\nhis property, of whatever kind and description, and to hold and\r\nenjoy the same under the sanction of law. Your committee do not\r\nfeel themselves called upon to enter into the discussion of these\r\ncontroverted questions. They involve the same grave issues which\r\nproduced the agitation, the sectional strife, and the fearful struggle\r\nof 1850.\"\r\n\r\nThis language will bear repetition:\r\n\r\n\"Your committee do not feel themselves called upon to enter into the\r\ndiscussion of these controverted questions. They involve the same grave\r\nissues which produced the agitation, the sectional strife, and the\r\nfearful struggle of 1850.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they go on to say:\r\n\r\n\"Congress deemed it wise and prudent to refrain from deciding the\r\nmatters in controversy then, either by affirming or repealing the\r\nMexican laws, or by an act declaratory of the true intent of the\r\nConstitution and the extent of the protection afforded by it to slave\r\nproperty in the Territories; so your committee are not prepared now\r\nto recommend a departure from the course pursued on that memorable\r\noccasion, either by affirming or repealing the eighth section of\r\nthe Missouri act, or by any act declaratory of the meaning of the\r\nConstitution in respect to the legal points in dispute.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, here are very remarkable facts. The Committee on\r\nTerritories declared that it was not wise, that it was not prudent, that\r\nit was not right, to renew the old controversy, and to arouse agitation.\r\nThey declared that they would abstain from any recommendation of a\r\nrepeal of the prohibition, or of any provision declaratory of the\r\nconstruction of the Constitution in respect to the legal points in\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I am not one of those who suppose that the question\r\nbetween Mexican law and the slave-holding claims was avoided in the\r\nUtah and New Mexico Act; nor do I think that the introduction into the\r\nNebraska bill of the provisions of those acts in respect to slavery\r\nwould leave the question between the Missouri prohibition and the same\r\nslave-holding claims entirely unaffected.' I am of a very different\r\nopinion. But I am dealing now with the report of the Senator from\r\nIllinois, as chairman of the committee, and I show, beyond all\r\ncontroversy, that that report gave no countenance whatever to the\r\ndoctrine of repeal by supersedure.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, the bill reported by the committee was printed in the\r\nWashington Sentinel on Saturday, January 7th. It contained twenty\r\nsections; no more, no less. It contained no provisions in respect to\r\nslavery, except those in the Utah and New Mexico bills. It left those\r\nprovisions to speak for themselves. This was in harmony with the report\r\nof the committee. On the 10th of January--on Tuesday--the act appeared\r\nagain in the Sentinel; but it had grown longer during the interval.\r\nIt appeared now with twenty-one sections. There was a statement in\r\nthe paper that the twenty-first section had been omitted by a clerical\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, it is a singular fact that this twenty-first section is\r\nentirely out of harmony with the committee's report. It undertakes to\r\ndetermine the effect of the provision in the Utah and New Mexico bills.\r\nIt declares, among other things, that all questions pertaining\r\nto slavery in the Territories, and in the new States to be formed\r\ntherefrom, are to be left to the decision of the people residing\r\ntherein, through their appropriate representatives. This provision, in\r\neffect, repealed the Missouri prohibition, which the committee, in their\r\nreport, declared ought not to be done. Is it possible, sir, that this\r\nwas a mere clerical error? May it not be that this twenty-first section\r\nwas the fruit of some Sunday work, between Saturday the 7th, and Tuesday\r\nthe 10th?\r\n\r\nBut, sir, the addition of this section, it seems, did not help the bill.\r\nIt did not, I suppose, meet the approbation of Southern gentlemen,\r\nwho contended that they have a right to take their slaves into the\r\nTerritories, notwithstanding any prohibition, either by Congress or by a\r\nTerritorial Legislature. I dare say it was found that the votes of these\r\ngentlemen could not be had for the bill with that clause in it. It was\r\nnot enough that the committee had abandoned their report, and added\r\nthis twenty-first section, in direct contravention of its reasonings and\r\nprinciples. The twenty-first section itself must be abandoned, and the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri prohibition placed in a shape which would not\r\ndeny the slave-holding claim.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Dixon), on the 16th of January, submitted\r\nan amendment which came square up to repeal, and to the claim. That\r\namendment, probably, produced some fluttering and some consultation. It\r\nmet the views of Southern Senators, and probably determined the shape\r\nwhich the bill has finally assumed. Of the various mutations which it\r\nhas undergone, I can hardly be mistaken in attributing the last to the\r\namendment of the Senator from Kentucky. That there is no effect without\r\na cause, is among our earliest lessons in physical philosophy, and I\r\nknow of no causes which will account for the remarkable changes which\r\nthe bill underwent after the 16th of January, other than that amendment,\r\nand the determination of Southern Senators to support it, and to\r\nvote against any provision recognizing the right of any Territorial\r\nLegislature to prohibit the introduction of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt was just seven days, Mr. President, after the Senator from Kentucky\r\nhad offered his amendment, that a fresh amendment was reported from the\r\nCommittee on Territories, in the shape of a new bill, enlarged to forty\r\nsections. This new bill cuts off from the proposed Territory half\r\na degree of latitude on the south, and divides the residue into\r\ntwo Territories--the southern Territory of Kansas, and the northern\r\nTerritory of Nebraska. It applies to each all the provisions of the\r\nUtah and New Mexico bills; it rejects entirely the twenty-first\r\nclerical-error section, and abrogates the Missouri prohibition by the\r\nvery singular provision, which I will read:\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution and all laws of the United States which are not\r\nlocally inapplicable shall have the same force and effect within the\r\nsaid Territory of Nebraska as elsewhere within the United States, except\r\nthe eighth section of the act preparatory to the admission of Missouri\r\ninto the Union, approved March 6, 1820, which was superseded by the\r\nprinciples of the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise\r\nmeasures, and is therefore declared inoperative.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless, Mr. President, this provision operates as a repeal of the\r\nprohibition. The Senator from Kentucky was right when he said it was in\r\neffect the equivalent of his amendment. Those who are willing to break\r\nup and destroy the old compact of 1820 can vote for this bill with full\r\nassurance that such will be its effect. But I appeal to them not to\r\nvote for this supersedure clause. I ask them not to incorporate into\r\nthe legislation of the country a declaration which every one knows to be\r\nwholly untrue.\r\n\r\nI have said that this doctrine of supersedure is new. I have now proved\r\nthat it is a plant of but ten days' growth. It was never seen or heard\r\nof until the 23d day of January, 1854. It was upon that day that this\r\ntree of Upas was planted; we already see its poison fruits. * * *\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the compromise acts of 1850 were not intended to\r\nintroduce any principles of territorial organization applicable to any\r\nother Territory except that covered by them. The professed object of\r\nthe friends of the compromise acts was to compose the whole slavery\r\nagitation. There were various matters of complaint. The non-surrender\r\nof fugitives from service was one. The existence of slavery and the\r\nslave-trade here in this District and elsewhere, under the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of Congress, was another. The apprehended introduction of\r\nslavery into the Territories furnished other grounds of controversy.\r\nThe slave States complained of the free States, and the free States\r\ncomplained of the slave States. It was supposed by some that this whole\r\nagitation might be stayed, and finally put at rest by skilfully adjusted\r\nlegislation. So, sir, we had the omnibus bill, and its appendages the\r\nfugitive-slave bill and the District slave-trade suppression bill.\r\nTo please the North--to please the free States--California was to be\r\nadmitted, and the slave depots here in the District were to be broken\r\nup. To please the slave States, a stringent fugitive-slave act was to\r\nbe passed, and slavery was to have a chance to get into the new\r\nTerritories. The support of the Senators and Representatives from\r\nTexas was to be gained by a liberal adjustment of boundary, and by the\r\nassumption of a large portion of their State debt. The general result\r\ncontemplated was a complete and final adjustment of all questions\r\nrelating to slavery. The acts passed. A number of the friends of the\r\nacts signed a compact pledging themselves to support no man for any\r\noffice who would in any way renew the agitation. The country was\r\nrequired to acquiesce in the settlement as an absolute finality. No man\r\nconcerned in carrying those measures through Congress, and least of all\r\nthe distinguished man whose efforts mainly contributed to their success,\r\never imagined that in the Territorial acts, which formed a part of the\r\nseries, they were planting the germs of a new agitation. Indeed, I have\r\nproved that one of these acts contained an express stipulation which\r\nprecludes the revival of the agitation in the form in which it is now\r\nthrust upon the country, without manifest disregard of the provisions of\r\nthose acts themselves.\r\n\r\nI have thus proved beyond controversy that the averment of the bill,\r\nwhich my amendment proposes to strike out, is untrue. Senators, will you\r\nunite in a statement which you know to be contradicted by the history of\r\nthe country? Will you incorporate into a public statute an affirmation\r\nwhich is contradicted by every event which attended or followed the\r\nadoption of the compromise acts? Will you here, acting under your high\r\nresponsibility as Senators of the States, assert as a fact, by a solemn\r\nvote, that which the personal recollection of every Senator who was here\r\nduring the discussion of those compromise acts disproves? I will not\r\nbelieve it until I see it. If you wish to break up the time-honored\r\ncompact embodied in the Missouri compromise, transferred into the joint\r\nresolution for the annexation of Texas, preserved and affirmed by these\r\ncompromise acts themselves, do it openly--do it boldly. Repeal the\r\nMissouri prohibition. Repeal it by a direct vote. Do not repeal it by\r\nindirection. Do not \"declare\" it \"inoperative,\" \"because superseded by\r\nthe principles of the legislation of 1850.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, three great eras have marked the history of this country\r\nin respect to slavery. The first may be characterized as the Era of\r\nENFRANCHISEMENT. It commenced with the earliest struggles for national\r\nindependence. The spirit which inspired it animated the hearts and\r\nprompted the efforts of Washington, of Jefferson, of Patrick Henry, of\r\nWythe, of Adams, of Jay, of Hamilton, of Morris--in short, of all the\r\ngreat men of our early history. All these hoped for, all these labored\r\nfor, all these believed in, the final deliverance of the country\r\nfrom the curse of slavery. That spirit burned in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and inspired the provisions of the Constitution, and the\r\nOrdinance of 1787. Under its influence, when in full vigor, State after\r\nState provided for the emancipation of the slaves within their limits,\r\nprior to the adoption of the Constitution. Under its feebler influence\r\nat a later period, and during the administration of Mr. Jefferson, the\r\nimportation of slaves was prohibited into Mississippi and Louisiana, in\r\nthe faint hope that those Territories might finally become free States.\r\nGradually that spirit ceased to influence our public councils, and lost\r\nits control over the American heart and the American policy. Another\r\nera succeeded, but by such imperceptible gradations that the lines which\r\nseparate the two cannot be traced with absolute precision. The facts of\r\nthe two eras meet and mingle as the currents of confluent streams mix\r\nso imperceptibly that the observer cannot fix the spot where the meeting\r\nwaters blend.\r\n\r\nThis second era was the Era of CONSERVATISM. Its great maxim was to\r\npreserve the existing condition. Men said: Let things remain as they\r\nare; let slavery stand where it is; exclude it where it is not; refrain\r\nfrom disturbing the public quiet by agitation; adjust all difficulties\r\nthat arise, not by the application of principles, but by compromises.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that the Senator tells us that slavery was\r\nmaintained in Illinois, both while a Territory and after it became a\r\nState, in despite of the provisions of the ordinance. It is true, sir,\r\nthat the slaves held in the Illinois country, under the French law,\r\nwere not regarded as absolutely emancipated by the provisions of the\r\nordinance. But full effect was given to the ordinance in excluding\r\nthe introduction of slaves, and thus the Territory was preserved\r\nfrom eventually becoming a slave State. The few slave-holders in\r\nthe Territory of Indiana, which then included Illinois, succeeded in\r\nobtaining such an ascendency in its affairs, that repeated applications\r\nwere made not merely by conventions of delegates, but by the Territorial\r\nLegislature itself, for a suspension of the clause in the ordinance\r\nprohibiting slavery. These applications were reported upon by John\r\nRandolph, of Virginia, in the House, and by Mr. Franklin in the Senate.\r\nBoth the reports were against suspension. The grounds stated by Randolph\r\nare specially worthy of being considered now. They are thus stated in\r\nthe report:\r\n\r\n\"That the committee deem it highly dangerous and inexpedient to impair\r\na provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness and prosperity\r\nof the Northwestern country, and to give strength and security to that\r\nextensive frontier. In the salutary operation of this sagacious and\r\nbenevolent restraint, it is believed that the inhabitants of Indiana\r\nwill, at no very distant day, find ample remuneration for a temporary\r\nprivation of labor and of emigration.\"\r\n\r\nSir, these reports, made in 1803 and 1807, and the action of Congress\r\nupon them, in conformity with their recommendation, saved Illinois, and\r\nperhaps Indiana, from becoming slave States. When the people of Illinois\r\nformed their State constitution, they incorporated into it a section\r\nproviding that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall hereafter\r\nbe introduced into this State. The constitution made provision for the\r\ncontinued service of the few persons who were originally held as slaves,\r\nand then bound to service under the Territorial laws, and for the\r\nfreedom of their children, and thus secured the final extinction of\r\nslavery. The Senator thinks that this result is not attributable to the\r\nordinance. I differ from him. But for the ordinance, I have no doubt\r\nslavery would have been introduced into Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio.\r\nIt is something to the credit of the Era of Conservatism, uniting its\r\ninfluences with those of the expiring Era of Enfranchisement, that it\r\nmaintained the ordinance of 1787 in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe Era of CONSERVATISM passed, also by imperceptible gradations, into\r\nthe Era of SLAVERY PROPAGANDISM. Under the influences of this new spirit\r\nwe opened the whole territory acquired from Mexico, except California,\r\nto the ingress of slavery. Every foot of it was covered by a Mexican\r\nprohibition; and yet, by the legislation of 1850, we consented to expose\r\nit to the introduction of slaves. Some, I believe, have actually been\r\ncarried into Utah and New Mexico. They may be few, perhaps, but a few\r\nare enough to affect materially the probable character of their future\r\ngovernments. Under the evil influences of the same spirit, we are now\r\ncalled upon to reverse the original policy of the Republic; to support\r\neven a solemn compact of the conservative period, and open Nebraska to\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nSir, I believe that we are upon the verge of another era. That era will\r\nbe the Era of REACTION. The introduction of this question here, and its\r\ndiscussion, will greatly hasten its advent. We, who insist upon the\r\ndenationalization of slavery, and upon the absolute divorce of the\r\nGeneral Government from all connection with it, will stand with the men\r\nwho favored the compromise acts, and who yet wish to adhere to them,\r\nin their letter and in their spirit, against the repeal of the Missouri\r\nprohibition. But you may pass it here. You may send it to the other\r\nHouse. It may become a law. But its effect will be to satisfy all\r\nthinking men that no compromises with slavery will endure, except so\r\nlong as they serve the interests of slavery; and that there is no safe\r\nand honorable ground for non-slaveholders to stand upon, except that\r\nof restricting slavery within State limits, and excluding it absolutely\r\nfrom the whole sphere of Federal jurisdiction. The old questions between\r\npolitical parties are at rest. No great question so thoroughly possesses\r\nthe public mind as this of slavery. This discussion will hasten the\r\ninevitable reorganization of parties upon the new issues which our\r\ncircumstances suggest. It will light up a fire in the country which may,\r\nperhaps, consume those who kindle it. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD EVERETT,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n(BORN 1794, DIED 1865.)\r\n\r\nON THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA BILL;\r\n\r\nSENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, FEBRUARY 8, 1854\r\n\r\n\r\nI will not take up the time of the Senate by going over the somewhat\r\nembarrassing and perplexed history of the bill, from its first entry\r\ninto the Senate until the present time. I will take it as it now stands,\r\nas it is printed on our tables, and with the amendment which was offered\r\nby the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Douglas) yesterday, and which, iI\r\nsuppose, is now printed, and on our tables; and I will state, as briefly\r\nas I can, the difficulties which I have found in giving my support to\r\nthis bill, either as it stands, or as it will stand when the amendment\r\nshall be adopted. My chief objections are to the provisions on the\r\nsubject of slavery, and especially to the exception which is contained\r\nin the 14th section, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Except the 8th section of the act preparatory to the admission of\r\nMissouri into the Union, approved March 6, 1820, which was superseded\r\nby the principles of the legislation of 1850, commonly called the\r\ncompromise measures, and is hereby declared inoperative.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day before yesterday the chairman of the Committee on Territories\r\nproposed to change the words \"superseded by\" to \"inconsistent with,\"\r\nas expressing more distinctly all that he meant to convey by that\r\nimpression. Yesterday, however, he brought in an amendment drawn up with\r\ngreat skill and care, on notice given the day before, which is to strike\r\nout the words \"which was superseded by the principles of the legislation\r\nof 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, and is hereby declared\r\ninoperative,\" and to insert in lieu of them the following:\r\n\r\n\"Which being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by\r\nCongress with slavery in the States and Territories, as recognized by\r\nthe legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, is\r\nhereby declared inoperative and void; it being the true intent and\r\nmeaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or\r\nState, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof\r\nperfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their\r\nown way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I think, in the first place, that the language of this\r\nproposed enactment, being obscure, is of somewhat doubtful import, and\r\nfor that reason, unsatisfactory. I should have preferred a little more\r\ndirectness. What is the condition of an enactment which is declared by a\r\nsubsequent act of Congress to be \"inoperative and void?\" Does it remain\r\nin force? I take it, not. That would be a contradiction in terms, to say\r\nthat an enactment which had been declared by act of Congress inoperative\r\nand void is still in force. Then, if it is not in force, if it is not\r\nonly inoperative and void, as it is to be declared, but is not in force,\r\nit is of course repealed. If it is to be repealed, why not say so?\r\nI think it would have been more direct and more parliamentary to say\r\n\"shall be and is hereby repealed.\" Then we should know precisely, so far\r\nas legal and technical terms go, what the amount of this new legislative\r\nprovision is.\r\n\r\nIf the form is somewhat objectionable, I think the substance is still\r\nmore so. The amendment is to strike out the words \"which was superseded\r\nby,\" and to insert a provision that the act of 1820 is inconsistent\r\nwith the principle of congressional non-intervention, and is therefore\r\ninoperative and void. I do not quite understand how much is conveyed\r\nin this language. The Missouri restriction of 1820, it is said, is\r\ninconsistent with the principle of the legislation of 1850. If anything\r\nmore is meant by \"the principle\" of the legislation of 1850, than the\r\nmeasures which were adopted at that time in reference to the territories\r\nof New Mexico and Utah--for I may assume that those are the legislative\r\nmeasures referred to--if anything more is meant than that a certain\r\nmeasure was adopted, and enacted in reference to those territories, I\r\ntake issue on that point. I do not know that it could be proved that,\r\neven in reference to those territories, a principle was enacted at all.\r\nA certain measure, or, if you please, a course of measures, was enacted\r\nin reference to the Territories of New Mexico and Utah; but I do not\r\nknow that you can call this enacting a principle. It is certainly\r\nnot enacting a principle which is to carry with it a rule for other\r\nTerritories lying in other parts of the country, and in a different\r\nlegal position. As to the principle of non-intervention on the part\r\nof Congress in the question of slavery, I do not find that, either as\r\nprinciple or as measure, it was enacted in those territorial bills of\r\n1850. I do not, unless I have greatly misread them, find that there is\r\nanything at all which comes up to that. Every legislative act of those\r\nterritorial governments must come before Congress for allowance or\r\ndisallowance, and under those bills without repealing them, without\r\ndeparting from them in the slightest degree, it would be competent for\r\nCongress to-morrow to pass any law on that subject.\r\n\r\nHow then can it be said that the principle of non-intervention on the\r\npart of Congress in the subject of slavery was enacted and established\r\nby the compromise measures of 1850? But, whether that be so or not, how\r\ncan you find, in a simple measure applying in terms to these individual\r\nTerritories, and to them alone, a rule which is to govern all other\r\nTerritories with a retrospective and with a prospective action? Is\r\nit not a mere begging of the question to say that those compromise\r\nmeasures, adopted in this specific case, amount to such a general rule?\r\n\r\nBut, let us try it in a parallel case. In the earlier land legislation\r\nof the United States, it was customary, without exception, when a\r\nTerritory became a State, to require that there should be a stipulation\r\nin their State constitution that the public lands sold within their\r\nborders should be exempted from taxation for five years after the sale.\r\nThis, I believe, continued to be the uniform practice down to the year\r\n1820, when the State of Missouri was admitted. She was admitted under\r\nthe stipulation. If I mistake not, the next State which was admitted\r\ninto the Union--but it is not important whether it was the next or\r\nnot--came in without that stipulation, and they were left free to tax\r\nthe public lands the moment when they were sold. Here was a principle;\r\nas much a principle as it is contended was established in the Utah and\r\nNew Mexico territorial bill; but did any one suppose that it acted upon\r\nthe other Territories? I believe the whole system is now abolished under\r\nthe operation of general laws, and the influence of that example may\r\nhave led to the change. But, until it was made by legislation, the mere\r\nfact that public lands sold in Arkansas were immediately subject to\r\ntaxation, could not alter the law in regard to the public lands sold in\r\nMissouri, or in any other to where they were they were exempt.\r\n\r\nThere is a case equally analogous to the very matter we are now\r\nconsidering--the prohibition or permission of slavery. The ordinance of\r\n1787 prohibited slavery in the territory northwest of the Ohio. In 1790\r\nCongress passed an act accepting the cession which the State of North\r\nCarolina had made of the western part of her territory, with the\r\nproviso, that in reference to the territory thus ceded Congress should\r\npass no laws \"tending to the emancipation of the slaves.\" Here was a\r\nprecisely parallel case. Here was a territory in which, in 1787, slavery\r\nwas prohibited. Here was a territory ceded by North Carolina, which\r\nbecame the territory of the United States south of the Ohio, in\r\nreference to which it was stipulated with North Carolina, that Congress\r\nshould pass no laws tending to the emancipation of slaves. But I believe\r\nit never occurred to any one that the legislation of 1790 acted back\r\nupon the ordinance of 1787, or furnished a rule by which any effect\r\ncould be produced upon the state of things existing under that\r\nordinance, in the territory to which it applied.\r\n\r\nI certainly intend to do the distinguished chairman of the committee\r\nno injustice; and I am not sure that I fully comprehend his argument in\r\nthis respect; but I think his report sustains the view which I now take\r\nof the subject: that is, that the legislation of 1850 did not establish\r\na principle which was designed to have any such effect as he intimates.\r\nThat report states how matters stood in those new Mexican territories.\r\nIt was alleged on the one hand that by the Mexican _lex loci_ slavery\r\nwas prohibited. On the other hand that was denied, and it was maintained\r\nthat the Constitution of the United States secures to every citizen the\r\nright to go there and take with him any property recognized as such\r\nby any of the States of the Union. The report considers that a similar\r\nstate of things now exists in Nebraska--that the validity of the eighth\r\nsection of the Missouri Act, by which slavery is prohibited in that\r\nTerritory, is doubtful, and that it is maintained by many distinguished\r\nstatesmen that Congress has no power to legislate on the subject.\r\nThen, in this state of the controversy, the report maintains that\r\nthe legislation of Congress in 1850 did not undertake to decide these\r\nquestions. Surely, if they did not undertake to decide them, they could\r\nnot settle the principle which is at stake in them; and, unless they did\r\ndecide them, the measures then adopted must be considered as specific\r\nmeasures, relating only to those case and not establishing a principle\r\nof general operation. This seems to me to be as direct and conclusive as\r\nanything can be.\r\n\r\nAt all events, these are not impressions which are put forth by me under\r\nthe exigencies of the present debate or of the present occasion. I have\r\nnever entertained any other opinion. I was called upon for a particular\r\npurpose, of a literary nature, to which I will presently allude more\r\ndistinctly, shortly after the close of the session of 1850, to draw up a\r\nnarrative of the events that had taken place relative to the passage of\r\nthe compromise measures of that year. I had not, I own, the best sources\r\nof information. I was not a member of Congress, and had not heard\r\nthe debates, which is almost indispensable to come to a thorough\r\nunderstanding of questions of this nature; but I inquired of those who\r\nhad heard them, I read the reports, and I had an opportunity of personal\r\nintercourse with some who had taken a prominent part in all those\r\nmeasures. I never formed the idea--I never received the intimation until\r\nI got it from this report of the committee--that those measures were\r\nintended to have any effect beyond the Territories of Utah and New\r\nMexico, for which they were enacted. I cannot but think that if it\r\nwas intended that they should have any larger application, if it was\r\nintended that they should furnish the rule which is now supposed, it\r\nwould have been a fact as notorious as the light of day.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, having alluded to the speech of Mr. Webster, of the 7th\r\nMarch, 1850, allow me to dwell upon it for a moment. I was in a position\r\nthe next year--having been requested by that great and lamented man to\r\nsuperintend the publication of his works--to know very particularly the\r\ncomparative estimate which he placed upon his own parliamentary efforts.\r\nHe told me more than once that he thought his second speech on Foot's\r\nresolution was that in which he had best succeeded as a senatorial\r\neffort, and as a specimen of parliamentary dialectics; but he added,\r\nwith an emotion which even he was unable to suppress, \"The speech of the\r\n7th of March, 1850, much as I have been reviled for it, when I am dead,\r\nwill be allowed to be of the greatest importance to the country.\" Sir,\r\nhe took the greatest interest in that speech. He wished it to go forth\r\nwith a specific title; and, after considerable deliberation, it was\r\ncalled, by his own direction, \"A Speech for the Constitution and the\r\nUnion.\" He inscribed it to the people of Massachusetts, in a dedication\r\nof the most emphatic tenderness, and he prefixed to it that motto--which\r\nyou all remember--from Livy, the most appropriate and felicitous\r\nquotation, perhaps, that was ever made: \"True things rather than\r\npleasant things\"--_Vera progratis:_ and with that he sent it forth to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIn that speech his gigantic intellect brought together all that it\r\ncould gather from the law of nature, from the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, from our past legislation, and from the physical features of\r\nthe region, to strengthen him in that plan of conciliation and peace,\r\nin which he feared that he might not carry along with him the public\r\nsentiment of the whole of that, portion of the country which he\r\nparticularly represented here. At its close, when he dilated upon the\r\ndisastrous effects of separation, he rose to a strain of impassioned\r\neloquence which had never been surpassed within these walls. Every\r\ntopic, every argument, every fact, was brought to bear upon the point;\r\nand he felt that all his vast popularity was at stake on the issue. Let\r\nme commend to the attention of Senators, and let me ask them to consider\r\nwhat weight is due to the authority of such a man, speaking under such\r\ncircumstances, and on such an occasion, when he tells you that\r\nthe condition of every foot of land in the country, for slavery or\r\nnon-slavery, is fixed by some irrepealable law. And you are now about\r\nto repeal the principal law which ascertained and fixed that condition.\r\nAnd, sir, if the Senate will take any heed of the opinion of one so\r\nhumble as myself, I will say that I believe Mr. Webster, in that speech,\r\nwent to the very verge of the public sentiment in the non-slaveholding\r\nStates, and that to have gone a hair's-breadth further, would have been\r\na step too bold even for his great weight of character.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, sir, that the compromise measures of 1850 ended\r\nwhere they began, with the Territories of Utah and New Mexico, to\r\nwhich they specifically referred; at any rate, that they established\r\nno principle which was to govern in other cases; that they had no\r\nprospective action to the organization of territories in all future\r\ntime; and certainly no retrospective action upon lands subject to the\r\nrestriction of 1820, and to the positive enactment that you now propose\r\nto declare inoperative and void.\r\n\r\nI trust that nothing which I have now said will be taken in derogation\r\nof the compromises of 1850. I adhere to them; I stand by them. I do so\r\nfor many reasons. One is respect for the memory of the great men who\r\nwere the authors of them--lights and ornaments of the country, but now\r\ntaken from its service. I would not so soon, if it were in my power,\r\nundo their work, if for no other reason. But beside this, I am one of\r\nthose--I am not ashamed to avow it--who believed at that time, and who\r\nstill believe, that at that period the union of these States was in\r\ngreat danger, and that the adoption of the compromise measures of 1850\r\ncontributed materially to avert that danger; and therefore, sir, I\r\nsay, as well out of respect to the memory of the great men who were the\r\nauthors of them, as to the healing effect of the measures themselves,\r\nI would adhere to them. They are not perfect. I suppose that nobody,\r\neither North or South, thinks them perfect. They contain some provisions\r\nnot satisfactory to the South, and other provisions contrary to the\r\npublic sentiment of the North; but I believed at the time they were\r\nthe wisest, the best, the most effective measures which, under the\r\ncircumstances, could be adopted. But you do not strengthen them, you do\r\nnot show your respect for them, by giving them an application which they\r\nwere never intended to bear.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA single word, sir, in respect to this supposed principle of\r\nnon-intervention on the part of Congress in the subject of slavery in\r\nthe territories. I confess I am surprised to find this brought forward,\r\nand stated with so much confidence, as an established principle of the\r\nGovernment. I know that distinguished gentlemen hold the opinion. The\r\nvery distinguished Senator from Michigan (Mr. Cass) holds it, and has\r\npropounded it; and I pay all due respect and deference to his authority,\r\nwhich I conceive to be very high. But I was not aware that any such\r\nprinciple was considered a settled principle of the territorial policy\r\nof this country. Why, sir, from the first enactment in 1789, down to the\r\nbill before us, there is no such principle in our legislation. As far as\r\nI can see it would be perfectly competent even now for Congress to pass\r\nany law that they pleased on the subject in the Territories under this\r\nbill. But however that may be, even by this bill, there is not a law\r\nwhich the Territories can pass admitting or excluding slavery, which it\r\nis of in the power of this Congress to disallow the next day. This\r\nis not a mere _brutum fulmen_. It is not an unexpected power. Your\r\nstatute-book shows case after case. I believe, in reference to a\r\nsingle Territory, that there have been fifteen or twenty cases where\r\nterritorial legislation has been disallowed by Congress. How, then, can\r\nit be said that this principle of non-intervention in the government of\r\nthe Territories is now to be recognized as an established principle in\r\nthe public policy of the Congress of the United States?\r\n\r\nDo gentlemen recollect the terms, almost of disdain, with which this\r\nsupposed established principle of our constitutional policy is treated\r\nin that last valedictory speech of Mr. Calhoun, which, unable to\r\npronounce it himself, he was obliged to give to the Senate through the\r\nmedium of his friend, the Senator from Virginia. He reminded the Senate\r\nthat the occupants of a Territory were not even called the people--but\r\nsimply the inhabitants--till they were allowed by Congress to call a\r\nconvention and form a State constitution.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA word more, sir, and I have done. With reference to the great question\r\nof slavery--that terrible question--the only one on which the North and\r\nSouth of this great Republic differ irreconcilably--I have not, on this\r\noccasion, a word to say. My humble career is drawing near its close,\r\nand I shall end it as I began, with using no other words on that subject\r\nthan those of moderation, conciliation, and harmony between the two\r\ngreat sections of the country. I blame no one who differs from me in\r\nthis respect. I allot to others, what I claim for myself, the credit of\r\nhonesty and purity of motive. But for my own part, the rule of my life,\r\nas far as circumstances have enabled me to act up to it, has been, to\r\nsay nothing that would tend to kindle unkind feeling on this subject. I\r\nhave never known men on this, or any other subject, to be convinced by\r\nharsh epithets or denunciation.\r\n\r\nI believe the union of these States is the greatest possible\r\nblessing--that it comprises within itself all other blessings,\r\npolitical, national, and social; and I trust that my eyes may close long\r\nbefore the day shall come--if it ever shall come--when that Union shall\r\nbe at an end. Sir, I share the opinions and the sentiments of the part\r\nof the country where I was born and educated, where my ashes will be\r\nlaid, and where my children will succeed me. But in relation to my\r\nfellow-citizens in other parts of the country, I will treat their\r\nconstitutional and their legal rights with respect, and their characters\r\nand their feelings with tenderness. I believe them to be as good\r\nChristians, as good patriots, as good men, as we are, and I claim that\r\nwe, in our turn, are as good as they.\r\n\r\nI rejoiced to hear my friend from Kentucky, (Mr. Dixon), if he will\r\nallow me to call him so--I concur most heartily in the sentiment--utter\r\nthe opinion that a wise and gracious Providence, in his own good time,\r\nwill find the ways and the channels to remove from the land what I\r\nconsider this great evil, but I do not expect that what has been done in\r\nthree centuries and a half is to be undone in a day or a year, or a few\r\nyears; and I believe that, in the mean time, the desired end will be\r\nretarded rather than promoted by passionate sectional agitation. I\r\nbelieve, further, that the fate of the great and interesting continent\r\nin the elder world, Africa, is closely intertwined and wrapped up with\r\nthe fortunes of her children in all the parts of the earth to which they\r\nhave been dispersed, and that at some future time, which is already\r\nin fact beginning, they will go back to the land of their fathers, the\r\nvoluntary missionaries of Civilization and Christianity; and finally,\r\nsir, I doubt not that in His own good time the Ruler of all will\r\nvindicate the most glorious of His prerogatives, \"From seeming evil\r\nstill educing good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN ARNOLD DOUGLAS,\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS. (BORN 1813, DIED 1861.)\r\n\r\nON THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA BILL;\r\n\r\nSENATE, MARCH 3, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been urged in debate that there is no necessity for these\r\nTerritorial organizations; and I have been called upon to point out any\r\npublic and national considerations which require action at this time.\r\nSenators seem to forget that our immense and valuable possessions on the\r\nPacific are separated from the States and organized Territories on this\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains by a vast wilderness, filled by hostile\r\nsavages--that nearly a hundred thousand emigrants pass through this\r\nbarbarous wilderness every year, on their way to California\r\nand Oregon--that these emigrants are American citizens, our own\r\nconstituents, who are entitled to the protection of law and government,\r\nand that they are left to make their way, as best they may, without the\r\nprotection or aid of law or government. The United States mails for New\r\nMexico and Utah, and official communications between this Government and\r\nthe authorities of those Territories, are required to be carried over\r\nthese wild plains, and through the gorges of the mountains, where you\r\nhave made no provisions for roads, bridges, or ferries to facilitate\r\ntravel, or forts or other means of safety to protect life. As often as I\r\nhave brought forward and urged the adoption of measures to remedy these\r\nevils, and afford security against the damages to which our people are\r\nconstantly exposed, they have been promptly voted down as not being\r\nof sufficient importance to command the favorable consideration of\r\nCongress. Now, when I propose to organize the Territories, and allow\r\nthe people to do for themselves what you have so often refused to do for\r\nthem, I am told that there are not white inhabitants enough permanently\r\nsettled in the country to require and sustain a government. True; there\r\nis not a very large population there, for the very reason that your\r\nIndian code and intercourse laws exclude the settlers, and forbid their\r\nremaining there to cultivate the soil. You refuse to throw the\r\ncountry open to settlers, and then object to the organization of the\r\nTerritories, upon the ground that there is not a sufficient number of\r\ninhabitants. * * *\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to the consideration of the great principle involved\r\nin the bill, without omitting, however, to notice some of those\r\nextraneous matters which have been brought into this discussion with the\r\nview of producing another anti-slavery agitation. We have been told by\r\nnearly every Senator who has spoken in opposition to this bill, that\r\nat the time of its introduction the people were in a state of profound\r\nquiet and repose, that the anti-slavery agitation had entirely ceased,\r\nand that the whole country was acquiescing cheerfully and cordially\r\nin the compromise measures of 1850 as a final adjustment of this vexed\r\nquestion. Sir, it is truly refreshing to hear Senators, who contested\r\nevery inch of ground in opposition to those measures, when they were\r\nunder discussion, who predicted all manner of evils and calamities from\r\ntheir adoption, and who raised the cry of appeal, and even resistance,\r\nto their execution, after they had become the laws of the land--I say it\r\nis really refreshing to hear these same Senators now bear their united\r\ntestimony to the wisdom of those measures, and to the patriotic\r\nmotives which induced us to pass them in defiance of their threats and\r\nresistance, and to their beneficial effects in restoring peace, harmony,\r\nand fraternity to a distracted country. These are precious confessions\r\nfrom the lips of those who stand pledged never to assent to the\r\npropriety of those measures, and to make war upon them, so long as\r\nthey shall remain upon the statute-book. I well understand that these\r\nconfessions are now made, not with the view of yielding their assent to\r\nthe propriety of carrying those enactments into faithful execution, but\r\nfor the purpose of having a pretext for charging upon me, as the author\r\nof this bill, the responsibility of an agitation which they are striving\r\nto produce. They say that I, and not they, have revived the agitation.\r\nWhat have I done to render me obnoxious to this charge? They say that I\r\nwrote and introduced this Nebraska bill. That is true; but I was not a\r\nvolunteer in the transaction. The Senate, by a unanimous vote,\r\nappointed me chairman of the Territorial Committee, and associated five\r\nintelligent and patriotic Senators with me, and thus made it our duty\r\nto take charge of all Territorial business. In like manner, and with the\r\nconcurrence of these complaining Senators, the Senate referred to us a\r\ndistinct proposition to organize this Nebraska Territory, and required\r\nus to report specifically upon the question. I repeat, then, we were not\r\nvolunteers in this business. The duty was imposed upon us by the\r\nSenate. We were not unmindful of the delicacy and responsibility of the\r\nposition. We were aware that, from 1820 to 1850, the abolition doctrine\r\nof Congressional interference with slavery in the Territories and new\r\nStates had so far prevailed as to keep up an incessant slavery agitation\r\nin Congress, and throughout the country, whenever any new Territory was\r\nto be acquired or organized. We were also aware that, in 1850, the right\r\nof the people to decide this question for themselves, subject only\r\nto the Constitution, was submitted for the doctrine of Congressional\r\nintervention. This first question, therefore, which the committee were\r\ncalled upon to decide, and indeed the only question of any material\r\nimportance in framing this bill, was this: Shall we adhere to and carry\r\nout the principle recognized by the compromise measures of 1850,\r\nor shall we go back to the old exploded doctrine of Congressional\r\ninterference, as established in 1820, in a large portion of the country,\r\nand which it was the object of the Wilmot proviso to give a universal\r\napplication, not only to all the territory which we then possessed, but\r\nall which we might hereafter acquire? There are no alternatives. We\r\nwere compelled to frame the bill upon the one or the other of these two\r\nprinciples. The doctrine of 1820 or the doctrine of 1850 must prevail.\r\nIn the discharge of the duty imposed upon us by the Senate, the\r\ncommittee could not hesitate upon this point, whether we consulted our\r\nown individual opinions and principles, or those which were known to be\r\nentertained and boldly avowed by a large majority of the Senate. The two\r\ngreat political parties of the country stood solemnly pledged before the\r\nworld to adhere to the compromise measures of 1850, \"in principle and\r\nsubstance.\" A large majority of the Senate--indeed, every member of the\r\nbody, I believe, except the two avowed Abolitionists (Mr. Chase and Mr.\r\nSumner)--profess to belong to one or the other of these parties, and\r\nhence were supposed to be under a high moral obligation to carry out\r\n\"the principle and substance\" of those measures in all new Territorial\r\norganizations. The report of the committee was in accordance with\r\nthis obligation. I am arraigned, therefore, for having endeavored to\r\nrepresent the opinions and principles of the Senate truly--for having\r\nperformed my duty in conformity with parliamentary law--for having been\r\nfaithful to the trust imposed in me by the Senate. Let the vote\r\nthis night determine whether I have thus faithfully represented your\r\nopinions. When a majority of the Senate shall have passed the bill--when\r\nthe majority of the States shall have endorsed it through their\r\nrepresentatives upon this floor--when a majority of the South and a\r\nmajority of the North shall have sanctioned it--when a majority of the\r\nWhig party and a majority of the Democratic party shall have voted for\r\nit--when each of these propositions shall be demonstrated by the vote\r\nthis night on the final passage of the bill, I shall be willing to\r\nsubmit the question to the country, whether, as the organ of the\r\ncommittee, I performed my duty in the report and bill which have called\r\ndown upon my head so much denunciation and abuse.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the opponents of this measure have had much to say about\r\nthe mutations and modifications which this bill has undergone since it\r\nwas first introduced by myself, and about the alleged departure of the\r\nbill, in its present form, from the principle laid down in the original\r\nreport of the committee as a rule of action in all future Territorial\r\norganizations. Fortunately there is no necessity, even if your patience\r\nwould tolerate such a course of argument at this late hour of the night,\r\nfor me to examine these speeches in detail, and reply to each charge\r\nseparately. Each speaker seems to have followed faithfully in the\r\nfootsteps of his leader in the path marked out by the Abolition\r\nconfederates in their manifesto, which I took occasion to expose on a\r\nformer occasion. You have seen them on their winding way, meandering\r\nthe narrow and crooked path in Indian file, each treading close upon the\r\nheels of the other, and neither venturing to take a step to the right or\r\nleft, or to occupy one inch of ground which did not bear the footprint\r\nof the Abolition champion. To answer one, therefore, is to answer the\r\nwhole. The statement to which they seem to attach the most importance,\r\nand which they have repeated oftener, perhaps, than any other, is, that,\r\npending the compromise measures of 1850, no man in or out of Congress\r\never dreamed of abrogating the Missouri compromise; that from that\r\nperiod down to the present session nobody supposed that its validity had\r\nbeen impaired, or any thing done which endered it obligatory upon us to\r\nmake it inoperative hereafter; that at the time of submitting the report\r\nand bill to the Senate, on the fourth of January last, neither I nor any\r\nmember of the committee ever thought of such a thing; and that we could\r\nnever be brought to the point of abrogating the eighth section of\r\nthe Missouri act until after the Senator from Kentucky introduced his\r\namendment to my bill.\r\n\r\nMr. President, before I proceed to expose the many misrepresentations\r\ncontained in this complicated charge, I must call the attention of\r\nthe Senate to the false issue which these gentlemen are endeavoring to\r\nimpose upon the country, for the purpose of diverting public attention\r\nfrom the real issue contained in the bill. They wish to have the people\r\nbelieve that the abrogation of what they call the Missouri compromise\r\nwas the main object and aim of the bill, and that the only question\r\ninvolved is, whether the prohibition of slavery north of 36° 30'\r\nshall be repealed or not? That which is a mere incident they choose to\r\nconsider the principle. They make war on the means by which we propose to\r\naccomplish an object, instead of openly resisting the object itself.\r\nThe principle which we propose to carry into effect by the bill is this:\r\nThat Congress shall neither legislate slavery into any Territories\r\nor State, nor out of the same; but the people shall be left free to\r\nregulate their domestic concerns in their own way, subject only to the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry this principle into practical operation, it becomes\r\nnecessary to remove whatever legal obstacles might be found in the way\r\nof its free exercise. It is only for the purpose of carrying out this\r\ngreat fundamental principle of self-government that the bill renders the\r\neighth section of the Missouri act inoperative and void.\r\n\r\nNow, let me ask, will these Senators who have arraigned me, or any one\r\nof them, have the assurance to rise in his place and declare that this\r\ngreat principle was never thought of or advocated as applicable to\r\nTerritorial bills, in 1850; that from that session until the present,\r\nnobody ever thought of incorporating this principle in all new\r\nTerritorial organizations; that the Committee on Territories did not\r\nrecommend it in their report; and that it required the amendment of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky to bring us up to that point? Will any one of my\r\naccusers dare to make this issue, and let it be tried by the record? I\r\nwill begin with the compromises of 1850, Any Senator who will take the\r\ntrouble to examine our journals, will find that on the 25th of March\r\nof that year I reported from the Committee on Territories two bills\r\nincluding the following measures; the admission of California, a\r\nTerritorial government for New Mexico, and the adjustment of the Texas\r\nboundary. These bills proposed to leave the people of Utah and New\r\nMexico free to decide the slavery question for themselves, in the\r\nprecise language of the Nebraska bill now under discussion. A few weeks\r\nafterward the committee of thirteen took those two bills and put a wafer\r\nbetween them, and reported them back to the Senate as one bill,\r\nwith some slight amendments. One of these amendments was, that the\r\nTerritorial Legislatures should not legislate upon the subject of\r\nAfrican slavery. I objected to that provision upon the ground that it\r\nsubverted the great principle of self-government upon which the bill had\r\nbeen originally framed by the Territorial Committee. On the first trial,\r\nthe Senate refused to strike it out, but subsequently did so, after full\r\ndebate, in order to establish that principle as the rule of action in\r\nTerritorial organizations. * * * But my accusers attempt to raise up a\r\nfalse issue, and thereby divert public attention from the real one, by\r\nthe cry that the Missouri compromise is to be repealed or violated by\r\nthe passage of this bill. Well, if the eighth section of the Missouri\r\nact, which attempted to fix the destinies of future generations in those\r\nTerritories for all time to come, in utter disregard of the rights and\r\nwishes of the people when they should be received into the Union as\r\nStates, be inconsistent with the great principles of self-government\r\nand the Constitution of the United States. it ought to be abrogated.\r\nThe legislation of 1850 abrogated the Missouri compromise, so far as the\r\ncountry embraced within the limits of Utah and New Mexico was covered\r\nby the slavery restriction. It is true, that those acts did not in\r\nterms and by name repeal the act of 1820, as originally adopted, or as\r\nextended by the resolutions annexing Texas in 1845, any more than the\r\nreport of the Committee on Territories proposed to repeal the same acts\r\nthis session. But the acts of 1850 did authorize the people of those\r\nTerritories to exercise \"all rightful powers of legislation consistent\r\nwith the Constitution,\" not excepting the question of slavery; and did\r\nprovide that, when those Territories should be admitted into the Union,\r\nthey should be received with or without slavery as the people thereof\r\nmight determine at the date of their admission. These provisions were\r\nin direct conflict with a clause in the former enactment, declaring that\r\nslavery should be forever prohibited in any portion of said Territories,\r\nand hence rendered such clause inoperative and void to the extent of\r\nsuch conflict. This was an inevitable consequence, resulting from the\r\nprovisions in those acts, which gave the people the right to decide the\r\nslavery question for themselves, in conformity with the Constitution.\r\nIt was not necessary to go further and declare that certain previous\r\nenactments, which were incompatible with the exercise of the powers\r\nconferred in the bills, are hereby repealed. The very act of\r\ngranting those powers and rights has the legal effect of removing all\r\nobstructions to the exercise of them by the people, as prescribed\r\nin those Territorial bills. Following that example, the Committee on\r\nTerritories did not consider it necessary to declare the eighth section\r\nof the Missouri act repealed. We were content to organize Nebraska in\r\nthe precise language of the Utah and New Mexico bills. Our object was\r\nto leave the people entirely free to form and regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions and internal concerns in their own way, under the\r\nConstitution; and we deemed it wise to accomplish that object in the\r\nexact terms in which the same thing had been done in Utah and New Mexico\r\nby the acts of 1850. This was the principle upon which the committee\r\nvoted; and our bill was supposed, and is now believed, to have been in\r\naccordance with it. When doubts were raised whether the bill did fully\r\ncarry out the principle laid down in the report, amendments were made\r\nfrom time to time, in order to avoid all misconstruction, and make the\r\ntrue intent of the act more explicit. The last of these amendments was\r\nadopted yesterday, on the motion of the distinguished Senator from\r\nNorth Carolina (Mr. Badger), in regard to the revival of any laws or\r\nregulations which may have existed prior to 1820. That amendment was not\r\nintended to change the legal effect of the bill. Its object was to repel\r\nthe slander which had been propagated by the enemies of the measure in\r\nthe North--that the Southern supporters of the bill desired to legislate\r\nslavery into these Territories. The South denies the right of Congress\r\neither to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, or out of any\r\nTerritory or State. Non-intervention by Congress with slavery in\r\nthe States or Territories is the doctrine of the bill, and all the\r\namendments which have been agreed to have been made with the view of\r\nremoving all doubt and cavil as to the true meaning and object of the\r\nmeasure. * * *\r\n\r\nWell, sir, what is this Missouri compromise, of which we have heard\r\nso much of late? It has been read so often that it is not necessary\r\nto occupy the time of the Senate in reading it again. It was an act of\r\nCongress, passed on the 6th of March, 1820, to authorize the people of\r\nMissouri to form a constitution and a State government, preparatory to\r\nthe admission of such State into the Union. The first section provided\r\nthat Missouri should be received into the Union \"on an equal footing\r\nwith the original States in all respects whatsoever.\" The last and\r\neighth section provided that slavery should be \"forever prohibited\" in\r\nall the territory which had been acquired from France north of 36° 30',\r\nand not included within the limits of the State of Missouri. There\r\nis nothing in the terms of the law that purports to be a compact,\r\nor indicates that it was any thing more than an ordinary act of\r\nlegislation. To prove that it was more than it purports to be on its\r\nface, gentlemen must produce other evidence, and prove that there was\r\nsuch an understanding as to create a moral obligation in the nature of a\r\ncompact. Have they shown it?\r\n\r\nNow, if this was a compact, let us see how it was entered into. The bill\r\noriginated in the House of Representatives, and passed that body without\r\na Southern vote in its favor. It is proper to remark, however, that it\r\ndid not at that time contain the eighth section, prohibiting slavery in\r\nthe Territories; but in lieu of it, contained a provision prohibiting\r\nslavery in the proposed State of Missouri. In the Senate, the clause\r\nprohibiting slavery in the State was stricken out, and the eighth\r\nsection added to the end of the bill, by the terms of which slavery was\r\nto be forever prohibited in the territory not embraced in the State of\r\nMissouri north of 36° 30'. The vote on adding this section stood in the\r\nSenate, 34 in the affirmative, and 10 in the negative. Of the Northern\r\nSenators, 20 voted for it, and 2 against it. On the question of ordering\r\nthe bill to a third reading as amended, which was the test vote on its\r\npassage, the vote stood 24 yeas and 20 nays. Of the Northern Senators,\r\n4 only voted in the affirmative, and 18 in the negative. Thus it will be\r\nseen that if it was intended to be a compact, the North never agreed to\r\nit. The Northern Senators voted to insert the prohibition of slavery in\r\nthe Territories; and then, in the proportion of more than four to one,\r\nvoted against the passage of the bill. The North, therefore, never\r\nsigned the compact, never consented to it, never agreed to be bound by\r\nit. This fact becomes very important in vindicating the character of the\r\nNorth for repudiating this alleged compromise a few months afterward.\r\nThe act was approved and became a law on the 6th of March, 1820. In the\r\nsummer of that year, the people of Missouri formed a constitution and\r\nState government preparatory to admission into the Union in conformity\r\nwith the act. At the next session of Congress the Senate passed a joint\r\nresolution declaring Missouri to be one of the States of the Union, on\r\nan equal footing with the original States. This resolution was sent to\r\nthe House of Representatives, where it was rejected by Northern votes,\r\nand thus Missouri was voted out of the Union, instead of being received\r\ninto the Union under the act of the 6th of March, 1820, now known as the\r\nMissouri compromise. Now, sir, what becomes of our plighted faith, if\r\nthe act of the 6th of March, 1820, was a solemn compact, as we are now\r\ntold? They have all rung the changes upon it, that it was a sacred and\r\nirrevocable compact, binding in honor, in conscience, and morals, which\r\ncould not be violated or repudiated without perfidy and dishonor! * * *\r\nSir, if this was a compact, what must be thought of those who violated\r\nit almost immediately after it was formed? I say it is a calumny upon\r\nthe North to say that it was a compact. I should feel a flush of\r\nshame upon my cheek, as a Northern man, if I were to say that it was a\r\ncompact, and that the section of the country to which I belong received\r\nthe consideration, and then repudiated the obligation in eleven months\r\nafter it was entered into. I deny that it was a compact, in any sense\r\nof the term. But if it was, the record proves that faith was not\r\nobserved--that the contract was never carried into effect--that after\r\nthe North had procured the passage of the act prohibiting slavery in the\r\nTerritories, with a majority in the House large enough to prevent its\r\nrepeal, Missouri was refused admission into the Union as a slave-holding\r\nState, in conformity with the act of March 6, 1820. If the proposition\r\nbe correct, as contended for by the opponents of this bill--that\r\nthere was a solemn compact between the North and the South that, in\r\nconsideration of the prohibition of slavery in the Territories, Missouri\r\nwas to be admitted into the Union, in conformity with the act of\r\n1820--that compact was repudiated by the North, and rescinded by the\r\njoint action of the two parties within twelve months from its date.\r\nMissouri was never admitted under the act of the 6th of March, 1820. She\r\nwas refused admission under that act. She was voted out of the Union\r\nby Northern votes, notwithstanding the stipulation that she should\r\nbe received; and, in consequence of these facts, a new compromise was\r\nrendered necessary, by the terms of which Missouri was to be admitted\r\ninto the Union conditionally--admitted on a condition not embraced in\r\nthe act of 1820, and, in addition, to a full compliance with all the\r\nprovisions of said act. If, then, the act of 1820, by the eighth section\r\nof which slavery was prohibited in Missouri, was a compact, it is clear\r\nto the comprehension of every fair-minded man that the refusal of\r\nthe North to admit Missouri, in compliance with its stipulations, and\r\nwithout further conditions, imposes upon us a high, moral obligation to\r\nremove the prohibition of slavery in the Territories, since it has been\r\nshown to have been procured upon a condition never performed. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I did not wish to refer to these things. I did not\r\nunderstand them fully in all their bearings at the time I made my first\r\nspeech on this subject; and, so far as I was familiar with them, I made\r\nas little reference to them as was consistent with my duty; because it\r\nwas a mortifying reflection to me, as a Northern man, that we had not\r\nbeen able, in consequence of the abolition excitement at the time, to\r\navoid the appearance of bad faith in the observance of legislation,\r\nwhich has been denominated a compromise. There were a few men then, as\r\nthere are now, who had the moral courage to perform their duty to the\r\ncountry and the Constitution, regardless of consequences personal to\r\nthemselves. There were ten Northern men who dared to perform their duty\r\nby voting to admit Missouri into the Union on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States, and with no other restriction than that imposed by the\r\nConstitution. I am aware that they were abused and denounced as we are\r\nnow--that they were branded as dough-faces--traitors to freedom, and to\r\nthe section of country whence they came. * * *\r\n\r\nI think I have shown that if the act of 1820, called the Missouri\r\ncompromise, was a compact, it was violated and repudiated by a solemn\r\nvote of the House of Representatives in 1821, within eleven months after\r\nit was adopted. It was repudiated by the North by a majority vote, and\r\nthat repudiation was so complete and successful as to compel Missouri to\r\nmake a new compromise, and she was brought into the Union under the new\r\ncompromise of 1821, and not under the act of 1820. This reminds me of\r\nanother point made in nearly all the speeches against this bill, and, if\r\nI recollect right, was alluded to in the abolition manifesto; to which,\r\nI regret to say, I had occasion to refer so often. I refer to the\r\nsignificant hint that Mr. Clay was dead before any one dared to bring\r\nforward a proposition to undo the greatest work of his hands. The\r\nSenator from New York (Mr. Seward) has seized upon this insinuation and\r\nelaborated, perhaps, more fully than his compeers; and now the Abolition\r\npress, suddenly, and, as if by miraculous conversion, teems with\r\neulogies upon Mr. Clay and his Missouri compromise of 1820.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, does not each of these Senators know that Mr.\r\nClay was not the author of the act of 1820? Do they not know that he\r\ndisclaimed it in 1850 in this body? Do they not know that the Missouri\r\nrestriction did not originate in the House, of which he was a member? Do\r\nthey not know that Mr. Clay never came into the Missouri controversy as\r\na compromiser until after the compromise of 1820 was repudiated, and it\r\nbecame necessary to make another? I dislike to be compelled to repeat\r\nwhat I have conclusively proven, that the compromise which Mr. Clay\r\neffected was the act of 1821, under which Missouri came into the Union,\r\nand not the act of 1820. Mr. Clay made that compromise after you had\r\nrepudiated the first one. How, then, dare you call upon the spirit of\r\nthat great and gallant statesman to sanction your charge of bad faith\r\nagainst the South on this question? * * *\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, as I have been doing justice to Mr. Clay on this\r\nquestion, perhaps I may as well do justice to another great man, who\r\nwas associated with him in carrying through the great measures of 1850,\r\nwhich mortified the Senator from New York so much, because they defeated\r\nhis purpose of carrying on the agitation. I allude to Mr. Webster. The\r\nauthority of his great name has been quoted for the purpose of proving\r\nthat he regarded the Missouri act as a compact, an irrepealable compact.\r\nEvidently the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Everett)\r\nsupposed he was doing Mr. Webster entire justice when he quoted the\r\npassage which he read from Mr. Webster's speech of the 7th of March,\r\n1850, when he said that he stood upon the position that every part\r\nof the American continent was fixed for freedom or for slavery by\r\nirrepealable law. The Senator says that by the expression \"irrepealable\r\nlaw,\" Mr. Webster meant to include the compromise of 1820. Now, I will\r\nshow that that was not Mr. Webster's meaning--that he was never\r\nguilty of the mistake of saying that the Missouri act of 1820 was an\r\nirrepealable law. Mr. Webster said in that speech that every foot of\r\nterritory in the United States was fixed as to its character for freedom\r\nor slavery by an irrepealable law. He then inquired if it was not so\r\nin regard to Texas? He went on to prove that it was; because, he said,\r\nthere was a compact in express terms between Texas and the United\r\nStates. He said the parties were capable of contracting and that there\r\nwas a valuable consideration; and hence, he contended, that in that case\r\nthere was a contract binding in honor and morals and law; and that it\r\nwas irrepealable without a breach of faith.\r\n\r\nHe went on to say:\r\n\r\n\"Now, as to California and New Mexico, I hold slavery to be excluded\r\nfrom these Territories by a law even superior to that which admits\r\nand sanctions it in Texas--I mean the law of nature--of physical\r\ngeography--the law of the formation of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the irrepealable law which he said prohibited slavery in\r\nthe Territories of Utah and New Mexico. He went on to speak of the\r\nprohibition of slavery in Oregon, and he said it was an \"entirely\r\nuseless and, in that connection, senseless proviso.\"\r\n\r\nHe went further, and said:\r\n\r\n\"That the whole territory of the States of the United States, or in the\r\nnewly-acquired territory of the United States, has a fixed and settled\r\ncharacter, now fixed and settled by law, which cannot be repealed in\r\nthe case of Texas without a violation of public faith, and cannot be\r\nrepealed by any human power in regard to California or New Mexico; that,\r\nunder one or other of these laws, every foot of territory in the States\r\nor in the Territories has now received a fixed and decided character.\"\r\n\r\nWhat irrepealable laws? One or the other of those which he had stated.\r\nOne was the Texas compact; the other, the law of nature and physical\r\ngeography; and he contended that one or the other fixed the character\r\nof the whole American continent for freedom or for slavery. He never\r\nalluded to the Missouri compromise, unless it was by the allusion to\r\nthe Wilmot proviso in the Oregon bill, and therein said it was a useless\r\nand, in that connection, senseless thing. Why was it a useless and\r\nsenseless thing? Because it was reenacting the law of God; because\r\nslavery had already been prohibited by physical geography. Sir, that was\r\nthe meaning of Mr. Webster's speech. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have occupied a good deal of time in exposing the cant\r\nof these gentlemen about the sanctity of the Missouri compromise, and\r\nthe dishonor attached to the violation of plighted faith. I have exposed\r\nthese matters in order to show that the object of these men is to\r\nwithdraw from public attention the real principle involved in the bill.\r\nThey well know that the abrogation of the Missouri compromise is the\r\nincident and not the principle of the bill. They well understand that\r\nthe report of the committee and the bill propose to establish the\r\nprinciple in all Territorial organizations, that the question of slavery\r\nshall be referred to the people to regulate for themselves, and that\r\nsuch legislation should be had as was necessary to remove all legal\r\nobstructions to the free exercise of this right by the people. The\r\neighth section of the Missouri act standing in the way of this great\r\nprinciple must be rendered inoperative and void, whether expressly\r\nrepealed or not, in order to give the people the power of regulating\r\ntheir own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, if these gentlemen have entire confidence in the correctness\r\nof their own position, why do they not meet the issue boldly and\r\nfairly, and controvert the soundness of this great principle of popular\r\nsovereignty in obedience to the Constitution? They know full well that\r\nthis was the principle upon which the colonies separated from the crown\r\nof Great Britain, the principle upon which the battles of the Revolution\r\nwere fought, and the principle upon which our republican system was\r\nfounded. They cannot be ignorant of the fact that the Revolution grew\r\nout of the assertion of the right on the part of the imperial Government\r\nto interfere with the internal affairs and domestic concerns of the\r\ncolonies. * * *\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence had its origin in the violation of that\r\ngreat fundamental principle which secured to the colonies the right to\r\nregulate their own domestic affairs in their own way; and the Revolution\r\nresulted in the triumph of that principle, and the recognition of the\r\nright asserted by it. Abolitionism proposes to destroy the right and\r\nextinguish the principle for which our forefathers waged a seven years'\r\nbloody war, and upon which our whole system of free government is\r\nfounded. They not only deny the application of this principle to the\r\nTerritories, but insist upon fastening the prohibition upon all the\r\nStates to be formed out of those Territories. Therefore, the doctrine\r\nof the Abolitionists--the doctrine of the opponents of the Nebraska\r\nand Kansas bill, and the advocates of the Missouri restriction--demands\r\nCongressional interference with slavery not only in the Territories, but\r\nin all the new States to be formed therefrom. It is the same doctrine,\r\nwhen applied to the Territories and new States of this Union, which the\r\nBritish Government attempted to enforce by the sword upon the American\r\ncolonies. It is this fundamental principle of self-government which\r\nconstitutes the distinguishing feature of the Nebraska bill. The\r\nopponents of the principle are consistent in opposing the bill. I do\r\nnot blame them for their opposition. I only ask them to meet the\r\nissue fairly and openly, by acknowledging that they are opposed to the\r\nprinciple which it is the object of the bill to carry into operation.\r\nIt seems that there is no power on earth, no intellectual power, no\r\nmechanical power, that can bring them to a fair discussion of the true\r\nissue. If they hope to delude the people and escape detection for any\r\nconsiderable length of time under the catch-words \"Missouri compromise\"\r\nand \"faith of compacts,\" they will find that the people of this country\r\nhave more penetration and intelligence than they have given them credit\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nMr. President, there is an important fact connected with this slavery\r\nregulation, which should never be lost sight of. It has always arisen\r\nfrom one and the same cause. Whenever that cause has been removed,\r\nthe agitation has ceased; and whenever the cause has been renewed, the\r\nagitation has sprung into existence. That cause is, and ever has been,\r\nthe attempt on the part of Congress to interfere with the question of\r\nslavery in the Territories and new States formed therefrom. Is it not\r\nwise then to confine our action within the sphere of our legitimate\r\nduties, and leave this vexed question to take care of itself in each\r\nState and Territory, according to the wishes of the people thereof, in\r\nconformity to the forms, and in subjection to the provisions, of the\r\nConstitution?\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the bill tell us that agitation is no part of their\r\npolicy; that their great desire is peace and harmony; and they complain\r\nbitterly that I should have disturbed the repose of the country by the\r\nintroduction of this measure! Let me ask these professed friends of\r\npeace, and avowed enemies of agitation, how the issue could have been\r\navoided. They tell me that I should have let the question alone;\r\nthat is, that I should have left Nebraska unorganized, the people\r\nunprotected, and the Indian barrier in existence, until the swelling\r\ntide of emigration should burst through, and accomplish by violence what\r\nit is the part of wisdom and statesmanship to direct and regulate by\r\nlaw. How long could you have postponed action with safety? How long\r\ncould you maintain that Indian barrier, and restrain the onward march of\r\ncivilization, Christianity, and free government by a barbarian wall? Do\r\nyou suppose that you could keep that vast country a howling wilderness\r\nin all time to come, roamed over by hostile savages, cutting off all\r\nsafe communication between our Atlantic and Pacific possessions? I tell\r\nyou that the time for action has come, and cannot be postponed. It is\r\na case in which the \"let-alone\" policy would precipitate a crisis which\r\nmust inevitably result in violence, anarchy, and strife.\r\n\r\nYou cannot fix bounds to the onward march of this great and growing\r\ncountry. You cannot fetter the limbs of the young giant. He will burst\r\nall your chains. He will expand, and grow, and increase, and extend\r\ncivilization, Christianity, and liberal principles. Then, sir, if you\r\ncannot check the growth of the country in that direction, is it not the\r\npart of wisdom to look the danger in the face, and provide for an event\r\nwhich you cannot avoid? I tell you, sir, you must provide for lines of\r\ncontinuous settlement from the Mississippi valley to the Pacific ocean.\r\nAnd in making this provision, you must decide upon what principles the\r\nTerritories shall be organized; in other words, whether the people shall\r\nbe allowed to regulate their domestic institutions in their own way,\r\naccording to the provisions of this bill, or whether the opposite\r\ndoctrine of Congressional interference is to prevail. Postpone it,\r\nif you will; but whenever you do act, this question must be met and\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri compromise was interference; the compromise of 1850 was\r\nnon-interference, leaving the people to exercise their rights under the\r\nConstitution. The Committee on Territories were compelled to act on this\r\nsubject. I, as their chairman, was bound to meet the question. I chose\r\nto take the responsibility regardless of consequences personal to\r\nmyself. I should have done the same thing last year, if there had been\r\ntime; but we know, considering the late period at which the bill\r\nthen reached us from the House, that there was not sufficient time to\r\nconsider the question fully, and to prepare a report upon the subject.\r\n\r\nI was, therefore, persuaded by my friends to allow the bill to be\r\nreported to the Senate, in order that such action might be taken as\r\nshould be deemed wise and proper. The bill was never taken up for\r\naction--the last night of the session having been exhausted in debate on\r\na motion to take up the bill. This session, the measure was introduced\r\nby my friend from Iowa (Mr. Dodge), and referred to the Territorial\r\nCommittee during the first week of the session. We have abundance of\r\ntime to consider the subject; it is a matter of pressing necessity,\r\nand there was no excuse for not meeting it directly and fairly. We were\r\ncompelled to take our position upon the doctrine either of intervention\r\nor non-intervention. We chose the latter for two reasons: first, because\r\nwe believed that the principle was right; and, second, because it was\r\nthe principle adopted in 1850, to which the two great political parties\r\nof the country were solemnly pledged.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why I desire to see this principle recognized as\r\na rule of action in all time to come. It will have the effect to destroy\r\nall sectional parties and sectional agitations. If, in the language of\r\nthe report of the committee, you withdraw the slavery question from\r\nthe halls of Congress and the political arena, and commit it to the\r\narbitrament of those who are immediately interested in and alone\r\nresponsible for its consequences, there is nothing left out of which\r\nsectional parties can be organized. It never was done, and never can\r\nbe done on the bank, tariff, distribution, or any party issue which has\r\nexisted, or may exist, after this slavery question is withdrawn from\r\npolitics. On every other political question these have always supporters\r\nand opponents in every portion of the Union--in each State, county,\r\nvillage, and neighborhood--residing together in harmony and good\r\nfellowship, and combating each other's opinions and correcting each\r\nother's errors in a spirit of kindness and friendship. These differences\r\nof opinion between neighbors and friends, and the discussions that grow\r\nout of them, and the sympathy which each feels with the advocates of\r\nhis own opinions in every portion of this widespread Republic, add\r\nan overwhelming and irresistible moral weight to the strength of\r\nthe Confederacy. Affection for the Union can never be alienated or\r\ndiminished by any other party issues than those which are joined upon\r\nsectional or geographical lines. When the people of the North shall\r\nall be rallied under one banner, and the whole South marshalled under\r\nanother banner, and each section excited to frenzy and madness by\r\nhostility to the institutions of the other, then the patriot may well\r\ntremble for the perpetuity of the Union. Withdraw the slavery question\r\nfrom the political arena, and remove it to the States and Territories,\r\neach to decide for itself, such a catastrophe can never happen. Then\r\nyou will never be able to tell, by any Senator's vote for or against any\r\nmeasure, from what State or section of the Union he comes.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, can we not withdraw this vexed question from politics? Why\r\ncan we not adopt the principle of this bill as a rule of action in all\r\nnew Territorial organizations? Why can we not deprive these agitators of\r\ntheir vocation and render it impossible for Senators to come here upon\r\nbargains on the slavery question? I believe that the peace, the harmony,\r\nand perpetuity of the Union require us to go back to the doctrines of\r\nthe Revolution, to the principles of the Constitution, to the principles\r\nof the Compromise of 1850, and leave the people, under the Constitution,\r\nto do as they may see proper in respect to their own internal affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have not brought this question forward as a Northern\r\nman or as a Southern man. I am unwilling to recognize such divisions\r\nand distinctions. I have brought it forward as an American Senator,\r\nrepresenting a State which is true to this principle, and which has\r\napproved of my action in respect to the Nebraska bill. I have brought it\r\nforward not as an act of justice to the South more than to the North. I\r\nhave presented it especially as an act of justice to the people of those\r\nTerritories and of the States to be formed therefrom, now and in all\r\ntime to come. I have nothing to say about Northern rights or Southern\r\nrights. I know of no such divisions or distinctions under the\r\nConstitution. The bill does equal and exact justice to the whole Union,\r\nand every part of it; it violates the right of no State or Territory;\r\nbut places each on a perfect equality, and leaves the people thereof to\r\nthe free enjoyment of all their rights under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I wish to say to our Southern friends that if they desire to\r\nsee this great principle carried out, now is their time to rally around\r\nit, to cherish it, preserve it, make it the rule of action in all future\r\ntime. If they fail to do it now, and thereby allow the doctrine of\r\ninterference to prevail, upon their heads the consequences of that\r\ninterference must rest. To our Northern friends, on the other hand,\r\nI desire to say, that from this day henceforward they must rebuke the\r\nslander which has been uttered against the South, that they desire to\r\nlegislate slavery into the Territories. The South has vindicated her\r\nsincerity, her honor, on that point by bringing forward a provision\r\nnegativing, in express terms, any such effect as a result of this bill.\r\nI am rejoiced to know that while the proposition to abrogate the eighth\r\nsection of the Missouri act comes from a free State, the proposition to\r\nnegative the conclusion that slavery is thereby introduced, comes from\r\na slave-holding State. Thus, both sides furnish conclusive evidence that\r\nthey go for the principle, and the principle only, and desire to take no\r\nadvantage of any possible misconstruction.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I feel that I owe an apology to the Senate for having\r\noccupied their attention so long, and a still greater apology for having\r\ndiscussed the question in such an incoherent and desultory manner. But\r\nI could not forbear to claim the right of closing this debate. I thought\r\ngentlemen would recognize its propriety when they saw the manner\r\nin which I was assailed and misrepresented in the course of this\r\ndiscussion, and especially by assaults still more disreputable in some\r\nportions of the country. These assaults have had no other effect upon me\r\nthan to give me courage and energy for a still more resolute discharge\r\nof duty. I say frankly that, in my opinion, this measure will be as\r\npopular at the North as at the South, when its provisions and principles\r\nshall have been fully developed, and become well understood. The people\r\nat the North are attached to the principles of self-government, and\r\nyou cannot convince them that that is self-government which deprives a\r\npeople of the right of legislating for themselves, and compels them to\r\nreceive laws which are forced upon them by a Legislature in which they\r\nare not represented. We are willing to stand upon this great principle\r\nof self-government every-where; and it is to us a proud reflection that,\r\nin this whole discussion, no friend of the bill has urged an argument\r\nin its favor which could not be used with the same propriety in a free\r\nState as in a slave State, and vice versed. No enemy of the bill has\r\nused an argument which would bear repetition one mile across Mason and\r\nDixon's line. Our opponents have dealt entirely in sectional appeals.\r\nThe friends of the bill have discussed a great principle of universal\r\napplication, which can be sustained by the same reasons, and the same\r\narguments, in every time and in every corner of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS.' (BORN 1811, DIED 1874.)\r\n\r\nON THE CRIME AGAINST KANSAS;\r\n\r\nSENATE, MAY 19-20, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nYou are now called to redress a great transgression. Seldom in the\r\nhistory of nations has such a question been presented. Tariffs, Army\r\nbills, Navy bills, Land bills, are important, and justly occupy your\r\ncare; but these all belong to the course of ordinary legislation. As\r\nmeans and instruments only, they are necessarily subordinate to the\r\nconservation of government itself. Grant them or deny them, in greater\r\nor less degree, and you will inflict no shock. The machinery of\r\ngovernment will continue to move. The State will not cease to exist. Far\r\notherwise is it with the eminent question now before you, involving, as\r\nit does, Liberty in a broad territory, and also involving the peace of\r\nthe whole country, with our good name in history forever more.\r\n\r\nTake down your map, sir, and you will find that the Territory of Kansas,\r\nmore than any other region, occupies the middle spot of North America,\r\nequally distant from the Atlantic on the east, and the Pacific on the\r\nwest; from the frozen waters of Hudson's Bay on the north, and the tepid\r\nGulf Stream on the south, constituting the precise territorial centre of\r\nthe whole vast continent. To such advantages of situation, on the very\r\nhighway between two oceans, are added a soil of unsurpassed richness,\r\nand a fascinating, undulating beauty of surface, with a health-giving\r\nclimate, calculated to nurture a powerful and generous people, worthy\r\nto be a central pivot of American institutions. A few short months only\r\nhave passed since this spacious and mediterranean country was open only\r\nto the savage who ran wild in its woods and prairies; and now it has\r\nalready drawn to its bosom a population of freemen larger than Athens\r\ncrowded within her historic gates, when her sons, under Miltiades,\r\nwon liberty for man-kind on the field of Marathon; more than Sparta\r\ncontained when she ruled Greece, and sent forth her devoted children,\r\nquickened by a mother's benediction, to return with their shields, or on\r\nthem; more than Rome gathered on her seven hills, when, under her kings,\r\nshe commenced that sovereign sway, which afterward embraced the\r\nwhole earth; more than London held, when, on the fields of Crecy\r\nand Agincourt, the English banner was carried victoriously over the\r\nchivalrous hosts of France.\r\n\r\nAgainst this Territory, thus fortunate in position and population, a\r\ncrime has been committed, which is without example in the records of\r\nthe past. Not in plundered provinces or in the cruelties of selfish\r\ngovernors will you find its parallel; and yet there is an ancient\r\ninstance, which may show at least the path of justice. In the terrible\r\nimpeachment by which the great Roman orator has blasted through all\r\ntime the name of Verres, amidst charges of robbery and sacrilege, the\r\nenormity which most aroused the indignant voice of his accuser, and\r\nwhich still stands forth with strongest distinctness, arresting the\r\nsympathetic indignation of all who read the story, is, that away in\r\nSicily he had scourged a citizen of Rome--that the cry, \"I am a Roman\r\ncitizen,\" had been interposed in vain against the lash of the tyrant\r\ngovernor. Other charges were, that he had carried away productions of\r\nart, and that he had violated the sacred shrines. It was in the presence\r\nof the Roman Senate that this arraignment proceeded; in a temple of\r\nthe Forum; amidst crowds--such as no orator had ever before drawn\r\ntogether--thronging the porticos and colonnades, even clinging to\r\nthe house-tops and neighboring slopes--and under the anxious gaze of\r\nwitnesses summoned from the scene of crime. But an audience grander\r\nfar--of higher dignity--of more various people, and of wider\r\nintelligence--the countless multitude of succeeding generations, in\r\nevery land, where eloquence has been studied, or where the Roman name\r\nhas been recognized,--has listened to the accusation, and throbbed with\r\ncondemnation of the criminal. Sir, speaking in an age of light, and a\r\nland of constitutional liberty, where the safeguards of elections are\r\njustly placed among the highest triumphs of civilization, I fearlessly\r\nassert that the wrongs of much-abused Sicily, thus memorable in history,\r\nwere small by the side of the wrongs of Kansas, where the very shrines\r\nof popular institutions, more sacred than any heathen altar, have been\r\ndesecrated; where the ballot-box, more precious than any work, in ivory\r\nor marble, from the cunning hand of art, has been plundered; and where\r\nthe cry, \"I am an American citizen,\" has been interposed in vain against\r\noutrage of every kind, even upon life itself. Are you against sacrilege?\r\nI present it for your execration. Are you against;robbery? I hold it up\r\nto your scorn. Are you for the protection of American citizens? I show\r\nyou how their dearest rights have been cloven down, while a Tyrannical\r\nUsurpation has sought to install itself on their very necks!\r\n\r\nBut the wickedness which I now begin to expose is immeasurably\r\naggravated by the motive which prompted it. Not in any common lust for\r\npower did this uncommon tragedy have its origin. It is the rape of a\r\nvirgin Territory, compelling it to the hateful embrace of Slavery; and\r\nit may be clearly traced to a depraved longing for a new slave State,\r\nthe hideous off-spring of such a crime, in the hope of adding to the\r\npower of slavery in the National Government. Yes, sir, when the whole\r\nworld, alike Christian and Turk, is rising up to condemn this wrong, and\r\nto make it a hissing to the nations, here in our Republic, force--ay,\r\nsir, FORCE--has been openly employed in compelling Kansas to this\r\npollution, and all for the sake of political power. There is the simple\r\nfact, which you will in vain attempt to deny, but which in itself\r\npresents an essential wickedness that makes other public crimes seem\r\nlike public virtues.\r\n\r\nBut this enormity, vast beyond comparison, swells to dimensions of\r\nwickedness which the imagination toils in vain to grasp, when it is\r\nunderstood that for this purpose are hazarded the horrors of intestine\r\nfeud not only in this distant Territory, but everywhere throughout the\r\ncountry. Already the muster has begun. The strife is no longer local,\r\nbut national. Even now, while I speak, portents hang on all the arches\r\nof the horizon threatening to darken the broad land, which already\r\nyawns with the mutterings of civil war. The fury of the propagandists of\r\nSlavery, and the calm determination of their opponents, are now diffused\r\nfrom the distant Territory over widespread communities, and the\r\nwhole country, in all its extent--marshalling hostile divisions, and\r\nforeshadowing a strife which, unless happily averted by the triumph\r\nof Freedom, will become war--fratricidal, parricidal war--with an\r\naccumulated wickedness beyond the wickedness of any war in human annals;\r\njustly provoking the avenging judgment of Providence and the avenging\r\npen of history, and constituting a strife, in the language of the\r\nancient writer, more than foreign, more than social, more than civil;\r\nbut something compounded of all these strifes, and in itself more than\r\nwar; _sal potius commune quoddam ex omnibus, et plus quam bellum_.\r\n\r\nSuch is the crime which you are to judge. But the criminal also must be\r\ndragged into day, that you may see and measure the power by which all\r\nthis wrong is sustained. From no common source could it proceed. In\r\nits perpetration was needed a spirit of vaulting ambition which would\r\nhesitate at nothing; a hardihood of purpose which was insensible to the\r\njudgment of mankind; a madness for Slavery which would disregard the\r\nConstitution, the laws, and all the great examples of our history;\r\nalso a consciousness of power such as comes from the habit of power;\r\na combination of energies found only in a hundred arms directed by\r\na hundred eyes; a control of public opinion through venal pens and a\r\nprostituted press; an ability to subsidize crowds in every vocation\r\nof life--the politician with his local importance, the lawyer with his\r\nsubtle tongue, and even the authority of the judge on the bench; and\r\na familiar use of men in places high and low, so that none, from the\r\nPresident to the lowest border postmaster, should decline to be its\r\ntool; all these things and more were needed, and they were found in\r\nthe slave power of our Republic. There, sir, stands the criminal,\r\nall unmasked before you--heartless, grasping, and tyrannical--with an\r\naudacity beyond that of Verres, a subtlety beyond that of Machiavel, a\r\nmeanness beyond that of Bacon, and an ability beyond that of Hastings.\r\nJustice to Kansas can be secured only by the prostration of this\r\ninfluence; for this the power behind--greater than any President--which\r\nsuccors and sustains the crime. Nay, the proceedings I now arraign\r\nderive their fearful consequences only from this connection.\r\n\r\nIn now opening this great matter, I am not insensible to the austere\r\ndemands of the occasion; but the dependence of the crime against Kansas\r\nupon the slave power is so peculiar and important, that I trust to be\r\npardoned while I impress it with an illustration, which to some may\r\nseem trivial. It is related in Northern mythology that the god of Force,\r\nvisiting an enchanted region, was challenged by his royal entertainer to\r\nwhat seemed an humble feat of strength--merely, sir, to lift a cat from\r\nthe ground. The god smiled at the challenge, and, calmly placing his\r\nhand under the belly of the animal, with superhuman strength strove,\r\nwhile the back of the feline monster arched far up-ward, even beyond\r\nreach, and one paw actually forsook the earth, until at last the\r\ndiscomfited divinity desisted; but he was little surprised at his\r\ndefeat when he learned that this creature, which seemed to be a cat, and\r\nnothing more, was not merely a cat, but that it belonged to and was a\r\npart of the great Terrestrial Serpent, which, in its innumerable folds,\r\nencircled the whole globe. Even so the creature, whose paws are now\r\nfastened upon Kansas, whatever it may seem to be, constitutes in reality\r\na part of the slave power, which, in its loathsome folds, is now\r\ncoiled about the whole land. Thus do I expose the extent of the present\r\ncontest, where we encounter not merely local resistance, but also the\r\nunconquered sustaining arm behind. But out of the vastness of the crime\r\nattempted, with all its woe and shame, I derive a well-founded assurance\r\nof a commensurate vastness of effort against it by the aroused masses of\r\nthe country, determined not only to vindicate Right against Wrong,\r\nbut to redeem the Republic from the thraldom of that Oligarchy which\r\nprompts, directs, and concentrates the distant wrong.\r\n\r\nSuch is the crime, and such the criminal, which it is my duty in this\r\ndebate to expose, and, by the blessing of God, this duty shall be done\r\ncompletely to the end. * * *'\r\n\r\nBut, before entering upon the argument, I must say something of a\r\ngeneral character, particularly in response to what has fallen from\r\nSenators who have raised themselves to eminence on this floor in\r\nchampionship of human wrongs. I mean the Senator from South Carolina\r\n(Mr. Butler), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Douglas), who, though\r\nunlike as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, yet, like this couple, sally\r\nforth together in the same adventure. I regret much to miss the elder\r\nSenator from his seat; but the cause, against which he has run a\r\ntilt, with such activity of animosity, demands that the opportunity of\r\nexposing him should not be lost; and it is for the cause that I speak.\r\nThe Senator from South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and\r\nbelieves himself a chivalrous knight, with sentiments of honor and\r\ncourage. Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his\r\nvows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though\r\npolluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight--I mean the\r\nharlot, Slavery. For her, his tongue is always profuse in words. Let her\r\nbe impeached in character, or any proposition made to shut her out\r\nfrom the extension of her wantonness, and no extravagance of manner or\r\nhardihood of assertion is then too great for this Senator. The frenzy\r\nof Don Quixote, in behalf of his wench, Dulcinea del Toboso, is all\r\nsurpassed. The asserted rights of Slavery, which shock equality of all\r\nkinds, are cloaked by a fantastic claim of equality. If the slave States\r\ncannot enjoy what, in mockery of the great fathers of the Republic, he\r\nmisnames equality under the Constitution--in other words, the full power\r\nin the National Territories to compel fellow-men to unpaid toil, to\r\nseparate husband and wife, and to sell little children at the auction\r\nblock--then, sir, the chivalric Senator will conduct the State of South\r\nCarolina out of the Union! Heroic knight! Exalted Senator! A second\r\nMoses come for a second exodus!!\r\n\r\nBut not content with this poor menace, which we have been twice told was\r\n\"measured,\" the Senator in the unrestrained chivalry of his nature, has\r\nundertaken to apply opprobrious words to those who differ from him on\r\nthis floor. He calls them \"sectional and fanatical;\" and opposition to\r\nthe usurpation in Kansas he denounces as \"an uncalculating fanaticism.\"\r\nTo be sure these charges lack all grace of originality, and all\r\nsentiment of truth; but the adventurous Senator does not hesitate. He\r\nis the uncompromising, unblushing representative on this floor of a\r\nflagrant sectionalism, which now domineers over the Republic, and yet\r\nwith a ludicrous ignorance of his own position--unable to see himself\r\nas others see him--or with an effrontery which even his white head ought\r\nnot to protect from rebuke, he applies to those here who resist his\r\nsectionalism the very epithet which designates himself. The men who\r\nstrive to bring back the Government to its original policy, when Freedom\r\nand not Slavery was sectional, he arraigns as sectional. This will not\r\ndo. It involves too great a perversion of terms. I tell that Senator\r\nthat it is to himself, and to the \"organization\" of which he is the\r\n\"committed advocate,\" that this epithet belongs. I now fasten it upon\r\nthem. For myself, I care little for names; but since the question has\r\nbeen raised here, I affirm that the Republican party of the Union is in\r\nno just sense sectional, but, more than any other party, national;\r\nand that it now goes forth to dislodge from the high places of the\r\nGovernment the tyrannical sectionalism of which the Senator from South\r\nCarolina is one of the maddest zealots. * * *\r\n\r\nAs the Senator from South Carolina, is the Don Quixote, the Senator from\r\nIllinois (Mr. Douglas) is the Squire of Slavery, its very Sancho Panza,\r\nready to do all its humiliating offices. This Senator, in his labored\r\naddress, vindicating his labored report--piling one mass of elaborate\r\nerror upon another mass--constrained himself, as you will remember, to\r\nunfamiliar decencies of speech. Of that address I have nothing to say\r\nat this moment, though before I sit down I shall show something of its\r\nfallacies. But I go back now to an earlier occasion, when, true to his\r\nnative impulses, he threw into this discussion, \"for a charm of powerful\r\ntrouble,\" personalities most discreditable to this body. I will not stop\r\nto repel the imputations which he cast upon myself; but I mention them\r\nto remind you of the \"sweltered venom sleeping got,\" which, with other\r\npoisoned ingredients, he cast into the caldron of this debate. Of other\r\nthings I speak. Standing on this floor, the Senator issued his rescript,\r\nrequiring submission to the Usurped Power of Kansas; and this was\r\naccompanied by a manner--all his own--such as befits the tyrannical\r\nthreat. Very well. Let the Senator try. I tell him now that he cannot\r\nenforce any such submission. The Senator, with the slave power at his\r\nback, is strong; but he is not strong enough for this purpose. He is\r\nbold. He shrinks from nothing. Like Danton, he may cry, \"l'audace!\r\nl'audace! toujours l'au-dace!\" but even his audacity cannot compass this\r\nwork. The Senator copies the British officer who, with boastful swagger,\r\nsaid that with the hilt of his sword he would cram the \"stamps\" down the\r\nthroats of the American people, and he will meet a similar failure. He\r\nmay convulse this country with a civil feud. Like the ancient madman, he\r\nmay set fire to this Temple of Constitutional Liberty, grander than\r\nthe Ephesian dome; but he cannot enforce obedience to that Tyrannical\r\nUsurpation.\r\n\r\nThe Senator dreams that he can subdue the North. He disclaims the open\r\nthreat, but his conduct still implies it. How little that Senator knows\r\nhimself or the strength of the cause which he persecutes! He is but a\r\nmortal man; against him is an immortal principle. With finite power he\r\nwrestles with the infinite, and he must fall. Against him are stronger\r\nbattalions than any marshalled by mortal arm--the inborn, ineradicable,\r\ninvincible sentiments of the human heart; against him is nature in all\r\nher subtle forces; against him is God. Let him try to subdue these. * * *\r\n\r\nWith regret, I come again upon the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.\r\nButler), who, omnipresent in this debate, overflowed with rage at the\r\nsimple suggestion that Kansas had applied for admission as a State;\r\nand, with incoherent phrases, discharged the loose expectoration of his\r\nspeech, now upon her representative, and then upon her people. There was\r\nno extravagance of the ancient parliamentary debate, which he did not\r\nrepeat; nor was there any possible deviation from truth which he did not\r\nmake, with so much of passion, I am glad to add, as to save him from\r\nthe suspicion of intentional aberration. But the Senator touches\r\nnothing which he does not disfigure--with error, sometimes of principle,\r\nsometimes of fact. He shows an incapacity of accuracy, whether in\r\nstating the Constitution, or in stating the law, whether in the details\r\nof statistics or the diversions of scholarship. He cannot ope his mouth,\r\nbut out there flies a blunder. Surely he ought to be familiar with the\r\nlife of Franklin; and yet he referred to this household character, while\r\nacting as agent of our fathers in England, as above suspicion; and this\r\nwas done that he might give point to a false contrast with the agent of\r\nKansas--not knowing that, however they may differ in genius and fame, in\r\nthis experience they are alike: that Franklin, when entrusted with the\r\npetition of Massachusetts Bay, was assaulted by a foul-mouthed speaker,\r\nwhere he could not be heard in defence, and denounced as a \"thief,\" even\r\nas the agent of Kansas has been assaulted on this floor, and denounced\r\nas a \"forger.\" And let not the vanity of the Senator be inspired by\r\nthe parallel with the British statesman of that day; for it is only in\r\nhostility to Freedom that any parallel can be recognized.\r\n\r\nBut it is against the people of Kansas that the sensibilities of the\r\nSenator are particularly aroused. Coming, as he announces, \"from a\r\nState\"--ay, sir, from South Carolina--he turns with lordly disgust from\r\nthis newly-formed community, which he will not recognize even as a \"body\r\npolitic.\" Pray, sir, by what title does he indulge in this egotism? Has\r\nhe read the history of \"the State\" which he represents? He cannot\r\nsurely have forgotten its shameful imbecility from Slavery, confessed\r\nthroughout the Revolution, followed by its more shameful assumptions for\r\nSlavery since. He cannot have forgotten its wretched persistence in\r\nthe slave-trade as the very apple of its eye, and the condition of its\r\nparticipation in the Union. He cannot have forgotten its constitution,\r\nwhich is Republican only in name, confirming power in the hands of the\r\nfew, and founding the qualifications of its legislators on \"a settled\r\nfreehold estate and ten negroes.\" And yet the Senator, to whom that\r\n\"State\" has in part committed the guardianship of its good name, instead\r\nof moving, with backward treading steps, to cover its nakedness, rushes\r\nforward in the very ecstasy of madness, to expose it by provoking a\r\ncomparison with Kansas. South Carolina is old; Kansas is young. South\r\nCarolina counts by centuries; where Kansas counts by years. But a\r\nbeneficent example may be born in a day; and I venture to say, that\r\nagainst the two centuries of the older \"State,\" may be already set\r\nthe two years of trial, evolving corresponding virtue, in the younger\r\ncommunity. In the one, is the long wail of Slavery; in the other, the\r\nhymns of Freedom. And if we glance at special achievements, it will\r\nbe difficult to find any thing in the history of South Carolina which\r\npresents so much of heroic spirit in an heroic cause as appears in that\r\nrepulse of the Missouri invaders by the beleaguered town of Lawrence,\r\nwhere even the women gave their effective efforts to Freedom. The\r\nmatrons of Rome, who poured their jewels into the treasury for the\r\npublic defence--the wives of Prussia, who, with delicate fingers,\r\nclothed their defenders against French invasion--the mothers of our\r\nown Revolution, who sent forth their sons, covered with prayers and\r\nblessings, to combat for human rights, did nothing of self-sacrifice\r\ntruer than did these women on this occasion. Were the whole history of\r\nSouth Carolina blotted out of existence, from its very beginning down to\r\nthe day of the last election of the Senator to his present seat on this\r\nfloor, civilization might lose--I do not say how little; but surely\r\nless than it has already gained by the example of Kansas, in its valiant\r\nstruggle against oppression, and in the development of a new science\r\nof emigration. Already, in Lawrence alone, there are newspapers and\r\nschools, including a High School, and throughout this infant Territory\r\nthere is more mature scholarship far, in proportion to its inhabitants,\r\nthan in all South Carolina. Ah, sir, I tell the Senator that Kansas,\r\nwelcomed as a free State, will be a \"ministering angel\" to the Republic,\r\nwhen South Carolina, in the cloak of darkness which she hugs, \"lies\r\nhowling.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Illinois (Mr. Douglas) naturally joins the Senator from\r\nSouth Carolina in this warfare, and gives to it the superior intensity\r\nof his nature. He thinks that the National Government has not completely\r\nproved its power, as it has never hanged a traitor; but, if the occasion\r\nrequires, he hopes there will be no hesitation; and this threat is\r\ndirected at Kansas, and even at the friends of Kansas throughout the\r\ncountry. Again occurs the parallel with the struggle of our fathers,\r\nand I borrow the language of Patrick Henry, when, to the cry from the\r\nSenator, of \"treason,\" \"treason,\" I reply, \"if this be treason, make\r\nthe most of it.\" Sir, it is easy to call names; but I beg to tell the\r\nSenator that if the word \"traitor\" is in any way applicable to those\r\nwho refuse submission to a Tyrannical Usurpation, whether in Kansas or\r\nelsewhere, then must some new word, of deeper color, be invented, to\r\ndesignate those mad spirits who could endanger and degrade the Republic,\r\nwhile they betray all the cherished sentiments of the fathers and the\r\nspirit of the Constitution, in order to give new spread to Slavery. Let\r\nthe Senator proceed. It will not be the first time in history, that a\r\nscaffold erected for punishment has become a pedestal of honor. Out of\r\ndeath comes life, and the \"traitor\" whom he blindly executes will live\r\nimmortal in the cause.\r\n\r\n     \"For Humanity sweeps onward; where to-day the martyr stands,\r\n     On the morrow crouches Judas, with the silver in his hands;\r\n     While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return,\r\n     To glean up the scattered ashes into History's golden urn.\"\r\n\r\nAmong these hostile Senators, there is yet another, with all the\r\nprejudices of the Senator from South Carolina, but without his generous\r\nimpulses, who, on account of his character before the country, and the\r\nrancor of his opposition, deserves to be named. I mean the Senator from\r\nVirginia (Mr. Mason), who, as the author of the Fugitive-Slave bill, has\r\nassociated himself with a special act of inhumanity and tyranny. Of him\r\nI shall say little, for he has said little in this debate, though within\r\nthat little was compressed the bitterness of a life absorbed in the\r\nsupport of Slavery. He holds the commission of Virginia; but he does not\r\nrepresent that early Virginia, so dear to our hearts, which gave to us\r\nthe pen of Jefferson, by which the equality of men was declared, and\r\nthe sword of Washington, by which Independence was secured; but he\r\nrepresents that other Virginia, from which Washington and Jefferson\r\nnow avert their faces, where human beings are bred as cattle for the\r\nshambles, and where a dungeon rewards the pious matron who teaches\r\nlittle children to relieve their bondage by reading the Book of Life.\r\nIt is proper that such a Senator, representing such a State, should rail\r\nagainst free Kansas.\r\n\r\nSenators such as these are the natural enemies of Kansas, and I\r\nintroduce them with reluctance, simply that the country may understand\r\nthe character of the hostility which must be overcome. Arrayed with\r\nthem, of course, are all who unite, under any pretext or apology, in\r\nthe propagandism of human Slavery. To such, indeed, the time-honored\r\nsafeguards of popular rights can be a name only, and nothing more. What\r\nare trial by jury, habeas corpus, the ballot-box, the right of petition,\r\nthe liberty of Kansas, your liberty, sir, or mine, to one who lends\r\nhimself, not merely to the support at home, but to the propagandism\r\nabroad, of that preposterous wrong, which denies even the right of a\r\nman to himself! Such a cause can be maintained only by a practical\r\nsubversion of all rights. It is, therefore, merely according to reason\r\nthat its partisans should uphold the Usurpation in Kansas.\r\n\r\nTo overthrow this Usurpation is now the special, importunate duty of\r\nCongress, admitting of no hesitation or postponement. To this end it\r\nmust lift itself from the cabals of candidates, the machinations of\r\nparty, and the low level of vulgar strife. It must turn from that Slave\r\nOligarchy which now controls the Republic, and refuse to be its tool.\r\nLet its power be stretched forth toward this distant Territory, not to\r\nbind, but to unbind; not for the oppression of the weak, but for the\r\nsubversion of the tyrannical; not for the prop and maintenance of a\r\nrevolting Usurpation, but for the confirmation of Liberty.\r\n\r\n     \"These are imperial arts and worthy thee!\"\r\n\r\nLet it now take its stand between the living and dead, and cause this\r\nplague to be stayed. All this it can do; and if the interests of Slavery\r\ndid not oppose, all this it would do at once, in reverent regard for\r\njustice, law, and order, driving away all the alarms of war; nor would\r\nit dare to brave the shame and punishment of this great refusal. But the\r\nslave power dares anything; and it can be conquered only by the united\r\nmasses of the people. From Congress to the People I appeal. * * *\r\n\r\nThe contest, which, beginning in Kansas, has reached us, will soon be\r\ntransferred from Congress to a broader stage, where every citizen will\r\nbe not only spectator, but actor; and to their judgment I confidently\r\nappeal. To the People, now on the eve of exercising the electoral\r\nfranchise, in choosing a Chief Magistrate of the Republic, I appeal, to\r\nvindicate the electoral franchise in Kansas. Let the ballot-box of\r\nthe Union, with multitudinous might, protect the ballot-box in that\r\nTerritory. Let the voters everywhere, while rejoicing in their own\r\nrights, help to guard the equal rights of distant fellow-citizens; that\r\nthe shrines of popular institutions, now desecrated, may be sanctified\r\nanew; that the ballot-box, now plundered, may be restored; and that the\r\ncry, \"I am an American citizen,\" may not be sent forth in vain against\r\noutrage of every kind. In just regard for free labor in that Territory,\r\nwhich it is sought to blast by unwelcome association with slave labor;\r\nin Christian sympathy with the slave, whom it is proposed to task\r\nand sell there; in stern condemnation of the crime which has been\r\nconsummated on that beautiful soil; in rescue of fellow-citizens now\r\nsubjugated to a Tyrannical Usurpation; in dutiful respect for the early\r\nfathers, whose aspirations are now ignobly thwarted; in the name of the\r\nConstitution, which has been outraged--of the laws trampled down--of\r\nJustice banished--of Humanity degraded--of Peace destroyed--of Freedom\r\ncrushed to earth; and, in the name of the Heavenly Father, whose service\r\nis perfect Freedom, I make this last appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 20, 1856.\r\n\r\nMR. DOUGLAS:--I shall not detain the Senate by a detailed reply to the\r\nspeech of the Senator from Massachusetts. Indeed, I should not deem it\r\nnecessary to say one word, but for the personalities in which he has\r\nindulged, evincing a depth of malignity that issued from every sentence,\r\nmaking it a matter of self-respect with me to repel the assaults which\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nAs to the argument, we have heard it all before. Not a position, not a\r\nfact, not an argument has he used, which has not been employed on the\r\nsame side of the chamber, and replied to by me twice. I shall not follow\r\nhim, therefore, because it would only be repeating the same answer which\r\nI have twice before given to each of his positions. He seems to get up\r\na speech as in Yankee land they get up a bedquilt. They take all the old\r\ncalico dresses of various colors, that have been in the house from\r\nthe days of their grandmothers, and invite the young ladies of the\r\nneighborhood in the afternoon, and the young men to meet them at a dance\r\nin the evening. They cut up these pieces of old dresses and make pretty\r\nfigures, and boast of what beautiful ornamental work they have made,\r\nalthough there was not a new piece of material in the whole quilt. Thus\r\nit is with the speech which we have had re-hashed here to-day, in regard\r\nto matters of fact, matters of law, and matters of argument--every thing\r\nbut the personal assaults and the malignity. * * *\r\n\r\nHis endeavor seems to be an attempt to whistle to keep up his courage\r\nby defiant assaults upon us all. I am in doubt as to what can be his\r\nobject. He has not hesitated to charge three fourths of the Senate with\r\nfraud, with swindling, with crime, with infamy, at least one hundred\r\ntimes over in his speech. Is it his object to provoke some of us to kick\r\nhim as we would a dog in the street, that he may get sympathy upon the\r\njust chastisement? What is the object of this denunciation against the\r\nbody of which we are members? A hundred times he has called the Nebraska\r\nbill a \"swindle,\" an act of crime, an act of infamy, and each time\r\nwent on to illustrate the complicity of each man who voted for it in\r\nperpetrating the crime. He has brought it home as a personal charge to\r\nthose who passed the Nebraska bill, that they were guilty of a crime\r\nwhich deserved the just indignation of heaven, and should make them\r\ninfamous among men.\r\n\r\nWho are the Senators thus arraigned? He does me the honor to make me the\r\nchief. It was my good luck to have such a position in this body as to\r\nenable me to be the author of a great, wise measure, which the Senate\r\nhas approved, and the country will endorse. That measure was sustained\r\nby about three fourths of all the members of the Senate. It was\r\nsustained by a majority of the Democrats and a majority of the Whigs\r\nin this body. It was sustained by a majority of Senators from the\r\nslave-holding States, and a majority of Senators from the free States.\r\nThe Senator, by his charge of crime, then, stultifies three fourths\r\nof the whole body, a majority of the North, nearly the whole South, a\r\nmajority of Whigs, and a majority of Democrats here. He says they are\r\ninfamous. If he so believed, who could suppose that he would ever show\r\nhis face among such a body of men? How dare he approach one of those\r\ngentlemen to give him his hand after that act? If he felt the courtesies\r\nbetween men he would not do it. He would deserve to have himself spit in\r\nthe face for doing so. * * *\r\n\r\nThe attack of the Senator from Massachusetts now is not on me alone.\r\nEven the courteous and the accomplished Senator from South Carolina (Mr.\r\nButler) could not be passed by in his absence.\r\n\r\nMR. MASON:--Advantage was taken of it.\r\n\r\nMR. DOUGLAS:--It is suggested that advantage is taken of his absence.\r\nI think that this is a mistake. I think the speech was written and\r\npractised, and the gestures fixed; and, if that part had been stricken\r\nout the Senator would not have known how to repeat the speech. All that\r\ntirade of abuse must be brought down on the head of the venerable, the\r\ncourteous, and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. I shall\r\nnot defend that gentleman here. Every Senator who knows him loves him.\r\nThe Senator from Massachusetts may take every charge made against him in\r\nhis speech, and may verify by his oath, and by the oath of every one\r\nof his confederates, and there is not an honest man in this chamber who\r\nwill not repel it as a slander. Your oaths cannot make a Senator feel\r\nthat it was not an outrage to assail that honorable gentleman in the\r\nterms in which he has been attacked. He, however, will be here in due\r\ntime to speak for himself, and to act for himself too. I know what will\r\nhappen. The Senator from Massachusetts will go to him, whisper a secret\r\napology in his ear, and ask him to accept that as satisfaction for a\r\npublic outrage on his character! I know the Senator from Massachusetts\r\nis in the habit of doing those things. I have had some experience of his\r\nskill in that respect. * * *\r\n\r\nWhy these attacks on individuals by name, and two thirds of the Senate\r\ncollectively? Is it the object to drive men here to dissolve social\r\nrelations with political opponents? Is it to turn the Senate into a bear\r\ngarden, where Senators cannot associate on terms which ought to prevail\r\nbetween gentlemen? These attacks are heaped upon me by man after man.\r\nWhen I repel them, it is intimated that I show some feeling on the\r\nsubject. Sir, God grant that when I denounce an act of infamy I shall do\r\nit with feeling, and do it under the sudden impulses of feeling, instead\r\nof sitting up at night writing out my denunciation of a man whom I\r\nhate, copying it, having it printed, punctuating the proof-sheets, and\r\nrepeating it before the glass, in order to give refinement to insult,\r\nwhich is only pardonable when it is the outburst of a just indignation.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall not occupy the time of the Senate. I dislike to\r\nbe forced to repel these attacks upon myself, which seem to be repeated\r\non every occasion. It appears that gentlemen on the other side of the\r\nchamber think they would not be doing justice to their cause if they did\r\nnot make myself a personal object of bitter denunciation and malignity.\r\nI hope that the debate on this bill may be brought to a close at as\r\nearly a day as possible. I shall do no more in these side discussions\r\nthan vindicate myself and repel unjust attacks, but I shall ask the\r\nSenate to permit me to close the debate, when it shall close, in a calm,\r\nkind summary of the whole question, avoiding personalities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER: Mr. President, To the Senator from Illinois, I should\r\nwillingly leave the privilege of the common scold--the last word; but I\r\nwill not leave to him, in any discussion with me, the last argument, or\r\nthe last semblance of it. He has crowned the audacity of this debate by\r\nventuring to rise here and calumniate me. He said that I came here, took\r\nan oath to support the Constitution, and yet determined not to support a\r\nparticular clause in that Constitution. To that statement I give, to his\r\nface, the flattest denial. When it was made on a former occasion on this\r\nfloor by the absent Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Butler), I then\r\nrepelled it. I will read from the debate of the 28th of June, 1854, as\r\npublished in the Globe, to show what I said in response to that calumny\r\nwhen pressed at that hour. Here is what I said to the Senator from South\r\nCarolina:\r\n\r\n\"This Senator was disturbed, when to his inquiry, personally, pointedly,\r\nand vehemently addressed to me, whether I would join in returning a\r\nfellow-man to slavery? I exclaimed, 'Is thy servant a dog, that he\r\nshould do this thing?'\"\r\n\r\nYou will observe that the inquiry of the Senator from South Carolina,\r\nwas whether I would join in returning a fellow-man to slavery. It was\r\nnot whether I would support any clause of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates--far from that. * * *\r\n\r\nSir, this is the Senate of the United States, an important body, under\r\nthe Constitution, with great powers. Its members are justly supposed,\r\nfrom age, to be above the intemperance of youth, and from character to\r\nbe above the gusts of vulgarity. They are supposed to have something of\r\nwisdom, and something of that candor which is the handmaid of wisdom.\r\nLet the Senator bear these things in mind, and let him remember\r\nhereafter that the bowie-knife and bludgeon are not the proper emblems\r\nof Senatorial debate. Let him remember that the swagger of Bob Acres and\r\nthe ferocity of the Malay cannot add dignity to this body. The\r\nSenator has gone on to infuse into his speech the venom which has been\r\nsweltering for months--ay, for years; and he has alleged facts that\r\nare entirely without foundation, in order to heap upon me some personal\r\nobloquy. I will not go into the details which have flowed out so\r\nnaturally from his tongue. I only brand them to his face as false. I\r\nsay, also, to that Senator, and I wish him to bear it in mind, that no\r\nperson with the upright form of man can be allowed--(Hesitation.)\r\n\r\nMR. DOUGLAS:--Say it.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER:--I will say it--no person with the upright form of man can\r\nbe allowed, without violation to all decency, to switch out from his\r\ntongue the perpetual stench of offensive personality. Sir, that is not\r\na proper weapon of debate, at least, on this floor. The noisome, squat,\r\nand nameless animal, to which I now refer, is not a proper model for an\r\nAmerican Senator. Will the Senator from Illinois take notice?\r\n\r\nMR. DOUGLAS:--I will; and therefore will not imitate you, sir.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER:--I did not hear the Senator.\r\n\r\nMR. DOUGLAS:--I said if that be the case I would certainly never imitate\r\nyou in that capacity, recognizing the force of the illustration.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER:--Mr. President, again the Senator has switched his tongue,\r\nand again he fills the Senate with its offensive odor. * * *\r\n\r\nMR. DOUGLAS:--I am not going to pursue this subject further. I will only\r\nsay that a man who has been branded by me in the Senate, and convicted\r\nby the Senate of falsehood, cannot use language requiring a reply, and\r\ntherefore I have nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESTON S. BROOKS,\r\n\r\nOF SOUTH CAROLINA. (BORN 1819, DIED 1857.)\r\n\r\nON THE SUMNER ASSAULT;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JULY 14, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER:\r\n\r\nSome time since a Senator from Massachusetts allowed himself, in an\r\nelaborately prepared speech, to offer a gross insult to my State, and to\r\na venerable friend, who is my State representative, and who was absent\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nNot content with that, he published to the world, and circulated\r\nextensively, this uncalled-for libel on my State and my blood. Whatever\r\ninsults my State insults me. Her history and character have commanded my\r\npious veneration; and in her defence I hope I shall always be prepared,\r\nhumbly and modestly, to perform the duty of a son. I should have\r\nforfeited my own self-respect, and perhaps the good opinion of my\r\ncountrymen, if I had failed to resent such an injury by calling the\r\noffender in question to a personal account. It was a personal affair,\r\nand in taking redress into my own hands I meant no disrespect to the\r\nSenate of the United States or to this House. Nor, sir, did I design\r\ninsult or disrespect to the State of Massachusetts. I was aware of the\r\npersonal responsibilities I incurred, and was willing to meet them. I\r\nknew, too, that I was amenable to the laws of the country, which afford\r\nthe same protection to all, whether they be members of Congress or\r\nprivate citizens. I did not, and do not now believe, that I could be\r\nproperly punished, not only in a court of law, but here also, at the\r\npleasure and discretion of the House. I did not then, and do not now,\r\nbelieve that the spirit of American freemen would tolerate slander in\r\nhigh places, and permit a member of Congress to publish and circulate a\r\nlibel on another, and then call upon either House to protect him against\r\nthe personal responsibilities which he had thus incurred.\r\n\r\nBut if I had committed a breach of privilege, it was the privilege of\r\nthe Senate, and not of this House, which was violated. I was answerable\r\nthere, and not here. They had no right, as it seems to me, to\r\nprosecute me in these Halls, nor have you the right in law or under\r\nthe Constitution, as I respectfully submit, to take jurisdiction over\r\noffences committed against them. The Constitution does not justify them\r\nin making such a request, nor this House in granting it. If, unhappily,\r\nthe day should ever come when sectional or party feeling should run so\r\nhigh as to control all other considerations of public duty or justice,\r\nhow easy it will be to use such precedents for the excuse of arbitrary\r\npower, in either House, to expel members of the minority who may have\r\nrendered themselves obnoxious to the prevailing spirit in the House to\r\nwhich they belong.\r\n\r\nMatters may go smoothly enough when one House asks the other to punish\r\na member who is offensive to a majority of its own body; but how will it\r\nbe when, upon a pretence of insulted dignity, demands are made of\r\nthis House to expel a member who happens to run counter to its party\r\npredilections, or other demands which it may not be so agreeable to\r\ngrant? It could never have been designed by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States to expose the two Houses to such temptations to collision,\r\nor to extend so far the discretionary power which was given to either\r\nHouse to punish its own members for the violation of its rules and\r\norders. Discretion has been said to be the law of the tyrant, and when\r\nexercised under the color of the law, and under the influence of party\r\ndictation, it may and will become a terrible and insufferable despotism.\r\n\r\nThis House, however, it would seem, from the unmistakable tendency of\r\nits proceedings, takes a different view from that which I deliberately\r\nentertain in common with many others.\r\n\r\nSo far as public interests or constitutional rights are involved, I have\r\nnow exhausted my means of defence. I may, then, be allowed to take a\r\nmore personal view of the question at issue. The further prosecution of\r\nthis subject, in the shape it has now assumed, may not only involve my\r\nfriends, but the House itself, in agitations which might be unhappy\r\nin their consequences to the country. If these consequences could be\r\nconfined to myself individually, I think I am prepared and ready to meet\r\nthem, here or elsewhere; and when I use this language I mean what I say.\r\nBut others must not suffer for me. I have felt more on account of my two\r\nfriends who have been implicated,than for myself, for they have proven\r\nthat \"there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.\" I will\r\nnot constrain gentlemen to assume a responsibility on my account, which\r\npossibly they would not run on their own.\r\n\r\nSir, I cannot, on any own account, assume the responsibility, in the\r\nface of the American people, of commencing a line of conduct which in my\r\nheart of hearts I believe would result in subverting the foundations of\r\nthis Government, and in drenching this Hall in blood. No act of mine,\r\non my personal account, shall inaugurate revolution; but when you,\r\nMr. Speaker, return to your own home, and hear the people of the great\r\nNorth--and they are a great people--speak of me as a bad man, you will\r\ndo me the justice to say that a blow struck by me at this time would\r\nbe followed by revolution--and this I know. (Applause and hisses in the\r\ngallery.)\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks (resuming):--If I desired to kill the Senator, why did not I\r\ndo it? You all admit that I had him in my power. Let me tell the member\r\nfrom New Jersey that it was expressly to avoid taking life that I used\r\nan ordinary cane, presented to me by a friend in Baltimore, nearly three\r\nmonths before its application to the \"bare head\" of the Massachusetts\r\nSenator. I went to work very deliberately, as I am charged--and this\r\nis admitted,--and speculated somewhat as to whether I should employ a\r\nhorsewhip or a cowhide; but knowing that the Senator was my superior\r\nin strength, it occurred to me that he might wrest it from my hand, and\r\nthen--for I never attempt anything I do not perform--I might have been\r\ncompelled to do that which I would have regretted the balance of my\r\nnatural life.\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked in certain newspapers, why I did not invite\r\nthe Senator to personal combat in the mode usually adopted. Well, sir,\r\nas I desire the whole truth to be known about the matter, I will for\r\nonce notice a newspaper article on the floor of the House, and answer\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMy answer is, that the Senator would not accept a message; and having\r\nformed the unalterable determination to punish him, I believed that the\r\noffence of \"sending a hostile message,\" superadded to the indictment\r\nfor assault and battery, would subject me to legal penalties more severe\r\nthan would be imposed for a simple assault and battery. That is my\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Speaker, I have nearly finished what I intended to say. If\r\nmy opponents, who have pursued me with unparalleled bitterness, are\r\nsatisfied with the present condition of this affair, I am. I return\r\nmy thanks to my friends, and especially to those who are from\r\nnonslave-owning States, who have magnanimously sustained me, and felt\r\nthat it was a higher honor to themselves to be just in their judgment\r\nof a gentleman than to be a member of Congress for life. In taking my\r\nleave, I feel that it is proper that I should say that I believe that\r\nsome of the votes that have been cast against me have been extorted by\r\nan outside pressure at home, and that their votes do not express the\r\nfeelings or opinions of the members who gave them.\r\n\r\nTo such of these as have given their votes and made their speeches\r\non the constitutional principles involved, and without indulging in\r\npersonal vilification, I owe my respect. But, sir, they have written me\r\ndown upon the history of the country as worthy of expulsion, and in no\r\nunkindness I must tell them that for all future time my self-respect\r\nrequires that I shall pass them as strangers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. Speaker, I announce to you and to this House, that I am no\r\nlonger a member of the Thirty-Fourth Congress.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Brooks then walked out of the House of Representatives.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDAH P. BENJAMIN,\r\n\r\nOF LOUISIANA. (BORN 1811, DIED 1864.)\r\n\r\nON THE PROPERTY DOCTRINE, OR THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN SLAVES;\r\n\r\nSENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, MARCH 11, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, the whole subject of slavery, so far as it is involved\r\nin the issue now before the country, is narrowed down at last to a\r\ncontroversy on the solitary point, whether it be competent for the\r\nCongress of the United States, directly or indirectly, to exclude\r\nslavery from the Territories of the Union. The Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States have given a negative answer to this proposition, and\r\nit shall be my first effort to support that negation by argument,\r\nindependently of the authority of the decision.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the radical, fundamental error which underlies the\r\nargument in affirmation of this power, is the assumption that slavery\r\nis the creature of the statute law of the several States where it is\r\nestablished; that it has no existence outside of the limits of those\r\nStates; that slaves are not property beyond those limits; and\r\nthat property in slaves is neither recognized nor protected by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, nor by international law. I\r\ncontrovert all these propositions, and shall proceed at once to my\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the thirteen colonies, which on the 4th of July, 1776,\r\nasserted their independence, were British colonies, governed by British\r\nlaws. Our ancestors in their emigration to this country brought with\r\nthem the common law of England as their birthright. They adopted its\r\nprinciples for their government so far as it was not incompatible with\r\nthe peculiarities of their situation in a rude and unsettled country.\r\nGreat Britain then having the sovereignty over the colonies, possessed\r\nundoubted power to regulate their institutions, to control their\r\ncommerce, and to give laws to their intercourse, both with the mother\r\nand the other nations of the earth. If I can show, as I hope to be able\r\nto establish to the satisfaction of the Senate, that the nation thus\r\nexercising sovereign power over these thirteen colonies did establish\r\nslavery in them, did maintain and protect the institution, did originate\r\nand carry on the slave trade, did support and foster that trade, that\r\nit forbade the colonies permission either to emancipate or export their\r\nslaves, that it prohibited them from inaugurating any legislation in\r\ndiminution or discouragement of the institution--nay, sir, more, if, at\r\nthe date of our Revolution I can show that African slavery existed in\r\nEngland as it did on this continent, if I can show that slaves were sold\r\nupon the slave mart, in the Exchange and other public places of resort\r\nin the city of London as they were on this continent, then I shall not\r\nhazard too much in the assertion that slavery was the common law of the\r\nthirteen States of the Confederacy at the time they burst the bonds that\r\nunited them to the mother country.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThis legislation, Mr. President, as I have said before, emanating from\r\nthe mother country, fixed the institution upon the colonies. They could\r\nnot resist it. All their right was limited to petition, to remonstrance,\r\nand to attempts at legislation at home to diminish the evil. Every\r\nsuch attempt was sternly repressed by the British Crown. In 1760, South\r\nCarolina passed an act prohibiting the further importation of African\r\nslaves. The act was rejected by the Crown; the Governor was reprimanded;\r\nand a circular was sent to all the Governors of all the colonies,\r\nwarning them against presuming to countenance such legislation. In\r\n1765, a similar bill was twice read in the Assembly of Jamaica. The news\r\nreached Great Britain before its final passage. Instructions were sent\r\nout to the royal Governor; he called the House of Assembly before him,\r\ncommunicated his instructions, and forbade any further progress of the\r\nbill. In 1774, in spite of this discountenancing action of the mother\r\nGovernment, two bills passed the Legislative Assembly of Jamaica; and\r\nthe Earl of Dartmouth, then Secretary of State, wrote to Sir Basil\r\nKeith, the Governor of the colony, that \"these measures had created\r\nalarm to the merchants of Great Britain engaged in that branch of\r\ncommerce;\" and forbidding him, \"on pain of removal from his Government,\r\nto assent to such laws.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1775--mark the date--1775--after the revolutionary struggle\r\nhad commenced, whilst the Continental Congress was in session, after\r\narmies had been levied, after Crown Point and Ticonderoga had been taken\r\npossession of by the insurgent colonists, and after the first blood\r\nshed in the Revolution had reddened the spring sod upon the green at\r\nLexington, this same Earl of Dartmouth, in remonstrance from the agent\r\nof the colonies, replied:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot allow the colonies to check or discourage in any degree a\r\ntraffic so beneficial to the nation.\"\r\n\r\nI say, then, that down to the very moment when our independence was won,\r\nslavery, by the statute law of England, was the common law of the old\r\nthirteen colonies. But, sir, my task does not end here. I desire to show\r\nyou that by her jurisprudence, that by the decisions of her judges, and\r\nthe answers of her lawyers to questions from the Crown and from public\r\nbodies, this same institution was declared to be recognized by the\r\ncommon law of England; and slaves were declared to be, in their\r\nlanguage, merchandise, chattels, just as much private property as any\r\nother merchandise or any other chattel.\r\n\r\nA short time prior to the year 1713, a contract had been formed between\r\nSpain and a certain company, called the Royal Guinea Company, that had\r\nbeen established in France. This contract was technically called in\r\nthose days an _assiento_. By the treaty of Utrecht of the 11th of April,\r\n1713, Great Britain, through her diplomatists, obtained a transfer of\r\nthat contract. She yielded considerations for it. The obtaining of that\r\ncontract was greeted in England with shouts of joy. It was considered\r\na triumph of diplomacy. It was followed in the month of May, 1713, by a\r\nnew contract in form, by which the British Government undertook, for\r\nthe term of thirty years then next to come, to transport annually\r\n4800 slaves to the Spanish American colonies, at a fixed price. Almost\r\nimmediately after this new contract, a question arose in the English\r\nCouncil as to what was the true legal character of the slaves thus to be\r\nexported to the Spanish American colonies; and, according to the forms\r\nof the British constitution, the question was submitted by the Crown in\r\ncouncil to the twelve judges of England. I have their answer here; it is\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n\"In pursuance of His Majesty's order in council, hereunto annexed, we do\r\nhumbly certify our opinion to be that negroes are merchandise.\"\r\n\r\nSigned by Lord Chief-Justice Holt, Judge Pollexfen, and eight other\r\njudges of England.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason. What is the date of that?\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin. It was immediately after the treaty of Utrecht, in 1713.\r\nVery soon afterwards the nascent spirit of fanaticism began to obtain\r\na foothold in England; and although large numbers of negro slaves were\r\nowned in Great Britain, and, as I said before, were daily sold on the\r\npublic exchange in Lon-don, questions arose as to the right of the\r\nowners to retain property in their slaves; and the merchants of London,\r\nalarmed, submitted the question to Sir Philip Yorke, who afterwards\r\nbecame Lord Hardwicke, and to Lord Talbot, who were then the solicitor\r\nand attorney-general of the kingdom. The question was propounded to\r\nthem, \"What are the rights of a British owner of a slave in England?\"\r\nand this is the answer of those two legal functionaries. They certified\r\nthat \"a slave coming from the West Indies to England with or without his\r\nmaster, doth not become free; and his master's property in him is not\r\nthereby determined nor varied, and the master may legally compel him to\r\nreturn to the plantations.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in 1749, the same question again came up before Sir Philip Yorke,\r\nthen Lord Chancellor of England, under the title of Lord Hardwicke, and,\r\nby a decree in chancery in the case before him, he affirmed the doctrine\r\nwhich he had uttered when he was attorney-general of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThings thus stood in England until the year 1771, when the spirit\r\nof fanaticism, to which I have adverted, acquiring strength, finally\r\noperated upon Lord Mansfield, who, by a judgment rendered in a case\r\nknown as the celebrated Sommersett case, subverted the common law of\r\nEngland by judicial legislation, as I shall prove in an instant. I say\r\nit not on my own authority. I would not be so presumptuous. The Senator\r\nfrom Maine (Mr. Fessenden) need not smile at my statement. I will give\r\nhim higher authority than anything I can dare assert. I say that in 1771\r\nLord Mansfield subverted the common law of England in the Sommersett\r\ncase, and decided, not that a slave carried to England from the West\r\nIndies by his master thereby became free, but that by the law of\r\nEngland, if the slave resisted the master, there was no remedy by which\r\nthe master could exercise his control; that the colonial legislation\r\nwhich afforded the master means of controlling his property had no\r\nauthority in England, and that England by her laws had provided no\r\nsubstitute for that authority. That was what Lord Mansfield decided.\r\nI say this was judicial legislation. I say it subverted the entire\r\nprevious jurisprudence of Great Britain. I have just adverted to the\r\nauthorities for that position. Lord Mansfield felt it. The case was\r\nargued before him over and over again, and he begged the parties to\r\ncompromise. They said they would not. \"Why,\" said he, \"I have known\r\nsix of these cases already, and in five out of the six there was a\r\ncompromise; you had better compromise this matter\"; but the parties said\r\nno, they would stand on the law; and then, after holding the case up\r\ntwo terms, Lord Mansfield mustered up courage to say just what I have\r\nasserted to be his decision; that there was no law in England affording\r\nthe master control over his slave; and that therefore the master's\r\nputting him on board of a vessel in irons, being unsupported by\r\nauthority derived from English law, and the colonial law not being in\r\nforce in England, he would discharge the slave from custody on _habeas\r\ncorpus_, and leave the master to his remedy as best he could find one.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden. Decided so unwillingly.\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin. The gentleman is right--very unwillingly. He was driven\r\nto the decision by the paramount power which is now perverting the\r\nprinciples, and obscuring the judgment of the people of the North; and\r\nof which I must say there is no more striking example to be found than\r\nits effect on the clear and logical intellect of my friend from Maine.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I make these charges in relation to that judgment,\r\nbecause in them I am supported by an intellect greater than Mansfield's;\r\nby a judge of resplendent genius and consummate learning; one who, in\r\nall questions of international law, on all subjects not dependent upon\r\nthe peculiar municipal technical common law of England, has won for\r\nhimself the proudest name in the annals of her jurisprudence--the\r\ngentleman knows well that I refer to Lord Stowell. As late as 1827,\r\ntwenty years after Great Britain had abolished the slave trade, six\r\nyears before she was brought to the point of confiscating the property\r\nof her colonies which she had forced them to buy, a case was brought\r\nbefore that celebrated judge; a case known to all lawyers by the name of\r\nthe slave Grace. It was pretended in the argument that the slave Grace\r\nwas free, because she had been carried to England, and it was said,\r\nunder the authority of Lord Mansfield's decision in the Sommersett\r\ncase, that, having once breathed English air, she was free; that the\r\natmosphere of that favored kingdom was too pure to be breathed by a\r\nslave. Lord Stowell, in answering that legal argument, said that after\r\npainful and laborious research into historical records, he did not find\r\nanything touching the peculiar fitness of the English atmosphere for\r\nrespiration during the ten centuries that slaves had lived in England.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAfter that decision had been rendered, Lord Stowell, who was at that\r\ntime in correspondence with Judge Story, sent him a copy of it, and\r\nwrote to him upon the subject of his judgment. No man will doubt the\r\nanti-slavery feelings and proclivities of Judge Story. He was asked to\r\ntake the decision into consideration and give his opinion about it. Here\r\nis his answer:\r\n\r\n\"I have read, with great attention, your judgment in the slave case.\r\nUpon the fullest consideration which I have been able to give the\r\nsubject, I entirely concur in your views. If I had been called upon to\r\npronounce a judgment in a like case, I should have certainly arrived at\r\nthe same result.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the opinion of Judge Story in 1827; but, sir, whilst\r\ncontending, as I here contend, as a proposition, based in history,\r\nmaintained by legislation, supported by judicial authority of the\r\ngreatest weight, that slavery, as an institution, was protected by\r\nthe common law of these colonies at the date of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, I go further, though not necessary to my argument, and\r\ndeclare that it was the common law of North and South America alike.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThus, Mr. President, I say that even if we admit for the moment that\r\nthe common law of the nations which colonized this continent, the\r\ninstitution of slavery at the time of our independence, was dying away\r\nby the manumissions either gratuitous or for a price of those who\r\nheld the people as slaves, yet, so far as the continent of America was\r\nconcerned, North and South, there did not breathe a being who did\r\nnot know that a negro, under the common law of the continent, was\r\nmerchandise, was property, was a slave, and that he could only extricate\r\nhimself from that status, stamped upon him by the common law of the\r\ncountry, by positive proof of manumission. No man was bound to show\r\ntitle to his negro slave. The slave was bound to show manumission under\r\nwhich he had acquired his freedom, by the common law of every colony.\r\nWhy, sir, can any man doubt, is there a gentleman here, even the Senator\r\nfrom Maine, who doubts that if, after the Revolution, the different\r\nStates of this Union had not passed laws upon the subject to abolish\r\nslavery, to subvert this common law of the continent, every one of these\r\nStates would be slave States yet? How came they free States? Did not\r\nthey have this institution of slavery imprinted upon them by the power\r\nof the mother country? How did they get rid of it? All, all must admit\r\nthat they had to pass positive acts of legislation to accomplish this\r\npurpose. Without that legislation they would still be slave States.\r\nWhat, then, becomes of the pretext that slavery only exists in those\r\nStates where it was established by positive legislation, that it has\r\nno inherent vitality out of those States, and that slaves are not\r\nconsidered as property by the Constitution of the United States?\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates of the several colonies which had thus asserted their\r\nindependence of the British Crown met in convention, the decision of\r\nLord Mansfield in the Sommersett case was recent, was known to all. At\r\nthe same time, a number of the northern colonies had taken incipient\r\nsteps for the emancipation of their slaves. Here permit me to say, sir,\r\nthat, with a prudent regard to what the Senator from Maine (Mr. Hamlin)\r\nyesterday called the \"sensitive pocket-nerve,\" they all made these\r\nprovisions prospective. Slavery was to be abolished after a certain\r\nfuture time--just enough time to give their citizens convenient\r\nopportunity for selling the slaves to southern planters, putting the\r\nmoney in their pockets, and then sending to us here, on this floor,\r\nrepresentatives who flaunt in robes of sanctimonious holiness; who make\r\nparade of a cheap philanthropy, exercised at our expense; and who say\r\nto all men: \"Look ye now, how holy, how pure we are; you are polluted by\r\nthe touch of slavery; we are free from it.\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNow, sir, because the Supreme Court of the United States says--what\r\nis patent to every man who reads the Constitution of the United\r\nStates--that it does guaranty property in slaves,it has been attacked\r\nwith vituperation here, on this floor, by Senators on all sides. Some\r\nhave abstained from any indecent, insulting remarks in relation to the\r\nCourt. Some have confined themselves to calm and legitimate argument. To\r\nthem I am about to reply. To the others, I shall have something to say a\r\nlittle later. What says the Senator from Maine (Mr. Fessenden)? He says:\r\n\r\n\"Had the result of that election been otherwise, and had not the\r\n(Democratic) party triumphed on the dogma which they had thus\r\nintroduced, we should never have heard of a doctrine so utterly at\r\nvariance with all truth; so utterly destitute of all legal logic; so\r\nfounded on error, and unsupported by anything like argument, as is the\r\nopinion of the Supreme Court.\"\r\n\r\nHe says, further:\r\n\r\n\"I should like, if I had time, to attempt to demonstrate the fallacy\r\nof that opinion. I have examined the view of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States on the question of the power of the Constitution to carry\r\nslavery into free territory belonging to the United States, and I tell\r\nyou that I believe any tolerably respectable lawyer in the United States\r\ncan show, beyond all question, to any fair and unprejudiced mind, that\r\nthe decision has nothing to stand upon except assumption, and bad logic\r\nfrom the assumptions made. The main proposition on which that decision\r\nis founded, the corner-stone of it, without which it is nothing, without\r\nwhich it fails entirely to satisfy the mind of any man, is this: that\r\nthe Constitution of the United States recognizes property in slaves,\r\nand protects it as such. I deny it. It neither recognizes slaves as\r\nproperty, nor does it protect slaves as property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator here, you see, says that the whole decision is based on\r\nthat assumption, which is false. He says that the Constitution does\r\nnot recognize slaves as property, nor protect them as property, and his\r\nreasoning, a little further on, is somewhat curious. He says:\r\n\r\n\"On what do they found the assertion that the Constitution recognizes\r\nslavery as property? On the provision of the Constitution by which\r\nCongress is prohibited from passing a law to prevent the African\r\nslave trade for twenty years; and therefore they say the Constitution\r\nrecognizes slaves as property.\"\r\n\r\nI should think that was a pretty fair recognition of it. On this point\r\nthe gentleman declares:\r\n\r\n\"Will not anybody see that this constitutional provision, if it works\r\none way, must work the other? If, by allowing the slave trade for twenty\r\nyears, we recognize slaves as property, when we say that at the end of\r\ntwenty years we will cease to allow it, or may cease to do so, is not\r\nthat denying them to be property after that period elapses?\"\r\n\r\nThat is the argument. Nothing but my respect for the logical intellect\r\nof the Senator from Maine could make me treat this argument as serious,\r\nand nothing but having heard it myself would make me believe that he\r\never uttered it. What, sir! The Constitution of our country says to the\r\nSouth, \"you shall count as the basis of your representation five slaves\r\nas being three white men; you may be protected in the natural increase\r\nof your slaves; nay, more, as a matter of compromise you may increase\r\ntheir number if you choose, for twenty years, by importation; when these\r\ntwenty years are out, you shall stop.\" The Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates says, \"well; is not this a recognition of slavery, of property\r\nin slaves?\" \"Oh, no,\" says the gentleman, \"the rule must work both\r\nways; there is a converse to the proposition.\" Now, sir, to an\r\nordinary, uninstructed intellect, it would seem that the converse of the\r\nproposition was simply that at the end of twenty years you should not\r\nany longer increase your numbers by importation; but the gentleman says\r\nthe converse of the proposition is that at the end of the twenty years,\r\nafter you have, under the guarantee of the Constitution, been adding by\r\nimportation to the previous number of your slaves, then all those that\r\nyou had before, and all those that, under that Constitution, you have\r\nimported, cease to be recognized as property by the Constitution, and\r\non this proposition he assails the Supreme Court of the United States--a\r\nproposition which he says will occur to anybody.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden. Will the Senator allow me?\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin. I should be very glad to enter into this debate now, but I\r\nfear it is so late that I shall not be able to get through to-day.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden. I suppose it is of no consequence.\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin. What says the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Collamer), who\r\nalso went into this examination somewhat extensively. I read from his\r\nprinted speech:\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that slaves are never property. I do not say that they\r\nare, or are not. Within the limits of a State which declares them to be\r\nproperty, they are property, because they are within the jurisdiction of\r\nthat government which makes the declaration; but I should wish to speak\r\nof it in the light of a member of the United States Senate, and in the\r\nlanguage of the United States Constitution. If this be property in the\r\nStates, what is the nature and extent of it? I insist that the Supreme\r\nCourt has often decided, and everybody has understood, that slavery is\r\na local institution, existing by force of State law; and of course that\r\nlaw can give it no possible character beyond the limits of that State.\"\r\nI shall no doubt find the idea better expressed in the opinion of Judge\r\nNelson, in this same Dred Scott decision. I prefer to read his language.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"Here is the law; and under it exists the law of slavery in the\r\ndifferent States. By virtue of this very principle it cannot extend\r\none inch beyond its own territorial limits. A State cannot regulate\r\nthe relation of master and slave, of owner and property, the manner and\r\ntitle of descent, or anything else, one inch beyond its territory. Then\r\nyou cannot, by virtue of the law of slavery, if it makes slaves property\r\nin a State, if you please, move that property out of the State. It ends\r\nwhenever you pass from that State. You may pass into another State that\r\nhas a like law; and if you do, you hold it by virtue of that law; but\r\nthe moment you pass beyond the limits of the slaveholding States, all\r\ntitle to the property called property in slaves, there ends. Under such\r\na law slaves cannot be carried as property into the Territories, or\r\nanywhere else beyond the States authorizing it. It is not property\r\nanywhere else. If the Constitution of the United States gives any other\r\nand further character than this to slave property, let us acknowledge it\r\nfairly and end all strife about it. If it does not, I ask in all candor,\r\nthat men on the other side shall say so, and let this point be\r\nsettled. What is the point we are to inquire into? It is this: does\r\nthe Constitution of the United States make slaves property beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the States authorizing slavery? If it only acknowledges\r\nthem as property within that jurisdiction, it has not extended the\r\nproperty one inch beyond the State line; but if, as the Supreme Court\r\nseems to say, it does recognize and protect them as property further\r\nthan State limits, and more than the State laws do, then, indeed, it\r\nbecomes like other property. The Supreme Court rests this claim upon\r\nthis clause of the Constitution: 'No person held to service or labor in\r\none State, under the laws thereof, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall\r\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\nbe due.' Now the question is, does that guaranty it? Does that make\r\nit the same as other property? The very fact that this clause makes\r\nprovision on the subject of persons bound to service, shows that the\r\nframers of the Constitution did not regard it as other property. It\r\nwas a thing that needed some provision; other property did not. The\r\ninsertion of such a provision shows that it was not regarded as other\r\nproperty. If a man's horse stray from Delaware into Pennsylvania, he can\r\ngo and get it. Is there any provision in the Constitution for it? No.\r\nHow came this to be there, if a slave is property? If it is the same as\r\nother property, why have any provision about it?'\"\r\n\r\nIt will undoubtedly have struck any person, in hearing this passage read\r\nfrom the speech of the Senator from Vermont, whom I regret not to see\r\nin his seat to-day, that the whole argument, ingeniously as it is put,\r\nrests upon this fallacy--if I may say so with due respect to him--that\r\na man cannot have title in property wherever the law does not give him\r\na remedy or process for the assertion of his title; or, in other words,\r\nhis whole argument rests upon the old confusion of ideas which considers\r\na man's right and his remedy to be one and the same thing. I have\r\nalready shown to you, by the passages I have cited from the opinions of\r\nLord Stowell and of Judge Story, how they regard this subject. They say\r\nthat the slave who goes to England, or goes to Massachusetts, from a\r\nslave State, is still a slave, that he is still his master's property;\r\nbut that his master has lost control over him, not by reason of the\r\ncessation of his property, but because those States grant no remedy to\r\nthe master by which he can exercise his control.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous illustrations upon this point--illustrations\r\nfurnished by the copyright laws, illustrations furnished by patent laws.\r\nLet us take a case, one that appeals to us all. There lives now a man\r\nin England who from time to time sings to the enchanted ear of the\r\ncivilized world strains of such melody that the charmed senses seem to\r\nabandon the grosser regions of earth, and to rise to purer and serener\r\nregions above. God has created that man a poet. His inspiration is his;\r\nhis songs are his by right divine; they are his property so recognized\r\nby human law; yet here in these United States men steal Tennyson's works\r\nand sell his property for their profit; and this because, in spite of\r\nthe violated conscience of the nation, we refuse to give him protection\r\nfor his property. Examine your Constitution; are slaves the only species\r\nof property there recognized as requiring peculiar protection? Sir, the\r\ninventive genius of our brethren of the North is a source of vast wealth\r\nto them and vast benefit to the nation. I saw a short time ago in one of\r\nthe New York journals, that the estimated value of a few of the patents\r\nnow before us in this Capital for renewal, was $40,000,000. I cannot\r\nbelieve that the entire capital, invested in inventions of this\r\ncharacter in the United States can fall short of one hundred and fifty\r\nor two hundred million dollars. On what protection does this vast\r\nproperty rest? Just upon that same constitutional protection which gives\r\na remedy to the slave owner when his property is, also found outside of\r\nthe limits of the State in which he lives.\r\n\r\nWithout this protection, what would be the condition of the northern\r\ninventor? Why, sir, the Vermont inventor protected by his own law would\r\ncome to Massachusetts, and there say to the pirate who had stolen his\r\nproperty, \"Render me up my property or pay me value for its use.\" The\r\nSenator from Vermont would receive for answer, if he were the counsel of\r\nthe Vermont inventor, \"Sir, if you want protection for your property go\r\nto your own State; property is governed by the laws of the State within\r\nwhose jurisdiction it is found; you have no property in your invention\r\noutside of the limits of your State; you cannot go an inch beyond it.\"\r\nWould not this be so? Does not every man see at once that the right\r\nof the inventor to his discovery, that the right of the poet to his\r\ninspiration, depends upon those principles of eternal justice which God\r\nhas implanted in the heart of man, and that wherever he cannot exercise\r\nthem it is because man, faithless to the trust that he has received from\r\nGod, denies them the protection to which they are entitled?'\r\n\r\nSir, follow out the illustration which the Senator from Vermont himself\r\nhas given; take his very case of the Delaware owner of a horse riding\r\nhim across the line into Pennsylvania. The Senator says: \"Now, you\r\nsee that slaves are not property like other property; if slaves were\r\nproperty like other property, why have you this special clause in your\r\nConstitution to protect a slave? You have no clause to protect the\r\nhorse, because horses are recognized as property everywhere.\" Mr.\r\nPresident, the same fallacy lurks at the bottom of this argument, as of\r\nall the rest. Let Pennsylvania exercise her undoubted jurisdiction over\r\npersons and things within her own boundary; let her do as she has\r\na perfect right to do--declare that hereafter, within the State of\r\nPennsylvania, there shall be no property in horses, and that no man\r\nshall maintain a suit in her courts for the recovery of property in a\r\nhorse; and where will your horse-owner be then? Just where the English\r\npoet is now; just where the slaveholder and the inventor would be if the\r\nConstitution, foreseeing a difference of opinion in relation to rights\r\nin these subject-matters, had not provided the remedy in relation to\r\nsuch property as might easily be plundered. Slaves, if you please, are\r\nnot property like other property in this: that you can easily rob us of\r\nthem; but as to the right in them, that man has to overthrow the\r\nwhole history of the world, he has to overthrow every treatise on\r\njurisprudence, he has to ignore the common sentiment of mankind, he has\r\nto repudiate the authority of all that is considered sacred with man,\r\nere he can reach the conclusion that the person who owns a slave, in\r\na country where slavery has been established for ages, has no other\r\nproperty in that slave than the mere title which is given by the statute\r\nlaw of the land where it is found. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS. (BORN 1809, DIED 1865.)\r\n\r\nON THE DRED SCOTT DECISION,\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JUNE 26, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two\r\npropositions--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States\r\ncourts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the\r\nTerritories. It was made by a divided court--dividing differently on\r\nthe different points. Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the\r\ndecision, and in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I\r\ncould no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he could on Taney.\r\n\r\nHe denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as\r\noffering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite\r\nof the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of\r\nhis master over him?\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions have two uses,--first, to absolutely determine the\r\ncase decided; and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar\r\ncases will be decided when they arise. For the latter use they are\r\ncalled \"precedents\" and \"authorities.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to,\r\nand respect for, the judicial department of government. We think its\r\ndecisions on constitutional questions, when fully settled, should\r\ncontrol not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy\r\nof the country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments to the\r\nConstitution as provided in that instrument itself. More than this would\r\nbe revolution. But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous. We\r\nknow the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions,\r\nand we shall do what we can to have it to overrule this. We offer no\r\nresistance to it.\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents\r\naccording to circumstances. That this should be so accords both with\r\ncommon sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nIf this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence\r\nof the judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance\r\nwith legal public expectation and with the steady practice of the\r\ndepartments throughout our history, and had been in no part based on\r\nassumed historical facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in\r\nsome of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had\r\nthere been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years, it then\r\nmight be, perhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to\r\nacquiesce in it as a precedent.\r\n\r\nBut when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the\r\npublic confidence, it is not factious, it is not even disrespectful, to\r\ntreat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the\r\ncountry. But Judge Douglas considers this view awful. Hear him:\r\n\r\n\"The courts are the tribunals prescribed by the Constitution and created\r\nby the authority of the people to determine, expound, and enforce the\r\nlaw. Hence, whoever resists the final decision of the highest\r\njudicial tribunal aims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of\r\ngovernment--a blow which, if successful, would place all our rights\r\nand liberties at the mercy of passion, anarchy, and violence. I repeat,\r\ntherefore, that if resistance to the decisions of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, in a matter like the points decided in the Dred Scott\r\ncase, clearly within their jurisdiction as defined by the Constitution,\r\nshall be forced upon the country as a political issue, it will become\r\na distinct and naked issue between the friends and enemies of the\r\nConstitution--the friends and the enemies of the supremacy of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nI have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part\r\nbased on assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I\r\nought not to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying\r\nthis; I therefore give an instance or two, which I think fully sustain\r\nme. Chief-Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of\r\nthe court, insists at great length that the negroes were no part of the\r\npeople who made, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence,\r\nor the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in\r\nfive of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters,\r\nand in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the\r\nConstitution that the white people had. He shows this with so much\r\nparticularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of\r\nconclusion on that point, holds the following language:\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the\r\nUnited States, through the action in each State, of those persons who\r\nwere qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of themselves and\r\nall other citizens of the State. In some of the States, as we have seen,\r\ncolored persons were among those qualified by law to act on the subject.\r\nThese colored persons were not only included in the body of 'the\r\npeople of the United States' by whom the Constitution was ordained and\r\nestablished; but in at least five of the States they had the power to\r\nact, and doubtless, did act, by their suffrages, upon the question of\r\nits adoption.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, Chief-Justice Taney says:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion, in\r\nrelation to that unfortunate race which prevailed in the civilized and\r\nenlightened portions of the world at the time of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and when the Constitution of the United States was framed\r\nand adopted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:\r\n\r\n\"The general words above quoted would seem to include the whole human\r\nfamily, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day,\r\nwould be so understood.\"\r\n\r\nIn these the Chief-Justice does not directly assert, but plainly\r\nassumes, as a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more\r\nfavorable now than it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption\r\nis a mistake. In some trifling particulars the condition of that race\r\nhas been ameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change\r\nbetween then and now is decidedly the other way; and their ultimate\r\ndestiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four\r\nyears. In two of the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that\r\nthen gave the free negro the right of voting, the right has since been\r\ntaken away, and in the third--New York--it has been greatly abridged;\r\nwhile it has not been extended, so far as I know, to a single additional\r\nState, though the number of the States has more than doubled. In those\r\ndays, as I understand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate\r\ntheir slaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made\r\nupon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition. In those days\r\nlegislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their\r\nrespective States, but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State\r\nconstitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures. In those\r\ndays, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to the\r\nnew countries was prohibited, but now Congress decides that it will not\r\ncontinue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could\r\nnot if it would. In those days our Declaration of Independence was held\r\nsacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the\r\nbondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered\r\nat and construed, and hawked at and torn, till, if its framers could\r\nrise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it. All the\r\npowers of earth seem rapidly combining against him. Mammon is after him,\r\nambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day is\r\nfast joining the cry. They have him in his prison-house; they have\r\nsearched his person, and left no prying instrument with him. One after\r\nanother they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him; and now they\r\nhave him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys, which can\r\nnever be unlocked without the concurrence of every key--the keys in\r\nthe hands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to a hundred\r\ndifferent and distant places; and they stand musing as to what\r\ninvention, in all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to\r\nmake the impossibility of his escape more complete than it is.\r\n\r\nIt is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the\r\nnegro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government.\r\n\r\nThree years and a half ago, Judge Douglas brought forward his famous\r\nNebraska bill. The country was at once in a blaze. He scorned all\r\nopposition, and carried it through Congress. Since then he has seen\r\nhimself superseded in a presidential nomination by one indorsing the\r\ngeneral doctrine of his measure, but at the same time standing clear\r\nof the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross breach of national\r\nfaith; and he has seen that successful rival constitutionally elected,\r\nnot by the strength of friends, but by the division of adversaries,\r\nbeing in a popular minority of nearly four hundred thousand votes.\r\nHe has seen his chief aids in his own State, Shields and Richardson,\r\npolitically speaking, successively tried, convicted, and executed, for\r\nan offense not their own, but his. And now he sees his own case standing\r\nnext on the docket for trial.\r\n\r\nThere is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at\r\nthe idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races;\r\nand Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of\r\nhis being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself.\r\nIf he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that idea\r\nupon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the storm. He\r\ntherefore clings to this hope, as a drowning man to the last plank.\r\nHe makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the Dred\r\nScott decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the Declaration\r\nof Independence includes all men, black as well as white, and forthwith\r\nhe boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and proceeds to argue\r\ngravely that all who contend it does, do so only because they want to\r\nvote, and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes. He will have it that\r\nthey cannot be consistent else. Now I protest against the counterfeit\r\nlogic which concludes that, because I do not want a black woman for a\r\nslave I must necessarily want her for a wife. I need not have her for\r\neither. I can just leave her alone. In some respects she certainly is\r\nnot my equal; but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with\r\nher own hands without asking leave of any one else, she is my equal, and\r\nthe equal of all others.\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that\r\nthe language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole\r\nhuman family, but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that\r\ninstrument did not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did\r\nnot at once actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this\r\ngrave argument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact that they\r\ndid not at once, or ever afterward, actually place all white people on\r\nan equality with one another. And this is the staple argument of both\r\nthe Chief-Justice and the Senator for doing this obvious violence to the\r\nplain, unmistakable language of the Declaration.\r\n\r\nI think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all\r\nmen, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects.\r\nThey did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect,\r\nmoral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable\r\ndistinctness in what respects they did consider all men created\r\nequal--equal with \"certain inalienable rights, among which are life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" This they said, and this they\r\nmeant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were\r\nthen actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they were about to\r\nconfer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer\r\nsuch a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that enforcement\r\nof it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.\r\n\r\nThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be\r\nfamiliar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly\r\nlabored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly\r\napproximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its\r\ninfluence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people\r\nof all colors everywhere. The assertion that \"all men are created equal\"\r\nwas of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain;\r\nand it was placed in the Declaration not for that, but for future use.\r\nIts authors meant it to be--as, thank God, it is now proving itself--a\r\nstumbling-block to all those who in after times might seek to turn a\r\nfree people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew the\r\nproneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant when such\r\nshould reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation, they\r\nshould find left for them at least one hard nut to crack.\r\n\r\nI have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that\r\npart of the Declaration of Independence which declares that \"all men are\r\ncreated equal.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us hear Judge Douglas's view of the same subject as I find it in\r\nthe printed report of his late speech. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\"No man can vindicate the character, motives, and conduct of the signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, except upon the hypothesis that\r\nthey referred to the white race alone, and not to the African, when they\r\ndeclared all men to have been created equal; that they were speaking of\r\nBritish subjects on this continent being equal to British subjects\r\nborn and residing in Great Britain; that they were entitled to the same\r\ninalienable rights, and among them were enumerated life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness. The Declaration was adopted for the purpose\r\nof justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in\r\nwithdrawing their allegiance from the British crown, and dissolving\r\ntheir connection with the mother country.\"\r\n\r\nMy good friends, read that carefully over in some leisure hour, and\r\nponder well upon it; see what a mere wreck--mangled ruin--it makes of\r\nour once glorious Declaration.\r\n\r\n\"They were speaking of British subjects on this continent being equal to\r\nBritish subjects born and residing in Great Britain.\" Why, according\r\nto this, not only negroes but white people outside of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica were not spoken of in that instrument. The English, Irish, and\r\nScotch, along with white Americans, were included, to be sure, but the\r\nFrench, Germans, and other white people of the world are all gone to pot\r\nalong with the Judge's inferior races.\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration promised something better than the\r\ncondition of British subjects; but no, it only meant that we should be\r\nequal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition. According to\r\nthat, it gave no promise that, having kicked off the king and lords of\r\nGreat Britain, we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement\r\nin the condition of all men everywhere; but no, it merely \"was adopted\r\nfor the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized\r\nworld, in withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown, and\r\ndissolving their connection with the mother country.\" Why, that object\r\nhaving been effected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of\r\nno practical use now--mere rubbish--old wadding left to rot on the\r\nbattle-field after the victory is won.\r\n\r\nI understand you are preparing to celebrate the \"Fourth,\" to-morrow\r\nweek. What for? The doings of that day had no reference to the present;\r\nand quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were\r\nreferred to at that day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even\r\ngo so far as to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it once\r\nin the old-fashioned way, you read it once more with Judge Douglas's\r\nversion. It will then run thus: \"We hold these truths to be\r\nself-evident, that all British subjects who were on this continent\r\neighty-one years ago, were created equal to all British subjects born\r\nand then residing in Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now I appeal to all--to Democrats as well as others--are you really\r\nwilling that the Declaration shall thus be frittered away?--thus left\r\nno more, at most, than an interesting memorial of the dead past?--thus\r\nshorn of its vitality and practical value, and left without the germ or\r\neven the suggestion of the individual rights of man in it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS. (BORN 1809, DIED 1865.)\r\n\r\nON HIS NOMINATION TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE,\r\n\r\nAT THE REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION, SPRINGFIELD, ILLS., JUNE 16, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CONVENTION:\r\n\r\nIf we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we\r\ncould better judge what to do, and how to do it. We are now far into\r\nthe fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object, and\r\nconfident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the\r\noperation of that policy, that agitation not only has not ceased, but\r\nhas constantly augmented. In my opinion, it will not cease until a\r\ncrisis shall have been reached and passed. \"A house divided against\r\nitself cannot stand.\" I believe this Government cannot endure\r\npermanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be\r\ndissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect that\r\nit will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the\r\nother. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of\r\nit, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\r\nis in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as\r\nwell as new, North as well as South. Have we no tendency to the latter\r\ncondition? Let any one who doubts carefully contemplate that now almost\r\ncomplete legal combination piece of machinery, so to speak--compounded\r\nof the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred Scott decision. Let him consider\r\nnot only what work the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted,\r\nbut also let him study the history of its construction, and trace, if\r\nhe can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design and\r\nconcert of action among its chief architects from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the\r\nStates by State constitutions, and from most of the national territory\r\nby Congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the struggle\r\nwhich ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition. This opened all\r\nthe national territory to slavery, and was the first point gained. But,\r\nso far, Congress only had acted, and an indorsement, by the people, real\r\nor apparent, was indispensable, to save the point already gained and\r\ngive chance for more. This necessity had not been overlooked, but had\r\nbeen provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument\r\nof \"squatter sovereignty,\" otherwise called \"sacred right of\r\nself-government\";--which latter phrase though expressive of the only\r\nrightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use\r\nof it as to amount to just this: That, if any one man choose to enslave\r\nanother, no third man shall be allowed to object. That argument was\r\nincorporated with the Nebraska bill itself, in the language which\r\nfollows: \"It being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to\r\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\" Then opened the roar of loose\r\ndeclamation in favor of \"squatter sovereignty,\" and \"sacred right of\r\nself-government.\" \"But,\" said opposition members, \"let us amend the bill\r\nso as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may exclude\r\nslavery.\" \"Not we,\" said the friends of the measure; and down they voted\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nWhile the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress, a law-case,\r\ninvolving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner\r\nhaving voluntarily taken him first into a free State, and then into a\r\nTerritory covered by the Congressional prohibition, and held him as a\r\nslave for a long time in each, was passing through the United States\r\nCircuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska bill and\r\nlawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The\r\nnegro's name was Dred Scott, which name now designates the decision\r\nfinally made in the case. Before the then next Presidential election,\r\nthe law-case came to, and was argued in, the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; but the decision of it was deferred until after the election.\r\nStill, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of the\r\nSenate, requested the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state his\r\nopinion whether the people of a Territory can constitutionally exclude\r\nslavery from their limits; and the latter answers: \"That is a question\r\nfor the Supreme Court.\"\r\n\r\nThe election came, Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such\r\nas it was, secured. That was the second point gained. The indorsement,\r\nhowever, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred\r\nthousand votes, and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and\r\nsatisfactory. The outgoing President, in his last annual message, as\r\nimpressively as possible, echoed back upon the people the weight and\r\nauthority of the indorsement. The Supreme Court met again, did not\r\nannounce their decision, but ordered a re-argument. The Presidential\r\ninauguration came, and still no decision of the court; but the incoming\r\nPresident, in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to\r\nabide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it might be. Then, in a few\r\ndays, came the decision. The reputed author of the Nebraska bill finds\r\nan early occasion to make a speech at this capital, indorsing the Dred\r\nScott decision, and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it. The\r\nnew President, too, seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter\r\nto indorse and strongly construe that decision, and to express his\r\nastonishment that any different view had ever been entertained.\r\n\r\nAt length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of\r\nthe Nebraska bill, on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton\r\nconstitution was, or was not, in any just sense, made by the people of\r\nKansas; and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a\r\nfair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted\r\ndown or voted up.' I do not understand his declaration, that he cares\r\nnot whether slavery be voted _down_ or voted _up_, to be intended by him\r\nother than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon\r\nthe public mind--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so\r\nmuch, and is ready to suffer to the end. And well may he cling to that\r\nprinciple. If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it.\r\nThat principle is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine.\r\nUnder the Dred Scott decision, squatter sovereignty squatted out of\r\nexistence--tumbled down like temporary scaffolding--like the mould\r\nat the foundry, served through one blast, and fell back into loose\r\nsand,--helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds.\r\nHis late joint struggle with the Republicans against the Lecompton\r\nconstitution involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That\r\nstruggle was made on a point--the right of a people to make their own\r\nconstitution--upon which he and the Republicans have never differed.\r\n\r\nThe several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with\r\nSenator Douglas's \"care-not\" policy, constitute the piece of machinery\r\nin its present state of advancement. This was the third point gained.\r\nThe working points of that machinery are: (1) That no negro slave,\r\nimported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave, can ever\r\nbe a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the\r\nConstitution of the United States. This point is made in order to\r\ndeprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of that\r\nprovision of the United States Constitution, which declares that\r\n\"the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States.\" (2) That, \"subject to the\r\nConstitution of the United States,\" neither Congress nor a Territorial\r\nLegislature can exclude slavery from any United States Territory. This\r\npoint is made in order that individual men may fill up the Territories\r\nwith slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and thus to\r\nenhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the\r\nfuture. (3) That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free\r\nState makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts\r\nwill not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave\r\nState the negro may be forced into by the master. This point is made,\r\nnot to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for a while, and\r\napparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the\r\nlogical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with\r\nDred Scott, in the State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do\r\nwith any other one or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in any other\r\nfree State.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska\r\ndoctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion,\r\nat least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted\r\ndown or voted up. This shows exactly where we now are, and partially,\r\nalso, whither we are tending.\r\n\r\nIt will throw additional light on the latter to go back, and run the\r\nmind over the string of historical facts already stated. Several things\r\nwill now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were\r\ntranspiring. The people were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject only\r\nto the Constitution.\" What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders\r\ncould not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche\r\nfor the Dred Scott decision to come in afterward, and declare the\r\nperfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all. Why was\r\nthe amendment expressly declaring the right of the people voted down?\r\nPlainly enough now, the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for\r\nthe Dred Scott decision. Why was the court decision held up? Why even\r\na Senator's individual opinion withheld till after the Presidential\r\nelection? Plainly enough now: the speaking out then would have damaged\r\nthe \"perfectly free\" argument upon which the election was to be carried.\r\nWhy the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the\r\ndelay of a re-argument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation\r\nin favor of the decision? These things look like the cautious patting\r\nand petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him, when it\r\nis dreaded that he may give the rider a fall. And why the hasty after\r\nindorsement of the decision by the President and others?\r\n\r\nWe cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the\r\nresult of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different\r\nportions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and\r\nplaces, and by different workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James,\r\nfor instance,--and when we see these timbers joined together, and see\r\nthat they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons\r\nand mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the\r\ndifferent pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not\r\na piece too many or too few--not omitting even scaffolding,--or, if a\r\nsingle piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted\r\nand prepared yet to bring such piece in,--in such a case, we find it\r\nimpossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James\r\nall understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a\r\ncommon plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was struck.\r\n\r\nIt should not be overlooked that, by the Nebraska bill, the people of a\r\nState, as well as Territory, were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject\r\nonly to the Constitution.\" Why mention a State? They were legislating\r\nfor Territories, and not for or about States. Certainly, the people of\r\na State are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely Territorial\r\nlaw? Why are the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein\r\nlumped together, and their relation to the Constitution therein\r\ntreated as being precisely the same? While the opinion of the court, by\r\nChief-Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions\r\nof all the concurring judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of\r\nthe United States permits neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature\r\nto exclude slavery from any United States Territory, they all omit to\r\ndeclare whether or not the same Constitution permits a State, or the\r\npeople of a State, to exclude it. Possibly, this is a mere omission; but\r\nwho can be quite sure, if McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the\r\nopinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a State to\r\nexclude slavery from their limits, just as Chase and Mace sought to\r\nget such declaration, in behalf of the people of a territory, into the\r\nNebraska bill--I ask, who can be quite sure that it would not have been\r\nvoted down in the one case as it had been in the other? The nearest\r\napproach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery is\r\nmade by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the\r\nprecise idea, and almost the language, too, of the Nebraska act. On\r\none occasion, his exact language is: \"Except in cases when the power\r\nis restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the\r\nState is supreme over the subjects of slavery within its jurisdiction.\"\r\nIn what cases the power of the States is so restrained by the United\r\nStates Constitution is left an open question, precisely as the same\r\nquestion, as to the restraint on the power of the Territories, was\r\nleft open in the Nebraska act. Put this and that together, and we have\r\nanother nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with\r\nanother Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of\r\nthe United States does not permit a State to exclude slavery from its\r\nlimits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine of \"care not\r\nwhether slavery be voted down or voted up,\" shall gain upon the public\r\nmind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained\r\nwhen made.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in\r\nall the States. Welcome or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming,\r\nand will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political\r\ndynasty shall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly\r\ndreaming that the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their\r\nState free, and we shall awake to the reality, instead, that the Supreme\r\nCourt has made Illinois a slave State. To meet and overthrow\r\nthat dynasty is the work before all those who would prevent that\r\nconsummation. That is what we have to do. How can we best do it?\r\n\r\nThere are those who denounce us openly to their own friends, and yet\r\nwhisper us softly that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there\r\nis with which to effect that object. They wish us to infer all, from\r\nthe fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the\r\ndynasty; and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon\r\nwhich he and we have never differed. They remind us that he is a\r\ngreat man, and that the largest of us are very small ones. Let this be\r\ngranted. \"But a living dog is better than a dead lion.\" Judge Douglas,\r\nif not a dead lion, for this work, is at least a caged and toothless\r\none. How can he oppose the advances of slavery? He don't care anything\r\nabout it. His avowed mission is impressing the \"public heart\" to\r\ncare nothing about it. A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper thinks\r\nDouglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the\r\nAfrican slave-trade. Does Douglas believe an effort to revive that trade\r\nis approaching? He has not said so. Does he really think so? But if it\r\nis, how can he resist it? For years he has labored to prove it a sacred\r\nright of white men to take negro slaves into the new Territories. Can he\r\npossibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can\r\nbe bought cheapest? And unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in\r\nAfrica than in Virginia. He has done all in his power to reduce the\r\nwhole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property; and as\r\nsuch, how can he oppose the foreign slave-trade? How can he refuse that\r\ntrade in that \"property\" shall be \"perfectly free,\" unless he does it\r\nas a protection to the home production? And as the home producers will\r\nprobably ask the protection, he will be wholly without a ground of\r\nopposition. Senator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be\r\nwiser to-day than he was yesterday--that he may rightfully change when\r\nhe finds himself wrong. But can we, for that reason, run ahead, and\r\ninfer that he will make any particular change, of which he himself has\r\ngiven no intimation? Can we safely base our action upon any such vague\r\ninference? Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent Judge Douglas's\r\nposition, question his motives, or do aught that can be personally\r\noffensive to him. Whenever, if ever, he and we can come together on\r\nprinciple, so that our cause may have assistance from his great ability,\r\nI hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle. But, clearly, he is\r\nnot now with us--he does not pretend to be, he does not promise ever to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nOur cause, then, must be entrusted to, and conducted by its own\r\nundoubted friends--those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the\r\nwork--who do care for the result. Two years ago the Republicans of the\r\nnation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under\r\nthe single impulse of resistance to a common danger. With every external\r\ncircumstance against us, of strange, discordant, and even hostile\r\nelements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the\r\nbattle through, under the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and\r\npampered enemy. Did we brave all then, to falter now?--now, when that\r\nsame enemy is wavering, dissevered, and belligerent! The result is not\r\ndoubtful. We shall not fail--if we stand firm, we shall not fail. Wise\r\ncounsels may accelerate, or mistakes delay it; but, sooner or later, the\r\nvictory is sure to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN ARNOLD DOUGLAS,\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS. (BORN 1813, DIED 1861.)\r\n\r\nIN REPLY TO MR. LINCOLN;\r\n\r\nFREEPORT, ILLS., AUGUST 27, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI am glad that at last I have brought Mr. Lincoln to the conclusion\r\nthat he had better define his position on certain political questions\r\nto which I called his attention at Ottawa. * * * In a few moments I\r\nwill proceed to review the answers which he has given to these\r\ninterrogatories; but, in order to relieve his anxiety, I will first\r\nrespond to those which he has presented to me. Mark you, he has not\r\npresented interrogatories which have ever received the sanction of the\r\nparty with which I am acting, and hence he has no other foundation for\r\nthem than his own curiosity.\r\n\r\nFirst he desires to know, if the people of Kansas shall form a\r\nconstitution by means entirely proper and unobjectionable, and ask\r\nadmission as a State, before they have the requisite population for a\r\nmember of Congress, whether I will vote for that admission. Well, now,\r\nI regret exceedingly that he did not answer that interrogatory himself\r\nbefore he put it to me, in order that we might understand, and not\r\nbe left to infer, on which side he is. Mr. Trumbull, during the last\r\nsession of Congress, voted from the beginning to the end against the\r\nadmission of Oregon, although a free State, because she had not the\r\nrequisite population for a member of Congress. Mr. Trumbull would not\r\nconsent, under any circumstances, to let a State, free or slave, come\r\ninto the Union until it had the requisite population. As Mr. Trumbull is\r\nin the field fighting for Mr. Lincoln, I would like to have Mr. Lincoln\r\nanswer his own question and tell me whether he is fighting Trumbull on\r\nthat issue or not. But I will answer his question. * * * Either Kansas\r\nmust come in as a free State, with whatever population she may have, or\r\nthe rule must be applied to all the other Territories alike. I therefore\r\nanswer at once that, it having been decided that Kansas has people\r\nenough for a slave State, I hold that she has enough for a free State.\r\nI hope Mr. Lincoln is satisfied with my answer; and now I would like to\r\nget his answer to his own interrogatory--whether or not he will vote\r\nto admit Kansas before she has the requisite population. I want to\r\nknow whether he will vote to admit Oregon before that Territory has the\r\nrequisite population. Mr. Trumbull will not, and the same reason that\r\ncommits Mr. Trumbull against the admission of Oregon commits him against\r\nKansas, even if she should apply for admission as a free State. If there\r\nis any sincerity, any truth, in the argument of Mr. Trumbull in the\r\nSenate against the admission of Oregon, because she had not 93,420\r\npeople, although her population was larger than that of Kansas, he\r\nstands pledged against the admission of both Oregon and Kansas until\r\nthey have 93,420 inhabitants. I would like Mr. Lincoln to answer this\r\nquestion. I would like him to take his own medicine. If he differs\r\nwith Mr. Trumbull, let him answer his argument against the admission of\r\nOregon, instead of poking questions at me.\r\n\r\nThe next question propounded to me by Mr. Lincoln is, Can the people of\r\nthe Territory in any lawful way, against the wishes of any citizen\r\nof the United States, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the\r\nformation of a State Constitution? I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln\r\nhas heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that\r\nin my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means,\r\nexclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State\r\nConstitution. Mr. Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over\r\nand over again. He heard me argue the Nebraska bill on that principle\r\nall over the State in 1854, in 1855, and in 1856; and he has no excuse\r\nfor pretending to be in doubt as to my position on that question. It\r\nmatters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the\r\nabstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory\r\nunder the Constitution; the people have the lawful means to introduce it\r\nor exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist\r\na day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police\r\nregulations. Those police regulations can only be established by the\r\nlocal Legislature; and, if the people are opposed to slavery, they will\r\nelect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation\r\neffectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the\r\ncontrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension.\r\nHence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on\r\nthat abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave\r\nTerritory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska\r\nbill. I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I will notice the charge which he has introduced\r\nin relation to Mr. Chase's amendment. I thought that I had chased that\r\namendment out of Mr. Lincoln's brain at Ottawa; but it seems that it\r\nstill haunts his imagination, and that he is not yet satisfied. I had\r\nsupposed that he would be ashamed to press that question further. He is\r\na lawyer, and has been a member of Congress, and has occupied his time\r\nand amused you by telling you about parliamentary proceedings. He ought\r\nto have known better than to try to palm off his miserable impositions\r\nupon this intelligent audience. The Nebraska bill provided that the\r\nlegislative power and authority of the said Territory should extend to\r\nall rightful subjects of legislation, consistent with the organic act\r\nand the Constitution of the United States. It did not make any exception\r\nas to slavery, but gave all the power that it was possible for Congress\r\nto give, without violating the Constitution, to the Territorial\r\nLegislature, with no exception or limitation on the subject of slavery\r\nat all. The language of that bill, which I have quoted, gave the\r\nfull power and the fuller authority over the subject of slavery,\r\naffirmatively and negatively, to introduce it or exclude it, so far as\r\nthe Constitution of the United States would permit. What more could Mr.\r\nChase give by his amendment? Nothing! He offered his amendment for\r\nthe identical purpose for which Mr. Lincoln is using it, to enable\r\ndemagogues in the country to try and deceive the people. His amendment\r\nwas to this effect. It provided that the Legislature should have power\r\nto exclude slavery; and General Cass suggested: \"Why not give the power\r\nto introduce as well as to exclude?\" The answer was--they have the power\r\nalready in the bill to do both. Chase was afraid his amendment would be\r\nadopted if he put the alternative proposition, and so made it fair both\r\nways, and would not yield. He offered it for the purpose of having it\r\nrejected. He offered it, as he has himself avowed over and over again,\r\nsimply to make capital out of it for the stump. He expected that it\r\nwould be capital for small politicians in the country, and that they\r\nwould make an effort to deceive the people with it; and he was not\r\nmistaken, for Lincoln is carrying out the plan admirably. * * *\r\n\r\nThe third question which Mr. Lincoln presented is--If the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States shall decide that a State of this Union cannot\r\nexclude slavery from its own limits, will I submit to it? I am amazed\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln should ask such a question. Mr. Lincoln's object is to\r\ncast an imputation upon the Supreme Court. He knows that there never was\r\nbut one man in America, claiming any degree of intelligence or decency,\r\nwho ever for a moment pretended such a thing. It is true that the\r\n_Washington Union_, in an article published on the 17th of last\r\nDecember, did put forth that doctrine, and I denounced the article on\r\nthe floor of the Senate. * * * Lincoln's friends, Trumbull, and Seward,\r\nand Hale, and Wilson, and the whole Black Republican side of the Senate\r\nwere silent. They left it to me to denounce it. And what was the\r\nreply made to me on that occasion? Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, got up and\r\nundertook to lecture me on the ground that I ought not to have deemed\r\nthe article worthy of notice, and ought not to have replied to it; that\r\nthere was not one man, woman, or child south of the Potomac, in any\r\nslave State, who did not repudiate any such pretension. Mr. Lincoln\r\nknows that reply was made on the spot, and yet now he asks this\r\nquestion! He might as well ask me--Suppose Mr. Lincoln should steal a\r\nhorse, would I sanction it; and it would be as genteel in me to ask him,\r\nin the event he stole a horse, what ought to be done with him. He casts\r\nan imputation upon the Supreme Court of the United States, by supposing\r\nthat they would violate the Constitution of the United States. I tell\r\nhim that such a thing is not possible. It would be an act of moral\r\ntreason that no man on the bench could ever descend to. Mr. Lincoln\r\nhimself would never, in his partisan feelings, so far forget what was\r\nright as to be guilty of such an act.\r\n\r\nThe fourth question of Mr. Lincoln is--Are you in favor of acquiring\r\nadditional territory in disregard as to how such acquisition may affect\r\nthe Union on the slavery question? This question is very ingeniously and\r\ncunningly put. The Black Republican crowd lays it down expressly that\r\nunder no circumstances shall we acquire any more territory unless\r\nslavery is first prohibited in the country. I ask Mr. Lincoln whether he\r\nis in favor of that proposition? Are you opposed to the acquisition\r\nof any more territory, under any circumstances, unless slavery is\r\nprohibited in it? That he does not like to answer. When I ask him\r\nwhether he stands up to that article in the platform of his party, he\r\nturns, Yankee fashion, and, without answering it, asks me whether I am\r\nin favor of acquiring territory without regard to how it may affect\r\nthe Union on the slavery question. I answer that, whenever it becomes\r\nnecessary, in our growth and progress, to acquire more territory, I am\r\nin favor of it without reference to the question of slavery, and when\r\nwe have acquired it, I will leave the people free to do as they please,\r\neither to make it slave or free territory, as they prefer. It is idle\r\nto tell me or you that we have territory enough. * * * With our natural\r\nincrease, growing with a rapidity unknown in any other part of the\r\nglobe, with the tide of emigration that is fleeing from despotism in the\r\nold world to seek refuge in our own, there is a constant torrent pouring\r\ninto this country that requires more land, more territory upon which\r\nto settle; and just as fast as our interest and our destiny require\r\nadditional territory in the North, in the South, or in the islands of\r\nthe ocean, I am for it, and, when we acquire it, will leave the people,\r\naccording to the Nebraska bill, free to do as they please on the subject\r\nof slavery and every other question.\r\n\r\nI trust now that Mr. Lincoln will deem him-self answered on his four\r\npoints. He racked his brain so much in devising these four questions\r\nthat he exhausted himself, and had not strength enough to invent the\r\nothers. As soon as he is able to hold a council with his advisers,\r\nLove-joy, Farnsworth, and Fred Douglas, he will frame and propound\r\nothers (\"Good,\" \"good!\"). You Black Republicans who say \"good,\" I have\r\nno doubt, think that they are all good men. I have reason to recollect\r\nthat some people in this country think that Fred Douglas is a very good\r\nman. The last time I came here to make a speech, while talking from\r\na stand to you, people of Freeport, as I am doing to-day, I saw a\r\ncarriage, and a magnificent one it was, drive up and take a position on\r\nthe outside of the crowd; a beautiful young lady was sitting on the box\r\nseat, whilst Fred Douglas and her mother reclined inside, and the owner\r\nof the carriage acted as driver. I saw this in your own town. (\"What\r\nof it?\") All I have to say of it is this, that if you Black Republicans\r\nthink that the negro ought to be on a social equality with your wives\r\nand daughters, and ride in a carriage with your wife, whilst you drive\r\nthe team, you have a perfect right to do so. I am told that one of Fred\r\nDouglas' kinsmen, another rich black negro, is now travelling in this\r\npart of the State making speeches for his friend Lincoln as the champion\r\nof black men. (\"What have you to say against it?\") All I have to say on\r\nthat subject is, that those of you who believe that the negro is your\r\nequal, and ought to be on an equality with you socially, politically,\r\nand legally, have a right to entertain those opinions, and of course\r\nwill vote for Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWM. H. SEWARD,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK. (BORN 1801, DIED 1872.)\r\n\r\nON THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT;\r\n\r\nROCHESTER, OCTOBER 25, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE unmistakable outbreaks of zeal which occur all around me, show that\r\nyou are earnest men--and such a man am I. Let us therefore, at least\r\nfor a time, pass all secondary and collateral questions, whether of a\r\npersonal or of a general nature, and consider the main subject of the\r\npresent canvass. The Democratic party, or, to speak more accurately, the\r\nparty which wears that attractive name--is in possession of the Federal\r\nGovernment. The Republicans propose to dislodge that party, and dismiss\r\nit from its high trust.\r\n\r\nThe main subject, then, is, whether the Democratic party deserves to\r\nretain the confidence of the American people. In attempting to prove\r\nit unworthy, I think that I am not actuated by prejudices against that\r\nparty, or by pre-possessions in favor of its adversary; for I have\r\nlearned, by some experience, that virtue and patriotism, vice and\r\nselfishness, are found in all parties, and that they differ less in\r\ntheir motives than in the policies they pursue.\r\n\r\nOur country is a theatre, which exhibits, in full operation, two\r\nradically different political systems; the one resting on the basis of\r\nservile or slave labor, the other on voluntary labor of freemen. The\r\nlaborers who are enslaved are all negroes, or persons more or less\r\npurely of African derivation. But this is only accidental. The principle\r\nof the system is, that labor in every society, by whomsoever performed,\r\nis necessarily unintellectual, grovelling and base; and that the\r\nlaborer, equally for his own good and for the welfare of the State,\r\nought to be enslaved. The white laboring man, whether native or\r\nforeigner, is not enslaved, only because he cannot, as yet, be reduced\r\nto bondage.\r\n\r\nYou need not be told now that the slave system is the older of the two,\r\nand that once it was universal. The emancipation of our own ancestors,\r\nCaucasians and Europeans as they were, hardly dates beyond a period of\r\nfive hundred years. The great melioration of human society which modern\r\ntimes exhibit, is mainly due to the incomplete substitution of the\r\nsystem of voluntary labor for the one of servile labor, which has\r\nalready taken place. This African slave system is one which, in its\r\norigin and in its growth, has been altogether foreign from the habits\r\nof the races which colonized these States, and established civilization\r\nhere. It was introduced on this continent as an engine of conquest, and\r\nfor the establishment of monarchical power, by the Portuguese and the\r\nSpaniards, and was rapidly extended by them all over South America,\r\nCentral America, Louisiana, and Mexico. Its legitimate fruits are seen\r\nin the poverty, imbecility, and anarchy which now pervade all Portuguese\r\nand Spanish America. The free-labor system is of German extraction, and\r\nit was established in our country by emigrants from Sweden, Holland,\r\nGermany, Great Britain and Ireland. We justly ascribe to its influences\r\nthe strength, wealth, greatness, intelligence, and freedom, which the\r\nwhole American people now enjoy. One of the chief elements of the value\r\nof human life is freedom in the pursuit of happiness. The slave system\r\nis not only intolerable, unjust, and inhuman, toward the laborer, whom,\r\nonly because he is a laborer, it loads down with chains and converts\r\ninto merchandise, but is scarcely less severe upon the freeman, to whom,\r\nonly because he is a laborer from necessity, it denies facilities for\r\nemployment, and whom it expels from the community because it cannot\r\nenslave and convert into merchandise also. It is necessarily improvident\r\nand ruinous, because, as a general truth, communities prosper and\r\nflourish, or droop and decline, in just the degree that they practise\r\nor neglect to practise the primary duties of justice and humanity.\r\nThe free-labor system conforms to the divine law of equality, which is\r\nwritten in the hearts and consciences of man, and therefore is always\r\nand everywhere beneficent.\r\n\r\nThe slave system is one of constant danger, distrust, suspicion, and\r\nwatchfulness. It debases those whose toil alone can produce wealth and\r\nresources for defence, to the lowest degree of which human nature is\r\ncapable, to guard against mutiny and insurrection, and thus wastes\r\nenergies which otherwise might be employed in national development and\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\nThe free-labor system educates all alike, and by opening all the fields\r\nof industrial employment and all the departments of authority, to the\r\nunchecked and equal rivalry of all classes of men, at once secures\r\nuniversal contentment, and brings into the highest possible activity all\r\nthe physical, moral, and social energies of the whole state. In states\r\nwhere the slave system prevails, the masters, directly or indirectly,\r\nsecure all political power, and constitute a ruling aristocracy.\r\nIn states where the free-labor system prevails, universal suffrage\r\nnecessarily obtains, and the state inevitably becomes, sooner or later,\r\na republic or democracy.\r\n\r\nRussia yet maintains slavery, and is a despotism. Most of the other\r\nEuropean states have abolished slavery, and adopted the system of free\r\nlabor. It was the antagonistic political tendencies of the two systems\r\nwhich the first Napoleon was contemplating when he predicted that Europe\r\nwould ultimately be either all Cossack or all republican. Never did\r\nhuman sagacity utter a more pregnant truth. The two systems are at once\r\nperceived to be incongruous. But they are more than incongruous--they\r\nare incompatible. They never have permanently existed together in\r\none country, and they never can. It would be easy to demonstrate this\r\nimpossibility, from the irreconcilable contrast between their great\r\nprinciples and characteristics. But the experience of mankind has\r\nconclusively established it. Slavery, as I have already intimated,\r\nexisted in every state in Europe. Free labor has supplanted it\r\neverywhere except in Russia and Turkey. State necessities developed in\r\nmodern times are now obliging even those two nations to encourage and\r\nemploy free labor; and already, despotic as they are, we find them\r\nengaged in abolishing slavery. In the United States, slavery came into\r\ncollision with free labor at the close of the last century, and fell\r\nbefore it in New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,\r\nbut triumphed over it effectually, and excluded it for a period yet\r\nundetermined, from Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. Indeed,\r\nso incompatible are the two systems, that every new State which is\r\norganized within our ever-extending domain makes its first political act\r\na choice of the one and the exclusion of the other, even at the cost\r\nof civil war, if necessary. The slave States, without law, at the last\r\nnational election, successfully forbade, within their own limits, even\r\nthe casting of votes for a candidate for President of the United States\r\nsupposed to be favorable to the establishment of the free-labor system\r\nin new States.\r\n\r\nHitherto, the two systems have existed in different States, but side by\r\nside within the American Union. This has happened because the Union is\r\na confederation of States. But in another aspect the United States\r\nconstitute only one nation. Increase of population, which is filling\r\nthe States out to their very borders, together with a new and extended\r\nnetwork of railroads and other avenues, and an internal commerce which\r\ndaily becomes more intimate, is rapidly bringing the States into a\r\nhigher and more perfect social unity or consolidation. Thus, these\r\nantagonistic systems are continually coming into closer contact, and\r\ncollision results.\r\n\r\nShall I tell you what this collision means? They who think that it is\r\naccidental, unnecessary, the work of interested or fanatical agitators,\r\nand therefore ephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an\r\nirrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it\r\nmeans that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become\r\neither entirely a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.\r\nEither the cotton- and rice-fields of South Carolina and the sugar\r\nplantations of Louisiana will ultimately be tilled by free-labor, and\r\nCharleston and New Orleans become marts of legitimate merchandise alone,\r\nor else the rye-fields and wheat-fields of Massachusetts and New York\r\nmust again be surrendered by their farmers to slave culture and to the\r\nproduction of slaves, and Boston and New York become once more markets\r\nfor trade in the bodies and souls of men. It is the failure to apprehend\r\nthis great truth that induces so many unsuccessful attempts at final\r\ncompromises between the slave and free States, and it is the existence\r\nof this great fact that renders all such pretended compromises, when\r\nmade, vain and ephemeral. Startling as this saying may appear to you,\r\nfellow-citizens, it is by no means an original or even a modern one. Our\r\nforefathers knew it to be true, and unanimously acted upon it when\r\nthey framed the Constitution of the United States. They regarded the\r\nexistence of the servile system in so many of the States with sorrow and\r\nshame, which they openly confessed, and they looked upon the collision\r\nbetween them, which was then just revealing itself, and which we are now\r\naccustomed to deplore, with favor and hope. They knew that one or the\r\nother system must exclusively prevail.\r\n\r\nUnlike too many of those who in modern time invoke their authority, they\r\nhad a choice between the two. They preferred the system of free labor,\r\nand they determined to organize the government, and so direct its\r\nactivity, that that system should surely and certainly prevail. For this\r\npurpose, and no other, they based the whole structure of the government\r\nbroadly on the principle that all men are created equal, and therefore\r\nfree--little dreaming that, within the short period of one hundred\r\nyears, their descendants would bear to be told by any orator, however\r\npopular, that the utterance of that principle was merely a rhetorical\r\nrhapsody; or by any judge, however venerated, that it was attended by\r\nmental reservation, which rendered it hypocritical and false. By the\r\nordinance of 1787, they dedicated all of the national domain not yet\r\npolluted by slavery to free labor immediately, thenceforth and forever;\r\nwhile by the new Constitution and laws they invited foreign free labor\r\nfrom all lands under the sun, and interdicted the importation of African\r\nslave labor, at all times, in all places, and under all circumstances\r\nwhatsoever. It is true that they necessarily and wisely modified this\r\npolicy of freedom by leaving it to the several States, affected as they\r\nwere by different circumstances, to abolish slavery in their own way and\r\nat their own pleasure, instead of confiding that duty to Congress; and\r\nthat they secured to the slave States, while yet retaining the system\r\nof slavery, a three-fifths representation of slaves in the Federal\r\nGovernment, until they should find themselves able to relinquish it\r\nwith safety. But the very nature of these modifications fortifies my\r\nposition, that the fathers knew that the two systems could not endure\r\nwithin the Union, and expected within a short period slavery would\r\ndisappear forever. Moreover, in order that these modifications might not\r\naltogether defeat their grand design of a republic maintaining universal\r\nequality, they provided that two thirds of the States might amend the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say on this point only one word, to guard against\r\nmisapprehension. If these States are to again become universally\r\nslave-holding, I do not pretend to say with what violations of the\r\nConstitution that end shall be accomplished. On the other hand, while I\r\ndo confidently believe and hope that my country will yet become a land\r\nof universal freedom, I do not expect that it will be made so otherwise\r\nthan through the action of the several States cooperating with the\r\nFederal Government, and all acting in strict conformity with their\r\nrespective constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe strife and contentions concerning slavery, which gently-disposed\r\npersons so habitually deprecate, are nothing more than the ripening of\r\nthe conflict which the fathers themselves not only thus regarded with\r\nfavor, but which they may be said to have instituted.\r\n\r\n* * * I know--few, I think, know better than I--the resources and\r\nenergies of the Democratic party, which is identical with the slave\r\npower. I do ample justice to its traditional popularity. I know\r\nfurther--few, I think, know better than I--the difficulties and\r\ndisadvantages of organizing a new political force, like the Republican\r\nparty, and the obstacles it must encounter in laboring without prestige\r\nand without patronage. But, understanding all this, I know that the\r\nDemocratic party must go down, and that the Republican party must rise\r\ninto its place. The Democratic party derived its strength, originally,\r\nfrom its adoption of the principles of equal and exact justice to\r\nall men. So long as it practised this principle faithfully, it was\r\ninvulnerable. It became vulnerable when it renounced the principle,\r\nand since that time it has maintained itself, not by virtue of its own\r\nstrength, or even of its traditional merits, but because there as\r\nyet had appeared in the political field no other party that had the\r\nconscience and the courage to take up, and avow, and practise the\r\nlife-inspiring principle which the Democratic party had surrendered.\r\nAt last, the Republican party has appeared. It avows, now, as the\r\nRepublican party of 1800 did, in one word, its faith and its works,\r\n\"Equal and exact justice to all men.\" Even when it first entered the\r\nfield, only half organized, it struck a blow which only just failed to\r\nsecure complete and triumphant victory. In this, its second campaign, it\r\nhas already won advantages which render that triumph now both easy and\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nThe secret of its assured success lies in that very characteristic\r\nwhich, in the mouth of scoffers, constitutes its great and lasting\r\nimbecility and reproach. It lies in the fact that it is a party of\r\none idea; but that is a noble one--an idea that fills and expands all\r\ngenerous souls; the idea of equality--the equality of all men before\r\nhuman tribunals and human laws, as they all are equal before the Divine\r\ntribunal and Divine laws.\r\n\r\nI know, and you know, that a revolution has begun. I know, and all the\r\nworld knows, that revolutions never go backward. Twenty Senators and a\r\nhundred Representatives proclaim boldly in Congress to-day sentiments\r\nand opinions and principles of freedom which hardly so many men, even\r\nin this free State, dared to utter in their own homes twenty years ago.\r\nWhile the Government of the United States, under the conduct of the\r\nDemocratic party, has been all that time surrendering one plain and\r\ncastle after another to slavery, the people of the United States have\r\nbeen no less steadily and perseveringly gathering together the forces\r\nwith which to recover back again all the fields and all the castles\r\nwhich have been lost, and to confound and overthrow, by one decisive\r\nblow, the betrayers of the Constitution and freedom forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. -- SECESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of our history it has been a mooted question whether\r\nwe are to consider the United States as a political state or as a\r\ncongeries of political states, as a _Bundesstaat_ or as a _Staatenbund_.\r\nThe essence of the controversy seems to be contained in the very title\r\nof the republic, one school laying stress on the word United, as the\r\nother does on the word States. The phases of the controversy have been\r\nbeyond calculation, and one of its consequences has been a civil war of\r\ntremendous energy and cost in blood and treasure.\r\n\r\nLooking at the facts alone of our history, one would be most apt to\r\nconclude that the United States had been a political state from the\r\nbeginning, its form being entirely revolutionary until the final\r\nratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781, then under the\r\nvery loose and inefficient government of the Articles until 1789,\r\nand thereafter under the very efficient national government of the\r\nConstitution; that, in the final transformation of 1787-9, there were\r\nfeatures which were also decidedly revolutionary; but that there was\r\nno time when any of the colonies had the prospect or the power of\r\nestablishing a separate national existence of its own. The facts are\r\nnot consistent with the theory that the States ever were independent\r\npolitical states, in any scientific sense.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, however, that the actors in the history always had\r\na clear perception of the facts as they took place. In the teeth of the\r\nfacts, our early history presents a great variety of assertions of State\r\nindependence by leading men, State Legislatures, or State constitutions,\r\nwhich still form the basis of the argument for State sovereignty. The\r\nState constitutions declared the State to be sovereign and independent,\r\neven though the framers knew that the existence of the State depended\r\non the issue of the national struggle against the mother country. The\r\ntreaty of 1783 with Great Britain recognized the States separately and\r\nby name as \"free, sovereign, and independent,\" even while it established\r\nnational boundaries outside of the States, covering a vast western\r\nterritory in which no State would have ventured to forfeit its\r\ninterest by setting up a claim to practical freedom, sovereignty, or\r\nindependence. All our early history is full of such contradictions\r\nbetween fact and theory. They are largely obscured by the\r\nundiscriminating use of the word \"people.\" As used now, it usually means\r\nthe national people; but many apparently national phrases as to the\r\n\"sovereignty of the people,\" as they were used in 1787-9, would seem\r\nfar less national if the phraseology could show the feeling of those\r\nwho then used them that the \"people\" referred to was the people of\r\nthe State. In that case the number of the contradictions would be\r\nindefinitely increased; and the phraseology of the Constitution's\r\npreamble, \"We, the people of the United States,\" would not be offered\r\nas a consciously nationalizing phrase of its framers. It is hardly to\r\nbe doubted, from the current debates, that the conventions of\r\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, and South Carolina, seven of the thirteen States, imagined and\r\nassumed that each ratified the Constitution in 1788--90 by authority of\r\nthe State's people alone, by the State's sovereign will; while the facts\r\nshow that in each of these conventions a clear majority was coerced\r\ninto ratification by a strong minority in its own State, backed by\r\nthe unanimous ratifications of the other States. If ratification or\r\nrejection had really been open to voluntary choice, to sovereign will,\r\nthe Constitution would never have had a moment's chance of life; so far\r\nfrom being ratified by nine States as a condition precedent to going\r\ninto effect, it would have been summarily rejected by a majority of the\r\nStates. In the language of John Adams, the Constitution was \"extorted\r\nfrom the grinding necessities of a reluctant people.\" The theory of\r\nState sovereignty was successfully contradicted by national necessities.\r\n\r\nThe change from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution,\r\nthough it could not help antagonizing State sovereignty, was carefully\r\nmanaged so as to do so as little as possible. As soon as the plans\r\nby which the Federal party, under Hamilton's leadership, proposed to\r\ndevelop the national features of the Constitution became evident, the\r\nlatent State feeling took fire. Its first symptom was the adoption\r\nof the name Republican by the new opposition party which took form in\r\n1792-3 under Jefferson's leadership. Up to this time the States had been\r\nthe only means through which Americans had known any thing of republican\r\ngovernment; they had had no share in the government of the mother\r\ncountry in colonial times, and no efficient national government to take\r\npart in under the Articles of Confederation. The claim of an exclusive\r\ntitle to the name of Republican does not seem to have been fundamentally\r\nan implication of monarchical tendencies against the Federalists so much\r\nas an implication that they were hostile to the States, the familiar\r\nexponents of republican government. When the Federalist majority in\r\nCongress forced through, in the war excitement against France in 1798,\r\nthe Alien and Sedition laws, which practically empowered the President\r\nto suppress all party criticism of and opposition to the dominant party,\r\nthe Legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia, in 1798-9, passed series of\r\nresolutions, prepared by Jefferson and Madison respectively, which for\r\nthe first time asserted in plain terms the sovereignty of the\r\nStates. The two sets of resolutions agreed in the assertion that the\r\nConstitution was a \"compact,\" and that the States were the \"parties\"\r\nwhich had formed it. In these two propositions lies the gist of State\r\nsovereignty, of which all its remotest consequences are only natural\r\ndevelopments. If it were true that the States, of their sovereign will,\r\nhad formed such a compact; if it were not true that the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution was a mere alteration of the form of a political state\r\nalready in existence; it would follow, as the Kentucky resolutions\r\nasserted, that each State had the exclusive right to decide for itself\r\nwhen the compact had been broken, and the mode and measure of redress.\r\nIt followed, also, that, if the existence and force of the Constitution\r\nin a State were due solely to the sovereign will of the State, the\r\nsovereign will of the State was competent, on occasion, to oust the\r\nConstitution from the jurisdiction covered by the State. In brief, the\r\nUnion was wholly voluntary in its formation and in its continuance; and\r\neach State reserved the unquestionable right to secede, to abandon the\r\nUnion, and assume an independent existence whenever due reason, in\r\nthe exclusive judgment of the State, should arise. These latter\r\nconsequences, not stated in the Kentucky resolutions, and apparently not\r\ncontemplated by the Virginia resolutions, were put into complete form by\r\nProfessor Tucker, of the University of Virginia, in 1803, in the notes\r\nto his edition of \"Blackstone's Commentaries.\" Thereafter its statements\r\nof American constitutional law controlled the political training of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nMadison held a modification of the State sovereignty theory, which has\r\ncounted among its adherents the mass of the ability and influence\r\nof American authorities on constitutional law. Holding that the\r\nConstitution was a compact, and that the States were the parties to it,\r\nhe held that one of the conditions of the compact was the abandonment\r\nof State sovereignty; that the States were sovereign until 1787-8, but\r\nthereafter only members of a political state, the United States. This\r\nseems to have been the ground taken by Webster, in his debates with\r\nHayne and Calhoun. It was supported by the instances in which the\r\nappearance of a sovereignty in each State was yielded in the fourteen\r\nyears before 1787; but, unfortunately for the theory, Calhoun was able\r\nto produce instances exactly parallel after 1787. If the fact that each\r\nState predicated its own sovereignty as an essential part of the steps\r\npreliminary to the convention of 1787 be a sound argument for State\r\nsovereignty before 1787, the fact that each State predicated its\r\nsovereignty as an essential part of the ratification of the Constitution\r\nmust be taken as an equally sound argument for State sovereignty under\r\nthe Constitution; and it seems difficult, on the Madison theory, to\r\nresist Calhoun's triumphant conclusion that, if the States went into the\r\nconvention as sovereign States, they came out of it as sovereign States,\r\nwith, of course, the right of secession. Calhoun himself had a sincere\r\ndesire to avoid the exercise of the right of secession, and it was as a\r\nsubstitute for it that he evolved his doctrine of nullification,\r\nwhich has been placed in the first volume. When it failed in 1833, the\r\nexercise of the right of secession was the only remaining remedy for an\r\nasserted breach of State sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe events which led up to the success of the Republican party in\r\nelecting Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency in 1860 are so intimately\r\nconnected with the anti-slavery struggle that they have been placed in\r\nthe preceding volume. They culminated in the first organized attempt to\r\nput the right of secession to a practical test. The election of\r\nLincoln, the success of a \"sectional party,\" and the evasion of the\r\nfugitive-slave law through the passage of \"personal-liberty laws\" by\r\nmany of the Northern States, are the leading reasons assigned by South\r\nCarolina for her secession in 1860. These were intelligible reasons, and\r\nwere the ones most commonly used to influence the popular vote. But all\r\nthe evidence goes to show that the leaders of secession were not so\r\nweak in judgment as to run the hazards of war by reason of \"injuries\"\r\nso minute as these. Their apprehensions were far broader, if less\r\ncalculated to influence a popular vote. In 1789 the proportions of\r\npopulation and wealth in the two sections were very nearly equal. The\r\nslave system of labor had hung as a clog upon the progress of the South,\r\npreventing the natural development of manufactures and commerce, and\r\nshutting out immigration. As the numerical disproportion between the two\r\nsections increased, Southern leaders ceased to attempt to control the\r\nHouse of Representatives, contenting themselves with balancing new\r\nNorthern with new Southern States, so as to keep an equal vote in the\r\nSenate. Since 1845 this resource had failed. Five free States, Iowa,\r\nWisconsin, California, Minnesota, and Oregon, had been admitted, with no\r\nnew slave States; Kansas was calling almost imperatively for admission;\r\nand there was no hope of another slave State in future. When the\r\nelection of 1860 demonstrated that the progress of the antislavery\r\nstruggle had united all the free States, it was evident that it was but\r\na question of time when the Republican party would control both\r\nbranches of Congress and the Presidency, and have the power to make laws\r\naccording to its own interpretation of the constitutional powers of the\r\nFederal Government.\r\n\r\nThe peril to slavery was not only the probable prohibition of the\r\ninter-State slave-trade, though this itself would have been an event\r\nwhich negro slavery in the South could hardly have long survived. The\r\nmore pressing danger lay in the results of such general Republican\r\nsuccess on the Supreme Court. The decision of that Court in the Dred\r\nScott case had fully sustained every point of the extreme Southern\r\nclaims as to the status of slavery in the Territories; it had held that\r\nslaves were property in the view of the Constitution; that Congress\r\nwas bound to protect slave-holders in this property right in the\r\nTerritories, and, still more, bound not to prohibit slavery or allow a\r\nTerritorial Legislature to prohibit slavery in the Territories, and\r\nthat the Missouri compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional and void.\r\nThe Southern Democrats entered the election of 1860 with this distinct\r\ndecision of the highest judicial body of the country to back them. The\r\nRepublican party had refused to admit that the decision of the Dred\r\nScott case was law or binding. Given a Republican majority in both\r\nHouses and a Republican President, there was nothing to hinder the\r\npassage of a law increasing the number of Supreme Court justices to any\r\ndesired extent, and the new appointments would certainly be of such\r\na nature as to make the reversal of the Dred Scott decision an easy\r\nmatter. The election of 1860 had brought only a Republican President;\r\nthe majority in both Houses was to be against him until 1863 at least.\r\nBut the drift in the North and West was too plain to be mistaken, and it\r\nwas felt that 1860--would be the last opportunity for the Gulf States\r\nto secede with dignity and with the prestige of the Supreme Court's\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nFinally, there seems to have been a strong feeling among the extreme\r\nsecessionists, who loved the right of secession for its own sake, that\r\nthe accelerating increase in the relative power of the North would soon\r\nmake secession, on any grounds, impossible. Unless the right was to be\r\nforfeited by non-user, it must be established by practical exercise, and\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nUntil about 1825-9 Presidential electors were chosen in most of the\r\nStates by the Legislature. After that period the old practice was kept\r\nup only in South Carolina. On election day of November, 1860, the\r\nSouth Carolina Legislature was in session for the purpose of choosing\r\nelectors, but it continued its session after this duty was performed. As\r\nsoon as Lincoln's election was assured, the Legislature called a State\r\nConvention for Dec. 17th, took the preliminary steps toward putting the\r\nState on a war footing, and adjourned. The convention met at the State\r\ncapital, adjourned to Charleston, and here, Dec. 20, 1860, passed\r\nunanimously an Ordinance of Secession. By its terms the people of South\r\nCarolina, in convention assembled, repealed the ordinance of May 23,\r\n1788, by which the Constitution had been ratified, and all Acts of the\r\nLegislature ratifying amendments to the Constitution, and declared the\r\nunion between the State and other States, under the name of the United\r\nStates of America, to be dissolved. By a similar process, similar\r\nordinances were adopted by the State Conventions of Mississippi (Jan.\r\n9th), Florida (Jan. 10th), Alabama (Jan. 11th), Georgia (Jan. 19th),\r\nLouisiana (Jan. 25th), and Texas (Feb. 1st),--seven States in all.\r\n\r\nOutside of South Carolina, the struggle in the States named turned on\r\nthe calling of the convention; and in this matter the opposition was\r\nunexpectedly strong. We have the testimony of Alexander H. Stephens that\r\nthe argument most effective in overcoming the opposition to the calling\r\nof a convention was: \"We can make better terms out of the Union than in\r\nit.\" The necessary implication was that secession was not to be final;\r\nthat it was only to be a temporary withdrawal until terms of compromise\r\nand security for the fugitive-slave law and for slavery in the\r\nTerritories could be extorted from the North and West. The argument soon\r\nproved to be an intentional sham.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a difference between the theory of the State\r\nConvention at the North and at the South. At the North, barring a few\r\nvery exceptional cases, the rule has been that no action of a State\r\nConvention is valid until confirmed by popular vote. At the South, in\r\nobedience to the strictest application of State sovereignty, the action\r\nof the State Convention was held to be the voice of the people of the\r\nState, which needed no popular ratification. There was, therefore,\r\nno remedy when the State Conventions, after passing the ordinances of\r\nsecession, went on to appoint delegates to a Confederate Congress, which\r\nmet at Montgomery, Feb. 4, 1861, adopted a provisional constitution\r\nFeb. 8th, and elected a President and Vice-President Feb. 9th. The\r\nconventions ratified the provisional constitution and adjourned, their\r\nreal object having been completely accomplished; and the people of\r\nthe several seceding States, by the action of their omnipotent State\r\nConventions, and without their having a word to say about it, found\r\nthemselves under a new government, totally irreconcilable with the\r\njurisdiction of the United States, and necessarily hostile to it. The\r\nonly exception was Texas, whose State Convention had been called in\r\na method so utterly revolutionary that it was felt to be necessary to\r\ncondone its defects by a popular vote.\r\n\r\nNo declaration had ever been made by any authority that the erection of\r\nsuch hostile power within the national boundaries of the United\r\nStates would be followed by war; such a declaration would hardly seem\r\nnecessary. The recognition of the original national boundaries of\r\nthe United States had been extorted from Great Britain by successful\r\nwarfare. They had been extended by purchase from France and Spain in\r\n1803 and 1819, and again by war from Mexico in 1848. The United States\r\nstood ready to guarantee their integrity by war against all the rest of\r\nthe world; was an ordinance of South Carolina, or the election of a _de\r\nfacto_ government within Southern borders, likely to receive different\r\ntreatment than was given British troops at Bunker Hill, or Santa Anna's\r\nlancers at Buena Vista? Men forgot that the national boundaries had been\r\nso drawn as to include Vermont before Vermont's admission and without\r\nVermont's consent; that unofficial propositions to divide Rhode Island\r\nbetween Connecticut and Massachusetts, to embargo commerce with North\r\nCarolina, and demand her share of the Confederation debt, had in 1789-90\r\nbeen a sufficient indication that it was easier for a State to get into\r\nthe American Union than to get out of it. It was a fact, nevertheless,\r\nthat the national power to enforce the integrity of the Union had never\r\nbeen formally declared; and the mass of men in the South, even though\r\nthey denied the expediency, did not deny the right of secession, or\r\nacknowledge the right of coercion by the Federal Government. To reach\r\nthe original area of secession with land-forces, it was necessary for\r\nthe Federal Government to cross the Border States, whose people in\r\ngeneral were no believers in the right of coercion. The first attempt\r\nto do so extended the secession movement by methods which were far more\r\nopenly revolutionary than the original secessions. North Carolina and\r\nArkansas seceded in orthodox fashion as soon as President Lincoln called\r\nfor volunteers after the capture of Fort Sumter. The State governments\r\nof Virginia and Tennessee concluded \"military leagues\" with the\r\nConfederacy, allowed Confederate troops to take possession of their\r\nStates, and then submitted an ordinance of secession to the form of\r\na popular vote. The State officers of Missouri were chased out of the\r\nState before they could do more than begin this process. In Maryland,\r\nthe State government arrayed itself successfully against secession.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the representative opinions for this period, all the\r\nmarked shades of opinion have been respected, both the Union and the\r\nanti-coercion sentiment of the Border States, the extreme secession\r\nspirit of the Gulf States, and, from the North, the moderate and the\r\nextreme Republican, and the orthodox Democratic, views. The feeling of\r\nthe so-called \"peace Democrats\" of the North differed so little from\r\nthose of Toombs or Iverson that it has not seemed advisable to do more\r\nthan refer to Vallandigham's speech in opposition to the war, under the\r\nnext period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN PARKER HALE,\r\n\r\nOF NEW HAMPSHIRE (BORN 1806, DIED 1873.)\r\n\r\nON SECESSION; MODERATE REPUBLICAN OPINION;\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, DECEMBER 5, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nI was very much in hopes when the message was presented that it would be\r\na document which would commend itself cordially to somebody. I was not\r\nso sanguine about its pleasing myself, but I was in hopes that it would\r\nbe one thing or another. I was in hopes that the President would have\r\nlooked in the face the crisis in which he says the country is, and that\r\nhis message would be either one thing or another. But, sir, I have read\r\nit somewhat carefully. I listened to it as it was read at the desk; and,\r\nif I understand it--and I think I do--it is this: South Carolina has\r\njust cause for seceding from the Union; that is the first proposition.\r\nThe second is, that she has no right to secede. The third is, that we\r\nhave no right to prevent her from seceding. That is the President's\r\nmessage, substantially. He goes on to represent this as a great and\r\npowerful country, and that no State has a right to secede from it; but\r\nthe power of the country, if I understand the President, consists in\r\nwhat Dickens makes the English constitution to be--a power to do nothing\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I think it was incumbent upon the President of the United\r\nStates to point out definitely and recommend to Congress some rule\r\nof action, and to tell us what he recommended us to do. But, in my\r\njudgment, he has entirely avoided it. He has failed to look the thing\r\nin the face. He has acted like the ostrich, which hides her head and\r\nthereby thinks to escape danger. Sir, the only way to escape danger\r\nis to look it in the face. I think the country did expect from the\r\nPresident some exposition of a decided policy; and I confess that,\r\nfor one, I was rather indifferent as to what that policy was that he\r\nrecommended; but I hoped that it would be something; that it would be\r\ndecisive. He has utterly failed in that respect.\r\n\r\nI think we may as well look this matter right clearly in the face; and\r\nI am not going to be long about doing it. I think that this state of\r\naffairs looks to one of two things: it looks to absolute submission, not\r\non the part of our Southern friends and the Southern States, but of the\r\nNorth, to the abandonment of their position,--it looks to a surrender\r\nof that popular sentiment which has been uttered through the constituted\r\nforms of the ballot-box, or it looks to open war. We need not shut our\r\neyes to the fact. It means war, and it means nothing else; and the State\r\nwhich has put herself in the attitude of secession, so looks upon it.\r\nShe has asked no council, she has considered it as a settled question,\r\nand she has armed herself. As I understand the aspect of affairs,\r\nit looks to that, and it looks to nothing else except unconditional\r\nsubmission on the part of the majority. I did not read the paper--I do\r\nnot read many papers--but I understand that there was a remedy suggested\r\nin a paper printed, I think, in this city, and it was that the President\r\nand the Vice-President should be inaugurated (that would be a great\r\nconcession!) and then, being inaugurated, they should quietly resign!\r\nWell, sir, I am not entirely certain that that would settle the\r\nquestion. I think that after the President and Vice-President-elect had\r\nresigned, there would be as much difficulty in settling who was to take\r\ntheir places as there was in settling it before.\r\n\r\nI do not wish, sir, to say a word that shall increase any irritation;\r\nthat shall add any feeling of bitterness to the state of things which\r\nreally exists in the country, and I would bear and forbear before I\r\nwould say any thing which would add to this bitterness. But I tell you,\r\nsir, the plain, true way is to look this thing in the face--see where we\r\nare. And I avow here--I do not know whether or not I shall be sustained\r\nby those who usually act with me--if the issue which is presented is\r\nthat the constitutional will of the public opinion of this country,\r\nexpressed through the forms of the Constitution, will not be submitted\r\nto, and war is the alternative, let it come in any form or in any shape.\r\nThe Union is dissolved and it cannot be held together as a Union, if\r\nthat is the alternative upon which we go into an election. If it is\r\npre-announced and determined that the voice of the majority, expressed\r\nthrough the regular and constituted forms of the Constitution, will not\r\nbe submitted to, then, sir, this is not a Union of equals; it is a Union\r\nof a dictatorial oligarchy on one side, and a herd of slaves and cowards\r\non the other. That is it, sir; nothing more, nothing less. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED IVERSON,\r\n\r\nOF GEORGIA. (BORN 1798, DIED 1874.)\r\n\r\nON SECESSION; SECESSIONIST OPINION;\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, DECEMBER 5, 1860\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not rise, Mr. President, for the purpose of entering,at any length\r\ninto this discussion, or to defend the President's message, which\r\nhas been attacked by the Senator from New Hampshire.* I am not the\r\nmouth-piece of the President. While I do not agree with some portions\r\nof the message, and some of the positions that have been taken by the\r\nPresident, I do not perceive all the inconsistencies in that document\r\nwhich the Senator from New Hampshire has thought proper to present.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the President denies the constitutional right of a\r\nState to secede from the Union; while, at the same time, he also states\r\nthat this Federal Government has no constitutional right to enforce or\r\nto coerce a State back into the Union which may take upon itself the\r\nresponsibility of secession. I do not see any inconsistency in that.\r\nThe President may be right when he asserts the fact that no State has a\r\nconstitutional right to secede from the Union. I do not myself place the\r\nright of a State to secede from the Union upon constitutional grounds. I\r\nadmit that the Constitution has not granted that power to a State. It is\r\nexceedingly doubtful even whether the right has been reserved. Certainly\r\nit has not been reserved in express terms. I therefore do not place\r\nthe expected action of any of the Southern States, in the present\r\ncontingency, upon the constitutional right of secession; and I am not\r\nprepared to dispute therefore, the, position which the President has\r\ntaken upon that point.\r\n\r\nI rather agree with the President that the secession of a State is\r\nan act of revolution taken through that particular means or by that\r\nparticular measure. It withdraws from the Federal compact, disclaims any\r\nfurther allegiance to it, and sets itself up as a separate government,\r\nan independent State. The State does it at its peril, of course, because\r\nit may or may not be cause of war by the remaining States composing the\r\nFederal Government. If they think proper to consider it such an act\r\nof disobedience, or if they consider that the policy of the Federal\r\nGovernment be such that it cannot submit to this dismemberment, why then\r\nthey may or may not make war if they choose upon the seceding States. It\r\nwill be a question of course for the Federal Government or the remaining\r\nStates to decide for themselves, whether they will permit a State to\r\ngo out of the Union, and remain as a separate and independent State, or\r\nwhether they will attempt to force her back at the point of the bayonet.\r\nThat is a question, I presume, of policy and expediency, which will be\r\nconsidered by the remaining States composing the Federal Government,\r\nthrough their organ, the Federal Government, whenever the contingency\r\narises.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, while a State has no power, under the Constitution, conferred\r\nupon it to secede from the Federal Government or from the Union, each\r\nState has the right of revolution, which all admit. Whenever the burdens\r\nof the government under which it acts become so onerous that it cannot\r\nbear them, or if anticipated evil shall be so great that the\r\nState believes it would be better off--even risking the perils of\r\nsecession--out of the Union than in it, then that State, in my\r\nopinion, like all people upon earth has the right to exercise the\r\ngreat fundamental principle of self-preservation, and go out of the\r\nUnion--though, of course, at its own peril--and bear the risk of the\r\nconsequences. And while no State may have the constitutional right to\r\nsecede from the Union, the President may not be wrong when he says the\r\nFederal Government has no power under the Constitution to compel the\r\nState to come back into the Union. It may be a _casus omissus_ in the\r\nConstitution; but I should like to know where the power exists in the\r\nConstitution of the United States to authorize the Federal Government\r\nto coerce a sovereign State. It does not exist in terms, at any rate, in\r\nthe Constitution. I do not think there is any inconsistency, therefore,\r\nbetween the two positions of the President in the message upon these\r\nparticular points.\r\n\r\nThe only fault I have to find with the message of the President, is the\r\ninconsistency of another portion. He declares that, as the States have\r\nno power to secede, the Federal Government is in fact a consolidated\r\ngovernment; that it is not a voluntary association of States. I deny it.\r\nIt was a voluntary association of States. No State was ever forced to\r\ncome into the Federal Union. Every State came voluntarily into it.\r\nIt was an association, a voluntary association of States; and the\r\nPresident's position that it is not a voluntary association is, in my\r\nopinion, altogether wrong.\r\n\r\nBut whether that be so or not, the President declares and assumes that\r\nthis government is a consolidated government to this extent: that all\r\nthe laws of the Federal Government are to operate directly upon each\r\nindividual of the States, if not upon the States themselves, and must\r\nbe enforced; and yet, at the same time, he says that the State which\r\nsecedes is not to be coerced. He says that the laws of the United States\r\nmust be enforced against every individual of a State.\r\n\r\nOf course, the State is composed of individuals within its limits,\r\nand if you enforce the laws and obligations of the Federal Government\r\nagainst each and every individual of the State, you enforce them against\r\na State. While, therefore, he says that a State is not to be coerced, he\r\ndeclares, in the same breath, his determination to enforce the laws of\r\nthe Union, and therefore to coerce the State if a State goes out. There\r\nis the inconsistency, according to my idea, which I do not see how the\r\nPresident or anybody else can reconcile. That the Federal Government is\r\nto enforce its laws over the seceding State, and yet not coerce her into\r\nobedience, is to me incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nBut I did not rise, Mr. President, to discuss these questions in\r\nrelation to the message; I rose in behalf of the State that I represent,\r\nas well as other Southern States that are engaged in this movement, to\r\naccept the issue which the Senator from New Hampshire has seen fit to\r\ntender--that is, of war. Sir, the Southern States now moving in this\r\nmatter are not doing it without due consideration. We have looked over\r\nthe whole field. We believe that the only security for the institution\r\nto which we attach so much importance is secession and a Southern\r\nconfederacy. We are satisfied, notwithstanding the disclaimers upon the\r\npart of the Black Republicans to the contrary, that they intend to\r\nuse the Federal power, when they get possession of it, to put down and\r\nextinguish the institution of slavery in the Southern States. I do not\r\nintend to enter upon the discussion of that point. That, however, is\r\nmy opinion. It is the opinion of a large majority of those with whom I\r\nassociate at home, and I believe of the Southern people. Believing that\r\nthis is the intention and object, the ultimate aim and design, of the\r\nRepublican party, the Abolitionists of the North, we do not intend to\r\nstay in this Union until we shall become so weak that we shall not be\r\nable to resist when the time comes for resistance. Our true policy is\r\nthe one which we have made up our minds to follow. Our true policy is to\r\ngo out of this Union now, while we have strength to resist any attempt\r\non the part of the Federal Government to coerce us. * * *\r\n\r\nWe intend, Mr. President, to go out peaceably if we can, forcibly if we\r\nmust; but I do not believe, with the Senator from New Hampshire, that\r\nthere is going to be any war. If five or eight States go out, they will\r\nnecessarily draw all the other Southern States after them. That is a\r\nconsequence that nothing can prevent. If five or eight States go out\r\nof this Union, I should like to see the man that would propose a\r\ndeclaration of war against them, or attempt to force them into obedience\r\nto the Federal Government at the point of the bayonet or the sword.\r\n\r\nSir, there has been a good deal of vaporing on this subject. A great\r\nmany threats have been thrown out. I have heard them on this floor, and\r\nupon the floor of the other House of Congress; but I have also perceived\r\nthis: they come from those who would be the very last men to attempt\r\nto put their threats into execution. Men talk sometimes about their\r\neighteen million who are to whip us; and yet we have heard of cases in\r\nwhich just such men had suffered themselves to be switched in the\r\nface, and trembled like sheep-stealing dogs, expecting to be shot every\r\nminute. These threats generally come from men who would be the last to\r\nexecute them. Some of these Northern editors talk about whipping the\r\nSouthern States like spaniels. Brave words; but I venture to assert none\r\nof those men would ever volunteer to command an army to be sent down\r\nSouth to coerce us into obedience to Federal power. * * *\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I apprehend that when we go out and form our confederacy--as\r\nI think and hope we shall do very shortly--the Northern States, or the\r\nFederal Government, will see its true policy to be to let us go in peace\r\nand make treaties of commerce and amity with us, from which they will\r\nderive more advantages than from any attempt to coerce us. They cannot\r\nsucceed in coercing us. If they allow us to form our government without\r\ndifficulty, we shall be very willing to look upon them as a favored\r\nnation and give them all the advantages of commercial and amicable\r\ntreaties. I have no doubt that both of us--certainly the Southern\r\nStates--would live better, more happily, more prosperously, and with\r\ngreater friendship, than we live now in this Union.\r\n\r\nSir, disguise the fact as you will, there is an enmity between the\r\nNorthern and Southern people that is deep and enduring, and you never\r\ncan eradicate it--never! Look at the spectacle exhibited on this floor.\r\nHow is it? There are the Republican Northern Senators upon that side.\r\nHere are the Southern Senators on this side. How much social intercourse\r\nis there between us? You sit upon your side, silent and gloomy; we sit\r\nupon ours with knit brows and portentous scowls. Yesterday I observed\r\nthat there was not a solitary man on that side of the Chamber came over\r\nhere even to extend the civilities and courtesies of life; nor did any\r\nof us go over there. Here are two hostile bodies on this floor; and it\r\nis but a type of the feeling that exists between the two sections. We\r\nare enemies as much as if we were hostile States. I believe that the\r\nNorthern people hate the South worse than ever the English people hated\r\nFrance; and I can tell my brethren over there that there is no love lost\r\nupon the part of the South.\r\n\r\nIn this state of feeling, divided as we are by interest, by a\r\ngeographical feeling, by every thing that makes two people separate and\r\ndistinct, I ask why we should remain in the same Union together? We have\r\nnot lived in peace; we are not now living in peace. It is not expected\r\nor hoped that we shall ever live in peace. My doctrine is that whenever\r\neven man and wife find that they must quarrel, and cannot live in\r\npeace, they ought to separate; and these two sections--the North and\r\nSouth--manifesting, as they have done and do now, and probably will ever\r\nmanifest, feelings of hostility, separated as they are in interests and\r\nobjects, my own opinion is they can never live in peace; and the sooner\r\nthey separate the better.\r\n\r\nSir, these sentiments I have thrown out crudely I confess, and upon the\r\nspur of the occasion. I should not have opened my mouth but that the\r\nSenator from New Hampshire seemed to show a spirit of bravado, as if\r\nhe intended to alarm and scare the Southern States into a retreat from\r\ntheir movements. He says that war is to come, and you had better take\r\ncare, therefore. That is the purport of his language; of course those\r\nare not his words; but I understand him very well, and everybody else,\r\nI apprehend, understands him that war is threatened, and therefore the\r\nSouth had better look out. Sir, I do not believe that there will be any\r\nwar; but if war is to come, let it come. We will meet the Senator\r\nfrom New Hampshire and all the myrmidons of Abolitionism and Black\r\nRepublicanism everywhere, upon our own soil; and in the language of a\r\ndistinguished member from Ohio in relation to the Mexican War, we will\r\n\"welcome you with bloody hands to hospitable graves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN WADE,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO, (BORN 1800, DIED 1878.)\r\n\r\nON SECESSION, AND THE STATE OF THE UNION; REPUBLICAN OPINION;\r\n\r\nSENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, DECEMBER 17, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nAt a time like this, when there seems to be a wild and unreasoning\r\nexcitement in many parts of the country, I certainly have very little\r\nfaith in the efficacy of any argument that may be made; but at the\r\nsame time, I must say, when I hear it stated by many Senators in this\r\nChamber, where we all raised our hands to Heaven, and took a solemn oath\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States, that we are on the\r\neve of a dissolution of this Union, and that the Constitution is to be\r\ntrampled under foot--silence under such circumstances seems to me akin\r\nto treason itself.\r\n\r\nI have listened to the complaints on the other side patiently, and with\r\nan ardent desire to ascertain what was the particular difficulty under\r\nwhich they were laboring. Many of those who have supposed themselves\r\naggrieved have spoken; but I confess that I am now totally unable to\r\nunderstand precisely what it is of which they complain. Why, sir, the\r\nparty which lately elected their President, and are prospectively to\r\ncome into power, have never held an executive office under the General\r\nGovernment, nor has any individual of them. It is most manifest,\r\ntherefore, that the party to which I belong have as yet committed no act\r\nof which anybody can complain. If they have fears as to the course that\r\nwe may hereafter pursue, they are mere apprehensions--a bare suspicion;\r\narising, I fear, out of their unwarrantable prejudices, and nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nI wish to ascertain at the outset whether we are right; for I tell\r\ngentlemen that, if they can convince me that I am holding any political\r\nprinciple that is not warranted by the Constitution under which we live,\r\nor that trenches upon their rights, they need not ask me to compromise\r\nit. I will be ever ready to grant redress, and to right myself whenever\r\nI am wrong. No man need approach me with a threat that the Government\r\nunder which I live is to be destroyed; because I hope I have now, and\r\never shall have, such a sense of justice that, when any man shows\r\nme that I am wrong, I shall be ready to right it without price or\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, what is it of which gentlemen complain? When I left my home in\r\nthe West to come to this place, all was calm, cheerful, and contented.\r\nI heard of no discontent. I apprehended that there was nothing to\r\ninterrupt the harmonious course of our legislation. I did not learn\r\nthat, since we adjourned from this place at the end of the last session,\r\nthere had been any new fact intervening that should at all disturb the\r\npublic mind. I do not know that there has been any encroachment upon\r\nthe rights of any section of the country since that time; I came here,\r\ntherefore, expecting to have a very harmonious session. It is very true,\r\nsir, that the great Republican party which has been organized ever since\r\nyou repealed the Missouri Compromise, and who gave you, four years ago,\r\nfull warning that their growing strength would probably result as it\r\nhas resulted, have carried the late election; but I did not suppose that\r\nwould disturb the equanimity of this body. I did suppose that every man\r\nwho was observant of the signs of the times might well see that things\r\nwould result as they have resulted. Nor do I understand now that\r\nanything growing out of that election is the cause of the present\r\nexcitement that pervades the country.\r\n\r\nWhy, Mr. President, this is a most singular state of things. Who is it\r\nthat is complaining? They that have been in a minority? They that have\r\nbeen the subjects of an oppressive and aggressive Government? No, sir.\r\nLet us suppose that when the leaders of the old glorious Revolution met\r\nat Philadelphia eighty-four years ago to draw up a bill of indictment\r\nagainst a wicked King and his ministers, they had been at a loss what\r\nthey should set forth as the causes of their complaint. They had\r\nno difficulty in setting them forth so that the great article of\r\nimpeachment will go down to all posterity as a full justification of all\r\nthe acts they did. But let us suppose that, instead of its being these\r\nold patriots who had met there to dissolve their connection with the\r\nBritish Government, and to trample their flag under foot, it had\r\nbeen the ministers of the Crown, the leading members of the British\r\nParliament, of the dominant party that had ruled Great Britain for\r\nthirty years previous: who would not have branded every man of them as a\r\ntraitor? It would be said: \"You who have had the Government in your own\r\nhands: you who have been the ministers of the Crown, advising everything\r\nthat has been done, set up here that you have been oppressed and\r\naggrieved by the action of that very Government which you have directed\r\nyourselves.\" Instead of a sublime revolution, the uprising of an\r\noppressed people, ready to battle against unequal power for their\r\nrights, it would have been an act of treason.\r\n\r\nHow is it with the leaders of this modern revolution? Are they in a\r\nposition to complain of the action of this Government for years past?\r\nWhy, sir, they have had more than two-thirds of the Senate for many\r\nyears past, and until very recently, and have almost that now. You--who\r\ncomplain, I ought to say--represent but a little more than one-fourth of\r\nthe free people of these United States, and yet your counsels prevail,\r\nand have prevailed all along for at least ten years past. In the\r\nCabinet, in the Senate of the United States, in the Supreme Court, in\r\nevery department of the Government, your officers, or those devoted to\r\nyou, have been in the majority, and have dictated all the policies of\r\nthis Government. Is it not strange, sir, that they who now occupy these\r\npositions should come here and complain that their rights are stricken\r\ndown by the action of the Government?\r\n\r\nBut what has caused this great excitement that undoubtedly prevails in a\r\nportion of our country? If the newspapers are to be credited, there is\r\na reign of terror in all the cities and large towns in the southern\r\nportion of this community that looks very much like the reign of terror\r\nin Paris during the French revolution. There are acts of violence that\r\nwe read of almost every day, wherein the rights of northern men are\r\nstricken down, where they are sent back with indignities, where they are\r\nscourged, tarred, feathered, and murdered, and no inquiry made as to\r\nthe cause. I do not suppose that the regular Government, in times of\r\nexcitement like these, is really responsible for such acts. I know that\r\nthese outbreaks of passion, these terrible excitements that sometimes\r\npervade the community, are entirely irrepressible by the law of the\r\ncountry. I suppose that is the case now; because if these outrages\r\nagainst northern citizens were really authorized by the State\r\nauthorities there, were they a foreign Government, everybody knows, if\r\nit were the strongest Government on earth, we should declare war upon\r\nher in one day.\r\n\r\nBut what has caused this great excitement? Sir, I will tell you what I\r\nsuppose it is. I do not (and I say it frankly) so much blame the people\r\nof the South; because they believe, and they are led to believe by all\r\nthe information that ever comes before them, that we, the dominant party\r\nto-day, who have just seized upon the reins of this Government, are\r\ntheir mortal enemies, and stand ready to trample their institutions\r\nunder foot. They have been told so by our enemies at the North. Their\r\nmisfortune, or their fault, is that they have lent a too easy ear to the\r\ninsinuations of those who are our mortal enemies, while they would not\r\nhear us.\r\n\r\nNow I wish to inquire, in the first place, honestly, candidly, and\r\nfairly, whether the Southern gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber\r\nthat complain so much, have any reasonable grounds for that complaint--I\r\nmean when they are really informed as to our position.\r\n\r\nNorthern Democrats have sometimes said that we had personal liberty\r\nbills in some few of the States of the North, which somehow trenched\r\nupon the rights of the South under the fugitive bill to recapture their\r\nrunaway slaves; a position that in not more than two or three cases,\r\nso far as I can see, has the slightest foundation in fact; and even if\r\nthose where it is most complained of, if the provisions of their law are\r\nreally repugnant to that of the United States, they are utterly void,\r\nand the courts would declare them so the moment you brought them up.\r\nThus it is that I am glad to hear the candor of those gentlemen on the\r\nother side, that they do not complain of these laws. The Senator from\r\nGeorgia (Mr. Iverson) himself told us that they had never suffered any\r\ninjury, to his knowledge and belief, from those bills, and they cared\r\nnothing about them. The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Mason) said the same\r\nthing; and, I believe, the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Brown).\r\nYou all, then, have given up this bone of contention, this matter of\r\ncomplaint which Northern men have set forth as a grievance more than\r\nanybody else.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason. Will the Senator indulge me one moment.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason. I know he does not intend to misrepresent me or other\r\ngentlemen. What I said was, that the repeal of those laws would furnish\r\nno cause of satisfaction to the Southern States. Our opinions of those\r\nlaws we gave freely. We said the repeal of those laws would give no\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade. Mr. President, I do not intend to misrepresent anything. I\r\nunderstood those gentlemen to suppose that they had not been injured by\r\nthem. I understood the Senator from Virginia to believe that they were\r\nenacted in a spirit of hostility to the institutions of the South, and\r\nto object to them not because the acts themselves had done them any\r\nhurt, but because they were really a stamp of degradation upon Southern\r\nmen, or something like that--I do not quote his words. The other\r\nSenators that referred to it probably intended to be understood in the\r\nsame way; but they did acquit these laws of having done them injury to\r\ntheir knowledge or belief.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that these laws were, as the Senator supposed, enacted\r\nwith a view to exasperate the South, or to put them in a position of\r\ndegradation. Why, sir, these laws against kidnapping are as old as the\r\ncommon law itself, as that Senator well knows. To take a freeman and\r\nforcibly carry him out of the jurisdiction of the State, has ever been,\r\nby all civilized countries, adjudged to be a great crime; and in most of\r\nthem, wherever I have understood anything about it, they have penal\r\nlaws to punish such an offence. I believe the State of Virginia has one\r\nto-day as stringent in all its provisions as almost any other of which\r\nyou complain. I have not looked over the statute-books of the South; but\r\nI do not doubt that there will be found this species of legislation upon\r\nall your statute-books.\r\n\r\nHere let me say, because the subject occurs to me right here, the\r\nSenator from Virginia seemed not so much to point out any specific acts\r\nthat Northern people had done injurious to your property as, what he\r\ntook to be a dishonor and a degradation. I think I feel as sensitive\r\nupon that subject as any other man. If I know myself, I am the last man\r\nthat would be the advocate of any law or any act that would humiliate or\r\ndishonor any section of this country, or any individual in it; and, on\r\nthe other hand, let me tell these gentlemen I am exceedingly sensitive\r\nupon that same point, whatever they may think about it. I would\r\nrather sustain an injury than an insult or dishonor; and I would be\r\nas unwilling to inflict it upon others as I would be to submit to it\r\nmyself. I never will do either the one or the other if I know it.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI know that charges have been made and rung in our ears, and reiterated\r\nover and over again, that we have been unfaithful in the execution of\r\nyour fugitive bill. Sir, that law is exceedingly odious to any free\r\npeople. It deprives us of all the old guarantees of liberty that the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race everywhere have considered sacred--more sacred than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. President, the gentleman says, if I understood him, that these\r\nfugitives might be turned over to the authorities of the State from\r\nwhence they came. That would be a very poor remedy for a free man in\r\nhumble circumstances who was taken under the provisions of this bill in\r\na summary way, to be carried--where? Where he came from? There is no law\r\nthat requires that he should be carried there. Sir, if he is a free man\r\nhe may be carried into the market-place anywhere in a slave State; and\r\nwhat chance has he, a poor, ignorant individual, and a stranger,\r\nof asserting any rights there, even if there were no prejudices or\r\npartialities against him? That would be mere mockery of justice and\r\nnothing else, and the Senator well knows it. Sir, I know that from the\r\nstringent, summary provisions of this bill, free men have been kidnapped\r\nand carried into captivity and sold into everlasting slavery. Will any\r\nman who has a regard to the sovereign rights of the State rise here and\r\ncomplain that a State shall not make a law to protect her own people\r\nagainst kidnapping and violent seizures from abroad? Of all men, I\r\nbelieve those who have made most of these complaints should be the\r\nlast to rise and deny the power of a sovereign State to protect her own\r\ncitizens against any Federal legislation whatever. These liberty bills,\r\nin my judgment, have been passed, not with a view of degrading the\r\nSouth, but with an honest purpose of guarding the rights of their own\r\ncitizens from unlawful seizures and abductions. I was exceedingly glad\r\nto hear that the Senators on the other side had arisen in their places\r\nand had said that the repeal of those laws would not relieve the case\r\nfrom the difficulties under which they now labor.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it will be very well for us all to take a view of all the\r\nphases of this controversy before we come to such conclusions as seem to\r\nhave been arrived at in some quarters. I make the assertion here that I\r\ndo not believe, in the history of the world, there ever was a nation or\r\na people where a law repugnant to the general feeling was ever executed\r\nwith the same faithfulness as has been your most savage and atrocious\r\nfugitive bill in the North. You yourselves can scarcely point out any\r\ncase that has come before any northern tribunal in which the law has not\r\nbeen enforced to the very letter. You ought to know these facts, and you\r\ndo know them. You all know that when a law is passed anywhere to bind\r\nany people, who feel, in conscience, or for any other reason, opposed\r\nto its execution, it is not in human nature to enforce it with the same\r\ncertainty as a law that meets with the approbation of the great mass of\r\nthe citizens. Every rational man understands this, and every candid man\r\nwill admit it. Therefore it is that I do not violently impeach you for\r\nyour unfaithfulness in the execution of many of your laws. You have in\r\nSouth Carolina a law by which you take free citizens of Massachusetts\r\nor any other maritime State, who visit the city of Charleston, and lock\r\nthem up in jail under the penalty, if they cannot pay the jail-fees, of\r\neternal slavery staring them in the face--a monstrous law, revolting\r\nto the best feelings of humanity and violently in conflict with\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. I do not say this by way of\r\nrecrimination; for the excitement pervading the country is now so great\r\nthat I do not wish to add a single coal to the flame; but nevertheless I\r\nwish the whole truth to appear.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, I have shown, I think, that the dominant majority\r\nhere have nothing to complain of in the legislation of Congress, or in\r\nthe legislation of any of the States, or in the practice of the people\r\nof the North, under the fugitive slave bill, except so far as they say\r\ncertain State legislation furnishes some evidence of hostility to their\r\ninstitutions. And here, sir, I beg to make an observation. I tell the\r\nSenator, and I tell all the Senators, that the Republican party of the\r\nNorthern States, so far as I know, and of my own State in particular,\r\nhold the same opinions with regard to this peculiar institution of\r\nyours that are held by all the civilized nations of the world. We do not\r\ndiffer from the public sentiment of England, of France, of Germany, of\r\nItaly, and every other civilized nation on God's earth; and I tell you\r\nfrankly that you never found, and you never will find, a free community\r\nthat are in love with your peculiar institution. The Senator from Texas\r\n(Mr. Wigfall) told us the other day that cotton was king, and that by\r\nits influence it would govern all creation. He did not say so in words,\r\nbut that was the substance of his remark: that cotton was king, and that\r\nit had its subjects in Europe who dared not rebel against it. Here let\r\nme say to that Senator, in passing, that it turns out that they are\r\nvery rebellious subjects, and they are talking very disrespectfully at\r\npresent of that king that he spoke of. They defy you to exercise your\r\npower over them. They tell you that they sympathize in this controversy\r\nwith what you call the black Republicans. Therefore, I hope that, so\r\nfar as Europe is concerned at least, we shall hear no more of this boast\r\nthat cotton is king; and that he is going to rule all the civilized\r\nnations of the world, and bring them to his footstool. Sir, it will\r\nnever be done.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I wish to inquire whether the Southern people are injured by,\r\nor have any just right to complain of that platform of principles that\r\nwe put out, and on which we have elected a President and Vice-President.\r\nI have no concealments to make, and I shall talk to you, my Southern\r\nfriends, precisely as I would talk upon the stump on the subject. I tell\r\nyou that in that platform we did lay it down that we would, if we had\r\nthe power, prohibit slavery from another inch of free territory under\r\nthis Government. I stand on that position to-day. I have argued\r\nit probably to half a million people. They stand there, and have\r\ncommissioned and enjoined me to stand there forever; and, so help me\r\nGod, I will. I say to you frankly, gentlemen, that while we hold this\r\ndoctrine, there is no Republican, there is no convention of Republicans,\r\nthere is no paper that speaks for them, there is no orator that sets\r\nforth their doctrines, who ever pretends that they have any right in\r\nyour States to interfere with your peculiar institution; but, on the\r\nother hand, our authoritative platform repudiates the idea that we have\r\nany right or any intention ever to invade your peculiar institution in\r\nyour own States.\r\n\r\nNow, what do you complain of? You are going to break up this Government;\r\nyou are going to involve us in war and blood, from a mere suspicion that\r\nwe shall justify that which we stand everywhere pledged not to do.\r\nWould you be justified in the eyes of the civilized world in taking\r\nso monstrous a position, and predicating it on a bare, groundless\r\nsuspicion? We do not love slavery. Did you not know that before to-day,\r\nbefore this session commenced? Have you not a perfect confidence that\r\nthe civilized world is against you on this subject of loving slavery\r\nor believing that it is the best institution in the world? Why, sir,\r\neverything remains precisely as it was a year ago. No great catastrophe\r\nhas occurred. There is no recent occasion to accuse us of anything.\r\nBut all at once, when we meet here, a kind of gloom pervades the whole\r\ncommunity and the Senate Chamber. Gentlemen rise and tell us that they\r\nare on the eve of breaking up this Government, that seven or eight\r\nStates are going to break off their connection with the Government,\r\nretire from the Union, and set up a hostile government of their own, and\r\nthey look imploringly over to us, and say to us: \"You can prevent it; we\r\ncan do nothing to prevent it; but it all lies with you.\" Well, sir, what\r\ncan we do to prevent it? You have not even condescended to tell us what\r\nyou want; but I think I see through the speeches that I have heard from\r\ngentlemen on the other side. If we would give up the verdict of the\r\npeople, and take your platform, I do not know but you would be satisfied\r\nwith it. I think the Senator from Texas rather intimated, and I think\r\nthe Senator from Georgia more than intimated, that if we would take what\r\nis exactly the Charleston platform on which Mr. Breckenridge was placed,\r\nand give up that on which we won our victory, you would grumblingly and\r\nhesitatingly be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. Iverson. I would prefer that the Senator would look over my remarks\r\nbefore quoting them so confidently. I made no such statement as that. I\r\ndid not say that I would be satisfied with any such thing. I would not\r\nbe satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade. I did not say that the Senator said so; but by construction I\r\ngathered that from his speech. I do not know that I was right in it.\r\n\r\nMr. Iverson. The Senator is altogether wrong in his construction.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade. Well, sir, I have now found what the Senator said on the other\r\npoint to which he called my attention a little while ago. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\"Nor do we suppose that there will be any overt acts upon the part of\r\nMr. Lincoln. For one, I do not dread these overt acts. I do not propose\r\nto wait for them. Why, sir, the power of this Federal Government could\r\nbe so exercised against the institution of slavery in the Southern\r\nStates, as that, without an overt act, the institution would not last\r\nten years. We know that, sir; and seeing the storm which is approaching,\r\nalthough it may be seemingly in the distance, we are determined to seek\r\nour own safety and security before it shall burst upon us and overwhelm\r\nus with its fury, when we are not in a situation to defend ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThat is what the Senator said.\r\n\r\nMr. Iverson. Yes; that is what I said.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade. Well, then, you did not expect that Mr. Lincoln would commit\r\nany overt act against the Constitution--that was not it--you were not\r\ngoing to wait for that, but were going to proceed on your supposition\r\nthat probably he might; and that is the sense of what I said before.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. President, I have disavowed all intention on the part of the\r\nRepublican party to harm a hair of your heads anywhere. We hold to\r\nno doctrine that can possibly work you an inconvenience. We have\r\nbeen faithful to the execution of all the laws in which you have any\r\ninterest, as stands confessed on this floor by your own party, and as is\r\nknown to me without their confessions. It is not, then, that Mr. Lincoln\r\nis expected to do any overt act by which you may be injured; you will\r\nnot wait for any; but anticipating that the Government may work an\r\ninjury, you say you will put an end to it, which means simply, that\r\nyou intend either to rule or ruin this Government. That is what your\r\ncomplaint comes to; nothing else. We do not like your institution, you\r\nsay. Well, we never liked it any better than we do now. You might\r\nas well have dissolved the Union at any other period as now, on that\r\naccount, for we stand in relation to it precisely as we have ever\r\nstood; that is, repudiating it among ourselves as a matter of policy\r\nand morals, but nevertheless admitting that where it is out of our\r\njurisdiction, we have no hold upon it, and no designs upon it.\r\n\r\nThen, sir, as there is nothing in the platform on which Mr. Lincoln was\r\nelected of which you complain, I ask, is there anything in the character\r\nof the President-elect of which you ought to complain? Has he not lived\r\na blameless life? Did he ever transgress any law? Has he ever committed\r\nany violation of duty of which the most scrupulous can complain? Why,\r\nthen, your suspicions that he will? I have shown that you have had the\r\ngovernment all the time until, by some misfortune or maladministration,\r\nyou brought it to the very verge of destruction, and the wisdom of the\r\npeople had discovered that it was high time that the scepter should\r\ndepart from you, and be placed in more competent hands; I say that this\r\nbeing so, you have no constitutional right to complain; especially when\r\nwe disavow any intention so to make use of the victory we have won as to\r\ninjure you at all.\r\n\r\nThis brings me, sir, to the question of compromises. On the first day of\r\nthis session, a Senator rose in his place and offered a resolution for\r\nthe appointment of a committee to inquire into the evils that exist\r\nbetween the different sections, and to ascertain what can be done to\r\nsettle this great difficulty. That is the proposition substantially. I\r\ntell the Senator that I know of no difficulty; and as to compromises, I\r\nhad supposed that we were all agreed that the day of compromises was at\r\nan end. The most solemn compromises we have ever made have been\r\nviolated without a whereas. Since I have had a seat in this body, one of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, that had stood for more than thirty years, was\r\nswept away from your statute-books. When I stood here in the minority\r\narguing against it; when I asked you to withhold your hand; when I told\r\nyou it was a sacred compromise between the sections, and that when it\r\nwas removed we should be brought face to face with all that sectional\r\nbitterness that has intervened; when I told you that it was a sacred\r\ncompromise which no man should touch with his finger, what was your\r\nreply? That it was a mere act of Congress--nothing more, nothing\r\nless--and that it could be swept away by the same majority that passed\r\nit. That was true in point of fact, and true in point of law; but it\r\nshowed the weakness of compromises. Now, sir, I only speak for myself;\r\nand I say that, in view of the manner in which other compromises have\r\nbeen heretofore treated, I should hardly think any two of the Democratic\r\nparty would look each other in the face and say \"compromise\" without a\r\nsmile. (Laughter.) A compromise to be brought about by act of Congress,\r\nafter the experience we have had, is absolutely ridiculous.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI say, then, that so far as I am concerned, I will yield to no\r\ncompromise. I do not come here begging, either. It would be an indignity\r\nto the people that I represent if I were to stand here parleying as to\r\nthe rights of the party to which I belong. We have won our right to the\r\nChief Magistracy of this nation in the way that you have always won your\r\npredominance; and if you are as willing to do justice to others as to\r\nexact it from them, you would never raise an inquiry as to a committee\r\nfor compromises. Here I beg, barely for myself, to say one thing more.\r\nMany of you stand in an attitude hostile to this Government; that is to\r\nsay, you occupy an attitude where you threaten that, unless we do so and\r\nso, you will go out of this Union and destroy the Government. I say\r\nto you for myself, that, in my private capacity, I never yielded to\r\nanything by way of threat, and in my public capacity I have no right\r\nto yield to any such thing; and therefore I would not entertain a\r\nproposition for any compromise, for, in my judgment, this long, chronic\r\ncontroversy that has existed between us must be met, and met upon the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution and laws, and met now. I hope it may be\r\nadjusted to the satisfaction of all; and I know no other way to adjust\r\nit, except that way which is laid down by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Whenever we go astray from that, we are sure to plunge ourselves\r\ninto difficulties. The old Constitution of the United States, although\r\ncommonly and frequently in direct opposition to what I could wish,\r\nnevertheless, in my judgment, is the wisest and best constitution\r\nthat ever yet organized a free Government; and by its provisions I\r\nam willing, and intend, to stand or fall. Like the Senator from\r\nMississippi, I ask nothing more. I ask no ingrafting upon it. I ask\r\nnothing to be taken away from it. Under its provisions a nation has\r\ngrown faster than any other in the history of the world ever did before\r\nin prosperity, in power, and in all that makes a nation great and\r\nglorious. It has ministered to the advantages of this people; and now\r\nI am unwilling to add or take away anything till I can see much clearer\r\nthan I can now that it wants either any addition or lopping off.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Texas says--it is not exactly his language--we will\r\nforce you to an ignominious treaty up in Faneuil Hall. Well, sir, you\r\nmay. We know you are brave; we understand your prowess; we want no fight\r\nwith you; but, nevertheless, if you drive us to that necessity, we\r\nmust use all the powers of this Government to maintain it intact in its\r\nintegrity. If we are overthrown, we but share the fate of a thousand\r\nother Governments that have been subverted. If you are the weakest then\r\nyou must go to the wall; and that is all there is about it. That is\r\nthe condition in which we stand, provided a State sets herself up in\r\nopposition to the General Government.\r\n\r\nI say that is the way it seems to me, as a lawyer. I see no power in the\r\nConstitution to release a Senator from this position. Sir, if there\r\nwas any other, if there was an absolute right of secession in the\r\nConstitution of the United States when we stepped up there to take our\r\noath of office, why was there not an exception in that oath? Why did\r\nit not run \"that we would support the Constitution of the United States\r\nunless our State shall secede before our term was out?\" Sir, there is\r\nno such immunity. There is no way by which this can be done that I can\r\nconceive of, except it is standing upon the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, demanding equal justice for all, and vindicating the old flag\r\nof the Union. We must maintain it, unless we are cloven down by superior\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, it may happen that you can make your way out of the Union,\r\nand that, by levying war upon the Government, you may vindicate your\r\nright to independence. If you should do so, I have a policy in my mind.\r\nNo man would regret more than myself that any portion of the people of\r\nthese United States should think themselves impelled, by grievances or\r\nanything else, to depart out of this Union, and raise a foreign flag and\r\na hand against the General Government. If there was any just cause\r\non God's earth that I could see that was within my reach of honorable\r\nrelease from any such pretended grievance, they should have it; but\r\nthey set forth none; I can see none. It is all a matter of prejudice,\r\nsuperinduced unfortunately, I believe, as I intimated before, more\r\nbecause you have listened to the enemies of the Republican party and\r\nwhat they said of us, while, from your intolerance, you have shut out\r\nall light as to what our real principles are. We have been called and\r\nbranded in the North and in the South and everywhere else, as John Brown\r\nmen, as men hostile to your institutions, as meditating an attack upon\r\nyour institutions in your own States--a thing that no Republican ever\r\ndreamed of or ever thought of, but has protested against as often as the\r\nquestion has been up; but your people believe it. No doubt they believe\r\nit because of the terrible excitement and reign of terror that prevails\r\nthere. No doubt they think so, but it arises from false information,\r\nor the want of information--that is all. Their prejudices have been\r\nappealed to until they have become uncontrolled and uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, if it shall be so; if that \"glorious Union,\" as we call it,\r\nunder which the Government has so long lived and prospered, is now about\r\nto come to a final end, as perhaps it may, I have been looking around to\r\nsee what policy we should adopt; and through that gloom which has been\r\nmentioned on the other side, if you will have it so, I still see a\r\nglorious future for those who stand by the old flag of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I am for maintaining the Union of these States. I will\r\nsacrifice everything but honor to maintain it. That glorious old flag of\r\nours, by any act of mine, shall never cease to wave over the integrity\r\nof this Union as it is. But if they will not have it so, in this new,\r\nrenovated Government of which I have spoken, the 4th of July, with all\r\nits glorious memories, will never be repealed. The old flag of 1776\r\nwill be in our hands, and shall float over this nation forever; and this\r\ncapital, that some gentlemen said would be reserved for the Southern\r\nrepublic, shall still be the capital. It was laid out by Washington;\r\nit was consecrated by him; and the old flag that he vindicated in the\r\nRevolution shall still float from the Capitol.\r\n\r\nI say, sir, I stand by the Union of these States. Washington and his\r\ncompatriots fought for that good old flag. It shall never be hauled\r\ndown, but shall be the glory of the Government to which I belong, as\r\nlong as my life shall continue. To maintain it, Washington and his\r\ncompatriots fought for liberty and the rights of man. And here I will\r\nadd that my own father, although but a humble soldier, fought in the\r\nsame great cause, and went through hardships and privations sevenfold\r\nworse than death, in order to bequeath it to his children. It is my\r\ninheritance. It was my protector in infancy, and the pride and glory\r\nof my riper years; and, Mr. President, although it may be assailed by\r\ntraitors on every side, by the grace of God, under its shadow I will\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN JORDON CRITTENDEN,\r\n\r\nOF KENTUCKY. (BORN 1787, DIED 1863.)\r\n\r\nON THE CRITTENDEN COMPROMISE;\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE, DECEMBER 18, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am gratified, Mr. President, to see in the various propositions which\r\nhave been made, such a universal anxiety to save the country from\r\nthe dangerous dissensions which now prevail; and I have, under a very\r\nserious view and without the least ambitious feeling whatever connected\r\nwith it, prepared a series of constitutional amendments, which I desire\r\nto offer to the Senate, hoping that they may form, in part at least,\r\nsome basis for measures that may settle the controverted questions which\r\nnow so much agitate our country. Certainly, sir, I do not propose\r\nnow any elaborate discussion of the subject. Before presenting these\r\nresolutions, however, to the Senate, I desire to make a few remarks\r\nexplanatory of them, that the Senate may understand their general scope.\r\n\r\nThe questions of an alarming character are those which have grown out\r\nof the controversy between the northern and southern sections of our\r\ncountry in relation to the rights of the slave-holding States in the\r\nTerritories of the United States, and in relation to the rights of\r\nthe citizens of the latter in their slaves. I have endeavored by these\r\nresolutions to meet all these questions and causes of discontent, and\r\nby amendments to the Constitution of the United States, so that the\r\nsettlement, if we happily agree on any, may be permanent, and leave no\r\ncause for future controversy. These resolutions propose, then, in the\r\nfirst place, in substance, the restoration of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nextending the line throughout the Territories of the United States\r\nto the eastern border of California, recognizing slavery in all the\r\nterritory south of that line, and prohibiting slavery in all the\r\nterritory north of it; with a provision, however, that when any of those\r\nTerritories, north or south, are formed into States, they shall then be\r\nat liberty to exclude or admit slavery as they please; and that, in the\r\none case or the other, it shall be no objection to their admission into\r\nthe Union. In this way, sir, I propose to settle the question, both as\r\nto territory and slavery, so far as it regards the Territories of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI propose, sir, also, that the Constitution be so amended as to declare\r\nthat Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery in the District\r\nof Columbia so long as slavery exists in the States of Maryland and\r\nVirginia; and that they shall have no power to abolish slavery in any of\r\nthe places under their special jurisdiction within the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThese are the constitutional amendments which I propose, and embrace the\r\nwhole of them in regard to the questions of territory and slavery. There\r\nare other propositions in relation to grievances, and in relation to\r\ncontroversies, which I suppose are within the jurisdiction of Congress,\r\nand may be removed by the action of Congress. I propose, in regard\r\nto legislative action, that the fugitive slave law, as it is commonly\r\ncalled, shall be declared by the Senate to be a constitutional act, in\r\nstrict pursuance of the Constitution. I propose to declare that it\r\nhas been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to be\r\nconstitutional, and that the Southern States are entitled to a faithful\r\nand complete execution of that law, and that no amendment shall be made\r\nhereafter to it which will impair its efficiency. But, thinking that it\r\nwould not impair its efficiency, I have proposed amendments to it in two\r\nparticulars. I have understood from gentlemen of the North that there\r\nis objection to the provision giving a different fee where the\r\ncommissioner decides to deliver the slave to the claimant, from that\r\nwhich is given where he decides to discharge the alleged slave; the law\r\ndeclares that in the latter case he shall have but five dollars, while\r\nin the other he shall have ten dollars--twice the amount in one case\r\nthan in the other. The reason for this was very obvious. In case he\r\ndelivers the servant to his claimant he is required to draw out a\r\nlengthy certificate, stating the principle and substantial grounds on\r\nwhich his decision rests, and to return him either to the marshal or to\r\nthe claimant to remove him to the State from which he escaped. It was\r\nfor that reason that a larger fee was given to the commissioner, where\r\nhe had the largest service to perform. But, sir, the act being viewed\r\nunfavorably and with great prejudice, in a certain portion of our\r\ncountry, this was regarded as very obnoxious, because it seemed to give\r\nan inducement to the commissioner to return the slave to the master, as\r\nhe thereby obtained the larger fee of ten dollars instead of the smaller\r\none of five dollars. I have said, let the fee be the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nI have understood, furthermore, sir, that inasmuch as the fifth section\r\nof that law was worded somewhat vaguely, its general terms had admitted\r\nof the construction in the Northern States that all the citizens were\r\nrequired, upon the summons of the marshal, to go with him to hunt up,\r\nas they express it, and arrest the slave; and this is regarded as\r\nobnoxious. They have said, \"in the Southern States you make no such\r\nrequisition on the citizen\"; nor do we, sir. The section, construed\r\naccording to the intention of the framers of it, I suppose, only\r\nintended that the marshal should have the same right in the execution\r\nof process for the arrest of a slave that he has in all other cases of\r\nprocess that he is required to execute--to call on the _posse comitatus_\r\nfor assistance where he is resisted in the execution of his duty, or\r\nwhere, having executed his duty by the arrest, an attempt is made to\r\nrescue the slave. I propose such an amendment as will obviate this\r\ndifficulty and limit the right of the master and the duty of the citizen\r\nto cases where, as in regard to all other process, persons may be called\r\nupon to assist in resisting opposition to the execution of the laws.\r\n\r\nI have provided further, sir, that the amendment to the Constitution\r\nwhich I here propose, and certain other provisions of the Constitution\r\nitself, shall be unalterable, thereby forming a permanent and\r\nunchangeable basis for peace and tranquillity among the people. Among\r\nthe provisions in the present Constitution, which I have by amendment\r\nproposed to render unalterable, is that provision in the first article\r\nof the Constitution which provides the rule for representation,\r\nincluding in the computation three-fifths of the slaves. That is to\r\nbe rendered unchangeable. Another is the provision for the delivery of\r\nfugitive slaves. That is to be rendered unchangeable.\r\n\r\nAnd with these provisions, Mr. President, it seems to me we have a solid\r\nfoundation upon which we may rest our hopes for the restoration of peace\r\nand good-will among all the States of this Union, and all the people.\r\nI propose,sir, to enter into no particular discussion. I have explained\r\nthe general scope and object of my proposition. I have provided further,\r\nwhich I ought to mention, that, there having been some difficulties\r\nexperienced in the courts of the United States in the South in carrying\r\ninto execution the laws prohibiting the African slave trade, all\r\nadditions and amendments which may be necessary to those laws to render\r\nthem effectual should be immediately adopted by Congress, and especially\r\nthe provision of those laws which prohibit the importation of African\r\nslaves into the United States. I have further provided it as a\r\nrecommendation to all the States of this Union, that whereas laws have\r\nbeen passed of an unconstitutional character, (and all laws are of\r\nthat character which either conflict with the constitutional acts\r\nof Congress, or which in their operation hinder or delay the proper\r\nexecution of the acts of Congress,) which laws are null and void, and\r\nyet, though null and void, they have been the source of mischief and\r\ndiscontent in the country, under the extraordinary circumstances in\r\nwhich we are placed; I have supposed that it would not be improper or\r\nunbecoming in Congress to recommend to the States, both North and South,\r\nthe repeal of all such acts of theirs as were intended to control, or\r\nintended to obstruct the operation of the acts of Congress, or which in\r\ntheir operation and in their application have been made use of for the\r\npurpose of such hindrance and opposition, and that they will repeal\r\nthese laws or make such explanations or corrections of them as to\r\nprevent their being used for any such mischievous purpose.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to look with impartiality from one end of our country\r\nto the other; I have endeavored to search up what appeared to me to be\r\nthe causes of discontent pervading the land; and, as far as I am capable\r\nof doing so, I have endeavored to propose a remedy for them. I am far\r\nfrom believing that, in the shape in which I present these measures,\r\nthey will meet with the acceptance of the Senate. It will be\r\nsufficiently gratifying if, with all the amendments that the superior\r\nknowledge of the Senate may make to them, they shall, to any effectual\r\nextent, quiet the country.\r\n\r\nMr. President, great dangers surround us. The Union of these States\r\nis dear to the people of the United States. The long experience of its\r\nblessings, the mighty hopes of the future, have made it dear to the\r\nhearts of the American people. Whatever politicians may say, whatever\r\nof dissension may, in the heat of party politics, be created among\r\nour people, when you come down to the question of the existence of the\r\nConstitution, that is a question beyond all politics; that is a question\r\nof life and death. The Constitution and the Union are the life of this\r\ngreat people--yes, sir, the life of life. We all desire to preserve\r\nthem, North and South; that is the universal desire. But some of the\r\nSouthern States, smarting under what they conceive to be aggressions of\r\ntheir Northern brethren and of the Northern States, are not contented to\r\ncontinue this Union, and are taking steps, formidable steps, towards a\r\ndissolution of the Union, and towards the anarchy and the bloodshed, I\r\nfear, that are to follow. I say, sir, we are in the presence of great\r\nevents. We must elevate ourselves to the level of the great occasion. No\r\nparty warfare about mere party questions or party measures ought now\r\nto engage our attention. They are left behind; they are as dust in the\r\nbalance. The life, the existence of our country, of our Union, is\r\nthe mighty question; and we must elevate ourselves to all those\r\nconsiderations which belong to this high subject.\r\n\r\nI hope, therefore, gentlemen will be disposed to bring the sincerest\r\nspirit of conciliation, the sincerest spirit and desire to adjust all\r\nthese difficulties, and to think nothing of any little concessions of\r\nopinions that they may make, if thereby the Constitution and the country\r\ncan be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty here, sir--I know it; I recognize it as the\r\ndifficult question, particularly with the gentlemen from the North--is\r\nthe admission of this line of division for the territory, and the\r\nrecognition of slavery on the one side, and the prohibition of it on the\r\nother. The recognition of slavery on the southern side of that line is\r\nthe great difficulty, the great question with them. Now, I beseech you\r\nto think, and you, Mr. President, and all, to think whether, for such\r\na comparative trifle as that, the Union of this country is to be\r\nsacrificed. Have we realized to ourselves the momentous consequences of\r\nsuch an event? When has the world seen such an event? This is a mighty\r\nempire. Its existence spreads its influence throughout the civilized\r\nworld. Its overthrow will be the greatest shock that civilization and\r\nfree government have received; more extensive in its consequences; more\r\nfatal to mankind and to the great principles upon which the liberty of\r\nmankind depends, than the French revolution with all its blood, and with\r\nall its war and violence. And all for what? Upon questions concerning\r\nthis line of division between slavery and freedom? Why, Mr. President,\r\nsuppose this day all the Southern States, being refused this right;\r\nbeing refused this partition; being denied this privilege, were to\r\nseparate from the Northern States, and do it peacefully, and then were\r\nto come to you peacefully and say, \"let there be no war between us;\r\nlet us divide fairly the Territories of the United States\"; could the\r\nnorthern section of the country refuse so just a demand? What would you\r\nthen give them? What would be the fair proportion? If you allowed them\r\ntheir fair relative proportion, would you not give them as much as is\r\nnow proposed to be assigned on the southern side of that line, and would\r\nthey not be at liberty to carry their slaves there, if they pleased? You\r\nwould give them the whole of that; and then what would be its fate?\r\n\r\nIs it upon the general principle of humanity, then, that you (addressing\r\nRepublican Senators) wish to put an end to slavery, or is it to be urged\r\nby you as a mere topic and point of party controversy to sustain party\r\npower? Surely I give you credit for looking at it upon broader and\r\nmore generous principles. Then, in the worst event, after you have\r\nencountered disunion, that greatest of all political calamities to the\r\npeople of this country, and the disunionists come, the separating States\r\ncome, and demand or take their portion of the Territories, they can\r\ntake, and will be entitled to take, all that will now lie on the\r\nsouthern side of the line which I have proposed. Then they will have\r\na right to permit slavery to exist in it; and what do you gain for the\r\ncause of anti-slavery? Nothing whatever. Suppose you should refuse their\r\ndemand, and claim the whole for yourselves, that would be a flagrant\r\ninjustice which you would not be willing that I should suppose would\r\noccur. But if you did, what would be the consequence? A State north and\r\na State south, and all the States, north and south, would be attempting\r\nto grasp at and seize this territory, and to get all of it that they\r\ncould. That would be the struggle, and you would have war; and not\r\nonly disunion, but all these fatal consequences would follow from your\r\nrefusal now to permit slavery to exist, to recognize it as existing,\r\non the southern side of the proposed line, while you give to the people\r\nthere the right to exclude it when they come to form a State government,\r\nif such should be their will and pleasure.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, in view of this subject, in view of the mighty\r\nconsequences, in view of the great events which are present before you,\r\nand of the mighty consequences which are just now to take effect, is\r\nit not better to settle the question by a division upon the line of the\r\nMissouri Compromise? For thirty years we lived quietly and peacefully\r\nunder it. Our people, North and South, were accustomed to look at it\r\nas a proper and just line. Can we not do so again? We did it then to\r\npreserve the peace of the country. Now you see this Union in the most\r\nimminent danger. I declare to you that it is my solemn conviction that\r\nunless something be done, and something equivalent to this proposition,\r\nwe shall be a separated and divided people in six months from this time.\r\nThat is my firm conviction. There is no man here who deplores it more\r\nthan I do; but it is my sad and melancholy conviction that that will be\r\nthe consequence. I wish you to realize fully the danger. I wish you\r\nto realize fully the consequences which are to follow. You can give\r\nincreased stability to this Union; you can give it an existence, a\r\nglorious existence, for great and glorious centuries to come, by now\r\nsetting it upon a permanent basis, recognizing what the South considers\r\nas its rights; and this is the greatest of them all; it is that you\r\nshould divide the territory by this line, and allow the people south of\r\nit to have slavery when they are admitted into the Union as States, and\r\nto have it during the existence of the territorial government. That is\r\nall. Is it not the cheapest price at which such a blessing as this Union\r\nwas ever purchased? You think, perhaps, or some of you, that there is no\r\ndanger, that it will but thunder and pass away. Do not entertain such a\r\nfatal delusion. I tell you it is not so. I tell you that as sure as we\r\nstand here disunion will progress. I fear it may swallow up even old\r\nKentucky in its vortex--as true a State to the Union as yet exists in\r\nthe whole Confederacy--unless something be done; but that you will have\r\ndisunion, that anarchy and war will follow it, that all this will take\r\nplace in six months, I believe as confidently as I believe in your\r\npresence. I want to satisfy you of the fact.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe present exasperation; the present feeling of disunion, is the\r\nresult of a long-continued controversy on the subject of slavery and\r\nof territory. I shall not attempt to trace that controversy; it is\r\nunnecessary to the occasion, and might be harmful. In relation to such\r\ncontroversies, I will say, though, that all the wrong is never on one\r\nside, or all the right on the other. Right and wrong, in this world,\r\nand in all such controversies, are mingled together. I forbear now any\r\ndiscussion or any reference to the right or wrong of the controversy,\r\nthe mere party controversy; but in the progress of party, we now come\r\nto a point where party ceases to deserve consideration, and the\r\npreservation of the Union demands our highest and our greatest\r\nexertions. To preserve the Constitution of the country is the highest\r\nduty of the Senate, the highest duty of Congress--to preserve it and to\r\nperpetuate it, that we may hand down the glories which we have received\r\nto our children and to our posterity, and to generations far beyond us.\r\nWe are, Senators, in positions where history is to take notice of the\r\ncourse we pursue.\r\n\r\nHistory is to record us. Is it to record that when the destruction of\r\nthe Union was imminent; when we saw it tottering to its fall; when we\r\nsaw brothers arming their hands for hostility with one another, we stood\r\nquarrelling about points of party politics; about questions which we\r\nattempted to sanctify and to consecrate by appealing to our conscience\r\nas the source of them? Are we to allow such fearful catastrophes to\r\noccur while we stand trifling away our time? While we stand thus,\r\nshowing our inferiority to the great and mighty dead, showing our\r\ninferiority to the high positions which we occupy, the country may be\r\ndestroyed and ruined; and to the amazement of all the world, the great\r\nRepublic may fall prostrate and in ruins, carrying with it the very hope\r\nof that liberty which we have heretofore enjoyed; carrying with it, in\r\nplace of the peace we have enjoyed, nothing but revolution and havoc and\r\nanarchy. Shall it be said that we have allowed all these evils to come\r\nupon our country, while we were engaged in the petty and small disputes\r\nand debates to which I have referred? Can it be that our name is to rest\r\nin history with this everlasting stigma and blot upon it?\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to God it was in my power to preserve this Union by\r\nrenouncing or agreeing to give up every conscientious and other opinion.\r\nI might not be able to discard it from my mind; I am under no obligation\r\nto do that. I may retain the opinion, but if I can do so great a good as\r\nto preserve my country and give it peace, and its institutions and its\r\nUnion stability, I will forego any action upon my opinions. Well, now,\r\nmy friends (addressing the Republican Senators), that is all that is\r\nasked of you. Consider it well, and I do not distrust the result. As\r\nto the rest of this body, the gentlemen from the South, I would say to\r\nthem, can you ask more than this? Are you bent on revolution, bent on\r\ndisunion. God forbid it. I cannot believe that such madness possesses\r\nthe American people. This gives reasonable satisfaction. I can speak\r\nwith confidence only of my own State. Old Kentucky will be satisfied\r\nwith it, and she will stand by the Union and die by the Union if this\r\nsatisfaction be given. Nothing shall seduce her. The clamor of no\r\nrevolution, the seductions and temptations of no revolution, will\r\ntempt her to move one step. She has stood always by the side of the\r\nConstitution; she has always been devoted to it, and is this day. Give\r\nher this satisfaction, and I believe all the States of the South that\r\nare not desirous of disunion as a better thing than the Union and the\r\nConstitution, will be satisfied and will adhere to the Union, and\r\nwe shall go on again in our great career of national prosperity and\r\nnational glory.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, it is not necessary for me to speak to you of the consequences\r\nthat will follow disunion. Who of us is not proud of the greatness we\r\nhave achieved? Disunion and separation destroy that greatness. Once\r\ndisunited, we are no longer great. The nations of the earth who\r\nhave looked upon you as a formidable Power, and rising to untold and\r\nimmeasurable greatness in the future, will scoff at you. Your flag, that\r\nnow claims the respect of the world, that protects American property\r\nin every port and harbor of the world, that protects the rights of\r\nyour citizens everywhere, what will become of it? What becomes of its\r\nglorious influence? It is gone; and with it the protection of American\r\ncitizens and property. To say nothing of the national honor which\r\nit displayed to all the world, the protection of your rights, the\r\nprotection of your property abroad is gone with that national flag,\r\nand we are hereafter to conjure and contrive different flags for our\r\ndifferent republics according to the feverish fancies of revolutionary\r\npatriots and disturbers of the peace of the world. No, sir; I want to\r\nfollow no such flag. I want to preserve the union of my country. We have\r\nit in our power to do so, and we are responsible if we do not do it.\r\n\r\nI do not despair of the Republic. When I see before me Senators of so\r\nmuch intelligence and so much patriotism, who have been so honored by\r\ntheir country, sent here as the guardians of that very union which is\r\nnow in question, sent here as the guardians of our national rights, and\r\nas guardians of that national flag, I cannot despair; I cannot despond.\r\nI cannot but believe that they will find some means of reconciling and\r\nadjusting the rights of all parties, by concessions, if necessary, so\r\nas to preserve and give more stability to the country and to its\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT TOOMBS,\r\n\r\nOF GEORGIA. (BORN 1810--DIED 1885.)\r\n\r\nON SECESSION; SECESSIONIST OPINION;\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, JANUARY 7, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND SENATORS:\r\n\r\nThe success of the Abolitionists and their allies, under the name of the\r\nRepublican party, has produced its logical results already. They have\r\nfor long years been sowing dragons' teeth, and have finally got a crop\r\nof armed men. The Union, sir, is dissolved. That is an accomplished fact\r\nin the path of this discussion that men may as well heed. One of your\r\nconfederates has already, wisely, bravely, boldly, confronted public\r\ndanger, and she is only ahead of many of her sisters because of her\r\ngreater facility for speedy action. The greater majority of those sister\r\nStates, under like circumstances, consider her cause as their cause; and\r\nI charge you in their name to-day, \"Touch not Saguntum.\" It is not only\r\ntheir cause, but it is a cause which receives the sympathy and will\r\nreceive the support of tens and hundreds of thousands of honest\r\npatriotic men in the non-slave-holding States, who have hither-to\r\nmaintained constitutional rights, and who respect their oaths, abide by\r\ncompacts, and love justice. And while this Congress, this Senate, and\r\nthis House of Representatives, are debating the constitutionality and\r\nthe expediency of seceding from the Union, and while the perfidious\r\nauthors of this mischief are showering down denunciations upon a large\r\nportion of the patriotic men of this country, those brave men are coolly\r\nand calmly voting what you call revolution--ay, sir, doing better than\r\nthat: arming to defend it. They appealed to the Constitution,\r\nthey appealed to justice, they appealed to fraternity, until the\r\nConstitution, justice, and fraternity were no longer listened to in the\r\nlegislative halls of their country, and then, sir, they prepared for the\r\narbitrament of the sword; and now you see the glittering bayonet, and\r\nyou hear the tramp of armed men from your Capitol to the Rio Grande. It\r\nis a sight that gladdens the eyes and cheers the heart of other millions\r\nready to second them.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, sir, as I have labored earnestly, honestly, sincerely, with\r\nthese men to avert this necessity so long as I deemed it possible, and\r\ninasmuch as I heartily approve their present conduct of resistance, I\r\ndeem it my duty to state their case to the Senate, to the country, and\r\nto the civilized world.\r\n\r\nSenators, my countrymen have demanded no new government; they have\r\ndemanded no new constitution. Look to their records at home and here\r\nfrom the beginning of this national strife until its consummation in\r\nthe disruption of the empire, and they have not demanded a single thing\r\nexcept that you shall abide by the Constitution of the United States;\r\nthat constitutional rights shall be respected, and that justice shall be\r\ndone. Sirs, they have stood by your Constitution; they have stood by\r\nall its requirements; they have performed all its duties unselfishly,\r\nuncalculatingly, disinterestedly, until a party sprang up in this\r\ncountry which endangered their social system--a party which they\r\narraign, and which they charge before the American people and all\r\nmankind, with having made proclamation of outlawry against four thousand\r\nmillions of their property in the Territories of the United States; with\r\nhaving put them under the ban of the empire in all the States in which\r\ntheir institutions exist, outside the protection of Federal laws; with\r\nhaving aided and abetted insurrection from within and invasion from\r\nwithout, with the view of subverting those institutions, and desolating\r\ntheir homes and their firesides. For these causes they have taken up\r\narms. I shall proceed to vindicate the justice of their demands, the\r\npatriotism of their conduct. I will show the injustice which they suffer\r\nand the rightfulness of their resistance.\r\n\r\nI shall not spend much time on the question that seems to give my\r\nhonorable friend (Mr. Crittenden) so much concern--the constitutional\r\nright of a State to secede from this Union. Perhaps he will find out\r\nafter a while that it is a fact accomplished. You have got it in\r\nthe South pretty much both ways. South Carolina has given it to you\r\nregularly, according to the approved plan. You are getting it just below\r\nthere (in Georgia), I believe, irregularly, outside of the law, without\r\nregular action. You can take it either way. You will find armed men to\r\ndefend both. I have stated that the discontented States of this\r\nUnion have demanded nothing but clear, distinct, unequivocal,\r\nwell-acknowledged constitutional rights; rights affirmed by the highest\r\njudicial tribunals of their country; rights older than the Constitution;\r\nrights which are planted upon the immutable principles of natural\r\njustice; rights which have been affirmed by the good and the wise of all\r\ncountries, and of all centuries. We demand no power to injure any man.\r\nWe demand no right to injure our confederate States. We demand no right\r\nto interfere with their institutions, either by word or deed. We have\r\nno right to disturb their peace, their tranquillity, their security. We\r\nhave demanded of them simply, solely--nothing else--to give us equality,\r\nsecurity, and tranquillity. Give us these, and peace restores itself.\r\nRefuse them, and take what you can get.\r\n\r\nI will now read my own demands, acting under my own convictions, and the\r\nuniversal judgment of my countrymen. They are considered the demands of\r\nan extremist. To hold to a constitutional right now makes one considered\r\nas an extremist--I believe that is the appellation these traitors and\r\nvillains, North and South, employ. I accept their reproach rather than\r\ntheir principles. Accepting their designation of treason and rebellion,\r\nthere stands before them as good a traitor, and as good a rebel as ever\r\ndescended from revolutionary loins.\r\n\r\nWhat do the rebels demand? First, \"that the people of the United States\r\nshall have an equal right to emigrate and settle in the present or any\r\nfuture acquired territories, with whatever property they may possess\r\n(including slaves), and be securely protected in its peaceable enjoyment\r\nuntil such Territory may be admitted as a State into the Union, with or\r\nwithout slavery, as she may determine, on an equality with all existing\r\nStates.\" That is our territorial demand. We have fought for this\r\nTerritory when blood was its price. We have paid for it when gold\r\nwas its price. We have not proposed to exclude you, though you have\r\ncontributed very little of blood or money. I refer especially to New\r\nEngland. We demand only to go into those Territories upon terms of\r\nequality with you, as equals in this great Confederacy, to enjoy the\r\ncommon property of the whole Union, and receive the protection of the\r\ncommon government, until the Territory is capable of coming into the\r\nUnion as a sovereign State, when it may fix its own institutions to suit\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe second proposition is, \"that property in slaves shall be entitled to\r\nthe same protection from the Government of the United States, in all of\r\nits departments, everywhere, which the Constitution confers the power\r\nupon it to extend to any other property, provided nothing herein\r\ncontained shall be construed to limit or restrain the right now\r\nbelonging to every State to prohibit, abolish, or establish and protect\r\nslavery within its limits.\" We demand of the common government to use\r\nits granted powers to protect our property as well as yours. For this\r\nprotection we pay as much as you do. This very property is subject to\r\ntaxation. It has been taxed by you and sold by you for taxes. The title\r\nto thousands and tens of thousands of slaves is derived from the United\r\nStates. We claim that the Government, while the Constitution recognizes\r\nour property for the purposes of taxation, shall give it the same\r\nprotection that it gives yours. Ought it not to be so? You say no. Every\r\none of you upon the committee said no. Your Senators say no. Your House\r\nof Representatives says no. Throughout the length and breadth of your\r\nconspiracy against the Constitution, there is but one shout of no! This\r\nrecognition of this right is the price of my allegiance. Withhold it,\r\nand you do not get my obedience. This is the philosophy of the armed\r\nmen who have sprung up in this country. Do you ask me to support a\r\ngovernment that will tax my property; that will plunder me; that\r\nwill demand my blood, and will not protect me? I would rather see the\r\npopulation of my native State laid six feet beneath her sod than they\r\nshould support for one hour such a government. Protection is the price\r\nof obedience everywhere, in all countries. It is the only thing that\r\nmakes government respectable. Deny it and you cannot have free subjects\r\nor citizens; you may have slaves.\r\n\r\nWe demand, in the next place, \"that persons committing crimes against\r\nslave property in one State, and fleeing to another, shall be delivered\r\nup in the same manner as persons committing crimes against other\r\nproperty, and that the laws of the State from which such persons flee\r\nshall be the test of criminality.\" That is another one of the demands of\r\nan extremist and rebel. The Constitution of the United States, article\r\nfour, section two, says:\r\n\r\n\"A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other crime, who\r\nshall flee from justice and be found in another State, shall, on demand\r\nof the executive authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered\r\nup to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime.\" But the\r\nnon-slave-holding States, treacherous to their oaths and compacts, have\r\nsteadily refused, if the criminal only stole a negro, and that negro was\r\na slave, to deliver him up. It was refused twice on the requisition of\r\nmy own State as long as twenty-two years ago. It was refused by Kent and\r\nby Fairfield, Governors of Maine, and representing, I believe, each\r\nof the then Federal parties. We appealed then to fraternity, but we\r\nsubmitted; and this constitutional right has been practically a dead\r\nletter from that day to this. The next case came up between us and the\r\nState of New York, when the present senior Senator (Mr. Seward) was\r\nthe Governor of that State; and he refused it. Why? He said it was not\r\nagainst the laws of New York to steal a negro, and therefore he would\r\nnot comply with the demand. He made a similar refusal to Virginia. Yet\r\nthese are our confederates; these are our sister States! There is\r\nthe bargain; there is the compact. You have sworn to it. Both these\r\nGovernors swore to it. The Senator from New York swore to it. The\r\nGovernor of Ohio swore to it when he was inaugurated. You cannot bind\r\nthem by oaths.\r\n\r\nYet they talk to us of treason; and I suppose they expect to whip\r\nfreemen into loving such brethren! They will have a good time in doing\r\nit!\r\n\r\nIt is natural we should want this provision of the Constitution carried\r\nout. The Constitution says slaves are property; the Supreme Court says\r\nso; the Constitution says so. The theft of slaves is a crime; they are\r\na subject-matter of felonious asportation. By the text and letter of the\r\nConstitution you agreed to give them up. You have sworn to do it, and\r\nyou have broken your oaths. Of course, those who have done so look out\r\nfor pretexts. Nobody expected them do otherwise. I do not think I\r\never saw a perjurer, however bald and naked, who could not invent some\r\npretext to palliate his crime, or who could not, for fifteen shillings,\r\nhire an Old Bailey lawyer to invent some for him. Yet this requirement\r\nof the Constitution is another one of the extreme demands of an\r\nextremist and a rebel.\r\n\r\nThe next stipulation is that fugitive slaves shall be surrendered under\r\nthe provisions of the fugitive-slave act of 1850, without being entitled\r\neither to a writ of _habeas corpus_, or trial by jury, or other similar\r\nobstructions of legislation, in the State to which he may flee. Here is\r\nthe Constitution:\r\n\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into an-other, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall\r\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\nbe due.\"\r\n\r\nThis language is plain, and everybody understood it the same way for the\r\nfirst forty years of your government. In 1793, in Washington's time, an\r\nact was passed to carry out this provision. It was adopted unanimously\r\nin the Senate of the United States, and nearly so in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Nobody then had invented pretexts to show that the\r\nConstitution did not mean a negro slave. It was clear; it was plain.\r\nNot only the Federal courts, but all the local courts in all the States,\r\ndecide that this was a constitutional obligation. How is it now? The\r\nNorth sought to evade it; following the instincts of their natural\r\ncharacter, they commenced with the fraudulent fiction that fugitives\r\nwere entitled to _habeas corpus_, entitled to trial by jury in the State\r\nto which they fled. They pretended to believe that our fugitive slaves\r\nwere entitled to more rights than their white citizens; perhaps they\r\nwere right, they know one another better than I do. You may charge\r\na white man with treason, or felony, or other crime, and you do not\r\nrequire any trial by jury before he is given up; there is nothing to\r\ndetermine but that he is legally charged with a crime and that he\r\nfled, and then he is to be delivered up upon demand. White people\r\nare delivered up every day in this way; but not slaves. Slaves, black\r\npeople, you say, are entitled to trial by jury; and in this way schemes\r\nhave been invented to defeat your plain constitutional obligations. * * *\r\n\r\nThe next demand made on behalf of the South is, \"that Congress shall\r\npass effective laws for the punishment of all persons in any of the\r\nStates who shall in any manner aid and abet invasion or insurrection in\r\nany other State, or commit any other act against the laws of nations,\r\ntending to disturb the tranquillity of the people or government of any\r\nother State.\" That is a very plain principle. The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States now requires, and gives Congress express power, to\r\ndefine and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,\r\nand offences against the laws of nations. When the honorable and\r\ndistinguished Senator from Illinois (Mr. Douglas) last year introduced\r\na bill for the purpose of punishing people thus offending under that\r\nclause of the Constitution, Mr. Lincoln, in his speech at New York,\r\nwhich I have before me, declared that it was a \"sedition bill \"; his\r\npress and party hooted at it. So far from recognizing the bill as\r\nintended to carry out the Constitution of the United States, it received\r\ntheir jeers and jibes. The Black Republicans of Massachusetts elected\r\nthe admirer and eulogist of John Brown's courage as their governor, and\r\nwe may suppose he will throw no impediments in the way of John Brown's\r\nsuccessors. The epithet applied to the bill of the Senator from Illinois\r\nis quoted from a deliberate speech delivered by Lincoln in New York,\r\nfor which, it was stated in the journals, according to some resolution\r\npassed by an association of his own party, he was paid a couple of\r\nhundred dollars. The speech should therefore have been deliberate.\r\nLincoln denounced that bill. He places the stamp of his condemnation\r\nupon a measure intended to promote the peace and security of confederate\r\nStates. He is, therefore, an enemy of the human race, and deserves the\r\nexecration of all mankind.\r\n\r\nWe demand these five propositions. Are they not right? Are they not\r\njust? Take them in detail, and show that they are not warranted by the\r\nConstitution, by the safety of our people, by the principles of eternal\r\njustice. We will pause and consider them; but mark me, we will not let\r\nyou decide the question for us. * * *\r\n\r\nSenators, the Constitution is a compact. It contains all our obligations\r\nand the duties of the Federal Government. I am content and have ever\r\nbeen content to sustain it. While I doubt its perfection, while I do\r\nnot believe it was a good compact, and while I never saw the day that I\r\nwould have voted for it as a proposition _de novo_, yet I am bound to it\r\nby oath and by that common prudence which would induce men to abide by\r\nestablished forms rather than to rush into unknown dangers. I have given\r\nto it, and intend to give to it, unfaltering support and allegiance,\r\nbut I choose to put that allegiance on the true ground, not on the false\r\nidea that anybody's blood was shed for it. I say that the Constitution\r\nis the whole compact. All the obligations, all the chains that fetter\r\nthe limbs of my people, are nominated in the bond, and they wisely\r\nexcluded any conclusion against them, by declaring that \"the powers not\r\ngranted by the Constitution to the United States, or forbidden by it to\r\nthe States, belonged to the States respectively or the people.\" Now I\r\nwill try it by that standard; I will subject it to that test. The law\r\nof nature, the law of justice, would say--and it is so expounded by the\r\npublicists--that equal rights in the common property shall be enjoyed.\r\nEven in a monarchy the king cannot prevent the subjects from enjoying\r\nequality in the disposition of the public property. Even in a despotic\r\ngovernment this principle is recognized. It was the blood and the\r\nmoney of the whole people (says the learned Grotius, and say all the\r\npublicists) which acquired the public property, and therefore it is\r\nnot the property of the sovereign. This right of equality being, then,\r\naccording to justice and natural equity, a right belonging to all\r\nStates, when did we give it up? You say Congress has a right to pass\r\nrules and regulations concerning the Territory and other property of the\r\nUnited States. Very well. Does that exclude those whose blood and money\r\npaid for it? Does \"dispose of\" mean to rob the rightful owners? You must\r\nshow a better title than that, or a better sword than we have.\r\n\r\nBut, you say, try the right. I agree to it. But how? By our judgment?\r\nNo, not until the last resort. What then; by yours? No, not until the\r\nsame time. How then try it? The South has always said, by the Supreme\r\nCourt. But that is in our favor, and Lincoln says he \"will not stand that\r\njudgment.\" Then each must judge for himself of the mode and manner\r\nof redress. But you deny us that privilege, and finally reduce us to\r\naccepting your judgment. The Senator from Kentucky comes to your aid,\r\nand says he can find no constitutional right of secession. Perhaps not;\r\nbut the Constitution is not the place to look for State rights. If that\r\nright belongs to independent States, and they did not cede it to the\r\nFederal Government, it is reserved to the States, or to the people. Ask\r\nyour new commentator where he gets the right to judge for us. Is it in\r\nthe bond?\r\n\r\nThe Northern doctrine was, many years ago, that the Supreme Court was\r\nthe judge. That was their doctrine in 1800. They denounced Madison\r\nfor the report of 1799, on the Virginia resolutions; they denounced\r\nJefferson for framing the Kentucky resolutions, because they were\r\npresumed to impugn the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; and they declared that that court was made, by the Constitution,\r\nthe ultimate and supreme arbiter. That was the universal judgment--the\r\ndeclaration of every free State in this Union, in answer to the Virginia\r\nresolutions of 1798, or of all who did answer, even including the State\r\nof Delaware, then under Federal control.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court have decided that, by the Constitution, we have a\r\nright to go to the Territories and be protected there with our property.\r\nYou say, we cannot decide the compact for ourselves. Well, can the\r\nSupreme Court decide it for us? Mr. Lincoln says he does not care what\r\nthe Supreme Court decides, he will turn us out anyhow. He says this in\r\nhis debate with the honorable member from Illinois [Mr. Douglas]. I have\r\nit before me. He said he would vote against the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt. Then you did not accept that arbiter. You will not take my\r\nconstruction; you will not take the Supreme Court as an arbiter; you\r\nwill not take the practice of the government; you will not take the\r\ntreaties under Jefferson and Madison; you will not take the opinion of\r\nMadison upon the very question of prohibition in 1820. What, then, will\r\nyou take? You will take nothing but your own judgment; that is, you will\r\nnot only judge for yourselves, not only discard the court, discard our\r\nconstruction, discard the practice of the government, but you will drive\r\nus out, simply because you will it. Come and do it! You have sapped the\r\nfoundations of society; you have destroyed almost all hope of peace. In\r\na compact where there is no common arbiter, where the parties finally\r\ndecide for themselves, the sword alone at last becomes the real, if not\r\nthe constitutional, arbiter. Your party says that you will not take the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court. You said so at Chicago; you said so in\r\ncommittee; every man of you in both Houses says so. What are you going\r\nto do? You say we shall submit to your construction. We shall do it,\r\nif you can make us; but not otherwise, or in any other manner. That is\r\nsettled. You may call it secession, or you may call it revolution; but\r\nthere is a big fact standing before you, ready to oppose you--that fact\r\nis, freemen with arms in their hands. The cry of the Union will not\r\ndisperse them; we have passed that point; they demand equal rights; you\r\nhad better heed the demand. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SULLIVAN COX,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO. (BORN, 1824-DIED, 1889.)\r\n\r\nON SECESSION; DOUGLAS DEMOCRATIC OPINION;\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 14, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nI speak from and for the capital of the greatest of the States of the\r\ngreat West. That potential section is beginning to be appalled at the\r\ncolossal strides of revolution. It has immense interests at stake in\r\nthis Union, as well from its position as its power and patriotism. We\r\nhave had infidelity to the Union before, but never in such a fearful\r\nshape. We had it in the East during the late war with England. Even so\r\nlate as the admission of Texas, Massachusetts resolved herself out of\r\nthe Union. That resolution has never been repealed, and one would infer,\r\nfrom much of her conduct, that she did not regard herself as bound by\r\nour covenant. Since 1856, in the North, we have had infidelity to the\r\nUnion, more insidious infractions of the Constitution than by\r\nopen rebellion. Now, sir, as a consequence, in part, of these very\r\ninfractions, we have rebellion itself, open and daring, in terrific\r\nproportions, with dangers so formidable as to seem almost remediless. *\r\n* *'\r\n\r\nI would not exaggerate the fearful consequences of dissolution. It is\r\nthe breaking up of a federative Union, but it is not like the breaking\r\nup of society. It is not anarchy. A link may fall from the chain, and\r\nthe link may still be perfect, though the chain have lost its length and\r\nits strength. In the uniformity of commercial regulations, in matters\r\nof war and peace, postal arrangements, foreign relations, coinage,\r\ncopyrights, tariff, and other Federal and national affairs, this great\r\ngovernment may be broken; but in most of the essential liberties and\r\nrights which government is the agent to establish and protect, the\r\nseceding State has no revolution, and the remaining States can have\r\nnone. This arises from that refinement of our polity which makes the\r\nStates the basis of our instituted labor. Greece was broken by the\r\nPersian power, but her municipal institutions remained. Hungary lost\r\nher national crown, but her home institutions remain. South Carolina may\r\npreserve her constituted domestic authority, but she must be content to\r\nglimmer obscurely remote rather than shine and revolve in a constellated\r\nband. She even goes out by the ordinance of a so-called sovereign\r\nconvention, content to lose by her isolation that youthful, vehement,\r\nexultant, progressive life, which is our NATIONALITY! She foregoes\r\nthe hopes, the boasts, the flag, the music, all the emotions, all the\r\ntraits, and all the energies which, when combined in our United States,\r\nhave won our victories in war and our miracles of national advancement.\r\nHer Governor, Colonel Pickens, in his inaugural, regretfully \"looks\r\nback upon the inheritance South Carolina had in the common glories\r\nand triumphant power of this wonderful confederacy, and fails to find\r\nlanguage to express the feelings of the human heart as he turns from the\r\ncontemplation.\" The ties of brotherhood, interest, lineage, and history\r\nare all to be severed. No longer are we to salute a South Carolinian\r\nwith the \"_idem sententiam de republica_,\" which makes unity and\r\nnationality. What a prestige and glory are here dimmed and lost in the\r\ncontaminated reason of man!\r\n\r\nCan we realize it? Is it a masquerade, to last for a night, or a reality\r\nto be dealt with, with the world's rough passionate handling? It is sad\r\nand bad enough; but let us not over-tax our anxieties about it as yet.\r\nIt is not the sanguinary regime of the French revolution; not the rule\r\nof assignats and guillotine; not the cry of \"_Vivent les Rouges! A mort\r\nles gendarmes!_\" but as yet, I hope I may say, the peaceful attempt\r\nto withdraw from the burdens and benefits of the Republic. Thus it is\r\nunlike every other revolution. Still it is revolution. It may, according\r\nas it is managed, involve consequences more terrific than any revolution\r\nsince government began.\r\n\r\nIf the Federal Government is to be maintained, its strength must not\r\nbe frittered away by conceding the theory of secession. To concede\r\nsecession as a right, is to make its pathway one of roses and not of\r\nthorns. I would not make its pathway so easy. If the government has any\r\nstrength for its own preservation, the people demand it should be put\r\nforth in its civil and moral forces. Dealing, however, with a sensitive\r\npublic sentiment, in which this strength reposes, it must not be rudely\r\nexercised. It should be the iron hand in the glove of velvet. Firmness\r\nshould be allied with kindness. Power should assert its own prerogative,\r\nbut in the name of law and love. If these elements are not thus blended\r\nin our policy, as the Executive proposes, our government will prove\r\neither a garment of shreds or a coat of mail. We want neither. * * *\r\n\r\nBefore we enter upon a career of force, let us exhaust every effort\r\nat peace. Let us seek to excite love in others by the signs of love in\r\nourselves. Let there be no needless provocation and strife. Let every\r\nreasonable attempt at compromise be considered. Otherwise we have a\r\nterrible alternative. War, in this age and in this country, sir, should\r\nbe the _ultima ratio_. Indeed, it may well be questioned whether there\r\nis any reason in it for war. What a war! Endless in its hate, without\r\ntruce and without mercy. If it ended ever, it would only be after a\r\nfearful struggle; and then with a heritage of hate which would forever\r\nforbid harmony. * * *\r\n\r\nSmall States and great States; new States and old States; slave States\r\nand free States; Atlantic States and Pacific States; gold and silver\r\nStates; iron and copper States; grain States and lumber States; river\r\nStates and lake States;--all having varied interests and advantages,\r\nwould seek superiority in armed strength. Pride, animosity, and glory\r\nwould inspire every movement. God shield our country from such a\r\nfulfilment of the prophecy of the revered founders of the Union! Our\r\nstruggle would be no short, sharp struggle. Law, and even religion\r\nherself, would become false to their divine purpose. Their voice would\r\nno longer be the voice of God, but of his enemy. Poverty, ignorance,\r\noppression, and its hand-maid, cowardice, breaking out into merciless\r\ncruelty; slaves false; freemen slaves, and society itself poisoned\r\nat the cradle and dishonored at the grave;--its life, now so full\r\nof blessings, would be gone with the life of a fraternal and united\r\nStatehood. What sacrifice is too great to prevent such a calamity? Is\r\nsuch a picture overdrawn? Already its outlines appear. What means the\r\ninaugural of Governor Pickens, when he says: \"From the position we may\r\noccupy toward the Northern States, as well as from our own internal\r\nstructure of society, the government may, from necessity, become\r\nstrongly military in its organization\"? What mean the minute-men\r\nof Governor Wise? What the Southern boast that they have a rifle or\r\nshot-gun to each family?\r\n\r\nWhat means the Pittsburgh mob? What this alacrity to save Forts Moultrie\r\nand Pinckney? What means the boast of the Southern men of being the\r\nbest-armed people in the world, not counting the two hundred thousand\r\nstand of United States arms stored in Southern arsenals? Already Georgia\r\nhas her arsenals, with eighty thousand muskets. What mean these lavish\r\ngrants of money by Southern Legislatures to buy more arms? What mean\r\nthese rumors of arms and force on the Mississippi? These few facts have\r\nalready verified the prophecy of Madison as to a disunited Republic.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, he alone is just to his country, he alone has a mind\r\nunwarped by section, and a memory unparalyzed by fear, who warns against\r\nprecipitancy. He who could hurry this nation to the rash wager of\r\nbattle is not fit to hold the seat of legislation. What can justify the\r\nbreaking up of our institutions into belligerent fractions? Better this\r\nmarble Capitol were levelled to the dust; better were this Congress\r\nstruck dead in its deliberations; better an immolation of every ambition\r\nand passion which here have met to shake the foundations of society\r\nthan the hazard of these consequences! * * * I appeal to Southern men,who\r\ncontemplate a step so fraught with hazard and strife, to pause. Clouds\r\nare about us! There is lightning in their frown! Cannot we direct it\r\nharmlessly to the earth? The morning and evening prayer of the people I\r\nspeak for in such weakness rises in strength to that Supreme Ruler\r\nwho, in noticing the fall of a sparrow, cannot disregard the fall of a\r\nnation, that our States may continue to be as they have been--one; one\r\nin the unreserve of a mingled national being; one as the thought of God\r\nis one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS,\r\n\r\nOF MISSISSIPPI. (BORN 1808, DIED 1889.)\r\n\r\nON WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNION; SECESSIONIST OPINION;\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE, JANUARY 21, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rise, Mr. President, for the purpose of announcing to the Senate that\r\nI have satisfactory evidence that the State of Mississippi, by a solemn\r\nordinance of her people in convention assembled, has declared her\r\nseparation from the United States. Under these circumstances, of course\r\nmy functions are terminated here. It has seemed to me proper, however,\r\nthat I should appear in the Senate to announce that fact to my\r\nassociates, and I will say but very little more. The occasion does\r\nnot invite me to go into argument, and my physical condition would not\r\npermit me to do so if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become\r\nme to say something on the part of the State I here represent, on an\r\noccasion so solemn as this.\r\n\r\nIt is known to Senators who have served with me here, that I have for\r\nmany years advocated, as an essential attribute of State sovereignty,\r\nthe right of a State to secede from the Union. Therefore, if I had not\r\nbelieved there was justifiable cause; if I had thought that Mississippi\r\nwas acting without sufficient provocation, or without an existing\r\nnecessity, I should still, under my theory of the Government, because of\r\nmy allegiance to the State of which I am a citizen, have been bound by\r\nher action. I, however, may be permitted to say that I do think that she\r\nhas justifiable cause, and I approve of her act. I conferred with her\r\npeople before that act was taken, counselled them then that if the state\r\nof things which they apprehended should exist when the convention met,\r\nthey should take the action which they have now adopted.\r\n\r\nI hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine with\r\nthe advocacy of the right of a State to remain in the Union, and to\r\ndisregard its constitutional obligations by the nullification of the\r\nlaw. Such is not my theory. Nullification and secession, so often\r\nconfounded, are indeed antagonistic principles. Nullification is a\r\nremedy which it is sought to apply within the Union, and against the\r\nagent of the States. It is only to be justified when the agent has\r\nviolated his constitutional obligation, and a State, assuming to judge\r\nfor itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals\r\nto the other States of the Union for a decision; but when the States\r\nthemselves, and when the people of the States, have so acted as to\r\nconvince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then,\r\nand then for the first time, arises the doctrine of secession in its\r\npractical application.\r\n\r\nA great man who now reposes with his fathers, and who has been often\r\narraigned for a want of fealty to the Union, advocated the doctrine of\r\nnullification, because it preserved the Union. It was because of his\r\ndeep-seated attachment to the Union, his determination to find some\r\nremedy for existing ills short of a severance of the ties which bound\r\nSouth Carolina to the other States, that Mr. Calhoun advocated the\r\ndoctrine of nullification, which he proclaimed to be peaceful, to be\r\nwithin the limits of State power, not to disturb the Union, but only to\r\nbe a means of bringing the agent before the tribunal of the States for\r\ntheir judgment.\r\n\r\nSecession belongs to a different class of remedies. It is to be\r\njustified upon the basis that the States are sovereign. There was a\r\ntime when none denied it. I hope the time may come again, when a better\r\ncomprehension of the theory of our Government, and the inalienable\r\nrights of the people of the States, will prevent any one from denying\r\nthat each State is a sovereign, and thus may reclaim the grants which it\r\nhas made to any agent whomsoever.\r\n\r\nI therefore say I concur in the action of the people of Mississippi,\r\nbelieving it to be necessary and proper, and should have been bound by\r\ntheir action if my belief had been otherwise; and this brings me to the\r\nimportant point which I wish on this last occasion to present to the\r\nSenate. It is by this confounding of nullification and secession that\r\nthe name of the great man, whose ashes now mingle with his mother earth,\r\nhas been invoked to justify coercion against a seceded State. The phrase\r\n\"to execute the laws,\" was an expression which General Jackson applied\r\nto the case of a State refusing to obey the laws while yet a member of\r\nthe Union. That is not the case which is now presented. The laws are to\r\nbe executed over the United States, and upon the people of the United\r\nStates. They have no relation to any foreign country. It is a perversion\r\nof terms, at least it is a great misapprehension of the case, which\r\ncites that expression for application to a State which has withdrawn\r\nfrom the Union. You may make war on a foreign State. If it be the\r\npurpose of gentlemen, they may make war against a State which has\r\nwithdrawn from the Union; but there are no laws of the United States\r\nto be executed within the limits of a seceded State. A State finding\r\nherself in the condition in which Mississippi has judged she is, in\r\nwhich her safety requires that she should provide for the maintenance of\r\nher rights out of the Union, surrenders all the benefits (and they are\r\nknown to be many), deprives herself of the advantages (they are known\r\nto be great), severs all the ties of affection (and they are close and\r\nenduring) which have bound her to the Union; and thus divesting herself\r\nof every benefit, taking upon herself every burden, she claims to be\r\nexempt from any power to execute the laws of the United States within\r\nher limits.\r\n\r\nI well remember an occasion when Massachusetts was arraigned before the\r\nbar of the Senate, and when then the doctrine of coercion was rife and\r\nto be applied against her because of the rescue of a fugitive slave in\r\nBoston. My opinion then was the same that it is now. Not in a spirit of\r\negotism, but to show that I am not influenced in my opinion because the\r\ncase is my own, I refer to that time and that occasion as containing\r\nthe opinion which I then entertained, and on which my present conduct\r\nis based. I then said, if Massachusetts, following her through a stated\r\nline of conduct, chooses to take the last step which separates her from\r\nthe Union, it is her right to go, and I will neither vote one dollar or\r\none man to coerce her back; but will say to her, God speed, in memory\r\nof the kind associations which once existed between her and the other\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt has been a conviction of pressing necessity, it has been a belief\r\nthat we are to be deprived in the Union of the rights which our fathers\r\nbequeathed to us, which has brought Mississippi into her present\r\ndecision. She has heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created\r\nfree and equal, and this made the basis of an attack upon her social\r\ninstitutions; and the sacred Declaration of Independence has been\r\ninvoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races. That\r\nDeclaration of Independence is to be construed by the circumstances and\r\npurposes for which it was made. The communities were declaring their\r\nindependence; the people of those communities were asserting that no man\r\nwas born--to use the language of Mr. Jefferson--booted and spurred to\r\nride over the rest of mankind; that men were created equal--meaning the\r\nmen of the political community; that there was no divine right to rule;\r\nthat no man inherited the right to govern; that there were no classes by\r\nwhich power and place descended to families, but that all stations were\r\nequally within the grasp of each member of the body-politic. These were\r\nthe great principles they announced; these were the purposes for\r\nwhich they made their declaration; these were the end to which their\r\nenunciation was directed. They have no reference to the slave; else, how\r\nhappened it that among the items of arraignment made against George III.\r\nwas that he endeavored to do just what the North had been endeavoring\r\nof late to do--to stir up insurrection among our slaves? Had the\r\nDeclaration announced that the negroes were free and equal, how was the\r\nPrince to be arraigned for stirring up insurrection among them? And\r\nhow was this to be enumerated among the high crimes which caused the\r\ncolonies to sever their connection with the mother country? When our\r\nConstitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable, for\r\nthere we find provision made for that very class of persons as property;\r\nthey were not put upon the footing of equality with white men--not even\r\nupon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation was\r\nconcerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be\r\nrepresented in the numerical proportion of three-fifths.\r\n\r\nThen, Senators, we recur to the compact which binds us together; we\r\nrecur to the principles upon which our Government was founded; and when\r\nyou deny them, and when you deny to us the right to withdraw from a\r\nGovernment which, thus perverted, threatens to be destructive of our\r\nrights, we but tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our\r\nindependence, and take the hazard. This is done not in hostility to\r\nothers, not to injure any section of the country, not even for our own\r\npecuniary benefit; but from the high and solemn motive of defending and\r\nprotecting the rights we inherited, and which it is our sacred duty to\r\ntransmit unshorn to our children.\r\n\r\nI find in myself, perhaps, a type of the general feeling of my\r\nconstituents towards yours. I am sure I feel no hostility to you,\r\nSenators from the North. I am sure there is not one of you, whatever\r\nsharp discussion there may have been between us, to whom I cannot now\r\nsay, in the presence of my God, I wish you well; and such, I am sure,\r\nis the feeling of the people whom I represent towards those whom you\r\nrepresent. I therefore feel that I but express their desire when I say\r\nI hope, and they hope, for peaceful relations with you, though we must\r\npart. They may be mutually beneficial to us in the future, as they have\r\nbeen in the past, if you so will it. The reverse may bring disaster\r\non every portion of the country; and if you will have it thus, we will\r\ninvoke the God of our fathers, who delivered them from the power of the\r\nlion, to protect us from the ravages of the bear; and thus, putting\r\nour trust in God, and in our own firm hearts and strong arms, we will\r\nvindicate the right as best we may.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my service here, associated at different times with\r\na great variety of Senators, I see now around me some with whom I\r\nhave served long; there have been points of collision; but whatever of\r\noffense there has been to me, I leave here; I carry with me no hostile\r\nremembrance. Whatever offense I have given which has not been redressed,\r\nor for which satisfaction has not been demanded, I have, Senators, in\r\nthis hour of our parting to offer you my apology for any pain which,\r\nin heat of discussion, I have inflicted. I go hence unencumbered of the\r\nremembrance of any injury received, and having discharged the duty of\r\nmaking the only reparation in my power for any injury offered.\r\n\r\nMr. President, and Senators, having made the announcement which the\r\noccasion seemed to me to require, it only remains for me to bid you a\r\nfinal adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's American Eloquence, Volume III.
