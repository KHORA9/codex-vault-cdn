THE LAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nNESTA AND HER FATHER\r\n\r\nThe day of Nesta's return was one of a number of late when Victor was\r\nrobbed of his walk Westward by Lady Grace Halley, who seduced his\r\npoliteness with her various forms of blandishment to take a seat in her\r\ncarriage; and she was a practical speaker upon her quarter of the world\r\nwhen she had him there.  Perhaps she was right in saying--though she had\r\nno right to say--that he and she together might have the world under\r\ntheir feet.  It was one of those irritating suggestions which expedite us\r\nup to a bald ceiling, only to make us feel the gas-bladder's tight\r\nextension upon emptiness: It moved him to examine the poor value of his\r\naim, by tying him to the contemptible means: One estimate involved the\r\nother, whichever came first.  Somewhere he had an idea, that would lift\r\nand cleanse all degradations.  But it did seem as if he were not\r\nenjoying: things pleasant enough in the passage of them were barren, if\r\nnot prickly, in the retrospect.\r\n\r\nHe sprang out at the head of the park, for a tramp round it, in the gloom\r\nof the girdle of lights, to recover his deadened relish of the thin\r\nphantasmal strife to win an intangible prize.  His dulled physical system\r\nasked, as with the sensations of a man at the start from sleep in the\r\nhurrying grip of steam, what on earth he wanted to get, and what was the\r\nsubstance of his gains: what! if other than a precipitous intimacy, a\r\ndeep crumbling over deeper, with a little woman amusing him in remarks of\r\na whimsical nudity; hardly more.  Nay, not more!  he said; and at the end\r\nof twenty paces, he saw much more; the campaign gathered a circling\r\nsuggestive brilliancy, like the lamps about the winter park; the Society,\r\nlured with glitter, hooked by greed, composed a ravishing picture; the\r\nlittle woman was esteemed as a serviceable lieutenant; and her hand was\r\na small soft one, agreeable to fondle--and avaunt!  But so it is in war:\r\nwe must pay for our allies.  What if it had been, that he and she\r\ntogether, with their united powers .  .  . ?  He dashed the silly vision\r\naside, as vainer than one of the bubble-empires blown by boys; and it\r\nbroke, showing no heart in it.  His heart was Nataly's.\r\n\r\nLet Colney hint his worst; Nataly bore the strain, always did bear any\r\nstrain coming in the round of her duties: and if she would but walk,\r\nor if she danced at parties, she would scatter the fits of despondency\r\nbesetting the phlegmatic, like this day's breeze the morning fog; or as\r\nhe did with two minutes of the stretch of legs.\r\n\r\nFull of the grandeur of that black pit of the benighted London, with its\r\nocean-voice of the heart at beat along the lighted outer ring, Victor\r\nentered at his old door of the two houses he had knocked into one: a\r\nsurprise for Fredi!--and heard that his girl had arrived in the morning.\r\n\r\n'And could no more endure her absence from her Mammy O!' The songful\r\nsatirical line spouted in him, to be flung at his girl, as he ran\r\nupstairs to the boudoir off the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHe peeped in.  It was dark.  Sensible of presences, he gradually\r\ndiscerned a thick blot along the couch to the right of the door, and he\r\ndrew near.  Two were lying folded together; mother and daughter.  He bent\r\nover them.  His hand was taken and pressed by Fredi's; she spoke; she\r\nsaid tenderly: 'Father.'  Neither of the two made a movement.  He heard\r\nthe shivering rise of a sob, that fell.  The dry sob going to the waste\r\nbreath was Nataly's.  His girl did not speak again.\r\n\r\nHe left them.  He had no thought until he stood in his dressing-room,\r\nwhen he said 'Good!' For those two must have been lying folded together\r\nduring the greater part of the day: and it meant, that the mother's heart\r\nhad opened; the girl knew.  Her tone: 'Father,' sweet, was heavy, too,\r\nwith the darkness it came out of.\r\n\r\nSo she knew.  Good.  He clasped them both in his heart; tempering his\r\npity of those dear ones with the thought, that they were of the sex\r\nwhich finds enjoyment in a day of the mutual tear; and envying them;\r\nhe strained at a richness appearing in the sobs of their close union.\r\n\r\nAll of his girl's loving soul flew to her mother; and naturally: She\r\nwould not be harsh on her father.  She would say he loved!  And true:\r\nhe did love, he does love; loves no woman but the dear mother.\r\n\r\nHe flicked a short wring of the hand having taken pressure from an alien\r\nwoman's before Fredi pressed it, and absolved himself in the act;\r\nthinking, How little does a woman know how true we can be to her when we\r\nsmell at a flower here and there!--There they are, stationary; women the\r\nflowers, we the bee; and we are faithful in our seeming volatility;\r\nfaithful to the hive!--And if women are to be stationary, the reasoning\r\nis not so bad.  Funny, however, if they here and there imitatively spread\r\na wing, and treat men in that way?  It is a breach of the convention; we\r\npay them our homage, that they may serve as flowers, not to be volatile\r\ntempters.  Nataly never had been one of the sort: Lady Grace was.  No\r\nnecessity existed for compelling the world to bow to Lady Grace, while on\r\nbehalf of his Nataly he had to .  .  .  Victor closed the curtain over a\r\ngulf-revealed by an invocation of Nature, and showing the tremendous\r\nforce he partook of so largely, in her motive elements of the devourer.\r\nHorrid to behold, when we need a gracious presentation of the\r\ncircumstances.  She is a splendid power for as long as we confine her\r\nbetween the banks: but she has a passion to discover cracks; and if we\r\ngive her headway, she will find one, and drive at it, and be through,\r\nuproarious in her primitive licentiousness, unless we labour body and\r\nsoul like Dutchmen at the dam.  Here she was, and not desired, almost\r\ndetested!  Nature detested!  It had come about through the battle for\r\nNataly; chiefly through Mrs. Burman's tenacious hold of the filmy thread\r\nshe took for life and was enabled to use as a means for the perversion\r\nbesides bar to the happiness of creatures really living.  We may well\r\nmarvel at the Fates, and tell them they are not moral agents!\r\n\r\nVictor's reflections came across Colney Durance, who tripped and stopped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDressed with his customary celerity, he waited for Nesta, to show her the\r\nlighted grand double drawing-room: a further proof of how Fortune\r\nfavoured him: she was to be told, how he one day expressed a wish for\r\ngreater space, and was informed on the next, that the neighbour house was\r\nbeing vacated, and the day following he was in treaty for the purchase of\r\nit; returning from Tyrol, he found his place habitable.\r\n\r\nNesta came.  Her short look at him was fond, her voice not faltering; she\r\nlaid her hand under his arm and walked round the spacious room, praising\r\nthe general design, admiring the porcelain, the ferns, friezes, hangings,\r\nand the grand piano, the ebony inlaid music-stands, the firegrates and\r\nplaques, the ottomans, the tone of neutral colour that, as in sound,\r\nmuted splendour.  He told her it was a reception night, with music: and\r\nadded: 'I miss my .  .  .  seen anybody lately?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sowerby?' said she.  'He was to have escorted me back.  He may have\r\noverslept himself.'\r\n\r\nShe spoke it plainly; when speaking of the dear good ladies, she set a\r\ngentle humour at play, and comforted him, as she intended, with a\r\nsouvenir of her lively spirit, wanting only in the manner of gaiety.\r\n\r\nHe allowed, that she could not be quite gay.\r\n\r\nMore deeply touched the next minute, he felt in her voice, in her look,\r\nin her phrasing of speech, an older, much older daughter than the Fredi\r\nwhom he had conducted to Moorsedge.  'Kiss me,' he said.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him full-front, and kissed his right cheek and left, and\r\nhis forehead, saying: 'My love!  my papa!  my own dear dada!' all the\r\nwords of her girlhood in her new sedateness; and smiling: like the moral\r\ncrepuscular of a sunlighted day down a not totally inanimate Sunday\r\nLonden street.\r\n\r\nHe strained her to his breast.  'Mama soon be here?'\r\n\r\n'Soon.'\r\n\r\nThat was well.  And possibly at the present moment applying, with her\r\ncunning hand, the cosmetics and powders he could excuse for a concealment\r\nof the traces of grief.\r\n\r\nSatisfied in being a superficial observer, he did not spy to see more\r\nthan the world would when Nataly entered the dining-room at the quiet\r\nfamily dinner.  She performed her part for his comfort, though not\r\nprattling; and he missed his Fredi's delicious warble of the prattle\r\nrunning rill-like over our daily humdrum.  Simeon Fenellan would have\r\nhelped.  Then suddenly came enlivenment: a recollection of news in the\r\nmorning's paper.  'No harm before Fredi, my dear.  She's a young woman\r\nnow.  And no harm, so to speak-at least, not against the Sanfredini.\r\nShe has donned her name again, and a villa on Como, leaving her 'duque';\r\n--paragraph from a Milanese musical Journal; no particulars.  Now, mark\r\nme, we shall have her at Lakelands in the Summer.  If only we could have\r\nher now!'\r\n\r\n'It would be a pleasure,' said Nataly.  Her heart had a blow in the\r\nthought, that a lady of this kind would create the pleasure by not\r\nbringing criticism.\r\n\r\n'The godmother?' he glistened upon Nesta.\r\n\r\nShe gave him low half-notes of the little blue butterfly's imitation of\r\nthe superb contralto; and her hand and head at turn to hint the\r\ntheatrical operatic attitude.\r\n\r\n'Delicious!' he cried, his eyelids were bedewed at the vision of the\r\nthree of them planted in the past; and here again, out of the dark wood,\r\nwhere something had required to be said, and had been said; and all was\r\nhappily over, owing to the goodness and sweetness of the two dear\r\ninnocents;--whom heaven bless!  Jealousy of their naturally closer heart-\r\nat-heart, had not a whisper for him; part of their goodness and sweetness\r\nwas felt to be in the not excluding him.\r\n\r\nNesta engaged to sing one of the 'old duets with her mother.  She saw her\r\nmother's breast lift in a mechanical effort to try imaginary notes, as if\r\ndoubtful of her capacity, more at home in the dumb deep sigh they fell\r\nto.  Her mother's heroism made her a sacred woman to the thoughts of the\r\ngirl, overcoming wonderment at the extreme submissiveness.\r\n\r\nShe put a screw on her mind to perceive the rational object there might\r\nbe for causing her mother to go through tortures in receiving and\r\nvisiting; and she was arrested by the louder question, whether she could\r\nthink such a man as her father irrational.\r\n\r\nPeople with resounding names, waves of a steady stream, were announced by\r\nArlington, just as in the days, that seemed remote, before she went to\r\nMoorsedge; only they were more numerous, and some of the titles had\r\nascended a stage.  There were great lords, there were many great ladies;\r\nand Lady Grace Halley shuffling amid them, like a silken shimmer in\r\nvoluminous robes.\r\n\r\nThey crowded about their host where he stood.  'He, is their Law!' Colney\r\nsaid, speaking unintelligibly, in the absence of the Simeon Fenellan\r\nregretted so loudly by Mr. Beaves Urmsing.  They had an air of\r\nworshipping, and he of swimming.\r\n\r\nThere were also City magnates, and Lakelands' neighbours: the gentleman\r\nrepresenting Pride of Port, Sir Abraham Quatley; and Colonel Corfe; Sir\r\nRodwell and Lady Blachington; Mrs. Fanning; Mr. Caddis.  Few young men\r\nand maids were seen.  Dr. John Cormyn came without his wife, not\r\nmentioning her.  Mrs. Peter Yatt touched the notes for voices at the\r\npiano.  Priscilla Graves was a vacancy, and likewise the Rev. Septimus\r\nBarmby.  Peridon and Catkin, and Mr. Pempton took their usual places.\r\nThere was no fluting.  A famous Canadian lady was the principal singer.\r\nA Galician violinist, zig-zagging extreme extensions and contractions of\r\nhis corporeal frame in execution, and described by Colney as 'Paganini on\r\nwall,' failed to supplant Durandarte in Nesta's memory.  She was asked by\r\nLady Grace for the latest of Dudley.  Sir Abraham Quatley named him with\r\nhandsome emphasis.  Great dames caressed her; openly approved; shadowed\r\nthe future place among them.\r\n\r\nVictor alluded at night to Mrs. John Cormyn's absence.  He said: 'A\r\nhomoeopathic doctor's wife!' nothing more; and by that little, he\r\nprepared Nesta for her mother's explanation.  The great London people,\r\nignorant or not, were caught by the strong tide he created, and carried\r\non it.  But there was a bruiting of the secret among their set; and the\r\none to fall away from her, Nataly marvellingly named Mrs. John Cormyn;\r\nwhose marriage was of her making.  She did not disapprove Priscilla's\r\nbehaviour.  Priscilla had come to her and, protesting affection, had\r\nopenly stated, that she required time and retirement to recover her\r\nproper feelings.  Nataly smiled a melancholy criticism of an inconsequent\r\nor capricious woman, in relating to Nesta certain observations Priscilla\r\nhad dropped upon poor faithful Mr. Pempton, because of his concealment\r\nfrom her of his knowledge of things for this faithful gentleman had been\r\none of the few not ignorant.  The rumour was traceable to the City.\r\n\r\n'Mother, we walk on planks,' Nesta said.\r\n\r\nNataly answered: 'You will grow used to it.'\r\n\r\nHer mother's habitual serenity in martyrdom was deceiving.  Nesta had a\r\ntransient suspicion, that she had grown, from use, to like the whirl of\r\ncompany, for oblivion in the excitement; and as her remembrance of her\r\nown station among the crowding people was a hot flush, the difference of\r\ntheir feelings chilled her.\r\n\r\nNataly said: 'It is to-morrow night again; we do not rest.'  She smiled;\r\nand at once the girl read woman's armour on the dear face, and asked\r\nherself, Could I be so brave?  The question following was a speechless\r\nwave, that surged at her father.  She tried to fathom the scheme he\r\nentertained.  The attempt obscured her conception of the man he was.  She\r\ncould not grasp him, being too young for knowing, that young heads cannot\r\nobtain a critical hold upon one whom they see grandly succeeding it is\r\nthe sun's brilliance to their eyes.\r\n\r\nMother and daughter slept together that night, and their embrace was\r\ntheir world.\r\n\r\nNesta delighted her father the next day by walking beside him into the,\r\nCity, as far as the end of the Embankment, where the carriage was in\r\nwaiting with her maid to bring her back; and at his mere ejaculation of a\r\nwish, the hardy girl drove down in the afternoon for the walk home with\r\nhim.  Lady Grace Halley was at the office.  'I'm an incorrigible Stock\r\nExchange gambler,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Only,' Victor bade her beware, 'Mines are undulating in movement, and\r\ntheir heights are a preparation for their going down.'\r\n\r\nShe said she 'liked a swing.'\r\n\r\nNesta looked at them in turn.\r\n\r\nThe day after and the day after, Lady Grace was present.  She made play\r\nwith Dudley's name.\r\n\r\nThis coming into the City daily of a girl, for the sake of walking back\r\nin winter weather with her father, struck her as ambiguous: either a\r\njealous foolish mother's device, or that of a weak man beating about for\r\nprotection.  But the woman of the positive world soon read to the\r\ncontrary; helped a little by the man, no doubt.  She read rather too much\r\nto the contrary, and took the pedestrian girl for perfect simplicity in\r\nher tastes, when Nesta had so far grown watchful as to feel relieved by\r\nthe lady's departure.  Her mother, without sympathy for the lady, was too\r\ngreat of soul for jealousy.  Victor had his Nataly before him at a hint\r\nfrom Lady Grace: and he went somewhat further than the exact degree when\r\naffirming, that Nataly could not scheme, and was incapable of\r\nsuspecting.--Nataly could perceive things with a certain accuracy: she\r\nwould not stoop to a meanness.  'Plot?  Nataly?' said he, and shrugged.\r\nIn fact, the void of plot, drama, shuffle of excitement, reflected upon\r\nNataly.  He might have seen as tragic as ever dripped on Stage, had he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\nBut the walk Westward with his girl, together with pride in a daughter\r\nwho clove her way through all weathers, won his heart to exultation.\r\nHe told her: 'Fredi does her dada so much good'; not telling her in what,\r\nor opening any passage to the mystery of the man he was.  She was trying\r\nto be a student of life, with her eyes down upon hard earth, despite of\r\nher winged young head; she would have compassed him better had he dilated\r\nin sublime fashion; but he baffled her perusal of a man of power by the\r\nsimpleness of his enjoyment of small things coming in his way;--the\r\nlighted shops, the crowd, emergence from the crowd, or the meeting near\r\nmidwinter of a soft warm wind along the Embankment, and dark Thames\r\nmagnificently coroneted over his grimy flow.  There is no grasping of one\r\nwho quickens us.\r\n\r\nHis flattery of his girl, too, restored her broken feeling of personal\r\nvalue; it permeated her nourishingly from the natural breath of him that\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nAt times he touched deep in humaneness; and he set her heart leaping on\r\nthe flash of a thought to lay it bare, with the secret it held, for his\r\nhelp.  That was a dream.  She could more easily have uttered the words to\r\nCaptain Dartrey, after her remembered abashing holy tremour of the vision\r\nof doing it and casting herself on noblest man's compassionateness; and\r\nher imagined thousand emotions;--a rolling music within her, a wreath of\r\ncloudglory in her sky;--which had, as with virgins it may be, plighted\r\nher body to him for sheer urgency of soul; drawn her by a single\r\nunwitting-to-brain, conscious-in-blood, shy curl outward of the sheathing\r\nleaf to the flowering of woman to him; even to the shore of that strange\r\nsea, where the maid stands choosing this one man for her destiny, as in a\r\ntrance.  So are these young ones unfolded, shade by shade; and a shade is\r\nall the difference with them; they can teach the poet to marvel at the\r\nimmensity of vitality in 'the shadow of a shade.'\r\n\r\nHer father shut the glimpse of a possible speaking to him of Mrs.\r\nMarsett, with a renewal of his eulogistic allusions to Dudley Sowerby:\r\nthe 'perfect gentleman, good citizen'; prospective heir to an earldom\r\nbesides.  She bowed to Dudley's merits; she read off the honorific\r\npedimental letters of a handsome statue, for a sign to herself that she\r\npassed it.\r\n\r\nShe was unjust, as Victor could feel, though he did not know how coldly\r\nunjust.  For among the exorbitant requisitions upon their fellow-\r\ncreatures made by the young, is the demand, that they be definite: no\r\nmercy is in them for the transitional.  And Dudley--and it was under her\r\ninfluence, and painfully, not ignobly--was in process of development:\r\ninteresting to philosophers, if not to maidens.\r\n\r\nVictor accused her of paying too much heed to Colney Durance's epigrams\r\nupon their friends.  He quite joined with his English world in its\r\nopinion, that epigrams are poor squibs when they do not come out of great\r\nguns.  Epigrams fired at a venerable nation, are surely the poorest of\r\npopgun paper pellets.  The English kick at the insolence, when they are\r\nnot in the mood for pelleting themselves, or when the armed Foreigner is\r\novershadowing and braceing.  Colney's pretentious and laboured Satiric\r\nProse Epic of 'THE RIVAL TONGUES,' particularly offended him, as being a\r\nclever aim at no hitting; and sustained him, inasmuch as it was an acid\r\nfriend's collapse.  How could Colney expect his English to tolerate such\r\na spiteful diatribe!  The suicide of Dr. Bouthoin at San Francisco was\r\nthe finishing stroke to the chances of success of the Serial;--although\r\nwe are promised splendid evolutions on the part of Mr. Semhians; who,\r\nafter brilliant achievements with bat and ball, abandons those weapons of\r\nOld England's modern renown, for a determined wrestle with our English\r\npronunciation of words, and rescue of the spelling of them from the\r\nprinter.  His headache over the present treatment of the verb 'To bid,'\r\nwas a quaint beginning for one who had soon to plead before Japanese, and\r\nwho acknowledged now 'in contrition of spirit,' that in formerly opposing\r\nthe scheme for an Academy, he helped to the handing of our noble language\r\nto the rapid reporter of news for an apathetic public.  Further, he\r\ndiscovered in astonishment the subordination of all literary Americans to\r\nthe decrees of their literary authorities; marking a Transatlantic point\r\nof departure, and contrasting ominously with the unruly Islanders\r\n'grunting the higgledy-piggledy of their various ways, in all the\r\nporker's gut-gamut at the rush to the trough.'  After a week's privation\r\nof bat and ball, he is, lighted or not, a gas-jet of satire upon his\r\ncountrymen.  As for the 'pathetic sublimity of the Funeral of Dr.\r\nBouthoin,' Victor inveighed against an impious irony in the over dose of\r\nthe pathos; and the same might be suspected in Britannia's elegy upon\r\nhim, a strain of hot eulogy throughout.  Mr. Semhians, all but\r\ntreasonably, calls it, Papboat and Brandy:--'our English literary diet of\r\nthe day': stimulating and not nourishing.  Britannia's mournful\r\nanticipation, that 'The shroud enwinding this my son is mine!'--should\r\nthe modern generation depart from the track of him who proved himself the\r\ngiant in mainly supporting her glory--was, no doubt, a high pitch of the\r\nnote of Conservatism.  But considering, that Dr. Bouthoin 'committed\r\nsuicide under a depression of mind produced by a surfeit of unaccustomed\r\ndishes, upon a physical system inspired by the traditions of exercise,\r\nand no longer relieved by the practice'--to translate from Dr. Gannius:\r\nwe are again at war with the writer's reverential tone, and we know not\r\nwhat to think: except, that Mr. Durance was a Saturday meat market's\r\nbutcher in the Satiric Art.\r\n\r\nNesta found it pleasanter to see him than to hear of his work: which, to\r\nher present feeling, was inhuman.  As little as our native public, had\r\nshe then any sympathy for the working in the idea: she wanted throbs,\r\nvisible aims, the Christian incarnate; she would have preferred the tale\r\nof slaughter--periodically invading all English classes as a flush from\r\nthe undrained lower, Vikings all--to frigid sterile Satire.  And truly it\r\nis not a fruit-bearing rod.  Colney had to stand on the defence of it\r\nagainst the damsel's charges.  He thought the use of the rod, while\r\nexpressing profound regret at a difference of opinion between him and\r\nthose noble heathens, beneficial for boys; but in relation to their\r\nseniors, and particularly for old gentlemen, he thought that the sharpest\r\nrod to cut the skin was the sole saving of them.  Insensibility to\r\nSatire, he likened to the hard-mouthed horse; which is doomed to the\r\nworser thing in consequence.  And consequently upon the lack of it, and\r\nof training to appreciate it, he described his country's male venerables\r\nas being distinguishable from annuitant spinsters only in presenting\r\nthemselves forked.\r\n\r\n'He is unsuccessful and embittered, Victor said to Nesta.  'Colney will\r\nfind in the end, that he has lost his game and soured himself by never\r\nmaking concessions.  Here's this absurd Serial--it fails, of course; and\r\nthen he has to say, it's because he won't tickle his English, won't enter\r\ninto a \"frowzy complicity\" with their tastes.'\r\n\r\n'But--I think of Skepsey honest creatures respect Mr. Durance, and he is\r\nalways ready to help them,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'If he can patronize.'\r\n\r\n'Does he patronize me, dada?'\r\n\r\n'You are one of his exceptions.  Marry a title and live in state--and\r\nthen hear him!  I am successful, and the result of it is, that he won't\r\nacknowledge wisdom in anything I say or do; he will hardly acknowledge\r\nthe success.  It is \"a dirty road to success,\" he says.  So that, if\r\nsuccessful, I must have rolled myself in mire.  I compelled him to admit\r\nhe was wrong about your being received at Moorsedge: a bit of a triumph!'\r\n\r\nNesta's walks with her father were no loss of her to Nataly; the girl\r\ncame back to her bearing so fresh and so full a heart; and her father was\r\never prouder of her: he presented new features of her in his quotations\r\nof her sayings, thoughtful sayings.  'I declare she helps one to think,'\r\nhe said.  'It 's not precocity; it 's healthy inquiry.  She brings me\r\nnearer ideas of my own, not yet examined, than any one else does.  I say,\r\nwhat a wife for a man!'\r\n\r\n'She takes my place beside you, dear, now I am not quite strong,' said\r\nNataly.  'You have not seen .  .  .?'\r\n\r\n'Dudley Sowerby?  He's at Cronidge, I believe.  His elder brother's in a\r\nbad way.  Bad business, this looking to a death.'\r\n\r\nNataly eyes revealed a similar gulf.\r\n\r\nLet it be cast on Society, then!  A Society opposing Nature forces us to\r\nthese murderous looks upon impediments.  But what of a Society in the\r\ndance with Nature?  Victor did not approve of that.  He began, under the\r\ninfluence of Nesta's companionship, to see the Goddess Nature there is in\r\na chastened nature.  And this view shook the curtain covering his lost\r\nIdea.  He felt sure he should grasp it soon and enter into its daylight:\r\na muffled voice within him said, that he was kept waiting to do so by the\r\ninexplicable tardiness of a certain one to rise ascending to her\r\nspiritual roost.  She was now harmless to strike: Themison, Carling,\r\nJarniman, even the Rev. Groseman Buttermore, had been won to the cause of\r\nhumanity.  Her ascent, considering her inability to do further harm\r\nbelow, was most mysteriously delayed.  Owing to it, in a manner almost as\r\nmysterious, he was kept crossing a bridge having a slippery bit on it.\r\nThanks to his gallant Fredi, he had found his feet again.  But there was\r\na bruise where, to his honour, he felt tenderest.  And Fredi away, he\r\nmight be down again--for no love of a slippery bit, proved slippery, one\r\nmight guess, by a predecessor or two.  Ta-ta-ta-to and mum!  Still, in\r\njustice to the little woman, she had been serviceable.\r\n\r\nShe would be still more so, if a member of Parliament now on his back\r\nhere we are with the murder-eye again!\r\n\r\nNesta's never speaking of Lakelands clouded him a little, as an\r\nintimation of her bent of mind.\r\n\r\n'And does my girl come to her dada to-day?' he said, on the fifth morning\r\nsince her return; prepared with a villanous resignation to hear, that\r\nthis day she abstained, though he had the wish for her coming.\r\n\r\n'Why, don't you know,' said she, 'we all meet to have tea in Mr.\r\nDurance's chambers; and I walk back with you, and there we are joined\r\nby mama; and we are to have a feast of literary celebrities.'\r\n\r\n'Colney's selection of them!  And Simeon Fenellan, I hope.  Perhaps\r\nDartrey.  Perhaps .  .  .  eh?'\r\n\r\nShe reddened.  So Dudley Sowerby's unspoken name could bring the blush to\r\nher cheeks.  Dudley had his excuses in his brother's condition.  His\r\nfather's health, too, was--but this was Dudley calculating.  Where there\r\nare coronets, calculations of this sort must needs occur; just as where\r\nthere are complications.  Odd, one fancies it, that we walking along the\r\npavement of civilized life, should be perpetually summoning Orcus to our\r\naid, for the sake of getting a clear course.\r\n\r\n'And supposing a fog, my dearie?' he said.\r\n\r\n'The daughter in search of her father carries a lamp to light her to him\r\nthrough densest fogs as well as over deserts,' etc.  She declaimed a long\r\nsentence, to set the ripple running in his features; and when he left the\r\nroom for a last word with Armandine, she flung arms round her mother's\r\nneck, murmuring: 'Mother!  mother!' a cry equal to 'I am sure I do\r\nright,' and understood so by Nataly approving it; she too on the line of\r\nher instinct, without an object in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER-THE DAUGHTER\r\n\r\nTaking Nesta's hand, on her entry into his chambers with her father,\r\nColney Durance bowed over it and kissed it.  The unusual performance had\r\na meaning; she felt she was praised.  It might be because she made\r\nherself her father's companion.  'I can't persuade him to put on a great-\r\ncoat,' she said.  'You would defeat his aim at the particular waistcoat\r\nof his ambition,' said Colney, goaded to speak, not anxious to be heard.\r\n\r\nHe kept her beside him, leading her about for introductions to multiform\r\ncelebrities of both sexes; among them the gentleman editing the Magazine\r\nwhich gave out serially THE RIVAL TONGUES: and there was talk of a\r\ndragon-throated public's queer appetite in Letters.  The pained Editor\r\ndeferentially smiled at her cheerful mention of Delphica.  'In, book\r\nform, perhaps!' he remarked, with plaintive' resignation; adding: 'You\r\nread it?'  And a lady exclaimed: 'We all read it!'\r\n\r\nBut we are the elect, who see signification and catch flavour; and we are\r\nreminded of an insatiable monster how sometimes capricious is his gorge.\r\n'He may happen to be in the humour for a shaking!'  Colney's poor\r\nconsolation it was to say of the prospects of his published book: for the\r\nfunny monster has been known to like a shaking.\r\n\r\n'He takes it kinder tickled,' said Fenellan, joining the group and\r\ngrasping Nesta's hand with a warmth that thrilled her and set her\r\nguessing.  'A taste of his favourite Cayenne lollypop, Colney; it fetches\r\nthe tear he loves to shed, or it gives him digestive heat in the bag of\r\nhis literary receptacle-fearfully relaxed and enormous!  And no wonder;\r\nhis is to lie him down on notion of the attitude for reading, his back;\r\nand he has in a jiffy the funnel of the Libraries inserted into his\r\nmouth, and he feels the publishers pouring their gallons through it\r\nunlimitedly; never crying out, which he can't; only swelling, which he's\r\nobliged to do, with a non-nutritious inflation; and that's his\r\nintellectual enjoyment; bearing a likeness to the horrible old torture of\r\nthe baillir d'eau; and he's doomed to perish in the worst book-form of\r\ndropsy.  You, my dear Colney, have offended his police or excise, who\r\nstand by the funnel, in touch with his palate, to make sure that nothing\r\nabove proof is poured in; and there's your misfortune.  He's not half a\r\nbad fellow, you find when you haven't got to serve him.'\r\n\r\n'Superior to his official parasites, one supposes!' Colney murmured.\r\n\r\nThe celebrities were unaffectedly interested in a literary failure having\r\ncertain merits; they discussed it, to compliment the crownless author;\r\nand the fervider they, the more was he endowed to read the meanness\r\nprompting the generosity.  Publication of a book, is the philosopher's\r\nlantern upon one's fellows.\r\n\r\nColney was caught away from his private manufactory of acids by hearing\r\nSimeon Fenellan relate to Victor some of the recent occurrences at\r\nBrighton.  Simeon's tone was unsatisfying; Colney would have the word;\r\nhe was like steel on the grindstone for such a theme of our national\r\ngrotesque-sublime.\r\n\r\n'That Demerara Supple-jack, Victor!  Don't listen to Simeon; he's a man\r\nof lean narrative, fit to chronicle political party wrangles and such\r\nlike crop of carcase prose: this is epical.  In DRINK we have Old\r\nEngland's organic Epic; Greeks and Trojans; Parliamentary Olympus,\r\nennobled brewers, nasal fanatics, all the machinery to hand.  Keep a\r\nstraight eye on the primary motives of man, you'll own the English\r\nproduce the material for proud verse; they're alive there!  Dartrey's\r\nDemerara makes a pretty episode of the battle.  I haven't seen it--if\r\nit's possible to look on it: but I hear it is flexible, of a vulgar\r\nappearance in repose, Jove's lightning at one time, the thong of AEacus\r\nat another.  Observe Dartrey marching off to the Station, for the purpose\r\nof laying his miraculous weapon across the shoulders of a son of Mars,\r\nwho had offended.  But we have his name, my dear Victor!  His name,\r\nSimeon?--Worrell; a Major Worrell: his offence being probably, that he\r\nobtained military instruction in the Service, and left it at his\r\nconvenience, for our poor patch and tatter British Army to take in his\r\nplace another young student, who'll grow up to do similarly.  And\r\nDartrey, we assume, is off to stop that system.  You behold Sir Dartrey\r\ntwirling the weapon in preparatory fashion; because he is determined we\r\nshall have an army of trained officers instead of infant amateurs heading\r\nheroic louts.  Not a thought of Beer in Dartrey!--always unpatriotic, you\r\n'll say.  Plato entreats his absent mistress to fix eyes on a star: eyes\r\non Beer for the uniting of you English!  I tell you no poetic fiction.\r\nSeeing him on his way, thus terribly armed, and knowing his intent,\r\nVenus, to shield a former favourite servant of Mars, conjured the most\r\ndiverting of interventions, in the shape of a young woman in a poke-\r\nbonnet, and Skepsey, her squire, marching with a dozen or so, informing\r\nbedevilled mankind of the hideousness of our hymnification when it is not\r\nunder secluding sanction of the Edifice, and challengeing criticism; and\r\nthat was hard by, and real English, in the form of bludgeons, wielded by\r\na battalion of the national idol Bungay Beervat's boys; and they fell\r\nupon the hymners.  Here you fill in with pastoral similes.  They struck\r\nthe maid adored by Skepsey.  And that was the blow which slew them!\r\nOur little man drove into the press with a pair of fists able to do their\r\nwork.  A valiant skiff upon a sea of enemies, he was having it on the\r\nnob, and suddenly the Demerara lightened.  It flailed to thresh.  Enough.\r\nto say, brains would have come.  The Bungays made a show of fight.  No\r\nlack of blood in them, to stock a raw shilling's worth or gush before\r\nAchilles rageing.  You perceive the picture, you can almost sing the\r\nballad.  We want only a few names of the fallen.  It was the carving of a\r\nmaitre chef, according to Skepsey: right-left-and point, with supreme\r\nprecision: they fell, accurately sliced from the joint.  Having done with\r\nthem, Dartrey tossed the Demerara to Skepsey, and washed his hands of\r\nbattle; and he let his major go unscathed.  Phlebotomy sufficient for the\r\nday!'\r\n\r\nNesta's ears hummed with the name of Major Worrell.\r\n\r\n'Skepsey did come back to London with a rather damaged frontispiece,'\r\nVictor said.  'He can't have joined those people?'\r\n\r\n'They may suit one of your militant peacemakers,' interposed Fenellan.\r\n'The most placable creatures alive, and the surest for getting-up a\r\nshindy.'\r\n\r\n'Suit him!  They're the scandal of our streets.'  Victor was pricked with\r\na jealousy of them for beguiling him of his trusty servant.\r\n\r\n'Look at your country, see where it shows its vitality,' said Colney.\r\n'You don't see elsewhere any vein in movement-movement,' he harped on the\r\nword Victor constantly employed to express the thing he wanted to see.\r\n'Think of that, when the procession sets your teeth on edge.  They're\r\nhonest foes of vice, and they move:--in England!  Pulpit-preaching has no\r\neffect.  For gross maladies, gross remedies.  You may judge of what you\r\nare by the quality of the cure.  Puritanism, I won't attempt to paint--\r\nit would barely be decent; but compare it with the spectacle of English\r\nfrivolity, and you'll admit it to be the best show you make.  It may\r\nstill be the saving of you--on the level of the orderly ox: I 've not\r\nobserved that it aims at higher.  And talking of the pulpit, Barmby is\r\noff to the East, has accepted a Shoreditch curacy, Skepsey tells me.'\r\n\r\n'So there's the reason for our not seeing him!' Victor turned to Nesta.\r\n\r\n'Papa, you won't be angry with Skepsey if he has joined those people,'\r\nsaid Nesta.  'I'm sure he thinks of serving his country, Mr. Durance.'\r\n\r\nColney smiled on her.  'And you too?'\r\n\r\n'If women knew how!'\r\n\r\n'They're hitting on more ways at present than the men--in England.'\r\n\r\n'But, Mr. Durance, it speaks well for England when they're allowed the\r\nchance here.'\r\n\r\n'Good!' Fenellan exclaimed.  'And that upsets his placement of the modern\r\nnational genders: Germany masculine, France feminine, Old England what\r\nremains.'\r\n\r\nVictor ruffled and reddened on his shout of 'Neuter?'\r\n\r\nTheir circle widened.  Nesta knew she was on promotion, by her being led\r\nabout and introduced to ladies.  They were encouraging with her.  One of\r\nthem, a Mrs. Marina Floyer, had recently raised a standard of feminine\r\ninsurrection.  She said: 'I hear your praises from Mr. Durance.  He\r\nrarely praises.  You have shown capacity to meditate on the condition of\r\nwomen, he says.'\r\n\r\nNesta drew a shorter breath, with a hope at heart.  She speculated in the\r\ndark, as to whether her aim to serve and help was not so friendless.  And\r\ndid Mr. Durance approve?  But surely she stood in a glorious England if\r\nthere were men and women to welcome a girl to their councils.  Oh!  that\r\nis the broad free England where gentlemen and gentlewomen accept of the\r\nmeanest aid to cleanse the land of its iniquities, and do not suffer\r\nshame to smite a young face for touching upon horrors with a pure design.\r\n\r\nShe cried in her bosom: I feel!  She had no other expression for that\r\nwhich is as near as great natures may come to the conceiving of the\r\ncelestial spirit from an emissary angel; and she trembled, the fire ran\r\nthrough her.  It seemed to her, that she would be called to help or that\r\ncertainly they were nearing to an effacement of the woefullest of evils;\r\nand if not helping, it would still be a blessedness for her to kneel\r\nthanking heaven.\r\n\r\nSociety was being attacked and defended.  She could but studiously\r\nlisten.  Her father was listening.  The assailant was a lady; and she had\r\na hearing, although she treated Society as a discrowned monarch on trial\r\nfor an offence against a more precious: viz., the individual cramped by\r\nbrutish laws: the individual with the ideas of our time, righteously\r\nclaiming expansion out of the clutches of a narrow old-world\r\ndisciplinarian-that giant hypocrite!  She flung the gauntlet at\r\nexternally venerable Institutions; and she had a hearing, where\r\nhorrification, execration, the foul Furies of Conservatism would in a\r\nshortly antecedent day have been hissing and snakily lashing, hounding\r\nher to expulsion.  Mrs. Marina Floyer gravely seconded her.  Colney did\r\nthe same.  Victor turned sharp on him.  'Yes,' Colney said; 'we unfold\r\nthe standard of extremes in this country, to get a single step taken:\r\nthat's how we move: we threaten death to get footway.  Now, mark:\r\nSociety's errors will be admitted.'\r\n\r\nA gentleman spoke.  He began by admitting Society's errors.\r\nNevertheless, it so distinctly exists for the common good, that we may\r\nsay of Society in relation to the individual, it is the body to the soul.\r\nWe may wash, trim, purify, but we must not maim it.  The assertion of our\r\nindividuality in opposition to the Government of Society--this existing\r\nSociety--is a toss of the cap for the erasure of our civilization, et\r\ncaetera.\r\n\r\nPlatitudes can be of intense interest if they approach our case.--But, if\r\nyou please, we ask permission to wash, trim, purify, and we do not get\r\nit.--But you have it!  Because we take it at our peril; and you, who are\r\ntoo cowardly to grant or withhold, call-up the revolutionary from the\r\npits by your slackness:--etc.  There was a pretty hot debate.  Both\r\nassailant and defendant, to Victor's thinking, spoke well, and each the\r\nright thing and he could have made use of both, but he could answer\r\nneither.  He beat about for the cause of this deficiency, and discovered\r\nit in his position.  Mentally, he was on the side of Society.  Yet he was\r\nannoyed to find the attack was so easily answerable when the defence\r\nunfolded.  But it was absurd to expect it would not be.  And in fact, a\r\nposition secretly rebellious is equal to water on the brain for\r\nstultifying us.\r\n\r\nBefore the controversy was over, a note in Nataly's handwriting called\r\nhim home.  She wrote: 'Make my excuses.  C. D.  will give Nesta and some\r\nlady dinner.  A visitor here.  Come alone, and without delay.  Quite\r\nwell, robust.  Impatient to consult with you, nothing else.'\r\n\r\nNesta was happy to stay; and Victor set forth.\r\n\r\nThe visitor?  plainly Dudley.  Nataly's trusting the girl to the chance\r\nof some lady being present, was unlike her.  Dudley might be tugging at\r\nthe cord; and the recent conversation upon Society, rendered one of its\r\ngilt pillars particularly estimable.--A person in the debate had declared\r\nthis modern protest on behalf of individualism to represent Society's\r\nCriminal Trial.  And it is likely to be a long one.  And good for the\r\nworld, that we see such a Trial!--Well said or not, undoubtedly Society\r\nis an old criminal: not much more advanced than the state of spiritual\r\nworship where bloody sacrifice was offered to a hungry Lord.  But it has\r\na case for pleading.  We may liken it, as we have it now, to the bumping\r\nlumberer's raft; suitable along torrent waters until we come to smoother.\r\nAre we not on waters of a certain smoothness at the reflecting level?--\r\nenough to justify demands for a vessel of finer design.  If Society is to\r\nsubsist, it must have the human with the logical argument against the cry\r\nof the free-flags, instead of presenting a block's obtuseness.  That, you\r\nneed not hesitate to believe, will be rolled downward and disintegrated,\r\nsooner than later.  A Society based on the logical concrete of humane\r\nconsiderateness:--a Society prohibiting to Mrs. Burman her wielding of a\r\nlife-long rod .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nThe personal element again to confuse inquiry!--And Skepsey and Barmby\r\nboth of them bent on doing work without inquiry of any sort!  They were\r\nenviable: they were good fellows.  Victor clung to the theme because it\r\nhinted of next door to his lost Idea.  He rubbed the back of his head,\r\nfancying a throb there.  Are civilized creatures incapable of abstract\r\nthought when their social position is dubious?  For if so, we never can\r\nbe quit of those we forsake.--Apparently Mrs. Burman's unfathomed power\r\nlay in her compelling him to summon the devilish in himself and play upon\r\nthe impish in Society, that he might overcome her.\r\n\r\nVictor's house-door stopped this current.\r\n\r\nNataly took his embrace.\r\n\r\n'Nothing wrong?' he said, and saw the something.  It was a favourable\r\nmoment to tell her what she might not at another time regard as a small\r\naffair.  'News in the City to-day of that South London borough being\r\nvacated.  Quatley urges me.  A death again!  I saw Pempton, too.  Will\r\nyou credit me when I tell you he carries his infatuation so far, that he\r\nhas been investing in Japanese and Chinese Loans, because they are less\r\nmeat-eaters than others, and vegetarians are more stable, and outlast us\r\nall!--Dudley the visitor?'  'Mr. Sowerby has been here,' she said, in a\r\nshaking low voice.\r\n\r\nVictor held her hand and felt a squeeze more nervous than affectionate.\r\n\r\n'To consult with me,' she added.  'My maid will go at ten to bring Nesta;\r\nMr. Durance I can count on, to see her safe home.  Ah!' she wailed.\r\n\r\nVictor nodded, saying: 'I guess.  And, my love, you will receive Mrs.\r\nJohn Cormyn to-morrow morning.  I can't endure gaps.  Gaps in our circle\r\nmust never be.  Do I guess?--I spoke to Colney about bringing her home.'\r\n\r\nNataly sighed: 'Ah!  make what provision we will!  Evil--Mr. Sowerby has\r\nhad a great deal to bear.'\r\n\r\n'A worldling may think so.'\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved, and the wave burst: but her restraining of tears froze\r\nher speech.\r\n\r\n'Victor!  Our Nesta!  Mr. Sowerby is unable to explain.  And how the Miss\r\nDuvidneys!  .  .  .  At that Brighton!'--The voice he heard was not his\r\ndarling's deep rich note, it had dropped to toneless hoarseness: 'She has\r\nbeen permitted to make acquaintance--she has been seen riding with--she\r\nhas called upon--Oh! it is one of those abandoned women.  In her house!\r\nOur girl!  Our Nesta!  She was insulted by a man in the woman's house.\r\nShe is talked of over Brighton.  The mother!--the daughter!  And grant me\r\nthis--that never was girl more carefully .  .  .  never till she was\r\ntaken from me.  Oh!  do not forget.  You will defend me?  You will say,\r\nthat her mother did with all her soul strive .  .  .  It is not a rumour.\r\nMr. Sowerby has had it confirmed.'  A sob caught her voice.\r\n\r\nVictor's hands caressed to console: 'Dudley does not propose to .  .  ?'\r\n\r\n'Nesta must promise .  .  .  But how it happened?  How!  An acquaintance\r\nwith--contact with!--Oh!  cruel!'  Each time she ceased speaking, the\r\nwrinkles of a shiver went over her, and the tone was of tears coming, but\r\nshe locked them in.\r\n\r\n'An accident!' said Victor; 'some misunderstanding--there can't be harm.\r\nOf course, she promises--hasn't to promise.  How could a girl\r\ndistinguish!  He does not cast blame on her?'\r\n\r\n'Dear, if you would go down to Dartrey to-morrow.  He knows:--it is over\r\nthe Clubs there; he will tell you, before a word to Nesta.  Innocent,\r\nyes!  Mr. Sowerby has not to be assured of that.  Ignorant of the\r\ncharacter of the dreadful woman?  Ah, if I could ever in anything think\r\nher ignorant!  She frightens me.  Mr. Sowerby is indulgent.  He does me\r\njustice.  My duty to her--I must defend myself--has been my first\r\nthought.  I said in my prayers--she at least!  .  .  .  We have to see\r\nthe more than common reasons why she, of all girls, should--he did not\r\nhint it, he was delicate: her name must not be public.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, Dudley is without parallel as a gentleman,' said Victor.  'It\r\ndoes not suit me to hear the word \"indulgent.\"  My dear, if you were down\r\nthere, you would discover that the talk was the talk of two or three men\r\nseeing our girl ride by--and she did ride with a troop: why, we've\r\nwatched them along the parade, often.  Clear as day how it happened!\r\nI'll go down early to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nHe fancied Nataly was appeased.  And even out of this annoyance, there\r\nwas the gain of her being won to favour Dudley's hitherto but tolerated\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\nNataly also had the fancy, that the calm following on her anguish, was a\r\nmoderation of it.  She was kept strung to confide in her girl by the\r\nrecent indebtedness to her for words heavenly in the strengthening\r\ncomfort they gave.  But no sooner was she alone than her torturing\r\nperplexities and her abasement of the hours previous to Victor's\r\ncoming returned.\r\n\r\nFor a girl of Nesta's head could not be deceived; she had come home with\r\na woman's intelligence of the world, hard knowledge of it--a knowledge\r\ndrawn from foul wells, the unhappy mother imagined: she dreaded to probe\r\nto the depth of it.  She had in her wounded breast the world's idea, that\r\ncorruption must come of the contact with impurity.\r\n\r\nNataly renewed her cry of despair: 'The mother!--the daughter!'--her sole\r\nrevelation of the heart's hollows in her stammered speaking to Victor.\r\n\r\nShe thanked heaven for the loneliness of her bed, where she could repeat:\r\n'The mother!--the daughter!' hearing the world's words:--the daughter\r\nexcused, by reason of her having such a mother; the mother unpitied for\r\nthe bruiting of her brazen daughter's name: but both alike consigned to\r\nthe corners of the world's dust-heaps.  She cried out, that her pride was\r\nbroken.  Her pride, her last support of life, had gone to pieces.  The\r\ntears she restrained in Victor's presence, were called on to come now,\r\nand she had none.  It might be, that she had not strength for weeping.\r\nShe was very weak.  Rising from bed to lock her door against Nesta's\r\nentry to the room on her return at night, she could hardly stand: a chill\r\nand a clouding overcame her.  The quitted bed seemed the haven of a\r\ndrifted wreck to reach.\r\n\r\nVictor tried the handle of a locked door in the dark of the early winter\r\nmorning.  'The mother!--the daughter!' had swung a pendulum for some time\r\nduring the night in him, too.  He would rather have been subjected to the\r\nspectacle of tears than have heard that toneless voice, as it were the\r\ndry torrent-bed rolling blocks instead of melodious, if afflicting,\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nHe told Nesta not to disturb her mother, and murmured of a headache:\r\n'Though, upon my word, the best cure for mama would be a look into\r\nFredi's eyes!' he said, embracing his girl, quite believing in her, just\r\na little afraid of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nNATALY, NESTA, AND DARTREY FENELLAN\r\n\r\nPleasant things, that come to us too late for our savour of the sweetness\r\nin them, toll ominously of life on the last walk to its end.  Yesterday,\r\nbefore Dudley Sowerby's visit, Nataly would have been stirred where the\r\ntears we shed for happiness or repress at a flattery dwell when seeing\r\nher friend Mrs. John Cormyn enter her boudoir and hearing her speak\r\nrepentantly, most tenderly.  Mrs. John said: 'You will believe I have\r\nsuffered, dear; I am half my weight, I do think': and she did not set the\r\nsmile of responsive humour moving; although these two ladies had a key of\r\nlaughter between them.  Nataly took her kiss; held her hand, and at the\r\nparting kissed her.  She would rather have seen her friend than not: so\r\nfar she differed from a corpse; but she was near the likeness to the dead\r\nin the insensibility to any change of light shining on one who best loved\r\ndarkness and silence.  She cried to herself wilfully, that her pride was\r\nbroken: as women do when they spurn at the wounding of a dignity they\r\ncannot protect and die to see bleeding; for in it they live.\r\n\r\nThe cry came of her pride unbroken, sore bruised, and after a certain\r\nspace for recovery combative.  She said:\r\n\r\nAny expiation I could offer where I did injury, I would not refuse; I\r\nwould humble myself and bless heaven for being able to pay my debt--what\r\nI can of it.  All I contend against is, injustice.  And she sank into\r\nsensational protests of her anxious care of her daughter, too proud to\r\nphrase them.\r\n\r\nHer one great affliction, the scourging affliction of her utter\r\nloneliness;--an outcast from her family; daily, and she knew not how,\r\nmore shut away from the man she loved; now shut away from her girl;--\r\nseemed under the hand of the angel of God.  The abandonment of her by\r\nfriends, was merely the light to show it.\r\n\r\nMidday's post brought her a letter from Priscilla Graves, entreating to\r\nbe allowed to call on her next day.--We are not so easily cast off!\r\nNataly said, bitterly, in relation to the lady whose offending had not\r\nbeen so great.  She wrote: 'Come, if sure that you sincerely wish to.'\r\n\r\nHaving fasted, she ate at lunch in her dressing-room, with some taste of\r\nthe food, haunted by an accusation of gluttony because of her eating at\r\nall, and a vile confession, that she was enabled to eat, owing to the\r\nreceipt of Priscilla's empty letter: for her soul's desire was to be\r\ndoing a deed of expiation, and the macerated flesh seemed her assurance\r\nto herself of the courage to make amends.--I must have some strength, she\r\nsaid wearifully, in apology for the morsel consumed.\r\n\r\nNesta's being in the house with her, became an excessive irritation.\r\nDoubts of the girl's possible honesty to speak a reptile truth under\r\nquestion; amazement at her boldness to speak it; hatred of, the mouth\r\nthat could: and loathing of the words, the theme; and abomination of\r\nherself for conjuring fictitious images to rouse real emotions; all ran\r\ncounterthreads, that produced a mad pattern in the mind, affrighting to\r\nreason: and then, for its preservation, reason took a superrational leap,\r\nand ascribed the terrible injustice of this last cruel stroke to the\r\ndivine scourge, recognized divine by the selection of the mortal spot for\r\nchastisement.  She clasped her breast, and said: It is mortal.  And that\r\ncalmed her.\r\n\r\nShe said, smiling: I never felt my sin until this blow came!  Therefore\r\nthe blow was proved divine.  Ought it not to be welcomed?--and she\r\nappearing no better than one of those, the leprous of the sex!  And\r\nbrought to acknowledgement of the likeness by her daughter!\r\n\r\nNataly drank the poison distilled from her exclamations and was ice.  She\r\nhad denied herself to Nesta's redoubled petition.  Nesta knocking at the\r\ndoor a third time and calling, tore the mother two ways: to have her girl\r\non her breast or snap their union in a word with an edge.  She heard the\r\nvoice of Dartrey Fenellan.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted.  'No, dear,' she said to Nesta; and Nesta's, 'My own\r\nmother,' consentingly said, in tender resignation, as she retired, sprang\r\na stinging tear to the mother's eyelids.\r\n\r\nDartrey looked at the door closing on the girl.\r\n\r\n'Is it a very low woman?' Nataly asked him in a Church whisper, with a\r\nface abashed.\r\n\r\n'It is not,' said he, quick to meet any abruptness.\r\n\r\n'She must be cunning.'\r\n\r\n'In the ordinary way.  We say it of Puss before the hounds.'\r\n\r\n'To deceive a girl like Nesta!'\r\n\r\n'She has done no harm.'\r\n\r\n'Dartrey, you speak to a mother.  You have seen the woman?  She is?\r\n--ah!'\r\n\r\n'She is womanly, womanly.'\r\n\r\n'Quite one of those .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\n'My dear soul!  You can't shake them off in that way.  She is one of us.\r\nIf we have the class, we can't escape from it.  They are not to bear all\r\nthe burden because they exist.  We are the bigger debtors.  I tell you\r\nshe is womanly.'\r\n\r\n'It sounds like horrid cynicism.'\r\n\r\n'Friends of mine would abuse it for the reverse.'\r\n\r\n'Do not make me hate your chivalry.  This woman is a rod on my back.\r\nProvided only she has not dropped venom into Nesta's mind!'\r\n\r\n'Don't fear!'\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me you think she has done no harm to my girl?'\r\n\r\n'To Nesta herself?--not any: not to a girl like your girl.'\r\n\r\n'To my girl's name?  Speak at once.  But I know she has.  She induced\r\nNesta to go to her house.  My girl was insulted in this woman's house.'\r\n\r\nDartrey's forehead ridged with his old fury and a gust of present\r\ncontempt.  'I can tell you this, that the fellow who would think harm of\r\nit, knowing the facts 's not worthy of touching the tips of the fingers\r\nof your girl.'\r\n\r\n'She is talked of!'\r\n\r\n'A good-looking girl out riding with a handsome woman on a parade of\r\nidlers!'\r\n\r\n'The woman is notorious.'  Nataly said it shivering.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.  'Not true.'\r\n\r\n'She has an air of a lady?'\r\n\r\n'She sits a horse well.'\r\n\r\n'Would she to any extent deceive me--impose on me here?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' Nataly moaned. . . .\r\n\r\n'But what?' said Dartrey.  'There was no pretence.  Her style is not\r\nworse than that of some we have seen.  There was no effort to deceive.\r\nThe woman's plain for you and me to read, she has few of the arts; one or\r\ntwo tricks, if you like: and these were not needed for use.  There are\r\nwomen who have them, and have not been driven or let slip into the\r\nwilderness.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I know!--those ideas of yours!' Nataly had once admired him for his\r\nknightliness toward the weakest women and the women underfoot.  'You have\r\nspoken to this woman?  She boasted of acquaintance with Nesta?'\r\n\r\n'She thanked God for having met her.'\r\n\r\n'Is it one of the hysterical creatures?'\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett appeared fronting Dartrey.\r\n\r\nHe laughed to himself.  'A clever question.  There is a leaning to\r\nexcitement of manner at times.  It 's not hysteria.  Allow for her\r\nposition.'\r\n\r\nNataly took the unintended blow, and bowed to it; and still more harshly\r\nsaid: 'What rank of life does the woman come from?'\r\n\r\n'The class educated for a skittish career by your popular Stage and your\r\nBook-stalls.  I am not precise?'\r\n\r\n'Leave Mr. Durance.  Is she in any degree commonly well bred?  .  .  .\r\nbehaviour, talk-her English.'\r\n\r\n'I trench on Mr. Durance in replying.  Her English is passable.  You may\r\nhear .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Everywhere, of course!  And this woman of slipshod English and excited\r\nmanners imposed upon Nesta!'\r\n\r\n'It would not be my opinion.'\r\n\r\n'Did not impose on her!'\r\n\r\n'Not many would impose on Nesta Radnor for long.'\r\n\r\n'Think what that says, Dartrey!'\r\n\r\n'You have had a detestable version of the story.'\r\n\r\n'Because an excited creature thanks God to you for having met her!'\r\n\r\n'She may.  She's a better woman for having met her.  Don't suppose we're\r\nfor supernatural conversions.  The woman makes no show of that.  But she\r\nhas found a good soul among her sex--her better self in youth, as one\r\nguesses; and she is grateful--feels farther from exile in consequence.\r\nShe has found a lady to take her by the hand!--not a common case.  She\r\ncan never go to the utterly bad after knowing Nesta.  I forget if she\r\nsays it; I say it.  You have heard the story from one of your\r\nconventional gentlemen.'\r\n\r\n'A true gentleman.  I have reason to thank him.  He has not your ideas on\r\nthese matters, Dartrey.  He is very sensitive .  .  .  on Nesta's\r\nbehalf.'\r\n\r\n'With reference to marriage.  I'll own I prefer another kind of\r\ngentleman.  I 've had my experience of that kind of gentleman.  Many\r\nof the kind have added their spot to the outcasts abominated for\r\nuncleanness--in holy unction.  Many?--I won't say all; but men who\r\nconsent to hear black words pitched at them, and help to set good women\r\nfacing away from them, are pious dolts or rascal dogs of hypocrites.\r\nThey, if you'll let me quote Colney Durance to you to-day--and how is it\r\nhe is not in favour?--they are tempting the Lord to turn the pillars of\r\nSociety into pillars of salt.  Down comes the house.  And priests can\r\nrest in sight of it!--They ought to be dead against the sanctimony that\r\nbelieves it excommunicates when it curses.  The relationship is not\r\ndissolved so cheaply, though our Society affects to think it is.\r\nBarmby's off to the East End of this London, Victor informs me:--good\r\nfellow!  And there he'll be groaning over our vicious nature.  Nature is\r\nnot more responsible for vice than she is for inhumanity.  Both bad, but\r\nthe latter's the worse of the two.'\r\n\r\nNataly interposed: 'I see the contrast, and see whom it's to strike.'\r\n\r\nDartrey sent a thought after his meaning.  'Hardly that.  Let it stand.\r\nHe 's only one with the world: but he shares the criminal infamy for\r\ncrushing hope out of its frailest victims.  They're that--no sentiment.\r\nWhat a world, too, look behind it!--brutal because brutish.  The world\r\nmay go hang: we expect more of your gentleman.  To hear of Nesta down\r\nthere, and doubt that she was about good work; and come complaining!  He\r\nhad the privilege of speaking to her, remonstrating, if he wished.  There\r\nare men who think--men!--the plucking of sinners out of the mire a dirty\r\nbusiness.  They depute it to certain officials.  And your women--it's the\r\ntaste of the world to have them educated so, that they can as little take\r\nthe humane as the enlightened view.  Except, by the way, sometimes, in\r\nsecret;--they have a sisterly breast.  In secret, they do occasionally\r\nthink as they feel.  In public, the brass mask of the Idol they call\r\nPropriety commands or supplies their feelings and thoughts.  I won't\r\nrepeat my reasons for educating them differently.  At present we have but\r\nhalf the woman to go through life with--and thank you.'\r\n\r\nDartrey stopped.  'Don't be disturbed,' he added.  'There's no ground for\r\nalarm.  Not of any sort.'\r\n\r\nNataly said: 'What name?'\r\n\r\n'Her name is Mrs. Marsett.'\r\n\r\n'The name is .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\n'Captain Marsett: will be Sir Edward.  He came back from the Continent\r\nyesterday.'\r\n\r\nA fit of shuddering seized Nataly.  It grew in violence, and speaking out\r\nof it, with a pause of sickly empty chatter of the jaws, she said:\r\n'Always that name?'\r\n\r\n'Before the maiden name?  May have been or not.'\r\n\r\n'Not, you say?'\r\n\r\n'I don't accurately know.'\r\n\r\nDartrey sprang to his legs.  'My dear soul!  dear friend--one of the\r\nbest! if we go on fencing in the dark, there'll be wounds.  Your way of\r\ntaking this affair disappointed me.  Now I understand.  It's the disease\r\nof a trouble, to fly at comparisons.  No real one exists.  I wished to\r\nprotect the woman from a happier sister's judgement, to save you from\r\nalarm concerning Nesta:--quite groundless, if you'll believe me.  Come,\r\nthere's plenty of benevolent writing abroad on these topics now: facts\r\nare more looked at, and a good woman may join us in taking them without\r\nthe horrors and loathings of angels rather too much given to claim\r\ndistinction from the luckless.  A girl who's unprotected may go through\r\nadventures before she fixes, and be a creature of honest intentions.\r\nBetter if protected, we all agree.  Better also if the world did not\r\nfavour the girl's multitude of enemies.  Your system of not dealing with\r\nfacts openly is everyway favourable to them.  I am glad to say, Victor\r\nrecognizes what corruption that spread of wealth is accountable for.\r\nAnd now I must go and have a talk with the--what a change from the blue\r\nbutterfly!  Eaglet, I ought to have said.  I dine with you, for Victor\r\nmay bring news.'\r\n\r\n'Would anything down there be news to you, Dartrey?'\r\n\r\n'He makes it wherever he steps.'\r\n\r\n'He would reproach me for not detaining you.  Tell Nesta I have to lie\r\ndown after talking.  She has a child's confidence in you.'\r\n\r\nA man of middle age!  he said to himself.  It is the particular\r\nejaculation which tames the senior whose heart is for a dash of holiday.\r\nHe resolved, that the mother might trust to the discretion of a man of\r\nhis age; and he went down to Nesta, grave with the weight his count of\r\nyears should give him.  Seeing her, the light of what he now knew of her\r\nwas an ennobling equal to celestial.  For this fair girl was one of the\r\nactive souls of the world--his dream to discover in woman's form.  She,\r\nthe little Nesta, the tall pure-eyed girl before him, was, young though\r\nshe was, already in the fight with evil: a volunteer of the army of the\r\nsimply Christian.  The worse for it?  Sowerby would think so.  She was\r\nnot of the order of young women who, in sheer ignorance or in voluntary,\r\nconsent to the peace with evil, and are kept externally safe from the\r\nsmirch of evil, and are the ornaments of their country, glory of a\r\ncountry prizing ornaments higher than qualities.\r\n\r\nDartrey could have been momentarily incredulous of things revealed by\r\nMrs. Marsett--not incredulous of the girl's heroism: that capacity he\r\ncaught and gauged in her shape of head, cut of mouth, and the\r\nmeasurements he was accustomed to make at a glance:--but her beauty, or\r\nthe form of beauty which was hers, argued against her having set foot of\r\nthought in our fens.  Here and far there we meet a young saint vowed to\r\nservice along by those dismal swamps: and saintly she looks; not of this\r\nearth.  Nesta was of the blooming earth.  Where do we meet girl or woman\r\ncomparable to garden-flowers, who can dare to touch to lift the spotted\r\nof her sex?  He was puzzled by Nesta's unlikeness in deeds and in aspect.\r\nHe remembered her eyes, on the day when he and Colonel Sudley beheld her;\r\npresently he was at quiet grapple with her mind.  His doubts cleared off.\r\nThen the question came, How could a girl of heroical character be\r\nattached to the man Sowerby?  That entirely passed belief.\r\n\r\nAnd was it possible his wishes beguiled his hearing?  Her tones were\r\nsingularly vibrating.\r\n\r\nThey talked for a while before, drawing a deep breath, she said: 'I fancy\r\nI am in disgrace with my mother.'\r\n\r\n'You have a suspicion why?' said he.\r\n\r\n'I have.'\r\n\r\nShe would have told him why: the words were at her lips.  Previous to her\r\nemotion on the journey home, the words would have come out.  They were\r\narrested by the thunder of the knowledge, that the nobleness in him\r\ndrawing her to be able to speak of scarlet matter, was personally\r\nworshipped.\r\n\r\nHe attributed the full rose upon her cheeks to the forbidding subject.\r\n\r\nTo spare pain, he said: 'No misunderstanding with the dear mother will\r\nlast the day through.  Can I help?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Captain Dartrey!'\r\n\r\n'Drop the captain.  Dartrey will do.'\r\n\r\n'How could I!'\r\n\r\n'You're not wanting in courage, Nesta.'\r\n\r\n'Hardly for that!'\r\n\r\n'By-and-by, then.'\r\n\r\n'Though I could not say Mr. Fenellan.'\r\n\r\n'You see; Dartrey, it must be.'\r\n\r\n'If I could!'\r\n\r\n'But the fellow is not a captain: and he is a friend, an old friend, very\r\nold friend: he'll be tipped with grey in a year or two.'\r\n\r\n'I might be bolder then.'\r\n\r\n'Imagine it now.  There is no disloyalty in your calling your friends by\r\ntheir names.'\r\n\r\nHer nature rang to the implication.  'I am not bound.'  Dartrey hung\r\nfast, speculating on her visibly: 'I heard you were?'\r\n\r\n'No.  I must be free.'\r\n\r\n'It is not an engagement?'\r\n\r\n'Will you laugh?--I have never quite known.  My father desired it:\r\nand my desire is to please him.  I think I am vain enough to think I read\r\nthrough blinds and shutters.  The engagement--what there was--has been,\r\nto my reading, broken more than once.  I have not considered it, to\r\nsettle my thoughts on it, until lately: and now I may suspect it to be\r\nbroken.  I have given cause--if it is known.  There is no blame\r\nelsewhere.  I am not unhappy, Captain Dartrey.'\r\n\r\n'Captain by courtesy.  Very well.  Tell me how Nesta judges the\r\nengagement to be broken?'\r\n\r\nShe was mentally phrasing before she said: 'Absence.'\r\n\r\n'He was here yesterday.'\r\n\r\nAll that the visit embraced was in her expressive look, as of sight\r\ndrawing inward, like our breath in a spell of wonderment.  'Then I\r\nunderstand; it enlightens me.\r\n\r\nMy own mother!--my poor mother!  he should have come to me.  I was the\r\nguilty person, not she; and she is the sufferer.  That, if in life were\r\ndirect retribution! but the very meaning of having a heart, is to suffer\r\nthrough others or for them.'\r\n\r\n'You have soon seen that, dear girl,' said Dartrey.\r\n\r\n'So, my own mother, and loving me as she does, blames me!' Nesta sighed;\r\nshe took a sharp breath.  'You? do you blame me too?'\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand, enamoured of her instantaneous divination and\r\nheavenly candour.\r\n\r\nBut he was admonished, that to speak high approval would not be\r\nhonourable advantage taken of the rival condemning; and he said: 'Blame?\r\nSome think it is not always the right thing to do the right thing.  I've\r\nmade mistakes, with no bad design.  A good mother's view is not often\r\nwrong.'\r\n\r\n'You pressed my hand,' she murmured.\r\n\r\nThat certainly had said more.\r\n\r\n'Glad to again,' he responded.  It was uttered airily and was meant to be\r\nas lightly done.\r\n\r\nNesta did not draw back her hand.  'I feel strong when you press it.'\r\nHer voice wavered, and as when we hear a flask sing thin at the filling,\r\nceased upon evidence of a heart surcharged.  How was he to relax the\r\npressure!--he had to give her the strength she craved: and he vowed it\r\nshould be but for half a minute, half a minute longer.\r\n\r\nHer tears fell; she eyed him steadily; she had the look of sunlight in\r\nshower.\r\n\r\n'Oldish men are the best friends for you, I suppose,' he said; and her\r\ngaze turned elusive phrases to vapour.\r\n\r\nHe was compelled to see the fiery core of the raincloud lighting it for a\r\nrevealment, that allowed as little as it retained of a shadow of\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nThe sight was keener than touch and the run of blood with blood to\r\nquicken slumbering seeds of passion.\r\n\r\nBut here is the place of broken ground and tangle, which calls to\r\nhonourable men, not bent on sport, to be wary to guard the gunlock.  He\r\nstopped the word at his mouth.  It was not in him to stop or moderate the\r\nforce of his eyes.  She met them with the slender unbendingness that was\r\nher own; a feminine of inspirited manhood.  There was no soft expression,\r\nonly the direct shot of light, on both sides; conveying as much as is\r\nborne from sun to earth, from earth to sun.  And when such an exchange\r\nhas come between the two, they are past plighting, they are the wedded\r\none.\r\n\r\nNesta felt it, without asking whether she was loved.  She was his.  She\r\nhad not a thought of the word of love or the being beloved.  Showers of\r\npainful blissfulness went through her, as the tremours of a shocked\r\nframe, while she sat quietly, showing scarce a sign; and after he had let\r\nher hand go, she had the pressure on it.  The quivering intense of the\r\nmoment of his eyes and grasp was lord of her, lord of the day and of all\r\ndays coming.  That is how Love slays Death.  Never did girl so give her\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nShe would have been the last to yield it unreservedly to a man untrusted\r\nfor the character she worshipped.  But she could have given it to\r\nDartrey, despite his love of another, because it was her soul, without\r\nany of the cravings, except to bestow.\r\n\r\nHe perceived, that he had been carried on for the number of steps which\r\nare countless miles and do not permit the retreat across the desert\r\nbehind; and he was in some amazement at himself, remindful of the\r\ndifferent nature of our restraining power when we have a couple playing\r\non it.  Yet here was this girl, who called him up to the heights of young\r\nlife again: and a brave girl; and she bled for the weak, had no shrinking\r\nfrom the women underfoot: for the reason, that she was a girl sovereignly\r\npure, angelically tender.  Was there a point of honour to hold him back?\r\n\r\nNataly entered the room.  She kissed Nesta, and sat silent.\r\n\r\n'Mother, will you speak of me to him, if I go out?' Nesta said.\r\n\r\n'We have spoken,' her mother replied, vexed by the unmaidenly allusion to\r\nthat theme.\r\n\r\nShe would have asked, How did you guess I knew of it?--but that the, Why\r\nshould I speak of you to him? struck the louder note in her bosom: and\r\nthen, What is there that this girl cannot guess!--filled the mother's\r\nheart with apprehensive dread: and an inward cry, What things will she\r\nnot set going, to have them discussed.  And the appalling theme, sitting\r\noffensive though draped in their midst, was taken for a proof of the\r\ngirl's unblushingness.  After standing as one woman against the world so\r\nlong, Nataly was relieved to be on the side of a world now convictedly\r\nunjust to her in the confounding of her with the shameless.  Her mind had\r\ntaken the brand of that thought:--And Nesta had brought her to it:--\r\nAnd Dudley Sowerby, a generous representative of the world, had kindly,\r\nhaving the deputed power to do so, sustained her, only partially blaming\r\nNesta, not casting them off; as the world, with which Nataly felt, under\r\na sense of the protection calling up all her gratitude to young Dudley,\r\nwould have approved his doing.\r\n\r\nShe was passing through a fit of the cowardice peculiar to the tediously\r\nstrained, who are being more than commonly tried--persecuted, as they say\r\nwhen they are not supplicating their tyrannical Authority for aid.  The\r\nworld will continue to be indifferent to their view of it and behaviour\r\ntoward it until it ceases to encourage the growth of hypocrites.\r\n\r\nThese are moments when the faces we are observing drop their charm,\r\nshowing us our perversion internal, if we could but reflect, to see it.\r\nVery many thousand times above Dudley Sowerby, Nataly ranked Dartrey\r\nFenellan; and still she looked at him, where he sat beside Nesta,\r\nungenially, critical of the very features, jealously in the interests of\r\nDudley; and recollecting, too, that she had once prayed for one exactly\r\nresembling Dartrey Fenellan to be her Nesta's husband.  But, as she would\r\nhave said, that was before the indiscretion of her girl had shown her to\r\nrequire for her husband a man whose character and station guaranteed\r\nprotection instead of inciting to rebellion.  And Dartrey, the loved and\r\nprized, was often in the rebel ranks; he was dissatisfied with matters as\r\nthey are; was restless for action, angry with a country denying it to\r\nhim; he made enemies, he would surely bring down inquiries about Nesta's\r\nhead, and cause the forgotten or quiescent to be stirred; he would\r\nscarcely be the needed hand for such a quiver of the lightnings as Nesta\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nDartrey read Nataly's brows.  This unwonted uncomeliness of hers was an\r\nindication to one or other of our dusky pits, not a revealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER IN THE SHADOW OF MRS. MARSETT\r\n\r\nHe read her more closely when Arlington brought in the brown paper\r\nenvelope of the wires--to which the mate of Victor ought to have become\r\naccustomed.  She took it; her eyelids closed, and her features were\r\ndriven to whiteness.  'Only these telegrams,' she said, in apology.\r\n\r\n'Lakelands on fire?' Dartrey murmured to Nesta; and she answered: 'I\r\nshould not be sorry.'\r\n\r\nNataly coldly asked her why she would not be sorry.\r\n\r\nDartrey interposed: 'I'm sure she thinks Lakelands worries her mother.'\r\n\r\n'That ranks low among the worries,' Nataly sighed, opening the envelope.\r\n\r\nNesta touched her arm: 'Mother! even before Captain Dartrey, if you will\r\nlet me!'--she turned to him: 'before .  .  .'  at the end of her breath\r\nshe said: 'Dartrey Fenellan.  You shall see my whole heart, mother.'\r\n\r\nHer mother looked from her at him.\r\n\r\n'Victor returns by the last train.   He telegraphs, that he dines with--'\r\nShe handed the paper to Dartrey.\r\n\r\n'Marsett,' he read aloud; and she flushed; she was angry with him for not\r\nknowing, that the name was a term of opprobrium flung at her.\r\n\r\n'It's to tell you he has done what he thought good,' said Dartrey.\r\n'In other words, as I interpret, he has completed his daughter's work.\r\nSo we won't talk about it till he comes.  You have no company this\r\nevening?'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  there is a pause to-night!  It's nearly as unceasing as your\r\nbrother Simeon's old French lady in the ronde with her young bridegroom,\r\ntill they danced her to pieces.  I do get now and then an hour's repose,'\r\nNataly added, with a vision springing up of the person to whom the story\r\nhad applied.\r\n\r\n'My dear, you are a good girl to call me Dartrey,' the owner of the name\r\nsaid to Nesta.\r\n\r\nNataly saw them both alert, in the terrible manner peculiar to both, for\r\nthe directest of the bare statements.  She could have protested, that her\r\nlove of truth was on an equality with theirs; and certainly, that her\r\nregard for decency was livelier.  Pass the deficiency in a man.  But a\r\ngirl who could speak, by allusion, of Mrs. Marsett--of the existence of a\r\nMrs. Marsett--in the presence of a man: and he excusing, encouraging: and\r\nthis girl her own girl;--it seemed to her, that the world reeled; she\r\ncould hardly acknowledge the girl; save under the penitential admission\r\nof her sin's having found her out.\r\n\r\nShe sent Nesta to her room when they went upstairs to dress, unable to\r\nendure her presence after seeing her show a placid satisfaction at\r\nDartrey's nod to the request for him to sleep in the house that night.\r\nIt was not at all a gleam of pleasure, hardly an expression; it was a\r\nmanner of saying, One drop more in my cup of good fortune! an absurd and\r\nan offensive exhibition of silly optimism of the young, blind that they\r\nare!\r\n\r\nFor were it known, and surely the happening of it would be known,\r\nthat Dudley Sowerby had shaken off the Nesta of no name, who was the\r\nabominable Mrs. Marsett's friend, a whirlwind with a trumpet would sweep\r\nthem into the wilderness on a blast frightfuller than any ever heard.\r\n\r\nNataly had a fit of weeping for want of the girl's embrace, against whom\r\nher door was jealously locked.  She hoped those two would talk much,\r\nmadly if they liked, during dinner, that she might not be sensible,\r\nthrough any short silence, of the ardour animating them: especially\r\nglowing in Nesta, ready behind her quiet mask to come brazenly forth.\r\nBut both of them were mercilessly ardent; and a sickness of the fear,\r\nthat they might fall on her to capture her and hurry her along with them\r\nperforce of the allayed, once fatal, inflammable element in herself,\r\nshook the warmth from her limbs: causing her to say to herself aloud in a\r\nragged hoarseness, very strangely: Every thought of mine now has a\r\nphysical effect on me!\r\n\r\nThey had not been two minutes together when she descended to them.  Yet\r\nshe saw the girl's heart brimming, either with some word spoken to her or\r\nfor joy of an unmaidenly confession.  During dinner they talked, without\r\ndistressful pauses.  Whatever said, whatever done, was manifestly another\r\ndrop in Nesta's foolish happy cup.  Could it be all because Dartrey\r\nFenellan countenanced her acquaintance with that woman?  The mother had\r\nlost hold of her.  The tortured mother had lost hold of herself.\r\n\r\nDartrey in the course of the evening, begged to hear the contralto; and\r\nNataly, refusing, was astounded by the admission in her blank mind of the\r\ntruth of man's list of charges against her sex, starting from their\r\ncapriciousness for she could have sung in a crowded room, and she had now\r\na desire for company, for stolid company or giddy, an ocean of it.  This\r\nled to her thinking, that the world of serious money-getters, and feasts,\r\nand the dance, the luxurious displays, and the reverential Sunday\r\nservice, will always ultimately prove itself right in opposition to\r\ncritics and rebels, and to any one vainly trying to stand alone: and the\r\nthought annihilated her; for she was past the age of the beginning again,\r\nand no footing was left for an outsider not self-justified in being where\r\nshe stood.  She heard Dartrey's praise of Nesta's voice for tearing her\r\nmother's bosom with notes of intolerable sweetness; and it was haphazard\r\nirony, no doubt; we do not the less bleed for the accident of a shot.\r\n\r\nAt last, after midnight Victor arrived.\r\n\r\nNesta most impudently expected to be allowed to remain.  'Pray, go,\r\ndear,' her mother said.  Victor kissed his Fredi.  'Some time to-morrow,'\r\nsaid he; and she forbore to beseech him.\r\n\r\nHe stared, though mildly, at sight of her taking Dartrey's hand for the\r\ngood-night and deliberately putting her lips to it.\r\n\r\nWas she a girl whose notion of rectifying one wrong thing done, was to do\r\nanother?  Nataly could merely observe.  A voice pertaining to no one\r\npresent, said in her ear:--Mothers have publicly slapped their daughter's\r\nfaces for less than that!--It was the voice of her incapacity to cope\r\nwith the girl.  She watched Nesta's passage from the room, somewhat\r\naffected by the simple bearing for which she was reproaching her.\r\n\r\n'And our poor darling has not seen a mountain this year!' Victor\r\nexclaimed, to have mentionable grounds for pitying his girl.  'I promised\r\nFredi she should never count a year without Highlands or Alps.  You\r\nremember, mama?--down in the West Highlands.  Fancy the dear bit of\r\nbundle, Dartrey!--we had laid her in her bed; she was about seven or\r\neight; and there she lay wide awake.  \"What 's Fredi thinking of?\"--\r\n\"I'm thinking of the tops of the mountains at night, dada.\"--She could\r\nclimb them now; she has the legs.'\r\n\r\nNataly said: 'You have some report to make.  You dined with those\r\npeople?'\r\n\r\n'The Marsetts: yes:--well-suited couple enough.  It's to happen before\r\nWinter ends--at once; before Christmas; positively before next Spring.\r\nFredi's doing!  He has to manage, arrange.--She's a good-looking woman,\r\ngood height, well-rounded; well-behaved, too: she won't make a bad Lady\r\nMarsett.  Every time that woman spoke of our girl, the tears jumped to\r\nher eyelids.'\r\n\r\n'Come to me before you go to bed,' Nataly said, rising, her voice\r\nfoundering; 'Good-night, Dartrey.'\r\n\r\nShe turned to the door; she could not trust herself to shake hands with\r\ncomposure.  Not only was it a nauseous mixture she was forced to gulp\r\nfrom Victor, it burned like a poison.\r\n\r\n'Really Fredi's doing--chiefly,' said Victor, as soon as Dartrey and he\r\nwere alone, comfortably settled in the smoking-room.  'I played the man\r\nof pomp with Marsett--good heavy kind of creature: attached to the woman.\r\nShe's the better horse, as far as brains go.  Good enough Lady Marsett.\r\nI harped on Major Worrell: my daughter insulted.  He knew of it--spoke\r\nof you properly.  The man offered all apologies; he has told the Major\r\nhe is no gentleman, not a fit associate for gentlemen:--quite so--and has\r\ncut him dead.  Will marry her, as I said, make her as worthy as he can of\r\nthe honour of my daughter's acquaintance.  Rather comical grimace, when\r\nhe vowed he'd fasten the tie.  He doesn't like marriage.  But, he can't\r\ngive her up.  And she's for patronizing the institution.  But she is\r\nready to say good-bye to him \"rather than see the truest lady in the\r\nworld insulted\"--her words.  And so he swallows his dose for health,\r\nand looks a trifle sourish.  Antecedents, I suppose: has to stomach them.\r\nBut if a man's fond of a woman--if he knows he saves her from slipping\r\nlower--and it's an awful world, for us to let a woman be under its\r\nwheels:--I say, a woman who has a man to lean on, unless she's as\r\ndownright corrupt as two or three of the men we've known:--upon my word,\r\nDartrey, I come round to some of your ideas on these matters.  It's this\r\ngirl of mine, this wee bit of girl in her little nightshirt with the\r\nfrill, astonishes me most:--\"thinking of the tops of the mountains at\r\nnight!\"  She has positively done the whole of this work-main part.\r\nI smiled when I left the house, to have to own our little Fredi starting\r\nus all on the road.  It seems, Marsett had sworn he would; amorous vow,\r\nyou know; he never came nearer to doing it.  I hope it's his better mind\r\nnow; I do hope the man won't have cause to regret it.  He speaks of\r\nNesta--sort of rustic tone of awe.  Mrs. Marsett has impressed him.  He\r\nexpects the title soon, will leave the army--the poor plucked British\r\narmy, as you call it!--and lead the life of a country squire: hunting!\r\nWell, it's not only the army, it's over Great Britain, with this infernal\r\nwealth of ours!--and all for pleasure--eh?--or Paradise lost for a sugar\r\nplum!  Eh, Dartrey?  Upon my word, it appears to me, Esau's the\r\nEnglishman, Jacob the German, of these times.  I wonder old Colney hasn't\r\nsaid it.  If we're not plucked, as your regiments are of the officers who\r\nhave learnt their work, we're emasculated:--the nation's half made-up of\r\nthe idle and the servants of the idle.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, and your country squires and your manufacturers contrive to give the\r\narmy a body of consumptive louts fit for nothing else than to take the\r\nshilling--and not worth it,' said Dartrey.\r\n\r\n'Sounds like old Colney,' Victor remarked to himself.  'But, believe me,\r\nI'm ashamed of the number of servants who wait on me.  It wouldn't so\r\nmuch matter, as Skepsey says, if they were trained to arms and self-\r\nrespect.  That little fellow Skepsey's closer to the right notion,\r\nand the right practice, too, than any of us.  With his Matilda Pridden!\r\nHe has jumped out of himself to the proper idea of women, too.  And\r\nthere's a man who has been up three times before the magistrates, and is\r\nconsidered a disorderly subject--one among the best of English citizens,\r\nI declare!  I never think of Skepsey without the most extraordinary,\r\nwitless kind of envy--as if he were putting in action an idea I once had\r\nand never quite got hold of again.  The match for him is Fredi.  She\r\nthreatens to be just as devoted, just as simple, as he.  I positively\r\ndoubt whether any of us could stop her, if she had set herself to do a\r\nthing she thought right.'\r\n\r\n'I should not like to think our trying it possible,' said Dartrey.\r\n\r\n'All very well, but it's a rock ahead.  We shall have to alter our\r\ncourse, my friend.  You know, I dined with that couple, after the private\r\ntwenty minutes with Marsett: he formally propounded the invitation, as we\r\nwere close on his hour, rather late: and I wanted to make the woman\r\nhappy, besides putting a seal of cordiality on his good intentions--\r\npolitic!  And subsequently I heard from her, that--you'll think nothing\r\nof it!--Fredi promised to stand by her at the altar.'\r\n\r\nDartrey said, shrugging: 'She needn't do that.'\r\n\r\n'So we may say.  You're dealing with Nesta Victoria.  Spare me a contest\r\nwith that girl, I undertake to manage any man or woman living.'\r\n\r\n'When the thing to be done is thought right by her.'\r\n\r\n'But can we always trust her judgement, my dear Dartrey?'\r\n\r\n'In this case, she would argue, that her resolution to keep her promise\r\nwould bind or help to bind Marsett to fulfil his engagement.'\r\n\r\n'Odd, her mother has turned dead round in favour of that fellow Dudley\r\nSowerby!  I don't complain; it suits; but one thinks--eh?--women!'\r\n\r\n'Well, yes, one thinks or should think, that if you insist on having\r\nwomen rooted to the bed of the river, they'll veer with the tides, like\r\nwater-weeds, and no wonder.'\r\n\r\n'Your heterodoxy on that subject is a mania, Dartrey.  We can't have\r\nwomen independent.'\r\n\r\n'Then don't be exclaiming about their vagaries.'\r\n\r\nVictor mused: 'It's wonderful: that little girl of mine!--good height\r\nnow: but what a head she has!  Oh, she'll listen to reason: only mark\r\nwhat I say:--with that quiet air of hers, the husband, if a young fellow,\r\nwill imagine she's the most docile of wives in the world.  And as to\r\nwife, I'm not of the contrary opinion.  But qua individual female,\r\nsupposing her to have laid fast hold of an idea of duty, it's he who'll\r\nhave to turn the corner second, if they're to trot in the yoke together.\r\nOr it may be an idea of service to a friend--or to her sex!  That Mrs.\r\nMarsett says she feels for--\"bleeds\" for her sex.  The poor woman didn't\r\nshow to advantage with me, because she was in a fever to please:--talks\r\nin jerks, hot phrases.  She holds herself well.  At the end of the dinner\r\nshe behaved better.  Odd, you can teach women with hints and a lead.  But\r\nMarsett 's Marsett to the end.  Rather touching!--the poor fellow said:\r\nDeuce of a bad look-out for me if Judith doesn't have a child!  First-\r\nrate sportsman, I hear.  He should have thought of his family earlier.\r\nYou know, Dartrey, the case is to be argued for the family as well.  You\r\nwon't listen.  And for Society too!  Off you go.'\r\n\r\nA battery was opened on that wall of composite.\r\n\r\n'Ah, well,' said Victor.  'But I may have to beg your help, as to the\r\nso-called promise to stand at the altar.  I don't mention it upstairs.'\r\n\r\nHe went to Nataly's room.\r\n\r\nShe was considerately treated, and was aware of being dandled, that she\r\nmight have sleep.\r\n\r\nShe consented to it, in a loathing of the topic.--Those women invade us\r\n--we cannot keep them out!  was her inward cry: with a reverberation of\r\nthe unfailing accompaniment: The world holds you for one of them!\r\n\r\nVictor tasked her too much when his perpetual readiness to doat upon his\r\ngirl for whatever she did, set him exalting Nesta's conduct.  She\r\nthought: Was Nesta so sympathetic with her mother of late by reason of a\r\nmoral insensibility to the offence?\r\n\r\nThis was her torture through the night of a labouring heart, that\r\ntravelled to one dull shock, again and again repeated:--the apprehended\r\nsound, in fact, of Dudley Sowerby's knock at the street door.  Or\r\nsometimes a footman handed her his letter, courteously phrased to\r\nwithdraw from the alliance.  Or else he came to a scene with Nesta, and\r\nher mother was dragged into it, and the intolerable subject steamed about\r\nher.  The girl was visioned as deadly.  She might be indifferent to the\r\nprotection of Dudley's name.  Robust, sanguine, Victor's child, she\r\nmight--her mother listened to a devil's whisper--but no; Nesta's aim was\r\nat the heights; she was pure in mind as in body.  No, but the world would\r\nbring the accusation; and the world would trace the cause: Heredity, it\r\nwould say.  Would it say falsely?  Nataly harped on the interrogation\r\nuntil she felt her existence dissolving to a dark stain of the earth, and\r\nshe found herself wondering at the breath she drew, doubting that another\r\nwould follow, speculating on the cruel force which keeps us to the act of\r\nbreathing.--Though I could draw wild blissful breath if I were galloping\r\nacross the moors!  her worn heart said to her youth: and out of ken of\r\nthe world, I could regain a portion of my self-esteem.  Nature thereat\r\nrenewed her old sustainment with gentle murmurs, that were supported by\r\nDr. Themison's account of the virtuous married lady who chafed at the\r\nyoke on behalf of her sex, and deemed the independent union the ideal.\r\nNataly's brain had a short gallop over moorland.  It brought her face to\r\nface with Victor's girl, and she dropped once more to her remorse in\r\nherself and her reproaches of Nesta.  The girl had inherited from her\r\nfather something of the cataract's force which won its way by catching or\r\nby mastering, uprooting, ruining!\r\n\r\nIn the morning she was heavily asleep.  Victor left word with Nesta,\r\nthat the dear mother was not to be disturbed.  Consequently, when Dudley\r\ncalled to see Mrs. Victor Radnor, he was informed that Miss Radnor would\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\nTheir interview lasted an hour.\r\n\r\nDudley came to Victor in the City about luncheon time.\r\n\r\nHis perplexity of countenance was eloquent.  He had, before seeing the\r\nyoung lady, digested an immense deal more, as it seemed to him, than any\r\nEnglish gentleman should be asked to consume.  She now referred him to\r\nher father, who had spent a day in Brighton, and would, she said, explain\r\nwhatever there was to be explained.  But she added, that if she was\r\nexpected to abandon a friend, she could not.  Dudley had argued with her\r\nupon the nature of friendship, the measurement of its various dues; he\r\nhad lectured on the choice of friends, the impossibility for young\r\nladies, necessarily inexperienced, to distinguish the right class of\r\nfriends, the dangers they ran in selecting friends unwarranted by the\r\nstamp of honourable families.\r\n\r\n'And what did Fredi say to that?' Victor inquired.\r\n\r\n'Miss Radnor said--I may be dense, I cannot comprehend--that the precepts\r\nwere suitable for seminaries of Pharisees.  When it is a question of a\r\nyoung lady associating with a notorious woman!'\r\n\r\n'Not notorious.  You spoil your case if you \"speak extremely,\" as a\r\nfriend says.  I saw her yesterday.  She worships \"Miss Radnor.\"'\r\n\r\nNesta will know when she is older; she will thank me,' said Dudley\r\nhurriedly.  'As it is at present, I may reckon, I hope, that the\r\nassociation ceases.  Her name: I have to consider my family.'\r\n\r\n'Good anchorage!  You must fight it out with the girl.  And depend upon\r\nthis--you're not the poorer for being the husband of a girl of character;\r\nunless you try to bridle her.  She belongs to her time.  I don't mind\r\nowning to you, she has given me a lead.--Fredi 'll be merry to-night.\r\nHere's a letter I have from the Sanfredini, dated Milan, fresh this\r\nmorning; invitation to bring the god-child to her villa on Como in May;\r\ndesirous to embrace her.  She wrote to the office.  Not a word of her\r\nduque.  She has pitched him to the winds.  You may like to carry it off\r\nto Fredi and please her.'\r\n\r\n'I have business,' Dudley replied.\r\n\r\n'Away to it, then!' said Victor.  'You stand by me?--we expect our South\r\nLondon borough to be open in January; early next year, at least; may be\r\nFebruary.  You have family interest there.'\r\n\r\n'Personally, I will do my best,' Dudley said; and he escaped, feeling,\r\nwith the universal censor's angry spite, that the revolutions of the\r\nworld had made one of the wealthiest of City men the head of a set of\r\nBohemians.  And there are eulogists of the modern time!  And the man's\r\ndaughter was declared to belong to it!  A visit in May to the Italian\r\ncantatrice separated from her husband, would render the maiden an\r\naccomplished flinger of caps over the windmills.\r\n\r\nAt home Victor discovered, that there was not much more than a truce\r\nbetween Nesta and Nataly.  He had a medical hint from Dr. Themison,\r\nand he counselled his girl to humour her mother as far as could be:\r\nparticularly in relation to Dudley, whom Nataly now, womanlike, after\r\nopposing, strongly favoured.  How are we ever to get a clue to the\r\nlabyrinthine convolutions and changeful motives of the sex!  Dartrey's\r\ntheories were absurd.  Did Nataly think them dangerous for a young woman?\r\nThe guess hinted at a clue of some sort to the secret of her veering.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sowerby left me with an adieu,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sowerby!  My dear, he is bound, bound in honour, bound at heart.\r\nYou did not dismiss him?'\r\n\r\n'I repeated the word he used.  I thought of mother.  The blood leaves her\r\ncheeks at a disappointment now.  She has taken to like him.'\r\n\r\n'Why, you like him!'\r\n\r\n'I could not vow.'\r\n\r\n'Tush.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, don't press me, dada.  But you will see, he has disengaged himself.'\r\n\r\nHe had done it, though not in formal speech.  Slow digestion of his\r\nnative antagonism to these Bohemians, to say nothing of his judicial\r\ncondemnation of them, brought him painfully round to the writing of a\r\nletter to Nataly; cunningly addressed to the person on whom his instinct\r\ntold him he had the strongest hold.\r\n\r\nShe schooled herself to discuss the detested matter forming Dudley's\r\ngrievance and her own with Nesta; and it was a woeful half-hour for them.\r\nBut Nataly was not the weeper.\r\n\r\nAnother interview ensued between Nesta and her suitor.  Dudley bore no\r\nresemblance to Mr. Barmby, who refused to take the word no from her, and\r\nhad taken it, and had gone to do holy work, for which she revered him.\r\nDudley took the word, leaving her to imagine freedom, until once more her\r\nmother or her father, inspired by him, came interceding, her mother\r\nactually supplicating.  So that the reality of Dudley's love rose to\r\nconception like a London dawn over Nesta; and how, honourably, decently,\r\npositively, to sever herself from it, grew to be an ill-visaged problem.\r\nShe glanced in soul at Dartrey Fenellan for help; she had her wild\r\nthoughts.  Having once called him Dartrey, the virginal barrier to\r\nthoughts was broken; and but for love of her father, for love and pity of\r\nher mother, she would have ventured the step to make the man who had her\r\nwhole being in charge accept or reject her.  Nothing else appeared in\r\nprospect.  Her father and mother were urgently one to favour Dudley; and\r\nthe sensitive gentleman presented himself to receive his wound and to\r\ndepart with it.  But always he returned.  At last, as if under tuition,\r\nhe refrained from provoking a wound; he stood there to win her upon any\r\nterms; and he was a handsome figure, acknowledged by the damsel to be\r\nincreasing in good looks as more and more his pretensions became\r\ndistasteful to her.  The slight cast of sourness on his lower features\r\nhad almost vanished, his nature seemed to have enlarged.  He complimented\r\nher for her 'generous benevolence,' vaguely, yet with evident\r\nsincereness; he admitted, that the modern world is 'attempting\r\ndifficulties with at least commendable intentions'; and that the position\r\nof women demands improvement, consideration for them also.  He said\r\nfeelingly: 'They have to bear extraordinary burdens!' There he stopped.\r\n\r\nThe sharp intelligence fronting him understood, that this compassionate\r\nejaculation was the point where she, too, must cry halt.  He had,\r\nhowever--still under tuition, perhaps--withdrawn his voice from the\r\npursuit of her; and so she in gratitude silenced her critical mind\r\nbeneath a smooth conceit of her having led him two steps to a broader\r\ntolerance.  Susceptible as she was, she did not influence him without\r\nbeing affected herself in other things than her vanity: his prudishness\r\naffected her.  Only when her heart flamed did she disdain that real haven\r\nof refuge, with its visionary mount of superiority, offered by Society to\r\nits effect, in the habit of ignoring the sins it fosters under cloak;--\r\nnot less than did the naked barbaric time, and far more to the vitiation\r\nof the soul.  He fancied he was moulding her; therefore winning her.\r\nIt followed, that he had the lover's desire for assurance of exclusive\r\npossession; and reflecting, that he had greatly pardoned, he grew\r\nexacting.  He mentioned his objections to some of Mr. Dartrey Fenellan's\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nNesta replied: 'I have this morning had two letters to make me happy.'\r\n\r\nA provoking evasion.  He would rather have seen antagonism bridle and\r\nstiffen her figure.  'Is one of them from that gentleman?'\r\n\r\n'One is from my dear friend Louise de Seilles.  She comes to me early\r\nnext month.'\r\n\r\n'The other?'\r\n\r\n'The other is also from a friend.'\r\n\r\n'A dear friend?'\r\n\r\n'Not so dear.  Her letter gives me happiness.'\r\n\r\n'She writes--not from France: from .  .  .?  you tempt me to guess.'\r\n\r\n'She writes to tell me, that Mr. Dartrey Fenellan has helped her in a way\r\nto make her eternally thankful.'\r\n\r\n'The place she writes from is .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\nThe drag of his lips betrayed his enlightenment insisted on doubting.\r\nHe demanded assurance.\r\n\r\n'It matters in no degree,' she said.\r\n\r\nDudley 'thought himself excusable for inquiring.'\r\n\r\nShe bowed gently.\r\n\r\nThe stings and scorpions and degrading itches of this nest of wealthy\r\nBohemians enraged him.\r\n\r\n'Are you--I beg to ask--are you still:--I can hardly think it--Nesta!--\r\nI surely have a claim to advise:--it cannot be with your mother's\r\nconsent:--in communication, in correspondence with .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\nAgain she bowed her head; saying: 'It is true.'\r\n\r\n'With that person?'\r\n\r\nHe could not but look the withering disgust of the modern world in a\r\nconservative gentleman who has been lured to go with it a little way,\r\nonly to be bitten.  'I decline to believe it,' he said with forcible\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n'She is married,' was the rather shameless, exasperating answer.\r\n\r\n'Married or not!' he cried, and murmured: 'I have borne--.  These may be\r\nMr. Dartrey Fenellan's ideas; they are not mine.  I have--Something at\r\nleast is due to me: Ask any lady:--there are clergymen, I know, clergymen\r\nwho are for uplifting--quite right, but not associating:--to call one of\r\nthem a friend!  Ask any lady, any!  Your mother .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'I beg you will not distress my mother,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'I beg to know whether this correspondence is to continue?' said Dudley.\r\n\r\n'All my life, if I do not feel dishonoured by it.'\r\n\r\n'You are.'  He added hastily: 'Counsels of prudence--there is not a lady\r\nliving who would tell you otherwise.  At all events, in public opinion,\r\nif it were known--and it would certainly be known,--a lady, wife or\r\nspinster, would suffer--would not escape the--at least shadow of\r\ndefilement from relationship, any degree of intimacy with .  .  .  hard\r\nwords are wholesome in such a case: \"touch pitch,\" yes!  My sense is\r\ncoherent.'\r\n\r\n'Quite,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'And you do not agree with me?'\r\n\r\n'I do not.'\r\n\r\n'Do you pretend to be as able to judge as I?'\r\n\r\n'In this instance, better.'\r\n\r\n'Then I retire.  I cannot retain my place here.  You may depend upon it,\r\nthe world is not wrong when it forbids young ladies to have cognizance of\r\nwomen leading disorderly lives.'\r\n\r\n'Only the women, Mr. Sowerby?'\r\n\r\n'Men, too, of course.'\r\n\r\n'You do not exclude the men from Society.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! one reads that kind of argument in books.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! the worthy books, then.  I would read them, if I could find them.'\r\n\r\n'They are banned by self-respecting readers.'\r\n\r\n'It grieves me to think differently.'\r\n\r\nDudley looked on this fair girl, as yet innocent girl; and contrasting\r\nher with the foulness of the subject she dared discuss, it seemed to him,\r\nthat a world which did not puff at her and silence, if not extinguish,\r\nwas in a state of liquefaction.\r\n\r\nRemembering his renewed repentances his absence, he said: 'I do hope you\r\nmay come to see, that the views shared by your mother and me are not\r\nerroneous.'\r\n\r\n'But do not distress her,' Nesta implored him.  'She is not well.  When\r\nshe has grown stronger, her kind heart will move her to receive the lady,\r\nso that she may not be deprived of the society of good women.  I shall\r\nhope she will not disapprove of me.  I cannot forsake a friend.'\r\n\r\n'I beg to say good-bye,' said Dudley.\r\n\r\nShe had seen a rigidity smite him as she spoke; and so little startling\r\nwas it, that she might have fancied it expected, save for her knowing\r\nherself too serious to have played at wiles to gain her ends.\r\n\r\nHe 'wished her prudent advisers.'\r\n\r\nShe thanked him.  'In a few days, Louise de Seilles will be here.'\r\n\r\nA Frenchwoman and Papist! was the interjection of his twist of brows.\r\n\r\nSurely I must now be free? she thought when he had covered his farewell\r\nunder a salutation regretful in frostiness.\r\n\r\nA week later, she had the embrace of her Louise, and Armandine was made\r\nhappy with a piece of Parisian riband.\r\n\r\nWinter was rapidly in passage: changes were visible everywhere; Earth and\r\nHouse of Commons and the South London borough exhibited them; Mrs. Burman\r\nwas the sole exception.  To the stupefaction of physicians, in a manner\r\nto make a sane man ask whether she was not being retained as an\r\ninstrument for one of the darker purposes of Providence--and where are we\r\nstanding if we ask such things?--she held on to her thread of life.\r\n\r\nFebruary went by.  And not a word from Themison; nor from Carling, nor\r\nfrom the Rev. Groseman Buttermore, nor from Jarniman.  That is to say,\r\nthe two former accepted invitations to grand dinners; the two latter\r\nacknowledged contributions to funds in which they were interested; but\r\nthey had apparently grown to consider Mrs. Burman as an establishment,\r\none of our fixtures.  On the other hand, there was nothing to be feared\r\nfrom her.  Lakelands feared nothing: the entry into Lakelands was decreed\r\nfor the middle of April.  Those good creatures enclosed the poor woman\r\nand nourished her on comfortable fiction.  So the death of the member for\r\nthe South London borough (fifteen years younger than the veteran in\r\nmaladies) was not to be called premature, and could by no possibility\r\nlead to an exposure of the private history of the candidate for his\r\nvacant seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nAN EXPIATION\r\n\r\nNataly had fallen to be one of the solitary who have no companionship\r\nsave with the wound they nurse, to chafe it rather than try at healing.\r\nSo rational a mind as she had was not long in outliving mistaken\r\nimpressions; she could distinguish her girl's feeling, and her aim; she\r\ncould speak on the subject with Dartrey; and still her wound bled on.\r\nLouise de Seilles comforted her partly, through an exaltation of Nesta.\r\nMademoiselle, however, by means of a change of tone and look when Dudley\r\nSowerby and Dartrey Fenellan were the themes, showed a too pronounced\r\npreference of the more unstable one:--or rather, the man adventurous out\r\nof the world's highways, whose image, as husband of such a daughter as\r\nhers, smote the wounded mother with a chillness.  Mademoiselle's\r\noccasional thrill of fervency in an allusion to Dartrey, might have\r\ntempted a suspicious woman to indulge suppositions, accounting for the\r\nyoung Frenchwoman's novel tenderness to England, of which Nesta proudly,\r\nvery happily boasted.  The suspicion proposed itself, and was rejected:\r\nfor not even the fever of an insane body could influence Nataly's\r\ngenerous character, to let her moods divert and command her thoughts of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts were at this time singularly lucid upon everything about\r\nher; with the one exception of the reason why she had come to favour\r\nDudley, and how it was she had been smitten by that woman at Brighton to\r\nsee herself in her position altogether with the world's relentless,\r\nunexamining hard eyes.  Bitterness added, of Mrs. Marsett: She is made an\r\nhonest woman!--And there was a strain of the lower in Nataly, to reproach\r\nthe girl for causing the reflection to be cast on the unwedded.\r\nOtherwise her mind was open; she was of aid to Victor in his confusion\r\nover some lost Idea he had often touched on latterly.  And she was the\r\none who sent him ahead at a trot under a light, by saying: 'You would\r\nfound a new and more stable aristocracy of the contempt of luxury' when\r\nhe talked of combatting the Jews with a superior weapon.  That being, in\r\nfact, as Colney Durance had pointed out to him, the weapon of self-\r\nconquest used by them 'before they fell away to flesh-pottery.'  Was it\r\nhis Idea?  He fancied an aching at the back of his head when he\r\nspeculated.  But his Idea had been surpassingly luminous, alive, a\r\ncreation; and this came before him with the yellow skin of a Theory,\r\nbred, born of books.  Though Nataly's mention of the aristocracy of\r\nself-denying discipline struck a Lucifer in his darkness.\r\n\r\nNesta likewise helped: but more in what she did than in what she said:\r\nshe spoke intelligently enough to make him feel a certain increase of\r\nalarm, amounting to a cursory secret acknowledgement of it, both at her\r\ndealings with Dudley and with himself.  She so quietly displaced the lady\r\nvisiting him at the City offices.  His girl's disregard of hostile\r\nweather, and her company, her talk, delighted him: still he remonstrated,\r\nat her coming daily.  She came: nor was there an instigation on the part\r\nof her mother, clearly none: her mother asked him once whether he thought\r\nshe met the dreadful Brighton woman.  His Fredi drove constantly to walk\r\nback beside him Westward, as he loved to do whenever it was practicable;\r\nand exceeding the flattery of his possession of the gallant daughter, her\r\nconversation charmed him to forget a disappointment caused by the defeat\r\nand entire exclusion of the lady visiting him so complimentarily for his\r\nadvice on stocks, shares, mines, et caetera.  The lady resisted; she was\r\nvanquished, as the shades are displaced by simple apparition of daylight.\r\n\r\nHis Fredi was like the daylight to him; she was the very daylight to his\r\nmind, whatsoever their theme of converse for by stimulating that ready\r\nbut vagrant mind to quit the leash of the powerful senses and be a\r\nethereally excursive, she gave him a new enjoyment; which led to\r\nreflections--a sounding of Nature, almost a question to her, on the verge\r\nof a doubt.  Are we, in fact, harmonious with the Great Mother when we\r\nyield to the pressure of our natures for indulgence?  Is she, when\r\ntranslated into us, solely the imperious appetite?  Here was Fredi, his\r\nlittle Fredi--stately girl that she had grown, and grave, too, for all\r\nher fun and her sail on wings--lifting him to pleasures not followed by\r\nclamorous, and perfectly satisfactory, yet discomposingly violent,\r\nappeals to Nature.  They could be vindicated.  Or could they, when they\r\nwould not bear a statement of the case?  He could not imagine himself\r\nstating it namelessly to his closest friend--not to Simeon Fenellan.  As\r\nfor speaking to Dartrey, the notion took him with shivers:--Young Dudley\r\nwould have seemed a more possible confidant:--and he represented the\r\nPuritan world.--And young Dudley was getting over Fredi's infatuation for\r\nthe woman she had rescued: he was beginning to fancy he saw a right\r\nenthusiasm in it;--in the abstract; if only the fair maid would drop an\r\nunseemly acquaintance.  He had called at the office to say so.  Victor\r\nstammered the plea for him.\r\n\r\n'Never, dear father,' came the smooth answer: a shocking answer in\r\ncontrast with the tones.  Her English was as lucid as her eyes when she\r\ncontinued up to the shock she dealt: 'Do not encourage a good man to\r\nwaste his thoughts upon me.  I have chosen my mate, and I may never marry\r\nhim.  I do not know whether he would marry me.  He has my soul.  I have\r\nno shame in saying I love him.  It is to love goodness, greatness of\r\nheart.  He is a respecter of women--of all women; not only the fortunate.\r\nHe is the friend of the weaker everywhere.  He has been proved in fire.\r\nHe does not sentimentalize over poor women, as we know who scorns people\r\nfor doing:--and that is better than hardness, meaning kindly.  He is not\r\none of the unwise advocates.  He measures the forces against them.  He\r\nreads their breasts.  He likes me.  He is with me in my plans.  He has\r\nnot said, has not shown, he loves me.  It is too high a thought for me\r\nuntil I hear it.'\r\n\r\n'Has your soul!' was all that Victor could reply, while the whole\r\nconception of Lakelands quaked under the crumbling structure.\r\n\r\nRemonstrance, argument, a word for Dudley, swelled to his lips and sank\r\nin dumbness.  Her seeming intuition--if it was not a perception--of the\r\npoint where submission to the moods of his nature had weakened his\r\ncharacter, and required her defence of him, struck Victor with a serious\r\nfear of his girl: and it was the more illuminatingly damnatory for being\r\nrecognized as the sentiment which no father should feel.  He tried to\r\nthink she ought not to be so wise of the things of the world.  An effort\r\nto imagine a reproof, showed him her spirit through her eyes: in her\r\ndeeds too: she had already done work on the road:--Colney Durance,\r\nDartrey Fenellan, anything but sentimentalists either of them, strongly\r\nbacking her, upholding her.  Victor could no longer so naturally name her\r\nFredi.\r\n\r\nHe spoke it hastily, under plea of some humorous tenderness, when he\r\nventured.  When Dudley, calling on him in the City to discuss the\r\ncandidature for the South London borough, named her Fredi, that he might\r\nregain a vantage of familiarity by imitating her father, it struck Victor\r\nas audacious.  It jarred in his recollection, though the heir of the\r\nearldom spoke in the tone of a lover, was really at high pitch.  He\r\nappeared to be appreciating her, to have suffered stings of pain; he\r\noffered himself; he made but one stipulation.  Victor regretfully assured\r\nhim, he feared he could do nothing.  The thought of his entry into\r\nLakelands, with Nesta Victoria refusing the foundation stone of the\r\nplace, grew dim.\r\n\r\nBut he was now canvassing for the Borough, hearty at the new business as\r\nthe braced swimmer on seas, which instantly he became, with an end in\r\nview to be gained.\r\n\r\nLate one April night, expecting Nataly to have gone to bed, and Nesta to\r\nbe waiting for him, he reached home, and found Nataly in her sitting-room\r\nalone.  'Nesta was tired,' she said: 'we have had a scene; she refuses\r\nMr. Sowerby; I am sick of pressing it; he is very much in earnest,\r\npainfully; she blames him for disturbing me; she will not see the right\r\ncourse:--a mother reads her daughter!  If my girl has not guidance!--\r\nshe means rightly, she is rash.'\r\n\r\nNataly could not utter all that her insaneness of feeling made her think\r\nwith regard to Victor's daughter--daughter also of the woman whom her\r\nhard conscience accused of inflammability.  'Here is a note from Dr.\r\nThemison, dear.'\r\n\r\nVictor seized it, perused, and drew the big breath.\r\n\r\n'From Themison,' he said; he coughed.\r\n\r\n'Don't think to deceive me,' said she.  'I have not read the contents,\r\nI know them.'\r\n\r\n'The invitation at last, for to-morrow, Sunday, four P.M.  Odd, that next\r\nday at eight of the evening I shall be addressing our meeting in the\r\nTheatre.  Simeon speaks.  Beaves Urmsing insists on coming, Tory though\r\nhe is.  Those Tories are jollier fellows than--well, no wonder!  There\r\nwill be no surgical .  .  .  the poor woman is very low.  A couple of\r\ndays at the outside.  Of course, I go.'\r\n\r\n'Hand me the note, dear.'\r\n\r\nIt had to be given up, out of the pocket.\r\n\r\n'But,' said Victor, 'the mention of you is merely formal.'\r\n\r\nShe needed sleep: she bowed her head.\r\n\r\nNataly was the first at the breakfast-table in the morning, a fair Sunday\r\nmorning.  She was going to Mrs. John Cormyn's Church, and she asked Nesta\r\nto come with her.\r\n\r\nShe returned five minutes before the hour of lunch, having left Nesta\r\nwith Mrs. John.  Louise de Seilles undertook to bring Nesta home at the\r\ntime she might choose.  Fenellan, Mr. Pempton, Peridon and Catkin,\r\nlunched and chatted.  Nataly chatted.  At a quarter to three o'clock\r\nVictor's carriage was at the door.  He rose: he had to keep an\r\nappointment.  Nataly said to him publicly: 'I come too.'  He stared and\r\nnodded.  In the carriage, he said: 'I'm driving to the Gardens, for a\r\nstroll, to have a look at the beasts.  Sort of relief.  Poor crazy woman!\r\nHowever, it 's a comfort to her: so .  .  .  !'\r\n\r\n'I like to see them,' said Nataly.  'I shall see her.  I have to do it.'\r\n\r\nUp to the gate of the Gardens Victor was arguing to dissuade his dear\r\nsoul from this very foolish, totally unnecessary, step.  Alighting, he\r\nput the matter aside, for good angels to support his counsel at the final\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nBears, lions, tigers, eagles, monkeys: they suggested no more than he\r\nwould have had from prints; they sprang no reflection, except, that the\r\ncoming hour was a matter of indifference to them.  They were about him,\r\nand exercised so far a distraction.  He took very kindly to an old mother\r\nmonkey, relinquishing her society at sight of Nataly's heave of the\r\nbosom.  Southward, across the park, the dread house rose.  He began\r\nquoting Colney Durance with relish while sarcastically confuting the\r\ncynic, who found much pasture in these Gardens.  Over Southward, too, he\r\nwould be addressing a popular assembly to-morrow evening.  Between now\r\nand then there was a ditch to jump.  He put on the sympathetic face of\r\ngrief.  'After all, a caged wild beast hasn't so bad a life,' he said.\r\n--To be well fed while they live, and welcome death as a release from the\r\nmaladies they develop in idleness, is the condition of wealthy people:--\r\ncreatures of prey? horrible thought! yet allied to his Idea, it seemed.\r\nYes, but these good caged beasts here set them an example, in not\r\ntroubling relatives and friends when they come to the gasp!  Mrs.\r\nBurman's invitation loomed as monstrous--a final act of her cruelty.\r\nHis skin pricked with dews.  He thought of Nataly beside him, jumping\r\nthe ditch with him, as a relief--if she insisted on doing it.  He hoped\r\nshe would not, for the sake of her composure.\r\n\r\nIt was a ditch void of bottom.  But it was a mere matter of an hour,\r\nless.  The state of health of the invalid could bear only a few minutes.\r\nIn any case, we are sure that the hour will pass.  Our own arrive?\r\nCertainly.\r\n\r\n'Capital place for children,' he exclaimed.  And here startlingly before\r\nhim in the clusters of boys and girls, was the difference between young\r\nones and their elders feeling quite as young: the careless youngsters\r\nhave not to go and sit in the room with a virulent old woman, and express\r\npenitence and what not, and hear words of pardon, after their holiday\r\nscamper and stare at the caged beasts.\r\n\r\nAttention to the children precipitated him upon acquaintances, hitherto\r\ncleverly shunned.  He nodded them off, after the brightest of greetings.\r\n\r\nSuch anodyne as he could squeeze from the incarcerated wild creatures,\r\nwas exhausted.  He fell to work at Nataly's 'aristocracy of the contempt\r\nof luxury'; signifying, that we the wealthy will not exist to pamper\r\nflesh, but we live for the promotion of brotherhood:--ay, and that our\r\nEngland must make some great moral stand, if she is not to fall to the\r\nrear and down.  Unuttered, it caught the skirts of the Idea: it\r\nevaporated when spoken.  Still, this theme was almost an exorcism\r\nof Mrs. Burman.  He consulted his watch.  'Thirteen minutes to four.\r\nI must be punctual,' he said.  Nataly stepped faster.\r\n\r\nSeated in the carriage, he told her he had never felt the horror of that\r\nplace before.  'Put me down at the corner of the terrace, dear: I won't\r\ndrive to the door.'\r\n\r\n'I come with you, Victor,' she replied.\r\n\r\nAfter entreaties and reasons intermixed, to melt her resolve, he saw she\r\nwas firm: and he asked himself, whether he might not be constitutionally\r\nbetter adapted to persuade than to dissuade.  The question thumped.\r\nHaving that house of drugs in view, he breathed more freely for the\r\nprospect of feeling his Nataly near him beneath the roof.\r\n\r\n'You really insist, dear love?' he appealed to her: and her answer: 'It\r\nmust be,' left no doubt: though he chose to say: 'Not because of standing\r\nby me?' And she said: 'For my peace, Victor.'  They stepped to the\r\npavement.  The carriage was dismissed.\r\n\r\nSeventeen houses of the terrace fronting the park led to the funereal\r\none: and the bell was tolled in the breast of each of the couple\r\nadvancing with an air of calmness to the inevitable black door.\r\n\r\nJarniman opened it.  'His mistress was prepared to see them.'--Not like\r\none near death.--They were met in the hall by the Rev. Groseman\r\nButtermore.  'You will find a welcome,' was his reassurance to them:\r\ngently delivered, on the stoop of a large person.  His whispered tones\r\nwere more agreeably deadening than his words.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttermore ushered them upstairs.\r\n\r\n'Can she bear it?' Victor said, and heard: 'Her wish ten minutes.'\r\n\r\n'Soon over,' he murmured to Nataly, with a compassionate exclamation for\r\nthe invalid.\r\n\r\nThey rounded the open door.  They were in the drawing-room.  It was\r\nfurnished as in the old time, gold and white, looking new; all the same\r\nas of old, save for a division of silken hangings; and these were pale\r\nblue: the colour preferred by Victor for a bedroom.  He glanced at the\r\nceiling, to bathe in a blank space out of memory.  Here she lived,--\r\nhere she slept, behind the hangings.  There was refreshingly that little\r\ndifference in the arrangement of the room.  The corner Northward was\r\noccupied by the grand piano; and Victor had an inquiry in him:--tuned?\r\nHe sighed, expecting a sight to come through the hangings.  Sensible that\r\nNataly trembled, he perceived the Rev. Groseman Buttermore half across a\r\nheap of shawl-swathe on the sofa.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman was present; seated.  People may die seated; she had always\r\ndisliked the extended posture; except for the night's rest, she used to\r\nsay; imagining herself to be not inviting the bolt of sudden death, in\r\nher attitude when seated by day:--and often at night the poor woman had\r\nto sit up for the qualms of her dyspepsia!--But I 'm bound to think\r\nhumanely, be Christian, be kind, benignant, he thought, and he fetched\r\nthe spirit required, to behold her face emerge from a pale blue silk\r\nveiling; as it were, the inanimate wasted led up from the mould by\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttermore signalled to them to draw near.\r\n\r\nWasted though it was, the face of the wide orbits for sunken eyes was\r\ndistinguishable as the one once known.  If the world could see it and\r\nhear, that it called itself a man's wife!  She looked burnt out.\r\n\r\nTwo chairs had been sent to front the sofa.  Execution there!  Victor\r\nthought, and he garrotted the unruly mind of a man really feeling\r\ndevoutness in the presence of the shadow thrown by the dread Shade.\r\n\r\n'Ten minutes,' Mr. Buttermore said low, after obligingly placing them on\r\nthe chairs.\r\n\r\nHe went.  They were alone with Mrs. Burman.\r\n\r\nNo voice came.  They were unsure of being seen by the floating grey of\r\neyes patient to gaze from their vast distance.  Big drops fell from\r\nNataly's.  Victor heard the French timepiece on the mantel-shelf, where a\r\nfamiliar gilt Cupid swung for the seconds: his own purchase.  The time of\r\nday on the clock was wrong; the Cupid swung.\r\n\r\nNataly's mouth was taking breath of anguish at moments.  More than a\r\nminute of the terrible length of the period of torture must have gone:\r\ntwo, if not three.\r\n\r\nA quaver sounded.  'You have come.'  The voice was articulate, thinner\r\nthan the telephonic, trans-Atlantic by deep-sea cable.\r\n\r\nVictor answered: 'We have.'\r\n\r\nAnother minute must have gone in the silence.  And when we get to five\r\nminutes we are on the descent, rapidly counting our way out of the house,\r\ninto the fresh air, where we were half an hour back, among those happy\r\nbeasts in the pleasant Gardens!\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman's eyelids shut.  'I said you would come.'\r\n\r\nVictor started to the fire-screen.  'Your sight requires protection.'\r\n\r\nShe dozed.  'And Natalia Dreighton !' she next said.\r\n\r\nThey were certainly now on the five minutes.  Now for the slide downward\r\nand outward!  Nataly should never have been allowed to come.\r\n\r\n'The white waistcoat!' struck his ears.\r\n\r\n'Old customs with me, always!' he responded.  'The first of April,\r\nalways.  White is a favourite.  Pale blue, too.  But I fear--I hope you\r\nhave not distressing nights?  In my family we lay great stress on the\r\nnights we pass.  My cousins, the Miss Duvidneys, go so far as to judge of\r\nthe condition of health by the nightly record.'\r\n\r\n'Your daughter was in their house.'\r\n\r\nShe knew everything!\r\n\r\n'Very fond of my daughter--the ladies,' he remarked.\r\n\r\n'I wish her well.'\r\n\r\n'You are very kind.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman communed within or slept.  'Victor, Natalia, we will pray,'\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nHer trembling hands crossed their fingers.  Nataly slipped to her knees.\r\n\r\nThe two women mutely praying, pulled Victor into the devotional hush.  It\r\nacted on him like the silent spell of service in a Church.  He forgot his\r\nestimate of the minutes, he formed a prayer, he refused to hear the Cupid\r\nswinging, he droned a sound of sentences to deaden his ears.  Ideas of\r\neternity rolled in semblance of enormous clouds.  Death was a black bird\r\namong them.  The piano rang to Nataly's young voice and his.  The gold\r\nand white of the chairs welcomed a youth suddenly enrolled among the\r\nwealthy by an enamoured old lady on his arm.  Cupid tick-ticked.--Poor\r\nsoul! poor woman!  How little we mean to do harm when we do an injury!\r\nAn incomprehensible world indeed at the bottom and at the top.  We get\r\non fairly at the centre.  Yet it is there that we do the mischief making\r\nsuch a riddle of the bottom and the top.  What is to be said!  Prayer\r\nquiets one.  Victor peered at Nataly fervently on her knees and Mrs.\r\nBurman bowed over her knotted fingers.  The earnestness of both enforced\r\nan effort at a phrased prayer in him.  Plungeing through a wave of the\r\nscent of Marechale, that was a tremendous memory to haul him backward and\r\nforward, he beheld his prayer dancing across the furniture; a diminutive\r\nthin black figure, elvish, irreverent, appallingly unlike his proper\r\nemotion; and he brought his hands just to touch, and got to the edge of\r\nhis chair, with split knees.  At once the figure vanished.  By merely\r\nlooking at Nataly, he passed into her prayer.  A look at Mrs. Burman made\r\nit personal, his own.  He heard the cluck of a horrible sob coming from\r\nhim.  After a repetition of his short form of prayer deeply stressed, he\r\nthanked himself with the word 'sincere,' and a queer side-thought on our\r\nhuman susceptibility to the influence of posture.  We are such creatures.\r\n\r\nNataly resumed her seat.  Mrs. Burman had raised her head.  She said: 'We\r\nare at peace.'  She presently said, with effort: 'It cannot last with me.\r\nI die in nature's way.  I would bear forgiveness with me, that I may have\r\nit above.  I give it here, to you, to all.  My soul is cleansed, I trust.\r\nMuch was to say.  My strength will not.  Unto God, you both!'\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Groseman Buttermore was moving on slippered step to the back of\r\nthe sofa.  Nataly dropped before the unseeing, scarce breathing, lady for\r\nan instant.  Victor murmured an adieu, grateful for being spared the\r\nceremonial shake of hands.  He turned away, then turned back, praying for\r\npower to speak, to say that he had found his heart, was grateful, would\r\nhold her in memory.  He fell on a knee before her, and forgot he had done\r\nso when he had risen.  They were conducted by the Rev. gentleman to the\r\nhall-door: he was not speechless.  Jarniman uttered something.\r\n\r\nThat black door closed behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT OF THE GREAT UNDELIVERED SPEECH\r\n\r\nTo a man issuing from a mortuary where a skull had voice, London may be\r\nrestorative as air of Summer Alps.  It is by contrast blooming life.\r\nObserve the fellowship of the houses shoulder to shoulder; and that\r\nstraight ascending smoke of the preparation for dinner; and the good\r\npoliceman yonder, blessedly idle on an orderly Sabbath evening; and the\r\nfamilies of the minor people trotting homeward from the park to tea; here\r\nand again an amiable carriage of the superimposed people driving to pay\r\nvisits; they are so social, friendly, inviting to him; they strip him of\r\nthe shroud, sing of the sweet old world.  He cannot but be moved to the\r\nextremity of the charitableness neighbouring on tears.\r\n\r\nA stupefaction at the shock of the positive reminder, echo of the fact\r\nstill shouting in his breast, that he had seen Mrs. Burman, and that the\r\ninterview was over--the leaf turned and the book shut held Victor in a\r\nsilence until his gratefulness to London City was borne down by the more\r\nhuman burst of gratitude to the dying woman, who had spared him, as much\r\nas she could, a scene of the convulsive pathetic, and had not called on\r\nhim for any utterance of penitence.  That worm-like thread of voice came\r\nup to him still from sexton-depths: it sounded a larger forgiveness\r\nwithout the word.  He felt the sorrow of it all, as he told Nataly; at\r\nthe same time bidding her smell 'the marvellous oxygen of the park.'  He\r\ndeclared it to be quite equal to Lakelands.\r\n\r\nShe slightly pressed his arm for answer.  Perhaps she did not feel so\r\ndeeply?  She was free of the horrid associations with the scent of\r\nMarechale.  At any rate, she had comported herself admirably!\r\n\r\nVictor fancied he must have shuddered when he passed by Jarniman at the\r\ndoor, who was almost now seeing his mistress's ghost--would have the\r\nprivilege to-morrow.  He called a cab and drove to Mrs. John Cormyn's,\r\nat Nataly's request, for Nesta and mademoiselle: enjoying the Londonized\r\nodour of the cab.  Nataly did not respond to his warm and continued\r\neulogies of Mrs. Burman; she rather disappointed him.  He talked of the\r\ngold and white furniture, he just alluded to the Cupid: reserving his\r\nmental comment, that the time-piece was all astray, the Cupid regular on\r\nthe swing:--strange, touching, terrible, if really the silly gilt figure\r\nsymbolized!  .  .  .  And we are a silly figure to be sitting in a cab\r\nimagining such things!--When Nesta and mademoiselle were opposite, he had\r\nthe pleasure to see Nataly take Nesta's hand and hold it until they\r\nreached home.  Those two talking together in the brief words of their\r\ndeep feeling, had tones that were singularly alike: the mezzo-soprano\r\nfilial to the divine maternal contralto.  Those two dear ones mounted to\r\nNataly's room.\r\n\r\nThe two dear ones showed themselves heart in heart together once more;\r\neach looked the happier for it.  Dartrey was among their dinner-guests,\r\nand Nataly took him to her little blue-room before she went to bed.  He\r\ndid not speak of their conversation to Victor, but counselled him to keep\r\nher from excitement.  'My dear fellow, if you had seen her with Mrs.\r\nBurman!'  Victor said, and loudly praised her coolness.  She was never\r\nbelow a situation, he affirmed.\r\n\r\nHe followed his own counsel to humour his Nataly.  She began panting at a\r\nword about Mr. Barmby's ready services.  When, however, she related the\r\nstate of affairs between Dartrey and Nesta, by the avowal of each of them\r\nto her, he said, embracing her: 'Your wisdom shall guide us, my love,'\r\nand almost extinguished a vexation by concealing it.\r\n\r\nShe sighed: 'If one could think, that a girl with Nesta's revolutionary\r\nideas of the duties of women, and their powers, would be safe--or at all\r\nrightly guided by a man who is both one of the noblest and the wildest in\r\nthe ideas he entertains!'\r\n\r\nVictor sighed too.  He saw the earldom, which was to dazzle the gossips,\r\ncrack on the sky in a futile rocket-bouquet.\r\n\r\nShe was distressed; she moaned: 'My girl!  my girl: I should wish to\r\nleave her with one who is more fixed--the old-fashioned husband.  New\r\nideas must come in politics, but in Society!--and for women!  And the\r\nyoung having heads, are the most endangered.  Nesta vows her life to it!\r\nDartrey supports her!'\r\n\r\n'See Colney,' said Victor.  'Odd, Colney does you good; some queer way he\r\nhas.  Though you don't care for his RIVAL TONGUES,--and the last number\r\nwas funny, with Semhians on the Pacific, impressively addressing a\r\nfarewell to his cricket-bat, before he whirls it away to Neptune--and the\r\nblue hand of his nation's protecting God observed to seize it!--Dead\r\nfailure with the public, of course!  However, he seems to seem wise with\r\nyou.  The poor old fellow gets his trouncing from the critics monthly.\r\nSee Colney to-morrow, my love.  Now go to sleep.  We have got over the\r\nworst.  I speak at my Meeting to-morrow and am a champagne-bottle of\r\nnotes and points for them.'\r\n\r\nHis lost Idea drew close to him in sleep: or he thought so, when awaking\r\nto the conception of a people solidified, rich and poor, by the common\r\npride of simple manhood.  But it was not coloured, not a luminous globe:\r\nand the people were in drab, not a shining army on the march to meet the\r\nFuture.  It looked like a paragraph in a newspaper, upon which a Leading\r\nArticle sits, dutifully arousing the fat worm of sarcastic humour under\r\nthe ribs of cradled citizens, with an exposure of its excellent folly.\r\nHe would not have it laughed at; still he could not admit it as more than\r\na skirt of the robe of his Idea.  For let none think him a mere City\r\nmerchant, millionnaire, boon-fellow, or music-loving man of the world.\r\nHe had ideas to shoot across future Ages;--provide against the shrinkage\r\nof our Coal-beds; against, and for, if you like, the thickening,\r\njumbling, threatening excess of population in these Islands, in Europe,\r\nAmerica, all over our habitable sphere.  Now that Mrs. Burman, on her way\r\nto bliss, was no longer the dungeon-cell for the man he would show\r\nhimself to be, this name for successes, corporate nucleus of the\r\nenjoyments, this Victor Montgomery Radnor, intended impressing himself\r\nupon the world as a factory of ideas.  Colney's insolent charge, that\r\nthe English have no imagination--a doomed race, if it be true!--would be\r\nconfuted.  For our English require but the lighted leadership to come\r\ninto cohesion, and step ranked, and chant harmoniously the song of their\r\nbenevolent aim.  And that astral head giving, as a commencement, example\r\nof the right use of riches, the nation is one, part of the riddle of the\r\nfuture solved.\r\n\r\nSurely he had here the Idea?  He had it so warmly, that his bath-water\r\nheated.  Only the vision was wanted.\r\n\r\nOn London Bridge he had seen it--a great thing done to the flash of\r\nbrilliant results.  That was after a fall.\r\n\r\nThere had been a fall also of the scheme of Lakelands.\r\n\r\nCome to us with no superstitious whispers of indications and\r\nsignifications in the fall!--But there had certainly been a moral fall,\r\nfully to the level of the physical, in the maintaining of that scheme of\r\nLakelands, now ruined by his incomprehensible Nesta--who had saved him\r\nfrom falling further.  His bath-water chilled.  He jumped out and rubbed\r\nfuriously with his towels and flesh-brushes, chasing the Idea for simple\r\nwarmth, to have Something inside him, to feel just that sustainment; with\r\nthe cry: But no one can say I do not love my Nataly!  And he tested it to\r\nprove it by his readiness to die for her: which is heroically easier than\r\nthe devotedly living, and has a weight of evidence in our internal Courts\r\nfor surpassing the latter tedious performance.\r\n\r\nHis Nesta had knocked Lakelands to pieces.  Except for the making of\r\nmoney, the whole year of an erected Lakelands, notwithstanding\r\nuninterrupted successes, was a blank.  Or rather we have to wish it were\r\na blank.  The scheme departs: payment for the enlisted servants of it is\r\nin prospect.  A black agent, not willingly enlisted, yet pointing to\r\nproofs of service, refuses payment in ordinary coin; and we tell him we\r\nowe him nothing, that he is not a man of the world, has no understanding\r\nof Nature: and still the fellow thumps and alarums at a midnight door we\r\nare astonished to find we have in our daylight house.  How is it?  Would\r\nother men be so sensitive to him?  Victor was appeased by the assurance\r\nof his possession of an exceptionally scrupulous conscience; and he\r\nsettled the debate by thinking: 'After all, for a man like me, battling\r\nincessantly, a kind of Vesuvius, I must have--can't be starved, must be\r\nfed--though, pah!  But I'm not to be questioned like other men.--But how\r\nabout an aristocracy of the contempt of distinctions?--But there is no\r\nescaping distinctions!  my aristocracy despises indulgence.--And\r\nindulges?--Say, an exceptional nature!  Supposing a certain beloved woman\r\nto pronounce on the case?--She cannot: no woman can be a just judge of\r\nit.'---He cried: My love of her is testified by my having Barmby handy to\r\nright her to-day, tomorrow, the very instant the clock strikes the hour\r\nof my release!\r\n\r\nMention of the clock swung that silly gilt figure.  Victor entered into\r\nit, condemned to swing, and be a thrall.  His intensity of sensation\r\nlaunched him on an eternity of the swinging in ridiculous nakedness to\r\nthe measure of time gone crazy.  He had to correct a reproof of Mrs.\r\nBurman, as the cause of the nonsense.  He ran down to breakfast, hopeing\r\nhe might hear of that clock stopped, and that sickening motion with it.\r\n\r\nAnother letter from the Sanfredini in Milan, warmly inviting to her villa\r\nover Como, acted on him at breakfast like the waving of a banner.  'We\r\ngo,' Victor said to Nataly, and flattered-up a smile about her lips--too\r\nmuch a resurrection smile.  There was talk of the Meeting at the theatre:\r\nSimeon Fenellan had spoken there in the cause of the deceased Member, was\r\nknown, and was likely to have a good reception.  Fun and enthusiasm might\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\n'And my darling will hear her husband speak to-night,' he whispered as he\r\nwas departing; and did a mischief, he had to fear, for a shadowy knot\r\ncrossed Nataly's forehead, she seemed paler.  He sent back Nesta and\r\nmademoiselle, in consequence, at the end of the Green Park.\r\n\r\nTheir dinner-hour was early; Simeon Fenellan, Colney Durance, and Mr.\r\nPeridon--pleasing to Nataly for his faithful siege of the French\r\nfortress--were the only guests.  When they rose, Nataly drew Victor\r\naside.  He came dismayed to Nesta.  She ran to her mother.  'Not hear\r\npapa speak?  Oh, mother, mother!  Then I stay with her.  But can't she\r\ncome?  He is going to unfold ideas to us.  There!'\r\n\r\n'My naughty girl is not to poke her fun at orators,' Nataly said.\r\n'No, dearest; it would agitate me to go.  I'm better here.  I shall be at\r\npeace when the night is over.'\r\n\r\n'But you will be all alone here, dear mother.'\r\n\r\nNataly's eyes wandered to fall on Colney.  He proposed to give her his\r\ncompany.  She declined it.  Nesta ventured another entreaty, either that\r\nshe might be allowed to stay or have her mother with her at the Meeting.\r\n\r\n'My love,' Nataly said, 'the thought of the Meeting--' She clasped at her\r\nbreast; and she murmured: 'I shall be comforted by your being with him.\r\nThere is no danger there.  But I shall be happy, I shall be at peace when\r\nthis night is over.'\r\n\r\nColney persuaded her to have him for companion.  Mr. Peridon, who was to\r\nhave driven with Nesta and mademoiselle, won admiration by proposing to\r\nstay for an hour and play some of Mrs. Radnor's favourite pieces.  Nesta\r\nand Victor overbore Nataly's objections to the lover's generosity.  So\r\nMr. Peridon was left.  Nesta came hurrying back from the step of the\r\ncarriage to kiss her mother again, saying: 'Just one last kiss, my own!\r\nAnd she's not to look troubled.  I shall remember everything to tell my\r\nown mother.  It will soon be over.'\r\n\r\nHer mother nodded; but the embrace was passionate.\r\n\r\nNesta called her father into the passage, bidding him prohibit any\r\ndelivery to her mother of news at the door.  'She is easily startled now\r\nby trifles--you have noticed?'\r\n\r\nVictor summoned his recollections and assured her he had noticed, as he\r\nbelieved he had 'The dear heart of her is fretting for the night to be\r\nover!  And think! seven days, and she is in Lakelands.  A fortnight, and\r\nwe have our first Concert.  Durandarte!  Oh, the dear heart 'll be at\r\npeace when I tell her of a triumphant Meeting.  Not a doubt of that, even\r\nthough Colney turns the shadow of his back on us.'\r\n\r\n'One critic the less for you!' said Nesta.  Skepsey was to meet her\r\ncarriage at the theatre.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, Victor and Simeon Fenellan were proceeding thitherward\r\non foot.\r\n\r\n'I have my speech,' said Victor.  'You prepare the way for me, following\r\nour influential friend Dubbleson; Colewort winds up; any one else they\r\nshout for.  We shall have a great evening.  I suspect I shall find\r\nThemison or Jarniman when I get home.  You don't believe in intimations?\r\nI've had crapy processions all day before my eyes.  No wonder, after\r\nyesterday!'\r\n\r\n'Dubbleson mustn't drawl it out too long,' said Fenellan.\r\n\r\n'We 'll drop a hint.  Where's Dartrey?'\r\n\r\n'He'll come.  He's in one of his black moods: not temper.  He's got a\r\nnotion he killed his wife by dragging her to Africa with him.  She was\r\nnot only ready to go, she was glad to go.  She had a bit of the heroine\r\nin her and a certainty of tripping to the deuce if she was left to\r\nherself.'\r\n\r\n'Tell Nataly that,' said Victor.  'And tell her about Dartrey.  Harp on\r\nit.  Once she was all for him and our girl.  But it's a woman--though the\r\ndearest!  I defy any one to hit on the cause of their changes.  We must\r\nmake the best of things, if we're for swimming.  The task for me to-night\r\nwill be, to keep from rolling out all I've got in my head.  And I'm not\r\nrevolutionary, I'm for stability.  Only I do see, that the firm stepping-\r\nplace asks for a long stride to be taken.  One can't get the English to\r\ntake a stride--unless it's for a foot behind them: bother old Colney!\r\nToo timid, or too scrupulous, down we go into the mire.  There!--But I\r\nwant to say it!  I want to save the existing order.  I want,\r\nChristianity, instead of the Mammonism we 're threatened with.\r\nGreat fortunes now are becoming the giants of old to stalk the land: or\r\nmediaeval Barons.  Dispersion of wealth, is the secret.  Nataly's of that\r\nmind with me.  A decent poverty!  She's rather wearying, wants a change.\r\nI've a steam-yacht in my eye, for next month on the Mediterranean.  All\r\nour set.  She likes quiet.  I believe in my political recipe for it.'\r\n\r\nHe thumped on a method he had for preserving aristocracy--true\r\naristocracy, amid a positively democratic flood of riches.\r\n\r\n'It appears to me, you're on the road of Priscilla Graves and Pempton,'\r\nobserved Simeon.  'Strike off Priscilla's viands and friend Pempton's\r\ncouple of glasses, and there's your aristocracy established; but with\r\nrather a dispersed recognition of itself.'\r\n\r\n'Upon my word, you talk like old Colney, except for a twang of your own,'\r\nsaid Victor.  'Colney sours at every fresh number of that Serial.  The\r\nlast, with Delphica detecting the plot of Falarique, is really not so\r\nbad.  The four disguised members of the Comedie Francaise on board the\r\nvessel from San Francisco, to declaim and prove the superior merits of\r\nthe Gallic tongue, jumped me to bravo the cleverness.  And Bobinikine\r\nturning to the complexion of the remainder of cupboard dumplings\r\ndiscovered in an emigrant's house-to-let!  And Semhians--I forget what\r\nand Mytharete's forefinger over the bridge of his nose, like a pensive\r\nvulture on the skull of a desert camel!  But, I complain, there's nothing\r\nto make the English love the author; and it's wasted, he's basted, and\r\nthe book 'll have no sale.  I hate satire.'\r\n\r\n'Rough soap for a thin skin, Victor.  Does it hurt our people much?'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit; doesn't touch them.  But I want my friends to succeed!'\r\n\r\nTheir coming upon Westminster Bridge changed the theme.  Victor wished\r\nthe Houses of Parliament to catch the beams of sunset.  He deferred to\r\nthe suggestion, that the Hospital's doing so seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\n'I'm always pleased to find a decent reason for what is,' he said.  Then\r\nhe queried: 'But what is, if we look at it, and while we look, Simeon?\r\nShe may be going--or she's gone already, poor woman!  I shall have that\r\nscene of yesterday everlastingly before my eyes, like a drop-curtain.\r\nOnly, you know, Simeon, they don't feel the end, as we in health imagine.\r\nColney would say, we have the spasms and they the peace.  I 've a mind to\r\nsend up to Regent's Park with inquiries.  It would look respectful.  God\r\nforgive me!--the poor woman perverts me at every turn.  Though I will\r\nsay, a certain horror of death I had--she whisked me out of it yesterday.\r\nI don't feel it any longer.  What are you jerking at?'\r\n\r\n'Only to remark, that if the thing's done for us, we haven't it so much\r\non our sensations.'\r\n\r\n'More, if we're sympathetic.  But that compels us to be philosophic--or\r\nwho could live!  Poor woman!'\r\n\r\n'Waft her gently, Victor!'\r\n\r\n'Tush!  Now for the South side of the Bridges; and I tell you, Simeon,\r\nwhat I can't mention to-night: I mean to enliven these poor dear people\r\non their forsaken South of the City.  I 've my scheme.  Elected or not,\r\nI shall hardly be accused of bribery when I put down my first\r\ninstalment.'\r\n\r\nFenellan went to work with that remark in his brain for the speech he was\r\nto deliver.  He could not but reflect on the genial man's willingness and\r\ncapacity to do deeds of benevolence, constantly thwarted by the position\r\ninto which he had plunged himself.\r\n\r\nThey were received at the verge of the crowd outside the theatre-doors by\r\nSkepsey, who wriggled, tore and clove a way for them, where all were\r\nobedient, but the numbers lumped and clogged.  When finally they reached\r\nthe stage, they spied at Nesta's box, during the thunder of the rounds of\r\napplause, after shaking hands with Mr. Dubbleson, Sir Abraham Quatley,\r\nDudley Sowerby, and others; and with Beaves Urmsing--a politician 'never\r\nof the opposite party to a deuce of a funny fellow!--go anywhere to hear\r\nhhm,' he vowed.\r\n\r\n'Miss Radnor and Mademoiselle de Seilles arrived quite safely,' said\r\nDudley, feasting on the box which contained them and no Dartrey Fenellan\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nNesta was wondering at Dartrey's absence.  Not before Mr. Dubbleson, the\r\nchairman, the 'gentleman of local influence,' had animated the drowsed\r\nwits and respiratory organs of a packed audience by yielding place to\r\nSimeon, did Dartrey appear.  Simeon's name was shouted, in proof of the\r\nhappy explosion of his first anecdote, as Dartrey took seat behind Nesta.\r\n'Half an hour with the dear mother,' he said.\r\n\r\nNesta's eyes thanked him.  She pressed the hand of a demure young woman\r\nsitting close behind.  Louise de Seilles.  'You know Matilda Pridden.'\r\n\r\nDartrey held his hand out.  'Has she forgiven me?'\r\n\r\nMatilda bowed gravely, enfolding her affirmative in an outline of the no\r\nneed for it, with perfect good breeding.  Dartrey was moved to think\r\nSkepsey's choice of a woman to worship did him honour.  He glanced at\r\nLouise.  Her manner toward Matilda Pridden showed her sisterly with\r\nNesta.  He said: 'I left Mr. Peridon playing.--A little anxiety to hear\r\nthat the great speech of the evening is done; it's nothing else.  I'll\r\nrun to her as soon as it's over.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, good of you!  And kind of Mr. Peridon!'  She turned to Louise, who\r\nsmiled at the simple art of the exclamation, assenting.\r\n\r\nVictor below, on the stage platform, indicated the waving of a hand\r\nto them, and his delight at Simeon's ringing points: which were, to\r\nDartrey's mind, vacuously clever and crafty.  Dartrey despised effects\r\nof oratory, save when soldiers had to be hurled on a mark--or citizens\r\nnerved to stand for their country.\r\n\r\nNesta dived into her father's brilliancy of appreciation, a trifle pained\r\nby Dartrey's aristocratic air when he surveyed the herd of heads agape\r\nand another cheer rang round.  He smiled with her, to be with her, at a\r\nhit here and there; he would not pretend an approval of this manner of\r\nwinning electors to consider the country's interests and their own.  One\r\nfellow in the crowded pit, affecting a familiarity with Simeon, that\r\npermitted the taking of liberties with the orator's Christian name,\r\nmildly amused him.  He had no objection to hear 'Simmy' shouted, as\r\nLouise de Seilles observed.  She was of his mind, in regard to the rough\r\nmachinery of Freedom.\r\n\r\nSkepsey entered the box.\r\n\r\n'We shall soon be serious, Miss Nesta,' he said, after a look at Matilda\r\nPridden.\r\n\r\nThere was a prolonged roaring--on the cheerful side.\r\n\r\n'And another word about security that your candidate will keep his\r\npromises,' continued Simeon: 'You have his word, my friends!'  And he\r\ntold the story of the old Governor of Goa, who wanted money and summoned\r\nthe usurers, and they wanted security; whereupon he laid his Hidalgo hand\r\non a cataract of Kronos-beard across his breast, and pulled forth three\r\nwhite hairs, and presented them: 'And as honourably to the usurious Jews\r\nas to the noble gentleman himself, that security was accepted!'\r\n\r\nEmerging from hearty clamours, the illustrative orator fell upon the\r\nquestion of political specifics:--Mr. Victor Radnor trusted to English\r\ngood sense too profoundly to be offering them positive cures, as they\r\nwould hear the enemy say he did.  Yet a bit of a cure may be offered,\r\nif we 're not for pushing it too far, in pursuit of the science of\r\nspecifics, in the style of the foreign physician, probably Spanish,\r\nwho had no practice, and wished for leisure to let him prosecute his\r\nanatomical and other investigations to discover his grand medical\r\nnostrum.  So to get him fees meanwhile he advertised a cure for\r\ndyspepsia--the resource of starving doctors.  And sure enough his patient\r\ncame, showing the grand fat fellow we may be when we carry more of the\r\ndeciduously mortal than of the scraggy vital upon our persons.  Any one\r\nat a glance would have prescribed water-cresses to him: water-cresses\r\nexclusively to eat for a fortnight.  And that the good physician did.\r\nAway went his patient, returning at the end of the fortnight, lean, and\r\nwith the appetite of a Toledo blade for succulent slices.  He vowed he\r\nwas the man.  Our estimable doctor eyed him, tapped at him, pinched his\r\ntender parts; and making him swear he was really the man, and had eaten\r\nnothing whatever but unadulterated water-cresses in the interval, seized\r\non him in an ecstasy by the collar of his coat, pushed him into the\r\nsurgery, knocked him over, killed him, cut him up, and enjoyed the\r\nfelicity of exposing to view the very healthiest patient ever seen under\r\ndissecting hand, by favour of the fortunate discovery of the specific for\r\nhim.  All to further science!--to which, in spite of the petitions of all\r\nthe scientific bodies of the civilized world, he fell a martyr on the\r\nscaffold, poor gentleman!  But we know politics to be no such empirical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nSimeon ingeniously interwove his analogy.  He brought it home to Beaves\r\nUrmsing, whose laugh drove any tone of apology out of it.  Yet the orator\r\nwas asked: 'Do you take politics for a joke, Simmy?'\r\n\r\nHe countered his questioner: 'Just to liberate you from your moribund\r\nstate, my friend.'  And he told the story of the wrecked sailor, found\r\nlying on the sands, flung up from the foundered ship of a Salvation\r\ncaptain, and how, that nothing could waken him, and there he lay fit for\r\ninterment; until presently a something of a voice grew down into his\r\nears; and it was his old chum Polly, whom he had tied to a board to give\r\nher a last chance in the surges; and Polly shaking the wet from her\r\nfeathers, and shouting: 'Polly tho dram dry!'--which struck on the nob of\r\nJack's memory, to revive all the liquorly tricks of the cabin under\r\nSalvationism, and he began heaving, and at last he shook in a lazy way,\r\nand then from sputter to sputter got his laugh loose; and he sat up, and\r\ncried; 'That did it!  Now to business!' for he was hungry.  'And when I\r\ncatch the ring of this world's laugh from you, my friend .  .  .  !'\r\nSimeon's application of the story was drowned.\r\n\r\nAfter the outburst, they heard his friend again interruptingly: 'You keep\r\nthat tongue of yours from wagging, as it did when you got round the old\r\nwidow woman for her money, Simmy !'\r\n\r\nVictor leaned forward.  Simeon towered.  He bellowed\r\n\r\n'And you keep that tongue of yours from committing incest on a lie!'\r\n\r\nIt was like a lightning-flash in the theatre.  The man went under.\r\nSimeon flowed.  Conscience reproached him with the little he had done for\r\nVictor, and he had now his congenial opportunity.\r\n\r\nUp in the box, the powers of the orator were not so cordially esteemed.\r\nTo Matilda Pridden, his tales were barely decently the flesh and the\r\ndevil smothering a holy occasion to penetrate and exhort.  Dartrey sat\r\nrigid, as with the checked impatience for a leap.  Nesta looked at Louise\r\nwhen some one was perceived on the stage bending to her father: It was\r\nMr. Peridon; he never once raised his face.  Apparently he was not\r\nintelligible or audible but the next moment Victor sprang erect.  Dartrey\r\nquitted the box.  Nesta beheld her father uttering hurried words to right\r\nand left.  He passed from sight, Mr. Peridon with him; and Dartrey did\r\nnot return.\r\n\r\nNesta felt her father's absence as light gone: his eyes rayed light.\r\nBesides she had the anticipation of a speech from him, that would win\r\nMatilda Pridden.  She fancied Simeon Fenellan to be rather under the\r\nspell of the hilarity he roused.  A gentleman behind him spoke in his\r\near; and Simeon, instead of ceasing, resumed his flow.  Matilda Pridden's\r\ngaze on him and the people was painful to behold: Nesta saw her mind.\r\nShe set herself to study a popular assembly.  It could be serious to the\r\ncall of better leadership, she believed.  Her father had been telling her\r\nof late of a faith he had in the English, that they (or so her\r\nintelligence translated his remarks) had power to rise to spiritual\r\nascendancy, and be once more the Islanders heading the world of a new\r\nepoch abjuring materialism--some such idea; very quickening to her, as it\r\nwould be to this earnest young woman worshipped by Skepsey.  Her father's\r\nabsence and the continued shouts of laughter, the insatiable thirst for\r\nfun, darkened her in her desire to have the soul of the good working\r\nsister refreshed.  They had talked together; not much: enough for each to\r\nsee at either's breast the wells from the founts of life.\r\n\r\nThe box-door opened, Dartrey came in.  He took her hand.  She stood-up to\r\nhis look.  He said to Matilda Pridden: 'Come with us; she will need you.'\r\n\r\n'Speak it,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe said to the other: 'She has courage.'\r\n\r\n'I could trust to her,' Matilda Pridden replied.\r\n\r\nNesta read his eyes.  'Mother?'\r\n\r\nHis answer was in the pressure.\r\n\r\n'Ill?'\r\n\r\n'No longer.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  Dartrey.'  Matilda Pridden caught her fast.\r\n\r\n'I can walk, dear,' Nesta said.\r\n\r\nDartrey mentioned her father.\r\n\r\nShe understood: 'I am thinking of him.'\r\n\r\nThe words of her mother: 'At peace when the night is over,' rang.  Along\r\nthe gassy passages of the back of tie theatre, the sound coming from an\r\napplausive audience was as much a thunder as rage would have been.  It\r\nwas as void of human meaning as a sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST\r\n\r\nIn the still dark hour of that April morning, the Rev. Septimus Barmby\r\nwas roused by Mr. Peridon, with a scribbled message from Victor, which he\r\ndeciphered by candlelight held close to the sheet of paper, between short\r\ninquiries and communications, losing more and more the sense of it as his\r\nintelligence became aware of what dread blow had befallen the stricken\r\nman.  He was bidden come to fulfil his promise instantly.  He remembered\r\nthe bearing of the promise.  Mr. Peridon's hurried explanatory narrative\r\nmade the request terrific, out of tragically lamentable.  A semblance of\r\nobedience had to be put on, and the act of dressing aided it.  Mr. Barmby\r\nprayed at heart for guidance further.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen drove Westward, speaking little; they had the dry sob\r\nin the throat.\r\n\r\n'Miss Radnor?'  Mr. Barmby asked.\r\n\r\n'She is shattered; she holds up; she would not break down.'\r\n\r\n'I can conceive her to possess high courage.'\r\n\r\n'She has her friend Mademoiselle de Seilles.'\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby remained humbly silent.  Affectionate deep regrets moved him\r\nto say: 'A loss irreparable.  We have but one voice of sorrow.  And how\r\nsudden!  The dear lady had no suffering, I trust.'\r\n\r\n'She fell into the arms of Mr. Durance.  She died in his arms.  She was\r\nunconscious, he says.  I left her straining for breath.  She said\r\n\"Victor\"; she tried to smile:--I understood I was not to alarm him.'\r\n\r\n'And he too late!'\r\n\r\n'He was too late, by some minutes.'\r\n\r\n'At least I may comfort.  Miss Radnor must be a blessing to him.'\r\n\r\n'They cannot meet.  Her presence excites him.'\r\n\r\nThat radiant home of all hospitality seemed opening on from darker\r\nchambers to the deadly dark.  The immorality in the moral situation could\r\nnot be forgotten by one who was professionally a moralist.  But an\r\nincorruptible beauty in the woman's character claimed to plead for her\r\nmemory.  Even the rigorous in defence of righteous laws are softened by a\r\nsinner's death to hear excuses, and may own a relationship, haply\r\nperceive the faint nimbus of the saint.  Death among us proves us to be\r\nstill not so far from the Nature saying at every avenue to the mind:\r\n'Earth makes all sweet.'\r\n\r\nMr. Durance had prophesied a wailful end ever to the carol of Optimists!\r\nYet it is not the black view which is the right view.  There is one\r\nbetween: the path adopted by Septimus Barmby:--if he could but induce his\r\nbrethren to enter on it!  The dreadful teaching of circumstances might\r\nhelp to the persuading of a fair young woman, under his direction .  .  .\r\nhaving her hand disengaged.  Mr. Barmby started himself in the dream of\r\nhis uninterred passion for the maiden: he chased it, seized it, hurled it\r\nhence, as a present sacrilege:--constantly, and at the pitch of our\r\nhighest devotion to serve, are we assailed by the tempter!  Is it, that\r\nthe love of woman is our weakness?  For if so, then would a celibate\r\nclergy have grant of immunity.  But, alas, it is not so with them!  We\r\nhave to deplore the hearing of reports too credible.  Again we are pushed\r\nto contemplate woman as the mysterious obstruction to the perfect purity\r\nof soul.  Nor is there a refuge in asceticism.  No more devilish\r\nnourisher of pride do we find than in pain voluntarily embraced.  And\r\nstrangely, at the time when our hearts are pledged to thoughts upon\r\nothers, they are led by woman to glance revolving upon ourself, our vile\r\nself!  Mr. Barmby clutched it by the neck.\r\n\r\nLight now, as of a strong memory of day along the street, assisted him to\r\nforget himself at the sight of the inanimate houses of this London, all\r\nrevealed in a quietness not less immobile than tombstones of an unending\r\ncemetery, with its last ghost laid.  Did men but know it!--The habitual\r\nnecessity to amass matter for the weekly sermon, set him noting his\r\nmeditative exclamations, the noble army of platitudes under haloes, of\r\ngood use to men: justifiably turned over in his mind for their good.  He\r\nhad to think, that this act of the justifying of the act reproached him\r\nwith a lack of due emotion, in sympathy with agonized friends truly dear.\r\nDrawing near the hospitable house, his official and a cordial emotion\r\nunited, as we see sorrowful crape-wreathed countenances.  His heart\r\nstruck heavily when the house was visible.\r\n\r\nCould it be the very house?  The look of it belied the tale inside.  But\r\nthat threw a ghostliness on the look.\r\n\r\nSome one was pacing up and down.  They greeted Dudley Sowerby.  His\r\nability to speak was tasked.  They gathered, that mademoiselle and 'a\r\nMiss Pridden' were sitting with Nesta, and that their services in a\r\ncrisis had been precious.  At such times, one of them reflected, woman\r\nhas indeed her place: when life's battle waxes red.  Her soul must be\r\ncapable of mounting to the level of the man's, then?  It is a lesson!\r\n\r\nDudley said he was waiting for Dr. Themison to come forth.  He could not\r\ntear himself from sight of the house.\r\n\r\nThe door opened to Dr. Themison departing, Colney Durance and Simeon\r\nFenellan bare-headed.  Colney showed a face with stains of the lashing of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nDr. Themison gave his final counsels.  'Her father must not see her.  For\r\nhim, it may have to be a specialist.  We will hope the best.  Mr. Dartrey\r\nFenellan stays beside him:--good.  As to the ceremony he calls for, a\r\nform of it might soothe:--any soothing possible!  No music.  I will\r\nreturn in a few hours.'\r\n\r\nHe went on foot.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby begged advice from Colney and Simeon concerning the message he\r\nhad received--the ceremony requiring his official presidency.  Neither of\r\nthem replied.  They breathed the morning air, they gave out long-drawn\r\nsighs of relief, looking on the trees of the park.\r\n\r\nA man came along the pavement, working slow legs hurriedly.  Simeon ran\r\ndown to him.\r\n\r\n'Humour, as much as you can,' Colney said to Mr. Barmby.  'Let him\r\nimagine.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Radnor?'\r\n\r\n'Not to speak of her.'\r\n\r\n'The daughter he so loves?'\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby's tender inquisitiveness was unanswered.  Were they inducing\r\nhim to mollify a madman?  But was it possible to associate the idea of\r\nmadness with Mr. Radnor?\r\n\r\nSimeon ran back.  'Jarniman,' he remarked.  'It's over!'\r\n\r\n'Now!' Colney's shoulders expressed the comment.  'Well, now, Mr. Barmby,\r\nyou can do the part desired.  Come in.  It's morning!' He stared at the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nAll except Dudley passed in.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby wanted more advice, his dilemma being acute.  It was\r\nmoderated, though not more than moderated, when he was informed of the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Burman Radnor; an event that occurred, according to\r\nJarniman's report, forty-five minutes after Skepsey had a second time\r\ncalled for information of it at the house in Regent's Park--five hours\r\nand a half, as Colney made his calculation, after the death of Nataly.\r\nHe was urged by some spur of senseless irony to verify the calculation\r\nand correct it in the minutes.\r\n\r\nDudley crossed the road.  No sign of the awful interior was on any of the\r\nwindows of the house either to deepen awe or relieve.  They were blank as\r\neyeballs of the mindless.  He shivered.  Death is our common cloak; but\r\nCalamity individualizes, to set the unwounded speculating whether indeed\r\na stricken man, who has become the cause of woeful trouble, may not be\r\npointing a moral.  Pacing on the Park side of the house, he saw Skepsey\r\ndrive up and leap out with a gentleman, Mr. Radnor's lawyer.  Could it\r\nbe, that there was no Will written?  Could a Will be executed now?  The\r\nmoral was more forcibly suggested.  Dudley beheld this Mr. Victor Radnor\r\nsuccessful up all the main steps, persuasive, popular, brightest of the\r\nelect of Fortune, felled to the ground within an hour, he and all his\r\nhouse!  And if at once to pass beneath the ground, the blow would have\r\nseemed merciful for him.  Or if, instead of chattering a mixture of the\r\nrational and the monstrous, he had been heard to rave like the utterly\r\ndistraught.  Recollection of some of the things he shouted, was an\r\nanguish: A notion came into the poor man, that he was the dead one of the\r\ntwo, and he cried out: 'Cremation?  No, Colney's right, it robs us of our\r\nlast laugh.  I lie as I fall.'  He 'had a confession for his Nataly, for\r\nher only, for no one else.'  He had 'an Idea.'  His begging of Dudley to\r\nlisten without any punctilio (putting a vulgar oath before it), was the\r\nsole piece of unreasonableness in the explanation of the idea: and that\r\nwas not much wilder than the stuff Dudley had read from reports of\r\nRadical speeches.  He told Dudley he thought him too young to be 'best\r\nman to a widower about to be married,' and that Barmby was 'coming all\r\nhaste to do the business, because of no time to spare.'\r\n\r\nDudley knew but the half, and he did not envy Dartrey Fenellan his task\r\nof watching over the wreck of a splendid intelligence, humouring and\r\nrestraining.  According to the rumours, Mr. Radnor had not shown the\r\nsymptoms before the appearance of his daughter.  For awhile he hung, and\r\nthen fell, like an icicle.  Nesta came with a cry for her father.  He\r\nrose: Dartrey was by.  Hugged fast in iron muscles, the unhappy creature\r\nraved of his being a caged lion.  These things Dudley had heard in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThere are scenes of life proper to the grave-cloth.\r\n\r\nNataly's dead body was her advocate with her family, with friends, with\r\nthe world.  Victor had more need of a covering shroud to keep calamity\r\nrespected.  Earth makes all sweet: and we, when the privilege is granted\r\nus, do well to treat the terribly stricken as if they had entered to the\r\nbosom of earth.\r\n\r\nThat night's infinite sadness was concentrated upon Nesta.  She had need\r\nof her strength of mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe night went past as a year.  The year followed it as a refreshing\r\nnight.  Slowly lifting her from our abysses, it was a good angel to the\r\ngirl.  Permission could not be given for her to see her father.  She had\r\na home in the modest home of Louise de Seilles on the borders of\r\nDauphins; and with French hearts at their best in winningness around her,\r\nshe learned again, as an art, the natural act of breathing calmly; she\r\nhad by degrees a longing for the snow-heights.  When her imagination\r\ncould perch on them with love and pride, she began to recover the throb\r\nfor a part in human action.  It set her nature flowing to the mate she\r\nhad chosen, who was her counsellor, her supporter, and her sword.  She\r\nhad awakened to new life, not to sink back upon a breast of love, though\r\nthoughts of the lover were as blows upon strung musical chords of her\r\nbosom.  Her union with Dartrey was for the having an ally and the being\r\nan ally, in resolute vision of strife ahead, through the veiled dreams\r\nthat bear the blush.  This was behind a maidenly demureness.  Are not\r\nyoung women hypocrites?  Who shall fathom their guile!  A girl with a\r\npretty smile, a gentle manner, a liking for wild flowers up on the rocks;\r\nand graceful with resemblances to the swelling proportions of garden-\r\nfruits approved in young women by the connoisseur eye of man; distinctly\r\ndesigned to embrace the state of marriage, that she might (a girl of\r\nsingularly lucid and receptive eyes) the better give battle to men\r\ntouching matters which they howl at an eccentric matron for naming.\r\nSo it was.  And the yielding of her hand to Dartrey, would have appeared\r\nat that period of her revival, as among the baser compliances of the\r\nfleshly, if she had not seen in him, whom she owned for leader, her\r\nfellow soldier, warrior friend, hero, of her own heart's mould, but a\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nShe was on Como, at the villa of the Signora Giulia Sanfredini, when\r\nDudley's letter reached her, with the supplicating offer of the share of\r\nhis earldom.  An English home meanwhile was proposed to her at the house\r\nof his mother the Countess.  He knew that he did not write to a brilliant\r\nheiress.  The generosity she had always felt that he possessed, he thus\r\nproved in figures.  They are convincing and not melting.  But she was\r\nmoved to tears by his goodness in visiting her father, as well as by the\r\nhopeful news he sent.  He wrote delicately, withholding the title of her\r\nfather's place of abode.  There were expectations of her father's perfect\r\nrecovery; the signs were auspicious; he appeared to be restored to the\r\n'likeness to himself' in the instances Dudley furnished:--his appointment\r\nwith him for the flute-duet next day; and particularly his enthusiastic\r\nsatisfaction with the largeness and easy excellent service of the\r\nresidence 'in which he so happily found himself established.'  He held it\r\nto be, 'on the whole, superior to Lakelands.'  The smile and the tear\r\nrolled together in Nesta reading these words.  And her father spoke\r\nrepeatedly of longing to embrace his Fredi, of the joy her last letter\r\nhad given him, of his intention to send an immediate answer: and he\r\nshowed Dudley a pile of manuscript ready for the post.  He talked of\r\npublic affairs, was humorous over any extravagance or eccentricity in the\r\nviews he took; notably when he alluded to his envy of little Skepsey.  He\r\nsaid he really did envy; and his daughter believed it and saw fair\r\nprospects in it.\r\n\r\nHer grateful reply to the young earl conveyed all that was perforce\r\nungentle, in the signature of the name of Nesta Victoria Fenellan:--\r\na name he was to hear cited among the cushioned conservatives, and plead\r\nfor as he best could under a pressure of disapprobation, and compelled\r\nesteem, and regrets.\r\n\r\nThe day following the report of her father's wish to see her, she and her\r\nhusband started for England.  On that day, Victor breathed his last.\r\nDudley had seen the not hopeful but an ominous illumination of the\r\nstricken man; for whom came the peace his Nataly had in earth.  Often did\r\nNesta conjure up to vision the palpitating form of the beloved mother\r\nwith her hand at her mortal wound in secret through long years of the\r\nwearing of the mask to keep her mate inspirited.  Her gathered knowledge\r\nof things and her ruthless penetrativeness made it sometimes hard for her\r\nto be tolerant of a world, whose tolerance of the infinitely evil stamped\r\nblotches on its face and shrieked in stains across the skin beneath its\r\ngallant garb.  That was only when she thought of it as the world\r\ncondemning her mother.  She had a husband able and ready, in return for\r\ncorrections of his demon temper, to trim an ardent young woman's\r\nfanatical overflow of the sisterly sentiments; scholarly friends, too,\r\nfor such restrainings from excess as the mind obtains in a lamp of\r\nHistory exhibiting man's original sprouts to growth and fitful\r\ncontinuation of them.  Her first experience of the grief that is in\r\npleasure, for those who have passed a season, was when the old Concert-\r\nset assembled round her.  When she heard from the mouth of a living\r\nwoman, that she had saved her from going under the world's waggon-wheels,\r\nand taught her to know what is actually meant by the good living of a\r\nshapely life, Nesta had the taste of a harvest happiness richer than her\r\nrecollection of the bride's, though never was bride in fuller flower to\r\nher lord than she who brought the dower of an equal valiancy to Dartrey\r\nFenellan.  You are aware of the reasons, the many, why a courageous young\r\nwoman requires of high heaven, far more than the commendably timid, a\r\ndoughty husband.  She had him; otherwise would that puzzled old world,\r\nwhich beheld her step out of the ranks to challenge it, and could not\r\nblast her personal reputation, have commissioned a paw to maul her\r\ncharacter, perhaps instructing the gossips to murmur of her parentage.\r\nNesta Victoria Fenellan had the husband who would have the world\r\nrespectful to any brave woman.  This one was his wife.\r\n\r\nDaniel Skepsey rejoices in service to his new master, owing to the\r\nscientific opinion he can at any moment of the day apply for, as to the\r\nmilitary defences of the country; instead of our attempting to arrest the\r\nenemy by vociferations of persistent prayer:--the sole point of\r\ndifference between him and his Matilda; and it might have been fatal but\r\nthat Nesta's intervention was persuasive.  The two members of the Army\r\nfirst in the field to enrol and give rank according to the merits of\r\neither, to both sexes, were made one.  Colney Durance (practically\r\ncynical when not fancifully, men said) stood by Skepsey at the altar.\r\nHis published exercises in Satire produce a flush of the article in the\r\nReviews of his books.  Meat and wine in turn fence the Hymen beckoning\r\nPriscilla and Mr. Pempton.  The forms of Religion more than the Channel's\r\ndivision of races keep Louise de Seilles and Mr. Peridon asunder: and in\r\nthe uniting of them Colney is interested, because it would have so\r\npleased the woman of the loyal heart no longer beating.  He let Victor's\r\nend be his expiation and did not phrase blame of him.  He considered the\r\nshallowness of the abstract Optimist exposed enough in Victor's history.\r\nHe was reconciled to it when, looking on their child, he discerned, that\r\nfor a cancelling of the errors chargeable to them, the father and mother\r\nhad kept faith with Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\nAn incomprehensible world indeed at the bottom and at the top\r\nArrest the enemy by vociferations of persistent prayer\r\nCountry prizing ornaments higher than qualities\r\nDeath is our common cloak; but Calamity individualizes\r\nHow little we mean to do harm when we do an injury\r\nNation's half made-up of the idle and the servants of the idle\r\nNo companionship save with the wound they nurse\r\nNot always the right thing to do the right thing\r\nThe night went past as a year\r\nUniversal censor's angry spite\r\n\r\n\r\n[The End]",
