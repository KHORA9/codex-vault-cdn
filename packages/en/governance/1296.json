Since the death of her worthy husband, and the comfortable\r\nsettlement in life of her youngest daughter, Miss Jenny, who was married\r\nlast year to Mr Caption, writer to the signet, she has been, as she told\r\nus herself, \"beeking in the lown o' the conquest which the gudeman had,\r\nwi' sic an ettling o' pains and industry, gathered for his family.\"\r\n\r\nOur conversation naturally diverged into various topics, and, among\r\nothers, we discoursed at large on the manifold improvements which had\r\ntaken place, both in town and country, since we had visited the Royal\r\nBurgh.  This led the widow, in a complimentary way, to advert to the hand\r\nwhich, it is alleged, we have had in the editing of that most excellent\r\nwork, entitled, \"Annals of the Parish of Dalmailing,\" intimating, that\r\nshe had a book in the handwriting of her deceased husband, the Provost,\r\nfilled with a variety of most curious matter; in her opinion, of far more\r\nconsequence to the world than any book that we had ever been concerned in\r\nputting out.\r\n\r\nConsidering the veneration in which Mr Pawkie had been through life\r\nregarded by his helpmate, we must confess that her eulogium on the merits\r\nof his work did not impress us with the most profound persuasion that it\r\nwas really deserving of much attention.  Politeness, however, obliged us\r\nto express an earnest desire to see the volume, which, after some little\r\nhesitation, was produced.  Judge, then, of the nature of our emotions,\r\nwhen, in cursorily turning over a few of the well-penned pages, we found\r\nthat it far surpassed every thing the lady had said in its praise.  Such,\r\nindeed was our surprise, that we could not refrain from openly and at\r\nonce assuring her, that the delight and satisfaction which it was\r\ncalculated to afford, rendered it a duty on her part to lose no time in\r\nsubmitting it to the public; and, after lavishing a panegyric on the\r\nsingular and excellent qualities of the author, which was all most\r\ndelicious to his widow, we concluded with a delicate insinuation of the\r\npleasure we should enjoy, in being made the humble instrument of\r\nintroducing to the knowledge of mankind a volume so replete and enriched\r\nwith the fruits of his practical wisdom.  Thus, partly by a judicious\r\nadministration of flattery, and partly also by solicitation, backed by an\r\nindirect proposal to share the profits, we succeeded in persuading Mrs\r\nPawkie to allow us to take the valuable manuscript to Edinburgh, in order\r\nto prepare it for publication.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained possession of the volume, we lost no time till we had\r\nmade ourselves master of its contents.  It appeared to consist of a\r\nseries of detached notes, which, together, formed something analogous to\r\nan historical view of the different important and interesting scenes and\r\naffairs the Provost had been personally engaged in during his long\r\nmagisterial life.  We found, however that the concatenation of the\r\nmemoranda which he had made of public transactions, was in several places\r\ninterrupted by the insertion of matter not in the least degree\r\ninteresting to the nation at large; and that, in arranging the work for\r\nthe press, it would be requisite and proper to omit many of the notes and\r\nmuch of the record, in order to preserve the historical coherency of the\r\nnarrative.  But in doing this, the text has been retained inviolate, in\r\nso much that while we congratulate the world on the addition we are thus\r\nenabled to make to the stock of public knowledge, we cannot but\r\nfelicitate ourselves on the complete and consistent form into which we\r\nhave so successfully reduced our precious materials; the separation of\r\nwhich, from the dross of personal and private anecdote, was a task of no\r\nsmall difficulty; such, indeed, as the editors only of the autographic\r\nmemoirs of other great men can duly appreciate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I--THE FORECAST\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed in the world, that a man who has thrice reached the\r\nhighest station of life in his line, has a good right to set forth the\r\nparticulars of the discretion and prudence by which he lifted himself so\r\nfar above the ordinaries of his day and generation; indeed, the\r\ngenerality of mankind may claim this as a duty; for the conduct of public\r\nmen, as it has been often wisely said, is a species of public property,\r\nand their rules and observances have in all ages been considered things\r\nof a national concernment.  I have therefore well weighed the importance\r\nit may be of to posterity, to know by what means I have thrice been made\r\nan instrument to represent the supreme power and authority of Majesty in\r\nthe royal burgh of Gudetown, and how I deported myself in that honour and\r\ndignity, so much to the satisfaction of my superiors in the state and\r\ncommonwealth of the land, to say little of the great respect in which I\r\nwas held by the townsfolk, and far less of the terror that I was to evil-\r\ndoers.  But not to be over circumstantial, I propose to confine this\r\nhistory of my life to the public portion thereof, on the which account I\r\nwill take up the beginning at the crisis when I first entered into\r\nbusiness, after having served more than a year above my time, with the\r\nlate Mr Thomas Remnant, than whom there was not a more creditable man in\r\nthe burgh; and he died in the possession of the functionaries and\r\nfaculties of town-treasurer, much respected by all acquainted with his\r\norderly and discreet qualities.\r\n\r\nMr Remnant was, in his younger years, when the growth of luxury and\r\nprosperity had not come to such a head as it has done since, a tailor\r\nthat went out to the houses of the adjacent lairds and country gentry,\r\nwhereby he got an inkling of the policy of the world, that could not have\r\nbeen gathered in any other way by a man of his station and degree of\r\nlife.  In process of time he came to be in a settled way, and when I was\r\nbound 'prentice to him, he had three regular journeymen and a cloth shop.\r\nIt was therefore not so much for learning the tailoring, as to get an\r\ninsight in the conformity between the traffic of the shop and the board\r\nthat I was bound to him, being destined by my parents for the profession\r\nappertaining to the former, and to conjoin thereto something of the\r\nmercery and haberdashery: my uncle, that had been a sutler in the army\r\nalong with General Wolfe, who made a conquest of Quebec, having left me a\r\nlegacy of three hundred pounds because I was called after him, the which\r\nlegacy was a consideration for to set me up in due season in some genteel\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as I have narrated, when I had passed a year over my\r\n'prenticeship with Mr Remnant, I took up the corner shop at the Cross,\r\nfacing the Tolbooth; and having had it adorned in a befitting manner,\r\nabout a month before the summer fair thereafter, I opened it on that day,\r\nwith an excellent assortment of goods, the best, both for taste and\r\nvariety, that had ever been seen in the burgh of Gudetown; and the winter\r\nfollowing, finding by my books that I was in a way to do so, I married my\r\nwife: she was daughter to Mrs Broderip, who kept the head inn in Irville,\r\nand by whose death, in the fall of the next year, we got a nest egg,\r\nthat, without a vain pretension, I may say we have not failed to lay\r\nupon, and clock to some purpose.\r\n\r\nBeing thus settled in a shop and in life, I soon found that I had a part\r\nto perform in the public world; but I looked warily about me before\r\ncasting my nets, and therefore I laid myself out rather to be entreated\r\nthan to ask; for I had often heard Mr Remnant observe, that the nature of\r\nman could not abide to see a neighbour taking place and preferment of his\r\nown accord.  I therefore assumed a coothy and obliging demeanour towards\r\nmy customers and the community in general; and sometimes even with the\r\nvery beggars I found a jocose saying as well received as a bawbee,\r\nalthough naturally I dinna think I was ever what could be called a funny\r\nman, but only just as ye would say a thought ajee in that way.  Howsever,\r\nI soon became, both by habit and repute, a man of popularity in the town,\r\nin so much that it was a shrewd saying of old James Alpha, the\r\nbookseller, that \"mair gude jokes were cracked ilka day in James Pawkie's\r\nshop, than in Thomas Curl, the barber's, on a Saturday night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--A KITHING\r\n\r\n\r\nI could plainly discern that the prudent conduct which I had adopted\r\ntowards the public was gradually growing into effect.  Disputative\r\nneighbours made me their referee, and I became, as it were, an oracle\r\nthat was better than the law, in so much that I settled their\r\ncontroversies without the expense that attends the same.  But what\r\nconvinced me more than any other thing that the line I pursued was\r\nverging towards a satisfactory result, was, that the elderly folk that\r\ncame into the shop to talk over the news of the day, and to rehearse the\r\ndiverse uncos, both of a national and a domestic nature, used to call me\r\nbailie and my lord; the which jocular derision was as a symptom and\r\nforetaste within their spirits of what I was ordained to be.  Thus was I\r\nencouraged, by little and little, together with a sharp remarking of the\r\ninclination and bent of men's minds, to entertain the hope and assurance\r\nof rising to the top of all the town, as this book maketh manifest, and\r\nthe incidents thereof will certificate.\r\n\r\nNothing particular, however, came to pass, till my wife lay in of her\r\nsecond bairn, our daughter Sarah; at the christening of whom, among\r\ndivers friends and relations, forbye the minister, we had my father's\r\ncousin, Mr Alexander Clues, that was then deacon convener, and a man of\r\ngreat potency in his way, and possessed of an influence in the\r\ntown-council of which he was well worthy, being a person of good\r\ndiscernment, and well versed in matters appertaining to the guildry.  Mr\r\nClues, as we were mellowing over the toddy bowl, said, that by and by the\r\ncouncil would be looking to me to fill up the first gap that might happen\r\ntherein; and Dr Swapkirk, the then minister, who had officiated on the\r\noccasion, observed, that it was a thing that, in the course of nature,\r\ncould not miss to be, for I had all the douce demeanour and sagacity\r\nwhich it behoved a magistrate to possess.  But I cannily replied, though\r\nI was right contented to hear this, that I had no time for governing, and\r\nit would be more for the advantage of the commonwealth to look for the\r\ncounselling of an older head than mine, happen when a vacancy might in\r\nthe town-council.\r\n\r\nIn this conjuncture of our discoursing, Mrs Pawkie, my wife, who was\r\nsitting by the fireside in her easy chair, with a cod at her head, for\r\nshe had what was called a sore time o't, said:--\r\n\r\n\"Na, na, gudeman, ye need na be sae mim; every body kens, and I ken too,\r\nthat ye're ettling at the magistracy.  It's as plain as a pikestaff,\r\ngudeman, and I'll no let ye rest if ye dinna mak me a bailie's wife or a'\r\nbe done\"--\r\n\r\nI was not ill pleased to hear Mrs Pawkie so spiritful; but I replied,\r\n\r\n\"Dinna try to stretch your arm, gude-wife, further than your sleeve will\r\nlet you; we maun ca'canny mony a day yet before we think of dignities.\"\r\n\r\nThe which speech, in a way of implication, made Deacon Clues to\r\nunderstand that I would not absolutely refuse an honour thrust upon me,\r\nwhile it maintained an outward show of humility and moderation.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a gleg old carlin among the gossips then present, one\r\nMrs Sprowl, the widow of a deceased magistrate, and she cried out aloud:--\r\n\r\n\"Deacon Clues, Deacon Clues, I redd you no to believe a word that Mr\r\nPawkie's saying, for that was the very way my friend that's no more laid\r\nhimself out to be fleeched to tak what he was greenan for; so get him\r\nintill the council when ye can: we a' ken he'll be a credit to the\r\nplace,\" and \"so here's to the health of Bailie Pawkie that is to be,\"\r\ncried Mrs Sprowl.  All present pledged her in the toast, by which we had\r\na wonderful share of diversion.  Nothing, however, immediately rose out\r\nof this, but it set men's minds a-barming and working; so that, before\r\nthere was any vacancy in the council, I was considered in a manner as the\r\nnatural successor to the first of the counsellors that might happen to\r\ndepart this life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--A DIRGIE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the summer following the baptism, of which I have\r\nrehearsed the particulars in the foregoing chapter, Bailie Mucklehose\r\nhappened to die, and as he was a man long and well respected, he had a\r\ngreat funeral.  All the rooms in his house were filled with company; and\r\nit so fell out that, in the confusion, there was neither minister nor\r\nelder to give the blessing sent into that wherein I was, by which, when\r\nMr Shavings the wright, with his men, came in with the service of bread\r\nand wine as usual, there was a demur, and one after another of those\r\npresent was asked to say grace; but none of them being exercised in\r\npublic prayer, all declined, when Mr Shavings said to me, \"Mr Pawkie, I\r\nhope ye'll no refuse.\"\r\n\r\nI had seen in the process, that not a few of the declinations were more\r\nout of the awkward shame of blateness, than any inherent modesty of\r\nnature, or diffidence of talent; so, without making a phrase about the\r\nmatter, I said the grace, and in such a manner that I could see it made\r\nan impression.  Mr Shavings was at that time deacon of the wrights, and\r\nbeing well pleased with my conduct on this occasion, when he, the same\r\nnight, met the craft, he spoke of it in a commendable manner; and as I\r\nunderstood thereafter, it was thought by them that the council could not\r\ndo better than make choice of me to the vacancy.  In short, not to spin\r\nout the thread of my narration beyond necessity, let it here suffice to\r\nbe known, that I was chosen into the council, partly by the strong\r\nhandling of Deacon Shavings, and the instrumentality of other friends and\r\nwell-wishers, and not a little by the moderation and prudence with which\r\nI had been secretly ettling at the honour.\r\n\r\nHaving thus reached to a seat in the council, I discerned that it behoved\r\nme to act with circumspection, in order to gain a discreet dominion over\r\nthe same, and to rule without being felt, which is the great mystery of\r\npolicy.  With this intent, I, for some time, took no active part in the\r\ndeliberations, but listened, with the doors of my understanding set wide\r\nto the wall, and the windows of my foresight all open; so that, in\r\nprocess of time, I became acquainted with the inner man of the\r\ncounsellors, and could make a guess, no far short of the probability, as\r\nto what they would be at, when they were jooking and wising in a round-\r\nabout manner to accomplish their own several wills and purposes.  I soon\r\nthereby discovered, that although it was the custom to deduce reasons\r\nfrom out the interests of the community, for the divers means and\r\nmeasures that they wanted to bring to a bearing for their own particular\r\nbehoof, yet this was not often very cleverly done, and the cloven foot of\r\nself-interest was now and then to be seen aneath the robe of public\r\nprinciple.  I had, therefore, but a straightforward course to pursue, in\r\norder to overcome all their wiles and devices, the which was to make the\r\ninterests of the community, in truth and sincerity, the end and object of\r\nmy study, and never to step aside from it for any immediate speciality of\r\nprofit to myself.  Upon this, I have endeavoured to walk with a constancy\r\nof sobriety; and although I have, to a certainty, reaped advantage both\r\nin my own person and that of my family, no man living can accuse me of\r\nhaving bent any single thing pertaining to the town and public, from the\r\nnatural uprightness of its integrity, in order to serve my own private\r\nends.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, sometime before an occasion came to pass, wherein I\r\ncould bring my knowledge and observations to operate in any effectual\r\nmanner towards a reformation in the management of the burgh; indeed, I\r\nsaw that no good could be done until I had subdued the two great\r\nfactions, into which it may be said the council was then divided; the one\r\nparty being strong for those of the king's government of ministers, and\r\nthe other no less vehement on the side of their adversaries.  I,\r\ntherefore, without saying a syllable to any body anent the same, girded\r\nmyself for the undertaking, and with an earnest spirit put my shoulder to\r\nthe wheel, and never desisted in my endeavours, till I had got the cart\r\nup the brae, and the whole council reduced into a proper state of\r\nsubjection to the will and pleasure of his majesty, whose deputies and\r\nagents I have ever considered all inferior magistrates to be,\r\nadministering and exercising, as they do, their power and authority in\r\nhis royal name.\r\n\r\nThe ways and means, however, by which this was brought to pass, supply\r\nmatter for another chapter; and after this, it is not my intent to say\r\nany thing more concerning my principles and opinions, but only to show\r\nforth the course and current of things proceeding out of the affairs, in\r\nwhich I was so called to form a part requiring no small endeavour and\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV--THE GUILDRY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, as is related in the foregoing chapter, I had nourished my\r\nknowledge of the council into maturity, I began to cast about for the\r\nmeans of exercising the same towards a satisfactory issue.  But in this I\r\nfound a great difficulty, arising from the policy and conduct of Mr\r\nAndrew M'Lucre, who had a sort of infeftment, as may be said, of the\r\noffice of dean of guild, having for many years been allowed to intromit\r\nand manage the same; by which, as was insinuated by his adversaries, no\r\nlittle grist came to his mill.  For it had happened from a very ancient\r\ndate, as far back, I have heard, as the time of Queen Anne, when the\r\nunion of the kingdoms was brought to a bearing, that the dean of guild\r\namong us, for some reason or another, had the upper hand in the setting\r\nand granting of tacks of the town lands, in the doing of which it was\r\njealoused that the predecessors of Mr M'Lucre, no to say an ill word of\r\nhim, honest man, got their loofs creeshed with something that might be\r\ncalled agrassum, or rather, a gratis gift.  It therefore seemed to me\r\nthat there was a necessity for some reformation in the office, and I\r\nforesaw that the same would never be accomplished, unless I could get Mr\r\nM'Lucre wised out of it, and myself appointed his successor.  But in this\r\nlay the obstacle; for every thing anent the office was, as it were, in\r\nhis custody, and it was well known that he had an interest in keeping by\r\nthat which, in vulgar parlance, is called nine points of the law.\r\nHowever, both for the public good and a convenience to myself, I was\r\nresolved to get a finger in the dean of guild's fat pie, especially as I\r\nforesaw that, in the course of three or four years, some of the best\r\ntacks would run out, and it would be a great thing to the magistrate that\r\nmight have the disposal of the new ones.  Therefore, without seeming to\r\nhave any foresight concerning the lands that were coming on to be out of\r\nlease, I set myself to constrain Mr M'Lucre to give up the guildry, as it\r\nwere, of his own free-will; and what helped me well to this, was a rumour\r\nthat came down from London, that there was to be a dissolution of the\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nThe same day that this news reached the town, I was standing at my shop-\r\ndoor, between dinner and tea-time.  It was a fine sunny summer afternoon.\r\nStanding under the blessed influence of the time by myself at my shop-\r\ndoor, who should I see passing along the crown of the causey, but Mr\r\nM'Lucre himself and with a countenance knotted with care, little in\r\nunison with the sultry indolence of that sunny day.\r\n\r\n\"Whar awa sae fast, dean o' guild?\" quo' I to him; and he stopped his\r\nwide stepping, for he was a long spare man, and looting in his gait.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just,\" said he, \"taking a step to the provost's, to learn the\r\nparticulars of thir great news--for, as we are to hae the casting vote in\r\nthe next election, there's no saying the good it may bring to us all gin\r\nwe manage it wi' discretion.\"\r\n\r\nI reflected the while of a minute before I made any reply, and then I\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"It would hae nae doubt of the matter, Mr M'Lucre, could it be brought\r\nabout to get you chosen for the delegate; but I fear, as ye are only dean\r\nof guild this year, that's no to be accomplished; and really, without the\r\nlike of you, our borough, in the contest, may be driven to the wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Contest!\" cried the dean of guild, with great eagerness; \"wha told you\r\nthat we are to be contested?\"\r\n\r\nNobody had told me, nor at the moment was I sensible of the force of what\r\nI said; but, seeing the effect it had on Mr M'Lucre, I replied,--\r\n\r\n\"It does not, perhaps, just now do for me to be more particular, and I\r\nhope what I have said to you will gang no further; but it's a great pity\r\nthat ye're no even a bailie this year, far less the provost, otherwise I\r\nwould have great confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the dean of guild, \"you have reason to believe that there is\r\nto be a dissolution, and that we are to be contested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr M'Lucre, dinna speer any questions,\" was my answer, \"but look at that\r\nand say nothing;\" so I pulled out of my pocket a letter that had been\r\nfranked to me by the earl.  The letter was from James Portoport, his\r\nlordship's butler, who had been a waiter with Mrs Pawkie's mother, and he\r\nwas inclosing to me a five-pound note to be given to an auld aunty that\r\nwas in need.  But the dean of guild knew nothing of our correspondence,\r\nnor was it required that he should.  However, when he saw my lord's\r\nfranking, he said, \"Are the boroughs, then, really and truly to be\r\ncontested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come into the shop, Mr M'Lucre,\" said I sedately; \"come in, and hear\r\nwhat I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he came in, and I shut and barred the half-door, in order that we\r\nmight not be suddenly interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"You are a man of experience, Mr M'Lucre,\" said I, \"and have a knowledge\r\nof the world, that a young man, like me, would be a fool to pretend to.\r\nBut I have shown you enough to convince you that I would not be worthy of\r\na trust, were I to answer any improper questions.  Ye maun, therefore,\r\ngie me some small credit for a little discretion in this matter, while I\r\nput a question to yourself.  'Is there no a possibility of getting you\r\nmade the provost at Michaelmas, or, at the very least, a bailie, to the\r\nend that ye might be chosen delegate, it being an unusual thing for\r\nanybody under the degree of a bailie to be chosen thereto?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been so long in the guildry,\" was his thoughtful reply, \"that I\r\nfear it canna be very well managed without me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr M'Lucre,\" said I, and I took him cordially by the hand, \"a thought\r\nhas just entered my head.  Couldna we manage this matter between us?  It's\r\ntrue I'm but a novice in public affairs, and with the mystery of the\r\nguildry quite unacquaint--if, however, you could be persuaded to allow\r\nyourself to be made a bailie, I would, subject to your directions,\r\nundertake the office of dean of guild, and all this might be so concerted\r\nbetween us, that nobody would ken the nature of our paction--for, to be\r\nplain with you, it's no to be hoped that such a young counsellor as\r\nmyself can reasonably expect to be raised, so soon as next Michaelmas, to\r\nthe magistracy, and there is not another in the council that I would like\r\nto see chosen delegate at the election but yourself.\"\r\n\r\nMr M'Lucre swithered a little at this, fearing to part with the bird he\r\nhad in hand; but, in the end, he said, that he thought what was proposed\r\nno out of the way, and that he would have no objection to be a bailie for\r\nthe next year, on condition that I would, in the following, let him again\r\nbe dean of guild, even though he should be called a Michaelmas mare, for\r\nit did not so well suit him to be a bailie as to be dean of guild, in\r\nwhich capacity he had been long used.\r\n\r\nI guessed in this that he had a vista in view of the tacks and leases\r\nthat were belyve to fall in, and I said--\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can be more reasonable, Mr M'Lucre; for the office of dean of\r\nguild must be a very fashious one, to folks like me, no skilled in its\r\nparticularities; and I'm sure I'll be right glad and willing to give it\r\nup, when we hae got our present turn served.--But to keep a' things quiet\r\nbetween us, let us no appear till after the election overly thick;\r\nindeed, for a season, we maun fight, as it were, under different\r\ncolours.\"\r\n\r\nThus was the seed sown of a great reformation in the burgh, the sprouting\r\nwhereof I purpose to describe in due season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--THE FIRST CONTESTED ELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sough of the dissolution of parliament, during the whole of the\r\nsummer, grew stronger and stronger, and Mr M'Lucre and me were seemingly\r\npulling at opposite ends of the rope.  There was nothing that he proposed\r\nin the council but what I set myself against with such bir and vigour,\r\nthat sometimes he could scarcely keep his temper, even while he was\r\nlaughing in his sleeve to see how the other members of the corporation\r\nwere beglammered.  At length Michaelmas drew near, when I, to show, as it\r\nwere, that no ill blood had been bred on my part, notwithstanding our\r\nbickerings, proposed in the council that Mr M'Lucre should be the new\r\nbailie; and he on his part, to manifest, in return, that there was as\r\nlittle heart-burning on his, said \"he would have no objections; but then\r\nhe insisted that I should consent to be dean of guild in his stead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" said he in the council on that occasion, \"that Mr Pawkie is\r\nas yet but a greenhorn in the concerns of the burgh: however, he'll never\r\nlearn younger, and if he'll agree to this, I'll gie him all the help and\r\ninsight that my experience enables me to afford.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first, I pretended that really, as was the truth, I had no\r\nknowledge of what were the duties of dean of guild; but after some\r\nfleeching from the other councillors, I consented to have the office, as\r\nit were, forced upon me; so I was made dean of guild, and Mr M'Lucre the\r\nnew bailie.\r\n\r\nBy and by, when the harvest in England was over, the parliament was\r\ndissolved, but no candidate started on my lord's interest, as was\r\nexpected by Mr M'Lucre, and he began to fret and be dissatisfied that he\r\nhad ever consented to allow himself to be hoodwinked out of the guildry.\r\nHowever, just three days before the election, and at the dead hour of the\r\nnight, the sound of chariot wheels and of horsemen was heard in our\r\nstreets; and this was Mr Galore, the great Indian nabob, that had bought\r\nthe Beerland estates, and built the grand place that is called Lucknoo\r\nHouse, coming from London, with the influence of the crown on his side,\r\nto oppose the old member.  He drove straight to Provost Picklan's house,\r\nhaving, as we afterwards found out, been in a secret correspondence with\r\nhim through the medium of Mrs Picklan, who was conjunct in the business\r\nwith Miss Nelly, the nabob's maiden sister.  Mr M'Lucre was not a little\r\nconfounded at this, for he had imagined that I was the agent on behalf of\r\nmy lord, who was of the government side, so he wist not what to do, in\r\nthe morning when he came to me, till I said to him briskly--\r\n\r\n\"Ye ken, bailie, that ye're trysted to me, and it's our duty to support\r\nthe nabob, who is both able and willing, as I have good reason to think,\r\nto requite our services in a very grateful manner.\"  This was a cordial\r\nto his spirit, and, without more ado, we both of us set to work to get\r\nthe bailie made the delegate.  In this I had nothing in view but the good\r\nof my country by pleasuring, as it was my duty, his majesty's government,\r\nfor I was satisfied with my situation as dean of guild.  But the handling\r\nrequired no small slight of skill.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was, to persuade those that were on the side of the old\r\nmember to elect Mr M'Lucre for delegate, he being, as we had concerted,\r\nopenly declared for that interest, and the benefit to be gotten thereby\r\nhaving, by use and wont, been at an established and regular rate.  The\r\nnext thing was to get some of those that were with me on my lord's side,\r\nkept out of the way on the day of choosing the delegate; for we were the\r\nstrongest, and could easily have returned the provost, but I had no clear\r\nnotion how it would advantage me to make the provost delegate, as was\r\nproposed.  I therefore, on the morning of the business, invited three of\r\nthe council to take their breakfast with me, for the ostensible purpose\r\nof going in a body to the council chamber to choose the provost delegate;\r\nbut when we were at breakfast, John Snakers, my lad in the shop, by my\r\nsuggestion, warily got a bale of broad cloth so tumbled, as it were by\r\naccident, at the door, that it could not be opened; for it bent the key\r\nin such a manner in the lock, and crooket the sneck, that without a smith\r\nthere was no egress, and sorrow a smith was to be had.  All were out and\r\naround the tolbooth waiting for the upshot of the choosing the delegate.\r\nThose that saw me in the mean time, would have thought I had gone\r\ndemented.  I ramped and I stamped; I banned and I bellowed like\r\ndesperation.  My companions, no a bit better, flew fluttering to the\r\nwindows, like wild birds to the wires of their cage.  However, to make a\r\nlong tale short, Bailie M'Lucre was, by means of this device, chosen\r\ndelegate, seemingly against my side.  But oh! he was a slee tod, for no\r\nsooner was he so chosen, than he began to act for his own behoof; and\r\nthat very afternoon, while both parties were holding their public dinner\r\nhe sent round the bell to tell that the potato crop on his back rig was\r\nto be sold by way of public roup the same day.  There wasna one in the\r\ntown that had reached the years of discretion, but kent what na sort of\r\npotatoes he was going to sell; and I was so disturbed by this open\r\ncorruption, that I went to him, and expressed my great surprise.  Hot\r\nwords ensued between us; and I told him very plainly that I would have\r\nnothing further to say to him or his political profligacy.  However, his\r\npotatoes were sold, and brought upwards of three guineas the peck, the\r\nnabob being the purchaser, who, to show his contentment with the bargain,\r\nmade Mrs M'Lucre, and the bailie's three daughters, presents of new gowns\r\nand princods, that were not stuffed with wool.\r\n\r\nIn the end, as a natural consequence, Bailie M'Lucre, as delegate, voted\r\nfor the Nabob, and the old member was thereby thrown out.  But although\r\nthe government candidate in this manner won the day, yet I was so\r\ndispleased by the jookerie of the bailie, and the selfish manner by which\r\nhe had himself reaped all the advantage of the election in the sale of\r\nhis potatoes, that we had no correspondence on public affairs till long\r\nafter; so that he never had the face to ask me to give up the guildry,\r\ntill I resigned it of my own accord after the renewal of the tacks to\r\nwhich I have alluded, by the which renewals, a great increase was\r\neffected in the income of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--THE FAILURE OF BAILIE M'LUCRE\r\n\r\n\r\nBailie M'Lucre, as I have already intimated, was naturally a greedy body,\r\nand not being content with the profits of his potatoe rig, soon after the\r\nelection he set up as an o'er-sea merchant, buying beef and corn by\r\nagency in Ireland, and having the same sent to the Glasgow market.  For\r\nsome time, this traffic yielded him a surprising advantage; but the\r\nsummer does not endure the whole year round, nor was his prosperity\r\nordained to be of a continuance.  One mishap befell him after another;\r\ncargoes of his corn heated in the vessels, because he would not sell at a\r\nlosing price, and so entirely perished; and merchants broke, that were in\r\nhis debt large sums for his beef and provisions.  In short, in the course\r\nof the third year from the time of the election, he was rookit of every\r\nplack he had in the world, and was obligated to take the benefit of the\r\ndivor's bill, soon after which he went suddenly away from the town, on\r\nthe pretence of going into Edinburgh, on some business of legality with\r\nhis wife's brother, with whom he had entered into a plea concerning the\r\nmoiety of a steading at the town-head.  But he did not stop on any such\r\nconcern there; on the contrary, he was off, and up to London in a trader\r\nfrom Leith, to try if he could get a post in the government by the aid of\r\nthe nabob, our member; who, by all accounts, was hand and glove with the\r\nking's ministers.  The upshot of this journey to London was very comical;\r\nand when the bailie afterwards came back, and him and me were again on\r\nterms of visitation, many a jocose night we spent over the story of the\r\nsame; for the bailie was a kittle hand at a bowl of toddy; and his\r\nadventure was so droll, especially in the way he was wont to rehearse the\r\nparticulars, that it cannot fail to be an edification to posterity, to\r\nread and hear how it happened, and all about it.  I may therefore take\r\nleave to digress into the circumstantials, by way of lightening for a\r\ntime the seriousness of the sober and important matter, whereof it is my\r\nintent that this book shall be a register and record to future times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--THE BRIBE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr M'Lucre, going to London, as I have intimated in the foregoing\r\nchapter, remained there, absent from us altogether about the space of six\r\nweeks; and when he came home, he was plainly an altered man, being\r\nsometimes very jocose, and at other times looking about him as if he had\r\nbeen haunted by some ill thing.  Moreover, Mrs Spell, that had the post-\r\noffice from the decease of her husband, Deacon Spell, told among her\r\nkimmers, that surely the bailie had a great correspondence with the king\r\nand government, for that scarce a week passed without a letter from him\r\nto our member, or a letter from the member to him.  This bred no small\r\nconsideration among us; and I was somehow a thought uneasy thereat, not\r\nknowing what the bailie, now that he was out of the guildry, might be\r\nsaying anent the use and wont that had been practised therein, and never\r\nmore than in his own time.  At length, the babe was born.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as I was sitting at home, after closing the shop for the\r\nnight, and conversing concerning the augmentation of our worldly affairs\r\nwith Mrs Pawkie and the bairns--it was a damp raw night; I mind it just\r\nas well as if it had been only yestreen--who should make his appearance\r\nat the room door but the bailie himself, and a blithe face he had?\r\n\r\n\"It's a' settled now,\" cried he, as he entered with a triumphant voice;\r\n\"the siller's my ain, and I can keep it in spite of them; I don't value\r\nthem now a cutty-spoon; no, not a doit; no the worth of that; nor a'\r\ntheir sprose about Newgate and the pillory;\"--and he snapped his fingers\r\nwith an aspect of great courage.\r\n\r\n\"Hooly, hooly, bailie,\" said I; \"what's a' this for?\" and then he\r\nreplied, taking his seat beside me at the fireside--\"The plea with the\r\ncustom-house folk at London is settled, or rather, there canna be a plea\r\nat a', so firm and true is the laws of England on my side, and the\r\nliberty of the subject.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was Greek and Hebrew to me; but it was plain that the bailie, in\r\nhis jaunt, had been guilty of some notour thing, wherein the custom-house\r\nwas concerned, and that he thought all the world was acquaint with the\r\nsame.  However, no to balk him in any communication he might be disposed\r\nto make me, I said:--\r\n\r\n\"What ye say, bailie, is great news, and I wish you meikle joy, for I\r\nhave had my fears about your situation for some time; but now that the\r\nbusiness is brought to such a happy end, I would like to hear all the\r\ntrue particulars of the case; and that your tale and tidings sha'na lack\r\nslackening, I'll get in the toddy bowl and the gardevin; and with that, I\r\nwinket to the mistress to take the bairns to their bed, and bade Jenny\r\nHachle, that was then our fee'd servant lass, to gar the kettle boil.\r\nPoor Jenny has long since fallen into a great decay of circumstances, for\r\nshe was not overly snod and cleanly in her service; and so, in time, wore\r\nout the endurance of all the houses and families that fee'd her, till\r\nnobody would take her; by which she was in a manner cast on Mrs Pawkie's\r\nhands; who, on account of her kindliness towards the bairns in their\r\nchildhood, has given her a howf among us.  But, to go on with what I was\r\nrehearsing; the toddy being ordered, and all things on the table, the\r\nbailie, when we were quiet by ourselves, began to say--\r\n\r\n\"Ye ken weel, Mr Pawkie, what I did at the 'lection for the member and\r\nhow angry ye were yoursel about it, and a' that.  But ye were greatly\r\nmista'en in thinking that I got ony effectual fee at the time, over and\r\nabove the honest price of my potatoes; which ye were as free to bid for,\r\nhad ye liket, as either o' the candidates.  I'll no deny, however, that\r\nthe nabob, before he left the town, made some small presents to my wife\r\nand dochter; but that was no fault o' mine.  Howsever, when a' was o'er,\r\nand I could discern that ye were mindet to keep the guildry, I thought,\r\nafter the wreck o' my provision concern, I might throw mair bread on the\r\nwater and not find it, than by a bit jaunt to London to see how my\r\nhonourable friend, the nabob, was coming on in his place in parliament,\r\nas I saw none of his speeches in the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ye see, Mr Pawkie, I gae'd up to London in a trader from Leith;\r\nand by the use of a gude Scotch tongue, the whilk was the main substance\r\no' a' the bairns' part o' gear that I inherited from my parents, I found\r\nout the nabob's dwelling, in the west end o' the town of London; and\r\nfinding out the nabob's dwelling, I went and rappit at the door, which a\r\nbardy flunkie opened, and speer't what I want it, as if I was a thing no\r\nfit to be lifted off a midden with a pair of iron tongs.  Like master,\r\nlike man, thought I to myself; and thereupon, taking heart no to be put\r\nout, I replied to the whipper-snapper--'I'm Bailie M'Lucre o' Gudetown,\r\nand maun hae a word wi' his honour.'\r\n\r\n\"The cur lowered his birsses at this, and replied, in a mair ceeveleezed\r\nstyle of language, 'Master is not at home.'  But I kent what not at home\r\nmeans in the morning at a gentleman's door in London; so I said, 'Very\r\nweel, as I hae had a long walk, I'll e'en rest myself and wait till he\r\ncome;' and with that, I plumpit down on one of the mahogany chairs in the\r\ntrance.  The lad, seeing that I was na to be jookit, upon this answered\r\nme, by saying, he would go and enquire if his master would be at home to\r\nme; and the short and the long o't was, that I got at last an audience o'\r\nmy honourable friend.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, bailie,' said he, 'I'm glad to see you in London,' and a hantle\r\no' ither courtly glammer that's no worth a repetition; and, from less to\r\nmair, we proceeded to sift into the matter and end of my coming to ask\r\nthe help o' his hand to get me a post in the government.  But I soon saw,\r\nthat wi a' the phraseology that lay at his tongue end during the\r\nelection, about his power and will to serve us, his ain turn ser't, he\r\ncared so little for me.  Howsever after tarrying some time, and going to\r\nhim every day, at long and last he got me a tide-waiter's place at the\r\ncustom-house; a poor hungry situation, no worth the grassum at a new tack\r\nof the warst land in the town's aught.  But minnows are better than nae\r\nfish, and a tide-waiter's place was a step towards a better, if I could\r\nhave waited.  Luckily, however, for me, a flock of fleets and ships frae\r\nthe East and West Indies came in a' thegither; and there was sic a stress\r\nfor tide-waiters, that before I was sworn in and tested, I was sent down\r\nto a grand ship in the Malabar trade frae China, loaded with tea and\r\nother rich commodities; the captain whereof, a discreet man, took me down\r\nto the cabin, and gave me a dram of wine, and, when we were by oursels,\r\nhe said to me--\r\n\r\n\"'Mr M'Lucre, what will you take to shut your eyes for an hour?'\r\n\r\n\"'I'll no take a hundred pounds,' was my answer.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll make it guineas,' quoth he.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, thought I, my eyne maun be worth pearls and diamonds to the East\r\nIndia Company; so I answered and said--\r\n\r\n\"'Captain, no to argol-bargol about the matter,' (for a' the time, I\r\nthought upon how I had not been sworn in;)--'what will ye gie me, if I\r\ntake away my eyne out of the vessel?'\r\n\r\n\"'A thousand pounds,' cried he.\r\n\r\n\"'A bargain be't,' said I.  I think, however, had I stood out I might hae\r\ngot mair.  But it doesna rain thousands of pounds every day; so, to make\r\na long tale short, I got a note of hand on the Bank of England for the\r\nsum, and, packing up my ends and my awls, left the ship.\r\n\r\n\"It was my intent to have come immediately home to Scotland; but the same\r\nafternoon, I was summoned by the Board at the Custom-house for deserting\r\nmy post; and the moment I went before them, they opened upon me like my\r\nlord's pack of hounds, and said they would send me to Newgate.  'Cry a'\r\nat ance,' quoth I; 'but I'll no gang.'  I then told them how I was na\r\nsworn, and under no obligation to serve or obey them mair than pleasured\r\nmysel'; which set them a' again a barking worse than before; whereupon,\r\nseeing no likelihood of an end to their stramash, I turned mysel' round,\r\nand, taking the door on my back, left them, and the same night came off\r\non the Fly to Edinburgh.  Since syne they have been trying every grip and\r\nwile o' the law to punish me as they threatened; but the laws of England\r\nare a great protection to the people against arbitrary power; and the\r\nletter that I have got to-day frae the nabob, tells me that the\r\ncommissioners hae abandoned the plea.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the account and narration that the bailie gave to me of the\r\nparticulars o' his journey to London; and when he was done, I could not\r\nbut make a moral reflection or two, on the policy of gentlemen putting\r\nthemselves on the leet to be members of Parliament; it being a clear and\r\nplain thing, that as they are sent up to London for the benefit of the\r\npeople by whom they are chosen, the people should always take care to get\r\nsome of that benefit in hand paid down, otherwise they run a great risk\r\nof seeing their representatives neglecting their special interests, and\r\ntreating them as entitled to no particular consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII--ON THE CHOOSING OF A MINISTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next great handling that we had in the council after the general\r\nelection, was anent the choice of a minister for the parish.  The Rev. Dr\r\nSwapkirk having had an apoplexy, the magistrates were obligated to get Mr\r\nPittle to be his helper.  Whether it was that, by our being used to Mr\r\nPittle, we had ceased to have a right respect for his parts and talents,\r\nor that in reality he was but a weak brother, I cannot in conscience take\r\nit on me to say; but the certainty is, that when the Doctor departed this\r\nlife, there was hardly one of the hearers who thought Mr Pittle would\r\never be their placed minister, and it was as far at first from the\r\nunanimous mind of the magistrates, who are the patrons of the parish, as\r\nany thing could well be, for he was a man of no smeddum in discourse.  In\r\nverity, as Mrs Pawkie, my wife, said, his sermons in the warm summer\r\nafternoons were just a perfect hushabaa, that no mortal could hearken to\r\nwithout sleeping.  Moreover, he had a sorning way with him, that the\r\ngenteeler sort could na abide, for he was for ever going from house to\r\nhouse about tea-time, to save his ain canister.  As for the young ladies,\r\nthey could na endure him at all, for he had aye the sough and sound of\r\nlove in his mouth, and a round-about ceremonial of joking concerning the\r\nsame, that was just a fasherie to them to hear.  The commonality,\r\nhowever, were his greatest adversaries; for he was, notwithstanding the\r\nspareness of his abilities, a prideful creature, taking no interest in\r\ntheir hamely affairs, and seldom visiting the aged or the sick among\r\nthem.  Shortly, however, before the death of the doctor, Mr Pittle had\r\nbeen very attentive to my wife's full cousin, Miss Lizy Pinkie, I'll no\r\nsay on account of the legacy of seven hundred pounds left her by an uncle\r\nthat made his money in foreign parts, and died at Portsmouth of the liver\r\ncomplaint, when he was coming home to enjoy himself; and Mrs Pawkie told\r\nme, that as soon as Mr Pittle could get a kirk, I needna be surprised if\r\nI heard o' a marriage between him and Miss Lizy.\r\n\r\nHad I been a sordid and interested man, this news could never have given\r\nme the satisfaction it did, for Miss Lizy was very fond of my bairns, and\r\nit was thought that Peter would have been her heir; but so far from being\r\nconcerned at what I heard, I rejoiced thereat, and resolved in secret\r\nthought, whenever a vacancy happened, Dr Swapkirk being then fast wearing\r\naway, to exert the best of my ability to get the kirk for Mr Pittle, not,\r\nhowever, unless he was previously married to Miss Lizy; for, to speak\r\nout, she was beginning to stand in need of a protector, and both me and\r\nMrs Pawkie had our fears that she might outlive her income, and in her\r\nold age become a cess upon us.  And it couldna be said that this was any\r\ngroundless fear; for Miss Lizy, living a lonely maiden life by herself,\r\nwith only a bit lassie to run her errands, and no being naturally of an\r\nactive or eydent turn, aften wearied, and to keep up her spirits gaed may\r\nbe, now and then, oftener to the gardevin than was just necessar, by\r\nwhich, as we thought, she had a tavert look.  Howsever, as Mr Pittle had\r\ntaken a notion of her, and she pleased his fancy, it was far from our\r\nhand to misliken one that was sib to us; on the contrary, it was a duty\r\nlaid on me by the ties of blood and relationship, to do all in my power\r\nto further their mutual affection into matrimonial fruition; and what I\r\ndid towards that end, is the burden of this current chapter.\r\n\r\nDr Swapkirk, in whom the spark of life was long fading, closed his eyes,\r\nand it went utterly out, as to this world, on a Saturday night, between\r\nthe hours of eleven and twelve.  We had that afternoon got an inkling\r\nthat he was drawing near to his end.  At the latest, Mrs Pawkie herself\r\nwent over to the manse, and stayed till she saw him die.  \"It was a\r\npleasant end,\" she said, for he was a godly, patient man; and we were\r\nboth sorely grieved, though it was a thing for which we had been long\r\nprepared; and indeed, to his family and connexions, except for the loss\r\nof the stipend, it was a very gentle dispensation, for he had been long a\r\nheavy handful, having been for years but, as it were, a breathing lump of\r\nmortality, groosy, and oozy, and doozy, his faculties being shut up and\r\nlocked in by a dumb palsy.\r\n\r\nHaving had this early intimation of the doctor's removal to a better\r\nworld, on the Sabbath morning when I went to join the magistrates in the\r\ncouncil-chamber, as the usage is to go to the laft, with the\r\ntown-officers carrying their halberts before us, according to the ancient\r\ncustom of all royal burghs, my mind was in a degree prepared to speak to\r\nthem anent the successor.  Little, however, passed at that time, and it\r\nso happened that, by some wonder of inspiration, (there were, however,\r\nfolk that said it was taken out of a book of sermons, by one Barrow an\r\nEnglish Divine,) Mr Pittle that forenoon preached a discourse that made\r\nan impression, in so much, that on our way back to the council-chamber I\r\nsaid to Provost Vintner, that then was--\r\n\r\n\"Really Mr Pittle seems, if he would exert himself, to have a nerve.  I\r\ncould not have thought it was in the power of his capacity to have given\r\nus such a sermon.\"\r\n\r\nThe provost thought as I did, so I replied--\"We canna, I think, do better\r\nthan keep him among us.  It would, indeed, provost, no be doing justice\r\nto the young man to pass another over his head.\"\r\n\r\nI could see that the provost wasna quite sure of what I had been saying;\r\nfor he replied, that it was a matter that needed consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen we separated at the council-chamber, I threw myself in the way of\r\nBailie Weezle, and walked home with him, our talk being on the subject of\r\nvacancy; and I rehearsed to him what had passed between me and the\r\nprovost, saying, that the provost had made no objection to prefer Mr\r\nPittle, which was the truth.\r\n\r\nBailie Weezle was a man no overladen with worldly wisdom, and had been\r\nchosen into the council principally on account of being easily managed.\r\nIn his business, he was originally by trade a baker in Glasgow, where he\r\nmade a little money, and came to settle among us with his wife, who was a\r\nnative of the town, and had her relations here.  Being therefore an idle\r\nman, living on his money, and of a soft and quiet nature, he was for the\r\nreason aforesaid chosen into the council, where he always voted on the\r\nprovost's side; for in controverted questions every one is beholden to\r\ntake a part, and he thought it was his duty to side with the chief\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nHaving convinced the bailie that Mr Pittle had already, as it were, a\r\nsort of infeoffment in the kirk, I called in the evening on my old\r\npredecessor in the guildry, Bailie M'Lucre, who was not a hand to be so\r\neasily dealt with; but I knew his inclinations, and therefore I resolved\r\nto go roundly to work with him.  So I asked him out to take a walk, and I\r\nled him towards the town-moor, conversing loosely about one thing and\r\nanother, and touching softly here and there on the vacancy.\r\n\r\nWhen we were well on into the middle of the moor, I stopped, and, looking\r\nround me, said, \"Bailie, surely it's a great neglec of the magistrates\r\nand council to let this braw broad piece of land, so near the town, lie\r\nin a state o' nature, and giving pasturage to only twa-three of the poor\r\nfolk's cows.  I wonder you, that's now a rich man, and with eyne worth\r\npearls and diamonds, that ye dinna think of asking a tack of this land;\r\nye might make a great thing o't.\"\r\n\r\nThe fish nibbled, and told me that he had for some time entertained a\r\nthought on the subject; but he was afraid that I would be overly\r\nextortionate.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder to hear you, bailie,\" said I; \"I trust and hope no one will\r\never find me out of the way of justice; and to convince you that I can do\r\na friendly turn, I'll no objec to gie you a' my influence free gratis, if\r\nye'll gie Mr Pittle a lift into the kirk; for, to be plain with you, the\r\nworthy young man, who, as ye heard to-day, is no without an ability, has\r\nlong been fond of Mrs Pawkie's cousin, Miss Lizy Pinky; and I would fain\r\ndo all that lies in my power to help on the match.\"\r\n\r\nThe bailie was well pleased with my frankness, and before returning home\r\nwe came to a satisfactory understanding; so that the next thing I had to\r\ndo, was to see Mr Pittle himself on the subject.  Accordingly, in the\r\ngloaming, I went over to where he stayed: it was with Miss Jenny\r\nKillfuddy, an elderly maiden lady, whose father was the minister of\r\nBraehill, and the same that is spoken of in the chronicle of Dalmailing,\r\nas having had his eye almost put out by a clash of glaur, at the stormy\r\nplacing of Mr Balwhidder.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Pittle,\" said I, as soon as I was in and the door closed.  \"I'm come\r\nto you as a friend; both Mrs Pawkie and me have long discerned that ye\r\nhave had a look more than common towards our friend, Miss Lizy, and we\r\nthink it our duty to enquire your intents, before matters gang to greater\r\nlength.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked a little dumfoundered at this salutation, and was at a loss for\r\nan answer, so I continued--\r\n\r\n\"If your designs be honourable, and no doubt they are, now's your time;\r\nstrike while the iron's hot.  By the death of the doctor, the kirk's\r\nvacant, the town-council have the patronage; and, if ye marry Miss Lizy,\r\nmy interest and influence shall not be slack in helping you into the\r\npoopit.\"  In short, out of what passed that night, on the Monday\r\nfollowing Mr Pittle and Miss Lizy were married; and by my dexterity,\r\ntogether with the able help I had in Bailie M'Lucre, he was in due season\r\nplaced and settled in the parish; and the next year more than fifty acres\r\nof the town-moor were inclosed on a nine hundred and ninety-nine years'\r\ntack at an easy rate between me and the bailie, he paying the half of the\r\nexpense of the ditching and rooting out of the whins; and it was\r\nacknowledged by every one that saw it, that there had not been a greater\r\nimprovement for many years in all the country side.  But to the best\r\nactions there will be adverse and discontented spirits; and, on this\r\noccasion, there were not wanting persons naturally of a disloyal\r\nopposition temper, who complained of the inclosure as a usurpation of the\r\nrights and property of the poorer burghers.  Such revilings, however, are\r\nwhat all persons in authority must suffer; and they had only the effect\r\nof making me button my coat, and look out the crooser to the blast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX--AN EXECUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attainment of honours and dignities is not enjoyed without a portion\r\nof trouble and care, which, like a shadow, follows all temporalities.  On\r\nthe very evening of the same day that I was first chosen to be a bailie,\r\na sore affair came to light, in the discovery that Jean Gaisling had\r\nmurdered her bastard bairn.  She was the daughter of a donsie mother,\r\nthat could gie no name to her gets, of which she had two laddies, besides\r\nJean.  The one of them had gone off with the soldiers some time before;\r\nthe other, a douce well-behaved callan, was in my lord's servitude, as a\r\nstable boy at the castle.  Jeanie herself was the bonniest lassie in the\r\nwhole town, but light-headed, and fonder of outgait and blether in the\r\ncausey than was discreet of one of her uncertain parentage.  She was, at\r\nthe time when she met with her misfortune, in the service of Mrs\r\nDalrymple, a colonel's widow, that came out of the army and settled among\r\nus on her jointure.\r\n\r\nThis Mrs Dalrymple, having been long used to the loose morals of camps\r\nand regiments, did not keep that strict hand over poor Jeanie, and her\r\nother serving lass, that she ought to have done, and so the poor\r\nguileless creature fell into the snare of some of the ne'er-do-weel\r\ngentlemen that used to play cards at night with Mrs Dalrymple.  The\r\ntruths of the story were never well known, nor who was the father, for\r\nthe tragical issue barred all enquiry; but it came out that poor Jeanie\r\nwas left to herself, and, being instigated by the Enemy, after she had\r\nbeen delivered, did, while the midwife's back was turned, strangle the\r\nbaby with a napkin.  She was discovered in the very fact, with the bairn\r\nblack in the face in the bed beside her.\r\n\r\nThe heinousness of the crime can by no possibility be lessened; but the\r\nbeauty of the mother, her tender years, and her light-headedness, had won\r\nmany favourers; and there was a great leaning in the hearts of all the\r\ntown to compassionate her, especially when they thought of the ill\r\nexample that had been set to her in the walk and conversation of her\r\nmother.  It was not, however, within the power of the magistrates to\r\noverlook the accusation; so we were obligated to cause a precognition to\r\nbe taken, and the search left no doubt of the wilfulness of the murder.\r\nJeanie was in consequence removed to the tolbooth, where she lay till the\r\nlords were coming to Ayr, when she was sent thither to stand her trial\r\nbefore them; but, from the hour she did the deed, she never spoke.\r\n\r\nHer trial was a short procedure, and she was cast to be hanged--and not\r\nonly to be hanged, but ordered to be executed in our town, and her body\r\ngiven to the doctors to make an atomy.  The execution of Jeanie was what\r\nall expected would happen; but when the news reached the town of the\r\nother parts of the sentence, the wail was as the sough of a pestilence,\r\nand fain would the council have got it dispensed with.  But the Lord\r\nAdvocate was just wud at the crime, both because there had been no\r\nprevious concealment, so as to have been an extenuation for the shame of\r\nthe birth, and because Jeanie would neither divulge the name of the\r\nfather, nor make answer to all the interrogatories that were put to\r\nher--standing at the bar like a dumbie, and looking round her, and at the\r\njudges, like a demented creature, and beautiful as a Flanders' baby.  It\r\nwas thought by many, that her advocate might have made great use of her\r\nvisible consternation, and pled that she was by herself; for in truth she\r\nhad every appearance of being so.  He was, however, a dure man, no doubt\r\nwell enough versed in the particulars and punctualities of the law for an\r\nordinary plea; but no of the right sort of knowledge and talent to take\r\nup the case of a forlorn lassie, misled by ill example and a winsome\r\nnature, and clothed in the allurement of loveliness, as the judge himself\r\nsaid to the jury.\r\n\r\nOn the night before the day of execution, she was brought over in a\r\nchaise from Ayr between two town-officers, and placed again in our hands,\r\nand still she never spoke.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the compassion that every one had for poor Jeanie,\r\nso she wasna committed to a common cell, but laid in the council-room,\r\nwhere the ladies of the town made up a comfortable bed for her, and some\r\nof them sat up all night and prayed for her; but her thoughts were gone,\r\nand she sat silent.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, by break of day, her wanton mother, that had been\r\ntrolloping in Glasgow, came to the tolbooth door, and made a dreadful\r\nwally-waeing, and the ladies were obligated, for the sake of peace, to\r\nbid her be let in.  But Jeanie noticed her not, still sitting with her\r\neyes cast down, waiting the coming on of the hour of her doom.  The\r\nwicked mother first tried to rouse her by weeping and distraction, and\r\nthen she took to upbraiding; but Jeanie seemed to heed her not, save only\r\nonce, and then she but looked at the misleart tinkler, and shook her\r\nhead.  I happened to come into the room at this time, and seeing all the\r\ncharitable ladies weeping around, and the randy mother talking to the\r\npoor lassie as loudly and vehement as if she had been both deaf and\r\nsullen, I commanded the officers, with a voice of authority, to remove\r\nthe mother, by which we had for a season peace, till the hour came.\r\n\r\nThere had not been an execution in the town in the memory of the oldest\r\nperson then living; the last that suffered was one of the martyrs in the\r\ntime of the persecution, so that we were not skilled in the business, and\r\nhad besides no hangman, but were necessitated to borrow the Ayr one.\r\nIndeed, I being the youngest bailie, was in terror that the obligation\r\nmight have fallen to me.\r\n\r\nA scaffold was erected at the Tron, just under the tolbooth windows, by\r\nThomas Gimblet, the master-of-work, who had a good penny of profit by the\r\njob, for he contracted with the town-council, and had the boards after\r\nthe business was done to the bargain; but Thomas was then deacon of the\r\nwrights, and himself a member of our body.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed, Jeanie, dressed in white, was led out by the town-\r\nofficers, and in the midst of the magistrates from among the ladies, with\r\nher hands tied behind her with a black riband.  At the first sight of her\r\nat the tolbooth stairhead, a universal sob rose from all the multitude,\r\nand the sternest e'e couldna refrain from shedding a tear.  We marched\r\nslowly down the stair, and on to the foot of the scaffold, where her\r\nyounger brother, Willy, that was stable-boy at my lord's, was standing by\r\nhimself, in an open ring made round him in the crowd; every one\r\ncompassionating the dejected laddie, for he was a fine youth, and of an\r\norderly spirit.\r\n\r\nAs his sister came towards the foot of the ladder, he ran towards her,\r\nand embraced her with a wail of sorrow that melted every heart, and made\r\nus all stop in the middle of our solemnity.  Jeanie looked at him, (for\r\nher hands were tied,) and a silent tear was seen to drop from her cheek.\r\nBut in the course of little more than a minute, all was quiet, and we\r\nproceeded to ascend the scaffold.  Willy, who had by this time dried his\r\neyes, went up with us, and when Mr Pittle had said the prayer, and sung\r\nthe psalm, in which the whole multitude joined, as it were with the\r\ncontrition of sorrow, the hangman stepped forward to put on the fatal\r\ncap, but Willy took it out of his hand, and placed it on his sister\r\nhimself, and then kneeling down, with his back towards her closing his\r\neyes and shutting his ears with his hands, he saw not nor heard when she\r\nwas launched into eternity.\r\n\r\nWhen the awful act was over, and the stir was for the magistrates to\r\nreturn, and the body to be cut down, poor Willy rose, and without looking\r\nround, went down the steps of the scaffold; the multitude made a lane for\r\nhim to pass, and he went on through them hiding his face, and gaed\r\nstraight out of the town.  As for the mother, we were obligated, in the\r\ncourse of the same year, to drum her out of the town, for stealing\r\nthirteen choppin bottles from William Gallon's, the vintner's, and\r\nselling them for whisky to Maggie Picken, that was tried at the same time\r\nfor the reset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--A RIOT\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing very material, after Jeanie Gaisling's affair, happened in the\r\ntown till the time of my first provostry, when an event arose with an\r\naspect of exceeding danger to the lives and properties of the whole town.\r\nI cannot indeed think of it at this day, though age has cooled me down in\r\nall concerns to a spirit of composure, without feeling the blood boil in\r\nmy veins; so greatly, in the matter alluded to, was the king's dignity\r\nand the rightful government, by law and magistracy, insulted in my\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nFrom time out of mind, it had been an ancient and commendable custom in\r\nthe burgh, to have, on the king's birth-day, a large bowl of punch made\r\nin the council-chamber, in order and to the end and effect of drinking\r\nhis majesty's health at the cross; and for pleasance to the commonality,\r\nthe magistrates were wont, on the same occasion, to allow a cart of coals\r\nfor a bonfire.  I do not now, at this distance of time, remember the\r\ncause how it came to pass, but come to pass it did, that the council\r\nresolved for time coming to refrain from giving the coals for the\r\nbonfire; and it so fell out that the first administration of this economy\r\nwas carried into effect during my provostry, and the wyte of it was laid\r\nat my door by the trades' lads, and others, that took on them the lead in\r\nhobleshows at the fairs, and such like public doings.  Now I come to the\r\nissue and particulars.\r\n\r\nThe birth-day, in progress of time, came round, and the morning was\r\nushered in with the ringing of bells, and the windows of the houses\r\nadorned with green boughs and garlands.  It was a fine bright day, and\r\nnothing could exceed the glee and joviality of all faces till the\r\nafternoon, when I went up to the council-chamber in the tolbooth, to meet\r\nthe other magistrates and respectable characters of the town, in order to\r\ndrink the king's health.  In going thither, I was joined, just as I was\r\nstepping out of my shop, by Mr Stoup, the excise gauger, and Mr Firlot,\r\nthe meal-monger, who had made a power of money a short time before, by a\r\ncargo of corn that he had brought from Belfast, the ports being then\r\nopen, for which he was envied by some, and by the common sort was\r\nconsidered and reviled as a wicked hard-hearted forestaller.  As for Mr\r\nStoup, although he was a very creditable man, he had the repute of being\r\noverly austere in his vocation, for which he was not liked over and above\r\nthe dislike that the commonality cherish against all of his calling; so\r\nthat it was not possible that any magistrate, such as I endeavoured to\r\nbe, adverse to ill-doers, and to vice and immorality of every kind, could\r\nhave met at such a time and juncture, a greater misfortune than those two\r\nmen, especially when it is considered, that the abolition of the bonfire\r\nwas regarded as a heinous trespass on the liberties and privileges of the\r\npeople.  However, having left the shop, and being joined, as I have\r\nnarrated, by Mr Stoup and Mr Firlot, we walked together at a sedate pace\r\ntowards the tolbooth, before which, and at the cross, a great assemblage\r\nof people were convened; trades' lads, weavers with coats out at the\r\nelbow, the callans of the school; in short, the utmost gathering and\r\ncongregation of the clan-jamphry, who the moment they saw me coming, set\r\nup a great shout and howl, crying like desperation, \"Provost, 'whar's the\r\nbonfire?  Hae ye sent the coals, provost, hame to yersel, or selt them,\r\nprovost, for meal to the forestaller?\" with other such misleart\r\nphraseology that was most contemptuous, bearing every symptom of the\r\nrebellion and insurrection that they were then meditating.  But I kept my\r\ntemper, and went into the council-chamber, where others of the\r\nrespectable inhabitants were met with the magistrates and town-council\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, provost?\" said several of them as I came in; \"are ye\r\nill; or what has fashed you?\"  But I only replied, that the mob without\r\nwas very unruly for being deprived of their bonfire.  Upon this, some of\r\nthose present proposed to gratify them, by ordering a cart of coals, as\r\nusual; but I set my face against this, saying, that it would look like\r\nintimidation were we now to comply, and that all veneration for law and\r\nauthority would be at an end by such weakness on the part of those\r\nentrusted with the exercise of power.  There the debate, for a season,\r\nended; and the punch being ready, the table was taken out of the council-\r\nchamber and carried to the cross, and placed there, and then the bowl and\r\nglasses--the magistrates following, and the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nSeeing us surrounded by the town-officers with their halberts, the\r\nmultitude made way, seemingly with their wonted civility, and, when his\r\nmajesty's health was drank, they shouted with us, seemingly, too, as\r\nloyally as ever; but that was a traitorous device to throw us off our\r\nguard, as, in the upshot, was manifested; for no sooner had we filled the\r\nglasses again, than some of the most audacious of the rioters began to\r\ninsult us, crying, \"The bonfire! the bonfire!--No fire, no bowl!--Gentle\r\nand semple should share and share alike.\"  In short, there was a moving\r\nbackwards and forwards, and a confusion among the mob, with snatches of\r\nhuzzas and laughter, that boded great mischief; and some of my friends\r\nnear me said to me no to be alarmed, which only alarmed me the more, as I\r\nthought they surely had heard something.  However, we drank our second\r\nglass without any actual molestation; but when we gave the three cheers,\r\nas the custom was, after the same, instead of being answered joyfully,\r\nthe mob set up a frightful yell, and, rolling like the waves of the sea,\r\ncame on us with such a shock, that the table, and punch-bowl, and\r\nglasses, were couped and broken.  Bailie Weezle, who was standing on the\r\nopposite side, got his shins so ruffled by the falling of the table, that\r\nhe was for many a day after confined to the house with two sore legs; and\r\nit was feared he would have been a lameter for life.\r\n\r\nThe dinging down of the table was the signal of the rebellious ring\r\nleaders for open war.  Immediately there was an outcry and a roaring,\r\nthat was a terrification to hear; and I know not how it was, but before\r\nwe kent where we were, I found myself with many of those who had been\r\ndrinking the king's health, once more in the council-chamber, where it\r\nwas proposed that we should read the riot act from the windows; and this\r\nawful duty, by the nature of my office as provost, it behoved me to\r\nperform.  Nor did I shrink from it; for by this time my corruption was\r\nraised, and I was determined not to let the royal authority be set at\r\nnought in my hands.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mr Keelivine, the town clerk, having searched out among his\r\nlaw books for the riot act, one of the windows of the council-chamber was\r\nopened, and the bell man having, with a loud voice, proclaimed the \"O\r\nyes!\" three times, I stepped forward with the book in my hands.  At the\r\nsight of me, the rioters, in the most audacious manner, set up a\r\nblasphemous laugh; but, instead of finding me daunted thereat, they were\r\nsurprised at my fortitude; and, when I began to read, they listened in\r\nsilence.  But this was a concerted stratagem; for the moment that I had\r\nended, a dead cat came whizzing through the air like a comet, and gave me\r\nsuch a clash in the face that I was knocked down to the floor, in the\r\nmiddle of the very council-chamber.  What ensued is neither to be told\r\nnor described; some were for beating the fire-drum; others were for\r\narming ourselves with what weapons were in the tolbooth; but I deemed it\r\nmore congenial to the nature of the catastrophe, to send off an express\r\nto Ayr for the regiment of soldiers that was quartered there--the roar of\r\nthe rioters without, being all the time like a raging flood.\r\n\r\nMajor Target, however, who had seen service in foreign wars, was among\r\nus, and he having tried in vain to get us to listen to him, went out of\r\nhis own accord to the rioters, and was received by them with three\r\ncheers.  He then spoke to them in an exhorting manner, and represented to\r\nthem the imprudence of their behaviour; upon which they gave him three\r\nother cheers, and immediately dispersed and went home.  The major was a\r\nvain body, and took great credit to himself, as I heard, for this; but,\r\nconsidering the temper of mind the mob was at one time in, it is quite\r\nevident that it was no so much the major's speech and exhortation that\r\nsent them off, as their dread and terror of the soldiers that I had sent\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nAll that night the magistrates, with other gentlemen of the town, sat in\r\nthe council-chamber, and sent out, from time to time, to see that every\r\nthing was quiet; and by this judicious proceeding, of which we drew up\r\nand transmitted a full account to the king and government in London, by\r\nwhom the whole of our conduct was highly applauded, peace was maintained\r\ntill the next day at noon, when a detachment, as it was called, of four\r\ncompanies came from the regiment in Ayr, and took upon them the\r\npreservation of order and regularity.  I may here notice, that this was\r\nthe first time any soldiers had been quartered in the town since the\r\nforty-five; and a woeful warning it was of the consequences that follow\r\nrebellion and treasonable practices; for, to the present day, we have\r\nalways had a portion of every regiment, sent to Ayr, quartered upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI--POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nJust about the end of my first provostry, I began to make a discovery.\r\nWhether it was that I was a little inordinately lifted up by reason of\r\nthe dignity, and did not comport myself with a sufficient condescension\r\nand conciliation of manner to the rest of the town-council, it would be\r\nhard to say.  I could, however, discern that a general ceremonious\r\ninsincerity was performed by the members towards me, especially on the\r\npart of those who were in league and conjunct with the town-clerk, who\r\ncomported himself, by reason of his knowledge of the law, as if he was in\r\nverity the true and effectual chief magistrate of the burgh; and the\r\neffect of this discovery, was a consideration and digesting within me how\r\nI should demean myself, so as to regain the vantage I had lost; taking\r\nlittle heed as to how the loss had come, whether from an ill-judged pride\r\nand pretending in myself, or from the natural spirit of envy, that\r\ndarkens the good-will of all mankind towards those who get sudden\r\npromotion, as it was commonly thought I had obtained, in being so soon\r\nexalted to the provostry.\r\n\r\nBefore the Michaelmas I was, in consequence of this deliberation and\r\ncounselling with my own mind, fully prepared to achieve a great stroke of\r\npolicy for the future government of the town.  I saw that it would not do\r\nfor me for a time to stand overly eminent forward, and that it was a\r\nbetter thing, in the world, to have power and influence, than to show the\r\npossession of either.  Accordingly, after casting about from one thing to\r\nanother, I bethought with myself, that it would be a great advantage if\r\nthe council could be worked with, so as to nominate and appoint My Lord\r\nthe next provost after me.  In the proposing of this, I could see there\r\nwould be no difficulty; but the hazard was, that his lordship might only\r\nbe made a tool of instrumentality to our shrewd and sly town-clerk, Mr\r\nKeelivine, while it was of great importance that I should keep the\r\nmanagement of my lord in my own hands.  In this strait, however, a thing\r\ncame to pass, which strongly confirms me in the opinion, that good-luck\r\nhas really a great deal to say with the prosperity of men.  The earl, who\r\nhad not for years been in the country, came down in the summer from\r\nLondon, and I, together with the other magistrates and council, received\r\nan invitation to dine with him at the castle.  We all of course went,\r\n\"with our best breeding,\" as the old proverb says, \"helped by our brawest\r\ncleeding;\" but I soon saw that it was only a _pro forma_ dinner, and that\r\nthere was nothing of cordiality in all the civility with which we were\r\ntreated, both by my lord and my lady.  Nor, indeed, could I, on an\r\nafterthought, blame our noble entertainers for being so on their guard;\r\nfor in truth some of the deacons, (I'll no say any of the bailies,) were\r\nso transported out of themselves with the glory of my lord's banquet, and\r\nthe thought of dining at the castle, and at the first table too, that\r\nwhen the wine began to fiz in their noddles, they forgot themselves\r\nentirely, and made no more of the earl than if he had been one of\r\nthemselves.  Seeing to what issue the matter was tending, I set a guard\r\nupon myself; and while my lord, out of a parly-voo politess, was egging\r\nthem on, one after another, to drink deeper and deeper of his old wines,\r\nto the manifest detriment of their own senses, I kept myself in a degree\r\nas sober as a judge, warily noting all things that came to pass.\r\n\r\nThe earl had really a commendable share of common sense for a lord, and\r\nthe discretion of my conduct was not unnoticed by him; in so much, that\r\nafter the major part of the council had become, as it may be said, out o'\r\nthe body, cracking their jokes with one another, just as if all present\r\nhad been carousing at the Cross-Keys, his lordship wised to me to come\r\nand sit beside him, where we had a very private and satisfactory\r\nconversation together; in the which conversation, I said, that it was a\r\npity he would not allow himself to be nominated our provost.  Nobody had\r\never minted to him a thought of the thing before; so it was no wonder\r\nthat his lordship replied, with a look of surprise, saying, \"That so far\r\nfrom refusing, he had never heard of any such proposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very extraordinary, my lord,\" said I; \"for surely it is for your\r\ninterests, and would to a certainty be a great advantage to the town,\r\nwere your lordship to take upon you the nominal office of provost; I say\r\nnominal, my lord, because being now used to the duties, and somewhat\r\nexperienced therein, I could take all the necessary part of the trouble\r\noff your lordship's hands, and so render the provostry in your lordship's\r\nname a perfect nonentity.\"  Whereupon, he was pleased to say, if I would\r\ndo so, and he commended my talents and prudence, he would have no\r\nobjection to be made the provost at the ensuing election.  Something more\r\nexplicit might have ensued at that time; but Bailie M'Lucre and Mr\r\nSharpset, who was the dean of guild, had been for about the space of half\r\nan hour carrying on a vehement argument anent some concern of the\r\nguildry, in which, coming to high words, and both being beguiled and\r\nripened into folly by the earl's wine, they came into such a manifest\r\nquarrel, that Mr Sharpset pulled off the bailie's best wig, and flung it\r\nwith a damn into the fire: the which stramash caused my lord to end the\r\nsederunt; but none of the magistrates, save myself, was in a condition to\r\ngo with his lordship to My Lady in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--THE SPY\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the foregoing transaction, a thing happened that, in a manner,\r\nI would fain conceal and suppress from the knowledge of future times,\r\nalthough it was but a sort of sprose to make the world laugh.  Fortunately\r\nfor my character, however, it did not fall out exactly in my hands,\r\nalthough it happened in the course of my provostry.  The matter spoken\r\nof, was the affair of a Frenchman who was taken up as a spy; for the\r\nAmerican war was then raging, and the French had taken the part of the\r\nYankee rebels.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the month of August it was, I had gone on some private\r\nconcernment of my own to Kilmarnock, and Mr Booble, who was then oldest\r\nBailie, naturally officiated as chief magistrate in my stead.\r\n\r\nThere have been, as the world knows, a disposition on the part of the\r\ngrand monarque of that time, to invade and conquer this country, the\r\nwhich made it a duty incumbent on all magistrates to keep a vigilant eye\r\non the in-comings and out-goings of aliens and other suspectable persons.\r\nOn the said day, and during my absence, a Frenchman, that could speak no\r\nmanner of English, somehow was discovered in the Cross-Key inns.  What he\r\nwas, or where he came from, nobody at the time could tell, as I was\r\ninformed; but there he was, having come into the house at the door, with\r\na bundle in his hand, and a portmanty on his shoulder, like a traveller\r\nout of some vehicle of conveyance.  Mrs Drammer, the landlady, did not\r\nlike his looks; for he had toozy black whiskers, was lank and wan, and\r\nmoreover deformed beyond human nature, as she said, with a parrot nose,\r\nand had no cravat, but only a bit black riband drawn through two button-\r\nholes, fastening his ill-coloured sark neck, which gave him altogether\r\nsomething of an unwholesome, outlandish appearance.\r\n\r\nFinding he was a foreigner, and understanding that strict injunctions\r\nwere laid on the magistrates by the king and government anent the\r\negressing of such persons, she thought, for the credit of her house, and\r\nthe safety of the community at large, that it behoved her to send word to\r\nme, then provost, of this man's visibility among us; but as I was not at\r\nhome, Mrs Pawkie, my wife, directed the messenger to Bailie Booble's.  The\r\nbailie was, at all times, overly ready to claught at an alarm; and when\r\nhe heard the news, he went straight to the council-room, and sending for\r\nthe rest of the council, ordered the alien enemy, as he called the\r\nforlorn Frenchman, to be brought before him.  By this time, the suspicion\r\nof a spy in the town had spread far and wide; and Mrs Pawkie told me,\r\nthat there was a palid consternation in every countenance when the black\r\nand yellow man--for he had not the looks of the honest folks of this\r\ncountry--was brought up the street between two of the town-officers, to\r\nstand an examine before Bailie Booble.\r\n\r\nNeither the bailie, nor those that were then sitting with him, could\r\nspeak any French language, and \"the alien enemy\" was as little master of\r\nour tongue.  I have often wondered how the bailie did not jealouse that\r\nhe could be no spy, seeing how, in that respect, he wanted the main\r\nfaculty.   But he was under the enchantment of a panic, partly thinking\r\nalso, perhaps, that he was to do a great exploit for the government in my\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nHowever, the man was brought before him, and there was he, and them all,\r\nspeaking loud out to one another as if they had been hard of hearing,\r\nwhen I, on my coming home from Kilmarnock, went to see what was going on\r\nin the council.  Considering that the procedure had been in handsome time\r\nbefore my arrival, I thought it judicious to leave the whole business\r\nwith those present, and to sit still as a spectator; and really it was\r\nvery comical to observe how the bailie was driven to his wit's-end by the\r\npoor lean and yellow Frenchman, and in what a pucker of passion the\r\npannel put himself at every new interlocutor, none of which he could\r\nunderstand.  At last, the bailie, getting no satisfaction--how could\r\nhe?--he directed the man's portmanty and bundle to be opened; and in the\r\nbottom of the forementioned package, there, to be sure, was found many a\r\nmystical and suspicious paper, which no one could read; among others,\r\nthere was a strange map, as it then seemed to all present.\r\n\r\n\"I' gude faith,\" cried the bailie, with a keckle of exultation, \"here's\r\nproof enough now.  This is a plain map o' the Frith o' Clyde, all the way\r\nto the tail of the bank o' Greenock.  This muckle place is Arran; that\r\nround ane is the craig of Ailsa; the wee ane between is Plada.  Gentlemen,\r\ngentlemen, this is a sore discovery; there will be hanging and quartering\r\non this.\"  So he ordered the man to be forthwith committed as a king's\r\nprisoner to the tolbooth; and turning to me, said:--\"My lord provost, as\r\nye have not been present throughout the whole of this troublesome affair,\r\nI'll e'en gie an account mysel to the lord advocate of what we have\r\ndone.\"  I thought, at the time, there was something fey and overly\r\nforward in this, but I assented; for I know not what it was, that seemed\r\nto me as if there was something neither right nor regular; indeed, to say\r\nthe truth, I was no ill pleased that the bailie took on him what he did;\r\nso I allowed him to write himself to the lord advocate; and, as the\r\nsequel showed, it was a blessed prudence on my part that I did so.  For\r\nno sooner did his lordship receive the bailie's terrifying letter, than a\r\nspecial king's messenger was sent to take the spy into Edinburgh Castle;\r\nand nothing could surpass the great importance that Bailie Booble made of\r\nhimself, on the occasion, on getting the man into a coach, and two\r\ndragoons to guard him into Glasgow.\r\n\r\nBut oh! what a dejected man was the miserable Bailie Booble, and what a\r\nlaugh rose from shop and chamber, when the tidings came out from\r\nEdinburgh that, \"the alien enemy\" was but a French cook coming over from\r\nDublin, with the intent to take up the trade of a confectioner in\r\nGlasgow, and that the map of the Clyde was nothing but a plan for the\r\noutset of a fashionable table--the bailie's island of Arran being the\r\nroast beef, and the craig of Ailsa the plum-pudding, and Plada a butter-\r\nboat.  Nobody enjoyed the jocularity of the business more than myself;\r\nbut I trembled when I thought of the escape that my honour and character\r\nhad with the lord advocate.  I trow, Bailie Booble never set himself so\r\nforward from that day to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII--THE MEAL MOB\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the American war, I had, for various reasons of a\r\nprivate nature, a wish to sequestrate myself for a time, from any very\r\nostensible part in public affairs.  Still, however, desiring to retain a\r\nmean of resuming my station, and of maintaining my influence in the\r\ncouncil, I bespoke Mr Keg to act in my place as deputy for My Lord, who\r\nwas regularly every year at this time chosen into the provostry.\r\n\r\nThis Mr Keg was a man who had made a competency by the Isle-of-Man trade,\r\nand had come in from the laighlands, where he had been apparently in the\r\nfarming line, to live among us; but for many a day, on account of\r\nsomething that happened when he was concerned in the smuggling, he kept\r\nhimself cannily aloof from all sort of town matters; deporting himself\r\nwith a most creditable sobriety; in so much, that there was at one time a\r\nsough that Mr Pittle, the minister, our friend, had put him on the leet\r\nfor an elder.  That post, however, if it was offered to him, he certainly\r\nnever accepted; but I jealouse that he took the rumour o't for a sign\r\nthat his character had ripened into an estimation among us, for he\r\nthenceforth began to kithe more in public, and was just a patron to every\r\nmanifestation of loyalty, putting more lights in his windows in the\r\nrejoicing nights of victory than any other body, Mr M'Creesh, the\r\ncandlemaker, and Collector Cocket, not excepted.  Thus, in the fulness of\r\ntime, he was taken into the council, and no man in the whole corporation\r\ncould be said to be more zealous than he was.  In respect, therefore, to\r\nhim, I had nothing to fear, so far as the interests, and, over and above\r\nall, the loyalty of the corporation, were concerned; but something like a\r\nquailing came over my heart, when, after the breaking up of the council\r\non the day of election, he seemed to shy away from me, who had been\r\ninstrumental to his advancement.  However, I trow he had soon reason to\r\nrepent of that ingratitude, as I may well call it; for when the troubles\r\nof the meal mob came upon him, I showed him that I could keep my distance\r\nas well as my neighbours.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Friday, our market-day, that the hobleshow began, and in\r\nthe afternoon, when the farmers who had brought in their victual for sale\r\nwere loading their carts to take it home again, the price not having come\r\nup to their expectation.  All the forenoon, as the wives that went to the\r\nmeal-market, came back railing with toom pocks and basins, it might have\r\nbeen foretold that the farmers would have to abate their extortion, or\r\nthat something would come o't before night.  My new house and shop being\r\nforenent the market, I had noted this, and said to Mrs Pawkie, my wife,\r\nwhat I thought would be the upshot, especially when, towards the\r\nafternoon, I observed the commonality gathering in the market-place, and\r\nno sparing in their tongues to the farmers; so, upon her advice, I\r\ndirected Thomas Snakers to put on the shutters.\r\n\r\nSome of the farmers were loading their carts to go home, when the schools\r\nskailed, and all the weans came shouting to the market.  Still nothing\r\nhappened, till tinkler Jean, a randy that had been with the army at the\r\nsiege of Gibraltar, and, for aught I ken, in the Americas, if no in the\r\nIndies likewise;--she came with her meal-basin in her hand, swearing,\r\nlike a trooper, that if she didna get it filled with meal at\r\nfifteen-pence a peck, (the farmers demanded sixteen), she would have the\r\nfu' o't of their heart's blood; and the mob of thoughtless weans and idle\r\nfellows, with shouts and yells, encouraged Jean, and egged her on to a\r\ncatastrophe.  The corruption of the farmers was thus raised, and a young\r\nrash lad, the son of James Dyke o' the Mount, whom Jean was blackguarding\r\nat a dreadful rate, and upbraiding on account of some ploy he had had\r\nwith the Dalmailing session anent a bairn, in an unguarded moment lifted\r\nhis hand, and shook his neive in Jean's face, and even, as she said,\r\nstruck her.  He himself swore an affidavit that he gave her only a ding\r\nout of his way; but be this as it may, at him rushed Jean with open\r\nmouth, and broke her timbermeal-basin on his head, as it had been an egg-\r\nshell.  Heaven only knows what next ensued; but in a jiffy the whole\r\nmarket-place was as white with scattered meal as if it had been covered\r\nwith snow, and the farmers were seen flying helter skelter out at the\r\ntownhead, pursued by the mob, in a hail and whirlwind of stones and\r\nglaur.  Then the drums were heard beating to arms, and the soldiers were\r\nseen flying to their rendezvous.  I stood composedly at the dining-room\r\nwindow, and was very thankful that I wasna provost in such a hurricane,\r\nwhen I saw poor Mr Keg, as pale as a dish clout, running to and fro\r\nbareheaded, with the town-officers and their halberts at his heels,\r\nexhorting and crying till he was as hoarse as a crow, to the angry\r\nmultitude, that was raging and tossing like a sea in the market-place.\r\nThen it was that he felt the consequence of his pridefulness towards me;\r\nfor, observing me standing in serenity at the window, he came, and in a\r\nvehement manner cried to me for the love of heaven to come to his\r\nassistance, and pacify the people.  It would not have been proper in me\r\nto have refused; so out I went in the very nick of time: for when I got\r\nto the door, there was the soldiers in battle array, coming marching with\r\nfife and drum up the gait with Major Blaze at their head, red and furious\r\nin the face, and bent on some bloody business.  The first thing I did was\r\nto run to the major, just as he was facing the men for a \"charge\r\nbagonets\" on the people, crying to him to halt; for the riot act wasna\r\nyet read, and the murder of all that might be slain would lie at his\r\ndoor; at which to hear he stood aghast, and the men halted.  Then I flew\r\nback to the provost, and I cried to him, \"Read the riot act!\" which some\r\nof the mob hearing, became terrified thereat, none knowing the penalties\r\nor consequences thereof, when backed by soldiers; and in a moment, as if\r\nthey had seen the glimpse of a terrible spirit in the air, the whole\r\nmultitude dropped the dirt and stones out of their hands, and, turning\r\ntheir backs, flew into doors and closes, and were skailed before we knew\r\nwhere we were.  It is not to be told the laud and admiration that I got\r\nfor my ability in this business; for the major was so well pleased to\r\nhave been saved from a battle, that, at my suggestion, he wrote an\r\naccount of the whole business to the commander-in-chief, assuring him\r\nthat, but for me, and my great weight and authority in the town, nobody\r\ncould tell what the issue might have been; so that the Lord Advocate, to\r\nwhom the report was shown by the general, wrote me a letter of thanks in\r\nthe name of the government; and I, although not provost, was thus seen\r\nand believed to be a person of the foremost note and consideration in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nBut although the mob was dispersed, as I have related, the consequences\r\ndid not end there; for, the week following, none of the farmers brought\r\nin their victual; and there was a great lamentation and moaning in the\r\nmarket-place when, on the Friday, not a single cart from the country was\r\nto be seen, but only Simon Laidlaw's, with his timber caps and luggies;\r\nand the talk was, that meal would be half-a-crown the peck.  The grief,\r\nhowever, of the business wasna visible till the Saturday--the wonted day\r\nfor the poor to seek their meat--when the swarm of beggars that came\r\nforth was a sight truly calamitous.  Many a decent auld woman that had\r\npatiently eiked out the slender thread of a weary life with her wheel, in\r\nprivacy, her scant and want known only to her Maker, was seen going from\r\ndoor to door with the salt tear in her e'e, and looking in the face of\r\nthe pitiful, being as yet unacquainted with the language of beggary; but\r\nthe worst sight of all was two bonny bairns, dressed in their best, of a\r\ngenteel demeanour, going from house to house like the hungry babes in the\r\nwood: nobody kent who they were, nor whar they came from; but as I was\r\nseeing them served myself at our door, I spoke to them, and they told me\r\nthat their mother was lying sick and ill at home.  They were the orphans\r\nof a broken merchant from Glasgow, and, with their mother, had come out\r\nto our town the week before, without knowing where else to seek their\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nMrs Pawkie, who was a tender-hearted mother herself, took in the bairns\r\non hearing this, and we made of them, and the same night, among our\r\nacquaintance, we got a small sum raised to assist their mother, who\r\nproved a very well-bred and respectable lady-like creature.  When she got\r\nbetter, she was persuaded to take up a school, which she kept for some\r\nyears, with credit to herself and benefit to the community, till she got\r\na legacy left her by a brother that died in India, the which, being some\r\nthousands, caused her to remove into Edinburgh, for the better education\r\nof her own children; and its seldom that legacies are so well bestowed,\r\nfor she never forgot Mrs Pawkie's kindness, and out of the fore-end of\r\nher wealth she sent her a very handsome present.  Divers matters of\r\nelegance have come to us from her, year by year, since syne, and\r\nregularly on the anniversary day of that sore Saturday, as the Saturday\r\nfollowing the meal mob was ever after called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV--THE SECOND PROVOSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had occasion to observe in the course of my experience, that there\r\nis not a greater mollifier of the temper and nature of man than a\r\nconstant flowing in of success and prosperity.  From the time that I had\r\nbeen dean of guild, I was sensible of a considerable increase of my\r\nworldly means and substance; and although Bailie M'Lucre played me a\r\nsoople trick at the election, by the inordinate sale and roup of his\r\npotatoe-rig, the which tried me, as I do confess, and nettled me with\r\ndisappointment; yet things, in other respects, went so well with me that,\r\nabout the eighty-eight, I began to put forth my hand again into public\r\naffairs, endowed both with more vigour and activity than it was in the\r\nfirst period of my magisterial functions.  Indeed, it may be here proper\r\nfor me to narrate, that my retiring into the background during the last\r\ntwo or three years, was a thing, as I have said, done on mature\r\ndeliberation; partly, in order that the weight of my talents might be\r\nrightly estimated; and partly, that men might, of their own reflections,\r\ncome to a proper understanding concerning them.  I did not secede from\r\nthe council.  Could I have done that with propriety, I would assuredly\r\nnot have scrupled to make the sacrifice; but I knew well that, if I was\r\nto resign, it would not be easy afterwards to get myself again chosen in.\r\nIn a word, I was persuaded that I had, at times, carried things a little\r\ntoo highly, and that I had the adversary of a rebellious feeling in the\r\nminds and hearts of the corporation against me.  However, what I did,\r\nanswered the end and purpose I had in view; folk began to wonder and\r\nthink with themselves, what for Mr Pawkie had ceased to bestir himself in\r\npublic affairs; and the magistrates and council having, on two or three\r\noccasions, done very unsatisfactory things, it was said by one, and\r\nechoed by another, till the whole town was persuaded of the fact, that,\r\nhad I lent my shoulder to the wheel, things would not have been as they\r\nwere.  But the matter which did the most service to me at this time, was\r\na rank piece of idolatry towards my lord, on the part of Bailie M'Lucre,\r\nwho had again got himself most sickerly installed in the guildry.  Sundry\r\ntacks came to an end in this year of eighty-eight; and among others, the\r\nNiggerbrae park, which, lying at a commodious distance from the town,\r\nmight have been relet with a rise and advantage.  But what did the dean\r\nof guild do?  He, in some secret and clandestine manner, gave a hint to\r\nmy lord's factor to make an offer for the park on a two nineteen years'\r\nlease, at the rent then going--the which was done in my lord's name, his\r\nlordship being then provost.  The Niggerbrae was accordingly let to him,\r\nat the same rent which the town received for it in the sixty-nine.\r\nNothing could be more manifest than that there was some jookerie cookerie\r\nin this affair; but in what manner it was done, or how the dean of\r\nguild's benefit was to ensue, no one could tell, and few were able to\r\nconjecture; for my lord was sorely straitened for money, and had nothing\r\nto spare out of hand.  However, towards the end of the year, a light\r\nbroke in upon us.\r\n\r\nGabriel M'Lucre, the dean of guild's fifth son, a fine spirited laddie,\r\nsomehow got suddenly a cadetcy to go to India; and there were\r\nuncharitably-minded persons, who said, that this was the payment for the\r\nNiggerbrae job to my lord.  The outcry, in consequence, both against the\r\ndean of guild, and especially against the magistrates and council for\r\nconsenting thereto, was so extraordinary, and I was so openly upbraided\r\nfor being so long lukewarm, that I was, in a manner, forced again forward\r\nto take a prominent part; but I took good care to let it be well known,\r\nthat, in resuming my public faculties, I was resolved to take my own way,\r\nand to introduce a new method and reformation into all our concerns.\r\nAccordingly, at the Michaelmas following, that is, in the eighty-nine, I\r\nwas a second time chosen to the provostry, with an understanding, that I\r\nwas to be upheld in the office and dignity for two years; and that sundry\r\nimprovements, which I thought the town was susceptible of, both in the\r\ncausey of the streets and the reparation of the kirk, should be set about\r\nunder my direction; but the way in which I handled the same, and brought\r\nthem to a satisfactory completeness and perfection, will supply abundant\r\nmatter for two chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV--ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE STREETS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, Gudetown had been fortified with ports and gates at the\r\nend of the streets; and in troublesome occasions, the country people, as\r\nthe traditions relate, were in the practice of driving in their families\r\nand cattle for shelter.  This gave occasion to that great width in our\r\nstreets, and those of other royal burghs, which is so remarkable; the\r\nsame being so built to give room and stance for the cattle.  But in those\r\ndays the streets were not paved at the sides, but only in the middle, or,\r\nas it was called, the crown of the causey; which was raised and backed\r\nupward, to let the rain-water run off into the gutters.  In progress of\r\ntime, however, as the land and kingdom gradually settled down into an\r\norderly state, the farmers and country folk having no cause to drive in\r\ntheir herds and flocks, as in the primitive ages of a rampageous\r\nantiquity, the proprietors of houses in the town, at their own cost,\r\nbegan, one after another, to pave the spaces of ground between their\r\nsteadings and the crown of the causey; the which spaces were called\r\nlones, and the lones being considered as private property, the\r\ncorporation had only regard to the middle portion of the street--that\r\nwhich I have said was named the crown of the causey.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this separation of interests in a common good began to\r\nmanifest itself, when the pavement of the crown of the causey, by\r\nneglect, became rough and dangerous to loaded carts and gentlemen's\r\ncarriages passing through the town; in so much that, for some time prior\r\nto my second provostry, the carts and carriages made no hesitation of\r\ngoing over the lones, instead of keeping the highway in the middle of the\r\nstreet; at which many of the burgesses made loud and just complaints.\r\n\r\nOne dark night, the very first Sunday after my restoration to the\r\nprovostry, there was like to have happened a very sore thing by an old\r\nwoman, one Peggy Waife, who had been out with her gown-tail over her head\r\nfor a choppin of strong ale.  As she was coming home, with her ale in a\r\ngreybeard in her hand, a chaise in full bir came upon her and knocked her\r\ndown, and broke the greybeard and spilt the liquor.  The cry was\r\nterrible; some thought poor Peggy was killed outright, and wives, with\r\ncandles in their hands, started out at the doors and windows.  Peggy,\r\nhowever, was more terrified than damaged; but the gentry that were in the\r\nchaise, being termagant English travellers, swore like dragoons that the\r\nstreets should be indicted as a nuisance; and when they put up at the\r\ninns, two of them came to me, as provost, to remonstrate on the shameful\r\ncondition of the pavement, and to lodge in my hands the sum of ten pounds\r\nfor the behoof of Peggy; the which was greater riches than ever the poor\r\ncreature thought to attain in this world.  Seeing they were gentlemen of\r\na right quality, I did what I could to pacify them, by joining in every\r\nthing they said in condemnation of the streets; telling them, at the same\r\ntime, that the improvement of the causey was to be the very first object\r\nand care of my provostry.  And I bade Mrs Pawkie bring in the wine\r\ndecanters, and requested them to sit down with me and take a glass of\r\nwine and a sugar biscuit; the civility of which, on my part, soon brought\r\nthem into a peaceable way of thinking, and they went away, highly\r\ncommanding my politess and hospitality, of which they spoke in the\r\nwarmest terms, to their companion when they returned to the inns, as the\r\nwaiter who attended them overheard, and told the landlord, who informed\r\nme and others of the same in the morning.  So that on the Saturday\r\nfollowing, when the town-council met, there was no difficulty in getting\r\na minute entered at the sederunt, that the crown of the causey should be\r\nforthwith put in a state of reparation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus gotten the thing determined upon, I then proposed that we\r\nshould have the work done by contract, and that notice should be given\r\npublicly of such being our intent.  Some boggling was made to this\r\nproposal, it never having been the use and wont of the corporation, in\r\ntime past, to do any thing by contract, but just to put whatever was\r\nrequired into the hands of one of the council, who got the work done in\r\nthe best way he could; by which loose manner of administration great\r\nabuses were often allowed to pass unreproved.  But I persisted in my\r\nresolution to have the causey renewed by contract; and all the\r\ninhabitants of the town gave me credit for introducing such a great\r\nreformation into the management of public affairs.\r\n\r\nWhen it was made known that we would receive offers to contract, divers\r\npersons came forward; and I was a little at a loss, when I saw such\r\ncompetition, as to which ought to be preferred.  At last, I bethought me,\r\nto send for the different competitors, and converse with them on the\r\nsubject quietly; and I found in Thomas Shovel, the tacksman of Whinstone-\r\nquarry, a discreet and considerate man.  His offer was, it is true, not\r\nso low as some of the others; but he had facilities to do the work\r\nquickly, that none of the rest could pretend to; so, upon a clear\r\nunderstanding of that, with the help of the dean of guild M'Lucre's\r\nadvocacy, Thomas Shovel got the contract.  At first, I could not divine\r\nwhat interest my old friend, the dean of guild, had to be so earnest in\r\nbehalf of the offering contractor; in course of time, however, it spunkit\r\nout that he was a sleeping partner in the business, by which he made a\r\npower of profit.  But saving two three carts of stones to big a dyke\r\nround the new steading which I had bought a short time before at the town-\r\nend, I had no benefit whatever.  Indeed, I may take it upon me to say,\r\nthat should not say it, few provosts, in so great a concern, could have\r\nacted more on a principle than I did in this; and if Thomas Shovel, of\r\nhis free-will, did, at the instigation of the dean of guild, lay down the\r\nstones on my ground as aforesaid, the town was not wronged; for, no\r\ndoubt, he paid me the compliment at some expense of his own profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI--ABOUT THE REPAIR OF THE KIRK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe repair of the kirk, the next job I took in hand, was not so easily\r\nmanaged as that of the causey; for it seems, in former times, the whole\r\nspace of the area had been free to the parish in general, and that the\r\nlofts were constructions, raised at the special expense of the heritors\r\nfor themselves.  The fronts being for their families, and the back seats\r\nfor their servants and tenants.  In those times there were no such things\r\nas pews; but only forms, removeable, as I have heard say, at pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt, however, happened, in the course of nature, that certain forms came\r\nto be sabbathly frequented by the same persons; who, in this manner,\r\nacquired a sort of prescriptive right to them.  And those persons or\r\nfamilies, one after another, finding it would be an ease and convenience\r\nto them during divine worship, put up backs to their forms.  But still,\r\nfor many a year, there was no inclosure of pews; the first, indeed, that\r\nmade a pew, as I have been told, was one Archibald Rafter, a wright, and\r\nthe grandfather of Mr Rafter, the architect, who has had so much to do\r\nwith the edification of the new town of Edinburgh.  This Archibald's form\r\nhappened to be near the door, on the left side of the pulpit; and in the\r\nwinter, when the wind was in the north, it was a very cold seat, which\r\ninduced him to inclose it round and round, with certain old doors and\r\nshutters, which he had acquired in taking down and rebuilding the left\r\nwing of the whinny hill house.  The comfort in which this enabled him and\r\nhis family to listen to the worship, had an immediate effect; and the\r\nexample being of a taking nature, in the course of little more than\r\ntwenty years from the time, the whole area of the kirk had been pewed in\r\na very creditable manner.\r\n\r\nFamilies thus getting, as it were, portions of the church, some, when\r\nremoving from the town, gave them up to their neighbours on receiving a\r\nconsideration for the expense they had been at in making the pews; so\r\nthat, from less to more, the pews so formed became a lettable and a\r\nvendible property.  It was, therefore, thought a hard thing, that in the\r\nreparation which the seats had come to require in my time, the heritors\r\nand corporation should be obligated to pay the cost and expense of what\r\nwas so clearly the property of others; while it seemed an impossibility\r\nto get the whole tot of the proprietors of the pews to bear the expense\r\nof new-seating the kirk.  We had in the council many a long and weighty\r\nsederunt on the subject, without coming to any practical conclusion.  At\r\nlast, I thought the best way, as the kirk was really become a disgrace to\r\nthe town, would be, for the corporation to undertake the repair entirely,\r\nupon an understanding that we were to be paid eighteen pence a bottom-\r\nroom, per _annum_, by the proprietors of the pews; and, on sounding the\r\nheritors, I found them all most willing to consent thereto, glad to be\r\nrelieved from the awful expense of gutting and replenishing such a great\r\nconcern as the kirk was.  Accordingly the council having agreed to this\r\nproposal, we had plans and estimates made, and notice given to the owners\r\nof pews of our intention.  The whole proceedings gave the greatest\r\nsatisfaction possible to the inhabitants in general, who lauded and\r\napproved of my discernment more and more.\r\n\r\nBy the estimate, it was found that the repairs would cost about a\r\nthousand pounds; and by the plan, that the seats, at eighteen pence a\r\nsitter, would yield better than a hundred pounds a-year; so that there\r\nwas no scruple, on the part of the town-council, in borrowing the money\r\nwanted.  This was the first public debt ever contracted by the\r\ncorporation, and people were very fain to get their money lodged at five\r\nper cent. on such good security; in so much, that we had a great deal\r\nmore offered than we required at that time and epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII--THE LAW PLEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe repair of the kirk was undertaken by contract with William Plane, the\r\njoiner, with whom I was in terms at the time anent the bigging of a land\r\nof houses on my new steading at the town-end.  A most reasonable man in\r\nall things he was, and in no concern of my own had I a better\r\nsatisfaction than in the house he built for me at the conjuncture when he\r\nhad the town's work in the kirk; but there was at that period among us a\r\ncertain person, of the name of Nabal Smeddum, a tobacconist by calling,\r\nwho, up to this season, had been regarded but as a droll and comical body\r\nat a coothy crack.  He was, in stature, of the lower order of mankind,\r\nbut endowed with an inclination towards corpulency, by which he had\r\nacquired some show of a belly, and his face was round, and his cheeks\r\nboth red and sleeky.  He was, however, in his personalities, chiefly\r\nremarkable for two queer and twinkling little eyes, and for a habitual\r\ncustom of licking his lips whenever he said any thing of pith or\r\njocosity, or thought that he had done so, which was very often the case.\r\nIn his apparel, as befitted his trade, he wore a suit of snuff-coloured\r\ncloth, and a brown round-eared wig, that curled close in to his neck.\r\n\r\nMr Smeddum, as I have related, was in some estimation for his comicality;\r\nbut he was a dure hand at an argument, and would not see the plainest\r\ntruth when it was not on his side of the debate.  No occasion or cause,\r\nhowever, had come to pass by which this inherent cross-grainedness was\r\nstirred into action, till the affair of reseating the kirk--a measure, as\r\nI have mentioned, which gave the best satisfaction; but it happened that,\r\non a Saturday night, as I was going soberly home from a meeting of the\r\nmagistrates in the clerk's chamber, I by chance recollected that I stood\r\nin need of having my box replenished; and accordingly, in the most\r\ninnocent and harmless manner that it was possible for a man to do, I\r\nstepped into this Mr Smeddum, the tobacconist's shop, and while he was\r\ncompounding my mixture from the two canisters that stood on his counter,\r\nand I was in a manner doing nothing but looking at the number of\r\ncounterfeit sixpences and shillings that were nailed thereon as an\r\nadmonishment to his customers, he said to me, \"So, provost, we're to hae\r\na new lining to the kirk.  I wonder, when ye were at it, that ye didna\r\nrather think of bigging another frae the fundament, for I'm thinking the\r\nwalls are no o' a capacity of strength to outlast this seating.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing, as I did, the tough temper of the body, I can attribute my\r\nentering into an argument with him on the subject to nothing but some\r\ninconsiderate infatuation; for when I said heedlessly, the walls are very\r\ngood, he threw the brass snuff-spoon with an ecstasy in to one of the\r\ncanisters, and lifting his two hands into a posture of admiration,--cried,\r\nas if he had seen an unco--\r\n\r\n\"Good! surely, provost, ye hae na had an inspection; they're crackit in\r\ndivers places; they're shotten out wi' infirmity in others.  In short,\r\nthe whole kirk, frae the coping to the fundament, is a fabric smitten wi'\r\na paralytic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very extraordinar, Mr Smeddum,\" was my reply, \"that nobody has seen\r\na' this but yoursel'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Na, if ye will deny the fact, provost,\" quo' he, \"it's o' no service for\r\nme to say a word; but there has to a moral certainty been a slackness\r\nsomewhere, or how has it happened that the wa's were na subjected to a\r\nright inspection before this job o' the seating?\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, I had seen the great error into the which I had fallen, by\r\nentering on a confabulation with Mr Smeddum; so I said to him, \"It' no a\r\nmatter for you and me to dispute about, so I'll thank you to fill my\r\nbox;\" the which manner of putting an end to the debate he took very ill;\r\nand after I left the shop, he laid the marrow of our discourse open to Mr\r\nThreeper the writer, who by chance went in, like mysel', to get a supply\r\nof rappee for the Sabbath.  That limb of the law discerning a sediment of\r\nlitigation in the case, eggit on Mr Smeddum into a persuasion that the\r\nseating of the kirk was a thing which the magistrates had no legal\r\nauthority to undertake.  At this critical moment, my ancient adversary\r\nand seeming friend, the dean of guild, happened to pass the door, and the\r\nbickering snuff-man seeing him, cried to him to come in.  It was a very\r\nunfortunate occurrence; for Mr M'Lucre having a secret interest, as I\r\nhave intimated, in the Whinstone quarry, when he heard of taking down\r\nwalls and bigging them up again, he listened with greedy ears to the\r\ndubieties of Mr Threeper, and loudly, and to the heart's content of Mr\r\nSmeddum, condemned the frailty and infirmity of the kirk, as a building\r\nin general.\r\n\r\nIt would be overly tedious to mention, however, all the outs and ins of\r\nthe affair; but, from less to more, a faction was begotten, and grew to\r\nhead, and stirring among the inhabitants of the town, not only with\r\nregard to the putting of new seats within the old walls, but likewise as\r\nto the power of the magistrates to lay out any part of the public funds\r\nin the reparation of the kirk; and the upshot was, a contribution among\r\ncertain malecontents, to enable Mr Threeper to consult on all the points.\r\n\r\nAs in all similar cases, the parties applying for legal advice were\r\nheartened into a plea by the opinion they got, and the town-council was\r\nthrown into the greatest consternation by receiving notice that the\r\nmalecontents were going to extremities.\r\n\r\nTwo things I saw it was obligational on me to urge forward; the one was\r\nto go on still with the reparations, and the other to contest the law-\r\nsuit, although some were for waiting in the first case till the plea was\r\nsettled, and in the second to make no defence, but to give up our\r\nintention anent the new-seating.  But I thought that, as we had borrowed\r\nthe money for the repairs, we should proceed; and I had a vista that the\r\ncontribution raised by the Smeddumites, as they were caller, would run\r\nout, being from their own pockets, whereas we fought with the public\r\npurse in our hand; and by dint of exhortation to that effect, I carried\r\nthe majority to go into my plan, which in the end was most gratifying,\r\nfor the kirk was in a manner made as good as new, and the contributional\r\nstock of the Smeddumites was entirely rookit by the lawyers, who would\r\nfain have them to form another, assuring them that, no doubt, the legal\r\npoint was in their favour.  But every body knows the uncertainty of a\r\nlegal opinion; and although the case was given up, for lack of a fund to\r\ncarry it on, there was a living ember of discontent left in its ashes,\r\nready to kindle into a flame on the first puff of popular\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII--THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit by which the Smeddumites were actuated in ecclesiastical\r\naffairs, was a type and taste of the great distemper with which all the\r\nworld was, more or less, at the time inflamed, and which cast the ancient\r\nstate and monarchy of France into the perdition of anarchy and confusion.\r\nI think, upon the whole, however, that our royal burgh was not afflicted\r\nto any very dangerous degree, though there was a sort of itch of it among\r\na few of the sedentary orders, such as the weavers and shoemakers, who,\r\nby the nature of sitting long in one posture, are apt to become subject\r\nto the flatulence of theoretical opinions; but although this was my\r\nnotion, yet knowing how much better the king and government were\r\nacquainted with the true condition of things than I could to a certainty\r\nbe, I kept a steady eye on the proceedings of the ministers and\r\nparliament at London, taking them for an index and model for the\r\nmanagement of the public concerns, which, by the grace of God, and the\r\nhandling of my friends, I was raised up and set forward to undertake.\r\n\r\nSeeing the great dread and anxiety that was above, as to the inordinate\r\nliberty of the multitude, and how necessary it was to bridle popularity,\r\nwhich was become rampant and ill to ride, kicking at all established\r\norder, and trying to throw both king and nobles from the saddle, I\r\nresolved to discountenance all tumultuous meetings, and to place every\r\nreasonable impediment in the way of multitudes assembling together:\r\nindeed, I had for many years been of opinion, that fairs were become a\r\ngreat political evil to the regular shop-keepers, by reason of the\r\npackmen, and other travelling merchants, coming with their wares and\r\nunder-selling us; so that both private interest and public principle\r\nincited me on to do all in my power to bring our fair-days into\r\ndisrepute.  It cannot be told what a world of thought and consideration\r\nthis cost me before I lighted on the right method, nor, without a dive\r\ninto the past times of antiquity, is it in the power of man to understand\r\nthe difficulties of the matter.\r\n\r\nSome of our fair-days were remnants of the papistical idolatry, and\r\ninstituted of old by the Pope and Cardinals, in order to make an income\r\nfrom the vice and immorality that was usually rife at the same.  These,\r\nin the main points, were only market-days of a blither kind than the\r\ncommon.  The country folks came in dressed in their best, the schools got\r\nthe play, and a long rank of sweety-wives and their stands, covered with\r\nthe wonted dainties of the occasion, occupied the sunny side of the High\r\nStreet; while the shady side was, in like manner, taken possession of by\r\nthe packmen, who, in their booths, made a marvellous display of goods of\r\nan inferior quality, with laces and ribands of all colours, hanging down\r\nin front, and twirling like pinnets in the wind.  There was likewise the\r\nallurement of some compendious show of wild beasts; in short, a swatch of\r\nevery thing that the art of man has devised for such occasions, to wile\r\naway the bawbee.\r\n\r\nBesides the fairs of this sort, that may be said to be of a pious origin,\r\nthere were others of a more boisterous kind, that had come of the times\r\nof trouble, when the trades paraded with war-like weapons, and the\r\nbanners of their respective crafts; and in every seventh year we had a\r\nresuscitation of King Crispianus in all his glory and regality, with the\r\nman in the coat-of-mail, of bell-metal, and the dukes, and lord mayor of\r\nLondon, at the which, the influx of lads and lasses from the country was\r\njust prodigious, and the rioting and rampaging at night, the brulies and\r\nthe dancing, was worse than Vanity Fair in the Pilgrim's Progress.\r\n\r\nTo put down, and utterly to abolish, by stress of law, or authority, any\r\nancient pleasure of the commonality, I had learned, by this time, was not\r\nwisdom, and that the fairs were only to be effectually suppressed by\r\nlosing their temptations, and so to cease to call forth any expectation\r\nof merriment among the people.  Accordingly, with respect to the fairs of\r\npious origin, I, without expounding my secret motives, persuaded the\r\ncouncil, that, having been at so great an expense in new-paving the\r\nstreets, we ought not to permit the heavy caravans of wild beasts to\r\noccupy, as formerly, the front of the Tolbooth towards the Cross; but to\r\norder them, for the future, to keep at the Greenhead.  This was, in a\r\nmanner, expurgating them out of the town altogether; and the consequence\r\nwas, that the people, who were wont to assemble in the High Street, came\r\nto be divided, part gathering at the Greenhead, round the shows, and part\r\nremaining among the stands and the booths; thus an appearance was given\r\nof the fairs being less attended than formerly, and gradually, year after\r\nyear, the venerable race of sweety-wives, and chatty packmen, that were\r\nso detrimental to the shopkeepers, grew less and less numerous, until the\r\nfairs fell into insignificance.\r\n\r\nAt the parade fair, the remnant of the weapon-showing, I proceeded more\r\nroundly to work, and resolved to debar, by proclamation, all persons from\r\nappearing with arms; but the deacons of the trades spared me the trouble\r\nof issuing the same, for they dissuaded their crafts from parading.\r\nNothing, however, so well helped me out as the volunteers, of which I\r\nwill speak by and by; for when the war began, and they were formed,\r\nnobody could afterwards abide to look at the fantastical and disorderly\r\nmarching of the trades, in their processions and paradings; so that, in\r\nthis manner, all the glory of the fairs being shorn and expunged, they\r\nhave fallen into disrepute, and have suffered a natural suppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX--THE VOLUNTEERING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volunteers began in the year 1793, when the democrats in Paris\r\nthreatened the downfall and utter subversion of kings, lords, and\r\ncommons.  As became us who were of the council, we drew up an address to\r\nhis majesty, assuring him that our lives and fortunes were at his\r\ndisposal.  To the which dutiful address, we received, by return of post,\r\na very gracious answer; and, at the same time, the lord-lieutenant gave\r\nme a bit hint, that it would be very pleasant to his majesty to hear that\r\nwe had volunteers in our town, men of creditable connexions, and willing\r\nto defend their property.\r\n\r\nWhen I got this note from his lordship, I went to Mr Pipe, the\r\nwine-merchant, and spoke to him concerning it, and we had some discreet\r\nconversation on the same; in the which it was agreed between us that, as\r\nI was now rather inclined to a corpulency of parts, and being likewise\r\nchief civil magistrate, it would not do to set myself at the head of a\r\nbody of soldiers, but that the consequence might be made up to me in the\r\nclothing of the men; so I consented to put the business into his hands\r\nupon this understanding.  Accordingly, he went the same night with me to\r\nMr Dinton, that was in the general merchandising line, a part-owner in\r\nvessels, a trafficker in corn, and now and then a canny discounter of\r\nbills, at a moderate rate, to folk in straits and difficulties.  And we\r\ntold him--the same being agreed between us, as the best way of\r\nfructifying the job to a profitable issue--that, as provost, I had got an\r\nintimation to raise a corps of volunteers, and that I thought no better\r\nhand could be got for a co-operation than him and Mr Pipe, who was\r\npointed out to me as a gentleman weel qualified for the command.\r\n\r\nMr Dinton, who was a proud man, and an offset from one of the county\r\nfamilies, I could see was not overly pleased at the preferment over him\r\ngiven to Mr Pipe, so that I was in a manner constrained to loot a sort a-\r\njee, and to wile him into good-humour with all the ability in my power,\r\nby saying that it was natural enough of the king and government to think\r\nof Mr Pipe as one of the most proper men in the town, he paying, as he\r\ndid, the largest sum of the king's dues at the excise, and being, as we\r\nall knew, in a great correspondence with foreign ports--and I winkit to\r\nMr Pipe as I said this, and he could with a difficulty keep his\r\ncountenance at hearing how I so beguiled Mr Dinton into a spirit of\r\nloyalty for the raising of the volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe ice being thus broken, next day we had a meeting, before the council\r\nmet, to take the business into public consideration, and we thereat\r\nsettled on certain creditable persons in the town, of a known principle,\r\nas the fittest to be officers under the command of Mr Pipe, as\r\ncommandant, and Mr Dinton, as his colleague under him.  We agreed among\r\nus, as the custom was in other places, that they should be elected major,\r\ncaptain, lieutenants, and ensigns, by the free votes of the whole corps,\r\naccording to the degrees that we had determined for them.  In the doing\r\nof this, and the bringing it to pass, my skill and management was greatly\r\napproved and extolled by all who had a peep behind the curtain.\r\n\r\nThe town-council being, as I have intimated, convened to hear the\r\ngracious answer to the address read, and to take into consideration the\r\nsuggesting anent the volunteering, met in the clerk's chamber, where we\r\nagreed to call a meeting of the inhabitants of the town by proclamation,\r\nand by a notice in the church.  This being determined, Mr Pipe and Mr\r\nDinton got a paper drawn up, and privately, before the Sunday, a number\r\nof their genteeler friends, including those whom we had noted down to be\r\nelected officers, set their names as willing to be volunteers.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, Mr Pittle, at my instigation, preached a sermon, showing\r\nforth the necessity of arming ourselves in the defence of all that was\r\ndear to us.  It was a discourse of great method and sound argument, but\r\nnot altogether so quickened with pith and bir as might have been wished\r\nfor; but it paved the way to the reading out of the summons for the\r\ninhabitants to meet the magistrates in the church on the Thursday\r\nfollowing, for the purpose, as it was worded by the town-clerk, to take\r\ninto consideration the best means of saving the king and kingdom in the\r\nthen monstrous crisis of public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe discourse, with the summons, and a rumour and whispering that had in\r\nthe mean time taken place, caused the desired effect; in so much, that,\r\non the Thursday, there was a great congregation of the male portion of\r\nthe people.  At the which, old Mr Dravel--a genteel man he was, well read\r\nin matters of history, though somewhat over-portioned with a conceit of\r\nhimself--got up on the table, in one of the table-seats forenent the\r\npoopit, and made a speech suitable to the occasion; in the which he set\r\nforth what manful things had been done of old by the Greeks and the\r\nRomans for their country, and, waxing warm with his subject, he cried out\r\nwith a loud voice, towards the end of the discourse, giving at the same\r\ntime a stamp with his foot, \"Come, then, as men and as citizens; the cry\r\nis for your altars and your God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gude save's, Mr Dravel, are ye gane by yoursel?\" cried Willy Coggle from\r\nthe front of the loft, a daft body that was ayefar ben on all public\r\noccasions--\"to think that our God's a Pagan image in need of sick\r\nfeckless help as the like o' thine?\"  The which outcry of Willy raised a\r\nmost extraordinary laugh at the fine paternoster, about the ashes of our\r\nancestors, that Mr Dravel had been so vehemently rehearsing; and I was\r\ngreatly afraid that the solemnity of the day would be turned into a\r\nridicule.  However, Mr Pipe, who was upon the whole a man no without both\r\nsense and capacity, rose and said, that our business was to strengthen\r\nthe hands of government, by coming forward as volunteers; and therefore,\r\nwithout thinking it necessary, among the people of this blessed land, to\r\nurge any arguments in furtherance of that object, he would propose that a\r\nvolunteer corps should be raised; and he begged leave of me, who, as\r\nprovost, was in the chair, to read a few words that he had hastily thrown\r\ntogether on the subject, as the outlines of a pact of agreement among\r\nthose who might be inclined to join with him.  I should here, however,\r\nmention, that the said few words of a pact was the costive product\r\novernight of no small endeavour between me and Mr Dinton as well as him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thus made his motion, Mr Dinton, as we had concerted, got up\r\nand seconded the same, pointing out the liberal spirit in which the\r\nagreement was drawn, as every person signing it was eligible to be an\r\nofficer of any rank, and every man had a vote in the preferment of the\r\nofficers.  All which was mightily applauded; and upon this I rose, and\r\nsaid, \"It was a pleasant thing for me to have to report to his majesty's\r\ngovernment the loyalty of the inhabitants of our town, and the unanimity\r\nof the volunteering spirit among them--and to testify,\" said I, \"to all\r\nthe world, how much we are sensible of the blessings of the true liberty\r\nwe enjoy, I would suggest that the matter of the volunteering be left\r\nentirely to Mr Pipe and Mr Dinton, with a few other respectable\r\ngentlemen, as a committee, to carry the same into effect;\" and with that\r\nI looked, as it were, round the church, and then said, \"There's Mr\r\nOranger, a better couldna be joined with them.\"  He was a most creditable\r\nman, and a grocer, that we had waled out for a captain; so I desired,\r\nhaving got a nod of assent from him, that Mr Oranger's name might be\r\nadded to their's, as one of the committee.  In like manner I did by all\r\nthe rest whom we had previously chosen.  Thus, in a manner, predisposing\r\nthe public towards them for officers.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the week, by the endeavours of the committee, a\r\nsufficient number of names was got to the paper, and the election of the\r\nofficers came on on the Tuesday following; at which, though there was a\r\nsort of a contest, and nothing could be a fairer election, yet the very\r\npersons that we had chosen were elected, though some of them had but a\r\nnarrow chance.  Mr Pipe was made the commandant, by a superiority of only\r\ntwo votes over Mr Dinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX--THE CLOTHING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an understood thing at first, that, saving in the matter of guns\r\nand other military implements, the volunteers were to be at all their own\r\nexpenses; out of which, both tribulation and disappointment ensued; for\r\nwhen it came to be determined about the uniforms, Major Pipe found that\r\nhe could by no possibility wise all the furnishing to me, every one being\r\ndisposed to get his regimentals from his own merchant; and there was also\r\na division anent the colour of the same, many of the doucer sort of the\r\nmen being blate of appearing in scarlet and gold-lace, insisting with a\r\ngreat earnestness, almost to a sedition, on the uniform being blue.  So\r\nthat the whole advantage of a contract was frustrated, and I began to be\r\nsorry that I had not made a point of being, notwithstanding the alleged\r\nweight and impediment of my corpulence, the major-commandant myself.\r\nHowever, things, after some time, began to take a turn for the better;\r\nand the art of raising volunteers being better understood in the kingdom,\r\nMr Pipe went into Edinburgh, and upon some conference with the lord\r\nadvocate, got permission to augment his force by another company, and\r\nleave to draw two days' pay a-week for account of the men, and to defray\r\nthe necessary expenses of the corps.  The doing of this bred no little\r\nagitation in the same; and some of the forward and upsetting spirits of\r\nthe younger privates, that had been smitten, though not in a disloyal\r\nsense, with the insubordinate spirit of the age, clamoured about the\r\nrights of the original bargain with them, insisting that the officers had\r\nno privilege to sell their independence, and a deal of trash of that\r\nsort, and finally withdrew from the corps, drawing, to the consternation\r\nof the officers, the pay that had been taken in their names; and which\r\nthe officers could not refuse, although it was really wanted for the\r\ncontingencies of the service, as Major Pipe himself told me.\r\n\r\nWhen the corps had thus been rid of these turbulent spirits, the men grew\r\nmore manageable and rational, assenting by little and little to all the\r\nproposals of the officers, until there was a true military dominion of\r\ndiscipline gained over them; and a joint contract was entered into\r\nbetween Major Pipe and me, for a regular supply of all necessaries, in\r\norder to insure a uniform appearance, which, it is well known, is\r\nessential to a right discipline.  In the end, when the eyes of men in\r\ncivil stations had got accustomed to military show and parade, it was\r\ndetermined to change the colour of the cloth from blue to red, the former\r\nhaving at first been preferred, and worn for some time; in the\r\naccomplishment of which change I had (and why should I disguise the\r\nhonest fact?) my share of the advantage which the kingdom at large drew,\r\nin that period of anarchy and confusion, from the laudable establishment\r\nof a volunteer force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI--THE PRESSGANG\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the same just and necessary war for all that was dear to us, in\r\nwhich the volunteers were raised, one of the severest trials happened to\r\nme that ever any magistrate was subjected to.  I had, at the time, again\r\nsubsided into an ordinary counsellor; but it so fell out that, by reason\r\nof Mr Shuttlethrift, who was then provost, having occasion and need to go\r\ninto Glasgow upon some affairs of his own private concerns, he being\r\ninterested in the Kilbeacon cotton-mill; and Mr Dalrye, the bailie, who\r\nshould have acted for him, being likewise from home, anent a plea he had\r\nwith a neighbour concerning the bounds of their rigs and gables; the\r\nwhole authority and power of the magistrates devolved, by a courtesy on\r\nthe part of their colleague, Bailie Hammerman, into my hands.\r\n\r\nFor some time before, there had been an ingathering among us of sailor\r\nlads from the neighbouring ports, who on their arrival, in order to shun\r\nthe pressgangs, left their vessels and came to scog themselves with us.\r\nBy this, a rumour or a suspicion rose that the men-of-war's men were\r\nsuddenly to come at the dead hour of the night and sweep them all away.\r\nHeaven only knows whether this notice was bred in the fears and\r\njealousies of the people, or was a humane inkling given, by some of the\r\nmen-of-war's men, to put the poor sailor lads on their guard, was never\r\nknown.  But on a Saturday night, as I was on the eve of stepping into my\r\nbed, I shall never forget it--Mrs Pawkie was already in, and as sound as\r\na door-nail--and I was just crooking my mouth to blow out the candle,\r\nwhen I heard a rap.  As our bed-room window was over the door, I looked\r\nout.  It was a dark night; but I could see by a glaik of light from a\r\nneighbour's window, that there was a man with a cocked hat at the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's your will?\" said I to him, as I looked out at him in my nightcap.\r\nHe made no other answer, but that he was one of his majesty's officers,\r\nand had business with the justice.\r\n\r\nI did not like this Englification and voice of claim and authority;\r\nhowever, I drew on my stockings and breeks again, and taking my wife's\r\nflannel coaty about my shoulders--for I was then troubled with the\r\nrheumatiz--I went down, and, opening the door, let in the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"I come,\" said he, \"to show you my warrant and commission, and to\r\nacquaint you that, having information of several able-bodied seamen being\r\nin the town, I mean to make a search for them.\"\r\n\r\nI really did not well know what to say at the moment; but I begged him,\r\nfor the love of peace and quietness, to defer his work till the next\r\nmorning: but he said he must obey his orders; and he was sorry that it\r\nwas his duty to be on so disagreeable a service, with many other things,\r\nthat showed something like a sense of compassion that could not have been\r\nhoped for in the captain of a pressgang.\r\n\r\nWhen he had said this, he then went away, saying, for he saw my\r\ntribulation, that it would be as well for me to be prepared in case of\r\nany riot.  This was the worst news of all; but what could I do?  I\r\nthereupon went again to Mrs Pawkie, and shaking her awake, told her what\r\nwas going on, and a terrified woman she was.  I then dressed myself with\r\nall possible expedition, and went to the town-clerk's, and we sent for\r\nthe town-officers, and then adjourned to the council-chamber to wait the\r\nissue of what might betide.\r\n\r\nIn my absence, Mrs Pawkie rose out of her bed, and by some wonderful\r\ninstinct collecting all the bairns, went with them to the minister's\r\nhouse, as to a place of refuge and sanctuary.\r\n\r\nShortly after we had been in the council-room, I opened the window and\r\nlooked out, but all was still; the town was lying in the defencelessness\r\nof sleep, and nothing was heard but the clicking of the town-clock in the\r\nsteeple over our heads.  By and by, however, a sough and pattering of\r\nfeet was heard approaching; and shortly after, in looking out, we saw the\r\npressgang, headed by their officers, with cutlasses by their side, and\r\ngreat club-sticks in their hands.  They said nothing; but the sound of\r\ntheir feet on the silent stones of the causey, was as the noise of a\r\ndreadful engine.  They passed, and went on; and all that were with me in\r\nthe council stood at the windows and listened.  In the course of a minute\r\nor two after, two lassies, with a callan, that had been out, came flying\r\nand wailing, giving the alarm to the town.  Then we heard the driving of\r\nthe bludgeons on the doors, and the outcries of terrified women; and\r\npresently after we saw the poor chased sailors running in their shirts,\r\nwith their clothes in their hands, as if they had been felons and\r\nblackguards caught in guilt, and flying from the hands of justice.\r\n\r\nThe town was awakened with the din as with the cry of fire; and lights\r\ncame starting forward, as it were, to the windows.  The women were out\r\nwith lamentations and vows of vengeance.  I was in a state of horror\r\nunspeakable.  Then came some three or four of the pressgang with a\r\nstruggling sailor in their clutches, with nothing but his trousers on--his\r\nshirt riven from his back in the fury.  Syne came the rest of the gang\r\nand their officers, scattered as it were with a tempest of mud and\r\nstones, pursued and battered by a troop of desperate women and weans,\r\nwhose fathers and brothers were in jeopardy.  And these were followed by\r\nthe wailing wife of the pressed man, with her five bairns, clamouring in\r\ntheir agony to heaven against the king and government for the outrage.  I\r\ncouldna listen to the fearful justice of their outcry, but sat down in a\r\ncorner of the council-chamber with my fingers in my ears.\r\n\r\nIn a little while a shout of triumph rose from the mob, and we heard them\r\nreturning, and I felt, as it were, relieved; but the sound of their\r\nvoices became hoarse and terrible as they drew near, and, in a moment, I\r\nheard the jingle of twenty broken windows rattle in the street.  My heart\r\nmisgave me; and, indeed, it was my own windows.  They left not one pane\r\nunbroken; and nothing kept them from demolishing the house to the ground-\r\nstone but the exhortations of Major Pipe, who, on hearing the uproar, was\r\nup and out, and did all in his power to arrest the fury of the tumult.  It\r\nseems, the mob had taken it into their heads that I had signed what they\r\ncalled the press-warrants; and on driving the gang out of the town, and\r\nrescuing the man, they came to revenge themselves on me and mine; which\r\nis the cause that made me say it was a miraculous instinct that led Mrs\r\nPawkie to take the family to Mr Pittle's; for, had they been in the\r\nhouse, it is not to be told what the consequences might have been.\r\n\r\nBefore morning the riot was ended, but the damage to my house was very\r\ngreat; and I was intending, as the public had done the deed, that the\r\ntown should have paid for it.  \"But,\" said Mr Keelivine, the town-clerk,\r\n\"I think you may do better; and this calamity, if properly handled to the\r\nGovernment, may make your fortune,\" I reflected on the hint; and\r\naccordingly, the next day, I went over to the regulating captain of the\r\npressgang, and represented to him the great damage and detriment which I\r\nhad suffered, requesting him to represent to government that it was all\r\nowing to the part I had taken in his behalf.  To this, for a time, he\r\nmade some scruple of objection; but at last he drew up, in my presence, a\r\nletter to the lords of the admiralty, telling what he had done, and how\r\nhe and his men had been ill-used, and that the house of the\r\nchief-magistrate of the town had been in a manner destroyed by the\r\nrioters.\r\n\r\nBy the same post I wrote off myself to the lord advocate, and likewise to\r\nthe secretary of state, in London; commanding, very properly, the prudent\r\nand circumspect manner in which the officer had come to apprize me of his\r\nduty, and giving as faithful an account as I well could of the riot;\r\nconcluding with a simple notification of what had been done to my house,\r\nand the outcry that might be raised in the town were any part of the\r\ntown's funds to be used in the repairs.\r\n\r\nBoth the lord advocate and Mr Secretary of State wrote me back by retour\r\nof post, thanking me for my zeal in the public service; and I was\r\ninformed that, as it might not be expedient to agitate in the town the\r\npayment of the damage which my house had received, the lords of the\r\ntreasury would indemnify me for the same; and this was done in a manner\r\nwhich showed the blessings we enjoy under our most venerable\r\nconstitution; for I was not only thereby enabled, by what I got, to\r\nrepair the windows, but to build up a vacant steading; the same which I\r\nsettled last year on my dochter, Marion, when she was married to Mr\r\nGeery, of the Gatherton Holme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII--THE WIG DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe affair of the pressgang gave great concern to all of the council; for\r\nit was thought that the loyalty of the burgh would be called in question,\r\nand doubted by the king's ministers, notwithstanding our many assurances\r\nto the contrary; the which sense and apprehension begat among us an\r\ninordinate anxiety to manifest our principles on all expedient occasions.\r\nIn the doing of this, divers curious and comical things came to pass; but\r\nthe most comical of all was what happened at the Michaelmas dinner\r\nfollowing the riot.\r\n\r\nThe weather, for some days before, had been raw for that time of the\r\nyear, and Michaelmas-day was, both for wind and wet and cold, past\r\nordinar; in so much that we were obligated to have a large fire in the\r\ncouncil-chamber, where we dined.  Round this fire, after drinking his\r\nmajesty's health and the other appropriate toasts, we were sitting as\r\ncozy as could be; and every one the longer he sat, and the oftener his\r\nglass visited the punch-bowl, waxed more and more royal, till everybody\r\nwas in a most hilarious temperament, singing songs and joining chorus\r\nwith the greatest cordiality.\r\n\r\nIt happened, among others of the company, there was a gash old carl, the\r\nlaird of Bodletonbrae, who was a very capital hand at a joke; and he,\r\nchancing to notice that the whole of the magistrates and town-council\r\nthen present wore wigs, feigned to become out of all bounds with the\r\ndemonstrations of his devotion to king and country; and others that were\r\nthere, not wishing to appear any thing behind him in the same, vied in\r\ntheir sprose of patriotism, and bragging in a manful manner of what, in\r\nthe hour of trial, they would be seen to do.  Bodletonbrae was all the\r\ntime laughing in his sleeve at the way he was working them on, till at\r\nlast, after they had flung the glasses twice or thrice over their\r\nshoulders, he proposed we should throw our wigs in the fire next.  Surely\r\nthere was some glammer about us that caused us not to observe his\r\ndevilry, for the laird had no wig on his head.  Be that, however, as it\r\nmay, the instigation took effect, and in the twinkling of an eye every\r\nscalp was bare, and the chimley roaring with the roasting of gude kens\r\nhow many powdered wigs well fattened with pomatum.  But scarcely was the\r\ndeed done, till every one was admonished of his folly, by the laird\r\nlaughing, like a being out of his senses, at the number of bald heads and\r\nshaven crowns that his device had brought to light, and by one and all of\r\nus experiencing the coldness of the air on the nakedness of our upper\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that we then did was to send the town-officers, who were\r\nwaiting on as usual for the dribbles of the bottles and the leavings in\r\nthe bowls, to bring our nightcaps, but I trow few were so lucky as me,\r\nfor I had a spare wig at home, which Mrs Pawkie, my wife, a most\r\nconsiderate woman, sent to me; so that I was, in a manner, to all\r\nvisibility, none the worse of the ploy; but the rest of the council were\r\nperfect oddities within their wigs, and the sorest thing of all was, that\r\nthe exploit of burning the wigs had got wind; so that, when we left the\r\ncouncil-room, there was a great congregation of funny weans and misleart\r\ntrades' lads assembled before the tolbooth, shouting, and like as if they\r\nwere out of the body with daffing, to see so many of the heads of the\r\ntown in their night-caps, and no, maybe, just so solid at the time as\r\ncould have been wished.  Nor did the matter rest here; for the generality\r\nof the sufferers being in a public way, were obligated to appear the next\r\nday in their shops, and at their callings, with their nightcaps--for few\r\nof them had two wigs like me--by which no small merriment ensued, and was\r\ncontinued for many a day.  It would hardly, however, be supposed, that in\r\nsuch a matter anything could have redounded to my advantage; but so it\r\nfell out, that by my wife's prudence in sending me my other wig, it was\r\nobserved by the commonality, when we sallied forth to go home, that I had\r\non my wig, and it was thought I had a very meritorious command of myself,\r\nand was the only man in the town fit for a magistrate; for in everything\r\nI was seen to be most cautious and considerate.  I could not, however,\r\nwhen I saw the turn the affair took to my advantage, but reflect on what\r\nsmall and visionary grounds the popularity of public men will sometimes\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII--THREE THE DEATH OF MR M'LUCRE\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the affair recorded in the foregoing chapter, an event came\r\nto pass in the burgh that had been for some time foreseen.\r\n\r\nMy old friend and adversary, Bailie M'Lucre, being now a man well\r\nstricken in years, was one night, in going home from a gavawlling with\r\nsome of the neighbours at Mr Shuttlethrift's, the manufacturer's, (the\r\nbailie, canny man, never liket ony thing of the sort at his own cost and\r\noutlay,) having partaken largely of the bowl, for the manufacturer was of\r\na blithe humour--the bailie, as I was saying, in going home, was\r\novertaken by an apoplexy just at the threshold of his own door, and\r\nalthough it did not kill him outright, it shoved him, as it were, almost\r\ninto the very grave; in so much that he never spoke an articulate word\r\nduring the several weeks he was permitted to doze away his latter end;\r\nand accordingly he died, and was buried in a very creditable manner to\r\nthe community, in consideration of the long space of time he had been a\r\npublic man among us.\r\n\r\nBut what rendered the event of his death, in my opinion, the more\r\nremarkable, was, that I considered with him the last remnant of the old\r\npractice of managing the concerns of the town came to a period.  For now\r\nthat he is dead and gone, and also all those whom I found conjunct with\r\nhim, when I came into power and office, I may venture to say, that things\r\nin yon former times were not guided so thoroughly by the hand of a\r\ndisinterested integrity as in these latter years.  On the contrary, it\r\nseemed to be the use and wont of men in public trusts, to think they were\r\nfree to indemnify themselves in a left-handed way for the time and\r\ntrouble they bestowed in the same.  But the thing was not so far wrong in\r\nprinciple as in the hugger-muggering way in which it was done, and which\r\ngave to it a guilty colour, that, by the judicious stratagem of a right\r\nsystem, it would never have had.  In sooth to say, through the whole\r\ncourse of my public life, I met with no greater difficulties and trials\r\nthan in cleansing myself from the old habitudes of office.  For I must in\r\nverity confess, that I myself partook, in a degree, at my beginning, of\r\nthe caterpillar nature; and it was not until the light of happier days\r\ncalled forth the wings of my endowment, that I became conscious of being\r\nraised into public life for a better purpose than to prey upon the leaves\r\nand flourishes of the commonwealth.  So that, if I have seemed to speak\r\nlightly of those doings that are now denominated corruptions, I hope it\r\nwas discerned therein that I did so rather to intimate that such things\r\nwere, than to consider them as in themselves commendable.  Indeed, in\r\ntheir notations, I have endeavoured, in a manner, to be governed by the\r\nspirit of the times in which the transactions happened; for I have lived\r\nlong enough to remark, that if we judge of past events by present\r\nmotives, and do not try to enter into the spirit of the age when they\r\ntook place, and to see them with the eyes with which they were really\r\nseen, we shall conceit many things to be of a bad and wicked character\r\nthat were not thought so harshly of by those who witnessed them, nor even\r\nby those who, perhaps, suffered from them.  While, therefore, I think it\r\nhas been of a great advantage to the public to have survived that method\r\nof administration in which the like of Bailie M'Lucre was engendered, I\r\nwould not have it understood that I think the men who held the public\r\ntrusts in those days a whit less honest than the men of my own time.  The\r\nspirit of their own age was upon them, as that of ours is upon us, and\r\ntheir ways of working the wherry entered more or less into all their\r\ntrafficking, whether for the commonality, or for their own particular\r\nbehoof and advantage.\r\n\r\nI have been thus large and frank in my reflections anent the death of the\r\nbailie, because, poor man, he had outlived the times for which he was\r\nqualified; and, instead of the merriment and jocularity that his wily by-\r\nhand ways used to cause among his neighbours, the rising generation began\r\nto pick and dab at him, in such a manner, that, had he been much longer\r\nspared, it is to be feared he would not have been allowed to enjoy his\r\nearnings both with ease and honour.  However, he got out of the world\r\nwith some respect, and the matters of which I have now to speak, are\r\nexalted, both in method and principle, far above the personal\r\nconsiderations that took something from the public virtue of his day and\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV--THE WINDY YULE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of the winter, after the decease of Bailie M'Lucre,\r\nthat the great loss of lives took place, which every body agreed was one\r\nof the most calamitous things that had for many a year befallen the town.\r\n\r\nThree or four vessels were coming with cargoes of grain from Ireland;\r\nanother from the Baltic with Norawa deals; and a third from Bristol,\r\nwhere she had been on a charter for some Greenock merchants.\r\n\r\nIt happened that, for a time, there had been contrary winds, against\r\nwhich no vessel could enter the port, and the ships, whereof I have been\r\nspeaking, were all lying together at anchor in the bay, waiting a change\r\nof weather.  These five vessels were owned among ourselves, and their\r\ncrews consisted of fathers and sons belonging to the place, so that, both\r\nby reason of interest and affection, a more than ordinary concern was\r\nfelt for them; for the sea was so rough, that no boat could live in it to\r\ngo near them, and we had our fears that the men on board would be very\r\nill off.  Nothing, however, occurred but this natural anxiety, till the\r\nSaturday, which was Yule.  In the morning the weather was blasty and\r\nsleety, waxing more and more tempestuous till about mid-day, when the\r\nwind checked suddenly round from the nor-east to the sou-west, and blew a\r\ngale as if the prince of the powers of the air was doing his utmost to\r\nwork mischief.  The rain blattered, the windows clattered, the\r\nshop-shutters flapped, pigs from the lum-heads came rattling down like\r\nthunder-claps, and the skies were dismal both with cloud and carry.  Yet,\r\nfor all that, there was in the streets a stir and a busy visitation\r\nbetween neighbours, and every one went to their high windows, to look at\r\nthe five poor barks that were warsling against the strong arm of the\r\nelements of the storm and the ocean.\r\n\r\nStill the lift gloomed, and the wind roared, and it was as doleful a\r\nsight as ever was seen in any town afflicted with calamity, to see the\r\nsailors' wives, with their red cloaks about their heads, followed by\r\ntheir hirpling and disconsolate bairns, going one after another to the\r\nkirkyard, to look at the vessels where their helpless breadwinners were\r\nbattling with the tempest.  My heart was really sorrowful, and full of a\r\nsore anxiety to think of what might happen to the town, whereof so many\r\nwere in peril, and to whom no human magistracy could extend the arm of\r\nprotection.  Seeing no abatement of the wrath of heaven, that howled and\r\nroared around us, I put on my big-coat, and taking my staff in my hand,\r\nhaving tied down my hat with a silk handkerchief, towards gloaming I\r\nwalked likewise to the kirkyard, where I beheld such an assemblage of\r\nsorrow, as few men in situation have ever been put to the trial to\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nIn the lea of the kirk many hundreds of the town were gathered together;\r\nbut there was no discourse among them.  The major part were sailors'\r\nwives and weans, and at every new thud of the blast, a sob rose, and the\r\nmothers drew their bairns closer in about them, as if they saw the\r\nvisible hand of a foe raised to smite them.  Apart from the multitude, I\r\nobserved three or four young lasses standing behind the Whinnyhill\r\nfamilies' tomb, and I jealoused that they had joes in the ships; for they\r\noften looked to the bay, with long necks and sad faces, from behind the\r\nmonument.  A widow woman, one old Mary Weery, that was a lameter, and\r\ndependent on her son, who was on board the Louping Meg, (as the Lovely\r\nPeggy was nicknamed at the shore,) stood by herself, and every now and\r\nthen wrung her hands, crying, with a woeful voice, \"The Lord giveth and\r\nthe Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord;\"--but it was\r\nmanifest to all that her faith was fainting within her.  But of all the\r\npiteous objects there, on that doleful evening, none troubled my thoughts\r\nmore than three motherless children, that belonged to the mate of one of\r\nthe vessels in the jeopardy.  He was an Englishman that had been settled\r\nsome years in the town, where his family had neither kith nor kin; and\r\nhis wife having died about a month before, the bairns, of whom the eldest\r\nwas but nine or so, were friendless enough, though both my gudewife, and\r\nother well-disposed ladies, paid them all manner of attention till their\r\nfather would come home.  The three poor little things, knowing that he\r\nwas in one of the ships, had been often out and anxious, and they were\r\nthen sitting under the lea of a headstone, near their mother's grave,\r\nchittering and creeping closer and closer at every squall.  Never was\r\nsuch an orphan-like sight seen.\r\n\r\nWhen it began to be so dark that the vessels could no longer be discerned\r\nfrom the churchyard, many went down to the shore, and I took the three\r\nbabies home with me, and Mrs Pawkie made tea for them, and they soon\r\nbegan to play with our own younger children, in blythe forgetfulness of\r\nthe storm; every now and then, however, the eldest of them, when the\r\nshutters rattled and the lum-head roared, would pause in his innocent\r\ndaffing, and cower in towards Mrs Pawkie, as if he was daunted and\r\ndismayed by something he knew not what.\r\n\r\nMany a one that night walked the sounding shore in sorrow, and fires were\r\nlighted along it to a great extent; but the darkness and the noise of the\r\nraging deep, and the howling wind, never intermitted till about midnight:\r\nat which time a message was brought to me, that it might be needful to\r\nsend a guard of soldiers to the beach, for that broken masts and tackle\r\nhad come in, and that surely some of the barks had perished.  I lost no\r\ntime in obeying this suggestion, which was made to me by one of the\r\nowners of the Louping Meg; and to show that I sincerely sympathized with\r\nall those in affliction, I rose and dressed myself, and went down to the\r\nshore, where I directed several old boats to be drawn up by the fires,\r\nand blankets to be brought, and cordials prepared, for them that might be\r\nspared with life to reach the land; and I walked the beach with the\r\nmourners till the morning.\r\n\r\nAs the day dawned, the wind began to abate in its violence, and to wear\r\naway from the sou-west into the norit, but it was soon discovered that\r\nsome of the vessels with the corn had perished; for the first thing seen,\r\nwas a long fringe of tangle and grain along the line of the highwater\r\nmark, and every one strained with greedy and grieved eyes, as the\r\ndaylight brightened, to discover which had suffered.  But I can proceed\r\nno further with the dismal recital of that doleful morning.  Let it\r\nsuffice here to be known, that, through the haze, we at last saw three of\r\nthe vessels lying on their beam-ends with their masts broken, and the\r\nwaves riding like the furious horses of destruction over them.  What had\r\nbecome of the other two was never known; but it was supposed that they\r\nhad foundered at their anchors, and that all on board perished.\r\n\r\nThe day being now Sabbath, and the whole town idle, every body in a\r\nmanner was down on the beach, to help and mourn as the bodies, one after\r\nanother, were cast out by the waves.  Alas! few were the better of my\r\nprovident preparation, and it was a thing not to be described, to see,\r\nfor more than a mile along the coast, the new-made widows and fatherless\r\nbairns, mourning and weeping over the corpses of those they loved.\r\nSeventeen bodies were, before ten o'clock, carried to the desolated\r\ndwelling of their families; and when old Thomas Pull, the betheral, went\r\nto ring the bell for public worship, such was the universal sorrow of the\r\ntown, that Nanse Donsie, an idiot natural, ran up the street to stop him,\r\ncrying, in the voice of a pardonable desperation, \"Wha, in sic a time,\r\ncan praise the Lord?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV--THE SUBSCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe calamity of the storm opened and disposed the hearts of the whole\r\ntown to charity; and it was a pleasure to behold the manner in which the\r\ntide of sympathy flowed towards the sufferers.  Nobody went to the church\r\nin the forenoon; but when I had returned home from the shore, several of\r\nthe council met at my house to confer anent the desolation, and it was\r\nconcerted among us, at my suggestion, that there should be a meeting of\r\nthe inhabitants called by the magistrates, for the next day, in order to\r\ntake the public compassion with the tear in the eye--which was\r\naccordingly done by Mr Pittle himself from the pulpit, with a few\r\njudicious words on the heavy dispensation.  And the number of folk that\r\ncame forward to subscribe was just wonderful.  We got well on to a\r\nhundred pounds in the first two hours, besides many a bundle of old\r\nclothes.  But one of the most remarkable things in the business was done\r\nby Mr Macandoe.  He was, in his original, a lad of the place, who had\r\ngone into Glasgow, where he was in a topping line; and happening to be on\r\na visit to his friends at the time, he came to the meeting and put down\r\nhis name for twenty guineas, which he gave me in bank-notes--a sum of\r\nsuch liberality as had never been given to the town from one individual\r\nman, since the mortification of fifty pounds that we got by the will of\r\nMajor Bravery that died in Cheltenham, in England, after making his\r\nfortune in India.  The sum total of the subscription, when we got my\r\nlord's five-and-twenty guineas, was better than two hundred pounds\r\nsterling--for even several of the country gentlemen were very generous\r\ncontributors, and it is well known that they are not inordinately\r\ncharitable, especially to town folks--but the distribution of it was no\r\neasy task, for it required a discrimination of character as well as of\r\nnecessities.  It was at first proposed to give it over to the session.  I\r\nknew, however, that, in their hands, it would do no good; for Mr Pittle,\r\nthe minister, was a vain sort of a body, and easy to be fleeched, and the\r\nbold and the bardy with him would be sure to come in for a better share\r\nthan the meek and the modest, who might be in greater want.  So I set\r\nmyself to consider what was the best way of proceeding; and truly upon\r\nreflection, there are few events in my history that I look back upon with\r\nmore satisfaction than the part I performed in this matter; for, before\r\ngoing into any division of the money, I proposed that we should allot it\r\nto three classes--those who were destitute; those who had some help, but\r\nlarge families; and those to whom a temporality would be sufficient--and\r\nthat we should make a visitation to the houses of all the sufferers, in\r\norder to class them under their proper heads aright.  By this method, and\r\ntogether with what I had done personally in the tempest, I got great\r\npraise and laud from all reflecting people; and it is not now to be told\r\nwhat a consolation was brought to many a sorrowful widow and orphan's\r\nheart, by the patience and temperance with which the fund of liberality\r\nwas distributed; yet because a small sum was reserved to help some of the\r\nmore helpless at another time, and the same was put out to interest in\r\nthe town's books, there were not wanting evil-minded persons who went\r\nabout whispering calumnious innuendos to my disadvantage; but I know, by\r\nthis time, the nature of the world, and how impossible it is to reason\r\nwith such a seven-headed and ten-horned beast as the multitude.  So I\r\nsaid nothing; only I got the town-clerk's young man, who acted as clerk\r\nto the committee of the subscription, to make out a fair account of the\r\ndistribution of the money, and to what intent the residue had been placed\r\nin the town-treasurer's hand; and this I sent unto a friend in Glasgow to\r\nget printed for me, the which he did; and when I got the copies, I\r\ndirected one to every individual subscriber, and sent the town-drummer an\r\nend's errand with them, which was altogether a proceeding of a method and\r\nexactness so by common, that it not only quenched the envy of spite\r\nutterly out, but contributed more and more to give me weight and\r\nauthority with the community, until I had the whole sway and mastery of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI--OF THE PUBLIC LAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath is a great reformer of corporate bodies, and we found, now and\r\nthen, the benefit of his helping hand in our royal burgh.  From the time\r\nof my being chosen into the council; and, indeed, for some years before,\r\nMr Hirple had been a member, but, from some secret and unexpressed\r\nunderstanding among us, he was never made a bailie; for he was not liked;\r\nhaving none of that furthy and jocose spirit so becoming in a magistrate\r\nof that degree, and to which the gifts of gravity and formality make but\r\nan unsubstantial substitute.  He was, on the contrary, a queer and\r\nquistical man, of a small stature of body, with an outshot breast, the\r\nwhich, I am inclined to think, was one of the main causes of our never\r\npromoting him into the ostensible magistracy; besides, his temper was\r\nexceedingly brittle; and in the debates anent the weightiest concerns of\r\nthe public, he was apt to puff and fiz, and go off with a pluff of anger\r\nlike a pioye; so that, for the space of more than five-and-twenty years,\r\nwe would have been glad of his resignation; and, in the heat of argument,\r\nthere was no lack of hints to that effect from more than one of his\r\nfriends, especially from Bailie Picken, who was himself a sharp-tempered\r\nindividual, and could as ill sit quiet under a contradiction as any man I\r\never was conjunct with.  But just before the close of my second\r\nprovostry, Providence was kind to Mr Hirple, and removed him gently away\r\nfrom the cares, and troubles, and the vain policy of this contending\r\nworld, into, as I hope and trust, a far better place.\r\n\r\nIt may seem, hereafter, to the unlearned readers among posterity,\r\nparticularly to such of them as may happen not to be versed in that state\r\nof things which we were obligated to endure, very strange that I should\r\nmake this special mention of Mr Hirple at his latter end, seeing and\r\nobserving the small store and account I have thus set upon his talents\r\nand personalities.  But the verity of the reason is plainly this: we\r\nnever discovered his worth and value till we had lost him, or rather,\r\ntill we found the defect and gap that his death caused, and the\r\naffliction that came in through it upon us in the ill-advised selection\r\nof Mr Hickery to fill his vacant place.\r\n\r\nThe spunky nature of Mr Hirple was certainly very disagreeable often to\r\nmost of the council, especially when there was any difference of opinion;\r\nbut then it was only a sort of flash, and at the vote he always, like a\r\nreasonable man, sided with the majority, and never after attempted to rip\r\nup a decision when it was once so settled.  Mr Hickery was just the even\r\ndown reverse of this.  He never, to be sure, ran himself into a passion,\r\nbut then he continued to speak and argue so long in reply, never heeding\r\nthe most rational things of his adversaries, that he was sure to put\r\nevery other person in a rage; in addition to all which, he was likewise a\r\nsorrowful body in never being able to understand how a determination by\r\nvote ought to and did put an end to every questionable proceeding; so\r\nthat he was, for a constancy, ever harping about the last subject\r\ndiscussed, as if it had not been decided, until a new difference of\r\nopinion arose, and necessitated him to change the burden and o'ercome of\r\nhis wearysome speeches.\r\n\r\nIt may seem remarkable that we should have taken such a plague into the\r\ncouncil, and be thought that we were well served for our folly; but we\r\nwere unacquaint with the character of the man--for although a native of\r\nthe town, he was in truth a stranger, having, at an early age, espoused\r\nhis fortune, and gone to Philadelphia in America; and no doubt his argol-\r\nbargolous disposition was an inheritance accumulated with his other\r\nconquest of wealth from the mannerless Yankees.  Coming home and settling\r\namong us, with a power of money, (some said eleven thousand pounds,) a\r\nshort time before Mr Hirple departed this life, we all thought, on that\r\nevent happening, it would be a very proper compliment to take Mr Hickery\r\ninto the council, and accordingly we were so misfortunate as to do so;\r\nbut I trow we soon had reason to repent our indiscretion, and none more\r\nthan myself, who had first proposed him.\r\n\r\nMr Hickery having been chosen to supply the void caused by the death of\r\nMr Hirple, in the very first sederunt of the council after his election,\r\nhe kithed in his true colours.\r\n\r\nAmong other things that I had contemplated for the ornament and\r\nedification of the burgh, was the placing up of lamps to light the\r\nstreets, such as may be seen in all well regulated cities and towns of\r\nany degree.  Having spoken of this patriotic project to several of my\r\ncolleagues, who all highly approved of the same, I had no jealousy or\r\nsuspicion that a design so clearly and luminously useful would meet with\r\nany other opposition than, may be, some doubt as to the fiscal abilities\r\nof our income.  To be sure Mr Dribbles, who at that time kept the head\r\ninns, and was in the council, said, with a wink, that it might be found\r\nan inconvenience to sober folk that happened, on an occasion now and\r\nthen, to be an hour later than usual among their friends, either at his\r\nhouse or any other, to be shown by the lamps to the profane populace as\r\nthey were making the best of their way home; and Mr Dippings, the\r\ncandlemaker, with less public spirit than might have been expected from\r\none who made such a penny by the illuminations on news of victory, was of\r\nopinion that lamps would only encourage the commonality to keep late\r\nhours; and that the gentry were in no need of any thing of the sort,\r\nhaving their own handsome glass lanterns, with two candles in them,\r\ngarnished and adorned with clippit paper; an equipage which he prophesied\r\nwould soon wear out of fashion when lamps were once introduced, and the\r\nwhich prediction I have lived to see verified; for certainly, now-a-days,\r\nexcept when some elderly widow lady, or maiden gentlewoman, wanting the\r\nhelp and protection of man, happens to be out at her tea and supper, a\r\ntight and snod serving lassie, with a three-cornered glass lantern, is\r\nnever seen on the causey.  But, to return from this digression; saving\r\nand excepting the remarks of Mr Dribbles and Mr Dippings, and neither of\r\nthem could be considered as made in a sincere frame of mind, I had no\r\nforetaste of any opposition.  I was, therefore, but ill prepared for the\r\nworrying argument with which Mr Hickery seized upon the scheme, asserting\r\nand maintaining, among other apparatus-like reasoning, that in such a\r\nnorthern climate as that of Scotland, and where the twilight was of such\r\nlong duration, it would be a profligate waste of the public money to\r\nemploy it on any thing so little required as lamps were in our streets.\r\n\r\nHe had come home from America in the summer time, and I reminded him,\r\nthat it certainly could never be the intention of the magistrates to\r\nlight the lamps all the year round; but that in the winter there was a\r\ngreat need of them; for in our northern climate the days were then very\r\nshort, as he would soon experience, and might probably recollect.  But\r\nnever, surely, was such an endless man created.  For, upon this, he\r\nimmediately rejoined, that the streets would be much more effectually\r\nlighted, than by all the lamps I proposed to put up, were the inhabitants\r\nordered to sit with their window-shutters open.  I really did not know\r\nwhat answer to make to such a proposal, but I saw it would never do to\r\nargue with him; so I held my tongue quietly, and as soon as possible, on\r\na pretence of private business, left the meeting, not a little mortified\r\nto find such a contrary spirit had got in among us.\r\n\r\nAfter that meeting of the council, I went cannily round to all the other\r\nmembers, and represented to them, one by one, how proper it was that the\r\nlamps should be set up, both for a credit to the town, and as a\r\nconformity to the fashion of the age in every other place.  And I took\r\noccasion to descant, at some length, on the untractable nature of Mr\r\nHickery, and how it would be proper before the next meeting to agree to\r\nsay nothing when the matter was again brought on the carpet, but just to\r\ncome to the vote at once.  Accordingly this was done, but it made no\r\ndifference to Mr Hickery; on the contrary, he said, in a vehement manner,\r\nthat he was sure there must be some corrupt understanding among us,\r\notherwise a matter of such importance could not have been decided by a\r\nsilent vote; and at every session of the council, till some new matter of\r\ndifference cast up, he continued cuckooing about the lamp-job, as he\r\ncalled it, till he had sickened every body out of all patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII--THE PLAINSTONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first question that changed the bark of Mr Hickery, was my proposal\r\nfor the side plainstones of the high street.  In the new paving of the\r\ncrown of the causey, some years before, the rise in the middle had been\r\nlevelled to an equality with the side loans, and in disposing of the lamp-\r\nposts, it was thought advantageous to place them halfway from the houses\r\nand the syvers, between the loans and the crown of the causey, which had\r\nthe effect at night, of making the people who were wont, in their travels\r\nand visitations, to keep the middle of the street, to diverge into the\r\nspace and path between the lamp-posts and the houses.  This, especially\r\nin wet weather, was attended with some disadvantages; for the pavement,\r\nclose to the houses, was not well laid, and there being then no ronns to\r\nthe houses, at every other place, particularly where the nepus-gables\r\nwere towards the streets, the rain came gushing in a spout, like as if\r\nthe windows of heaven were opened.  And, in consequence, it began to be\r\nfreely conversed, that there would be a great comfort in having the sides\r\nof the streets paved with flags, like the plainstones of Glasgow, and\r\nthat an obligation should be laid on the landlords, to put up ronns to\r\nkepp the rain, and to conduct the water down in pipes by the sides of the\r\nhouses;--all which furnished Mr Hickery with fresh topics for his\r\nfasherie about the lamps, and was, as he said, proof and demonstration of\r\nthat most impolitic, corrupt, and short-sighted job, the consequences of\r\nwhich would reach, in the shape of some new tax, every ramification of\r\nsociety;--with divers other American argumentatives to the same effect.\r\nHowever, in process of time, by a judicious handling and the help of an\r\nadvantageous free grassum, which we got for some of the town lands from\r\nMr Shuttlethrift the manufacturer, who was desirous to build a\r\nvilla-house, we got the flagstone part of the project accomplished, and\r\nthe landlords gradually, of their own free-will, put up the ronns, by\r\nwhich the town has been greatly improved and convenienced.\r\n\r\nBut new occasions call for new laws; the side pavement, concentrating the\r\npeople, required to be kept cleaner, and in better order, than when the\r\nwhole width of the street was in use; so that the magistrates were\r\nconstrained to make regulations concerning the same, and to enact fines\r\nand penalties against those who neglected to scrape and wash the\r\nplainstones forenent their houses, and to denounce, in the strictest\r\nterms, the emptying of improper utensils on the same; and this, until the\r\npeople had grown into the habitude of attending to the rules, gave rise\r\nto many pleas, and contentious appeals and bickerings, before the\r\nmagistrates.  Among others summoned before me for default, was one Mrs\r\nFenton, commonly called the Tappit-hen, who kept a small change-house,\r\nnot of the best repute, being frequented by young men, of a station of\r\nlife that gave her heart and countenance to be bardy, even to the\r\nbailies.  It happened that, by some inattention, she had, one frosty\r\nmorning, neglected to soop her flags, and old Miss Peggy Dainty being\r\nearly afoot, in passing her door committed a false step, by treading on a\r\nbit of a lemon's skin, and her heels flying up, down she fell on her\r\nback, at full length, with a great cloyt.  Mrs Fenton, hearing the\r\naccident, came running to the door, and seeing the exposure that perjink\r\nMiss Peggy had made of herself, put her hands to her sides, and laughed\r\nfor some time as if she was by herself.  Miss Peggy, being sorely hurt in\r\nthe hinder parts, summoned Mrs Fenton before me, where the whole affair,\r\nboth as to what was seen and heard, was so described, with name and\r\nsurname, that I could not keep my composure.  It was, however, made\r\nmanifest, that Mrs Fenton had offended the law, in so much, as her flags\r\nhad not been swept that morning; and therefore, to appease the offended\r\ndelicacy of Miss Peggy, who was a most respectable lady in single life, I\r\nfined the delinquent five shillings.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Pawkie,\" said the latheron, \"I'll no pay't.  Whar do ye expeck a\r\nwidow woman like me can get five shillings for ony sic nonsense?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye must not speak in that manner, honest woman,\" was my reply; \"but just\r\npay the fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"In deed and truth, Mr Pawkie,\" quo she, \"it's ill getting a breek off a\r\nhighlandman.  I'll pay no sic thing--five shillings--that's a story!\"\r\n\r\nI thought I would have been constrained to send her to prison, the woman\r\ngrew so bold and contumacious, when Mr Hickery came in, and hearing what\r\nwas going forward, was evidently working himself up to take the randy's\r\npart; but fortunately she had a suspicion that all the town-council and\r\nmagistrates were in league against her, on account of the repute of her\r\nhouse, so that when he enquired of her where she lived, with a view, as I\r\nsuspect, of interceding, she turned to him, and with a leer and a laugh,\r\nsaid, \"Dear me, Mr Hickery, I'm sure ye hae nae need to speer that!\"\r\n\r\nThe insinuation set up his birses; but she bamboozled him with her\r\nbanter, and raised such a laugh against him, that he was fairly driven\r\nfrom the council room, and I was myself obliged to let her go, without\r\nexacting the fine.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought that this affair was to prove to me the means of\r\nan easy riddance of Mr Hickery?  But so it turned out; for whether or not\r\nthere was any foundation for the traffickings with him which she\r\npretended, he never could abide to hear the story alluded to, which, when\r\nI discerned, I took care, whenever he showed any sort of inclination to\r\nmolest the council with his propugnacity, to joke him about his bonny\r\nsweetheart, \"the Tappit-hen,\" and he instantly sang dumb, and quietly\r\nslipped away; by which it may be seen how curiously events come to pass,\r\nsince, out of the very first cause of his thwarting me in the lamps, I\r\nfound, in process of time, a way of silencing him far better than any\r\nsort of truth or reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII--THE SECOND CROP OF VOLUNTEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already related, at full length, many of the particulars anent the\r\nelecting of the first set of volunteers; the which, by being germinated\r\npartly under the old system of public intromission, was done with more\r\nmanagement and slight of art than the second.  This, however, I will ever\r\nmaintain, was not owing to any greater spirit of corruption; but only and\r\nsolely to following the ancient dexterous ways, that had been, in a\r\nmanner, engrained with the very nature of every thing pertaining to the\r\nrepresentation of government as it existed, not merely in burgh towns,\r\nbut wheresoever the crown and ministers found it expedient to have their\r\nlion's paw.\r\n\r\nMatters were brought to a bearing differently, when, in the second\r\nedition of the late war, it was thought necessary to call on the people\r\nto resist the rampageous ambition of Bonaparte, then champing and\r\ntrampling for the rich pastures of our national commonwealth.\r\nAccordingly, I kept myself aloof from all handling in the pecuniaries of\r\nthe business; but I lent a friendly countenance to every feasible project\r\nthat was likely to strengthen the confidence of the king in the loyalty\r\nand bravery of his people.  For by this time I had learnt, that there was\r\na wake-rife common sense abroad among the opinions of men; and that the\r\nsecret of the new way of ruling the world was to follow, not to control,\r\nthe evident dictates of the popular voice; and I soon had reason to\r\nfelicitate myself on this prudent and seasonable discovery.  For it won\r\nme great reverence among the forward young men, who started up at the\r\ncall of their country; and their demeanour towards me was as tokens and\r\narles, from the rising generation, of being continued in respect and\r\nauthority by them.  Some of my colleagues, who are as well not named, by\r\nmaking themselves over busy, got but small thank for their pains.  I was\r\neven preferred to the provost, as the medium of communicating the\r\nsentiments of the volunteering lads to the lord-lieutenant; and their\r\ncause did not suffer in my hands, for his lordship had long been in the\r\nhabit of considering me as one of the discreetest men in the burgh; and\r\nalthough he returned very civil answers to all letters, he wrote to me in\r\nthe cordial erudition of an old friend--a thing which the volunteers soon\r\ndiscerned, and respected me accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiering zeal being spontaneous among all ranks, and breaking\r\nforth into ablaze without any pre-ordered method, some of the magistrates\r\nwere disconcerted, and wist not what to do.  I'll no take it upon me to\r\nsay that they were altogether guided by a desire to have a finger in the\r\npie, either in the shape of the honours of command or the profits of\r\ncontract.  This, however, is certain, that they either felt or feigned a\r\ngreat alarm and consternation at seeing such a vast military power in\r\ncivil hands, over which they had no natural control; and, as was said,\r\nindependent of the crown and parliament.  Another thing there could be no\r\ndoubt of: in the frame of this fear they remonstrated with the\r\ngovernment, and counselled the ministers to throw a wet blanket on the\r\nardour of the volunteering, which, it is well known, was very readily\r\ndone; for the ministers, on seeing such a pressing forward to join the\r\nbanners of the kingdom, had a dread and regard to the old leaven of\r\nJacobinism, and put a limitation on the number of the armed men that were\r\nto be allowed to rise in every place--a most ill-advised prudence, as was\r\nmade manifest by what happened among us, of which I will now rehearse the\r\nparticulars, and the part I had in it myself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was understood among the commonality that the French were\r\ndetermined to subdue and make a conquest of Britain, as they had done of\r\nall the rest of Europe, holding the noses of every continental king and\r\npotentate to the grindstone, there was a prodigious stir and motion in\r\nall the hearts and pulses of Scotland, and no where in a more vehement\r\ndegree than in Gudetown.  But, for some reason or an other which I could\r\nnever dive into the bottom of, there was a slackness or backwardness on\r\nthe part of government in sending instructions to the magistrates to step\r\nforward; in so much that the people grew terrified that they would be\r\nconquered, without having even an opportunity to defend, as their fathers\r\ndid of old, the hallowed things of their native land; and, under the\r\nsense of this alarm, they knotted themselves together, and actually drew\r\nout proposals and resolutions of service of their own accord; by which\r\nmeans they kept the power of choosing their officers in their own hands,\r\nand so gave many of the big-wigs of the town a tacit intimation that they\r\nwere not likely to have the command.\r\n\r\nWhile things were in this process, the government had come to its senses;\r\nand some steps and measures were taken to organize volunteer corps\r\nthroughout the nation.  Taking heart from them, other corps were proposed\r\non the part of the gentry, in which they were themselves to have the\r\ncommand; and seeing that the numbers were to be limited, they had a wish\r\nand interest to keep back the real volunteer offers, and to get their own\r\naccepted in their stead.  A suspicion of this sort getting vent, an\r\noutcry of discontent thereat arose against them; and to the consternation\r\nof the magistrates, the young lads, who had at the first come so briskly\r\nforward, called a meeting of their body, and, requesting the magistrates\r\nto be present, demanded to know what steps had been taken with their\r\noffer of service; and, if transmitted to government, what answer had been\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThis was a new era in public affairs; and no little amazement and anger\r\nwas expressed by some of the town-council, that any set of persons should\r\ndare to question and interfere with the magistrates.  But I saw it would\r\nnever do to take the bull by the horns in that manner at such a time; so\r\nI commenced with Bailie Sprose, my lord being at the time provost, and\r\nearnestly beseeched him to attend the meeting with me, and to give a mild\r\nanswer to any questions that might be put; and this was the more\r\nnecessary, as there was some good reason to believe, that, in point of\r\nfact, the offer of service had been kept back.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly went to the meeting, where Mr Sprose, at my suggestion,\r\nstated, that we had received no answer; and that we could not explain how\r\nthe delay had arisen.  This, however, did not pacify the volunteers; but\r\nthey appointed certain of their own number, a committee, to attend to the\r\nbusiness, and to communicate with the secretary of state direct;\r\nintimating, that the members of the committee were those whom they\r\nintended to elect for their officers.  This was a decisive step, and took\r\nthe business entirely out of the hands of the magistrates; so, after the\r\nmeeting, both Mr Sprose and myself agreed, that no time should be lost in\r\ncommunicating to the lord-lieutenant what had taken place.\r\n\r\nOur letter, and the volunteers' letter, went by the same post; and on\r\nreceiving ours, the lord-lieutenant had immediately some conference with\r\nthe secretary of state, who, falling into the views of his lordship, in\r\npreferring the offers of the corps proposed by the gentry, sent the\r\nvolunteers word in reply, that their services, on the terms they had\r\nproposed, which were of the least possible expense to government, could\r\nnot be accepted.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that this answer would have ended the matter; but there were\r\ncertain propugnacious spirits in the volunteers' committee; and they\r\nurged and persuaded the others to come into resolutions, to the effect\r\nthat, having made early offers of service, on terms less objectionable in\r\nevery point than those of many offers subsequently made and accepted,\r\nunless their offer was accepted, they would consider themselves as having\r\nthe authority of his majesty's government to believe and to represent,\r\nthat there was, in truth, no reason to apprehend that the enemy meditated\r\nany invasion and these resolutions they sent off to London forthwith,\r\nbefore the magistrates had time to hear or to remonstrate against the use\r\nof such novel language from our burgh to his majesty's ministers.\r\n\r\nWe, however, heard something; and I wrote my lord, to inform him that the\r\nvolunteers had renewed their offer, (for so we understood their\r\nrepresentation was;) and he, from what he had heard before from the\r\nsecretary of state, not expecting the effect it would have, answered me,\r\nthat their offer could not be accepted.  But to our astonishment, by the\r\nsame post, the volunteers found themselves accepted, and the gentlemen\r\nthey recommended for their officers gazetted; the which, as I tell\r\nfrankly, was an admonition to me, that the peremptory will of authority\r\nwas no longer sufficient for the rule of mankind; and, therefore, I\r\nsquared my after conduct more by a deference to public opinion, than by\r\nany laid down maxims and principles of my own; the consequence of which\r\nwas, that my influence still continued to grow and gather strength in the\r\ncommunity, and I was enabled to accomplish many things that my\r\npredecessors would have thought it was almost beyond the compass of man\r\nto undertake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX--CAPTAIN ARMOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of these notandums, I have, here and there, touched on\r\ndivers matters that did not actually pertain to my own magisterial life,\r\nfurther than as showing the temper and spirit in which different things\r\nwere brought to a bearing; and, in the same way, I will now again step\r\naside from the regular course of public affairs, to record an occurrence\r\nwhich, at the time, excited no small wonderment and sympathy, and in\r\nwhich it was confessed by many that I performed a very judicious part.\r\nThe event here spoken of, was the quartering in the town, after the\r\nremoval of that well-behaved regiment, the Argyle fencibles, the main\r\npart of another, the name and number of which I do not now recollect; but\r\nit was an English corps, and, like the other troops of that nation, was\r\nnot then brought into the sobriety of discipline to which the whole\r\nBritish army has since been reduced, by the paternal perseverance of his\r\nRoyal Highness the Duke of York; so that, after the douce and respectful\r\nHighlanders, we sorely felt the consequences of the outstropolous and\r\ngalravitching Englishers, who thought it no disgrace to fill themselves\r\nas fou as pipers, and fight in the streets, and march to the church on\r\nthe Lord's day with their band of music.  However, after the first\r\nSunday, upon a remonstrance on the immorality of such irreligious\r\nbravery, Colonel Cavendish, the commandant, silenced the musicians.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers, there was one Captain Armour, an extraordinar well\r\ndemeaned, handsome man, who was very shy of accepting any civility from\r\nthe town gentry, and kept himself aloof from all our ploys and\r\nentertainments, in such a manner, that the rest of the officers talked of\r\nhim, marvelling at the cause, for it was not his wont in other places.\r\n\r\nOne Sabbath, during the remembering prayer, Mr Pittle put up a few words\r\nfor criminals under sentence of death, there being two at the time in the\r\nAyr jail, at the which petition I happened to look at Captain Armour,\r\nwho, with the lave of the officers, were within the magistrates' loft,\r\nand I thought he had, at the moment, a likeness to poor Jeanie Gaisling,\r\nthat was executed for the murder of her bastard bairn.\r\n\r\nThis notion at the time disturbed me very much, and one thought after\r\nanother so came into my head, that I could pay no attention to Mr Pittle,\r\nwho certainly was but a cauldrife preacher, and never more so than on\r\nthat day.  In short, I was haunted with the fancy, that Captain Armour\r\nwas no other than the misfortunate lassie's poor brother, who had in so\r\npathetical a manner attended her and the magistrates to the scaffold;\r\nand, what was very strange, I was not the only one in the kirk who\r\nthought the same thing; for the resemblance, while Mr Pittle was praying,\r\nhad been observed by many; and it was the subject of discourse in my shop\r\non the Monday following, when the whole history of that most sorrowful\r\nconcern was again brought to mind.  But, without dwelling at large on the\r\nparticularities, I need only mention, that it began to be publicly\r\njealoused that he was indeed the identical lad, which moved every body;\r\nfor he was a very good and gallant officer, having risen by his own\r\nmerits, and was likewise much beloved in the regiment.  Nevertheless,\r\nthough his sister's sin was no fault of his, and could not impair the\r\nworth of his well-earned character, yet some of the thoughtless young\r\nensigns began to draw off from him, and he was visited, in a manner, with\r\nthe disgrace of an excommunication.\r\n\r\nBeing, however, a sensible man, he bore it for a while patiently, may be\r\nhoping that the suspicion would wear away; but my lord, with all his\r\nretinue, coming from London to the castle for the summer, invited the\r\nofficers one day to dine with him and the countess, when the fact was\r\nestablished by a very simple accident.\r\n\r\nCaptain Armour, in going up the stairs, and along the crooked old\r\npassages of the castle, happened to notice that the colonel, who was in\r\nthe van, turned to the wrong hand, and called to him to take the other\r\nway, which circumstance convinced all present that he was domestically\r\nfamiliar with the labyrinths of the building; and the consequence was,\r\nthat, during dinner, not one of the officers spoke to him, some from\r\nembarrassment and others from pride.\r\n\r\nThe earl perceiving their demeanour, enquired of the colonel, when they\r\nhad returned from the table to the drawing-room, as to the cause of such\r\na visible alienation, and Colonel Cavendish, who was much of the\r\ngentleman, explaining it, expressing his grief that so unpleasant a\r\ndiscovery had been made to the prejudice of so worthy a man, my lord was\r\nobserved to stand some time in a thoughtful posture, after which he went\r\nand spoke in a whisper to the countess, who advised him, as her ladyship\r\nin the sequel told me herself, to send for me, as a wary and prudent man.\r\nAccordingly a servant was secretly dispatched express to the town on that\r\nerrand; my lord and my lady insisting on the officers staying to spend\r\nthe evening with them, which was an unusual civility at the _pro forma_\r\ndinners at the castle.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, the earl took me into his private library, and we had\r\nsome serious conversation about the captain's sister; and, when I had\r\nrelated the circumstantialities of her end to him, he sent for the\r\ncaptain, and with great tenderness, and a manner most kind and gracious,\r\ntold him what he had noticed in the conduct of the officers, offering his\r\nmediation to appease any difference, if it was a thing that could be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWhile my lord was speaking, the captain preserved a steady and unmoved\r\ncountenance: no one could have imagined that he was listening to any\r\nthing but some grave generality of discourse; but when the earl offered\r\nto mediate, his breast swelled, and his face grew like his coat, and I\r\nsaw his eyes fill with water as he turned round, to hide the grief that\r\ncould not be stifled.  The passion of shame, however, lasted but for a\r\nmoment.  In less time than I am in writing these heads, he was again\r\nhimself, and with a modest fortitude that was exceedingly comely, he\r\nacknowledged who he was, adding, that he feared his blameless disgrace\r\nentailed effects which he could not hope to remove, and therefore it was\r\nhis intention to resign his commission.  The earl, however, requested\r\nthat he would do nothing rashly, and that he should first allow him to\r\ntry what could be done to convince his brother officers that it was\r\nunworthy of them to act towards him in the way they did.  His lordship\r\nthen led us to the drawing-room, on entering which, he said aloud to the\r\ncountess in a manner that could not be misunderstood, \"In Captain Armour\r\nI have discovered an old acquaintance, who by his own merits, and under\r\ncircumstances that would have sunk any man less conscious of his own\r\npurity and worth, has raised himself, from having once been my servant,\r\nto a rank that makes me happy to receive him as my guest.\"\r\n\r\nI need not add, that this benevolence of his lordship was followed with a\r\nmost bountiful alteration towards the captain from all present, in so\r\nmuch that, before the regiment was removed from the town, we had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing him at divers of the town-ploys, where he received\r\nevery civility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX--THE TRADES' BALL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of my second provostry, or rather, as I think, after it\r\nwas over, an accident happened in the town that might have led to no\r\nlittle trouble and contention but for the way and manner that I managed\r\nthe same.  My friend and neighbour, Mr Kilsyth, an ettling man, who had\r\nbeen wonderful prosperous in the spirit line, having been taken on for a\r\nbailie, by virtue of some able handling on the part of Deacon Kenitweel,\r\nproposed and propounded, that there should be a ball and supper for the\r\ntrades; and to testify his sense of the honour that he owed to all the\r\ncrafts, especially the wrights, whereof Mr Kenitweel was then deacon, he\r\npromised to send in both wine, rum, and brandy, from his cellar, for the\r\ncompany.  I did not much approve of the project, for divers reasons; the\r\nprincipal of which was, because my daughters were grown into young\r\nladies, and I was, thank God, in a circumstance to entitle them to hold\r\ntheir heads something above the trades.  However, I could not positively\r\nrefuse my compliance, especially as Mrs Pawkie was requested by Bailie\r\nKilsyth, and those who took an active part in furtherance of the ploy, to\r\nbe the lady directress of the occasion.  And, out of an honour and homage\r\nto myself, I was likewise entreated to preside at the head of the table,\r\nover the supper that was to ensue after the dancing.\r\n\r\nIn its own nature, there was surely nothing of an objectionable\r\nprinciple, in a \"trades' ball;\" but we had several young men of the\r\ngentle sort about the town, blythe and rattling lads, who were welcome\r\nboth to high and low, and to whom the project seemed worthy of a\r\nridicule.  It would, as I said at the time, have been just as well to\r\nhave made it really a trades' ball, without any adulteration of the\r\ngentry; but the hempies alluded to jouked themselves in upon us, and\r\nobligated the managers to invite them; and an ill return they made for\r\nthis discretion and civility, as I have to relate.\r\n\r\nOn the nightset for the occasion, the company met in the assembly-room,\r\nin the New-inns, where we had bespoke a light genteel supper, and had\r\nM'Lachlan, the fiddler, over from Ayr, for the purpose.  Nothing could be\r\nbetter while the dancing lasted; the whole concern wore an appearance of\r\nthe greatest genteelity.  But when supper was announced, and the company\r\nadjourned to partake of it, judge of the universal consternation that was\r\nvisible in every countenance, when, instead of the light tarts, and nice\r\njellies and sillybobs that were expected, we beheld a long table, with a\r\nrow down the middle of rounds of beef, large cold veal-pies on pewter\r\nplates like tea-trays, cold boiled turkeys, and beef and bacon hams, and,\r\nfor ornament in the middle, a perfect stack of celery.\r\n\r\nThe instant I entered the supper-room, I saw there had been a plot: poor\r\nBailie Kilsyth, who had all the night been in triumph and glory, was for\r\na season speechless; and when at last he came to himself, he was like to\r\nhave been the death of the landlord on the spot; while I could remark,\r\nwith the tail of my eye, that secret looks of a queer satisfaction were\r\nexchanged among the beaux before mentioned.  This observe, when I made\r\nit, led me to go up to the bailie as he was storming at the bribed and\r\ncorrupt innkeeper, and to say to him, that if he would leave the matter\r\nto me, I would settle it to the content of all present; which he,\r\nslackening the grip he had taken of the landlord by the throat, instantly\r\nconceded.  Whereupon, I went back to the head of the table, and said\r\naloud, \"that the cold collection had been provided by some secret\r\nfriends, and although it was not just what the directors could have\r\nwished, yet it would be as well to bring to mind the old proverb, which\r\ninstructs us no to be particular about the mouth of a gi'en horse.\"  But\r\nI added, \"before partaking thereof, wel'll hae in our bill frae the\r\nlandlord, and settle it,\"--and it was called accordingly.  I could\r\ndiscern, that this was a turn that the conspirators did not look for.  It,\r\nhowever, put the company a thought into spirits, and they made the best\r\no't.  But, while they were busy at the table, I took a canny opportunity\r\nof saying, under the rose to one of the gentlemen, \"that I saw through\r\nthe joke, and could relish it just as well as the plotters; but as the\r\nthing was so plainly felt as an insult by the generality of the company,\r\nthe less that was said about it the better; and that if the whole bill,\r\nincluding the cost of Bailie Kilsyth's wine and spirits, was defrayed, I\r\nwould make no enquiries, and the authors might never be known.\"  This\r\nadmonishment was not lost, for by-and-by, I saw the gentleman confabbing\r\ntogether; and the next morning, through the post, I received a twenty-\r\npound note in a nameless letter, requesting the amount of it to be placed\r\nagainst the expense of the ball.  I was overly well satisfied with this\r\nto say a great deal of what I thought, but I took a quiet step to the\r\nbank, where, expressing some doubt of the goodness of the note, I was\r\ninformed it was perfectly good, and had been that very day issued from\r\nthe bank to one of the gentlemen, whom, even at this day, it would not be\r\nprudent to expose to danger by naming.\r\n\r\nUpon a consultation with the other gentlemen, who had the management of\r\nthe ball, it was agreed, that we should say nothing of the gift of twenty\r\npounds, but distribute it in the winter to needful families, which was\r\ndone; for we feared that the authors of the derision would be found out,\r\nand that ill-blood might be bred in the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI--THE BAILIE'S HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nBut although in the main I was considered by the events and transactions\r\nalready rehearsed, a prudent and sagacious man, yet I was not free from\r\nthe consequences of envy.  To be sure, they were not manifested in any\r\nvery intolerant spirit, and in so far they caused me rather molestation\r\nof mind than actual suffering; but still they kithed in evil, and thereby\r\nmarred the full satisfactory fruition of my labours and devices.  Among\r\nother of the outbreakings alluded to that not a little vexed me, was one\r\nthat I will relate, and just in order here to show the animus of men's\r\nminds towards me.\r\n\r\nWe had in the town a clever lad, with a geni of a mechanical turn, who\r\nmade punch-bowls of leather, and legs for cripples of the same commodity,\r\nthat were lighter and easier to wear than either legs of cork or timber.\r\nHis name was Geordie Sooplejoint, a modest, douce, and well-behaved young\r\nman--caring for little else but the perfecting of his art.  I had heard\r\nof his talent, and was curious to converse with him; so I spoke to Bailie\r\nPirlet, who had taken him by the hand, to bring him and his leather punch-\r\nbowl, and some of his curious legs and arms, to let me see them; the\r\nwhich the bailie did, and it happened that while they were with me, in\r\ncame Mr Thomas M'Queerie, a dry neighbour at a joke.\r\n\r\nAfter some generality of discourse concerning the inventions, whereon\r\nBailie Pirlet, who was naturally a gabby prick-me-dainty body, enlarged\r\nat great length, with all his well dockit words, as if they were on\r\nchandler's pins, pointing out here the utility of the legs to persons\r\nmaimed in the wars of their country, and showing forth there in what\r\nmanner the punch-bowls were specimens of a new art that might in time\r\nsupplant both China and Staffordshire ware, and deducing therefrom the\r\nbenefits that would come out of it to the country at large, and\r\nespecially to the landed interest, in so much as the increased demand\r\nwhich it would cause for leather, would raise the value of hides, and per\r\nconsequence the price of black cattle--to all which Mr M'Queerie listened\r\nwith a shrewd and a thirsty ear; and when the bailie had made an end of\r\nhis paternoster, he proposed that I should make a filling of Geordie's\r\nbowl, to try if it did not leak.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Mr Pawkie,\" quo' he, \"it will be a great credit to our town to\r\nhae had the merit o' producing sic a clever lad, who, as the bailie has\r\nin a manner demonstrated, is ordained to bring about an augmentation o'\r\ntrade by his punch-bowls, little short of what has been done wi' the\r\nsteam-engines.  Geordie will be to us what James Watt is to the ettling\r\ntown of Greenook, so we can do no less than drink prosperity to his\r\nendeavours.\"\r\n\r\nI did not much like this bantering of Mr M'Queerie, for I saw it made\r\nGeordie's face grow red, and it was not what he had deserved; so to\r\nrepress it, and to encourage the poor lad, I said, \"Come, come,\r\nneighbour, none of your wipes--what Geordie has done, is but arles of\r\nwhat he may do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no to be debated,\" replied Mr M'Queerie, \"for he has shown\r\nalready that he can make very good legs and arms; and I'm sure I shouldna\r\nbe surprised were he in time to make heads as good as a bailie's.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw any mortal man look as that pernickity personage, the bailie,\r\ndid at this joke, but I suppressed my own feelings; while the bailie,\r\nlike a bantam cock in a passion, stotted out of his chair with the spunk\r\nof a birslet pea, demanding of Mr M'Queerie an explanation of what he\r\nmeant by the insinuation.  It was with great difficulty that I got him\r\npacified; but unfortunately the joke was oure good to be forgotten, and\r\nwhen it was afterwards spread abroad, as it happened to take its birth in\r\nmy house, it was laid to my charge, and many a time was I obligated to\r\ntell all about it, and how it couldna be meant for me, but had been\r\nincurred by Bailie Pirlet's conceit of spinning out long perjink\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII--THE TOWN DRUMMER\r\n\r\n\r\nNor did I get every thing my own way, for I was often thwarted in matters\r\nof small account, and suffered from them greater disturbance and\r\nmolestation than things of such little moment ought to have been allowed\r\nto produce within me; and I do not think that any thing happened in the\r\nwhole course of my public life, which gave me more vexation than what I\r\nfelt in the last week of my second provostry.\r\n\r\nFor many a year, one Robin Boss had been town drummer; he was a relic of\r\nsome American-war fencibles, and was, to say the God's truth of him, a\r\ndivor body, with no manner of conduct, saving a very earnest endeavour to\r\nfill himself fou as often as he could get the means; the consequence of\r\nwhich was, that his face was as plooky as a curran' bun, and his nose as\r\nred as a partan's tae.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon there was a need to send out a proclamation to abolish a\r\npractice that was growing into a custom, in some of the bye parts of the\r\ntown, of keeping swine at large--ordering them to be confined in proper\r\nstyes, and other suitable places.  As on all occasions when the matter to\r\nbe proclaimed was from the magistrates, Thomas, on this, was attended by\r\nthe town-officers in their Sunday garbs, and with their halberts in their\r\nhands; but the abominable and irreverent creature was so drunk, that he\r\nwamblet to and fro over the drum, as if there had not been a bane in his\r\nbody.  He was seemingly as soople and as senseless as a bolster.--Still,\r\nas this was no new thing with him, it might have passed; for James Hound,\r\nthe senior officer, was in the practice, when Robin was in that state, of\r\nreading the proclamations himself.--On this occasion, however, James\r\nhappened to be absent on some hue and cry quest, and another of the\r\nofficers (I forget which) was appointed to perform for him.  Robin,\r\naccustomed to James, no sooner heard the other man begin to read, than he\r\nbegan to curse and swear at him as an incapable nincompoop--an\r\nimpertinent term that he was much addicted to.  The grammar school was at\r\nthe time skailing, and the boys seeing the stramash, gathered round the\r\nofficer, and yelling and shouting, encouraged Robin more and more into\r\nrebellion, till at last they worked up his corruption to such a pitch,\r\nthat he took the drum from about his neck, and made it fly like a\r\nbombshell at the officer's head.\r\n\r\nThe officers behaved very well, for they dragged Robin by the lug and the\r\nhorn to the tolbooth, and then came with their complaint to me.  Seeing\r\nhow the authorities had been set at nought, and the necessity there was\r\nof making an example, I forthwith ordered Robin to be cashiered from the\r\nservice of the town; and as so important a concern as a proclamation\r\nought not to be delayed, I likewise, upon the spot, ordered the officers\r\nto take a lad that had been also a drummer in a marching regiment, and go\r\nwith him to make the proclamation.\r\n\r\nNothing could be done in a more earnest and zealous public spirit than\r\nthis was done by me.  But habit had begot in the town a partiality for\r\nthe drunken ne'er-do-well, Robin; and this just act of mine was\r\nimmediately condemned as a daring stretch of arbitrary power; and the\r\nconsequence was, that when the council met next day, some sharp words\r\nflew from among us, as to my usurping an undue authority; and the thank I\r\ngot for my pains was the mortification to see the worthless body restored\r\nto full power and dignity, with no other reward than an admonition to\r\nbehave better for the future.  Now, I leave it to the unbiassed judgment\r\nof posterity to determine if any public man could be more ungraciously\r\ntreated by his colleagues than I was on this occasion.  But, verily, the\r\ncouncil had their reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII--AN ALARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe divor, Robin Boss, being, as I have recorded, reinstated in office,\r\nsoon began to play his old tricks.  In the course of the week after the\r\nMichaelmas term at which my second provostry ended, he was so\r\ninsupportably drunk that he fell head foremost into his drum, which cost\r\nthe town five-and-twenty shillings for a new one--an accident that was\r\nnot without some satisfaction to me; and I trow I was not sparing in my\r\nderisive commendations on the worth of such a public officer.\r\nNevertheless, he was still kept on, some befriending him for compassion,\r\nand others as it were to spite me.\r\n\r\nBut Robin's good behaviour did not end with breaking the drum, and\r\ncosting a new one.--In the course of the winter it was his custom to\r\nbeat, \"Go to bed, Tom,\" about ten o'clock at night, and the reveille at\r\nfive in the morning.--In one of his drunken fits he made a mistake, and\r\ninstead of going his rounds as usual at ten o'clock, he had fallen asleep\r\nin a change house, and waking about the midnight hour in the terror of\r\nsome whisky dream, he seized his drum, and running into the streets,\r\nbegan to strike the fire-beat in the most awful manner.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine clear frosty moonlight, and the hollow sound of the drum\r\nresounded through the silent streets like thunder.--In a moment every\r\nbody was a-foot, and the cry of \"Whar is't? whar's the fire?\" was heard\r\nechoing from all sides.--Robin, quite unconscious that he alone was the\r\ncause of the alarm, still went along beating the dreadful summons.  I\r\nheard the noise and rose; but while I was drawing on my stockings, in the\r\nchair at the bed-head, and telling Mrs Pawkie to compose herself, for our\r\nhouses were all insured, I suddenly recollected that Robin had the night\r\nbefore neglected to go his rounds at ten o'clock as usual, and the\r\nthought came into my head that the alarm might be one of his inebriated\r\nmistakes; so, instead of dressing myself any further, I went to the\r\nwindow, and looked out through the glass, without opening it, for, being\r\nin my night clothes, I was afraid of taking cold.\r\n\r\nThe street was as throng as on a market day, and every face in the\r\nmoonlight was pale with fear.--Men and lads were running with their\r\ncoats, and carrying their breeches in their hands; wives and maidens were\r\nall asking questions at one another, and even lasses were fleeing to and\r\nfro, like water nymphs with urns, having stoups and pails in their\r\nhands.--There was swearing and tearing of men, hoarse with the rage of\r\nimpatience, at the tolbooth, getting out the fire-engine from its stance\r\nunder the stair; and loud and terrible afar off, and over all, came the\r\npeal of alarm from drunken Robin's drum.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely keep my composity when I beheld and heard all this, for\r\nI was soon thoroughly persuaded of the fact.  At last I saw Deacon\r\nGirdwood, the chief advocate and champion of Robin, passing down the\r\ncausey like a demented man, with a red nightcap, and his big-coat on--for\r\nsome had cried that the fire was in his yard.--\"Deacon,\" cried I, opening\r\nthe window, forgetting in the jocularity of the moment the risk I ran\r\nfrom being so naked, \"whar away sae fast, deacon?\"\r\n\r\nThe deacon stopped and said, \"Is't out? is't out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gang your ways home,\" quo' I very coolly, \"for I hae a notion that a'\r\nthis hobleshow's but the fume of a gill in your friend Robin's head.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no possible!\" exclaimed the deacon.\r\n\r\n\"Possible here or possible there, Mr Girdwood,\" quo' I, \"it's oure cauld\r\nfor me to stand talking wi' you here; we'll learn the rights o't in the\r\nmorning; so, good-night;\" and with that I pulled down the window.  But\r\nscarcely had I done so, when a shout of laughter came gathering up the\r\nstreet, and soon after poor drunken Robin was brought along by the cuff\r\nof the neck, between two of the town-officers, one of them carrying his\r\ndrum.  The next day he was put out of office for ever, and folk\r\nrecollecting in what manner I had acted towards him before, the outcry\r\nabout my arbitrary power was forgotten in the blame that was heaped upon\r\nthose who had espoused Robin's cause against me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV--THE COUNTRY GENTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long period of time, I had observed that there was a gradual mixing\r\nin of the country gentry among the town's folks.  This was partly to be\r\nascribed to a necessity rising out of the French Revolution, whereby men\r\nof substance thought it an expedient policy to relax in their ancient\r\nmaxims of family pride and consequence; and partly to the great increase\r\nand growth of wealth which the influx of trade caused throughout the\r\nkingdom, whereby the merchants were enabled to vie and ostentate even\r\nwith the better sort of lairds.  The effect of this, however, was less\r\nprotuberant in our town than in many others which I might well name, and\r\nthe cause thereof lay mainly in our being more given to deal in the small\r\nway; not that we lacked of traders possessed both of purse and\r\nperseverance; but we did not exactly lie in the thoroughfare of those\r\nmighty masses of foreign commodities, the throughgoing of which left, to\r\nuse the words of the old proverb, \"goud in goupins\" with all who had the\r\nhandling of the same.  Nevertheless, we came in for our share of the\r\ncondescensions of the country gentry; and although there was nothing like\r\na melting down of them among us, either by marrying or giving in\r\nmarriage, there was a communion that gave us some insight, no overly to\r\ntheir advantage, as to the extent and measure of their capacities and\r\ntalents.  In short, we discovered that they were vessels made of ordinary\r\nhuman clay; so that, instead of our reverence for them being augmented by\r\na freer intercourse, we thought less and less of them, until, poor\r\nbodies, the bit prideful lairdies were just looked down upon by our\r\ngawsie big-bellied burgesses, not a few of whom had heritable bonds on\r\ntheir estates.  But in this I am speaking of the change when it had come\r\nto a full head; for in verity it must be allowed that when the country\r\ngentry, with their families, began to intromit among us, we could not\r\nmake enough of them.  Indeed, we were deaved about the affability of old\r\ncrabbit Bodle of Bodletonbrae, and his sister, Miss Jenny, when they\r\nfavoured us with their company at the first inspection ball.  I'll ne'er\r\nforgot that occasion; for being then in my second provostry, I had, in\r\ncourse of nature, been appointed a deputy lord-lieutenant, and the town-\r\ncouncil entertaining the inspecting officers, and the officers of the\r\nvolunteers, it fell as a duty incumbent on me to be the director of the\r\nball afterwards, and to the which I sent an invitation to the laird and\r\nhis sister little hoping or expecting they would come.  But the laird,\r\nlikewise being a deputy lord-lieutenant, he accepted the invitation, and\r\ncame with his sister in all the state of pedigree in their power.  Such a\r\nprodigy of old-fashioned grandeur as Miss Jenny was!--but neither shop\r\nnor mantuamaker of our day and generation had been the better o't.  She\r\nwas just, as some of the young lasses said, like Clarissa Harlowe, in the\r\ncuts and copperplates of Mrs Rickerton's set of the book, and an older\r\nand more curious set than Mrs Rickerton's was not in the whole town;\r\nindeed, for that matter, I believe it was the only one among us, and it\r\nhad edified, as Mr Binder the bookseller used to say, at least three\r\nsuccessive generations of young ladies, for he had himself given it twice\r\nnew covers.  We had, however, not then any circulating library.  But for\r\nall her antiquity and lappets, it is not to be supposed what respect and\r\ndeference Miss Jenny and her brother, the laird, received--nor the small\r\npraise that came to my share, for having had the spirit to invite them.\r\nThe ball was spoken of as the genteelest in the memory of man, although\r\nto my certain knowledge, on account of the volunteers, some were there\r\nthat never thought to mess or mell in the same chamber with Bodletonbrae\r\nand his sister, Miss Jenny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV--TESTS OF SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIntending these notations for the instruction of posterity, it would not\r\nbe altogether becoming of me to speak of the domestic effects which many\r\nof the things that I have herein jotted down had in my own family.  I\r\nfeel myself, however, constrained in spirit to lift aside a small bit of\r\nthe private curtain, just to show how Mrs Pawkie comported herself in the\r\nprogressive vicissitudes of our prosperity, in the act and doing of which\r\nI do not wish to throw any slight on her feminine qualities; for, to\r\nspeak of her as she deserves at my hand, she has been a most excellent\r\nwife, and a decent woman, and had aye a ruth and ready hand for the\r\nneedful.  Still, to say the truth, she is not without a few little\r\nweaknesses like her neighbours, and the ill-less vanity of being thought\r\nfar ben with the great is among others of her harmless frailities.\r\n\r\nSoon after the inspection ball before spoken of, she said to me that it\r\nwould be a great benefit and advantage to our family if we could get\r\nBodletonbrae and his sister, and some of the other country gentry, to\r\ndine with us.  I was not very clear about how the benefit was to come to\r\nbook, for the outlay I thought as likely o'ergang the profit; at the same\r\ntime, not wishing to baulk Mrs Pawkie of a ploy on which I saw her mind\r\nwas bent, I gave my consent to her and my daughters to send out the\r\ncards, and make the necessary preparations.  But herein I should not take\r\ncredit to myself for more of the virtue of humility than was my due;\r\ntherefore I open the door of my secret heart so far ajee, as to let the\r\nreader discern that I was content to hear our invitations were all\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nOf the specialities and dainties of the banquet prepared, it is not\r\nfitting that I should treat in any more particular manner, than to say\r\nthey were the best that could be had, and that our guests were all\r\nmightily well pleased.  Indeed, my wife was out of the body with\r\nexultation when Mrs Auchans of that Ilk begged that she would let her\r\nhave a copy of the directions she had followed in making a flummery,\r\nwhich the whole company declared was most excellent.  This compliment was\r\nthe more pleasant, as Lady Auchans was well known for her skill in\r\nsavoury contrivances, and to have anything new to her of the sort was a\r\ntriumph beyond our most sanguine expectations.  In a word, from that day\r\nwe found that we had taken, as it were, a step above the common in the\r\ntown.  There were, no doubt, some who envied our good fortune; but, upon\r\nthe whole, the community at large were pleased to see the consideration\r\nin which their chief magistrate was held.  It reflected down, as it were,\r\nupon themselves a glaik of the sunshine that shone upon us; and although\r\nit may be a light thing, as it is seemingly a vain one, to me to say, I\r\nam now pretty much of Mrs Pawkie's opinion, that our cultivation of an\r\nintercourse with the country gentry was, in the end, a benefit to our\r\nfamily, in so far as it obtained, both for my sons and daughters, a\r\ndegree of countenance that otherwise could hardly have been expected from\r\ntheir connexions and fortune, even though I had been twice provost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI--RETRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a sad accident shortly after happened, which had the effect of making\r\nit as little pleasant to me to vex Mr Hickery with a joke about the\r\nTappit-hen, as it was to him.  Widow Fenton, as I have soberly hinted;\r\nfor it is not a subject to be openly spoken of, had many ill-assorted and\r\nirregular characters among her customers; and a gang of play-actors\r\ncoming to the town, and getting leave to perform in Mr Dribble's barn,\r\nbatches of the young lads, both gentle and semple, when the play was\r\nover, used to adjourn to her house for pies and porter, the commodities\r\nin which she chiefly dealt.  One night, when the deep tragedy of Mary\r\nQueen of Scots was the play, there was a great concourse of people at\r\n\"The Theatre Royal,\" and the consequence was, that the Tappit-hen's\r\nhouse, both but and ben, was, at the conclusion, filled to overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe actress that played Queen Elizabeth, was a little-worth termagant\r\nwoman, and, in addition to other laxities of conduct, was addicted to the\r\nimmorality of taking more than did her good, and when in her cups, she\r\nwould rant and ring fiercer than old Queen Elizabeth ever could do\r\nherself.  Queen Mary's part was done by a bonny genty young lady, that\r\nwas said to have run away from a boarding-school, and, by all accounts,\r\nshe acted wonderful well.  But she too was not altogether without a flaw,\r\nso that there was a division in the town between their admirers and\r\nvisiters; some maintaining, as I was told, that Mrs Beaufort, if she\r\nwould keep herself sober, was not only a finer woman, but more of a lady,\r\nand a better actress, than Miss Scarborough, while others considered her\r\nas a vulgar regimental virago.\r\n\r\nThe play of Mary Queen of Scots, causing a great congregation of the\r\nrival partizans of the two ladies to meet in the Tappit-hen's public,\r\nsome contention took place about the merits of their respective\r\nfavourites, and, from less to more, hands were raised, and blows given,\r\nand the trades'-lads, being as hot in their differences as the gentlemen,\r\na dreadful riot ensued.  Gillstoups, porter bottles, and penny pies flew\r\nlike balls and bomb-shells in battle.  Mrs Fenton, with her mutch off,\r\nand her hair loose, with wide and wild arms, like a witch in a whirlwind,\r\nwas seen trying to sunder the challengers, and the champions.  Finding,\r\nhowever, her endeavours unavailing, and fearing that murder would be\r\ncommitted, she ran like desperation into the streets, crying for help.  I\r\nwas just at the time stepping into my bed, when I heard the uproar, and,\r\ndressing myself again, I went out to the street; for the sound and din of\r\nthe riot came raging through the silence of the midnight, like the\r\ntearing and swearing of the multitude at a house on fire, and I thought\r\nno less an accident could be the cause.\r\n\r\nOn going into the street, I met several persons running to the scene of\r\naction, and, among others, Mrs Beaufort, with a gallant of her own, and\r\nboth of them no in their sober senses.  It's no for me to say who he was;\r\nbut assuredly, had the woman no been doited with drink, she never would\r\nhave seen any likeness between him and me, for he was more than twenty\r\nyears my junior.  However, onward we all ran to Mrs Fenton's house, where\r\nthe riot, like a raging caldron boiling o'er, had overflowed into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe moment I reached the door, I ran forward with my stick raised, but\r\nnot with any design of striking man, woman, or child, when a ramplor\r\ndevil, the young laird of Swinton, who was one of the most outstrapolous\r\nrakes about the town, wrenched it out of my grip, and would have, I dare\r\nsay, made no scruple of doing me some dreadful bodily harm, when suddenly\r\nI found myself pulled out of the crowd by a powerful-handed woman, who\r\ncried, \"Come, my love; love, come:\" and who was this but that scarlet\r\nstrumpet, Mrs Beaufort, who having lost her gallant in the crowd, and\r\nbeing, as I think, blind fou, had taken me for him, insisting before all\r\npresent that I was her dear friend, and that she would die for me--with\r\nother siclike fantastical and randy ranting, which no queen in a tragedy\r\ncould by any possibility surpass.  At first I was confounded and\r\novertaken, and could not speak; and the worst of all was, that, in a\r\nmoment, the mob seemed to forget their quarrel, and to turn in derision\r\non me.  What might have ensued it would not be easy to say; but just at\r\nthis very critical juncture, and while the drunken latheron was casting\r\nherself into antic shapes of distress, and flourishing with her hands and\r\narms to the heavens at my imputed cruelty, two of the town-officers came\r\nup, which gave me courage to act a decisive part; so I gave over to them\r\nMrs Beaufort, with all her airs, and, going myself to the guardhouse,\r\nbrought a file of soldiers, and so quelled the riot.  But from that night\r\nI thought it prudent to eschew every allusion to Mrs Fenton, and tacitly\r\nto forgive even Swinton for the treatment I had received from him, by\r\nseeming as if I had not noticed him, although I had singled him out by\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMrs Pawkie, on hearing what I had suffered from Mrs Beaufort, was very\r\nzealous that I should punish her to the utmost rigour of the law, even to\r\ndrumming her out of the town; but forbearance was my best policy, so I\r\nonly persuaded my colleagues to order the players to decamp, and to give\r\nthe Tappit-hen notice, that it would be expedient for the future sale of\r\nher pies and porter, at untimeous hours, and that she should flit her\r\nhowff from our town.  Indeed, what pleasure would it have been to me to\r\nhave dealt unmercifully, either towards the one or the other? for surely\r\nthe gentle way of keeping up a proper respect for magistrates, and others\r\nin authority, should ever be preferred; especially, as in cases like\r\nthis, where there had been no premeditated wrong.  And I say this with\r\nthe greater sincerity; for in my secret conscience, when I think of the\r\naffair at this distance of time, I am pricked not a little in reflecting\r\nhow I had previously crowed and triumphed over poor Mr Hickery, in the\r\nmatter of his mortification at the time of Miss Peggy Dainty's false\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII--THE DUEL\r\n\r\n\r\nHeretofore all my magisterial undertakings and concerns had thriven in a\r\nvery satisfactory manner.  I was, to be sure, now and then, as I have\r\nnarrated, subjected to opposition, and squibs, and a jeer; and envious\r\nand spiteful persons were not wanting in the world to call in question my\r\nintents and motives, representing my best endeavours for the public good\r\nas but a right-handed method to secure my own interests.  It would be a\r\nvain thing of me to deny, that, at the beginning of my career, I was\r\nmisled by the wily examples of the past times, who thought that, in\r\ntaking on them to serve the community, they had a privilege to see that\r\nthey were full-handed for what benefit they might do the public; but as I\r\ngathered experience, and saw the rising of the sharp-sighted spirit that\r\nis now abroad among the affairs of men, I clearly discerned that it would\r\nbe more for the advantage of me and mine to act with a conformity\r\nthereto, than to seek, by any similar wiles or devices, an immediate and\r\nsicker advantage.  I may therefore say, without a boast, that the two or\r\nthree years before my third provostry were as renowned and comfortable to\r\nmyself, upon the whole, as any reasonable man could look for.  We cannot,\r\nhowever, expect a full cup and measure of the sweets of life, without\r\nsome adulteration of the sour and bitter; and it was my lot and fate to\r\nprove an experience of this truth, in a sudden and unaccountable falling\r\noff from all moral decorum in a person of my brother's only son, Richard,\r\na lad that was a promise of great ability in his youth.\r\n\r\nHe was just between the tyning and the winning, as the saying is, when\r\nthe playactors, before spoken off, came to the town, being then in his\r\neighteenth year.  Naturally of a light-hearted and funny disposition, and\r\npossessing a jocose turn for mimickry, he was a great favourite among his\r\ncompanions, and getting in with the players, it seems drew up with that\r\nlittle-worth, demure daffodel, Miss Scarborough, through the\r\ninstrumentality of whose condisciples and the randy Mrs Beaufort, that\r\nriot at Widow Fenton's began, which ended in expurgating the town of the\r\nwhole gang, bag and baggage.  Some there were, I shall here mention, who\r\nsaid that the expulsion of the players was owing to what I had heard\r\nanent the intromission of my nephew; but, in verity, I had not the least\r\nspunk or spark of suspicion of what was going on between him and the\r\nmiss, till one night, some time after, Richard and the young laird of\r\nSwinton, with others of their comrades, forgathered, and came to high\r\nwords on the subject, the two being rivals, or rather, as was said,\r\nequally in esteem and favour with the lady.\r\n\r\nYoung Swinton was, to say the truth of him, a fine bold rattling lad,\r\nwarm in the temper, and ready with the hand, and no man's foe so much as\r\nhis own; for he was a spoiled bairn, through the partiality of old Lady\r\nBodikins, his grandmother, who lived in the turreted house at the town-\r\nend, by whose indulgence he grew to be of a dressy and rakish\r\ninclination, and, like most youngsters of the kind, was vain of his\r\nshames, the which cost Mr Pittle's session no little trouble.  But--not\r\nto dwell on his faults--my nephew and he quarrelled, and nothing less\r\nwould serve them than to fight a duel, which they did with pistols next\r\nmorning; and Richard received from the laird's first shot a bullet in the\r\nleft arm, that disabled him in that member for life.  He was left for\r\ndead on the green where they fought--Swinton and the two seconds making,\r\nas was supposed, their escape.\r\n\r\nWhen Richard was found faint and bleeding by Tammy Tout, the town-herd,\r\nas he drove out the cows in the morning, the hobleshow is not to be\r\ndescribed; and my brother came to me, and insisted that I should give him\r\na warrant to apprehend all concerned.  I was grieved for my brother, and\r\nvery much distressed to think of what had happened to blithe Dicky, as I\r\nwas wont to call my nephew when he was a laddie, and I would fain have\r\ngratified the spirit of revenge in myself; but I brought to mind his\r\nroving and wanton pranks, and I counselled his father first to abide the\r\nupshot of the wound, representing to him, in the best manner I could,\r\nthat it was but the quarrel of the young men, and that maybe his son was\r\nas muckle in fault as Swinton.\r\n\r\nMy brother was, however, of a hasty temper, and upbraided me with my\r\nslackness, on account, as he tauntingly insinuated, of the young laird\r\nbeing one of my best customers, which was a harsh and unrighteous doing;\r\nbut it was not the severest trial which the accident occasioned to me;\r\nfor the same night, at a late hour, a line was brought to me by a lassie,\r\nrequesting I would come to a certain place--and when I went there, who\r\nwas it from but Swinton and the two other young lads that had been the\r\nseconds at the duel.\r\n\r\n\"Bailie,\" said the laird on behalf of himself and friends, \"though you\r\nare the uncle of poor Dick, we have resolved to throw ourselves into your\r\nhands, for we have not provided any money to enable us to flee the\r\ncountry; we only hope you will not deal overly harshly with us till his\r\nfate is ascertained.\"\r\n\r\nI was greatly disconcerted, and wist not what to say; for knowing the\r\nrigour of our Scottish laws against duelling, I was wae to see three\r\nbrave youths, not yet come to years of discretion, standing in the peril\r\nand jeopardy of an ignominious end, and that, too, for an injury done to\r\nmy own kin; and then I thought of my nephew and of my brother, that,\r\nmaybe, would soon be in sorrow for the loss of his only son.  In short, I\r\nwas tried almost beyond my humanity.  The three poor lads, seeing me\r\nhesitate, were much moved, and one of them (Sandy Blackie) said, \"I told\r\nyou how it would be; it was even-down madness to throw ourselves into the\r\nlion's mouth.\"  To this Swinton replied, \"Mr Pawkie, we have cast\r\nourselves on your mercy as a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could I say to this, but that I hoped they would find me one; and\r\nwithout speaking any more at that time--for indeed I could not, my heart\r\nbeat so fast--I bade them follow me, and taking them round by the back\r\nroad to my garden yett, I let them in, and conveyed them into a warehouse\r\nwhere I kept my bales and boxes.  Then slipping into the house, I took\r\nout of the pantry a basket of bread and a cold leg of mutton, which, when\r\nMrs Pawkie and the servant lassies missed in the morning, they could not\r\ndivine what had become of; and giving the same to them, with a bottle of\r\nwine--for they were very hungry, having tasted nothing all day--I went\r\nround to my brother's to see at the latest how Richard was.  But such a\r\nstang as I got on entering the house, when I heard his mother wailing\r\nthat he was dead, he having fainted away in getting the bullet extracted;\r\nand when I saw his father coming out of the room like a demented man, and\r\nheard again his upbraiding of me for having refused a warrant to\r\napprehend the murderers--I was so stunned with the shock, and with the\r\nthought of the poor young lads in my mercy, that I could with difficulty\r\nsupport myself along the passage into a room where there was a chair,\r\ninto which I fell rather than threw myself.  I had not, however, been\r\nlong seated, when a joyful cry announced that Richard was recovering, and\r\npresently he was in a manner free from pain; and the doctor assured me\r\nthe wound was probably not mortal.  I did not, however, linger long on\r\nhearing this; but hastening home, I took what money I had in my\r\nscrutoire, and going to the malefactors, said, \"Lads, take thir twa three\r\npounds, and quit the town as fast as ye can, for Richard is my nephew,\r\nand blood, ye ken, is thicker than water, and I may be tempted to give\r\nyou up.\"\r\n\r\nThey started on their legs, and shaking me in a warm manner by both the\r\nhands, they hurried away without speaking, nor could I say more, as I\r\nopened the back yett to let them out, than bid them take tent of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nMrs Pawkie was in a great consternation at my late absence, and when I\r\nwent home she thought I was ill, I was so pale and flurried, and she\r\nwanted to send for the doctor, but I told her that when I was calmed, I\r\nwould be better; however, I got no sleep that night.  In the morning I\r\nwent to see Richard, whom I found in a composed and rational state: he\r\nconfessed to his father that he was as muckle to blame as Swinton, and\r\nbegged and entreated us, if he should die, not to take any steps against\r\nthe fugitives: my brother, however, was loth to make rash promises, and\r\nit was not till his son was out of danger that I had any ease of mind for\r\nthe part I had played.  But when Richard was afterwards well enough to go\r\nabout, and the duellers had come out of their hidings, they told him what\r\nI had done, by which the whole affair came to the public, and I got great\r\nfame thereby, none being more proud to speak of it than poor Dick\r\nhimself, who, from that time, became the bosom friend of Swinton; in so\r\nmuch that, when he was out of his time as a writer, and had gone through\r\nhis courses at Edinburgh, the laird made him his man of business, and, in\r\na manner, gave him a nest egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII--AN INTERLOCUTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon a consideration of many things, it appears to me very strange, that\r\nalmost the whole tot of our improvements became, in a manner, the parents\r\nof new plagues and troubles to the magistrates.  It might reasonably have\r\nbeen thought that the lamps in the streets would have been a terror to\r\nevil-doers, and the plainstone side-pavements paths of pleasantness to\r\nthem that do well; but, so far from this being the case, the very reverse\r\nwas the consequence.  The servant lasses went freely out (on their\r\nerrands) at night, and at late hours, for their mistresses, without the\r\nprotection of lanterns, by which they were enabled to gallant in a way\r\nthat never could have before happened: for lanterns are kenspeckle\r\ncommodities, and of course a check on every kind of gavaulling.  Thus,\r\nout of the lamps sprung no little irregularity in the conduct of\r\nservants, and much bitterness of spirit on that account to mistresses,\r\nespecially to those who were of a particular turn, and who did not choose\r\nthat their maidens should spend their hours a-field, when they could be\r\nprofitably employed at home.\r\n\r\nOf the plagues that were from the plainstones, I have given an exemplary\r\nspecimen in the plea between old perjink Miss Peggy Dainty, and the widow\r\nFenton, that was commonly called the Tappit-hen.  For the present, I\r\nshall therefore confine myself in this _nota bena_ to an accident that\r\nhappened to Mrs Girdwood, the deacon of the coopers' wife--a most\r\nmanaging, industrious, and indefatigable woman, that allowed no grass to\r\ngrow in her path.\r\n\r\nMrs Girdwood had fee'd one Jeanie Tirlet, and soon after she came home,\r\nthe mistress had her big summer washing at the public washing-house on\r\nthe green--all the best of her sheets and napery--both what had been used\r\nin the course of the winter, and what was only washed to keep clear in\r\nthe colour, were in the boyne.  It was one of the greatest doings of the\r\nkind that the mistress had in the whole course of the year, and the value\r\nof things intrusted to Jeanie's care was not to be told, at least so said\r\nMrs Girdwood herself.\r\n\r\nJeanie and Marion Sapples, the washerwoman, with a pickle tea and sugar\r\ntied in the corners of a napkin, and two measured glasses of whisky in an\r\nold doctor's bottle, had been sent with the foul clothes the night before\r\nto the washing-house, and by break of day they were up and at their work;\r\nnothing particular, as Marion said, was observed about Jeanie till after\r\nthey had taken their breakfast, when, in spreading out the clothes on the\r\ngreen, some of the ne'er-do-weel young clerks of the town were seen\r\ngaffawing and haverelling with Jeanie, the consequence of which was, that\r\nall the rest of the day she was light-headed; indeed, as Mrs Girdwood\r\ntold me herself, when Jeanie came in from the green for Marion's dinner,\r\nshe couldna help remarking to her goodman, that there was something fey\r\nabout the lassie, or, to use her own words, there was a storm in her\r\ntail, light where it might.  But little did she think it was to bring the\r\ndule it did to her.\r\n\r\nJeanie having gotten the pig with the wonted allowance of broth and beef\r\nin it for Marion, returned to the green, and while Marion was eating the\r\nsame, she disappeared.  Once away, aye away; hilt or hair of Jeanie was\r\nnot seen that night.  Honest Marion Sapples worked like a Trojan to the\r\ngloaming, but the light latheron never came back; at last, seeing no\r\nother help for it, she got one of the other women at the washing-house to\r\ngo to Mrs Girdwood and to let her know what had happened, and how the\r\nbest part of the washing would, unless help was sent, be obliged to lie\r\nout all night.\r\n\r\nThe deacon's wife well knew the great stake she had on that occasion in\r\nthe boyne, and was for a season demented with the thought; but at last\r\nsummoning her three daughters, and borrowing our lass, and Mr Smeddum the\r\ntobacconist's niece, she went to the green, and got everything safely\r\nhoused, yet still Jeanie Tirlet never made her appearance.\r\n\r\nMrs Girdwood and her daughters having returned home, in a most uneasy\r\nstate of mind on the lassie's account, the deacon himself came over to\r\nme, to consult what he ought to do as the head of a family.  But I\r\nadvised him to wait till Jeanie cast up, which was the next morning.\r\nWhere she had been, and who she was with, could never be delved out of\r\nher; but the deacon brought her to the clerk's chamber, before Bailie\r\nKittlewit, who was that day acting magistrate, and he sentenced her to be\r\ndismissed from her servitude with no more than the wage she had actually\r\nearned.  The lassie was conscious of the ill turn she had played, and\r\nwould have submitted in modesty; but one of the writers' clerks, an\r\nimpudent whipper-snapper, that had more to say with her than I need to\r\nsay, bade her protest and appeal against the interlocutor, which the\r\ndaring gipsy, so egged on, actually did, and the appeal next court day\r\ncame before me.  Whereupon, I, knowing the outs and ins of the case,\r\ndecerned that she should be fined five shillings to the poor of the\r\nparish, and ordained to go back to Mrs Girdwood's, and there stay out the\r\nterm of her servitude, or failing by refusal so to do, to be sent to\r\nprison, and put to hard labour for the remainder of the term.\r\n\r\nEvery body present, on hearing the circumstances, thought this a most\r\njudicious and lenient sentence; but so thought not the other servant\r\nlasses of the town; for in the evening, as I was going home, thinking no\r\nharm, on passing the Cross-well, where a vast congregation of them were\r\nassembled with their stoups discoursing the news of the day, they opened\r\non me like a pack of hounds at a tod, and I verily believed they would\r\nhave mobbed me had I not made the best of my way home.  My wife had been\r\nat the window when the hobleshow began, and was just like to die of\r\ndiversion at seeing me so set upon by the tinklers; and when I entered\r\nthe dining-room she said, \"Really, Mr Pawkie, ye're a gallant man, to be\r\nso weel in the good graces of the ladies.\"  But although I have often\r\nsince had many a good laugh at the sport, I was not overly pleased with\r\nMrs Pawkie at the time--particularly as the matter between the deacon's\r\nwife and Jeanie did not end with my interlocutor.  For the latheron's\r\nfriend in the court having discovered that I had not decerned she was to\r\ndo any work to Mrs Girdwood, but only to stay out her term, advised her\r\nto do nothing when she went back but go to her bed, which she was bardy\r\nenough to do, until my poor friend, the deacon, in order to get a quiet\r\nriddance of her, was glad to pay her full fee, and board wages for the\r\nremainder of her time.  This was the same Jeanie Tirlet that was\r\ntransported for some misdemeanour, after making both Glasgow and\r\nEdinburgh owre het to hold her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX--THE NEWSPAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the foregoing tribulation, of which I cannot take it upon\r\nme to say that I got so well rid as of many other vexations of a more\r\ngrievous nature, there arose a thing in the town that caused to me much\r\ndeep concern, and very serious reflection.  I had been, from the\r\nbeginning, a true government man, as all loyal subjects ought in duty to\r\nbe; for I never indeed could well understand how it would advantage,\r\neither the king or his ministers, to injure and do detriment to the\r\nlieges; on the contrary, I always saw and thought that his majesty, and\r\nthose of his cabinet, had as great an interest in the prosperity and well-\r\ndoing of the people, as it was possible for a landlord to have in the\r\nthriving of his tenantry.  Accordingly, giving on all occasions, and at\r\nall times and seasons, even when the policy of the kingdom was overcast\r\nwith a cloud, the king and government, in church and state, credit for\r\nthe best intentions, however humble their capacity in performance might\r\nseem in those straits and difficulties, which, from time to time,\r\ndumfoundered the wisest in power and authority, I was exceedingly\r\ntroubled to hear that a newspaper was to be set up in the burgh, and\r\nthat, too, by hands not altogether clean of the coom of jacobinical\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe person that first brought me an account of this, and it was in a\r\nprivate confidential manner, was Mr Scudmyloof, the grammar schoolmaster,\r\na man of method and lear, to whom the fathers of the project had applied\r\nfor an occasional cast of his skill, in the way of Latin head-pieces, and\r\nessays of erudition concerning the free spirit among the ancient Greeks\r\nand Romans; but he, not liking the principle of the men concerned in the\r\nscheme, thought that it would be a public service to the community at\r\nlarge, if a stop could be put, by my help, to the opening of such an\r\nettering sore and king's evil as a newspaper, in our heretofore and\r\nhitherto truly royal and loyal burgh; especially as it was given out that\r\nthe calamity, for I can call it no less, was to be conducted on liberal\r\nprinciples, meaning, of course, in the most afflicting and vexatious\r\nmanner towards his majesty's ministers.\r\n\r\n\"What ye say,\" said I to Mr Scudmyloof when he told me the news, \"is very\r\nalarming, very much so indeed; but as there is no law yet actually and\r\nperemptorily prohibiting the sending forth of newspapers, I doubt it will\r\nnot be in my power to interfere.\"\r\n\r\nHe was of the same opinion; and we both agreed it was a rank exuberance\r\nof liberty, that the commonality should be exposed to the risk of being\r\ninoculated with anarchy and confusion, from what he, in his learned\r\nmanner, judiciously called the predilections of amateur pretension.  The\r\nparties engaged in the project being Mr Absolom the writer--a man no\r\noverly reverential in his opinion of the law and lords when his clients\r\nlost their pleas, which, poor folk, was very often--and some three or\r\nfour young and inexperienced lads, that were wont to read essays, and\r\ndebate the kittle points of divinity and other hidden knowledge, in the\r\nCross-Keys monthly, denying the existence of the soul of man, as Dr\r\nSinney told me, till they were deprived of all rationality by foreign or\r\nBritish spirits.  In short, I was perplexed when I heard of the design,\r\nnot knowing what to do, or what might be expected from me by government\r\nin a case of such emergency as the setting up of a newspaper so\r\ndeclaredly adverse to every species of vested trust and power; for it was\r\neasy to forsee that those immediately on the scene would be the first\r\nopposed to the onset and brunt of the battle.  Never can any public man\r\nhave a more delicate task imposed upon him, than to steer clear of\r\noffence in such a predicament.  After a full consideration of the\r\nbusiness, Mr Scudmyloof declared that he would retire from the field, and\r\nstand aloof; and he rehearsed a fine passage in the Greek language on\r\nthat head, pat to the occasion, but which I did not very thoroughly\r\nunderstand, being no deacon in the dead languages, as I told him at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut when the dominie had left me, I considered with myself, and having\r\nlong before then observed that our hopes, when realized, are always light\r\nin the grain, and our fears, when come to pass, less than they seemed as\r\nseen through the mists of time and distance, I resolved with myself to\r\nsit still with my eyes open, watching and saying nothing; and it was well\r\nthat I deported myself so prudently; for when the first number of the\r\npaper made its appearance, it was as poor a job as ever was \"open to all\r\nparties, and influenced by none;\" and it required but two eyes to discern\r\nthat there was no need of any strong power from the lord advocate to\r\nsuppress or abolish the undertaking; for there was neither birr nor\r\nsmeddum enough in it to molest the high or to pleasure the low; so being\r\nleft to itself, and not ennobled by any prosecution, as the schemers\r\nexpected, it became as foisonless as the \"London Gazette\" on ordinary\r\noccasions.  Those behind the curtain, who thought to bounce out with a\r\ngrand stot and strut before the world, finding that even I used it as a\r\nconvenient vehicle to advertise my houses when need was, and which I did\r\nby the way of a canny seduction of policy, joking civilly with Mr Absolom\r\nanent his paper trumpet, as I called it, they were utterly vanquished by\r\nseeing themselves of so little account in the world, and forsook the\r\nthing altogether; by which means it was gradually transformed into a very\r\nsolid and decent supporter of the government--Mr Absolom, for his pains,\r\nbeing invited to all our public dinners, of which he gave a full account,\r\nto the great satisfaction of all who were present, but more particularly\r\nto those who were not, especially the wives and ladies of the town, to\r\nwhom it was a great pleasure to see the names of their kith and kin in\r\nprint.  And indeed, to do Mr Absolom justice, he was certainly at great\r\npains to set off every thing to the best advantage, and usually put\r\nspeeches to some of our names which showed that, in the way of\r\ngrammaticals, he was even able to have mended some of the parliamentary\r\nclishmaclavers, of which the Londoners, with all their skill in the\r\ncraft, are so seldom able to lick into any shape of common sense.\r\n\r\nThus, by a judicious forbearance in the first instance, and a canny\r\nwising towards the undertaking in the second, did I, in the third, help\r\nto convert this dangerous political adversary into a very respectable\r\ninstrument of governmental influence and efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL--THE SCHOOL-HOUSE SCHEME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit of opposition that kithed towards me in the affair of Robin\r\nBoss, the drummer, was but an instance and symptom of the new nature then\r\ngrowing up in public matters.  I was not long done with my second\r\nprovostry, when I had occasion to congratulate myself on having passed\r\ntwice through the dignity with so much respect; for, at the Michaelmas\r\nterm, we had chosen Mr Robert Plan into the vacancy caused by the death\r\nof that easy man, Mr Weezle, which happened a short time before.  I know\r\nnot what came over me, that Mr Plan was allowed to be chosen, for I never\r\ncould abide him; being, as he was, a great stickler for small\r\nparticularities, more zealous than discreet, and even more intent to\r\ncarry his own point, than to consider the good that might flow from a\r\nmore urbane spirit.  Not that the man was devoid of ability--few, indeed,\r\ncould set forth a more plausible tale; but he was continually meddling,\r\nkeeking, and poking, and always taking up a suspicious opinion of every\r\nbody's intents and motives but his own.  He was, besides, of a retired\r\nand sedentary habit of body; and the vapour of his stomach, as he was\r\nsitting by himself, often mounted into his upper story, and begat, with\r\nhis over zealous and meddling imagination, many unsound and fantastical\r\nnotions.  For all that, however, it must be acknowledged that Mr Plan was\r\na sincere honest man, only he sometimes lacked the discernment of the\r\nright from the wrong; and the consequence was, that, when in error, he\r\nwas even more obstinate than when in the right; for his jealousy of human\r\nnature made him interpret falsely the heat with which his own headstrong\r\nzeal, when in error, was ever very properly resisted.\r\n\r\nIn nothing, however, did his molesting temper cause so much disturbance,\r\nas when, in the year 1809, the bigging of the new school-house was under\r\nconsideration.  There was, about that time, a great sough throughout the\r\ncountry on the subject of education, and it was a fashion to call schools\r\nacademies; and out of a delusion rising from the use of that term, to\r\nthink it necessary to decry the good plain old places, wherein so many\r\nhad learnt those things by which they helped to make the country and\r\nkingdom what it is, and to scheme for the ways and means to raise more\r\nedificial structures and receptacles.  None was more infected with his\r\ndistemperature than Mr Plan; and accordingly, when he came to the council-\r\nchamber, on the day that the matter of the new school-house was to be\r\ndiscussed, he brought with him a fine castle in the air, which he pressed\r\nhard upon us; representing, that if we laid out two or three thousand\r\npounds more than we intended, and built a beautiful academy and got a\r\nrector thereto, with a liberal salary, and other suitable masters,\r\nopulent people at a distance--yea, gentlemen in the East and West\r\nIndies--would send their children to be educated among us, by which,\r\ngreat fame and profit would redound to the town.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more plausibly set forth; and certainly the project, as\r\na notion, had many things to recommend it; but we had no funds adequate\r\nto undertake it; so, on the score of expense, knowing, as I did, the\r\nstate of the public income, I thought it my duty to oppose it _in toto_;\r\nwhich fired Mr Plan to such a degree, that he immediately insinuated that\r\nI had some end of my own to serve in objecting to his scheme; and because\r\nthe wall that it was proposed to big round the moderate building, which\r\nwe were contemplating, would inclose a portion of the backside of my new\r\nsteading at the Westergate, he made no scruple of speaking, in a\r\ncircumbendibus manner, as to the particular reasons that I might have for\r\npreferring it to his design, which he roused, in his way, as more worthy\r\nof the state of the arts and the taste of the age.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to sit still under his imputations; especially as I could\r\nplainly see that some of the other members of the council leant towards\r\nhis way of thinking.  Nor will I deny that, in preferring the more\r\nmoderate design, I had a contemplation of my own advantage in the matter\r\nof the dyke; for I do not think it any shame to a public man to serve his\r\nown interests by those of the community, when he can righteously do so.\r\n\r\nIt was a thing never questionable, that the school-house required the\r\ninclosure of a wall, and the outside of that wall was of a natural\r\nnecessity constrained to be a wing of inclosure to the ground beyond.\r\nTherefore, I see not how a corrupt motive ought to have been imputed to\r\nme, merely because I had a piece of ground that marched with the spot\r\nwhereon it was intended to construct the new building; which spot, I\r\nshould remark, belonged to the town before I bought mine.  However, Mr\r\nPlan so worked upon this material, that, what with one thing and what\r\nwith another, he got the council persuaded to give up the moderate plan,\r\nand to consent to sell the ground where it had been proposed to build the\r\nnew school, and to apply the proceeds towards the means of erecting a\r\nfine academy on the Green.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to thole to be so thwarted, especially for such an\r\nextravagant problem, by one so new to our councils and deliberations.  I\r\nnever was more fashed in my life; for having hitherto, in all my plans\r\nfor the improvement of the town, not only succeeded, but given\r\nsatisfaction, I was vexed to see the council run away with such a\r\nspeculative vagary.  No doubt, the popular fantasy anent education and\r\nacademies, had quite as muckle to do in the matter as Mr Plan's fozey\r\nrhetoric, but what availed that to me, at seeing a reasonable undertaking\r\nreviled and set aside, and grievous debts about to be laid on the\r\ncommunity for a bubble as unsubstantial as that of the Ayr Bank.  Besides,\r\nit was giving the upper hand in the council to Mr Plan, to which, as a\r\nnew man, he had no right.  I said but little, for I saw it would be of no\r\nuse; I, however, took a canny opportunity of remarking to old Mr\r\nDinledoup, the English teacher, that this castle-building scheme of an\r\nacademy would cause great changes probably in the masters; and as, no\r\ndoubt, it would oblige us to adopt the new methods of teaching, I would\r\nlike to have a private inkling of what salary he would expect on being\r\nsuperannuated.\r\n\r\nThe worthy man was hale and hearty, not exceeding three score and seven,\r\nand had never dreamt of being superannuated.  He was, besides, a prideful\r\nbody, and, like all of his calling, thought not a little of himself.  The\r\nsurprise, therefore, with which he heard me was just wonderful.  For a\r\nspace of time he stood still and uttered nothing; then he took his snuff-\r\nbox out of the flap pocket of his waistcoat, where he usually carried it,\r\nand, giving three distinct and very comical raps, drew his mouth into a\r\npurse.  \"Mr Pawkie,\" at last he said; \"Mr Pawkie, there will be news in\r\nthe world before I consent to be superannuated.\"\r\n\r\nThis was what I expected, and I replied, \"Then, why do not you and Mr\r\nScudmyloof, of the grammar school, represent to the magistrates that the\r\npresent school-house may, with a small repair, serve for many years.\"  And\r\nso I sowed an effectual seed of opposition to Mr Plan, in a quarter he\r\nnever dreamt of; the two dominies, in the dread of undergoing some\r\ntransmogrification, laid their heads together, and went round among the\r\nparents of the children, and decried the academy project, and the cess\r\nthat the cost of it would bring upon the town; by which a public opinion\r\nwas begotten and brought to a bearing, that the magistrates could not\r\nresist; so the old school-house was repaired, and Mr Plan's scheme, as\r\nwell as the other, given up.  In this, it is true, if I had not the\r\nsatisfaction to get a dyke to the backside of my property, I had the\r\npleasure to know that my interloping adversary was disappointed; the\r\nwhich was a sort of compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI--BENEFITS OF NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general election in 1812 was a source of trouble and uneasiness to\r\nme; both because our district of burghs was to be contested, and because\r\nthe contest was not between men of opposite principles, but of the same\r\nside.  To neither of them had I any particular leaning; on the contrary,\r\nI would have preferred the old member, whom I had, on different\r\noccasions, found an accessible and tractable instrument, in the way of\r\ngetting small favours with the government and India company, for friends\r\nthat never failed to consider them as such things should be.  But what\r\ncould I do?  Providence had placed me in the van of the battle, and I\r\nneeds must fight; so thought every body, and so for a time I thought\r\nmyself.  Weighing, however, the matter one night soberly in my mind, and\r\nseeing that whichever of the two candidates was chosen, I, by my adherent\r\nloyalty to the cause for which they were both declared, the contest\r\nbetween them being a rivalry of purse and personality, would have as much\r\nto say with the one as with the other, came to the conclusion that it was\r\nmy prudentest course not to intermeddle at all in the election.\r\nAccordingly, as soon as it was proper to make a declaration of my\r\nsentiments, I made this known, and it caused a great wonderment in the\r\ntown; nobody could imagine it possible that I was sincere, many thinking\r\nthere was something aneath it, which would kithe in time to the surprise\r\nof the public.  However, the peutering went on, and I took no part.  The\r\ntwo candidates were as civil and as liberal, the one after the other, to\r\nMrs Pawkie and my daughters, as any gentlemen of a parliamentary\r\nunderstanding could be.  Indeed, I verily believe, that although I had\r\nbeen really chosen delegate, as it was at one time intended I should be,\r\nI could not have hoped for half the profit that came in from the dubiety\r\nwhich my declaration of neutrality caused; for as often as I assured the\r\none candidate that I did not intend even to be present at the choosing of\r\nthe delegate, some rich present was sure to be sent to my wife, of which\r\nthe other no sooner heard than he was upsides with him.  It was just a\r\nsport to think of me protesting my neutrality, and to see how little I\r\nwas believed.  For still the friends of the two candidates, like the\r\nfigures of the four quarters of the world round Britannia in a picture,\r\ncame about my wife, and poured into her lap a most extraordinary\r\nparaphernalia from the horn of their abundance.\r\n\r\nThe common talk of the town was, that surely I was bereft of my wonted\r\ndiscretion, to traffic so openly with corruption; and that it could not\r\nbe doubted I would have to face the House of Commons, and suffer the\r\nworst pains and penalties of bribery.  But what did all this signify to\r\nme, who was conscious of the truth and integrity of my motives and\r\ntalents?  \"They say!--what say they?--let them say!\"--was what I said, as\r\noften as any of my canny friends came to me, saying, \"For God's sake, Mr\r\nPawkie, tak'tent\"--\"I hope, Mr Pawkie, ye ken the ground ye stand on\"--or,\r\n\"I wish that some folks were aware of what's said about them.\"  In short,\r\nI was both angered and diverted by their clishmaclavers; and having some\r\nneed to go into Glasgow just on the eve of the election, I thought I\r\nwould, for diversion, give them something in truth to play with; so\r\nsaying nothing to my shop lad the night before, nor even to Mrs Pawkie,\r\n(for the best of women are given to tattling), till we were in our beds,\r\nI went off early on the morning of the day appointed for choosing the\r\ndelegate.\r\n\r\nThe consternation in the town at my evasion was wonderful.  Nobody could\r\nfathom it; and the friends and supporters of the rival candidates looked,\r\nas I was told, at one another, in a state of suspicion that was just a\r\ncuriosity to witness.  Even when the delegate was chosen, every body\r\nthought that something would be found wanting, merely because I was not\r\npresent.  The new member himself, when his election was declared, did not\r\nfeel quite easy; and more than once, when I saw him after my return from\r\nGlasgow, he said to me, in a particular manner--\"But tell me now, bailie,\r\nwhat was the true reason of your visit to Glasgow?\"  And, in like manner,\r\nhis opponent also hinted that he would petition against the return; but\r\nthere were some facts which he could not well get at without my\r\nassistance--insinuating that I might find my account in helping him.\r\n\r\nAt last, the true policy of the part I had played began to be understood;\r\nand I got far more credit for the way in which I had turned both parties\r\nso well to my own advantage, than if I had been the means of deciding the\r\nelection by my single vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII--THE NEW MEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the new member was, in some points, not of so tractable a nature as\r\nmany of his predecessors had been; and notwithstanding all the couthy\r\njocosity and curry-favouring of his demeanour towards us before the\r\nelection, he was no sooner returned, than he began, as it were, to snap\r\nhis fingers in the very faces of those of the council to whom he was most\r\nindebted, which was a thing not of very easy endurance, considering how\r\nthey had taxed their consciences in his behalf; and this treatment was\r\nthe more bitterly felt, as the old member had been, during the whole of\r\nhis time, as considerate and obliging as could reasonably be expected;\r\ndoing any little job that needed his helping hand when it was in his\r\npower, and when it was not, replying to our letters in a most discreet\r\nand civil manner.  To be sure, poor man, he had but little to say in the\r\nway of granting favours; for being latterly inclined to a whiggish\r\nprinciple, he was, in consequence, debarred from all manner of government\r\npatronage, and had little in his gift but soft words and fair promises.\r\nIndeed, I have often remarked, in the course of my time, that there is a\r\nsurprising difference, in regard to the urbanities in use among those who\r\nhave not yet come to authority, or who have been cast down from it, and\r\nthose who are in the full possession of the rule and domination of\r\noffice; but never was the thing plainer than in the conduct of the new\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nHe was by nature and inclination one of the upsetting sort; a kind of man\r\nwho, in all manner of business, have a leaven of contrariness, that makes\r\nthem very hard to deal with; and he, being conjunct with his majesty's\r\nministers at London, had imbibed and partook of that domineering spirit\r\nto which all men are ordained, to be given over whenever they are clothed\r\nin the garments of power.  Many among us thought, by his colleaguing with\r\nthe government, that we had got a great catch, and they were both blythe\r\nand vogie when he was chosen; none doubting but he would do much good\r\nservitude to the corporation, and the interests of the burgh.  However he\r\nsoon gave a rebuff, that laid us all on our backs in a state of the\r\ngreatest mortification.  But although it behoved me to sink down with the\r\nrest, I was but little hurt: on the contary, I had a good laugh in my\r\nsleeve at the time; and afterwards, many a merry tumbler of toddy with my\r\nbrethren, when they had recovered from their discomfiture.  The story was\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after the election, Mr Scudmyloof, the schoolmaster,\r\ncalled one day on me, in my shop, and said, \"That being of a nervous\r\nturn, the din of the school did not agree with him; and that he would,\r\ntherefore, be greatly obligated to me if I would get him made a gauger.\"\r\nThere had been something in the carriage of our new member, before he\r\nleft the town, that was not satisfactory to me, forbye my part at the\r\nelection, the which made me loth to be the first to ask for any grace,\r\nthough the master was a most respectable and decent man; so I advised Mr\r\nScudmyloof to apply to Provost Pickandab, who had been the delegate, as\r\nthe person to whose instrumentality the member was most obliged; and to\r\nwhose application, he of course would pay the greatest attention.\r\n\r\nWhether Provost Pickandab had made any observe similar to mine, I never\r\ncould rightly understand, though I had a notion to that effect: he,\r\nhowever, instead of writing himself, made the application for Mr\r\nScudmyloof an affair of the council; recommending him as a worthy modest\r\nman, which he really was, and well qualified for the post.  Off went this\r\nnotable letter, and by return of post from London, we got our answer as\r\nwe were all sitting in council; deliberating anent the rebuilding of the\r\nCrosswell, which had been for some time in a sore state of dilapidation;\r\nand surely never was any letter more to the point and less to the purpose\r\nof an applicant.  It was very short and pithy, just acknowledging receipt\r\nof ours; and adding thereto, \"circumstances do not allow me to pay any\r\nattention to such applications.\"  We all with one accord, in sympathy and\r\ninstinct, threw ourselves back in our chairs at the words, looking at\r\nProvost Pickandab, with the pragmatical epistle in his hand, sitting in\r\nhis place at the head of the table, with the countenance of\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself, I began to consider that there must have been\r\nsomething no right in the provost's own letter on the subject, to cause\r\nsuch an uncourteous rebuff; so after condemning, in very strong terms,\r\nthe member's most ungenteel style, in order to procure for myself a\r\npatient hearing, I warily proposed that the provost's application should\r\nbe read, a copy thereof being kept, and I had soon a positive\r\nconfirmation of my suspicion.  For the provost, being fresh in the\r\ndignity of his office, and naturally of a prideful turn, had addressed\r\nthe parliament man as if he was under an obligation to him; and as if the\r\ncouncil had a right to command him to get the gauger's post, or indeed\r\nany other, for whomsoever they might apply.  So, seeing whence the\r\noriginal sin of the affair had sprung, I said nothing; but the same night\r\nI wrote a humiliated letter from myself to the member, telling him how\r\nsorry we all were for the indiscretion that had been used towards him,\r\nand how much it would pleasure me to heal the breach that had happened\r\nbetween him and the burgh, with other words of an oily and conciliating\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe indignant member, by the time my letter reached hand, had cooled in\r\nhis passion, and, I fancy, was glad of an occasion to do away the\r\nconsequence of the rupture; for with a most extraordinary alacrity he\r\nprocured Mr Scudmyloof the post, writing me, when he had done so, in the\r\ncivilest manner, and saying many condescending things concerning his\r\nregard for me; all which ministered to maintain and uphold my repute and\r\nconsideration in the town, as superior to that of the provost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII--MY THIRD PROVOSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the Michaelmas 1813 that I was chosen provost for the third\r\ntime, and at the special request of my lord the earl, who, being in ill\r\nhealth, had been advised by the faculty of doctors in London to try the\r\nmedicinal virtues of the air and climate of Sicily, in the Mediterranean\r\nsea; and there was an understanding on the occasion, that I should hold\r\nthe post of honour for two years, chiefly in order to bring to a\r\nconclusion different works that the town had then in hand.\r\n\r\nAt the two former times when I was raised to the dignity, and indeed at\r\nall times when I received any advancement, I had enjoyed an elation of\r\nheart, and was, as I may say, crouse and vogie; but experience had worked\r\na change upon my nature, and when I was saluted on my election with the\r\ncustomary greetings and gratulations of those present, I felt a solemnity\r\nenter into the frame of my thoughts, and I became as it were a new man on\r\nthe spot.  When I returned home to my own house, I retired into my\r\nprivate chamber for a time, to consult with myself in what manner my\r\ndeportment should be regulated; for I was conscious that heretofore I had\r\nbeen overly governed with a disposition to do things my own way, and\r\nalthough not in an avaricious temper, yet something, I must confess, with\r\na sort of sinister respect for my own interests.  It may be, that\r\nstanding now clear and free of the world, I had less incitement to be so\r\ngrippy, and so was thought of me, I very well know; but in sobriety and\r\ntruth I conscientiously affirm, and herein record, that I had lived to\r\npartake of the purer spirit which the great mutations of the age had\r\nconjured into public affairs, and I saw that there was a necessity to\r\ncarry into all dealings with the concerns of the community, the same\r\nprobity which helps a man to prosperity in the sequestered traffic of\r\nprivate life.\r\n\r\nThis serious and religious communing wrought within me to a benign and\r\npleasant issue, and when I went back in the afternoon to dine with the\r\ncorporation in the council-room, and looked around me on the bailies, the\r\ncouncillors, and the deacons, I felt as if I was indeed elevated above\r\nthem all, and that I had a task to perform, in which I could hope for but\r\nlittle sympathy from many; and the first thing I did was to measure, with\r\na discreet hand, the festivity of the occasion.\r\n\r\nAt all former and precedent banquets, it had been the custom to give vent\r\nto muckle wanton and luxurious indulgence, and to galravitch, both at\r\nhack and manger, in a very expensive manner to the funds of the town.  I\r\ntherefore resolved to set my face against this for the future; and\r\naccordingly, when we had enjoyed a jocose temperance of loyalty and\r\nhilarity, with a decent measure of wine, I filled a glass, and requesting\r\nall present to do the same, without any preliminary reflections on the\r\ngavaulling of past times, I drank good afternoon to each severally, and\r\nthen rose from the table, in a way that put an end to all the\r\nexpectations of more drink.\r\n\r\nBut this conduct did not give satisfaction to some of the old hands, who\r\nhad been for years in the habit and practice of looking forward to the\r\nprovost's dinner as to a feast of fat things.  Mr Peevie, one of the very\r\nsickerest of all the former sederunts, came to me next morning, in a\r\nremonstrating disposition, to enquire what had come over me, and to tell\r\nme that every body was much surprised, and many thought it not right of\r\nme to break in upon ancient and wonted customs in such a sudden and\r\nunconcerted manner.\r\n\r\nThis Mr Peevie was, in his person, a stumpy man, well advanced in years.\r\nHe had been, in his origin, a bonnet-maker; but falling heir to a friend\r\nthat left him a property, he retired from business about the fiftieth\r\nyear of his age, doing nothing but walking about with an ivory-headed\r\nstaff, in a suit of dark bluecloth with yellow buttons, wearing a large\r\ncocked hat, and a white three-tiered wig, which was well powdered every\r\nmorning by Duncan Curl, the barber.  The method of his discourse and\r\nconversation was very precise, and his words were all set forth in a\r\nstyle of consequence, that took with many for a season as the pith and\r\nmarrow of solidity and sense.  The body, however, was but a pompous\r\ntrifle, and I had for many a day held his observes and admonishments in\r\nno very reverential estimation.  So that, when I heard him address me in\r\nsuch a memorializing manner, I was inclined and tempted to set him off\r\nwith a flea in his lug.  However, I was enabled to bridle and rein in\r\nthis prejudicial humour, and answer him in his own way.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Peevie,\" quo' I, \"you know that few in the town hae the repute that\r\nye hae for a gift of sagacity by common, and therefore I'll open my mind\r\nto you in this matter, with a frankness that would not be a judicious\r\npolity with folk of a lighter understanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis was before the counter in my shop.  I then walked in behind it, and\r\ndrew the chair that stands in the corner nearer to the fire, for Mr\r\nPeevie.  When he was seated thereon, and, as was his wont in\r\nconversation, had placed both his hands on the top of his staff, and\r\nleant his chin on the same, I subjoined.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Peevie, I need not tell to a man of your experience, that folk in\r\npublic stations cannot always venture to lay before the world the reasons\r\nof their conduct on particular occasions; and therefore, when men who\r\nhave been long in the station that I have filled in this town, are seen\r\nto step aside from what has been in time past, it is to be hoped that\r\ngrave and sensible persons like you, Mr Peevie, will no rashly condemn\r\nthem unheard; nevertheless, my good friend, I am very happy that ye have\r\nspoken to me anent the stinted allowance of wine and punch at the dinner,\r\nbecause the like thing from any other would have made me jealouse that\r\nthe complaint was altogether owing to a disappointed appetite, which is a\r\ncorrupt thing, that I am sure would never affect a man of such a public\r\nspirit as you are well known to be.\"\r\n\r\nMr Peevie, at this, lifted his chin from off his hands, and dropping his\r\narms down upon his knees, held his staff by the middle, as he replied,\r\nlooking upward to me,\r\n\r\n\"What ye say, Provost Pawkie, has in it a solid commodity of judgment and\r\nsensibility; and ye may be sure that I was not without a cogitation of\r\nreflection, that there had been a discreet argument of economy at the\r\nbottom of the revolution which was brought to a criticism yesterday's\r\nafternoon.  Weel aware am I, that men in authority cannot appease and\r\nquell the inordinate concupiscence of the multitude, and that in a'\r\nstations of life there are persons who would mumpileese the retinue of\r\nthe king and government for their own behoof and eeteration, without any\r\nregard to the cause or effect of such manifest predilections.  But ye do\r\nme no more than a judicature, in supposing that, in this matter, I am\r\nhabituated wi' the best intentions.  For I can assure you, Mr Pawkie,\r\nthat no man in this community has a more literal respect for your\r\ncharacter than I have, or is more disposed for a judicious example of\r\ncontinence in the way of public enterteenment than I have ever been; for,\r\nas you know, I am of a constipent principle towards every extravagant and\r\ncostive outlay.  Therefore, on my own account, I had a satisfaction at\r\nseeing the abridgement which you made of our former inebrieties; but\r\nthere are other persons of a conjugal nature, who look upon such\r\ncastrations as a deficiency of their rights, and the like of them will\r\nfind fault with the best procedures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Mr Peevie,\" said I, \"that's very true; but if his Majesty's\r\ngovernment, in this war for all that is dear to us as men and Britons,\r\nwish us, who are in authority under them, to pare and save, in order that\r\nthe means of bringing the war to a happy end may not be wasted, an\r\nexample must be set, and that example, as a loyal subject and a\r\nmagistrate, it's my intent so to give, in the hope and confidence of\r\nbeing backed by every person of a right way of thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no to be deputed, Provost Pawkie,\" replied my friend, somewhat\r\npuzzled by what I had said; \"it's no to be deputed, that we live in a\r\ngigantic vortex, and that every man is bound to make an energetic\r\ndispensation for the good of his country; but I could not have thought\r\nthat our means had come to sic an alteration and extremity, as that the\r\nreverent homage of the Michaelmas dinners could have been enacted, and\r\ndeclared absolute and abolished, by any interpolation less than the\r\nomnipotence of parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not abolished, Mr Peevie,\" cried I, interrupting him; \"that would indeed\r\nbe a stretch of power.  No, no; I hope we're both ordained to partake of\r\nmany a Michaelmas dinner thegether yet; but with a meted measure of\r\nsobriety.  For we neither live in the auld time nor the golden age, and\r\nit would not do now for the like of you and me, Mr Peevie, to be seen in\r\nthe dusk of the evening, toddling home from the town-hall wi' goggling\r\neen and havering tongues, and one of the town-officers following at a\r\ndistance in case of accidents; sic things ye ken, hae been, but nobody\r\nwould plead for their continuance.\"\r\n\r\nMr Peevie did not relish this, for in truth it came near his own doors,\r\nit having been his annual practice for some years at the Michaelmas\r\ndinner to give a sixpence to James Hound, the officer, to see him safe\r\nhome, and the very time before he had sat so long, that honest James was\r\nobligated to cleek and oxter him the whole way; and in the way home, the\r\nold man, cagie with what he had gotten, stood in the causey opposite to\r\nMr M'Vest's door, then deacon of the taylors, and trying to snap his\r\nfingers, sang like a daft man,\r\n\r\n   'The sheets they were thin and the blankets were sma',\r\n   And the taylor fell through the bed, thimble and a'.\"\r\n\r\nSo that he was disconcerted by my innuendo, and shortly after left the\r\nshop, I trow, with small inclination to propagate any sedition against\r\nme, for the abbreviation I had made of the Michaelmas galravitching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV--THE CHURCH VACANT\r\n\r\n\r\nI had long been sensible that, in getting Mr Pittle the kirk, I had acted\r\nwith the levity and indiscretion of a young man; but at that time I\r\nunderstood not the nature of public trust, nor, indeed, did the community\r\nat large.  Men in power then ruled more for their own ends than in these\r\nlatter times; and use and wont sanctioned and sanctified many doings,\r\nfrom the days of our ancestors, that, but to imagine, will astonish and\r\nstartle posterity.  Accordingly, when Mr Pittle, after a lingering\r\nillness, was removed from us, which happened in the first year of my\r\nthird provostry, I bethought me of the consequences which had ensued from\r\nhis presentation, and resolved within myself to act a very different part\r\nin the filling up of the vacancy.  With this intent, as soon as the\r\nbreath was out of his body, I sent round for some of the most weighty and\r\nbest considered of the councillors and elders, and told them that a great\r\ntrust was, by the death of the minister, placed in our hands, and that,\r\nin these times, we ought to do what in us lay to get a shepherd that\r\nwould gather back to the establishment the flock which had been scattered\r\namong the seceders, by the feckless crook and ill-guiding of their former\r\npastor.\r\n\r\nThey all agreed with me in this, and named one eminent divine after\r\nanother; but the majority of voices were in favour of Dr Whackdeil of\r\nKirkbogle, a man of weight and example, both in and out the pulpit, so\r\nthat it was resolved to give the call to him, which was done accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt however came out that the Kirkbogle stipend was better than ours, and\r\nthe consequence was, that having given the call, it became necessary to\r\nmake up the deficiency; for it was not reasonable to expect that the\r\nreverend doctor, with his small family of nine children, would remove to\r\nus at a loss.  How to accomplish this was a work of some difficulty, for\r\nthe town revenues were all eaten up with one thing and another; but upon\r\nan examination of the income, arising from what had been levied on the\r\nseats for the repair of the church, it was discovered that, by doing away\r\na sinking fund, which had been set apart to redeem the debt incurred for\r\nthe same, and by the town taking the debt on itself, we could make up a\r\nsufficiency to bring the doctor among us.  And in so far as having an\r\northodox preacher, and a very excellent man for our minister, there was\r\ngreat cause to be satisfied with that arrangement.\r\n\r\nBut the payment of the interest on the public debt, with which the town\r\nwas burdened, began soon after to press heavily on us, and we were\r\nobligated to take on more borrowed money, in order to keep our credit,\r\nand likewise to devise ways and means, in the shape of public\r\nimprovements, to raise an income to make up what was required.  This led\r\nme to suggest the building of the new bridge, the cost of which, by\r\ncontract, there was no reason to complain of, and the toll thereon, while\r\nthe war lasted, not only paid the interest of the borrowed money by which\r\nit was built, but left a good penny in the nook of the treasurer's box\r\nfor other purposes.\r\n\r\nHad the war continued, and the nation to prosper thereby as it did,\r\nnobody can doubt that a great source of wealth and income was opened to\r\nthe town; but when peace came round, and our prosperity began to fall\r\noff, the traffic on the bridge grew less and less, insomuch that the\r\ntoll, as I now understand, (for since my resignation, I meddle not with\r\npublic concerns,) does not yield enough to pay the five per cent on the\r\nprime cost of the bridge, by which my successors suffer much molestation\r\nin raising the needful money to do the same.  However, every body\r\ncontinues well satisfied with Dr Whackdeil, who was the original cause of\r\nthis perplexity; and it is to be hoped that, in time, things will grow\r\nbetter, and the revenues come round again to idemnify the town for its\r\npresent tribulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV--THE STRAMASH IN THE COUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have said, my third provostry was undertaken in a spirit of\r\nsincerity, different in some degree from that of the two former; but\r\nstrange and singular as it may seem, I really think I got less credit for\r\nthe purity of my intents, than I did even in the first.  During the whole\r\nterm from the election in the year 1813 to the Michaelmas following, I\r\nverily believe that no one proposal which I made to the council was\r\nconstrued in a right sense; this was partly owing to the repute I had\r\nacquired for canny management, but chiefly to the perverse views and\r\nmisconceptions of that Yankee thorn-in-the-side, Mr Hickery, who never\r\ndesisted from setting himself against every thing that sprang from me,\r\nand as often found some show of plausibility to maintain his\r\nargumentations.  And yet, for all that, he was a man held in no esteem or\r\nrespect in the town; for he had wearied every body out by his everlasting\r\ncontradictions.  Mr Plan was likewise a source of great tribulation to\r\nme; for he was ever and anon coming forward with some new device, either\r\nfor ornament or profit, as he said, to the burgh; and no small portion of\r\nmy time, that might have been more advantageously employed, was wasted in\r\nthe thriftless consideration of his schemes: all which, with my advanced\r\nyears, begat in me a sort of distaste to the bickerings of the council\r\nchamber; so I conferred and communed with myself, anent the possibility\r\nof ruling the town without having recourse to so unwieldy a vehicle as\r\nthe wheels within wheels of the factions which the Yankee reformator, and\r\nthat projectile Mr Plan, as he was called by Mr Peevie, had inserted\r\namong us.\r\n\r\nI will no equivocate that there was, in this notion, an appearance of\r\ntaking more on me than the laws allowed; but then my motives were so\r\nclean to my conscience, and I was so sure of satisfying the people by the\r\nmethods I intended to pursue, that there could be no moral fault in the\r\ntrifle of illegality which, may be, I might have been led on to commit.\r\nHowever, I was fortunately spared from the experiment, by a sudden change\r\nin the council.--One day Mr Hickery and Mr Plan, who had been for years\r\ncolleaguing together for their own ends, happened to differ in opinion,\r\nand the one suspecting that this difference was the fruit of some secret\r\ncorruption, they taunted each other, and came to high words, and finally\r\nto an open quarrel, actually shaking their neeves across the table, and,\r\nI'll no venture to deny, maybe exchanging blows.\r\n\r\nSuch a convulsion in the sober councils of a burgh town was never heard\r\nof.  It was a thing not to be endured, and so I saw at the time, and was\r\nresolved to turn it to the public advantage.  Accordingly, when the two\r\nangry men had sat back in their seats, bleached in the face with passion,\r\nand panting and out of breath, I rose up in my chair at the head of the\r\ntable, and with a judicial solemnity addressed the council, saying, that\r\nwhat we had witnessed was a disgrace not to be tolerated in a Christian\r\nland; that unless we obtained indemnity for the past, and security for\r\nthe future, I would resign; but in doing so I would bring the cause\r\nthereof before the Fifteen at Edinburgh, yea, even to the House of Lords\r\nat London; so I gave the offending parties notice, as well as those who,\r\nfrom motives of personal friendship, might be disposed to overlook the\r\ninsult that had been given to the constituted authority of the king, so\r\nimperfectly represented in my person, as it would seem, by the audacious\r\nconflict and misdemeanour which had just taken place.\r\n\r\nThis was striking while the iron was hot: every one looked at my\r\nsternness with surprise, and some begged me to be seated, and to consider\r\nthe matter calmly.--\"Gentlemen,\" quo' I, \"dinna mistake me.  I never was\r\nin more composure all my life.--It's indeed no on my own account that I\r\nfeel on this occasion.  The gross violation of all the decent decorum of\r\nmagisterial authority, is not a thing that affects me in my own person;\r\nit's an outrage against the state; the prerogatives of the king's crown\r\nare endamaged; atonement must be made, or punishment must ensue.  It's a\r\nthing that by no possibility can be overlooked: it's an offence committed\r\nin open court, and we cannot but take cognizance thereof.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that what I said was operating to an effect, and that the two\r\ntroublesome members were confounded.  Mr Hickery rose to offer some\r\napology; but, perceiving I had now got him in a girn, I interposed my\r\nauthority, and would not permit him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Hickery,\" said I, \"it's of no use to address yourself to me.  I am\r\nvery sensible that ye are sorry for your fault; but that will not do.  The\r\nlaw knows no such thing as repentance; and it is the law, not me nor our\r\nworthy friends here, that ye have offended.  In short, Mr Hickery, the\r\nmatter is such that, in one word, either you and Mr Plan must quit your\r\nseats at this table of your own free-will, or I must quit mine, and mine\r\nI will not give up without letting the public know the shame on your part\r\nthat has compelled me.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down and I sat down; and for some time the other councillors\r\nlooked at one another in silence and wonder.  Seeing, however, that my\r\ngentle hint was not likely to be taken, I said to the town-clerk, who was\r\nsitting at the bottom of the table,\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it's your duty to make a minute of everything that is done and said\r\nat the sederunts of the council; and as provost, I hereby require of you\r\nto record the particularities of this melancholy crisis.\"\r\n\r\nMr Keelevine made an endeavour to dissuade me; but I set him down with a\r\nstern voice, striking the table at the same time with all my birr, as I\r\nsaid, \"Sir, you have no voice here.  Do you refuse to perform what I\r\norder?  At your peril I command the thing to be done.\"\r\n\r\nNever had such austerity been seen in my conduct before.  The whole\r\ncouncil sat in astonishment; and Mr Keelevine prepared his pen, and took\r\na sheet of paper to draw out a notation of the minute, when Mr Peevie\r\nrose, and after coughing three times, and looking first at me and syne at\r\nthe two delinquents, said--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord Provost, I was surprised, and beginning to be confounded, at the\r\nexplosion which the two gentlemen have committed.  No man can designate\r\nthe extent of such an official malversation, demonstrated, as it has been\r\nhere, in the presence of us all, who are the lawful custodiers of the\r\nkingly dignity in this his majesty's royal burgh.  I will, therefore, not\r\ntake it upon me either to apologise or to obliviate their offence; for,\r\nindeed, it is an offence that merits the most condign animadversion, and\r\nthe consequences might be legible for ever, were a gentleman, so\r\nconspicable in the town as you are, to evacuate the magistracy on account\r\nof it.  But it is my balsamic advice, that rather than promulgate this\r\nmatter, the two malcontents should abdicate, and that a precept should be\r\nplacarded at this sederunt as if they were not here, but had resigned and\r\nevaded their places, precursive to the meeting.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I answered, that no one could suspect me of wishing to push the\r\nmatter further, provided the thing could be otherwise settled; and\r\ntherefore, if Mr Plan and Mr Hickery would shake hands, and agree never\r\nto notice what had passed to each other, and the other members and\r\nmagistrates would consent likewise to bury the business in oblivion, I\r\nwould agree to the balsamic advice of Mr Peevie, and even waive my\r\nobligation to bind over the hostile parties to keep the king's peace, so\r\nthat the whole affair might neither be known nor placed upon record.\r\n\r\nMr Hickery, I could discern, was rather surprised; but I found that I had\r\nthus got the thief in the wuddy, and he had no choice; so both he and Mr\r\nPlan rose from their seats in a very sheepish manner, and looking at us\r\nas if they had unpleasant ideas in their minds, they departed forth the\r\ncouncil-chamber; and a minute was made by the town-clerk that they,\r\nhaving resigned their trust as councillors, two other gentlemen at the\r\nnext meeting should be chosen into their stead.\r\n\r\nThus did I, in a manner most unexpected, get myself rid and clear of the\r\ntwo most obdurate oppositionists, and by taking care to choose discreet\r\npersons for their successors, I was enabled to wind the council round my\r\nfinger, which was a far more expedient method of governing the community\r\nthan what I had at one time meditated, even if I could have brought it to\r\na bearing.  But, in order to understand the full weight and importance of\r\nthis, I must describe how the choice and election was made, because, in\r\norder to make my own power and influence the more sicker, it was\r\nnecessary that I should not be seen in the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI--THE NEW COUNCILLORS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Peevie was not a little proud of the part he had played in the storm\r\nof the council, and his words grew, if possible, longer-nebbit and more\r\nkittle than before, in so much that the same evening, when I called on\r\nhim after dusk, by way of a device to get him to help the implementing of\r\nmy intents with regard to the choice of two gentlemen to succeed those\r\nwhom he called \"the expurgated dislocators,\" it was with a great\r\ndifficulty that I could expiscate his meaning.  \"Mr Peevie,\" said I, when\r\nwe were cozily seated by ourselves in his little back parlour--the\r\nmistress having set out the gardevin and tumblers, and the lass brought\r\nin the hot water--\"I do not think, Mr Peevie, that in all my experience,\r\nand I am now both an old man and an old magistrate, that I ever saw any\r\nthing better managed than the manner in which ye quelled the hobleshow\r\nthis morning, and therefore we maun hae a little more of your balsamic\r\nadvice, to make a' heal among us again; and now that I think o't, how has\r\nit happent that ye hae never been a bailie?  I'm sure it's due both to\r\nyour character and circumstance that ye should take upon you a portion of\r\nthe burden of the town honours.  Therefore, Mr Peevie, would it no be a\r\nvery proper thing, in the choice of the new councillors, to take men of a\r\nfriendly mind towards you, and of an easy and manageable habit of will.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was mightily taken with this insinuation, and acknowledged\r\nthat it would give him pleasure to be a bailie next year.  We then\r\ncannily proceeded, just as if one thing begat another, to discourse anent\r\nthe different men that were likely to do as councillors, and fixed at\r\nlast on Alexander Hodden the blanket merchant, and Patrick Fegs the\r\ngrocer, both excellent characters of their kind.  There was not, indeed,\r\nin the whole burgh at the time, a person of such a flexible easy nature\r\nas Mr Hodden; and his neighbour, Mr Fegs, was even better, for he was so\r\ngood-tempered, and kindly, and complying, that the very callants at the\r\ngrammar school had nicknamed him Barley-sugar Pate.\r\n\r\n\"No better than them can be,\" said I to Mr Peevie; \"they are likewise\r\nboth well to do in the world, and should be brought into consequence; and\r\nthe way o't canna be in better hands than your own.  I would, therefore,\r\nrecommend it to you to see them on the subject, and, if ye find them\r\nwilling, lay your hairs in the water to bring the business to a bearing.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we settled to speak of it as a matter in part decided, that\r\nMr Hodden and Mr Fegs were to be the two new councillors; and to make the\r\nthing sure, as soon as I went home I told it to Mrs Pawkie as a state\r\nsecret, and laid my injunctions on her not to say a word about it, either\r\nto Mrs Hodden or to Mrs Fegs, the wives of our two elect; for I knew her\r\ndisposition, and that, although to a certainty not a word of the fact\r\nwould escape from her, yet she would be utterly unable to rest until she\r\nhad made the substance of it known in some way or another; and, as I\r\nexpected, so it came to pass.  She went that very night to Mrs Rickerton,\r\nthe mother of Mr Feg's wife, and, as I afterwards picked out of her, told\r\nthe old lady that may be, ere long, she would hear of some great honour\r\nthat would come to her family, with other mystical intimations that\r\npointed plainly to the dignities of the magistracy; the which, when she\r\nhad returned home, so worked upon the imagination of Mrs Rickerton, that,\r\nbefore going to bed, she felt herself obliged to send for her daughter,\r\nto the end that she might be delivered and eased of what she had heard.\r\nIn this way Mr Fegs got a foretaste of what had been concerted for his\r\nadvantage; and Mr Peevie, in the mean time, through his helpmate, had, in\r\nlike manner, not been idle; the effect of all which was, that next day,\r\nevery where in the town, people spoke of Mr Hodden and Mr Fegs as being\r\nordained to be the new councillors, in the stead of the two who had, as\r\nit was said, resigned in so unaccountable a manner, so that no candidates\r\noffered, and the election was concluded in the most candid and agreeable\r\nspirit possible; after which I had neither trouble nor adversary, but\r\nwent on, in my own prudent way, with the works in hand--the completion of\r\nthe new bridge, the reparation of the tolbooth steeple, and the bigging\r\nof the new schools on the piece of ground adjoining to my own at the\r\nWestergate; and in the doing of the latter job I had an opportunity of\r\nmanifesting my public spirit; for when the scheme, as I have related, was\r\nsome years before given up, on account of Mr Plan's castles in the air\r\nfor educating tawny children from the East and West Indies, I inclosed my\r\nown ground, and built the house thereon now occupied by Collector\r\nGather's widow, and the town, per consequence, was not called on for one\r\npenny of the cost, but saved so much of a wall as the length of mine\r\nextended--a part not less than a full third part of the whole.  No doubt,\r\nall these great and useful public works were not done without money; but\r\nthe town was then in great credit, and many persons were willing and\r\nready to lend; for every thing was in a prosperous order, and we had a\r\nprospect of a vast increase of income, not only from the toll on the new\r\nbridge, but likewise from three very excellent shops which we repaired on\r\nthe ground floor of the tolbooth.  We had likewise feued out to advantage\r\na considerable portion of the town moor; so that had things gone on in\r\nthe way they were in my time, there can be no doubt that the burgh would\r\nhave been in very flourishing circumstances, and instead of being\r\ndrowned, as it now is, in debt, it might have been in the most topping\r\nway; and if the project that I had formed for bringing in a supply of\r\nwater by pipes, had been carried into effect, it would have been a most\r\nadvantageous undertaking for the community at large.\r\n\r\nBut my task is now drawing to an end; and I have only to relate what\r\nhappened at the conclusion of the last act of my very serviceable and\r\neventful life, the which I will proceed to do with as much brevity as is\r\nconsistent with the nature of that free and faithful spirit in which the\r\nwhole of these notandums have been indited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII--THE RESIGNATION\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the Battle of Waterloo, I began to see that a change was\r\ncoming in among us.  There was less work for the people to do, no outgate\r\nin the army for roving and idle spirits, and those who had tacks of the\r\ntown lands complained of slack markets; indeed, in my own double vocation\r\nof the cloth shop and wine cellar, I had a taste and experience of the\r\ngeneral declension that would of a necessity ensue, when the great outlay\r\nof government and the discharge from public employ drew more and more to\r\nan issue.  So I bethought me, that being now well stricken in years, and,\r\nthough I say it that should not, likewise a man in good respect and\r\ncircumstances, it would be a prudent thing to retire and secede entirely\r\nfrom all farther intromissions with public affairs.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, towards the midsummer of the year 1816, I commenced in a far\r\noff way to give notice, that at Michaelmas I intended to abdicate my\r\nauthority and power, to which intimations little heed was at first given;\r\nbut gradually the seed took with the soil, and began to swell and shoot\r\nup, in so much that, by the middle of August, it was an understood thing\r\nthat I was to retire from the council, and refrain entirely from the part\r\nI had so long played with credit in the burgh.\r\n\r\nWhen people first began to believe that I was in earnest, I cannot but\r\nacknowledge I was remonstrated with by many, and that not a few were\r\npleased to say my resignation would be a public loss; but these\r\nexpressions, and the disposition of them, wore away before Michaelmas\r\ncame; and I had some sense of the feeling which the fluctuating gratitude\r\nof the multitude often causes to rise in the breasts of those who have\r\nettled their best to serve the ungrateful populace.  However, I\r\nconsidered with myself that it would not do for me, after what I had done\r\nfor the town and commonality, to go out of office like a knotless thread,\r\nand that, as a something was of right due to me, I would be committing an\r\nact of injustice to my family if I neglected the means of realizing the\r\nsame.  But it was a task of delicacy, and who could I prompt to tell the\r\ntown-council to do what they ought to do?  I could not myself speak of my\r\nown services--I could ask nothing.  Truly it was a subject that cost me\r\nno small cogitation; for I could not confide it even to the wife of my\r\nbosom.  However, I gained my end, and the means and method thereof may\r\nadvantage other public characters, in a similar strait, to know and\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nSeeing that nothing was moving onwards in men's minds to do the act of\r\ncourtesy to me, so justly my due, on the Saturday before Michaelmas I\r\ninvited Mr Mucklewheel, the hosier, (who had the year before been chosen\r\ninto the council, in the place of old Mr Peevie, who had a paralytic, and\r\nnever in consequence was made a bailie,) to take a glass of toddy with\r\nme, a way and method of peutering with the councillors, one by one, that\r\nI often found of a great efficacy in bringing their understandings into a\r\ndocile state; and when we had discussed one cheerer with the usual\r\nclishmaclaver of the times, I began, as we were both birzing the sugar\r\nfor the second, to speak with a circumbendibus about my resignation of\r\nthe trusts I had so long held with profit to the community.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Mucklewheel,\" quo' I \"ye're but a young man, and no versed yet, as ye\r\nwill be, in the policy and diplomatics that are requisite in the\r\nmanagement of the town, and therefore I need not say any thing to you\r\nabout what I have got an inkling of, as to the intents of the new\r\nmagistrates and council towards me.  It's very true that I have been long\r\na faithful servant to the public, but he's a weak man who looks to any\r\nreward from the people; and after the experience I have had, I would\r\ncertainly prove myself to be one of the very weakest, if I thought it was\r\nlikely, that either anent the piece of plate and the vote of thanks, any\r\nbody would take a speciality of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr Mucklewheel answered, that he was glad to hear such a\r\ncompliment was intended; \"No man,\" said he, \"more richly deserves a\r\nhandsome token of public respect, and I will surely give the proposal all\r\nthe countenance and support in my power possible to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to that,\" I replied, pouring in the rum and helping myself to the\r\nwarm water, \"I entertain no doubt, and I have every confidence that the\r\nproposal, when it is made, will be in a manner unanimously approved.  But,\r\nMr Mucklewheel, what's every body's business, is nobody's.  I have heard\r\nof no one that's to bring the matter forward; it's all fair and smooth to\r\nspeak of such things in holes and corners, but to face the public with\r\nthem is another sort of thing.  For few men can abide to see honours\r\nconferred on their neighbours, though between ourselves, Mr Mucklewheel,\r\nevery man in a public trust should, for his own sake, further and promote\r\nthe bestowing of public rewards on his predecessors; because looking\r\nforward to the time when he must himself become a predecessor, he should\r\nthink how he would feel were he, like me, after a magistracy of near to\r\nfifty years, to sink into the humility of a private station, as if he had\r\nnever been any thing in the world.  In sooth, Mr Mucklewheel, I'll no\r\ndeny that it's a satisfaction to me to think that may be the piece of\r\nplate and the vote of thanks will be forthcoming; at the same time,\r\nunless they are both brought to a bearing in a proper manner, I would\r\nrather nothing was done at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye may depend on't,\" said Mr Mucklewheel, \"that it will be done very\r\nproperly, and in a manner to do credit both to you and the council.  I'll\r\nspeak to Bailie Shuttlethrift, the new provost, to propose the thing\r\nhimself, and that I'll second it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hooly, hooly, friend,\" quo' I, with a laugh of jocularity, no\r\nill-pleased to see to what effect I had worked upon him; \"that will never\r\ndo; ye're but a greenhorn in public affairs.  The provost maun ken\r\nnothing about it, or let on that he doesna ken, which is the same thing,\r\nfor folk would say that he was ettling at something of the kind for\r\nhimself, and was only eager for a precedent.  It would, therefore, ne'er\r\ndo to speak to him.  But Mr Birky, who is to be elected into the council\r\nin my stead, would be a very proper person.  For ye ken coming in as my\r\nsuccessor, it would very naturally fall to him to speak modestly of\r\nhimself compared with me, and therefore I think he is the fittest person\r\nto make the proposal, and you, as the next youngest that has been taken\r\nin, might second the same.\"\r\n\r\nMr Mucklewheel agreed with me, that certainly the thing would come with\r\nthe best grace from my successor.\r\n\r\n\"But I doubt,\" was my answer, \"if he kens aught of the matter; ye might\r\nhowever enquire.  In short, Mr Mucklewheel, ye see it requires a canny\r\nhand to manage public affairs, and a sound discretion to know who are the\r\nfittest to work in them.  If the case were not my own, and if I was\r\nspeaking for another that had done for the town what I have done, the\r\ntask would be easy.  For I would just rise in my place, and say as a\r\nthing of course, and admitted on all hands, 'Gentlemen, it would be a\r\nvery wrong thing of us, to let Mr Mucklewheel, (that is, supposing you\r\nwere me,) who has so long been a fellow-labourer with us, to quit his\r\nplace here without some mark of our own esteem for him as a man, and some\r\ntestimony from the council to his merits as a magistrate.  Every body\r\nknows that he has been for near to fifty years a distinguished character,\r\nand has thrice filled the very highest post in the burgh; that many great\r\nimprovements have been made in his time, wherein his influence and wisdom\r\nwas very evident; I would therefore propose, that a committee should be\r\nappointed to consider of the best means of expressing our sense of his\r\nservices, in which I shall be very happy to assist, provided the provost\r\nwill consent to act as chairman.'\r\n\r\n\"That's the way I would open the business; and were I the seconder, as\r\nyou are to be to Mr Birky, I would say,\r\n\r\n\"'The worthy councillor has but anticipated what every one was desirous\r\nto propose, and although a committee is a very fit way of doing the thing\r\nrespectfully, there is yet a far better, and that is, for the council now\r\nsitting to come at once to a resolution on the subject, then a committee\r\nmay be appointed to carry that resolution into effect.'\r\n\r\n\"Having said this, you might advert first to the vote of thanks, and then\r\nto the piece of plate, to remain with the gentleman's family as a\r\nmonumental testimony of the opinion which was entertained by the\r\ncommunity of his services and character.\"\r\n\r\nHaving in this judicious manner primed Mr Mucklewheel as to the\r\nprocedure, I suddenly recollected that I had a letter to write to catch\r\nthe post, and having told him so, \"Maybe,\" quo' I, \"ye would step the\r\nlength of Mr Birky's and see how he is inclined, and by the time I am\r\ndone writing, ye can be back; for after all that we have been saying, and\r\nthe warm and friendly interest you have taken in this business, I really\r\nwould not wish my friends to stir in it, unless it is to be done in a\r\nsatisfactory manner.\"\r\n\r\nMr Mucklewheel accordingly went to Mr Birky, who had of course heard\r\nnothing of the subject, but they came back together, and he was very\r\nvogie with the notion of making a speech before the council, for he was\r\nan upsetting young man.  In short, the matter was so set forward, that,\r\non the Monday following, it was all over the town that I was to get a\r\npiece of plate at my resignation, and the whole affair proceeded so well\r\nto an issue, that the same was brought to a head to a wish.  Thus had I\r\nthe great satisfaction of going to my repose as a private citizen with a\r\nvery handsome silver cup, bearing an inscription in the Latin tongue, of\r\nthe time I had been in the council, guildry, and magistracy; and\r\nalthough, in the outset of my public life, some of my dealings may have\r\nbeen leavened with the leaven of antiquity, yet, upon the whole, it will\r\nnot be found, I think, that, one thing weighed with another, I have been\r\nan unprofitable servant to the community.  Magistrates and rulers must\r\nrule according to the maxims and affections of the world; at least,\r\nwhenever I tried any other way, strange obstacles started up in the\r\nopinions of men against me, and my purest intents were often more\r\ncriticised than some which were less disinterested; so much is it the\r\nnatural humour of mankind to jealouse and doubt the integrity of all\r\nthose who are in authority and power, especially when they see them\r\ndeviating from the practices of their predecessors.  Posterity,\r\ntherefore, or I am far mistaken, will not be angered at my plain dealing\r\nwith regard to the small motives of private advantage of which I have\r\nmade mention, since it has been my endeavour to show and to acknowledge,\r\nthat there is a reforming spirit abroad among men, and that really the\r\nworld is gradually growing better--slowly I allow; but still it is\r\ngrowing better, and the main profit of the improvement will be reaped by\r\nthose who are ordained to come after us.",
