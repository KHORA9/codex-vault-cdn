About \"After the Rain\"\r\n\r\nEU and NATO - The Competing Alliances\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nSaturday's vote in Ireland was the second time in 18 months that its\r\nincreasingly disillusioned citizenry had to decide the fate of the\r\nEuropean Union by endorsing or rejecting the crucial Treaty of Nice.\r\nThe treaty seeks to revamp the union's administration and the hitherto\r\nsacred balance between small and big states prior to the accession of\r\n10 central and east European countries. Enlargement has been the\r\ncenterpiece of European thinking ever since the meltdown of the eastern\r\nbloc.\r\n\r\nShifting geopolitical and geo-strategic realities in the wake of the\r\nSeptember 11 atrocities have rendered this project all the more urgent.\r\nNATO - an erstwhile anti-Soviet military alliance is search of purpose\r\n- is gradually acquiring more political hues. Its remit has swelled to\r\ntake in peacekeeping, regime change, and nation-building.\r\n\r\nLed by the USA, it has expanded aggressively into central and northern\r\nEurope. It has institutionalized its relationships with the countries\r\nof the Balkan through the \"Partnership for Peace\" and with Russia\r\nthrough a recently established joint council. The Czech Republic,\r\nPoland, and Hungary - the eternal EU candidates - have full scale\r\nmembers of NATO for 3 years now.\r\n\r\nThe EU responded by feebly attempting to counter this worrisome\r\nimbalance of influence with a Common Foreign and Security Policy and a\r\nrapid deployment force. Still, NATO's chances of replacing the EU as\r\nthe main continental political alliance are much higher than the EU's\r\nchances of substituting for NATO as the pre-eminent European military\r\npact. the EU is hobbled by minuscule and decreasing defense spending by\r\nits mostly pacifistic members and by the backwardness of their armed\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThat NATO, under America's thumb, and the vaguely anti-American EU are\r\nat cross-purposes emerged during the recent spat over the International\r\nCriminal Court. Countries, such as Romania, were asked to choose\r\nbetween NATO's position - immunity for American soldiers on\r\ninternational peacekeeping missions - and the EU's (no such thing).\r\nFinally - and typically - the EU backed down. But it was a close call\r\nand it cast in sharp relief the tensions inside the Atlantic\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\nAs far as the sole superpower is concerned, the strategic importance of\r\nwestern Europe has waned together with the threat posed by a\r\ndilapidated Russia. Both south Europe and its northern regions are\r\nemerging as pivotal. Airbases in Bulgaria are more useful in the fight\r\nagainst Iraq than airbases in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Bosnia - with its al-Qaida's presence - are more\r\npressing than those of France. Turkey and its borders with central Asia\r\nand the middle east is of far more concern to the USA than\r\ndisintegrating Belgium. Russia, a potentially newfound ally, is more\r\nmission-critical than grumpy Germany.\r\n\r\nThus, enlargement would serve to enhance the dwindling strategic\r\nrelevance of the EU and heal some of the multiple rifts with the USA -\r\non trade, international affairs (e.g., Israel), defense policy, and\r\ninternational law. But this is not the only benefit the EU would derive\r\nfrom its embrace of the former lands of communism.\r\n\r\nFaced with an inexorably ageing populace and an unsustainable system of\r\nsocial welfare and retirement benefits, the EU is in dire need of young\r\nimmigrants. According to the United Nations Population Division, the EU\r\nwould need to import 1.6 million migrant workers annually to maintain\r\nits current level of working age population. But it would need to\r\nabsorb almost 14 million new, working age, immigrants per year just to\r\npreserve a stable ratio of workers to pensioners.\r\n\r\nEastern Europe - and especially central Europe - is the EU's natural\r\nreservoir of migrant labor. It is ironic that xenophobic and\r\nanti-immigration parties hold the balance of power in a continent so\r\ndependent on immigration for the survival of its way of life and\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe internal, common, market of the EU has matured. Its growth rate has\r\nleveled off and it has developed a mild case of deflation. In previous\r\ncenturies, Europe exported its excess labor and surplus capacity to its\r\ncolonies - an economic system known as \"mercantilism\".\r\n\r\nThe markets of central, southern, and eastern Europe - West Europe's\r\nhinterland - are replete with abundant raw materials and dirt-cheap,\r\nthough well-educated, labor. As indigenous purchasing power increases,\r\nthe demand for consumer goods and services will expand.\r\n\r\nThus, the enlargement candidates can act both as a sink for Europe's\r\nproduction and the root of its competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the sheer weight of their agricultural sectors and the\r\nbackwardness of their infrastructure can force a reluctant EU to reform\r\nits inanely bloated farm and regional aid subsidies, notably the Common\r\nAgricultural Policy. That the EU cannot afford to treat the candidates\r\nto dollops of subventioary largesse as it does the likes of France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, and Greece is indisputable. But even a much-debated\r\nphase-in period of 10 years would burden the EU's budget - and the\r\npatience of its member states and denizens - to an acrimonious breaking\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe countries of central and eastern Europe are new consumption and\r\ninvestment markets. With a total of 300 million people (Russia\r\ncounted), they equal the EU's population - though not its much larger\r\npurchasing clout. They are likely to while the next few decades on a\r\nsteep growth curve, catching up with the West. Their proximity to the\r\nEU makes them ideal customers for its goods and services. They could\r\nprovide the impetus for a renewed golden age of European economic\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nCentral and eastern Europe also provide a natural land nexus between\r\nwest Europe and Asia and the Middle East. As China and India grow in\r\neconomic and geopolitical importance, an enlarged Europe will find\r\nitself in the profitable role of an intermediary between east and west.\r\n\r\nThe wide-ranging benefits to the EU of enlargement are clear,\r\ntherefore. What do the candidate states stand to gain from their\r\naccession? The answer is: surprisingly little.\r\n\r\nAll of them already enjoy, to varying degrees, unfettered, largely\r\nduty-free, access to the EU. To belong, a few - like Estonia - would\r\nhave to dismantle a much admired edifice of economic liberalism.\r\n\r\nMost of them would have to erect barriers to trade and the free\r\nmovement of labor and capital where none existed. All of them would be\r\nforced to encumber their fragile economies with tens of thousands of\r\npages of prohibitively costly labor, intellectual property rights,\r\nfinancial, and environmental regulation. None stands to enjoy the same\r\nbenefits as do the more veteran members - notably in agricultural and\r\nregional development funds.\r\n\r\nJoining the EU would deliver rude economic and political shocks to the\r\ncandidate countries. A brutal and rather sudden introduction of\r\ncompetition in hitherto much-sheltered sectors of the economy, giving\r\nup recently hard-won sovereignty, shouldering the debilitating cost of\r\nthe implementation of  reams of guideline, statutes, laws, decrees, and\r\ndirectives, and being largely powerless to influence policy outcomes.\r\nFaced with such a predicament, some countries may even reconsider.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN IRAQ\r\n\r\nThe Euro-Atlantic Divide\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nThe countries of central and east Europe - especially those slated to\r\njoin the European Union (EU) in May next year - are between the\r\nAmerican rock and the European hard place. The Czech republic, Hungary\r\nand Poland, already NATO members, have joined Spain, Britain and other\r\nEU veterans in signing the \"letter of eight\" in support of US policy in\r\nthe Gulf. NATO and EU aspirants - including most of the nations of the\r\nBalkans - followed suit in a joint statement of the Vilnius Group.\r\n\r\nThe denizens of the region wonder what is meant by \"democracy\" when\r\ntheir own governments so blithely ignore public opinion, resolutely set\r\nagainst the looming conflict. The heads of these newly independent\r\npolities counter by saying that leaders are meant to mold common\r\nperceptions, not merely follow them expediently. The mob opposed the\r\nwar against Hitler, they remind us, somewhat non-germanely.\r\n\r\nBut the political elite of Europe is, indeed, divided.\r\n\r\nFrance is trying to reassert its waning authority over an increasingly\r\nunruly and unmanageably expanding European Union. Yet, the new members\r\ndo not share its distaste for American hegemony.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, they regard it as a guarantee of their own security.\r\nThey still fear the Russians, France's and Germany's new found allies\r\nin the \"Axis of Peace\" (also known as the Axis of Weasels).\r\n\r\nThe Czechs, for instance, recall how France (and Britain) sacrificed\r\nthem to Nazi Germany in 1938 in the name of realpolitik and the\r\npreservation of peace. They think that America is a far more reliable\r\nsponsor of their long-term safety and prosperity than the fractured\r\nEuropean \"Union\".\r\n\r\nTheir dislike of what they regard as America's lightweight leadership\r\nand overt - and suspect - belligerence notwithstanding, the central and\r\neast Europeans are grateful to the United States for its unflinching -\r\nand spectacularly successful - confrontation with communism.\r\n\r\nFrance and Germany - entangled in entente and Ostpolitik, respectively\r\n- cozied up to the Kremlin, partly driven by their Euro-communist\r\nparties. So did Italy. While the Europeans were busy kowtowing to a\r\nrepressive USSR and castigating the USA for its warmongering, America\r\nhas liberated the Soviet satellites and bankrolled their painful and\r\nprotracted transition.\r\n\r\nHistorical debts aside, America is a suzerain and, as such, it is\r\nirresistible. Succumbing to the will of a Big Power is the rule in east\r\nand central Europe. The nations of the region have mentally substituted\r\nthe United States for the Soviet Union as far as geopolitics are\r\nconcerned. Brussels took the place of Moscow with regards to economic\r\nissues. The Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, assorted Balkanians, even the\r\nBalts - have merely switched empires.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons for these countries' pro-Americanism. The\r\nnations of central, east and southeast (Balkans) Europe have sizable\r\nand economically crucial diasporas in the united States. They admire\r\nand consume American technology and pop culture. Trade with the USA and\r\nforeign direct investment are still small but both are growing fast.\r\n\r\nThough the EU is the new and aspiring members' biggest trading partner\r\nand foreign investor - it has, to borrow from Henry Kissinger, no\r\n\"single phone number\". While France is enmeshed in its Byzantine\r\nmachinations, Spain and Britain are trying to obstruct the ominous\r\nre-emergence of French-German dominance.\r\n\r\nBy catering to popular aversion of America's policies, Germany's\r\nbeleaguered Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, is attempting to score\r\npoints domestically even as the German economy is imploding.\r\n\r\nThe euro-Atlantic structures never looked worse. The European Union is\r\nboth disunited and losing its European character. NATO has long been a\r\ndysfunctional alliance in search of a purpose. For a while, Balkan\r\nskirmishes provided it with a new lease on life. But now the\r\nEuro-Atlantic alliance has become the Euro-Atlantic divide.\r\n\r\nThe only clear, consistent and cohesive voice is America's. The new\r\nmembers of NATO are trying to demonstrate their allegiance - nay,\r\nobsequiousness - to the sole identifiable leader of the free world.\r\n\r\nFrance's bid at European helmsmanship failed because both it and Russia\r\nare biased in favor of the current regime in Iraq. French and Russian\r\nfirms have signed more than 1700 commercial contracts with Saddam's\r\nmurderous clique while their British and American competitors were\r\nexcluded by the policies of their governments.\r\n\r\nWhen sanctions against Iraq are lifted - and providing Saddam or his\r\nhand-picked successor are still in place - Russian energy behemoths are\r\npoised to explore and extract billions of barrels of oil worth dozens\r\nof billions of dollars. Iraq owes Russia $9 billion which Russia wants\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nBut the United States would be mistaken to indulge in Schadenfreude or\r\nto gleefully assume that it has finally succeeded in isolating the\r\ninsolent French and the somnolent Germans. Public opinion - even where\r\nit carries little weight, like in Britain, or in the Balkans - cannot\r\nbe ignored forever.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all the countries of Europe share real concerns about the\r\nstability of the Middle East. A divided Iraq stands to unsettle\r\nneighbours near and far. Turkey has a large Kurdish minority as does\r\nIran. Conservative regimes in the Gulf fear Iraq's newfound and\r\nAmerican-administered democracy. In the wake of an American attack on\r\nIraq, Islamic fundamentalism and militancy will surely surge and lead\r\nto a wave of terror. Europe has vested historical, economic and\r\ngeopolitical interests in the region, unlike America.\r\n\r\nPersistent, unmitigated support for the USA in spite of French-German\r\nexhortations will jeopardize the new and aspiring members' position in\r\nan enlarged EU. Accession is irreversible but they can find themselves\r\nisolated and marginalized in decision making processes and dynamics\r\nlong after the Iraqi dust has settled. EU officials already gave public\r\nwarnings to this effect.\r\n\r\nIt is  grave error to assume that France and Germany have lost their\r\npivotal role in the EU. Britain and Spain are second rank members -\r\nBritain by Europhobic choice and Spain because it is too small to\r\nreally matter. Russia - a smooth operator - chose to side with France\r\nand Germany, at least temporarily. The new and aspiring members would\r\nhave done well to follow suit.\r\n\r\nInstead, they have misconstrued the signs of the gathering storm: the\r\nemerging European rapid deployment force and common foreign policy; the\r\nrapprochement between France and Germany at the expense of the\r\npro-American but far less influential Britain, Italy and Spain; the\r\nconstitutional crisis setting European federalists against traditional\r\nnationalists; the growing rupture between \"Old Europe\" and the American\r\n\"hyperpower\".\r\n\r\nThe new and aspiring members of NATO and the EU now face a moment of\r\ntruth and are being forced to reveal their hand. Are they pro-American,\r\nor pro-German (read: pro federalist Europe)? Where and with whom do\r\nthey see a common, prosperous future? What is the extent of their\r\ncommitment to the European Union, its values and its agenda?\r\n\r\nThe proclamations of the European eight (including the three central\r\nEuropean candidates) and the Vilnius Ten must have greatly disappointed\r\nGermany - the unwavering sponsor of EU enlargement. Any further\r\nflagrant siding with the United States against the inner core of the EU\r\nwould merely compound those errors of judgment. The EU can punish the\r\nrevenant nations of the communist bloc with the same dedication and\r\neffectiveness with which it has hitherto rewarded them.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN IRAQ\r\n\r\nBulgaria - The Quiet American\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nLast week, Bulgaria, currently sitting on the Security Council, was one\r\nof ten east and southeast European countries - known as the Vilnius\r\nGroup - to issue a strongly worded statement in support of the United\r\nStates' attempt to disarm Iraq by military means. This followed a\r\nsimilar, though much milder, earlier statement by eight other European\r\nnations, including Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, the EU's\r\nprospective members in central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Vilnius Ten - including Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia,\r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia - called\r\nthe evidence presented to the Security Council by Colin Powell, the US\r\nSecretary of State - \"compelling\". Iraq posed a \"clear and present\r\ndanger\" - they concluded.\r\n\r\nBulgaria and Romania pledged free access to their air spaces and\r\nterritorial waters. The first US military plane has landed today in the\r\nSafarovo airport in the Black Sea city of Burgas in Bulgaria. Other\r\nmembers are poised to provide medical staff, anti-mine units and\r\nchemical protection gear.\r\n\r\nSuch overt obsequiousness did not go unrewarded.\r\n\r\nDays after the common statement, the IMF - considered by some to be a\r\nlong arm of America's foreign policy - clinched a standby arrangement\r\nwith Macedonia, the first in two turbulent years. On the same day,\r\nBulgaria received glowing - and counterfactual - reviews from yet\r\nanother IMF mission, clearing the way for the release of a  tranche of\r\n$36 million out of a loan of $330 million.\r\n\r\nPartly in response, six members of parliament from the ruling Simeon II\r\nnational Movement joined with four independents to form the National\r\nIdeal for Unity. According to Novinite.com, a Bulgarian news Web site,\r\nthey asserted that \"the new political morale was seriously harmed\" and\r\n\"accused the government of inefficient economic program of the\r\ngovernment that led to the bad economic situation in the country.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the joint Vilnius Group declaration, Albania, Croatia,\r\nBulgaria and Macedonia received private and public assurances that\r\ntheir NATO applications now stand a better chance. Bulgaria started the\r\nsecond round of negotiations with the military alliance yesterday and\r\nexpects to become full member next year. The head of the US Committee\r\non NATO Enlargement Bruce Jackson stated: \"I'm sure that Bulgaria has\r\nhelped itself very much this week.\"\r\n\r\nYet, the recent rift in NATO (over Turkish use of the Alliance's\r\ndefense assets) pitted Germany, France and Belgium against the rest of\r\nthe organization and opposite other EU member states. It casts in doubt\r\nthe wisdom of the Vilnius Group's American gambit. The countries of\r\ncentral and east Europe may admire the United States and its superpower\r\nclout - but, far more vitally, they depend on Europe, economically as\r\nwell as politically.\r\n\r\nEven put together, these polities are barely inconsequential. They are\r\npresumptuous to assume the role of intermediaries between a\r\ndisenchanted Franco-German Entente Cordiale and a glowering America.\r\nNor can they serve as \"US Ambassadors\" in the European corridors of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe European Union absorbs two thirds of their exports and three\r\nquarters of their immigrants. Europe accounts for nine tenths of\r\nforeign direct investment in the region and four fifths of aid. For the\r\nlikes of the Czech Republic and Croatia to support the United states\r\nagainst Germany is nothing short of economic suicide.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the United States is a demanding master. It tends to\r\nmicromanage and meddle in everything, from election outcomes to\r\ninter-ethnic relations. James Purdew, America's ambassador to Sofia and\r\na veteran Balkan power broker, spent the last few weeks exerting\r\npressure on the Bulgarian government, in tandem with the aforementioned\r\nBruce Jackson, to oust the country's Prosecutor General and reinstate\r\nthe (socialist) head of the National Investigation Services.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is already by far the most heavily enmeshed in US military\r\noperations in Asia. It served as a launch pad for US planes during the\r\nAfghanistan campaign in 2001-2. It stands to be affected directly by\r\nthe looming war.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is on the route of illicit immigration from Iraq, Palestine\r\nand Iran, via Turkey, to Greece and therefrom to the EU. Last Friday\r\nalone, it detained 43 Iraqi refugees caught cruising Sofia in two\r\nTurkish trucks on the way to the Greek border.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Interior admitted that it expects a \"massive flow of\r\n(crossing) refugees\" if an armed conflict were to erupt.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Finance, Milen Velchev, intends to present to the\r\nCouncil of Ministers detailed damage scenarios based on a hike in the\r\nprice of oil to $40 per barrel and a 3-4 months long confrontation. He\r\nadmitted to the Bulgarian National Radio that inflation is likely to\r\nincrease by at least 1-1.5 percentage points.\r\n\r\nThe daily cost of a single 150-member biological and chemical defense\r\nunit stationed in the Gulf would amount to $15,000, or c. $500,000 per\r\nmonth, said the Bulgarian news agency, BTA. The Minister of Defense,\r\nNikolai Svinarov, told the Cabinet that he expects \"maximum (American)\r\nfunding and logistical support\" for the Bulgarian troops. The United\r\nStates intends to base c. 400 soldiers-technicians and 18 planes on the\r\ncountry's soil and will pay for making use of the infrastructure, as\r\nthey have done during operation \"Enduring Freedom\" (the war in\r\nAfghanistan).\r\n\r\nBulgaria stands to benefit in other ways. The country's Deputy Foreign\r\nMinister, Lyubomir Ivanov, confirmed in another radio interview that\r\nthe Americans pledged that Iraqi debts to Bulgaria will be fully paid.\r\nThis can amount to dozens of millions of US dollars in fresh money.\r\n\r\nIs this Bulgaria's price? Unlikely. Bulgaria, like the other countries\r\nof the region, regards America as the first among equals in NATO. The\r\nEU is perceived in east Europe as a toothless, though rich, club,\r\ncorrupted by its own economic interests and inexorably driven by its\r\nbloated bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThe EU and its goodwill and stake in the region are taken for granted -\r\nwhile America has to be constantly appeased and mollified.\r\n\r\nStill, the members of the Vilnius Groups have misconstrued the signs of\r\nthe gathering storm: the emerging European rapid deployment force and\r\ncommon foreign policy; the rapprochement between France and Germany at\r\nthe expense of the pro-American but far less influential Britain, Italy\r\nand Spain; the constitutional crisis setting European federalists\r\nagainst traditional nationalists; the growing rupture between \"Old\r\nEurope\" and the American \"hyperpower\".\r\n\r\nThe new and aspiring members of NATO and the EU now face a moment of\r\ntruth and are being forced to reveal their hand. Are they pro-American,\r\nor pro-German (read: pro federalist Europe)? Where and with whom do\r\nthey see a common, prosperous future? What is the extent of their\r\ncommitment to the European Union, its values and its agenda?\r\n\r\nThe proclamations of the European eight (including the three central\r\nEuropean candidates) and the Vilnius Ten must have greatly disappointed\r\nGermany - the unwavering sponsor of EU enlargement. Any further\r\nflagrant siding with the United States against the inner core of the EU\r\nwould merely compound those errors of judgment. The EU can punish the\r\nrevenant nations of the communist bloc with the same dedication and\r\neffectiveness with which it has hitherto rewarded them. Ask Israel, it\r\nshould know.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN IRAQ\r\n\r\nRussia Straddles the Euro-Atlantic Divide\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nThe Janus Look\r\n\r\nRussia's Second Empire\r\n\r\nRussian Roulette - The Security Apparatus\r\n\r\nRussia as a Creditor\r\n\r\nLet My People Go - The Jackson-Vanik Controversy\r\n\r\nThe Chechen Theatre Ticket\r\n\r\nRussia's Israeli Oil Bond\r\n\r\nRussia's Idled Spies\r\n\r\nRussia in 2003\r\n\r\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned on Tuesday, in an interview he\r\ngranted to TF1, a French television channel, that unilateral\r\nAmerican-British military action against Iraq would be a \"grave\r\nmistake\" and an \"unreasonable use of force\".\r\n\r\nRussia might veto it in the Security Council, he averred. In a joint\r\ndeclaration with France and Germany, issued the same day, he called to\r\nenhance the number of arms inspectors in Iraq as an alternative to war.\r\n\r\nOnly weeks ago Russia was written off, not least by myself, as a\r\nsatellite of the United States. This newfound assertiveness has\r\nconfounded analysts and experts everywhere. Yet, appearances aside, it\r\ndoes not signal a fundamental shift in Russian policy or worldview.\r\n\r\nRussia could not resist the temptation of playing once more the\r\nLeninist game of \"inter-imperialist contradictions\". It has long\r\nmasterfully exploited chinks in NATO's armor to further its own\r\neconomic, if not geopolitical, goals. Its convenient geographic sprawl\r\n- part Europe, part Asia - allows it to pose as both a continental\r\npower and a global one with interests akin to those of the United\r\nStates. Hence the verve with which it delved into the war against\r\nterrorism, recasting internal oppression and meddling abroad as its\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nAs Vladimir Lukin, deputy speaker of the Duma observed recently,\r\nBritain having swerved too far towards America - Russia may yet become\r\nan intermediary between a bitterly disenchanted USA and an irked Europe\r\nand between the rich, industrialized West and developing countries in\r\nAsia. Publicly, the USA has only mildly disagreed with Russia's\r\nreluctance to countenance a military endgame in Iraq - while showering\r\nFrance and Germany with vitriol for saying, essentially, the same\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe United States knows that Russia will not jeopardize the relevance\r\nof the Security Council - one of the few remaining hallmarks of past\r\nSoviet grandeur - by vetoing an American-sponsored resolution. But\r\nRussia cannot be seen to be abandoning a traditional ally and a major\r\ncustomer (Iraq) and newfound friends (France and Germany) too\r\nexpediently.\r\n\r\nNor can Putin risk further antagonizing Moscow hardliners who already\r\nregard his perceived \"Gorbachev-like\" obsequiousness and far reaching\r\nconcessions to the USA as treasonous. The scrapping of the Anti\r\nBallistic Missile treaty, the expansion of NATO to Russia's borders,\r\nAmerica's presence in central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia's \"near\r\nabroad\" - are traumatic reversals of fortune.\r\n\r\nAn agreed consultative procedure with the crumbling NATO hardly\r\nqualifies as ample compensation. There are troubling rumblings of\r\ndiscontent in the army. A few weeks ago, a Russian general in Chechnya\r\nrefused Putin's orders publicly - and with impunity. Additionally,\r\naccording to numerous opinion polls, the vast majority of Russians\r\noppose an Iraqi campaign.\r\n\r\nBy aligning itself with the fickle France and the brooding and\r\nsomnolent Germany, Russia is warning the USA that it should not be\r\ntaken for granted and that there is a price to pay for its allegiance\r\nand good services. But Putin is not Boris Yeltsin, his inebriated\r\npredecessor who over-played his hand in opposing NATO's operation in\r\nKosovo in 1999 - only to be sidelined, ignored and humiliated in the\r\npostwar arrangements.\r\n\r\nRussia wants a free hand in Chechnya and to be heard on international\r\nissues. It aspires to secure its oil contracts in Iraq - worth tens of\r\nbillions of dollars - and the repayment of $9 billion in old debts by\r\nthe postbellum government. It seeks pledges that the oil market will\r\nnot be flooded by a penurious Iraq. It desires a free hand in Ukraine,\r\nArmenia and Uzbekistan, among others. Russia wants to continue to sell\r\n$4 billion a year in arms to China, India, Iran, Syria and other\r\npariahs unhindered.\r\n\r\nOnly the United States, the sole superpower, can guarantee that these\r\ndemands are met. Moreover, with a major oil producer such as Iraq as a\r\nUS protectorate, Russia becomes a hostage to American goodwill. Yet,\r\nhitherto, all Russia received were expression of sympathy, claimed\r\nValeri Fyodorov, director of Political Friends, an independent Russian\r\nthink-tank, in an interview in the Canadian daily, National Post.\r\n\r\nThese are not trivial concerns. Russia's is a primitive economy, based\r\non commodities - especially energy products - and an over-developed\r\nweapons industry. Its fortunes fluctuate with the price of oil, of\r\nagricultural produce and with the need for arms, driven by regional\r\nconflicts.\r\n\r\nShould the price of oil collapse, Russia may again be forced to resort\r\nto multilateral financing, a virtual monopoly of the long arms of US\r\nforeign policy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The USA\r\nalso has a decisive voice in the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nmembership thereof being a Russian strategic goal.\r\n\r\nIt was the United States which sponsored Russia's seat at table of the\r\nG8 - the Group of Eight industrialized states - a much coveted\r\nreassertion of the Russian Federation's global weight. According to\r\nRossiiskaya Gazeta, a Russian paper, the USA already announced a week\r\nago that it is considering cutting Russia off American financial aid -\r\nprobably to remind the former empire who is holding the purse strings.\r\n\r\nBut siding with America risks alienating the all-important core of\r\nEurope: Germany and France. Europe - especially Germany - is Russia's\r\nlargest export destination and foreign investor. Russia is not\r\noblivious to that. It would like to be compensated generously by the\r\nUnited States for assuming such a hazard.\r\n\r\nStill, Europe is a captive of geography and history. It has few\r\nfeasible alternatives to Russian gas, for instance. As the recent $7\r\nbillion investment by British Petroleum proves, Russia - and, by\r\nextension, central and east Europe - is Europe's growth zone and\r\nnatural economic hinterland.\r\n\r\nYet, it is America that captures the imagination of Russian oligarchs\r\nand lesser businesses.\r\n\r\nRussia aims to become the world's largest oil producer within the\r\ndecade. With this in mind, it is retooling its infrastructure and\r\ninvesting in new pipelines and ports.\r\n\r\nThe United States is aggressively courted by Russian officials and\r\n\"oiligarchs\" - the energy tycoons. With the Gulf states cast in the\r\nrole of anti-American Islamic militants, Russia emerges as a sane and\r\nsafe - i.e., rationally driven by self-interest - alternative supplier\r\nand a useful counterweight to an increasingly assertive and federated\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nRussia's affinity with the United States runs deeper that the\r\nconfluence of commercial interests.\r\n\r\nRussian capitalism is far more \"Anglo-Saxon\" than Old Europe's. The\r\nFederation has an educated but cheap and abundant labor force, a patchy\r\nwelfare state, exportable natural endowments, a low tax burden and a\r\npressing need for unhindered inflows of foreign investment.\r\n\r\nRussia's only hope of steady economic growth is the expansion of its\r\nenergy behemoths abroad. Last year it has become a net foreign direct\r\ninvestor. It has a vested interest in globalization and world order\r\nwhich coincide with America's. China, for instance, is as much Russia's\r\npotential adversary as it is the United State's.\r\n\r\nRussia welcomed the demise of the Taliban and is content with regime\r\nchanges in Iraq and North Korea - all American exploits. It can - and\r\ndoes - contribute to America's global priorities. Collaboration between\r\nthe two countries' intelligence services has never been closer. Hence\r\nalso the thaw in Russia's relations with its erstwhile foe, Israel.\r\n\r\nRussia's population is hungry and abrasively materialistic. Its robber\r\nbarons are more American in spirit than any British or French\r\nentrepreneur. Russia's business ethos is reminiscent of 19th century\r\nfrontier America, not of 20th century staid Germany.\r\n\r\nRussia is driven by kaleidoscopically shifting coalitions within a\r\nnarrow elite, not by its masses - and the elite wants money, a lot of\r\nit and now. In Russia's unbreakable cycle,  money yields power which\r\nleads to more money. The country is a functioning democracy but\r\nelections there do not revolve around the economy. Most taxes are\r\nevaded by most taxpayers and half the gross national product is anyhow\r\nunderground. Ordinary people crave law and order - or, at least a\r\nsemblance thereof.\r\n\r\nHence Putin's rock idol popularity. He caters to the needs of the elite\r\nby cozying up to the West and, in particular, to America - even as he\r\nprovides the lower classes with a sense of direction and security they\r\nlacked since 1985. But Putin is a serendipitous president. He enjoys\r\nthe aftereffects of a sharply devalued, export-enhancing,\r\nimports-depressing ruble and the vertiginous tripling of oil prices,\r\nRussia's main foreign exchange generator.\r\n\r\nThe last years of Yeltsin have been so traumatic that the bickering\r\ncogs and wheels of Russia's establishment united behind the only\r\nvote-getter they could lay their hands on: Putin, an obscure politician\r\nand former KGB officer. To a large extent, he proved to be an agreeable\r\npuppet, concerned mostly with self-preservation and the imaginary\r\nprojection of illusory power.\r\n\r\nPutin's great asset is his pragmatism and realistic assessment of the\r\nshambles that Russia has become and of his own limitations. He has\r\nturned himself into a kind of benevolent and enlightened arbiter among\r\nfeuding interests - and as the merciless and diligent executioner of\r\nthe decisions of the inner cabals of power.\r\n\r\nHitherto he kept everyone satisfied. But Iraq is his first real test.\r\nEveryone demands commitments backed by actions. Both the Europeans and\r\nthe Americans want him to put his vote at the Security Council where\r\nhis mouth is. The armed services want him to oppose war in Iraq. The\r\nintelligence services are divided. The Moslem population inside Russia\r\n- and surrounding it on all sides - is restive and virulently\r\nanti-American.\r\n\r\nThe oil industry is terrified of America' domination of the world's\r\nsecond largest proven reserves - but also craves to do business in the\r\nUnited States. Intellectuals and Russian diplomats worry about\r\nAmerica's apparent disregard for the world order spawned by the horrors\r\nof World War II. The average Russian regards the Iraqi stalemate as an\r\ninternal American affair. \"It is not our war\", is a common refrain,\r\ngrowing commoner.\r\n\r\nPutin has played it admirably nimbly. Whether he ultimately succeeds in\r\nthis impossible act of balancing remains to be seen. The smart money\r\nsays he would. But if the last three years have taught us anything it\r\nis that the smart money is often disastrously wrong.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN IRAQ\r\n\r\nGermany's Rebellious Colonies\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nThe EU and NATO - The Competing Alliances\r\n\r\nThe Skoda Model\r\n\r\nThe Czechs' Indian Gambit\r\n\r\nEurope's Four Speeds\r\n\r\nSwitching Empires\r\n\r\nEastern Advantages\r\n\r\nInvited by a grateful United States, the Czech Republic on Saturday\r\nsent a representative to meet with Iraqi opposition in Kurdish north\r\nIraq. The country was one of the eight signatories on a letter,\r\nco-signed by Britain, Italy, Spain and the two other European Union\r\ncentral European candidate-members, Poland and Hungary, in support of\r\nUS policy in the Gulf.\r\n\r\nAccording to The Observer and the New York Times, American troops in\r\nGermany - and the billions of dollars in goods and services they\r\nconsume locally - will be moved further east to the Czech Republic,\r\nPoland and the Baltic states. This shift may have come regardless of\r\nthe German \"betrayal\". The Pentagon has long been contemplating the\r\nfutility of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the world's\r\nmost peaceful and pacifistic country.\r\n\r\nThe letter is a slap in the face of Germany, a member of the \"Axis of\r\nPeace\", together with France and Belgium and the champion of EU\r\nenlargement to the east. Its own economic difficulties aside, Germany\r\nis the region's largest foreign investor and trading partner. Why the\r\ncurious rebuff by its ostensible protgs?\r\n\r\nThe Czech Republic encapsulates many of the economic and political\r\ntrends in the erstwhile communist swathe of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe country's economic performance still appears impressive. Figures\r\nreleased yesterday reveal a surge of 6.6 percent in industrial\r\nproduction, to yield an annual increase of 4.8 percent. Retail sales,\r\nthough way below expectations, were still up 2.7 percent last year. The\r\nCzech National Bank (CNB) upgraded its gross domestic product growth\r\nforecast on Jan 30 to 2.2-3.5 percent.\r\n\r\nBut the country is in the throes of a deflationary cycle. The producer\r\nprice index was down 0.8 percent last year. Year on year, it decreased\r\nby 0.4 percent in January. Export prices are down 6.7 percent, though\r\nimport prices fell by even more thus improving the country's terms of\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe Czech koruna is unhealthily overvalued against the euro thus\r\njeopardizing any export-led recovery. The CNB was forced to intervene\r\nin the foreign exchange market and buy in excess of 2 billion euros\r\nlast year - four times the amount it did in 2001. It also cut its\r\ninterest rates last month to their nadir since independence. This did\r\nlittle to dent the country's burgeoning current account deficit, now at\r\nover 5 percent of GDP.\r\n\r\nUnemployment in January broke through the psychologically crucial\r\nbarrier of 10 percent of the workforce. More than 540,000 bread earners\r\n(in a country of 10 million inhabitants) are out of a job. In some\r\nregions every fifth laborer is laid off. There are more than 13 - and\r\nin the worst hit parts, more than 100 - applicants per every position\r\nopen .\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the country is bracing itself for another bout of floods,\r\nmore devastating than last year's and the ones in 1997. Each of the\r\nprevious inundations caused in excess of $2 billion in damages. The\r\ngovernment's budget is already strained to a breaking point with a\r\nprojected deficit of 6.3 percent this year, stabilizing at between 4\r\nand 6.6 percent in 2006. The situation hasn't been this dire since the\r\ntoppling of communism in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.\r\n\r\nIronically, these bad tidings are mostly the inevitable outcomes of\r\nmuch delayed reforms, notably privatization. Four fifths of the\r\ncountry's economy is alleged to be in private hands - a rate similar to\r\nthe free markets of Estonia, Slovakia and Hungary. In reality, though,\r\nthe state still maintains intrusive involvement in many industrial\r\nassets. It is the reluctant unwinding of these holdings that leads to\r\nmass layoffs.\r\n\r\nYet, the long term outlook is indisputably bright.\r\n\r\nThe ministry of finance forecasts a rise in the country's GDP from 59\r\npercent to 70 percent of the European Union's output in 2005 -\r\ncomparable to Slovenia and far above Poland with a mere 40 percent. The\r\nCzech Republic is preparing itself to join the eurozone shortly after\r\nit becomes a member of the EU in May 2004.\r\n\r\nForeign investors are gung ho. The country is now the prime investment\r\ndestination among the countries in transition. In a typical daily\r\noccurrence, bucking a global trend, Matsushita intends to expand its\r\ntelevision factory in Plzen. Its investment of $8 million will enhance\r\nthe plant's payroll by one tenth to 1900 workers. Siemens - a German\r\nmultinational - is ploughing $50 million into its Czech unit. Siemens\r\nElektromotory's 3000 employees export $130 million worth of electrical\r\nengines annually.\r\n\r\nNone of this would have been possible without Germany's vote of\r\nconfidence and overwhelming economic presence in the Czech Republic.\r\nThe deteriorating fortunes of the Czech economy are, indeed, intimately\r\nlinked to the economic stagnation of its northern neighbor, as many an\r\neconomist bemoan. But this only serves to prove that the former's\r\nrecovery is dependent on the latter's resurrection.\r\n\r\nEither way, to have so overtly and blatantly abandoned Germany in its\r\ntime of need would surely prove to be a costly miscalculation. The\r\nCzechs - like other central and east European countries - mistook a\r\ntransatlantic tiff for a geopolitical divorce and tried to implausibly\r\ncapitalize on the yawning rift that opened between the erstwhile allies.\r\n\r\nYet, Germany is one of the largest trading partners of the United\r\nStates. American firms sell $24 billion worth of goods annually there -\r\ncompared to $600 million in Poland. Germany's economy is five to six\r\ntimes the aggregated output of the EU's central European new members\r\nplus Slovakia.\r\n\r\nAccording to the New York Times, there are 1800 American firms on\r\nGerman soil, with combined sales of $583 billion and a workforce of\r\n800,000 people. Due to its collapsing competitiveness and rigid labor\r\nlaws, Germany's multinationals relocate many of their operations to\r\ncentral and east Europe, Asia and north and Latin America. Even with\r\nits current malaise, Germany invested in 2001 $43 billion abroad and\r\nattracted $32 billion in fresh foreign capital.\r\n\r\nIndeed, supporting the United States was seen by the smaller countries\r\nof the EU as a neat way to counterbalance Germany's worrisome economic\r\nmight and France's often self-delusional aspirations at helmsmanship. A\r\nstring of unilateral dictates by the French-German duo to the rest of\r\nthe EU - regarding farm subsidies and Europe's constitution, for\r\ninstance - made EU veterans and newcomers alike edgy. Hence the\r\ndeliberate public snub.\r\n\r\nStill, grandstanding apart, the nations of central Europe know how\r\nill-informed are recent claims in various American media that their\r\nregion is bound to become the new European locomotive in lieu of an\r\naging and self preoccupied Germany. The harsh truth is that there is no\r\ncentral European economy without Germany. And, at this stage, there is\r\nno east European economy, period.\r\n\r\nConsider central Europe's most advanced post-communist economy.\r\n\r\nOne third of Hungary's GDP, one half of its industrial production,\r\nthree quarters of industrial sales and nine tenths of its exports are\r\ngenerated by multinationals. Three quarters of the industrial sector is\r\nforeign-owned. One third of all foreign direct investment is German.\r\nFrance is the third largest investor. The situation is not much\r\ndifferent in the Czech Republic where the overseas sales of the\r\nGerman-owned Skoda alone account for one tenth the country's exports.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Germany and central Europe is mercantilistic.\r\nGermany leverages the region's cheap labor and abundant raw materials\r\nto manufacture and export its finished products. Central Europe\r\nconforms, therefore, to the definition of a colony and an economic\r\nhinterland. From a low base, growth there - driven by frenzied\r\nconsumerism - is bound to outstrip the northern giant's for a long time\r\nto come. But Germans stands to benefit from such prosperity no less\r\nthan the indigenous population.\r\n\r\nAware of this encroaching \"economic imperialism\", privatization deals\r\nwith German firms are being voted down throughout the region. In\r\nNovember, the sale of a majority stake in Cesky Telecom to a consortium\r\nled by Deutsche Bank collapsed. In Poland, a plan to sell Stoen,\r\nWarsaw's power utility, to Germany's RWE was scrapped.\r\n\r\nBut these are temporary - and often reversible - setbacks. Germany and\r\nits colonies share other interests. As The Economist noted correctly\r\nrecently:\r\n\r\n\"The Poles may differ with the French over security but they will be\r\nwith them in the battle to preserve farm subsidies. The Czechs and\r\nHungarians are less wary of military force than the Germans but\r\nsympathize with their approach to the EU's constitutional reform. In\r\ntruth, there are no more fixed and reliable alliances in the EU.\r\nCountries will team up with each other, depending on issue and\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nThus, the partners, Germany and central Europe, scarred and embittered,\r\nwill survive the one's haughty conduct and the other's backstabbing.\r\nThat the countries of Europe currently react with accommodation to\r\nwhat, only six decades ago, would have triggered war among them, may be\r\nthe greatest achievement of the Euro-Atlantic enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the West Lost the East\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\n Also Read\r\n\r\nThe Caveman and the Alien\r\n\r\nThe Expat Experts\r\n\r\nTo Give with Grace\r\n\r\nThe Pettifogger Procurators\r\n\r\nWhy is America Hated\r\n\r\nThe Pew Research Center published last week a report expansively titled\r\n\"What the World Thinks in 2002\". \"The World\", reduced to 44 countries\r\nand 38,000 interviewees, included 3500 respondent from central and east\r\nEurope: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovakia and\r\nUkraine. Uzbekistan stood in for the formerly Soviet central Asia. The\r\nTimes-Mirror 1991 survey, \"The Pulse of Europe\" was used as a benchmark.\r\n\r\nWith the implosion of communism in 1989 and the disintegration of the\r\nSoviet Union in 1991, large swathes of central and eastern Europe found\r\nthemselves devoid of an internal market, an economic sponsor, or a\r\nmilitary umbrella.\r\n\r\nThe countries of central Europe - from Slovenia to Hungary - and the\r\nBaltic dismissed the communist phase of their past as a \"historical\r\naccident\" and vigorously proceeded to seek integration with Western\r\nEurope, notably Germany, much as they have done until the rise of\r\nFascism in the 1930s.\r\n\r\nThe polities of eastern Europe bitterly divided into the \"nostalgics\"\r\nor \"reactionary\" versus the \"European\", or \"progressive\". The first lot\r\n- including Russia, Ukraine and Belarus - sought to resurrect an\r\neconomic incarnation of the former USSR. The latter - notably Poland -\r\nreclassified themselves as \"central Europeans\" and emulated the likes\r\nof the Czech republic and Hungary in a desperate bid to curry favor\r\nwith the European Union and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Pew report reveals that the concerns of the denizens of central and\r\neast Europe are varied but closely aligned with the global agenda. In\r\nthis sense, the iron curtain has, indeed, lifted and total integration\r\nhas been achieved despite massive economic disparities. The publics of\r\nthe former Soviet Bloc place surprisingly great emphasis on the\r\nenvironment, for instance - hitherto thought to be a preoccupation of\r\ntheir more affluent neighbours to the west.\r\n\r\nConsider the war on terrorism.\r\n\r\nPeople in Russia are vehemently opposed to the use of force to dislodge\r\nSaddam Hussein. They regard the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a\r\ngreater threat to peace in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nThey are convinced that the USA is bent on war in the Gulf to secure\r\nits oil sources. Europe is likely to pay the price, say the Russians,\r\nby becoming a target for international terrorism.\r\n\r\nYet, in a sweeping reversal of sentiment, Russians now regard the world\r\nas safer with a single superpower. In Uzbekistan, whose crumbling\r\neconomy has enjoyed a fillip from the presence of 1500 US troops,\r\nsupport for America's military campaigns is understandably high.\r\n\r\nYet, the most startling and unambiguous revelation was the extent of\r\nanti-American groundswell everywhere: among America's NATO allies, in\r\ndeveloping countries, Muslim nations and even in eastern Europe where\r\nAmericans, only a decade ago were perceived as much-adulated\r\nliberators. \"People around the world embrace things American and, at\r\nthe same time, decry U.S. influence on their societies. Similarly,\r\npluralities in most of the nations surveyed complain about American\r\nunilateralism.\"- expounds the report.\r\n\r\nThe image of the Unites States as a benign world power slipped\r\ndramatically in the space of two years in Slovakia (down 14 percent),\r\nin Poland (-7), in the Czech Republic (-6) and even in fervently\r\npro-Western Bulgaria (-4 percent). But it rose exponentially in Ukraine\r\n(up 10 percent) and, most astoundingly, in Russia (+24 percent, albeit\r\nfrom a very low base).\r\n\r\nStill, rising anti-Americanism may have more to do with a nonspecific\r\nwave of gloom and dysphoria than with concrete American policies.\r\n\"People who are less well off economically are more likely than those\r\nwho are more financially secure to dislike the U.S.\" - says the report.\r\n\r\nOnly two fifths of Czechs are satisfied with their own life or with the\r\nstate of their nation. Three quarters are unhappy with the world at\r\nlarge. The figures are even way lower in Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine.\r\nOnly Uzbeks are content, probably for want of knowing better.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, less than one fifth are at ease with their life, their\r\ncountry, or the world. Bulgaria takes the prize: a mere 8 percent of\r\nBulgarians find their life gratifying. One in twenty five Bulgarians is\r\noptimistic regarding his or her nation. One in eight approves of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nEast Germans are far more pessimistic than the Wessies, their brethren\r\nin the western Lander. East European are exceedingly displeased with\r\ntheir income, though they find their family lives agreeable and, in the\r\nlands of vertiginous unemployment levels, their jobs appealing.\r\n\r\nNine in ten Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Poles and Slovaks maintain a\r\nnegative view of their national economies. In Russia the figure is 83\r\npercent and even in the Czech Republic it is 60. Three quarters of east\r\nEuropeans surveyed - including east Germans - do not believe that\r\neconomic conditions will improve.\r\n\r\n\"Will my kids go hungry? Will they be stuck with my debts? ... It looks\r\nbad and it can only get worse. I mean, you can hope it will get better\r\nbut it does not look good\" - muses a forlorn 69-years old Polish farmer.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, these dismal figures reflect a rise in satisfaction\r\nthroughout the region since the demise of communism in 1989-91.\r\nSignificantly, the young are double as hopeful than those older than\r\n35. Between one third (Bulgaria, Czech Republic) and one half (Ukraine,\r\nSlovakia and Russia) of respondents of all age groups believe in a\r\nbetter future - far outweighing the pessimists. Only in Poland are the\r\nmajority of people are anxious for the future of their children.\r\n\r\nStill, \"while Eastern Europeans feel their lives are better off since\r\nthe collapse of communism, many say they have lost ground over the past\r\nfive years. A majority of Bulgarians (55%) believe their lives are\r\nworse today, as do pluralities in Ukraine, the Slovak Republic and\r\nPoland. Again, Czechs are the exception - 41% think they have made\r\nprogress while 27% believe they have lost ground. Russians are divided\r\non this point (37% say they have lost ground, 36% feel they have made\r\nprogress).\"\r\n\r\nPoverty is a potent depressant. The greater part of Russians and\r\nUkrainians reported that \"there have been times in the past year when\r\nthey had too little money to afford food\", medical care, or clothing.\r\nSo did half the Bulgarians, one third of the Poles and one sixth of\r\nSlovaks. Ninety-two percent of the Bulgarians interviewed identified\r\neconomic problems as having the most effect on their lives.\r\n\r\nSimilar figures obtained in Russia (85), Ukraine (79) and Poland (73).\r\nThese data are as bad as it gets. Senegal, Mali and Bangladesh are in\r\nthe same league. The situation is better in Slovakia (63 percent). At\r\n46 percent, the Czech Republic proved equal to the much richer United\r\nKingdom and United States.\r\n\r\nPeople everywhere do not blame their economic predicament on inapt\r\nadministrations, or on specific leaders. Vladimir Putin is much more\r\npopular in Russia than his cabinet but the government get good marks.\r\nThe leadership in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, suffered\r\nprecipitous drops in popularity since 1991. East Europeans - except the\r\nRussians - also rate the European Union higher than they do their own\r\nauthorities. In Slovakia the ratio is a whopping three to one.\r\n\r\nWith the notable exceptions of Ukraine and the Czech Republic, east\r\nEuropeans approve of their religious leaders. Ukrainians distrust their\r\nmilitary - but all other nationalities are fond of the armed forces.\r\nThe media and journalists are universally highly rated as positive\r\nsocial influences.\r\n\r\nRussians and Uzbeks are concerned about lack of housing. Health is a\r\nuniversal headache: two fifths of Russians, one third of Poles and\r\nCzechs and one quarter of Slovaks listed it as such. Central and east\r\nEuropean education still yields superior results so only one fifth of\r\nRussians find it worrying. Respondents from other countries in the\r\nregion did not.\r\n\r\nBetween two thirds and four fifths of the denizens of the\r\ncrime-infested societies of the countries in transition registered\r\ndelinquency as a major scourge, followed by corrupt political leaders,\r\nAIDS and disease, moral decline, poor drinking water, emigration, poor\r\nschooling, terrorism, immigration and ethnic conflict.\r\n\r\nEast Europeans are as xenophobic as their counterparts in the West.\r\nBetween half and three quarters of all respondents - fully 80 percent\r\nin the Czech Republic - thought that immigrants are a \"bad influence on\r\nthe country\". Only Bulgaria welcomes immigration by a wide margin. But\r\nnine of ten Bulgarians decry emigration - Bulgarians fleeing abroad.\r\nThree quarters do so in Slovakia, Ukraine, Poland and the former East\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIronically, the more xenophobic the society, the more concerned its\r\nmembers are with ethnic hatred. Almost three fifths of all Czechs\r\nidentify it as the major problem facing the world today. Other east\r\nEuropeans are equally worried by nuclear weapons, the gap between rich\r\nand poor, the environment and infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nThe survey reveals both the failure of transition and a decisive break\r\nbetween central and eastern Europe. The shared brief episode of\r\ncommunism failed to homogenize these parts of the continent. Central\r\nEurope - including Slovenia - with its history of industrial\r\ncapitalism, modern bureaucratic governance and the rule of law - is\r\nreverting to its historical default. It is being reintegrated into the\r\nEuropean mainstream.\r\n\r\nThe countries of east Europe - Poland included - are unable to catch\r\nup. Their transition is tortuous and unpopular among their subjects.\r\nTheir lot is, indeed, improving but glacially and imperceptibly. They\r\nare being left behind by a largely indifferent West. Their erstwhile\r\ncentral European co-inmates in the gulag of communism are now keen to\r\ndistance themselves. They are considered a drag and an embarrassment.\r\nTheir unquenched hopes for a better future are smothered by\r\ninsurmountable economic and social problems.\r\n\r\nEuropean enlargement is likely to stall after the first intake of 10\r\nnew members in 2004. Those left out in the cold are excluded for a long\r\nstretch. Rather than relying on the double panacea of NATO and the EU,\r\nthey would do well to start reforming themselves by bootstrapping.\r\nSurveys like these are timely reminders of this unpleasant reality.\r\n\r\nLeft and Right in a Divided Europe\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nEven as West European countries seemed to have edged to the right of\r\nthe political map - all three polities of central Europe lurched to the\r\nleft. Socialists were elected to replace economically successful right\r\nwing governments in Poland, Hungary and, recently, in the Czech\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThis apparent schism is, indeed, merely an apparition. The differences\r\nbetween reformed left and new right in both parts of the continent have\r\nblurred to the point of indistinguishability. French socialists have\r\nprivatized more than their conservative predecessors. The Tories still\r\ncomplain bitterly that Tony Blair, with his nondescript \"Third Way\",\r\nhas stolen their thunder.\r\n\r\nNor are the \"left\" and \"right\" ideologically monolithic and socially\r\nhomogeneous continental movements. The central European left is more\r\npreoccupied with a social - dare I say socialist - agenda than any of\r\nits Western coreligionists. Equally, the central European right is less\r\nindividualistic, libertarian, religious, and conservative than any of\r\nits Western parallels - and much more nationalistic and xenophobic. It\r\nsometimes echoes the far right in Western Europe - rather than the\r\ncenter-right, mainstream, middle-class orientated parties in power.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the right's victories in Western Europe - in Spain, Denmark,\r\nthe Netherlands, Italy - are not without a few important exceptions -\r\nnotably Britain and, perhaps, come September, Germany. Nor is the\r\nleft's clean sweep of the central European electoral slate either\r\ncomplete or irreversible. With the exception of the outgoing Czech\r\ngovernment, not one party in this volatile region has ever remained in\r\npower for more than one term. Murmurs of discontent are already audible\r\nin Poland and Hungary.\r\n\r\nLeft and right are imported labels with little explanatory power or\r\nrelevance to central Europe. To fathom the political dynamics of this\r\nregion, one must realize that the core countries of central Europe (the\r\nCzech Republic, Hungary and, to a lesser extent, Poland) experienced\r\nindustrial capitalism in the inter-war period. Thus, a political\r\ntaxonomy based on urbanization and industrialization may prove to be\r\nmore powerful than the classic left-right dichotomy.\r\n\r\nTHE RURAL versus THE URBAN\r\n\r\nThe enmity between the urban and the bucolic has deep historical roots.\r\nWhen the teetering Roman Empire fell to the Barbarians (410-476 AD),\r\nfive centuries of existential insecurity and mayhem ensued. Vassals\r\npledged allegiance and subservience to local lords in return for\r\nprotection against nomads and marauders. Trading was confined to\r\nfortified medieval cities.\r\n\r\nEven as it petered out in the west, feudalism remained entrenched in\r\nthe prolix codices and patents of the Habsburg Austro-Hungarian empire\r\nwhich encompassed central Europe and collapsed only in 1918.\r\n\r\nWell into the twentieth century, the majority of the denizens of these\r\nmoribund swathes of the continent worked the land. This feudal legacy\r\nof a brobdignagian agricultural sector in, for instance, Poland - now\r\nhampers the EU accession talks.\r\n\r\nVassals were little freer than slaves. In comparison, burghers, the\r\ninhabitants of the city, were liberated from the bondage of the feudal\r\nlabour contract. As a result, they were able to acquire private\r\npossessions and the city acted as supreme guarantor of their property\r\nrights. Urban centers relied on trading and economic might to obtain\r\nand secure political autonomy.\r\n\r\nJohn of Paris, arguably one of the first capitalist cities (at least\r\naccording to Braudel), wrote: \"(The individual) had a right to property\r\nwhich was not with impunity to be interfered with by superior authority\r\n- because it was acquired by (his) own efforts\" (in Georges Duby, \"The\r\nage of the Cathedrals: Art and Society, 980-1420, Chicago, Chicago\r\nUniversity Press, 1981). Max Weber, in his opus, \"The City\" (New York,\r\nMacMillan, 1958) wrote optimistically about urbanization: \"The medieval\r\ncitizen was on the way towards becoming an economic man ... the ancient\r\ncitizen was a political man\".\r\n\r\nBut communism halted this process. It froze the early feudal frame of\r\nmind of disdain and derision towards \"non-productive\", \"city-based\"\r\nvocations. Agricultural and industrial occupations were romantically\r\nextolled by communist parties everywhere. The cities were berated as\r\nhubs of moral turpitude, decadence and greed. Ironically, avowed\r\nanti-communist right wing populists, like Hungary's former prime\r\nminister, Orban, sought to propagate these sentiments, to their\r\nelectoral detriment.\r\n\r\nCommunism was an urban phenomenon - but it abnegated its \"bourgeoisie\"\r\npedigree. Private property was replaced by communal ownership.\r\nServitude to the state replaced individualism. Personal mobility was\r\nseverely curtailed. In communism, feudalism was restored.\r\n\r\nVery like the Church in the Middle Ages, communism sought to monopolize\r\nand permeate all discourse, all thinking, and all intellectual\r\npursuits. Communism was characterized by tensions between party, state\r\nand the economy - exactly as the medieval polity was plagued by\r\nconflicts between church, king and merchants-bankers.\r\n\r\nIn communism, political activism was a precondition for advancement\r\nand, too often, for personal survival. John of Salisbury might as well\r\nhave been writing for a communist agitprop department when he penned\r\nthis in \"Policraticus\" (1159 AD): \"...if (rich people, people with\r\nprivate property) have been stuffed through excessive greed and if they\r\nhold in their contents too obstinately, (they) give rise to countless\r\nand incurable illnesses and, through their vices, can bring about the\r\nruin of the body as a whole\". The body in the text being the body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\nWorkers, both industrial and agricultural, were lionized and idolized\r\nin communist times. With the implosion of communism, these frustrated\r\nand angry rejects of a failed ideology spawned many grassroots\r\npolitical movements, lately in Poland, in the form of \"Self Defence\".\r\nTheir envied and despised enemies are the well-educated, the\r\nintellectuals, the self-proclaimed new elite, the foreigner, the\r\nminority, the rich, and the remote bureaucrat in Brussels.\r\n\r\nLike in the West, the hinterland tends to support the right. Orban's\r\nFidesz lost in Budapest in the recent elections - but scored big in\r\nvillages and farms throughout Hungary. Agrarian and peasant parties\r\nabound in all three central European countries and often hold the\r\nbalance of power in coalition governments.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG and THE NEW versus THE TIRED and THE TRIED\r\n\r\nThe cult of youth in central Europe was an inevitable outcome of the\r\nutter failure of older generations. The allure of the new and the\r\nuntried often prevailed over the certainty of the tried and failed.\r\nMany senior politicians, managers, entrepreneurs and journalists across\r\nthis region are in their 20's or 30's.\r\n\r\nYet, the inexperienced temerity of the young has often led to voter\r\ndisillusionment and disenchantment. Many among the young are too\r\nidentified with the pratfalls of \"reform\". Age and experience reassert\r\nthemselves through the ballot boxes - and with them the disingenuous\r\nhabits of the past. Many of the \"old, safe hands\" are former communists\r\ndisingenuously turned socialists turned democrats turned capitalists.\r\nAs even revolutionaries age, they become territorial and hidebound.\r\nTurf wars are likely to intensify rather then recede.\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNOCRATS / EXPERTS versus THE LOBBYIST-MANAGERS\r\n\r\nCommunist managers - always the quintessential rent-seekers - were\r\ntrained to wheedle politicians, lobby the state and  cadge for\r\nsubsidies and bailouts, rather than respond to market signals. As\r\ncommunism imploded, the involvement of the state in the economy - and\r\nthe resources it commanded - contracted. Multilateral funds are tightly\r\nsupervised. Communist-era \"directors\" - their skills made redundant by\r\nthese developments - were shockingly and abruptly confronted with\r\nmerciless market realities.\r\n\r\nPredictably they flopped and were supplanted by expert managers and\r\ntechnocrats, more attuned to markets and to profits, and committed to\r\ncompetition and other capitalistic tenets. The decrepit, \"privatized\"\r\nassets of the dying system expropriated by the nomenclature were soon\r\nacquired by foreign investors, or shut down. The old guard has\r\ndecisively lost its capital - both pecuniary and political.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties which relied on these cronies for contributions and\r\ninfluence-peddling - are in decline. Those that had the foresight to\r\ndetach themselves from the venality and dissipation of \"the system\" are\r\non the ascendance. From Haiderism to Fortuynism and from Lepper to\r\nMedgyessy - being an outsider is a distinct political advantage in both\r\nwest and east alike.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAUCRATS versus THE POLITICIANS\r\n\r\nThe notion of an a-political civil service and its political - though\r\ntransient - masters is alien to post communist societies. Every\r\nappointment in the public sector, down to the most insignificant\r\nsinecure, is still politicized. Yet, the economic decline precipitated\r\nby the transition to free markets, forced even the most backward\r\npolitical classes to appoint a cadre of young, foreign educated,\r\nwell-traveled, dynamic, and open minded bureaucrats.\r\n\r\nThese are no longer a negligible minority. Nor are they bereft of\r\npolitical assets. Their power and ubiquity increase with every jerky\r\nchange of government. Their public stature, expertise, and contacts\r\nwith their foreign counterparts threaten the lugubrious and\r\nsupernumerary class of professional politicians - many of whom are\r\nashen remnants of the communist conflagration. Hence the recent\r\npolitically-tainted attempts to curb the powers of central bankers in\r\nPoland and the Czech Republic.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONALISTS versus THE EUROPEANS\r\n\r\nThe malignant fringe of far-right nationalism and far left populism in\r\ncentral Europe is more virulent and less sophisticated than its\r\ncounterparts in Austria, Denmark, Italy, France, or the Netherlands.\r\nWith the exception of Poland, though, it is on the wane.\r\n\r\nPopulists of all stripes combine calls for a thinly disguised \"strong\r\nman\" dictatorship with exclusionary racist xenophobia, strong anti-EU\r\nsentiments, conspiracy theory streaks of paranoia, the revival of an\r\nimaginary rustic and family-centered utopia, fears of unemployment and\r\neconomic destitution, regionalism and local patriotism\r\n\r\nThough far from the mainstream and often derided and ignored - they\r\nsucceeded to radicalize both the right and the left in central Europe,\r\nas they have done in the west. Thus, mainstream parties were forced to\r\nadopt a more assertive foreign policy tinged with ominous nationalism\r\n(Hungary) and anti-Europeanism (Poland, Hungary). There has been a\r\nmeasurable shift in public opinion as well - towards disenchantment\r\nwith EU enlargement and overtly exclusionary nationalism. This was\r\naided by Brussels' lukewarm welcome, discriminatory and protectionist\r\npractices, and bureaucratic indecisiveness.\r\n\r\nThese worrisome tendencies are balanced by the inertia of the process.\r\nPoliticians of all colors are committed to the European project.\r\nCarping aside, the countries of central Europe stand to reap\r\nsignificant economic benefits from their EU membership. Still, the\r\noutcome of this clash between parochial nationalism and Europeanism is\r\nfar from certain and, contrary to received wisdom, the process is\r\nreversible.\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRALISTS versus THE REGIONALISTS\r\n\r\nThe recent bickering about the Benes decrees proves that the vision of\r\na \"Europe of regions\" is ephemeral. True, the  century old nation state\r\nhas weakened greatly and the centripetal energy of regions has\r\nincreased. But this applies only to homogeneous states.\r\n\r\nMinorities tend to disrupt this continuity and majorities do their\r\ndamnedest to eradicate these discontinuities by various means - from\r\nassimilation (central Europe) to extermination (the Balkan). Hungary's\r\npolicies - its status law and the economic benefits it bestowed upon\r\nexpatriate Hungarians - is the epitome of such tendencies.\r\n\r\nThese axes of tension delineate and form central Europe's political\r\nlandscape. The Procrustean categories of \"left\" and \"right\" do\r\ninjustice to these subtleties. As central Europe matures into fully\r\nfunctioning capitalistic liberal democracies, proper leftwing parties\r\nand their rightwing adversaries are bound to emerge. But this is still\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n Forward to the Past\r\n\r\nCapitalism in Post-Communist Europe\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nThe core countries of Central Europe (the Czech Republic, Hungary and,\r\nto a lesser extent, Poland) experienced industrial capitalism in the\r\ninter-war period. But the countries comprising the vast expanses of the\r\nNew Independent States, Russia and the Balkan had no real acquaintance\r\nwith it. To them its zealous introduction is nothing but another\r\nideological experiment and not a very rewarding one at that.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that there is no precedent to the extant fortean\r\ntransition from totalitarian communism to liberal capitalism. This\r\nmight well be true. Yet, nascent capitalism is not without historical\r\nexample. The study of the birth of capitalism in feudal Europe may yet\r\nlead to some surprising and potentially useful insights.\r\n\r\nThe Barbarian conquest of the teetering Roman Empire (410-476 AD)\r\nheralded five centuries of existential insecurity and mayhem. Feudalism\r\nwas the countryside's reaction to this damnation. It was a Hobson's\r\nchoice and an explicit trade-off. Local lords defended their vassals\r\nagainst nomad intrusions in return for perpetual service bordering on\r\nslavery. A small percentage of the population lived on trade behind the\r\nmassive walls of Medieval cities.\r\n\r\nIn most parts of central, eastern and southeastern Europe, feudalism\r\nendured well into the twentieth century. It was entrenched in the legal\r\nsystems of the Ottoman Empire and of Czarist Russia. Elements of\r\nfeudalism survived in the mellifluous and prolix prose of the Habsburg\r\ncodices and patents. Most of the denizens of these moribund swathes of\r\nEurope were farmers - only the profligate and parasitic members of a\r\ndistinct minority inhabited the cities. The present brobdignagian\r\nagricultural sectors in countries as diverse as Poland and Macedonia\r\nattest to this continuity of feudal practices.\r\n\r\nBoth manual labour and trade were derided in the Ancient World. This\r\nderision was partially eroded during the Dark Ages. It survived only in\r\nrelation to trade and other \"non-productive\" financial activities and\r\neven that not past the thirteenth century. Max Weber, in his opus, \"The\r\nCity\" (New York, MacMillan, 1958) described this mental shift of\r\nparadigm thus: \"The medieval citizen was on the way towards becoming an\r\neconomic man ... the ancient citizen was a political man\".\r\n\r\nWhat communism did to the lands it permeated was to freeze this early\r\nfeudal frame of mind of disdain towards \"non-productive\", \"city-based\"\r\nvocations. Agricultural and industrial occupations were romantically\r\nextolled. The cities were berated as hubs of moral turpitude, decadence\r\nand greed. Political awareness was made a precondition for personal\r\nsurvival and advancement. The clock was turned back.\r\n\r\nWeber's \"Homo Economicus\" yielded to communism's supercilious version\r\nof the ancient Greeks' \"Zoon Politikon\". John of Salisbury might as\r\nwell have been writing for a communist agitprop department when he\r\npenned this in \"Policraticus\" (1159 AD): \"...if (rich people, people\r\nwith private property) have been stuffed through excessive greed and if\r\nthey hold in their contents too obstinately, (they) give rise to\r\ncountless and incurable illnesses and, through their vices, can bring\r\nabout the ruin of the body as a whole\". The body in the text being the\r\nbody politic.\r\n\r\nThis inimical attitude should have come as no surprise to students of\r\neither urban realities or of communism, their parricidal off-spring.\r\nThe city liberated its citizens from the bondage of the feudal labour\r\ncontract. And it acted as the supreme guarantor of the rights of\r\nprivate property. It relied on its trading and economic prowess to\r\nobtain and secure political autonomy. John of Paris, arguably one of\r\nthe first capitalist cities (at least according to Braudel), wrote:\r\n\"(The individual) had a right to property which was not with impunity\r\nto be interfered with by superior authority - because it was acquired\r\nby (his) own efforts\" (in Georges Duby, \"The age of the Cathedrals: Art\r\nand Society, 980-1420, Chicago, Chicago University Press, 1981).\r\nDespite the fact that communism was an urban phenomenon (albeit with\r\nrustic roots) - it abnegated these \"bourgeoisie\" values. Communal\r\nownership replaced individual property and servitude to the state\r\nreplaced individualism. In communism, feudalism was restored. Even\r\ngeographical mobility was severely curtailed, as was the case in\r\nfeudalism. The doctrine of the Communist party monopolized all modes of\r\nthought and perception - very much as the church-condoned religious\r\nstrain did 700 years before.\r\n\r\nCommunism was characterized by tensions between party, state and the\r\neconomy - exactly as the medieval polity was plagued by conflicts\r\nbetween church, king and merchants-bankers. Paradoxically, communism\r\nwas a faithful re-enactment of pre-capitalist history.\r\n\r\nCommunism should be well distinguished from Marxism. Still, it is\r\nironic that even Marx's \"scientific materialism\" has an equivalent in\r\nthe twilight times of feudalism. The eleventh and twelfth centuries\r\nwitnessed a concerted effort by medieval scholars to apply \"scientific\"\r\nprinciples and human knowledge to the solution of social problems. The\r\nhistorian R. W. Southern called this period \"scientific humanism\" (in\r\n\"Flesh and Stone\" by Richard Sennett, London, Faber and Faber, 1994).\r\nWe mentioned John of Salisbury's \"Policraticus\". It was an effort to\r\nmap political functions and interactions into their human physiological\r\nequivalents. The king, for instance, was the brain of the body politic.\r\nMerchants and bankers were the insatiable stomach. But this apparently\r\nsimplistic analogy masked a schismatic debate. Should a person's\r\nposition in life be determined by his political affiliation and\r\n\"natural\" place in the order of things - or should it be the result of\r\nhis capacities and their exercise (merit)? Do the ever changing\r\ncontents of the economic \"stomach\",  its kaleidoscopic innovativeness,\r\nits \"permanent revolution\" and its propensity to assume \"irrational\"\r\nrisks - adversely affect this natural order which, after all, is based\r\non tradition and routine? In short: is there an inherent\r\nincompatibility between the order of the world (read: the church\r\ndoctrine) and meritocratic (democratic) capitalism? Could Thomas\r\nAquinas' \"Summa Theologica\" (the world as the body of Christ) be\r\nreconciled with \"Stadt Luft Macht Frei\" (\"city air liberates\" - the\r\nsign above the gates of the cities of the Hanseatic League)?\r\n\r\nThis is the eternal tension between the individual and the group.\r\nIndividualism and communism are not new to history and they have always\r\nbeen in conflict. To compare the communist party to the church is a\r\nwell-worn clich. Both religions - the secular and the divine - were\r\nthreatened by the spirit of freedom and initiative embodied in urban\r\nculture, commerce and finance. The order they sought to establish,\r\npropagate and perpetuate conflicted with basic human drives and\r\ndesires. Communism was a throwback to the days before the ascent of the\r\nurbane, capitalistic, sophisticated, incredulous, individualistic and\r\nrisqu West. it sought to substitute one kind of \"scientific\"\r\ndeterminism (the body politic of Christ) by another (the body politic\r\nof \"the Proletariat\"). It failed and when it unravelled, it revealed a\r\nlandscape of toxic devastation, frozen in time, an ossified natural\r\norder bereft of content and adherents. The post-communist countries\r\nhave to pick up where it left them, centuries ago. It is not so much a\r\nproblem of lacking infrastructure as it is an issue of pathologized\r\nminds, not so much a matter of the body as a dysfunction of the psyche.\r\n\r\nThe historian Walter Ullman says that John of Salisbury thought (850\r\nyears ago) that \"the individual's standing within society... (should\r\nbe) based upon his office or his official function ... (the greater\r\nthis function was) the more scope it had, the weightier it was, the\r\nmore rights the individual had.\" (Walter Ullman, \"The Individual and\r\nSociety in the Middle Ages\", Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press,\r\n1966). I cannot conceive of a member of the communist nomenklatura who\r\nwould not have adopted this formula wholeheartedly. If modern\r\ncapitalism can be described as \"back to the future\", communism was\r\nsurely \"forward to the past'.\r\n\r\nTransition in Context\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nLessons in Transition\r\n\r\nIs Transition Possible?\r\n\r\nThe Rip van Winkle Institutions\r\n\r\nThe Author of this Article is a Racist\r\n\r\nThe Eureka Connection\r\n\r\nWomen in Transition:\r\n\r\nFrom Post Feminism to Past Femininity\r\n\r\nAxes to Grind - The Taxonomy of Political Conflict\r\n\r\nThe Solow Paradox\r\n\r\nForward to the Past - Capitalism in Post-Communist Europe\r\n\r\nLeapfrogging Transition - Technology and Post Communism\r\n\r\nContracting for Transition\r\n\r\nWomen in Transition\r\n\r\nThe Kleptocracies of the East\r\n\r\nThe Washington Consensus - I. The IMF\r\n\r\nThe implosion of communism was often presented - not least by Francis\r\nFukuyama in his celebrated \"The end of History\" - as the\r\nincontrovertible victory of economic liberalism over Marxism. In truth,\r\nthe battle raged for seven decades between two strands of socialism.\r\n\r\nSocial democracy was conceived in the 19th century as a benign\r\nalternative to the revolutionary belligerence of Marx and Engels. It\r\nsparred with communism - the virulent and authoritarian species of\r\nsocialism that Marxism has mutated into. European history between\r\n1946-1989 was not a clash of diametrically opposed ideologies - but an\r\ninternecine war between two competing interpretations of the same\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nBoth contestants boasted a single market - the European Union and\r\nCOMECON, respectively. In both the state was heavily involved in the\r\neconomy and owned a sizable chunk of the means of production, though in\r\nthe Soviet Union and its satellites, the state was the economy.\r\n\r\nBoth sported well-developed, entrenched and all-pervasive welfarism.\r\nBoth east and west were stiflingly bureaucratic, statist, profoundly\r\nilliberal and comprehensively regulated. Crucially, the west was\r\neconomically successful and democratic while Russia evolved into a\r\nparanoid nightmare of inefficiency and gloom. Hence its demise.\r\n\r\nWhen communism crumbled, all of Europe - east and west - experienced a\r\nprotracted and agonizing transition. Privatization, deregulation,\r\ncompetition and liberalization swept across both parts of the\r\ncontinent. The irony is that central and east Europe's adaptation was\r\nmore farfetched and alacritous than the west's.\r\n\r\nThe tax burden - a measure of the state's immersion in the economy -\r\nstill equals more than two fifths of gross domestic product in all\r\nmembers of the European Union. The countries in transition - from\r\nRussia to Bulgaria and from Estonia to Hungary - are way more\r\neconomically liberal today than France, Germany and even Britain - let\r\nalone the nations of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nAn increasingly united Europe has opted for \"capitalism with a human\r\nface\"  - the democratic isotope of socialism (sometimes  with a touch\r\nof corporatism). But  it now faces the challenge of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nvariety of the free market. Nowhere is this ideological altercation\r\nmore evident than in the countries formerly behind the iron curtain.\r\n\r\nLong before Enron and World.com, the tech bubble and Wall Street's\r\naccounting frauds and pernicious conflicts of interest - transition has\r\nexposed the raw and vulnerable nerves running through the foundations\r\nof Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Eastern Europe is a monument to the folly of\r\nunmitigated and unbridled freemarketry.\r\n\r\nTransition has given economists a rare chance to study capitalism and\r\neconomic policies from scratch. What's more important - free markets,\r\ninstitutions, education, democracy, or capital? Central and east Europe\r\nbecame a giant lab in which to peruse policies pertaining to\r\ncriminality, private property ownership, entrepreneurship,\r\nprivatization, income distribution, employment, inflation and social\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nSuperficially, the debate revolved around the scientific rigor and\r\nusefulness - or lack thereof - of the \"Washington Consensus\". Opposing\r\nmonetary and fiscal policies, free trade versus protectionism, capital\r\ncontrols and convertibility - these occupied the minds and writings of\r\nall manner of economic and development \"experts\" in the first decade\r\nafter the fall of the Berlin Wall.\r\n\r\nYet, deep underneath, transition - perhaps because it was so thoroughly\r\nbotched - taught us unforgettable lessons about markets and the way\r\nthey work, namely that \"objective\", \"mechanical\" capitalism is a mirage.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important moral is that, like all other economic\r\nprocesses - transition is, mostly, in the mind. Successful capitalism\r\nrequires education and experience. The blind in east Europe were led by\r\nthe one-eyed. Capitalism was presented - especially by Western\r\nprotagonists of \"shock therapy\" - as a deus ex machina, a panacea,\r\nguaranteed to transport the region's derelict economies and destitute\r\npeople to the kitschy glamour of the tacky soap operas that flooded\r\ntheir television screens.\r\n\r\nBedazzled by the alleged omnipotence and omniscience of the \"invisible\r\nhand\", no one predicted the utter meltdown that ensued: the mass\r\nunemployment, the ubiquitous poverty, the glaring abyss between new\r\nrich and always poor, or the skyrocketing prices even as income\r\nplummeted. Nor were the good parts of the new economic regime\r\nunderstood or explained: private property, personal profit, incentives.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of transition were flippantly ignored and the peoples of\r\ncentral and eastern Europe were treated as mere guinea pigs by eager\r\nWestern economists on fat retainers. Crime was allowed to hijack\r\nimportant parts of the post-communist economic agenda, such as the\r\nprivatization of state assets. Kleptocracies subsumed the newborn\r\nstates. Social safety nets crumbled.\r\n\r\nIn their vainglorious attempt to pose as accurate and, thus,\r\n\"respectable\", scientists, economists refused to admit that capitalism\r\nis not merely a compendium of algorithms and formulas - but mainly a\r\nstate of mind. It is an all-encompassing, holistic, worldview, a set of\r\nvalues, a code of conduct, a list of goals, aspirations, fantasies and\r\npreferences and a catalog of moral do's and don'ts. This is where\r\ntransition, micromanaged by these \"experts\" failed.\r\n\r\nThe mere exposure to free markets was supposed to unleash innovation\r\nand entrepreneurship in the long-oppressed populations of east Europe.\r\nWhen this recipe bombed, the West tried to engender a stable,\r\nshare-holding, business-owning, middle class by financing small size\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nIt then proceeded to strengthen and transform indigenous institutions.\r\nNone of it worked. Transition had no grassroots support and its\r\nprescriptive - and painful - nature caused wide resentment and\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\nThe process of transition informed us that markets, left to their own\r\ndevices, unregulated and unharnessed, yield market failures, anomies,\r\ncrime and the misallocation of economic resources. The invisible hand\r\nmust be firmly clasped and guided by functioning and impartial\r\ninstitutions, an ingrained culture of entrepreneurship and fair play,\r\nclasses of stakeholders, checks and balances and good governance on all\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\nWealth, behavioral standards, initiative, risk seeking - do not always\r\n\"trickle down\". To get rid of central planning - more central planning\r\nis required. The state must counteract numerous market failures ,\r\nprovide some public goods, establish and run institutions, tutor\r\neveryone, baby-sit venture capitalists, enhance innovation, enforce\r\nlaws and standards, maintain safety, attract foreign investment, cope\r\nwith unemployment and, at times, establish and operate markets for\r\ngoods and services. This omnipresence runs against the grain of\r\nAnglo-Saxon liberalism.\r\n\r\nMoreover, such an expanded role of the state sits uncomfortably with\r\ncomplete political liberty. That capitalism is inextricably linked to\r\ndemocracy is a well-meaning fallacy - or a convenient pretext for\r\ngeopolitical power grabs. East Europe's transition stalled partly due\r\nto political anarchy. China's transition, by comparison, is spectacular\r\n- inflated figures notwithstanding - because it chose a gradual\r\napproach to liberalization: first economic, then political.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, pure, \"American\", capitalism and pure Marxism have\r\nmore in common than either would care to admit. Both are utopian. Both\r\nare materialistic. Both are doctrinaire. Both believe that \"it's a\r\njungle out there\". Both seek social mobility through control of the\r\nmeans of production. Both claim to be egalitarian forms of social\r\nengineering and are civilizing, millennial, universal, missionary\r\npseudo-religions.\r\n\r\nThe denizens of the nether regions of central and eastern Europe have\r\nbeen the victims of successive economic utopias. They fear and suspect\r\nideological purity. They have been conditioned by the authoritarian\r\nbreed of socialism they endured, really little more than an overblown\r\nconspiracy theory, a persecutory delusion which invariably led to\r\nStalinesque paranoid backlashes. Indeed, Stalin was more representative\r\nof communism than any other leader before or after him.\r\n\r\nThe Economist summed this semipternal mass hysteria neatly thus:\r\n\r\n\"The core idea that economic structure determines everything has been\r\nespecially pernicious ... The idea that ... rights have a deeper moral\r\nunderpinning is an illusion. Morality itself is an illusion., just\r\nanother weapon of the ruling class. As Gyorgy Lukasc put it, 'Communist\r\nethics makes it the highest duty to act wickedly ... This is the\r\ngreatest sacrifice revolution asks from us.' Human agency is null: we\r\nare mere dupes of 'the system', until we repudiate it outright. What\r\ngoes for ethics also goes for history, literature, the rest of the\r\nhumanities and the social sciences. The 'late Marxist' sees them all\r\n... not as subjects for disinterested intellectual inquiry but as forms\r\nof social control.\"\r\n\r\nMany in Europe feel that the above paragraph might as well have been\r\nwritten about Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Reduced to bare-bones\r\nmaterialism, it is amoral, if not immoral. It upholds natural selection\r\ninstead of ethics, prefers money to values, wealth formation to social\r\nsolidarity.\r\n\r\nPredators everywhere - Russian oligarchs, central European cronies,\r\nBalkan kleptocrats, east European managers - find this gratifying. All\r\nothers regard capitalism as yet another rigid and unforgiving creed,\r\nthis time imposed from Washington by the IMF and multinationals rather\r\nas communism was enjoined from Moscow by the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nWith eight of the former communist countries about to become members of\r\nthe European Union - albeit second rate ones -  transition is entering\r\nis most fascinating phase. Exposed hitherto to American teachings and\r\npractices, the new members are forced to adhere to a whole different\r\nrule book - all 82,000 pages of it.\r\n\r\nEuropean \"capitalism\" is really a hybrid of the socialist and liberal\r\nteachings of the 19th century. It emphasizes consensus, community,\r\nsolidarity, equality, stability and continuity. It places these values\r\nabove profitability, entrepreneurship, competition, individualism,\r\nmobility, size, litigation and the use of force. Europeans firmly\r\nbelieve that the workings of the market should be tampered with and\r\nthat it is the responsibility of the state to see to it that no one\r\ngets left behind or trampled upon.\r\n\r\nEuropean stakeholder capitalism is paternalistic and inclusive.\r\nEmployees, employers, the government, communities and suppliers are\r\npartners in the decision making process or privies to it. Relics of\r\npast models of the market economy still abound in this continent:\r\nindustrial policy, Keynesian government spending, development aid,\r\nexport and production subsidies, trade protectionism, the\r\nstate-sanctioned support of nascent and infant industries. Mild\r\ncorporatism is rife and manifest in central wage bargaining.\r\n\r\nFor some countries - notably Estonia - joining the EU would translate\r\ninto a de-liberalized and re-regulated future. Others would find the\r\nEU's brand of the market a comfortable and dimly familiar middle ground\r\nbetween America's harsh prescriptions and communism's delusional model.\r\nThe EU's faceless and Kafkaesque bureaucracy in Brussels - Moscow\r\nrevisited - should prove to be a relief compared to the IMF's ruffians.\r\n\r\nThe EU is evolving into a land empire, albeit glacially. The polities\r\nof central and eastern Europe were always constituents of empires -\r\nreluctantly or by choice. In some ways they are better suited to form\r\nan \"ever closer union\" than the more veteran members.\r\n\r\nEastern Advantages\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nTransition in Context\r\n\r\nLessons in Transition\r\n\r\nIs Transition Possible?\r\n\r\nLeapfrogging Transition - Technology and Post Communism\r\n\r\nMany of the nations of central and east Europe have spent most of their\r\nhistory as components of one empire or another. People in this region\r\nare used to be at the receiving end of directives and planning from the\r\ncenter. Though ostensibly fervid nationalists, they are ill at ease\r\nwith their re-founded and re-found nation-states.\r\n\r\nThe identity of the denizens of these parts is more regional than\r\nnational and evolving towards the supra-national. People are from this\r\nor that city, or district, or village. And they aspire to become\r\ncitizens of Europe and the great experiment of the European Union. They\r\nare only hesitantly and tentatively Macedonians, or Moldovans, or\r\nBelarusians, or Kazakhs, or Yugoslavs.\r\n\r\nThe likes of the Czechs, the Estonians and the Slovenes are well-suited\r\nto become constituents of a larger whole. They make better Europeans\r\nthan the British, or the Norwegians. They have survived far mightier\r\nand more bloated bureaucracies than Brussels'. They are unsurpassed\r\nmanipulators of officialdom. In the long run, the new members stand to\r\nbenefit the most from the EU's enlargement and to form its unwaveringly\r\nloyal core.\r\n\r\nNot yet the full-fledged individualists of the Anglo-Saxon model of\r\ncapitalism - these nations are consensus-seeking team-players. Tutored\r\nby centuries of occupation and hardship, they are instinctual\r\nmultilateralists. They are avid Westerners by persuasion, if not yet in\r\npractice, or geography.\r\n\r\nMoreover, their belated conversion to the ways of the market is an\r\nundisguised blessing.\r\n\r\nThough still a promise largely unfulfilled, the countries in transition\r\ncould now leapfrog whole stages of development by adopting novel\r\ntechnologies and through them the expensive Western research they\r\nembody. The East can learn from the West's mistakes and, by avoiding\r\nthem, achieve a competitive edge.\r\n\r\nTechnology is a social phenomenon with social implications. It fosters\r\nentrepreneurship and social mobility. By allowing the countries in\r\ntransition to skip massive investments in outdated technologies - the\r\ncellular phone, the Internet, cable TV, and the satellite become\r\nshortcuts to prosperity.\r\n\r\nPoverty is another invaluable advantage.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Slovenia, Estonia, Croatia and the Czech Republic\r\n- the population of the countries in transition is poor, sometimes\r\ninordinately so. Looming and actual penury is a major driver of\r\nentrepreneurship, initiative and innovation. Wealth formation and\r\nprofit seeking are motivated by indigence, both absolute and relative.\r\nThe poor seek to better their position in the world by becoming\r\nmiddle-class. They invest in education, in small businesses, in\r\nconsumer products, in future generations.\r\n\r\nThe Germans - sated and affluent - are unlikely to experience a second\r\neconomic miracle. The Serbs, Albanians, Ukrainians, Poles, or Romanians\r\nwon't survive without one. The West is just discovering this truth and\r\nis opening its gates - albeit xenophobically and intermittently - to\r\npoorer foreigners. For what is immigration if not the importation of\r\nambitious indigents, certain to revitalize the EU's rich and somnolent\r\neconomies?\r\n\r\nThe countries of central and eastern Europe, thus, stand to benefit\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nTheir own economic Renaissance is spurred on by a striving home-grown\r\nproletariat. And they are uniquely positioned - geographically and\r\nculturally - to export destitute go-getters to the wealthy West and to\r\nreap the rewards of the inevitable spurt in entrepreneurship and\r\ninnovation that follows. Remittances, returning expatriates, thriving\r\nand networked Diasporas would do more to uplift the countries of origin\r\nthan any amount of oft-misallocated multilateral aid.\r\n\r\nThis cornucopian vision is threatened from numerous sides.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical instability, resurgent trade protectionism, dysfunctional\r\nglobal capital markets and banks - can all reverse the course of a\r\nsuccessful transition to market economies. Still, the more pernicious\r\nthreats are from the inside: venal, delegitimized politicians, brain\r\ndrain, crumbling infrastructure, cheap foreign competition, or\r\ninter-ethnic tensions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most serious hindrance to progress would be a fanatic\r\nemulation by the countries in transition of the European Union. An\r\noverly generous social safety net, a sprawling bureaucracy, inane laws\r\nand regulations about everything from the environment to the welfare of\r\npigs, paralyzed decision-making processes and deleterious subventions -\r\ncan all scupper progress and depress entrepreneurship and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe cautionary tale of east Germany - smothered by western red tape and\r\nlethargy - should forewarn every new member and aspiring candidate.\r\nThey need to join the European Union in the hope of helping to reform\r\nit from the inside. They should not succumb to the allure of German\r\nlargesse, nor acquire the French, Spanish, Greek and Portuguese\r\naddiction to it. They cannot afford to.\r\n\r\nEurope's Four Speeds\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nPomp and circumstance often disguise a sore lack of substance. The\r\nthree days summit of the Central European Initiative is no exception.\r\nHeld in Macedonia's drab capital, Skopje, the delegates including the\r\nodd chief of state, discussed their economies in what was\r\npresumptuously dubbed by them the \"small Davos\", after the larger and\r\nfar more important annual get together in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nYet the whole exercise rests on a series of politically correct\r\nconfabulations. To start with, Macedonia, the host, as well as Albania,\r\nBulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and other east European backwaters hardly\r\nqualify for the title \"central European\". Mitteleuropa is not merely a\r\ngeographical designation which excludes all but two or three of the\r\nparticipants. It is also a historical, cultural, and social entity\r\nwhich comprises the territories of the erstwhile German and,\r\nespecially, Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg) empires.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the disparity between the countries assembled in the august\r\nconference precludes a common label. Slovenia's GDP per capita is 7\r\ntimes Macedonia's. The economies of the Czech Republic, Poland, and\r\nHungary are light years removed from those of Yugoslavia or even\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nNor do these countries attempt real integration. While regional talk\r\nshops, such as ASEAN and the African Union, embarked on serious efforts\r\nto establish customs and currency zones - the countries of central and\r\neastern Europe have drifted apart and intentionally so. Intra-regional\r\ntrade has declined every single year since 1989. Intra-regional foreign\r\ndirect investment is almost non-existent.\r\n\r\nMacedonia's exports to Yugoslavia, its next door neighbor, amount to\r\nmerely half its exports to the unwelcoming European Union - and are\r\ndeclining. Countries from Bulgaria to Russia have shifted 50-75 percent\r\nof their trade from their traditional COMECON partners to the European\r\nUnion and, to a lesser degree, the Middle East, the Far East and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nNor do the advanced members of the club fancy a common label. Slovenia\r\nabhors its Balkan pedigree. Croatia megalomaniacally considers itself\r\nGerman. The Czechs and the Slovaks regard their communist elopement a\r\nsad aberration as do the Hungarians. The Macedonians are not sure\r\nwhether they are Serbs, Bulgarians, or Macedonians. The Moldovans wish\r\nthey were Romanians. The Romanians secretly wish they were Hungarians.\r\nThe Austrians are sometimes Germans and sometimes Balkanians. Many\r\nUkrainians and all Belarusians would like to resurrect the evil empire,\r\nthe USSR.\r\n\r\nThis identity crisis affects the European Union. Never has Europe been\r\nmore fractured. It is now a continent of four speeds. The rich core of\r\nthe European Union, notably Germany and France, constitutes its engine.\r\n\r\nThe mendicant members - from Greece to Portugal - enjoy inane dollops\r\nof cash from Brussels but have next to no say in Union matters.\r\n\r\nThe shoo-in candidates - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and,\r\nmaybe, Slovakia, if it keeps ignoring the outcomes of its elections -\r\nare frantically distancing themselves from the queue of beggars,\r\nmigrants and criminals that awaits at the pearly gates of Brussels. The\r\nBelgian Curtain -between central European candidates and east European\r\naspirants - is falling fast and may prove to be far more divisive and\r\neffective than anything dreamt up by Stalin.\r\n\r\nThe fourth group comprises real candidates - such as Bulgaria - and\r\nwould be applicants, such as Romania, Macedonia, Albania, Yugoslavia,\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina and even Croatia. Some of them are tainted by war\r\ncrimes. Others are addicted to donor conferences. Yet others are\r\ntravesties of the modern nation state having been hijacked and\r\nsubverted by tribal crime gangs. Most of them combine all these\r\nunpalatable features.\r\n\r\nMany of these countries possess the dubious distinction of having once\r\nbeen misruled by the sick man of Europe, the Ottoman Empire. In a\r\nmoment of faux-pas honesty, Valerie Giscard D'Estaing, the chairman of\r\nthe European Union's much-touted constitutional convention, admitted\r\nlast week that a European Union with Turkey will no longer be either\r\nEuropean or United. Imagine how they perceive the likes of Macedonia,\r\nor Albania.\r\n\r\nAs the Union enlarges to the east and south, its character will be\r\ntransformed. It will become poorer and darker, more prone to crime and\r\ncorruption, to sudden or seasonal surges of immigration, to\r\nfractiousness and conflict. It is a process of conversion to a truly\r\nmulti-ethnic and multi-cultural grouping with a weighty Slav and\r\nChristian Orthodox presence. Not necessarily an appetizing prospect,\r\nsay many.\r\n\r\nThe former communist countries in transition are supposed to be\r\nmiraculously transformed by the accession process. Alas, the indelible\r\npathologies of communism mesh well with Brussels's unmanageable,\r\nself-perpetuating and opaque bureaucracy. These mutually-enhancing\r\npropensities are likely to yield a giant and venal welfare state with a\r\nclass of aged citizens in the core countries of the European Union\r\nliving off the toil of young, mostly Slav, laborers in its eastern\r\nterritories. This is the irony: the European Union is doomed without\r\nenlargement. It needs these countries far more than they need it.\r\n\r\nThe strategic importance of western Europe has waned together with the\r\nthreat posed by a dilapidated Russia. Both south Europe and its\r\nnorthern regions are emerging as pivotal. Enlargement would serve to\r\nenhance the dwindling geopolitical relevance of the EU and heal some of\r\nthe multiple rifts with the USA.\r\n\r\nBut the main benefits are economic.\r\n\r\nFaced with an inexorably ageing populace and an unsustainable system of\r\nsocial welfare and retirement benefits, the EU is in dire need of young\r\nimmigrants. According to the United Nations Population Division, the EU\r\nwould need to import 1.6 million migrant workers annually to maintain\r\nits current level of working age population. But it would need to\r\nabsorb almost 14 million new, working age, immigrants per year just to\r\npreserve a stable ratio of workers to pensioners.\r\n\r\nEastern Europe - and especially central Europe - is the EU's natural\r\nreservoir of migrant labor. It is ironic that xenophobic and\r\nanti-immigration parties hold the balance of power in a continent so\r\ndependent on immigration for the survival of its way of life and\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe internal, common, market of the EU has matured. Its growth rate has\r\nleveled off and it has developed a mild case of deflation. In previous\r\ncenturies, Europe exported its excess labor and surplus capacity to its\r\ncolonies - an economic system known as \"mercantilism\".\r\n\r\nThe markets of central, southern, and eastern Europe - West Europe's\r\nhinterland - are replete with abundant raw materials and dirt-cheap,\r\nthough well-educated, labor. As indigenous purchasing power increases,\r\nthe demand for consumer goods and services will expand. Thus, the\r\nenlargement candidates can act both as a sink for Europe's production\r\nand the root of its competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the sheer weight of their agricultural sectors and the\r\nbackwardness of their infrastructure can force a reluctant EU to reform\r\nits inanely bloated farm and regional aid subsidies, notably the Common\r\nAgricultural Policy. That the EU cannot afford to treat the candidates\r\nto dollops of subventioary largesse as it does the likes of France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, and Greece is indisputable.\r\n\r\nBut even a much-debated phase-in period of 10 years would burden the\r\nEU's budget - and the patience of its member states and denizens - to\r\nan acrimonious breaking point.\r\n\r\nThe countries of central and eastern Europe are new consumption and\r\ninvestment markets. With a total of 300 million people (Russia\r\ncounted), they equal the EU's population - though not its much larger\r\npurchasing clout. They are likely to while the next few decades on a\r\nsteep growth curve, catching up with the West. Their proximity to the\r\nEU makes them ideal customers for its goods and services. They could\r\nprovide the impetus for a renewed golden age of European economic\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nCentral and eastern Europe also provide a natural land nexus between\r\nwest Europe and Asia and the Middle East. As China and India grow in\r\neconomic and geopolitical importance, an enlarged Europe will find\r\nitself in the profitable role of an intermediary between east and west.\r\n\r\nThe wide-ranging benefits to the EU of enlargement are clear,\r\ntherefore. What do the candidate states stand to gain from their\r\naccession? The answer is: surprisingly little. All of them already\r\nenjoy, to varying degrees, unfettered, largely duty-free, access to the\r\nEU. To belong, a few - like Estonia - would have to dismantle a much\r\nadmired edifice of economic liberalism.\r\n\r\nMost of them would have to erect barriers to trade and the free\r\nmovement of labor and capital where none existed.\r\n\r\nAll of them would be forced to encumber their fragile economies with\r\ntens of thousands of pages of prohibitively costly labor, intellectual\r\nproperty rights, financial, and environmental regulation. None stands\r\nto enjoy the same benefits as do the more veteran members - notably in\r\nagricultural and regional development funds.\r\n\r\nJoining the EU would deliver rude economic and political shocks to the\r\ncandidate countries. A brutal and rather sudden introduction of\r\ncompetition in hitherto much-sheltered sectors of the economy, giving\r\nup recently hard-won sovereignty, shouldering the debilitating cost of\r\nthe implementation of  reams of guideline, statutes, laws, decrees, and\r\ndirectives, and being largely powerless to influence policy outcomes.\r\nFaced with such a predicament, some countries may even reconsider.\r\n\r\nSwitching Empires\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nEuropean Union (EU) leaders, meeting in Copenhagen, are poised to sign\r\nan agreement to admit ten new members to their hitherto exclusive club.\r\nEight of the fortunate acceders are former communist countries: Czech\r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and\r\nSlovenia. Bulgaria and Romania are tentatively slated to join in 2007.\r\nThe exercise will cost in excess of $40 billion over the next three\r\nyears. The EU's population will grow by 75 million souls.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the implosion of the USSR in 1989-91, the newly\r\nindependent countries of the Baltic and central Europe, traumatized by\r\ndecades of brutal Soviet imperialism, sought to fend off future Russian\r\nencroachment. Entering NATO and the EU was perceived by them as the\r\nequivalent of obtaining geopolitical insurance policies against a\r\nrepeat performance of their tortured histories.\r\n\r\nThis existential emphasis shifted gradually to economic aspects as an\r\nenfeebled, pro-Western and contained Russia ceased to represent a\r\nthreat. But the ambivalence towards the West is still there. Mild\r\nstrands of paranoid xenophobia permeate public discourse in central\r\nEurope and, even more so, in east Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Czechs bitterly remember how, in 1938, they were sacrificed to the\r\nNazis by a complacent and contemptuous West. The Poles and Slovenes\r\nfear massive land purchases by well heeled foreigners (read: Germans).\r\nEveryone decries the \"new Moscow\" - the faceless, central planning,\r\nremote controlling bureaucracy in Brussels. It is tough to give up hard\r\ngained sovereignty and to immerse oneself in what suspiciously\r\nresembles a loose superstate.\r\n\r\nBut surely comparing the EU or NATO to the erstwhile \"Evil Empire\"\r\n(i.e., the Soviet Union) is stretching it too far? The USSR, after all,\r\ndid not hesitate to exercise overwhelming military might against\r\nostensible allies such as Hungary (1956) and the Czechoslovaks (1968)?\r\nTry telling this to the Serbs who were demonized by west European media\r\nand then bombarded to smithereens by NATO aircraft in 1999.\r\n\r\nThough keen on rejoining the mainstream of European history,\r\ncivilization and economy, the peoples of the acceding swathe are highly\r\nsuspicious of Western motives and wary of becoming second-class\r\ncitizens in an enlarged entity. They know next to nothing about how the\r\nEU functions.\r\n\r\nThey are chary of another period of \"shock therapy\" and of creeping\r\ncultural imperialism. Rendered cynical by decades of repression, they\r\nresent what they regard as discriminatory accession deals imposed on\r\nthem in a \"take it or leave it\" fashion by the EU.\r\n\r\nAnti-EU sentiment and Euroscepticism are vocal - though abating - even\r\nin countries like Poland, an erstwhile bastion of Europhilia. Almost\r\ntwo thirds of respondents in surveys conducted by the EU in Estonia,\r\nLatvia, Slovenia and Lithuania are undecided about EU membership or\r\nopposed to it altogether. The situation in the Czech Republic is not\r\nmuch different. Even in countries with a devout following of EU\r\naccession, such as Romania, backing for integration has declined this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThese lurking uncertainties are reciprocated in the west. The mostly\r\nSlav candidates are stereotyped and disparaged by resurgent rightwing,\r\nanti-immigration parties, by neo-nationalists, trade protectionists and\r\nvested interests. Countries like Spain, France, Ireland, Greece and\r\nPortugal stand to receive less regional aid and agricultural subsidies\r\nfrom the common EU till as the money flows east.\r\n\r\nCore constituencies in the west - such as farmers and low-skilled\r\nindustrial workers - resent the enlargement project. Anti-Slav\r\nprejudices run rampant in Italy, Austria and Germany. The\r\nincompatibilities are deepest. For instance, according to research\r\nrecently published by the Pew Center, the new members are staunchly\r\npro-American, though less so than ten years ago. In stark contrast, the\r\nveteran core of the EU is anti-American.\r\n\r\nMany of the denizens of the candidate countries regard the EU as merely\r\nan extended Germany. It is the focus of numerous conspiracy theories,\r\nespecially in the Balkan. The losers of the second world war - Japan\r\nand Germany - are out to conquer the world, this time substituting\r\nmoney for bullets.\r\n\r\nGermany, insist the Serbs and the Macedonians - instigated the\r\nbreakdown of the Yugoslav Federation to establish a subservient\r\nCroatia. Wasn't Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb dictator, ousted in favor\r\nof the German-educated Zoran Djindjic? - they exclaim triumphantly.\r\n\r\nGermany is reasserting itself. United, it is the largest country in\r\nEurope and one of the richest. Its forces are keeping the fragile peace\r\nin Balkan hot spots, like Macedonia. It will contribute to the EU's\r\nlong-heralded rapid reaction force. It owns the bulk of the, frequently\r\noverdue, sovereign debts of Russia, Ukraine and other east European\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOne tenth of Germany's trade is with the candidate countries, a\r\nturnover comparable to its exchange with the United States. German\r\ngoods constitute two fifths of all EU trade with the new members.\r\nGermans are the largest foreign direct investors throughout the region\r\n- from Hungary to Croatia. German banks compete with German-owned\r\nAustrian banks over control of the region's fledgling financial sector.\r\nThe study of German as a second or third language has surged.\r\n\r\nLast year alone, German corporations plunged $3.6 billion into the\r\neconomies of the acceding countries. German multinationals like\r\nVolkswagen and Siemens employ almost 400,000 people in central Europe -\r\nfor one tenth to one eighth their cost in the fatherland.\r\n\r\nQuoted by the World Socialist, the German Chamber of Industry and\r\nCommerce (IHK) estimates that the production costs in mechanical\r\nengineering and plant construction are 20 percent lower in Poland than\r\nin Germany, while quality is more or less the same.\r\n\r\nGermany runs the EU rather single-handedly, though with concessions to\r\na megalomaniacally delusional France. In September, the German and\r\nFrench leaders, meeting tte-\r\n-tte in a hotel, dictated to other\r\nmembers the fate, for the next 11 years, of half the EU's budget - the\r\nportion wasted on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).\r\n\r\nGermany's hegemonic role is likely to be enhanced by enlargement. Many\r\nof the new members - e.g., the Czech Republic - depend on it\r\neconomically. Others - like Hungary - share with it a common history.\r\nGerman is spoken in the majority of the candidates. They trade with\r\nGermany and German businessmen and multinational are heavily invested\r\nin their economies. A \"German Bloc\" within the EU is conceivable -\r\nunless Poland defects to the increasingly marginalized French or to the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nGermany's federalist instincts - its express plan to create a \"United\r\nStates of Europe\", central government and all - are, therefore,\r\nunderstandable, though spurned by the candidate countries. Germany is\r\nlikely to press for even further enlargement to the east. The EU's\r\ncommissioner for enlargement is a German, Gunter Verheugen.\r\n\r\nThe dilapidated expanses of the former Soviet satellites are Germany's\r\nnatural economic hinterland - on the way to the way more lucrative\r\nAsian markets. Hence Germany's reluctance to admit Turkey, a massive,\r\npro-American, potential competitor for Asian favors. Integrating Russia\r\nwould be next on Germany's re-emerging Ostpolitik.\r\n\r\nThis firmly places Germany on an economic and military collision course\r\nwith the United States. As Stratfor, the strategic forecasting\r\nconsultancy, put it recently: \"In Washington's opinion, America's\r\nobsessions should be NATO's obsessions.\" Germany, the regional\r\nsuperpower, has other, more pressing priorities: \"maintaining stability\r\nin its region, making sure that Russian evolution is  benign and\r\navoiding costly conflicts in which it has only  marginal interest.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is an entirely different - and much less benign -\r\ninterpretation of EU enlargement. It is based on the incontrovertible\r\nevidence that the German ends in Europe have remained the same - only\r\nthe means have changed. The German \"September Plan\" to impose an\r\neconomic union on the vanquished nations of Europe following a military\r\nvictory, called, in 1914, for \"(the establishment of) an economic\r\norganization ... through mutual customs agreements ... including\r\nFrance, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Austria, Poland, and perhaps Italy,\r\nSweden, and Norway\".\r\n\r\nEurope spent the first half of the 19th century (following the 1815\r\nCongress of Vienna) containing a post-Napoleonic France. The Concert of\r\nEurope was specifically designed to reflect the interests of the Big\r\nPowers, establish the limits to their expansion in Europe, and create a\r\ncontinental \"balance of deterrence\". For a few decades it proved to be\r\na success.\r\n\r\nThe rise of a unified, industrially mighty and narcissistic Germany led\r\nto two ineffably ruinous world wars. In an effort to prevent a repeat\r\nof Hitler, the Big Powers of the West, led by the USA, the United\r\nKingdom and France, attempted to contain Germany from both east and\r\nwest. The western plank consisted of an \"ever closer\" European Union\r\nand a divided Germany.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the eastern flank of anti-German containment - the USSR\r\n- led to the re-emergence of a united Germany. As the traumatic\r\nmemories of the two world conflagrations receded, Germany resorted to\r\napplying its political weight - now commensurate with its economic and\r\ndemographic might - to securing EU hegemony. Germany is also a natural\r\nand historical leader of central Europe - the future lebensraum of both\r\nthe EU and NATO and the target of their expansionary predilections,\r\neuphemistically termed \"enlargement\".\r\n\r\nThus, virtually overnight, Germany came to dominate the Western\r\ncomponent of anti-German containment - even as the Eastern component\r\nhas chaotically disintegrated.\r\n\r\nThe EU - notably France - is reacting by trying to assume the role\r\nformerly played by the USSR. EU integration is an attempt to assimilate\r\nformer Soviet satellites and dilute Germany's power by re-jigging rules\r\nof voting and representation. If successful, this strategy will prevent\r\nGermany from bidding yet again for a position of dominance in Europe by\r\nestablishing a \"German Union\" separate from the EU.\r\n\r\nIf this gambit fails, however, Germany will emerge triumphant, at the\r\nhead of the world's second largest common market and most prominent\r\ntrading bloc. Its second-among-equal neighbors will be reduced to mere\r\nmarkets for its products and recruitment stages for its factories.\r\n\r\nIn this exegesis, EU enlargement has already degenerated into the same\r\ntiresome and antiquated mercantilist game among 19th century\r\ncontinental Big Powers. Even Britain has hitherto maintained its\r\nVictorian position of \"splendid isolation\". There is nothing wrong with\r\nthat. The Concert of Europe ushered in a century of globalization,\r\neconomic growth and peace. Yet, alas, this time around, it has thus far\r\nbeen quite a cacophony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEurope's Agricultural Revolution\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nOne of the undeniable benefits of the forthcoming enlargement of the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) accrues to its veteran members rather than to the\r\nacceding countries. The EU is forced to revamp its costly agricultural\r\npolicies and attendant bloated bureaucracy. This, undoubtedly, will\r\nlead, albeit glacially, to the demise of Europe's farming sector as we\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nContrary to public misperceptions, Europe is far more open to trade\r\nthan the United States. According to the United Nations (UN), the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization of Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD), its exports amount to 14 percent of\r\ngross domestic product (GDP) compared to America's 11.5 percent. It is\r\nalso the world's second largest importer. In constant dollar terms, it\r\nis the world's largest trader.\r\n\r\nA recent Trade Policy Review released by the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) mentions two notable exceptions: farm products and textiles.\r\nEurope's average tariff on agricultural produce is four times those\r\nlevied on non-agricultural goods. Yet, a number of trends conspire to\r\nbreak the eerie stranglehold of 3 percent of Europe's population - its\r\nfarmers - on its budget and political process.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the euro rendered prices transparent across borders\r\nand revealed to the European consumer how expensive his food is. Scares\r\nlike the mishandled mad cow disease dented consumer confidence in both\r\npoliticians and bureaucrats. But, most crucially, the integration of\r\nthe countries of east and central Europe with their massive\r\nagricultural sectors makes the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\nThe CAP guzzles close to half of the EU's $98 billion budget. Recent,\r\ncontroversial reforms, introduced by the European Commission, call for\r\na gradual reduction and diversion of CAP outlays from directly\r\nsubsidizing production to WTO-compatible investments in agricultural\r\nemployment, regional development, environment and training and\r\nresearch. Unnoticed, support to farmers by both the EU and member\r\ngovernments has already declined from $120 billion in 1999 to $110\r\nbillion in 2000. This decrease has since continued unabated.\r\n\r\nStill, the EU is unable to provide the candidate countries with the\r\nsame level of farm subsidies it doles out to the current 15 members.\r\nClose to one quarter of Poland's population is directly or indirectly\r\ninvolved in agriculture - ten times the European average. The agreement\r\nstruck between Germany and France in September and adopted in a summit\r\nBrussels in October freezes CAP spending in its 2006 level until 2013.\r\n\r\nThis may further postpone the identical treatment much coveted by the\r\napplicants. Theoretically, subsidies for the farm sectors of the new\r\nmembers will increase and subsidies flowing to veteran members will\r\ndecrease until they are equalized at around 80 percent of present\r\nlevels throughout the EU by the end of the next budget period in 2013.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, the entire CAP stands to be renegotiated in 2005-6. No\r\none can guarantee the outcome of this process, especially when coupled\r\nwith the Doha round of trade liberalization. The offers made now to the\r\ncandidate countries are not only mean but also meaningless.\r\n\r\nA recent tweak by Denmark, the current president of the EU, to peg\r\nsupport for farmers in the accession countries at two fifths the going\r\nrate, won a cautious welcome by the applicants. Some of this novel\r\nsubventionary largesse will be deducted from a fund for rural\r\ndevelopment in the new members. Additionally, national governments will\r\nbe allowed to top up inadequate EU dollops with governmental budget\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nEven this parsimonious offer - still disputed by the majority of\r\ncontemporary EU members - will cost the Union an extra $500 million a\r\nyear. It also fails to tackle equally weighty wrangles about production\r\nquotas, EU protectionist \"safeguard\" measures, import tariffs imposed\r\nby the applicant countries against heavily subsidized European farm\r\nproducts, reduced value added taxes on agricultural produce and\r\nreferential periods and yields - the bases for calculating EU\r\ntransfers.\r\n\r\nIt also ignores the distinct - and thorny - possibility that the new\r\nmembers will end up as net contributors to the budget. Quoted by Radio\r\nFree Europe/Radio Liberty, Sandor Richter, a senior researcher with the\r\nVienna Institute for International Economic Studies, concluded that the\r\nfirst intake of applicants will end up underwriting at least $410\r\nmillion of the EU's budget in the first year of membership alone. With\r\nthe GDP per capita of most candidates at one fifth the EU's, this would\r\nbe a perverse, socially unsettling and politically explosive outcome.\r\n\r\nAware of this, the European Commission denies any intention to actually\r\naccept cash from the candidates. Their net contributions would remain\r\ntheoretical, it pledges implausibly. Yet, as long as a country such as\r\nPoland is incapable of absorbing - disseminating and utilizing - more\r\nthan 28 percent of the aid it is currently entitled to - veteran EU\r\nmembers rightly question its administrative ability to tackle much\r\nlarger provisions - c. $20 billion in the first three years after\r\naccession.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged and irascible debate has taken its toll. In some\r\ncandidate countries, pro-EU sentiment is on the wane. Leszek Miller,\r\nPoland's prime minister, told the PAP news agency that Poland should\r\ncontribute to the EU less than it receives in agricultural subsidies.\r\nAnd what if not? \"Nobody would be overly concerned if Poland did not\r\nenter the EU together with the first group of new members.\"\r\n\r\nHungary echoes this argument. Almost two thirds of respondents in\r\nsurveys conducted by the EU in Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia and Lithuania\r\nare undecided about EU membership or opposed to it altogether.\r\n\r\nThe situation in the Czech Republic is not much improved. Only Hungary\r\nstalwartly supports the EU's eastern tilt.\r\n\r\nOpinion polls periodically conducted by GfK Hungaria, a market research\r\ngroup owned by GfK Germany, paint a more mixed picture. On the one\r\nhand, even in countries with a devout following of EU accession, such\r\nas Romania, support for integration has declined this year. Support in\r\nHungary and Poland, on the other hand, picked up.\r\n\r\nYet, the EU can't seem to get its act together. According to the Danish\r\npaper, Berlingske Tidende, Danish prime minister, Anders Fogh\r\nRasmussen, rules out a \"take it or leave it\" ultimatum to the\r\ncandidates. There will be \"real negotiations\", he insisted. Not so,\r\nsays Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish president of the EU until Dec\r\n31: \"The room for maneuver in negotiations will be very limited ... We\r\nhave a certain framework, and we stick to it.\"\r\n\r\nYet, disenchantment should not be exaggerated. Naturally,\r\nflood-affected farmers throughout the region - from the Czech Republic\r\nto Poland - are vigorously protesting their unequal treatment and the\r\ncompromises their governments are arm-twisted into making. Still,\r\naccording to a survey released last December by the European\r\nCommission, 60 percent of the denizens of the accession countries\r\nsupport it.\r\n\r\nAs the endgame nears, the parties to the negotiations are posturing,\r\nthough. EU enlargement commissioner, Gunter Verheugen, argued a\r\nfortnight ago against equalizing support for Poland's 6 million farmers\r\nwith the subsidies given to the EU's 8 million smallholders. In a\r\ntypical feat of incongruity he said it will prevent them from\r\nmodernizing and alienate other professions.\r\n\r\nFranz Fischler, the Austrian EU's agriculture commissioner, hinted that\r\nmiserly production quotas for cereals, meat and dairy products, offered\r\nby the EU to the seething applicants, can be augmented. The EU\r\npresently provides the candidate countries with funding, within the\r\nSpecial Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development\r\n(SAPARD) to support farm investments, to boost processing and marketing\r\nof farm and fishery products and to bankroll infrastructure\r\nimprovements. Hungarian farmers, for instance, are entitled to up to\r\n$38 million of SAPARD money annually.\r\n\r\nIn a thinly veiled threat, Fischler included this in a speech he made\r\nin a recent official visit to Estonia:\r\n\r\n\"The EU enlargement countries should be pleased with the 25 per cent\r\nagriculture subsidies, as the member states have not agreed even on\r\nthat yet, therefore this should be the first goal and only after that\r\ncan further subsidies be discussed ... It would not be very wise to\r\ntell the EU member states that accession countries are not pleased,\r\nthat would not be positive for the whole process.\"\r\n\r\nSmall wonder he was whistled down by irate Polish parliamentarians in\r\nan address to a joint session of the parliamentary committees for\r\nagriculture and European integration in the Sejm. Poland's fractured\r\nfarm sector is notoriously inefficient. With one quarter of the labor\r\nforce it produces less than 4 percent of GDP. But the peasants are well\r\nrepresented in the legislature and soaring unemployment - almost one\r\nfifth of all adults - makes every workplace count.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the ten would-be new members of the EU have teamed up\r\nto present their case in Brussels. Their ministers of finance, foreign\r\naffairs and of agriculture, parliamentary deputies in their finance and\r\nfarm committees - all issued and issue common statements, position\r\npapers, briefings and memoranda of understanding. But no one is\r\ninclined to take such ad-hoc alliances among the candidate countries\r\nseriously. The disparity between their farm sectors is such that it\r\nrules out a single voice.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the EU is strained to the limit of its habitual\r\nconsensus-driven decision making. The breakdown of the European\r\nmechanism of deliberation was brought into sharp relief by the way in\r\nwhich the future of the CAP was decided in a series of chats between\r\nthe leaders of France and Germany in a hotel in Brussels. Their deal\r\nwas later rubber stamped, unaltered, in a summit of all EU members last\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe Union is in constitutional and institutional flux. Small and even\r\nmedium sized members - such as the United Kingdom - are marginalized.\r\nAs the EU grows to 25 countries, a core of leadership will emerge. It\r\nwill involve Germany, France and, potentially the UK and Italy.\r\n\r\nThese will hand down blueprints to be fleshed out by the less\r\nsignificant states and by an increasingly sidelined European Commission\r\nand a make-believe European Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe countries of central and eastern Europe are and will, for a long\r\ntime, be second class citizens, tolerated merely because they provide\r\ncheap, youthful, labor, raw materials and close-by markets for finished\r\ngoods. The candidates are strategically located between the old\r\ncontinent and booming Asia.\r\n\r\nEU enlargement is a thinly disguised exercise in mercantilism tinged\r\nwith the maudlin ideology of embracing revenant brothers long lost to\r\ncommunism. But beneath the veneer of civility and kultur lurk the cold\r\ncalculations of realpolitik. The applicant countries - the EU's\r\nhinterland - would do well to remember this.\r\n\r\nWinning the European CAP\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAccording to Herve Gaymard, the French resistance is alive and kicking\r\n- at least with regards to the European Commission's proposed reforms\r\nof the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The French\r\nMinister for Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, in a\r\nspeech to the misnamed \"Real Solutions for the Future\" Oxford Farming\r\nConference last week, drew the battle lines.\r\n\r\nFrance - and six other EU countries - intend to stick religiously to a\r\ndeal struck, tte-\r\n-tte, between the French president and the German\r\nchancellor last year. The CAP - which now consumes close to half of the\r\nEU's budget - will not be revamped until 2013 at the earliest, though\r\noutlays will be frozen in real terms and, starting in 2006, gradually\r\ndiverted from subsidizing production to environmental and other good\r\ncauses (\"decoupling\" and \"modulation\" in EU jargon).\r\n\r\nThis upset the EU's ten new members, slated to join as early as May\r\n2004. With spending capped, they are unlikely to enjoy the same\r\npecuniary support bestowed on the veterans, even after 2013. As it is,\r\ntheir agricultural benefits are phased over ten years and face an\r\nuncertain future when the CAP is, inevitably and finally, scrapped.\r\n\r\nMoreover, France's recalcitrance imperils the crucial Doha round of\r\ntrade talks. Both the EU and the USA are supposed to reveal their hands\r\nby March. The developing countries are already up in arms over promises\r\nmade by the richer polities in the protracted Uruguay round and then\r\npromptly ignored by them.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is arguably the poorer members' highest priority. They\r\ndemand the opening of the rich world's markets, whittling down export\r\nand production subsidies and the abrogation of non-tariff trade\r\nbarriers and practices, such as the profuse application of anti-dumping\r\nquotas and duties.\r\n\r\nGaymard proffered the usual woolly mantras of \"farm products are more\r\nthan marketable goods\", \"France, and Europe in general, need security\r\nof food supply\", \"food cannot be left to the mercy of market forces\".\r\nFarmers, unlike industrialists - insisted the Minister counterfactually\r\n- cannot simply relocate and agrarian pursuits are a pillar of the\r\nnation's culture and its attachment to the land.\r\n\r\nYet, it cannot be denied that Gaymard advanced in his speech a few\r\nthought-provoking and oft-overlooked points.\r\n\r\nHe convincingly argued that farm products covered by EU subsidies are\r\nrarely in direct competition with the crops of the poor in Africa and\r\nAsia. The cotton, rice and groundnut oil subventions generously doled\r\nout to growers in the United States - the EU's most vocal critic - harm\r\nthe third world smallholders and sharecroppers it purports to defend.\r\n\r\nThe IMF - perceived in Europe as the long and heartless arm of the\r\nAmericans - has dismantled the coffee regime and marketing structures\r\ncausing irreparable damage to its indigent growers, Gaymard said.\r\n\r\nThe CAP, insists Gaymard, does not encourage environmental ills. The\r\npolicy does not subsidize the husbandry of disease-prone poultry and\r\npigs, nor does it support genetically modified crops. The CAP is also\r\nway cheaper than portrayed by its detractors. Food constitutes only 16\r\npercent of the family budget - one third of its share when the CAP was\r\ninstituted, four decades ago. The CAP amounts to a mere 1 percent of\r\nthe combined public spending of all EU members. The comparable figure\r\nin America is 1.5 percent.\r\n\r\nThis last argument is, of course, spurious. It ignores the distorting\r\neffects of the CAP: exorbitant food prices in the EU, double payments\r\nby EU denizens, once as taxpayers and then as consumers, mountains of\r\nbutter and rivers of milk produced solely for the sake of finagling\r\nsubsidies out of an inert and bloated bureaucracy and deteriorating\r\nrelationships with irate trade partners.\r\n\r\nGaymard is no less parsimonious with the full truth elsewhere in his\r\ncounterattack.\r\n\r\nHe claims that the EU provides tariff-free and quota-free access to\r\nfarm products from the world's 49 Highly Indebted Poor Countries\r\n(HIPCs). This is partly untrue and partly misleading. Important\r\ncommodities - such as sugar, rice and bananas - are virtually excluded\r\nby long phase-in periods.\r\n\r\nNon-tariff and non-quota barriers abound. Macedonian lamb is regularly\r\nbarred on sanitary grounds, for instance. Health, sanitary,\r\nstandards-related and quality regulations render a lot of the supposed\r\naccess theoretical.\r\n\r\nStill, it is true that the EU's larger economies are more open to\r\ninternational trade than the United States. Gaymard flaunted a telling\r\nstatistic: the EU absorbs well over two fifths of Brazil's farm\r\nexports. The USA - in geographical proximity to Brazil and a\r\nself-described ardent champion of free trade - takes in less than 15\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nThe problem with farming in the developing world is its concentration\r\non cash crops, whose prices are volatile. This subverts traditional\r\nagriculture. Gaymard implied that the destitute would do well to\r\nintroduce a CAP all their own and thus underwrite a thriving indigenous\r\nsector for internal consumption and more stable export revenues.\r\n\r\nThey can expect no help from the industrialized nations, he made\r\ncrystal clear:\r\n\r\n\"(The rich countries) are not ready to eliminate their support for\r\nagriculture. They have not committed themselves to doing so in\r\ninternational forums and do not believe that, as far as they Are\r\nconcerned, it would be to the developing countries' advantage.\r\nTherefore,\" - he concluded soberly - \"let us stop dreaming.\" This was\r\nreceived with a standing ovation of the 500 conference delegates.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy minded stipulate that France was actually merely seeking\r\nto strengthen its bargaining chips. Finally, they go, it will accept\r\ndecoupling and modulation. But recent policy initiatives do not point\r\nthis way. France all but renationalized its beef markets, proposed to\r\ncontinue dairy quotas till 2013, sought to index milk prices and\r\ndefended the much-reviled current sugar regime\r\n\r\nThese are bad news, indeed. Agriculture is a thorny issue within the EU\r\nno less than outside it. A recessionary Germany has been bankrolling\r\nsated and affluent French farmers for decades now. This has got to stop\r\nand will - whether amicably, or acrimoniously.\r\n\r\nThe new members - most of them from heavily agrarian central and east\r\nEurope - will demand equality sooner, or later. Poor nations will give\r\nup on the entire trade architecture so laboriously erected in the last\r\n20 years - if they become convinced, as they should, that it is all\r\nprestidigitation and a rich boys' club. It is a precipice and France\r\nhas just taken us all one step forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeja V-Euro\r\n\r\nThe History of Previous Currency Unions\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nI. The History of Monetary Unions\r\n\r\n\"Before long, all Europe, save England, will have one money\". This was\r\nwritten by William Bagehot, the Editor of \"The Economist\", the renowned\r\nBritish magazine, 120 years ago when Britain, even then, was heatedly\r\ndebating whether to adopt a single European Currency or not.\r\n\r\nA century later, the euro is finally here (though without British\r\nparticipation). Having braved numerous doomsayers and Cassandras, the\r\ncurrency - though much depreciated against the dollar and reviled in\r\ncertain quarters (especially in Britain) - is now in use in both the\r\neurozone and in eastern and southeastern Europe (the Balkan). In most\r\ncountries in transition, it has already replaced its much sought-after\r\npredecessor, the Deutschmark. The euro still feels like a novelty - but\r\nit is not.  It was preceded by quite a few monetary unions in both\r\nEurope and outside it.\r\n\r\nWhat lessons does history teach us? What pitfalls should we avoid and\r\nwhat features should we embrace?\r\n\r\nPeople felt the need to create a uniform medium of exchange as early as\r\nin Ancient Greece and Medieval Europe. Those proto-unions did not have\r\na central monetary authority or monetary policy, yet they functioned\r\nsurprisingly well in the uncomplicated economies of the time.\r\n\r\nThe first truly modern example would be the monetary union of Colonial\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nThe four kinds of paper money printed by the New England colonies\r\n(Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire and Rhode Island) were\r\nlegal tender in all four until 1750. The governments of the colonies\r\neven accepted them for tax payments. Massachusetts - by far the\r\ndominant economy of the quartet - sustained this arrangement for almost\r\na century. The other colonies became so envious that they began to\r\nprint additional notes outside the union. Massachusetts - facing a\r\nthreat of devaluation and inflation - redeemed for silver its share of\r\nthe paper money in 1751. It then retired from the union, instituted its\r\nown, silver-standard (mono-metallic), currency and never looked back.\r\n\r\nA far more important attempt was the Latin Monetary Union (LMU). It was\r\ndreamt up by the French, obsessed, as usual, by their declining\r\ngeopolitical fortunes and monetary prowess. Belgium already adopted the\r\nFrench franc when it became independent in 1830. The LMU was a natural\r\nextension of this franc zone and, as the two teamed up with Switzerland\r\nin 1848, they encouraged others to join them. Italy followed suit in\r\n1861. When Greece and Bulgaria acceded in 1867, the members established\r\na currency union based on a bimetallic (silver and gold) standard.\r\n\r\nThe LMU was considered sufficiently serious to be able to flirt with\r\nAustria and Spain when its Foundation Treaty was officially signed  in\r\n1865 in Paris. This despite the fact that its French-inspired rules\r\nseemed often to sacrifice the economic to the politically expedient, or\r\nto the grandiose.\r\n\r\nThe LMU was an official subset of an unofficial \"franc area\" (monetary\r\nunion based on the French franc). This is similar to the use of the US\r\ndollar or the euro in many countries today. At its peak, eighteen\r\ncountries adopted the Gold franc as their legal tender (or peg). Four\r\nof them (the founding members of the LMU: France, Belgium, Italy and\r\nSwitzerland) agreed on a gold to silver conversion rate and minted gold\r\nand silver coins which were legal tender in all of them. They\r\nvoluntarily limited their money supply by adopting a rule which forbade\r\nthem to print more than 6 franc coins per capita .\r\n\r\nEurope (especially Germany and the United Kingdom) was gradually\r\nswitching at the time to the gold standard. But the members of the\r\nLatin Monetary Union paid no attention to its emergence. They printed\r\never increasing quantities of gold and silver coins, which constituted\r\nlegal tender across the Union. Smaller denomination (token) silver\r\ncoins, minted in limited quantity, were legal tender only in the\r\nissuing country (because they had a lower silver content than the Union\r\ncoins).\r\n\r\nThe LMU had no single currency (akin to the euro). The national\r\ncurrencies of its member countries were at parity with each other. The\r\ncost of conversion was limited to an exchange commission of 1.25%.\r\n\r\nGovernment offices and municipalities were obliged to accept up to 100\r\nFrancs of non-convertible and low intrinsic value tokens per\r\ntransaction. People lined to convert low metal content silver coins\r\n(100 Francs per transaction each time) to buy higher metal content ones.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the above-mentioned per capita coinage\r\nrestriction, the LMU had no uniform money supply policies or\r\nmanagement. The amount of money in circulation was determined by the\r\nmarkets. The central banks of the member countries pledged to freely\r\nconvert gold and silver to coins and, thus, were forced to maintain a\r\nfixed exchange rate between the two metals (15 to 1) ignoring\r\nfluctuating market prices.\r\n\r\nEven at its apex, the LMU was unable to move the world prices of these\r\nmetals. When silver became overvalued, it was exported (at times\r\nsmuggled) within the Union, in violation of its rules. The Union had to\r\nsuspend silver convertibility and thus accept a humiliating de facto\r\ngold standard. Silver coins and tokens remained legal tender, though.\r\nThe unprecedented financing needs of the Union members - a result of\r\nthe First World War - delivered the coup de grace. The LMU was\r\nofficially dismantled in 1926 - but expired long before that.\r\n\r\nThe LMU had a common currency but this did not guarantee its survival.\r\nIt lacked a common monetary policy monitored and enforced by a common\r\nCentral Bank - and these deficiencies proved fatal.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, twenty countries debated the introduction of a global currency\r\nin the International Monetary Conference. They decided to adopt the\r\ngold standard (already used by Britain and the USA) following a period\r\nof transition. They came up with an ingenious scheme. They selected\r\nthree \"hard\" currencies, with equal gold content so as to render them\r\ninterchangeable, as their legal tender. Regrettably for students of the\r\ndismal science, the plan came to naught.\r\n\r\nAnother failed experiment was the Scandinavian Monetary Union (SMU),\r\nformed by Sweden (1873), Denmark (1873) and Norway (1875). It was a\r\nby-now familiar scheme. All three recognized each others' gold coinage\r\nas well as token coins as legal tender. The daring innovation was to\r\naccept the members' banknotes (1900) as well.\r\n\r\nAs Scandinavian schemes go, this one worked too perfectly. No one\r\nwanted to convert one currency to another. Between 1905 and 1924, no\r\nexchange rates among the three currencies were available. When Norway\r\nbecame independent, the irate Swedes dismantled the moribund Union in\r\nan act of monetary tit-for-tat.\r\n\r\nThe SMU had an unofficial central bank with pooled reserves. It\r\nextended credit lines to each of the three member countries. As long as\r\ngold supply was limited, the Scandinavian Kronor held its ground. Then\r\ngovernments started to finance their deficits by dumping gold during\r\nWorld War I (and thus erode their debts by fostering inflation through\r\na string of inane devaluations). In an unparalleled act of arbitrage,\r\ncentral banks then turned around and used the depreciated currencies to\r\nscoop up gold at official (cheap) rates.\r\n\r\nWhen Sweden refused to continue to sell its gold at the officially\r\nfixed price - the other members declared effective economic war. They\r\nforced Sweden to purchase enormous quantities of their token coins. The\r\nproceeds were used to buy the much stronger Swedish currency at an ever\r\ncheaper price (as the price of gold collapsed). Sweden found itself\r\nsubsidizing an arbitrage against its own economy. It inevitably reacted\r\nby ending the import of other members' tokens. The Union thus ended.\r\nThe price of gold was no longer fixed and token coins were no more\r\nconvertible.\r\n\r\nThe East African Currency Area is a fairly recent debacle. An\r\nequivalent experiment, involving the CFA franc, is still going on in\r\nthe Francophile part of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe parts of East Africa ruled by the British (Kenya, Uganda and\r\nTanganyika and, in 1936, Zanzibar) adopted in 1922 a single common\r\ncurrency, the East African shilling.  The newly independent countries\r\nof East Africa remained part of the Sterling Area (i.e., the local\r\ncurrencies were fully and freely convertible into British Pounds).\r\nMisplaced imperial pride coupled with outmoded strategic thinking led\r\nthe British to infuse these emerging economies with inordinate amounts\r\nof money. Despite all this, the resulting monetary union was\r\nsurprisingly resilient. It easily absorbed the new currencies of Kenya,\r\nUganda and Tanzania in 1966, making them legal tender in all three and\r\nconvertible to Pounds.\r\n\r\nIronically, it was the Pound which gave way. Its relentless\r\ndepreciation in the late 60s and early 70s, led to the disintegration\r\nof the Sterling Area in 1972.\r\n\r\nThe strict monetary discipline which characterized the union -\r\nevaporated. The currencies diverged - a result of a divergence of\r\ninflation targets and interest rates. The East African Currency Area\r\nwas formally ended in 1977.\r\n\r\nNot all monetary unions ended so tragically. Arguably, the most famous\r\nof the successful ones is the Zollverein (German Customs Union).\r\n\r\nThe nascent German Federation was composed, at the beginning of the\r\n19th century, of 39 independent political units. They all busily minted\r\ncoins (gold, silver) and had their own - distinct - standard weights\r\nand measures. The decisions of the much lauded Congress of Vienna\r\n(1815) did wonders for labour mobility in Europe but not so for trade.\r\nThe baffling number of (mostly non-convertible) different currencies\r\ndid not help.\r\n\r\nThe German principalities formed a customs union as early as 1818. The\r\nthree regional groupings (the Northern, Central and Southern) were\r\nunited in 1833. In 1828, Prussia harmonized its customs tariffs with\r\nthe other members of the Federation, making it possible to pay duties\r\nin gold or silver. Some members hesitantly experimented with new fixed\r\nexchange rate convertible currencies. But, in practice, the union\r\nalready had a single currency: the Vereinsmunze.\r\n\r\nThe Zollverein (Customs Union) was established in 1834 to facilitate\r\ntrade by reducing its costs. This was done by compelling most of the\r\nmembers to choose between two monetary standards (the Thaler and the\r\nGulden) in 1838.\r\n\r\nMuch as the Bundesbank was to Europe in the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century, the Prussian central bank became the effective\r\nCentral Bank of the Federation from 1847 on. Prussia was by far the\r\ndominant member of the union, as it comprised 70% of the population and\r\nland mass of the future Germany.\r\n\r\nThe North German Thaler was fixed at 1.75 to the South German Gulden\r\nand, in 1856 (when Austria became informally associated with the\r\nUnion), at 1.5 Austrian Florins. This last collaboration was to be a\r\nshort lived affair, Prussia and Austria having declared war on each\r\nother in 1866.\r\n\r\nBismarck (Prussia) united Germany (Bavarian objections notwithstanding)\r\nin 1871. He founded the Reichsbank in 1875 and charged it with issuing\r\nthe crisp new Reichsmark. Bismarck forced the Germans to accept the new\r\ncurrency as the only legal tender throughout the first German Reich.\r\nGermany's new single currency was in effect a monetary union. It\r\nsurvived two World Wars, a devastating bout of inflation in 1923, and a\r\nmonetary meltdown after the Second World War. The stolid and\r\ntrustworthy Bundesbank succeeded the Reichsmark and the Union was\r\nfinally vanquished only by the bureaucracy in Brussels and its euro.\r\n\r\nThis is the only case in history of a successful monetary union not\r\npreceded by a political one. But it is hardly representative. Prussia\r\nwas the regional bully and never shied away from enforcing strict\r\ncompliance on the other members of the Federation.\r\n\r\nIt understood the paramount importance of a stable currency and sought\r\nto preserve it by introducing various consistent metallic standards.\r\nPolitically motivated inflation and devaluation were ruled out, for the\r\nfirst time. Modern monetary management was born.\r\n\r\nAnother, perhaps equally successful, and still on-going union  - is the\r\nCFA franc Zone.\r\n\r\nThe CFA (stands for French African Community in French) franc has been\r\nin use in the French colonies of West and Central Africa (and,\r\ncuriously, in one formerly Spanish colony) since 1945. It is pegged to\r\nthe French franc. The French Treasury explicitly guarantees its\r\nconversion to the French franc (65% of the reserves of the member\r\nstates are kept in the safes of the French Central Bank). France often\r\nopenly imposes monetary discipline (that it sometimes lacks at home!)\r\ndirectly and through its generous financial assistance. Foreign\r\nreserves must always equal 20% of short term deposits in commercial\r\nbanks. All this made the CFA an attractive option in the colonies even\r\nafter they attained independence.\r\n\r\nThe CFA franc zone is remarkably diverse ethnically, lingually,\r\nculturally, politically, and economically. The currency survived\r\ndevaluations (as large as 100% vis a vis the French Franc), changes of\r\nregimes (from colonial to independent), the existence of two groups of\r\nmembers, each with its own central bank (the West African Economic and\r\nMonetary Union and the Central African Economic and Monetary\r\nCommunity), controls of trade and capital flows - not to mention a host\r\nof natural and man made catastrophes.\r\n\r\nThe euro has indirectly affected the CFA as well. \"The Economist\"\r\nreported recently a shortage of small denomination CFA franc notes.\r\n\"Recently the printer (of CFA francs) has been too busy producing euros\r\nfor the market back home\" - complained the West African central bank in\r\nDakar. But this is the minor problem. The CFA franc is at risk due to\r\ninternal imbalances among the economies of the zone. Their growth rates\r\ndiffer markedly. There are mounting pressures by some members to\r\ndevalue the common currency. Others sternly resist it.\r\n\r\n\"The Economist\" reports that the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) - eight CFA countries plus Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, the\r\nGambia, Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, and Liberia - is considering its own\r\nmonetary union. Many of the prospective members of this union fancy the\r\nCFA franc even less than the EU fancies their capricious and\r\ngraft-ridden economies. But an ECOWAS monetary union could constitute a\r\nserious - and more economically coherent - alternative to the CFA franc\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nA neglected monetary union is the one between Belgium and Luxembourg.\r\nBoth maintain their idiosyncratic currencies - but these are at parity\r\nand serve as legal tender in both countries since 1921. The monetary\r\npolicy of both countries is dictated by the Belgian Central Bank and\r\nexchange regulations are overseen by a joint agency. The two were close\r\nto dismantling the union at least twice (in 1982 and 1993) - but\r\nrelented.\r\n\r\nII. The Lessons\r\n\r\nEurope has had more than its share of botched and of successful\r\ncurrency unions. The Snake, the EMS, the ERM, on the one hand - and the\r\nBritish Pound, the Deutschmark, and the ECU, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe currency unions which made it have all survived because they relied\r\non a single monetary authority for managing the currency.\r\n\r\nCounter-intuitively, single currencies are often associated with\r\ncomplex political entities which occupy vast swathes of land and\r\nincorporate previously distinct -and often politically, socially, and\r\neconomically disparate - units. The USA is a monetary union, as was the\r\nlate USSR.\r\n\r\nAll single currencies encountered opposition on both ideological and\r\npragmatic grounds when they were first introduced.\r\n\r\nThe American constitution, for instance, did not provide for a central\r\nbank. Many of the Founding Fathers (e.g., Madison and Jefferson)\r\nrefused to countenance one. It took the nascent USA two decades to come\r\nup with a semblance of a central monetary institution in 1791. It was\r\nmodeled after the successful Bank of England. When Madison became\r\nPresident, he purposefully let its concession expire in 1811. In the\r\nforthcoming half century, it revived (for instance, in 1816) and\r\nexpired a few times.\r\n\r\nThe United States became a monetary union only following its traumatic\r\nCivil War. Similarly, Europe's monetary union is a belated outcome of\r\ntwo European civil wars (the two World Wars). America instituted bank\r\nregulation and supervision only in 1863 and, for the first time, banks\r\nwere classified as either national or state-level.\r\n\r\nThis classification was necessary because by the end of the Civil War,\r\nnotes - legal and illegal tender - were being issued by no less than\r\n1562 private banks - up from only 25 in 1800. A similar process\r\noccurred in the principalities which were later to constitute Germany.\r\nIn the decade between 1847 and 1857, twenty five private banks were\r\nestablished there for the express purpose of printing banknotes to\r\ncirculate as legal tender. Seventy (!) different types of currency\r\n(mostly foreign) were being used in the Rhineland alone in 1816.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve System was founded only following a tidal wave of\r\nbanking crises in 1908. Not until 1960 did it gain a full monopoly of\r\nnation-wide money printing. The monetary union in the USA - the US\r\ndollar as a single legal tender printed exclusively by a central\r\nmonetary authority - is, therefore, a fairly recent thing, not much\r\nolder than the euro.\r\n\r\nIt is common to confuse the logistics of a monetary union with its\r\nunderpinnings. European bigwigs gloated over the smooth introduction of\r\nthe physical notes and coins of their new currency. But having a single\r\ncurrency with free and guaranteed convertibility is only the\r\nmanifestation of a monetary union - not one of its economic pillars.\r\n\r\nHistory teaches us that for a monetary union to succeed, the exchange\r\nrate of the single currency must be realistic (for instance, reflect\r\nthe purchasing power parity) and, thus, not susceptible to speculative\r\nattacks. Additionally, the members of the union must adhere to one\r\nmonetary policy.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, history demonstrates that a monetary union is not\r\nnecessarily predicated on the existence of a single currency. A\r\nmonetary union could incorporate \"several currencies, fully and\r\npermanently convertible into one another at irrevocably fixed exchange\r\nrates\". This would be like having a single currency with various\r\ndenominations, each printed by another member of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhat really matters are the economic inter-relationships and power\r\nplays among union members and between the union and other currency\r\nzones and currencies (as expressed through the exchange rate).\r\n\r\nUsually the single currency of the Union is convertible at given\r\n(though floating) exchange rates subject to a uniform exchange rate\r\npolicy. This applies to all the territory of the single currency. It is\r\nintended to prevent arbitrage (buying the single currency in one place\r\nand selling it in another). Rampant arbitrage - ask anyone in Asia -\r\noften leads to the need to impose exchange controls, thus eliminating\r\nconvertibility and inducing panic.\r\n\r\nMonetary unions in the past failed because they allowed variable\r\nexchange rates, (often depending on where - in which part of the\r\nmonetary union - the conversion took place).\r\n\r\nA uniform exchange rate policy is only one of the concessions members\r\nof a monetary union must make. Joining always means giving up\r\nindependent monetary policy and, with it, a sizeable slice of national\r\nsovereignty. Members relegate the regulation of their money supply,\r\ninflation, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates to a central\r\nmonetary authority (e.g., the European Central Bank in the eurozone).\r\n\r\nThe need for central monetary management arises because, in economic\r\ntheory, a currency is never just a currency. It is thought of as a\r\ntransmission mechanism of economic signals (information) and\r\nexpectations (often through monetary policy and its outcomes).\r\n\r\nIt is often argued that a single fiscal policy is not only unnecessary,\r\nbut potentially harmful. A monetary union means the surrender of\r\nsovereign monetary policy instruments. It may be advisable to let the\r\nmembers of the union apply fiscal policy instruments autonomously in\r\norder to counter the business cycle, or cope with asymmetric shocks,\r\ngoes the argument. As long as there is no implicit or explicit\r\nguarantee of the whole union for the indebtedness of its members -\r\nprofligate individual states are likely to be punished by the market,\r\ndiscriminately.\r\n\r\nBut, in a monetary union with mutual guarantees among the members (even\r\nif it is only implicit as is the case in the eurozone), fiscal\r\nprofligacy, even of one or two large players, may force the central\r\nmonetary authority to raise interest rates in order to pre-empt\r\ninflationary pressures.\r\n\r\nInterest rates have to be raised because the effects of one member's\r\nfiscal decisions are communicated to other members through the common\r\ncurrency. The currency is the medium of exchange of information\r\nregarding the present and future health of the economies involved.\r\nHence the notorious \"EU Stability Pact\", recently so flagrantly\r\nabandoned in the face of German budget deficits.\r\n\r\nMonetary unions which did not follow the path of fiscal rectitude are\r\nno longer with us.\r\n\r\nIn an article I published in 1997 (\"The History of Previous European\r\nCurrency Unions\"), I identified five paramount lessons from the short\r\nand brutish life of previous - now invariably defunct - monetary unions:\r\n\r\n(A) To prevail, a monetary union must be founded by one or two\r\neconomically dominant countries (\"economic locomotives\"). Such driving\r\nforces must be geopolitically important, maintain political solidarity\r\nwith other members, be willing to exercise their clout, and be\r\neconomically involved in (or even dependent on) the economies of the\r\nother members.\r\n\r\n(B) Central institutions must be set up to monitor and enforce\r\nmonetary, fiscal, and other economic policies, to coordinate activities\r\nof the member states, to implement political and technical decisions,\r\nto control the money aggregates and seigniorage (i.e., rents accruing\r\ndue to money printing), to determine the legal tender and the rules\r\ngoverning the issuance of money.\r\n\r\n(C) It is better if a monetary union is preceded by a political one\r\n(consider the examples of the USA, the USSR, the UK, and  Germany).\r\n\r\n(D) Wage and price flexibility are sine qua non. Their absence is a\r\nthreat to the continued existence of any union. Unilateral transfers\r\nfrom rich areas to poor are a partial and short-lived remedy. Transfers\r\nalso call for a clear and consistent fiscal policy regarding taxation\r\nand expenditures. Problems like unemployment and collapses in demand\r\noften plague rigid monetary  unions. The works of Mundell and McKinnon\r\n(optimal currency areas) prove it decisively (and separately).\r\n\r\n(E) Clear convergence criteria and monetary convergence targets.\r\n\r\nThe current European Monetary Union is far from heeding the lessons of\r\nits ill fated predecessors. Europe's labour and capital markets, though\r\nrecently marginally liberalized, are still more rigid than 150 years\r\nago. The euro was not preceded by an \"ever closer (political or\r\nconstitutional) union\". It relies too heavily on fiscal redistribution\r\nwithout the benefit of either a coherent monetary or a consistent\r\nfiscal area-wide policy. The euro is not built to cope either with\r\nasymmetrical economic shocks (affecting only some members, but not\r\nothers), or with the vicissitudes of the business cycle.\r\n\r\nThis does not bode well. This union might well become yet another\r\nfootnote in the annals of economic history.\r\n\r\nThe Concert of Europe, Interrupted\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\n\"(Plan for establishing) an economic organization ... through mutual\r\ncustoms agreements ... including France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark,\r\nAustria, Poland, and perhaps Italy, Sweden, and Norway\".\r\n\r\nThe German \"September Plan\" to impose an economic union on the\r\nvanquished nations of Europe following a military victory, 1914\r\n\r\nEurope spent the first half of the 19th century (following the 1815\r\nCongress of Vienna) containing France. The trauma of the Napoleonic\r\nwars was the last in a medley of conflicts with an increasingly\r\nmenacing France stretching back to the times of Louis XIV. The Concert\r\nof Europe was specifically designed to reflect the interests of the Big\r\nPowers, establish their borders of expansion in Europe, and create a\r\ncontinental \"balance of deterrence\". For a few decades it proved to be\r\na success.\r\n\r\nThe rise of a unified, industrially mighty and narcissistic Germany\r\nerased most of these achievements. By closely monitoring France, the\r\nBig Powers were fighting the last war - instead of the three next ones.\r\nFollowing two ineffably ruinous world wars, Europe now shifted its\r\ngeopolitical sights from France to Germany. In an effort to prevent a\r\nrepeat of Hitler, the Big Powers of the West, led by France,\r\nestablished an \"ever closer\" European Union. Germany was\r\n(inadvertently) split and sandwiched and, thus, restrained.\r\n\r\nTo its East, it faced a military-economic union (the Warsaw Pact) cum\r\neastern empire (the late USSR). To its West, it was surrounded by a\r\nmilitary union (NATO) cum emerging Western economic supranational\r\nstructure (the EU). The Cold War was fought all over the world - but in\r\nEurope it was about Germany.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the eastern flank (the Soviet - \"evil\" - Empire) of\r\nthis implicit anti-German containment geo-strategy led to the\r\nre-emergence of a united Germany. Furthermore, Germany is in the\r\nprocess of obtaining hegemony over the EU by applying the political\r\nweight commensurate with its economic and demographic might. It is a\r\nnatural and historical leader of central Europe - the EU's and NATO's\r\nfuture lebensraum and the target of their expansionary predilections\r\n(\"integration\"). Thus, virtually overnight, Germany came to dominate\r\nthe Western component of the anti-German containment master plan -\r\nwhile the Eastern component has chaotically disintegrated.\r\n\r\nThe EU - notably France - is reacting by trying to assume the role\r\nformerly played by the USSR. EU integration is an attempt to assimilate\r\nformer Soviet satellites and dilute Germany's power by re-jigging rules\r\nof voting and representation. If successful, this strategy will prevent\r\nGermany from bidding yet again for a position of hegemony in Europe by\r\nestablishing a \"German Union\" separate from the EU. It is all still the\r\nsame tiresome and antiquated game of continental Big Powers. Even\r\nBritain maintains its Victorian position of \"splendid isolation\".\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of both Turkey and Russia from these re-alignments is\r\nalso a direct descendant of the politics of the last two centuries.\r\nBoth are likely to gradually drift away from European (and Western)\r\nstructures and seek their fortunes in the geopolitical twilight zones\r\nof the world. The USA is unlikely to be of much help to Europe as it\r\nreasserts the Monroe doctrine and attends to its growing Pacific\r\npreoccupations. It will assist the EU to cope with Russian (and to a\r\nlesser extent, Turkish) designs in the tremulously tectonic regions of\r\nthe Caucasus, oil-rich and China-bordering Central Asia, and the Middle\r\nEast. But it will not do so in Central Europe, in the Baltic, and in\r\nthe Balkan.\r\n\r\nOf these three spots, the Balkan is by far the most ominous. Russia -\r\nas it has proved in 1877-8 - has historical claims there which it is\r\nwilling to back militarily. Many of the nations of the Balkan are far\r\ncloser to Russia than to the West and tend to regard the latter with\r\nsuspicion and hostility. Turkey, if it so chooses, can easily assume\r\nthe role of the protector of Balkan Moslems - sure to provoke Greek\r\nire. A military conflict among two NATO members will constitute a body\r\nblow to the credibility and prestige of this alliance in search of an\r\nenemy. Moreover, Turkey is the prefect staging ground for operations in\r\nthe Middle East, Central Asia and China. It constitutes a vital\r\nAmerican interest and the pivot of NATO's southern flank. But it is\r\nderided by the EU, its NATO membership notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIt is here, in the Balkan, that the New World Order and the End of\r\nHistory hypothesis are being tested. A new European balance of the Big\r\nPowers will emerge here. But hitherto, alas, this particular concert of\r\nEurope has been quite a cacophony.\r\n\r\n The Eastern Question Revisited\r\n\r\nA lecture organized by the daily \"Politiken\"\r\n\r\nin Copenhagen, Denmark\r\n\r\nJune 25, 2001\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nWhen the USSR disintegrated virtually overnight, in 1989, its demise\r\nwas often compared to that of the Ottoman Empire's. This was a very\r\nlacking comparison. Turkey's death throes lasted centuries and its\r\ndecomposition was taken to be so certain that its division and\r\npartition (the \"Eastern Question\") animated European geopolitics for\r\nthe better part of two centuries. Yet, both left a power vacuum in the\r\nBalkan in their sorry wake.\r\n\r\nThe Big Powers of the time - Russia, Great Britain, France,\r\nAustria-Hungary, and the emerging Germany and Italy - possessed\r\nconflicting interests and sentiments. But, at this stage or another,\r\nmost of them (with the exception of Austria-Hungary) supported the\r\nnationalist solution. It was Russia's favourite discussion topic,\r\nFrance espoused it under Napoleon III, everyone supported the Greeks\r\nand, to a lesser extent, the Serbs against the weakening Ottomans.\r\n\r\nThe nationalist solution encouraged the denizens of the Balkan to adopt\r\nnational identities, to develop national myths, to invent a national\r\nhistory, and to aspire to establish modern nation-states.\r\n\r\nThe examples of Germany and, especially, Greece and Italy were often\r\nevoked. For a detailed treatment of this theme - see \"Herzl's Butlers\".\r\n\r\nThe competing solution was reform. The two Balkan empires - the\r\nOttomans and Austria-Hungary - endlessly, tediously, and\r\ninefficaciously tinkered with their systems or overhauled them. But, to\r\nno avail. The half-hearted reforms often failed to address core issues\r\nand always failed to assuage the growing nationalist sentiment. It was\r\na doomed approach.\r\n\r\nNationalist solutions were inherently self-destructive. They were\r\nmutually exclusive and strived to achieve ethnically homogeneous\r\nlebensraums by all means, fair and foul. The nation's genuine and\r\nnatural (\"historic\") territory always overlapped with another nation's\r\nno less historic claims. This led to recurrent conflicts and to a\r\ngrowing sense of deprivation and loss as actual territories never\r\ntallied with national myths disguised as national histories. It also\r\nprevented the emergence of what du Bois calls \"Double Consciousness\" -\r\nthe mental capacity to contentedly belong to more than one social or\r\nnational grouping (\"Afro-American\", \"Latino-American\", \"American Jew\").\r\n\r\nThus, the Big Powers proffered a nationalist solution when a regional\r\none was called for. Following two devastating Balkan Wars (1912 and\r\n1913) and a World War (1914-1918), regional groupings began to emerge\r\n(example: Yugoslavia). The regional solution stabilized the Balkan for\r\nalmost 7 decades (excluding external shocks, such as the combined\r\ninvasions of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy).\r\n\r\nYet, the regional solution was dependent on both the existence of real\r\nor perceived outside threats (the USSR, the USA, Great Britain) - and\r\non the leadership of charismatic figures such as Tito and Hoxha. When\r\nthe latter died and the USSR evaporated, the region imploded.\r\n\r\nThe last two decades of the 20th century witnessed a resurgence of\r\nnarrow geographical-political identities (a \"Europe of Regions\").\r\nCountries - from the USSR to Italy to Belgium to Canada to Yugoslavia -\r\nwere gradually reduced to geopolitical atoms: provinces, districts,\r\nregions, resurrected political units. Faced with the Yugoslav wars of\r\nsuccession, the Big Powers again chose wrongly.\r\n\r\nInstead of acknowledging the legitimate needs, concerns, and demands of\r\nnations in the Balkan - they proclaimed two untenable principles:\r\nborders must not change and populations must stay put. They dangled the\r\ncarrot of European Union membership as an inducement to peace. In other\r\nwords, even as virulent nationalism was erupting throughout the Balkan,\r\nthey promoted a REGIONAL set of principles and a REGIONAL inducement\r\n(EU) instead of a nationalist orientated one. Yet, as opposed to the\r\npast, the remaining Big Powers were unwilling to actively intervene to\r\nenforce these principles. When they did intervene feebly, it was either\r\ntoo late (Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1995), too one-sidedly (Kosovo, 1999), or\r\ntoo hesitantly (Macedonia, 2001). They clearly lacked commitment and\r\nconviction, or even the military ability to become the guardians of\r\nthis new order.\r\n\r\nThe Big Powers (really, the West) would have done well to leave the\r\nBalkan to its own devices. Clearly its inhabitants were intent on\r\nre-drawing borders and securing ethnic homogeneity. Serbs, Croats,\r\nBosniaks, Kosovars - were all busy altering maps and ethnically\r\ncleansing minorities. The clumsy and uninformed intervention of the\r\nWest (led by the USA) served only to prolong these inevitable\r\nconflicts. By choosing sides, labelling, providing military and\r\ndiplomatic succour, arming, intervening, cajoling, and imposing\r\nill-concocted \"solutions\", the West internationalized local crises and\r\nprevented attrition and equilibrium - the prerequisites to peace. The\r\nWest's artificial arrangements, served on the bayonets of SFOR and KFOR\r\nare unlikely to outlast SFOR and KFOR. Moreover, humanitarian military\r\ninterventions have proven to be the most pernicious kind of\r\nhumanitarian disasters. More people - Kosovars included - died in\r\nOperation Allied Force than in all the years of Serb repression\r\ncombined. The Balkan is simply frozen in geopolitical time. It will\r\nre-erupt and revert to old form when Western presence is reduced and\r\nperhaps even before that.\r\n\r\nThe West should have ignored the Yugoslav wars of succession. But it\r\nwould have done well to offer the combatants - Serbs, Croats, Albanians\r\n- a disinterested diplomatic venue (a benign, voluntary Berlin Congress\r\nor Dayton) to iron out their differences, even as they are fighting.\r\nThe agenda of such a Congress should have included minorities and\r\nborders. There is no doubt that sporadic fighting would have punctuated\r\nthe deliberations of such a congregation. It is certain that walk-outs,\r\ncrises, threats, and break-ups would have occurred regularly.\r\n\r\nBut the participants could have aired grievances, settle disputes,\r\ndiscuss differences, judge reasonableness, form coalitions, help each\r\nother to multilateral give and take, and establish confidence building\r\nmeasures. With the West keeping all cards close to its chest, such a\r\nvenue was and is sorely lacking.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Imperial Russia, \"stability in the Balkan\" has\r\nalways been the mantra. But stability is never achieved diplomatically.\r\nIf there are lessons to be learned from history they are that diplomacy\r\nis futile, peacekeeping meaningless, imposed agreements ephemeral. War\r\nis the ultimate and only arbiter of national interest. Parties resort\r\nto peace only when they are convinced that all military or coercive\r\noptions have been exhausted. When nothing further is to be gained by\r\nmeans of force and its application - peace prevails. But peace (as\r\nopposed to a protracted ceasefire) is impossible even a second before\r\nthe combatants are struck by this realization. Equilibrium is never the\r\nresult of honed negotiating skills - and always the outcome of forces\r\nmatched in battle. Attrition, fatigue, a yearning for stability, a\r\nwillingness to compromise - are all provoked and enhanced to the\r\nacutest level by bloodshed and atrocities. It is an inevitable phase.\r\nThe road to peace is bloodied.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan has never been as politically fragmented as it is today. It\r\nhas never been under the auspices of only one superpower. These are\r\ndestabilizing facts. But one thing has not changed. The Balkan has\r\nalways been the battlefield of numerous clashing and equally potent\r\ninterests coupled with military might.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade, the West has been busy establishing protectorates\r\n(Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and now, most probably, Macedonia) and\r\neffectively altering borders without admitting to it. NATO, that cold\r\nwar anachronism, is still busy maintaining its southern flank, composed\r\nof the eternal adversaries, Turkey and Greece. Turkey is the natural\r\nroad to Central Asia and its oil riches and, further on, to an\r\nominously emerging China. The Balkan is, once again, the playground of\r\nthe grand designers.\r\n\r\nEurope's New Jews\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nIran between Reform and Mayhem\r\n\r\nTurkey's Troubled Water\r\n\r\nSyria's Sunshine Policy\r\n\r\nSaddam's Thousand Nights\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi and the Madman\r\n\r\nGod's Diplomacy and Human Conflicts\r\n\r\nThe Economies of the Middle East\r\n\r\nTurkey's Jewish Friend\r\n\r\nThey inhabit self-imposed ghettoes, subject to derision and worse, the\r\nperennial targets of far-right thugs and populist politicians of all\r\npersuasions.

Most of\r\nthem - though born in European countries - are not allowed to vote.\r\nBrown-skinned and with a marked foreign accent, they are subject to\r\npolice profiling and harassment and all manner of racial\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nThey are the new Jews of Europe - its Muslim minorities.\r\n\r\nMuslims - especially Arab youths from North Africa - are, indeed,\r\ndisproportionately represented in crime, including hate crime, mainly\r\nagainst the Jews. Exclusively Muslim al-Qaida cells have been\r\ndiscovered in many West European countries. But this can be safely\r\nattributed to ubiquitous and trenchant long-term unemployment and to\r\nstunted upward mobility, both social and economic due largely to latent\r\nor expressed racism.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the stereotype is wrong. The incidence of higher education\r\nand skills is greater among Muslim immigrants than in the general\r\npopulation - a phenomenon known as \"brain drain\". Europe attracts the\r\nbest and the brightest - students, scholars, scientists, engineers and\r\nintellectuals - away from their destitute, politically dysfunctional\r\nand backward homelands.\r\n\r\nThe Economist surveys the landscape of friction and withdrawal:\r\n\r\n\"Indifference to Islam has turned first to disdain, then to suspicion\r\nand more recently to hostility ... (due to images of) petro-powered\r\nsheikhs, Palestinian terrorists, Iranian ayatollahs, mass immigration\r\nand then the attacks of September 11th, executed if not planned by\r\nwestern-based Muslims and succored by an odious regime in Afghanistan\r\n... Muslims tend to come from poor, rural areas; most are ill-educated,\r\nmany are brown. They often encounter xenophobia and discrimination,\r\nsometimes made worse by racist politicians. They speak the language of\r\nthe wider society either poorly or not at all, so they find it hard to\r\nget jobs. Their children struggle at school. They huddle in poor\r\ndistricts, often in state-supplied housing ... They tend to withdraw\r\ninto their own world, (forming a) self-sufficient, self-contained\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nThis self-imposed segregation has multiple dimensions. Clannish\r\nbehavior persists for decades. Marriages are still arranged - reluctant\r\nbrides and grooms are imported from the motherland to wed immigrants\r\nfrom the same region or village. The \"parallel society\", in the words\r\nof a British government report following the Oldham riots two years\r\nago, extends to cultural habits, religious practices and social norms.\r\n\r\nAssimilation and integration has many enemies.\r\n\r\nRemittances from abroad are an important part of the gross national\r\nproduct and budgetary revenues of countries such as Bangladesh and\r\nPakistan. Hence their frantic efforts to maintain the cohesive national\r\nand cultural identity of the expats.\r\n\r\nDITIB is an arm of the Turkish government's office for religious\r\naffairs. It discourages the assimilation or social integration of Turks\r\nin Germany. Turkish businesses - newspapers, satellite TV, foods,\r\nclothing, travel agents, publishers - thrive on ghettoization.\r\n\r\nThere is a tacit confluence of interests between national governments,\r\nexporters and Islamic organizations. All three want Turks in Germany to\r\nremain as Turkish as possible. The more nostalgic and homebound the\r\nexpatriate - the larger and more frequent his remittances, the higher\r\nhis consumption of Turkish goods and services and the more prone he is\r\nto resort to religion as a determinant of his besieged and fracturing\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nMuslim numbers are not negligible. Two European countries have Muslim\r\nmajorities - Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania. Others - in both Old\r\nEurope and its post-communist east - harbor sizable and growing Islamic\r\nminorities. Waves of immigration and birth rates three times as high as\r\nthe indigenous population increase their share of the population in\r\nvirtually every European polity - from Russia to Macedonia and from\r\nBulgaria to Britain. One in seven Russians is Muslim - over 20 million\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAccording to the March-April issue of Foreign Policy, the non-Muslim\r\npart of Europe will shrink by 3.5 percent by 2015 while the Muslim\r\npopulace will likely double. There are 3 million Turks in Germany and\r\nanother 12 million Muslims - Algerians, Moroccans, Pakistanis,\r\nBangladeshis, Egyptians, Senegalese, Malis, or Tunisians - in the rest\r\nof the European Union.\r\n\r\nThis is two and one half times the number of Muslims in the United\r\nStates. Even assuming - wrongly - that all of them occupy the lowest\r\ndecile of income, their combined annual purchasing power would amount\r\nto a whopping $150 billion. Furthermore, recent retroactive changes to\r\nGerman law have naturalized over a million immigrants and automatically\r\ngranted its much-coveted citizenship to the 160,000 Muslims born in\r\nGermany every year .\r\n\r\nBetween 2-3 million Muslims in France - half their number - are\r\neligible to vote. Another million - one out of two - cast ballots in\r\nBritain. These numbers count at the polls and are not offset by the\r\nconcerted efforts of a potent Jewish lobby - there are barely a million\r\nJews in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nMuslims are becoming a well-courted swing vote. They may have decided\r\nthe last election in Germany, for instance. Recognizing their growing\r\ncentrality, France established - though not without vote-rigging - a\r\nFrench Council of the Islamic Faith, the equivalent of Napoleon's\r\nJewish Consistory. Two French cabinet members are Muslims. Britain has\r\na Muslim Council.\r\n\r\nBoth Vladimir Putin, Russia's president and Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's\r\nmayor, now take the trouble to greet the capital's one million Muslims\r\non the occasion of their Feast of Sacrifice. They also actively solicit\r\nthe votes of the nationalist and elitist Muslims of the industrialized\r\nVolga - mainly the Tatars, Bashkirs and Chuvash. Even the impoverished,\r\nmuch-detested and powerless Muslims of the northern Caucasus -\r\nChechens, Circassians and Dagestanis - have benefited from this\r\nnewfound awareness of their electoral power.\r\n\r\nThough divided by their common creed - Shiites vs. Sunnites vs.\r\nWahabbites and so on - the Muslims of Europe are united in supporting\r\nthe Palestinian cause and in opposing the Iraq war. This - and\r\npost-colonial guilt feelings, especially manifest in France and Britain\r\n- go a long way toward explaining Germany's re-discovered pacifistic\r\nspine and France's anti-Israeli (not to say anti-Semitic) tilt.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Muslims have been playing an important economic role in\r\nthe continent since the early 1960s. Europe's postwar miracle was\r\nfounded on these cheap, plentiful and oft-replenished Gastarbiter -\r\n\"guest workers\". Objective studies have consistently shown that\r\nimmigrants contribute more to their host economies - as consumers,\r\ninvestors and workers - than they ever claw back in social services and\r\npublic goods. This is especially true in Europe, where an ageing\r\npopulation of early retirees has been relying on the uninterrupted flow\r\nof pension contributions by younger laborers, many of them immigrants.\r\n\r\nBusiness has been paying attention to this emerging market. British\r\nfinancial intermediaries - such as the West Bromwich Building Society -\r\nhave recently introduced \"Islamic\" (interest-free) mortgages. According\r\nto market research firm, Datamonitor, gross advances in the UK alone\r\ncould reach $7 billion in 2006 - up from $60 million today. The Bank of\r\nEngland is in the throes of preparing regulations to accommodate the\r\npent-up demand.\r\n\r\nYet, their very integration, however hesitant and gradual, renders the\r\nMuslims in Europe vulnerable to the kind of treatment the old continent\r\nmeted out to its Jews before the holocaust. Growing Muslim presence in\r\nstagnating job markets within recessionary economies inevitably\r\ngenerated a backlash, often cloaked in terms of Samuel Huntington's\r\n1993 essay in Foreign Affairs, \"Clash of Civilizations\".\r\n\r\nEven tolerant Italy was affected. Last year, the Bologna archbishop,\r\nCardinal Giacomo Biffi, cast Islam as incompatible with Italian\r\nculture. The country's prime minister suggested, in a visit to Berlin\r\ntwo years ago, that Islam is an inherently inferior civilization.\r\n\r\nOriana Fallaci, a prominent journalist, published last year an inane\r\nand foul-mouthed diatribe titled \"The Rage and the Pride\" in which she\r\naccused Muslims of \"breeding like rats\", \"shitting and pissing\" (sic!)\r\neverywhere and supporting Osama bin-Laden indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nYoung Muslims reacted - by further radicalizing and by refusing to\r\nassimilate - to both escalating anti-Islamic rhetoric in Europe and the\r\n\"triumphs\" of Islam elsewhere, such as the revolution in Iran in 1979.\r\nTutored by preachers trained in the most militant Islamist climates in\r\nSaudi Arabia, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and Iran, praying in mosques\r\nfinanced by shady Islamic charities - these youngsters are amenable to\r\nrecruiters from every fanatical grouping.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom suffered some of the worst race riots in half a\r\ncentury in the past two years. France is terrorized by an unprecedented\r\ncrime wave emanating from the banlieux - the decrepit, predominantly\r\nMuslim, housing estates in suburbia. September 11 only accelerated the\r\ninevitable conflict between an alienated minority and hostile\r\nauthorities throughout the continent. Recent changes in European -\r\nnotably British - legislation openly profile and target Muslims.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable turnaround. Europe supported the Muslim Bosnian\r\ncause against the Serbs, Islamic Chechnya against Russia, the\r\nPalestinians against the Israelis and Muslim Albanian insurgents\r\nagainst both Serbs and Macedonians. Nor was this consistent pro-Islamic\r\norientation a novelty.\r\n\r\nBritain's Commission for Racial Equality which caters mainly to the\r\nneeds of Muslims, was formed 37 years ago. Its Foreign Office has never\r\nwavered from its pro-Arab bias. Germany established a Central Council\r\nfor Muslims. Both anti-Americanism and the more veteran anti-Israeli\r\nstreak helped sustain Europe's empathy with Muslim refugees and\r\n\"freedom fighters\" throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s.\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 put paid to this amity. The danger is that the brand of\r\n\"Euro-Islam\" that has begun to emerge lately may be decimated by this\r\npervasive and sudden mistrust. Time Magazine described this blend as\r\n\"the traditional Koran-based religion with its prohibitions against\r\nalcohol and interest-bearing loans now indelibly marked by the\r\n'Western' values of tolerance, democracy and civil liberties.\"\r\n\r\nSuch \"enlightened\" Muslims can serve as an invaluable bridge between\r\nEurope and Russia, the Middle East, Asia, including China and other\r\nplaces with massive Muslim majorities or minorities. As most world\r\nconflicts today involve Islamist militants, global peace and a\r\nfunctioning \"new order\" critically depend on the goodwill and\r\ncommunication skills of Muslims.\r\n\r\nSuch a benign amalgam is the only realistic hope for reconciliation.\r\nEurope is ageing and stagnating and can be reinvigorated only by\r\nembracing youthful, dynamic, driven immigrants, most of whom are bound\r\nto be Muslim. Co-existence is possible and the clash of civilization\r\nnot an inevitability unless Huntington's dystopic vision becomes the\r\nbasic policy document of the West.\r\n\r\nT H E   A U T H O R\r\n\r\nSHMUEL (SAM) VAKNIN\r\n\r\nCurriculum Vitae\r\n\r\nClick on blue text to access relevant web sites - thank you.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1961 in Qiryat-Yam, Israel.\r\n\r\nServed in the Israeli Defence Force (1979-1982) in training and\r\neducation units.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nGraduated a few semesters in the Technion - Israel Institute of\r\nTechnology, Haifa.\r\n\r\nPh.D. in Philosophy (major : Philosophy of Physics) - Pacific Western\r\nUniversity, California.\r\n\r\nGraduate of numerous courses in Finance Theory and International\r\nTrading.\r\n\r\nCertified E-Commerce Concepts Analyst.\r\n\r\nCertified in Psychological Counselling Techniques.\r\n\r\nFull proficiency in Hebrew and in English.\r\n\r\nBusiness Experience\r\n\r\n1980 to 1983\r\n\r\nFounder and co-owner of a chain of computerized information kiosks in\r\nTel-Aviv, Israel.\r\n\r\n1982 to 1985\r\n\r\nSenior positions with the Nessim D.

The economics, the politics, the\r\ngeopolitics, the conspiracies, the corruption, the old and the new, the\r\nplough and the internet - it is all here, in colourful and provocative\r\nprose.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Mind of Darkness\":\r\n\r\n\"'The Balkans' - I say - 'is the unconscious of the world'. People stop\r\nto digest this metaphor and then they nod enthusiastically. It is here\r\nthat the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and\r\nimages reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the\r\ntectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East,\r\nJudeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible. We are\r\nseated at a New Year's dining table, loaded with a roasted pig and\r\nexotic salads. I, the Jew, only half foreign to this cradle of\r\nSlavonics. Four Serbs, five Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that all\r\nethnic distinctions fail and it is here that they prevail\r\nanachronistically and atavistically. Contradiction and change the only\r\ntwo fixtures of this tormented region. The women of the Balkan - buried\r\nunder provocative mask-like make up, retro hairstyles and too narrow\r\ndresses. The men, clad in sepia colours, old fashioned suits and turn\r\nof the century moustaches. In the background there is the crying game\r\nthat is Balkanian music: liturgy and folk and elegy combined. The\r\nsmells are heavy with muskular perfumes. It is like time travel. It is\r\nlike revisiting one's childhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe Author\r\n\r\nSam Vaknin is the author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited\r\nand After the Rain - How the West Lost the East.
