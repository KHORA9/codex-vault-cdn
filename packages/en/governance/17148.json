ROYCE.\r\n\r\nFirst Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, 1879-80, Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington, 1881, pages 247-262\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the State of Indiana]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE INDIAN TITLE.\r\n\r\nThe social and political relations that have existed and still continue\r\nbetween the Government of the United States and the several Indian\r\ntribes occupying territory within its geographical limits are, in many\r\nrespects, peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedentedly rapid increase and expansion of the white population\r\nof the country, bringing into action corresponding necessities for the\r\nacquisition and subjection of additional territory, have maintained a\r\nconstant straggle between civilization and barbarism. Involved as a\r\nfactor in this social conflict, was the legal title to the land occupied\r\nby Indians. The questions raised were whether in law or equity the\r\nIndians were vested with any stronger title than that of mere tenants at\r\nwill, subject to be dispossessed at the pleasure or convenience of their\r\nmore civilized white neighbors, and, if so, what was the nature and\r\nextent of such stronger title?\r\n\r\nThese questions have been discussed and adjudicated from time to time by\r\nthe executive and judicial authorities of civilized nations ever since\r\nthe discovery of America.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this continent, with its supposed marvelous wealth of\r\nprecious metals and commercial woods, gave fresh impetus to the ambition\r\nand cupidity of European monarchs.\r\n\r\nSpain, France, Holland, and England each sought to rival the other in\r\nthe magnitude and value of their discoveries. As the primary object of\r\neach of these European potentates was the same, and it was likely to\r\nlead to much conflict of jurisdiction, the necessity of some general\r\nrule became apparent, whereby their respective claims might be\r\nacknowledged and adjudicated without resort to the arbitrament of arms.\r\nOut of this necessity grew the rule which became a part of the\r\nrecognized law of nations, and which gave the preference of title to the\r\nmonarch whose vessels should be the first to discover, rather than to\r\nthe one who should first enter upon the possession of new lands. The\r\nexclusion under this rule of all other claimants gave to the discovering\r\nnation the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives and of\r\nplanting settlements thereon. This was a right asserted by all the\r\ncommercial nations of Europe, and fully recognized in their dealings\r\nwith each other; and the assertion, of such a right necessarily carried\r\nwith it a modified denial of the Indian title to the land discovered. It\r\nrecognized in them nothing but a possessory title, involving a right of\r\noccupancy and enjoyment until such time as the European sovereign should\r\npurchase it from them. The ultimate fee was held to reside in such\r\nsovereign, whereby the natives were inhibited from alienating in any\r\nmanner their right of possession to any but that sovereign or his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of these principles seems to have been complete, as is\r\nevidenced by the history of America from its discovery to the present\r\nday. France, England, Portugal, and Holland recognized them\r\nunqualifiedly, and even Catholic Spain did not predicate her title\r\nsolely upon the grant of the Holy See.\r\n\r\nNo one of these countries was more zealous in her maintenance of these\r\ndoctrines than England. In 1496 King Henry VII commissioned John and\r\nSebastian Cabot to proceed upon a voyage of discovery and to take\r\npossession of such countries as they might find which were then unknown\r\nto Christian people, in the name of the King of England. The results of\r\ntheir voyages in the next and succeeding years laid the foundation for\r\nthe claim of England to the territory of that portion of North America\r\nwhich subsequently formed the nucleus of our present possessions.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States since the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution has in this particular followed the precedent established\r\nby the mother country. In the treaty of peace between Great Britain and\r\nthe United States following the Revolutionary war, the former not only\r\nrelinquished the right of government, but renounced and yielded to the\r\nUnited States all pretensions and claims whatsoever to all the country\r\nsouth and west of the great northern rivers and lakes as far as the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nIn the period between the conclusion of this treaty and the year 1789 it\r\nwas undoubtedly the opinion of Congress that the relinquishment of\r\nterritory thus made by Great Britain, without so much as a saving clause\r\nguaranteeing the Indian right of occupancy, carried with it an absolute\r\nand unqualified fee-simple title unembarrassed by any intermediate\r\nestate or tenancy. In the treaties held with the Indians during this\r\nperiod--notably those of Fort Stanwix, with the Six Nations, in 1784,\r\nand Fort Finney, with the Shawnees, in 1786--they had been required to\r\nacknowledge the United States as the sole and absolute sovereign of all\r\nthe territory ceded by Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThis claim, though unintelligible to the savages in its legal aspects,\r\nwas practically understood by them to be fatal to their independence and\r\nterritorial rights. Although in a certain degree the border tribes had\r\nbeen defeated in their conflicts with the United States, they still\r\nretained sufficient strength and resources to render them formidable\r\nantagonists, especially when the numbers and disposition of their\r\nadjoining and more remote allies were taken into consideration. The\r\nbreadth, and boldness of the territorial claims thus asserted by the\r\nUnited States were not long in producing their natural effect. The\r\nactive and sagacious Brant succeeded in reviving his favorite project of\r\nan alliance between the Six Nations and the northwestern tribes. He\r\nexperienced but little trouble in convening a formidable assemblage of\r\nIndians at Huron Village, opposite Detroit, where they held council\r\ntogether from November 28 to December 18, 1786.\r\n\r\nThese councils resulted in the presentation of an address to Congress,\r\nwherein they expressed an earnest desire for peace, but firmly insisted\r\nthat all treaties carried on with the United States should be with the\r\ngeneral voice of the whole confederacy in the most open manner; that the\r\nUnited States should prevent surveyors and others from crossing the Ohio\r\nRiver; and they proposed a general treaty early in the spring of 1787.\r\nThis address purported to represent the Five Nations, Hurons, Ottawas,\r\nTwichtwees, Shawanese, Chippewas, Cherokees, Delawares, Pottawatomies,\r\nand the Wabash Confederates, and was signed with the totem of each\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nSuch a remonstrance, considering the weakness of the government under\r\nthe old Articles of Confederation, and the exhausted condition\r\nimmediately following the Revolution, produced a profound sensation in\r\nCongress. That body passed an act providing for the negotiation of a\r\ntreaty or treaties, and making an appropriation for the purchase and\r\nextinguishment of the Indian claim to certain lands. These preparations\r\nand appropriations resulted in two treaties made at Fort Harmar, January\r\n9, 1789, one with the Six Nations, and the other with the Wiandot,\r\nDelaware, Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottawatima, and Sac Nations, wherein the\r\nIndian title of occupancy is clearly acknowledged. That the government\r\nso understood and recognized this principle as entering into the text of\r\nthose treaties is evidenced by a communication bearing date June 15,\r\n1789, from General Knox, then Secretary of War, to President Washington,\r\nand which was communicated by the latter on the same day to Congress, in\r\nwhich it is declared that--\r\n\r\n     The Indians, being the prior occupants, possess the right of soil.\r\n     It cannot be taken from them, unless by their free consent, or by\r\n     right of conquest in case of a just war. To dispossess them on any\r\n     other principle would be a gross violation of the fundamental laws\r\n     of nature, and of that distributive justice which is the glory of a\r\n     nation.\r\n\r\nThe principle thus outlined and approved by the administration of\r\nPresident Washington, although more than once questioned by interested\r\nparties, has almost, if not quite, invariably been sustained by the\r\nlegal tribunals of the country, at least by the courts of final resort;\r\nand the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States bear\r\nconsistent testimony to its legal soundness. Several times has this\r\nquestion in different forms appeared before the latter tribunal for\r\nadjudication, and in each case has the Indian right been recognized and\r\nprotected. In 1823, 1831, and 1832, Chief Justice Marshall successively\r\ndelivered the opinion of the court in important cases involving the\r\nIndian status and rights. In the second of these cases (The Cherokee\r\nNation _vs_. The State of Georgia) it was maintained that the Cherokees\r\nwere a state and had uniformly been treated as such since the settlement\r\nof the country; that the numerous treaties made with them by the United\r\nStates recognized them as a people capable of maintaining the relations\r\nof peace and war; of being responsible in their political character for\r\nany violation of their engagements, or for any aggression committed on\r\nthe citizens of the United States by any individual of their community;\r\nthat the condition of the Indians in their relations to the United\r\nStates is perhaps unlike that of any other two peoples on the globe;\r\nthat, in general, nations not owing a common allegiance are foreign to\r\neach other, but that the relation of the Indians to the United States is\r\nmarked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist nowhere else;\r\nthat the Indians were acknowledged to have an unquestionable right to\r\nthe lands they occupied until that right should be extinguished by a\r\nvoluntary cession to our government; that it might well be doubted\r\nwhether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of\r\nthe United States could with strict accuracy be denominated foreign\r\nnations, but that they might more correctly perhaps be denominated\r\ndomestic dependent nations; that they occupied a territory to which we\r\nasserted a title independent of their will, but which only took effect\r\nin point of possession when their right of possession ceased.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States having thus been committed in all of\r\nits departments to the recognition of the principle of the Indian right\r\nof possession, it becomes not only a subject of interest to the student\r\nof history, but of practical value to the official records of the\r\ngovernment, that a carefully compiled work should exhibit the boundaries\r\nof the several tracts of country which have been acquired from time to\r\ntime, within the present limits of the United States, by cession or\r\nrelinquishment from the various Indian tribes, either through the medium\r\nof friendly negotiations and just compensation, or as the result of\r\nmilitary conquest. Such a work, if accurate, would form the basis of any\r\ncomplete history of the Indian tribes in their relations to, and\r\ninfluence upon the growth and diffusion of our population and\r\ncivilization. Such a contribution to the historical collections of the\r\ncountry should comprise:\r\n\r\n1st. A series of maps of the several States and Territories, on a scale\r\nranging from ten to sixteen miles to an inch, grouped in atlas form,\r\nupon which should be delineated in colors the boundary lines of the\r\nvarious tracts of country ceded to the United States from time to time\r\nby the different Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n2d. An accompanying historical text, not only reciting the substance of\r\nthe material provisions of the several treaties, but giving a history of\r\nthe causes leading to them,, as exhibited in contemporaneous official\r\ncorrespondence and other trustworthy data.\r\n\r\n3d. A chronologic list of treaties with the various Indian tribes,\r\nexhibiting the names of tribes, the date, place where, and person by\r\nwhom negotiated.\r\n\r\n4th. An alphabetic list of all rivers, lakes, mountains, villages, and\r\nother objects or places mentioned in such treaties, together with their\r\nlocation and the names by which they are at present known.\r\n\r\n5th. An alphabetic list of the principal rivers, lakes, mountains, and\r\nother topographic features in the United States, showing not only their\r\npresent names but also the various names by which they have from time to\r\ntime been known since the discovery of America, giving in each case the\r\ndate and the authority therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult and laborious feature of the work is that involved\r\nunder the first of these five subdivisions. The ordinary reader in\r\nfollowing the treaty provisions, in which the boundaries of the various\r\ncessions are so specifically and minutely laid down, would anticipate\r\nbut little difficulty in tracing those boundaries upon the modern map.\r\nIn this he would find himself sadly at fault. In nearly all of the\r\ntreaties concluded half a century or more ago, wherein cessions of land\r\nwere made, occur the names of boundary points which are not to be found\r\non any modern map, and which have never been known to people of the\r\npresent generation living in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn many of the older treaties this is the case with a large proportion\r\nof the boundary points mentioned. The identification and exact location\r\nof these points thus becomes at once a source of much laborious\r\nresearch. Not unfrequently weeks and even months of time have been\r\nconsumed, thousands of old maps and many volumes of books examined, and\r\na voluminous correspondence conducted with local historical societies or\r\nold settlers, in the effort to ascertain the location of a single\r\nboundary point.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this difficulty, the case of \"Hawkins' line\" may be cited,\r\na boundary line mentioned in the cession by the Cherokees by treaty of\r\nOctober 2, 1798. An examination of more than four thousand old and\r\nmodern maps and the scanning of more than fifty volumes failed to show\r\nits location or to give even the slightest clue to it. A somewhat\r\nextended correspondence with numerous persons in Tennessee, including\r\nthe veteran annalist, Ramsey, also failed to secure the desired\r\ninformation. It was not until months of time had been consumed and\r\nprobable sources of information had been almost completely exhausted\r\nthat, through the persevering inquiries of Hon. John M. Lea, of\r\nNashville, Tenn., in conjunction with the present writer's own\r\ninvestigations, the line was satisfactorily identified as being the\r\nboundary line mentioned in the Cherokee treaty of July 2, 1791, and\r\ndescribed as extending from the North Carolina boundary \"north to a\r\npoint from which a line is to be extended to the river Clinch that shall\r\npass the Holston at the ridge which divides the waters running into\r\nLittle River from those running into the Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\nIt gained the title of \"Hawkins' line\" from the fact that a man named\r\nHawkins surveyed it.\r\n\r\nThat this is not an isolated case, and as an illustration of the number\r\nand frequency of changes in local geographical names in this country, it\r\nmay be remarked that in twenty treaties concluded by the Federal\r\nGovernment with the various Indian tribes prior to the year 1800, in an\r\naggregate of one hundred and twenty objects and places therein recited,\r\nseventy-three of them are wholly ignored in the latest edition of\r\nColton's Atlas; and this proportion will hold with but little diminution\r\nin the treaties negotiated during the twenty years immediately\r\nsucceeding that date.\r\n\r\nAnother and most perplexing question has been the adjustment of the\r\nconflicting claims of different tribes of Indians to the same territory.\r\nIn the earlier days of the Federal period, when the entire country west\r\nof the Alleghanies was occupied or controlled by numerous contiguous\r\ntribes, whose methods of subsistence involved more or less of nomadic\r\nhabit, and who possessed large tracts of country then of no greater\r\nvalue than merely to supply the immediate physical wants of the hunter\r\nand fisherman, it was not essential to such tribes that a careful line\r\nof demarkation should define the limits of their respective territorial\r\nclaims and jurisdiction. When, however, by reason of treaty negotiations\r\nwith the United States, with a view to the sale to the latter of a\r\nspecific area of territory within clearly-defined boundaries, it became\r\nessential for the tribe with whom the treaty was being negotiated to\r\nmake assertion and exhibit satisfactory proof of its possessory title to\r\nthe country it proposed to sell, much controversy often arose with other\r\nadjoining tribes, who claimed all or a portion of the proposed cession.\r\nThese conflicting claims were sometimes based upon ancient and\r\nimmemorial occupancy, sometimes upon early or more recent conquest, and\r\nsometimes upon a sort of wholesale squatter-sovereignty title whereby a\r\nwhole tribe, in the course of a sudden and perhaps forced migration,\r\nwould settle down upon an unoccupied portion of the territory of some\r\nless numerous tribe, and by sheer intimidation maintain such occupancy.\r\n\r\nIn its various purchases from the Indians, the Government of the United\r\nStates, in seeking to quiet these conflicting territorial claims, have\r\nnot unfrequently been compelled to accept from two, and even three,\r\ndifferent tribes separate relinquishments of their respective rights,\r\ntitles, and claims to the same section of country. Under such\r\ncircumstances it can readily be seen, what difficulties would attend a\r\nclear exhibition upon a single map of these various coincident and\r\noverlapping strips of territory. The State of Illinois affords an\r\nexcellent illustration. The conflicting cessions in that State may be\r\nbriefly enumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The cession at the mouth of Chicago River, by treaty of August 3,\r\n1795, was also included within the limits of a subsequent cession made\r\nby treaty of August 24, 1816, with the Ottawas, Chippewas, and\r\nPottawatomies.\r\n\r\n2. The cession at the mouth of the Illinois River, by treaty of 1795,\r\nwas overlapped by the Kaskaskia cession of 1803, again by the Sac and\r\nFox cession of 1804, and a third time by the Kickapoo cession of 1819.\r\n\r\n3. The cession at \"Old Peoria Fort, or village,\" by treaty of 1795, was\r\nalso overlapped in like manner with the last preceding one.\r\n\r\n4. The cessions of 1795 at Fort Massac and at Great Salt Spring are\r\nwithin the subsequent cession by the Kaskaskias of 1803.\r\n\r\n5. The cession of August 13, 1803, by the Kaskaskias, as ratified and\r\nenlarged by the Kaskaskias and Peorias September 25, 1818, overlaps the\r\nseveral sessions by previous treaty of 1795 at the mouth of the Illinois\r\nRiver, at Great Salt Spring, at Fort Massac, and at Old Peoria Fort, and\r\nis in turn overlapped by subsequent cessions of July 30, and August 30,\r\n1819, by the Kickapoos and by the Pottawatomie cession of October 20,\r\n1832.\r\n\r\n6. The Sac and Fox cession of November 3, 1804 (partly in Missouri and\r\nWisconsin) overlaps the cessions of 1795 at the mouth of the Illinois\r\nRiver and at Old Peoria Fort. It is overlapped by two Chippewa, Ottawa,\r\nand Pottawatomie cessions of July 29, 1829, the Winnebago cessions of\r\nAugust 1, 1829, and September 1, 1832, and by the Chippewa, Ottawa, and\r\nPottawatomie cession of September 26, 1833.\r\n\r\n7. The Piankeshaw cession of December 30, 1805, is overlapped by the\r\nKickapoo cession of 1819.\r\n\r\n8. The Ottawa, Chippewa, and Pottawatomie cession of August 24, 1816,\r\noverlaps the cession of 1795 around Chicago.\r\n\r\n9. The cession of October 2, 1818, by the Pottawatomies (partly in\r\nIndiana), is overlapped by the subsequent cession of 1819, by the\r\nKickapoos.\r\n\r\n10. The combined cessions of July 30, and August 30, 1819, by the\r\nKickapoos (partly in Indiana), overlap the cessions of 1795 at the mouth\r\nof the Illinois River and at Old Fort Peoria; also the Kaskaskia and\r\nPeoria cessions of 1803 and 1818, the Piankeshaw cession of 1805, and\r\nthe Pottawatomie cession of October 2, 1818, and are overlapped by the\r\nsubsequent Pottawatomie cession of October 20, 1832.\r\n\r\n11. Two cessions were made by the Chippewas, Ottawas and Pottawatomies\r\nby treaty of July 29, 1829 (partly located in Wisconsin), one of which\r\nis entirely and the other largely within the limits of the country\r\npreviously ceded by the Sacs and Foxes, November 3, 1804.\r\n\r\n12. The Winnebago cession of August 1, 1829 (which is partly in\r\nWisconsin), is also wholly within the limits of the aforesaid Sac and\r\nFox cession of 1804.\r\n\r\n13. Cession by the Winnebagoes September 15, 1832, which is mostly in\r\nthe State of Wisconsin and which was also within the limits of the Sac\r\nand Fox cession of 1804.\r\n\r\n14. Pottawatomie cession of October 20, 1832, which overlaps the\r\nKaskaskia and Peoria cession of August 13, 1803, as confirmed and\r\nenlarged September 25, 1818, and also the Kickapoo cession by treaties\r\nof July 30 and August 30, 1819.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that almost the entire country comprising the\r\npresent State of Illinois was the subject of controversy in the matter\r\nof original ownership, and that the United States, in order fully to\r\nextinguish the Indian claim thereto, actually bought it twice, and some\r\nportions of it three times. It is proper, however, to add in this\r\nconnection that where the government at the date of a purchase from one\r\ntribe was aware of an existing claim to the same region by another\r\ntribe, it had the effect of diminishing the price paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL AND SECONDARY CESSIONS.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty that has arisen, and one which, in order to avoid\r\nconfusion, will necessitate the duplication in the atlas of the maps of\r\nseveral States, is the attempt to show not only original, but also\r\nsecondary cessions of land. The policy followed by the United States for\r\nmany years in negotiating treaties with the tribes east of the\r\nMississippi River included the purchase of their former possessions and\r\ntheir removal west of that river to reservations set apart for them\r\nwithin the limits of country purchased for that purpose from its\r\noriginal owners, and which were in turn retroceded to the United States\r\nby its secondary owners. This has been largely the case in Missouri,\r\nArkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Indian Territory. The present State of\r\nKansas, for instance, was for the most part the inheritance of the\r\nKansas and Osage tribes. It was purchased from them by the provisions of\r\nthe treaties of June 2, 1825, with the Osage, and June 3, 1825, with the\r\nKansas tribe, they, however, reserving in each case a tract sufficiently\r\nlarge for their own use and occupancy. These and subsequent cessions of\r\nthese two tribes must be shown upon a map of \"original cessions.\"\r\n\r\nAfter securing these large concessions from the Kansas and Osages, the\r\ngovernment, in pursuance of the policy above alluded to, sought to\r\nsecure the removal of the remnant of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois tribes\r\nto this region by granting them, in part consideration for their eastern\r\npossessions, reservations therein of size and location suitable to their\r\nwishes and necessities. In this way homes were provided for the\r\nWyandots, Delawares, Shawnees, Pottawatomies, Sacs and Foxes of the\r\nMississippi, Kickapoos, the Confederated Kaskaskias, Peorias,\r\nPiankeshaws, and Weas, the Ottawas of Blanchard's Fork and Roche de\r\nBoeuf, and the Chippewas and Munsees. A few years of occupation again\r\nfound the advancing white settlements encroaching upon their domain,\r\nwith the usual accompanying demand for more land. Cessions, first; of a\r\nportion and finally of the remnant, of these reservations followed,\r\ncoupled with the removal of the Indians to Indian Territory. These\r\nseveral reservations and cessions must be indicated upon a map of\r\n\"secondary cessions.\"\r\n\r\nObject illustration is much, more striking and effective than mere\r\nverbal description. In order, therefore, to secure to the reader the\r\nclearest possible understanding of the subject, there is herewith\r\npresented as an illustration a map of the State of Indiana, upon which\r\nis delineated the boundaries of the different tracts of land within that\r\nState ceded to the United States from time to time by treaty with the\r\nvarious Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nThe cessions are as follows:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. A tract lying east of a line running from opposite the mouth of\r\nKentucky River, in a northerly direction, to Fort Recovery, in Ohio, and\r\nwhich forms a small portion of the western end of the cession made by\r\nthe first paragraph of article 3, treaty of August 3, 1795, with the\r\nWyandots, Delawares, Miamis, and nine other tribes. Its boundaries are\r\nindicated by scarlet lines. The bulk of the cession is in Ohio.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Six miles square at confluence of Saint Mary's and Saint Joseph's\r\nRivers, including Fort Wayne; also ceded by treaty of August 3, 1795,\r\nand bounded on the map by scarlet lines.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Two miles square on the Wabash, at the end of the Portage of the\r\nMiami of the Lake; also ceded by treaty of August 3, 1795, and bounded\r\non the map by scarlet lines.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Six miles square at Outatenon, or Old Wea Towns, on the Wabash;\r\nalso ceded by treaty of August 3, 1795, and bounded on the map by\r\nscarlet lines. This tract was subsequently retroceded to the Indians by\r\narticle 8, treaty of September 30, 1809, and finally included within the\r\nPottawatomie session of October 2, 1818, and the Miami cession of\r\nOctober 6, 1818.\r\n\r\nNo. 5. Clarke's grant on the Ohio River; stipulated in deed from\r\nVirginia to the United States in 1784 to be granted to General George\r\nRogers Clarke and his soldiers. This tract was specially excepted from\r\nthe limits of the Indian country by treaty of August 3, 1795, and is\r\nbounded on the map by scarlet lines.\r\n\r\nNo. 6. \"Post of Vincennes and adjacent country, to which the Indian\r\ntitle has been extinguished.\" This tract was specially excluded from the\r\nlimits of the Indian country by treaty of August 3, 1795. Doubt having\r\narisen as to its proper boundaries, they were specifically defined by\r\ntreaty of June 7, 1803. It is known as the \"Vincennes tract\"; is partly\r\nin Illinois, and is bounded on the map by scarlet lines.\r\n\r\nNo. 7. Tract ceded by the treaties of August 18, 1804, with the\r\nDelawares, and August 27, 1804, with the Piankeshaws.
