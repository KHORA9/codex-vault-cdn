He is\r\na French scholar of the finest type, careful, objective, and sincere.\r\nThe present work on the German constitution bears the impress of these\r\nhigh qualities. In this volume we find the scientific spirit that was\r\nto be expected, combined with an intimate, first-hand knowledge of the\r\nforces and materials which are described. All this is very significant.\r\nThe long night of the Great War was hardly over before M. Brunet began\r\nan impartial and thorough-going study of the state of affairs created in\r\nGermany by the revolution of November, 1918. If a Frenchman who suffered\r\nso much can display such good sense and sobriety, then surely American\r\nscholars ought to give more than a hearty welcome to this volume. It is\r\nan excellent beginning in the reconstruction of the republic of letters.\r\n\r\nIn this book we have a plain and simple account of the German revolution\r\nand the conflict of forces which ended in the establishment of the\r\nrepublic. The balance of parties is examined. The results of the\r\nelections to the national assembly are summarized. Then follows a\r\nsystematic analysis of the new plan of government, illuminated by\r\ncontinual reference to the concrete historical circumstances in which the\r\nmakers of the German constitution had to operate.\r\n\r\nM. Brunet has tried to steer his way on an even keel between the highly\r\ntheoretical methods of the German political philosophers and the hard,\r\nmatter-of-fact methods of the Anglo-Saxons. He has succeeded admirably.\r\nAccordingly, the usefulness of his volume extends beyond the information\r\nwhich it presents. It affords an interesting model to young American\r\nwriters who have occasion to deal with constitutional and legal matters.\r\nThere is no reason why a doctor of philosophy should not love insight and\r\nform as much as the poet does. The great English doctor of law, Maitland,\r\ncertainly did.\r\n\r\nM. Brunet’s excellent qualities have enabled him to write the best\r\ntreatise on the German constitution which exists in any language. Any one\r\nwho will spend a day comparing this volume with Dr. Fritz Stier-Somlo’s\r\n_Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs vom 11. August, 1919_, for example,\r\nwill soon discover how much more ingenious and penetrating is the French\r\ncommentator. M. Brunet’s volume is to be commended on other grounds than\r\nthose of intrinsic excellence. It brings information to the American\r\npublic on a subject concerning which very little is known at present. The\r\nnew German constitution has been translated into English and there are a\r\nfew stray articles by the way of commentary available to Americans, but\r\nthis is the first systematic treatise on the topic in our tongue.\r\n\r\nIt would not be fitting to give in this foreword a résumé of M. Brunet’s\r\nvolume. The admirable survey presented in the analytical table of\r\ncontents can be seen at a glance. It may not be out of place, however, to\r\nindicate some points of contact between the present course of American\r\nthinking and the system of government here described. Notwithstanding\r\nthe curious constitution worship that flourishes in many places in the\r\nUnited States, there are signs of fresh currents of thinking. Mr. Woodrow\r\nWilson, in his remarkable essay, _Congressional Government_, set in train\r\nnew opinions as to our constitutional system which have by no means been\r\nlost to view in the general revulsion of feeling that followed the war.\r\nOnly recently Professor Lindsay Rogers, of Columbia University, took\r\noccasion to remark, in the course of an interesting article on modern\r\nFrench politics, that we ought to have a more lively and intelligent\r\ndiscussion of constitutional questions in America. The ink was hardly dry\r\non his paper before Professor William Macdonald accepted the challenge by\r\nbringing out his highly suggestive book, entitled _A New Constitution\r\nfor a New America_.\r\n\r\nThe rhythm of human affairs is such that we may reasonably expect\r\na return to the constitutional searchings of 1912 on a higher and\r\ndifferent plane. Those who fix their eyes not upon the written letter\r\nof our Constitution, but upon judicial decisions, political practice,\r\nand congressional procedure are never under the delusion that our\r\nconstitutional system does not change. If, as Professor Seligman long\r\nago pointed out, economic conditions are rapidly becoming the same all\r\nover the world with similar legal results, then we may, with proper\r\nwarrant, expect very soon a new and lively examination of constitutional\r\nprinciples to break in upon us. M. Brunet’s book fits in with the\r\nsigns of the times. No person who pretends to be intelligent about\r\nconstitutional matters can neglect it.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine anything more illuminating than a\r\ncomparison of the Constitution of the United States drawn up in 1787, the\r\nfundamental law of the Australian Commonwealth adopted in 1900, and the\r\nnew German _Reichsverfassung_ of 1919, which vibrates with the tramp of\r\nthe proletariat. In the attempt of the Germans to combine the strength\r\nof Hamilton’s government with the democratic control so vaunted by\r\nJefferson we have an experiment that ought to stir our deepest interest.\r\nIn the provisions for social, not to say socialistic, enterprise, both\r\nthe Australian and the German constitutions offer noteworthy contrasts\r\nto our own fundamental law. It will not escape the close observer that\r\nthe Germans have not created a supreme court, on the model of our own,\r\nendowed with power to set aside acts of the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of the government. The relations established by the Germans\r\nbetween the federal government and the states, ingenious compromises all\r\nmust admit, ought to be studied in connection with Mr. Roosevelt’s “New\r\nNationalism”--not as an echo of a dead past but as a prophecy of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe science of comparative government is as fruitful to-day as it was a\r\ngeneration ago when it nourished in such vigour. A teacher who will place\r\nM. Brunet’s book and “The Federalist” in the hands of a college class\r\ncannot fail to evoke a lively interest in politics and a more intelligent\r\nconsideration of American constitutional problems.\r\n\r\nTo the historian, the introductory part of M. Brunet’s volume will\r\nafford food for thought. There is no doubt that the new German\r\nconstitution is the product of a sharp and determined conflict of\r\nclasses. M. Brunet records the fact and gives the alignment of parties.\r\nNo sophisticated person will ever imagine (whatever he may say) that\r\nthe German fundamental law was drawn from abstract political thinking,\r\ntheories about the rights of states, or reflections on the fate of Greek\r\ndemocracies and ancient Rome. The pressure of class interests is evident\r\nin almost every line. If one should underscore the socialist sections\r\nwith red, the Centre clauses with yellow, and the capitalist phrases with\r\nblack, one would have an interesting study in constitutional artistry.\r\nFrom time to time, M. Brunet makes specific references to the precise\r\neffect of party pressures upon legal phraseology. It would, however, be\r\na work of supererogation to point out to American scholars the relevancy\r\nof these passages. Having recovered from the shock of learning that the\r\nFathers of our Constitution were made of mortal clay, they are prepared\r\nto receive M. Brunet’s book with open minds.\r\n\r\nMy hearty thanks are due to Mr. Knopf, who, on my suggestion, undertook\r\nto make this volume available to the American public. I am indebted to\r\nProfessors Munro and Holcombe for the right to use their translation\r\nof the “Constitution of the German Commonwealth” issued by the World\r\nPeace Foundation. Especially am I under obligation to Mr. Joseph Gollomb\r\nfor undertaking the translation of M. Brunet’s text. Mr. Gollomb was\r\nhimself a witness at many of the scenes described in these pages. He has\r\nfirst-hand knowledge of European politics. His long residence in Paris\r\ngave him a mastery of the French tongue. In making this English version,\r\nhe has kept in mind the requirements of the general reader as well as\r\nthose of technical students.\r\n\r\n                                                        CHARLES A.

Then in November, 1918, the work of Bismarck was\r\nsuddenly overthrown and military defeat and revolution plunged Germany\r\ninto chaos. How she worked out of it, through what vicissitudes she\r\npassed and with what groping she finally achieved her new Constitution is\r\nthe question to examine first.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 1\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe revolution of November, 1918, was preceded by partial reforms\r\nembodied at a late hour in the Constitution of 1871; and when it broke\r\nout, in a few hours it completely threw over all the apparatus of the old\r\nrégime. A new government sprang up which for several weeks held power in\r\nthe name of a minority and without any right other than that of force.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE CONSTITUTION OF APRIL 16, 1871, AND THE REFORMS OF OCTOBER, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics of the Constitution of April 16, 1871, are\r\nwell known.\r\n\r\nGermany was a federal state, that is to say, above the member states,\r\nwhich renounced a part of their individual independence to strengthen\r\ntheir collective political and economic power, there existed a central\r\nstate in whose favor they had given up that degree of independence--the\r\nGerman Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the Reich sovereign power belonged to an assembly of Princes and of\r\ngovernments represented by the Bundesrat or Federal Council. This council\r\nwhich consisted of representatives of all the member states shared with\r\nthe Reichstag the power to initiate and vote legislation. It promulgated\r\nthe general administrative measures necessary for the execution of the\r\nlaws; and with the consent of the Emperor it could dissolve the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe nation was presided over by the German Emperor. He exercised\r\ngenerally the rights which modern nations reserve to the executive power.\r\nIn particular he represented the Empire in its international relations;\r\npromulgated its laws; watched over their execution; appointed civil and\r\nmilitary officials, etc.\r\n\r\nSeveral remarkable details have to be pointed out. Although in principle\r\nthe Emperor’s actions had to be countersigned by a minister he was free\r\nfrom that restriction in such matters as concerned military affairs,\r\nparticularly in the nomination of the superior officers of the army and\r\nthe navy. The German Emperor was the absolute chief of the forces of the\r\nEmpire on sea and land. Furthermore, although he could not declare war\r\nwithout the consent of the Bundesrat he could act on his own authority in\r\ncase of attack by a foreign power against the territory or the coasts of\r\nthe German Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor nominated the Chancellor, who was after the Emperor himself,\r\nthe sole chief of the political and administrative organization of the\r\nEmpire. “The Chancellor,” says Article 15, “presides over the Bundesrat\r\nand directs its labours.” But as he clearly could not himself assume such\r\nan overwhelming task, he was authorized by the law of March 17, 1878,\r\nto call assistance and be supplemented at need by high functionaries\r\nplaced at the head of Imperial departments--those of foreign affairs, of\r\nthe interior, justice, treasury, railroads, marine, colonies, posts and\r\ntelegraphs. These officials carried the title of State Secretaries, which\r\nseemed to give them something of the nature of ministers, though in\r\nreality they were completely subordinated to the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nJust as the Bundesrat represented the federated Princes so the Reichstag\r\nrepresented the German people. Elected by direct and universal suffrage\r\nthe Reichstag had the right to initiate legislation; and no law was\r\noperative unless it had obtained a majority both in the Bundesrat and in\r\nthe Reichstag. Furthermore the Reichstag had the right to interpellate,\r\nnot the Secretaries of State but the Chancellor himself and to ask\r\nquestions; and discussions of a question could be closed by voting an\r\nexpression of the confidence of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire there were twenty-five states[1] and the territory of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine.\r\n\r\nThese states were governed by constitutions of the greatest variety.\r\nThere were three free cities, Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck; twenty-two\r\nmonarchies, which carried different titles; Kingdoms--Prussia,\r\nBavaria, Saxony, Wurtemberg; Grand Duchies--Baden, Hesse;\r\nDuchies--Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen; and Principalities--Waldeck,\r\nSchaumburg-Lippe, etc.\r\n\r\nAmong these states some, a large majority but the least important, had\r\nadopted the system of the single legislative chamber, which, with one\r\nor two exceptions, comprised, beside the deputies elected by universal\r\nsuffrage, members named by the princes of the state, or by special\r\nelectoral colleges such as groups of the heaviest tax payers, chambers\r\nof commerce, industrial and agricultural organizations, the clergy, the\r\nprofessions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe other states, four kingdoms and the Grand Duchies of Baden and of\r\nHesse, had two chambers each. The upper house was almost entirely\r\ncomposed of members of the reigning families or their kin and of\r\npersonages charged with representing the nobility or the great landed\r\nproprietors. The lower house was elected sometimes by universal suffrage,\r\nsometimes by a system of plural voting; or by a system that divided the\r\npopulation in such a way that the voice of the people was nullified\r\nalmost entirely in favor of the big taxpayers as in Prussia.\r\n\r\nAll this would present an erroneous and incomplete picture if one did not\r\ntake the precaution to search beyond the letter of these constitutions\r\nand inquire how the government of Germany was actually conducted. The\r\npolitical institutions of Germany presented a certain number of aspects\r\nwhich it is important to bring out clearly:[2]\r\n\r\n1. _These institutions were anti-democratic._ It is true the Reichstag\r\nwas elected by universal and direct suffrage. But, on the one hand the\r\nelectoral legislation of the Reich contained certain provisions which\r\nwere singularly behind the times, such as the denial to the poor of the\r\nright to vote, the fixing of the voting age at twenty-five, etc. On\r\nthe other hand, the Bundesrat, which was not elected, possessed powers\r\nsuperior to those of the Reichstag; and the latter could do nothing\r\nwithout the Bundesrat. The same situation existed within the individual\r\nstates, which either did not have a chamber elected by universal suffrage\r\nor else limited it in power by the check of an upper house, feudal and\r\nconservative in character.\r\n\r\n2. _These institutions were anti-parliamentary._ The Reichstag could\r\ninterpellate the Chancellor but could not depose him. To a question or\r\nto an interpellation the Chancellor was always free to respond that\r\nhe did not wish to reply; or he could fix his own time for replying;\r\nand finally, if he was in the minority in the house he did not have to\r\nresign.\r\n\r\n3. _The Reich encroached more and more on the domain of the individual\r\nstates._ This encroachment, this evolution toward unitarism, manifested\r\nitself in most divers ways. In military matters it took the form of a\r\nfusion of fighting contingents which belonged more or less nominally to\r\nthe various states, but which, with the exception perhaps of Bavaria,\r\nplaced their whole force at the direct command of the Emperor. As for\r\nBavaria, at the outbreak of the war its “reserved rights” had almost\r\ncompletely disappeared. The development of the legislation of the\r\nEmpire had accentuated this evolution toward unitarism. In the measure\r\nthat the Reich legislated in a large number of domains, it wiped out\r\nin these matters the different regulations that existed up to then in\r\nthe individual states. It is true that the execution of the national\r\nlegislation was entrusted to functionaries within these states; but these\r\nofficials were under the control of the Bundesrat and subject to the\r\nsupervision of the Reich. Even in financial matters the liberty of the\r\nindividual states was more and more limited. While it is true that they\r\nconserved their autonomy in matters of duties and taxes, the more the\r\nReich discovered new sources of revenue the more the legislation of the\r\nEmpire imposed on the several states the task of collecting this revenue\r\nand the more narrow became the scope in which the states could manage\r\ntheir own financial affairs, and the dependency of the states grew the\r\nmore on the financial legislation and the budgetary dispositions allowed\r\nthem by the Reich.[3]\r\n\r\n4. In contrast to the other federated states whose Constitutions were\r\nbased on the principle of equality of the component states, Germany was\r\nbased on the notion of the inequality of the states federated in it.\r\n_Prussia exercised a true hegemony in Germany._ In the Bundesrat it was\r\nrepresented by 17 votes whereas the other most favoured state, Bavaria,\r\nhad but 6; two others, Saxony and Wurtemberg, had only 4 each; two,\r\nBaden and Hesse, 3 each; Mecklenburg and Brunswick, 2 each; and all the\r\nothers but 1 apiece. In addition the Rhineland was also represented by\r\n3 votes in the Bundesrat but these votes were instructed by Prussia.\r\nThe latter, therefore, had 17 votes, 20 with those of Alsace-Lorraine,\r\n21 with that of Waldeck, since the latter by its treaty of entry into\r\nthe Confederation had abandoned its governmental rights to Prussia.\r\nIt had therefore numerically a third of the total strength of the\r\nBundesrat, while in actual influence it counted much more. Only Prussia\r\ncould feel assured that its representation made it mistress of the\r\nsituation in the Bundesrat; fourteen votes were sufficient to head off\r\na constitutional change. Consequently Prussia possessed absolute veto\r\npower. It must not be forgotten that the representatives of the Princes\r\nin the Bundesrat received imperative mandates from them and that the\r\nrepresentatives of the state had to cast their votes as a bloc--that\r\nis, as a unit. It mattered little, therefore, that such and such was\r\nthe numerical representation in the Bundesrat of the particular states,\r\nthat Prussia had 17 votes, Bavaria 6, etc. As to legislative changes\r\nrelating to the army or the navy, and to taxes feeding the treasury of\r\nthe Empire, nothing of this kind could be enacted if it was opposed by\r\nthe “presidency.” And the “presidency” belonged by undisputed right to\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\nIn the Reichstag Prussia exercised the same preponderance. The Reichstag\r\nwas composed of deputies, one for each 100,000 inhabitants. There Prussia\r\ncounted much more than half, for its population was nearly two-thirds\r\nthat of the whole Empire--40,165,217 out of 64,925,933. She also elected\r\n236 deputies out of the 397 that made up the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nTo the same degree she was in control of executive action. While\r\nsovereignty nominally resided in the assemblage of Princes in the\r\nBundesrath, it resided no less in the hands of the King of Prussia who\r\nhad full rights as the German Emperor; and it was he who nominated the\r\nChancellor, the sole responsible minister of the Empire. The Chancellor\r\nwas almost always a subject of the King of Prussia and, following a rule\r\nto which there were few exceptions, at the same time the Prime Minister\r\nof Prussia.\r\n\r\nThus, therefore, Prussia elected a majority in the Reichstag, and if\r\nby some extraordinary chance the latter voted against the desire of\r\nPrussia the decree could be nullified by the Prussian representative\r\nin the Bundesrath. The King of Prussia was Emperor. He nominated the\r\nChancellor, chief of all the administrative machinery of the state. The\r\nKing of Prussia was master of the government of the Empire. Germany was a\r\nveritable Prussia enlarged.\r\n\r\nWe can now distinguish the essential traits that characterized\r\nconstitutional Germany on the eve of the war. There was in Germany, under\r\nthe infinite complexity of written provisions, behind a deliberately\r\neffected juxtaposition of the most modern formula by the side of some of\r\nthe most archaic, a living reality. It was a despotic organization that\r\nplaced full power in the hands of a feudal monarch. It was, to put it in\r\nthe words of President Wilson, the largest enterprise of domination that\r\nthe world has ever known.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch a system and that which made it such an anachronism could not\r\nsurvive the test of war and still less that of defeat.\r\n\r\nAlready during the war several demands for reforms made themselves\r\nfelt. In proportion as the war was prolonged and the heavier became the\r\nburdens that weighed on the people together with the sacrifices that\r\nwere imposed upon them, there developed a pressure on the part of the\r\npeople for recognition, for compensation, for the right to participate\r\nin a more effective fashion in the conduct of public affairs. The\r\nReichstag appointed a commission to investigate to what extent it was\r\npossible to modify the Constitution of the Reich in conformity with\r\nthe desires of the people. On his part the Emperor in a message on\r\nApril 7, 1917, declared that it was the duty of the Chancellor to\r\nsatisfy the exigencies of new times with every means appropriate; and\r\nto reconstruct the constitutional edifice in such a way as to insure a\r\nfree and spontaneous collaboration of all the elements of the nation. The\r\nChancellor seemed to be in accord with the Emperor on the necessity and\r\nurgency of a “new orientation.”\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, 1917, Bethmann-Hollweg spoke of realizing a programme\r\nof “trusting collaboration of the Emperor and the nation.” On July 19,\r\n1917, Michaelis foreshadowed the establishment of a close contact between\r\na government and parliament, the creation of a bond of mutual confidence\r\nbetween the government of the Empire and the Reichstag, in the sense that\r\nthe management of various affairs should be entrusted to men who, aside\r\nfrom their professional abilities, would enjoy the full confidence of the\r\ngreat parties in the popular branch of the government.\r\n\r\nThey were nothing but vague words; and this “parliamentarization” of\r\nthe government of the Reich did not commence to show itself until\r\nthe pressure of defeat came, such as was felt in the summer of 1918.\r\nThe adoption of a parliamentary régime then seemed the sole means of\r\nobtaining from the masses the sacrifices which were still expected of\r\nthem both on the firing line and in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe true reforms commenced with the letter which the Emperor wrote\r\non September 30, 1918, to the departing Chancellor von Hertling, and\r\nwhich was a real message to the German people and to the Reichstag. “I\r\ndesire,” said the Emperor, “that the German people shall collaborate more\r\neffectively than in the past in the determination of the destiny of our\r\nFatherland. It is my wish therefore that men invested with the confidence\r\nof the people shall participate in a large measure in the rights and\r\nduties of the government.” Legally it was only an expression of the\r\nhitherto recognized imperial will. But from a political point of view\r\nthis message constituted the recognition of a new system of government,\r\nin virtue of which the centre of gravity of political institutions\r\npassed from the organs of the government, the Bundesrath and the Emperor,\r\nto the popular assembly, the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which the new reforms were to be carried out and the\r\nimportance which they were to assume were made clearer several days\r\nlater when, on October 5, 1918, Chancellor Maximilian of Baden in a\r\nprogramme speech addressed in the Reichstag said, “It is in the essence\r\nof the system of the government which we are now instituting that I now\r\nstate clearly and without reservation the principles by which I shall\r\nseek to fulfil my heavy responsibilities. These principles were accepted\r\nbefore I assumed my duties as Chancellor in an agreement reached between\r\nconfederated governments and the chiefs of the parties of the majority\r\nof this Chamber.… It is only when the people take an active part to the\r\nlargest measure in the determination of the destiny of the nation; and\r\nwhen the sense of responsibility is also shared by the majority of the\r\npolitical chiefs freely elected, that a statesman can accept direction of\r\nthe helm with confidence and himself participate in this responsibility.\r\nOtherwise the shoulders of one man will be too feeble to support the\r\nimmense responsibility that now confronts our government. I am convinced\r\nthat the manner in which the directing government has been formed to-day\r\nwith the collaboration of the Reichstag is not temporary in its nature\r\nand that in times of peace hereafter no government can be formed that has\r\nnot the support of the Reichstag, that does not lean on the Reichstag,\r\nand that does not take from the Reichstag its principal chiefs.”\r\n\r\nAs a consequence two laws were passed which carried the date of October\r\n28, 1918. They were designed to meet the three most important exigencies\r\nof the hour:\r\n\r\n1. _They realized the parliamentarization of the government of the\r\nReich._ Article 15 of the Constitution of 1871, which dealt with the\r\nnomination of the Chancellor had the following amendment added: “The\r\nChancellor in order to continue direction of the affairs of the Reich\r\nmust have the confidence of the Reichstag. The Chancellor is responsible\r\nfor all the political acts of the Emperor performed in the exercise\r\nof his constitutional rights. The Chancellor and his representatives\r\nare responsible for the conduct of affairs to the Bundesrat and the\r\nReichstag.”[4]\r\n\r\nThis text established not only the responsibility of the Chancellor;\r\nit also recognized constitutionally the right of parties or their\r\nparliamentary groups to participate in the nomination of the Chancellor\r\nand it specified that when the confidence of the Reichstag is withdrawn\r\nfrom the Chancellor he must resign.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the Chancellor, who was answerable both to the\r\nReichstag and to the Bundesrat, extended not only to the general and\r\nparticular decrees issued by the Emperor and countersigned by the\r\nChancellor but also to acts of a political nature on the part of\r\nthe Emperor; and it followed from this that the Chancellor and his\r\nrepresentatives were also responsible for their own actions of the same\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nFurther, one of the laws of October 28, 1918, in abrogating paragraph 2\r\nof Article 21 of the Constitution of 1871, permitted thereafter members\r\nof the Reichstag to become secretaries of state while fulfilling at the\r\nsame time their functions as members of the Reichstag. On the other hand\r\nthe incompatibility between the Bundesrat and the Reichstag (article 9,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Constitution of 1871) was not abolished. It followed\r\nfrom that, therefore, that while a member of the Reichstag could become\r\na Secretary of State, he could not become a member of the Bundesrat and\r\ntherefore could not become Chancellor; for that office was open only to\r\nmembers of the Bundesrat.\r\n\r\n2. The laws of October 28, 1918, broadened considerably the authority\r\nof the Reichstag and diminished correspondingly the Imperial authority\r\nin the right to declare war and conclude treaties. The Emperor could\r\nnever again under any circumstances declare war in the name of the Reich\r\nwithout the consent of the Reichstag and the Bundesrat. He was required\r\nto obtain the same consent of the two assemblies to conclude treaties of\r\npeace and all other treaties that touched matters in which either of the\r\nassemblies had competence.\r\n\r\n3. _The authority of the Emperor as military commander was put under\r\nparliamentary control._\r\n\r\nThese reforms constituted certainly important progress along the road of\r\nparliamentary rule and it can be said that it placed Germany thereafter\r\namong the nations that are governed by such a system.\r\n\r\nThe texts of the laws of October 28, 1918, were accompanied by a letter\r\nof the Emperor to the Chancellor in which he wrote: “Prepared by a series\r\nof governmental acts a new order comes into being in which fundamental\r\nrights of the Emperor pass to the people. After the events of these our\r\ntimes the German people must not be denied a single right that is needed\r\nto guarantee them a free and happy future. I acquiesce together with my\r\nhighest colleagues in the decisions of the representatives of the people\r\nand do so with the firm determination to co-operate to the greatest\r\neffectiveness, convinced that I will thus serve the welfare of the German\r\npeople. The Emperor is at the service of the people.”\r\n\r\nGerman jurists with good reason characterized this letter as a “political\r\nabdication.” But the changes which went with it came too late, and\r\na simple “political abdication” appeared thereafter as strikingly\r\ninsufficient. The German Empire was falling into ruin and it was no\r\nlonger a question of partial reforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE FALL OF THE OLD RÉGIME.\r\n\r\nRevolution broke out in Germany at the beginning of November, 1918.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of October riots and revolts had been taking place on board\r\nthe vessels of the Imperial navy. But on November 4 at Kiel there broke\r\nout a revolt among the sailors, who became masters of the situation. They\r\nformed a Council of Soldiers which presented to the mayor of the city a\r\nlist of demands--the liberation of arrested sailors; the suppression of a\r\nmilitary hierarchy outside of the service; a demand that the approval of\r\nthe Council of Soldiers be necessary for all military measures, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next day the workers of Kiel declared a general strike and formed\r\nWorkers Councils which united with Councils of Soldiers consisting of the\r\nmarines of the city.\r\n\r\nFrom Kiel the movement spread the same day to Lübeck and to Hamburg. On\r\nthe 6th, a general strike was proclaimed in the dock yards of Hamburg and\r\nrevolution broke out in Bremen.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously revolution won other cities: Hanover, Cologne, Magdeburg,\r\nBrunswick, Leipzig, and Dresden, where Councils of Workers and Soldiers\r\nwere formed. From November 4th to the 9th all North Germany, the South\r\nand the Centre fell into the hands of the Councils.\r\n\r\nThe movement, which at its beginning could be considered as principally\r\na military revolt, took on for the first time a political character most\r\nclearly marked in Munich, where in the night of the eighth of November\r\nafter a great manifestation by the Independent Socialists serious\r\ndisturbances broke out. The royal family was expelled and the Republic\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the revolutionists met with no opposition. The\r\nbourgeoisie did not react. It was enough for some thirty marines from\r\nKiel to enter a town or for a group of soldiers returning from the\r\nfighting front to present themselves at the city hall. Immediately\r\nevery one yielded to their orders and the Councils were able to install\r\nthemselves in power without firing a shot. In this revolution, to which\r\nno serious opposition had been presented and which appeared rather as the\r\ncollapse of an old régime whose reason for existence had vanished, there\r\nlacked only to complete it the fall of the capital and the abdication of\r\nthe monarch.\r\n\r\nAt Berlin the military power devoted itself to the defence of the city.\r\nOn the fifth a state of siege was proclaimed and on the seventh a decree\r\nforbade the formation of Councils of Soldiers and of Workers “on the\r\nRussian model.”\r\n\r\nBut the same day the Social Democrats sent to Chancellor Maximilian of\r\nBaden the Secretary of State Scheidemann, the bearer of an ultimatum\r\ndemanding the immediate abrogation of the decree forbidding meetings;\r\nsuch a transformation of the government of Prussia that those in control\r\nof it should be of the same political complexion as the majority of\r\nthe Reichstag; the strengthening of the Social Democratic influence\r\nin the government; and finally the abdication of the Emperor and the\r\nrenunciation by the Crown Prince of all claims to the throne.\r\n\r\nAlthough confronted with imminent revolution only officials and\r\nfunctionaries were overthrown. The bourgeoisie here as elsewhere looked\r\non passively and attempted no resistance.\r\n\r\nAs for Maximilian of Baden he hoped to find a basis for negotiation. He\r\npondered measures to parliamentarize still further the old government\r\nand contemplated the immediate convocation of a constituent assembly to\r\ndevelop a new constitution. Meanwhile he did not reply to the ultimatum\r\nof the Social Democrats. Whereupon there were organized Councils of\r\nWorkers and Soldiers in Berlin who made themselves felt with their first\r\nact on the morning of the ninth of November by declaring a general\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor could no longer delay action. On the ninth at two o’clock\r\nin the afternoon, after a telephonic conversation with William II, he\r\nannounced officially that the Emperor had abdicated and that the Crown\r\nPrince had renounced the throne. He declared that he, Maximilian of\r\nBaden, would remain in office until the installation of the Regent. He\r\nwould propose to the Regent the nomination as Chancellor of the Social\r\nDemocratic leader Ebert, and the convocation of electoral colleges with\r\nthe view of choosing a national constituent assembly to which would be\r\ngiven the task of directing the future of the state.\r\n\r\nThus the Chancellor hoped to the last moment to effect in an almost legal\r\nmanner the transition from the old to the new Germany. But the pressure\r\nof events was too strong for him and he was not able to realize his hope.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the afternoon, Ebert accompanied by Scheidemann\r\nappeared at the Chancellery and declared in the name of their party that\r\nin order to avoid bloodshed and to maintain public order they considered\r\nit necessary to take power in their hands and assume the direction of the\r\ngovernment. When Vice-Chancellor von Payer asked Ebert if he intended\r\nto conduct the government on the basis of the Constitution or in the\r\nname of the Councils of Workers and Soldiers, Ebert replied, “Within the\r\nframe work of the constitution.” After short deliberation and in view of\r\nthe fact that the troops in Berlin had deserted the old government the\r\ncabinet of Maximilian decided to place in the hands of Ebert the powers\r\nof Chancellor of the Empire “subject to the approval of the legislature.”\r\nEbert at once entered into office without the question of the regency\r\nbeing decided.\r\n\r\nBut the Socialist parties pressed for the proclamation of a republic.\r\nThis proclamation took place several minutes after the installation of\r\nEbert as Chancellor. In answer to the clamor of a great gathering of the\r\npeople in front of the Reichstag Scheidemann appeared on the terrace and\r\ndeclared in substance, “We have conquered everywhere along the line.\r\nThe old régime is no more. Ebert is Chancellor. Our deputy, Lieutenant\r\nGöhre, is associate minister of war. We must now strengthen our victory\r\nand nothing will stop our march. The Hohenzollerns have abdicated. Let\r\nus see to it that this magnificent day is marred by nothing. May this be\r\na day of eternal glory in the history of Germany. Long live the German\r\nRepublic!”\r\n\r\nThe same day and almost the same hour similar events took place in all\r\nthe states of Germany. Everywhere under the threat and under the pressure\r\nof the Councils of Workers and Soldiers the old Diets and the old\r\ngovernments vanished. The kings, the grand dukes and the dukes resigned\r\nor were simply replaced. The republic was proclaimed. One can say that on\r\nNovember 9, 1918, when at two in the afternoon in front of the Reichstag\r\nScheidemann proclaimed the Republic, the ancient régime had fallen in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this date on all the organs of government which had incarnated the\r\nold régime disappeared or were entirely transformed.\r\n\r\nThe Bundesrat, in which the sovereignty of the old Reich was\r\nincorporated, ceased to exist as such. It is true that the new leaders\r\nof the Reich permitted the Bundesrat “the right to continue the exercise\r\nof administrative powers according to laws and regulations” (decree of\r\nNovember 14, 1918); and thus there continued a Bundesrat of limited\r\npower. But it was no longer the old Bundesrat, for the governments of the\r\nindividual states, having changed through revolution, sent new delegates\r\nwho no longer represented princes but republics.\r\n\r\nNaturally there was no longer any question of the Emperor. Having lost\r\nhis crown on November 9, he fled across the Dutch frontier on the 10th,\r\nas a private individual and his letter from Amerongen on November 28,\r\n1918, in which he, William II, declared that he expressly renounced for\r\nall time the crown of Prussia and thereby “the Imperial German crown,”\r\nhad only, so to speak, a moral effect.\r\n\r\nAfter the resignation of Maximilian of Baden there was no longer a\r\nChancellor of the Empire. It is true that he had passed on his powers to\r\nEbert but we will see shortly that Ebert did not consider himself as such\r\nexcept for a few hours.\r\n\r\nAs for the Reichstag whose last session ended on October 26, 1918, it was\r\nnot exactly dissolved after the revolution. At the same time no formal\r\ndissolution was necessary, for a new sovereignty had been installed and\r\nhad taken the place of the old Reichstag. Meanwhile, taking advantage of\r\nthe fact that no formal decision had been made as to the old Reichstag\r\nthe chairman of that assembly, Fehrenbach, refused to recognize its\r\nimplied dissolution. On November 12, 1918, he addressed a circular to the\r\ndeputies in which he declared that owing to the exigencies of the hour\r\nand without the consent of the government he would convoke the Reichstag,\r\nreserving to himself the right to announce later the time and place of\r\nthe assembly. The revolutionary government thereupon notified Fehrenbach\r\nthat a conflict would ensue thereat. Notwithstanding this Fehrenbach\r\nseveral days later repeated the announcement of the convocation. But the\r\nold Reichstag never met again. In February, 1919, it was dissolved by\r\ndecree which also declared that its last session was dated as of November\r\n9, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE REPUBLIC OF THE COUNCILS.\r\n\r\nWhile the Empire was collapsing there arose quickly on the ruins of the\r\nold edifice a new structure. In place of the Empire, the government\r\nof a bourgeois and military oligarchy, came the dictatorship of the\r\nproletarian masses at one blow, the republic of the working class.\r\nEverywhere Councils of Workers and Soldiers were formed, which, taking\r\npolitical power in their hands, appeared to be thereafter the only and\r\nreal holders of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nBut the Councils lacked the needed agreement in aim and action. Two\r\ndiametrically opposed tendencies divided the new powers in control.\r\nOn the one hand the members of the Social Democratic party within the\r\nCouncils pursued a purely political goal--the creation of a German\r\nrepublic on a democratic basis to be effected by a Constituent Assembly\r\nto be convoked as soon as possible. On the other hand the Independent\r\nSocialists, the Communists, the Spartacists and other left wing elements\r\nset up as the principal aim an economic change--the quick and complete\r\nsocialization of all means of production. But they also had in view\r\na political objective, the establishment of a dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat on the model of the Russian Soviet Republic, by the complete\r\norganization of the system of Councils of Workers and Soldiers. The\r\nparticular question on which the antagonism between these two groups\r\nbroke out was whether or not there should be called a new constituent\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nThe revolution was undoubtedly the work of the Independents. Their\r\nleader, Ernest Däumig, had been to Moscow to study the Bolshevist\r\nmovement, and Russia had come back with him in the persons of Joffe and\r\nhis agents of propaganda. Already during the strikes of January, 1918,\r\nwhich had been organized by them, there had appeared for the first time\r\nin Germany Workers Councils; and in the days preceding the insurrection\r\nof November, 1918, Councils of Workers and Soldiers had been secretly\r\norganized at Kiel as well as in Berlin. The Social Democrats, on the\r\nother hand, to the last moment warned the people against the consequences\r\nof an ill-considered insurrection. But when the success of the revolts\r\nseemed assured it was seen that many who had condemned it were now\r\njoining it. Thanks to Maximilian of Baden it was the Social Democrats,\r\nEbert and Scheidemann and the trade unions that were installed in power\r\non the 9th of November, 1918. The history of the German revolution is\r\nthe story of a revolution made by one political group and its fruits\r\ngarnered by another. At first the two Socialist parties divided power\r\nequally. But after several weeks of collaboration the Social Democrats\r\neliminated the Independents and remained in sole control of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. AT FIRST THE TWO SOCIALIST PARTIES PARTICIPATE EQUALLY IN CONTROL.--On\r\nthe 9th of November early in the afternoon Ebert had received from the\r\nformer Imperial cabinet his functions of Chancellor of the Empire. He\r\nconsidered himself such at the time. His intention was to nominate\r\nScheidemann and Landsberg as secretaries of state, but to keep in the\r\ncabinet the old state secretaries; in addition to which the Independent\r\nSocialists were to enter the government. He proclaimed immediately\r\nseveral decrees signed, “Chancellor of the Empire, Ebert.”\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that up to then the change which had been brought\r\nabout constituted without doubt a revolution, but a revolution remarkably\r\nmoderate. It is true that constitutional right did not give the\r\nChancellor the authority to name his successor; from the legal point of\r\nview the nomination of Ebert certainly constituted a violation of the old\r\nconstitutional law. Nevertheless in its outer aspect the new government\r\nwith Ebert at the head sought to appear as the expression of the will of\r\nthe former government. The idea of a radically new law had not yet made\r\nits appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few hours, however, the situation completely changed.\r\nThe Independents submitted as the condition of their entry into the\r\ngovernment the following twofold demand: The cabinet was to consist\r\nonly of socialists, and it was to recognize officially that political\r\nsovereignty resided in the hands of the Workers and Soldiers Councils.\r\nThe next day the Social Democrats accepted these conditions--for the\r\nIndependents were still the actual power in control and “the street\r\nbelonged to them”--and a government of six chiefs was constituted. It\r\ncomprised three Socialist Democrats, Ebert, Scheidemann and Landsberg,\r\nand three Independents, Haase, Dittmann and Barth.[5] In the evening\r\nthere was held at the Busch Circus a plenary session of the Workers and\r\nSoldiers Councils of Berlin. This assembly passed a resolution which\r\ndeclared among other things the following: “Old Germany is no more. The\r\ndynasties are gone forever. The holders of thrones are stripped of their\r\npower. Germany is now a Republic, a Socialist Republic. The Workers and\r\nSoldiers Councils are now the holders of political power.” Then the\r\nassembly nominated an executive committee (Vollzugsrat) of twenty-four\r\nmembers, six Social Democrats, six Independents, and twelve Soldiers, and\r\nthey proclaimed as the men in control of the government the six named\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nFollowing this meeting the cabinet was constituted. It formed a “college”\r\nof which all the members had equal rights and which took the name of\r\n“Council of Commissars of the People” (Rat der Volksbeauftragten); Ebert\r\nand Haase were nominated chairmen. All the decrees of the government\r\nwould have to be promulgated by these two in accord and signed jointly by\r\nthem. It was, so to speak, a Chancellorship of two.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Commissars of the People thus found itself invested with\r\npolitical power by the General Assembly of the Councils of Workers\r\nand Soldiers of Berlin. Making immediate use of its power the Council\r\nof Commissars issued on November 12, 1918, a proclamation which\r\nconstituted a declaration of rights of the new régime: The state of\r\nsiege was revoked. Freedom of assembly and meeting were restored without\r\nrestriction. All political offences were amnestied. The eight-hour day\r\nwent into effect on January 1, 1919. All elections thereafter would\r\nbe held on the basis of equal, direct, universal suffrage based on\r\nproportional representation for all men and women who had passed the\r\ntwentieth birthday, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut difficulties arose soon between The Council of Commissars of the\r\nPeople and the Executive Committee of the Workers and Soldiers Councils\r\nof Berlin. Each of these two bodies considered itself the chief holder\r\nof sovereignty and launched proclamations issuing orders. It became\r\nabsolutely necessary to put precise limits to their respective powers.\r\nThat was the object of an agreement reached by these two bodies November\r\n22, 1918.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of this agreement sovereignty belonged wholly\r\nto the Executive Committee. The Council of Commissars was to exercise\r\nexecutive power under the permanent control of the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\nThe latter had the power to nominate or recall members of the Council\r\nof Commissars. In reality the situation was somewhat different; for\r\nthe Council of Commissars exercised to some extent legislative powers\r\naccording to which it claimed the right to issue decrees that had the\r\nforce of laws.\r\n\r\nFor a month the two bodies worked in this accord. Collisions occurred,\r\nof course. The functionaries of the old régime endured impatiently the\r\nsupervision of the Councils of Workers and Soldiers. Inflaming rumours\r\ncirculated of the extravagance with which these Councils managed the\r\npublic finances. Worst of all was the increasing opposition that\r\ndeveloped all over the country to the Executive Committee of Workers\r\nand Soldiers Councils, which, consisting exclusively of Berlin members,\r\nclaimed to represent the Councils of all Germany and which acted in\r\neffect as though it were delegated by the Councils of the whole country.\r\nThe fact that on November 23 this Executive Committee had added to itself\r\na certain number of delegates of Workers and Soldiers Councils of states\r\nother than Prussia, delegates who had authority to deliberate in matters\r\nthat concerned all of Germany, did not strengthen the position of the\r\nExecutive Committee. Meanwhile, however, its machinery appeared to be\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ELIMINATE THE INDEPENDENTS AND REMAIN IN SOLE\r\nCONTROL.--In the struggle that ensued among socialists, the Social\r\nDemocrats brought to their side the support first of individual states,\r\nthen that of a general Congress of Workers and Soldiers Councils.\r\n\r\n1. From November 10 Ebert and his party showed an increasing\r\ndetermination to call a constituent assembly. However, they did not\r\nattempt to act upon it at once, being restrained by the strength that\r\nstill lay in the hands of the Councils. But on November 25 under the name\r\nof “the conference of German Federated States” there was held at Berlin\r\na meeting of representatives of the revolutionary governments of several\r\nstates. It was presided over by the Commissar of the People, Ebert.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the forthcoming constitution, Ebert declared, “The system\r\nof collaboration between the government of the Reich and the Federated\r\nStates, which should be very definitely specified, must be established\r\nby a National Assembly. The government has firmly resolved to call\r\nthis National Assembly with the least delay. Till then nothing but a\r\nprovisional agreement can be effected between the Reich and the States.”\r\nIn the course of the discussion the most conflicting opinions possible\r\nwere expressed; but finally the immense majority of the delegates present\r\nadopted the following twofold resolution:\r\n\r\n“It is to a National Assembly that the power of establishing the\r\nconstitution of the Reich should be entrusted. Till such a time, however,\r\nthe Workers and Soldiers Councils are the representatives of the will of\r\nthe people.”\r\n\r\nStrengthened by this decision the Council of the Commissars of the People\r\npromulgated on November 30 a decree for the election of a National\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n2. It was the general congress of Workers and Soldiers Councils at its\r\nmeetings in Berlin from December 16 to 20, more than any other factor,\r\nthat gave the Social Democrats the opportunity they had been seeking to\r\ndisembarrass themselves of the Executive Committee of the Workers and\r\nSoldiers Councils of Berlin; and by this means to deliver a decisive\r\nblow at the system of Councils as a whole. The Social Democrats had\r\nan overwhelming majority in this congress and the delegates, well\r\ndisciplined and little familiar with parliamentary debate, carried out\r\npunctiliously the instructions which had been given them by the official\r\nspokesmen.\r\n\r\nThe congress passed a number of important resolutions:\r\n\r\na. _The Councils or Soviet System is rejected._--On December 19 by a\r\nvote of 334 against 98 the congress rejected the motion made by Däumig\r\nthat “under all circumstances the Councils system shall be adhered to as\r\nthe basis of the Socialist Republic in the sense that the Councils shall\r\npossess supreme legislative, executive and judiciary powers.”\r\n\r\nb. _The Council of the Commissars of the People is strengthened._--The\r\ncongress, which declared itself invested with complete political power,\r\ndelegated legislative and executive power to the Council of Commissars\r\nof the People up to the time the National Assembly convened. Further, it\r\nnominated a central committee (Zentralrat) of the Workers and Soldiers\r\nCouncils of Germany, consisting of twenty-seven members which was to\r\nexercise parliamentary control over the German and Prussian cabinets;\r\nthat is to say, according to the official explanation of Commissar of the\r\nPeople Haase, all projects of law must be submitted by the Council of the\r\nCommissars of the People to the Central Committee and discussed by them.\r\nThe Central Committee had the right to appoint and recall Commissars of\r\nthe People for Prussia and for the Reich. Finally the Council of the\r\nCommissars of the People was to appoint to each Secretary of State two\r\ndelegates, a Social Democrat and an Independent, who would be charged\r\nwith the conduct of affairs within the ministries. As for the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Workers and Soldiers Councils of Berlin it was limited\r\nby the congress to authority only in matters pertaining to the Berlin\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nc. _Elections for the National Assembly are held January 19, 1919._--The\r\nvictory of the Social Democrats was complete. The Independents, because\r\nof the small number of representatives they had elected, refused to form\r\na part of the Central Committee, which thereupon consisted only of Social\r\nDemocrats and was presided over by Leinert, then by Max Cohen, both very\r\nmoderate in their opinions. The conflict between the Executive Committee\r\nof Workers and Soldiers Councils of Berlin and the Central Committee\r\nnever gave the government any trouble.\r\n\r\nBut the Independents and the Spartacists had not at all decided to give\r\nup the game, for they believed themselves to be at least “masters of\r\nthe street.” And Christmas week of 1918 in Berlin was a bloody one. A\r\ndetachment of marines which had installed itself in the royal castle\r\nand had refused to leave it in spite of the orders of the government\r\nof Prussia had tried to capture Commissars of the People, Ebert and\r\nLandsberg, to keep them as hostages against the non-payment of wages due\r\nthem. Their attempt failed and troops were summoned by the government to\r\nforce the sailors to leave the castle. Bloody fights ensued in Berlin\r\nwhich lasted till Christmas.\r\n\r\nThese events produced a crisis in the government. On December 29 the\r\nIndependents, Haase, Dittmann, and Barth, resigned from the Council of\r\nthe Commissars of the People; whereupon the remaining three Commissars\r\nimmediately handed their resignations to the Central Committee. The\r\nlatter reappointed the three Social Democrats and completed the\r\nGovernment by adding to them three new Commissars, all Social Democrats,\r\nNoske, Wissel, Löbe. Löbe declined and his post remained vacant; but\r\nNoske and Wissel entered the Government. Scheidemann replaced Haase as\r\nco-president with Ebert.\r\n\r\nThe Independents and the Communists made another attempt. On January 3,\r\nthe Independents who had entered the Government of Prussia handed in\r\ntheir resignations. But Eichhorn, since the revolution president of the\r\nBerlin police, refused to resign his powers and, being recalled, refused\r\nto relinquish his post. That was the signal for a veritable insurrection\r\nwhich had been called, not without reason, “the second revolution.”\r\nTroops of Spartacists met in bloody encounters in the streets with the\r\ntroops of Noske and the affair ended with the assassination of Karl\r\nLiebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nWhen, three days later the elections for the National Assembly took\r\nplace, Germany found itself under an exclusively Social Democratic\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly elected on January 19, 1919, had as its foremost\r\ntask the conclusion of peace and the creation of a new constitution for\r\nGermany. But in view of the problems that it was confronted with, it\r\nwill be difficult to understand precisely how it was led to take this or\r\nthat position and to know how to reconcile the intent of the different\r\nresolutions voted if one does not keep constantly in mind the spirit in\r\nwhich they were drawn up, the forces that met in conflict within the\r\nAssembly, and the proportion of strength they bore to one another--if one\r\ndoes not follow at least in its ensemble the long process of elaboration\r\nin the midst of which the work of the Assembly was accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE COMPOSITION OF THE ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly had been elected according to what was perhaps\r\nthe most democratic suffrage ever known.\r\n\r\nAll Germans were electors, men and women, soldiers and officers, poor and\r\nfeeble, provided they had passed the twentieth birthday. All electors\r\nwere eligible to vote who had been Germans for at least a year.\r\n\r\nThe election took place on the basis of general tickets which could\r\nnot be “split,” that is, an elector could not vote for candidates of\r\ndifferent tickets; but facility was offered for parties to present lists\r\nin common.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of seats followed the system of proportional\r\nrepresentation known under the name of Hondt.\r\n\r\nThese elections sent to the Assembly 423 deputies, of whom 39 were women.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme right were the German Nationalists (Deutschnationalen)\r\nwith forty-two members. They were the former Conservatives of whom the\r\nleast one can say is that they had learned but little from the war. It\r\nwas the party of the big landed proprietors and the big manufacturers.\r\nPolitically they declared themselves in December, 1918, in favour of\r\nthe restoration of the monarchy and willing to accept a parliamentary\r\nmonarchy. Economically they did not ask a single reform. Reactionary\r\nin politics they were in economic matters strongly conservative. Their\r\nleaders, Clemens von Delbrück, former minister of the Emperor and\r\nformer chief of the Emperor’s civil cabinet, Düringer, raised their\r\nvoices whenever it was necessary to defend the old régime, opposing all\r\ndiminution in Prussia’s share of the government, and combatting every\r\ndemocratic institution.\r\n\r\nTo the left of them sat twenty-two members of the German People’s Party\r\n(Deutsche Volkspartei). The name is new; their ideas resembled those\r\nof the former National-Liberals.[6] It was the party of business men.\r\nOf the future form of government they said nothing. In fact, most of\r\nthem remained monarchists, but that was a minor question. Their main\r\nconcern was to establish in a tranquil and well regulated state freedom\r\nof commerce and a guarantee of protection for private property. They did\r\nnot shut their eyes completely to the realities of the hour and intended\r\nto scrutinize certain reforms which it would be useless to oppose; such\r\nas new governmental monopolies, the participation of workers in industry\r\ncontrol, etc. They were nationalist in feeling and would not sign a peace\r\nexcept one that safeguarded the economic prosperity of Germany. They were\r\ndemocrats in the sense that they were in favor of a strict legal equality\r\nfor all persons. This group was presided over by Stresemann, whose\r\ncleverness in manipulating the parliamentary game was widely recognized.\r\n\r\nThen came the Centre with eighty-nine deputies. Of all the parties it\r\nwas this one that remained since its inception most faithful to itself.\r\nIts programme had not changed. It contained several propositions which\r\nformed its solid framework and for which the party was prepared to fight\r\nwith all its power: the union of Church and State, confessional public\r\nschools, liberty of instruction, etc. On the political and economical\r\nproblems of the hour the Centre certainly had its opinions; but it always\r\nended by conceding whatever was necessary to safeguard the essential\r\nprinciples of a religious state and of freedom of instruction. Among\r\nthose elected to the Centre there were Fehrenbach, who presided over the\r\nAssembly, Trimborn, Professor Beyerle, and Erzberger, whose indefatigable\r\nactivities and limitless fertility of resources assured him perhaps a\r\npreponderant rôle in the government for some months, and who as much as\r\nthe Minister of Finance was to effect a fundamental reform in the German\r\nfiscal system.\r\n\r\nThen came seventy-four Democrats. Their party was born after the\r\nrevolution of 1918 of a fusion of the old Progressives with the group of\r\nNational-Liberals who did not go with the _Volkspartei_. Their program\r\nwas that of the classic liberalism: national sovereignty, universal\r\nsuffrage, equality of right of all citizens, individual rights, the right\r\nof private property and commerce. They opposed the intervention of the\r\nState except in extraordinary circumstances. This party attempted to\r\ngroup about itself all Germans in favour of a bourgeois republic, and was\r\nresolute in its opposition to both reaction and revolutionary socialism.\r\nThis group counted among its members some of the men whose personal worth\r\nimpressed itself on the assembly and who played rôles perhaps the most\r\nimportant in the development of the constitution--Haussmann, president of\r\nthe committee on the Constitution; Frederick Naumann, whose idealism had\r\nfree reign when he proposed with Beyerle the list of fundamental rights\r\nand duties of the Germans; Dernburg, Minister for the Colonies under the\r\nold régime and Minister of Finance under the Revolution; Koch of Cassel,\r\nfuture minister, and others.\r\n\r\nThere were 163 Social Democrats. They formed the most numerous group\r\nin the Assembly but, accustomed to the facile negations of opposition\r\nthey seemed little prepared for the constructive rôle, at that time\r\nparticularly difficult, which their electoral success suddenly called\r\nupon them to exercise. Theoretically they declared themselves faithful\r\nto the programme of Erfurt and to the Marxian theory of the class\r\nstruggle. But at the same time they declared their faith in democracy,\r\nopposed all dictatorship and counted only on universal suffrage and the\r\nparliamentary régime to effect their socialistic reforms. It is from\r\nthis Social Democratic group that there came the three Chancellors who\r\ngoverned Germany while the National Assembly sat--Scheidemann, Bauer and\r\nHermann Müller. It is to this group that belonged Legien, president of\r\nthe German Federation of Labour, Wissel who as Minister tried in vain to\r\norganize systematic control of business, and the Ministers Noske, David,\r\nthe deputy Sinzheimer, who drew up the remarkable report on the Workers\r\nCouncils, and others.\r\n\r\nFinally there came the group of Independents of whom there were\r\ntwenty-two. They accused the Social Democrats of having betrayed the\r\ncause of Socialism. As for their own program they did not specify any\r\nmeasures more definite than did the Social Democrats. They contented\r\nthemselves with demanding that socialization be immediately commenced\r\nin order to break capitalist domination, to promote production to the\r\nhighest possible degree and to distribute the fruits thereof among all\r\ncitizens. Their spokesmen were Cohn and Haase, former Commissar of the\r\nPeople, who was later assassinated in July, 1919.\r\n\r\nTo sum up one can present the following table of the forces of the\r\nrespective parties in the National Assembly:\r\n\r\n         PARTY                         VOTES        DEPUTIES\r\n\r\n    German National People’s Party   3,200,000     42  (3 women)\r\n    German People’s Party            1,200,000     22  (1 woman)\r\n    Centre                           6,000,000     89  (6 women)\r\n    Democrats                        5,600,000     74  (7 women)\r\n    Social Democrats                11,400,000    163  (17 women)\r\n    Independents                     2,300,000     22  (3 women)\r\n    Other parties                      500,000      9  (2 women)\r\n\r\nBesides these, troops from the Western front sent two deputies, both\r\nSocial Democrats.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION OF FEBRUARY 10, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe National Constituent Assembly met at Weimar February 6, 1919. It\r\nwisely avoided meeting in Berlin where it would be tempting prey for\r\norganizers of revolts and insurrections.\r\n\r\nElected by the people the Assembly incorporated the sovereignty of the\r\npeople. It was the supreme power. That power was universally accorded to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe first question that had to be dealt with by the Assembly was that\r\nof a provisional government of Germany. It was true that a Constitution\r\nwas to be adopted by the Assembly eventually; but that would be a labour\r\nof several months at least. Meanwhile it would be necessary for Germany\r\nto be governed in its internal affairs by some authority created in the\r\nspirit of democracy, one which could be represented abroad by delegates\r\nof the German people. A provisional constitution would have to be\r\nadopted, and adopted at once.\r\n\r\nOn February 8 Secretary of State of the Interior Preuss submitted a draft\r\nof a provisional government of the Reich. It was only an improvisation.\r\nCommencing with January 25, 1919, a conference of more than one hundred\r\nrepresentatives of different states met with the Minister of the Interior\r\nto consider the project of this provisional constitution. The draft\r\npresented by Preuss was approved by them. This gave assurance that no\r\nfundamental objections would be raised. On the other hand, to assure a\r\nquick vote on it the author of the project had prudently avoided all\r\nvexing questions whose immediate settlement was not indispensable; and\r\non the questions which he had to treat he wisely did so in the spirit of\r\ncompromise. Thanks to these precautions the draft by Preuss was adopted\r\non February 10. It dealt with these four points:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS.--The National Assembly was to retain all power in\r\ndealing with this province. Elected above all to furnish Germany with a\r\nconstitution this was its essential work.\r\n\r\nOnly the Assembly could decide constitutional questions and could\r\ndo so without consulting anybody else. Meanwhile, however, although\r\nkeeping control the members could limit themselves, if they wished,\r\nin authority--and this is one of the instances in the provisional\r\nconstitution characterized by its spirit of compromise--if this\r\nlimitation seemed to them in the general interest and necessary to the\r\nprompt accomplishment of their work. In fact, the National Assembly\r\nlimited itself in this matter of the constitution only on one point,\r\na fundamental one--the territorial status of the states. According to\r\nArticle 4, paragraph 2, of the law dealing with that question “the\r\nterritories of the component republics cannot be modified except by their\r\nconsent.” This meant that the sovereign National Assembly did not permit\r\neven itself to change the territorial map of Germany. Minister Preuss\r\nexplained to the Assembly that he had to make this concession, for they\r\ncould not with a stroke of the pen and by a simple decision change the\r\nboundaries of the respective states without their consent. This provision\r\nwas necessary to reassure the states, being given especially in view of\r\nthe announced intentions of the government of the Reich on a territorial\r\nregrouping and a partition of Prussia. But it was distinctly specified by\r\nPreuss that this provision would hold only until the definitive action on\r\nthe Constitution by the Assembly. For in this Constitution the National\r\nAssembly could of its own accord and without limitations take whatever\r\ndecision it wished. In other words after the definite adoption of the\r\nConstitution the states could no longer invoke article 4, paragraph 3 of\r\nthe law of February 10, 1919, in order to oppose the operation of article\r\n18 of the Constitution of Weimar,[7] in case an individual state were so\r\nminded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. ORDINARY LAWS.--The National Assembly had other work to do besides\r\nthe Constitution. They recognized (Article 1 of the law of February 10,\r\n1919) that beside the Constitution they had to vote “other urgent laws\r\nfor the Reich.” But here in contrast to the procedure in the adoption of\r\nconstitutional laws the National Assembly did not adopt laws except in\r\nagreement with the representatives of the individual states. No project\r\ncould become a law until it was accepted both by the representatives of\r\nthe individual states and by the National Assembly. For this purpose the\r\nlaw of February 10, 1919, created a Commission of States.\r\n\r\nThis Commission recalled in several respects the old Bundesrat but\r\ndiffered fundamentally in certain other respects. It was composed of\r\nrepresentatives of all the German states whose governments were based\r\non the confidence in them of their representative assemblies elected\r\nby universal suffrage. Each state had at least one vote; but the more\r\nimportant states could have additional votes; one vote for every million\r\ninhabitants, and a fraction in excess would be counted as a supplementary\r\nvote provided that fraction was equal at least to the number of\r\ninhabitants of the least populous state in the Reich. No state was\r\nallowed more than two-thirds of the total number of votes. Some writers\r\nfind this reform important. “The traditional proportion of representation\r\nis broken,” writes Apelt in “Das Werden der neuen Reichsverfassung,\r\nDeutsche Juristen Zeitung,” 1919, p. 205. “It has been replaced by the\r\nmodern principle of the distribution of influence according to the number\r\nof inhabitants.” But we must not delude ourselves. The application of\r\nparagraph 2 of the law of February 10 resulted in the following: Prussia\r\nhad 19 votes, Bavaria 7, Saxony 5, Wurtemberg 3, the Grand Duchy of Baden\r\n3, the Grand Duchy of Hesse 2; the other states one each, in all 58, and\r\nafter the fusion of the two states of Reuss, 57. Thus Prussia had two\r\nvotes more than in the Bundesrat, Bavaria and Saxony each one vote more,\r\nWurtemberg, Hesse, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Brunswick each at least one\r\nvote. If one considers the loss of Alsace-Lorraine and the disappearance\r\nof the two Reuss states it is quite remarkable to note that in the\r\nBundesrat and in the Commission of States the total number of votes was\r\nexactly the same and the distribution almost the same in both.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commission of States differed in other respects from the\r\nBundesrat, especially in authority. It is true that as formerly no law\r\ncould be enacted except with the approval of the Assembly. But now the\r\ncentre of gravity of political power passed from the Assembly of States\r\nto the popular assembly. From this came the following consequences:\r\nformerly if a projected law emanating from the Presidency of the Empire\r\ndid not secure a majority in the Bundesrat it could not be considered\r\nby the Reichstag, and was thereby definitely buried. Whereas now the\r\ngovernment could submit for decision by the National Assembly a project\r\nwhich had been rejected by the Commission of States. Formerly, too, in a\r\ndisagreement between the two assemblies over a projected law which the\r\nReichstag had accepted but the Bundesrat had rejected, the last word\r\nrested with the negative party, that is to say, the Bundesrat, where\r\nnaturally the project was buried. Now, however, the government was never\r\nbound by a decision of the majority of the Commission of States and it\r\ncould always bring a project up again before the National Assembly, which\r\nhad been defeated in the Commission. The members of the government of the\r\nReich and those of the Commission of States had the right to participate\r\nin the National Assembly and defend their respective points of view;\r\nbut it was the National Assembly that always made the final decision.\r\nIf, however, a discord between the two Assemblies could not be broken\r\nthe President of the Reich had the right to submit this difference to a\r\npopular referendum for decision. This situation, however, has not as yet\r\npresented itself.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the former Bundesrat and the new Commission of\r\nStates were considerable. The champions of a united Reich criticized the\r\nCommission as an obstacle to the foundation of a united German Republic\r\nand this objection seemed from their point of view justifiable. It must\r\nbe noted also that the provisional constitution does not specify which,\r\nthe state’s parliament or its government, in each member state nominates\r\nthe delegates to the Commission. We know only that the members of the\r\nCommission of States had an imperative mandate, for its representatives\r\ndefended the point of view of their governments.\r\n\r\nA law became operative when it was adopted by both the National Assembly\r\nand the Commission of States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3. THE PRESIDENT OF THE REICH.--The Provisional Constitution placed at\r\nthe head of the Reich a president.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Reich had to be elected by an absolute majority of\r\nthe National Assembly. He was to remain in power until the inauguration\r\nof the president elected in conformity with the permanent constitution.\r\n\r\nTo avoid discussions which would retard the adoption of the law and not\r\nto have to specify the powers of the president the provision attributed\r\nto him generally the powers of a chief of state in a modern republic.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Provisional Constitution specifically described the\r\nauthority of the president on certain particular points which because of\r\nspecial circumstances and on account of German traditions were especially\r\ndelicate. The right to declare war and to conclude peace was taken away\r\nfrom him and given to the National Assembly. He represented the Reich,\r\nhowever, in foreign relations, accredited and received ambassadors and\r\nsigned treaties. But in this last respect his right was limited by two\r\nrestrictions. He could not without the consent of the National Assembly\r\nand of the Commission of States conclude any treaty containing matters on\r\nwhich the authority rested with these bodies; and were Germany to enter\r\na league of nations that excludes secret treaties, all the treaties with\r\nstates which are members of that league would have to be submitted to the\r\napproval of the National Assembly and the Commission of States. In other\r\nwords, secret treaties were in principle forbidden; but in order not to\r\nplace Germany in a disadvantageous position with regard to other states\r\nit was specified that this prohibition would be effective only in regard\r\nto treaties with other states that forbade secret treaties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n4. THE MINISTERS.--The president of the Reich nominated a ministry\r\ncharged with the government of the Reich.\r\n\r\nThe law specified nothing on the organization of the ministry. However,\r\nthere were several provisions which clearly indicated an essentially\r\nparliamentary régime. Thus ministers could remain in power only as long\r\nas they had the confidence of the Assembly. Decrees and ordinances of the\r\npresident were operative only when signed by a minister. The ministers\r\nwere responsible to the National Assembly for the conduct of their\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe provisional constitution of February 10 became operative immediately\r\nupon its adoption.[8] Two series of acts thereupon naturally followed.\r\n\r\nFirst the authorities who received their powers from the Revolution\r\nresigned these into the hands of the National Assembly. On February 10,\r\nCommissar of the People Scheidemann declared before the Assembly, “Since\r\nthe National Assembly is in session and the Provisional Constitution\r\nis adopted the historic mission which had been entrusted to us as a\r\nprovisional government is terminated. We return the powers which we have\r\nreceived from the Revolution into the hands of the National Assembly.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, February 11, there was read before the Assembly a letter\r\nfrom the Central Committee of the German Socialist Republic in which\r\nthree propositions should be noted. First, the Central Committee returned\r\nto the German National Assembly the powers which it had held by virtue\r\nof the authority given it by the Congress of Workers and Soldiers\r\nCouncils. Secondly, it demanded the incorporation of the Workers and\r\nSoldiers Councils in the future Constitution of the Empire to strengthen\r\nthe representation of the workers and to defend the interests of the\r\nproducers as well as to assure a popular organization of the Empire’s\r\narmed forces. Thirdly, it opposed with utmost energy the dangerous\r\nreappearance of the rights of sovereignty of individual states when these\r\nrights went beyond the domain of questions affecting the autonomy and the\r\nculture of the states.\r\n\r\nThere remained the task of organizing the new government in conformity\r\nwith the provisions of the law. On February 11, Commissar of the People\r\nEbert was elected President of the Reich by a vote of 277 out of a\r\npossible 328. He resigned as deputy and named a ministry headed by\r\nScheidemann. As David, who had been elected President of the Assembly,\r\nwas also appointed member of the Ministry without portfolio he was\r\nreplaced as President of the National Assembly by Fehrenbach on February\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY LAWS.\r\n\r\nThe elaboration of the permanent Constitution lasted nearly seven\r\nmonths. There were preliminary drafts, drafts and supplementary drafts;\r\nwhich were studied in conference with the states, in sub-committees and\r\ncommittees, and in full session of the National Assembly with countless\r\nchanges and modifications up to the last minute.\r\n\r\nThe man who was constantly in the breach throughout all this labour\r\nand who may be considered the principal author of the Constitution was\r\nProfessor Preuss.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution he belonged to the Progressive Party; after which\r\nhe joined the Democrats. Under-secretary of State for the Interior, on\r\nFebruary 15, 1918; Minister of the Interior in Scheidemann’s cabinet\r\nof February, 1919; representative of the government at the National\r\nAssembly to discuss the Constitution when, in June, 1919, he left office;\r\nit was on him from the beginning to end that the chief burden of these\r\ndiscussions rested. Master of constitutional law he showed himself in\r\npolitics essentially a realist. He fought stubbornly for the ideas he\r\nput forward in his first draft--the necessity of unifying the Reich and\r\ndismembering Prussia, the need of creating confidence in democracy, the\r\nsuperiority of a parliamentary régime. He fought for these to the very\r\nend with vigour of argument and such fertility of resources that the\r\ngreater part of his ideas survived every attack. Certainly the definitive\r\ntext of the Constitution is quite different from his original project;\r\nPreuss did not underestimate the forces and influences with which he had\r\nto deal; nevertheless he won great support on his principal issues and he\r\nis really the chief artisan of the work of Weimar.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was adopted on July 31 by a vote of 262 for and 75\r\nagainst. Those who voted against it were the German Nationalists, the\r\nGerman People’s Party, The Independents, The Bavarian Peasant Union, and\r\nseveral members of the Bavarian People’s Party, among them Dr. Heim.\r\n\r\nIt was promulgated and published on August 11, 1919, and became operative\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded peace and adopted the Constitution the National\r\nAssembly, it would seem, should have dissolved. But it did not. It had\r\nthe authority to fix the duration of its mandate. The Assembly considered\r\nthat its work was not finished on August 11, 1919, two tasks still\r\nremaining to be accomplished; the first of these to draw up and pass the\r\nprincipal laws needed for the application of the constitution. The latter\r\nin a number of its provisions necessitated the passing of a series of\r\nspecial laws and ordinary laws regulating details which, in the course\r\nof the deliberations on the Constitution, the members could not find\r\ntime to enact or on which they had not been able to agree. Among such\r\nwere laws regulating the election of the Reichstag and of the President\r\nof the Reich, laws on initiative and referendum, on the state of siege,\r\nthe army, Workers Councils, and Economic Councils, laws regulating the\r\ntransfer of railroads and postal systems of the various states to the\r\ncontrol of the Reich, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly in addition considered itself bound to study and pass laws\r\nof a character not necessarily constitutional but urgently needed by the\r\nReich. In the front rank in importance were the laws designed to create\r\nthe financial resources of which the Reich had great need in order to\r\nmeet the enormous charges imposed upon it by the treaty of peace, the\r\nlosses of five years of war and the increased public expenditure. It\r\nwas also urgent to enact laws governing pensions and indemnities to the\r\nwounded, the mutilated, and the widows of the war, etc.\r\n\r\nBut from the moment the Constitution entered into force on August 11,\r\nGermany was under a new constitutional régime. It was no longer the\r\nrégime of the Provisional Constitution of February 10, 1919; that\r\nConstitution was abolished by the definitive one. Nor had it as yet\r\nentered on the complete régime of the definitive Constitution; for that\r\nprovided for a Reichstag, and no one would dream of calling a Reichstag\r\nto sit at the same time as the National Assembly. It was a transitional\r\nrégime; from August 12, 1919, to June 6, 1920, the Constitution of August\r\n11 was in force but the National Assembly performed the function of\r\nthe Reichstag, and the President of the Reich, elected by the National\r\nAssembly, remained in office until the people should elect his successor\r\n(Article 180 of the Constitution).\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this decision on August 21, 1919, President of the\r\nReich, Ebert, took the oath of allegiance to the new Constitution before\r\nthe National Assembly in the course of its last session at Weimar.\r\n\r\nFrom September 30 on, the Assembly sat in Berlin in the palace of\r\nthe Reichstag, where it discussed and passed important financial\r\nlegislation, which included “a law on the income tax”; another “on a\r\nconsumption tax on liquors”; and still others dealing with “factory\r\ncouncils and with the relief of public distress throughout the Reich.”\r\n\r\nIn the early part of March, 1920, the parties of the Right, who hoped\r\nby means of new elections to obtain considerable increase in strength,\r\nsubmitted a proposal in which the Reich was asked to make known at once\r\nwhat projects for laws it expected to submit to the Assembly before its\r\ndissolution; and demanding that the Assembly submit as soon as possible\r\nproposals regulating the elections to the Reichstag, the election of the\r\nPresident, on initiative and referendum; and in addition proposing that\r\nthe Assembly declare itself dissolved on May 1, 1920. This motion was\r\ndefeated on March 10 after the Minister of Interior, Koch, had indicated\r\nthe laws which still remained to be enacted. He insisted on the necessity\r\nof a profound study of the project of the law governing the election of\r\nthe Reichstag; and that the first Reichstag of the Republic should not\r\nbe elected according to the provisions of a temporary and little studied\r\nlaw. He declared that the National Assembly could not be dissolved nor\r\nthe elections held before the autumn of 1920.\r\n\r\nBut two days later came the _putch_ of Kapp and Lüttwitz. Berlin\r\nfell into the hands of a military faction who announced openly their\r\ndetermination to bring back the old régime. The regular government fled\r\nto Stuttgart, where it hastily convoked the National Assembly. A general\r\nstrike was declared everywhere. Defeated by this, Kapp and Lüttwitz fled\r\nand the regular government came back to Berlin. But the workers refused\r\nto resume work without receiving first the guarantees they considered\r\nnecessary against the return of the military dictatorship. Then followed\r\nalso troubles in the Ruhr and the occupation of German cities on the\r\nright bank of the Rhine by Franco-Belgian troops.\r\n\r\nAll these events were too important and upset too profoundly the\r\npolitical situation to make it feasible to go on without an immediate\r\nconsultation with the people of Germany. Therefore, after hastily\r\nenacting the last of the immediately urgent laws, particularly electoral\r\nprovisions, the Assembly dissolved at the end of May, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTOWARD A UNITARY STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first question with which the National Assembly found itself\r\nconfronted and which had to be decided was whether the German Reich was\r\nto remain a federated state or whether it was to become a unitary state;\r\nor, supposing that an intermediate solution were obtainable, to what\r\nextent it could partake of the characteristics of one or the other type\r\nof state.\r\n\r\nThe unitary state possesses an undivided and exclusive sovereignty.\r\nThere is unity of law, of power and of will with one Constitution, one\r\nadministration and one authority. The type of such a unitary state is\r\nFrance. To the unitary state is opposed the composite state in which\r\nco-exist several sovereignties, those of the member states as well as\r\nthat of the central government.\r\n\r\nFor, there are two principal types of federated states: the confederation\r\nof states, which has as its basis an international treaty and the\r\nexpression of whose will is only the sum total of the wishes of its\r\nmember states; each component state retains its sovereignty, but certain\r\nattributes of that sovereignty are exercised in common through the\r\nconfederate organs. The other type is the federal state, which has as its\r\nbasis a constitution and which possesses a sovereignty necessary for the\r\nperformance of its duties, the exercise of its rights and its independent\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nBut it goes without saying that these concepts are essentially relative.\r\nBetween the unitary state and the confederation of states lies a whole\r\nseries of state types, one merging by imperceptible nuances into the\r\nother, types which differ one from another according to the extent to\r\nwhich the member states are called upon to collaborate in the formation\r\nof the common will. Further, the federal state is never static, in the\r\nsense that its institutions never cease to change, tending either toward\r\nunitarism--that is to say, toward the tightening of the federating bonds\r\nor even toward their disappearance through the complete fusion of the\r\ncomponent states; or tending toward federalism, that is to say, toward a\r\nloosening of the bonds, or even their disappearance by the dissolution of\r\nthe composite state.\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly in every composite state at the same time\r\ntendencies of both kinds. Theoretically they may even act as balances\r\nto one another. But this equilibrium is never completely realized and\r\naccording as one of these tendencies gains over the other, the composite\r\nstate tends more or less rapidly toward unitarism or toward federalism.[9]\r\n\r\nBefore the war the German Empire was a federated state with unitary\r\ntendencies. Since the war these tendencies have strengthened. For, the\r\ndownfall of the Empire and its army, the economic catastrophe which\r\nfollowed the war and aggravated the revolution, the separatist tendencies\r\nwhich have shown themselves here and there on German soil, and the\r\nfinancial burdens which have weighed on Germany all have convinced its\r\nleaders that to save Germany and to build it up there was but one means\r\npossible--to concentrate all the powers in the hands of those at the\r\nhelm of the Empire, and as a consequence, to diminish to the greatest\r\npossible measure the powers of the member states (if not actually to\r\nsuppress them completely) in order to give all efforts available a single\r\ndirection and to utilize them to the maximum, avoiding at the same time\r\nall unproductive energy and all scattering of forces.\r\n\r\nBy what means did this evolution manifest itself? How far did the\r\nConstituent Assembly go toward unitarization of the Reich? Will the\r\nGerman Reich remain a federated state?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions we must successively examine: (a) whether the\r\nstates still exercise self-determination and particularly whether they\r\nremain masters of their territory; (b) whether the states retain the\r\nright to give themselves their individual constitutions and laws and\r\nto govern themselves; (c) and finally whether the states participate,\r\nas such, in the formation of the will of the Reich. This last problem\r\nwill be examined in studying the organization of the public powers,\r\nparticularly those of the Reichsrat. The present chapter will be devoted\r\nto the study of the first two considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL STATUS OF THE STATES\r\n\r\nTerritory is one of the essential elements of a state. In a confederated\r\nstate the central government cannot force on the member states changes\r\nor exchanges of territory, fusions or parceling of their respective\r\nholdings. Such was in principle the régime prevailing in the old German\r\nEmpire. The historic composition of the individual states as they were\r\nwhen their princes signed the federal pact in 1871 was guaranteed, and\r\nthe territories of individual states were protected by the Constitution\r\nin the geographic integrity they had when they entered the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Weimar on the other hand put forward the principle\r\n_of the mobility of frontiers_. But it was not until after the most\r\nviolent and passionate discussions that this was adopted, and not without\r\nmodifications that peculiarly limited its operation. For, what was\r\nforemost in the deliberations and constantly dominated them was neither\r\nmore nor less than the question of the dismemberment of Prussia. The\r\ncardinal consideration was this: legally the majority of the problems of\r\norganization that the Constitution had to solve would depend for their\r\nsolution according to whether Prussia would or would not retain its\r\nterritorial integrity. But the political problem was also grave. Prussia\r\nremaining as such, would it not exercise again its former hegemony over\r\nGermany with all the attendant dangers to the domestic and foreign\r\npolicies of the Reich, dangers of an obstinate reaction at home and of an\r\ninsatiable pan-Germanism abroad?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE PROBLEM OF THE DISMEMBERMENT OF PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1918, there was felt throughout Germany a very powerful\r\ncentrifugal movement. The masses of the people saw in the Reich nothing\r\nmore than an alliance of princes and Prussian domination. It was to\r\nthe princes and to Prussia that they attributed the inexpiable fault\r\nof having begun the war and lost it. During several weeks of limitless\r\ndespair, two cries were raised, “Down with the Princes!” and above that,\r\n“Separation from Prussia!” It must be added that behind these cries was\r\npartly the unavowed hope that by abandoning the Reich one could more or\r\nless escape the menacing consequences of defeat. The Reich seemed on the\r\npoint of dissolution.[10]\r\n\r\nBut some men at once realized that if Germany was to be saved the one\r\nefficacious remedy was to revive in the people the sentiment of national\r\nunity and to reconstruct the Reich on new bases. A unitary republic would\r\nhave to be created and the domination of Prussia overturned.\r\n\r\nThese two fundamental objectives were self-explanatory and mutually\r\ncompulsory. For, given the disproportion in power that existed between\r\nPrussia and the other states, the more one increased the power of the\r\nReich to the detriment of the states the more one strengthened the\r\ndomination of Prussia, for thereby Prussia was made all powerful within\r\nthe Reich. If, therefore, the centralizing character of the Constitution\r\nwas to be accentuated, the following dilemma would have to be confronted.\r\nEither Prussia as it was would have to be accepted by the Reich, in\r\nwhich case the German Republic would in reality become a unitary\r\nPrussian Republic in which non-Prussian parties would be subjected to\r\nthe will of Prussia. Or, if this state of affairs was to be avoided and\r\na unitary state with central will was desired, Prussia would have to be\r\nsuppressed, either by a partition of her own accord or one imposed upon\r\nit by the Reich.[11] It was this latter alternative that Under-Secretary\r\nof State Preuss chose when he was put in charge of the drafting of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe individual states, he pointed out, were the products of purely\r\ndynastic politics which almost everywhere ran counter to the natural\r\nrelations of populations and races, separating what should have been\r\nunited and uniting elements that had nothing in common. Only the republic\r\nhas the possibility--it is also its duty--to reunite what belonged\r\ntogether. The fundamental question of the internal organization of\r\nGermany is, can a centralized Prussian State be maintained within the\r\nfuture German Republic? This question Preuss, after philosophical,\r\nhistorical considerations, answered in the negative. He demanded the\r\nterritorial redistribution of the states on the basis of the right of\r\npopulations to self-determination, according to their needs and their\r\npolitical and economic inclinations, with the intervention, by the\r\nsanction and under the direction of the Reich. Preuss insisted throughout\r\non the fact that Prussia is not a nation, but that she constitutes an\r\nartificial formation, due to the political hazards of a reigning house,\r\npurchases, marriages, conquests, etc. The Prussian state does not form\r\nan organic whole and is bound together neither by economic nor cultural\r\nrelations. It is an incomplete German state, “an edifice of fortune.”\r\nEven admitting that it had been for a time indispensable, in that it\r\nconstituted to a certain measure an internal bond, it has now outlived\r\nits usefulness as a state. The national unity of Germany as a whole is\r\na vital question for the German people and therefore for the German\r\nRepublic. It is imperative that the diverse races who lived in forced\r\nunity in Prussia should be at once placed under the sovereignty of the\r\nReich instead of being “mediatized” by a state that interposes itself\r\nbetween them and the Reich. It is only by the suppression of Prussia\r\nthat these populations can secure that equality which is their right by\r\nthe side of the other German states. It is only by the dismemberment\r\nof Prussia that the small states of North and Central Germany can make\r\nthemselves communities able to survive. That an incompletely unified\r\nstate of forty million Germans, that is to say, Prussia, could co-exist\r\nwith a more complete unity of seventy million Germans, is contrary to\r\nnature and is a political contradiction. The German people, therefore,\r\nmust be free to erect within the Reich new German republics without\r\nregarding the actual boundaries of the existing German states, as far as\r\neconomic conditions and historical considerations permit the formation\r\nof new states. Newly created states will have to have at least two\r\nmillion inhabitants each. The fusion of several member states into a new\r\nstate can be effected by an interstate treaty drawn up by the states in\r\nquestion, and approved by their parliaments as well as the government of\r\nthe Reich. If the population of a territory wishes to separate itself\r\nfrom the state to which it belonged in order to unite with one or more\r\nother German Republics, or to form for itself an independent republic\r\nwithin the Reich, a plebiscite must be resorted to.\r\n\r\nThese proposals aroused most violent opposition. In the meetings of\r\nthe committees as well as in plenary sessions of the Assembly two\r\ndeclarations were constantly emphasized. On the one hand, matters could\r\nnot remain as they were, for the interior boundaries of the country were\r\ntoo entangled and there were states too small and powerless to discharge\r\nconveniently their obligations. On the other hand, it was impossible\r\nto conceive a radical transformation and to hope to see realized a\r\ncompletely new regrouping if this had to be done on purely rational\r\nprinciples. Revolution could perhaps effect this transformation, but the\r\nRepublic was not yet strong enough to undertake this task, particularly\r\nas it was so preoccupied with the problem of a constitution. Insistence\r\non the complete solution of this problem, even if it did not invite\r\ncomplete failure, would mean too much loss of time. A compromise had to\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nThe terms of such a compromise were extremely difficult to find. For no\r\nchange in the territories of the various states could be effected without\r\nencroaching on the territory of Prussia, which has “enclaves” or domains\r\nin most of the states whose transformation was contemplated. If even one\r\nwere to content oneself with the fusing of several small states--which\r\nit was unanimously agreed was highly desirable--it could be done only by\r\ntaking from Prussia such and such piece of its territory. No matter from\r\nwhat side, therefore, the problem was attacked one came to the question\r\nof the dismemberment of Prussia. And over this question came conflict.\r\n\r\nSome of the members followed the lines of the proposal submitted by\r\nPreuss on the partition of Prussia; but they went much further and\r\nindicated precisely what territory they found necessary to take away from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was above all the question of the Rhineland. Through Trimborn,\r\nspokesman of the Centre, deputies of Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle, the\r\ninhabitants of the Rhine country presented their claims. Prussia, product\r\nof a political dynasty, is an aggregation of different races, for there\r\nis no Prussian nation. The people who live on the banks of the Rhine feel\r\nthemselves handicapped in comparison with the other German races, since\r\nthey are not in direct contact with the Reich, and are represented in it\r\nonly through the medium of Prussia. It follows from this that the people\r\nof the Rhine cannot have free expression of their native tendencies nor\r\ndevelop their own culture. They suffer in every way by not having their\r\nown administration and by having to endure Prussian functionaries over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe objections which came from the Prussian side to the formation of\r\na Rhine state were not valid, insisted the partisans of the latter.\r\nThe separation of the Rhineland from Prussia need not entail in itself\r\na separation from the Reich. On the contrary, the Rhineland would be\r\nmore solidly and intimately welded to the Reich if they belonged to it\r\ndirectly instead of being only part of Prussia. Nor would they admit\r\nthe argument that the Rhineland should belong to Prussia to supplement\r\neconomically the relatively poor Eastern provinces of Prussia. “The old\r\ncry of the poor East and the rich West is to-day dead,” the Rhinelanders\r\ninsisted. War and revolution have done infinitely more damage to\r\nindustrial Rhine than to the rural Eastern provinces. Finally, while it\r\nis possible that for a certain period, undoubtedly short, there might\r\nbe disturbances in Germany caused by the creation of a new state, these\r\nwould be less harmful than leaving on the Rhine a situation that would\r\nremain a permanent source of trouble. In conclusion, the representatives\r\nof the Rhineland demanded the creation of a Republic of the West, which\r\nshould take in the provinces of the Rhine, a part of Westphalia and the\r\nterritories of Oldenburg and Bremen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the representatives of Hanover demanded justice\r\nagainst the violent annexation to which it had been subjected in 1866.\r\nThere was formed in the Assembly a “German-Hanoverian” group which\r\ndemanded “a free Hanover within a new Germany.” It involved the fusion of\r\nLower Saxony with Hanover and Brunswick.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the small states of Central Germany wanted to fuse into\r\na single state which would take in also part of the territory of Prussia\r\nand the region of Erfurt, and would form the state of Thuringia.\r\n\r\nTo these claims the representatives of Prussia, particularly the Prussian\r\nMinister of Justice, Heinze, and the German Nationalist, Düringer,\r\nreplied, that the separatists were rats who were deserting a sinking\r\nship; and they presented a vigorous defence of Prussia.\r\n\r\nFirstly, they insisted, Prussia is no longer what it was before the\r\nRevolution. Formerly it was a powerful state enjoying all the advantages\r\nof hegemony and all the privileges which came from the fact that the\r\nGerman Emperor was the King of Prussia. To-day, said they, Prussia, whose\r\nmilitary backbone is broken, finds itself economically and financially\r\nruined and all its ancient prerogatives taken away. Furthermore, its\r\nformer electoral system based on a class suffrage is gone and all the\r\nelements, including those of the Rhine, can make themselves equally felt\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nPrussia as it now exists should be maintained, they went on. Its\r\ndismemberment would hurt the Reich more than it would serve it. Only\r\npowerful states, in command of important financial resources, can\r\ndischarge the innumerable duties that to-day are incumbent on public\r\norganisms. Not only is Prussian culture necessary for the development of\r\nGerman culture, but the downfall of Prussia would involve the downfall\r\nof Germany; for Prussia is the cement that holds together the unity of\r\nthe Reich, and renders services proportional to its greatness. Then,\r\ntoo, what would be the result of a dismemberment of Prussia? Aside\r\nfrom the fact that the advocates of dismemberment are absolutely unable\r\nto indicate the number and extent of the states into which they would\r\ncarve Prussia, its parcelling out would involve a considerable loss in\r\npower and spirit, in time and in money. For each new state will want to\r\nhave new administrative apparatus complete in every respect, a separate\r\nconstitution, a separate parliament, a separate legislature, and so on.\r\nThese states by reason of their weakness will be unable to discharge the\r\nobligations that would fall upon them. Still further, nothing was more\r\nillogical than to create new states if one wants to realize some day or\r\nother the unity of the Reich; for, each of these states will constitute\r\nlater on just one more obstacle to such a unity.\r\n\r\nFinally, said the Prussians, Prussia, which has already given all and\r\nsacrificed all to the greatness of the Empire, is ready to renounce\r\nstill more, for the benefit of the Reich, what still remains of its\r\nindependence, provided, _that the other states do as much_.\r\n\r\nBut it was precisely this demand that made the proposition impossible of\r\nacceptance by the others. In “sacrificing to the Reich all that remained”\r\nof the ancient rights of Prussia, the latter in reality sacrificed\r\nnothing; on the contrary, it gained a great deal. For, mistress of the\r\nReich as it would be, it would secure thereby not only everything it\r\nbrought to it, but also all that the other states contributed to it. It\r\nwas thus, therefore, that Preuss always came back to the same dilemma:\r\neither a Germany under Prussian hegemony or a Prussia dissolved into the\r\nReich.\r\n\r\nFollowing the position which they took on this question, the members of\r\nthe Committee on the Constitution supported either the text adopted by\r\nthe conference of States or the project put forward by the government.\r\n\r\nIt became indispensable to know who in the last instance would decide on\r\nthe territorial distribution. The conference of states replied, that\r\nonly the states concerned should have the decision, otherwise there\r\nremains no such thing as states. The government insisted that it alone\r\nshould be the deciding power, for it was the natural arbiter between the\r\nstates, and only it controlled the situation sufficiently to resolve the\r\nproblem in accordance with the political and economic considerations that\r\nwere involved. Only the Reich can accomplish the necessary redistribution\r\naccording to a consistent plan. Such a redistribution would have to be\r\nregulated by a law. A third current of opinion in this question came\r\nparticularly from the champions of the creation of a Rhine republic, who\r\npressed for the submission of the question of territorial redistribution\r\nto popular referendum and insisted that the will of the population thus\r\nexpressed should be the ultimate guide for territorial redistribution.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary examination of the question the committee to which\r\nit had been submitted presented a project according to which territorial\r\nchanges would be regulated by a law, which, however, would have to be\r\ndemanded either by the people involved or by a predominant general\r\ninterest. It would be the Reich that would decide this in the last\r\ninstance. Against this first project of the committee, objections were\r\nraised on March 29 by the states of south Germany; and negotiations\r\nbegan between the government, the representatives of these states and\r\nthose of the majority parties. On May 29, a compromise was signed which,\r\nafter slight alterations on June 5 by the Committee on the Constitution,\r\nprovided that territorial changes must be accepted in principle by the\r\nstates involved, and approved by the Reich. If the states refused their\r\nconsent these changes could not be effected except by a law that took the\r\nform of a Constitutional provision; but this law could not be enacted\r\nunless the populations affected demanded it or unless the preponderant\r\ngeneral interest required it. This new version increased the rôle of\r\nthe states but also augmented the difficulty of procedure in any\r\ndismemberment whatsoever. It did not, however, exclude the hypothesis of\r\na dismemberment effected in opposition to the wishes of the interested\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe debate came back again and again to this version; and when the\r\nquestion reached the second reading before the National Assembly there\r\nwas presented an amendment drawn up by Löbe of the Social Democrats,\r\nTrimborn of the Centre, and Heile of the Democrats, which after very much\r\ndiscussion among the government and the representatives of the states\r\nmodified considerably the version of the Committee on the Constitution.\r\nOn the one hand, territorial modifications were facilitated in the sense\r\nthat new states could thereafter be created, even against the desires\r\nof the interested states, by a simple law; for they wanted to avoid,\r\nfor example, the situation in which Prussia or another state could\r\ncompletely prevent all territorial modification by rendering impossible\r\nthe necessary majority for the vote needed to enact a constitutional law.\r\nOn the other hand, the creation of such a new state was rendered more\r\ndifficult in the sense that it considerably complicated the conditions\r\naccording to which the populations affected could express their desires.\r\nBut most important of all--and that was the principal provision of the\r\namendment--it was specified that no territorial change could be effected\r\nagainst the wish of the states concerned before a period of two years\r\nafter the formal adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThus Prussia was guaranteed for at least two years against dismemberment.\r\n\r\nThis last provision was aimed at the Rhineland whose situation, as\r\nit was clearly indicated at the Assembly, was at the bottom of all\r\nthe discussion. It was declared that the Rhineland needed above all\r\ntranquillity in the particular circumstances in which it found itself;\r\nthat occupied by foreign troops it could decide its territorial needs\r\nonly with difficulty; and that, above all, the creation of a state on\r\nthe banks of the Rhine would be considered abroad as a preliminary\r\nto the complete independence of this state from the German Reich; and\r\nthat it was “necessary to maintain a unity of front against French\r\nimperialism.” Along this line of argument it was further insisted that\r\nthe dismemberment of Prussia has been the chief aim of the war waged\r\nby the enemies of Germany and the creation of a Rhenish Republic would\r\nbe exploited by them as an additional victory. This resulted in the\r\ndeputies from the Rhenish provinces declaring in the tribune of the\r\nAssembly their loyalty to the Reich and that whatever were their desires\r\nto see the Rhineland organized into a state, they would support the\r\nLöbe-Trimborn-Heile amendment including the postponement for two years of\r\ntheir justifiable claims.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was adopted by vote of 169 to 71, with 10 abstentions.\r\n\r\nThis version could not yet be considered as definitive, since when it\r\ncame up for the third reading before the Assembly a new version was\r\npresented in the form of a new amendment by Löbe, Trimborn and Heile,\r\nwhich modified the original version. The changes proposed dealt with\r\nthe method of calculating the majorities necessary in a popular vote to\r\ndetermine territorial changes. The Prussian Minister of the Interior\r\nHeine complained that the compromise previously adopted after such long\r\ndebate had been modified at the last moment in the course of conferences\r\nto which the representatives of the states concerned had not been\r\nsummoned. He preferred the original version; nevertheless he accepted\r\nthe new one since he was convinced that the Constitution would have\r\nto be revised in several of its parts. He added several interesting\r\ndeclarations. It would be dangerous, he said, to seek to realize unity\r\nwithin the Reich by creating new states, which would almost immediately\r\nafter have to abandon their newly won sovereignty and dissolve themselves\r\ninto the Reich as a whole. That would be a useless detour. Heine pledged\r\nhimself to facilitate the creation of the state of Thuringia and to give\r\nup to it a part of Prussian territory on the condition that prior to this\r\na treaty would be enacted between that state and Prussia regulating the\r\nadministrative and economic relations between the two. But he opposed\r\nwith vigor the proposition to create the state of Upper Silesia and\r\nabove all opposed the creation of a Rhenish Republic. This Republic, he\r\npointed out, would unite the territories of the left bank of the Rhine\r\noccupied by the enemy and the territories of the right bank administered\r\nby Prussia. Such a union far from safeguarding the German spirit on the\r\nleft bank would incur the risk of submitting the right bank to the same\r\ninfluences that prevailed on the other, and thus create a considerable\r\ndanger of infection to the right bank.\r\n\r\nFinally the Löbe-Trimborn-Heile amendment in its new version was adopted\r\nby the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Assembly passed a resolution which invited the\r\nGovernment to institute a central office where the different states\r\nwould be represented; one which would have as its function to prepare\r\nprogrammes for regrouping the territory in accordance with a general\r\nplan. In July, 1920, a commission was formed in the Reichsrat with the\r\nconsent of the states to devote itself to this task. The Minister of the\r\nInterior for the Reich, Koch, summed up its programme as “federation and\r\ndecentralization.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--CHANGES IN STATE TERRITORIES.\r\n\r\nThe territorial status of states is regulated by Article 18 of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThis, as we have said, is a compromise; its leading idea is to fortify\r\nand draw closer the bonds of unity within the Reich on the basis of a new\r\nredistribution of territory according to economic and social interests\r\nand taking into account the wishes of the population. It is true that\r\nthis has the value only of a programme without positive legislative\r\nforce; nevertheless it has its importance; it presents the principle\r\nof a progressive revision of the territories of the states, a revision\r\nwhose new unities would form organic divisions of the Reich such as would\r\nserve to a maximum degree the interest of the whole German people. The\r\nidea which should direct this territorial regrouping must be exclusively\r\nthe interest of the German nation in its ensemble. The territorial status\r\nof the states no longer has as formerly a value absolute in itself, but\r\nis thereafter subjected to the condition that it assures in the largest\r\nmeasure possible the highest well-being of the Reich as a whole. There is\r\nin this undoubtedly a victory for the unitary idea.\r\n\r\nFrontiers, therefore, will be “mobile” and their modification will have\r\nto serve the development of the general welfare. It will have to be\r\nthe Reich that will be called upon to preside over the question of new\r\nrepartition of territories, because it alone is the holder of sovereignty\r\nin Germany, and because it alone is in position to maintain an equal\r\nbalance between the varied and particular interests of the states.\r\nNo territorial change whatsoever, whether a fusion, a separation, or\r\nthe creation of a state, will be possible or operative no matter what\r\nconditions exist for its consummation, _without a law enacted by the\r\nReich_.\r\n\r\nIn addition--and this general rule must be followed every time that a\r\nchange is envisaged which does not constitute an exception expressly\r\nprovided for--such a law of the Reich must be enacted in the _form of a\r\nconstitutional law_.\r\n\r\nThis rule has three exceptions in which an ordinary law of the Reich\r\nsuffices, provided that a certain number of other conditions are realized.\r\n\r\n(1) An ordinary law is sufficient when the change, the separation or the\r\nunion of territories takes place _with the consent of the interested\r\nstates_. This consent manifests itself in the form of a declaration of\r\nthe governments of the states; for these governments by virtue of the\r\nconstitution enjoy the confidence of the people, since they are supposed\r\nto be both democratic and republican; in which case a plebiscite is\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n(2) But cases may present themselves in which populations wish to\r\nseparate from a state to which they belong, against the desires of the\r\ngovernment of the state. The Constitution provides that the wish of these\r\npopulations must be followed. According to Article 18 an ordinary law\r\nis sufficient to permit territorial changes or the creation of states\r\nif the interested states do not consent to it, but _if the wish of the\r\npopulation demands it and at the same time the preponderant interest of\r\nthe Reich requires it_. This provision is evidently directed against\r\nPrussia; for should in such a case a constitutional law be demanded\r\nPrussia would command a sufficient number of votes in the Assemblies to\r\nprevent changes it did not wish. The dismemberment of Prussia is thus\r\nrendered theoretically possible by this provision. But we know that this\r\nprovision is not applicable before August 12, 1921.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen how the wish of a population can manifest itself in\r\nthe operation of the latter provision.\r\n\r\nThe population may either be consulted by the government of the Reich,\r\nwhich can order an immediate plebiscite; or the population can take the\r\ninitiative and impose on the government of the Reich the obligation of\r\nordering the plebiscite. This initiative must be signed by a third of\r\nthe inhabitants of the territory whose separation is asked for. The\r\nplebiscite in such a case must be ordered by the government of the Reich.\r\n\r\nWhether the plebiscite is ordered by the government or results from\r\npopular initiative, it must, to be effective, satisfy the following\r\nconditions of majority. They must obtain (a) three-fifths of the total\r\nnumber of votes cast; (b) a majority of the votes of the inhabitants\r\nentitled to suffrage; (c) and finally when the question is one of\r\ndividing a territory which wishes to separate from its state, the\r\npopulation of the whole district or administrative division of which\r\nit was a part must be consulted; this in order to avoid break-ups due\r\nto parochial quarrels. In other words, the plebiscite must extend to\r\nthe whole district even if the part that wishes to separate forms only\r\na fraction of this district. Nevertheless Article 18 provides for\r\npractical purposes one exception to this third condition. This refers\r\nto exceptional districts, that is to say, sections of territory that\r\nhave no geographical kinship with the district to which they belong. In\r\nsuch a case a special law of the Reich could decide that the wish of the\r\npopulation of this special district is sufficient and that the entire\r\npopulation of the district to which it belongs need not be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe plebiscite having rendered an affirmative verdict the government of\r\nthe Reich must submit to the Reichstag the project of law necessary to\r\neffect the changes in territory desired by the population.\r\n\r\n(3) An ordinary law is sufficient _to modify the outer boundaries of the\r\nstate_, that is to say, the frontiers of the Reich itself, when these\r\nare necessitated by a treaty of peace. When these modifications are to\r\nbe effected otherwise than by the special case of a treaty of peace, the\r\nconsent of the state affected must be obtained (Article 78).\r\n\r\nSuch are the provisions of the Constitution relative to the territorial\r\nstatus of the states, but it must be recalled that certain of these\r\nprovisions--those which aim at territorial change based on the desires\r\nof the population but against the wishes of their state government--do\r\nnot become operative until two years after the adoption of the\r\nconstitution. Thus up to August 12, 1921, no parcel of the territory of\r\nPrussia, Bavaria, Hesse, Oldenburg, occupied by foreign armies, could be\r\nconstitutionally taken away from their states without their wish. The\r\naim pursued by the constituent Assembly in adopting this provision was\r\nto combat separatist attempts of powers whose armies occupy German soil,\r\nand to avoid all appearances and possibilities of dismemberment until\r\nrevolutionary effervescence and political disorders shall have come to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE CREATION OF A STATE--THURINGIA.\r\n\r\nThe provisions which we have elucidated have already been put into\r\noperation. A new state has appeared in the Reich created by the fusion of\r\nseveral former states.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the revolution of November, 1918, a project was\r\nborn in central Germany to fuse several states there and to form of their\r\nterritories the state of “Thuringia.”\r\n\r\nFirst the two states of Reuss reunited. On December 21, 1918, they\r\norganized an administration in common and the fusion became operative on\r\nApril 4, 1919. This new state appeared thereafter as a sort of centre for\r\ncrystallization. The first state to join this movement was the Republic\r\nof Altenburg, with which Reuss had many interests in common.\r\n\r\nBut this development toward the federation of states of central Germany\r\nwas soon interrupted and seemed for a time even definitely arrested. The\r\nmen who were pushing the project of extending this movement conceived\r\nthe idea of the creation of a “Great Thuringia,” which would comprise\r\nimportant parts of Prussian territory and which would have as the\r\neconomic and political centre and as capital the Prussian city of Erfurt.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this plan aroused violent opposition on the part of\r\nthe government of Prussia, such as it manifested whenever the question\r\ncame up of the separation from it of any part of its territory. It\r\nencountered also the strong objection on the part of the authorities\r\nand the population of Erfurt who preferred the present advantage of\r\nbelonging to the most powerful German state rather than the possible\r\nbenefit of becoming an important element in a new state. The project of\r\na “Great Thuringia” was abandoned and the effort continued as before to\r\nform a state which should comprise all the states of Thuringia without\r\nappropriating any Prussian territory.\r\n\r\nOf the eight republics of central Germany included in this plan of fusion\r\none, that of Coburg,[12] refused to join the movement. This republic,\r\nhaving on October 30 inaugurated a plebiscite to find out whether the\r\npopulation wished to belong to Bavaria or to the future “Thuringia,”\r\nobtained 3,460 votes for Thuringia and 16,102 votes for Bavaria. This\r\nreunion with Bavaria was then consummated, with the consent of Bavaria,\r\nby a law of the Reich of April 30, 1920.\r\n\r\nAs for seven other republics--Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Altenburg,\r\nReuss, Saxe-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and\r\nSaxe-Meiningen--they concluded a “treaty” by which they combined in a\r\n“community” to prepare their complete fusion.\r\n\r\nTo this effect the treaty provided two organs:\r\n\r\n(_a_) A popular Council, the legislative organ of the “Community,”\r\ncomposed of representatives of each of the seven Diets;\r\n\r\n(_b_) A Council of States, the executive organ, consisting of\r\nrepresentatives of each of the seven governments.\r\n\r\nThese organs had as their mission to study and take all preliminary\r\nmeasures necessary for the fusion. To permit the accomplishment of\r\nthis mission the states transferred to them all their legislative and\r\nadministrative powers necessary. The laws voted by the popular Council\r\nwere therefore compulsory in the territory of all the seven states. They\r\nwere particularly operative over the governments and the administrative\r\nauthorities of these states.[13]\r\n\r\nThe common organs were in addition instructed to prepare the Constitution\r\nof their future state.\r\n\r\nWhen all these necessary preliminary provisions had been taken the\r\nReich declared the fusion in being. All the interested states being in\r\nagreement with this step an ordinary law sufficed; and it carries the\r\ndate of April 30, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF POWER BETWEEN THE REICH AND THE STATES\r\n\r\nThe unitary character of the Constitution appeared not only in the fact\r\nthat it recognized in principle the right of the Reich to regulate\r\nthe territorial status of the states. It appeared also in the clauses\r\nrelating to the division of authority between the Reich and the States,\r\nprovisions that took from the latter and gave to the Reich a considerable\r\nquantity of powers of a constitutional character as well as legislative\r\nand administrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATES.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the German Empire of 1871 recognized the right of\r\nthe member states to choose whatever constitutions they desired.[14] The\r\nEmpire never concerned itself with the form of government chosen by any\r\nof its states nor with the different provisions they inserted in their\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nGermany was thereby the only federated state which thus left,\r\ntheoretically at least, such a latitude to its member states. The\r\nUnited States and Switzerland, for instance, impose certain fundamental\r\nprovisions on the constitutions of their component states, relating to\r\nthe form of their State.\r\n\r\nThis latitude could not exist in the new Germany for the Reich, having\r\nadopted a democratic and republican constitution, could not, without\r\ncondemning the very principles on which it had been built, agree that\r\nsuch and such of the member states should remain monarchical. Proscribed\r\nin the Reich, monarchy would also have to be barred in the states. Also\r\nthe co-existence of both monarchies and republics within the Reich\r\nwould have something so inconsistent within itself that it would run\r\nparticularly counter to the centralizing tendency which was being so\r\neagerly promoted.\r\n\r\nArticle 17 therefore indicates to the states the bases on which they\r\nmust erect their future constitutions, in order to insure a harmony of\r\nprinciples between the Constitution of the Reich and the constitutions\r\nof the states. These bases would have to be analogous to those serving\r\nas the foundation of the Constitution of the Reich. One can group these\r\nprinciples under three heads:\r\n\r\n1. THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE.--All power springs from the people; as a\r\nconsequence national representatives must be elected by popular vote;\r\nthat is to say, they must be elected by all the Germans, men and women,\r\nby universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage following the rules of\r\nproportional representation. The same applies for municipal councils.\r\nOn the other hand the states remain free to provide different modes of\r\nsuffrage in elections in wards, districts and provinces.\r\n\r\n2. THE REPUBLICAN FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT.--All monarchical restoration is\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\n3. PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT.--But this provision was only desired by the\r\nConstituent Assembly; it is not strictly imperative. Preuss formally\r\ndeclared in committee meeting that any constitution, for example such as\r\nthat existing in Switzerland, which provided for a council elected by\r\npopular vote, would be admissible; but there would be excluded a régime\r\nof despotism in which the government was completely independent of the\r\npopular Assembly. It mattered little otherwise whether the state adopted\r\nthe one-chamber system or that of two chambers.\r\n\r\nThese three principles were accepted without serious difficulty. A\r\ntwofold point must, however, be noted. First that all Germans could vote\r\nin all the states for the election of the popular Chamber, that is to\r\nsay, for example, a Bavarian could vote at the election of the Prussian\r\nDiet. This provision is one of the principles that suppressed almost\r\nentirely the nationalistic motive of the individual states; it is clearly\r\ncharacteristic of the unitary tendency of the constitution. In addition\r\nto this, Article 17 adds to the general conditions a special condition\r\nin the case of local elections: a year’s residence in the district is\r\nnecessary for the right to vote.\r\n\r\nIn the National Assembly the speakers for the parties of the Right\r\ninsisted at great length on the difference that exists between political\r\nelections and purely local elections. In the latter it was necessary\r\nabove all that the elector choose men known to be familiar with local\r\nneeds and competent to satisfy them. These propositions are undisputable,\r\nbut the conclusion which the German Nationalists drew from them was\r\nthat to be an elector in a district one must be a holder of property\r\nin it. These conclusions were rejected by the Assembly as contrary to\r\nthe democratic principle, and a year’s residence was the only condition\r\nfinally adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE LEGISLATIVE POWER OF THE REICH.\r\n\r\nThe states are limited not only in their right to adopt whatever\r\nconstitution they desire; they are also limited considerably in\r\nlegislative power by that of the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--FUNDAMENTAL LIMITS OF POWER.\r\n\r\nAlready the Constitution of 1871 had reserved to the Reich a certain\r\nnumber of matters on which only it had the right to legislate. It was\r\nthus that foreign affairs, citizenship, customs, indirect taxes,\r\nrailroads, post and telegraph, legislation, civil, penal and commercial,\r\nthe army, the navy, the police and regulation of the press, all were\r\nincluded in the legislative authority of the Reich. In the memorandum\r\nsubmitted by Preuss in his draft of the Constitution, he insisted on\r\nthe necessity of revising this division of authority. He submitted as a\r\nprinciple that all state functions belonging naturally to the national\r\ncollectivity as such should be concentrated in the hands of the Reich\r\nmore strongly, more exclusively and more clearly than in the preceding\r\nconstitution. On the other hand, the autonomy and free administration\r\nof the smaller collectivities, from the communes up, would find their\r\nconsummation and their most complete development in the republics, which\r\nshould be constituted in united groups according to the nature of their\r\npopulations and their economic structure.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this work two tendencies clashed: the necessity for\r\nthe development and strengthening of the unity of the Reich; and the\r\nnecessity, on the other hand, of assuring the states a sufficiently\r\nindividual existence. A compromise was effected; but more than ever\r\nbefore perhaps the centralizing tendency was accentuated; and it has gone\r\nas far as possible without completely suppressing the reason for the\r\nexistence of the states.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Reich is more or less extended according to\r\ncircumstances. It can be, to use the technical expressions employed in\r\nGermany, exclusive, concurrent, and normative.\r\n\r\n1. The competence of the Reich is _exclusive_, when _it alone has the\r\nright to legislate_, in the respect that the states cannot pass laws\r\non the matters touching this authority of the Reich, even if the Reich\r\nabstains from using that right. These matters are enumerated in Article\r\n6, which contains, as compared with the former constitution, important\r\ninnovations.\r\n\r\nThe relations with foreign nations are hereafter the exclusive province\r\nof the Reich. The states lose the active and passive rights of legation,\r\nand they cannot enter into relations with foreign states except through\r\nthe intermediacy of the Reich. However, Article 78 gives them the right\r\nto conclude treaties with foreign powers on matters which belong to their\r\nown proper legislative domains, policing of the frontier problems, for\r\nexample. But these treaties must secure in addition the consent of the\r\nReich.\r\n\r\nAnother novelty is the unification of the army. In place of the former\r\ncontingents there is hereafter an army of the Reich in the hands of\r\nwhich is concentrated all the means of defence of Germany. The army is\r\nhereafter from this point of view placed on the same basis as the navy.\r\n\r\nIn the same way there is an increase in the authority of the Reich over\r\nthe interior situation, the provisions according to which the Reich\r\nonly has the power to legislate on posts, telegraphs, and telephones.\r\nIt is true that the former constitution had put forward the principle\r\nthat the posts and telegraphs of the German Empire should be organized\r\nand administered in a uniformed manner; but this provision and\r\nprinciple was nullified by the fact that it was not applied in Bavaria\r\nand in Wurtemberg, these states having in virtue of special treaties\r\n“particular” rights. But these rights were annulled by the present\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nFinally it must be noted that Articles 89 and 97 of the Constitution\r\ngranted the Reich the right to administer the railroads and the waterways\r\nthat served the general commerce. This right the Reich made use of in\r\nappropriating in April, 1920, the railroads belonging to the various\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n2. The second group of subjects entering the province of the Reich’s\r\nauthority consisted of matters on which the Constitution gave to the\r\nReich the right to legislate _by priority_, without thereby excluding\r\nthe legislative authorities of the various states, so that there could\r\nexist _concurrent legislation_ in the Reich and in the States, the states\r\nretaining the right to legislate as long as the Reich does not use its\r\nown right to legislate on these matters.\r\n\r\nThis group is defined in the Constitution by Articles 7, 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nArticle 7 sums up briefly, as did Article 4 of the old Constitution,\r\nthe province of concurrent legislation, but adds considerably to the\r\nenumeration strengthening here the unity of the Reich and adding to the\r\nsubjects which enter into the concurrent legislative competence of the\r\nReich all such important matters as assistance and care to be given\r\nto mothers, infants, children and youths; also questions relating to\r\nprofessional representation, to the socialization of natural wealth,\r\nto economic enterprises as well as the organization of collective\r\nenterprises. To this, strengthening still further the competence of the\r\nReich, Article 12, Section 2, adds that the government of the Reich has\r\nthe right to veto laws passed by the states dealing with socialization,\r\nif these laws touch the well-being of the whole population of the Reich.\r\n\r\nArticle 8 introduces in the Constitution, in spite of the violent\r\nopposition of the states, the principle of financial sovereignty of the\r\nReich and fiscal centralization therein. This article gives to the Reich\r\nthe right to take possession of all sources of revenue, stipulating,\r\nhowever, that it must leave to the states resources sufficient for their\r\nexistence. This provision constitutes an important advance along the road\r\nto the unity of the Reich and strengthens considerably the financial\r\ncompetence of the Reich compared to its former situation.\r\n\r\nArticle 9 also deals with the concurrent authority of the Reich in\r\nmatters concerning the public weal and the protection of order and\r\npublic security; but under this head there is the limitation, “to the\r\nextent that it shall become necessary to pass uniform legislation.”\r\nThis limitation, however, is of no particular importance, for as with\r\nthe matters dealt with in Article 7 the Reich does not make use of its\r\nright of legislation except as it feels the need for it. The restriction\r\nprovided by Article 9 is explained by the fact that the authority of the\r\nReich in these matters naturally met resistance on the part of the states\r\nand that a compromise had to be effected; they came to the agreement that\r\nthe Reich would not take up these questions in advance and in the first\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n3. Besides “exclusive” and “concurrent” legislation there is also\r\n“normative” legislation. This is provided by Articles 10 and 11 and\r\nconsists in the right of the Reich to “_lay down principles simply\r\nleaving the details to be enacted and carried out by the legislators of\r\nthe state_.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 10 in this kind of legislation are included matters\r\nof vital importance from the points of view of culture and of social\r\nconsiderations. Already in its second part the Constitution enacts a\r\ncertain number of principles to which both the legislators of the Reich\r\nand of the states are subjected.\r\n\r\nArticle 11 deals with the “normative” competence of the Reich over\r\nfinancial legislation of the states. It was necessary that the Reich\r\nlegislate on this question for otherwise there was the fear that the\r\nstates, in attending to their own financial needs, would drain sources of\r\nrevenue needed by the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--AUTHORITY OF NATIONAL OVER STATE LAWS.\r\n\r\nHowever precise and rigorous may be the division of the authority between\r\nthe Reich and the states, conflicts may nevertheless arise between the\r\ntwo. In such cases it was natural that the Reich should claim for its\r\nlaws, “the authority of Empire surpasses the authority of states.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES OF THE REICH.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution the Reich did not have in principle an\r\nadministration proper to it; the execution of the laws of the Empire were\r\nas a general rule assured by the functionaries of the member-states under\r\nthe control of the Reich. The new Constitution continued, it is true, the\r\nsame principle but it provided exceptions of the first importance. Three\r\nhypotheses must be noted here:\r\n\r\n1. Certain powers belong exclusively to the Reich. They are those which\r\nwe have enumerated as contained in Article 6. The Reich has the exclusive\r\nright to legislate on these matters, but in addition it has also the\r\nsole right to execute these laws; that is to say, it creates and directs\r\nthe administrative services necessary to assure the application of the\r\nprovisions which it has the exclusive right to promulgate. Foreign\r\naffairs, the army, the navy, etc., are administered directly by the\r\nReich. But in addition in matters that belong concurrently both to the\r\nReich and to the State and which have been placed in the hands of the\r\nReich the latter has created a special administration which it directs\r\nitself, that of finances.\r\n\r\n2. In other cases in which the Reich has the right to legislate and\r\nuses it, _it yet leaves the care of the execution of these laws to\r\nthe functionaries of the State_. Although these public services are\r\ninstituted and organized according to the laws of the Reich the\r\nfunctioning is assured exclusively by the officials of the state. There\r\nwas formerly, and there still is to-day, the hypothesis of authority in\r\ncommon in matters of public security, assistance and the Reich.\r\n\r\n3. In a third series of cases, finally, the states have exclusive\r\ncompetence. _They may both legislate and administer._\r\n\r\nOf these three hypotheses the one most important from our present point\r\nof view is the first. The recognized right of the Reich to have public\r\nservices designed to apply its laws and acts, permits it to organize\r\npublic administrations and to have functionaries subordinate directly\r\nto the Reich throughout the whole German territory. The unity of the\r\nReich is greatly strengthened by the fact that the principal public\r\nservices--the army, finances, diplomatic corps, postal telegraphs,\r\nrailroads--are hereafter completely concentrated in its hands.\r\n\r\nIn addition when the Reich fails to organize its own administration or\r\nwhen it has left to the states the task of legislating on subjects that\r\nare contained in the legislative competence of the Reich, the latter is\r\nfar from being weakened in its power therein. For it possesses in such\r\ncases the _Right of Control_ over the administrative authorities of these\r\nstates, and this right was notably strengthened by the Constitution of\r\n1919 as compared to its former power.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of Article 15, paragraph 2, control by the Reich\r\nmay be exercised by the government of the Reich in matters on which the\r\nlatter has the right to legislate. That means that control on the part\r\nof the Reich extends not only to the domains which have been already\r\nassigned to it by the legislation of the Reich, but also to matters in\r\nwhich it has the right to legislate even though it has not yet made use\r\nof such right.\r\n\r\nThe means by which these rights of control are exercised are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(a) General instructions addressed to the authorities of the states\r\nfor the execution of the laws of the Reich. These instructions of the\r\ngovernment of the Reich are compulsory on the different authorities of\r\nthe states. But instructions to subordinate authorities of these states\r\nmust not be given in particular applications of these laws, for otherwise\r\nthese authorities might receive contradictory orders from different\r\nsources; and in that way the governments of the state might lose all\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n(b) The control of the Reich is exercised in addition by sending to the\r\ngovernments of the states commissioners charged with the supervising of\r\nthe execution of the laws of the Reich. Such commissioners may even be\r\nsent, with the consent of the governments of the states, to subordinate\r\nauthorities. In the latter case it must be admitted even that the Reich\r\nhas the right to demand that the files of the state authorities be opened\r\nto it and with the consent of the governments of the states the Reich may\r\nexamine witnesses, take testimony and make surveys within the provinces\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\n(c) Finally the Reich may demand that lapses observed in the execution of\r\nits laws be corrected.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble of all these measures constitutes a strengthening of the\r\nright of control by the Reich as compared to the former régime. On the\r\none hand, the recognized right of the Reich to send commissioners to\r\nsubordinate authorities with, it is true, the consent of the governments\r\nof the states, is new. Formerly such imperial commissioners were received\r\nonly by the governments of the states themselves, instead of allowing\r\nimmediate access to subordinates as to-day. In addition and above all\r\nwhen difficulties arise especially from the insufficiency of the measures\r\ntaken by the authorities of the states, the power to settle these\r\ndifficulties no longer belongs as formerly to a college constituted by\r\nthe representatives of states, such as was the Bundesrat; but is now the\r\nfunction of the independent organs of the Reich, such as the government\r\nof the Reich or the High Court of Justice of the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--JUSTICE AND THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nThe centralizing influence of the Constituent Assembly is manifested,\r\nfinally, in the provisions which it adopted relating to the organization\r\nof justice. We know that in Germany justice, particularly such as is\r\nregulated by the laws on the organization of justice, the Code of Civil\r\nProcedure, the Code of Criminal Procedure, is administered by the\r\ntribunals of the states. The Reich had only one judicial organism, the\r\n_Reichsgericht_, whose powers are in principle similar to those of the\r\n_Cour de Cassation_ (the highest court of appeal in France). The new\r\nConstitution has changed nothing in this system. A proposal submitted\r\nin committee for the purpose of giving the Reich full control over the\r\nadministration of justice and making all judges functionaries of the\r\nReich, was defeated. Now as before the sole authority of the Reich in\r\nthis domain lies in the _Reichsgericht_.\r\n\r\nBut the Constitution has introduced a new judicial organism whose\r\nauthority extends over all important cases of a national scope, and\r\nconstitutes thereby a powerful element in centralization: that is the\r\nHigh Court of Justice. The task of organizing this Court is left by the\r\nConstitution to a special law. Until this law enters into effect the\r\npowers of this Court are entrusted to a senate of seven members, of which\r\nfour are nominated by the Reichstag and two by the Reichsgericht.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the High Court of Justice is regulated by the\r\nConstitution. It is this Court that passes on the difficulties that may\r\narise between states in the cases of division of patrimony where changes\r\nor separations of territories are involved. It is this Court also that\r\ndecides constitutional difficulties within a state when there is no\r\ncompetent tribunal within the state to deal with such a question. It\r\nis this Court that adjudicates disputes as to public rights that arise\r\nbetween different states or between a state and the Reich, when there is\r\nno other tribunal of the Reich that has jurisdiction over such a dispute.\r\nThis Court in addition presides over actions instituted by the Reichstag\r\nagainst the President, the Chancellor and the Ministers of the Reich for\r\nculpable violation of the Constitution or the laws of the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\nTHE JURIDICAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF THE REICH\r\n\r\nHaving described the provisions which regulate the distribution of\r\nauthority and territory and mark the reciprocal relations of the Reich\r\nand the States we may now attempt to define the Reich and to give\r\nprecision to its relation to the States, politically and juridically.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--IS THE REICH A FEDERAL STATE?\r\n\r\nFormerly when one spoke of the German Constitution the question was, “Is\r\nthe German Empire a federal state or a confederation of states?” To-day\r\nwhen speaking of the Constitution of Weimar the question is asked, “Is\r\nthe Reich a federal state or a single state?”\r\n\r\nNearly all the German jurists have attempted to answer this question and\r\nare almost equally divided in the answer. Some of them observe that the\r\nstates have no longer the power to fix the form of their governments\r\nand that they can no longer change the organic provisions of their\r\nConstitutions; that the Reich can prescribe changes in territory against\r\ntheir will and even order new formations of the country. The Reich is in\r\ncontrol of sovereignty and of the life and death of German states. It may\r\nagainst their will deprive them of their sovereignty. The new financial\r\nconstitution of the Reich, which entered into operation on October 1,\r\n1919, has taken away finally whatever had remained of their state rights,\r\nand all financial powers of the states have passed into the hands of\r\nthe Reich. The states are no longer independent states, they are only\r\nautonomous administrative bodies within the Reich. The Reich has become a\r\nsingle decentralized state.[15]\r\n\r\nThe other jurists emphasize the characteristics of the States which bring\r\nthem nearer in nature to states properly so called. The Constitution has\r\nrecognised that if sovereignty in the Reich emanates from all the people,\r\nsovereignty in the states also emanates directly from the people of those\r\nstates. From this it follows as a logical consequence that this power is\r\nexercised within the states, in the matters within their jurisdiction\r\nand through the organs of the states on the basis of their Constitution.\r\nThe Constitution has admitted that the states have their own proper\r\nterritory since the territory of the Reich is composed of the territories\r\nof the state. The latter have also their own individual legislative and\r\nadministrative organizations. It need only be added that if the Reich\r\ndisappeared the states could still subsist and continue to live according\r\nto their Constitutions, which proves that their sovereignty belongs\r\nto them and is not surrendered to the Reich. Finally, and this is the\r\nessential argument, in the Reichstag the states are represented as such\r\nand as such they participate in the formation of the will of the Reich.\r\nThis makes it, therefore, a federated state.[16]\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly did not want to take a position on this question\r\nand of its own accord adopted an entirely colourless declaration on it\r\nwhich left the doors open to all opinions. While the individual states\r\nwere called in the Constitution of 1871 “federated states,” they were\r\nthereafter called “republics” in the Preuss draft, “member-states” in the\r\ndraft submitted by the government and finally “länder” in the draft of\r\nthe constitutional commission and in the definitive text.\r\n\r\nActually, however, it is difficult to understand the interest in this\r\nquestion. What difference does it make whether the states are states or\r\nprovinces, so long as their powers and obligations are strictly defined\r\nby the Constitution? From their names alone we can deduce nothing\r\npractically informative about their nature. It is an academic question\r\nwhich has not progressed one step in three generations, which one studies\r\nbut does nothing about, for there is no reality in it.\r\n\r\nIn fact it is not possible to indicate a precise and material criterion\r\naccording to which one should differentiate between a state and an\r\nautonomous province which is not entitled to the name of state.\r\n\r\nThere are no clearly defined categories which one can label once for all\r\nand among which one can distribute the different state and provincial\r\ncollectivities.\r\n\r\nThere are only collectivities that are according to different\r\ncircumstances more or less broad in power. They differ one from another\r\nnot in quality or in nature but in the quantity, in the total powers\r\nwhich they may exercise. Here all one can ask is, whether the states, as\r\nthey are defined by the Constitution, resemble more the type generally\r\ncalled a state, or the type generally called autonomous province; and one\r\ncan say, if one wishes, that they are more the former than the latter.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--PRUSSIA AND THE REICH.\r\n\r\nThere is a second question of more immediate interest; and that is to\r\nknow how the political forces in the Reich are divided and in what\r\nrelation they find themselves one to another.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has increased the power of the central state already\r\ngreat under the old régime as compared with the individual states; the\r\nstates have lost considerably in their importance and this in the measure\r\nthat the Reich has gained. They have undoubtedly the theoretical right to\r\nlegislate; but the Reich legislates on all matters of any importance and\r\nthe legislative domain of the states is thereby reduced almost to nothing.\r\n\r\nThey have in principle judiciary and administrative services, but in\r\nall important respects such as relations with foreign states, military\r\nadministration, railroads, waterways, posts and telegraphs, their\r\nauthority has been taken away; the whole domain of financial legislation\r\nhas also passed to the Reich and they can no longer exist except through\r\nsubsidies from the Reich.\r\n\r\nThey have a territorial sovereignty; but a constitutional law, and in\r\ncertain cases even an ordinary law may modify that territory against\r\ntheir will.\r\n\r\nThey still have their citizens; but every German may exercise in every\r\nstate of the Reich the same rights and duties as those exercised by a\r\ncitizen of his own state.\r\n\r\nIn reality the states no longer count and the Reich is all powerful. Such\r\nis the situation in which the centralizing tendencies of the Constituent\r\nAssembly have culminated. But we come back to it in a problem that\r\npresents itself as follows: Has Prussia retained the hegemony which it\r\nexercised actually under the Empire and has it kept it to the extent\r\nthat any increase in the centralizing character of the republic will\r\nonly increase the power of Prussia in the Germany of to-day? Professor\r\nSchücking said one day to the National Assembly that all history of\r\nGermany past and future can be summed up with, “Up to 1867 Prussia was\r\nagainst the Reich; from 1867 to 1918 Prussia was above the Reich; the\r\nReich must hereafter be above Prussia.”[18] Will this consummation ever\r\nbe attained? To what extent has the Prussian hegemony been diminished\r\nsince November, 1918?\r\n\r\nThe Constitution embodies several important provisions affecting this\r\nquestion. Prussia has lost all the advantages it derived from the\r\nfact that the German Emperor was the King of Prussia; the privileges\r\nit enjoyed in the legislative initiative, in military matters and in\r\nfiscal affairs have disappeared; the Bundesrat, in which it played a\r\npreponderant rôle, and which was in itself the most powerful organ of\r\nthe Empire, is now reduced to a Reichsrat which can no longer prevent\r\nanything. There is no longer a Chancellor nominated by an Emperor-King\r\nand chief of all the _politique_ of the Empire and of the entire\r\nadministration; the powers of the Emperor have been transferred to the\r\nPresident of the Reich elected by all the people; Prussia may even\r\nagainst its will--though not for two years, it is true--be deprived of\r\nseveral sections of its territory and see them erected into new states or\r\nattached to still other states. All these diminutions of right have been\r\nconsented to by Prussia itself. Are they sufficient to suppress totally\r\nthe political domination which Prussia exercised over the German states,\r\nsmall and great? It does not seem so, for there still remains this\r\nparamount fact: _Prussia represents four-sevenths of the total population\r\nof the Reich_; that is to say, Prussia alone has the majority. The Reich\r\nbeing a democracy wherein the majority is sovereign Prussia is assured\r\nin important questions of the opportunity to impose its will always on\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is evidently to divide Prussia into several states. But the\r\nConstituent Assembly did not have the desire--or the force--to resort to\r\nthis; so that to-day Prussia is still above the Reich.\r\n\r\nPerhaps another remedy is possible; and it is on this that those who wish\r\nto place the Reich above Prussia base all their hope. That is to give to\r\nPrussian provinces a very broad autonomy in such a way that their powers\r\nbeing progressively increased, they will join little by little the states\r\nwhose powers are diminishing. There must be effected a decentralization\r\nas complete as possible, in such a way that these provinces while still\r\nremaining in the state of Prussia will have sufficient means to be able\r\nto live individual lives and to impress their special temperaments on the\r\ndifferent acts of their political life. It would be necessary--and it is\r\nthere that the problem is most difficult--to maintain in these provinces\r\nPrussian legislation and at the same time give them the right also to\r\nlegislate and assure them a sufficiently independent administration.\r\n\r\nThese are only projects and one cannot tell to what extent they are\r\nrealizable. We shall see, however, that the Constitution of Weimar has\r\ntimidly commenced an effort to realize them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the National Assembly has not completely realized the unitary state\r\nand has allowed traces of the federal régime to remain, it has fully\r\nadmitted the principle of national sovereignty and has applied it to a\r\ngreater extent than any other country in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\nThe democratic principle was adopted by the majority of the National\r\nAssembly without any difficulty. But in the public opinion there became\r\nmanifest certain tendencies which are either directly contrary to this\r\nprinciple or whose consistency with this principle is debatable; and\r\nsome of them have received and are still gaining active and influential\r\nadherence.\r\n\r\nIt is important therefore to define in reference to the principle of\r\nnational sovereignty the theories to which it finds itself subjected in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE POWER OF THE STATE IS DERIVED FROM THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is defined as government by the people; a democratic government\r\nis a government in which sovereignty resides in the people, or, to\r\nspeak more precisely, one in which the will of the majority determines\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nThat this principle was completely ignored in practice in Germany before\r\nthe Revolution we already know. According to the Constitution of 1871\r\nsovereignty belonged to the ensemble of confederated princes, Germany\r\nbeing governed by an association of monarchs under the all-powerful\r\ndirection of one of them, the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nSuch a system obviously could not survive the disappearance of the\r\nmonarchs themselves; and after the Revolution the democratic principle,\r\nto which Bismarck had given the semblance of expression in creating\r\na Reichstag elected by universal suffrage, became fully applied. One\r\nconsideration contributed above all to the establishment of government\r\nby the greatest number: The German Princes had governed and had\r\nconducted themselves as monarchs by divine right; under their régime\r\nno social class could develop to which a certain political power could\r\nbe given over, which the people would become accustomed to regard as\r\nauthoritative. There was in Germany no political nobility, no bourgeoisie\r\ninvested with political power. So that when sovereignty fell from the\r\nweakened hands of the monarchs it could be taken over only by the people.\r\n\r\nThe people are therefore sovereign. German jurists go on to say that the\r\npeople cease to be the object of sovereignty and become the subject of\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nBut we are here in a federal state, and the problem becomes more\r\ncomplicated because of the particular form of the state. For there are\r\nhere, in theory at least, two sovereignties: that of the Reich, and that\r\nof the State. Which is the primary sovereignty?\r\n\r\nIn committees the representatives of the states naturally supported the\r\nlatter of these alternatives. For them the former states at the moment\r\nof signing the confederate pact gave up to the federal state a certain\r\nnumber of their powers; but they have kept others. The Revolution has\r\nchanged nothing in this situation; it has thrown out the dynasties, but\r\nit has not at all changed the integrity and the rights of the individual\r\nstates. It is in these states therefore that sovereignty originally\r\nresides. The sovereignty of the Reich is only derived; although the\r\nReich is no longer an alliance of Princes, it is certainly an alliance of\r\nthe Republics that compose it.\r\n\r\nThis theory has not prevailed. It is true that one could not go so far\r\nas to admit that the sovereignty of the states is derived from that of\r\nthe Reich and is given to them by the latter; but it is equally true that\r\nit cannot be admitted that the sovereignty of the states is expressly\r\nlimited by the rights that the Reich attributes to itself. It has been\r\nadmitted, therefore, that the people is sovereign in the Reich, but\r\nthat it is equally and by the same title sovereign in the states in the\r\nspheres of action which are left to the states.\r\n\r\nSuch is the principle proclaimed by Article 1, paragraph 2, of the\r\nConstitution. That does not mean to say, however, that attempts and\r\nproposals were not made to make a breach in it or to draw from it\r\ndebatable deductions. A study of these attempts and proposals will enable\r\nus to understand more precisely the sense and import of this principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE COUNCILS SYSTEM, OR THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT.\r\n\r\nThe first projects formulated and presented against this principle, and\r\nto the realization of which the Independents and the Communists bent\r\nevery effort, may be characterized in a word: they aimed to give over\r\nall political and economic power to Workers Councils, to organize the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nThese proposals, such as developed particularly by Däumig, theoretician\r\nof the Independents, may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\nA parliamentary system--the proof is at hand--is powerless to bring about\r\nthe triumph of social democracy. The revolution throughout the world, if\r\nit is to win quickly--and it must win quickly, for the proletariat can\r\nno longer wait--cannot achieve its aims except by other methods. As in\r\nRussia in 1905 and in 1917, so in Germany the necessary change can be\r\nonly the product of Workers Councils. It is only within the Councils that\r\nthe union of the proletariat is possible. Only the Councils assure the\r\nco-operation of manual and of intellectual workers, which Russia had not\r\nbeen able as yet to realize but which should be and can be accomplished.\r\nThe system of Councils in its final aspect realizes the most perfect\r\nform of democracy, for it gives political and economic equality to all\r\nits citizens. While waiting its ultimate triumph, however, it may be\r\nnecessary to proclaim the dictatorship of the proletariat; but this\r\ndictatorship will not be any heavier than that which is borne by the\r\nproletariat itself. It will last if necessary till the complete fusion\r\nof social classes does away with the class struggle, till the advent of\r\nintegral socialism.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all power to the Councils! No division of influence, no\r\njuxtaposition of political assemblies and economic councils! The Councils\r\nare an indispensable instrument to substitute permanently a socialist\r\nfor a capitalist régime. That is to say, they should fulfil two series\r\nof functions: political and economic. Politically the Councils system\r\nunites in the same organism both parliament and administration, thus\r\nrendering possible that constant control of administration which the\r\nparliamentary régime is incapable of exercising, and maintaining a\r\npermanent supervision of the elected by the electors. Economically the\r\nCouncils watch over the execution of socialization measures; later they\r\nbecome the regulators of production and consumption.\r\n\r\nTo this duality of functions there corresponds a double organization.\r\nThe political system rests on Workers Councils properly so called\r\n(Arbeiterräte); the economic system rests on Factory Workers Councils\r\n(Betriebsräte).\r\n\r\nIn each commune, workers, employés, and peasants, organized as much\r\nas possible in vocational groups, elect worker councillors, one for\r\nevery 1,000 electors. These councillors have as their task, while\r\nawaiting the final organization of the system of Councils, the control\r\nof municipal administration. Their delegates constitute Local Councils\r\n(Kreisarbeiterräte); the delegates of the latter, in turn, make up\r\nDistrict Councils (Bezirksräte). In addition, so long as the German\r\nRepublic is still not united, there will sit in the capital of each state\r\na Central Council (Landeszentralrat). These different organizations are\r\nrespectively charged with the control of administration of each degree of\r\nthe hierarchy. At the summit of the edifice, finally, sits the Congress\r\nof Councils, which controls all political power, and whose meetings must\r\ntake place at least every three months. This congress elects a Central\r\nCouncil (Zentralrat) which appoints and controls the Commissars of the\r\nPeople. It is in a word a copy of the Russian system.\r\n\r\nParallel to this political organization, there is created in each\r\nfactory, shop, etc., a Factory Workers Council (Betriebsrat), elected\r\nby the workers and employés in the proportion of one delegate to 100\r\nelectors. Small factories and rural enterprises are grouped so as to\r\nform electoral units; the same with the professions. The Factory Workers\r\nCouncils are charged with the defence of the interests of the personnel,\r\nand with the control of the enterprises in which they are employed.\r\nThey co-operate in the application of measures for socialization. But\r\ntheir action, limited to the factory or the shop, cannot pretend to\r\nembrace all the problems of production. Germany is divided, therefore,\r\ninto a certain number of economic districts (Wirtschaftsbezirke). In\r\neach of these districts the Factory Workers Councils of each branch of\r\nindustry and of commerce designate a Council of Groups of this district\r\n(Bezirksgrupenrat). All the Councils of Groups in the same district\r\ndesignate delegates whose assembly constitutes the Economic Council of\r\nthat district (Bezirkswirtschaftsrat). In the same way the district\r\nCouncils of Groups of each branch of industry elect for the whole Reich\r\na Council of Groups of the Reich (Reichswirtschaftsrat), to which is\r\nentrusted the general supervision of economic life, and which, in accord\r\nwith the Central Council, determines during the transitional period the\r\nnecessary measures for the maintenance of production and the application\r\nof the laws for socialization. The Economic Councils of the districts and\r\nthe National Council may add to themselves, if they deem fit, experts,\r\neconomists, etc.\r\n\r\nThe whole system, so simple theoretically, rests on the elections of\r\nworkers as councillors in the Workers Councils and in the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils. The composition of the electoral body therefore takes on a\r\nparticular importance. The fundamental principle, in which Däumig and\r\nhis friends would tolerate no diminution, was that no employer as such\r\ncould take part in the system. _Only employés are eligible as electors._\r\nAn exception is made in favour of peasants “who do not permanently\r\nemploy farm hands.” A second axiom stipulates that those elected must\r\nremain under the constant control of the electors. The electoral body\r\nis therefore free to recall them whenever it seems desirable to it. In\r\nany event a worker councillor must not remain such for more than twelve\r\nmonths. He must stay a worker and not become a functionary.\r\n\r\nSuch is the organization that the Independents and the Communists\r\nproposed. In itself lies the proof that it is contrary to the democratic\r\nprinciple; for only part of the nation, manual and intellectual workers,\r\nemployés, the proletariat would have the right to direct public affairs.\r\nAnd this consideration, without counting all the other criticisms that\r\nmay be made against the system, such as at least the present incompetence\r\nof workers to govern, the necessary establishment of a reign of terror,\r\netc., has grouped against it not only the bourgeois parties but also\r\nall the Social Democrats, who depend for the triumph of the socialist\r\nidea on democratic and parliamentary means. “I do not wish to dwell long\r\non the study of the question of ‘the dictatorship of Workers Councils\r\nversus democracy,’” said one of the Social Democratic drafters of the\r\nConstitution. “It is sufficient for me to show that this dictatorship is\r\nin contradiction to democracy, that we must choose between dictatorship\r\nby a minority on the one hand, and democracy or government by the\r\nmajority on the other. The Committee on the Constitution has declared\r\nin favour of democracy, control by the great majority of the people.\r\nThe idea, therefore, of a dictatorship by the Councils is rejected.”\r\n(Sinzheimer in the session of July 21, 1919, of the Assembly; see\r\nHeilfron, _op. cit._, vol. vi, p. 4265.) From the side of the Democrats\r\ncame the criticism, “Those who demand all power for the Councils, who\r\nwant to place between the hands of the Councils all administration and\r\nall legislation are so indefinite as to the means of realizing their\r\ndemands, that it astonishes one … that a programme, so little developed,\r\ncan be put forward without the least explanation of how it is to be\r\nrealized.… We reject the granting of political right to the Councils.\r\nWe reject above all the dictatorship of a class that is at the base of\r\nthese Councils, emphatically and unconditionally.… We reject also the\r\nCouncils as organs of control. The idea of organizing the Councils as\r\na new assembly of control, side by side with each assembly already in\r\nexistence, seems to us incompatible with democracy.” (Erkelenz, session\r\nof the National Assembly, July 21, 1919. See Heilfron, _op. cit._, vol.\r\nvi, p. 4236-4328.)\r\n\r\nThe Councils System was, therefore, rejected by the National Assembly.\r\nIt must be observed, however, that it did not remain the mere formula of\r\nisolated theoreticians. The organizations of the Councils, in line with\r\nthe plan we have just pointed out, was put forward as the programme of\r\nall the Independents and the Communists, and, as we will see, these two\r\nparties succeeded in casting 5,337,712 votes in the elections of June 6,\r\n1920, sending 83 deputies to the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE CHAMBER OF LABOUR OR THE VOCATIONAL PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\nThere is another project which was rejected in the name of the\r\ndemocratic principle but whose partisans declared to be compatible with\r\nthis principle--one which in any event under different modalities has\r\ndetermined champions in almost all the parties. That is the plan for\r\nthe creation of a Chamber of Labour (Kammer der Arbeit) or Vocational\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe idea of granting to vocational interests a special representation\r\nis not new, but since the Revolution it has been studied in Germany by\r\na group of publicists and students of politics, who have delved perhaps\r\nmore profoundly than ever before into the project and have given it a new\r\nform by introducing new concepts into it.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the Chamber of Labour declare that at the present time,\r\nin contemporary states, the vital duty of a government is to organize\r\nthe economic life of the nation. This obligation has particular force\r\nin a country whose whole economy had been overturned and ruined by a\r\ndisastrous war and revolution, and which, unless it decides to enter upon\r\na new road, runs the risk of crashing under the burden of its foreign and\r\ndomestic debts.\r\n\r\nIn order to reconstruct Germany economically one cannot depend on a\r\npolitical parliament. A study of the history of the parliamentary\r\nsystem brings the conviction that if a parliament has proved to be an\r\nadequate organ of political legislation, it is nevertheless admittedly\r\nincapable of solving the economic and social problems it encounters.\r\nThe parliamentary system, that is to say, the system that consists of\r\nthe formation of a government with the parties of the majority, is much\r\nmore a product of classical liberalism than the creator of new social\r\nand economic forms. All the ideas current to-day and which constitute\r\nthe guiding principles of our political life, viz., democracy, national\r\nsovereignty, the forming of the popular will, division of powers, belong\r\nto an epoch in which the economic activity of the state was combatted\r\nwith passion. When it has created its political system liberalism remains\r\ncontent with forms that answer only to purely political exigences.\r\n\r\nBut to-day ideas on the rôle of the state are changing. The state in\r\nthe last few decades has little by little ceased to limit its activity\r\nto the rôle of “watcher of the night,” which liberalism assigned to it;\r\nand more and more the organs of the state have been forced to exercise\r\nan influence on public economy. Modern parliamentarism is insufficient\r\nto permit the state to fill its new duties. For the political chambers\r\nare divided in parties that group themselves according to changeable\r\nideological conceptions, based on the idea of “what should be,” the idea\r\nthat dominates the parties. But in taking a position in accordance with\r\nsuch articles of faith and political axioms, one does not acquire the\r\nnecessary technical knowledge to gauge and judge economic questions. In\r\nthis matter there is only one method of learning, that is to study the\r\nfacts of economic life. What follows from this is self-evident. We must,\r\nif not actually suppress the political parliament, at least put beside it\r\nspecial organs charged with fulfilling the economic duties of the state.\r\n(See August Müller, _Socialisierung oder Socialismus?_ Berlin, 1919.)\r\n\r\nAnd these organs can be nothing but Councils, Workers Councils, Councils\r\nof Producers.\r\n\r\nLet us not cry immediately, Bolshevism! It is true that the system\r\nof Workers Councils was born in Russia. First appearing under the\r\nRevolution of 1905, we see them reappear in 1917, but it was not the\r\nBolsheviks who brought them into being. The Soviets were born because in\r\npre-revolutionary Russia the law did not tolerate unions of workers. As\r\na consequence the only form that an organization could take to combat\r\nthe tyranny of the Czars was to nominate in every factory, shop, etc.,\r\nmen who could be trusted. In 1917, Russian Workers Councils formed the\r\nstrongest support of the democracy; they were the firmest adherents of\r\nthe government formed by Kerensky. But when the Bolsheviks seized power\r\nthey crushed the democratic Soviets in the sense that they would not\r\nany longer permit them to elect their members to office, and they, the\r\nBolsheviks, nominated men to represent these unions. In this fashion they\r\nerected their dictatorship, a dictatorship of a small group, with the\r\nslogan of, “All power to the Workers Councils!” But the advent of Workers\r\nCouncils has nothing in common with Bolshevism.[19]\r\n\r\nTo political representation one must join economic representation,\r\nconstituted essentially by the Councils. Workers Councils, somewhat\r\nlike those which Däumig would organize, are retained; to them should be\r\nassigned the representation of workers’ rights, which have hitherto been\r\ndefended by the unions.\r\n\r\nBut by their side should be created Councils of Production\r\n(Produktionsräte) charged, as their name indicates, with supervision of\r\nproduction. There will be organized in each locality and for each branch\r\nof economic activity a Council of Production. The enterprises of the\r\nlocality will each be represented by an equal number of delegates of the\r\nemployers and delegates of employés, for _the principle of parity between\r\nemployers and employés is absolute_. Above the Councils of Productions\r\nof the communes there will be superimposed for each branch Councils of\r\nGroups, Councils of the Province, etc., culminating in Central Council of\r\nProduction (Zentralproduktionsrat). There is thus for the whole territory\r\nof the Reich a Central Council of Metallurgical Production, a Central\r\nCouncil of Breweries, a Central Council of Chemical Production, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is in addition at each stage of the above structure a corresponding\r\neconomic council or Chamber of Labour, formed by a meeting of the\r\ndelegates of the Councils of Production of that stage.\r\n\r\nThe union of the delegates of the Councils of Production of each stage\r\nconstitutes a Chamber of Labour, that is to say, by the side of the\r\npolitical assembly of the commune, of the district, of the province,\r\nas well as by the side of the National Assembly, there is room for a\r\ncommunal Chamber of Labour, a Chamber of Labour of the district, a\r\nChamber of Labour of the Province, and a National Chamber of Labour,\r\nwhere all the economic interests of the commune, the district, the\r\nprovince, and of the Reich, are represented. By means of a Chamber of\r\nCommerce, the producers, as producers, participate in political life.\r\nIt is an economic parliament by the side of a political parliament.\r\nWhether in the commune, the province, or the Reich, no assembly elected\r\naccording to merely habitual democratic principles (Volkskammer) can\r\nof itself deliver verdicts or decisions of principle. An ordinance of\r\na communal assembly would have to be submitted to the approval of the\r\ncorresponding Chamber of Labour just as a law passed by the National\r\nAssembly would have to be ratified by the National Chamber of Labour, no\r\nmatter what its subject matter. The Chamber of Labour thus plays the rôle\r\nof a second chamber and its veto cannot be broken unless for three years\r\nin succession the popular chambers vote the same provisions in the same\r\nterms in regard to the matter in conflict. The Chamber of Labour and the\r\npopular chamber have equally the right to invoke a referendum. Finally,\r\nit belongs in principle to the Chamber of Labour to be the first to\r\nexamine all projects of an economic character; and it can, when it sees\r\nfit, take the initiative in proposing a law.\r\n\r\nThere are between this programme and that of the Independents profound\r\ndifferences. This programme gives the employers a place; the proletariat\r\nis not all-powerful; and if it gives to the organs representing the\r\nworkers part of the public power, it does not _thereby completely abandon\r\nthe employers_. Neither dictation by the proletariat, therefore, nor\r\ndictation by the Councils; but a political parliament and another\r\nchamber in which employers are allowed to keep the right to existence,\r\ncollaborating by the same title and to an equal measure with the workers\r\nin the direction of public affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the purely democratic point of view the most serious objections can\r\nbe made to this system and these were amply expressed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, said the democrats, these Chambers of Commerce cannot\r\nbe made up of men who have the sufficient knowledge and experience with\r\neconomic questions except by selecting them from among the employers,\r\nemployés and the workers in the different branches of any given industry.\r\nBut these men are personally most strongly interested in the problems\r\nthey are supposed to solve. The danger is great, therefore, that they\r\nwould decide not according to considerations of general interest\r\nbut to considerations of the special interests of their particular\r\nindustry or their own commerce. The decisions of a Council composed\r\nof representatives of different enterprises will be dictated by the\r\ndelegates of the most strongly represented enterprises; and if the\r\ninterests of all the vocations that have voice in the Councils can agree\r\non something at the expense of the interests not there represented, one\r\ncan be certain that this solution will be chosen. The proof of this is\r\nalready here; councils of producers grow always at the expense of the\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nThe champions of the Chamber of Labour, continue the democrats, are\r\nguilty of a fundamental error. They believe that in economic questions\r\nthere are only such problems as can be studied by the technicians,\r\nand that these can give such problems the only and obvious solutions.\r\nActually, however, even in purely economic questions, we ask always not\r\nwhat is, but what should be, what we want of them and what we can effect.\r\nA technical knowledge of circumstances, of causes, and consequences is\r\nnaturally necessary for a serious decision. But, even after the most\r\nscientific examination, one arrives almost always, and above all in\r\nimportant questions, at diverse conclusions, only because different aims\r\nhave been followed. _These conclusions are always dictated by political\r\nconceptions._ Technicians can decide the best system for cleaning the\r\nstreets; though even here it may be a political question to know if such\r\na system, which is the best but also the most costly, can or should be\r\nemployed. But when it comes to questions of Sunday rest, if woman labour\r\nshould be countenanced, if and how the land should be distributed, how\r\nthe relations between capital and labour should be organized in the great\r\nmodern enterprises, and perhaps above all, who should pay the taxes--all\r\nthese questions and an infinity of others raise up problems not of\r\nknowledge but of will. They are the questions in which the concern is not\r\nwith economy but with the situation of man, his rights, his liberty, and\r\nhis dignity within the economy. It is a question of the power of deciding\r\nfor the collectivity on a subject of collective interests. It is not for\r\nthe technician to decide, but for the man political.\r\n\r\nA last and decisive objection, conclude the democrats, against the\r\nsystem of a vocational parliament is that it replaces or annihilates\r\nthe democratic Chamber elected by the equal suffrage of all, that is\r\nto say, by democracy itself, and substitutes for it a professional\r\nchamber elected by a plural vote of privileged persons. Let the proposal\r\nbe remembered which the Prussian conservatives submitted two months\r\nbefore the Revolution of 1918 to effect, as they claimed, the equality\r\nof the right to suffrage. Each elector was to have one vote within his\r\nprofessional vocational group; but the representation contemplated by\r\nthis proposition was that the group of farmers were to have one seat\r\nfor every 12,295 electors, whereas their labourers would not get more\r\nthan one seat for every 110,530, a landed proprietor having electoral\r\npower ten times as strong as that of an agricultural labourer, six\r\ntimes as strong as that of a factory worker and one-and-a-half times\r\nas strong as that of a civil servant. It is true that the division of\r\nmandates in a Chamber of Labour would not result in as anti-democratic\r\nconsequences as these; but the project of this chamber is based on the\r\nessential principle of parity between employers and workers; the two are\r\nsupposed to be rigorously equal in numbers. That would be self-evident\r\nand understandable fully if the two groups had to settle questions in\r\nwhich their reciprocal interests were opposed, or if it were a question\r\npurely technical, where the number of delegates does not enter into\r\nconsideration. But it is absolutely impossible to admit that an assembly\r\nthus constituted should take decisions or vote resolutions; for, _a\r\nnumerically equal representation both of employers and employés would\r\ncorrespond obviously to a proportion of electors much greater for one\r\nclass than for the other_. In any industry, for example, an employer\r\nrepresents considerably fewer electors than a worker, and to give his\r\nvoice in the direction of public affairs an influence equal to that of a\r\nworker, would be, from the point of view of democracy, an absurdity. One\r\nthing or the other. Either the seats in the Vocational Parliament are\r\napportioned among the professions according to the number of electors in\r\neach, the representatives being elected in each vocation by the equal\r\nsuffrage of all without distinction between employer and employé--in\r\nwhich case there would result a duplication of the political parliament\r\nof which the least one can say is that there is no apparent utility\r\nin it. Or, the number of seats attributed to each profession must be\r\nmeasured by the economic or social importance of that profession, basing\r\nrepresentation in each profession on the principle of parity--in which\r\ncase there would result a parliament of the privileged, condemned by\r\nthe democratic ideal. An assembly thus composed could very well draw\r\nup reports and give advice on questions in which it possesses special\r\ncompetence. But it cannot be a parliament having rights equal to those\r\nof a political parliament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the objections put forward by democrats against the institution\r\nof a Chamber of Labour, and their force cannot be denied. But the\r\nchampions of an economic parliament reply with vigour.\r\n\r\nThese objections, say they, all take the point of view of _formal\r\ndemocracy_, that is to say, the point of view that considers only\r\nthe external forms of democracy, which contents itself with a purely\r\ntheoretical equality of right and equality between citizens corresponding\r\nnot at all to the facts of reality, which reduce this equality to\r\nnothing. To this form of democracy, to-day condemned by reality, there\r\nmust be opposed _real democracy_, in which one takes into account the\r\nspecial rôle which certain elements in the life of a nation play. Formal\r\ndemocracy has been fully realized by giving all men and women the right\r\nto vote. That is not enough. In a modern democracy public economy must be\r\ngiven its proper place, which is in the forefront. Producers, as such,\r\nmust play the preponderant rôle in the state, for the other members of\r\nthe community live only as parasites on their labour, and the state does\r\nnot exist except by the labor of the producers. No decision can be taken\r\nin a state if it is not accepted by the producers; the latter must be the\r\ntouchstone of all decisions.\r\n\r\nIt is not because of their technical competence that producers are\r\nproposed as the constituents of a special chamber. _It is because they\r\njudge things from the point of view of production_, which in a modern\r\ndemocracy should count more than any other. It is not a question of\r\nabolishing the political parliament, but of placing in juxtaposition to\r\nit an economic parliament through which the voice of the producers can be\r\nheard and by which the ideology of the politicians can be corrected by\r\nthe realism of men of affairs.\r\n\r\nNo division of competence between the two parliaments in such a way that\r\nonly social and economic questions shall be submitted to the Chamber\r\nof Labour can be admitted. This distinction between political affairs\r\nand economic affairs is a pure impossibility, for economy, politics\r\nand general culture form a unity which must be respected. It is on\r\nproduction, on “creation” that the existence of the people and all its\r\nmaterial and intellectual life rests. The two parliaments therefore\r\nshould have equal power to study these questions. They must also have\r\nequal rights. To give the economic chamber only the right to draw up\r\nreports and give advice, and even to oppose its veto only, would be\r\nentirely insufficient and would not correspond to the primary rôle which\r\nthe producers play in the life of a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous, continue the partisans of a Vocational Parliament, to\r\npresent arguments of which history constantly furnishes corroboration. In\r\nthe countries which practise the system of two chambers, one of the two\r\nchambers takes on always a greater importance than the other and plays\r\nthe preponderant rôle. It is the one which translates best the will of\r\nthe nation and best satisfies its needs. The other chamber may be able to\r\nresist for some time but in the end it is always forced to surrender. Up\r\nto now this preponderant rôle has been held by the lower houses, which\r\nbeing the product of universal suffrage, are always nearer the people,\r\nhave more of their confidence and reflect more exactly their aspirations.\r\nLet us create now by the side of the former lower chamber, a Chamber of\r\nLabour and let us leave to it the care of determining its own future.\r\nIt will either become a parliament of the privileged, making decisions\r\nthat will not correspond to the true needs of the nation; in which case\r\nit will be promptly annihilated by the more popular chamber. Or, on the\r\nother hand, it will show itself to be the more practical and the more\r\nuseful chamber to the people. In the inevitable conflicts that will arise\r\nbetween the two chambers, the economic chamber will have behind it the\r\nsupport of the people. In case of referendum it will be in favour of the\r\nChamber of Labour that the national sovereignty will decide; in which\r\ncase the traditional rôle of a lower house will pass into the hands of\r\na Chamber of Labour. The proponents of the Vocational Parliament are\r\nconvinced that it will be this last alternative that will be realized.\r\n\r\nThe German Constituent Assembly has followed their suggestion only to\r\na very slight measure; sufficiently perhaps to attempt the experiment\r\nrecommended by the advocates of the Vocational Parliament. The Assembly\r\nhas created an Economic Council, which will be judged by its work,\r\nalthough it is deprived, according to the Constitution, of any real\r\npolitical authority. It is sufficient for the moment to say that in\r\nprinciple it is the classic point of view of formal democracy that guides\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE UNIONS.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, several things occurred that seemed to support the\r\narguments of the partisans of a Chamber of Labour, when they claim that\r\nthe natural evolution of events must lead shortly to the advent of this\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nWe know that on March 13, 1920, counter-revolutionary troops led by the\r\nInfantry General von Lüttwitz seized Berlin, that the regular government\r\nabandoned the capital and that the Director-General of Agriculture, Kapp,\r\nwas proclaimed at the same time Chancellor of the Empire and Premier\r\nof Prussia. It was a _coup de main_ of officers and former reactionary\r\nfunctionaries, all of whose acts aimed at the re-establishment of the old\r\nrégime. On the 14th the unions of workers and clerks sent an ultimatum to\r\nthe new masters of Berlin demanding that they immediately withdraw. As\r\nthis ultimatum was not obeyed, a general strike was proclaimed on March\r\n15.\r\n\r\nThe counter-revolutionary government lasted four days; then, conquered by\r\nthe general strike, it disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut before giving the workers and employés the order to return to\r\nwork the chiefs of the unions wanted to obtain guarantees against the\r\nreturn of a new _coup d’état_. They called therefore on March 18 the\r\nrepresentatives of the parties of the majority to a conference, where\r\nthey presented to them the following new ultimatum. These representatives\r\nwere to accept in the name of their groups--which would therefore be\r\nbound--the claims which would be submitted to them; otherwise the general\r\nstrike would be continued in an aggravated form. The unions would not\r\nhesitate, if necessary, to prevent the return to Berlin of the Government\r\nand the National Assembly. They would even accept the responsibility of a\r\ncivil war. The representatives of the Democrats and of the Centre refused\r\nto pledge their parties. They promised only to do what they could to get\r\nthem to accept the claims of the unions.\r\n\r\nAs for the claims themselves, they were presented by the union leaders,\r\nand, after a long discussion and some modifications, they were accepted\r\nby the representatives of the political parties. These claims formed the\r\ncelebrated agreement known in Germany as the “Eight Points.” They gave\r\nparticularly to the unions the right to exercise a veritable veto over\r\nthe nomination of Ministers and the formation of the Ministry.[20]\r\n\r\nThis agreement concluded, the regular government came back to Berlin. But\r\nthen came its turn to negotiate with the trade unions and to attempt to\r\nsatisfy their new claims.[21] These new engagements secured, the union\r\nleaders ordered the end of the general strike and the resumption of work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in accordance with the “Eight Points” the cabinet of Bauer was\r\nformed. The crisis seemed ended on March 24 by the simple replacement\r\nof some ministers; but the unions raised difficulties over the new\r\ncomposition of the cabinet. They no longer wanted as Minister of Finance,\r\nKuno, director-general of the Hamburg-American Line; and demanded the\r\nresignations of two former ministers, Schlicke and Schiffer, whom\r\nthey accused of having treated with Kapp and Lüttwitz. After long\r\nnegotiations, the unions withdrew their opposition to the retention of\r\nSchlicke in the Ministry, but kept up their objection against Kuno\r\nand Schiffer. These two, therefore, gave up their attempt to enter or\r\nto remain in the ministry; but the Democrats took the part of Schiffer\r\nand the whole cabinet was compelled to resign. It was replaced with the\r\nconsent of the unions by the ministry organized by Hermann Müller.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile work far from being resumed, a new kind of civil war developed\r\nin the Ruhr. On the one hand armed workers, who had first organized\r\nto fight against Kapp and Lüttwitz, remained united and under arms\r\nfor fear that even after the conclusion of the _coup d’état_ of Kapp\r\nand Lüttwitz, there would remain under another mantle a disguised\r\nmilitary dictatorship. On the other hand, troops of the Reichswehr,\r\nsome of whom were accused by the workers of having the support of\r\nthe counter-revolutionary government and whose powers seemed to be\r\nunlimited, alarmed the labouring population. On March 21, there was held\r\nat Bielefeld a conference in which met members of the constitutional\r\ngovernment, delegates of the parties of the majority, and representatives\r\nof the Independents and of Labour organizations. An “armistice” was at\r\nfirst concluded, then an accord was achieved--known in Germany as the\r\n“Bielefeld Agreement”--in which to the “Eight Points” of Berlin was\r\nadded a “Ninth.” This would, at least it was so hoped, bring about the\r\ndissolution of the revolutionary organizations and the re-establishment\r\nof the regular administrative authorities.[22]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this agreement, however, fighting continued and on April 6\r\nthe unions, to whom the two socialist parties rallied, addressed another\r\nultimatum to the government. But it was precisely the moment at which\r\nFranco-Belgian troops occupied German cities on the right bank of the\r\nRhine and attention was thereafter diverted entirely to foreign politics.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts. The parties of the coalition have attempted to\r\njustify them and to prove that the imperative injunctions addressed by\r\nthe unions to a government which had to yield almost at every point did\r\nnot constitute a violation of the constitutional principle of national\r\nsovereignty. They pointed out that the first of the “Eight Points”\r\nrecognizes expressly the rights of national representation; that the\r\ndecisive influence accorded to the unions in matters of social and\r\neconomic legislation had to be exercised through the intermediacy of\r\nrepresentatives speaking for the unions in the ministries charged with\r\nthe preparation of law; and that the last word belonged, therefore,\r\nalways to the popular representation; that, although it is true that the\r\nunions protested against the nomination or the retention of Kuno and\r\nSchiffer in the ministry, yet in reality the cabinet of Hermann Müller\r\nhad been constituted according to the customary forms after an accord\r\nwith the parties of the majority.\r\n\r\nOther members of the governmental parties, on the contrary, pleaded\r\nextenuating circumstances. The Minister of Post and Telegraph, Giesbert,\r\nafter having participated in the “Bielefeld Agreement,” declared that\r\nhe did not want to examine whether this accord was contrary to or\r\nin conformity with the Constitution; for, “extraordinary epochs and\r\nextraordinary circumstances compel extraordinary measures. The conviction\r\nof those who participated in the conference (of Bielefeld) is that this\r\nagreement was the only possibility of avoiding chaos and devastation in\r\nthe territory of the Ruhr.”[23]\r\n\r\nBut the opposition parties unanimously insisted that the Government’s\r\nattitude was really contrary to the principle of national sovereignty.\r\nIn a democracy only the parliament elected by the whole people should\r\ndecide; only it could appoint the Government and it was responsible\r\nfor its decisions and nominations only to the people of the nation\r\nthemselves. As for vocational associations, their function is to defend\r\nonly the corporate interests of their members and they had no right to\r\nencroach on the political domain. In the events of March-April, 1920, the\r\nunions, leaving their vocational domain, revealed themselves the real\r\nmasters of Parliament and of the Cabinet, which had to submit to their\r\ninjunctions. The Independents congratulated themselves and proclaimed\r\nthat thereafter the Government was placed under a certain surveillance\r\nof the organized proletariat. The parties of the Right indignantly\r\nrefused to acknowledge a “side government” (Nebenregierung) over the\r\nregular government. “Henceforth,” said one of the opposition journals,\r\n“workingmen’s organizations can say that their orders are always carried\r\nout. It is true that the Democrats seem troubled by the state of affairs.\r\nBut what difference does that make? There are only three parties that\r\ngovern Germany--workingmen, employés, and civil servants.”[24]\r\n\r\nThese statements are undoubtedly exaggerations in two respects. One fact\r\nmeanwhile must be noted of importance here. While the government was\r\ndiscussing with the unions the formation of the ministry the newspapers\r\nprinted vehement protests from vocational associations and from other\r\nlabour unions and groups of clerks and civil servants, which demanded\r\nthat they, too, be allowed to participate in the negotiations. For they\r\ndid not understand why the labour unions should alone have the privilege\r\nof participating, for example, in the choice of Ministers--and it is\r\nimpossible from the democratic point of view to deny the force of their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWithout deducing from these facts any premature conclusions one may ask\r\nif the supporters of an Economic Parliament are not right in saying\r\nthat formal democracy no longer is able to meet the actual needs of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe events of the months, March-April, 1920, demonstrated, they say,\r\nthe complete incapacity of political powers to surmount any difficulty\r\nas soon as it becomes in the least serious. One of them wrote, “The\r\npolitical party is about to become a superfluous organization; it is\r\nbeing ousted or perhaps absorbed by the vocational association.”[25] A\r\nnew epoch demands new political forms. It is true that it is inadmissible\r\nfor a certain class of unions to arrogate to itself the right to impose\r\nits wishes on a government of the whole people. We must not think, on\r\nthe other hand, that in the future the unions would renounce the use of\r\nmeans which have hitherto proved to be powerful. There is only one remedy\r\nopen: to associate the other productive parties of the nation with the\r\npolitical work of the unions; to transform this present irregular and\r\nirresponsible political work, such as it is now, into a constitutional\r\ncollaboration with the government of the state. It is there that the\r\nevents of the month of March have demonstrated the necessity of changing\r\nthe present system. These events appear thereby one of the steps which\r\nlead from a formal democracy to a real democracy, from a purely political\r\nparliamentarism of the past to a politico-economic parliamentarism of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe democratic principle is one of the bases on which the Constitution\r\nof August 11 is constructed; more or less immediate applications of it\r\nare found in most of the institutions provided for by this Constitution.\r\nWe shall confine ourselves here to the study of the principal and most\r\ndirect of these applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nThe normal form of a government in a democracy is the republic. It is\r\nlogical that if the people is sovereign and if all power comes from the\r\npeople the chief of the state, like its other organs, should be elected\r\nby the people and hold his authority by virtue of it. It is true that\r\nthere may be and that there are democratic monarchies, such as, for\r\nexample, England. But this juxtaposition of monarchy and democracy, is,\r\nfrom the point of view of theory, difficult to justify and in practice\r\ncan be maintained only by reducing the effective power of the monarch\r\nto almost nothing. Democratic Germany therefore, must be republican. In\r\nreality the National Assembly arrived at a republic much less by logical\r\ncompulsion than through actual necessity; like the French Assembly of\r\n1875, it adopted the republican form because it was difficult for it,\r\nif not impossible, to do otherwise. It seems that the great modern\r\ndemocracies do not become republican until monarchy has been demonstrated\r\nas impossible. The republic is at the outset only a last resort; and this\r\nmust be realized and borne in mind.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution nothing in Germany was republican. Almost totally\r\ndeprived of political spirit and personal judgment the German people\r\nhad let themselves be convinced that it was only in the hands of the\r\nmonarchy, the army, and the bureaucracy that the affairs of the nation\r\nwere best and most safely conducted; and they naturally came to think\r\nthat the prosperity in Germany in economic and in technical matters,\r\nas well as its development in social matters, was undeniable proof of\r\nthe excellence of the monarchical system. No political party dreamed of\r\nincorporating in its program the establishment of a republic. Not even\r\nthe Social Democrats themselves really believed that the republican form\r\nwas a thing which the time had come to demand. They even held that the\r\neconomic and social interests of the working class could be more solidly\r\nassured by a powerful monarchy than by a republic and a democracy of\r\n“capitalists.”\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution the situation changed entirely. The sudden and\r\ncomplete bankruptcy of monarchy demonstrated overnight, with all the\r\nconvincing force of fact, that this monarchy, in spite of its apparent\r\nforce, was incapable of fulfilling the duties whose accomplishment alone\r\ncould justify its existence. The powerful monarchy had not had any clear\r\nand co-ordinated foreign policy; it had turned against Germany all the\r\nactive forces of the world; it had shown itself unable to utilize to its\r\nfull limit the military and economic capacity of the German people for\r\nwaging a desperate war to an acceptable conclusion; it had not been able\r\nto realize indispensable internal reforms. After November 9, one can say\r\nthat there were no more royalists in Germany; monarchy had become really\r\nimpossible and the Reich could not continue except as a republic.[26]\r\n\r\nLater the monarchist flag reappeared, rallying about it all the\r\ndeceptions and discontents. During the discussion of the draft of the\r\nConstitution the German Nationalists, among them the former Minister\r\nDelbrück, declared loudly that they preferred a constitutional,\r\nparliamentary monarchy to a republican government; but the other parties\r\ndid not follow them. In Article 1 of the Constitution it was decided that\r\n“The German Reich is a Republic”; and in Article 17 that “each state must\r\nhave a Republican Constitution.”\r\n\r\nAs a symbol of this change in the form of government the Constitution\r\nchanged the colours of the German flag; abandoning the black-white-red\r\nof the old régime and adopting the colours, black, red and gold because\r\nof their historical significance; because these colours had always\r\nsymbolized in the courts of the nineteenth century the tendency toward\r\npolitical liberty and towards German national unity.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Constitution does not give the new German state the name\r\n“Republic” but keeps the name of “Reich.” The Independents protested\r\nagainst that; they insisted on the fact that “Reich” will be always\r\ntranslated in French and in English as “Empire” and that this word\r\nwill always signify to foreign powers all that militarist domination\r\nimplies, the despotic subordination and the dangerous pan-Germanism that\r\ncharacterized the old Empire. But Preuss, followed by all the other\r\nparties, observed that abroad “Reich” could not be translated as “Empire”\r\nexcept in bad faith, for Article 1 specifies that Germany is a republic\r\nand that the republican character of the state appears clearly in even\r\nthe most casual reading of the text of the Constitution. For him the\r\ndistinctive trait of the Constitution was that it places to the forefront\r\nGerman unity. “After all, our historical development is precisely in the\r\nwords ‘Reich’ and ‘German Reich’ with which are associated the efforts\r\nof the German people towards unity and the re-establishment of national\r\nunity. I believe that to keep the word ‘Reich’ is entirely compatible\r\nwith the marked emphasis on republican character with which the whole of\r\nthe Constitution is impregnated.”[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE ELECTORAL LAW.\r\n\r\nDemocracy being the government of the state by the will of the majority,\r\nthe next problem, a difficult one, is how to indicate that will.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, does such a will exist? Hegel once said, “The people is\r\nthat part of the state that knows not what it wants.” It seems at first\r\nglance that that is true. How many men there are who, when faced by a\r\npolitical problem, seem completely incapable of judging and making a\r\ndecision. In regard to questions of prime importance in contemporary\r\npolitics the great mass of individuals, no matter to what class they\r\nbelong, remain hesitant and uncertain. There is in the last analysis no\r\nfirm and conscious will in the many. There are unreflected and obscure\r\nimpulses which govern men in political matters. And if such are the\r\nisolated volitions of individuals, what can one expect of the sum total\r\nof these volitions? Is it possible to derive from the sum of these\r\nnegations anything positive and to extract from these fugitive volitions\r\nanything that resembles a collective will?\r\n\r\nThe individual wills are not only too feeble and too little conscious;\r\nthey are also too dissimilar and contradictory to permit being\r\nconstructed into an ensemble. It is a chaos of infinitely diversified\r\nindications; making it an absurd project to try by means of an election\r\nto secure a parliament that will constitute a faithful mirror of these\r\nchaotic indications.\r\n\r\nYet popular will should not be, cannot be, a myth, for in every chapter\r\nof modern history it is encountered and its power felt. At the birth of\r\nconstitutional states and at every epoch of their increase in strength\r\nits action is noted; whether in the victorious thrust of the principle\r\nof nationalities or in the development of the socialist idea. All these\r\nmovements--and how many others!--have denoted that there is in the great\r\nmasses an active and powerful will. In war, too, is it not the popular\r\nwill that leads masses to consent to sacrifices such as would not have\r\nbeen believed possible? There is such a thing as popular will, and no\r\narguments given against its existence are valid.\r\n\r\nIt must be examined, therefore, in concrete fashion how what is rightly\r\nconsidered as the popular will is expressed in practice in modern\r\npolitical democracies. If all the processes of this formation are\r\nreduced to their essential elements, discarding all complications that\r\nmay introduce error, there is revealed this: the fact that between the\r\nindividual and the people as a whole there interposes itself a third\r\nelement, the political party. What matter if in some respects one may\r\nthink that, even under the most favorable circumstances, it is only\r\na necessary evil? The political party is a political means not only\r\nindispensable but fecund and perfectly rational. Its essential function\r\nis _to transform isolated volitions into a collective will of the\r\nensemble_. Therein, too, the apparent contradiction between the fact that\r\nthe crowd has no conscious will and the postulate of a popular will is\r\nreconciled. The tendencies of individuals, chaotic as they may be, change\r\ncompletely in nature when they are joined to equal or similar tendencies\r\nof many other individuals. From the contact of these vague and troubled\r\nimpulses there springs forth the conscious and clear collective will.\r\nCertain impulsive forces particularly powerful disengage from others and\r\nunite with adjacent currents to create and to strengthen a movement that\r\ncan attract the masses. It is only when chaos is thus organized and when\r\nimpulses are thus transformed into forces that these forces acquire a\r\npolitical significance and can be compared and confronted in a parliament.\r\n\r\nSuch being the primary function of the political party in a democracy,\r\npositive legislation must be such as to permit it to fulfil this function\r\nin order that the powerful popular will shall be most clearly and easily\r\nclarified and formulated by it. We must examine how this has been\r\nembodied in German law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the democratic principle the Constitution in Article\r\n22 provides: “The delegates are elected by universal, equal, direct\r\nand secret suffrage by all men and women over twenty years of age, in\r\naccordance with the principles of proportional representation. The day\r\nfor elections must be a Sunday or a public holiday. The details will be\r\nregulated by the national election law.”\r\n\r\nThis law is dated April 27, 1920, and was itself followed by an ordinance\r\non May 1, 1920, which specifies each application.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--GENERAL PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nThe system according to which the delegates to the National Assembly were\r\nelected has not given complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection made against it was directed above all against\r\nthe law of November 30, which permits parties to unite their lists of\r\ncandidates, a privilege from which the parties that lent themselves to\r\nneither alliance nor compromise naturally suffered. Such lists have been\r\ncriticized as corrupting political morality and obscuring the results of\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nBut it has been also estimated that the division of representation in\r\naccordance with the Hondt system permits the stifling of small groups and\r\nthat after the apportionment of seats in the different districts there\r\nare votes which secure no representation to the detriment of the small\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIt is found also that the division of the territory of the Reich into\r\nelectoral districts has been badly done, some districts being in a\r\ngeneral way much too extensive. There are, as a rule, an average of\r\neleven members per district in the National Assembly, and experience has\r\nshown that this number is too large for the members to be able to know\r\nwell the needs of their districts and to maintain close contact with\r\ntheir electors.\r\n\r\nIt has been decided to abandon, therefore, the system of Hondt and to\r\nadopt an automatic system which was inscribed in Article 24 in the\r\nConstitution of Baden, and which is more customarily known as the _Baden\r\nSystem_. It is thus defined in the above-mentioned article: “Each party\r\nor group of electors is allowed one member for every ten thousand\r\nvotes cast for its list of candidates. In each district the votes\r\nremaining unused are added up for the whole country and are apportioned\r\nrepresentation according to the principle described above. Every fraction\r\nof more than 7,500 votes is permitted a seat.”\r\n\r\nThe originality of the system consists in this: First, the number of\r\nmembers, instead of being fixed according to the number of the population\r\nor of the electors, depends on the number of those actually voting, in\r\nsuch a way that not until after the elections can one count the number\r\nof members that will make up the assembly. The latter, therefore, will\r\nbe more numerous if the electors are more numerous. There is also a\r\nsuperimposition of the tickets. The votes not utilized in the tickets of\r\nthe first degree are reassembled on a list of the second degree where a\r\nnew division of seats is made.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism represents obvious advantages. It insures to each party\r\nexactly as many members as it should receive according to the number of\r\nvotes cast for it throughout the whole state. It realizes the greatest\r\npossible use of remnants of votes, and consequently satisfies as\r\ncompletely as possible the exigencies of proportional representation. All\r\nattempts by the government or by a majority at a cunning and dishonest\r\ndivision of the country into artificial electoral districts are thus\r\neliminated. In addition this system permits the possibility on the part\r\nof parties to give seats to candidates who have exceptional parliamentary\r\nexperience and who play political rôles of the first order, but who\r\ndespise mixing in local political struggles, such as may be considered\r\namong the principal influences in the lowering of the personal character\r\nof parliament. The ticket of the Reich permits each elector to vote\r\nat the same time for the man in whom the locality has confidence, who\r\nknows the needs of his districts and of his electors, as well as for the\r\nleaders who direct his party.\r\n\r\nThe system of Baden can be in turn applied in different modes. To give\r\nthe public a chance to discuss these modes and to pronounce on this\r\nmatter, the government of the Reich in January, 1920, published three\r\nadvance projects of electoral law, each project defining and regulating a\r\nparticular modality.\r\n\r\nProject A introduced the Baden system in its purest form. It provided\r\nfor electoral districts in which the number of voters was generally\r\nsufficient to elect six members; the unutilized votes in each district\r\nwould be immediately summed up in a ticket for the Reich, where\r\nrepresentation would be apportioned in the same manner as within the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nProject B provided for electoral districts of four members each. But\r\nbetween the district tickets and the ticket for the Reich there would be\r\na third: several adjoining electoral districts being united in “a group\r\nof districts,” in which lists called “tickets of the groups of districts”\r\nwould have to be presented. The unutilized votes in the electoral\r\ndistricts would be first added up within the “union of districts” and\r\ncredited to the ticket of this union. The ticket for the Reich would then\r\nreceive only the unutilized fractions of each group.\r\n\r\nProject C provided for electoral districts of the same extent and for\r\ngroups of districts of the same nature as Project B. But parties would\r\nbe free to present or not tickets in the groups of districts, the\r\nunderstanding being, that if they decided to present for election a list\r\nof candidates in each group of districts, they could not present lists\r\nwithin the districts of the group. This provision was designed to answer\r\nthe following need. Groups of electors, not numerous enough to obtain\r\nin the first instance one or more seats in this or that district, could\r\nunite in groups of the same party for adjoining districts to present a\r\nticket in common (a ticket of the group of districts) which would apply\r\nfor the whole group or for only some of the districts entering into this\r\ngroup. While the big parties, to avoid the inconveniences of cumbersome\r\ntickets, would present in general a list of candidates by districts,\r\nthe little parties would be able to present but one ticket for several\r\ndistricts, which would enable them to secure seats they could not\r\notherwise win.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe project of the electoral law which was presented by the Cabinet to\r\nthe Reichsrat on March 2, 1920, adopted the mechanism of project C.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet justified its choice as follows: It is only in small\r\ndistricts that the indispensable contact between electors and their\r\ndeputies can be maintained and, that long lists of candidates, which\r\nalways lead to unpleasant surprises, can be avoided. If the electoral\r\ndistricts are reduced to no more than four deputies each, as project C\r\nwould have it, the first candidate on each list would have in general\r\nthe best chance of being elected; which would in most cases assure\r\nrepresentation to the most intelligent electors in the district. The\r\ncriticism which can be made against the ticket for the Reich that a\r\ncertain number of members can be sent to Parliament elected not directly\r\nby the people but by the executive committees of the parties, is reduced\r\nto a minimum in project C as compared to project A, by the introduction\r\nof the tickets for the groups of districts. The number of deputies to be\r\nelected on the ticket for the Reich is thereby reduced and the influence\r\nof executive committees of the parties is diminished in favour of the\r\ninfluence of local organizations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, project B could not be supported. The establishment,\r\nthe examination, and the publication of each of the lists of candidates\r\nfor each of the three degrees to which the division of seats would be\r\nmade, must offer serious difficulties, given the brief time to which\r\nwould be reduced the preparations of elections. According to Article\r\n63 of the Constitution, elections must be held at the latest on the\r\nsixtieth day after the expiration of the legislature or the dissolution\r\nof the Reichstag. Electoral authorities could not, except with hasty and\r\ndesperate work, assure in such a short space of time the preparation\r\nof elections of the three degrees. In addition, system B has the\r\ninconvenience of requiring a considerable number of candidates before\r\nit is possible to foretell, even approximately, how many candidates of\r\neach of the two first degrees would be elected. It is true, however, that\r\nit had the advantage of reducing to a minimum the number of candidates\r\nelected on the ticket for the Reich.\r\n\r\nFinally, project C, in giving to groups of electors the choice of either\r\npresenting district tickets or joining groups of neighbouring districts\r\nin presenting a common ticket, answered best the need of parties to\r\ndispose their forces most effectively within the different districts. It\r\npermitted them, so to speak, to group their districts according to their\r\nfancy, following their particular needs.\r\n\r\nThis was in outline the system which the Government designed and\r\nsubmitted to the Reichsrat. But before this assembly finished its\r\nscrutiny of it the events of March, 1920, transpired, completely changing\r\nthe political situation and rendering general elections imperative for\r\nthe following June. Instead of examining thoroughly, as it had been\r\ntheir intention, the project submitted by the Government, the National\r\nAssembly, in considering this project on March 27, was compelled to pass\r\nto a vote as quickly as possible. Neither did the Government defend its\r\nproject with any particular consistency. Minister of the Interior Koch\r\nexplained that the Government adhered above all to the principle of the\r\nautomatic system and to the grouping of fractions into a ticket for\r\nthe Reich. As for the division of German territory into new electoral\r\ndistricts, smaller and more equal in extent than those which had served\r\nin the election of the National Assembly, but districts that could be\r\nunited into “groups of districts,” that was an interesting innovation.\r\nBut if this was to be effected it would be necessary to adopt in\r\ntheir ensemble the projects admitted to the Assembly. Meanwhile the\r\nquestion presented itself whether the party organizations would be able\r\nto accommodate themselves to so radical a change in the division of\r\ndistricts, given the brief delay which would be accorded them until the\r\nelections. The Minister referred the question to the deputies themselves\r\nto answer, as being in closer contact with the organizations of their\r\nparties. The Assembly decided to retain in principle the electoral\r\ndistricts that had served in their own election; the only modifications\r\nto be made were those necessitated by very grave imperfections of the\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nHaving rejected a new distribution of districts, the Assembly had also\r\nlogically to reject the institution of “tickets of groups of districts”\r\nas a substitute for district tickets; it thus came back to the system of\r\nProject A--fixed districts for all parties and the assigning of fractions\r\nto a ticket for the Reich.\r\n\r\nThis ticket for the Reich, therefore, would have been presented if\r\nthere had not been brought forward some modifications of the principle\r\nbecause of grave inconveniences. Foremost of these was the following\r\nobjection: In trying to apportion the votes cast by the electors for\r\nthe National Assembly according to the mechanism provided by Project A,\r\nit was seen that 18 per cent of the members of the Reichstag, that is\r\nnearly one-fifth, would be elected on the ticket for the Reich and it was\r\nestimated that such a result in the elections of future Reichstags would\r\nbe but little compatible with the constitutional principle of the direct\r\nvote. It was decided in rejecting “group-of-districts tickets” to create,\r\nnevertheless, groups of districts. Political parties could declare in\r\nadvance that they would “unite” within these groups the whole or parts\r\nof their district tickets, in such manner that the votes cast for these\r\ntickets and remaining unutilized would be assigned to the district\r\ntickets receiving the largest number of votes. It would not be until this\r\nsecond redistribution that the fractions would be transferred to the\r\nticket for the Reich. The object was to avoid the possibility that by\r\nassigning fractions to “joined” tickets and to the ticket for the Reich,\r\nthe big political parties would be thereby risking loss to the advantage\r\nof small groups of electors which could not assemble within any district\r\nan appreciable number of votes.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the following double distribution was adopted. No party\r\nwill be entitled to a seat by “joining” its district tickets unless one\r\nof its tickets has obtained at least 30,000 votes (half of the number\r\nnecessary to elect a member). No party will be assigned on the ticket\r\nfor the Reich a larger number of members of the Reichstag than had been\r\nelected for that party in the districts on the district tickets.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE ELECTORATE AND ELIGIBILITY.\r\n\r\nIn principle every German twenty years old is an elector, without\r\ndistinction of sex.\r\n\r\nCauses for the deprivation of the electoral right of individuals are\r\nreduced to a minimum. The only ones denied this right are those who are\r\nplaced under guardianship and those who have been deprived of their\r\ncivic rights by a court decision. Bankrupts and paupers preserved their\r\nelectoral rights, in contrast to their situation before the war. Soldiers\r\nwho had taken part in the elections for the National Assembly were again\r\ndisenfranchised so long as they remained under colours. Finally certain\r\nother conditions, which did not involve the loss of electoral rights,\r\nstill prevented their exercise: detention in institutions for mental\r\nailments and imprisonment, including preventive imprisonment. The laws\r\nspecified, however, that individuals imprisoned for political reasons\r\ncould demand that measures be taken to permit them to exercise the right\r\nto vote.\r\n\r\nTo be able to vote, when one is an elector, one has to be entered on\r\nan electoral list or on an electoral roll, or be furnished with an\r\n“electoral certificate.” These last two institutions are unknown in\r\nFrance and must be explained.\r\n\r\nGermany ignores the principle known as permanence of electoral lists.\r\nBefore the Revolution electoral lists were in principle revised for each\r\nelection to the Reichstag. But the granting to women of the right to\r\nvote, which doubled the number of electors, and the fact that thereafter\r\nthe electors of the Reich would have to vote not only every four years\r\nfor the Reichstag, but also in the election of the President, and\r\nin cases of referendum, initiative, and plebiscites provided by the\r\nConstitution, have increased the difficulty of retaining the former\r\nsystem pure and simple.\r\n\r\nThere were in addition different proposals made to abolish it completely\r\nand to replace it by a procedure which would do away entirely with\r\nelectoral lists. There would be given to each elector an “electoral\r\npassport” or a “citizenship card”[28] which would be sufficient to\r\nenable him to vote. But these propositions were rejected because of\r\nthe considerable cost of the passports or of the cards, and because of\r\nthe technical difficulties of furnishing adequate photographs of all\r\nthe electors, necessitated by this scheme; and in addition because for\r\ncertain votes, such as plebiscites and initiatives, it is necessary that\r\nthe number of individuals having the right to vote be known, which would\r\nbe difficult according to the systems proposed.\r\n\r\nAnother proposal achieved more success; that of electoral cards. This\r\nsystem consists in this, that electoral lists, instead of being made\r\nup by the administrative authorities, are made up by the electors\r\nthemselves. To this end there are given by the communes to their electors\r\ncards which consist of several coupons. The elector fills out his card\r\nand returns it to the municipality, which verifies and completes it.\r\nThe cards are then sent to the seat of the electoral district and are\r\nnumbered. Then the coupons are detached. Coupons Number 1 make up the\r\nelectoral lists; coupons Number 2 make up a duplicate; coupons Number\r\n3 are sent back to the electors. This last coupon is for the elector\r\na proof that he is entered on the electoral rolls and establishes his\r\nidentity and the number he bears on the roll, before the election board.\r\nIt is his voting card.\r\n\r\nThis system is a simplification, in the sense that it dispenses with the\r\nmaking of an alphabetical list and puts part of the work on the elector.\r\nBut in spite of these advantages it has not been completely adopted.\r\nThe electoral law _provides, that, the different districts before each\r\nelection must prepare lists of its electors; and it leaves to them the\r\nchoice of preparing this list either according to customary rule for\r\nelectoral lists, or according to the procedure of electoral cards_.\r\n\r\nThe elector is entered on the list of the district in which he lives, and\r\nit is there theoretically that he is supposed to vote. But there is an\r\nexception to this rule; if he is away from home on the day of election,\r\neither because of business reasons that compel his travelling at the time\r\nof election, or because of a necessary absence at some health resort,\r\nor because he has had to change his residence before election, he can\r\ndemand an electoral certificate[29] which will permit him to vote in any\r\nelectoral district of the Reich.\r\n\r\nThis innovation has appeared to present little danger, for in the new\r\nelectoral system a political party is never interested in getting more\r\nvotes in one district than in another.\r\n\r\nEvery elector is eligible as candidate for the Reichstag on the double\r\ncondition that on the day of election he is twenty-five years old, and\r\nthat he has been a naturalized German for at least a year. In addition to\r\nthis he must be regularly placed on the list of candidates.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that for the National Assembly every elector was\r\neligible; one could thus be elected member at the age of twenty.\r\nActually, however, the youngest elected was twenty-seven years old. The\r\nnew law returned to the rule followed for the former Reichstag in fixing\r\nthe minimum age at twenty-five.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that those who, without being permanently deprived of\r\nthe right to vote, are only prevented from voting by certain special\r\ncircumstances, because of being under colours, or imprisonment, or\r\nbecause by mistake they have been left off electoral lists, are eligible\r\nfor election. In the same way civil servants are also eligible. German\r\nlaw does not know relative ineligibilities, which French public law\r\nadmits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--PREPARATION OF ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn a country of sixty million inhabitants of whom more than half\r\nare electors and vote, above all, where the system of proportional\r\nrepresentation has been adopted, preparation of the elections takes\r\non special importance. An organization must be provided which permits\r\nto each elector the exercise of his right, and, as far as possible,\r\nfacilitates it.\r\n\r\nGerman law provides to this end a rather complex machinery. First, it\r\nprovides for a table of thirty-five electoral districts into which the\r\nterritory of the Reich is divided, and for seventeen groups of districts,\r\ninto which districts are joined.\r\n\r\nThen it institutes a whole series of organisms appointed by the\r\nadministration and charged with the duty of seeing that the electoral\r\nprocedure was carried out properly. These organisms are:\r\n\r\n1. Electoral committees, which have as their function the examination\r\nof lists of candidates, the union of such tickets, and the compiling of\r\nthe election results for each degree of the distribution of seats in the\r\nReichstag. There are electoral committees for each district, for each\r\ngroup of districts, and a committee for the Reich. 2. Superintendents\r\nof elections, who preside over electoral committees, whose function for\r\neach stage of division of seats is to confer with the representatives of\r\npolitical parties, to receive lists of candidates and the declarations\r\nin which the parties “join” their tickets or make up a ticket for the\r\nReich; these superintendents announce the decisions. 3. Chairmen of\r\nelection boards who supervise the electoral operations in their boards.\r\n4. Election boards which consist, in addition to the chairman, of\r\nthree members and six assistants, who supervise the voting and pass on\r\nthe validity of ballots. 5. Men trusted by political parties who serve\r\nas intermediaries between them and the administrative authorities. 6.\r\nDistributors of electoral envelopes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe law specifies very clearly the manner in which lists of candidates\r\nmust be drawn up and presented. There are or may be for each party\r\ndistrict tickets and a ticket for the Reich; there are no tickets for\r\ngroups of districts. These tickets must include only eligible candidates,\r\nthe status of eligibility of a candidate being examined by the competent\r\nelectoral committee. The lists must be signed by 50 or 20 electors,\r\naccording to whether the ticket is for a district or for the Reich. A\r\ncandidate may appear on the tickets of different districts but not more\r\nthan once within the same district.\r\n\r\nEach party may “join” its tickets; which is distinguished from “groups”\r\nof tickets, such as were allowed in the elections for the National\r\nAssembly. The “group” of tickets was a contract between the signatories\r\nof two or more tickets of different parties, the intention being to\r\nhave these tickets considered in the counting of ballots as one and the\r\nsame tickets as against other tickets. It was, therefore, an electoral\r\nalliance between different parties within the same district. These unions\r\nof tickets, as we have seen, are now forbidden. The new law, on the other\r\nhand, provides that tickets may be “joined,” that is to say, that a union\r\nmay be effected of tickets of the same party within different electoral\r\ndistricts, in order to utilize best the electoral fractions. In order\r\nto be valid this combination must take place within the same group of\r\ndistricts and between lists belonging to the same party, that is to say,\r\njoined on the same ticket for the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS.\r\n\r\nSeats are distributed among the tickets.\r\n\r\nEach district ticket receives one seat for every 60,000 votes cast for\r\nit in that district; the number of those elected, therefore, depends no\r\nlonger on the vote of electors or of inhabitants but on the number of\r\nthose voting.\r\n\r\nThe votes which cannot enter into this count because their number is\r\nless than 60,000 remain unutilized if the ticket has not been joined to\r\nanother in the same group of districts; or if it has not been combined in\r\na ticket for the Reich. But if, as is the case usually, the situation is\r\notherwise, the votes are treated differently, according as one of two of\r\nthe following conditions is encountered:\r\n\r\n(_a_) If district tickets of the same party are joined together within a\r\ngroup of districts, the votes constituting the fractions described above\r\nare added together and the party receives as many seats as there are\r\ngroups of 60,000 in the total. These seats are assigned to the ticket\r\nthat receives the largest fraction, on the condition that this district\r\nticket has already received at least 30,000 votes. The design is to avoid\r\nthe possibility that small groups, in joining their lists, may obtain\r\na seat at a time when they have not received in any district half the\r\nnumber of votes necessary to elect a member of the Reichstag. If this\r\ncondition is not fulfilled the vote fractions are not utilized.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If the district tickets are not united, all these vote fragments\r\nare immediately transferred to the Reich ticket. Here, too, are assigned\r\nthe vote fragments that remain after the operation provided in the above\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The ticket for the Reich receives a member for every 60,000 votes\r\nthereon. Beyond that every fraction in excess of 30,000 is considered\r\nequal to 60,000. But the ticket for the Reich can never obtain more\r\nseats than the total won by the district tickets whose excess fractions\r\nhave been united therein; for here, too, the design is to avoid the\r\npossibility that small groups may secure more seats by means of the\r\nticket of the Reich than they have received by direct votes in the\r\ndistricts themselves.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of seats among the candidates of the same ticket is,\r\nbecause of the system which excludes “splitting” and the joining of\r\ntickets, extremely simple. Those elected are designated according to the\r\norder in which their names appear on the tickets, so that the wish of the\r\nelectors has no part in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--THE ACTUAL WORKING OF THE LAW.\r\n\r\nThe electoral system which we have described was applied for the first\r\ntime in the elections to the first Reichstag of the German Republic on\r\nJune 6, 1920. From the purely technical point of view it seems to have\r\nworked satisfactorily. It is interesting above all to inquire how the two\r\nprincipal innovations in these elections have worked out: woman suffrage\r\nand the automatic distribution of seats.\r\n\r\nI.--Women already voted in January, 1919, at the elections for the\r\nNational Assembly. They voted in considerable numbers. Of the women\r\neligible to vote 83 per cent did so. The percentage among the men was\r\n82.4, which is approximately the same as the women. But this equality\r\ndisappears when we consider the proportion according to the ages of those\r\nvoting. Among the male electors twenty years old only 59.6 per cent\r\nvoted; whereas among the women of the same age 80.5 per cent voted. Thus\r\nthe young women seemed twice as zealous to use the new privileges that\r\nhad been accorded to both. Of the electors from twenty-one to twenty-five\r\nyears old, 70 per cent of the men and 80.9 per cent of the women voted.\r\nBut the statistics change when we come to the older groups. Past the age\r\nof twenty-five it was 84.8 per cent of men that voted, and only 82.6 per\r\ncent of women.\r\n\r\nAt the elections of June, 1921, fewer women seemed to have voted than the\r\nyear before, and this time it was the men who proportionally voted in\r\nlarger numbers.\r\n\r\nBut in 1920 there was tried an experiment in several districts which had\r\nnot been done in 1919. The men and women of these districts voted in\r\nseparate polling places, in order to determine their respective strength\r\nin the various parties. We will cite, among other facts, two instances\r\nobtained in cities of differing political complexion.\r\n\r\nIn Cologne 119,263 men and 110,364 women voted in the sections in which\r\nthis experiment was carried out. The vote was distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Centre           32,964 men  49,154 women\r\n    Social Democrats 36,295  “   24,134   “\r\n    People’s Party   17,768  “   15,944   “\r\n    Independents     18,245  “    8,973   “\r\n    Democrats         6,554  “    4,677   “\r\n    German Nationals  3,190  “    3,422   “\r\n\r\nIn Spandau 23,294 men voted and 23,359 women. Out of every 100 men and\r\n100 women the different parties receive the following proportion:\r\n\r\n    Independents      35.4 men  32.6 women\r\n    Social Democrats  21.3  “   19.3   “\r\n    German Nationals  12.8  “   16.7   “\r\n    People’s Party    12.5  “   14.5   “\r\n    Democrats          8.3  “    7.5   “\r\n    Communists         6.3  “    4.2   “\r\n    Centre             3.2  “    5.0   “\r\n    Other parties       .2  “     .2   “\r\n\r\nThus in the two districts women voted more for the Centre and the parties\r\nof the Right.\r\n\r\nOf the total vote cast for the Independent Socialist Party 33 per cent\r\nwere women. In the Social Democratic party the proportion rose to 40 per\r\ncent. For the parties of the Right the percentage was 52. Whereas of the\r\nCentre women comprised 60 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the Left noted bitterly this irony of history, that it\r\nis precisely the parties that have always been against woman suffrage\r\nthat are most strongly supported by women.\r\n\r\nII.--The application of the automatic system has had several interesting\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThroughout Germany there were cast 26,017,590 votes. This gave the\r\nReichstag 466 members. The votes and the seats were distributed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n          _Parties_           _Votes_   _Seats_\r\n    Social Democrats         5,614,456    112\r\n    Centre                   3,540,830     68\r\n    Democrats                2,202,394     45\r\n    German Nationals         3,736,778     66\r\n    People’s Party           3,606,316     62\r\n    Independents             4,895,317     81\r\n    Communists                 441,995      2\r\n    Bavarian Peasants’ Union   218,884      4\r\n    Guelphs                    319,100      5\r\n    Christian Federalists    1,171,722     21\r\n\r\nOne may wonder that the Communists with 441,995 votes received only two\r\nseats. This is explained by the fact, although they had put up tickets in\r\nall the districts they did not receive more than 60,000 votes, that is\r\none seat, in any district other than Chemnitz. The votes that had been\r\ncast for them in the other districts and the excess of 60,000 received in\r\nChemnitz were transferred to their ticket for the Reich. But there they\r\ncould not receive more than one seat according to the provision that no\r\nticket for the Reich may receive more seats than the number which the\r\nparty in question has won in the districts directly.\r\n\r\nOf the members elected 329 were elected directly in the electoral\r\ndistricts; 44 were elected in the district groups; 51 on the tickets of\r\nthe Reich; 42 other members were sent by territories in which plebiscites\r\nhad been ordered. These districts had not participated in the elections,\r\nand retained until the new system the representation they had received in\r\nthe election for the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted finally, what could have been foreseen and what was\r\naimed at by the law, that the number of votes not utilized is extremely\r\nsmall. The smallest fragment discarded was that of the People’s Party\r\nwith 8,851 votes; then came the Independents with 9,872 votes; the Social\r\nDemocrats with 11,457 votes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which a fragment of more than 30,000 votes became equivalent\r\nto 60,000 and therefore won seats were as follows: Democrats, German\r\nNationals, Christian Federalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--DIRECT GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nUniversal suffrage is the means by which the sovereign people manifests\r\nits will in a democracy. Once the election is over it leaves to the\r\nrepresentatives it has elected the freedom of directing in its name the\r\naffairs of the state. This is the system of representative government. At\r\nthe same time the people give their representatives only limited powers,\r\nand they reserve the right themselves to decide on certain particularly\r\nimportant affairs. In such a case there is direct government. This system\r\nconstitutes obviously an immediate application of the democratic idea;\r\nand it may be said that that Constitution is most democratic which avails\r\nitself most of direct government.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly has admitted without any difficulty the principle\r\nof direct government into the Constitution. According to the expression\r\nof Preuss, direct government to-day is a “postulate of democracy”; to\r\nthis the Social Democrat Quarck has added that direct government is “an\r\nessential element of democracy for which to-day there have been found\r\npositive, practical, and scientific forms, according to established\r\nprinciples of public law.”[30]\r\n\r\nBut in this form of government there is found not only a logical\r\nconsequence of the principle of national sovereignty; there are also in\r\nit certain considerable advantages.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the educational value in the fact that the people\r\nparticipate directly in the conduct of public affairs. It is true it\r\nsometimes happens, in countries which have already applied this form\r\nof government that a decision of the people, far from constituting\r\nprogress, actually marks if not retrogression, at least an arrest in the\r\ndevelopment of social legislation, or even in some matter of general\r\npolicy. Nevertheless the very efforts that are made to convince the\r\npeople and to bring them back to primary considerations, constitutes the\r\nbest kind of civic teaching and gives them a political experience, the\r\nvalue of which in a democracy cannot be exaggerated. The collaboration\r\nof great strata of the population in the creation of laws and in\r\npolitical life profoundly educates the masses in the principles of their\r\nConstitution; and an institution which has been established in a country\r\nafter bitter struggles, perhaps after several defeats, becomes thereafter\r\nalmost impregnable, or cannot be discarded except with extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn addition direct government constitutes the best system of democratic\r\ncontrol over the organs of the state. Care must be taken in a democracy\r\nto institute control over control; for democratic government is\r\nessentially the reign of trust. The destinies of a nation should not,\r\ntherefore, depend exclusively on the parliament. While one may be for\r\nparliamentary government, one may still fear that a powerful majority\r\nmay establish a veritable dictatorship and oppress minorities; or that\r\na majority formed by chance combinations may show itself incapable of\r\naction and retard indefinitely the adoptions of measures impatiently\r\nawaited by the people.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, place in Germany for direct government; but to what\r\nextent? At first this place seems quite limited. Preuss, who in his\r\ndraft of the Constitution made only limited use of it, presented direct\r\ngovernment as convenient above all for small states; but he doubted that\r\none could apply it in any considerable number of ways in a big country\r\nlike Germany. In spite of this opinion direct government gained ground\r\nlittle by little and in the final text occupies considerable place. One\r\nfinds in the Constitution not only the classic forms of constitutional\r\nand legislative initiative and referendum such as, for example, have been\r\ntraditionally employed in Swiss and American democracies; but also we\r\nfind there new applications of direct government.\r\n\r\nThe people express themselves not only on the text of a law. They are\r\nalso the great political judges, the supreme arbiters to whom must be\r\nsubmitted all difficulties of vital importance to the nation. The people\r\ngive to the organs chosen by them the right to legislate and to govern;\r\nbut if a discord arises between these organs or if these organs once\r\nnominated do not bend to the people’s will, they intervene themselves on\r\nthe appeal of one of the organs or of their own accord. Direct government\r\nexpresses itself, therefore, when a conflict arises either between the\r\norgans of national representation, or between this representation and\r\nthe nation itself. In these two cases it is the people who decide the\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst, then, discord may arise between the organs of national\r\nrepresentation. Being given a multiplicity of these organs the issues in\r\nwhich the people is thus appealed to for intervention may be of several\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n(1) The conflict may arise between two legislative chambers of the Reich.\r\nIf the Reichstag and the Reichsrat cannot agree on the text of a law, the\r\nPresident of the Reich may or must, according to circumstances, order the\r\ntext to be submitted to a popular referendum. The conditions under which\r\nthis referendum is to take place are different according to whether the\r\nlaw in question is a constitutional one or an ordinary law.\r\n\r\nIf the law in question is to be an amendment of the Constitution, the\r\npresupposition is, that (Article 76) this change has been passed by the\r\nReichstag and objected to by the Reichsrat. If the Reichstag does not\r\nyield to this objection and persists in its first decision, or if it\r\nmodifies it but in a manner not entirely conforming to the exigencies of\r\nthe Reichsrat, the latter may demand a referendum and the President must\r\norder it.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, it is an ordinary law that is in question, the\r\npresupposition is again that the Reichsrat has objected to a law voted\r\nby the Reichstag and that the latter disregards this objection. The\r\nPresident in such a case is allowed to decide whether the situation\r\nremains as it is--that is to say, that the projected law fails of\r\nenactment; or, that the difficulty between the two Assemblies shall be\r\nsubmitted to a referendum. It must be noted besides that these matters\r\nreferred for referendum to the people must be limited to the divergencies\r\narising between the two assemblies, and that the people pronounce for\r\neither the text of one assembly or that of the other. If, however, the\r\nReichstag has rallied a majority of two-thirds against the objection\r\nraised by the Reichsrat the choice on the part of the President is\r\nthereby limited. He can only either promulgate or publish the law, or\r\nrefer it to the people.\r\n\r\n(2) The conflict may arise between Parliament and the President; and this\r\nmay present two quite different aspects.\r\n\r\nThe two chambers are in accord on the text of a law which the President\r\ndoes not approve; this is the first kind of conflict. In such a case,\r\nunless the President wants to promulgate the law adopted, he must submit\r\nthe text to a referendum (Article 73, par. 2). It is in effect a very\r\nstrong right of veto given to the President and accorded to him without\r\nmuch difficulty. The Independents, however, in accordance with their\r\nthesis of the uselessness of the President, did not want to grant this\r\nright to appeal to the people in such a case, except to a responsible\r\nminister. Also the members of the German People’s Party opposed the\r\ngranting of this power as useless, being a duplication of the President’s\r\nright to dissolve Parliament. The majority of the Assembly, however,\r\ndisagreed with them.\r\n\r\nThe German Nationals saw in this measure new opportunity to strengthen\r\nthe authority of the President and did not let the occasion escape them.\r\nThe parties of the coalition, on the other hand, felt that in investing\r\nthe President with these powers they only applied logically their\r\ndemocratic principles. The referendum appeared to them, in addition in\r\nthis particular case, less of an increase of the President’s powers than\r\nas a corrective of the fact that he has powers too great. A democracy,\r\naccording to them, can with less risk give itself a strong executive, if\r\nit also includes among them his right to call a referendum in case of\r\nconflict, which would thereby enable the people to rule on the conflict.\r\nOn the other hand, the supporters of the principle of separation of\r\npowers supported this use of the referendum, which seemed to them more in\r\nconformity with their principles than the power to dissolve the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of conflict which can arise between the Reichstag and the\r\nPresident is not merely a question of legislation but of general policy.\r\nAccording to the terms of Article 43, par. 2, “the President may be\r\nremoved by the vote of the people on proposal of the National Assembly.”\r\nThis provision was adopted without discussion and its presence in the\r\nGerman Constitution is quite understandable. The National Assembly wished\r\nto create a strong president; in fact, it has given him almost absolute\r\npower. He is the man entrusted by the people along with the Reichstag\r\nand the Cabinet. If he betrays this trust who other than the people\r\nthemselves should decide that? But if he has retained the confidence of\r\nthe people, what is there to fear from his being brought before it as\r\na tribunal? In addition to this Article 43 specifies wisely that the\r\nvote, whereby the Reichstag decides to place the question of removal\r\nof the President before the public, must be a majority of two-thirds.\r\nFinally the same Article logically provides that if the people pronounce\r\nagainst the removal of the President in such an instance, the Reichstag\r\nis thereby dissolved, for it is the latter in such a situation that has\r\nceased to be in contact with the people.\r\n\r\n(3) A conflict can also arise within the Reichstag itself. The hypothesis\r\nis provided by Article 73, par. 2, thus: “A law whose promulgation is\r\ndeferred at the demand of at least one-third of the National Assembly\r\nshall be submitted to the people, if one-twentieth of the qualified\r\nvoters so petition.”\r\n\r\nThis procedure complicates the work of the legislator. Dr. Heinze, member\r\nof the German People’s party, has developed the following argument with\r\nmuch force: A project of law has been sent by the Cabinet, with the\r\napproval of the National Council, to the Reichstag, which, however, votes\r\na different text for it. This text comes back to the Reichsrat, which\r\nraises objection to it. The Reichstag on a reconsideration of the text\r\nadopts a compromise, as in the great majority of actual instances. But\r\nthere is always in the Reichstag a minority opposed to this compromise,\r\none which proposes to postpone the promulgation of the law and to submit\r\nit to a referendum. For this proposal to become operative, it is required\r\nthat one-twentieth of the electors of the Reich support it, which, if\r\nobtained, compels a popular referendum on this matter. This procedure is\r\nextremely complicated and can often become dangerous. For one-third of\r\nthe Reichstag, forced by the party or the group that is behind it, can\r\nfeel itself obliged to propose a referendum to the people even when the\r\nReichstag and the Reichsrat have concluded happily a precise agreement.\r\nInto this agreement there becomes injected a referendum with all its\r\nhazards.[31]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this criticism the text was adopted because in Germany\r\ncabinets are most often formed by temporary coalition of parties; and\r\nthe provision in question has the effect of giving an existing coalition\r\nlonger life and permitting the solution of disputes, thereby avoiding the\r\nbreak-up of the coalition or a dissolution of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n(4) A conflict, finally, may arise between the government of the Reich\r\nand that of a state over the question which is perhaps the most serious\r\none that can arise in a federal state--the territorial constitution of\r\nmember states. Suppose the question comes up of either changing the\r\nterritorial boundaries of a state or forming a new state. If one of the\r\nstates in question refuses to give its consent the population is then\r\nconsulted and it decides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of conflict, more serious perhaps than those just\r\nexamined. These are the conflicts that arise between the people and its\r\nrepresentatives. Let us suppose that the latter do not carry out the\r\nprovisions or the orders given them by the people. The latter in such a\r\ncase take matters into their own hands, with or without the collaboration\r\nof the representatives, and impose their will upon them. Such a procedure\r\nis popular initiative.\r\n\r\nBut here, too, several hypotheses must be distinguished:\r\n\r\n(1) The people, for example, want a law which its representatives do not\r\ngive it. Shall the people be given the right themselves to bring that law\r\ninto being?\r\n\r\nThe parties of the Right of the Assembly supported the negative to this\r\nquestion with considerable force. They held that to give the people such\r\na right to initiate legislation is to set up a rule of mistrust against\r\nthe qualified organs of national representation. Once these organs are\r\nelected, they bear the responsibility of their decisions in the eyes of\r\nthe nation, and the latter must give them freedom to act. But to submit\r\nrepresentatives to the incessant control on the part of the people is\r\nan exaggerated democratization. Further, if the Reichstag does not pass\r\nthe law demanded by the people, the President, the man in whom trust\r\nhas been placed by the nation, has only to dissolve the Reichstag.\r\nModern laws, also, are too complicated for the people to be able to give\r\nqualified decision on everything they feel like deciding.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of such initiative replied that a control of this kind\r\nover Parliament could not be instituted by leaving it all to the\r\nPresident of the Reich alone. Occasions may arise in which both the\r\nPresident and the Reichstag have lost contact with public opinion;\r\nin which case it would be necessary for the people to make its voice\r\nheard. It is also a truth born of experience that all great political\r\nand social thoughts are at first the product of very small groups, and\r\nit is only little by little that these become impressed on the masses.\r\nThe initiative is only a particular form of this evolution, and it\r\npresents also this advantage, that it gives the popular movement the\r\nchance to concentrate on a particular and important question, instead\r\nof, as in ordinary elections, becoming dissipated among a large number\r\nof questions of unequal interest. Finally, the example of Switzerland is\r\nvery encouraging. The proof is found there that the people often see more\r\nclearly than their government, and that the initiative is the most solid\r\nbulwark against the impositions of extremists. In the last analysis the\r\npossibility of a popular initiative makes the political activity of the\r\ngovernment more living, and influences public agencies democratically in\r\na very desirable sense.\r\n\r\nFinally legislative initiative by the people has been included in the\r\nConstitution (Article 73, par. 3), but under certain conditions. It is\r\nrequired that a detailed bill be submitted, to avoid the possibility that\r\nthe people may be called to decide merely on a general principle, about\r\nwhich it is very easy to create an artificial disturbance. It provides\r\nthat one-tenth of the electors of the nation must support this bill.\r\nThis approval given, the Cabinet is obliged to submit the text to the\r\nReichstag after stating its own attitude on it. The Assembly then either\r\naccepts the bill, thus satisfying the people; or it changes or rejects\r\nit; in which case a referendum is then resorted to, in which the people\r\ndecides as the final resource.\r\n\r\n(2) A second hypothesis is that in which a conflict between its people\r\nand its representatives, or a part of its representatives, occurs as\r\nin the case we have already described, where a third of the members of\r\nthe Reichstag demand that the promulgation of a law be deferred. It is\r\nrecalled that in such a case a referendum is obligatory if one-twentieth\r\nof the electors of the nation support the demand of these deputies. There\r\nis in this a combination of the initiative and the referendum. The action\r\nof the deputies of the minority of the Reichstag in order to achieve a\r\nreferendum must be supported by an already considerable number of the\r\ncountry’s electors.\r\n\r\nBut it must be noted--and this applies equally to the two kinds of\r\ninitiative we refer to--that according to the terms of Article 73, par.\r\n4, certain laws are not open to popular initiative, and consequently to\r\nreferendum. These are the laws which because of their financial character\r\noffer to electors a very strong temptation to profit by their sovereignty\r\nto make their personal interest prevail. Such laws are those on the\r\nbudgets and taxes and those relating to the salaries of civil servants.\r\n\r\n(3) There is finally a last instance in which popular initiative may\r\noperate. It is that provided by Article 18, par. 4, whereby a population\r\nwishes the government of its state and the government of the Reich to\r\nproceed to a change in the territory of the state or to the creation of\r\na new one. If one-third of the inhabitants demand it the Cabinet of the\r\nReich is obliged to order a referendum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the conditions and the limits within which the Constitution\r\nprovides for direct government within the Reich. It prescribes that a\r\nlaw shall be enacted regulating the details of the application of the\r\nprinciples it puts forward; but up to the present time this law has not\r\nyet been enacted. The Cabinet has, however, proposed a bill concerning\r\nit.[32]\r\n\r\nIn the case of discord between the organs of the state, that is to\r\nsay, in the case where the people are called in by one of the organs\r\nin conflict, the government proposes to apply, _mutatis mutandis_, the\r\nprocedure prescribed by the electoral law.\r\n\r\nFor the initiative, the procedure is naturally more complicated, for it\r\nconsists of two phases. One part of the people takes the initiative and\r\ncollects support for it. If this support attains the numbers prescribed\r\nby the Constitution, a referendum is called. The initiative, therefore,\r\nis always followed by a referendum, unless in the interim the authors of\r\nthe initiative have been satisfied otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is to organize effectively the first phase of this\r\nprocedure, to launch the initiative properly so-called, in a country\r\ncomprising on the average thirty million electors who vote. In the Swiss\r\ncantons, and in the United States of America, the initiative comes into\r\nbeing by the gathering of signatures to a petition. In Switzerland such\r\nsignatures of electors often require authentification; but this leads\r\nto considerable difficulty, for, frequently the electors have their\r\nnames signed by others whom they delegate to do so. In certain of the\r\nUnited States the conditions for the exercise of the right of initiative\r\nare variable. Often it is sufficient that the individuals who gather\r\nthe signatures to such petitions give assurance that the signers are\r\nqualified electors.\r\n\r\nIn Germany it is believed that such a system could not be accepted and\r\na procedure has been considered in which the electors would inscribe\r\nthemselves on lists placed at their disposal by district authorities. In\r\naddition the formality of inscription on these lists would be preceded by\r\nan examination whose purpose would be to see if the conditions provided\r\nby the Constitution for the inauguration of a popular initiative have\r\nbeen complied with. This provision has for its purpose the elimination\r\nof initiatives doomed obviously to failure. This would permit the\r\npublic authorities, once the principle of the initiative is accepted,\r\nto announce such a possibility officially in order to give the people a\r\nchance to take a position on the matter.\r\n\r\nA demand that an initiative be admitted must be made by at least\r\nfive thousand electors. When the proposal for the inauguration of an\r\ninitiative has been admitted, all the electors can vote on it within a\r\nperiod, which usually is about thirty days. This voting is done under the\r\nauspices of the district authorities, to whom the task of gathering and\r\ncounting the signatures is thus confided as one of their official duties.\r\n\r\nIf the signatures thus gathered are sufficient in number, the referendum,\r\nif it is decided upon, proceeds according to the provisions indicated\r\nabove and which are analogous to the electoral procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA democracy, above all one comprising seventy million inhabitants, no\r\nmatter to what great extent it makes use of direct government, cannot\r\nnevertheless govern itself that way. It must furnish itself with\r\nrepresentatives charged with the direction of public affairs. Democracy\r\npresupposes by definition a representative government.\r\n\r\nBut this government may assume different aspects, and the republic--for\r\nwe have seen that the republic is the normal form of democratic\r\ngovernment--may be organized according to three different principles.\r\n\r\nThere may be noted, according to the type, the _presidential republic_,\r\nsuch as the United States of America, which tends to realize a separation\r\nof powers as complete as possible and in which the President elected by\r\nthe people and his ministers or secretaries nominated by the President\r\nare never responsible to the Parliament. Then there is the _collegiate\r\nrepublic_, such as Switzerland and the Hanseatic Cities, in which\r\nthe President is replaced by a college which is, by the side of the\r\nParliament, an organ of popular sovereignty and which exercises executive\r\npowers. This college is elected by the popular representative body and\r\ndepends on it. Finally there is the _parliamentary republic_, such as\r\nexists in France.\r\n\r\nWe know what makes up parliamentary rule. Here also legislative\r\npower and executive power are separated and are to a certain measure\r\nindependent. But the two cannot exercise their functions except when in\r\nco-operation. On the one hand, a certain separation; on the other, a\r\ncertain co-operation, co-operation of separate and independent powers.\r\nThe functioning of this system is insured by a very simple mechanism.\r\nThe president names his ministers but these ministers cannot begin\r\nfunctioning or remain as such until they have obtained the confidence of\r\nthe national representative body. The day that these ministers lose this\r\nconfidence they also lose their power. Parliament does not only exercise\r\nlegislative power therefore; it also controls executive action. The chief\r\nof states names his ministers, but he has not the liberty to appoint\r\nthem. He must take those designated by the majority of the Chamber and\r\nreject them when they are discarded by the Chamber.\r\n\r\nIt is this last system that the German Constitution has chosen. One may\r\nexpress surprise thereat. For has not Germany been the classic ground\r\nfor pleasantries over “parliamentary cretinism”? However, it has chosen\r\nparliamentarism. To use the words of Member of the Reichstag Koch, “The\r\nbest form of expression of democracy is parliamentarism. We know of\r\nno other form superior to it and we have consequently decided to make\r\nparliamentarism one of the foundations of the new edifice.”[33]\r\n\r\nNow, the mechanisms which the Constitution has instituted, and through\r\nwhich the parliamentary system must function, are--either because of\r\nthe federal form of the State, or because of new ideas which it has\r\nintroduced in its creation--more numerous and more complicated than in\r\nmost other countries. There is a Reichstag, a President, a Cabinet, a\r\nReichsrat, and an Economic Council.\r\n\r\nThis last will be studied in the section of this book devoted to the\r\nEconomic Constitution. In the present chapter we shall study the other\r\norgans, and shall inquire in what measure they are capable of insuring\r\nand do insure in fact to Germany the parliamentary government which it\r\nhas chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nTHE REICHSTAG\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag already existed under the régime of 1871. But its\r\npowers have become much more extensive, for it is now the principal\r\nrepresentative of the people, from whom sovereignty is derived. It is\r\nthe principal holder of popular sovereignty. In conformance with the\r\nprinciples of parliamentary government, it enacts laws and controls\r\nthe Cabinet. The regulations that determine its composition and which\r\nspecify its powers should, therefore, be such as to permit it to fulfil\r\ncompletely its double rôle.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE PRIVILEGES AND GUARANTEES ACCORDED TO THE REICHSTAG.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag, charged with the expression of the will of the sovereign\r\npeople, must be able to manifest this will freely. Charged with the\r\ncontrol of the Cabinet it must be protected against all possible\r\ncounterventions of the latter. To this end the Constitution contains a\r\nnumber of provisions which give to the Reichstag as a body, as well as to\r\nits members as individuals, a group of guarantees designed to insure for\r\nthem complete independence of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) The Reichstag considered as a whole possesses a certain number of\r\nprivileges and guarantees, much more numerous than those which were\r\nallowed the former Reichstag and analogous to those which in general\r\nthe parliaments in other free countries possess. To this end the German\r\nConstitution contains several special features.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the right of political assemblies to pass on the\r\neligibility of their members and the regularity of their elections\r\nconstitutes one of their traditional prerogatives, one to which they\r\nhave most strongly adhered. For they have seen in it a weapon against\r\nexecutive power to be used in cases where the latter is tempted to abuse\r\nits authority and exercise pressure on elections. Also most of the\r\ndemocratic countries confer upon their Chambers the right to investigate\r\nthe election of their members and to decide in sovereign fashion on the\r\nvalidity of these elections. Such is the rule particularly in France;\r\nsuch was the rule in Germany up to 1919. But the new Constitution\r\nabandons this tradition in the sense that instead of leaving election\r\ndisputes to the Reichstag itself, it entrusts them to a special\r\ntribunal working alongside of the Reichstag: the Electoral Commission\r\n(Wahlprüfungsgericht). This device, however, was not inspired by any\r\ndesire to limit the rights of the Reichstag. It was dictated by political\r\nconsiderations. The former Reichstag, when it verified the election of\r\nits members, instead of being inspired solely by legal motives often\r\nlet itself be guided by political considerations. The verification of\r\nelections is in itself an act of adjudication, and a political assembly\r\nis ill-prepared to fulfil such a function. That is why the English\r\nParliament has already entrusted the function of judging of elections of\r\nits members to a separate tribunal. Without going as far as that, the\r\nnew German Constitution refers contestants to a mixed tribunal, in which\r\nthere are both members of the Reichstag, and, in order to insure the\r\nimpartial applications of legal provisions, judges by profession.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission includes members of the Reichstag elected to\r\nit by the whole legislature, as well as members of the Administrative\r\nTribunal; until the creation of this body these consist of members of\r\nthe National Judicial Court or Reichsgericht. These are nominated by the\r\nPresident of the Reich on the motion of the President of the Commission.\r\nIn order to become operative the Electoral Commission must be made up as\r\nfollows: five judges, of whom three must be members of the Reichstag, and\r\ntwo magistrates. The procedure is presided over by a commissioner named\r\nby the President of the Reich. This commissioner is particularly charged\r\nwith investigation. It is hoped in Germany that in consequence of the\r\nintroduction of proportional representation, election contests will be\r\nless frequent than formerly and that adjudications of elections by this\r\nCommission will have less importance for the parties than in the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce elected and the elections verified, can the Reichstag freely meet\r\nand continue just as it pleases? In other words, can it be permanent,\r\nthat is to say, has it the right itself to fix the date and the duration\r\nof its sessions? A double danger is here possible. To create a permanent\r\nassembly, would it not give to parliament a dangerous preponderance? But\r\nto give to the executive power unlimited right to call, adjourn, and\r\nprorogue parliament, would it not be to give a prerogative unacceptable\r\nto a democratic country and dangerous to the maintenance of its\r\ninstitutions?\r\n\r\nUnder the old régime, the Reichstag could not meet or commence its work\r\nwithout having been convoked by the Emperor and expressly opened by him.\r\nHowever, the Constitution provided, that the Reichstag must be convoked\r\nat least once every year. But the Emperor had the right to prorogue the\r\nassembly; and the latter had not the right to sit and continue its work\r\nagainst the wish of the Emperor. The Emperor’s right in this respect had\r\nbut one limitation: the prorogation of the Reichstag could not extend\r\nbeyond thirty days without the consent of the Assembly, and it could not\r\nbe renewed during the same session. On the other hand, the Reichstag\r\ncould not conclude its sessions without the consent of the Emperor. It\r\ncould only interrupt its meetings.\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution gives the Reichstag the right to _convoke itself\r\nand to meet of its own accord_. It is the Reichstag which decides as to\r\nwhen it is to meet and how long its session is to continue. It is neither\r\nconvoked nor adjourned by the President of the Reich. According to the\r\nConstitution of Weimar the Reichstag meets for the first time no later\r\nthan the thirtieth day after elections. In addition it is required to\r\nmeet every year on the first Wednesday in November at the seat of the\r\ngovernment. The Reichstag also decides for itself the conclusion of its\r\nsessions and the day of its re-assembling. However, the President is\r\nbound in two cases to convoke the Reichstag at a time prior to the annual\r\ndate fixed by the Constitution, or to the date fixed by the Reichstag\r\nfor its re-assembling. Such situations are (a) when the President of the\r\nReich, (b) when at least a third of the Members of the Reichstag, demand\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIndependent as it is of the Cabinet, the Reichstag must be assured the\r\npower freely to deliberate without fear of riots and insurrections. Most\r\ngovernments have no special legislation in regard to this. They leave to\r\nthe assembly, to which a special guard is assigned, the right to protect\r\nitself. Events, however, have demonstrated that in Berlin revolutionaries\r\neither of the extreme Left or of the extreme Right become, when they so\r\ndesire, “masters of the street.” More efficacious measures had to be\r\nprovided than prevail elsewhere. Accordingly a law was passed by the\r\nNational Assembly, May 8, 1920, “for the protection of the Palace of the\r\nReichstag and of the Landtag (State Assembly).”[34] This law draws about\r\nthese palaces a perimeter of protection, within the limits of which no\r\narmed troops may penetrate, and it also provides different measures to\r\nmake these palaces an adequate shelter against any _coup de main_ such as\r\nmay come at any time from revolutionists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. The Members of the Reichstag as individuals enjoy, like the Reichstag\r\nas a whole, privileges and guarantees such as are necessary to insure\r\ntheir independence. The situation accorded them in this respect is very\r\nanalogous to that which other democratic countries assure the members\r\nof their popular legislatures. They receive compensation.[35] They are\r\n“irresponsible and inviolable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE RULES OF THE REICHSTAG.\r\n\r\nProtected against the Cabinet, against insurrections, and against\r\nindividuals who have designs on their independence, the deputies of the\r\nReichstag can and must organize themselves in such a way as to assure\r\nfor their labours maximum efficiency. It is imperative that the majority\r\nshall be able to impose its will without thereby sacrificing the rights\r\nof the minority. To this effect Article 26 provides, “The National\r\nAssembly chooses its President, Vice-President, and its Secretaries. It\r\nregulates its own procedure.”\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly adopted the procedure of the old Reichstag and the\r\nnew Reichstag seems to have continued it also.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a change of considerable importance has been adopted by the\r\nNational Assembly. Theretofore the members of the Reichstag were divided\r\nby lot into bureaus, and these elected the committees. There are no\r\nlonger any bureaus; and the essential machinery on which the functioning\r\nof the Assembly depends is the group or fraction, each of which consists\r\nof all the members of the Reichstag belonging to the same party.\r\n\r\nAccording to the procedure of the Reichstag, no party can constitute\r\nsuch a fraction if it does not have at least fifteen members. To-day\r\nit is these groups that nominate the various committees of the Assembly\r\non the basis of proportional representation.[36] The group plays a rôle\r\nin Germany much more important than, for example, in France, because of\r\nthe strict party discipline that prevails in these groups. For every new\r\nquestion brought before the Reichstag each group assembles its members,\r\nwho discuss among themselves the attitude to take and the way in which\r\nthe group as a whole is to vote. When the question is most important\r\nthere are held _interfractional meetings_. At these meetings are called\r\ntogether either all the members of certain groups, or only trusted men\r\nor the chiefs of these groups. Sometimes two or more related groups\r\ndeliberate in common; sometimes they are the groups of the majority\r\nparties. Thus, either in single groups or in common the various political\r\nfactions decide in advance their line of actions; and when the matter\r\ncomes up for deliberation in the Assembly, everything is already decided.\r\nThe public meetings of the Assembly are only a kind of show, in the\r\ncourse of which a speaker for each party generally mounts the tribune to\r\nacquaint public opinion with the motives that have determined his group\r\nin taking such and such a stand. A certain amount of dramatic interest\r\nis thereby lost, but perhaps the element of surprise is replaced by more\r\nthoroughly considered and riper decision.\r\n\r\nThe vote is then proceeded to. Voting by proxy is not recognized. Only\r\nthose present can take part in the vote, which is theoretically taken\r\n“sitting” and “rising.”\r\n\r\nIn case of doubt all the members are invited to leave the hall and then\r\nto reenter, those voting “yes” coming in by one door, those voting “no”\r\nby another. There can also be a vote by name, if fifty members demand\r\nit and if the Assembly so decides. In this case ballots of different\r\ncolours are distributed among the members. These ballots bear the names\r\nof the deputies and one of the following: “yes,” “no,” or “I abstain.” At\r\nthe moment of the vote the leaders of the various groups hold up their\r\nballots above their heads, this movement being immediately followed\r\nby all the members of their groups. Then the ballots are given by\r\nthose voting to the Secretaries, who place them in the ballot boxes.\r\nA supervision is maintained to prevent those present from voting for\r\nabsent members. This procedure presents the triple advantage of giving\r\nto the abstaining vote its precise significance, of maintaining strict\r\ndiscipline within the groups and of preventing absent members from voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE DURATION OF THE POWERS OF THE REICHSTAG.\r\n\r\nThe question of the term for which the members of political assemblies\r\nshould be elected is always a delicate one. It has given rise in Germany\r\nto much lively discussion in committee as well as in plenary sessions.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire, the Reichstag was at first elected for three years.\r\nSince 1888 it has been elected for five years. Should this term be\r\nretained?\r\n\r\nOn the Left the Independents considered that the motive which had\r\nprompted the change in 1888, that is, the fear of too frequent elections,\r\ndid not deserve consideration. They held that it was necessary to give\r\nthe German people quickly the political education it lacks, and that\r\nfrequent elections are the best means to employ. They declared that in a\r\ntrue democracy the people should be given the chance to make themselves\r\nheard as often as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Right replied that in all parliaments the first year that follows\r\ngeneral elections is, so to say, lost because of the necessary labour\r\nof preparation; and because the old and the new members must become\r\naccustomed to working together before their efforts achieve appreciable\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nPreuss added that the question to find out was whether parliamentarism\r\nwas wanted or not. A parliament, said he, is inefficient to the extent\r\nthat the term for which it is elected is short. In America the House of\r\nRepresentatives is, it is true, elected for two years, but it is not\r\nthe centre of power and of parliamentary authority. The Senate has more\r\nauthority than the House, and it is elected for six years. In addition\r\nthere is no dissolution of parliament possible in America. If a period of\r\ntwo years is fixed and if in addition the right of dissolution admitted,\r\nwhich is in itself already a remedy against too protracted a term,\r\nthe development of the parliamentary system would be rendered thereby\r\nextremely difficult.\r\n\r\nFinally on the third reading of a bill the Assembly arrived at a medium\r\nterm. The duration of power for members of the Reichstag was fixed at\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--THE POWERS OF THE REICHSTAG.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag is the principal holder of popular sovereignty; as such\r\nit is the most important organ of the national representation. Its\r\nactivity is manifested under different forms and, compared to the old\r\nConstitution, its limits have been greatly broadened. Although it is\r\nabove all a legislative organ, it exercises also an unceasing action on\r\nthe executive power.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--POWERS OF THE REICHSTAG AS PRINCIPAL HOLDER OF SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag being the principal representative of the sovereign people,\r\nit naturally falls to it to speak whenever it is necessary in the\r\nnational or international life of the state to translate or express the\r\nwill of the people. That is the rôle which has devolved upon parliament\r\nin all the democratic countries, and it is also the mission confided to\r\nthe Reichstag by the German Constitution. The situations in which this\r\nAssembly acts as spokesman for the people are of three kinds:\r\n\r\n1. The granting of amnesty. Amnesty is a measure of a general character\r\nwhereby the sovereign, with the object of general pacification, declares\r\nsuch and such crimes legally expiated. In the German Constitution amnesty\r\nhas to be declared in the form of a law. The ordinary procedure for the\r\nenactment of law applies here.\r\n\r\n2. Declaration of war and the conclusion of peace. These proclamations,\r\nin the same way, must be made in the forms of laws.\r\n\r\n3. Treaties of alliance and international treaties. Each of these is\r\ntheoretically concluded by the President of the Reich; but when these\r\ntreaties touch questions which are regulated or can only be regulated\r\nby a law of the Reich, such settlements are not valid except with the\r\nconsent of the National Assembly. (Article 45.) This hypothesis differs,\r\ntherefore, from the first two just examined. In those cases there was\r\nrequired a law, that is to say, the Reichsrat had the right of protest,\r\nand the President could only prepare and execute the decision of the\r\nReichstag, to the same extent that he is compelled to prepare other\r\nlaws of the Reich. In the cases of treaties, however, what is required\r\nis a meeting of the wills of both the Reichstag and the President. This\r\nagreement is required even for the international validity of the treaty,\r\nbut it is self-sufficient, and the Reichsrat would probably not have the\r\nright to protest against such a conclusion.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--LEGISLATIVE POWERS.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the terms of the Constitution of 1871, which divided the\r\nright to legislate between the Bundesrat and the Reichstag but gave the\r\npreponderance to the former, the new Constitution gives to the Reichstag\r\nthe principal rôle in legislative work. The right to legislate is\r\nexpressly placed in its hands. “National laws are enacted by the National\r\nAssembly” (Article 68). But this fundamental right of the Reichstag is\r\nlimited by important powers granted to the Reichsrat, to the President\r\nand to the people.\r\n\r\nThe principal co-operator with the Reichstag, from the point of view of\r\nlegislation, is the Reichsrat. The Reich being, at least theoretically,\r\na federal state, the Constitution grants to the Reichsrat, which\r\n“represents the German states in the legislation and administration of\r\nthe Reich,” the right of important co-operation in legislative matters.\r\nBut this right is not as extensive as that which the old Bundesrat had.\r\n\r\nIt consists first of all in this, that no bill can be submitted to the\r\nReichstag unless it has been _previously accepted by the Reichsrat_.\r\nHowever, this provision does not constitute, as formerly, an absolute\r\nobstacle. When the Reichsrat disapproves of a bill which the Cabinet\r\nhas submitted to it, this project may be, without the consent of the\r\nReichsrat, nevertheless sent on to the Reichstag. The Cabinet is in such\r\na case only obliged to set forth to the Reichstag, in presenting this\r\nbill, the dissent of the Reichsrat (Article 69).\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of the Reichsrat is manifested also in its _right of\r\nprotest_ against the laws enacted by the Reichstag. These laws must in\r\ntheory be enacted with the express or tacit approval of the Reichsrat,\r\nbut this provision is not absolute. If, in effect, after the protest\r\nof the Reichsrat, no accord is reached between this body and the\r\nReichstag, it devolves upon the President of the Reich to decide whether\r\nthe project of law will be abandoned by him, or whether he will resort\r\nto a referendum against the decision taken by the Reichsrat. If this\r\nbill gains the support at the Reichstag of a majority of two-thirds\r\nthe President has then, in spite of the protest of the Reichsrat, the\r\nright to promulgate and to publish the law, without any further vote\r\non it by the Reichstag. But he may also, instead of proceeding to this\r\npromulgation, order a referendum, if he does not want to take upon\r\nhimself the responsibility of deciding this conflict of the Reichstag and\r\nthe Reichsrat.\r\n\r\nThere are thus two ways of breaking the opposition of the Reichsrat:\r\neither the referendum, or else a two-thirds vote for the law on the part\r\nof the Reichstag and joined to it the approval of the President.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when this majority of two-thirds cannot be assembled\r\nin the Reichstag, there are two ways for the opposition in the Reichsrat\r\nto become effective. First, the President may remain passive after\r\nthe protest of the Reichsrat, that is to say, he may not order the\r\nreferendum. The co-operation of the Reichsrat and of the President in\r\nsuch case weighs more than the decision of the Reichstag which has not\r\nbeen able to rally a majority of two-thirds in its favour. The other\r\nway in which a protest of the Reichsrat can become effective is for the\r\nreferendum to support the objection of the Reichsrat and reject the\r\nproject voted by the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Reichstag to legislate is, in the second place, limited\r\nby powers assigned to the President in certain matters. He has the right\r\nto veto any law passed by the Reichstag, in the sense that, according\r\nto Article 73, he is not obliged to promulgate the laws voted, and may\r\nwithin a month submit it to a referendum. If the President is convinced\r\nthat a bill voted by the Reichstag with the consent of the Reichsrat is\r\nagainst the welfare of the people; or if there are serious objection\r\nlodged against it of another character; or if he believes that the\r\nlaw does not correspond with the conceptions held by the people, his\r\nsituation as an independent organ of popular sovereignty gives him\r\nthe right and imposes on him the duty of submitting this project to a\r\nreferendum. In addition, the Constitution (Article 72) authorizes him\r\nto disregard a demand on the part of a third of the Reichstag that\r\nthe promulgation of a law passed by the Reichstag and approved by the\r\nReichsrat be deferred. He can, therefore, promulgate the law voted and\r\ngive it operative power when the Reichstag and the Reichsrat declare it\r\nto be urgent.\r\n\r\nIn the third place the legislative power of the Reichstag is limited by\r\nthe right reserved by the people itself to decide, and in certain cases\r\ndirectly on this or that project of law. Such are the cases we have\r\ndescribed as touching the Constitutional provisions for initiative and\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\nWe must finally note, as the fourth legislative factor, the Economic\r\nCouncil, whose powers, it is true, cannot be considered as constituting\r\na limitation of the Reichstag’s powers, but which may nevertheless be\r\ncalled in to co-operate with the latter in the preparation of laws.\r\n\r\nSuch are the organs that participate in the legislative work. We must now\r\nsee in what manner they function and how a law is passed through this\r\nintricate mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe _initiation_ of a law can take place under any of the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n1. The Government of the Reich, that is to say, the Cabinet, has in the\r\nfirst instance, the initiation of laws. In theory the Cabinet is supposed\r\nto proceed with the consent of the Reichsrat; but in case this agreement\r\nis refused, the Cabinet may nevertheless submit the bill to the Reichstag\r\ntogether with a statement of its attitude. (Article 69.)\r\n\r\n2. Members of the Reichstag may also introduce bills. (Article 68.)\r\n\r\n3. The Reichsrat also has the right of initiation. In theory it is\r\nsupposed to act on a bill in harmony with the Cabinet. But if the latter\r\nrefuses its consent to a bill, the Reichsrat may still submit it to the\r\nReichstag together with a statement of its point of view on it. (Article\r\n69.)\r\n\r\n4. The people themselves may initiate a proposal for a law. (Article 73.)\r\n\r\n5. In matters of social and economic policy, finally, the National\r\nEconomic Council has also the right to propose bills; but here, too,\r\nthe agreement with these bills on the part of the Cabinet is required.\r\nIf, however, the Cabinet refuses its consent to the bill, it must\r\nnevertheless present the proposition to the Reichstag at the same time\r\npresenting its opinion.\r\n\r\nThe law being proposed, _how is it voted on and accepted_? Here, again,\r\nseveral different kinds of situations must be distinguished:\r\n\r\n1. The normal procedure is the vote on the bill by the Reichstag in\r\nagreement with the Reichsrat. The bill may be presented by the Cabinet,\r\nduly passed on by the Reichsrat in agreement and without change and\r\naccepted by the Reichstag as it stands. Or changes by the Reichsrat may\r\nbe approved by the Reichstag. Or the Reichsrat may accept without a\r\ncontest the changes voted by the Reichstag. Or, after a protest by the\r\nReichsrat against a bill voted by the Reichstag, an agreement may be\r\nreached by the two assemblies after a reconsideration of the bill by the\r\nReichstag.\r\n\r\n2. If an agreement cannot be reached between the Reichstag and the\r\nReichsrat, that is to say, if the Reichsrat having raised objection to\r\na bill voted on by the Reichstag, a reconsideration by the latter has\r\nnot brought about an agreement between the two bodies on the bill, the\r\nCabinet may then follow another course. The President may decide that\r\nthis agreement on the bill between the Reichstag and the Reichsrat\r\nbeing impossible, matters rest where they are; then the law does not\r\nbecome operative. If this solution does not commend itself to him, he\r\nmay prescribe a referendum on the question that forms the conflict of\r\nopinion between the two assemblies and the law becomes operative when the\r\nreferendum sanctions the decision of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n3. If, in the proceeding in case of a difference of opinion between the\r\nReichstag and the Reichsrat, the Reichstag persists, after the protest of\r\nthe Reichsrat, in its first decision and supports it with a majority of\r\nat least two-thirds of those voting, the President has the choice either\r\nof passing over the protest of the Reichsrat and promulgating the law, or\r\nelse he may order a referendum. His decision must be made within three\r\nmonths after the decision of the Reichstag. In this case the law may\r\nbecome operative, either by the vote of the Reichstag together with the\r\nPresident’s favorable decision, or by the vote of the Reichstag together\r\nwith the sanction by the referendum.\r\n\r\n4. The President may, in the case of a bill passed by both the Reichstag\r\nand the Reichsrat in agreement, use his right of veto; that is to say, he\r\nneed not promulgate the law but must refer it to a referendum. In that\r\ncase the law does not become operative unless the referendum supports the\r\nvote of the Reichstag. If the referendum pronounces against it the law is\r\ndefinitely rejected. The Constitution does not say whether the President\r\nmay, in such a case, propose a change in the bill and submit this change\r\nto another referendum. We must consequently conclude that he cannot do so.\r\n\r\n5. If one-twentieth of the electors demand that a law already passed\r\nby the Reichstag shall be submitted to a referendum; and if, at the\r\nsame time, at the demand of one-third of the Members of the Reichstag\r\nthe promulgation of that law has been deferred, the latter cannot go\r\ninto effect except after having been approved by a referendum. If the\r\nreferendum pronounces against the bill, the latter is rejected. But this\r\npossibility does not exist in the case where both the Reichsrat and the\r\nReichstag have declared a law to be urgent. The President may in such a\r\ncase promulgate the law in spite of the demand for its postponement.\r\n\r\n6. There remains finally the exceptional case in which a popular\r\ninitiative by one-tenth of the electors proposes the project of a law. In\r\nsuch a case the law, if it is accepted by referendum, becomes operative,\r\nwhether the bill has been passed without change by the Reichstag, or,\r\nwith changes by it, or even in spite of the Reichstag’s rejection.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that a referendum is never resorted to, unless the\r\nReichstag has first taken a vote on the subject. The decisions of the\r\npeople appear, therefore, as a kind of control over, and check on, the\r\nReichstag’s decisions.\r\n\r\nThe procedure just described is that followed for all ordinary laws.[38]\r\n\r\nIn theory it holds also for _constitutional laws_, that is, laws\r\nwhich, according to the Constitution, must be enacted in the form of\r\nconstitutional laws; but there are certain modifications in the procedure\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\nUnder the old Constitution, changes in it could be brought about by the\r\nsame means as ordinary laws. The new Constitution places constitutional\r\nlaw under special protection, and demands that a certain fixed majority\r\nbe obtained for any change in the Constitution. Decisions of the\r\nReichstag tending to such a change are not valid unless two-thirds of\r\nthe legal number of members are present and of those present at least\r\ntwo-thirds vote for such change. In the same way decisions of the\r\nReichsrat tending to a change of the Constitution must obtain a majority\r\nof two-thirds of all the votes cast in their favour.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution contains a special provision in case a constitutional\r\nchange is to be realized on the initiative of the people. In such a\r\ncase, at least one-half of the _electors_ must approve of the change.\r\nThis particular majority was introduced as a condition for the following\r\nreason; the situation had to be met in which the Reichstag rejects a\r\nconstitutional change proposed by popular initiative. Against such a\r\nvote on the part of the Reichstag, which may not be in favour of the\r\nconstitutional change proposed, the decision of the people in favour of\r\nthe change, to become operative must be supported by at least half of the\r\npeople. Where, however, the Reichstag votes in favour of a constitutional\r\nchange it is enough for the referendum to secure a majority of those\r\n_voting_, provided that a majority of the electors have participated\r\nin the vote. Consequently if the Reichstag has voted a constitutional\r\namendment by a vote of two-thirds and if this amendment has been\r\nsubmitted by the President to a referendum, it is sufficient to nullify\r\nthe favourable vote by the Reichstag, if half of the electors of the\r\nReich participate in the vote and the majority of those voting pronounce\r\nagainst the amendment. In other words, to effect a constitutional\r\namendment by means of a referendum a simple majority is sufficient if\r\nthe Reichstag has voted for such an amendment; but if the Reichstag’s\r\napproval is to be nullified in such a case a specified majority is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAnother provision of the Constitution deals with the case where a\r\ndivergence of opinion arises between the Reichstag and the Reichsrat on\r\na constitutional matter. In general when the Reichstag, over the protest\r\nof the Reichsrat, maintains its stand by a majority of two-thirds,\r\nthe President has the option either of promulgating the law voted by\r\nthe Reichstag over the protest of the Reichsrat, or of prescribing a\r\nreferendum. In the matter of a constitutional amendment, to strengthen\r\nthe position of the Reichsrat, the President’s choice is limited. In\r\nsuch a case, if the Reichsrat demands a referendum the President cannot\r\npromulgate the law, even though it has been passed by two-thirds of the\r\nReichstag. This demand must take place within two weeks of the passage\r\nof the bill by the Reichstag. If within that time, the Reichsrat has not\r\nmade use of its right just described, the President recovers his right to\r\nchoose between promulgation and referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--POWER OF CONTROL.\r\n\r\nIn the parliamentary system, the parliament exercises an incessant\r\ncontrol over the acts of the Cabinet, such control consisting of the\r\nresponsibility of the ministers. How is this organized in Germany and in\r\nwhat manner is it actually exercised?\r\n\r\nIt must be noted first that the Constitution does not give control over\r\nthe Cabinet to any but the Reichstag. It is to the Reichstag only that\r\nthe Ministers are politically responsible. The other assemblies that the\r\nConstitution has created, in particular, the Reichsrat, have in this\r\nrespect no power. On the other hand, the confidence of the Reichstag is\r\nabsolutely indispensable to the Cabinet. If the Reichstag withdraws its\r\nconfidence in a Ministry or in a Minister, especially if the Reichstag\r\nexpresses its lack of confidence, the Ministry or the Minister must\r\nresign. (Article 54.) To give to the vote of the National Assembly a\r\ncomplete guarantee of execution the Constitution provides that the\r\nReichstag may prosecute the President and the Cabinet before the National\r\nJudicial Court and demand that the people pronounce on the removal of the\r\nPresident. (Article 43.)\r\n\r\nThe means by which the Reichstag exercises its control over the Cabinet\r\nare, with some minor differences in procedure, the same in Germany as in\r\nmost parliamentary governments.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag may, first, demand the presence of the Chancellor or the\r\nMinisters at its meetings, whether in committee or in full session. The\r\nChancellor, the Ministers, and the Commissioners have the right to be\r\npresent at all the meetings of the Reichstag and its committees. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Cabinet have the right to be heard on their own\r\ndemand at the deliberations of the Reichstag even contrary to the order\r\nof the day. They are subject to the disciplinary power of the President.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe members of the Reichstag may address _questions_ to the Cabinet. The\r\nquestion must be addressed in writing, and if the author of it agrees,\r\nthe Cabinet may respond to it in writing. On the other hand, it must\r\nnot be taken up in public session of the Reichstag except on a Tuesday\r\nor Friday at the head of the order of business. It is then read by its\r\nauthor. The Minister interrogated or some one commissioned by the Cabinet\r\nreplies. But no discussion or motion whatsoever may thereupon at once\r\nresult on this reply. Only the author of the question may take the floor\r\nafter the Minister, and then only to complete or to rectify his question.\r\nThere is naturally no vote taken immediately after the question and it is\r\nnot permitted to transform a question into an interpellation, as it may\r\nbe done, for instance, in France.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary question seems to play a much smaller rôle in Germany\r\nthan in England or even in France, if one compares the German procedure\r\non the written question with that of the French. During the first six\r\nmonths of its existence, the National Assembly addressed about 280\r\nquestions to the Cabinet, most of them in open session. Most of the\r\nTuesday and Friday sessions commence with a series of questions; some of\r\nthem with as many as fifteen to twenty questions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not say one word more on interpellations than on\r\nquestions; but the first form an essential practice of a parliamentary\r\nrégime. It existed to a lesser extent under the old régime. It was of\r\nnecessity retained and developed under the new.\r\n\r\nThe interpellation must be signed by thirteen members. Thus it is no\r\nlonger an individual who interpellates, but a party and the individual\r\nis only the spokesman for the party. When the interpellation is made the\r\nCabinet declares either that it is ready to answer at once, or it fixes\r\nthe date of its reply in agreement with the President of the Assembly.\r\nIn theory this reply must be given within a fortnight. It goes without\r\nsaying that, in contrast to what the Chancellor permitted himself under\r\nthe Empire, the Chancellor and the Ministers of the Reich to-day do not\r\nuse the right, still granted to them by the regulations, to refuse to\r\nreply to an interpellation or to refuse to name the date on which they\r\nwould be disposed to reply.\r\n\r\nThe interpellation is inscribed on the order of business for the day\r\namong the other subjects on which the Assembly is to deliberate. The\r\nspokesman of the party who interpellates and the representative of the\r\nCabinet having spoken, no discussion ensues unless at least fifty of the\r\nmembers present demand it. In such a case all those present may in turn\r\ntake the floor. When all the speakers have finished those present declare\r\nthe discussion closed and the assembly passes automatically and without\r\nvote to the next subject on the order of business.\r\n\r\nHowever, the regulations provide that in the course of the discussion\r\nand interpellation motions signed at least by thirty members present\r\nmay be presented demanding that the assembly declare that the position\r\nthe Cabinet has taken on the affair which has been made the subject of\r\nthe interpellation does or does not correspond to the opinions of the\r\nReichstag. The vote is then proceeded to--unless at least thirty of the\r\nmembers present demand that the vote be postponed to the next session,\r\nsuch a postponement being their right.\r\n\r\nIn practice, however, little use is made of the above provision, and\r\ninterpellations rarely end with a vote; for that would have for its\r\npurpose the ousting of a ministry or a minister. Such a change takes\r\nplace, as we shall see, in circumstances entirely different. The\r\ninterpellations, therefore, are used only to give the parties a chance\r\nto present their points of view on this or that problem raised by the\r\npolitical circumstances of the hour.\r\n\r\nFrom this ensues a twofold consequence. First, interpellations are much\r\nfewer than in France. During the first six months of its existence the\r\nNational Assembly discussed only about ten interpellations. Second, being\r\nrarely the direct cause of the ousting of Cabinets, they provoke less\r\nexcitement in political circles and in public opinion, and the Assembly\r\nmay therefore discuss the problem embodied in an interpellation perhaps\r\nmore objectively.\r\n\r\nThe control by the Reichstag over the Cabinet may be exercised also by\r\nmeans of a _parliamentary investigating committee_. This is a novelty in\r\nGerman public law. In its first draft the project of the Constitution\r\ndid not permit the institution of investigating committees except in\r\ncases where the sincerity or the legality of an act of the Cabinet is\r\nquestioned. But the National Assembly has gone further than that and,\r\nwith the exception of a case of actual lack of confidence in the Cabinet\r\non the part of the Reichstag, the latter assumes the right without\r\nlimitation of appointing investigating committees. These committees\r\nmay, for example, be created to examine economic and other questions of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag must proceed to the appointment of an investigating\r\ncommittee if a fifth of its members demand it. The procedure according\r\nto which these committees may operate is not at all prescribed. The\r\nConstitution says only that such a committee may take such testimony\r\nin open session as it itself or the authors of the proposal of the\r\ninvestigation may consider necessary. But by a majority of two-thirds the\r\ncommittee may decide that the meetings shall not be public. Tribunals\r\nand administrative authorities are obliged to comply with the requests\r\nof these committees, with the view of developing evidence. The files of\r\nthese authorities are, on demand, open to these committees.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag nominates in addition two _permanent committees_. One of\r\nthem is that on Foreign Affairs. Its purpose is to submit the foreign\r\npolicies of the Cabinet to a constant surveillance by the popular\r\nrepresentation. It may after the adjournment of the Reichstag, or when\r\nthe powers of the Reichstag have expired, or after a dissolution of the\r\nReichstag remain in power until the National Assembly has reconvened. Its\r\nmeetings are theoretically not public. However, a majority of two-thirds\r\nmay order that they be such. It has the same powers as an investigating\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nDuring the deliberations on the project of the Constitution, serious\r\nobjections were raised against the institution of the Committee on\r\nForeign Affairs. It was claimed that this committee would in advance\r\nbe an expression of lack of confidence in the Cabinet and as an organ\r\nof surveillance would exercise a particularly troublesome influence on\r\nforeign policies. To this the reply was, that in the countries in which\r\nthere have been appointed committees on foreign affairs there has been no\r\nevidence of unfavorable results. In addition, this committee would not be\r\nin the first instance a committee of surveillance, but an organism which,\r\nin matters of foreign policy would bring the influence of politically\r\nexperienced personalities of the Reichstag to bear on the professional\r\nagencies of the diplomatic service.\r\n\r\nThe second permanent committee provided by the Constitution has as its\r\npurpose the control of the activity of the Cabinet of the Reich when the\r\nReichstag is not in session, between the last meeting of one Reichstag\r\nand the opening of a new one.\r\n\r\nThis committee, which is formed on the model of an institution already in\r\nexistence before the Revolution in the Grand Duchy of Baden, is supposed,\r\nduring the period which the Reichstag is not assembled, to safeguard the\r\nright of popular representation against the Cabinet of the Reich. It\r\nmust see to it in a permanent fashion that administration is conducted\r\nin conformity with laws, with the decisions of the Reichstag, and the\r\nwill of the people. It may not sit except when the Reichstag is not in\r\nsession. It has also the powers of an investigating committee.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution was being discussed, prior to its adoption, this\r\ncommittee, too, was the subject of much lively opposition. Some held\r\nthat the Cabinet, so long as it enjoyed the confidence of the Reichstag,\r\ndid not require a special organ of surveillance. This committee, its\r\nopponents went on, was only an application of the conception that assumed\r\nan opposition between the Cabinet and popular representation. It was\r\nincompatible, therefore, with the principle of parliamentarism that rests\r\non a harmony of the Cabinet and the Parliament. But the majority of\r\nthe National Assembly held, on the contrary, that this committee would\r\ncorrespond fully in character to the Reichstag as an organ of control,\r\nand would be consistent with the confidence and the good will on which\r\nthe Cabinet depends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE REICH\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary system assumes, by the side of the Parliament elected\r\nby the people, a titular chief of state with executive power who,\r\nhimself not responsible politically but assisted by ministers who are\r\nresponsible, co-operates with Parliament in the different functions of\r\nthe state. Basing itself, therefore, on the principle of parliamentary\r\ngovernment, the German Constitution places at the head of the Reich a\r\nPresident whose situation corresponds generally to that of all the chiefs\r\nof state in parliamentary countries. The Constitution also attempts to\r\ncreate within the general framework of the parliamentary system, a new\r\ntype of chief of state. It is important therefore to examine precisely\r\nthe principal characteristics of these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE NEED FOR A STRONG PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nThe dominant idea, which guided the constituent assembly when they\r\ndrew up the provisions relative to the President, was this: the German\r\nparliamentary republic requires that its President shall be powerful.\r\n\r\nThere must be a President. The Independents did not want one. “The\r\nPresident will either take his position strictly within the limits of\r\nthe functions which are his according to the parliamentary principle,”\r\nsaid their spokesman, Haase, “in which case it will be his ministers who\r\nwill exercise his powers. He will thus play a purely ornamental rôle,\r\ntherefore useless and one for which the German Republic cannot afford\r\nto pay. Or he will exceed his legal powers, and the Cabinet will be\r\ncompelled to develop in the direction of a régime of personal autocracy.\r\nIt is enough, for the purpose of government of the country, that there\r\nshould operate a Ministry in harmony with the popular representation.”[39]\r\n\r\nThese ideas had no chance to prevail. In committee Preuss fought them\r\nenergetically. The President, he held, could be replaced in two ways;\r\neither by a directorate elected by the people or by one elected by\r\nParliament. The directorate would itself name its ministers. A Cabinet\r\nthus composed would be doomed to inertia and incapable of making any\r\ndecision would “cry for a Bonaparte.” The Ministers who should be\r\nresponsible to the Parliament would be practically deprived of authority,\r\nand the Parliament, with control only over the Ministers, would itself\r\nbe weakened. The following system could also be considered: Parliament\r\ncould directly elect a college whose members would themselves administer\r\nthe various ministerial departments; that is to say, instead of being\r\nappointed by the President, Ministers would be elected by Parliament.\r\nThis is the Swiss system. But such a Cabinet, admissible in a small\r\ncountry, could not exist in Germany, for the distribution of portfolios\r\ndepends not according to merely logical premises but according to the\r\nrelative strength among the different parties of the Reichstag. There\r\ncould be no unity of direction in a Ministry thus composed. Above all\r\nwhat was needed was a personage who should be in the Constitution a\r\nfirm centre. The more committees there are, and the more elections, the\r\ngreater also becomes the need of having a fixed point to which may be\r\nattached the various strands in the network of the Constitution. There\r\nmust therefore be a President.\r\n\r\nThis President must be powerful. A powerful chief of state is necessary\r\nabove all in Germany, where people like to be governed. This is\r\nparticularly necessary in such a revolutionary period as the Reich is\r\ntraversing. There must be a President who will be a worthy representative\r\nof the nation and who will adequately personify, with all the authority\r\nneeded, a state as considerable as the Reich. The President must be\r\npowerful in order also to act as a balance to the Parliament, which\r\nwithout it might become omnipotent.\r\n\r\nThis is why, first of all, the President of the Reich must not resemble\r\nthe President of the French Republic. The fact that in France the\r\nPresident is elected by the National Assembly engenders a constitutional\r\nsituation full of inconveniences. The President there is only a purely\r\nrepresentative figure, Parliament having acquired absolute omnipotence\r\nwhich is directly contrary to true democracy. The parliamentarism which\r\nGermany wants is a parliamentarism whose mechanism is controlled by the\r\npeople; and not a parliamentarism in which the President is reduced to\r\ncomplete inactivity and has no other care than to remain on the best\r\npossible terms with the Chambers. The members of the Constituent Assembly\r\nin supporting this condemnation--unanimous in Germany--of the French\r\nsystem quoted Professor Redslob, according to whom parliamentarism in\r\nFrance is completely adulterated.[40]\r\n\r\nBut neither must the President of the Reich resemble the President of the\r\nUnited States. True, there were many in Germany at the end of 1918 and\r\nat the beginning of 1919 who wished for a chief of state a man who could\r\nact and represent the Reich with the independence and the authority of a\r\nWilson. But this wish does not seem to have prevailed. The Constituent\r\nAssembly, in any event, wanted to inaugurate in Germany a parliamentary\r\nrégime; whereas in America, the House of Representatives has only\r\nlegislative power and the executive power rests wholly in the hands of\r\nthe President. The Assembly resolved to give the Reichstag the right\r\nto co-operate in executive action and to exercise a control over the\r\nadministration. In addition the President in America himself nominates\r\nhis Cabinet without concern as to whether or not his Secretaries have\r\nthe confidence of the Chamber, to whom they are not responsible. He is\r\ninvested with a dangerous omnipotence, incompatible with parliamentary\r\nrégime. The American system therefore, like the French system, must be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nNone of the forms of existing republican governments were entirely\r\nsuitable for the German Republic; there would have to be created for\r\nits use a new type of chief of state. There would have to be created\r\nfor the first time true parliamentarism, different from the imperfect\r\nparliamentarism such as exists in France. French parliamentarism consists\r\nof the omnipotence of Parliament which for four years acts free of all\r\ncontrol on the part of the people. After each election democracy in\r\nFrance plays no part. In the true parliamentarism, however, Parliament\r\nis not omnipotent; but is subject to a control exercised by a democratic\r\nauthority and this authority must be, in Germany, a President.\r\n\r\nThe problem is therefore to institute in a Republic what now exists only\r\nin parliamentary monarchies, that is, a chief of state sufficiently\r\npowerful to act as a balance to the Parliament and to control the latter\r\nin the name of the people without, however, giving him such a power as,\r\nin abusing it, would enable him to dominate or annihilate the rights of\r\nthe Parliament and to establish an anti-democratic rule. Let us see how\r\nthe German Constitution has solved this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE LENGTH OF HIS TERM.\r\n\r\nTo give the President of the Reich the authority and the independence\r\nwhich it deemed necessary, the National Assembly insured him a very\r\nstrong personal position.\r\n\r\nTo this end the Constitution declares first of all that he shall be\r\nelected by the whole German people (Article 41); that is, the plebiscite.\r\nThe President is elected by the same electors as Parliament itself.\r\nThus, President and Reichstag issue from the same source, the pure\r\npopular will. Thus, there is the certitude that if one of these two\r\norgans rejects the direction desired by the people or deviates from the\r\ndirection desired by the people, the other organ will immediately be able\r\nto apply the necessary corrective. The President can be the sought-for\r\ncounter-balance to the authority of the Reichstag, for he is truly the\r\nman entrusted by the people, delegated by them to rule with the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThis system is not without danger. We have seen it in Germany itself when\r\nin March, 1920, the rumour spread that Marshal Hindenburg would be a\r\ncandidate for the presidency of the Reich, a candidacy expressly approved\r\nby the former Emperor, one which seemed to open the way for a monarchical\r\nrestoration. The Social Democrats thereupon declared that the election\r\nof the President by the whole people was an institution republican\r\nonly in appearance; that it was in reality much more monarchical than\r\nrepublican; that the President elected by the people could arrogate to\r\nhimself a power which would weigh heavily on the functioning of the\r\ngovernmental machinery; that to institute the election of a President by\r\nthe people would subject his person to disputes and attacks which would\r\nleave his dignity seriously compromised. They, the Social Democrats,\r\nforesaw the possibility of supporting again a proposition which they had\r\nalready made during the discussion on the Constitution, but which they\r\nhad withdrawn, according to which the President would have to be elected\r\nby the Reichstag. The Democrats, alarmed by the prospect of a conflict\r\nthat could arise between the Reichstag and a President elected by the\r\npeople, seemed ready to support such a proposition. The Centre abstained\r\nfrom a decision on this matter. But nothing could be done without the\r\nCentre, for since this was a matter of constitutional amendment a\r\nmajority of two-thirds of the National Assembly was indispensable, and it\r\ncould not be obtained without the Centre. The _coup d’état_ of Kapp and\r\nLüttwitz had meanwhile the effect on these discussions now well known.\r\nThe Democrats concluded from it that thereafter all attempts to establish\r\na military candidacy would be doomed to failure and that the people would\r\nnever either nominate or support a dictator; and that therefore there was\r\nno longer any need to change the Constitution on this point.\r\n\r\nEvery German is eligible provided he is thirty-five years old. The\r\nproposal in committee as well as the text of the Constitution at the\r\nsecond reading declared for an absolute ineligibility of members of\r\nfamilies who had ever ruled a state in the German Empire. This provision\r\nwas done away with on the third reading by a majority consisting of the\r\nGerman Nationalists, the People’s Party and the Centre. The motive\r\nexpressed by the representatives of these parties was that this measure\r\nwould constitute a law of exception of the most shameful kind, contrary\r\nto the principles of the Constitution, that it was a confession of\r\nweakness and an avowal of the lack of solidity in the benefits afforded\r\nby the victories of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut how shall the President be elected? After long discussion the\r\nNational Assembly decided that the election of the President should\r\nnot be regulated by the Constitution but that the matter should be\r\nleft to an ordinary law. The Assembly was not able to decide either\r\nfor the proposition of the Cabinet or for that of the Committee on\r\nthe Constitution. The proposal of the Cabinet provided for a general\r\nelection. If in the first canvass no candidate received the majority\r\nof the votes cast, a second one would have to take place in which only\r\nthe two candidates who had received the largest number of votes in the\r\nfirst canvass could run. Of these two candidates the one who obtained the\r\nmajority would be elected.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aroused serious opposition in the Constitutional Committee.\r\nIt was held that, given a multiplicity of political parties, it was\r\nprobable that in the first canvass a great number of candidates would\r\npresent themselves and consequently at the second ballot neither of\r\nthe two surviving candidates would rally to his support any important\r\nfraction of the whole people. On the other hand, it would be difficult\r\nbefore the first vote to effect any union among neighbouring parties on\r\na common candidacy, because up to that moment the various groups would\r\nnot know what possibilities there were for the election of their own\r\ncandidates. In any event the position of the President would be weakened,\r\nfor a great number of those voting for him would not do so primarily out\r\nof sympathy with him, but in order to keep out some other person still\r\nless in their confidence. All the criticisms that were made at another\r\ntime against the balloting under the former electoral law would be\r\napplicable here with added force, since it was a matter of the election\r\nof the personality who must be vested with the highest dignity in the\r\nReich.\r\n\r\nHaving condemned this method of election, the committee adopted the\r\nproposal that seemed to them most opposed to this: that candidate should\r\nbe elected who received on the first ballot the largest number of\r\nvotes (a relative majority). If this system did away with some of the\r\ninconveniences of balloting, there nevertheless could be urged against it\r\nand with greater force the same objection as filed against the preceding\r\nproposition, viz., that, given the division of political parties as it\r\nwas, a man could be called to the head of the nation who would have\r\nbehind him a relatively small fraction of the German population.\r\n\r\nAccording to a third proposition, the second balloting could be avoided\r\nin the following fashion. The elector would be permitted to indicate on\r\nthe first ballot a second person to whom he would give his vote should\r\nhis first candidate not obtain the necessary number of votes. This\r\nproposition had as its point of view the idea that neighbouring groups\r\nor parties could in this way and in advance effect electoral compromises\r\nin the event that none of their candidates alone should survive the\r\nfirst ballot. In this way there would be the advantage that a second\r\nballot would be unnecessary. But this system was not without danger,\r\nfor first of all it lacked simplicity, and again there was nothing to\r\nshow that the electors would thereby abide by the agreements concluded\r\nby their parties. A well disciplined party, in which the electors held\r\nto the agreements made by the chiefs of their party would risk being\r\nput at a disadvantage by this system in relation to a party in which\r\nthere was no discipline whatever. There was the danger in accepting this\r\nproposition that the elections would bring about a result that would not\r\ntruly express the real wish of the people, but which would depend on the\r\ntactics and the more or less effective discipline of the parties.\r\n\r\nNone of these propositions having been accepted only one procedure\r\nremained possible. This was to have two ballots, but not to limit the\r\nsecond ballot to two candidates and to declare elected the candidate\r\nwho has received the largest number of votes. Thus, no group is obliged\r\nto deprive itself of a candidate who might be able to win. But when the\r\ndifferent candidates have measured their strength on the first ballot,\r\nthe parties could then freely come to agreement based on precise results.\r\nNor would it be indispensable that this agreement should be based purely\r\nand simply on the proportion of votes obtained on the first ballot.\r\nParties could agree on a candidate who on the first ballot had not been\r\npresented. It could be hoped that the political situation, being to some\r\ndegree cleared by the first vote, there would be a considerable decrease\r\nin the number of candidates, with the result that the President elected\r\nwould receive the majority of all the votes; or at least that he would\r\nobtain a number of votes much larger than if he were considered elected\r\non the first ballot by a merely relative majority. The vote which a\r\ncandidate would thus obtain would be given him by the free choice of the\r\npopulation; he would be much more the man trusted by the people than he\r\nwould be if a majority of the electors had voted for him constrained by a\r\nballoting procedure. But the doing away with the second ballot could not\r\nbe accomplished without at the same time losing the clearness with which\r\nthe popular will should express itself.\r\n\r\nSuch is the system which was finally adopted as law on the election of\r\nthe President, on March 4, 1920. According to the terms of Article 4\r\nof this law, “The one who has obtained more than half of all the valid\r\nvotes is elected. If no one obtains this majority a second ballot must\r\nbe proceeded to, after which the candidate obtaining a plurality of the\r\nvalid votes shall be considered elected. In case candidates obtain an\r\nequal number of votes election shall be decided by lot.”[41]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President is elected for seven years and is eligible for re-election.\r\nThe choice for so long a term and the possibility of re-election\r\ncorresponded closely to the prevailing idea according to which the\r\nPresident should constitute a fixed and permanent point in the\r\nconstitutional mechanism. “Granting,” said Preuss, “that the institutions\r\nset up by our Constitution should be as profoundly as possible stamped\r\nwith democratic character, it is best, for the solidity of the whole\r\nedifice, that there should be in some part of it a durable and firm\r\nframework.” The Social Democrats observed that the longer the term of\r\nthe President’s powers the more difficult it would be to effect a change\r\nin the person, and consequently the greater was the danger of seeing a\r\nlife President installed. They proposed to fix five years as the term for\r\nwhich the President could remain in power and to make re-election more\r\nthan once impossible. But this proposal was rejected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving fixed the term of the presidential power the Constitution had\r\nto provide for the situation in which a President ceased to function\r\nbefore the normal expiration of his powers or found himself prevented\r\nfrom exercising them. It was not desired, as in the United States,\r\nto institute a Vice-President who, as permanent representative and\r\npossible successor of the President, would have the status, in the words\r\nof Preuss, of a “republican crown-prince.” The provisions which were\r\nthereupon adopted are much more supple.\r\n\r\nIn case the President ceases his functions before their normal\r\nexpiration, that is to say, in case of death, resignation, or\r\nimpeachment, a new election is immediately held.\r\n\r\nIn case he is prevented from filling his duties, there must be made a\r\ndistinction according to whether this inability seems apparently of\r\nshort or long duration. In the first case, that is, in case of slight\r\nillness or because of a short voyage abroad, or during the first days\r\nof a disability which seems likely to be prolonged, or in the interval\r\nbetween the death of a President and the election of his successor,\r\nthe place of the President is filled by the Chancellor. In the second\r\ncase, that is, in case of serious illness or insanity, or when a motion\r\nhas been passed by the Reichstag to impeach the President, or there is\r\ninaugurated a penal prosecution of the President before the National\r\nJudicial Court, the Constitution decides that an ordinary law shall\r\ndetermine expressly by whom his place shall be filled. This law may\r\naccording to circumstances either install a temporary Vice-President, or\r\nconfer temporarily the functions of the President on the Chancellor until\r\nthe President is able to resume office, or finishes his term.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe powers vested in the President of the Reich by the Constitution\r\nare in general analogous to those possessed by every chief of state in\r\na parliamentary country. Just as the Reichstag exercises in addition\r\nto its purely legislative powers a control over the Cabinet and its\r\nadministration, just so, if the principles of the parliamentary system\r\nare to be applied, the President must be invested, in addition to his\r\nstrictly executive authority, with powers that permit him to co-operate\r\nin legislative work and to exercise a control over the Reichstag itself.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this, in effect, that the Constitution provides for. The\r\nPresident of the Reich has executive powers. He nominates ministers, he\r\nrepresents the Reich in foreign relations, he appoints all the civil\r\nand military servants, he is supreme chief of the forces of the Reich\r\nby land and sea, he exercises the right of pardon and he may make\r\nregulations.[42] He has also powers of a legislative character. He alone\r\nhas authority to promulgate and publish enacted laws. He exercises a kind\r\nof right of veto over these laws; and he may, according to circumstances,\r\nin the complicated conditions we have already examined, either retard the\r\nentrance of these laws into operation, or submit them to the people by\r\nmeans of a referendum. Finally, he exercises a certain control over the\r\nReichstag. He may order the President of the Reichstag to convoke that\r\nAssembly earlier than the normal date of its meeting. He nominates the\r\njudicial members of the electoral commission for disputed elections to\r\nthe Reichstag. He may dissolve the Reichstag, etc.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that in none of these cases can the President\r\ntake action without securing the support and the countersignature of a\r\nMinister. That is the essential condition of a parliamentary régime.\r\n\r\nBut to strengthen the action of a President and to give his position a\r\nplace of real pre-eminence, which is desired for him, the Constitution\r\nentrusts him with a certain number of powers, which we must note\r\nparticularly, for they are perhaps peculiar to the German Presidency, and\r\ngive it a special character.\r\n\r\nThe President exercises an extremely powerful control over the\r\nlegislative work of the Reichstag. When a law has been enacted he may,\r\nbefore promulgating it, submit it to a referendum. He may, when the\r\nReichstag and the Reichsrat have declared urgent a law which they have\r\nenacted, promulgate it immediately even if a third of the Reichstag has\r\ndemanded that its promulgation be deferred (Article 72). The aim of\r\nsuch a demand for postponement is to give the opponents of the law the\r\nchance to prepare a referendum and to proceed to it. The fact that the\r\nPresident has the right not to act on such a postponement and to give the\r\nlaw immediate operative power by promulgating it, offers him the chance\r\nto prevent such a referendum. It is also in his right when there is no\r\nagreement between the Reichstag and the Reichsrat on the text of a bill,\r\neither to decide that the law is not in effect and shall not enter into\r\noperation, or to decide for a referendum. He is free, finally, when a law\r\nhas been passed in the Reichstag by a two-thirds majority against the\r\nprotest of the Reichsrat, either to promulgate this law, or, if he does\r\nnot wish to take the responsibility of that, to submit to a referendum\r\nthe question on which the Reichstag and the Reichsrat disagree.\r\n\r\nThe President commands all the armed forces of the Reich. He is from this\r\npoint of view the direct successor of the Emperor. He has, therefore, the\r\npower called _Reichsexecution_; that is to say, that when a state does\r\nnot carry out the obligations imposed upon it by the Constitution or by\r\na law of the Reich, he has the right to compel it to do so with the aid\r\nof armed force. But, above all, he has the right to _declare a state of\r\nsiege_.\r\n\r\nThis is a peculiar point in the German Constitution. Whereas in France,\r\nthe state of siege cannot be declared except by a law, in Germany it is\r\nsufficient to declare it by means of a simple order of the President.\r\nArticle 48 gives him the right, when security and public order are\r\nseriously affected or menaced, to take necessary measures for the\r\nre-establishment of security and public order and at need to use,\r\ntherefore, armed force to that end. But in order that he may be able to\r\nresort to these exceptional measures, tranquillity and public safety\r\nmust be seriously affected or menaced. But he alone has the power to\r\ndecide if and when this condition is fulfilled. In the same way he alone\r\ndecides what measures are necessary for the re-establishment of order.\r\nHe may particularly--the Constitution expressly gives him this right\r\nbut only in a general way--suspend individual liberties. As to details\r\nin this matter the Constitution provided for the passing of an ordinary\r\nlaw which should prescribe particulars more completely; but this law has\r\nnot yet been enacted. It is agreed to recognize that until such a law\r\nhas been passed the _authority of the President in this respect remains\r\nunlimited_. He may therefore not only order all measures which seem to\r\nhim necessary for this or that emergency, but he may also by an ordinance\r\nprescribe general and permanent measures. He may institute penalties or\r\nincrease those provided by the penal code. He may also establish special\r\ntribunals. It is in effect a dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary power which has been given him, the President uses to\r\na very large extent. Germany, it is true, is traversing a particularly\r\ntroubled period and it is probable that this is responsible for the\r\ngreat number of ordinances issued by the President creating states of\r\nsiege. There are regions that are almost constantly in a state of siege,\r\nparticularly the Ruhr. In 1920 Berlin remained in a state of siege from\r\nJanuary 13th to May 28th.\r\n\r\nThe modes of applying these high executive powers are extremely variable\r\nand, according to circumstances, the measures prescribed constitute a\r\nmenace more or less grave to the rights of the individual. In serious\r\nsituations all the authority goes to the Minister of War, who may\r\nexercise them himself or transmit them to his subordinates, and who\r\nis assisted in civil administration by a Commissioner of the Cabinet.\r\nPenalties are enacted; arson, the illegal use of explosives, flooding,\r\ndamage done to railways, and resistance to legal officers in the\r\ncourse of a riot are punishable by death. Extraordinary court-martials\r\nare created and invested with broad authority. The military powers\r\nmay even institute court-martials appointed by the commanders of the\r\ntroops charged with suppressing the disorders and presided over by an\r\nofficer of these troops.[43] In less serious situations the authority\r\nin the territory involved is given over to a commissioner of the civil\r\ngovernment, nominated by the Minister of the Interior. The liberty of\r\nindividuals is suspended, but certain guarantees are retained. Prison\r\nsentences and fines are instituted. Between these two extreme types of\r\nstate of siege there is a whole gamut of provisions more or less severe;\r\nand almost daily new ordinances appear establishing the state of siege in\r\nthis region, sharpening it in another, relaxing here and abolishing it\r\nthere. There are territories declared in a state of siege in which this\r\nabnormal situation is not manifested by a single practical restriction;\r\nit is there only a measure of precaution on the part of the government.\r\nBut there are others where repressions of a terribly brutal nature take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe only limit that the Constitution has provided to this omnipotence of\r\nthe executive power consists in the obligation it places on the President\r\nto acquaint the Reichstag with all the measures he has taken by virtue\r\nof Article 48; and in the right that is given by the Constitution to the\r\nReichstag to demand that he withdraw these measures. It is because of\r\nsuch a demand that the Cabinet was compelled on May 28, 1920, to abolish\r\nthe then state of siege throughout the whole Reich, except in the Ruhr,\r\nto permit the elections of June 6 to be held under normal conditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe parties of the Right, for whom the authority given the President\r\nseems never strong enough, wanted to give him still another power, the\r\nright to prescribe a referendum or to dissolve the Reichstag without a\r\ncountersignature of a Minister. The President, they held, would never\r\nbe able to secure the countersignature of a Minister to a dissolution\r\nof the Reichstag, or to appeal to the people against the Reichstag,\r\nbecause ministers depend for their official lives on the confidence\r\nthe Reichstag reposes in them. It will be necessary in such a case,\r\ntherefore, for the President to form a new ministry to countersign his\r\nordinance. But if the electors of the nation decide against a President,\r\nhe will have to call back to office the former Ministry. Of what use is\r\nthis roundabout method?\r\n\r\nBut Preuss vigorously defended the necessity of the countersignature,\r\ndictated by principles of a republican democracy and of parliamentarism.\r\n\r\nHe began by reviewing the hypothesis of a referendum. In such a\r\nsituation, he said, one of two possibilities occurs. Either the President\r\nand the Minister are in agreement to prescribe a referendum; in which\r\ncase would the Minister refuse his countersignature? That would be\r\ncontrary to the normal relations which must exist between the President\r\nand his Ministry; especially, too, as a referendum is subject to certain\r\nconditions imposed by the Constitution, and these conditions have to\r\nbe observed and some one must take the responsibility in case they\r\nare violated. Or in the other case, the more important, the Ministry\r\nare against the referendum; they are determined not to permit such a\r\npolitically important act to be committed against their best judgment. In\r\nsuch a situation the Ministry will immediately resign and the President,\r\nnot being able to remain without a Ministry, would have to form a new\r\none. Whether or not, therefore, the countersignature of a Minister\r\nto such decrees is required, the situation culminates in a change of\r\nMinistry. But it is more natural that if the President wants to bring\r\nabout an act against the political convictions of his Ministry, he will\r\nseek a Cabinet that will accept the responsibility for this act.\r\n\r\nThe situation is quite analogous in reference to the dissolution of a\r\nReichstag. If the President dissolves the Reichstag and wants to prevail\r\nover its majority he can no longer retain the Ministry supported by this\r\nmajority. Dissolution results from the fact that the President seeks, by\r\na new election, to change the majority to a minority and the minority to\r\na majority. He must therefore ask himself this question. What political\r\ncombination can I use? Such a calculation must be faced if it is not\r\npermitted the President to prescribe a dissolution of the Reichstag\r\nexcept with the countersignature of a Minister. The President is not\r\nabsolutely subject to the majority; he may attempt, in appealing to the\r\npeople, to make another majority of the minority, but in that case he\r\nmust take into this minority statesmen who will accept the responsibility\r\nfor such an attempt.\r\n\r\nThe President may, therefore, order the referendum and dissolve the\r\nReichstag; but these two decisions, like all the others, must be\r\ncountersigned by a Minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the powers we have just examined, all of which are\r\nexpressly provided by the Constitution, there are others which the\r\nPresident possesses because they logically follow from even the practice\r\nof a parliamentary régime. Certainly he has the right to demand reports\r\nfrom Ministers and any information from them on the course of affairs. He\r\nhas the right also to be present at sessions of the Cabinet; and while\r\nit is true that he has not the right to vote there, he may come there\r\nwhenever he pleases and take the chair.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nResponsibility engenders authority and there is no authority without\r\nresponsibility. Whatever powers a Constitution may give its chief of\r\nstate, they will rest a dead letter if he cannot personally assume\r\nthe responsibility for the exercise of these powers. The President of\r\nthe United States, who is thus held responsible, really governs. In\r\na parliamentary régime the chief of state is not responsible; thence\r\ncomes its weakness. But the German Constitution desires at once a\r\nparliamentary régime and a strong presidency. It must therefore seek a\r\nground for the combination of the two.\r\n\r\n(1) _Politically_ the President of the Reich is in theory not\r\nresponsible. That is to say, that he cannot be overthrown by vote of\r\nlack of confidence on the part of the Reichstag. All his acts must\r\nbe countersigned by a Minister, and it is the latter who takes the\r\nresponsibility for them and who alone suffers the consequences.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a limit to this political irresponsibility of the\r\nPresident. If the conflict between the President and the Reichstag is\r\nreally irreconcilable he may submit the conflict to the people, who\r\ndecide. It is recalled to this effect that, according to Article 42, the\r\nReichstag by a decision taken by a majority of two-thirds may demand of\r\nthe people a vote on the impeachment of the President. If the people\r\napprove, the President ceases his functions; therein operates a kind of\r\npolitical responsibility of the President.\r\n\r\n(2) The President of the Reich is criminally responsible. Two hypotheses\r\nmust be considered:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The President may have committed some crime for which the ordinary\r\npenal law prescribes punishment. Can he be prosecuted before ordinary\r\ntribunals as an ordinary individual? This question was vigorously debated\r\nbefore the Committee on the Constitution. It was not desired that the\r\nPresident should be absolved from all criminal responsibility. But, on\r\nthe other hand, it was equally undesirable that he should be placed in\r\nthe same status as ordinary citizens, because this would give him a\r\nposition less favorable than that which the Constitution grants members\r\nof the Reichstag. It was decided finally that, like the latter, he cannot\r\nbe criminally prosecuted during the term of his powers, except with the\r\nauthorization of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Or the President may be guilty of a violation of the Constitution\r\nor a law of the Reich. In this case Article 59 provides that he may\r\nbe prosecuted by the Reichstag in the Supreme Judicial Court. The\r\nproposal to bring an impeachment must be signed by at least one hundred\r\nmembers and supported by a two-thirds majority. But it must be specified\r\nhere that this is a matter of legal procedure and that therefore this\r\nprosecution can be based only on the violation of a definite provision\r\nof the Constitution or of a law. In the case of a simple political\r\ndivergence of opinion between the Reichstag and the President, only the\r\npolitical responsibility for the matter can be called into the question,\r\nand the one way open to the Reichstag is that of an impeachment approved\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\nWhat penalty can the Supreme Judicial Court pronounce against the\r\nPresident in case of a verdict of guilty? The Constituent Assembly at\r\nfirst adopted a provision according to which the Court could simply\r\ndeclare the President removed, or to declare him incapable of exercising\r\nany public function whatever. Finally, however, it was decided to leave\r\nthis question to the law organizing the Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nBut the situation may arise in which an act committed by the President\r\nconstitutes both an infraction of the penal law as well as a violation of\r\nthe Constitution. Which shall pass first upon this, the ordinary tribunal\r\nor the Supreme Judicial Court? After long hesitation, the Constituent\r\nAssembly decided to leave this question also to the future law dealing\r\nwith the Supreme Judicial Court.\r\n\r\n(3) The President is finally _civilly_ responsible for any acts of damage\r\nhe may commit. Although he is not really a civil servant, in the actual\r\nsense of the word, he is on this point subject to the same regulations\r\nas the civil servants of the Reich. (The law on the responsibilities of\r\ncivil servants, March 22, 1910.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET OF THE REICH\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet in a parliamentary government constitutes a bond of union\r\nbetween the parliament and the chief of state. In Germany it must play\r\na still more important rôle, since both the Reichstag and the President\r\nare directly elected by the people and have theoretically the same equal\r\npowers. It is therefore indispensable that an organism of co-operation\r\nand equilibrium exist between them.\r\n\r\nBut this mechanism is extremely delicate. The rôle of the Ministry,\r\nalways very complex, depends above all on the traditions and the\r\ncircumstances of the men in question. What relations should subsist\r\nbetween the President and the Prime Minister; between the Prime Minister\r\nand the other members of the Cabinet; and in what measure should one be\r\nsubordinated to the others? What is the exact position of the Cabinet\r\nin regard to the Chamber? Is it its guide, or must it be limited to the\r\nexecution of the Chamber’s decisions? These are questions of degree that\r\nrequire or may require different solutions in each country for each\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to decide on these in advance in a\r\ncomplete and detailed manner. In England there is no written provision on\r\nthe manner in which the mechanism of the Cabinet must function. In France\r\nthere are a few vague and insufficient provisions in the Constitution.\r\nBut the German Constitution has attempted to formulate the general rules\r\naccording to which the government of the Cabinet should operate.\r\n\r\nThe project by Preuss contained not a single detail on this point; it\r\nconfined itself to stating the principle of parliamentary government.\r\nAgainst this reserve criticisms were raised in committee as well as in\r\nplenary sessions of the Assembly. Former Minister von Delbrück criticized\r\nPreuss’ project for its lack of a sufficient guarantee that the organism\r\nof the government would develop in a specific manner and in the direction\r\ndesired for it. He held that the evolution of an organism as important as\r\nthe Ministry should not be left to chance, and that there must be fixed\r\nat least the general lines according to which it should develop. He then\r\nindicated some of these directing principles and they were incorporated\r\nin the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly has certainly made therein an important attempt and\r\nwe shall study the regulations which it has thus established. We shall\r\nthen examine how these regulations work out in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE CHANCELLOR AND THE MINISTERS ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nIn the terminology of Weimar, the Ministry is called the “National\r\nCabinet.” Article 52 says, “The National Cabinet consists of the\r\nNational Chancellor and the National Ministers.” There is thus stated a\r\ndifference--fundamental in the German system--between the Chancellor and\r\nthe Ministers.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled how the Cabinet of the old Empire was organized. The\r\nChancellor, properly speaking, was the only Minister; and the Secretaries\r\nof State, by whom he was assisted or represented, were simply high civil\r\nservants absolutely subordinate to the Chancellor. These Secretaries\r\nof State never met together to deliberate on public affairs; each of\r\nthem freely decided on the affairs of his department and executed them.\r\nBut the Secretaries of State had to refer to the Chancellor every time\r\nthat a difference of opinion arose between their departments over\r\nany contemplated law or any administrative measure whatever. Such a\r\ndiscussion was often prolonged for months, because the Chancellor was\r\nnot in a situation to express an opinion, nor to pronounce on the very\r\ncomplex problem. This was the _bureaucratic_ system.\r\n\r\nFor this system, with its obvious inconveniences, von Delbrück proposed\r\nto substitute a _collegiate_ one. The Ministers form a Cabinet, to which\r\nall questions concerning general policy or involving the province of\r\ntheir several departments are submitted. The Prime Minister is only the\r\nfirst among them, _primus inter pares_; the decision is made by the\r\nwhole Cabinet, which naturally assumes the whole burden of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly supported an intermediate solution, which\r\npartook both of the bureaucratic system and the collegiate. It adopted a\r\nsort of _limited collegiate_ system. The Chancellor is not as formerly\r\nthe only Minister of the Reich; he is Minister by the same title as the\r\nother members of the Cabinet, but he has a character distinct from those\r\nof the other Ministers. Without being a hierarchic superior over these he\r\nis on another plane and enjoys certain rights in comparison to the others.\r\n\r\nThis distinction established by the Constituent Assembly, between the\r\ntwo elements of the government, the Chancellor on the one hand and the\r\nMinisters on the other, is manifested in the three respects in the\r\nnomination of the ministers, their prerogatives and their responsibility.\r\n\r\n(1) They are nominated in a different manner. The Chancellor is nominated\r\nby the President of the Reich who naturally must be guided therein by the\r\npolitical situation. According to circumstances, the President is obliged\r\nto nominate some party leader of the group forming the majority of the\r\nReichstag; or his choice may be exercised among several political figures\r\naccording to the combination possible among the parties of the majority.\r\nIt is true that the Ministers are also appointed by the President of\r\nthe Reich, but _on the nomination by the Chancellor_, and it seems\r\nthat in practice the President is always bound by this consideration.\r\nThe Chancellor may not be recalled; his functions cease only through\r\nresignation or because he is unseated by the majority of the Reichstag.\r\nThe Ministers, on the other hand, may be recalled and the decision may\r\nbe taken here, too, by the President of the Reich on the proposal by the\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\n(2) In regard to powers there exists a still more profound difference\r\nbetween the Chancellor and the Ministers. The principle is this: the\r\nChancellor determines and alone determines the general course of the\r\nCabinet’s policy. The other Ministers direct the affairs of their\r\nrespective departments along the lines fixed by the Chancellor in his\r\ngeneral policy. (Article 56.) In other words, it seems that the German\r\nConstitution, without expressly saying so, wants to establish the classic\r\ndistinction between “governing” and “administering.” The Chancellor\r\ngoverns, the other members of the Cabinet administer. This essential\r\ndistinction recurs more or less clearly enunciated in all the provisions\r\nrelative to the powers of the Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe latter have as their most important function the exercise of those\r\npowers of which the President of the Reich is the chief holder. They\r\nprepare and countersign the ordinances of the President. But do they\r\nall indiscriminately countersign all decrees and may each Minister\r\ncountersign any of the decisions of the President? Not in the least. The\r\nChancellor countersigns all decisions touching the general policy of the\r\nCabinet, but he is also authorized to sign other decrees. The Ministers\r\ncountersign only the decrees that effect their respective departments.\r\nFrom this results the following: When a decree of the President is\r\ncountersigned by a Minister it may be considered that the Cabinet holds\r\nit to be a purely administrative matter. Every decision presenting a\r\ncertain political importance is either countersigned by the Chancellor\r\nonly or by both the Chancellor and the Minister whose department is\r\naffected. The Ministers have in the second place their own powers. They\r\nmake general or individual decisions which they sign themselves. These\r\ndecisions are of two kinds: some of them must be deliberated on and\r\ndecreed in the Council of Ministers; other decisions are taken by the\r\nMinisters individually.\r\n\r\nThere are above all powers which the Ministers exercise in the Council\r\nof Ministers, and it is here that the mixed character of the regulations\r\nprovided by the Constitution is revealed still more clearly. The\r\npredominant position accorded the Chancellor comes from the fact that he\r\npresides over the Council of Ministers--when the President of the Reich\r\nis not present; and the fact that in case of a tie he decides. It may\r\nbe asked if the Chancellor can be put in the minority and what would\r\nresult from such a situation. Theoretically, according to the _collegiate\r\nprinciple_, a decision adopted by the majority must always be executed.\r\nBut it seems that the Ministry cannot go against the opinion of the\r\nChancellor, who alone has the right to fix the general lines of policy\r\nand who in addition can always exercise the threat of resigning, which\r\nwould thereby involve the fall of the whole Ministry. The Council of\r\nMinisters has its own order of procedure which must be approved by the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the collegiate system is found to be very widely\r\napplied in the ensemble of the provisions vesting in the Council of\r\nMinisters some of the most important powers that properly belong to\r\nMinisters. The Chancellor fixes the general course of the policy to be\r\npursued by the government; but the Ministers must see to it that in\r\ntheir various departments the policies practised conform to this general\r\ncourse, as well as that their individual policies do not conflict with\r\nthe interests or the policies of other departments. Also the Constitution\r\nitself enumerates a certain number of matters which cannot be dealt with\r\nexcept in the Council of Ministers; and it provides that ordinary laws\r\nmay extend the number and character of these matters. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) All projects of law. In contrast to what occurs in France,\r\n    it is not the chief of state who has the initiative in laws but\r\n    the Council of Ministers. All projects of laws emanating from\r\n    the Cabinet must be discussed and drawn up in the Council before\r\n    being sent to the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n    (2) All matters that touch the domains of the authority of the\r\n    various Ministers, and on which the latter cannot privately come\r\n    to an agreement.\r\n\r\n    (3) The power to issue ordinances. In Germany there is no organ\r\n    that has general authority to make all ordinances. A particular\r\n    organ can only prescribe ordinances within its own limits and\r\n    to the end assigned to it by the Constitution or ordinary laws.\r\n    We have seen that such is the case for the President; and such\r\n    is also the case for the Cabinet. The Cabinet of the Reich may\r\n    prescribe regulations of three kinds:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Sometimes the Cabinet of the Reich has authority to\r\n    prescribe _only_ a regulation. This is particularly the case\r\n    when it has to prescribe administrative measures of the general\r\n    character necessary for the execution of a law. (Article 77.)\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Sometimes the Cabinet cannot prescribe a regulation except\r\n    with the _approval of the Reichsrat_. This is particularly the\r\n    case in the circumstances aimed at in Articles 88, 91, 77, par. 2\r\n    of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Finally, the law of April 17, 1919, “On a simplified\r\n    form of legislation relative to economy during the period of\r\n    transition,” gives to the Cabinet of the Reich the power under\r\n    certain conditions to enact by means of decrees what amount to\r\n    veritable laws. According to this law, the Cabinet may prescribe\r\n    regulations having the force of law, and consequently may even\r\n    modify laws previously made on condition that it has the _consent\r\n    of the Reichsrat and of a committee of twenty-eight members named\r\n    by the National Assembly_. The Ministers finally have powers\r\n    which they exercise individually. They are in theory purely\r\n    administrative powers.\r\n\r\n(3) The distinction established by the Constitution between the\r\nChancellor and the Ministers recurs in the matter of their political\r\nresponsibility. Their rôles being different, it is logical that their\r\nresponsibility operate under different conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor and the Ministers are equally responsible before the\r\nReichstag. They “require for the administration of their offices the\r\nconfidence of the National Assembly. Each of them must resign if the\r\nNational Assembly by formal resolution withdraws its confidence,” says\r\nArticle 54. To follow the letter of this article it may be believed that\r\nthere is not a collective responsibility and that only those Ministers\r\nmust resign against whom a vote of want of confidence is passed. However,\r\nthat does not seem to be the real meaning of Article 54. This becomes\r\nmore clear when one compares it with Article 56. These two articles\r\ntogether indicate the following. The Chancellor and the Ministers are\r\nresponsible to the Reichstag in the same way, but the provinces of their\r\nresponsibilities are different. The Chancellor is responsible for the\r\ngeneral course of policies, that is to say, for principles and plans\r\nof great scope, to the exclusion of administrative measures. On the\r\nother hand, the Ministers are responsible not for the general course of\r\npolicies but for the manner in which they direct their departments. In\r\naddition the political responsibility of all the Ministers is involved in\r\ndecisions taken by them in the Council.\r\n\r\nAs for criminal and civil responsibility the Chancellor and the Minister\r\nare placed on the same footing, and are answerable for criminal and civil\r\noffences under the same conditions as the President of the Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE WORKING OF CONSTITUTIONAL RULES; HOW A MINISTRY IS FORMED, WORKS,\r\nAND IS DISSOLVED.\r\n\r\nIt is observed that the Constitution has attempted a kind of codification\r\nof rules for a parliamentary régime, such as its authors have conceived\r\nit. It attempts to give thus a guarantee that this régime, new in\r\nGermany, will develop along the fixed course it has traced for it. It is\r\ninteresting to inquire how up to now German statesmen have observed these\r\nrules. To this end it seems that the best thing to do is to describe how\r\na Ministry actually is formed, works and is dissolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Normally, and it must be so according to the German Constitution,\r\nwhen it is a matter of forming a new Ministry, the chief of state charges\r\nsome political leader with the task of constituting a Cabinet and\r\nassuming the direction of its affairs. This man chooses collaborators\r\nwith whom he agrees or can come to an agreement to the effect that\r\nthey work in common for the realization of a specific programme. The\r\nMinistry thus formed is submitted to the Parliament and presents to it\r\nits programme. If the Parliament accepts, the Ministry goes to work.\r\nOtherwise it is withdrawn. In any event a ministerial crisis resolves\r\nitself in a few days.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the formation of a Ministry is always an extremely complicated\r\naffair. Instead of only two great parties--which seems the ideal\r\ncondition or at any rate the traditional situation in the normal\r\nfunctioning of a parliamentary régime--there are in Germany five or six\r\nparties, none of which consists of a sufficient number of members to\r\nhave in itself a majority. In addition the Cabinet’s difficulties are\r\nalmost inextricable and the party that accepts a part in the ruling power\r\nrealizes the risk it immediately incurs in exercising it. Likewise the\r\ndifferent parties do not always lend themselves with good grace to this\r\nrisk and often prefer the egoistic attitude and the convenient rôle of an\r\nopposition rather than the heavy and perilous task of governing. Whereas\r\nany political party worthy of the name should have an excellent programme\r\nin which it believes and should want nothing better than to come into\r\npower in order to realize such a programme, the political parties in\r\nGermany, little sure of their programmes, prefer, before attempting to\r\napply them, to wait until the insufficiency of the programmes of the\r\nother parties has been previously demonstrated.\r\n\r\nWhen a ministerial crisis opens there commences at the same time a period\r\nof difficult negotiations. Each political group meets and discusses\r\nthe position it will take, deciding whether or not it will accept\r\nparticipation in the Cabinet. The answer to this latter question depends\r\nmost often upon whether certain other groups will participate themselves\r\nin power. Then the trusted men or the leaders of the different parties\r\nmeet together to find a basis for agreement. The President of the Reich\r\nnaturally keeps in touch with these negotiations; sometimes they are held\r\nin his presence. The programme of the future Cabinet is discussed and\r\nabove all the choice of future Ministers. When an agreement is reached\r\nthe President of the Reich makes his nominations. There was one occasion,\r\nhowever, when the task of forming the Cabinet was extremely difficult.\r\nIt was after the elections of June 6, 1920, which gave to the various\r\nparties such a distribution of numerical strength that no majority was\r\npractically possible no matter what combination was tried. The various\r\ngroups met and quarrelled but were not able to come to agreement. Then\r\nthe President charged a member of the Centre, not to make up a Cabinet,\r\nbut to serve as an intermediary between the various parties and to bring\r\nthem to an agreement. It is from this preparation that there issued the\r\nMinistry of Fehrenbach. _Thus the Cabinet is constituted not by an act,\r\na free decision of the President, but by an agreement reached by the\r\nparties._\r\n\r\nFrom this ensue two consequences:\r\n\r\nFirst, these crises are very long. The one in which the Fehrenbach\r\nCabinet was formed lasted nineteen days. In a country whose situation is\r\nas difficult in every respect as that of Germany, such a lapse of time\r\nwithout a Cabinet, entirely taken up in deliberations and discussions\r\nbetween politicians, is obviously a deplorable state of affairs.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence is, that not only the Ministries are not homogeneous,\r\nwhich is the necessary consequence of the fact that no party has a\r\nmajority in the Reichstag, but also they are heterogeneous in a fixed\r\nand invariable manner. To constitute a Cabinet there must be observed a\r\ntriple rule. First, Ministers must be taken from the various political\r\nparties that enter the Cabinet; those individuals who are not members\r\nof the Reichstag being chosen from among the members of the party\r\nrepresented in the National Assembly. _Secondly, each party has the right\r\nto a number of Ministers proportional to the number of its members in\r\nthe Reichstag._ The only exception to this rule is that the number of\r\nmembers in a Cabinet belonging to the same party must remain the same\r\nas in the just discarded Ministry; and if a Minister is withdrawn, the\r\nparty to which he belongs designates his successor. If because of special\r\ncircumstances another political group is called upon to fill the vacancy,\r\nthis group in return as compensation to the other group cedes one of the\r\nministerial seats held by it. Thirdly, the composition of a Ministry must\r\nremain unchanged for the whole session of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe first Ministry constituted after the meeting of the Constituent\r\nAssembly in February, 1919, consisted of Scheidemann, its President,\r\neleven members as department chiefs and three Ministers without\r\nportfolio. The parties that assumed government in coalition were, the\r\nSocial Democrats, who had 163 members in the Assembly, the Democrats\r\nwith 74 members, and the Centre with 89. The Social Democrats had\r\nexactly as many as the other two groups combined. In the Cabinet of\r\nfourteen members, therefore, they had seven seats, among them that of\r\nthe President. The other seats were distributed, four to the Democrats\r\nand three to the Centre. During the entire period of the Constituent\r\nAssembly--with the exception of three months of the Summer of 1919, when\r\nthe Democrats, who did not want to sign the treaty of peace, remained\r\nvoluntarily aloof--the Ministry and the Ministers could change, but\r\nthe composition of the Ministry rested practically identical. The last\r\nCabinet formed under this Assembly, that of Hermann Müller, comprised\r\nat the time of its constitution, March, 1920, eleven Ministers, of whom\r\none was without portfolio. And it was understood that it would later\r\nbe completed by the addition of three other Ministers then not yet\r\ndesignated. Among the eleven members at first, there were five Social\r\nDemocrats, three Democrats and three members of the Centre. As for the\r\nfirst Ministry constituted after the elections of 1920, that consisted\r\nof five members of the Centre, among them Fehrenbach, three members of\r\nthe People’s Party and two Democrats; which corresponded approximately to\r\nthe respective strengths of the groups in the Reichstag, viz., 68, 62, 45\r\nmembers.[45]\r\n\r\nGenerally the number of Ministers is variable. Instead of having a\r\nfixed number of departments corresponding to a rational distribution of\r\naffairs, there are created or abolished Ministries according to the needs\r\nthat have to be met to satisfy the demands of this or that political\r\ngroup. The Scheidemann Ministry had a Minister of Finance. But the Bauer,\r\nHermann Müller, and the Fehrenbach Ministries had, in addition to a\r\nMinister of Finance, also a Minister of the Treasury. On the other hand,\r\nthere was in the Scheidemann Cabinet a Minister of Economy, Wissel, and a\r\nMinister of Food Supply, Robert Schmidt. These two Ministers kept their\r\nportfolios in Bauer’s Cabinet formed in June, 1919. Then dissensions\r\narising between Wissel and the other members of the Cabinet, Wissel\r\nresigned. But he was not replaced and the two Cabinet posts were made\r\none. They were again made two, however, and provided with distinct titles\r\nin the Cabinets of Hermann Müller and Fehrenbach. A similar situation\r\nexists in the case of Ministers without portfolio, whose number, when\r\nthere are any, is variable.\r\n\r\nSometimes in spite of all possible negotiations and combinations the\r\nvarious groups necessary for a coalition commanding a majority cannot\r\narrive at an agreement. As a government must nevertheless be finally\r\nconstituted, this or that group, which has refused to enter into the\r\ncombination, promises nevertheless either its support or its neutrality\r\nto those who have had the imprudence to participate in the Cabinet. When\r\nthe Fehrenbach Cabinet was constituted it could only count on the vote\r\nof the groups represented in it and, therefore, commanded only 200 votes\r\nin an Assembly of 466 members. But the Social Democrats promised not\r\nto overthrow the Ministry until the new elections. The consequence of\r\nthis is that a Cabinet so placed is really not its own master, and this\r\none had to yield to a certain degree to the injunctions of the Social\r\nDemocrats. But on the other hand the latter, although they had refused to\r\nenter the combination, were indirectly responsible for the acts of the\r\nMinistry so long as they tolerated them in power.\r\n\r\nWhen the necessary agreements are concluded, the Ministry appears\r\nbefore the Reichstag. It reads its declaration and programme and a\r\ngrand political discussion commences. But the programme having been in\r\nadvance submitted to the groups, sometimes even corrected and redrawn\r\nat inter-group meetings, the Ministry is sure of a majority and the\r\ndiscourses are only manifestos by which each party explains why it is for\r\nor against the Ministry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) Parliamentary government, in practice, may take one of two different\r\nforms: government by the Cabinet or government by the Assembly. In a\r\ngovernment by a Cabinet, it is the Council of Ministers that governs and\r\nit is they who give the direction of general policy. It is the guide\r\nand the superior of the Assembly whose confidence supports it. On the\r\nother hand, one calls it government by the Assembly when the Ministry is\r\nlimited to executing the decisions of the Parliament and to following the\r\ninitiative of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, while it cannot be said that the Reichstag exercises\r\nconsiderable authority over them, it seems that the Ministers take little\r\ninitiative and that they content themselves most often with following\r\nthe direction given them by the Assembly. It is the agreement that\r\nprevailed at the formation of the Cabinet that continues as a policy. The\r\nMinisters are either the presidents of the respective political groups,\r\nor else have been nominated by these groups. How, therefore, can they be\r\ncompletely independent? There are here some factors analogous to what one\r\ncalled in France “the bloc of the Left” under Minister Combes. All the\r\nimportant measures are first discussed between the government and the\r\ngroups and the Ministry does not act except in agreement with the groups\r\nof the majority. Instead of placing itself at the head of the majority\r\nand assuming the responsibility for the measures which it feels necessary\r\nto take, the Cabinet comes to an understanding with it. Perhaps it cannot\r\nbe said that it follows the directions given it by the majority. But it\r\ndoes not act, in any event, unless it is first assured of the majority’s\r\nsupport. Perhaps, also, in the critical circumstances which Germany is\r\ntraversing and given the manner in which its groups are organized, it is\r\nimpossible to do otherwise. The head of a Cabinet appointed by the chief\r\nof the executive power on a programme given him for the realization of\r\nthis programme, may act with independence, if this programme creates its\r\nown majority. Even if it cannot command a stable majority, it can lean on\r\nsome of the minority groups and, according to circumstances, may create\r\ndifferent majorities. There are acts which no one can criticize and there\r\nare successes which nullify opposition. But such is not the case in\r\nGermany, where the Ministry has to abide by the contract which prevailed\r\nat its organization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(3) The preceding remarks suffice to explain the following fact: since\r\nthe establishment of the parliamentary régime in Germany _no Ministry has\r\never been overturned_ by the Reichstag. How can it be, if it conforms to\r\nthe condition of its agreement and if, before each hazardous decision, it\r\nassures itself the approval of the majority? On the other hand, if it\r\ncannot obtain this approval, or if it does not want to accept the policy\r\ndesired by the majority groups, why should it go before the Assembly and\r\nengage in a battle lost in advance? It resigns.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry, therefore, is never overthrown; it retreats, or more\r\ncorrectly, it does not retreat, but changes. The number of men available\r\nfor a Ministry is very limited and the groups present almost always\r\nthe same men. There is in advance a certain knowledge as to who the\r\nmen are who will enter a Cabinet as soon as one knows what groups will\r\nparticipate in the formation. Further, the possibilities of combinations\r\nwithin a given Chamber are limited enough. From the beginning of\r\nFebruary, 1919, only four groups have participated in power, of these\r\nthe People’s Party participated only after June, 1920. It is inevitable,\r\ntherefore, that in each new combination there remain at least two groups\r\nwhich already belonged to the preceding one. Quite naturally these groups\r\nleave, without exception, the same men in power. Why change? An important\r\npart of the preceding Ministry, therefore, is maintained in each new\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1919, Scheidemann’s Cabinet, which consisted of Social\r\nDemocrats, Democrats and members of the Centre, was replaced by Bauer’s\r\nCabinet, in which only the Centre and the Social Democrats entered.\r\nThe members of these two groups which were in the Scheidemann Cabinet\r\nremained in the Bauer Cabinet and it was sufficient to replace with\r\nmembers of these two groups the vacancies left by Scheidemann and the\r\nDemocrats. In March, 1920, Bauer’s Cabinet, into which the Democrats\r\nentered in October, 1919, attempted a new change after the _coup d’état_\r\nof Kapp. Conferences took place, in which took part the President of\r\nthe Reich, the Ministers and representatives of parties, in which was\r\ndiscussed the question as to which Ministers should remain and which must\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nThe more the discussion was prolonged, the greater grew the number\r\nof Ministers to remain. But the unions intervened and demanded the\r\nresignation of the whole Cabinet. Bauer acceded. Nevertheless the\r\nCabinet, which was thereupon constituted by Hermann Müller, retained\r\nseveral members of the preceding Cabinet, notably Hermann Müller himself,\r\nwho from Minister of Foreign Affairs became Chancellor, and Bauer, who\r\nfrom Chancellor became Minister of the Treasury. The same procedure took\r\nplace in the constitution of the Fehrenbach Cabinet. It was expected that\r\na Ministry coming after elections that expressed a considerable change\r\nin the political situation, and after the Social Democrats withdrew from\r\npower and the People’s Party arrived, would translate this change by a\r\nmore profound modification than usual of the Cabinet. But out of thirteen\r\nmembers five had been members of the preceding Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem, therefore, that the attempt made by the Constitution to\r\nregulate as precisely as it may be done the functioning of the government\r\nof the Cabinet has had up to now any appreciable effect on the practice\r\nof parliamentarism. Germany begins at a point that other countries,\r\nin which parliamentary government has operated for years, have hardly\r\nattained, if they have at all attained it. A concentrated Cabinet, a\r\nCabinet of republican defence, a Cabinet of transition, a _bloc_ of the\r\nCentre--are these accidental deformities of the parliamentary régime,\r\nor are they forms toward which it must necessarily tend? We are told\r\nin Germany that these practices, obviously little compatible with the\r\nconception of parliamentarism or with the regulations provided in their\r\nConstitution, are to be explained by the state of revolution in which\r\nthe country still finds itself; and that they will disappear if some\r\nday Germany recovers its equilibrium, and make place for a correct and\r\ncomplete application of constitutional rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\nTHE REICHSRAT\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat is placed by the Constitution by the side of the Reichstag,\r\nthe President and the Cabinet, and has as its rôle the representation,\r\nafter these, of the States of the Reich in legislative and administrative\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--GENERAL FEATURES OF THE REICHSRAT.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat constitutes a bond of co-operation between the Reich and\r\nthe States. Whereas the will of the whole German people taken together\r\nis manifested through the Reichstag, the Reichsrat translates the will\r\nof the States, such as it is conceived by the governments or cabinets of\r\nthese States.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat is the representative in the Reich of the federalist\r\nprinciple. It is the federalist organ of the Reich. In this rôle it joins\r\nthe unitary organs and completes them.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat is the successor of the Commission of States of the\r\nProvisional Constitution and of the Bundesrat of the old Constitution.\r\nBut as the unitary idea made important progress, the Reichstag\r\nwas endowed with powers considerably less extensive than those\r\nof the Bundesrat. The latter, which represented the confederated\r\ngovernments collectively, was the holder of sovereignty under the\r\nEmpire. The Reichsrat, on the other hand, since the new Constitution\r\nplaced sovereignty in the German people, is only an organ by which\r\nthe governments of the states participate in the legislative and\r\nadministrative powers of the Reich. Instead of being endowed, as compared\r\nto the Reichstag, with powers equal or superior to it, as the former\r\nBundesrat was, it has received but very limited rights.\r\n\r\nThe question whether it would not have been better to organize instead\r\nof the Reichsrat a Chamber of States, which would represent, not the\r\nvarious cabinets, but the populations of the states, was vigorously\r\ndebated. It may be recalled that it was this solution Preuss proposed:\r\na Chamber of States composed of delegates of German republics. These\r\ndelegates would be elected by the Diets of the republics and would be\r\nselected from among the citizens of these republics. In principle, each\r\nstate would have a delegate for each million inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSuch an organism would constitute a very characteristic application of\r\nthe centralist idea. But it was thought that this would create, by the\r\nside of the Reichstag, a new popular representation, and that this would\r\nnot take into account the necessity of organizing a representation of\r\nstates. What was needed actually was the creation of an organ, within\r\nwhich would be realized an equilibrium between the voices and the needs\r\nof the Reich on the one hand and the voices and the needs of the states\r\non the other; if it was not wished to suppress completely the federal\r\nstructure of the Reich and make of it simply a unitary state. This\r\norganism would have to include technical and vocational representatives\r\nof the interests of the states, leaving aside the idea of parties and\r\nall the programmes of parties. That is to say, there would have to be\r\nrepresentatives of the governments of the states, not merely political\r\nrepresentatives. The National Assembly decided on a Reichsrat organized\r\non the model of the former Bundesrat, representing the governments of the\r\nstates and endowed with less extensive powers.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat differs profoundly as to authority from the old Bundesrat.\r\nIt has lost completely the sovereign character of the Bundesrat. It has\r\nnot even the right to issue administrative regulations, this right having\r\nbeen taken away from it and given to the Cabinet. It has ceased to be, in\r\ncomparison with the Reichstag, a legislative organ invested with rights\r\nequal to those of the Reichstag; and it has no more than a very limited\r\nright to co-operate with it in legislative work.\r\n\r\nThis institution, therefore, comprehends both historic tradition and the\r\nactual situation of the Reich. But it marks at the same time a progress\r\nin the sense of a stronger unity of the Reich, and it should in the\r\nfuture facilitate a new development of the unitary idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE COMPOSITION AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE REICHSRAT.\r\n\r\n“In the National Council each State has at least one vote. In the case of\r\nthe larger States one vote is accorded for every million inhabitants. Any\r\nexcess equal at least to the population of the smallest State is reckoned\r\nas equivalent to a full million. No State shall be accredited with more\r\nthan two-fifths of all votes.” (Article 61.)\r\n\r\nThe original proposal provided that three years after the Constitution\r\nhad entered into effect, small States having less than a million\r\ninhabitants would lose their right to be represented in the Reichsrat.\r\nThe obvious purpose of this provision was to compel, by indirect means,\r\nthe small States to join together, as well as to prevent the unnecessary\r\nparcelling out of territories with the view of creating new States. This\r\nmeasure, however, was not accepted by the committee. We know that in\r\nits place the committee and the National Assembly accepted a resolution\r\ninviting the government to interpose in the hope of realizing a union of\r\nsmall States.[46]\r\n\r\nAn early distribution of seats, after the adoption of the Constitution,\r\non the basis of Article 61, gave to Prussia twenty-five votes out of the\r\ntotal of sixty-three in the Reichsrat. But, as we know, after May, 1920,\r\nseven small states of Central Germany formed the State of Thuringia,\r\nwhich had 1,584,324 inhabitants and was entitled to two votes. By this\r\nthe number of non-Prussian votes in the Reichsrat was reduced by five,\r\nwhich also diminished the number of votes coming from Prussia from its\r\nformer twenty-five to twenty-two. So long as no new changes in the\r\ninterior geographic configuration of the Reich are made, the distribution\r\nof votes in the Reichsrat will be as follows: Prussia, twenty-two;\r\nBavaria, seven; Saxony, five; Wurtemberg, three; Baden, three; Hesse,\r\ntwo; Thuringia, two; other States, one each. Total, fifty-five.\r\n\r\nThe States are represented by members of their Cabinets. So it was under\r\nthe old régime. There is, however, an essential difference, for the\r\nCabinets now depend on the confidence in them of the Diets elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage. It is public opinion that governs in the States now\r\nand no longer the will of an autocratic government, independent of this\r\nopinion. The government of a state is responsible before the Diet for\r\nthe manner in which its representatives exercise their mandates in the\r\nReichsrat, whether the members of the Cabinet are themselves present\r\nthere or whether they are represented by civil servants. The former\r\nprovisions relating to instructions given by Cabinets of States to their\r\nplenipotentiaries in the Reichsrat, as well as measures to insure that\r\nthe representatives of each state shall join in a common vote, have\r\nbecome useless and have not been incorporated into the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe provision according to which the states are all represented by\r\ntheir Cabinets has been changed, however, in one respect. Article 63\r\nspecifies that only half of the Prussian votes will be at the disposal\r\nof the Prussian Cabinet, the other half being at the disposal of the\r\nPrussian provincial administrations. Thus the National Assembly, which\r\nhas not had the force to effect directly a dismemberment of the Prussian\r\nstate, and which has deferred for over two years every effort to be made\r\ntoward this end, has nevertheless attempted to anticipate this reform.\r\nIt seems in effect that if the Prussian provinces receive progressively\r\nmore and more autonomy, if the powers granted to them become comparable\r\nto the more and more diminishing powers of the states, the assimilation\r\nof these provinces to states other than Prussia will be facilitated and\r\nhastened by the fact that these provinces, like states, are directly\r\nrepresented in the Reichsrat. Each of them will be able to defend its own\r\nparticular interest, different, perhaps, from those of other provinces.\r\nEach province, above all, will be able to defend its rights and make its\r\ninterests prevail when in conflict with those of the Prussian State,\r\nwhose dominant centralization will thus be broken.\r\n\r\nThis solution is not entirely satisfactory, for the regrouping which must\r\nbe proceeded to in the Reich must be inspired above all by social and\r\neconomic considerations. And it must have as its aim the creation of an\r\nautonomous body capable of self-development and productivity. Above all\r\nin this work, the historic frontiers of the States must be disregarded\r\nsince these frontiers have been drawn to satisfy dynastic interests or to\r\nconclude victorious wars. What is true of the interior of the Reich is\r\nalso true of Prussia. The Prussian provinces are not natural organisms in\r\nwhose interests there should be created and developed a political life.\r\n\r\nStill, Article 63, for lack of other provision, constitutes progress,\r\nwhich, however, does not seem as yet to be near realization. This Article\r\nprovides, in effect, that the manner in which Prussian votes at the\r\ndisposal of the provinces shall be distributed must be regulated by a\r\nPrussian State Law; and Article 168 provides that until the adoption of\r\nthis law but, at the most for only a year, all the Prussian votes in the\r\nReichsrat may be cast by members of the State Cabinet. This law should\r\nalready have been adopted and applied. This has not been done, however,\r\nand the Prussian government has asked and obtained a modification of\r\nArticle 168, which prolongs the delay accorded to Prussia and gives\r\nit till July 1, 1921, to pass this law. In support of this request\r\nPrussia claimed that the reduction of its total number of votes in the\r\nReichsrat to twenty-two made the distribution of this number among the\r\nprovinces more difficult. In reality, however, the Prussian government\r\nunder the Republic remains true to its traditional tactics, which\r\nconsist in opposing all development and progress by means of the most\r\nobstinate passivity. Until the new state of representation is adopted the\r\ntwenty-two Prussian votes will be cast by the members of the Prussian\r\nCabinet or by delegates named by it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat has the right to create its own committees.[47] But the\r\nprivileges which certain states, particularly Prussia, enjoyed in the\r\ncommittees of the old Bundesrat are suppressed; particularly as no state\r\nmay hereafter have more than one vote on any committee. (Article 62.)\r\nThe Reichsrat, in contrast to the Reichstag, has not the right freely to\r\nconvene. It must be convoked by the Cabinet of the Reich. Nevertheless,\r\nit has a right to convoke itself if the demand is made by a third of\r\nits members. It is the Cabinet that presides over the Reichsrat and\r\nits committees; but the Cabinet has not the right to vote in either of\r\nthese. The Reichsrat has the right and the power to demand that the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet be present at its meetings or at the meetings of\r\nits committees. It may invite there the Chancellor and the Ministers and\r\nthe latter are obliged to attend. Those invited have the right at all\r\ntimes to be heard in the deliberations. By this means the Reichsrat has\r\nthe possibility of participating in the policies of the Reich. It is\r\ntrue that no fixed influence is guaranteed to it by the Constitution.\r\nWhat authority it will be able to exercise in the future will depend on\r\nthe quality of its work and on the personalities by which the states\r\nwill be represented. The Cabinet of the Reich, like all the members of\r\nthe Reichsrat, is authorized to propose measures in the Reichsrat. The\r\nplenary sessions of the latter, in contrast to those of the Bundesrat,\r\nare theoretically public; its committee meetings are not. Decisions are\r\nmade by a simple majority of those voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--POWERS OF THE REICHSRAT.\r\n\r\nThe former Bundesrat was an organ which had in legislative matters\r\nthe same rights as the Reichstag. It exercised in addition important\r\nexecutive functions; in particular it had the right to promulgate general\r\nadministrative regulations for executing the laws of the Reich. It was\r\nthe central administrative authority in matters relating to customs\r\nand taxes. It decided conflicts of a constitutional character as well\r\nas miscarriages of justice. Of all these powers few have descended to\r\nthe Reichsrat. In order to emphasize the idea of the unity of the Reich\r\nand of the sovereignty of the whole German people in the Reich, the new\r\nConstitution limits to a considerable extent the powers of the Reichsrat.\r\nHowever, it has left it a certain right to participate in the making of\r\nlaws and in the exercise of executive power.\r\n\r\nIn legislative matters, it will be recalled, that all proposals of\r\nlaws on the part of the Cabinet must be presented at first to the\r\nReichsrat; in theory, must be accepted by it before being submitted to\r\nthe Reichstag. But as we know this consent is not indispensable and the\r\ngovernment may disregard it. It will be recalled also that the Reichsrat\r\nhas the right to protest against any law voted by the Reichstag; but that\r\nit may have its protest disregarded under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nAlready the Reichsrat has made use of its right of protest. That was\r\ndone in connection with a bill that raised postal taxes. The National\r\nAssembly, acting in the character of the Reichstag, had voted a provision\r\naccording to the terms of which the sending by mail of official documents\r\nwould have to be paid for, no longer by him who received them, but\r\nby the sender. The representatives of Prussia, Bavaria and of Saxony\r\ncriticized in the Reichsrat this measure, and found support in the\r\nAssembly to the extent of a majority of thirty-eight votes. Whereupon\r\nthe Reichsrat raised a protest against this measure, April 29, 1920.\r\nThe bill then returned to the National Assembly; but the conflict ended\r\nwith a compromise, without recourse to the procedure provided by the\r\nConstitution for such a case.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsrat still possesses some executive powers. On the one hand, the\r\nConstitution and the law frequently stipulate that a regulation by the\r\nCabinet of the Reich must be authorized by the Reichsrat. On the other\r\nhand, the law of April 17, 1919, “for a simplified form of legislation\r\non economic matters” provides that regulations decreed by the Cabinet in\r\nthis matter must be approved both by the Reichsrat and by a committee of\r\ntwenty-eight members of the Assembly. The Reichsrat and the Committee\r\nhave in this case absolutely equal rights. Finally Article 67 provides\r\nthat the Reichsrat must be kept informed by the national departments of\r\nthe conduct of national business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF GERMANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part of the Constitution of Weimar is devoted entirely to the\r\nfundamental rights and duties of Germans. It is the Declaration of Rights\r\nof the new Germany. Aside from several articles relating exclusively to\r\nthe economic organization of the Reich, the five sections of this part\r\ncontain a long enumeration of the rights and duties granted to or imposed\r\non the Germans. To enter into details of this enumeration would be to\r\nundertake a study of all of German public and private law. Nevertheless\r\nan attempt must be made to outline the principal ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--LEGAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES.\r\n\r\nThe articles relative to fundamental rights and duties, during the\r\ndiscussion of the draft of the Constitution, were the subjects of lively\r\ndifferences of opinion. It was questioned whether it was necessary and\r\nuseful to insert such provisions into the Constitution; moreover, every\r\none of these provisions one after another was debated. The Bismarckian\r\nConstitution of 1871 contains no declaration of rights. On the other\r\nhand, the drafters of the Constitution of 1849 proposed such a great\r\nnumber of fundamental rights and applied themselves with such complacence\r\nto the elaboration of these rights that the Constituent Assembly of\r\nthat time was unable to make itself heeded, and this defeat contributed\r\nlargely to the defeat of the whole of the project of such rights.\r\n\r\nThe first proposal of the Cabinet following the tradition of the proposal\r\nof 1849 and also the Declaration of Rights of the French Revolution, as\r\nwell as of the American, Belgian and Prussian Constitutions, enumerated\r\nin a few paragraphs several essential legal principles and enunciated\r\nsome fundamental dogmas which have been considered for a century and in\r\nall civilized countries as self-evident truths. But in the Constitutional\r\nCommittee the discussion went far beyond these generalities. Desirous of\r\ncreating an intellectual background in which justice and administration\r\nwould have to operate, desiring also to furnish in the form of some\r\nsuggestive maxims a guide for the conduct of some of the most important\r\nmatters in the legal domain, and to furnish a solid foundation for the\r\njuridical culture of the German people, the members of the Constitutional\r\nCommittee nominated a sub-committee, which prepared a new draft whose\r\nprovisions were embodied in the draft of the Cabinet, in different bills\r\nprepared on private initiative, as well as in the new Constitutions of\r\nBaden and Wurtemberg. In the drawing up of this new draft the principal\r\nrôle was played by Beyerle, member of the Centre.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussions in sub-committee, in Committee, as\r\nwell as in plenary session, three currents appeared. Some wanted to\r\nsuppress drastically all declarations of rights in the Constitution of\r\nthe Reich; for they saw in these principles no stable system, but only\r\na collection of “declarations and declamations,” to which were joined\r\nsome legal maxims figuring already in other laws. Others wanted to\r\nretain the system embodied in the cabinet draft, adding to it, however,\r\nseveral provisions to assure the protection of the rights acquired for\r\nreligious denominations. A third group, among whom principally was\r\nFrederick Naumann, held that the cabinet draft, even thus extended, was\r\nretrogression and did not correspond to the actual development of German\r\nculture. They demanded that there be substituted for it a declaration of\r\nfundamental rights which would constitute a recognition of the principal\r\nideas that characterize the most recent development of this culture.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Committee, and after it the National Assembly itself,\r\nadopted a middle course. The propositions by Naumann as a whole were\r\nrejected; and it was decided not to inscribe in the Constitution, in\r\npolitical sentences and aphorisms without any legal content, a complete\r\nand solemn recognition of the directing ideas of the present and of\r\nthe future. Nevertheless there would be inserted in the Constitution a\r\ncertain number of political maxims and of “programme thoughts.” This\r\ndone, the Constituent Assembly wished, in the words of Düringer, to give\r\na foundation to the existing legal culture, and to furnish a mirror\r\nto German juridical life, and at the same time afford a programme for\r\nfuture juridical development. In addition the principles voted, since\r\nthey would figure in the text of the Constitution, would have to be\r\nplaced under the express guarantee of the Constitution and thus become\r\npart of the fundamental law of the Reich. The Assembly hoped, finally,\r\nthat these articles would exercise a certain educational function. They\r\nwould constitute the basis of the civic and political education of the\r\npeople. The fundamental rights would have to be not only “the keystone of\r\nthe edifice, but must also become the substance whereby the Constitution\r\nwould live.”\r\n\r\nThis was a magnificent programme; unfortunately it was difficult to\r\ncarry it out and the most severe criticisms were rightly, it seems, made\r\nagainst the manner in which it was carried out.\r\n\r\nWhen the articles relating to the fundamental rights and duties were\r\nbeing drawn up, the members of the National Assembly of necessity\r\nremained party men, and were guided, even when they voted on\r\nphilosophico-legal questions, by party considerations. Also some of these\r\n“fundamental rights” had the appearance of being simply extracts from\r\nprogrammes or brochures of political parties. On the other hand, the\r\nmembers who drew them up naturally put in the foreground the problems\r\nwhich, at the time of the discussions, were the burning questions in both\r\nParliament and in public opinion. The result is that the second part\r\nof the Constitution regulates questions of the day rather than of the\r\nfuture, and issues prescriptions for circumstances more than it proclaims\r\nfundamental rights.\r\n\r\nHowever, all this would have been admissible, if there had been one\r\nbig party that could have without constraint and without difficulty\r\nincorporated its own principles in the Constitution; or even if there\r\nhad been two or more parties with fairly similar conceptions, which were\r\nable to agree on fundamental rights. There would have been at least a\r\nDeclaration of Rights that might have corresponded to the conceptions of\r\nthe majority. But there was no such majority in the National Assembly.\r\nTo be sure, there was an impressive majority that agreed on a democratic\r\nConstitution. But on questions of schools, church, the family, and of\r\neconomic and agrarian reforms--questions that had to be dealt with in\r\nthe statement of fundamental rights--there was in the National Assembly\r\nand in the parties of the majority such divergence of opinion that it\r\nwas impossible to construct of it any logical or coherent edifice. Also,\r\nin reading each provision of the fundamental rights, one can guess which\r\nparty has furnished the first part of a phrase and which the second.\r\nWhen, for example, referring to property one reads, “The right of\r\nproperty is guaranteed by the Constitution. Its nature and limits are\r\ndefined by law”; or, when in Article 152 a phrase declares, “There is\r\nan economic liberty in the measure indicated by the law,” every one, no\r\nmatter what may be his personal conceptions, may find himself entirely\r\nsatisfied, according to whether the first or the last words of each\r\nprovision are emphasized. This evident compromise between the political\r\nparties on political conceptions so widely divergent was emphatically\r\npointed out by Member of the Assembly Koch, who characterized the\r\nfundamental rights as “an interfractional political programme.”[48]\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the defects of this programme are no less\r\nserious. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know what\r\nauthority and what meaning should be attached to the fundamental rights.\r\nWhat precisely does such a phrase as one in Article 109 mean? “Privileges\r\nor discriminations due to birth or rank and recognized by law are\r\nabolished.” Does, again, the provision in Article 115, according to which\r\n“The house of every German is his sanctuary and is inviolable,” prevent\r\na commissioner of buildings from dividing spacious lodgings in order to\r\ncombat a housing crisis?\r\n\r\nWhat is still more regrettable is that the Constitution never specifies\r\nto what extent the fundamental rights have or have not legal force. Do\r\nall previously enacted laws that are irreconcilable with fundamental\r\nrights in the Constitution cease to operate the moment the Constitution\r\ncomes into force? Should not this solution be applicable only to laws\r\nenacted after the adoption of the Constitution and for such of their\r\nprovisions as are contrary to the Constitution? Or must it be interpreted\r\nthat the fundamental rights have no importance other than to constrain\r\nlegislatures to subject existing legislation to the principles these\r\nrights proclaim, and to vote only for laws that conform to these\r\nprinciples? Finally, are not these fundamental rights merely general\r\nindications which may be expected to have such moral force as they can\r\nimpose on the legislature?\r\n\r\nIt was attempted to bring some clarity into the chaos of the discussions\r\non this head. At first a proposal was made according to which any one had\r\nthe right to complain before a tribunal of all injurious violations of\r\nfundamental rights. This was rejected; for otherwise any one belonging\r\nto the middle classes could complain on the basis of the provision of\r\nArticle 164, according to which “The independent … middle-class shall\r\nbe fostered,” and claim that the provision was a dead letter. There was\r\nvoted, however, on the first reading a provision according to which\r\nthe fundamental rights would constitute “a course and a limitation for\r\nlegislation, administration, and jurisprudence in the Reich and in\r\nthe States.” This phrase would have increased, without any possible\r\nambiguity, the immediate legal efficacy of the fundamental rights. It\r\nwas, however, done away with at the second reading, for it would not have\r\nbeen applicable except to provisions which have a positive content, and\r\nit would have had, aside from this, only the character of an abstract\r\nmaxim for scholastic manuals. It was decided, therefore, not to specify\r\nin any way whatever the legal significance of the articles of the\r\nConstitution relating to fundamental rights and duties. It would fall\r\nto legislators, judges and public officers to interpret in the future\r\neach of these articles separately, and to be guided according to the\r\nresults of this interpretation. If, however, one may attempt such an\r\ninterpretation, it would appear that these articles, from the point of\r\nview of their legal efficacy, may be divided into three categories.\r\n\r\n(1) Those having the force of law. These create actually and immediately\r\nsome new law, and consequently abrogate contradictory provisions of\r\nantecedent laws. Such, for example, is Article 109, par. 6: “No German\r\nmay accept a title or order from a foreign Government.”\r\n\r\n(2) Others limit themselves to _indicating_ to legislators of the Reich\r\nand of the States the _course which they must in the future follow_\r\nand prescribe the laws they must enact. But these provisions do not in\r\nthemselves constitute laws, and, therefore, cannot abrogate _ipso facto_,\r\ncontradictory provisions in antecedent laws. Such is the principle in\r\nArticle 145, according to which “Instruction and school supplies … are\r\nfree.” This cannot have for its effect the immediate doing away with\r\npayments by pupils in the schools for supplies furnished them. There\r\nis no doubt that the principle of gratuity cannot enter into operation\r\nexcept through a special law expressly prescribed.\r\n\r\n(3) Other provisions express _general truths_, which are most often\r\n_ordinary philosophico-legal commonplaces_, whose exact meaning and\r\nbearing in a text such as the Constitution is difficult to grasp. For\r\nexample, it is hard to see the special significance which a phrase can\r\nhave in a constitutional document such as the one which declares that\r\nmarriage is placed under the special protection of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever diverse may be the conceptions that prevailed at the drawing up\r\nof the fundamental rights, and whatever uncertainty they may present from\r\nthe legal point of view, it is possible, nevertheless, when the whole of\r\nthe second part of the Constitution of Weimar is surveyed, to discover in\r\nthese articles some common characteristics and to unfold the fundamental\r\nideas that have inspired the majority of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Assembly conceived the fundamental rights and\r\nduties in a manner quite different from that of the authors of preceding\r\nDeclarations of Rights in America, France, or even in Germany. These\r\ndeclarations were inspired by purely individualistic doctrine. Man is by\r\nnature free and independent; he holds rights that are limited only by\r\nsuch other rights as will assure to other men the enjoyment of the same\r\nrights as his. From this ensues a twofold consequence. First, he may act\r\nin his own right provided that he confines himself within the limits of\r\nthe right in question. Within these rights he is truly sovereign, and the\r\nstate may not encroach on them to impose any obligation whatsoever. On\r\nthe other hand, conversely, the state does not owe any positive service\r\nor pledge to the profit of the individual. It must abstain from all\r\ninterference and allow him free individual activities. The State owes\r\nnothing to the individual, who in turn can claim nothing from it.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine does not appear in the new German Constitution. The\r\nAssembly at Weimar has substituted for it a conception by virtue of\r\nwhich man, while still, it is true, enjoying a certain number of\r\nindividual prerogatives, nevertheless _must place them at the service\r\nof the collectivity_. In whatever concerns liberty properly so-called,\r\nproperty, the means of production, the intellectual development of man,\r\nthere is found everywhere this dominant idea of the social function of\r\nman. Individual liberties are no longer an end in themselves, nor do\r\nthey constitute any longer an independent good. _They are limited and\r\nconditioned by the duty of the individual to co-operate in the well-being\r\nand the development of the collectivity._ They have no value and are not\r\nprotected except in the measure that they serve for the accomplishment of\r\nthis social duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution commences by enumerating as completely as possible\r\nindividual liberties such as traditionally figure in most declarations of\r\nrights. Not a single one of them is left out, and there have been even\r\nothers added: equality, at least in theory, of men and women; protection\r\nof minorities; the right to secrecy in telegraphic and telephonic\r\ncommunication; liberty of opinion extended to manifestations of thought\r\nby means of motion picture films, etc.\r\n\r\nOne may, therefore, apply for the Germans the classic table of individual\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nFirst, the civil equality. The suppression of privileges of birth or of\r\nclass. Titles of nobility have no other value except as a part of a name.\r\nTitles may not be conferred except as they designate an employment or a\r\nfunction. The state may no longer confer orders or honorary insignia and\r\nno German may accept a title or order from a foreign government.\r\n\r\nThen come the individual liberties properly so-called; not only the right\r\nto come and go, but also the right to settle in any part of the Reich,\r\nto emigrate to any non-German country, to be protected from surrender to\r\na foreign government for prosecution or punishment; guarantee against\r\narbitrary arrests, imprisonment, and other penalties; the inviolability\r\nof domicile and correspondence.\r\n\r\nIn a third place, the right to freedom of activity; liberty to engage in\r\nwork, commerce and industry; liberty of creed and conscience; liberty to\r\npractise religion; liberty of instruction; liberty to express publicly\r\none’s thoughts by words, speeches, printed matter, figures, films and in\r\nany other manner; liberty of assembly and association.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place the liberty of individual property. This cannot be\r\nexpropriated except for the common good, by virtue of a legislative\r\nprovision and must be indemnified.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of rights and duties is complete, but the idea that\r\nprevailed at its adoption is different from that which inspired the\r\nauthors of preceding Declarations of Rights. In recognizing the liberties\r\nof the individual, the object is no longer to protect him against the\r\nState, but to permit him to co-operate in the most effective fashion in\r\nthe well-being of all.\r\n\r\nThis leads naturally to the imposition on the liberty of the individual\r\nof a certain number of restrictions hitherto unknown. On the other hand,\r\nit imposes on the state a certain number of new duties, the discharge of\r\nwhich affords, as corollaries, new rights to the individual.\r\n\r\nI.--INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN NEW RESTRICTIONS IN THE\r\nINTERESTS OF THE COLLECTIVITY.--The individual is no longer merely\r\nentitled to work. _It is his duty._ This obligation is provided for by\r\nArticle 1, par. 1, of the socialization law of March 23, 1919, which\r\nhas become Article 163, par. 1, of the Constitution. “Every German has,\r\nwithout prejudice to his personal liberty, the moral duty so to use his\r\nintellectual and physical powers as is demanded by the welfare of the\r\ncommunity.”[49]\r\n\r\nIt is true, therefore, that personal liberty is conditioned. The draft\r\nof the socialization law submitted by the Cabinet did not contain these\r\nconditions, and the Social Democratic Minister, Wissel, in open session\r\nof the National Assembly, expressly rejected the principle of the liberty\r\nof the individual. In the same manner the Social Democrats and the\r\nIndependents proposed amendments according to which the sole liberty\r\nguaranteed to the individual was that of choosing his profession; this\r\none right availed of, the liberty of the individual was thereupon used\r\nup, and he must thereafter conduct himself exclusively according to the\r\nneeds of community. But a coalition of all the representatives of the\r\nbourgeois parties organizing against the conceptions behind the Socialist\r\nproposal, the provision concerning the principle of the liberty of\r\nemployment was introduced into the law of March 23, 1919, and into the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nSaving his personal liberty, therefore, every German also has work as\r\nhis moral duty; that is to say, he should contribute all the economic\r\nwork that he is capable of according to his physical and intellectual\r\nabilities. In addition, this work must correspond to a definite\r\ncondition; it must be such as is “demanded by the welfare of the\r\ncommunity.”\r\n\r\nIn Germany many see in this provision a central point of the law and\r\nhold that it constitutes as a real transition from the old world to the\r\nnew. Formerly every German could, under the protection of the law, so\r\ndispose of his work that it served only his selfish ends. Without regard\r\nto the interests of his fellow citizens or those of the community,\r\nhe could, provided that he observed the outer forms of the law, so\r\nto speak, “walk over dead bodies” without violating a single legal\r\nprovision. In a general way and aside from insignificant exceptions,\r\nthere reigned in the century of economic liberalism an unlimited egoism\r\nof the individual, protected by the adage _qui jure suo utitur, nemine\r\nlædit_. The socialization law radically changed this state of affairs.\r\nHereafter every German is obliged, for the well-being of the whole German\r\npeople, to furnish all the productive labor of which he is capable, and\r\nmust abstain from all action liable to hinder this well-being. It is only\r\nwithin these limits that economic egoism may hereafter move.\r\n\r\nHowever, this novel duty to work is as yet only a “moral duty.” These\r\nwords, which were not found in the original draft by the Cabinet, were\r\nadded by the Constitutional Committee; and the Independents tried, but\r\nin vain, to have them omitted. It does not seem, however, that the\r\nmajority which has adopted them, has ever given them a clear, unequivocal\r\nmeaning. One thing is clear, however; the law wished to distinguish\r\nbetween a moral duty and a positive legal obligation, whose execution\r\ncan be expressly compelled. But it is perhaps possible to interpret\r\nthis provision in such a way that the violation of the duty to work may\r\ninvolve legal consequences, which can have as a result the right on the\r\npart of the state to exercise indirect constraint on the individual who\r\ndoes not carry out his duty. The German who does not work, or who lets\r\nhimself be dominated in his work by purely selfish ends, has no longer\r\nthe right to demand protection of the laws; he cannot demand that his\r\nwork shall be protected by the Reich. Perhaps one may even go so far as\r\nto appeal to the article of the Civil Code, according to which all legal\r\nprocedure that violates good morals is null;[50] and hold it applicable\r\nto acts and contracts that do not correspond to the moral duty imposed\r\nby the socialization law and by the Constitution. In the same way perhaps\r\nalso Article 826 of the Civil Code may be applied, according to which any\r\none who in a manner contrary to good morals deliberately causes damage\r\nto others is obliged to repair this damage; and it may be argued that an\r\nact or contract inspired by a selfish end falls under the provision of\r\nthis law and brings about in such a case an obligation to compensate the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nBeing obliged to work, is the individual at least master of the product\r\nof his toil? May he dispose of his property as he wishes? No longer. As\r\nwith his work, the _individual must place his property at the service of\r\nthe community_. And the same idea that has resulted in the restriction of\r\nhis liberty to work now leads to a corresponding restriction of his right\r\nover property; “Property rights imply property duties.” (Article 153.)\r\nThese restrictions are several kinds.\r\n\r\nFirst, that of _expropriation_. It is true that this was already admitted\r\nin individualist doctrine. But this doctrine hemmed the right of\r\nexpropriation on the part of the state within narrow limits, inasmuch as\r\nit prescribed strictly the cases in which the state could use this right,\r\nand provided always the payment of a just and, usually, a previously\r\nascertained indemnity. These two guarantees given to property owners are\r\nstrikingly diminished in the new German constitutional law. On the one\r\nhand, it is true the principle is retained that expropriation must not\r\nbe resorted to except for the welfare of the community. But this notion\r\nof general welfare has been particularly elastic. Thus in Article 155\r\nthe State is permitted to expropriate in cases of housing crises, in the\r\ninterests of settlement and reclamation of land, or in the improvement\r\nof agriculture. Thus the Socialization Law and after it the Constitution\r\nin Article 156 permit the state to transfer to public ownership private\r\nbusiness enterprises adapted for socialization. On the other hand, the\r\nprinciple of a just indemnity seems to have been retained. However,\r\nthere is but one case in which indemnity is imposed and guaranteed by\r\nthe Constitution; it is that where the Reich expropriates “the property\r\nof the States, municipalities, and associations of public utility.”\r\nIn all other cases the restriction provided in Article 153 applies;\r\nexpropriation takes place with indemnity “in so far as is not otherwise\r\nprovided by national law.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to expropriation, the Constitution provides other\r\nrestrictions on the right of property:\r\n\r\nLand owners are under the _obligation to cultivate it and utilize it_.\r\nHowever, there is no provision made in case this duty is not carried out.\r\n\r\n_The right of inheritance is guaranteed_, but the State has the right to\r\ntake part of the inheritance according to provisions determined by the\r\nlaws of the Reich, in particular fiscal laws.\r\n\r\n_An increase in the value of land_ arising without the application of\r\nlabour or capital to the property accrues to the benefit of the community\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\n_Entailments_ are dissolved. This provision is an obligatory prescription\r\nimposed on the legislatures of the States, which obliges them to put an\r\nend to entailments, for this matter is given over by the Civil Code to\r\nthe rights of States. By entailments is understood the legal institution\r\nby which a patrimony, particularly holdings of land, because of the\r\nlimitation of the right to sell and the establishment of a certain\r\nsuccession provided by a testament, creates for the owning family in the\r\nperson of the holder of the entail an economic position of security and\r\nthereby of increased advantage. These entails often go back considerably\r\nin time, but they are very frequent in Germany, to such an extent that\r\nland holdings subject to this legislation comprise, for example, in\r\nPrussia about seven per cent of all the landed properties, with about\r\ntwo and a half million hectares. In certain sections entailed property\r\nrepresents about twenty-two per cent of the whole agricultural service.\r\nFor a long time now it has been questioned whether this institution,\r\nwhich tends to the concentration of more and more land into fewer and\r\nfewer hands, should not be abrogated. It is argued in particular against\r\nthe entails that the community cannot allow a mere decision taken by the\r\nprivate will of a proprietor to be perpetuated; that entails have an\r\nunfavourable effect on the distribution of land and that they finally\r\ntend to wipe out the small and the average property. It follows of itself\r\nthat with the victory of the democratic idea and in an epoch in which the\r\ntendency is to divide each piece of land as far as possible, entailments\r\nmust be dissolved. In leaving to the States the legislation on this\r\ndissolution, the Constitution has only applied logically the democratic\r\nprinciples on which it rests.[51]\r\n\r\nII.--IN TURN THE STATE IS OBLIGED TO FULFIL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DUTIES TO\r\nTHE BENEFIT OF INDIVIDUALS.--The classic individualist doctrine limits\r\nthe rights of the State but does not impose upon it any positive service,\r\nno obligation to the benefit of its citizens. The State must abstain from\r\ncertain interferences, but the individual may claim no more than that\r\nof it. German constitutional law, however, adopts another conception,\r\nand while it restrains individual rights for the benefit of a community,\r\nit also imposes upon the latter obligations to the profit of the\r\nindividual. From this there arise to the profit of the latter new rights\r\ncorresponding to the restrictions to which he is subject.\r\n\r\nThe individual owes the duty of working, but the State owes him the\r\nchance to work, must protect his work and according to circumstances must\r\nfurnish him with the necessities of life. From this is derived for the\r\nindividual the right to work, the right to the protection of his work and\r\nthe right of subsistence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The State must furnish work to the individual._ This obligation explains\r\nitself very easily. When the individual is left free to use his labour as\r\nhe pleases, that is to say, when he is free to work exclusively in the\r\ninterests of purely selfish ends, he must also be left the right to look\r\nfor such work and to dispose of his labour where and how he pleases. The\r\ncommunity disassociates itself from a work in which it is not directly a\r\nbeneficiary or from which it may even suffer. But if it demands of the\r\nindividual that he devote himself only to such labour as will benefit the\r\nwhole of the nation, and if it forbids him, therefore, a certain number\r\nof occupations which benefit only the individual, it is indispensable\r\nthat it take measures to guarantee him sufficient remunerative work.\r\nArticle 163, par. 2, provides therefore: “Every German shall have the\r\nopportunity to earn his living by economic labour.”\r\n\r\nOf what exactly consists this duty on the part of the State? It is\r\ncertainly not a legal obligation that gives the individual the right\r\nto demand before a tribunal the execution of this promise. It is a\r\npromise that the Constitution makes and which it sufficiently fulfils if\r\nthe Reich institutes a general system to make known all the available\r\npossibilities for work. An individual may ask only what kind of work is\r\navailable and what opportunity there is of securing it. The proposal\r\nof the Socialization Law provided that every German shall receive work\r\ncorresponding to his powers. The final text of this law, like that of the\r\ntext of the Constitution, limits itself to prescribing that every German\r\nmust be given the opportunity to earn his living by economic labour,\r\nthat is to say, by labour that produces goods, utilizing to the utmost\r\nthe available conditions of work. In addition, the compensation to the\r\nindividual must be sufficient for a livelihood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The State in addition protects labour._ The Socialization Law\r\ndeclares that the power of labour is the most precious economic good\r\nand it imposes on the Reich the legal obligation to protect it. The\r\nConstitution of Weimar applies in Article 157 the terms of the law of\r\nMarch 23, with the exception of the words, “the most precious economic\r\ngood.” But the Constitution also extends and organizes in outline the\r\nduty of the State in this respect. It amplifies this duty in expressly\r\nspecifying in its Article 158 that intellectual labour also is under the\r\nspecial protection of the Reich. As to the measures for the protection of\r\nlabour, some of them come under domestic law, others under international\r\nlaw. Within the Reich itself the Constitution prescribes the creation of\r\nuniform labour legislation. In addition it guarantees to every individual\r\nand to every vocation the liberty of organization for the defence and\r\nthe development of the conditions of labour and of economic life, and\r\nit accords to each employé and laborer the free time necessary for the\r\nexercise of the civil duties and free public functions that may be given\r\nto him. Finally, it promises a complete system of social insurance to\r\nbe established for the maintenance of health and standards in labour.\r\nIn international relation, the Constitution imposes on the Reich the\r\nobligation to protect abroad the products of German science, art and\r\ntechnique, and to strive for the establishment of an international\r\nregulation of the legal status of workers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Finally the State must provide for the needs of individuals out\r\nof work_; and this obligation logically results from the principle\r\nthat inspires all of this part of the Constitution. Since the Reich\r\nimposes on every German the obligation to work only for the good of\r\nthe community, it must see to it--apart from any humanitarian or\r\nfinancial considerations--that every German’s capacity for labour shall\r\nbe maintained as long and at as high a standard as possible. That is\r\nwhy, not content with merely protecting this capacity of labour, the\r\nSocialization Law and the Constitution provide that every German must\r\nreceive what is necessary for his livelihood, to the extent that a\r\npossibility of adequate employment cannot be assured to him (Article 163).\r\n\r\nThe draft of the Socialization Law provided as a condition to this duty\r\non the part of the State that the individual shall not have been able to\r\nfind employment. The final text of the law which the Constitution also\r\nuses provides only that such opportunity for employment shall not have\r\nbeen offered.\r\n\r\nThe burden of the proof is thus reversed from the general rule and an\r\nattitude purely passive on the part of the individual in this respect is\r\nsufficient to entitle him to public succour. On the other hand, it is not\r\nsufficient for the discharge of all such obligations on the part of the\r\nState if it merely offers the individual any employment whatsoever. For\r\nit does not serve the community in any way, as the most interested party,\r\nwhen an individual is employed in work for which he is not fitted. The\r\ncommunity, therefore, must procure work corresponding to the mental and\r\nphysical powers of the individual and to his capacity. If the State does\r\nnot succeed in doing so, it is obliged to furnish him a livelihood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo put into operation the principles thus enunciated by the Constitution,\r\ndifferent laws are necessary--a law on the offer of employment, a law\r\nprotecting labour, a law on the help to be given to the unemployed. Such\r\nlaws have not yet been enacted. However, a certain number of ordinances\r\nhave been passed that constitute on the part of the Reich the beginning\r\nof the execution of the new obligations imposed upon it.\r\n\r\nFirst, measures have been taken to procure employment for individuals. To\r\nthis end, aside from the ordinance of December 9, 1918, which imposes on\r\nmunicipalities the obligation of organizing employment bureaus, public\r\nand impartial, there is also an ordinance of May 5, 1920,[52] creating\r\nfor the Reich a bureau devoted to finding employment. This agency has\r\nfor its principal function a survey of the labour market and the editing\r\nof periodical bulletins on the situation in this market for the purpose\r\nof establishing an equilibrium between supply and demand in the different\r\nregions and in the different vocations.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken also to protect labour. The first step toward\r\nthe creation of uniform labour legislation was made by the provisional\r\nordinance of January 24, 1919, which, supplementing the divisions\r\nof the Civil Code, regulates labour in agricultural and forestry\r\nexploitations.[53] Social insurance legislation, such as is found\r\ncodified in the law of the Empire of July, 1911, _i. e._, as sickness,\r\naccident, disability and death insurance, has been supplemented by\r\ndifferent provisions, particularly by a law of December 29, 1919,\r\nrelative to the protection of pregnant women.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the obligation to provide livelihood for unemployed,\r\ndifferent ordinances have been issued which were codified by an ordinance\r\nof January 26, 1920.[54] According to these ordinances, the duty of\r\norganizing a service for the supplying of the needs of unemployed--a\r\nservice which must not take on the character of charity--falls upon the\r\nmunicipalities, which are assisted financially by the Reich to the extent\r\nof six-twelfths of the total expense and by the State with four-twelfths\r\nof this expense. The municipalities must refuse this help to those who\r\ndo not accept the work offered them, even if this work does not fit the\r\nvocation of the one refusing and even if it must be done away from home,\r\nprovided always that this work be adapted to the physical capacity of\r\nthe unemployed. The only ground on which one may refuse such work is\r\nthat the pay is not sufficient, given local conditions, to support the\r\nindividual and, if married, his family.[55]\r\n\r\nIn the same way that restrictions on the liberty of labour have\r\ncreated for the State a number of duties relating to the employment of\r\nindividuals, so the restrictions on the rights of private property have,\r\nas a consequence, engendered a number of obligations on the part of the\r\nState to assure to every one, if not a minimum of property, at least a\r\nminimum of well-being.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution guarantees individual property, but on the condition\r\nthat the distribution and the utilization of land do not present abuses.\r\nThe aim of this is to, “_to insure to every German a healthful dwelling\r\nand … homestead corresponding to his needs_” (Article 155). To this end\r\ncolonization must be favoured, the development of agriculture and the\r\nutilization of the soil must be promoted; a survey must be made of all\r\nthe mineral resources and all economically useful forces of nature.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with their conception of the duties of the State, the\r\nConstituent Assembly outlined a vast programme of agrarian and social\r\npolicy. In addition they themselves passed several laws which form the\r\ncommencement of the execution of this programme and which are intended to\r\nguide future legislation.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure every German a habitation and a homestead, the\r\nReich first promulgated a decree, July 31, 1919, “On small gardens\r\nand little farms,” according to which tracts of land, which cannot be\r\nused profitably, must be rented out at rates fixed by administrative\r\nauthorities after expert appraisal, or may be leased, and later\r\nsub-leased, for gardens, by the authorities.\r\n\r\nLater the law of April 11, 1919, was passed “on colonization.” This law\r\nobliges the State to create interior colonies and small undertakings.\r\nTo this end territory belonging to the State must be put on sale\r\nto “collective colonization enterprises”; these enterprises may be\r\nsubsidized by means of expropriations of swamps and uncultivated tracts.\r\nThey have the right of pre-emption in the sale of tracts of land of less\r\nthan twenty-five hectares. On the other hand, to develop colonization\r\ntracts, there must be organized “associations for the furnishing of\r\ntracts” in all districts where more than ten per cent of the cultivatable\r\nsoil is in the hands of big holders, that is, of more than one hundred\r\nhectares per holder. These associations, formed by a union of big\r\nlandholders, must, on the demand of collective colonization enterprises,\r\nput at the disposal of the latter at reasonable prices tracts of land\r\ntaken from the big properties. Their obligations in this respect cease\r\nwhen they have thus given over to colonization a third of the utilizable\r\nsurface of the large properties, or when the total area of these\r\nproperties is not more than ten per cent of the area of the district.\r\nThe right of pre-emption by the colonization enterprises in respect to\r\nlarge properties is exercised through the associations for the furnishing\r\nof tracts. In urgent cases these associations may proceed by means of\r\nexpropriation.\r\n\r\nThe Reich, finally, in order to assure a habitation to individuals,\r\nmust take a whole series of measures in the case of housing crises.\r\nAlready before the Revolution a decree of September 23, 1918, gave to\r\nmunicipalities the right to make regulations for the prevention of the\r\ndemolition of buildings or their use for other purposes than dwelling.\r\nThe municipalities had the right to draw up leases, even against the wish\r\nof the owners, through the intermediacy of “offices for the distribution\r\nof lodgings,” and to appropriate all unused buildings for the purpose\r\nof converting them to dwellings. A later decree of November 7, 1918,\r\nprovided that associations of municipalities and groups of municipalities\r\ncould be created to fight against housing crises. After the Revolution,\r\na new decree of January 15, 1919, contained more important provisions\r\nfor meeting the most urgent needs created by such crises. The State\r\nCabinets were obliged to appoint “housing commissioners,” charged with\r\nthe care of homeless families and the creation of small and average\r\nappropriate lodgings. To this end, they received considerable powers.\r\nThey could expropriate by a summary procedure unoccupied buildings they\r\ndeemed necessary, or have such buildings erected on grounds which they\r\nhad authority to lease for terms as long as thirty years. They could\r\ndispense with the requirements of legislative provisions, expropriate\r\ntile and other building materials necessary for the rapid construction\r\nof buildings; they could seize building lumber and forbid unnecessary\r\nconstruction. The service of these Housing Commissioners was under the\r\nMinister of Labour for the Reich.\r\n\r\nFinally, in order to protect tenants, the ordinances of September 23,\r\n1918, and of June 22, 1919, sanctioned and supplemented by the law of\r\nMay 11, 1920, _limit considerably the rights of owners to dispose of\r\nhabitable quarters_ and entrust to the “offices for distribution of\r\nlodgings,” extensive rights relative to the renting out of apartments and\r\nthe terms of lodgings. In particular, according to the law of 1920, if\r\ngrave inconveniences result from the lack of lodgings, the states may,\r\nwith the consent of the Minister of the Reich, authorize or constrain\r\nthe municipalities to take, or themselves take, measures that constitute\r\nencroachments on the liberty of settlement and the inviolability of\r\ndomicile, on condition that these measures be expressly necessary to\r\nmeet a housing crisis or to combat it. This law specifies, in addition,\r\nthat decisions taken in the fight against the shortage of houses may be\r\nexecuted by administrative constraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF COMMUNITIES.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly did not limit itself to the establishment of a\r\nlist of rights and duties of the individual. The social conceptions by\r\nwhich it was dominated led it to proclaim, after the rights and duties of\r\nthe individuals, the rights and duties of certain groups and communities\r\nthat seemed to it to play a particularly important rôle in society--the\r\nfamily, associations, municipalities, civil service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI.--THE FAMILY.--For the first time the family, the natural foundation\r\nof all ordered national life, finds itself mentioned in the Declaration\r\nof Rights of a modern state. The Constitution of Weimar formulates\r\nthe general principles which should dominate legislation relating to\r\nmarriage, to the education and the protection of children and to the\r\nduties of education devolved upon parents.\r\n\r\nArticle 119 places marriage under the special protection of the\r\nConstitution. Marriage, which forms the basis of family life and on which\r\ndepends the increase of the population of the nation, is based on the\r\nequal rights of both sexes. Marriage and the family are recognized as the\r\nbasis on which social life reposes and as the primary source from which\r\ndevelop German customs and culture. In consequence Article 119 enunciates\r\na legislative course of considerable social and political importance. It\r\nprescribes the care of the purity, the health and the social advancement\r\nof the family as a duty of the state and of the municipalities. Families\r\nwith numerous children have a claim to equalizing assistance. Motherhood\r\nhas the right to the protection and care of the State.\r\n\r\nProposals were made, during the discussion of the draft of the\r\nConstitution, to lighten the lot of illegitimate children. They\r\nwere aimed to assimilate, from the point of view of family rights,\r\nillegitimate and legitimate children. The majority of the National\r\nAssembly decided, because of the difficulties of regulating in a\r\nconstitutional text questions of private rights, to leave this matter\r\nto legislation and to later development. The Assembly limited itself to\r\nforming guiding principles only. Legislation must assure to illegitimate\r\nchildren the same conditions for physical, moral and social development\r\nthat legitimate children have. But convinced of the need of legislative\r\nreform on this matter, the Assembly passed a resolution that there should\r\nbe taken, as soon as possible and by legislative means, a new ordering of\r\nthe legal and social status of illegitimate children.\r\n\r\nConcerning education, Article 120 declares only that parents have the\r\nright and the duty to educate their children; “The physical, mental, and\r\nmoral education of their offspring is the highest duty and natural right\r\nof parents.” But the State must not leave it entirely to parents and\r\nintervenes as an organ of surveillance. The political community watches\r\nover the execution by the parents of these duties imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nIn addition the State assumes as an obligation in a general way the\r\nprotection of youth; the care of children and youth comes under the\r\nlegislative authority of the Reich. As a guide for the accomplishment\r\nof this obligation, Article 122 specifies that youth shall be protected\r\nagainst exploitation as well as against physical and mental neglect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII.--ASSOCIATION.--The right of assembly and association was already\r\nregulated by the law of April 19, 1908; in addition to this the Civil\r\nCode contained some provisions on the acquisition of civic rights. The\r\nConstitution contents itself with taking as its own the principles that\r\ninspired these laws, but it makes certain changes in the existing laws.\r\n\r\n_As to the liberty of assemblage_, Article 123 holds to rules previously\r\nadopted, “All Germans have the right of meeting peaceably and unarmed\r\nwithout notice or special permission.” The obligation that public\r\nmeetings be reported in advance to the authorities, which formerly\r\nexisted, is abolished. Furthermore, while the law of 1908 demanded that\r\npublic meetings in the open air and manifestations on public ways and\r\nsquares receive in advance authorization by the police--authorization\r\nwhich must be applied for at least twenty-four hours in advance--the\r\nConstitution, on the other hand, declares that _in theory_ these meetings\r\nare free and do not need to be authorized. It adds, however, that in\r\nthe interest of security and public order, liberty of assembly may be\r\nlimited by law, this limitation consisting furthermore not in the need of\r\nauthorization, but only in the obligation to give the police notice in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n_As to liberty of association_ the Constitution still holds to the\r\nprinciple of the regulations of 1908. “All Germans have the right\r\nto form associations or societies for purposes not contrary to the\r\ncriminal law. This right cannot be limited by preventive measures.”\r\n(Article 124.) Associations may acquire a legal status according to the\r\nregulations provided by the Civil Code. Hitherto these regulations gave\r\nadministrative authorities the right to oppose the acquisition of legal\r\nstatus by associations of a political, social or religious character.\r\nThis opposition resulted in the associations in question being kept from\r\nthe register of associations, and thereby prevented them from acquiring\r\nlegal standing. This restriction is abolished by the Constitution\r\nas contrary to the modern principle according to which liberty of\r\nassociation must be kept intact. To this effect it is expressly provided,\r\n“Every association has the right of incorporation in accordance with the\r\ncivil law. No association may be denied this right on the ground that it\r\npursues a political, social-political, or religious object.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII.--MUNICIPALITIES.--Article 127 provides, “Municipalities and\r\nunions of municipalities have the right of self-government.…” Thus\r\nthe _principle of decentralization_ is found introduced in the list of\r\nfundamental rights.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares that this autonomy must be exercised “within\r\nthe limits of the laws.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIV.--CIVIL SERVANTS.--Finally, the Constitution reaches the question of\r\ncivil servants, to which it devotes no less than six articles.\r\n\r\nBefore the Constitution went into effect, the status of civil servants of\r\nthe Empire was regulated by the law on civil servants, March 31, 1873,\r\nas amended by the law of May 18, 1907. The new Constitution left this\r\nlaw intact, but it superimposed a series of general rules, some of which\r\nwere borrowed from the preceding laws applying to the civil servants of\r\nthe Empire, and which are destined hereafter to hold good for all German\r\ncivil servants, as well as those of the states and of public corporations.\r\n\r\nThe principles that serve as a point of departure are: that civil\r\nservants are in the service not at all of the party in power, but of the\r\ncommunity; that, therefore, civil servants who remain faithful to the\r\ncommunity all their lives have the right to be kept in office for life\r\nand to have guaranteed them a financially adequate situation; finally\r\nthat outside of his office every civil servant is neither more nor less\r\nthan any other citizen. These principles the Constitution applies in\r\nthe provisions relative to the free access of all citizens to public\r\nfunctions, to the political liberty of civil servants and finally to\r\ntheir financial responsibility.\r\n\r\n(1) “All citizens without distinction are eligible for public office in\r\naccordance with the laws and according to their ability and services.”\r\n(Article 128.) In the future, citizenship in a particular state may no\r\nlonger be demanded by the laws of the States as a condition for public\r\nemployment; for the Constitution expressly provides that citizens must\r\nbe admitted to public employment “without distinction.” In addition,\r\nArticle 110, par. 2, formally declares, “Every German has the same rights\r\nand duties in each State of the Commonwealth as the citizens of that\r\nState.” On the other hand, Article 16 provides that as a rule officers\r\ndirectly charged with the administration of services that depend directly\r\non the Reich, and who are assigned to a State, shall be citizens of that\r\nState. From this it must be concluded that the civil servants of a State\r\nmay as a rule be recruited from among the citizens of that State without\r\nviolating the spirit of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAlready in preceding laws one finds no legal obstacle to the admission\r\nof women to civil service. The Constitution declares, meanwhile: “All\r\ndiscriminations against women in the civil service are abolished.” By\r\nthis--a logical consequence of the provision of Article 109, by which\r\nmen and women have in principle the same civil rights and duties--all\r\nobstacles to the admission of women to the service of the State on the\r\nsame conditions as men are abolished.\r\n\r\n(2) _Civil servants are in principle appointed for life._ However,\r\nexceptions are provided for, either in case future legislation on civil\r\nservants contains contrary provisions, or if, up to then, the law on\r\ncivil servants of the Empire and the laws of the states have provided\r\na different rule. A proposal by the Independents, according to which\r\ncivil servants would have to be chosen by election and therewith lose\r\nall guarantees the Constitution and the laws accord them, was rejected\r\nby a great majority. The rights acquired by civil servants must be\r\n_inviolable_. Claims in money matters must be heard by tribunals. Civil\r\nservants may not be temporarily deprived of their function, retired for\r\na time or permanently, or be given new work of a lower nature except\r\nunder conditions and according to forms provided by law and not by simple\r\narbitrary administrative measures.\r\n\r\nAgainst any disciplinary measure, civil servants may enter protests\r\nand commence procedure for damages. Furthermore, the system of secret\r\nreports on persons employed is abolished. Every civil servant has the\r\nright to consult his record, and no disparaging entry may be introduced\r\nin it without the opportunity being given to the employé to explain\r\nhimself on this matter.\r\n\r\n(3) _Civil servants are in the service of the State, of the community and\r\nnot at all the servants of a party or the party in power_. In consequence\r\nof this they retain the liberty of political conviction and of\r\nassociation. A later law of the Reich was provided for organizations in\r\nwhich civil servants are represented and which are supposed to co-operate\r\nin the regulation of all questions concerning them. The same idea that\r\nled to the recognition of the right of workers and clerks to co-operate\r\nin the form of Factory Workers Councils applies to civil servants and\r\ngives them the right to co-operate in all matters concerning them.\r\n\r\n(4) Finally the Constitution prescribes in a uniform manner for the whole\r\nReich, for the public servants of the states as well as those employed\r\nby public corporations, the limits of the _financial responsibility of\r\npublic servants_.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of civil servants is regulated by Section 838 of the\r\nCivil Code. “Every employé, who through premeditation or negligence,\r\nviolates the duty imposed upon him by his function, to the damage of a\r\nthird party, must recompense this party for the damage thus caused.” As\r\nto the manner in which this compensation is to be awarded, the Civil Code\r\nleaves it to the legislatures of the individual states to determine.\r\nMaking use of this authorization, most of the States individually\r\nhave decided that the State shall be responsible instead of the civil\r\nservants, and that the public treasury assume the indemnity to the limit\r\nfor which the civil servant is responsible, the treasury retaining,\r\nhowever, the right to proceed against the civil servant. Prussia adopted\r\nthis system in the law of April 1, 1909, and the Empire followed it, for\r\nthe employés of the Empire, in the law of May 22, 1910. However, there\r\nare still member states, Saxony for example, in which this solution has\r\nnot yet been adopted and where the civil servants are still directly\r\nresponsible to any individual who suffers damage through them.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution confirms in Article 131 a state of affairs that\r\nexists in most of the States and in the Reich, and declares that if a\r\ncivil officer in the exercise of the authority conferred on him by the\r\nlaw fails to perform his official duty toward any third person, the\r\nresponsibility is assumed by the state or public corporation in whose\r\nservice the officer is. The right of redress against the officer is\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--RELIGION AND THE CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nDeclarations of Rights generally contain, justly so, principles\r\nrelative to religious liberty and the free exercise of creeds. But\r\nthe Constitution of Weimar could not limit itself on this point to\r\ntraditional general maxims. The question of the relations of church and\r\nstate forms an essential article of the programme of the Centre, and also\r\nof the programme of the Social Democrats. Their solutions would seem to\r\nbe self-contradictory. The Centre wanted to guarantee to the Church a\r\nprivileged and preponderant situation within the State. The programme\r\nof Erfurt, on the other hand, declared religion to be a purely private\r\nmatter, and refused all subsidies levied on public resources in behalf\r\nof ecclesiastical or religious needs. But these two parties entered\r\nat that moment into a coalition which, together with the Democrats,\r\ngoverned the Reich. As neither of these two opposed conceptions was able\r\nto prevail, the conflict of the two theories was finally settled by a\r\ncompromise--which before consummation required laborious negotiations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Constitution first proclaims the principle of liberty of belief\r\nand conscience and the free exercise of religion. These liberties are\r\nexpressly placed by the Constitution under the protection of the\r\nState. They are guaranteed against every invasion no matter from what\r\nside it comes. But the general laws of the State remain intact and\r\nreligious liberty finds itself limited by the general regulations for the\r\nmaintenance of order and public security. Every abuse in the exercise of\r\nreligious liberty is punished by ordinary law. Civil rights and duties\r\nmust not be restrained or conditioned by the exercise of religious\r\nliberty. The enjoyment of civil and civic rights as well as the admission\r\nto public employ are independent of the religion professed. No one is\r\nobliged to divulge his or her religious convictions before any authority\r\nwhatsoever, and the right of an authority to inquire into the sect to\r\nwhich one belongs may not be exercised except as one’s rights and duties\r\ndepend upon this, as, for example, in the matter of church tithes or\r\nin the matter of guardianship or instruction; or where it is necessary\r\nfor the gathering of statistics ordered by law. No one may be forced to\r\nattend any Church ceremony or to take part in any religious exercise.\r\nNo one may be forced to make use of any religious oath as was formerly\r\nprescribed in civil and penal procedure. It is sufficient, in taking an\r\noath, that the one swearing shall declare without a religious formula, “I\r\nswear!”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Constitution contains several provisions regarding\r\nthe exercise of religion. Sundays and legal holidays remain protected by\r\nlaw as days of rest and spiritual edification.\r\n\r\nThese principles being admitted, there still remained the difficult\r\nproblem of the relations of State and Church. The following solution was\r\nadopted: There is neither complete separation nor any close union of the\r\nChurches and the State. The Churches are emancipated from the State, but\r\nthey enjoy certain privileges.\r\n\r\n_The Churches are free._ “There is no State Church.” The union that\r\nformerly existed between the Church and the State, in Prussia, for\r\nexample, and in the majority of the German States between them and the\r\nevangelical church, has disappeared, and the principle according to which\r\nreligious affairs depend upon the state is abolished.\r\n\r\nThis freedom of the Churches is manifested first, in that the creation\r\nof religious denominations and sects is free, and that the assembly of\r\nreligious denominations in associations within the Reich is subject to\r\nno limitation whatever. It is also revealed in the complete independence\r\nof the Churches in regard to the State. Each religious denomination\r\nadministers and conducts its affairs freely, provided that it observes\r\nthe laws that apply to all. It conducts its work without the co-operation\r\nof the State or of the municipality. The new system realizes thus the\r\nemancipation of ecclesiastical administration from secular control. The\r\nState may neither decree regulations affecting faith, nor appoint any one\r\nto ecclesiastical service nor demand that its assent be required to the\r\nnominations made by ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Constitution does not push the principle of the separation\r\nof Church and State to such a point as to allow religious denominations\r\nno more than the merely private rights accorded by law to natural\r\npersons. Recognizing the social force and the importance in public life\r\nexercised by the Churches, the Constitution accords them _privileges\r\nsimilar to those given to public corporations_. Religious denominations\r\nexisting in Germany at the time of the adoption of the Constitution\r\nremain recognized as public corporate bodies. As for other similar\r\norganizations, the same rights are accorded them on the motion of the\r\nstate government if, by their constitution and the sufficient number of\r\ntheir adherents, they offer guarantees of permanence. While recognizing\r\nthat in theory the smaller religious groups, chapels, and sects may be\r\ninvested with rights similar to those of the principal churches, the\r\nobject of the above limitation is to prevent ephemeral organizations from\r\nacquiring the standing of public corporate bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not expressly state of what the rights of public\r\ncorporations consist, for these rights result from provisions made in\r\nthe legislation of the various states. In a general way, however, public\r\ncorporations, in addition to the legal standing that private law gives\r\nthem, are under the special protection of the State. Their organizations\r\nare indirectly public agencies, and they have the right to levy taxes.\r\nThis right, practically the most important of those accorded public\r\ncorporations, is expressly emphasized and guaranteed in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nReligious denominations that are public corporate bodies have the right\r\nto _levy taxes_ on the bases of the lists established for the collection\r\nof civil taxes. The right to levy the taxes granted to public religious\r\ndenominations is limited, as a rule, to their members. They may, however,\r\nin exceptional cases levy on certain other taxables, particularly\r\ncorporations and joint stock companies, etc., to the same extent as on\r\ntheir co-religionists, if the laws of the particular State authorize this.\r\n\r\nIf several religious bodies combine into one association, the latter,\r\nwithout being required to secure any special authorization, becomes a\r\npublic corporation. This provision is important and has been voted out\r\nof consideration for the evangelical churches of the States which up to\r\nnow were territorially separated, and which are seeking to unite in a\r\nGerman ecclesiastical organization, such as had to be formed after the\r\ndisappearance of the régime in which reigning princes ruled the churches.\r\n\r\nThe financial situation of religious bodies is regulated by Article\r\n138. The property and other rights of religious bodies and associations\r\nfor the maintenance of their cultural, educational, and charitable\r\ninstitutions, their foundations and other possessions, are guaranteed.\r\nAs a consequence of the separation of Church and State, the Constitution\r\nprovides that the obligations hitherto imposed on the State to\r\nparticipate financially in the expenses of the Churches no longer\r\nexists. But on this point the Constitution compromises. Payments due from\r\nthe State to the Churches because of some law or of legal title to such,\r\nmust be commuted by state legislation, on bases fixed by the Reich. The\r\nStates, however, cannot proceed to do this before a law of the Reich has\r\nfixed these bases. Till then, these payments continue. (Articles 138 and\r\n179.)\r\n\r\nThe liquidation must include not only the payments owed because of a law\r\nor treaty, but also those due by virtue of some special legal title,\r\nparticularly those resting on customary law and tradition.\r\n\r\nThe question whether, in the new legislation relative to the Churches,\r\nthere subsists still any special right of supervision by the States,\r\ncannot be answered uniformly. Properly speaking there is no right\r\nof supervision by the States. But the latter may exercise over the\r\nChurches the same control as over public corporations for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining order and public security.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nAfter having regulated the question of the relations between Church and\r\nState, the Constituent Assembly took up the problem of education. It\r\napproached it in the same spirit that inspired the provisions it adopted\r\nrelative to fundamental rights and duties. Here, too, it exerted itself\r\nto give its work a marked social character; and to a very large measure\r\nit succeeded.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Articles concerning the schools were the subject of long\r\ndeliberations and lively discussions in committee and in the full\r\nsession of the Constitutional Assembly. In the debates on schools, on\r\nthe relations of Church and State, and on the relations of schools and\r\nchurches, two conflicting conceptions were manifested. Whereas the\r\nCentre and the parties of the Right declared in principle for religious\r\nschools, the Social Democrats championed the idea of secular schools, and\r\nlong negotiations were required to find a compromise between these two\r\napparently irreconcilable doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, in its final text, contains provisions relative to\r\npublic instruction, and to private instruction as well as provisions\r\napplicable to both of these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI.--Public instruction must form an “organized whole.” That is to say,\r\nit must not consist of a collection of schools of different kinds\r\nwithout any logical bond between them; but on the contrary it must be\r\nsystematically organized, in such a manner that each kind of school\r\nwill be part of a harmonious whole, constructed on a rational plan and\r\nanswering a definite object. This instruction must be systematized by\r\nco-operation of the Reich, the States and the municipalities.\r\n\r\nBut what principles should guide this organization and what should be its\r\naims? It is here that the social doctrine of the Constituent Assembly\r\nreappears. Public instruction whose detailed organization is left to\r\nthe regulation by ordinary laws to be enacted must present certain\r\ncharacteristics, all arising from the same idea--_guaranteeing to every\r\nindividual a maximum of development to the end that he may co-operate in\r\nthe most effective fashion in the well-being of the community_.\r\n\r\n(1) At the base of the educational edifice there is the common or\r\nelementary school (Grundschule), which gives all children an equal\r\neducation, from the point of view of length of time and content. _This is\r\nthe principle of the “uniform” school._ This does not mean, however, that\r\neverywhere and in all the states public schools must be organized after\r\nan invariable pattern. They are uniform in the sense that they are one in\r\nthe conception underlying their establishment, in that they are inspired\r\nin every respect and exclusively by the same democratic principles,\r\nthat no difference in instruction is made and that the economic and\r\nsocial position and the religious beliefs of parents are deliberately\r\ndisregarded in according to children the right to an education.\r\n\r\n(2) Above the common schools are the secondary and higher schools. The\r\nConstitution does not say how these are to be organized. It indicates\r\nonly the idea that is to serve as a guide to legislators when they\r\nconstruct the educational edifice. The State is not to yield to the will\r\nand the desires of individuals, but is to be guided before all by the\r\naptitudes and the interests of the children.\r\n\r\n(3) All children are naturally not compelled to go through the whole\r\neducational curriculum, but there is an _obligatory minimum of\r\ninstruction_. Educational obligations are notably extended in the\r\nConstitution as compared to their former limits. “Attendance at school is\r\nobligatory. This obligation is discharged by attendance at the elementary\r\nschools for at least eight school years and at the continuation schools\r\nuntil the completion of the eighteenth year.” Formerly the obligation\r\nto attend school was only for seven years for the public schools.\r\nSupplementary instruction, therefore, thus becomes an essential part of\r\npublic education in all the Reich.\r\n\r\n(4) Instruction is free, at least in the elementary and supplementary\r\nschools. This is a necessary result of compulsory education. The\r\nsecondary and higher schools are in theory not free, but “to facilitate\r\nthe attendance of those in poor circumstances at the secondary and higher\r\nschools, public assistance shall be provided by the Commonwealth, States,\r\nand municipalities, particularly, assistance to the parents of children\r\nregarded as qualified for training in the secondary and higher schools,\r\nuntil the completion of the training.”\r\n\r\n(5) Instruction in public schools, with some exceptions, remains\r\nreligious. The most serious disputes arose over this point. Undoubtedly\r\nobvious progress has been realized by withdrawing the public school from\r\nthe local supervision of members of the clergy; and by making hereafter\r\npublic instruction as a whole subject to the inclusive control of the\r\nState. Municipalities may in addition be summoned to participate in this\r\nsupervision. This will permit future educational laws of the Reich and\r\nadministrative laws of the States to give the municipality a share in\r\nsupervising the instruction--not only over the work of the schools but\r\nalso over the spirit in which it is carried on. Even parents will be\r\nallowed the right to co-operate in it and teachers will be given a voice\r\nin the management. The supervision of the schools on the part of the\r\nReich will be hereafter solely by civil servants, who will have this as\r\ntheir principal function and who will be especially appointed for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBut the principal question was whether the public school, even when\r\nsupervised by the State, should be neutral or whether it should remain\r\nreligious in teaching.\r\n\r\nThree systems were submitted. One was the system of the secular school,\r\nwhere no religious instruction is given. Another was the mixed school,\r\nwhere children of all religious faiths are admitted without distinction\r\nand where the parents indicate whether they wish their children to\r\nreceive religious instruction, and if so, what. The third was the\r\ndenominational system, properly so-called, in which the public school\r\nis specialized by religious denominations, each denomination having its\r\nown school where the child receives the religious instruction of its\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\nThe discussions on this question went through three successive phases.\r\nAt first there was some agreement on a plan according to which schools\r\nwould be mixed, in theory, but the denominational school, properly\r\nso-called, would not be completely excluded; for the law could admit, on\r\nthe proposition of parents, the creation of schools in which only the\r\nchildren of a single denomination would be received.\r\n\r\nThis compromise not completely satisfying the Centre, which used its\r\ninfluence to effect a change, a new plan was therefore accepted.\r\nThis introduced the denominational school, properly so-called, into\r\nthe Constitution. According to this plan, the wish of parents would\r\ndecide whether a school should be secular, mixed or denominational, the\r\nfree choice by the parents being limited only by the requirements of\r\nwell-ordered scholarship. The parties of the Left vigorously opposed\r\nthis. The most serious objection they raised was that it would have as a\r\nconsequence the necessity on the part of some states, such as Baden and\r\nHesse, which had already introduced mixed schools legally, to renounce\r\nthem again. A new compromise was thereupon arrived at, which under the\r\nnew form became the final text. Denominational schools and lay schools\r\nwould constitute exceptions and could not be established except when\r\ndemanded by heads of families and conditioned by the requirements of\r\nwell-ordered scholarship. As for the rest the educational questions must\r\nbe regulated, the principles by an educational law for the Reich, the\r\ndetails by the legislation of the States.\r\n\r\nThus _in principle the public school is mixed_. The public school is\r\nattended by all children no matter to what religion they belong, and\r\nreligious instruction forms part of the regular school curriculum.\r\n(Article 149.) The imparting of religious instruction in the school must\r\ntake place within the general framework of educational legislation. In\r\nother words, it is not the church but the State which gives instruction.\r\nIt is the State that must take into its hands the organization of\r\nreligious instruction. It is the State that decides what place religious\r\ninstruction shall hold in its curriculum. It goes without saying,\r\nhowever, that, as to the content of religious instruction, this must be\r\nin agreement with the principles of the religious society concerned.\r\nNo teacher, according to Article 149, par. 2, can be compelled to give\r\nreligious instruction or to participate in religious exercises. In the\r\nsame way no pupils are obliged to take religious instruction or to\r\nparticipate in ecclesiastical ceremonies and festivities. They may only\r\nbe compelled to do so if the persons who have the right to decide on\r\ntheir religious education express the desire that they do so.\r\n\r\nBut public secular schools and public denominational schools, properly\r\nso-called, also may continue, and their existence is constitutionally\r\nguaranteed. These schools, by the same title as the mixed schools, are\r\nelementary schools, on which may be based secondary and higher education.\r\nBut these cannot be established in municipalities except under certain\r\nspecified conditions. There must first be a formal demand on the part\r\nof a sufficient number of heads of families. Then the organization of\r\nthe school asked for must conform to high educational standards. From\r\nall this it may be concluded that the system of the uniform school and\r\nthe transition from the public school to secondary and higher schools\r\nmust not be interfered with. In addition, the arrangement of instruction\r\nbased on the diverse vocational needs, must not be made impossible.\r\nFinally, public instruction must not be handicapped by the unnecessary\r\nestablishment of useless and inefficient schools. The wishes of heads of\r\nfamilies, as far as possible and in accordance with the above conditions,\r\nmust be taken into consideration and their proposals accepted. Questions\r\nof detail, such as, what is understood by “head of a family”; how\r\nmany such are sufficient within a municipality to be able to demand a\r\nsectarian or a secular school; how many schools there shall be and of\r\nwhat kind, must be settled by educational laws of the Reich and by laws\r\nof the States which must follow those of the Reich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII.--_Private instruction is permitted._ (Article 142.) However, this\r\nliberty is subject to important restrictions (Article 147) in the case of\r\nprivate schools considered as substitutes for public schools.\r\n\r\nIn general, establishments of private instruction, no matter of what\r\ngrade, can be created only _by the authorization of the State_. This\r\nauthorization is subject to the following conditions: the programme\r\nand the equipment of private schools must not fall below the programme\r\nand equipment of public schools. The scientific training of teachers of\r\nprivate schools must be of as high a standard as that of public school\r\nteachers. The economic and legal position of private school teachers must\r\nbe guaranteed. Finally, private schools cannot become the schools of\r\nclass or caste.\r\n\r\nElementary private schools are subjected by the Constitution to several\r\nspecial conditions. Their establishment is authorized when in any\r\nmunicipality there does not exist for a minority of heads of families,\r\nwhose needs must be considered, a public school of their denomination,\r\nor one that conforms to their ethical system. Such a school may also be\r\nestablished if educational authorities recognize in the demands of such\r\na group a special pedagogical interest. The Constitutional provisions\r\nrelating to programmes and free instruction apply also to private\r\nelementary schools.\r\n\r\nPrivate preparatory schools are abolished.\r\n\r\nFinally, for private schools that are not substitutes for public schools,\r\nsuch as commercial and professional schools, the laws formerly in\r\nexistence still operate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII.--The Constitution contains a number of provisions for instruction,\r\nboth public and private. It provides that vocational instruction and\r\nmoral and civic education shall be part of the programme of all schools.\r\nBy means of vocational instruction children must be made to understand\r\nthe great importance of work, for the individual as well as for society\r\nas a whole. Civic instruction must acquaint children with the rights and\r\nduties of citizens, with the organization of the German State, and with\r\nthe public life of Germany. To this end, every scholar on completion\r\nof the course in compulsory education shall receive a copy of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the provisions relative to instruction in the schools. They\r\nconstitute, as compared to the former state of affairs, a considerable\r\nchange. But these provisions cannot be effectively put into operation\r\nexcept by a series of laws on the part of the Reich as well as of the\r\nStates, a process which threatens to be a long one in point of time.\r\n\r\nHowever, in April, 1920, the first law on this matter was passed by the\r\nNational Assembly. It was the law _on the elementary school_. According\r\nto this law, primary schools must be so organized that the first four\r\nyears may at the same time serve as a preparation for secondary and\r\nhigher education. Every child who has successfully graduated from the\r\nhighest class of the elementary school must be sufficiently prepared to\r\nenter immediately a secondary or a higher school. Public preparatory\r\nschools and public preparatory classes are abolished. As for private\r\npreparatory schools, their suppression will take place only after a\r\nsufficiently long reprieve; their complete abolition need not take place\r\nuntil the commencement of the school year 1929-1930; since economic\r\ndifficulties prevent the earlier abolition of these schools, and means\r\nmust be taken to provide for the teachers who will be deprived thus\r\nof their occupations. Private instruction is not allowed except in\r\nparticular cases and can only in special circumstances be substituted for\r\nthe elementary school. The law does not touch instruction and training\r\nin auxiliary classes; nor does it concern itself with the instruction of\r\nchildren physically or mentally diseased.\r\n\r\nIn addition a certain number of interesting innovations have been\r\nenacted into legislation. These have as their purpose the participation\r\nby parents and pupils in the administration of schools. On the one\r\nhand, in the secondary schools there are organized Students’ Councils\r\n(Schulgemeinden). These Councils are formed by pupils of the three upper\r\nclasses, who meet periodically in assembly to discuss questions of\r\ninstruction--educational matters, quarterly reports, discipline, duties,\r\netc. Teachers attend these meetings without the right to vote. Up to now\r\nthese assemblies have had only the right to propose reforms without power\r\nas yet to make them operative. On the other hand, parents elect for each\r\nschool a Parents’ Council, one member for every fifty pupils.[56] This\r\nCouncil concerns itself mostly with classes, examination and discipline.\r\nIf a pupil has committed a fault involving the possibility of expulsion\r\nfrom the schools, it is before this Council that this question is taken.\r\nTeachers are sometimes admitted to these deliberations but have not the\r\nright to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION AND SOCIALIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution imposes on each German the duty of work. It is not\r\nsufficient in modern states, especially in one defeated in war, that\r\nevery one therein merely work, unless this work is directed in a\r\ncertain spirit, following a given plan and toward a determined end. The\r\nfundamental idea that inspired the Constituent Assembly in the last\r\nprovisions of its work is as follows: The whole German system of economy,\r\npublic and private, is destroyed or demolished by the war. Germany cannot\r\ndream of rising from its ruins unless it realizes immediate and radical\r\nreforms. It must completely reconstruct its former economic system. The\r\nwhole country must become an immense enterprise directed by a conscious\r\nwill aimed at a definite goal. All the forces of the country solidly\r\norganized and scientifically utilized must be so managed that a maximum\r\nof production will be assured.\r\n\r\nTo this end, two series of reforms are contemplated. They are summed\r\nup in these words, “councils” and “collective economy.” On the one\r\nhand, there is projected an Economic Constitution, whose organs are\r\nprogressively destined to be parallel to those of the political\r\nConstitution. On the other hand, the effort is made to realize in the\r\norganization of production and distribution an economic system that is\r\nintermediate between that of private economy on the one hand, and a\r\npurely socialist régime on the other.\r\n\r\nNothing systematic, however, has as yet been achieved. The ground is\r\nnew. Surprised by the Revolution, the theoreticians of new systems have\r\nnot yet fixed their schemes nor elaborated complete and coherent plans.\r\nOn the other hand, the majority of the National Assembly is formed by a\r\ncoalition of parties whose economic conceptions differ still more than\r\ndo their political conceptions. This lack of definiteness and these\r\ndifferences endanger all effective realization of a solution. But the\r\nnecessity of reforms has made itself imperatively felt and economic\r\ndifficulties are so grave and menacing that they cannot wait indefinitely\r\nfor solution. Further, there are very many people who are restive and\r\nwho do not hesitate to resort to general strikes and even to revolts,\r\nwhen governments hesitate too long in effecting a reform from which they\r\nhope an amelioration of their lot. That is why one will look in vain for\r\na plan as a whole or a logical order in the provisions we are about to\r\nstudy. Most of them were adopted by an assembly uncertain of the work it\r\nshould do, one which went about its tasks most hurriedly and obeyed the\r\npressure of external forces more powerful than itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nThe Economic Constitution rests wholly on the idea of the Councils. It\r\nis recalled[57] that the system of the Councils, even under the parity\r\nprinciple which the supporters of the Vocational Parliament wished to\r\ngive it, was left out of the political Constitution but is included in\r\nthe Economic Constitution, for which it forms the framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE “ANCHORAGE” OF THE COUNCILS IN THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution, said the Socialists and Trade Unionists, there\r\nwas in Germany neither political autonomy nor economic autonomy. Just\r\nas in their political life the people were governed by a coterie of\r\njunkers and bureaucrats, so in their economic life the people were\r\nunder the absolute domination of the entrepreneur. This autocracy of the\r\ncapitalists expressed itself legally in the fact that the conditions of\r\nwork were fixed solely by the employers. The omnipotence of the latter\r\nwas, however, modified by the collective bargains concluded between them\r\nand the trade unions. While it is true that these agreements or bargains\r\ndid not have legal guarantees, nevertheless thanks to the existence\r\nof workingmen’s organizations there was instituted by means of these\r\nagreements a contractual and coequal workingmen’s right.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1918 introduced in Germany political democracy. The\r\nrepublican government in its establishment has even taken several steps\r\nalong the road of economic democracy. Reforms, such as the granting of\r\ncomplete liberty of organization, the abolition of ordinances on wages\r\nand exceptional laws against agricultural labourers, and the protection\r\nof workers and salaried employés against arbitrary discharge, certainly\r\nmark interesting progress.\r\n\r\nBut the Socialists, followed on this point by the National Assembly,\r\nheld that these reforms were only preparatory in character. True\r\neconomic democracy can not content itself with the mere recognition of\r\nworkers’ organizations and collective bargaining. Economic democracy\r\ncannot be established and therefore economic and social transformation\r\ncannot be effected, unless the working class can exercise on production\r\nthe influence that is its due. There must be provided an organization\r\nthat accords the workers the right to participate actively in the\r\ndetermination of the ends and of the duties of the vocation and the\r\nenterprise; which makes of the workers co-operators with the capitalist.\r\nThere must be in every district, in the states and in the Reich an\r\neconomic representation created, in which workers and employés will be\r\nrepresented by the side of their employers, and in which, on a footing of\r\nequality, they will be called upon to co-operate in the regulation of all\r\neconomic questions. Such is the thesis; and all efforts and struggles\r\nwhich we shall observe, centred about the problem of according to the\r\nworking class the right of codecision (Mitbestimmungsrecht); and about\r\nthe problem of organizing this right. But so far nothing has been done\r\nbeyond the statement of some indefinite principles and the roughing out\r\nof the first measures of their realization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese problems were not new. Already before the war the law of 1891\r\nprovided for “Committees of Workers” in the factories, who could be\r\nconsulted on the provisions of factory regulations; but as the formation\r\nof these committees depended entirely on the good-will of the employers,\r\nthe workers looked with little sympathy on this institution. In fact,\r\nsuch committees existed in several thousand factories, but their activity\r\nwas limited to the administration of the income from fines and the\r\ninstitution of welfare work.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the rôle of the workers increased considerably in\r\nimportance. The laws for compulsory patriotic service which took away\r\nfrom them the liberty of work owed them compensation. There were\r\nestablished therefore in all enterprises where there were more than fifty\r\nemployed, “committees of workers,” which were elected by all the workers\r\nand had definite functions. There were in addition “joint arbitration\r\ncommittees,” where conflicts between employers and employés were settled.\r\n“Committees on decisions” also existed, charged with ruling on other\r\nquestions raised by the law for patriotic service. These different\r\norganisms at once assumed an important place in the economic life.\r\n\r\nOn the advent of the Revolution the unions easily obtained some reforms\r\nfor which they had fought for a long time, and which constituted their\r\nimmediate claims.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, the unions concluded an agreement with the employers’\r\nassociations, which has served as the basis of an important development,\r\nbegun on that date and known as the “labour board” (Arbeitsgemeinschaft).\r\nThe _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ appeared several months before the end of the\r\nwar, but assumed a rôle of prime importance in the new organization of\r\neconomic Germany.\r\n\r\nThe _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ has been defined as “the combination of big\r\nassociations of employers and of workers for the regulation of reciprocal\r\nrelations between employers and workers and for the solution in common of\r\nall economic and social questions touching industry and labour.”[58]\r\n\r\nThe essential principle of the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ is that of _parity_.\r\nIn the agreement of November 15, the labour unions are recognized as the\r\nvocational representatives of the workers. The most complete liberty of\r\norganization is accorded them. The agreement specifies as its practical\r\ntasks the feeding of veterans, the distribution of raw material, and the\r\nregulation in common of labour disputes. For the settlement of pending\r\nquestions there was organized a special committee composed one-half of\r\nemployers and one-half of workers.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, December 4, 1918, there was drawn up the “statutes\r\nof the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ of the employers and employés of Germany.”\r\nAll German industries were divided into a certain number of groups,\r\nwhich had common organs composed half of employers and half of workers,\r\neach elected by their respective organizations. There was in addition a\r\ncentral council, which was the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ of all the employers\r\nand organized workers of all German industries. Its members were elected\r\nby the groups from their membership; and these in turn elected a Central\r\nCommittee, which executed the decisions of the Central Council.\r\n\r\nAll these organs--and this point must be emphasized--were composed\r\nhalf of employers and half of workers. The parity principle is at the\r\nbasis of the whole organization of the _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_. Thus\r\nall economic and social questions concerning industry and labour were\r\nregulated by committees in which the employers’ associations and the\r\nlabour unions were each represented by one-half in each committee. The\r\n_Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ is a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nIn addition on December 23, 1918, the Commissars of the People signed\r\na decree “on collective agreements, workers and employers committees,\r\nand the arbitration of labour disputes.” This decree[59] maintained\r\nthe committees which were developed during the war by virtue of the\r\nlaw for patriotic service, and increased their powers. Here, too, the\r\nwhole mechanism rested on the parity principle. According to this\r\ndecree, committees of workers and employers had to be organized in all\r\nindustries, in all the administrative bodies and in all offices where\r\nthere were at least twenty labourers or employés. These had as their\r\nmission the protection of the economic interests of labourers and\r\nemployés against employers in the factories, administrative bodies and\r\noffices. The committees had to supervise in co-operation with the bosses\r\nthe carrying out of the various provisions in the collective contracts.\r\nIn factories where there was no collective contract the committees were\r\nsupposed to co-operate in the regulation of wages and other conditions\r\nof labour in agreement with the economic representatives of the workers\r\nand employés. It was their task, in addition, to maintain good relations\r\namong the workers, as well as between the workers and employers.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that an evolution thus commenced could have continued\r\nnormally and without difficulty, and that economic and social problems\r\nraised by the reorganization of Germany could thereafter be regulated by\r\nthe _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_; that is to say, by direct agreement between\r\nemployers associations and labour unions. But the problem was peculiarly\r\ncomplicated by the introduction and rapid diffusion in Germany of Russian\r\nrevolutionary ideas. The Soviet differs essentially from the committee\r\nabove described. Whereas in the latter employers and employés are placed\r\non terms of equality and the committee itself becomes a purely economic\r\ninstitution, the Soviet, according to the Russian conception, is a\r\npolitical organization, whose purpose is to eliminate the employers and\r\nto establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Soviet must have in\r\nits hands all the political and economic power of the State.\r\n\r\nAs to this conception of the political omnipotence of the Council, we\r\nhave seen that powerful opposition ensued on the morrow of the Revolution\r\nand that in January, 1919, the Social Democrats remained in full control\r\nof power after having eliminated the Independents. We know that this\r\nstruggle continued, however, and it will be recalled what organizations\r\nthe Independents provided for and wished to institute in order to assure\r\nto the Workers Councils the political sovereignty they claim. Parallel to\r\nthe political struggle between the Social Democrats and the Independents,\r\nthere developed another, on the economic field, between the Trade Unions\r\nand the Councils, which found themselves in conflict as much over\r\nwhat reforms should be demanded by the working class as over the rôle\r\nthese two groupings should respectively retain in the struggle for the\r\nrecognition of their claims.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Unions declared themselves satisfied with the agreement they\r\nhad concluded with the employers, as well as with the decree of December\r\n23, 1918, which Legien, President of the General Confederation of\r\nLabour, called “The Great Charter of Labour.” They were convinced that\r\nthereafter there was nothing more to do but to wait for time to develop\r\nlogically and peacefully the rôle of the _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_ and of\r\nthe Committees provided for by the decree of 1918. _They did not believe\r\nthat in this evolution there was any room for Councils._ It was they,\r\nthe Trades Unions, that had theretofore been the only ones to occupy\r\nthemselves with economic questions, and they did not propose to permit\r\nspecial groups, operating in isolated factories, to deprive them of\r\ntheir traditional mission. Legien in particular did not want to hear any\r\ntalk of the Councils. They did not seem to him to be able to “incorporate\r\nthemselves in the actual hierarchy of the organizations and agencies\r\nof the workers.” He protested against any concession to the system of\r\nCouncils, and declared that the only organisms in position to defend the\r\neconomic interests of the working class, were the Trades Unions.\r\n\r\nBut an increasingly important part of the working class, attracted by\r\nthe ardent propaganda of the theoreticians of the Councils system,\r\nphysically and mentally depressed by misery and unemployment, irritated\r\nby the mistakes of the Cabinet and disillusioned by the impotence of the\r\nAssembly of Weimar, rallied to the doctrines of the Councils. The Trades\r\nUnions were no longer believed by them able to lead the battle which\r\nwould assure to the workers the preponderant rôle which should be theirs\r\nin economic matters. They showed during the war, co-operating with the\r\nmilitarists and the bureaucrats of the Empire, that they were always\r\nready to compromise. They were directed by veritable functionaries, whose\r\nwhole careers developed within the Trades Union administration and who\r\nhad no qualification for representing the working class. In order to\r\nsecure what the working class wants these claims must be taken in hand\r\nby organs issuing directly from the workers--militant organizations in\r\nposition to lead a swift energetic fight--these organs being the Workers\r\nCouncils. _The Councils must be placed above the unions_, and it is to\r\nthem that belongs the right to decide on the campaigns that should be\r\nwaged.\r\n\r\nBetween these two opposite conceptions there arose an intermediate\r\ntheory. The trades unionists of the later school and the Christian Trades\r\nUnionists, energetically as they rejected all economic dictatorship by\r\nthe Councils, held, however, that there is something just and legitimate\r\nin such theories. Giesbert, who holds an important situation in the\r\nChristian Trades Unions and who was to be Minister of Posts, wrote in\r\nApril: “We have not sufficiently appreciated and above all we have\r\nrealized too late the degree of sound truth in the idea of the Councils.\r\nThe reason for this is that this idea has come to us from Russia as a\r\npolitical conception, and also because it arrived accompanied by all\r\nthe tragic manifestations of the Russian Revolution. If the system of\r\nCouncils assures to the workers the right to participate more completely\r\nin the organization and development of economic life, then it cannot\r\nhelp but contribute, if this is done in a reasonable manner, to the\r\nreawakening of the love of work and the establishment of a close\r\ncommunity of interests between employers and employés.”[60]\r\n\r\nAs for the Cabinet, it declared itself from the first against the\r\nCouncils, and in an official communication on February 26, 1919,\r\nScheidemann, President of the Council of Ministers, declared that the\r\nCabinet never considered the introduction of the Councils System in\r\nGermany, and that above all, if any part should be accorded the Councils,\r\nit could only be that of an intermediary between the employers and the\r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\nBut it soon became impossible for either the Cabinet or the Trades\r\nUnions to remain in this almost completely negative position; for the\r\nstruggle for the _Mitbestimmungsrecht_ ceased to be merely a debate among\r\ntheoreticians. At the beginning of March the workers in the metallurgical\r\nindustry declared a general strike in Berlin; and in April the miners of\r\nCentral Germany did the same.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet found itself forced to modify its point of view. Receiving\r\nat Weimar a delegation of strikers come to present an ultimatum to him,\r\nScheidemann recanted the communication of February 26, and engaged\r\nhimself by a written promise to effect the recognition of the principle\r\nof Councils in the Constitution.[61] One month later he fulfilled his\r\npromise. On April 5, a new note made known under what conditions and\r\nto what extent the Cabinet envisaged the possibility of organizing and\r\nutilizing the Councils. He proposed to inscribe in the Constitution an\r\narticle proclaiming in general terms the right of workers to participate\r\nin common and on equal terms with employers in the regulation of\r\nquestions of wages and work, as well as in the development of the forces\r\nof production in the common economic interest. By the side of special\r\nWorkers Councils there were to be mixed Councils which would have general\r\neconomic authority.\r\n\r\nOn their side the Trades Unions also found themselves obliged to seek\r\na working basis, and they concluded by agreeing to the introduction\r\nof Councils in German economic life, on the condition that a very\r\nsharp separation be marked between the powers of the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils and the Economic Councils on the one hand, and those of the\r\nTrades Unions themselves on the other. Another condition was that\r\nassurance must be given the Trades Unions that the _Workers Councils\r\nwould fulfil their mission in accord with the Trades Unions_. At the\r\nCongress of Nuremberg, July, 1919, the Trades Unions engaged themselves\r\nto use their whole influence to secure for the workers and employés the\r\n_Mitbestimmungsrecht_ in the various industries and to help the Factory\r\nWorkers Councils to play an effective part.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS RELATIVE TO THE COUNCILS.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, then, to recognize for wage-earners and salaried employés\r\nthe right of co-operation in the conduct of industries and that all\r\nparties to the productive organization of the nation must co-operate in\r\nthe regulation of economic questions. This idea is developed and in part\r\nrealized in the provisions of Article 165, which form the foundation of\r\nthe future Economic Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution sets forth the idea that the economic organization of\r\nthe country must pursue two different courses and should therefore have\r\ntwo different series of organs--the “Workers Councils” and the “Economic\r\nCouncils.” This double organization is based on considerations that were\r\nexpressed by Member of the Assembly Sinzheimer at the session of the\r\nNational Assembly on July 21, as follows: “In economic life there is\r\nboth a conflict and a community of interests. The conflict that exists\r\nin our economic life and which it is impossible not to perceive is the\r\nconflict between capital and labour. It is therefore necessary, since the\r\nemployers are already represented publicly in Chambers of Commerce, etc.,\r\nthat the side of labour should also receive special public representation\r\nwhich should include all wage-earners and salaried employés. The mission\r\nof this representation should be to express all the interests of the\r\nworking class, as such, in an organized manner, through a public organ\r\nof representation. This public organ of representation is the Workers\r\nCouncil. This Council is a unilateral representation of interests. It has\r\nas its purpose the increase and realization of the economic influence of\r\nthe working class. But in economic life there is not only a conflict,\r\nthere is also a community of interest. The latter is based on the common\r\ninterest in production on the part of both employer and employé. The\r\nEconomic Councils have as their mission, in contrast to the Workers\r\nCouncils, to realize these common ‘duties of production,’ that are\r\nequally incumbent upon employers and employés. They must satisfy all the\r\ninterests of production and bring into co-operation for production all\r\nthe elements that participate in it, to increase production, diminish its\r\ncosts and to regulate it as far as possible according to considerations\r\nof social good.”\r\n\r\nWorkers Councils are: Factory Workers Councils, for each establishment;\r\nDistrict Workers Councils, organized for each economic district; and the\r\nNational Workers Council, whose authority extends over the whole German\r\nterritory. These Councils have as their mission the safeguarding of the\r\nsocial and economic interests of the workers.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Councils are organized according to a geographical\r\ndivision. They consist of District Economic Councils and the National\r\nEconomic Council. The former consist of the union of District Workers\r\nCouncils with the corresponding representatives of the employers and\r\nother interested classes of the population. The National Economic\r\nCouncil consists of the union of the National Workers Council with the\r\ncorresponding representatives of the employers and other “interested\r\nclasses of the population.” The Constitution does not state precisely\r\nwhat is to be understood by this last expression. In the Constitutional\r\nCommittee it was unanimously agreed that the consumers shall be\r\nparticularly represented in the Economic Councils. The creation of these\r\nCouncils is obligatory and legislators are bound by the Constitution to\r\nenact the necessary laws to this effect.\r\n\r\nIn addition there may be created “autonomous bodies” (Article 156, par.\r\n2) the administration of which is incumbent upon Economic Councils\r\norganized not by regions but by industries. Unlike the regional Economic\r\nCouncils, the creation of these autonomous bodies is only optional; they\r\nmust be organized, says the Constitution, “in case of urgent necessity.”\r\n\r\nThe Constitution specifies with a little more detail than for the Workers\r\nCouncils, the powers of the future Economic Councils. These have for\r\ntheir purpose, in addition to general economic duties, _to co-operate\r\nin the execution of socialization laws_. In addition the Economic\r\nCouncils of the autonomous bodies are charged with the administration of\r\nenterprises placed under the economic collectivity, such as coal, potash,\r\netc.[62]\r\n\r\nFinally, the National Economic Council must have certain political\r\nfunctions, and thereby the Constitution makes concession to the\r\nsupporters of the institution of an Economic Parliament. The solution\r\nadopted constitutes a middle ground between the views held by the latter\r\nand those of the partisans of a purely formal democracy. It gives to the\r\nNational Economic Council a certain political influence, but it does not\r\naccord it absolutely any power of execution. It has the right to be heard\r\non all bills of social and economic character before they are presented\r\nto the Reichstag by the Cabinet. It has, in addition, the right itself to\r\npropose laws on social and economic matters, and the Cabinet is obliged,\r\neven if it does not approve of these projects, to take them before the\r\nReichstag. It may only present its own point of view as opposed to that\r\nof the Economic Council. Finally, the latter may send a representative\r\nfrom among its members to present its proposal before the Reichstag. The\r\nsituation of the Economic Council is, on the whole, on the social and\r\neconomic field very analogous to that of the Reichsrat.\r\n\r\nThe existence and the activity of free vocational associations, that\r\nis to say, the unions of workers and employers, are not affected by\r\nthe institution of Councils. Article 165, par. 1, expressly recognizes\r\nvocational organizations of workers and employers. In theory the spheres\r\nin which the Councils and these organizations respectively move are\r\ndistinct, and the differences between them naturally result from the\r\ndifference in the aims of the two organizations. After the Constitution,\r\nas well as before, these unions of employés and workers had as their\r\nfunction the regulation of the conditions of labour and of wages with\r\nthe aid of collective agreements; whereas the Workers Councils and the\r\nEconomic Councils are concerned with questions other than the contractual\r\ndetermination of the conditions of labour and wages. But we shall soon\r\nsee that in practice this separation is extremely difficult to maintain\r\nand that it gives rise to considerable difficulties between the Councils\r\nand the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--FACTORY WORKERS COUNCILS.\r\n\r\nI.--Of the different organisms provided by the Constitution, which shall\r\nbe created first?\r\n\r\nSome wanted to start from above. They wanted, said these, to organize\r\nfirst the National Economic Council, and to charge it immediately with\r\nthe important functions attributed to it by the Constitution, as in the\r\nconditions prevailing in Germany at present these powers should not\r\nremain without titular direction. They desired also that the National\r\nEconomic Council prepare and propose the bills necessary for the\r\norganization of inferior councils. In other words, the National Economic\r\nCouncil was asked to be the Constituent Assembly for the future Economic\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nOthers wanted to commence from below, so as to erect the edifice\r\nprogressively, and not to construct an upper story before the one below\r\nit was sufficiently built to afford a solid foundation.\r\n\r\nIt was the latter opinion that prevailed. On August 9, 1919, the Cabinet\r\nannounced a bill creating the Factory Workers Councils. It was urgent,\r\nsaid the Cabinet, that these Councils be created first, because there\r\nalready existed in many enterprises Workers Councils; some of them had\r\nbeen created by the provisions of collective contracts, others by the\r\nwill of the workers which had made itself felt during the Revolution, but\r\nboth kinds of Workers Councils lacked altogether a legal standing.\r\n\r\nThe bill expressed the idea that the power, hitherto accorded to the\r\nCommittees of Salaried Employés and Wage-Earners should be transferred\r\nto the Factory Workers Councils, but that these powers should be\r\nconsiderably enlarged. This bill was such as could be expected from a\r\nCabinet in which there co-operated, in addition to the Social Democrats,\r\nthe Centre and Democrats. It corresponded to the economic and social\r\nideas of the trade unionists of all shades, ideas evolutionary and not\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nFrom Right and Left the most strenuous criticisms were directed against\r\nthis bill.\r\n\r\nThe employers recognized that it was necessary to institute workers\r\nrepresentation in each industry and enterprise, and they accepted\r\nthe creation of the Councils, in which both employers and workers\r\nwould be represented, which would discuss questions of work and wage,\r\nwhich would supervise the execution of collective bargains and which\r\nwould serve as an intermediary between the workers and the bosses.\r\nBut they energetically rejected all measures that, under more or less\r\nroundabout devices, tended to recognize for the workers any right of\r\ncontrol whatever over production or the management of enterprises,\r\nsince merchants and manufacturers must above all have freedom of\r\noperation. They protested energetically against all provisions that gave\r\nthe Councils the right to intervene in the direction of business, in\r\nquestions of hiring and discharging; just as they rejected the proposals\r\nthat the workers be allowed to participate in the consideration of new\r\ntechnical methods, and that they, the employers, must submit their\r\nbalance sheets to the workers, reveal the amounts of their profits or\r\ntheir losses and admit workers as members in the Administrative Council.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the pure doctrine of the Councils, on the other hand,\r\ncriticized the Cabinet’s proposal for the opposite reason, because it\r\ndid not organize the real workers representation, but only Councils in\r\nwhich the employers and the workers have the same right. It is impossible\r\nto conciliate labour and capital, said they; for, the co-operation of\r\nthese two must inevitably end in the domination, by the employers, of the\r\nworkers. The Councils must be made up exclusively of workers who would\r\nhave an absolute right to control production. The powers given by the\r\nbill to the Councils were illusory; they would be only petty unions. The\r\nregulation of production would remain intact as before. These Councils\r\nwould be allowed to examine once a year the balance sheets of each\r\nestablishment, but they could not control the direction of its business,\r\nits purchases, its selling or its profits. The only real advantage would\r\nconsist of being able to discuss the questions of hiring and discharging.\r\n\r\nThus attacked and criticized the bill, after the most impassioned\r\ndiscussion,[63] after many important alterations, was finally adopted on\r\nJanuary 19, by a vote of 213 to 64. This is the law of February 4, 1920.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII.--The organization of the Factory Workers Councils must be supple\r\nenough to permit them to fulfil their mission, whatever the importance\r\nor the form of the factory may be. They must be neither too small nor\r\ntoo cumbersome; they must comprise both employers and employés; each of\r\nthese groups must be in position to defend its particular interests; the\r\nelectoral right must be wholly democratic and minorities must be insured\r\nrepresentation, which imposes the obligation of establishing proportional\r\nrepresentation; those delegated must always be guided by their duties as\r\nrepresentatives. As a consequence of the last, it must be provided that\r\nthe assembly of electors be enabled to withdraw its support from its\r\nrepresentatives and to recall them. The greater part of these conditions\r\nwas realized by the law of February 4.\r\n\r\nThe forms that the Factory Workers Councils may assume are extremely\r\ndiversified.\r\n\r\nThere is first of all the “Factory Workers Council,” properly so-called,\r\nwhich exists in every industrial or commercial unit and in all the\r\npublic and private administrations where there are at least twenty\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nThe wage-worker members of the Factory Workers Council constitute a\r\n“Workers Council” and the salaried employé members make up an “Employé\r\nCouncil.” If the Factory Workers Council has more than nine members\r\nit elects according to the principles of proportional representation\r\na “Factory Committee” of five members. If the Factory Workers Council\r\ncomprises both representatives of workers and of employés, each of these\r\ntwo groups must be represented in the Factory Committee.\r\n\r\nA “General Factory Workers Council” must be created for enterprises of\r\nthe same kind situated in the same locality or in adjoining localities\r\nand belonging to the same owners, if the Factory Workers Council in each\r\nplant so decide. This organization may either remain in juxtaposition\r\nwith the Factory Workers Councils of the different plants, or it may\r\nreplace them. In that case it functions as a common Factory Workers\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nA “shop chairman” must be elected in the place of a Factory Workers\r\nCouncil in establishments employing less than twenty workers, of whom at\r\nleast five must be electors.\r\n\r\nThere is finally a “Factory Assembly” composed of all the regular\r\nemployés of the factory. It is convened by the president of the Factory\r\nCouncil. He must convoke it if the employer or at least one-quarter of\r\nthe workers demand it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII.--The powers of the Factory Workers Councils are two kinds;\r\nsocial and economic. _With one or two exceptions they are both purely\r\ndeliberative in character._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOCIAL POWERS:\r\n\r\n(A) _Conditions of Work_.\r\n\r\n(1) The Factory Workers Council supervises the execution of legal\r\ndecrees, of collective bargains and of arbitration decisions in favour\r\nof the workers. The regulation of the conditions of work by collective\r\nbargaining remains the essential purpose of the Vocational Unions.\r\nThe Factory Workers Councils cannot and must not replace this general\r\ntrade union agreement by a regulation which would intervene between the\r\nworkers of any single factory and the management of that factory, for\r\nthe conditions of labour, particularly wage scales, must be fixed not\r\nsimply according to the conditions prevailing in any single factory, but\r\naccording to the general situation of the industry. On the other hand,\r\nthe Factory Workers Councils must see to it that the conditions of work\r\nagreed to between the manufacturer’s union and the labour organizations\r\nare strictly carried out, and must adjust any difficulties that may arise\r\nin their application. Each Council must perform the same function in\r\nregard to the execution of arbitration decisions and the carrying out\r\nof legislative regulatory provisions relative to the condition of the\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n(2) The Factory Workers Councils co-operate in the fixing of wages\r\nand other conditions of work, when these questions are not settled by\r\ncollective agreement. But it is understood that, even in such a case,\r\nthe Factory Workers Councils must act in accord with the Trade Unions\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n(3) They co-operate with the employer in the adoption of rules for the\r\nfactory within the framework of the collective bargains in operation.\r\n\r\n(4) They examine the questions of pensions for wounded veterans and\r\ncompensation for those hurt in course of work.\r\n\r\n(5) They establish in agreement with the employers rules concerning the\r\nhiring of wage-earners and salaried employés and they have the right to\r\noppose their discharge. In the respect to the former, the law specifies\r\nthat the rules relative to hiring must contain no provision by virtue\r\nof which the hiring of a worker would be affected by his political,\r\nmilitary, religious or union activities. When these rules permit it, the\r\nright of the Factory Workers Council, in so far as it concerns the hiring\r\nof a worker, is waived and it is the boss or his representative who\r\nthereafter decides in each particular case of hiring. But if the boss or\r\nhis representative violates the rule of contract, the Council of Workers\r\nor the Council of Employés may raise a protest. If an agreement is not\r\nthereupon reached between the boss and the council, the difficulty is\r\ntaken before the competent Arbitration Committee which decides finally.\r\nOn the other hand, in regard to discharges, the law of February 9 gives\r\nto the discharged worker the right to appeal it to the Workers Council,\r\nand, if an agreement is not reached by this Council, to appeal to the\r\nArbitration Committee in any of the following circumstances: (a) If\r\nthe discharge is due to the fact that the worker is active in certain\r\npolitical, military, denominational or trade union matters or that he\r\nbelongs or does not belong to this or that political, denominational, or\r\nlabour organization; (b) if the discharge is without cause; (c) if the\r\nworker is discharged because he has refused to do any piece of work other\r\nthan that agreed upon when he was hired; (d) if the discharge appears\r\nparticularly severe, and justified neither by the attitude of the worker\r\nnor by the situation in the industry.\r\n\r\n(B) _Differences between Employers and Workers._\r\n\r\nThe Factory Workers Councils maintain harmony among the workers as well\r\nas between them and the employer, and insure the liberty of organization\r\namong the workers. They must help avoid all troubles or disorders that\r\nmay make difficulties between the employers and the workers, and if such\r\narise, they must abate the trouble as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is not the part of the Factory Workers Councils to take sides in\r\neconomic disputes in favour of this or that tendency. It is the organ of\r\nall the workers of any industry taken together, and it must permit any\r\nlabour organization, no matter to what tendency it belongs, to enjoy all\r\nthe rights and all the control to which it is entitled.\r\n\r\n(C) _The Well-Being of the Workers._\r\n\r\n(1) The Factory Workers Councils must combat the dangers of occupational\r\naccidents and diseases.\r\n\r\n(2) They must co-operate in the creation of pension funds, the building\r\nof workers’ homes, and other institutions of well-being in the factory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nECONOMIC POWERS.--(1) The Factory Workers Council aids by its technical\r\nadvice the employer in giving the factory as high an economic efficiency\r\nas possible, and co-operates in introducing in the factory new methods\r\nof work. This co-operation on the part of the Factory Workers Council\r\nassumes that the employer keeps it in touch with the condition in the\r\nindustry and with the most important events in it. The Council may\r\ntherefore demand that the employer supply the Factory Committee, or the\r\nCouncil with all the necessary information on the work and the condition\r\nof workers, and that he show the pay-rolls--for the purpose of checking\r\nup with the schedules agreed upon by collective contracts--and all other\r\ndocuments necessary for the supervision of the execution of collective\r\nagreements. This right of inspection is limited in two respects. On\r\nthe one hand, the Factory Workers Council can only examine records on\r\nthe economic aspects of the factory, thus excluding all political,\r\nunion, militarist, denominational, scientific or other investigations\r\non the part of the Councils. On the other hand, the law specifies that\r\nthis right of examination must not be exercised in such a way that it\r\njeopardizes secrets of the factory or commerce. The question remains as\r\nto what must be understood as a secret of the factory or of commerce;\r\nthis must be settled by judicial decision. From the first moment\r\ncommentators on the law of February 4th, held that business contracts,\r\nrecords of profits and loss, the schedules and pay-rolls, estimates of\r\nnet cost, and the purchase price of raw material are not questions that\r\nthe Factory Workers Councils are forbidden to investigate. In addition\r\nthe employer must at least once every quarter furnish the Factory Workers\r\nCouncil with a report on the situation and the progress in general of\r\nthe factory, on its output and on its prospective needs in the way\r\nof workers. Finally the Factory Council may demand that every year a\r\nbalance sheet for the factory and a statement of profit and loss for\r\nthe preceding year shall be submitted to the Factory Committee, or the\r\nCouncil, if there is no Factory Committee.\r\n\r\n(2) In the factories that have Administrative Councils,[64] the\r\nwage-earners and salaried employés are represented on these councils by\r\none or two delegates. This representation of workers on Administrative\r\nCouncils has aroused among the employers the liveliest opposition.\r\nThe Cabinet’s project provided that the worker representatives have\r\nthe same rights and duties as the other members of the Administrative\r\nCouncils. But the National Assembly has not followed the Cabinet on this\r\npoint and has limited the power of the workers’ representatives in the\r\nAdministrative Council to the mere statement of the interests and claims\r\nof the workers, and to the execution of their votes and wishes concerning\r\nthe organization of the factory. In addition this representation must\r\nbe regulated by a special law, and, until such a law is passed, that of\r\nFebruary 4 confines itself to prescribing that the representatives of the\r\nworkers have a seat and voice in all the meetings of the Administrative\r\nCouncil, but that they receive no remuneration other than the pay for the\r\ntime of attendance at the meetings. They are obliged to keep confidential\r\nwhat they learn at the meetings of the Council. The underlying spirit\r\nintended for the workers’ representation in the Administrative Council\r\nis indicated as follows: “The granting of so extensive a power, changing\r\nthe right of co-deliberation generally accorded to the working class\r\ninto a right of codecision, is proposed in the conviction that nothing\r\nis better calculated to increase the love of work, the sentiment of\r\nresponsibility and the output of industries than the right accorded to\r\nworkers to co-operate under their own responsibility in the supreme\r\ndirection of the factories.”\r\n\r\nOne cannot conclude the study of the economic powers of the Factory\r\nWorkers Councils without saying a word on the question of the\r\nco-operation of these Councils in the socialization process. The\r\nsupporters of the theory of Councils have always forcefully insisted on\r\nthis co-operation to justify the necessity of giving the maximum power\r\npossible to the Factory Workers Council. But the law of February 4 does\r\nnot grant these councils in economic matters anything but powers of\r\ndeliberation, hardly even conceding them the right of decision; nor does\r\nit give them any privilege other than that of supporting and helping\r\ntheir employers in the achievement of the factory’s purposes. Thereby\r\nis denied all action on the part of the Factory Workers Councils that\r\nmight directly influence the socialization of the factory itself. The\r\nlaw of February 4 seems to take the point of view opposed to that of\r\nsocialization.\r\n\r\nSocialization is a work relegated exclusively to the State and\r\nlegislation. It cannot be included in the mission of the workers’\r\nrepresentations in a factory. To socialize is to modify economic\r\norganization and the right of property, and this change cannot be\r\nmade except by law. Further, no particular factory can be socialized\r\nof itself, that is to say, be transformed by itself into the property\r\nof a community. The work of socialization must be undertaken by whole\r\ndivisions of industry. To accomplish this work it is not the Factory\r\nWorkers Councils that are competent, but only the parliamentary\r\nrepresentation of the whole people.\r\n\r\nHowever, among the partisans of the Factory Workers Councils, some\r\nhope that these Councils will be able to give the workers a socialist\r\neducation by affording them the chance to participate in economic\r\naffairs. They believe that, thanks to the Workers Councils, there will\r\nfinally be formed a working class ready, under responsibility, to fulfil\r\nadministrative duties in a socialist commonwealth. The Factory Workers\r\nCouncils according to them will be a school for socialism.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE COUNCILS.\r\n\r\nSuch, in outline, is the law of February 4, 1920. The first elections\r\nof the Factory Workers Councils were held during the month of May that\r\nfollowed. Immediately there broke out disputes and rivalries, more\r\nviolent than before, between the Trade Unions and the partisans of the\r\nCouncils systems over the rôle which the Factory Workers Councils should\r\nplay, and particularly over the relations that should subsist between\r\nthese Councils and the Trade Unions.\r\n\r\nThe union leaders wanted to maintain their traditional policy, “the wage\r\npolicy” of the joint committee and the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_. They held\r\nthat economic and social reforms can only be accomplished progressively,\r\ngiven the complexity of economic phenomena, and they were convinced that\r\nthe necessary evolution will take place naturally, thanks to co-operation\r\nof employers’ and employés’ organizations in the _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_.\r\n\r\nThe development of these organisms since the revolution seems to support\r\ntheir opinion. On the basis of agreements concluded in December, 1918,\r\nthe _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_ have taken on considerable extension.\r\nLittle by little the organisms provided by the statute of December\r\n4, 1918, have been created and expanded. Not only have individual\r\n_Arbeitsgemeinschaften_ been established between employers’ and\r\nemployés’ organizations, but these have also been formed into larger\r\ngroups. For example, the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ of the Ruhr mines, those\r\nof the Sarre, of Saxony and of Upper Silesia have united into a central\r\n_Arbeitsgemeinschaft_, that represents the interests of the whole coal\r\nmining industry of Germany. It is administered by a Central Council\r\ncomposed, of course, of equal numbers of employer and worker delegates.\r\nA great number of other industries have organized on the same model\r\nand they, too, have added above the local organs a Central Council\r\nthat represents the general vocational interests. Finally, the Central\r\nCommittees of the different industries have joined and thus created on\r\nDecember 12, 1919, a central _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_, which constitutes\r\nthe supreme organization and which is charged with settling by direct\r\nagreements between employers and employés and on a parity basis all the\r\nproblems that touch the life of the industries and trades in Germany.\r\nThis is sub-divided into fourteen vocational groups: iron, provisions,\r\nconstruction, textile, clothing, paper, leather, transports, glass and\r\nceramics, chemistry, oils and fats, forest and land workers, mines and\r\nlumber. The Central Executive Committee (Central Vorstand) is composed\r\nof twenty-three members chosen by the employers and twenty-three by the\r\nworkers. Other Committees are created on which the Central Committee\r\nplaces part of its work. Seven such have already been constituted, on the\r\nstudy of wages, labour legislation, economic policy, raw material, coal\r\nand transports, tariffs, the execution of the treaty of peace and the\r\ninternal regulations of the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_.\r\n\r\nAll this movement, say the trade unions, represent undeniable progress.\r\nFor the hostile interests of employer and employé is substituted the\r\n_interest of the vocation as a whole_, which creates in the employers\r\nand workers of the same vocation a consciousness of the community of\r\ntheir interests and engenders among the different industries a fruitful\r\nrivalry. In uniting the _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_ of all the industries,\r\nconflicting interests are placed in equilibrium and neutralized and there\r\nremains only common consciousness of national interests.\r\n\r\nWhat can the Factory Workers Councils do otherwise than enter into the\r\nframework of already existing organisms and, directed by the Trades\r\nUnions, aid in the development of these organisms? In other words,\r\nthe Factory Workers Councils--and this is also the formal will of the\r\nlegislator--should be the _delegates of the Trades Unions in each\r\nfactory_ to supervise there the application of the agreements adopted by\r\nthe Trades Unions and the employers associations. In addition what could\r\nthe Factory Workers Councils do if they had not behind them the power of\r\nthe strong organizations of the Trades Unions? A Factory Workers Council,\r\nthat could not count on the support of a strong union, could exercise\r\nno useful activity whatever. It would be soft wax in the hands of the\r\nemployers. If they want to do efficacious work, the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils, even though they are the direct emanation from the workers of\r\nthe factory, must conduct themselves as organs of the Trade Union, and\r\ncan only play an important rôle if they march hand in hand with the Trade\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThis dependence of the Factory Workers Councils on the Trade Union gives\r\nrise naturally to two considerations. _The Factory Workers Council is\r\nwithout resources_, whereas the Trade Union is rich; the one cannot\r\nundertake anything without the aid of the other. But naturally it will\r\nnot obtain this aid unless it submits to the guidance given it. On\r\nthe other hand, in order to discuss adequately with the employer the\r\ndifficult problems that come within the authority of the Factory Workers\r\nCouncil, there is required a preliminary education which the worker does\r\nnot possess unless he has had long experience in Trade Union life. He\r\noften lacks the knowledge and the experience which cannot be acquired\r\nexcept slowly and in the school of the Trade Unions. For this reason\r\nalso, the Factory Workers Councils should follow Trade Union direction.\r\n\r\nThe champions of the system of Councils do not concede this subordination\r\nof the Factory Workers Councils to the Trade Unions. There is an\r\nessential difference between the two, they declare. The Trade Union has\r\nas its exclusive mission the preparation and the direction of struggles\r\nfor wages and conditions of work _under the régime of capitalist\r\nproduction_. The Factory Workers Council is _warring for a new system of\r\nproduction_. And its mission is to prepare the working class to take into\r\nits own hands the direction of production. That is why the _organization\r\nof the Factory Workers Council must be independent of the Trades Unions,\r\nand must develop outside of the framework of the Trades Unions_.\r\n\r\nThe task which the Factory Workers Councils must accomplish and which\r\nmust serve as the basis of all their future activity, is to achieve a\r\nunity of front of the whole working class. The Trade Unions have not yet\r\nbrought themselves to take the initiative in this fundamental reform.\r\nAt the present time workers are still scattered among approximately\r\nfifty Trades Unions, which are divided still further into a number of\r\nsections and branches. There is an inextricable network of collective\r\ncontracts, “tariffs,” and wage agreements down to the smallest labour\r\ngroup, representing a great amount of work; but this cannot in the least\r\nameliorate the economic condition of the working class.\r\n\r\nOne thing must immediately be abolished, the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_,\r\nbecause it is contrary to the doctrine of the class struggle, and\r\nbecause, under the pretext of co-operation, it insures the domination of\r\nthe capitalist over the worker.\r\n\r\nAs for the Trades Unions, the champions of the Factory Workers Council\r\nrecognize that the latter, although working on a different plan,\r\nmust remain in intimate contact with the former. But there is an\r\nindispensable reform to be realized. Organization by trades must be\r\nreplaced by organization by industries or factories. In other words,\r\nall the vocations functioning at the same time in the same industry\r\nmust be grouped within the same organization. In still other words,\r\nthe separation of wage-earners associations from the associations of\r\nsalaried employés must be done away with. On the contrary, all manual\r\nand intellectual workers of the same industry must join together and\r\nconsecrate all their efforts to a common end.\r\n\r\nFinally, declared the partisans of the Councils, the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils cannot remain isolated in the various separate industries. They\r\ncan only fulfil their function if they unite in district assemblies and\r\norganize in such a way as to create a “Central Organ of the Factory\r\nWorkers Councils,” which will direct the activity of all the Factory\r\nWorkers Councils of Germany.\r\n\r\nThese arguments were not without effect on the Trades Union leaders.\r\nThey still maintained, naturally, the principle that the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils must enter into the Trade Union organization and that they must\r\nremain an organ of the latter. But they declared themselves ready to\r\naccept a great part of the reforms demanded by their critics.\r\n\r\nMoreover the General Federation of Labour and the General Federation\r\nof Salaried Employés organized “A Central Union of the Factory Workers\r\nCouncil,” whose purpose is to unite the Factory Workers Councils with\r\nthe unions of wage-earners and salaried employés, and to incorporate\r\nthem into the whole Trade Union organization. To this end they undertook\r\na complete local organization of the Factory Workers Councils. First\r\nthe District Committees of the Trades Unions were to proceed to a\r\nredistribution of the Factory Workers Councils into fifteen industrial\r\ngroups. Each industrial group was to decide independently on the matters\r\nthat concern the vocations included in this group. The Group Council\r\nhad to include a member of the Trade Union or of the corresponding\r\nunion of salaried employés. This organization by groups was to insure\r\nthe co-operation of Factory Workers Councils on an industry basis, and\r\nthus attempt to meet the criticisms of partisans of the Councils. Above\r\nthe different industrial groups three organs were provided which would\r\nrepresent the Factory Workers Councils as a whole: the General Assembly\r\nof all the Factory Workers Councils, the Central Council, and the Central\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Trade Union organization of the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils would be to give the latter a Trade Union direction and\r\ndevelopment, to unite in the factories all economic and social forces\r\navailable, and to utilize these forces for the defence of the common\r\ninterests of all workers. There is thus a division of labour between the\r\ntraditional mission of the Trade Union branches and that of their local\r\ncommittees, on whom would be still incumbent the duties of specifically\r\nTrade Union organization, whereas questions of general, social and\r\neconomic policy would be given over to the “Central Factory Workers\r\nCouncil.” It follows that the two parallel organizations must work hand\r\nin hand and must consult each other on all questions, thus doing away\r\nwith all possibility of conflict.\r\n\r\nSuch was the plan, duly elaborated by the Trade Unions, which at this\r\ntime is submitted for discussion in common by the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils and the Vocational Associations of Germany. Naturally, it is\r\nimpossible to foretell what will result from these deliberations. All\r\nthat can be said at present is that the members of the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils are almost exclusively elected from among the wage-earners and\r\nsalaried employés _already active in the Trade Unions_, and thus the\r\nconception to which the Trade Unions seem to cling above everything else,\r\nthe incorporation of the Factory Workers Councils into the Trade Union\r\nassociations, seems destined to be realized of its own accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--THE PROVISIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nThese discussions, these vacillations, these difficulties, have up to\r\nnow prevented the government from submitting the necessary projects of\r\nlaws for the creation and organization of Councils, other than Factory\r\nWorkers Councils, provided for by the Constitution. In May, 1920, there\r\nwas an attempt to propose a law on “Local Workers Councils.” But the\r\ngovernment declared that it had not yet arrived at a clear conception of\r\nthe relations between the Factory Workers Councils, the future Economic\r\nCouncils and the employers’ organizations, and that it was still pursuing\r\nits studies.\r\n\r\nIn view of the impossibility of continuing the building of the structure\r\nfrom below, it was decided to change the method and, returning to the\r\nsystem rejected the year before, resignedly the attempt was made to\r\ncontinue from above. There was thus created a “Provisional Economic\r\nCouncil.”\r\n\r\nThe organization of this Council, provisional as it must be, has not\r\nproceeded without presenting great difficulties, which it is interesting\r\nto sum up.\r\n\r\nI.--This Council must consist of the representatives of all economic,\r\nagricultural, commercial, and industrial interests. The first question\r\nthat came up was to fix the number of representatives to be allowed\r\nto each different interest. Naturally, violent conflicts arose, each\r\ninterest fighting for the largest representation possible. Instead\r\nof establishing a proportion based on the respective importance of\r\nthe various vocations in German economic life, and of holding to this\r\nproportion, the Cabinet increased the total number of members of the\r\nEconomic Council as fast as this or that interest claimed a stronger\r\nrepresentation, with the result that the number of representatives,\r\noriginally fixed at a hundred, increased to 280 and finally became 326.\r\nIt is clear that the resulting proportion that came from these successive\r\nincreases favours agriculture to the detriment of industry and the\r\nmiddle classes.\r\n\r\nA place was given to the representatives of consumers; unwisely,\r\naccording to some critics. For one can understand the adding of the\r\nconsumers to the assembly of the producers of some one single industrial\r\ngroup, that of coal, for example, which grows always at the expense\r\nof the consumers. But in the Economic Council, all industries and\r\nvocations are by definition represented; the producers in one industry\r\nare the consumers in all the others and it is unnecessary to add to\r\nthem, in order to represent the interests of consumers, additional\r\nrepresentatives, who by hypothesis are only consumers.\r\n\r\nThe 326 members of the Economic Council are allotted as follows:\r\n\r\n    68 representatives of agriculture and forestry.\r\n    6 representatives of market industries and fisheries.\r\n    68 representatives of general industry.\r\n    44 representatives of commerce, banks and insurance.\r\n    34 representatives of transport enterprises.\r\n    36 representatives of small business and small industries.\r\n    30 representatives of consumers (municipalities, consumers’\r\n       associations and organizations of women).\r\n    16 representatives of civil servants and the professions.\r\n    24 other persons named by the government.\r\n\r\nII.--There then followed the question of how the delegates of each\r\ngroup are to be appointed. The discussion reverted to the question\r\nwhether these delegates should be appointed by vocation or region.\r\nWhere employers and workers were grouped, the principle of parity was\r\nnaturally adhered to. Agriculture, for example, which is entitled to 44\r\ndelegates, was represented by 22 land owners and 22 agricultural workers.\r\nOn the other hand, the mode of nomination in all groups representing\r\nworkers offered but few problems, for--at least until the Factory Workers\r\nCouncils have united and become organized geographically over the whole\r\nReich--the only labour organizations are those of the Trade Unions;\r\nthat is to say, organizations almost exclusively vocational, and the\r\nlabour delegates to the Economic Council cannot be elected except by\r\nmeans of these organizations. But the problem became much more complex\r\nin the case of the election of representatives of employers and property\r\nowners. These had, in addition to their industrial associations, organs\r\nof regional representation, such as chambers of commerce, chambers of\r\nagriculture, boards of trade, etc. Should their delegates throughout be\r\nelected by regional organs or by associations? The Reichsrat replied, by\r\nchambers of commerce; and the National Assembly declared for associations.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of representation by chambers of commerce pointed out\r\nthat these chambers are, according to existing legislation, the only\r\nrepresentatives of industry and of commerce in public law; that\r\nthey embrace all the industrial and commercial circles, considered\r\nvocationally as well as regionally, and that they constitute an electoral\r\nbody more complete than the organizations on a purely professional basis;\r\nand that, in contrast to the associations, the chambers of commerce are\r\nelected by all the manufacturers and merchants inscribed on the register\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the associations replied that, great as was the service\r\nrendered by the Chambers of Commerce as local and regional corporations,\r\nthey play almost no rôle whatever in the public economy of Germany. Their\r\ninfluence on economic management is practically nil; and they are limited\r\nin the matter of projects for new laws, to the voting of resolutions that\r\nhave no outcome whatever. The special business associations, however,\r\nalthough without official standing in public law, are acquiring more and\r\nmore importance in the public economy of Germany. What is most important\r\nis to make up the Economic Council of “heads”--of the most eminent men\r\nfrom each industry, whether of the North or the South, the West or the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe solution adopted does not seem to have been a particularly happy\r\none. Of the sixty-eight industrial delegates, forty-eight represent\r\nvocational divisions and twenty represent regional groups. Of the first,\r\nforty-two are designated by the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_ of the employers\r\nand industrial workers of Germany (twenty-one employers and twenty-one\r\nworkers); six others represent the Council of Coal and the Council of\r\nPotash. Of the regional representatives, twenty employers are named by\r\nthe Chambers of Commerce and of Agriculture but twenty workers are named\r\nby the labour element of the Central _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_.\r\n\r\nIII.--The authority of the Provisional Economic Council is not quite the\r\nsame as that of the final Economic Council, provided by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt must, and that was its essential mission, construct the framework on\r\nwhich the future Economic Council is to be erected, and determine how it\r\nshall be elected. This necessitates its organizing in advance Workers\r\nCouncils, aside from Factory Workers Councils, and Economic Councils for\r\neach locality, which, according to the Constitution, must contribute to\r\nthe formation of the National Economic Council.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Provisional Economic Council must examine the projects\r\nof all important laws, economic and social in nature, that the Cabinet\r\nis required to submit to it for advice before placing them before the\r\nParliament. It must be heard on proposals for decrees and important\r\nregulations. It has itself the right to present proposals for laws.\r\n\r\nThese powers are the same as those projected for the final Economic\r\nCouncil. But the two differ in an important respect. Whereas, according\r\nto the Constitution, the Economic Council will have the right, when it\r\ndiffers in opinion from the Cabinet, to present its point of view by\r\none of its members before the Reichstag, it has not been considered\r\nfeasible, for constitutional reasons, to recognize the same right for\r\nthe Provisional Economic Council.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, the Provisional Economic Council is considered as\r\nalready constituting an Economic Parliament, and at the commencement of\r\nits work[66] it was so regarded by the press.\r\n\r\nIt does not deserve this name, for it has no power of decision. It\r\nis purely and simply a technical Council that advises the Cabinet on\r\nprincipal economic questions. It differs from ordinary technical Councils\r\nin that instead of being appointed most of its members are elected. One\r\ncannot therefore criticize it from the point of view of formal democracy,\r\nin the way that any parliament composed according to the parity principle\r\ncan be criticized, viz., that each employer-member represents much fewer\r\nelectors than the worker-members. As it is here a matter of a council\r\nof experts, the most important thing was to gather the best qualified\r\nauthorities of the whole country. It is evident, therefore, that in the\r\npresent state of affairs such authorities are found much more easily\r\namong employers than among workers. The relative proportion of these two\r\nelements within the Provisional Economic Council matters little since\r\ndecision lies exclusively with the assembly elected by universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the importance of the services that the Economic\r\nCouncil can be called upon to render must not be underestimated. It\r\nis undeniable that, as at present composed, it has gathered together\r\nnearly all the men considered in Germany to-day as the most experienced\r\nand trained authorities in economic matters. It must not be lost sight\r\nof also that a great number of these men, aside from their individual\r\nimportance, have behind them the support of the whole force of the\r\nextremely powerful vocational and economic associations by which they\r\nwere elected.\r\n\r\nOne immediate danger menaces the Economic Council. It is that the men\r\nwho compose it will let themselves be guided on the technical questions\r\nthey are to examine by party considerations. It may be divided--as\r\nis natural--into groups of employers, groups of workers, groups of\r\nagriculturalists, industrialists, and merchants. If it turns out to be\r\nan assembly of conservatives, democrats, Catholics and socialists, it is\r\ndoomed to sterility.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Economic Council avoids this danger it will render,\r\nfirst of all, the service of clarifying the political atmosphere itself.\r\nThe members will defend very legitimately only the interests by which\r\nthey were charged with representation. In this way economic groups will\r\nnot need to act indirectly through the intermediate agency of political\r\nrepresentatives. They will be able to express their point of view clearly\r\nand support their interests directly. The political parties, too, will\r\ngain thereby; for they will be freed of all considerations of interest\r\nand they will no longer have to complicate technical problems by imposing\r\non them their general political conceptions. As for the authority that\r\nwill accrue to the Economic Council, it depends entirely on itself\r\nwhether it will be nullified or preponderant, and its future lies in its\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nFormer Under-Secretary of State, von Delbrück said before the National\r\nAssembly--speaking, it is true, of the Economic Council to be organized\r\nby the Constitution, but the Provisional Economic Council is nevertheless\r\nits precursor--that the Economic Council is without doubt, by the side of\r\nthe Reichstag and the Reichsrat, a third legislative assembly. For such\r\nan assembly, “called upon to deliberate on the most important questions\r\nin the national life, will necessarily have a natural tendency to enlarge\r\nits powers. We are undoubtedly on the eve of a period in which the\r\nReichstag and the Reichsrat will be considered as one side of a balance,\r\nand the Economic Council as the other. Behold in this a wholly new\r\npolitical evolution. There will come a day when the Economic Council will\r\nseek to become the heir of the Reichsrat and to take its place.”\r\n\r\nWill this prediction be realized? It will if the Economic Council is able\r\nto render the government and the people the services they expect of it.\r\nIt will not if it does not deserve to be heard by them and does not know\r\nhow to make itself heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nSOCIALIZATION\r\n\r\nIn order to reconstruct in Germany the public and private economy\r\ndestroyed by the war and the revolution, it is not enough to give the\r\nproducers a special right to co-operate in the regulation of economic\r\nquestions; nor to recognize particularly for the working class the right\r\nof co-deliberation in the determination of these matters. It is hoped\r\nthat such measures will increase production. But it is also necessary\r\nthat no part of production be lost and that all of it be utilized to the\r\nutmost for the community. One is thus led to inquire whether the system\r\nof production and the distribution of wealth, such as prevails under a\r\ncapitalist régime, is capable even if improved, of attaining such an\r\nend; whether it were not better to substitute a new system, socialist or\r\nnot, giving the utmost guarantee that production will benefit the entire\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWe must inquire what attitude the Constituent Assembly took on this\r\nquestion and what solution it adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--THE PROBLEM OF SOCIALIZATION.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of the Revolution, power passed entirely into the hands\r\nof socialists, that is to say, by definition, men whose programme may\r\nbe summed up in these words: the abolition of private property and the\r\ntaking over by the state of all the means of capitalist production.\r\n\r\nThe Independents undoubtedly would have set about at once the task of\r\nrealizing this programme. But we have seen that they had but a brief\r\nperiod of power; and the Social Democrats seemed less in a hurry to keep\r\ntheir promises.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the political revolution was enough to absorb all their\r\nactivity, and they postponed the economic revolution. They declared\r\nthat an industry cannot be socialized until it is “ripe” for such a\r\nmeasure. But, they further declared, this maturity cannot be suddenly\r\neffected by a vote of Parliament or even by the decision of the majority\r\nof the people. It is the product of a slow social development, which\r\nmay find its expression in the vote of a majority, but which cannot be\r\nthereby hastened. To tell the truth, the Social Democrats, whom events\r\nhad placed with their back to the wall, perceived how difficult it is\r\nto put into practice the vague theories with which they had heretofore\r\ncontented themselves. Not only did they realize that the solution of\r\neconomic questions raised by socialization is extremely difficult, but\r\nthey became also convinced that it was necessary first to consolidate\r\nsome of the elements of German economic life that had survived the war\r\nand its unhappy conclusion before proceeding to experiments which might\r\naccomplish their ruin. They resolved therefore to study the problems of\r\nsocialization more deeply before passing to its realization. For this\r\npurpose they created, November, 1918, a “Committee on Socialization”\r\nwhich was not to be an official organ but a free scientific committee\r\ncharged with the drawing up of reports and proposals on the question of\r\nsocialization. It consisted of eleven members with Kautsky as chairman.\r\n\r\nBut the impatience of the masses did not give the Socialist Cabinet the\r\nrespite they required. The people, who for years had been promised the\r\nabolition of private capitalist property, and who saw in the realization\r\nof the Socialist programme the end of the miserable situation into\r\nwhich the war and the revolution had plunged them, demanded immediate\r\nmeasures. The general strike which broke out in Berlin in March,\r\n1919, and which, as we have seen, prompted the Cabinet to promise the\r\n“anchorage” of the Councils in the Constitution, also pushed it to\r\nprepare in haste two projects of law--one on socialization, the other\r\non the regulation of the coal industry, the two projects being adopted\r\nwithin a few days by the National Assembly. The two laws carried the date\r\nof March 23, 1919. The first is what is called in Germany a “blanket\r\nlaw” or a “skeleton law.” It indicates the different forms according to\r\nwhich socialization of private enterprises may become operative, and the\r\nconditions in which these enterprises, once socialized, may be exploited.\r\nThe second makes immediate application of these principles to the coal\r\nindustry. In addition another law voted several days later, April 29,\r\n1919, regulated according to the same principles the potash industry.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the members of the Committee on Socialization, who complained\r\nof having their work constantly impeded by the Cabinet, and their\r\nrecommendations remaining unheeded, handed in their resignations on April\r\n7, 1919.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Minister of Public Economy, the Social Democrat,\r\nRudolph Wissel, finding the measures for socialization taken or proposed\r\nby the Cabinet too timid and insufficient addressed a memorandum to the\r\nCouncil of Ministers on May 7, which had great reverberation throughout\r\nGermany as soon as it became known.[67]\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet, said Wissel, followed a policy inconsistent and without\r\nunity. Within the Council of Ministers a decision on fundamental\r\nquestions was avoided in order not to put the coalition in danger; and\r\nthe few measures taken were compromises dictated by necessity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the economic situation of Germany was in an almost desperate\r\nstate, and a menacing catastrophe could be avoided only by completely\r\ntransforming the system of production that prevailed in peace times.\r\nWissel declared that he was not speaking of expropriation, for that\r\nwould do no more than substitute the state for private capitalism, that\r\nis to say, one exploiter for another. But what he referred to was the\r\nrestriction of illegitimate profits, the regulation of prices and the\r\ncontrol of the distribution of profits. _Production and consumption\r\nmust be organized according to a co-ordinated plan_ in such a way that\r\nenterprises may be exploited in the interest of all and not to the\r\nexclusive profit of some. It was imperative to proceed by some solution\r\nas a whole and not by incoherent and isolated attempts.\r\n\r\nThe principal measures for which Wissel demanded immediate adoption were\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n(1) The organization of the system of Councils by a special law\r\nwithout waiting for the adoption of the Constitution. They must\r\ninclude organizations of workers and of employers, regional and\r\nvocational. These last, which would rest on the parity principle of the\r\n_Arbeitsgemeinschaft_, would have for their mission the direction of the\r\neconomy in the vocation they represented, this direction to follow the\r\nprinciples decreed by the Cabinet. There must be in addition an Economic\r\nCouncil, which will be the supreme organ of the whole German collective\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n(2) Other branches of production must be regulated on the model of the\r\nregulation already in operation for coal and potash. The next to be thus\r\nregulated must be electricity and the cereals.\r\n\r\n(3) The State must take a more and more important part in the functioning\r\nand in the profits of industrial enterprises. By an inheritance tax and\r\nby a tax on capital there must be put into the hands of the State a great\r\npart of the industrial fortunes. Instead of collecting these taxes in\r\nmoney or in war loans, the state must become the proprietor of part of\r\nthe enterprises in the form of shares.\r\n\r\n(4) The stocks and bonds of the industrial concerns of the State will be\r\nadministered not by a Minister, but by a national bank which will conduct\r\nits business according to purely economic rules to the exclusion of all\r\npolitical considerations.\r\n\r\nBy these last two measures will be realized what the supporters of this\r\nsystem call a “progressive mediatization of capital.”\r\n\r\n(5) There will be created funds of several billions of marks which will\r\nbe administered by an office acting in close relation with the vocational\r\neconomic organization and designed to procure employment for German\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n(6) The cost of necessities which Germany must import exceeds greatly\r\nthe cost of domestic commodities. This circumstance compels the increase\r\nof wages, which in turn causes the cost of living to rise and lowers the\r\nvalue of money. To counteract this part of all wages must be distributed\r\nhereafter in provisions, clothes, etc. Credits will be opened by\r\nfinanciers and by the State.\r\n\r\n(7) Temporarily the right to strike in certain industries vital to the\r\nGerman economy will be restricted. The right to stop work will have to be\r\nvoted by nine-tenths of those employed in that industry.\r\n\r\n(8) To realize this programme the number of Ministers who will occupy\r\nthemselves with economic questions will be reduced to three. They will\r\nconstitute within the Cabinet an “Economic Committee,” whose directions\r\nwill have to be followed absolutely by the political Ministers.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this project aimed at the realization of a state\r\nintermediate between capitalism and socialism.\r\n\r\nDefended only among the socialists by a small group of doctrinaires, this\r\nproject had against it at the same time the Independents, the bourgeois\r\nparties and the Social Democrats. The Independents opposed it because it\r\npermitted capital to survive. The bourgeois parties opposed it because\r\nthe supervised economy prevented the free play of economic factors\r\nand paralyzed initiative. The Social Democrats opposed it for fear of\r\ndissatisfying the Centre and the Democrats, of whom they had need to\r\nmaintain themselves in power. Particularly opposed to Wissel’s project\r\nwere the Trade Union conceptions supported in the Cabinet by the Minister\r\nof Food Supply, Robert Schmidt. He presented a counter-project which\r\nembodied the argument which the Socialists of the government opposed to\r\nthe theoreticians of socialism. The work of socialization, said they,\r\nmust be undertaken but slowly and the socialization of an industry must\r\nwait until that industry is sufficiently matured. This last conception\r\nprevailed and in July, 1919, Wissel resigned. Thereupon the offices of\r\nthe Minister of Public Economy and that of Food Supply were merged and\r\nRobert Schmidt given the unified post.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected, therefore, that the process of socialization would\r\nbe considerably slowed up. In fact, the Constitution of the month of\r\nAugust confined itself to specifying and enlarging in several respects\r\nthe principles of the law of socialization of March 23; and for several\r\nmonths there was only one law enacted along these lines, that of December\r\n31, 1919, on the socialization of electricity.\r\n\r\nBut once more the people intervened. It may be recalled that one of the\r\n“Eight Points” of the agreement imposed on the Cabinet by the Trade\r\nUnions after the _coup d’état_ by Kapp, provided that the Committee on\r\nSocialization be at once reconvened, that representatives of vocational\r\nassociations be added to it, that new industries be socialized and that\r\nthe socialization of industries already decreed be enforced.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with these engagements, the Cabinet in the beginning of\r\nMay, 1920, submitted to the Reichstag a project of law that provided for\r\nthe municipalization of a certain number of industrial enterprises, and\r\nreconvened the Committee on Socialization. The members of this committee,\r\nwho were authorized to add to their number new colleagues on the\r\ncondition that the total number of the members should not exceed thirty,\r\nwere given a double mission. First they were to study and clarify the\r\nfundamental principles of socialism, for the purpose of determining the\r\ngeneral lines along which the capitalist system should be transformed.\r\nThen they were to submit concrete and immediate proposals, which,\r\ninspired by the laws of collective economy, would permit the commonwealth\r\nto utilize directly the natural resources and the sources of power. The\r\ncommittee had also to study how the industries already socialized were\r\nfunctioning, what results had been attained and to propose, if necessary,\r\nall needful changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--THE COLLECTIVE ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nAll these labours, all these investigations, all these discussions of the\r\nproblem of socialization had one result. They have shown how confused,\r\neven among the socialists, is the concept of socialism; that behind the\r\nsame word may hide two economic systems extremely different, and that a\r\nwhole series of almost imperceptible gradations may exist between the\r\ncapitalist system and complete socialism.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution raises the following principle: Economic organization\r\nmust cease to be dominated by considerations of private interests in\r\norder that hereafter it may be inspired exclusively by considerations of\r\npublic interests. Private interests must be subordinated to collective\r\ninterests. The present economic régime, based on private ownership,\r\nmust be substituted by a new régime based on collective ownership\r\n(Gemeinwirtschaft). What is understood by this?\r\n\r\nIn its largest sense the expression “collective economy” may be defined\r\nas an organization, following a certain predetermined plan, of the\r\neconomic system of a country for the purpose, on the one hand, of\r\nobtaining as large an increase as possible in production by the union of\r\nall forces affecting economy; and, on the other hand, for the purpose\r\nof devoting a proper part of the product to the community or to its\r\nproductive members.[68] Thus a system of collective economy is any\r\nsystem that increases public influence in private enterprise, on the\r\ncondition that it results in a more just administration and distribution,\r\nparticularly in the cases of monopolized industries already organized\r\ninto trusts or cartels.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the principle of collective economy may be applied under\r\nthree different forms:\r\n\r\n(1) The State may take over immediately and entirely the ownership of the\r\nindustries it wishes to subject to the new régime, and direct by itself\r\nand alone, with the aid of its civil servants, the industries which it\r\nhas seized. _This is complete socialization._\r\n\r\n(2) The State may content itself with participating in the ownership\r\nof certain private enterprises. It owns, for example, a certain number\r\nof shares in a corporation. In such a case, it does not manage the\r\nenterprise wholly, but it has the right of codecision in the general\r\ndirection of affairs. _This is partial socialization._\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, the State may leave in the hands of individuals the\r\nownership of enterprises which it wishes to subject to the principles\r\nof collective economy; but it unites, if necessary by constraint, all\r\nthose that belong in one industry or in the same category of industries,\r\nsuch as chemistry, coal, metallurgy, etc. Thus united the enterprises\r\nare administered by means of organs in which are represented all the\r\ncategories of the population interested in it, such as owners, workers,\r\ntrade unionists, consumers, etc. These organs must be guided, in the\r\ndirection they give to this management, above all by a concern for the\r\ngeneral interests of the commonwealth. This is _collective economy_\r\nproperly so-called or _nationalization_.\r\n\r\nThis last form of collective economy is particularly interesting, be it\r\nsaid. For, on the one hand, it avoids the just criticisms of bureaucracy\r\nand exaction generally directed against socialism properly so-called.\r\nOn the other hand, it takes into account the principal demands of the\r\nworking class at the present time in recognizing for the workers the\r\nright to participate in the direction of business enterprises.[69]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not clearly choose between these three different\r\nmethods of applying the principles of collective economy in the large\r\nsense of the word. It declares all three possible and leaves to the\r\nordinary legislature, whenever it is desirable to regulate an industry\r\nin the general interest, the task of choosing the bearing it wishes to\r\ngive such regulations and the régime to which it wishes to subject the\r\nindustry in question.\r\n\r\n(1) In effect, according to the terms of Article 156 of the Constitution,\r\nthe Reich may transfer private business enterprises to public ownership,\r\nthat is to say, take over the property for the Reich, the States, or for\r\nthe municipalities.\r\n\r\n(2) The Reich may participate itself or have the States or the\r\nmunicipalities participate in the administration of these enterprises, or\r\nmay secure for itself in some other manner a decisive influence in these\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n(3) Or, finally, without taking to itself all or part of these\r\nenterprises the Reich may regulate, on the basis of autonomy and\r\naccording to the principles of collective economy, the production and the\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nIn this last case the Constitution specifies that the business\r\nenterprises which are made subject to a nationalization measure, shall\r\nform “an autonomous body” (Selbstverwaltungskörper). This is a new form\r\nin public law. The “autonomous body” is somewhat analogous to ordinary\r\npublic corporations. It administers itself with the organs necessary\r\nfor it. It enjoys great independence, but it is nevertheless subject\r\nto supervision by the State. Article 156, par. 2, of the Constitution\r\nspecifies that when legislation subjects a given industry to the system\r\nof nationalization and organizes the autonomous body it must constitute\r\nthe administrative organs of this body in such a way that there shall be\r\ninsured the co-operation of all the producing elements of the people, and\r\nthat the salaried employés and wage-earners participate in administration\r\nand that the production and distribution satisfy first of all the\r\ninterests of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThese organs form the Industrial Economic Councils which we have already\r\nexamined. An example will illustrate this hypothesis. Legislature\r\ndecides, for instance, to subject the chemical industry to the régime of\r\nthe collective economy. It combines, therefore, all the manufactories of\r\nchemical products into a sort of obligatory _cartel_, the bond uniting\r\nthe different manufactories being more or less close according to\r\ncircumstances. The system of administration by “autonomous bodies” will\r\nconsist of the institution of one or more organisms, such as Economic\r\nCouncils of the Chemical Industry, in which will be represented all the\r\nindividuals, associations and Councils interested, and which will manage\r\ntogether the German chemical industry. The chemical industry will thus\r\nform an autonomous body, that is to say, a sort of public corporation\r\nunder the supervision of the State. Further than this, however, it is\r\nnot possible at the present time to specify the distinctive traits of\r\nthis new legal category. We must wait until legislation has organized a\r\nnumber of autonomous bodies before we can state precisely their general\r\ncharacteristics and give them a place in the collective institutions\r\nof public law. Still less possible, naturally, is it to forecast the\r\neconomic consequences to which they may give rise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, the Constitution has not felt that it should give the ordinary\r\nlegislator absolute freedom to proceed according to his fancy to the\r\nenactment of measures for socialization more or less complete. It has\r\ntherefore provided certain limits on the exercise of the rights it\r\nconfers on the legislature.\r\n\r\n(1) Only the legislature of the Reich may enact socialization measures.\r\n\r\n(2) No industry may be socialized except when it is “ripe for this\r\nsocialization.” This is the so-called _maturity clause_.\r\n\r\n(3) Enterprises which the legislator wishes to organize as “autonomous\r\nbodies” may not be so proceeded against except “in case of urgent\r\nnecessity.”\r\n\r\nThese last two restrictions may seem very important. In reality, however,\r\nthey constitute a purely fictitious restraint; for the legislature is the\r\nsole judge, at any time that it wishes to socialize an industry, as to\r\nwhether that industry is “ripe” or not, and whether or not the case is\r\none of urgent necessity.\r\n\r\n(4) There remains finally the question of indemnity. As may well be\r\nimagined, during the discussion of the project of the socialization law\r\nas well as during the deliberations on the project of the Constitution,\r\nthis question was very vigorously discussed. The Socialist parties wanted\r\nno allusion made to this question in the text of the law or that of the\r\nConstitution. The bourgeois parties demanded that at least in the case\r\nof complete socialization the state should be absolutely obliged to\r\naccord an indemnity. It was impossible to arrive at agreement. So that\r\nalthough the principle of indemnity was incorporated, it was left to the\r\nlegislature, whenever it enacts a special law decreeing a socialization\r\nmeasure, to decide whether or not indemnity shall be accorded and to what\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the above provisions a certain number of industries\r\nhave been placed under the régime of collective ownership, where they are\r\nabout to be transformed.\r\n\r\nFor the coal, potash and iron industries the laws of March 23, of April\r\n29, 1919, and the regulation of April 1, 1920, have chosen the system of\r\ncollective ownership, properly so-called. That is to say, the industries\r\nof coal, potash and metallurgy, although to a very limited extent, have\r\nbeen organized into autonomous bodies, self-administering under the\r\nsupervision of the Reich.\r\n\r\nAs to electricity, the law of December 31, 1919, provides that electrical\r\nplants that have acquired a certain importance will become the property\r\nof the Reich, the latter, however, providing a suitable indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe project of the law relative to municipalization, finally, provides\r\nthat municipalities may, with the authorization of the Reich,\r\ntransfer to the régime of collective ownership private industries\r\nthat serve principally common local needs. Full authority is given\r\nthe municipalities over all that concerns transportation, water, gas,\r\ncinematographs, theatres, burial, baths, etc. These enterprises may be\r\neither taken over entirely as the property of the municipalities, or\r\nbe organized into autonomous bodies. In principle the municipality is\r\nrequired to indemnify in all such cases.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to examine here in full detail these or later laws. It\r\nis interesting, however, to devote several pages in describing in a very\r\ngeneral way, in view of the great importance of the coal industry at the\r\npresent time, the system into which it has been transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--THE REGULATION OF THE COAL INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nThe crisis in coal which to-day exists in almost every country in the\r\nworld has led the different governments to take various measures either\r\nto avert it or to diminish it. In general, coal mining has remained in\r\nthe domain of private economy. Distribution, however, has passed more or\r\nless completely into the domain of collective economy. The systems of\r\ndistribution to which the different countries have resorted are various.\r\nAccording to the given circumstances they adopt one or another of three\r\npossible modes of public economy. In France, the distribution of mined or\r\nimported coal is carried on by the state itself. In Germany it is done\r\nby a group of organisms in which are represented the various interested\r\nelements of the population, but in which provisionally the mine owners\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to study first the existing system in the coal industry\r\nin order to understand better the changes we are examining.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI.--As regulated by the law of March 23, 1919, and the decree of August\r\n21, of the same year, the mechanism of the coal industry consists of\r\nthree organs: the Colliers Association, the National Association, and the\r\nNational Coal Council.\r\n\r\nThe German Reich is divided into a certain number of coal mining\r\ndistricts. In each district all the mine owners associations must form\r\na Colliers Association. If this cannot be accomplished voluntarily the\r\nMinister of Public Economy promulgates the organization by means of a\r\ndecree. Each Colliers Association must have a Council of Administration,\r\nin which it is obligatory that the workers be allowed representation.\r\nIn addition, in the Councils of Administration of the five biggest\r\nassociations there must be admitted a representative of the salaried\r\nemployés. The Council of Administration has the authority commonly\r\naccorded to the councils of administration of stock companies by the\r\nCommercial Code; it appoints its own president. In the same way all the\r\nowners of gasworks that produce coke are united for the whole territory\r\nof the Reich into an Association of Coal-gas Manufacturers, formed on\r\nthe same model as the Colliers’ Associations.\r\n\r\nThe Colliers Associations, the association of Coal-gas Manufacturers and\r\nthe German states that belong, by virtue of ownership of mines, in the\r\nColliers Associations, are united into a _National Coal Association_.\r\nThis has a Council of Administration in which must be included three\r\nwage-earners and salaried employés and one representative of the\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n_The National Coal Council_ is composed of sixty members--representatives\r\nof the states, of mine owners organizations, wage-earners, office\r\nworkers, consumers, etc.[70] It is convened as often as conditions demand\r\nand at least once every six months. It must in addition be convened if\r\nat least ten of its members or the Minister of Public Economy of the\r\nReich demand it. It decides by majority vote. It creates three technical\r\ncommittees, The Economic Committee on Mining Construction, The Economic\r\nCommittee for the Utilization of Combustibles and The Social Committee\r\nof the Mines. Each member of the National Coal Council must belong to a\r\ncommittee. The cost of the administration of the National Coal Council\r\nand of its committees is borne by the National Colliers Associations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEach of these organs has its own special powers.\r\n\r\nThe National Coal Council directs the economy of combustibles, in which\r\nis included importation and exportation, according to the principles\r\nof collective economy under the supervision of the Reich. It must\r\napprove the charters according to which the Colliers Associations and\r\nthe National Coal Association are organized. The National Coal Council\r\nmay decree general policies for the administration of combustibles, in\r\nparticular for the abolition of unproductive enterprises and for the\r\nprotection of consumers. It sees to it that the National Coal Association\r\nand the technical committees of the Coal Council work according to the\r\nsame principles and in a coherent system. It may demand information\r\nfrom any of the organs that participate in the fuel industry; and the\r\nauthorities and committees are obliged to give it any assistance it\r\ndemands. The technical committee collect all important data based on\r\npractice and experience, study all matters that enter within their domain\r\nand prepare decisions for the National Coal Council.\r\n\r\n_The National Coal Association_ controls the application of the general\r\npolicies and decisions decreed by the National Coal Council and regulates\r\nthe details of the execution of these decrees. It must approve the\r\ngeneral conditions of the coal deliveries of the Colliers Association.\r\n_It establishes and publishes the selling prices of fuel, taking into\r\naccount proposals made by unions and the interests of the consumers._ On\r\nthis point it must insure the same treatment for the consumers’ societies\r\nas for the wholesalers, and see to it that each consumer, who takes at\r\nleast a full carload of coal at the mine or at the point of delivery,\r\nshall obtain fuel under predetermined conditions for cash payment.\r\nFinally, the National Coal Association has authority in questions of\r\nimport and export.\r\n\r\n_The Colliers Associations_ supervise the application of the decrees\r\nissued by the National Coal Council and by the National Coal Association,\r\nand, within the framework of these decrees, regulate the production,\r\nutilization and consumption on the part of their members. They,\r\nthemselves, sell the fuel which should be put at their disposal by their\r\nmembers, on the account of the latter. The powers of the Association of\r\nCoal-gas Manufacturers are similar.\r\n\r\nThe mining companies may raise claims and protests against the\r\nregulations of the Associations of which they are members, appealing\r\nto the National Coal Association and beyond that to the National Coal\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nIf any measure on the part of the National Coal Council, the National\r\nCoal Association, or of the Colliers Associations violates any vested\r\nright, the individual or the association injured is entitled to suitable\r\nindemnity. This indemnity may be sued for before ordinary tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Reich, the States, and the municipalities are fixed by\r\nthe decree of August, 1919, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Reich, through the intermediacy of the Minister of Public Economy,\r\nexercises general control over the fuel economy. The Minister may\r\nin particular lower the price of coal fixed by the National Coal\r\nAssociation. He may also organize a representation of fuel consumers, a\r\nrepresentation with authority to fix the retail price of coal. The cost\r\nincurred by the Reich in the execution of the law on the regulation of\r\ncoal, up to a minimum of 200,000 marks per year, must be borne by the\r\nNational Coal Association.\r\n\r\nThe States represented by the Committee on Commerce and Industry in the\r\nReichsrat are authorized to participate in the deliberations of the\r\nNational Coal Council and its committees, but only with consultative\r\npowers. Fiscal authorities are authorized to demand information of the\r\nNational Coal Council of the Reich and of its committees as well as of\r\nthe National Coal Associations and of the Colliers Associations.\r\n\r\nMunicipalities of at least 10,000 inhabitants and groups and Unions of\r\nMunicipalities, after having heard the claims of dealers and consumers,\r\nand guided by the wholesale price of coal fixed by the National Coal\r\nAssociation, are themselves empowered to fix the retail price within\r\ntheir territories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII.--The regulation above described was far from giving complete\r\nsatisfaction. It has been attacked both by the consumers and the\r\nsocialists. The latter criticize it as not having gone far enough along\r\nthe road of nationalization. The former, on the other hand, complain that\r\nprices are fixed by an Assembly in which coal owners form a very great\r\nmajority (The National Coal Association), and that the other interests\r\nare not able to make themselves sufficiently heard. The result of this\r\nsystem is that the coal producers always come to agreement to the\r\ndetriment of the consumers and constantly increase the price of coal.\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded to the socialists that in the system established\r\nby the law of March 23, 1919, the principles of collective economy are\r\napplied in the most parsimonious manner possible. The only Council in\r\nwhich there is parity between employers and workers is the National\r\nCoal Council, but the rôle of this Council is reduced to a minimum. The\r\nreal directors and administrators of the coal industry are the Colliers\r\nAssociations and the National Coal Association. The National Coal\r\nCouncil has hardly any effective power. As for the Cabinet, the right\r\nof the Minister of Public Economy to oppose his veto to measures taken\r\nby the National Coal Association and in particular to lower by law the\r\nprices fixed by the latter, is considered by the Socialists entirely\r\ninsufficient in view of the close co-operation of the coal mine owners\r\nand the dealers in league against him.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1920, a bill was elaborated by the Cabinet. It provided for the\r\nabolition of the National Coal Association and for the transfer of its\r\npowers to the National Coal Councils; in addition the influence of the\r\nconsumers was to be considerably increased within the National Coal\r\nCouncil. But the Constituent Assembly adjourned before this project could\r\nbe examined by them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a change was effected. It was agreed at the end of May, 1920,\r\nthat decisions of the National Coal Association would thereafter not be\r\noperative unless they were made in agreement with a “Great Commission”\r\nof the National Coal Council. If agreement is not arrived at the matter\r\nmust be brought before the National Coal Council itself which thereupon\r\ndecides, its decision becoming binding upon the Association.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII.--But this reform did not suffice, and the question of a complete\r\ntransformation of the regulation of the coal industry was submitted to a\r\nsearching examination by the Committee on Socialization. One thing was\r\nunanimously agreed upon--the existing régime could not continue. The\r\nProvisional Economic Council, in its meeting on July 24, the Cabinet of\r\nthe Reich in the meeting of the Reichstag on August 5, and the Committee\r\non Socialization declared that the coal industry must thereafter be\r\ncompletely subjected to the principles of collective economy; that the\r\nwage-earners and salaried employés in this industry must be included\r\nin the number of responsible directors of the industry; and that the\r\nprofits obtained from the exploitation of the mines by private capital\r\nmust be considerably decreased.\r\n\r\nAs for the practical means of realizing these recommendations the\r\nCommittee on Socialization was not able to come to an agreement and\r\nsubmitted two different proposals.\r\n\r\nThe first, that of Lederer, signed by ten out of twenty-one members,\r\ndemanded _immediate expropriation and nationalization of all the mines_.\r\nThe owners of the mines would receive an indemnity in the form of bonds\r\nbearing a fixed interest, and the ownership of these mines would be\r\ntransferred to an autonomous body, called “The German Coal Corporation.”\r\nThis corporation is to be governed by the National Coal Council, which\r\nappoints a “directorate” to administer affairs. The right to appoint\r\nindustrial heads, as well as the responsibility for the technical\r\nexploitation, passes to the National Coal Council and to the Directorate.\r\nBonuses for production are to be given to directors, salaried employés\r\nand workers.\r\n\r\nThe authors of this proposition insist on the fact that they are not\r\ninstituting state socialism for mines with all its attendant fiscal and\r\nbureaucratic dangers; and to emphasize what it is they are aiming at,\r\nthey propose that the mines now owned by the Reich and by the States be\r\ntaken away from them and transferred to the German Commonwealth of Coal.\r\n\r\nPrices will be fixed by the Reich, to whose budgets will be accounted the\r\nprofits of the exploitation--and undoubtedly the losses.\r\n\r\nThe second proposition, that of Rathenau and signed by eleven members\r\nout of twenty-one, does not go as far along the road of nationalization.\r\nThe present owners of mines, according to this plan, provisionally\r\nretain their property, but their rights therein are strikingly reduced.\r\nThe distribution and the sale of products cease to be guaranteed by the\r\nNational Coal Association--which is, in fact, done away with--and are\r\ngiven over to the National Coal Council and to a Directorate, four out\r\nof five of whose members are elected by the Council; the fifth, the\r\nPresident, is appointed by the Minister of Public Economy.\r\n\r\nThe principal innovation consists in this. Whereas formerly the sale of\r\ncoal was made on the basis of the individual exploitations, according\r\nto this project every mine transfers to the National Coal Council its\r\nwhole output, and the net price is averaged according to the books. The\r\nNational Council, therefore, has a monopoly on the wholesale trade and it\r\nfixes the selling prices. In addition to the net cost the Council credits\r\nto the mine (1) the cost of delivery and the interest and amortization\r\nof bonds of the enterprises; (2) the interest and amortization of new\r\ninvestments; (3) the normal fixed interest on the operating capital\r\nemployed in the exploitations; (4) bonuses, fixed according to a\r\nschedule, for the increase of output of each exploitation; or deductions\r\nin case of decrease of output.\r\n\r\nThe National Council may demand the inauguration of new projects, or\r\nexploitations may propose improvements with the approval of the Council,\r\nprovided that either the Council or the entrepreneur furnishes the\r\nnecessary funds. Finally, in order to retain the free play of private\r\ninitiative, an entrepreneur may, even in spite of the National Council,\r\nmake investment but at his own risk and peril.\r\n\r\nBy these provisions the entrepreneur loses all interest in the increase\r\nof the price of coal, for commerce in it and commercial profits are\r\ndenied to him. Also the fixing of high net prices does not serve him\r\nin any way, since his books are supervised by the properly empowered\r\nauditors of the National Council. The only way left him to make big\r\nprofits is to improve his exploitation in its economic and social\r\naspects. The interest or the profit which has hitherto ruled economy\r\nis retained in form, but it can no longer work except in the common\r\ninterest. The situation of the manager will depend as to-day on an\r\nobjective economic success.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet of the Reich announced its intention of soon submitting a\r\nproject of law which will adopt in outline the Rathenau proposition.\r\nAlready the mine owners are discussing in the press the question of\r\nthe “maturity” of the mines and the mode of calculating the cost of\r\nproduction. But above private interest there is a collective interest and\r\nthe question will come up whether the system proposed by the Committee on\r\nSocialization and the Cabinet does not incur the risk of becoming more\r\ntroublesome than profitable to the community itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have analyzed in the preceding pages the principal provisions of the\r\nGerman Constitution. There are in it a great number of other provisions,\r\nwhich had to be omitted from this analysis deliberately, either because\r\nthey also occur in all the other Constitutions of the world, such as the\r\nprinciple stated by Article 102, that judges are independent--provisions\r\nwhich do not at all serve in characterizing the work of Weimar; or, on\r\nthe other hand, because they were dictated exclusively by the necessity\r\nof solving problems created by the particular circumstances in the midst\r\nof which the Reich found itself; such as the provisions of Article 88\r\nand those following, dealing with the post, railroads, and navigable\r\nwaterways. These provisions present only a slight interest from the\r\ngeneral constitutional point of view.\r\n\r\nIn its final draft the Constitution of 1919 bears throughout the stamp of\r\n_compromises_, which had to be effected between the parties represented\r\nin the Assembly, on practically every problem attacked. On nearly every\r\nquestion which the Constituent Assembly had to solve, bargains were\r\nnegotiated between the conflicting interests and theories of the parties\r\nopposed. If one takes these articles of the Constitution one after\r\nanother, one can draw up the balance sheet of every party, and note\r\nthe points on which it has won its cause and those on which it had to\r\ncompromise. The Social Democrats wanted to substitute for the federal\r\nEmpire a unitary State; whereas the Centre, whose co-operation was needed\r\nfor the Social Democrats to remain in power, defended the federalist\r\nidea. The final result constitutes a marked victory for the Social\r\nDemocrats. But on the question of the relation of Church and State, the\r\nCentre obtained a solution that is much nearer their desires than those\r\nof the Social Democrats. Sometimes problems of a non-constitutional\r\nnature were mixed into negotiations on the Constitution. It is known, for\r\nexample, that the Social Democrats secured the signature of the Centre to\r\nthe Treaty of Versailles only in exchange for Social Democratic consent\r\nto the compromise clauses on education.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the product of these negotiations and these transactions\r\nconstitutes a work whose essential characteristics are clearly enough\r\nindicated, and whose bold outline seems to respond to the demands which\r\nall constitutions of this kind make.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of legal technique the Constitution of Weimar is,\r\non the whole, well made. Conscientiously, scientifically, the men who\r\ndrew it up studied foreign Constitutions, subjected them to the most\r\nstringent criticism, tested them by the particular exigencies of the\r\nReich and by the special character of its people. Here they imitated,\r\nthere they initiated. Naturally, they were not wholly able to detach\r\nthemselves from the judgments, preferences and prejudices that prevail\r\nin their country. Perhaps from the strictly German point of view it is\r\nbetter that it should be so. The work is strongly marked with their\r\ntraits. It is logical and fine-spun, audacious, complicated and sometimes\r\nobscure, painstakingly conceived and solidly constructed.\r\n\r\nBut whatever technical merit a legal document may present, it is worth\r\nlittle unless it accommodates itself to the realities for which it is\r\ncreated, unless, too, it is strong enough to resist the thrusts directed\r\nagainst it and to master them. Has the Constitution of Weimar resistance\r\nenough to withstand all the inevitable assaults which will be aimed at\r\nit, and can it guarantee to the German people a well-ordered public life\r\nand a stable government?\r\n\r\nWe know the bases on which it is constructed; politically--unitarism,\r\nparliamentary democracy, the republic; economically--the participation\r\nof the working class in the management of industry, evolution toward the\r\nnationalization of the industries most important in the national life.\r\nThe political institutions, under more or less different forms, have been\r\ntested by other peoples, who have not complained of them. Will these\r\ninstitutions, adapted as they have been, succeed equally for the German\r\npeople? The economic institutions are new. What will be their worth?\r\n\r\nThe question is serious; for in this edifice so logically constructed\r\nall parts are mutually interdependent, and the whole will not endure\r\nunless the parts are solid. The downfall of any of them will drag down\r\nthe others. Political institutions will not function unless economic\r\nprovisions assure industry and commerce sufficient prosperity. But\r\neconomic institutions will be swept away if the government is overwhelmed\r\nand ceases to fulfil its mission.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Constitution begins with making the Reich a state as unitary as\r\npossible without completely suppressing every trace of the federal\r\nrégime. But there are strong centrifugal tendencies. In Prussia there\r\nare several provinces that demand to be formed into distinct states.\r\nThroughout the Reich there are several states that demand the return to\r\na purely federal régime, if not actually the complete separation from\r\nthe German Reich. Will these tendencies be strong enough to bring about\r\na relaxation of the unitary bond, if not actually the disintegration\r\nof the Reich? We have already pointed out the difference, for example,\r\nseparating Catholic, peasant and conservative Bavaria from Protestant,\r\nindustrial and socialist Prussia. The States were able to endure without\r\nmuch difficulty the hegemony of a victorious, powerful, prosperous\r\nPrussia, a hegemony by which they profited. But the same States resent\r\nthe thought that a Prussia, which they hold responsible for the defeat\r\nand which they now see much weakened, should want to keep them still\r\nunder its yoke and to attempt, under the pretext of unity, to absorb the\r\nReich. They feel this all the more strongly since the future is dark.\r\nPrussia has been dangerously stricken and it may appear more advantageous\r\nnot to tie up too intimately their own interests with those of such a\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nOnce more Prussia holds the fate of Germany in its hands. If, renouncing\r\nthe attitude which it has maintained since the Revolution, Prussia\r\npermits a transformation of some of its provinces into states, or\r\nif it accords them an autonomy so great that they will be in effect\r\nassimilated into states, then the federalist or separatist tendencies\r\nwill probably lose much of their strength, and the unitarism desired by\r\nthe Constitution will be able to maintain itself and even to develop.\r\nBut if Prussia, relying on its strength and prestige, diminished though\r\nthey be, insists on keeping the other German states, willing or not, in a\r\nReich dominated by it, then it may be that the federalist or separatist\r\ntendencies will prevail.\r\n\r\nThe political institutions of Germany are as strongly impregnated with\r\nthe _democratic idea_ as possible. The majority is sovereign. But\r\nthere are minorities, to the right and to the left, that aspire to\r\ndictatorship. It seems little likely that another attempt like that of\r\nKapp and Lüttwitz will succeed any better than the last attempt--at least\r\nunless a sudden and complete change in the political orientation of the\r\npeople takes place. On the other side, the Independents, for whom even\r\nin Berlin a _coup d’état_ may be perhaps easy enough, know that they\r\nwould have against them the great majority of the German people, and\r\ntheir leaders openly declare that their hour has not yet come. If in\r\nthe domain of democratic doctrine a change seems likely to come, it is\r\nprobable that it will appear in the form of a right expressly accorded to\r\neconomic associations or, in a still more general manner, to producers,\r\nto exercise a special and direct influence on the government. If the\r\nProvisional Economic Council succeeds, it is possible that Germany will\r\nbroaden the experiment and attempt a true Economic Parliament.\r\n\r\n_Parliamentary government_ has been accepted but it is mistrusted.\r\nThere have also been introduced a whole series of measures such as\r\nthe referendum, initiative, the nomination and the impeachment of the\r\nPresident by the people, which are not only logical applications of the\r\ndemocratic principle, but which are also assurances against any possible\r\nmisdeeds of parliamentarism. This is a splendid proof of trust in\r\ndemocracy. It is for the future to say whether it is justified.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the referendum and initiative await the law which is\r\nto organize them. What will these institutions produce in a country as\r\nvast as Germany? It is easy to see that they will strikingly increase\r\nthe burden of governmental machinery, and one asks oneself whether\r\nthey will not incur the risk of completely impeding its functioning.\r\nFor the success of these institutions, we must suppose a sufficiently\r\nfirm political education and intelligence, a public that knows its\r\nwishes and how to make them prevail, a Parliament and a Cabinet skilled\r\nin recognizing the wishes of the nation and ready to submit to them.\r\nBecause of the mistrust of parliamentarism, it has been decided that the\r\nPresident shall be elected directly by the people. He is endowed with\r\npower by the nation and placed near to the Reichstag in order to control\r\nit. But may he not become too strong, and is there not a danger that\r\nhe will abuse his powers to the great injury of liberty and democracy\r\nitself? The present President has been elected by the National Assembly.\r\nConsiderable as are the powers which the Constitution gives him, he is\r\nactually one of the least powerful chiefs of state in the world. Will\r\nmatters be different when he is elected by the whole people? Will he be\r\nstrong enough, or too strong?\r\n\r\nThis democracy which does not fear the plebiscite, has expressly excluded\r\nthe _monarchical form_ for the Reich and for the States. There are,\r\nnevertheless, here and there, particularly in Bavaria, monarchical plots.\r\nWill the Constitution have here, too, enough force to command obedience?\r\nIt does not seem for the moment that a monarchical restoration, no\r\nmatter of what dynasty its pretender, would have any serious chance of\r\nsucceeding. For, until some new state of affairs, the working class,\r\nwhich would permit a dictatorship exercised by itself, will probably\r\noppose every attempt at a return to the abolished personal régime.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Economic Constitution departs much more from old customs than the\r\npolitical Constitution.\r\n\r\n_The idea of the Councils_ is probably the only really new idea that\r\nhas appeared in the public law of modern states since the war. German\r\nlaw has given this idea solemn consecration and has embodied it in the\r\nConstitution. But up to now it has given it only the most restricted\r\napplication. The Factory Workers Councils have hardly begun to function,\r\nand the working class has not yet any clear notion of the manner in which\r\nit will use the power given by the law to these new organisms.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Councils leads naturally to _nationalization_.\r\nFor to confide the administration of the whole of an industry to\r\nEconomic Councils, in which the workers are represented by the side of\r\nthe employers and consumers, is to make a direct application of the\r\n_Mitbestimmungsrecht_. But other considerations are also tending to\r\ngive this system a place of increasing importance. “The free play of\r\neconomic forces” is no longer being upheld. It is affirmed everywhere\r\nthat classic liberalism has had its day, and that in order to improve the\r\neconomic situation so extremely unfavourable in all the modern states,\r\nit is not enough that things be allowed freely to take their course.\r\nIt is now thought that “let alone” leads to bankruptcy. One no longer\r\nbelieves in the former principles that held as absolute the right to\r\nprivate property, the right of work, liberty of commerce, and freedom of\r\ncontract. To-day these rights are held to be limited by the general good\r\nand must be exercised by the individual in the interest of all.\r\n\r\nAs the question of principle seems to be settled the problem becomes\r\nalmost exclusively a practical one. A certain number of industries have\r\nbecome more or less nationalized or even socialized and will become still\r\nmore so, their number also probably growing. The discussion now seems\r\nto be only on the modes of application, on the degree of “maturity”\r\nnecessary; on whether this or that industry is or is not ripe; on the\r\nmode of calculating the cost of exploitation; on bonuses for output,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nLike the idea of the Councils, this doctrine of nationalization seems to\r\ngain more and more. What will come of it for Germany and for the States\r\nthat will follow this road? Are not these new formulas the ephemeral\r\nresult of the upheaval due to the war? Or will they, improved and tested\r\nby practice, be definitely installed in the economic organization of all\r\nmodern peoples? To the countries that adopt them, will they bring ruin\r\nor economic prosperity and social peace? On these matters, one can only\r\nwrite interrogation marks. In any event, however, it is important to\r\nfollow the German experiment with the greatest possible interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n    German                            Translation\r\n\r\n    REICH                             Commonwealth\r\n\r\n    REICHS-                           of the Commonwealth, national\r\n\r\n    REICHSARBEITERRAT                 National Workers’ Council\r\n\r\n    REICHSGERICHT                     National Judicial Court\r\n\r\n    REICHSKANZLER                     National Chancellor\r\n\r\n    REICHSMINISTER                    National Minister\r\n\r\n    REICHSMINISTERIUM, pl., -IEN      National Department\r\n\r\n    REICHSPRÄSIDENT                   President of the Commonwealth,\r\n                                      National President\r\n\r\n    REICHSRAT                         National Council\r\n\r\n    REICHSREGIERUNG                   National Cabinet\r\n\r\n    REICHSTAG                         National Assembly\r\n\r\n    REICHSVERWALTUNGSGERICHT          National Administrative Court\r\n\r\n    REICHSWIRTSCHAFTSRAT              National Economic Council\r\n\r\n    LAND                              State (an integral part of the\r\n                                      Commonwealth)\r\n\r\n    LANDES-                           of the State, State\r\n\r\n    LANDESREGIERUNG                   State Cabinet\r\n\r\n    LANDTAG                           State Assembly\r\n\r\n    WAHLPRÜFUNGSGERICHT               Electoral Commission\r\n\r\n    STAAT                             country, state (one of the family\r\n                                      of nations); referring to Germany,\r\n                                      it designates the Commonwealth and\r\n                                      separate States as a single\r\n                                      political entity.\r\n\r\n    STAATSGERICHTSHOF                 Supreme Judicial Court\r\n\r\n    STAATLICH                         political\r\n\r\n    FREISTAATLICH                     republican\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF THE GERMAN COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\n_PREAMBLE_\r\n\r\nThe German People, united in all their branches, and inspired by the\r\ndetermination to renew and strengthen their Commonwealth in liberty and\r\njustice, to preserve peace both at home and abroad, and to foster social\r\nprogress, have adopted the following Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\nStructure and Functions of the Commonwealth\r\n\r\n\r\n_SECTION I_\r\n\r\nCOMMONWEALTH AND STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1\r\n\r\nThe German Commonwealth is a republic.\r\n\r\nPolitical authority is derived from the People.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 2\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Commonwealth consists of the territories of\r\nthe German States.

If the Commonwealth claims any source of revenue which formerly\r\nbelonged to the States, it must have consideration for the financial\r\nrequirements of the States.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 9\r\n\r\nWhenever it is necessary to establish uniform rules, the Commonwealth has\r\njurisdiction over:\r\n\r\n1.

This does not\r\napply in cases where the Commonwealth possesses exclusive jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe National Cabinet may object to State laws relating to the subjects of\r\nArticle 7, Number 13, whenever the general welfare of the Commonwealth is\r\naffected thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 13\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Commonwealth are supreme over the laws of the States\r\nwhich conflict with them.\r\n\r\nIf doubt arises, or difference of opinion, whether State legislation is\r\nin harmony with the law of the Commonwealth, the proper authorities of\r\nthe Commonwealth or the central authorities of the States, in accordance\r\nwith more specific provisions of a national law, may have recourse to the\r\ndecision of a supreme judicial court of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 14\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Commonwealth will be executed by the State authorities,\r\nunless otherwise provided by national law.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 15\r\n\r\nThe National Cabinet supervises the conduct of affairs over which the\r\nCommonwealth has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the laws of the Commonwealth are to be carried into effect\r\nby the State authorities, the National Cabinet may issue general\r\ninstructions. It has the power to send commissioners to the central\r\nauthorities of the States, and, with their consent, to the subordinate\r\nState authorities, in order to supervise the execution of national laws.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the State Cabinets, at the request of the National\r\nCabinet, to correct any defects in the execution of the national laws.\r\nIn case of dispute, either the National Cabinet or that of the State\r\nmay have recourse to the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court, unless\r\nanother court is prescribed by national law.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 16\r\n\r\nThe officers directly charged with the administration of national\r\naffairs in any State shall, as a rule, be citizens of that State. The\r\nofficers, employés and workmen of the national administration shall, if\r\nthey so desire, be employed in the districts where they reside as far\r\nas is possible and not inconsistent with their training and with the\r\nrequirements of the service.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 17\r\n\r\nEvery State must have a republican constitution. The representatives of\r\nthe People must be elected by the universal, equal, direct and secret\r\nsuffrage of all German citizens, both men and women, according to the\r\nprinciples of proportional representation. The State Cabinet shall\r\nrequire the confidence of the representatives of the People.\r\n\r\nThe principles in accordance with which the representatives of the\r\nPeople are chosen apply also to municipal elections; but by State law\r\na residence qualification not exceeding one year of residence in the\r\nmunicipality may be imposed in such elections.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 18\r\n\r\nThe division of the Commonwealth into States shall serve the highest\r\neconomic and cultural interests of the People after most thorough\r\nconsideration of the wishes of the population affected. State boundaries\r\nmay be altered and new States may be created within the Commonwealth by\r\nthe process of constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nWith the consent of the States directly affected, it requires only an\r\nordinary law of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary law of the Commonwealth will also suffice, if one of the\r\nStates affected does not consent, provided that the change of boundaries\r\nor the creation of a new State is desired by the population concerned and\r\nis also required by a preponderant national interest.\r\n\r\nThe wishes of the population shall be ascertained by a referendum. The\r\nNational Cabinet orders a referendum on demand of one-third of the\r\ninhabitants qualified to vote for the National Assembly in the territory\r\nto be cut off.\r\n\r\nThree-fifths of the votes cast, but at least a majority of the qualified\r\nvoters, are required for the alteration of a boundary or the creation\r\nof a new State. Even if a separation of only a part of a Prussian\r\nadministrative district, a Bavarian circle, or, in other States, a\r\ncorresponding administrative district, is involved, the wishes of the\r\npopulation of the whole district must be ascertained. If there is no\r\nphysical contact between the territory to be cut off and the rest of the\r\ndistrict, the wishes of the population of the district to be cut off may\r\nbe pronounced conclusive by a special law of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAfter the consent of the population has been ascertained the National\r\nCabinet shall introduce into the National Assembly a bill suitable for\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nIf any controversy arises over the division of property in connection\r\nwith such a union or separation, it will be determined upon complaint of\r\neither party by the Supreme Judicial Court of the German Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 19\r\n\r\nIf controversies concerning the Constitution arise within a State in\r\nwhich there is no court competent to dispose of them, or if controversies\r\nof a public nature arise between different States or between a State and\r\nthe Commonwealth, they will be determined upon complaint of one of the\r\nparties by the Supreme Judicial Court of the German Commonwealth, unless\r\nanother judicial court of the Commonwealth is competent.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Commonwealth executes judgments of the Supreme\r\nJudicial Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SECTION II_\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 20\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly is composed of the delegates of the German People.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 21\r\n\r\nThe delegates are representatives of the whole People. They are subject\r\nonly to their own consciences and are not bound by any instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 22\r\n\r\nThe delegates are elected by universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage\r\nby all men and women over twenty years of age, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of proportional representation. The day for elections must be\r\na Sunday or a public holiday.\r\n\r\nThe details will be regulated by the national election law.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 23\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly is elected for four years. New elections must take\r\nplace at the latest on the sixtieth day after its term comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly convenes at the latest on the thirtieth day after\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 24\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly meets each year on the first Wednesday in November\r\nat the seat of the National Government. The President of the National\r\nAssembly must call it earlier if the President of the Commonwealth, or at\r\nleast one-third of the members of the National Assembly, demand it.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly determines the close of its session and the day of\r\nre-assembling.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 25\r\n\r\nThe President of the Commonwealth may dissolve the National Assembly, but\r\nonly once for the same cause.\r\n\r\nThe new election occurs at the latest on the sixtieth day after such\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 26\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly chooses its President, Vice-President and its\r\nSecretaries. It regulates its own procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 27\r\n\r\nDuring the interval between sessions, or while elections are taking\r\nplace, the President and Vice-President of the preceding session conduct\r\nits affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 28\r\n\r\nThe President administers the regulations and policing of the National\r\nAssembly building. The management of the building is subject to his\r\ndirection; he controls its receipts and expenses in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the budget, and represents the Commonwealth in all legal\r\naffairs and in litigation arising during his administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 29\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the National Assembly are public. At the request of\r\nfifty members the public may be excluded by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 30\r\n\r\nTrue and accurate reports of the proceedings in public sittings of the\r\nNational Assembly, of a State Assembly, or of their committees, are\r\nabsolutely privileged.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 31\r\n\r\nAn Electoral Commission to decide disputed elections will be organized\r\nin connection with the National Assembly.

But these operations suppose\r\na government. Now, the law of February 10, created the government;\r\nbut this law could not be promulgated by a government which this very\r\npromulgation would create. It was decided, therefore, that the law should\r\nbecome operative immediately and be authenticated by the President of the\r\nNational Assembly.\r\n\r\n[9] These concepts of “unitarism” and “federalism” must be compared with\r\n“centralism” and “particularism,” which correspond to them, but which,\r\nnevertheless, also differ from them. When one speaks of “particularism”\r\none means, beyond the legal and political differences which may exist\r\nbetween the member states of a federated state, the peculiarities\r\nof race, special traits of culture, geographic and ethnographic\r\ncharacteristics which give to populations their own stamp and a\r\ndistinct collective sentiment. Political “particularism” and federalist\r\ntendencies may co-exist naturally; but “particularism” is not necessarily\r\nanti-centralistic: a “particularism” inspired by the love of a little\r\nfatherland and its individuality gives to the population a certain\r\nnational consciousness which is not necessarily antagonistic to the\r\nestablishment of a strong central power. On the other hand “unitarism,”\r\nif it preserves for the state the character of a federated state and does\r\nnot tend to a complete fusion of the member states, may well recognize\r\nthat races and provinces wish for individual existence and may be ready\r\nto accord them corresponding liberty.\r\n\r\n[10] See Preuss, _Deutschlands republikanische Reichsverfassung_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[11] See Jacobi, _Einheitsstaat oder Bundesstaat_, Leipzig, 1919.\r\n\r\n[12] Since the Revolution, Coburg has detached itself from\r\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha and become a distinct state without the decision of any\r\nauthority whatsoever sanctioning this situation.\r\n\r\n[13] There was in this a true provisionally federated state within a\r\nfederal German state. For several months there was thus, in central\r\nGermany, a triple superposition of states.\r\n\r\n[14] It must be recognized nevertheless that with the exception of the\r\nHanseatic cities the monarchical form was implied. For Prussia it was\r\nobligatory.\r\n\r\n[15] See Giese, _Die Reichsverfassung, vom II, August, 1919_, p. 65;\r\nJacobi, _Einheitsstaat oder Bundesstaat_, p. 6, _et seq._; Poetsch,\r\n_Handausgabe der Reichsverfassung_, p. 25, _et seq._; Wenzel, _Festgabe\r\nfür Bergbohn_, 1919, p. 159, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[16] See Stier-Somlo, _op. cit._, p. 79, _et seq._; Walter Jellinek,\r\nRevolution und Reichsverfassung, in Jahrbuch des öffentlichen Rechts, p.\r\n81; Arndt, Reichsverfassung, 1919, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[17] In reality the states still exchange ambassadors and, in the\r\nofficial German language, the agreements reached either between two\r\nstates or several carry the name of Staatsverträge (international\r\ntreaties). See particularly the international treaty adopted between\r\nthe Reich on the one hand, and Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Wurtemberg,\r\nBaden, Hesse, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Oldenburg on the other, concerning\r\nthe transfer to the Reich of the railroads of these states, the treaty\r\napproved by the National Assembly, April 30, 1920.\r\n\r\n[18] See Heilfron, _Die deutsche Nationalversammlung im Jahre 1919_, vol.\r\nii, p. 1176.\r\n\r\n[19] See Julius Kaliski, _Der Kern des Rätegedanken_, in _Welt-Echo_,\r\nJune, 1919.\r\n\r\n[20] This is the exact text: “1. For the immediate formation of the\r\ncabinets in the Empire and in Prussia, the questions of individual\r\nappointments will be decided by the political parties in agreement with\r\nthe organizations of workers, salaried employés and civil servants\r\ntaking part in the general strike, and a decisive influence will be\r\naccorded to these organizations in the new policies of economic and\r\nsocial legislation, all with the view of safeguarding the rights\r\nof popular representation. 2. Immediate disarmament and punishment\r\nof all those guilty of participating in the _pronunciamento_ or\r\nthe overthrow of the constitutional government, as well as of all\r\ncivil servants who placed themselves at the disposal of the illegal\r\ngovernments. 3. All public and industrial administrations must be\r\nradically purged of counter-revolutionary personalities, in particular\r\nof those who participate in the management, and these personalities\r\nmust be replaced by trusted elements. Re-employment of all the\r\nrepresentatives of organizations in public services who were made the\r\nvictims of disciplinary measures. 4. The earliest possible realization\r\nof administrative reform on a democratic basis, with the co-operation\r\nof the economic organizations of wage-workers, salaried employés and\r\ncivil servants. 5. The immediate execution of all existing laws and the\r\nenactment of new social laws that will accord to wage-workers, salaried\r\nemployés and civil servants complete social and economic equality;\r\nand the immediate enactment of liberal legislation in behalf of civil\r\nservants. 6. The immediate socialization of the branches of industry\r\nripe for socialization on the basis of the decisions of the Committee on\r\nSocialization, in which representatives of vocational organizations shall\r\ntake part. The immediate convocation of the Committee on Socialization.\r\nThe transfer to the Empire of the coal and potash corporations. 7. More\r\neffective appropriation and, if need be, the expropriation of available\r\nnecessities of life; more vigorous war against usurers and profiteers in\r\nthe country districts and in the cities; guarantees that obligations of\r\ndeliveries will be executed, insured by the organization of societies\r\nfor delivery of goods, and the establishment of definite fines and\r\npunishments for all violations of these obligations due to ill-will. 8.\r\nThe dissolution of all counter-revolutionary military organizations that\r\ndid not remain faithful to the Constitution, and their replacement with\r\norganizations recruited from the masses of tried republican population,\r\nin particular workers, salaried employés and organized civil servants,\r\nwithout favour to any class whatever. In this reorganization the rights\r\nof all troops and organizations that have remained faithful shall remain\r\nintact.”\r\n\r\n[21] Retreat of the Berlin troops to the line of the Spree; the lifting\r\nof the state of siege; no attack on armed workers, particularly in the\r\nRuhr; negotiations with labour organizations with the view of recruiting\r\nof workers in the troops of Prussian safety police.\r\n\r\n[22] The principal of the new “Nine Points” are: 1. The troops of\r\n_Reichswehr_ remain in their position and must not advance on the\r\nindustrial area except with the express authorization of the Cabinet.\r\n2. The red army dissolves and gives up its arms. 3. Adequate police is\r\nassured by the constitutional authorities, supported by “committees\r\non public order” and of “local armies” composed of workers, salaried\r\nemployés and civil servants of all parties. 4. The “committees of action”\r\nand the “executive committees” are dissolved.\r\n\r\n[23] _Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_, March 28, 1920.\r\n\r\n[24] _Lokal Anzeiger_, April 8, evening.\r\n\r\n[25] Lensch, _Erwünschte Nachwirkungen_, in _Der Tag_, No. 83.\r\n\r\n[26] Preuss, _Deutschlands republikanische Reichsverfassung_.\r\n\r\n[27] Session of July 2. (Heilfron, _op. cit._, vol. V, pp. 2960-2961.)\r\n\r\n[28] There are differences of detail between these two modes, but of no\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[29] The origin of this provision goes back to the “certificate” that\r\nwas given in the elections for the National Assembly to soldiers and\r\nsailors returning from the front and to troops assigned to service for\r\nthe preservation of order in polling places.\r\n\r\n[30] Session of July 7, 1919. (Heilfron, _op cit._, vol. V, p. 3314.)\r\n\r\n[31] Session of July 7, 1919. (Heilfron, _op. cit._, vol. V, pp.\r\n3299-3300.)\r\n\r\n[32] See the analysis of this bill in the _Deutsche Juristen Zeitung_,\r\n1920, p. 385.\r\n\r\n[33] Heilfron, _op. cit._, vol. II, p. 969.\r\n\r\n[34] _Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1920, p. 909.\r\n\r\n[35] Bismarck was always against the granting of salaries to members of\r\nthe Reichstag. He hoped thereby to prevent making of politics a career.\r\nThe members of the Reichstag since 1906 have been receiving compensation\r\nwhich, at first fixed at 3,000 marks a year, was increased in 1918 to\r\n5,000. National Assembly members were paid 1,000 marks a month. The new\r\nReichstag in one of its first sessions decided (1) that its members are\r\nto receive 1,500 marks a month; (2) that those of its members who, in\r\nthe intervals of the Reichstag’s sitting, worked on committees, should\r\nreceive 50 marks a day. In addition, members of the Reichstag have the\r\nright to travel free on all railroads of the Reich.\r\n\r\n[36] There were formerly six important permanent committees: on\r\nprocedure, petitions, commerce and industry, finance and customs,\r\njustice, and budget. We shall see that the Constitution has added to this\r\nlist a committee on foreign affairs, and a committee on the protection of\r\nthe rights of popular representation when the Reichstag is not meeting.\r\nIt goes without saying that the Reichstag may name special committees for\r\nsuch and such functions decided upon.\r\n\r\n[37] There are thus three kinds of treaties: Those made by a law of the\r\nReich, those made by agreement between the President and the Reichstag,\r\nand those made by the President alone.\r\n\r\n[38] It must be noted that, contrary to the practice in most\r\nparliamentary countries, there is no distinction made between ordinary\r\nlaws and fiscal laws. The latter, particularly the budget, audit laws,\r\nloans, are subject to the same regulation as the former. This is\r\nexplained by the fact that, unlike most other parliamentary countries,\r\nGermany does not practice, properly speaking, the two-chamber system.\r\n\r\n[39] Heilfron, _op. cit._, vol. V, p. 3193.\r\n\r\n[40] See in general the work of Redslob, _Die parlamentarische Regierung\r\nin ihrer wahren und in ihrer unechten Form_, Tübingen, 1918. It is\r\ncurious to note that every argument and all the investigations of Redslob\r\ntake as their point of departure the criticisms addressed by Professor\r\nDuguit against the French system, particularly in his _Traité de Droit\r\nConstitutionnel_, 1911, vol. I, pp. 411-412.\r\n\r\n[41] This law has never been applied. President Ebert, now in office,\r\nwas, it will be remembered, elected by the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n[42] The President of the Reich has not, what is called in France, _le\r\npouvoir réglementaire_, that is to say, the right to issue general\r\nordinances obligatory on all citizens. He cannot make regulations of this\r\nkind except in cases where the Constitution or an ordinary law gives him\r\nspecial power to do so. In such a case either he issues the regulation,\r\nnaturally with the countersignature of a Minister (Articles 48, 49, 51,\r\n59 of the Constitution, for example), or he must first obtain the consent\r\nof the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n[43] See particularly the decree of March 19, 1920, _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\n1920, p. 467.\r\n\r\n[44] At the meeting of the Committee on the Constitution on April 4,\r\n1919, Preuss, then Minister of the Interior, declared that such was\r\nalready the practice in Germany and that President Ebert presided over\r\nthe most important meetings of the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n[45] It includes in addition two members that do not belong to any\r\nparty--the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Transport.\r\n\r\n[46] Article 64 provided also that after the reunion of Austria with\r\nthe German Reich the latter would have the right to be represented in\r\nthe Reichstag numerically in proportion to the size of its population.\r\nUntil such union the representatives of German Austria would have only a\r\nconsultative voice. This provision, contrary both in letter and spirit\r\nto Article 80 of the Peace Treaty, brought a protest from the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Allied Powers and their associates. The first note on\r\nSeptember 2, 1919, demanded the abolition of the offending provision\r\nby constitutional amendment within a fortnight. On September 5, the\r\nGerman government replied that no article of the Constitution could be\r\nin contradiction with the Treaty of Peace, for Article 78, paragraph 2,\r\nexpressly provides that no constitutional provision may carry any attempt\r\nagainst the treaty. This reply justly seemed to the Allies insufficient.\r\nArticle 78, paragraph 2, constitutes, it is true, on the part of the\r\ndrafters of the Constitution an excellent measure of precaution against\r\ncontradictions between the Constitution and the Treaty not provided for\r\nin advance and revealed in practice. But the contradiction pointed out by\r\nthe note of the Allies of September 2 was too clear and evident to have\r\nbeen accidental. The Allied Powers, therefore, demanded that the German\r\nGovernment send by means of a diplomatic document the interpretation\r\ncontained in its note of September 5. This is the text, therefore, of a\r\nsupplementary declaration drawn up by the German Cabinet and ratified by\r\nthe National Assembly:\r\n\r\n“The undersigned, duly authorized in the name of the German Government,\r\nrecognize and declare that all provisions of the German Constitution\r\nof August 11, 1919, that are in contradiction with stipulations of the\r\nTreaty of Peace signed at Versailles on June 28, 1919, are without force,\r\nand that particularly the admission of the representatives of Austria as\r\nmembers of the Reichstag cannot be effected except if, in conformance\r\nwith Article 80 of the Treaty of Peace, the League of Nations sanctions a\r\nchange in the international situation of Austria. The present declaration\r\nmust be ratified by the competent authorities within a fortnight after\r\nthe Treaty of Peace becomes operative.”\r\n\r\n[47] The committees thus formed are eleven in number and each consists\r\nof nine members. They are, committees on foreign affairs, political\r\neconomy, interior administration, commerce and audits, taxes and customs,\r\njustice, the Constitution and interior regulation, the army, navy, and\r\nthe execution of the Treaty of Peace.\r\n\r\n[48] See Koch, _Die Grundrechte in der Verfassung, Deutsche Juristen\r\nZeitung_, 1919, p. 609, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[49] It should be observed that this provision has been decreed by a\r\nlaw; consequently there can be no question in regard to it whether it\r\nis a provision having the force of law or only a moral maxim. It is a\r\nlegislative provision. The fact that it was later inserted into the\r\nConstitution has only the effect of preventing its abrogation or its\r\nmodification other than by constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n[50] This principle of civil law has also become now a provision of\r\nconstitutional law (Article 152).\r\n\r\n[51] It must be also noted that up to now the States have not as yet\r\ncomplied with this order of the Constitution. In Prussia in particular\r\nit does not seem that measures have yet been enacted against the\r\n“fideicommis.”\r\n\r\n[52] _Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1920, p. 876.\r\n\r\n[53] The question of the length of the working day has not been touched\r\nby the Constitution. Up to now it has been regulated exclusively by\r\nspecial decrees based on the eight-hour day. The decrees of November\r\n23, 1918, and of December 17, 1918, introduced the eight-hour day for\r\nworkers in industries with the exception of industries which must not be\r\ninterrupted. The decree of November 23, 1918, prescribed the length of\r\nthe working day in bakeries; that of March 18, 1919, did the same for\r\nsalaried employés. A general law that provides for an eight-hour day and\r\nregulating its application is in preparation.\r\n\r\n[54] _Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1920, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[55] As yet there has not been organized insurance against non-employment.\r\n\r\n[56] The political parties interested themselves in these elections, the\r\nplatform being “for or against religious instruction.” The number of\r\nsocialists elected was less than that of bourgeois parties.\r\n\r\n[57] See Chapter III.\r\n\r\n[58] Max Schippel, _Schicksalstunden der Arbeitsgemeinschaft,\r\nSozialistische Monatshefte_, 1920, p. 328.\r\n\r\n[59] It has been changed by a law of May 31, 1920. (_Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\n1920, p. 1128.)\r\n\r\n[60] _Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_, April 29, evening.\r\n\r\n[61] In the discussion that arose on this subject an expression used in\r\nit has achieved popularity and is in current use. The strikers demanded\r\nand obtained the “anchorage” of the Councils in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[62] See p. 307.\r\n\r\n[63] It will be recalled that in order to obtain increase in authority\r\nfor the Factory Workers Councils, the Independents organized a great\r\nmanifestation in Berlin in January, 1920, in the course of which about\r\nforty of the participants in the manifestation were killed on the steps\r\nof the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n[64] These enterprises are: Stock companies, limited joint-stock\r\ncompanies, mutual insurance companies, and eventually limited liability\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n[65] See Paul Umbreit, _das Betriebsrätegesetz_, Berlin, 1920, pp. 20-21.\r\n\r\n[66] It met for the first time on June 30, 1920.\r\n\r\n[67] This memorandum did not represent the personal opinion of the\r\nMinister. The ideas expressed in it were the opinions of a group that\r\nincluded both socialists and bourgeois elements, men like Walter\r\nRathenau, von Möllendorf (under-secretary of State under Wissel),\r\nAndreas, a banker, Georg Bernhard, editor of the _Vossiche Zeitung_, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[68] Reier, _Sozialisierungsgesetze_, Berlin, 1920, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[69] Wissel, then Minister of Public Economy, on March 7, 1919, before\r\nthe National Assembly thus defined collective economy properly so-called:\r\n“Collective economy means the organization and management of private\r\neconomic enterprises in the interests of the Reich, the subordination\r\nof private interests to collective interests. The application of this\r\ngeneral principle to particular cases must be adapted to the special\r\nconditions of the different branches of the economy. Nothing can be worse\r\nthan to want to make the economy rigidly uniform. Every economic group is\r\na different organism that demands forms appropriate to it. This seems to\r\nbe indicated in the exterior forms of union, such as capitalist economy\r\npracticed in its associations and cartels. But the spirit that prevails\r\nin these organizations must be raised above purely private considerations\r\nup to a sense of responsibility toward the people as a whole, up to the\r\nconception of a collective economy. _Collective economy does not mean\r\nstate economy, but autonomy._ The State is not the master of economy. It\r\ncan and should exercise supreme supervision and hold in equilibrium the\r\nopposing interests with justice and wisdom.”\r\n\r\n[70] These sixty members are divided as follows:\r\n\r\n    3 representatives of states;\r\n    15 representatives of colliers’ organizations;\r\n    15 representatives of mine workers;\r\n    1 employer and 1 worker in gasworks;\r\n    2 salaried employés of the technical service of the mines;\r\n    1 salaried employé of the commercial service of the mines;\r\n    5 coal merchants;\r\n    1 employé in the wholesale coal trade;\r\n    2 employers and 2 workers in industries using coal;\r\n    2 representatives of consumers’ societies;\r\n    1 user of coal in the cities, 1 in the country;\r\n    2 representatives of small industries using coal;\r\n    1 user of coal for railroads;\r\n    1 user of coal for maritime navigation;\r\n    1 user of coal for river navigation;\r\n    3 mine and boiler experts.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the states are named by the Reichsrat from among\r\nthe municipal administrations and consumers of coal. The representatives\r\nof employers and employés in the mining industries as well as the twelve\r\nrepresentatives of the colliers’ associations are elected by the mine\r\ngroups of the _Arbeitsgemeinschaft_. Two representatives are named by the\r\nPrussian Minister of Commerce and Industry. The representatives of the\r\ncoal trade are named by the German Congress of Commerce and Industry. The\r\nrepresentatives of the employers and employés of the industries using\r\ncoal, and the representatives of the employés of gasworks are elected\r\nby their _Arbeitsgemeinschaften_. The representatives of the small\r\nindustries using coal are elected by the German Chambers of Commerce and\r\nIndustry. The other representatives are appointed, on the advice of those\r\nthey represent, by the Minister of Public Economy of the Reich.\r\n\r\n[71] Stricken out at the demand of the Supreme Council of the Allied and\r\nAssociated Powers. The Supreme Council addressed the following demand to\r\nGermany on September 2, 1919:\r\n\r\n“The Allied and Associated Powers have examined the German Constitution\r\nof August 11, 1919. They observe that the provisions of the second\r\nparagraph of Article 61 constitute a formal violation of Article 80 of\r\nthe Treaty of Peace signed at Versailles on June 28, 1919. This violation\r\nis twofold:\r\n\r\n“1. Article 61 by stipulating for the admission of Austria to the\r\nReichsrat assimilates that Republic to the German States composing the\r\nGerman Empire--an assimilation which is incompatible with respect to the\r\nindependence of Austria.\r\n\r\n“2. By admitting and providing for the participation of Austria in the\r\nCouncil of the Empire Article 61 creates a political tie and a common\r\npolitical action between Germany and Austria in absolute opposition to\r\nthe independence of the latter.\r\n\r\n“In consequence the Allied and Associated Powers, after reminding the\r\nGerman Government that Article 178 of the German Constitution declares\r\nthat ‘the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles can not be affected by\r\nthe Constitution,’ invite the German Government to take the necessary\r\nmeasures to efface without delay this violation by declaring Article 61,\r\nParagraph 2, to be null and void.\r\n\r\n“Without prejudice to subsequent measures in case of refusal, and in\r\nvirtue of the Treaty of Peace (and in particular Article 29), the Allied\r\nand Associated Powers inform the German Government that this violation of\r\nits engagements on an essential point will compel them, if satisfaction\r\nis not given to their just demand within 15 days from the date of the\r\npresent note, immediately to order the extension of their occupation on\r\nthe right bank of the Rhine.”\r\n\r\nArticle 29 of the Treaty of Peace refers to Map No. 1 which shows the\r\nboundaries of Germany and provides that the text of Articles 27 and 28\r\nwill be final as to those boundaries. Article 80 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“Germany acknowledges and will respect strictly the independence of\r\nAustria, within the frontiers which may be fixed in a Treaty between that\r\nState and the Principal Allied and Associated Powers; she agrees that\r\nthis independence shall be inalienable, except with the consent of the\r\nCouncil of the League of Nations.”\r\n\r\nA diplomatic act was signed at Paris on September 22, 1919, by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers and Germany\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n“The undersigned, duly authorized and acting in the name of the German\r\nGovernment, recognizes and declares that all the provisions of the German\r\nConstitution of August 11, 1919, which are in contradiction of the terms\r\nof the Treaty of Peace signed at Versailles on June 28, 1919, are null.\r\n\r\n“The German Government declares and recognizes that in consequence\r\nParagraph 2 of Article 61 of the said Constitution is null, and that in\r\nparticular the admission of Austrian representatives to the Reichstag\r\ncould only take place in the event of the consent of the Council of\r\nthe League of Nations to a corresponding modification of Austria’s\r\ninternational situation.\r\n\r\n“The present declaration shall be approved by the competent German\r\nlegislative authority, within the fortnight following the entry into\r\nforce of the Peace Treaty.\r\n\r\n“Given at Versailles, September 22, 1919, in the presence of the\r\nundersigned representatives of the Principal Allied and Associated\r\nPowers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The New German Constitution, by René Brunet",
