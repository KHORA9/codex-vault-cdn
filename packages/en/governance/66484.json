Hyphenation has been\r\nrationalised.\r\n\r\nThe text is divided into fifty eight Chapters, which are grouped into\r\nnine Parts. The Chapters are not identified in the Contents pages: they\r\nmostly coincide with the topics noted there, though not with their\r\nnumbering. The numbering of pages is occasionally out of sequence,\r\ngenerally when a topic is discussed more than once.\r\n\r\nBoth the Index and the Contents Pages use expressions that identify the\r\npage number and section/subsection to which they relate. These\r\nexpressions are explained in the Note immediately before the Index.\r\n\r\nA number of words and phrases are bolded in the original. These are\r\nidentified in this text by =equal signs=. Where the original treatment\r\nis unclear a guess has been necessary.\r\n\r\nPassages in smaller font in Part IX (The Ritual), that describe actions\r\nto be taken by a minister or the congregation, are identified by +plus\r\nsigns+.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n THE DOCTRINES\r\n AND\r\n DISCIPLINE\r\n OF THE\r\n\r\n COLORED METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n REVISED EDITION 1918\r\n\r\n\r\n COPYRIGHTED 1918,\r\n By The AGENT and Publishers of the\r\n COLORED M. E. CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Episcopal Address=\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Members of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church:\r\n\r\nWe esteem it our duty and privilege most earnestly to recommend to you,\r\nas members of our Church, our form of Discipline, which has been founded\r\non the experience of a long series of years.\r\n\r\nWe wish to see this publication in the house of every member of the\r\nColored Methodist Episcopal Church; and the more so, as it contains the\r\nArticles of Religion maintained more or less, in part or in whole, by\r\nevery reformed Church in the world.\r\n\r\nFar from wishing you to be ignorant of any of our doctrines, or any part\r\nof our Discipline, we desire you to read, mark, learn, and inwardly\r\ndigest the whole. You ought, next to the Word of God, to procure the\r\nArticles and Canons of the Church to which you belong.\r\n\r\nWe deem it proper, in this place, to give you a brief account of the\r\norganization of our Connection:\r\n\r\nFrom the introduction of Methodism on this continent, we have ever\r\nconstituted a part of the great Methodist family—first, as members of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal Church in America, and also after the change\r\ntook place by which we were known as the Methodist Episcopal Church in\r\nthe United States; and when the division took place, in 1844, which we\r\nregard as a legal and constitutional division of the Church, we formed a\r\npart of that division called the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,\r\nwhich relation we continued to sustain until the organization of our\r\nChurch took place at the General Conference held at Jackson, Tenn.,\r\nwhich began its session December 15, 1870. The day was spent in prayer\r\nand supplication to the Almighty that his blessings might rest upon us;\r\nand on the following day the regular business of the session began,\r\nBishop Robert Paine, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in\r\nthe chair.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which led to our separate and distinct organization\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,\r\nmet in New Orleans, April, 1866, the Conference found that, by\r\nrevolution and the fortunes of war, a change had taken place in our\r\npolitical and social relation, which made it necessary that a change\r\nshould also be made in our ecclesiastical relations, and provision was\r\nmade for our organization into separate congregations, Districts, and\r\nAnnual Conferences, if we desired it; and that when two or more Annual\r\nConferences should be formed, if it was our wish, and met the\r\napprobation of the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, we\r\nshould have a General Conference organization like that of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church, South, and that our preachers should receive\r\nordination according to the regulations and requirements of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, South, as Deacons and Elders; and should a\r\nGeneral Conference be organized, and suitable men be elected to the\r\noffice of Bishops, that the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\r\nSouth, would ordain and set them apart as Chief Pastors among us. At the\r\nGeneral Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, at Memphis,\r\nTennessee, May, 1870, it was found that five Annual Conferences had been\r\nformed among us, and that an almost universal desire had been expressed\r\non our part that we might be organized into a separate and distinct\r\nChurch, which was acquiesced in by the Bishops of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church, South, and recommended to said Conference in their\r\naddress; whereupon, by our request, the Bishops of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church, South, together with A. L. P. Green, Samuel Watson,\r\nEdmund W. Sehon, Thomas Whitehead, R. J. Morgan, and Thomas Taylor, were\r\nappointed by said Conference to aid in organizing our General Conference\r\nat the time and place above specified. At the succeeding sessions of our\r\nAnnual Conferences, delegates were elected to attend our General\r\nConference, in accordance with the Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch, South.\r\n\r\nIt was further determined by the acts of the General Conference of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, South, 1866, that should the time arrive\r\nwhen we should be formed into a separate and distinct organization, that\r\nall property which was intended for the use and benefit of people of\r\ncolor, held by the Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,\r\nshould be transferred to Trustees appointed by us, to be held forever\r\nfor our use and benefit.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the facts in the case that our record is clear, and\r\nthat we have descended regularly from the very father of Methodism, and\r\nthat our organization is both legal and constitutional.\r\n\r\nWe remain your very affectionate brethren and pastors, who labor night\r\nand day, both in public and in private, for your good.\r\n\r\n LUCIUS H.

OF FAITH IN THE HOLY TRINITY.\r\n\r\nThere is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body or\r\nparts; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the maker and preserver\r\nof all things, both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead,\r\nthere are three persons of one substance, power, and eternity—the\r\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. OF THE WORD, OR SON OF GOD WHO WAS MADE VERY MAN.\r\n\r\nThe Son, who is the Word of the Father, the very and eternal God, of one\r\nsubstance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the blessed\r\nVirgin; so that two whole and perfect natures—that is to say, the\r\nGodhead and manhood—were joined together in one person, never to be\r\ndivided, whereof is one Christ, very God and very man, who truly\r\nsuffered, was crucified, dead and buried, to reconcile his Father to us,\r\nand to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for actual\r\nsins of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST\r\n\r\nChrist did truly rise again from the dead, and took again his body, with\r\nall things appertaining to the perfection of man's nature, wherewith he\r\nascended into heaven, and there sitteth until he return to judge all men\r\nat the last day.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. OF THE HOLY GHOST.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one\r\nsubstance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and\r\neternal God.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES FOR SALVATION\r\n\r\nThe Holy Scriptures contain all things necessary to salvation; so that\r\nwhatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be\r\nrequired of any man, that it should be believed as an article of faith,\r\nor be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the\r\nHoly Scripture, we do understand those canonical books of the Old and\r\nNew Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAMES OF THE CANONICAL BOOKS\r\n\r\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\r\nThe First Book of Samuel, The Second Book of Samuel, The First Book of\r\nKings, The Second Book of Kings, The First Book of Chronicles, The\r\nSecond Book of Chronicles, The Book of Ezra, The Book of Nehemiah, The\r\nBook of Esther, The Book of Job, The Psalms, The Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,\r\nor the Preacher, Cantica, or Songs of Solomon, Four Prophets the\r\ngreater, Twelve Prophets the less. All the books of the New Testament,\r\nas they are commonly received, we do receive and account canonical.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. OF THE OLD TESTAMENT\r\n\r\nThe Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and\r\nNew Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is\r\nthe only Mediator between God and man, being God and man. Wherefore,\r\nthey are not to be heard who feign that the old fathers did look only\r\nfor transitory promises. Although the law given from God by Moses, as\r\ntouching ceremonies and rites, doth not bind Christians, nor ought the\r\ncivil precepts thereof of necessity to be received in any Commonwealth,\r\nyet, notwithstanding, no Christian whatsoever is free from the obedience\r\nof the commandments which are called moral.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. OF ORIGINAL OR BIRTH-SIN\r\n\r\nOriginal Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do\r\nvainly talk,) but it is the corruption of the nature of every man, that\r\nnaturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very\r\nfar gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to\r\nevil, and that continually.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. OF FREE-WILL\r\n\r\nThe condition of man after the fall of Adam is such that he can not turn\r\nand prepare himself, by his own natural strength and works, to faith and\r\ncalling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do good works, pleasant\r\nand acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us,\r\nthat we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that\r\ngood will.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. OF THE JUSTIFICATION OF MAN\r\n\r\nWe are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord\r\nand Savior Jesus Christ, by faith, and not for our own works or\r\ndeservings; wherefore, that we are justified by faith only, is a most\r\nwholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. OF GOOD WORKS\r\n\r\nAlthough good works, which are the fruits of faith and follow after\r\njustification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of\r\nGod's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ,\r\nand spring out of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a\r\nlively faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by its fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. OF WORKS OF SUPEREROGATION\r\n\r\nVoluntary works, besides over and above God's commandments, which are\r\ncalled works of supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and\r\nimpiety. For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto\r\nGod as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake\r\nthan of bounded duty is required; whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye\r\nhave done all that is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. OF SIN AFTER JUSTIFICATION\r\n\r\nNot every sin willingly committed after justification, is the sin\r\nagainst the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of\r\nrepentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after\r\njustification. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from\r\ngrace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and\r\namend our lives. And, therefore, they are to be condemned who say they\r\ncan no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of\r\nforgiveness to such as truly repent.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which\r\nthe pure word of God is preached, and the sacraments duly administered,\r\naccording to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity\r\nare requisite to the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. OF PURGATORY\r\n\r\nThe Romanish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardons, worshiping, and\r\nadoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of\r\nsaints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant\r\nof Scripture, but repugnant to the word of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. OF SPEAKING IN THE CONGREGATION IN SUCH A TONGUE AS THE PEOPLE\r\nUNDERSTAND\r\n\r\nIt is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God and the custom of the\r\nPrimitive Church, to have public prayer in the Church or to minister the\r\nsacraments in a tongue not understood by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. OF THE SACRAMENTS\r\n\r\nSacraments, ordained of Christ, are not only badges or tokens of\r\nChristian men's profession, but rather they are certain signs of grace,\r\nand God's good will toward us, by the which he doth work invisibly in\r\nus, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our faith\r\nin him.\r\n\r\nThere are two sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that\r\nis to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThose five commonly called sacraments—that is to say, Confirmation,\r\nPenance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction—are not to be counted\r\nfor sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have partly grown out of the\r\n=corrupt= following of the apostles, and partly are states of life\r\nallowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not the like nature of Baptism\r\nand the Lord's Supper, because they have not any visible sign or\r\nceremony ordained of God.\r\n\r\nThe sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be\r\ncarried about; but that we should duly use them. And in such only as\r\nworthily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation;\r\nbut they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves\r\ncondemnation, as St. Paul saith, 1 Cor. xi. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. OF BAPTISM\r\n\r\nBaptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby\r\nChristians are distinguished from others that are not baptized; but it\r\nis also a sign of regeneration, or the new birth. The baptism of young\r\nchildren is to be retained in the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. OF THE LORD'S SUPPER\r\n\r\nThe Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians\r\nought to have among themselves one to another, but rather is a sacrament\r\nof our redemption by Christ's death; insomuch that, to such as rightly,\r\nworthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a\r\npartaking of the body of Christ; and likewise the cup of blessing is a\r\npartaking of the blood of Christ.\r\n\r\nTransubstantiation, or the change of the substance of bread and wine in\r\nthe Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant\r\nto the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a sacrament,\r\nand hath given occasion to many superstitions.\r\n\r\nThe body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after\r\na heavenly and spiritual manner. And the means whereby the body of\r\nChrist is received and eaten in the Supper, is faith.\r\n\r\nThe sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance\r\nreserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. OF BOTH KINDS\r\n\r\nThe cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people; for both the\r\nparts of the Lord's Supper, by Christ's ordinance and commandment, ought\r\nto be administered to all Christians alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. OF THE ONE OBLATION OF CHRIST, FINISHED UPON THE CROSS\r\n\r\nThe offering of Christ once made, is that perfect redemption,\r\npropitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both\r\noriginal and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin but\r\nthat alone. Wherefore the sacrifice of masses, in the which it is\r\ncommonly said that the priest doth offer Christ for the quick and the\r\ndead, to have remission of pain or guilt, is a blasphemous fable and\r\ndangerous deceit.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. OF THE MARRIAGE OF MINISTERS\r\n\r\nThe ministers of Christ are not commanded by God's law either to vow the\r\nestate of single life or to abstain from marriage; therefore it is\r\nlawful to marry at their own discretion, as for them, as for all other\r\nChristians, they shall judge the same to serve best to Godliness.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. OF THE RITES AND CEREMONIES OF CHURCHES\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that rites and ceremonies should in all places be\r\nthe same, or exactly alike; for they have been always different, and may\r\nbe changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's\r\nmanners, so that nothing be ordained against God's word. Whosoever,\r\nthrough his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break\r\nthe rites and ceremonies of the Church to which he belongs, which are\r\nnot repugnant to the word of God, and are ordained and approved by\r\ncommon authority, ought to be rebuked openly, that others may fear to do\r\nthe like, as one that offendeth against the common order of the Church,\r\nand woundeth the consciences of weak brethren.\r\n\r\nEvery particular Church may ordain, change, or abolish rights and\r\nceremonies, so that all things may be done to edification.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. OF THE RULERS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe president, the congress, the general assemblies, the governors, and\r\nthe councils of state, =as the delegates of the people= are the rulers\r\nof the United States of America, according to the division of power made\r\nto them by the constitution of the United States, and by the\r\nconstitution of their respective States. And the said States are a\r\nsovereign and independent nation, and ought not to be subject to any\r\nforeign jurisdiction.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. OF CHRISTIAN MEN'S GOODS\r\n\r\nThe riches and goods of Christians are not common, as touching the\r\nright, title, and possession of the same, as some do falsely boast.\r\nNotwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,\r\nliberally to give alms to the poor according to his ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. OF A CHRISTIAN MAN'S OATH\r\n\r\nAs we confess that vain and rash by our Lord Jesus Christ and James, his\r\napostle, so we judge that the Christian religion doth not prohibit, but\r\nthat a man may swear when the magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith\r\nswearing is forbidden Christian men and charity, so it be done according\r\nto the prophet's teaching, in justice judgment, and truth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As far as it respects civil affairs, we believe it the duty\r\nof Christians and especially all Christian ministers, to be subject to\r\nthe supreme authority of the country where they reside, and to use all\r\nlaudable means to enjoin obedience to the powers that be; and,\r\ntherefore, it is expected that all our preachers and people, who may be\r\nunder any foreign government, will behave themselves as peaceable and\r\norderly subjects.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.\r\n THE GENERAL RULES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Rules of \"The United Societies\" organized by Mr. Wesley in\r\n1739, are as follows:\r\n\r\nThere is only one condition previously required of those who desire\r\nadmission into these societies, a \"desire to flee from the wrath to\r\ncome, and to be saved from their sins.\" But wherever this is really\r\nfixed in the soul, it will be shown by its fruits. It is therefore\r\nexpected of all who continue therein that they shall evidence their\r\ndesire of salvation—\r\n\r\nFirst, by doing no harm, by avoiding evil of every kind, especially that\r\nwhich is most generally practiced; such as:\r\n\r\nThe taking of the name of God in vain;\r\n\r\nThe profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work\r\ntherein, or by buying or selling;\r\n\r\nDrunkenness, or drinking spirituous liquors unless in cases of\r\nnecessity;\r\n\r\n=Fighting=, quarreling, brawling, brother =going to law= with brother,\r\nreturning evil for evil, or railing for railing; the =using many words=\r\nin buying or selling.\r\n\r\nThe =buying or selling goods that have not paid the duty=;\r\n\r\nThe =giving or taking things on usury=, i.e., unlawful interest;\r\n\r\n=Uncharitable or unprofitable= conversation, particularly, speaking evil\r\nof magistrates or of ministers;\r\n\r\nDoing to others as we would not they should do unto us;\r\n\r\nDoing what we know is not for the glory of God: as,\r\n\r\nThe =putting on of gold and costly apparel=;\r\n\r\nThe =taking such diversions= as can not be used in the name of the Lord\r\nJesus;\r\n\r\nThe =singing= those =songs=, or =reading= those =books=, which do not\r\ntend to the knowledge or love of God;\r\n\r\nSoftness or needless self-indulgence;\r\n\r\nLaying up treasure upon earth;\r\n\r\nBorrowing without a probability of paying, or taking up goods without a\r\nprobability of paying for them.\r\n\r\nIt is expected of all who continue in these societies, that they should\r\ncontinue to evidence their desire of salvation—\r\n\r\nSecondly, by doing good, by being in every kind merciful after their\r\npower, as they have opportunity, doing good of every possible sort, and\r\nas far as possible, to all men;\r\n\r\nTo their bodies, of the ability which God giveth, by giving food to the\r\nhungry, by clothing the naked, by visiting or helping them that are sick\r\nor in prison;\r\n\r\nTo their souls, by instructing, reproving, or exhorting all we have any\r\nintercourse with, trampling under foot that enthusiastic doctrine that\r\nwe are not to do good unless =our hearts be free to do it=.\r\n\r\nBy doing good, especially to them that are of the household of faith, or\r\ngroaning so to be, employing them preferably to others, buying one of\r\nanother, helping each other in business; and so much the more because\r\nthe world will love its own, and them =only=.\r\n\r\nBy all possible diligence and =frugality=, that the gospel be not\r\nblamed. By running with patience the race which is set before them,\r\n=denying themselves, and taking up their cross daily=; submitting to\r\nbear the reproach of Christ, to be as the filth and off-scouring of the\r\nworld; and looking that men should say =all manner of evil of them\r\nfalsely for the Lord's sake=.\r\n\r\nIt is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that\r\nthey should continue to evidence their desire of salvation—\r\n\r\nThirdly, by attending upon all the ordinances of God, such as;\r\n\r\nThe public worship of God;\r\n\r\nThe ministry of the word, either read =or= expounded;\r\n\r\nThe Supper of the Lord;\r\n\r\nFamily and private prayer;\r\n\r\nSearching the Scriptures, and\r\n\r\nFasting or abstinence.\r\n\r\nThese are the General Rules of our societies; all of which we are taught\r\nof God to observe, even in his written word, which is the only rule, and\r\nthe sufficient rule, both of our faith and practice. And all these we\r\nknow his Spirit writes on truly awakened hearts. If there be any among\r\nus who observe them not, who habitually break any of them, let it be\r\nknown unto them who watch over that soul, as they who must give an\r\naccount. We will admonish him of the error of his ways; we will bear\r\nwith him for a season; but if then he repent not, he hath no more place\r\namong us; we have delivered our own souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n =PART II.=\r\n THE CONFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.\r\n GENERAL CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. 1.

The General Conference shall meet in the month of May, once in four\r\nyears perpetually, in such place or places as shall be fixed on by the\r\nGeneral Conference from time to time.\r\n\r\n5. The Bishops, or a majority of all the Annual Conferences shall have\r\nauthority to call a General Conference, if they judge it necessary, at\r\nany time.\r\n\r\n6.

The General Conference shall have full powers to make rules and\r\nregulations for our Church under the following limitations and\r\nrestrictions, viz:\r\n\r\n (1) The General Conference shall not revoke, alter, or change our\r\n Articles of Religion, or establish any new standards or rule of\r\n doctrine contrary to our present existing and established standards of\r\n doctrine.\r\n\r\n (2) They shall not allow of more than one representative for every\r\n fourteen members of the Annual Conference, nor allow of a less number\r\n than one for every thirty; =provided=, nevertheless, that when there\r\n shall be in any Annual Conference a fraction of two-thirds the number\r\n which shall be fixed for the ratio of representation, such Annual\r\n Conference shall be entitled to an additional delegate for such\r\n fraction; and =provided=, also, that no Conference shall be denied the\r\n privilege of two delegates.\r\n\r\n (3) They shall not change or alter any part or rule of our government,\r\n so as to do away with episcopacy, or destroy the plan of our itinerant\r\n general superintendency.\r\n\r\n (4) They shall not revoke or change the General Rules of the United\r\n Societies.\r\n\r\n (5) They shall not do away with the privilege of our ministers or\r\n preachers of trial by a committee and of an appeal; neither shall they\r\n do away with the privileges of our members of trial before the Church\r\n or by a committee, and of an appeal.\r\n\r\n=Provided=, nevertheless, that upon the concurrent recommendation of\r\nthree-fourths of all the members of the several Annual Conferences, who\r\nshall be present and vote on such recommendation, then a majority of\r\ntwo-thirds of the General Conference succeeding shall suffice to alter\r\nany of the above restrictions, excepting the first article; and also,\r\nwhenever such alterations shall have been first recommended by\r\ntwo-thirds of the General Conference, so soon as three-fourths of the\r\nmembers of all the Annual Conferences shall have concurred as aforesaid,\r\nsuch alteration or alterations shall take effect.\r\n\r\n=Provided=, that when any rule or regulation is adopted by the General\r\nConference, which, in the opinion of the Bishops, is unconstitutional,\r\nthe Bishops may present to the Conference which passed said rule or\r\nregulation, their objections thereto, with their reasons, in writing;\r\nand if then the General Conference shall, by a two-thirds vote, adhere\r\nto its action on said rule or regulation, it shall then take the course\r\nprescribed for altering a restrictive rule, and thus passed upon\r\naffirmatively, the Bishops shall announce that such rule or regulation\r\ntakes effect from that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.\r\n ANNUAL CONFERENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. 1.

ADMITTING PREACHERS ON TRIAL\r\n\r\nQues. How is a preacher to be admitted on trial into the traveling\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nAns. 1. By the Annual Conference. In the interval of the Conference, he\r\nmay be received and employed in the work by a Bishop, or the Presiding\r\nElder of the District, until the sitting of the Conference.\r\n\r\n2. No one shall be admitted on trial unless he procures a recommendation\r\nfrom the Quarterly Conference; nor shall a vote be taken upon the\r\nadmission of any candidate who shall not have passed an approved\r\nexamination upon the course of study prescribed by the Bishops, before a\r\ncommittee appointed by the Bishop for the purpose.\r\n\r\n3. The Annual Conference may then admit him as a probationer by a vote\r\nof the majority. Observe taking on trial is entirely different from\r\nadmitting a preacher into full connection. One on trial may be, either\r\nadmitted or rejected without doing him any wrong; otherwise it would be\r\nno trial at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ADMITTING PREACHERS INTO FULL CONNECTION\r\n\r\nQues.

Before any preacher is admitted into full connection, he shall have\r\npassed an approved examination upon the Course of Study prescribed by\r\nthe Bishops for candidates for the ministry; and in no case shall a vote\r\nbe taken to admit any one until he is recommended by the examining\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n3. A missionary employed on a foreign mission may be admitted into full\r\nconnection, if recommended by the superintendent of the mission where he\r\nlabors, without being present at the Annual Conference for examination.\r\n\r\nQues. 2. What method do we use in admitting a preacher into full\r\nconnection at the Conference?\r\n\r\nAns. After solemn fasting and prayer, every person proposed shall then\r\nbe asked before the Conference the following questions, (with any,\r\nothers which may be thought necessary), namely: Have you faith in\r\nChrist? Are you going on to perfection? Are you groaning after it? Are\r\nyou resolved to devote yourself wholly to God and his work? Are you\r\nwilling to conform to the Discipline of the Church? Will you diligently\r\ninstruct the children in every place? Will you visit from house to\r\nhouse? Will you recommend fasting, or abstinence, both by precept and\r\nexample? Will you especially observe the following directions?—\r\n\r\n 1. Be diligent. Never be unemployed. Never be triflingly employed.\r\n Never trifle away time; neither spend any more time at any place than\r\n is strictly necessary.\r\n\r\n 2. Be punctual. Do every thing exactly at the time. And do not mend our\r\n rules, but keep them; not for wrath, but conscience's sake.\r\n\r\n 3. Act in all things not according to your own will, but as a son in\r\n the gospel. It is therefore your duty to employ your time in the manner\r\n which we direct; in preaching, meeting the classes, visiting from house\r\n to house, and especially visiting the sick; in reading, meditation and\r\n prayer. Above all, if you labor with us in the Lord's vineyard, it is\r\n needful you should do that part of the work which we advise at those\r\n times and places which we judge best for his glory.\r\n\r\n If he gives satisfactory answers to these questions, the Conference, by\r\n a vote of the majority, may admit him into full connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

On a second\r\noffense, the preacher or leader may take one or two faithful friends. On\r\na third offense, let the case be brought before the Church, or a select\r\nnumber; and if there be no sign of real humiliation, the offender must\r\nbe cut off.\r\n\r\n3. If a member of our Church endeavor to sow dissension in any of our\r\nsocieties, by inveighing against either our doctrines or Discipline,\r\nsuch person so offending shall be first reproved by the senior minister\r\nor preacher of his circuit; and if he persist in such pernicious\r\npractices, he shall be expelled from the Church.\r\n\r\nQues. 2.

And if any member of our Church shall refuse, in cases of debt or\r\nother disputes, to refer the matter to arbitration, when recommended by\r\nhim who has the charge of the circuit, or shall enter into a lawsuit\r\nwith another member before these measures are taken, he shall be\r\nexpelled, unless the case be of such a nature as to require and justify\r\na process of law.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in all the above mentioned cases of trial and expulsion,\r\nan appeal to the ensuing Quarterly Conference shall be allowed, if the\r\ncondemned person signifies to the pastor his intention to appeal at the\r\ntime of his condemnation, or at any time thereafter when he is informed\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n MINISTERIAL COURT OF APPEALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Every man as he purposeth in\r\nhis heart, so let him give not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God\r\nloveth a cheerful giver.—2 Cor. ix. 6, 7.\r\n\r\nAs we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,\r\nespecially unto them who are of the household of faith.—Gal. vi. 10.\r\n\r\nGodliness with contentment is great gain; for we brought nothing into\r\nthis world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.—1 Tim. vi. 6, 7.\r\n\r\nCharge them that are rich in this world, that they be ready to\r\ndistribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a\r\ngood foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on\r\neternal life. 1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19.\r\n\r\nGod is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye\r\nhave showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints,\r\nand do minister.—Heb. vi. 10.\r\n\r\nTo do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with such sacrifices God\r\nis well pleased.—Heb. xiii. 16.\r\n\r\nWhoso hath this world's goods, and seeth his brother have need, and\r\nshutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of\r\nGod in him?—1 John iii. 17.\r\n\r\nHe that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord; and that which\r\nhe hath given will he pay him again.—Prov. xix. 17.\r\n\r\nBlessed is he that considereth the poor; the Lord will deliver him in\r\ntime of trouble.—Psalm xli. 1.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the elder read this invitation+\r\n\r\nYe that do truly and earnestly repent of your sins, and are in love and\r\ncharity with your neighbors, and intend to lead a new life, following\r\nthe commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in his holy ways,\r\ndraw near with faith, and take this holy sacrament to your comfort, and\r\nmake your humble confession to Almighty God, meekly kneeling upon your\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the general confession be made by the minister, in the name\r\nof all those who are minded to receive the holy communion, both he and\r\nall the people kneeling humbly upon their knees and saying:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,\r\nJudge of all men, we acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and\r\nwickedness, which we from time to time most grievously have committed,\r\nby thought, word and deed, against thy Divine Majesty, provoking most\r\njustly thy wrath and indignation against us. We do earnestly repent, and\r\nare heartily sorry for these our misdoings; the remembrance of them is\r\ngrievous unto us. Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful\r\nFather: for thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake forgive us all that is\r\npast, and grant that we may ever hereafter serve and please thee in\r\nnewness of life, to the honor and glory of thy name, through Jesus\r\nChrist our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Elder say:+\r\n\r\nO Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, who of thy great mercy hast\r\npromised forgiveness of sins to all them that with hearty repentance and\r\ntrue faith turn to thee; have mercy upon us; pardon and deliver us from\r\nall our sins, confirm and strengthen us in all goodness, and bring us to\r\neverlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLECT\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from\r\nwhom no secrets are hid; cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the\r\ninspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and\r\nworthily magnify thy holy name, through Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Elder say:+\r\n\r\nIt is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all\r\ntimes, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord, Holy Father,\r\nAlmighty, Everlasting God.\r\n\r\nTherefore with angels and archangels, and with all the company of\r\nheaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious name, evermore praising thee,\r\nand saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord, God of hosts, heaven and earth are\r\nfull of thy glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord most high.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Elder say:+\r\n\r\nWe do not presume to come to this thy table, O merciful Lord, trusting\r\nin our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We are\r\nnot worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy table. But thou\r\nart the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy; Grant us,\r\ntherefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus\r\nChrist, and to drink his blood that our sinful souls and bodies may be\r\nmade clean by his death, and washed through his most precious blood, and\r\nthat we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then the Elder shall say the prayer of consecration as followeth:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, our Heavenly Father, who of thy tender mercy didst give\r\nthine only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death upon the cross for our\r\nredemption; who made there (by his oblation of himself once offered) a\r\nfull, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for\r\nthe sins of the whole world; and did institute, and in his holy Gospel\r\ncommand us to continue, a perpetual memory of that his precious death\r\nuntil his coming again: hear us, O merciful Father, we most humbly\r\nbeseech thee, and grant that we, receiving these thy creatures of bread\r\nand wine, according to thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy\r\ninstitution, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers\r\nof his most blessed body and blood; who in the same night that he was\r\nbetrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave\r\nit to his disciples, saying, Take, eat; this is my body which is given\r\nfor you: do this in remembrance of me. Likewise after supper he took the\r\ncup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them saying, Drink ye\r\nall of this; for this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed\r\nfor you and for many, for the remission of sins; do this, as oft as ye\r\nshall drink it, in remembrance of me.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister first receive the communion in both kinds\r\nhimself, and then proceed to deliver the same to the other minister in\r\nlike manner, if any be present. Then shall he say the Lord's Prayer, the\r\npeople still kneeling and repeating after him every petition:+\r\n\r\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;\r\nthy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our\r\ndaily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\r\ntrespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\r\nfrom evil; for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,\r\nforever and ever.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then a hymn may be sung, and the communicants shall be invited to the\r\ntable. The minister shall deliver both kinds to the people unto their\r\nhands. When he delivereth the bread he shall say:+\r\n\r\nThe body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for =thee=, preserve\r\n=thy soul= and =body= unto everlasting life. Take and eat this in\r\nremembrance that Christ died for =thee=, and feed on him in =thy heart=\r\nby faith with thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n+And the minister that delivereth the cup shall say:+\r\n\r\nThe blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for =thee=, preserve\r\n=thy soul= and =body= unto everlasting life. Drink this in remembrance\r\nthat Christ's blood was shed for thee, and be thankful.\r\n\r\n+When all have communed, the minister shall return to the Lord's table,\r\nand place upon it what remaineth of the consecrated elements, covering\r\nthe same with a fair linen cloth.+\r\n\r\n+The minister may then say as followeth:+\r\n\r\nO Lord and Heavenly Father, we thy humble servants desire thy fatherly\r\ngoodness mercifully to accept this our sacrifice of praise and\r\nthanksgiving, most humbly beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits\r\nand death of thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we\r\nand thy whole Church may obtain remission of our sins. And here we offer\r\nand present unto thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a\r\nreasonable, holy and lively sacrifice unto thee; humbly beseeching thee\r\nthat all we who are partakers of this holy communion may be filled with\r\nthy grace and heavenly benediction. And although we be unworthy, through\r\nour manifold sins, to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet we beseech thee\r\nto accept this our bounden duty and service; not weighing our merits,\r\nbut pardoning our offenses, through Jesus Christ our Lord: by whom, and\r\nwith whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost all honor and glory be unto\r\nthee, O Father Almighty, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then may be said:+\r\n\r\nGlory be to God on high, and on earth peace, good-will toward men. We\r\npraise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give\r\nthanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God, heavenly King, God the\r\nFather Almighty.\r\n\r\nO Lord, the only begotten Son, Jesus Christ: O Lord God, Lamb of God,\r\nSon of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy\r\nupon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon\r\nus. Thou that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.\r\nThou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nFor thou only art holy: thou only art the Lord: thou only, O Christ,\r\nwith the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God the Father.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then the Elder, if he see it expedient, may put up an extemporaneous\r\nprayer; and afterwards shall let the people depart with this blessing:+\r\n\r\nMay the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts\r\nand minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ\r\nour Lord; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the\r\nHoly Ghost, be among you, and remain with you always.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+If the Elder be straitened for time, he may omit any part of the\r\nservice except the prayer of consecration.+\r\n\r\n+If the consecrated bread or wine be all spent before all have\r\ncommuned, the Elder may consecrate more, by repeating the prayer of\r\nconsecration.+\r\n\r\n+Let those who have scruples concerning the receiving of the communion\r\nkneeling, be permitted to receive it either standing or sitting; but no\r\nperson shall be admitted to the Lord's Supper among us who is guilty of\r\nany practice for which we would exclude a member of our Church.+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER L.\r\n THE MINISTRATION OF BAPTISM TO INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The minister, coming to the font, which is to be filled with pure\r\nwater, shall use the following, or some other suitable exhortation:+\r\n\r\nDearly beloved, forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin, and\r\nthat our Saviour Christ saith, Except a man be born of water and of the\r\nSpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God: I beseech you to call\r\nupon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his\r\nbounteous mercy he will grant to this =child= that which by nature =he=\r\ncannot have; that =he= may be baptized with water and the Holy Ghost,\r\nand received into Christ's holy Church, and be made a lively member of\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister say, Let us pray:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty and everlasting God, we beseech thee for thine infinite\r\nmercies, that thou wilt look upon =this child=; wash =him= and sanctify\r\n=him= with the Holy Ghost that =he=, being delivered from thy wrath, may\r\nbe received into the ark of Christ's Church, and being steadfast in\r\nfaith, joyful through hope, and rooted in love, may so pass the waves of\r\nthis troublesome world, that finally =he= may come to the land of\r\neverlasting life, there to reign with thee, world without end, through\r\nJesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nO merciful God, grant that the old Adam in =this child= may be so\r\nburied, that the new man may be raised up in =him=.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nGrant that all carnal affections may die in =him=, and that all things\r\nbelonging to the Spirit may live and grow in =him=.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nGrant that =he= may have power and strength to have victory, and to\r\ntriumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nGrant that whosoever is dedicated to thee by our office and ministry may\r\nalso be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly rewarded through\r\nthy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who dost live and govern all things,\r\nworld without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nAlmighty, ever-living God, whose most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ,\r\nfor the forgiveness of our sins did shed out of his most precious side\r\nboth water and blood, and gave commandment to his disciples that they\r\nshould go teach all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father,\r\nand of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: regard, we beseech thee, the\r\nsupplications of thy congregation; and grant that =this child=, now to\r\nbe baptized, may receive the fullness of thy grace, and ever remain in\r\nthe number of thy faithful and elect children, through Jesus Christ our\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the people stand up, and the minister shall say:+\r\n\r\nHear the words of the Gospel written by St. Mark in the tenth chapter,\r\nat the thirteenth verse.\r\n\r\nThey brought young children to Christ, that he should touch them. And\r\nhis disciples rebuked those that brought them; but when Jesus saw it, he\r\nwas much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to\r\ncome unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.\r\nVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as\r\na little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his\r\narms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.\r\n\r\n+Then the minister, addressing the parents or others presenting the\r\nchild, shall say:+\r\n\r\nIn causing =this child= to be brought by baptism into the Church of\r\nChrist, it is your duty to teach =him= to renounce the devil and all his\r\nworks, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires\r\nof the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that =he= may not\r\nfollow or be led by them; to believe all the articles of the Christian\r\nfaith; and to obediently keep God's holy will and commandments all the\r\ndays of =his= life.\r\n\r\n+Then the minister shall take the child into his hands, if convenient,\r\nand say to the friends of the child:+\r\n\r\nNAME THIS CHILD\r\n\r\nN., I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\r\nHoly Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+The minister may, at his discretion, lay hands on the subject,\r\naccompanying the act with a suitable invocation, and then, all kneeling,\r\nclose with extemporaneous devotions and the Lord's Prayer:+\r\n\r\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;\r\nthy will be done on earth, as it is heaven; give us this day our daily\r\nbread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass\r\nagainst us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LI.\r\n THE MINISTRATION OF BAPTISM TO SUCH AS ARE OF RIPER YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The minister, coming to the font, which is to be filled with pure\r\nwater, shall use the following, or some other suitable exhortation:+\r\n\r\nDearly beloved, forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin, (and\r\nthat which is born of the flesh is flesh, and they that are in the flesh\r\ncannot please God, but live in sin, committing many actual\r\ntransgressions,) and that our Saviour Christ saith, Except a man be born\r\nof water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God; I\r\nbeseech you to call upon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nthat of his bounteous goodness he will grant to =these persons= that\r\nwhich by nature =they= cannot have: that =they= may be baptized with\r\nwater and the Holy Ghost, and received into Christ's holy Church, and be\r\nmade lively =members= of the same.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister say:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty and immortal God, the aid of all that need, the helper of all\r\nthat flee to thee for succor, the life of them that believe, and the\r\nresurrection of the dead: we call upon thee for =these persons= now to\r\nbe baptized. Receive =them=, O Lord, as thou hast promised by thy\r\nwell-beloved Son, saying, Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall\r\nfind; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: so give now unto us that\r\nask; let us that seek find; open the gate unto us that knock; that\r\n=these persons= may enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly\r\nwashing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised by\r\nChrist our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the people stand up, and the minister shall say:+\r\n\r\nHear the words of the Gospel, written by St. John in the third chapter,\r\nbeginning at the first verse.\r\n\r\nThere was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.\r\nThe same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that\r\nthou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles that\r\nthou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him,\r\nVerily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again he cannot\r\nsee the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born\r\nwhen he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and\r\nbe born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man\r\nbe born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of\r\nGod. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of\r\nthe Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born\r\nagain. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound\r\nthereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so\r\nis every one that is born of the Spirit.\r\n\r\n+Then the minister shall speak to the persons to be baptized on this\r\nwise:+\r\n\r\nWell-beloved, who are come hither, desiring to receive holy baptism, =ye\r\nhave= heard how the congregation hath prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nwould vouchsafe to receive =you=, and bless =you=, to release =you= of\r\nyour sins, to give =you= the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting life.\r\nAnd our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised in his holy word to grant all\r\nthose things that we have prayed for; which promise he for his part will\r\nmost surely keep and perform.\r\n\r\nWherefore after this promise made by Christ, =ye= must also faithfully,\r\nfor =your= part, promise, in the presence of this whole congregation,\r\nthat =ye= will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly\r\nbelieve God's holy word, and obediently keep his commandments.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister demand of each of the persons to be baptized,\r\nseverally:+\r\n\r\nQues. Doth thou renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and\r\nglory of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the\r\ncarnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow or be led by\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nAns. I renounce them all.\r\n\r\nQues. Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and\r\nearth? and in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord? and that he\r\nwas conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary? that he\r\nsuffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried? that he\r\nrose again the third day? that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at\r\nthe right hand of God the Father Almighty, and from thence shall come\r\nagain at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead?\r\n\r\nAnd dost thou believe in the Holy Ghost, the Church of God, the\r\ncommunion of saints, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the\r\nbody, and everlasting life after death?\r\n\r\nAns. All this I steadfastly believe.\r\n\r\nQues. Wilt thou be baptized in this faith?\r\n\r\nAns. This is my desire.\r\n\r\nQues. Wilt thou then obediently keep God's holy will and commandments,\r\nand walk in the same all the days of thy life?\r\n\r\nAns. I will endeavor so to do, God being my helper.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister say:+\r\n\r\nO merciful God, grant that the old Adam in =these= persons may be so\r\nburied, that the new man may be raised up in =them=.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nGrant that all carnal affections may die in =them=, and that all things\r\nbelonging to the Spirit may live and grow in =them=.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nGrant that =they= may have power and strength to have victory, and to\r\ntriumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nGrant that =they=, being here dedicated to thee by our office and\r\nministry, may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly\r\nrewarded, through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who dost live and\r\ngovern all things, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nAlmighty, ever-living God, whose most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ\r\nfor the forgiveness of our sins, did shed out of his most precious side\r\nboth water and blood; and gave commandment to his disciples, that they\r\nshould go teach all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father,\r\nand of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: regard, we beseech thee, the\r\nsupplications of this congregation; and grant that the =persons= now to\r\nbe baptized may receive the fullness of thy grace, and ever remain in\r\nthe number of thy faithful and elect children, through Jesus Christ our\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister take each person to be baptized by the right\r\nhand; and placing him conveniently by the font, according to his\r\ndiscretion, shall ask the name; and then shall sprinkle or pour water\r\nupon him, (or, if he shall desire it, shall immerse him in water),\r\nsaying:+\r\n\r\nN., I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\r\nHoly Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+The minister may, at his discretion, lay hands on the subject,\r\naccompanying the act with a suitable invocation.+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LII.\r\n FORM OF THE RECEPTION AND RECOGNITION OF CHURCH MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The minister shall cause the candidates to be placed before the\r\ncongregation, and after baptizing any who may not have been previously\r\nbaptized he shall say:+\r\n\r\nBrethren, the Church is of God, and will be preserved to the end of\r\ntime, for the promotion of his worship and the due administration of his\r\nword and ordinances—the maintenance of Christian fellowship and\r\ndiscipline—the edification of believers, and the conversion of the\r\nworld. All, of every age and station, stand in need of the means of\r\ngrace which it alone supplies; and it invites all alike to become\r\nfellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God. But as none\r\nwho have arrived at years of discretion can remain within its pales or\r\nbe admitted to its communion, without assuming its obligations, it is my\r\nduty to demand of these persons present whether they are resolved to\r\nassume the same.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister address the candidates, as follows:+\r\n\r\nDearly beloved, you profess to have a desire to flee from the wrath to\r\ncome and to be saved from your sins; you seek the fellowship of the\r\npeople of God, to assist you in working out your salvation; I therefore\r\ndemand of you:\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly, in the presence of God and this congregation, ratify\r\nand confirm the promise and vow of repentance, faith, and obedience,\r\ncontained in the baptismal convent?\r\n\r\nAns. I do, God being my helper.\r\n\r\nWill you be subject to the discipline of the Church, attend upon its\r\nordinances, and support its institutions?\r\n\r\nAns. I will endeavor so to do, by the help of God.\r\n\r\n+The minister shall then say to the candidates:+\r\n\r\nWe rejoice to recognize you as members of the Church of Christ, and bid\r\nyou welcome to all its privileges; and in token of our brotherly love,\r\nwe give you the right hand of fellowship, and pray that you may be both\r\nnumbered with his people here, and with his saints in glory everlasting.\r\n\r\n+The minister shall then say to the congregation:+\r\n\r\nBrethren, I commend to your love and care these persons whom we this day\r\nrecognize as members of the Church of Christ. Do all in your power to\r\nincrease their faith, confirm their hope, and perfect them in love.\r\n\r\n+Then may follow a hymn suitable to the occasion (as 881-889), and the\r\nminister shall say:+\r\n\r\nLet us pray.\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, we thank thee for founding thy Church, and promising that\r\nthe gates of hell shall not prevail against it. We bless thee for\r\ncalling us to the fellowship of thy people, and for numbering us with\r\nthe sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty. We especially praise thy\r\nname for enabling these thy servants to avouch the Lord to be their God.\r\nHelp them to perform the promise and vow which they have made; to\r\nrenounce the devil, the world, and the flesh; to believe the record\r\nwhich thou hast given of thy Son; and to walk in all thy commandments\r\nand ordinances blameless, to the end of their lives. May their communion\r\nwith thy people be sanctified to their growth in grace and in the\r\nknowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, being nourished and knit\r\ntogether, increasing with the increase of God. May thy people do them\r\ngood, and may they prove a blessing to thy people. And grant, O Lord,\r\nthat all who are here members of thy militant Church, through thy mercy,\r\nthe merit of thy Son, and the grace of thy Spirit, may finally be made\r\nmembers of thy triumphant Church in heaven.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nAlmighty and everlasting God, Heavenly Father, we give thee humble\r\nthanks, for that thou hast vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy\r\ngrace, and faith in thee; increase this knowledge and confirm this faith\r\nin us evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to these persons, that they, being\r\nborn again, may be made heirs of everlasting salvation, through our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, now\r\nand forever.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;\r\nthy will be done on earth as it is in heaven; give us this day our daily\r\nbread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass\r\nagainst us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LIII.\r\n THE FORM OF SOLEMNIZATION OF MATRIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n+At the day and time appointed for the solemnization of matrimony, the\r\npersons to be married (having been qualified according to law) standing\r\ntogether, the man on the right hand and the woman on the left, the\r\nminister shall say:+\r\n\r\nDearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and\r\nin the presence of these witnesses, to join together this man and this\r\nwoman in holy matrimony; which is an honorable estate, instituted of God\r\nin the time of man's innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union\r\nthat is between Christ and his Church; which holy estate Christ adorned\r\nand beautified with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought in\r\nCana of Galilee, and is commended of St. Paul to be honorable among all\r\nmen; and therefore is not by any to be enterprised, or taken in hand\r\nunadvisedly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, and in the fear of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nInto which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined.\r\nTherefore if any can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be\r\njoined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n+And also speaking unto the persons that are to be married, he shall\r\nsay:+\r\n\r\nI require and charge you both, (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of\r\njudgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed) that if\r\neither of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined\r\ntogether in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured,\r\nthat so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's word doth\r\nallow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony\r\nlawful.\r\n\r\n+If no impediment be alleged, then shall the minister say unto the man:+\r\n\r\nM., Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together\r\nafter God's ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love\r\nher, comfort her, honor, and keep her, in sickness and in health; and,\r\nforsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall\r\nlive?\r\n\r\n+The man shall answer,+\r\n\r\nI WILL.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister say unto the woman:+\r\n\r\nN., Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together\r\nafter God's ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou obey\r\nhim, serve him, love, honor, and keep him, in sickness and in health;\r\nand, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both\r\nshall live?\r\n\r\n+The woman shall answer,+\r\n\r\nI WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n+When the parties so desire, the man shall give unto the woman a ring;\r\nand the minister taking the ring shall deliver it unto the man to put it\r\nupon the fourth finger of the woman's left hand; and the man, holding\r\nthe ring there, and taught by the minister, shall say:+\r\n\r\nWith this ring I thee wed, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow;\r\nin the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister say:+\r\n\r\nLet us pray.\r\n\r\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;\r\nthy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our\r\ndaily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\r\ntrespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\r\nfrom evil; for thine is the kingdom and the power, and the glory,\r\nforever and ever.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nO eternal God, Creator and Preserver of all mankind, Giver of all\r\nspiritual grace, the Author of everlasting life, send thy blessing upon\r\nthese thy servants, this man and this woman, whom we bless in thy name;\r\nthat as Isaac and Rebecca lived faithfully together, so these persons\r\nmay surely perform and keep the vow and covenant between them made, and\r\nmay ever remain in perfect love and peace together and live according to\r\nthy laws, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister join their right hands together, and say:+\r\n\r\nThose whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.\r\n\r\nForasmuch as M. and N. have consented together in holy wedlock, and have\r\nwitnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have pledged\r\ntheir faith either to other, and have declared the same by joining\r\nhands, I pronounce that they are man and wife together, in the name of\r\nthe Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+And the minister shall add this blessing:+\r\n\r\nGod the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and\r\nkeep you; the Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you; and so fill\r\nyou with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye may so live\r\ntogether in this life, that in the world to come ye may have life\r\neverlasting.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LIV.\r\n THE ORDER OF THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n+The minister meeting the corpse, and going before it, shall say:+\r\n\r\nI am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he\r\nwere dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in me,\r\nshall never die.—John xi. 25, 26.\r\n\r\nI know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter\r\nday upon the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body,\r\nyet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine\r\neyes shall behold, and not another.—Job. xix. 25-27.\r\n\r\nWe brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry\r\nnothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the\r\nname of the Lord.—1 Tim. vi. 7; Job. i. 21.\r\n\r\n+After they are come into the church or home shall be read Psalm xc.+\r\n\r\nLord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.\r\n\r\nBefore the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the\r\nearth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.\r\n\r\nThou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.\r\n\r\nFor a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past,\r\nand as a watch in the night.\r\n\r\nThou carriest them away as with a flood: they are as a sleep; in the\r\nmorning they are like grass which groweth up.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut\r\ndown, and withereth.\r\n\r\nFor we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.\r\n\r\nThou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light\r\nof thy countenance.\r\n\r\nFor all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a\r\ntale that is told.\r\n\r\nThe days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of\r\nstrength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and\r\nsorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.\r\n\r\nWho knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is\r\nthy wrath.\r\n\r\nSo teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nReturn, O Lord, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nO satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all\r\nour days.\r\n\r\nMake us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and\r\nthe years wherein we have seen evil.\r\n\r\nLet thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAnd let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish thou\r\nthe work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou\r\nit.\r\n\r\n+Then shall follow the Lesson, 1 Cor. xv. 20-58, or the following\r\nabridgement:+\r\n\r\nNow is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them\r\nthat slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the\r\nresurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ\r\nshall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the\r\nfirst-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then\r\ncometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even\r\nthe Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority, and\r\npower. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.\r\nThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all\r\nthings under his feet—But some man will say, How are the dead raised up?\r\nand with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is\r\nnot quickened except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not\r\nthat body that shall be, but bare grain; it may chance of wheat, or of\r\nsome other grain; but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and\r\nto every seed his own body. All flesh is not the same flesh; but there\r\nis one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes,\r\nand another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies\r\nterrestrial; but the glory of the terrestrial is one and the glory of\r\nthe celestial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another\r\nglory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star\r\ndiffereth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the\r\ndead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown\r\nin dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised\r\nin power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual\r\nbody.—Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall\r\nall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last\r\ntrump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised\r\nincorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on\r\nincorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this\r\ncorruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have\r\nput on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is\r\nwritten, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting?\r\nO grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the\r\nstrength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the\r\nvictory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren,\r\nbe ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,\r\nforasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\r\n\r\n+Here may follow a suitable hymn, a sermon or exhortation, and an\r\nextemporary prayer.+\r\n\r\n+At the grave, when the corpse is laid in the earth, the minister shall\r\nsay:+\r\n\r\nMan that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He\r\ncometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow,\r\nand continueth not.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for succor,\r\nbut of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased?\r\n\r\nYet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful\r\nSaviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.\r\n\r\nThou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts: shut not thy merciful\r\nears to our prayers, but spare us, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou\r\nmost worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not at our last hour for any pains\r\nof death to fall from thee.\r\n\r\n+Then the minister may say:+\r\n\r\nForasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God, in his wise providence, to\r\ntake out of this world the soul of our deceased =brother=, we therefore\r\ncommit =his= body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to\r\ndust; looking for the general resurrection in the last day, and the life\r\nof the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ; at whose second\r\ncoming in glorious majesty to judge the world, the earth and the sea\r\nshall give up their dead; and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep\r\nin him shall be changed, and made like unto his own glorious body,\r\naccording to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things\r\nunto himself.\r\n\r\n+Then shall be said:+\r\n\r\nI heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead\r\nwhich die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they\r\nmay rest from their labors.\r\n\r\n+A suitable hymn may here be sung; and then shall the minister say:+\r\n\r\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;\r\nthy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our\r\ndaily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\r\ntrespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\r\nfrom evil.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLECT.\r\n\r\nO merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the\r\nresurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live,\r\nthough he die; and whosoever liveth and believeth in him, shall not die\r\neternally: we meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death\r\nof sin unto the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this\r\nlife we may rest in him and at the general resurrection on the last day\r\nmay be found acceptable in thy sight, and receive that blessing which\r\nthy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear\r\nthee, saying, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom\r\nprepared for you from the foundation of the world. Grant this, we\r\nbeseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ our Mediator and\r\nRedeemer.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the\r\ncommunion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LV.\r\n FORM OF LAYING THE CORNER STONE OF A CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n+At the time and place of laying the corner stone, let the minister\r\ncause a suitable hymn to be sung (e. g. 780, 781, or 782). Then shall\r\nthe minister say:+\r\n\r\n+Let us pray.+\r\n\r\nAlmighty and everlasting God, thou art infinite in all thy perfections,\r\nand marvelous in all thy works. Thou hast made the world and all things\r\ntherein; and seeing that thou art Lord of heaven and earth, thou\r\ndwellest not in temples made with hands; thou art a Spirit, and art\r\nworshiped in spirit and in truth, in all places of thy dominion; yet we\r\nthank thee that thou dost allow us to build houses for thy services,\r\nwherein thy people may attend upon thee without distraction. We bless\r\nthy holy name for putting it into the hearts of thy people to build a\r\nhouse, at this place, for thy worship. We beseech thee to inspire us\r\nwith zeal, that we may both have a mind to the work, and may\r\nsuccessfully accomplish the same. May neither adversary nor evil\r\noccurent hinder this work; but may the good hand of our God be upon us,\r\nthat in due time we may bring forth the headstone with joy and praise.\r\nMay this sanctuary, when completed, long remain a house of prayer for\r\nall people, where incense shall be offered unto thy name, and a pure\r\noffering, and thy word and ordinances by the influences of the Holy\r\nGhost. Here may multitudes be born again, and be nurtured in knowledge\r\nand piety; so that they may be prepared, in the kingdom of thy glory. We\r\nare unworthy, O Lord, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any\r\nsacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and\r\nservice, not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offenses, through\r\nJesus Christ our Lord: by whom and with whom, in the unity of the Holy\r\nGhost all honor and glory be unto thee, Father Almighty, world without\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nPrevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious favor, and\r\nfurther us with thy continual help; that in all our works, begun,\r\ncontinued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally,\r\nby thy mercy, obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come;\r\nthy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our\r\ndaily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\r\ntrespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\r\nfrom evil.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then, shall the minister read, or cause to be read, the following\r\nsentences:+\r\n\r\nBlessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our Father, forever and ever.\r\n\r\nThine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the\r\nvictory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heaven and in the earth\r\nis thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head\r\nabove all.\r\n\r\nBoth riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in\r\nthine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great,\r\nand to give strength unto all.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.\r\n\r\nBut who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so\r\nwillingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own\r\nhave we given thee.\r\n\r\nFor we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our\r\nfathers; our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none\r\nabiding.\r\n\r\nO Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a\r\nhouse for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.\r\n\r\nI know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and has pleasure in\r\nuprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have\r\nwillingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy thy\r\npeople, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.\r\n\r\nExcept the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it;\r\nexcept the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.\r\n\r\nLet thy work appear unto thy servants, and the glory unto their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAnd let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish thou\r\nthe work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHis foundation is in the holy mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\r\nFor the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.\r\n\r\nThis is my rest forever: here will I dwell: for I have desired it.\r\n\r\nI will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nI will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall\r\nshout aloud for joy.\r\n\r\nThe stone which the builders refused is become the head-stone of the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nThis is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.\r\n\r\nFor other foundation can no man lay than is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister, standing by the stone, announce the articles\r\nto be deposited therein. These may be a copy of the Bible, the Hymn\r\nBook, the Discipline, Church periodicals, a document setting forth the\r\nname of the Church, with the names of the pastor, trustees, and building\r\ncommittee, and such other articles as may be desired. The stone shall be\r\nlaid by the minister, or some one appointed by him; and placing his hand\r\nupon the stone, the minister shall say:+\r\n\r\nWe lay this corner stone of a house to be built and set apart, from all\r\nworldly uses, for divine worship, in the name of the Father, and of the\r\nSon, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then may follow an address, the collection (if any) the Doxology, and\r\nBenediction.+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LVI.\r\n FORM OF THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n+Let the service be conducted as on the other occasions of public\r\nworship—only the hymns (e. g. 783-780,) prayer, lesson, and sermons,\r\nshould be adapted to the occasion. The lessons may be Gen. xxviii.\r\n10-22, and Heb. x. 19-25, or any other at the discretion of the\r\nminister.+\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LESSON. GEN. xxviii. 10-22.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted\r\nupon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was\r\nset; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his\r\npillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and\r\nbehold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to\r\nheaven; and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\r\nAnd behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of\r\nAbraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest,\r\nto thee will I give it, and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be as the\r\ndust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the\r\neast, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed\r\nshall all the families of the earth be blessed. And behold, I am with\r\nthee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will\r\nbring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have\r\ndone that which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob, awaked out of his\r\nsleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.\r\nAnd he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none\r\nother but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob\r\nrose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his\r\npillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.\r\nAnd he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city\r\nwas called Luz at the first. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will\r\nbe with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me\r\nbread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's\r\nhouse in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I\r\nhave set for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou shalt\r\ngive me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LESSON. HEB. x. 19-25.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the\r\nblood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for\r\nus, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh; having an high-priest\r\nover the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart, in full\r\nassurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,\r\nand our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the\r\nprofession of our faith without wavering: for he is faithful that\r\npromised: and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love, and to\r\ngood works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the\r\nmanner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as\r\nye see the day approaching.\r\n\r\n+The Collection (if any) may follow the sermon. The officers of the\r\nChurch shall then address the minister in the following language:+\r\n\r\nWe present to you this house, to be set apart from all unhallowed or\r\ncommon uses, for the worship of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the minister request the congregation to stand, while he\r\npronounces the following Sentence of Dedication:+\r\n\r\n\r\nSENTENCE OF DEDICATION\r\n\r\nForasmuch as God has put it into the hearts of his people to build this\r\nhouse for his worship, and has blessed them in their undertaking, we\r\nsolemnly dedicate it to his service, for the reading and expounding of\r\nhis holy word, the administration of his ordinances, and for all other\r\nacts of religious worship. That he may graciously accept this labor of\r\nour hands, let us devoutly pray.\r\n\r\n+Then shall be said, all kneeling:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty and everlasting God, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens,\r\ncannot contain thee, much less this house which we have built; yet thou\r\ndost humble thyself to behold the inhabitants of the earth, and dost\r\npromise that in all places where thou dost record thy name thou wilt\r\nmeet with thy people, and bless them. Let thy name be recorded in this\r\nplace, and here let thine honor dwell. Preserve this house, which we set\r\napart to thy service, from injury and desecration. Accept the worship\r\nwhich shall be here offered to thy name. Let thy Holy Spirit accompany\r\nthy word and ordinances, which shall be here administered, so that they\r\nmay prove means of grace to all who shall receive the same. May many\r\nsons and daughters be here born to the Lord Almighty. Let thy people be\r\nabundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and make them drink\r\nof the river of thy pleasures. Let their children be here fed with food\r\nconvenient for them, and be brought up in the nurture and admonition of\r\nthe Lord. Let living waters go forth from this sanctuary, carrying life\r\nand joy to all around. Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy\r\nglory unto their children, and let the beauty of the Lord our God be\r\nupon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea the work\r\nof our hands establish thou it. Now, therefore arise, O Lord God, into\r\nthy resting place, thou and the ark of thy strength; let thy ministers\r\nbe clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. We\r\nbeseech thee, O Lord, to overlook our unworthiness, forgive our sins,\r\nand make us a habitation of God through the Spirit. We offer all our\r\nofferings through the ever-blessed name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist, to whom, with thee, and the Holy Spirit, be glory and majesty,\r\ndominion and power, both now and ever.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+The service may then be concluded with the Doxology and Benediction.+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LI.\r\n THE FORM AND MANNER OF ORDAINING  DEACONS\r\n\r\n\r\n+When the day appointed by the Bishop is come, after a suitable sermon\r\nor exhortation, one of the Elders shall present unto the Bishop all them\r\nthat are to be ordained, and say:+\r\n\r\nI present unto you these persons present, to be ordained Deacons.\r\n\r\n+Then their names being read aloud, the Bishop shall say unto the\r\npeople:+\r\n\r\nBrethren, if there be any of you who knoweth any impediment or crime in\r\nany of these persons presented to be ordained Deacons; for the which he\r\nought not to be admitted to that office, let him come forth in the name\r\nof God and show what the crime or impediment is.\r\n\r\n+If any crime or impediment be objected, the Bishop shall surcease from\r\nordaining that person unto such time as the party accused shall be found\r\nclear of that crime. Then shall be read the following collect.+\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLECT.\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, who by thy divine providence hast appointed divers orders\r\nof ministers in thy Church, and didst inspire thy apostles to choose\r\ninto the order of Deacons thy first martyr, St. Stephen, with others:\r\nmercifully behold these thy servants, now called to the like office and\r\nadministration; replenish them so with the truth of thy doctrine, and\r\nadorn them with innocency of life, that both by word and good example\r\nthey may faithfully serve thee in this office, to the glory of thy name,\r\nand the edification of thy Church, through the merits of our Saviour\r\nJesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, now\r\nand forever.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop or one of the Elders appointed by him, shall read the\r\nEpistle.+\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EPISTLE.   1 TIM. iii. 8-13.\r\n\r\nLikewise must the Deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to\r\nmuch wine, not greedy of filthy lucre: holding the mystery of the faith\r\nin a pure conscience. And let these also first be proved; then let them\r\nuse the office of a Deacon, being found blameless. Even so must their\r\nwives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. Let the\r\nDeacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own\r\nhouses well. For they that have used the office of a Deacon well,\r\npurchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith\r\nwhich is in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Bishop examine every one of those who are to be\r\nordained, in the press of the people, after this manner following:+\r\n\r\nDo you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon\r\nyou the office of the ministry in the Church of Christ, to serve God for\r\nthe promoting of his glory and the edifying of his people?\r\n\r\nAns. I trust so.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Do you unfeignedly believe all the canonical Scriptures of\r\nthe Old and New Testament.\r\n\r\nAns. I do believe them.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you diligently read or expound the same unto the people\r\nwhom you shall be appointed to serve?\r\n\r\nAns. I will.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. It appertaineth to the office of a Deacon to assist the\r\nElder in Divine service, and especially when he ministereth the holy\r\ncommunion, to help him in the distribution thereof, and to read and\r\nexpound the Holy Scriptures: to instruct the youth; and in the absence\r\nof the Elder to baptize.\r\n\r\nAnd, furthermore, it is his office to search for the sick, poor, and\r\nimpotent, that they may be visited and relieved.\r\n\r\nWill you do this gladly and willingly?\r\n\r\nAns. I will do so, by the help of God.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you apply all your diligence to frame and fashion your\r\nown lives (and the lives of your families) according to the doctrine of\r\nChrist; and to make both yourselves, and them, as much as in you lieth,\r\nwholesome examples of the flock of Christ?\r\n\r\nAns. I will do so, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you reverently obey them to whom the charge and\r\ngovernment over you is committed, following with a glad mind and will\r\ntheir godly admonitions?\r\n\r\nAns. I will endeavor so to do, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop, laying his hands severally upon the head of every one\r\nof them, shall say:+\r\n\r\nTake thou authority to execute the office of a Deacon in the Church of\r\nGod; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Bishop deliver to every one of them the Holy Bible,\r\nsaying:+\r\n\r\nTake thou authority to read the Holy Scriptures in the Church of God,\r\nand to preach the same.\r\n\r\n+Then one of them appointed by the Bishop shall read the Gospel.+\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOSPEL. LUKE xii. 35-38.\r\n\r\nLet your loins be girded about, and your lights burning, and ye\r\nyourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord, when he will return\r\nfrom the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto\r\nhim immediately. Blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh\r\nshall find watching. Verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself\r\nand make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\r\nAnd if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch,\r\nand find them so, blessed are those servants.\r\n\r\n+Immediately before the benediction shall be said these Collects\r\nfollowing:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, giver of all good things, who of thy great goodness hast\r\nvouchsafed to accept and take these thy servants into the office of\r\nDeacons in thy Church: make them, we beseech thee, O Lord, to be modest,\r\nhumble, and constant in their ministration, and to have a ready will to\r\nobserve all spiritual discipline; that they having always the testimony\r\nof a good conscience, and continuing ever stable and strong in thy Son\r\nChrist, may so well behave themselves in this inferior office, that they\r\nmay be found worthy to be called unto the higher ministries in thy\r\nChurch, through the same thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; to whom be\r\nglory and honor, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nPrevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious favor, and\r\nfurther us with thy continual help; that in all our works, begun,\r\ncontinued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally,\r\nby thy mercy, obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Benediction\r\n\r\nThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and\r\nminds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, our\r\nLord; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the\r\nHoly Ghost, be among you, and remain with you always.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LVIII.\r\n THE FORM AND MANNER OF ORDAINING ELDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n+When the day appointed by the Bishop is come there shall be a sermon or\r\nexhortation, declaring the duty and office of such as come to be\r\nadmitted Elders; how necessary that order is in the Church of Christ,\r\nand also how the people ought to esteem them in their office. After\r\nwhich one of the Elders shall present unto the Bishop all them that are\r\nto be ordained, and say:+\r\n\r\nI present unto you these persons present, to be ordained Elders.\r\n\r\n+Then their names being read aloud, the Bishop shall say unto the\r\npeople:+\r\n\r\nBrethren, these are they whom we purpose, God willing, this day to\r\nordain Elders. For after due examination, we find not to the contrary,\r\nbut that they are lawfully called to this function and ministry, and\r\nthat they are persons meet for the same. But if there be any of you who\r\nknow any impediment or crime in any of them, for the which he ought not\r\nto be received into this holy ministry, let him come forth in the name\r\nof God, and show what the crime or impediment is.\r\n\r\n+If any crime or impediment be objected, the Bishop shall surcease from\r\nordaining that person, until such time as the party accused shall be\r\nfound clear of that crime.+\r\n\r\n+Then shall be said the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel as followeth:+\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLECT.\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit hast\r\nappointed divers orders of ministers in thy Church, mercifully behold\r\nthese thy servants, now called to the office of Elder, and replenish\r\nthem so with the truth of thy doctrine, and adorn them with innocency of\r\nlife, that, both by word and good example, they may faithfully serve\r\nthee in this office, to the glory of thy name, and the edification of\r\nthy Church, through the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth\r\nand reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EPISTLE. EPH. iv. 7-13.\r\n\r\nUnto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift\r\nof Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led\r\ncaptivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he ascended, what\r\nis it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the\r\nearth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all\r\nheavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave some, apostles; and\r\nsome prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;\r\nfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the\r\nedifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the\r\nfaith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto\r\nthe measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOSPEL. ST. JOHN x. 1-16.\r\n\r\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into\r\nthe sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a\r\nrobber. But he that entereth in by the door, is the shepherd of the\r\nsheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice; and he\r\ncalleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth\r\nforth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for\r\nthey know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee\r\nfrom him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake\r\nJesus unto them, but they understood not what things they were which he\r\nspake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say\r\nunto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are\r\nthieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by\r\nme if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and\r\nfind pasture. The thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to\r\ndestroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have\r\nit more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his\r\nlife for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd,\r\nwhose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the\r\nsheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.\r\nThe hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the\r\nsheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.\r\nAs the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my\r\nlife for the sheep. And other sheep I have which are not of this fold:\r\nthem also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be\r\none fold, and one shepherd.\r\n\r\n+And that done, the Bishop shall say unto them as hereafter followeth:+\r\n\r\nYou have heard, brethren, as well in your private examination, (as in\r\nthe exhortation which was now made to you,) and in the holy lessons\r\ntaken out of the Gospel, and the writings of the apostles, of what\r\ndignity, and of how great importance, this office is, whereunto ye are\r\ncalled. And now again we exhort you, in the name of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, that you have in remembrance into how high a dignity, and to how\r\nweighty an office ye are called: that is to say, to be messengers,\r\nwatchmen, and stewards of the Lord; to teach, and to premonish, to feed\r\nand provide for the Lord's family; to seek for Christ's sheep that are\r\ndispersed abroad, and for his children who are in the midst of this evil\r\nworld, that they may be saved through Christ forever.\r\n\r\nWe have good hope that you have all weighed and pondered these things\r\nwith yourselves long before this time; and that you have clearly\r\ndetermined, by God's grace, to give yourselves wholly to this office,\r\nwhereunto it hath pleased God to call you: so that, as much as lieth in\r\nyou, you will apply yourselves wholly to this one thing, and draw all\r\nyour cares and studies this way, and that you will continually pray to\r\nGod the Father, through the mediation of our only Saviour Jesus Christ,\r\nfor the heavenly assistance of the Holy Ghost: that by daily reading and\r\nweighing of the Scriptures, ye may wax riper and stronger in your\r\nministry; and that ye may so endeavor yourselves from time to time to\r\nsanctify the lives of you and yours, and to fashion them after the rule\r\nand doctrine of Christ, that ye may be wholesome and godly examples and\r\npatterns for the people to follow.\r\n\r\nAnd now that this present congregation of Christ, here assembled, may\r\nalso understand your minds and wills in these things, and that this your\r\npromise may the more move you to do your duties, ye shall answer plainly\r\nto these things, which we, in the name of God and of his Church, shall\r\ndemand of you touching the same.\r\n\r\nDo you think in your heart that you are truly called, according to the\r\nwill of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the order of Elders?\r\n\r\nAns. I think so.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Are you persuaded that the Holy Scriptures contain\r\nsufficiently all doctrine required of necessity for eternal salvation\r\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined, out of the said\r\nScriptures, to instruct the people committed to your charge, and to\r\nteach nothing, as required of necessity to eternal salvation, but that\r\nwhich you shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved by the\r\nScriptures?\r\n\r\nAns. I am so persuaded, and have so determined, by God's grace.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you then give your faithful diligence, always so to\r\nminister the doctrine and sacraments, and the discipline of Christ, as\r\nthe Lord hath commanded?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so do, by the help of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you be ready with all faithful diligence to banish and\r\ndrive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's word;\r\nand to use both public and private monitions and exhortations, as well\r\nto the sick as to the whole within your charge, as need shall require,\r\nand occasion shall be given?\r\n\r\nAns. I will, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you be diligent in prayers, and in reading of the Holy\r\nScriptures, and in such studies as help to the knowledge of the same,\r\nlaying aside the study of the world and the flesh?\r\n\r\nAns. I will endeavor so to do, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you be diligent to frame and fashion yourselves, and\r\nyour families, according to the doctrine of Christ; and to make both\r\nyourselves and them, as much as in you lieth, wholesome examples and\r\npatterns to the flock of Christ?\r\n\r\nAns. I shall apply myself thereto, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you maintain and set forward, as much as lieth in you,\r\nquietness, peace, and love, among all Christian people, and especially\r\namong them that are or shall be committed to your charge?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you reverently obey your chief ministers, unto whom is\r\ncommitted the charge and government over you; following with a glad mind\r\nand will their godly admonitions, submitting yourselves to their godly\r\njudgment?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Bishop, standing up, say:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, who hath given you this will to do all these things, grant\r\nalso unto you strength and power to perform the same; that he may\r\naccomplish his work which he hath begun in you, through Jesus Christ our\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+After this the congregation shall be desired secretly in their prayers\r\nto make their humble supplications to God, for all these things: for\r\nwhich prayers there shall be silence kept for a space.+\r\n\r\n+After which shall be said by the Bishop, (the persons to be ordained\r\nElders all kneeling,) Veni, Creator, Spiritus: the Bishop beginning, and\r\nthe Elders and others that are present answering by verses, as\r\nfolloweth:+\r\n\r\n Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire.\r\n =And lighten with celestial fire.=\r\n Thou the anointing Spirit art,\r\n =Who dost thy seven-fold gifts impart.=\r\n Thy blessed unction from above\r\n =Is comfort, life, and fire of love=.\r\n Enable with perpetual light\r\n =The dullness of our blinded sight=.\r\n Anoint and cheer our soiled face\r\n =With the abundance of thy grace=\r\n Keep for our foes, give peace at home\r\n =Where thou art guide no ill can come=\r\n Teach us to know the Father, Son.\r\n =And thee of both, to be but one=\r\n That through the ages all along,\r\n =This may be our endless song=;\r\n Praise to thy eternal merit,\r\n =Father, Son and Holy Spirit=.\r\n\r\n+That done, the Bishop shall pray in this wise, and say, Let us pray+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God and Heavenly Father, who, of thine infinite love and\r\ngoodness toward us, hast given to us thy only and most dearly beloved\r\nSon Jesus Christ to be our Redeemer, and the author of everlasting life;\r\nwho, after he had made perfect our redemption by his death, and was\r\nascended into heaven, sent abroad into the world his apostles, prophets,\r\nevangelists, doctors and pastors; by whose labor and ministry he\r\ngathered together a great flock in all parts of the world, to set forth\r\nthe eternal praise of thy holy name; for these so great benefits of thy\r\neternal goodness, and for that thou hast vouchsafed to call these thy\r\nservants here present to the same office and ministry appointed for the\r\nsalvation of mankind, we render unto thee most hearty thanks: we praise\r\nand worship thee; and we humbly beseech thee, by the same thy blessed\r\nSon, to grant unto all who either here or elsewhere call upon thy holy\r\nname, that we may continue to show ourselves thankful unto thee for\r\nthese, and all other, thy benefits; and that we may daily increase and\r\ngo forward in the knowledge and faith of thee and thy Son, by the Holy\r\nSpirit: so that as well by these thy ministers, as by them over whom\r\nthey shall be appointed thy ministers, thy holy name may be forever\r\nglorified, and thy blessed kingdom enlarged, through the same thy Son\r\nJesus Christ our Lord: who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity\r\nof the same Holy Spirit, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+When the prayer is done, the Bishop and the Elders present shall lay\r\ntheir hands severally upon the head of every one that receiveth the\r\nOrder of Elders, the receivers humbly kneeling upon their knees, and the\r\nBishop saying,+\r\n\r\nThe Lord pour upon thee the Holy Ghost, for the office and work of an\r\nElder in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of\r\nour hands. And be thou a faithful dispenser of the word of God, and of\r\nhis holy sacraments: in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of\r\nthe Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop shall deliver to every one of them kneeling, the Bible,\r\ninto his hands, saying:+\r\n\r\nTake thou authority to preach the word of God, and to administer the\r\nholy sacraments in the congregation.\r\n\r\n+Then shall the Bishop say:+\r\n\r\nMost merciful Father, we beseech thee to send upon these thy servants\r\nthy heavenly blessing; that they may be clothed with righteousness, and\r\nthat thy word spoken by their mouths may have such success, that it may\r\nnever be spoken in vain. Grant also, that we may have grace to hear and\r\nreceive what they shall deliver out of thy most holy word, or agreeable\r\nto the same, as the means of our salvation; that in all our words and\r\ndeeds we may seek thy glory, and the increase of thy kingdom, through\r\nJesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nPrevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious favor, and\r\nfurther us with thy continual help; that in all our works, begun,\r\ncontinued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally,\r\nby thy mercy, obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BENEDICTION\r\n\r\nThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and\r\nminds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, our\r\nLord; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the\r\nHoly Ghost, be among you, and remain with you always.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+If on the same day the Order of Deacons be given to some, and that of\r\nElders to others, the Deacons shall be first presented, and then the\r\nElders.

ACTS xx. 17-35.\r\n\r\nFrom Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, and called the Elders of the Church.\r\nAnd when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know from the\r\nfirst day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you\r\nat all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with\r\nmany tears and temptations, which befell me by the laying in wait of the\r\nJews: and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have\r\nshowed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,\r\ntestifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward\r\nGod, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, behold, I go bound\r\nin the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall\r\nme there: save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city saying, that\r\nbonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me,\r\nneither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my\r\ncourse with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord\r\nJesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I\r\nknow that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God,\r\nshall see my face no more. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that\r\nI am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare\r\nunto you all the counsel of God. Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves,\r\nand to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you\r\noverseers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his\r\nown blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous\r\nwolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own\r\nselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples\r\nafter them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three\r\nyears I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now,\r\nbrethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is\r\nable to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them\r\nwhich are sanctified. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or\r\napparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto\r\nmy necessities, and to them that were with me. I have showed you all\r\nthings, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to\r\nremember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to\r\ngive than to receive.\r\n\r\n+Then another shall read+\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOSPEL. ST. JOHN xxi. 15-17.\r\n\r\nJesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than\r\nthese? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He\r\nsaith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again the second time,\r\nSimon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord: thou\r\nknowest that I love thee. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son\r\nof Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the\r\nthird time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all\r\nthings, thou knowest that I love thee, Jesus saith unto him, Feed my\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nOR THIS. ST. MATT, xxviii. 18-21\r\n\r\nJesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in\r\nheaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing\r\nthem in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\r\nteaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and\r\nlo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\r\n\r\n+After the Gospel and sermon are ended, the elected person shall be\r\npresented by two Elders unto the Bishop, saying:+\r\n\r\nWe present unto you this holy man, to be ordained a Bishop.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop shall move the congregation to pray, saying thus to\r\nthem:+\r\n\r\nBrethren, it is written in the Gospel of St. Luke, that our Saviour\r\nChrist continued the whole night in prayer, before he did choose and\r\nsend forth his twelve apostles. It is written also in the Acts of the\r\nApostles, that the disciples who were at Antioch did fast and pray,\r\nbefore they laid hands on Paul and Barnabas, and sent them forth. Let\r\nus, therefore, following the example of our Saviour Christ, and his\r\napostles, first fall to prayer, before we admit and send forth this\r\nperson presented unto us, to the work whereunto we trust the Holy Ghost\r\nhath called him.\r\n\r\n+Then shall be said this prayer following:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, giver of all good things, who by the Holy Spirit hast\r\nappointed divers orders of ministers in thy Church: mercifully behold\r\nthis thy servant, now called to the work and ministry of a Bishop; and\r\nreplenish him so with the truth of thy doctrine, and adorn him with\r\ninnocency of life, that, both by word and deed, he may faithfully serve\r\nthee in this office, to the glory of thy name, and the edifying and\r\nwell-governing of thy Church, through the merits of our Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, world\r\nwithout end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop shall say to him that is to be ordained:+\r\n\r\nBrother, forasmuch as the Holy Scripture commands that we should not be\r\nhasty in laying on hands, and admitting any person to government in the\r\nChurch of Christ, which he hath purchased with no less price than the\r\neffusion of his own blood: before I admit you to this administration, I\r\nwill examine you on certain articles, to the end that the congregation\r\npresent may have a trial, and bear witness, how you are minded to behave\r\nyourself in the Church of God.\r\n\r\nAre you persuaded that you are truly called to this ministration,\r\naccording to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ?\r\n\r\nAns. I am so persuaded.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Are you persuaded that the Holy Scriptures contain\r\nsufficiently all doctrine required of necessity for eternal salvation,\r\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined, out of the same\r\nHoly Scriptures, to instruct the people committed to your charge; and to\r\nteach or maintain nothing as required of necessity to eternal salvation,\r\nbut that which you shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved by the\r\nsame?\r\n\r\nAns. I am so persuaded, and determined, by God's grace.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you then faithfully exercise yourself in the same Holy\r\nScriptures, and call upon God by prayer for the true understanding of\r\nthe same, so as you may be able by them to teach and exhort with\r\nwholesome doctrine, and to withstand and convince the gainsayers?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so do, by the help of God.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Are you ready with faithful diligence to banish and drive\r\naway all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's word, and\r\nboth privately and openly to call upon and encourage others to the same?\r\n\r\nAns. I am ready, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live\r\nsoberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; that you may\r\nshow yourself in all things an example of good works unto others, that\r\nthe adversary may be ashamed, having nothing to say against you?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you maintain and set forward, as much as shall lie in\r\nyou, quietness, love, and peace among all men: and such as shall be\r\nunquiet, disobedient, and criminal, within your district, correct and\r\npunish according to such authority as you have by God's word, and as\r\nshall be committed unto you?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so do, by the help of God.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you be faithful in ordaining, sending, or laying hands\r\nupon others?\r\n\r\nAns. I will so be, by the help of God.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop. Will you show yourself gentle, and be merciful, for Christ's\r\nsake, to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?\r\n\r\nAns I will so show myself, by God's help.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop shall say:+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, our Heavenly Father, who hath given you a good will to do\r\nall these things, grant also unto you strength and power to perform the\r\nsame; that, he accomplishing in you the good work which he hath begun,\r\nyou may be found perfect and irreprehensible at the last day, through\r\nJesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then shall Veni, Creator, Spiritus be said:+\r\n\r\n Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire.\r\n =And lighten with celestial fire.=\r\n Thou the anointing Spirit art,\r\n =Who dost thy seven-fold gifts impart.=\r\n Thy blessed unction from above\r\n =Is comfort, life and fire of love,=\r\n Enable with perpetual light\r\n =The dullness of our blinded sight.=\r\n Anoint and cheer our soiled face\r\n =With the abundance of thy grace.=\r\n Keep far our foes, give peace at home\r\n =Where thou art guide no ill can come.=\r\n Teach us to know the Father, Son,\r\n =And thee of both, to be but one=\r\n That through the ages all along,\r\n =This may be our endless song;=\r\n Praise to thy eternal merit,\r\n =Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.=\r\n\r\n+That ended, the Bishop shall say+\r\n\r\nLord, hear our prayer.\r\n\r\nAns. =And let our cry come unto thee.=\r\n\r\n+Bishop, let us pray.+\r\n\r\nAlmighty God and most merciful Father, who of thine infinite goodness\r\nhast given thine only and dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ to be our\r\nRedeemer, and the author of everlasting life; who, after that he had\r\nmade perfect our redemption by his death, and was ascended into heaven,\r\npoured down his gifts abundantly upon men, making some apostles, some\r\nprophets, some evangelists, some pastors and doctors to the edifying and\r\nmaking perfect his Church: grant, we beseech thee, to this thy servant,\r\nsuch grace that he may evermore be ready to spread abroad thy gospel,\r\nthe glad tidings of reconciliation with thee, and use the authority\r\ngiven him, not to destruction, but to salvation; not to hurt but to\r\nhelp; so that as a wise and faithful servant, giving to thy family their\r\nportion in due season, he may at last be received into everlasting joy,\r\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord, who, with thee and the Holy Ghost, liveth\r\nand reigneth, one God, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop and Elders present shall lay their hands upon the head\r\nof the elected person, kneeling before them upon his knees, the Bishop\r\nsaying:+\r\n\r\nThe Lord pour upon thee the Holy Ghost, for the office and work of a\r\nBishop in the Church of God now committed unto thee by the imposition of\r\nour hands; in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy\r\nGhost.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nAnd remember that thou stir up the grace of God which is given thee; for\r\nGod hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and\r\nsoberness.\r\n\r\n+Then the Bishop shall deliver him the Bible, saying:+\r\n\r\nGive heed unto reading, exhortation, and doctrine. Think upon the things\r\ncontained in this book. Be diligent in them, that the increase coming\r\nthereby may be manifest unto all men. Take heed unto thyself, and to thy\r\ndoctrine; for by so doing thou shalt both save thyself and them that\r\nhear thee. Be to the flock of Christ a shepherd, not a wolf; feed them,\r\ndevour them not. Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken,\r\nbring again the outcasts, seek the lost. Be so merciful, that you may\r\nnot be too remiss; so minister discipline, that you forget not mercy;\r\nthat when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you may receive the\r\nnever-fading crown of glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n+Immediately before the benediction shall be said the following prayer:+\r\n\r\nMost merciful Father, we beseech thee to send down upon this thy servant\r\nthy heavenly blessing; and so endue him with thy Holy Spirit, that he,\r\npreaching thy word, may not only be earnest to reprove, beseech, and\r\nrebuke with all patience and doctrine, but may also be to such as\r\nbelieve a wholesome example, in word, in conversation, in love, in\r\nfaith, in chastity, and in purity; that, faithfully fulfilling his\r\ncourse, at the latter day he may receive the crown of righteousness laid\r\nup by the Lord, the righteous Judge, who liveth and reigneth, one God\r\nwith the Father and the Holy Ghost, world without end.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nPrevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy most gracious favor, and\r\nfurther us with thy continual help; that in all our works, begun,\r\ncontinued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally,\r\nby thy mercy, obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BENEDICTION.\r\n\r\nThe peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and\r\nminds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our\r\nLord; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the\r\nHoly Ghost, be among you, and remain with you always.\r\n\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=APPENDIX.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.\r\n BISHOPS AND GENERAL OFFICERS\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOPS\r\n\r\nBishop L.
