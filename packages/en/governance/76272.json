J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy many persons in the United States, Central America is conceived of\r\nchiefly as a land of revolutions, bankrupt governments, and absconding\r\npresidents, and a haven for fugitives from justice from more settled\r\ncountries. The progress of the people of the Isthmus since their\r\ndeclaration of independence, and the significance of this progress\r\nin view of the difficulties with which they have had to contend, are\r\nrarely recognized. The fact is too frequently overlooked that the\r\ngreater part of the people of the five republics, except in Costa\r\nRica, are descendants of the semi-civilized aboriginal tribes whom the\r\n_Conquistadores_ enslaved in the sixteenth century, and that these\r\nIndians still remain, for the most part, in a condition of dense\r\nignorance and economic dependence. Even the white upper classes were\r\nprevented for three centuries from making any advance in civilization\r\nby the restriction of intercourse with other countries and the\r\ncentralization of authority in the hands of foreign officials under\r\nthe Spanish colonial system; and they were unable to set up a stable\r\npolitical system when they obtained their independence, because of\r\ntheir lack of experience in self-government, and because of the absence\r\nof political institutions upon which a stable system of government\r\ncould be based.\r\n\r\nWhen we take these facts into consideration, and when we see the\r\nadvances which some of the Central American Republics have been able\r\nto make despite these handicaps, we shall be less ready to conclude\r\nthat their people are inherently unfit for self-government. Our own\r\nrace is removed from the disorderly conditions which characterize the\r\nmore turbulent parts of the Isthmus only by a few hundred years, and\r\nin the United States we are not unfamiliar today with evils similar to\r\nsome of the worst evils of Central American political life. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that all of the five republics will not eventually\r\ndevelop stable governments, as some of them have already done. Although\r\nconditions in many parts of the Isthmus are still very bad, they are\r\ngradually being overcome by the efforts of the better elements among\r\nthe ruling classes and by the gradual progress of the common people.\r\nSince the Washington Conference of 1907, moreover, the preservation of\r\ninternal and international peace in the Isthmus has been powerfully\r\naided by the influence of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat the economic and political conditions of Central America and the\r\nother countries of the Caribbean should be understood by the American\r\ngovernment and the American people is of the utmost importance. The\r\npolicy of the United States, more perhaps than any other factor either\r\nexternal or internal, will determine the course of the development of\r\nthe five republics during the next few decades, and if this policy is\r\nto be beneficial, it must be based on knowledge and must be controlled\r\nby an intelligent public opinion. Only injustice can result from the\r\npublication of works like many of the recent superficial descriptions\r\nof Central America, whether they portray the five countries as foci\r\nof continual disorder, constitutionally incapable of self-government,\r\nand hence destined to absorption by a stronger power, or paint a\r\nridiculously laudatory picture, based on official reports and on the\r\nutterances of the authorities rather than on critical observation. It\r\nis the purpose of this study to describe conditions simply as they\r\nappeared to the author during a sojourn of two years in the Isthmus,\r\nwith the object of setting forth what the people of Central America\r\nhave achieved since their declaration of independence and what problems\r\nconfront them in their present stage of development.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of a careful study of the history and\r\nthe economic and political conditions of the five republics are very\r\ngreat, because there is so little trustworthy written material.\r\nHistorical works are especially unsatisfactory. The colonial period\r\nis ably treated in two or three books by Central American authors,\r\nbut the development of the community since its separation from Spain,\r\nand the far-reaching economic and political changes which have taken\r\nplace during the last century, have apparently never been studied by\r\nanyone who was equipped by historical training and by a knowledge of\r\nthe country to interpret them. In attempting to obtain material for\r\nsketching the historical development of the Isthmus, therefore, I have\r\nbeen forced to rely on the very inadequate histories which do exist,\r\nwhich are little more than lists of presidents and revolutions, and\r\nupon a large number of political pamphlets, government documents, and\r\nmemoirs of Central American leaders and of early travelers in the\r\nIsthmus. Much of this material is all but worthless because of the\r\nignorance or the ulterior motives of the writers, but there is enough\r\nof value to reveal certain broad tendencies of economic and political\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIt is equally difficult to secure data concerning the condition of the\r\ncountry at present. Official publications can rarely be accepted as\r\nreliable because of the carelessness with which records are kept and\r\nstatistical data are gathered by most of the departments, and because\r\nofficial statements about the material progress of the country and the\r\nactivities of the authorities too often represent patriotic aspirations\r\nrather than accomplished facts. The differences in the use of terms\r\nand in standards of public service, moreover, are so great that it is\r\ndifficult for a foreigner to obtain an idea of the actual situation in\r\none of the countries merely by conversation with the authorities and\r\nother persons in the capital. The writer found it extremely helpful\r\nto supplement such conversations with trips to the provincial towns\r\nand through the rural districts. An acquaintance with the life and\r\nthe character of the people outside the somewhat Europeanized cities,\r\nand an observation of the actual working of the political machinery,\r\ndid much to make clear many things which otherwise might have been\r\ndifficult to understand.\r\n\r\nThe courtesy of the officials of the five governments, and the\r\nhospitality extended to the traveler by all classes of the people,\r\nmake a journey through Central America an experience upon which one\r\ncan always look back with keen pleasure. It would be impossible here\r\nto thank individually the many friends who helped to make my stay in\r\nthe Isthmus both pleasant and profitable. Nevertheless, I wish to\r\nexpress especially my appreciation of the assistance which I have\r\nreceived from Dr. L. S. Rowe, Mr. John M.

Although their combined area is smaller\r\nthan that of the state of California,[1] they comprise many regions\r\nof strikingly different climatic conditions, for the mountains which\r\noccupy the greater part of their territory cause variations in the\r\ndistribution of rainfall, and also provide plateaus and high valleys\r\nwhere the tropical heat is less intense because of the altitude. Along\r\nthe shore of the Caribbean Sea there is a broad strip of country\r\nbut little above sea level. This has remained almost uninhabited\r\nuntil recently because of its intense humidity and suffocating\r\ntemperature, but within the last twenty-five years it has become of\r\ngreat economic importance, at least to the outside world, through its\r\nexports of bananas. The lowlands extend inland to the Central American\r\n_Cordillera_, a series of ranges which grow higher and higher as they\r\napproach the Pacific Ocean, until they culminate in a great chain of\r\nvolcanic peaks which traverses the Isthmus from the Mexican boundary\r\nto that of Panama. It is near these peaks, where the decomposed lava\r\nfrom past eruptions has created a marvelously fertile soil, and where\r\nthe climate, with copious but not excessive rains during six months of\r\nthe year, is healthful and favorable to agriculture, that the great\r\nmajority of the people of Central America live. Almost all of the\r\nmore important cities and towns are situated either in the mountain\r\nvalleys, at an altitude of from two to seven thousand feet, where the\r\ntemperature rarely exceeds eighty degrees Fahrenheit, or in the hot,\r\nbut dry and therefore comparatively healthful plain between the base of\r\nthe volcanoes and the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nPopulous and partially civilized Indian communities had existed in this\r\npart of America for centuries before the Spanish conquest, and their\r\ndescendants form the bulk of the population of the five republics.\r\nAlthough the original inhabitants were almost exterminated in many\r\ndistricts by the oppression and mistreatment of the early colonists,\r\nenough remained to become the predominant racial element in the\r\nconglomerate population, Spanish in language and religion but Indian\r\nin civilization and standards of living, which arose from the fusion\r\nof the invaders, the aborigines, and the negroes who were brought in\r\nas slaves or escaped to the mainland from the West Indies. This was\r\nespecially true of the three central countries of the Isthmus, and the\r\ndevelopment of these has therefore been somewhat different from that of\r\nCosta Rica, where the white stock predominates even among the common\r\npeople, and from that of Guatemala, where the pure-blooded Indians are\r\nstill a distinct and separate race.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Central American countries are theoretically democracies,\r\nthere is in each a small, powerful upper class, consisting of\r\nthe so-called “principal families.” These are for the most part\r\ndescendants of the prominent creole[2] families of colonial days, and\r\nare therefore in many cases of pure or almost pure Spanish descent. A\r\nlarge proportion,--perhaps the majority,--however, have more or less\r\nIndian and even negro blood in their veins. This class has been able\r\nto maintain its dominant position in the community, partly because of\r\nits command of the government, which it assumed when the republican\r\ninstitutions which the Isthmian patriots attempted to introduce after\r\nthe declaration of independence were found to be unworkable because of\r\nthe ignorance of the mass of the people, but more especially because\r\nof its control over agriculture. At the time of the conquest, the\r\nland, like everything else in the invaded territory, was treated as\r\nthe property of the crown, and that in the neighborhood of the Spanish\r\nsettlements was divided among the colonists by the royal governors.\r\nFurther large allotments were made from time to time during the\r\ncolonial period. After the declaration of independence, the governments\r\nof the several republics continued to regard as state property all\r\nland not already specifically granted, and sold or gave away large\r\ntracts of it to rich natives or foreigners, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat much of the public domain was already occupied by peasants who\r\nhad always considered the patches which they cultivated as their own.\r\nThe number of large holdings has been further increased in some of the\r\nrepublics by the division of the common lands formerly held by each\r\nvillage among the village’s inhabitants; for the beneficiaries have\r\noften sold their shares to their wealthier neighbors. At the present\r\ntime a comparatively small number of persons own a very large amount of\r\nagricultural property, and employ the majority of the other inhabitants\r\nof the Isthmus as workmen on their plantations. The economic and\r\npolitical power of this class would manifestly be very great even\r\nif it were not supported by their prestige as the descendants of the\r\nconquering race.\r\n\r\nAlthough their wealth is entirely agricultural, the “principal\r\nfamilies” invariably reside in the cities. They make frequent visits\r\nto their plantations, which they intrust to the care of overseers, but\r\nthe majority of them show a marked aversion both to country life and\r\nto rural pursuits. As a whole they are neither very enterprising nor\r\nvery energetic. Those who do not inherit a plantation which produces\r\nan income sufficient to support them turn to one of the already\r\novercrowded learned professions rather than to the development of the\r\nnatural resources of their countries, in the exploitation of which\r\nforeigners are daily making fortunes before their eyes. Nearly every\r\nmember of the upper class, moreover, is actively engaged in politics,\r\noften to the exclusion or to the detriment of his other occupations.\r\n\r\nThe wealthier families live in one or two story houses of adobe or\r\nconcrete, which cover a surprisingly large extent of ground but\r\nhave little pretension to architectural beauty or to comfort. These\r\nare built around two, and often three, courtyards or _patios_.\r\nThe front _patio_, upon which open the _sala_, or parlor, and the\r\nbedrooms, generally contains an attractive garden surrounded by an\r\nopen _corredor_, which serves as living room and dining room. At the\r\nrear are the kitchen, stable, and servants’ quarters. The standard of\r\nliving, especially in the less advanced countries, is still rather\r\nprimitive. Furniture and food are of a very simple character, and the\r\nservants, of whom each family employs a large number, are untrained\r\nand inefficient. The band concerts three or four times a week, the\r\ncinematographs, and occasional cheap operettas offer almost the only\r\nopportunity for diversion, except on the very unusual occasions\r\nwhen a government subsidy makes possible a short season of opera\r\nor drama. Social events are comparatively few. In every city there\r\nare two or three civic _fiestas_ during the year, when the native\r\nsociety abandons itself to a round of dancing, horse-racing, and other\r\ngayeties, but at other times the capitals of the Isthmus are decidedly\r\ndull. Life in them has, however, a peculiar charm for the foreigner,\r\nbecause of the kindliness and friendliness of the people.\r\n\r\nSince the building of the railways and the increase of commerce have\r\nbrought the Central American countries into closer touch with the\r\noutside world, there has been a great change in customs and ways of\r\nliving in such places as Guatemala, San Salvador, and San José de\r\nCosta Rica. The high price of coffee during the last decade of the\r\nnineteenth century brought about an era of prosperity such as the\r\nrather backward communities of the Isthmus had never before known.\r\nElaborate private residences and costly public buildings were erected\r\nin the national capitals, and pianos, window glass, modern furniture,\r\nand other articles which had formerly been little used, were imported\r\nfrom Europe in great quantities. After the reaction which set in when\r\nthe value of coffee in the world’s markets declined, the new standard\r\nof living remained, and even the poorer members of the upper classes\r\nnow enjoy most of the comforts and many of the luxuries of modern\r\ncivilization. The tendency to adopt European and North American customs\r\nis greatly furthered by the young people, who in increasing numbers are\r\nsent abroad to school and college, for they return with new tastes and\r\nnew ways of thinking even when they do not acquire a great amount of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nAlthough the members of the upper class are for the most part\r\ndescendants of the _conquistadores_, social and political prominence\r\nis today no longer entirely a matter of birth. The old creole families\r\nformed a narrow and exclusive circle until the latter part of the\r\nnineteenth century, but as a result of factional wars among themselves\r\nand against other portions of the community, they have now become\r\ngenerally impoverished and almost exterminated. A new element,\r\nrecruited from the more intelligent and ambitious members of the lower\r\nclasses, has meanwhile achieved a large amount of political power,\r\nand has perforce been admitted to a position almost of equality with\r\nthe old aristocracy. At the present time, humble birth in itself is\r\nno obstacle to advancement, although educational opportunities are so\r\nlimited, and the part played by family influence and favoritism is so\r\ngreat, that only the most capable and energetic boys from the lower\r\nclasses can hold their own with those to whom the accident of birth has\r\ngiven powerful friends and greater opportunities for study.\r\n\r\nThe half-breeds, known as _ladinos_ or _mestizos_, occupy an\r\nintermediate position between the white aristocracy and the great mass\r\nof the laboring population, in which the Indian blood predominates.\r\nFor the most part these are artisans, or skilled laborers, in the\r\ntowns. They are generally clever workmen, enterprising and quick to\r\nlearn, but without the capacity to work steadily and diligently for any\r\none object. They occupy practically all of the positions which call\r\nfor manual dexterity or special training. Many become more prominent\r\nthan the persons of pure Spanish descent in the public schools and\r\nuniversities, and not a few rise to high positions in the government or\r\nin the learned professions.\r\n\r\nIn each of the five republics there are some small farmers, who are\r\nfor the most part descendants of the early Spanish colonists. These\r\nare the leading citizens of the smaller towns and villages. They do\r\nnot always have property of their own, but often cultivate fields\r\nallotted to them by the municipalities of which they are citizens.\r\nThe new settlements which were founded from time to time during the\r\ncolonial period were given tracts of land, usually a league square, to\r\nbe used in common by their inhabitants, one part as pasture, another as\r\nforest, and a third to be apportioned each year among the members of\r\nthe community. Similar grants were made to many of the Indian villages\r\nand tribes, which in some cases received a title to much larger tracts\r\nthan their white neighbors. These common lands still exist in all of\r\nthe republics, but the number of villages which hold them has been\r\ngreatly reduced because some of the governments, as in Costa Rica and\r\nGuatemala, have enacted laws dividing them among the inhabitants,\r\nin the hope of stimulating private enterprise. The property thus\r\napportioned, as we have stated above, was frequently sold to the rich\r\nplanters, especially in the districts where the climate was suited\r\nto the cultivation of coffee, and the former owners became part of\r\nthe class of landless laborers. Even where this has not occurred, the\r\nsmaller villages have in most places decayed because of the emigration\r\nof their inhabitants to the cities and to the coffee-growing centers.\r\nThe small-scale agriculturist has ceased to be an economic factor of\r\nimportance, except in Costa Rica and in some parts of Salvador; and\r\ntoday there are few places more lifeless and more depressing than the\r\nonce prosperous settlements in the more remote country districts.\r\n\r\nThe household servants and the common laborers, who form the poorest\r\nclasses, are descendants of the native tribes whom the _conquistadores_\r\novercame and enslaved early in the sixteenth century. The first\r\nsettlers everywhere forced the Indians to work for them, either\r\nby declaring them slaves, as a punishment for rebellion, or by\r\nestablishing the _encomienda_ system, under which influential Spaniards\r\nwere intrusted with the religious instruction of the inhabitants of\r\ncertain villages, and in return for the benefits thus conferred were\r\nallowed to demand a certain amount of labor from their spiritual\r\ncharges. These _encomiendas_, or _repartimientos_, were the principal\r\nsource of income among the early colonists. The unfortunate aborigines\r\nwere compelled to work in mines or plantations or to bring in tribute\r\nto their masters, and they were treated with the most revolting cruelty\r\nwhen they failed to do so. After the Spanish government became aware of\r\nthe grave abuses which the system involved, it ordered its suppression,\r\nbut the _encomiendas_ were finally abolished only after a long struggle\r\nwith the colonists, who were secretly aided by the royal governors in\r\nmaintaining their privileges. The Indians never entirely regained their\r\neconomic independence, for their descendants, with the exception of a\r\nfew thousands who live an isolated, half-savage life in clearings in\r\nthe forest, are to the present day dependent upon employment on the\r\nplantations of the white families.\r\n\r\nWhether in the cities or in the country, the laboring classes live in\r\none or two room huts of adobe or wood, with dirt floors and thatched\r\nroofs. A crude table and two or three chairs, one or more beds of\r\nrawhide or wood, and often a shrine, with a small image of the Virgin\r\nor of some saint, comprise the entire furniture. The walls are\r\ndecorated with colored prints and advertisements, which are much prized\r\nby those fortunate enough to secure them from some passing traveler\r\nor from friends in the city. There is usually a loft in one end of\r\nthe hut, in which the stock of corn and beans, if there is any, and\r\na few of the more bulky family possessions are kept, while the small\r\ntools and utensils and the contents of the larder are suspended from\r\nthe walls. Water, which is often brought by the women on their heads\r\nfrom some little distance, is contained in large earthenware jars and\r\ndipped out in gourds, which serve not only as cups but as washbasins.\r\nCooking is performed over an open fire on a brick platform, where there\r\nis sometimes a primitive oven. The family livestock is represented by\r\na few pigs and chickens, which associate on friendly terms, inside and\r\noutside of the house, with the lean dogs and naked children.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, the Central American laborer lives contentedly\r\nand without worry, for he requires few clothes and but a small amount\r\nof inexpensive food. Corn, prepared in the form of _tortillas_, beans\r\nand rice cooked with lard, and coffee form the diet of the average\r\nfamily day after day. Plantains are also eaten in great quantities in\r\nsome parts of the Isthmus, and eggs can frequently be secured. Meat\r\ncan be had only occasionally outside of the cities, and vegetables,\r\nalthough easily grown, are little cultivated. The same is true of the\r\ninnumerable and delicious tropical fruits, which grow up where accident\r\ndictates, without care or protection.\r\n\r\nBecause of the primitive living conditions, there is a considerable\r\namount of disease and a high death rate, especially among the children.\r\nMalarial fever and typhoid are common, and intestinal parasites are\r\nomnipresent. The hookworm, especially, has done incalculable harm.\r\nThe eradication of this disease has recently been undertaken by\r\nthe governments of several of the five republics, with the aid of\r\nthe International Health Commission of the Rockefeller Foundation,\r\nwhich has contributed large sums of money and lent trained men for\r\nthe prosecution of the work. The prevalence of the hookworm, which\r\nperhaps contributes as much as any other factor to the poor physical\r\ncondition of most tropical races, is indicated by the fact that of\r\nthe persons examined by the representatives of the Commission in\r\n1915, 60.1 per cent were found to be infected in Costa Rica, 58.6 per\r\ncent in Guatemala, and 49.4 per cent in Nicaragua.[3] Notable results\r\nhave already been obtained, not only in curing sufferers, but in\r\neducating the people and their governments to appreciate the need for\r\nimprovements in sanitation and the need for closer attention to the\r\npublic health in general. When the principles of hygiene are better\r\nunderstood in the Isthmus, and when better systems of sewers and\r\nwater supply are provided, the Central American cities should be as\r\nhealthful as any in the temperate zones, for their moderate climate and\r\nthe porousness of the volcanic soil upon which they are situated should\r\ndo much to prevent the diseases common in other parts of the tropics.\r\n\r\nIn the country villages, life is extremely uneventful and deadening.\r\nThe women spend a large amount of time in visiting one another and in\r\nattending church services or prayer meetings. The men work, where there\r\nis work, on week days, and get drunk on _aguardiente_, or sugar-cane\r\nrum, on Sunday. The fiestas and fairs, which are held at least once\r\na year in every village, are mainly an occasion for gambling and\r\ndebauchery, so far as the common people are concerned. There are few\r\nother recreations. The monotony of such an existence, which leads\r\nthe rural laborers to embark on any adventure offering promise of\r\nexcitement and prospects for loot, is one of the factors which makes\r\nit easy to raise a revolutionary army in many of the Central American\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nExcept in Guatemala, where there exists a peonage system which will\r\nbe described later, the wages of the working man are not very low,\r\nconsidering the fact that his services are of far less value to\r\nthe employer than would be those of one who was more energetic and\r\nintelligent. They range in general from the equivalent of fifteen cents\r\nUnited States currency a day with food and lodging to thirty, forty, or\r\neven fifty cents a day without it, and in some places are still higher.\r\nThe workmen are neither conscientious nor physically strong, and the\r\namount which they accomplish in a day is small. On many plantations,\r\npayment is made by the task, and the employees work intermittently,\r\nfrequently failing to appear for days at a time. This is in part due\r\nto the prevalence of drunkenness and disease, and in part simply to\r\nan indisposition to work more than is necessary to provide a bare\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nThere is little pretense of equality in the treatment by the government\r\nof the upper and lower classes. The laborers and country people\r\nare forced to bear the entire burden of the military service which\r\nis theoretically required of all, and to perform work on the roads\r\nand other public undertakings from which the wealthy families are\r\npractically exempt; and they are everywhere taxed heavily, although by\r\nindirect means, for the benefit of the professional politicians who\r\noccupy posts in the government. The petty local officials exercise an\r\nalmost irresponsible authority over them, and frequently use their\r\npower for their own personal advantage or for that of their friends.\r\nThe poor man enjoys little security in his personal or property rights,\r\nand thus has little incentive to better his position.\r\n\r\nEducation, however, has done much in the last twenty-five years to\r\nimprove the situation of the masses in the more advanced republics,\r\nfor the laboring man who learns to read and write has in his hands a\r\npowerful weapon both for his own protection and for the advancement\r\nof his political and economic interests. In Costa Rica, where public\r\nschools have been established everywhere and the percentage of\r\nilliteracy is comparatively insignificant, the peasants are assuming\r\na more influential place in the community. Salvador, Nicaragua, and\r\nHonduras have been prevented by internal disorder and lack of resources\r\nfrom raising their educational systems to the level of that of their\r\nmore tranquil neighbor, but their rulers have taken a very real\r\ninterest in popular instruction, and have made it possible for a very\r\nlarge part of the people to acquire a knowledge of reading and writing.\r\nIn Guatemala alone the great majority of the inhabitants are at present\r\nilliterate. This is not entirely the fault of the government, which\r\nhas instituted a large number of schools and has legislated for the\r\nestablishment of others by the owners of plantations, but is due rather\r\nto the indifference of the Indians themselves, who as a rule do not\r\ncare even to learn to speak Spanish.\r\n\r\nPublic and private morality have been rather disastrously affected by\r\nthe social conditions arising from the conquest of a half-civilized\r\nrace by adventurers who in too many cases belonged to the lowest and\r\nworst classes in Spain. The Indians who continued to form the bulk of\r\nthe population were deprived of their own religious and moral customs,\r\nand were given in their place a Christianity which was imposed upon\r\nthem by force, and of which, because of the cruelty and licentiousness\r\nof their conquerors, they saw only the worst side. The oppression and\r\nviolence which characterized the communities of the Isthmus during\r\ntheir early history long prevented their social life from acquiring\r\nstability, and made brute force, rather than conscience or public\r\nopinion, the ruling principle in private as well as in public affairs.\r\nEven at present, in some of the five countries, political and social\r\nconditions tend to militate against public spirit and altruism in\r\npublic life and personal honesty in private life. Social conditions\r\nalso leave much to be desired. With the men of the upper classes, ideas\r\nof morality are generally rather loose, and it is not unusual to see a\r\nrespected citizen bringing up a number of children by other women side\r\nby side with those of his lawful wife. The community not only does not\r\ncensure his careless observance of the marital tie, but even receives\r\nthe illegitimate offspring on practically the same footing as the\r\nlegitimate. With the half-breed laborers, marriage is an institution\r\nwhich finds little favor, not, as is sometimes said, because of the\r\nexpense which the ceremony involves, but because both the men and the\r\nwomen dislike the obligations and ties which a formal union creates,\r\nand prefer a relation which, although generally fairly permanent, can\r\nbe broken off by either party at will.\r\n\r\nThis low morality is to a very great extent due to the lack of\r\nreligious restraints. At one time, the Catholic Church, to which all\r\nof the people nominally belong, was very powerful throughout the\r\nIsthmus, and the clergy and the numerous monasteries exercised a strong\r\nsocial and political influence. A few years after the declaration\r\nof independence, however, the Liberal leaders, who had been opposed\r\nby the clerical party in their struggle to regain power during the\r\nyears 1826-29, expelled the archbishop and many of the other priests,\r\nand suppressed all of the convents. The religious orders were never\r\nrevived, except in Guatemala after the Conservative victory of 1839.\r\nThere they continued to exercise a dominant influence until the\r\nrevolution of 1871, after which the government again suppressed them\r\nand took radical measures to destroy the influence of the secular\r\nclergy. In the other countries, the priests continued to play a small\r\npart in politics, usually as the allies of the Conservative party,\r\nbut at present their influence can hardly be said to be important. In\r\nspiritual as well as in temporal affairs the Church has now almost\r\nentirely lost its hold on the people. Many of the women are still very\r\ndevout, but the men, especially among the upper classes, are for the\r\nmost part frankly irreligious. In the country districts, few of the\r\nchurches can support a priest, and religious observances are confined\r\nto prayer meetings, led and participated in by the women, and to the\r\nrather licentious celebration of holy days. Among the priests, many of\r\nwhom are foreigners, there are some who lead an irreproachable life,\r\nbut many others, especially in the poorer countries, do much to harm\r\nthe Church by their scandalous conduct. There are a few missionaries\r\nfrom England and the United States, but Protestantism is so utterly\r\nunsuited to the temperament of the people that they have made few\r\nconverts.\r\n\r\nThe Central American has, nevertheless, many good qualities. He is\r\ngood-natured, affable, profoundly attached to his friends and the\r\nmembers of his family, and deeply susceptible to lofty ideals and\r\npatriotic impulses. In every city there are a number of men who are\r\ndistinguished for their personal integrity and their scrupulous\r\nhonesty, whose influence and example do much to offset the demoralizing\r\neffects of conspicuous political corruption and commercial dishonesty.\r\nEven among the most brutal and the most ignorant of the men who have\r\nbeen in power in the various republics, there have been few who have\r\nnot done what they could, in spite of the difficulties presented by\r\narmed opposition and administrative disorganization, to promote the\r\nsocial and economic progress of their countries.\r\n\r\nThe backwardness of the five republics is in large part due to the\r\nisolation in which they were kept by Spain during the three centuries\r\nof their existence as colonies. Their development was restricted\r\nuntil the beginning of the nineteenth century by a misguided policy\r\nwhich made progress almost impossible. Agriculture and industry were\r\nhampered by burdensome regulations and taxes which not only prevented\r\nthe cultivation of many products for which the country was admirably\r\nsuited, but also made difficult, if not impossible, the exportation of\r\nthose which could be grown. The prohibition of commercial intercourse\r\nwith foreign countries and the restriction of that with Spain, combined\r\nwith other obstacles to transportation to and from Europe, practically\r\nshut off Central America from the rest of the world during the entire\r\ncolonial period. Even the declaration of independence in 1821 made\r\nlittle immediate change in this respect, for the new republics had\r\nstill no direct means of communication with Europe and North America.\r\nThey all faced the Pacific rather than the Atlantic Ocean. Guatemala\r\nCity, San Salvador, and the other capitals were not only nearer to the\r\nWest than to the East Coast, but they were separated from the latter by\r\nmountainous country and pestiferous jungles through which traveling\r\nwas difficult and dangerous. It was not until the construction of the\r\nPanama and Tehuantepec Railways brought the West Coast ports within\r\ncomparatively easy reach of the centers of the world’s trade that they\r\ncould export their products profitably. More recently the construction\r\nof railways across Guatemala and Costa Rica has given those countries\r\nan outlet upon the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nEven after the main obstacles to communication with the outside world\r\nhad been removed, the economic development of the five republics was\r\nheld back by internal conditions, for the political disturbances which\r\ncharacterized their first half century under republican institutions,\r\nand which are still prevalent in some of them, made large scale\r\nagriculture difficult and unprofitable, and discouraged commerce.\r\nThe civil wars often drew the laborers away from the plantations at\r\nthe time when their services were most needed, and caused a periodic\r\ndestruction of property and a laying waste of planted fields. In\r\nGuatemala, Costa Rica, and Salvador, where revolutions have been less\r\ncommon during the last generation, the wealthier classes have become\r\nvery prosperous through the production and exportation of coffee, but\r\nHonduras and Nicaragua, because of the almost continuous fighting\r\nbetween rival factions, are today but little better off than in 1821.\r\n\r\nAll of the five Central American countries are still purely\r\nagricultural communities. Manufacturing has never advanced beyond the\r\npoint of providing a few primitive articles for home consumption, and\r\nthe native industries have declined since the increase of commercial\r\nrelations with the outside world has made it more profitable to import\r\nmany things, such as textiles, furniture, and leather goods, than to\r\nmake them with the crude tools of the local craftsman. There are a few\r\nsmall factories in each city which produce _aguardiente_, cigars and\r\ncigarettes, cloth, candles, and other articles, but in none of them is\r\nthere employed a great amount of capital or a great number of laborers.\r\nThe most important agricultural products, from the native point of\r\nview, are the staple food crops, among which corn, which is cultivated\r\nby every farmer in every part of the Isthmus, holds first place. Beans,\r\nrice, sugar cane, and plantains are also found everywhere where they\r\nwill grow. Potatoes, cacao, and countless varieties of fruits and\r\nvegetables from the temperate zone as well as from the tropics are\r\nraised here and there in the climates suited to them, but comparatively\r\nlittle interest is shown in their cultivation, and they are\r\nsurprisingly hard to obtain except in the markets of the larger towns.\r\nAgricultural methods have changed little since the Spanish conquest.\r\nExcept in the most thickly settled regions, the old Indian system of\r\nplanting is still employed. A patch of forest is cleared by cutting\r\ndown the larger trees and burning off the undergrowth and branches, and\r\nthe seed is sown among the charred trunks in holes made with a pointed\r\nstick. After being used for one year, the land is planted with grass\r\nfor pasture or allowed to return to its original condition, and is not\r\ncultivated again for from three to five seasons. In the regions where\r\nthe density of the population makes it necessary to plant the fields\r\nyear after year, a crude form of wooden plow is used, but fertilizers\r\nand modern agricultural implements are little known. The _machete_, a\r\nlong heavy knife which each laborer carries at his belt, serves as axe,\r\nhoe, and trowel. The soil is so rich, however, that it produces two and\r\nin some places even three crops each season without apparently becoming\r\nimpoverished.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua and Honduras, and in the low country along the Pacific\r\nCoast of the other republics, a large part of the land is devoted to\r\ncattle _haciendas_. The stock as a rule is not of a very fine type.\r\nExcept on a few ranches no attempt has been made to improve the race\r\nof the herds by the importation of animals from abroad, and the native\r\nstock seems to have degenerated somewhat as the result of centuries of\r\nlife in a hot climate. The cattle receive little attention from their\r\nowners, and in some regions die by thousands in dry years for lack of\r\nfood and water. Practically all of the meat is consumed in Central\r\nAmerica, for the surplus product of Honduras and Nicaragua is bought\r\nby their more densely populated neighbors. The hides and horns are\r\nexported to the United States and Europe, but the occasional attempts\r\nwhich have been made in recent years to do the same with a few thousand\r\nhead of live cattle have not been very successful. Dairy products play\r\nbut a small part in Central American domestic economy. The native cows\r\nproduce little milk, and the cheese which is made in large quantities\r\nis commonly of a very inferior quality.\r\n\r\nUntil several years after the declaration of independence practically\r\nthe only exports of Central America were the forest products of the\r\nEast Coast and small amounts of indigo, cochineal, and cacao from the\r\ncommunities on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. The five republics had\r\nvery little commerce, and for this reason had little intercourse with\r\nthe outside world. This state of affairs was completely changed when\r\nthe coffee plant was introduced from the West Indies in the second\r\nquarter of the last century. As the soil and climate on the slopes\r\nof the volcanoes along the western coast were found to be admirably\r\nsuited to this valuable crop, and the product of Central America from\r\nthe first commanded a high price in the European markets, the number\r\nof plantations increased rapidly, and the new industry soon became the\r\nchief interest of the landed proprietors in Guatemala, Costa Rica,\r\nand Salvador, and to a less extent in Nicaragua. The cultivation of\r\ncoffee was in fact carried to a point where it seriously affected the\r\nproduction of the staple food crops, for land formerly planted with\r\ncorn and beans was turned into _cafetales_, and the inhabitants of the\r\nrural districts, who formerly raised enough food to supply their own\r\nwants and to sell a small amount in the cities, were led by the greater\r\nearnings or were forced by official pressure to become laborers on the\r\ncoffee plantations. Food prices have consequently risen, and it has\r\nbecome necessary to import flour, rice, and sometimes even beans and\r\ncorn from other countries. When land has once been planted with coffee\r\ntrees, which require from three to five years to come into bearing and\r\nthus represent a large amount of fixed capital, it is difficult to\r\nreturn it to its original uses, or to release the laborers from the\r\nplantation to engage in other occupations, even though in eras of low\r\ncoffee prices the production of other crops might be more profitable.\r\n\r\nCoffee is most advantageously grown on a large scale, as its\r\npreparation for the market requires the removal of the pulp of the\r\nberry and of the two skins of the bean itself by rather expensive\r\nand complicated machinery. The better plantations in Central America\r\nproduce from 200,000 to 1,000,000 pounds of cleaned coffee each\r\nyear,[4] and have their own _beneficios_, or cleaning mills. The\r\nfarmers who operate on a smaller scale, or who for some reason have not\r\nfound it profitable to install a cleaning mill, send their coffee to\r\n_beneficios_ in important shipping centers, where the work is performed\r\nat so much per bag. Before the war the greater part of the product was\r\nexported to Germany, England, or France, but the partial closing of the\r\nmarket in Europe has caused increasing amounts to be sent to the United\r\nStates since 1914.[5]\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of the export trade and the corresponding\r\nincrease in the imports of the five republics would not have been\r\npossible without the improvement in means of transportation which has\r\ntaken place during the last half century. There has been a remarkable\r\nbetterment, especially in the facilities for travel between Central\r\nAmerica and the United States. On the Atlantic side, the United\r\nFruit Company, and, in times of peace, the Hamburg-American line, as\r\nwell as a number of smaller companies, provide an ample freight and\r\npassenger service between all of the important ports and New Orleans\r\nand New York. From Puerto Barrios and Puerto Limon, the termini of\r\nthe transisthmian railroads, there are several boats each week. The\r\nconditions on the West Coast are much less satisfactory, for the\r\nPacific Mail Steamship Company, which has almost a monopoly since the\r\nGerman Cosmos Line was forced to withdraw by the war, provides a very\r\nirregular and rather expensive service. Even there, however, conditions\r\nare immeasurably better than at the time of the opening of the Panama\r\nRailway in 1855.\r\n\r\nInternal communications have also been improved. Fifty years ago,\r\nthere were practically no railways in the entire Isthmus, but at the\r\npresent time each of the national capitals, except Tegucigalpa, is\r\nconnected with one or more seaports by daily train service. Other\r\nforms of transportation and travel, however, are still in a rather\r\nprimitive state. Some of the republics have spent large amounts of\r\nmoney in constructing roads for bringing the products of the country to\r\nthe cities or to the railway stations, but as a rule the impecunious\r\ngovernments have not been able to make much headway against the\r\ndifficulties presented by the mountainous character of the country and\r\nthe torrential rains of the wet season. There are few highways which\r\nare suitable for any vehicle more elaborate than the slow-going oxcart,\r\nand in many places even these have to give way to the pack mule.\r\n\r\nOne of the forces which has been most potent in bringing Central\r\nAmerica into closer contact with the outside world has been the\r\ncultivation of bananas by North American enterprise along the low,\r\ndensely wooded Atlantic Coast. Until recently almost the only\r\ninhabitants of this region were scattered, uncivilized tribes descended\r\nfrom Indians and runaway West Indian negroes, who lived in an extremely\r\nprimitive way in clearings along the shore or on the banks of the\r\nrivers. There were one or two struggling ports and a few settlements\r\nof woodcutters who traded in mahogany, logwood, and Spanish cedar, but\r\nthese had little intercourse with the civilized communities of the\r\ninterior. Within little more than a quarter century, this unpleasant\r\nand unhealthful but marvelously fertile region has been transformed.\r\nGreat banana farms have been created in the formerly impassable jungle,\r\nand a net of railways has been built to carry the perishable fruit to\r\nthe ports, from which it is shipped in fast steamers to the United\r\nStates and Europe. This is the work of one American corporation, the\r\nUnited Fruit Company, which controls the banana trade not only of\r\nCentral America, but of the West Indies as well. As the plantations and\r\nthe transportation lines are managed principally by North Americans and\r\nthe manual labor is performed by negroes from the British West Indies,\r\nEnglish is the predominant language of the new towns which have sprung\r\nup. To the native Central American, the Coast is almost a foreign\r\ncountry. The Caribbean ports of Honduras and Nicaragua are in fact\r\nfor all practical purposes farther from Tegucigalpa and Managua than\r\nfrom New Orleans, and even in those countries where there are better\r\nmeans of transportation from the interior to the fruit ports the banana\r\ncountry has developed in its own way, influenced little, economically\r\nor politically, by the communities of the interior. The interior towns,\r\nhowever, have been profoundly affected by the changes on the East\r\nCoast. The fruit trade is mainly responsible for the improvement of the\r\nsteamship service; and in Guatemala and Costa Rica the railways built\r\noriginally for the transportation of bananas have been extended to the\r\ncapitals of the two republics, so that the journey from Europe and\r\nNorth America to those cities, and through them to other parts of the\r\nIsthmus, has been shortened by several days.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of several of the republics, the last fifty years have\r\nseen a considerable immigration of foreign business men and planters,\r\namong whom Germans and North Americans have been the most numerous,\r\nalthough there have also been many Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Italians.\r\nThe newcomers have obtained almost complete control over the foreign\r\ntrade of the Isthmus, and even the retail trade at the present time is\r\nlargely in the hands of Spanish, Chinese, and Armenian shopkeepers.\r\nMercantile pursuits were at one time one of the chief occupations\r\nof the creole families, but most of the easy-going Central American\r\nmerchants, accustomed to the routine created by three centuries of\r\nisolation, have been unable to hold their own under changed conditions.\r\nThe same is true, though to a less extent, in agriculture. Many of the\r\nfinest plantations were developed in the first place by foreigners,\r\nand others are constantly passing into their hands. The majority of\r\nthose still belonging to natives are heavily mortgaged, for the Central\r\nAmerican planter apparently cannot resist the temptation to borrow\r\nmoney, notwithstanding the high rates of interest and the ruinous\r\nconditions on which he secures it. There are several European firms\r\nwhose business it is to make loans secured by plantations and crops.\r\nThese eventually take over the properties which fall under their\r\ncontrol, either reselling them or operating them on their own account.\r\n\r\nThere are also several small and not very scrupulous banks, of which\r\nthe majority have been established, in part at least, with foreign\r\ncapital. In some of the republics these have co-operated effectively\r\nwith the officials in the disorganization of the currency and of the\r\ngovernment finances. Large investments have been made by North American\r\ninterests in railways and mines. The total amount of foreign capital\r\nin the country is, however, comparatively small, because internal\r\ndisorders and the slowness with which the country has been opened up\r\nhave until lately discouraged investments. There is still an immense\r\nfield for foreign enterprise in the exploitation of Central America’s\r\nnatural resources, which include not only land suitable for the\r\nproduction of almost every kind of agricultural product, but also great\r\nforests of valuable woods and as yet untouched mineral deposits.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, the relations between Central America and the outside\r\nworld have not been entirely beneficial to the communities of the\r\nIsthmus. Many of the foreigners, especially among the Americans, have\r\nbeen fugitives from justice in their own countries who have used their\r\ntalents to the disadvantage of the natives, or adventurers who have\r\nmixed in the politics of the country for their own profit. Unscrupulous\r\ncorporations or individuals have exploited the inexperience or cupidity\r\nof the local governments to obtain valuable concessions without\r\nmaking any adequate return for the favors received, and have not even\r\nhesitated to incite or to assist revolutions when they thought that\r\ntheir interests would be furthered by doing so. Too many of the foreign\r\nbusiness men have done what they could to make worse the already\r\nlow standards of commercial morality and have shown themselves more\r\nunprincipled than their native competitors. In spite of the distrust\r\ngenerated by hard experiences, however, the Central Americans do not\r\nseem to dislike the newcomers or greatly to resent their intrusion.\r\nMany North Americans and Europeans have become respected and\r\ninfluential residents of the communities in which they have settled,\r\nand marriages between foreigners and natives of the better class, which\r\nhave been generally welcomed by the creole families, are gradually\r\ngiving rise to a half-foreign element which is becoming more and more\r\nprominent in each of the five republics.\r\n\r\nCloser contact with the outside world has thus brought about entirely\r\nnew conditions throughout the Isthmus. What the final result of the\r\npresent changes will be, it is difficult to say. The native families\r\nare now more and more losing their hold on the economic life of\r\nthe country, for commerce, banking, mining, and to an increasingly\r\ngreater extent agriculture, are controlled by foreigners. They are\r\ntherefore being forced into the learned professions, which afford a\r\nvery poor livelihood for any but the most able, and into politics.\r\nTheir influence is becoming less and less, and the time seems not far\r\ndistant when the dominant place in the community will be assumed by the\r\nforeigners and their descendants, who will probably be assimilated to\r\na great extent into the native population. Some of the more energetic\r\nand intelligent native families will doubtless be able to maintain\r\ntheir present wealth and influence, although they will be forced to\r\nchange their customs and habits completely, as many of them are already\r\ndoing in the more advanced countries. Whether political and social\r\nconditions will be improved or made worse by these developments it is\r\nstill too early to say, but it is inevitable that both the character of\r\nthe governments and the conditions of the people as a whole should be\r\nprofoundly affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The estimated area and population of the five countries, as given\r\nin the Statesman’s Year Book for 1916, are:\r\n\r\n                     _Area._              _Population._\r\nGuatemala     48,290 square miles.  2,003,579.

The\r\nexisting administrative machinery was not for the moment abolished,\r\nfor many of the officials had approved of and had taken a prominent\r\npart in the action of the separatist party. The Governor General,\r\nBrigadier Gainza, continued to exercise the executive power, and the\r\nlocal governors in Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica were\r\ninstructed to do the same. In the capital, a committee of influential\r\nnatives, called the _Junta Consultiva_, was appointed to assist the\r\nformer royal authorities until a new form of government should be\r\ndecided upon. There was no armed resistance to this action on the part\r\nof the mother country, for the latter, engaged in a prolonged struggle\r\nwith her more important colonies in the South, was in no position to\r\nsend troops to subjugate the inaccessible and relatively insignificant\r\ncommunities of Central America.\r\n\r\nThe prospect which confronted the provinces thus thrown upon their own\r\nresources was far from bright. They were ill equipped for existence\r\nas an independent nation. The creole aristocrats, who had led the\r\nmovement for separation from Spain, and who now assumed control of\r\nthe government, had had little training to fit them for the exercise\r\nof their new responsibilities, for few had received more than the\r\nmost rudimentary education at home, and fewer still had traveled in\r\nforeign countries. None had had any practical experience in political\r\naffairs, for it had always been the policy of the royal authorities\r\nto fill official positions exclusively with Peninsular Spaniards,[6]\r\nthus excluding the natives of the colonies from all share in the\r\nadministration. There were a half-score of brilliant leaders in the\r\ncouncils of the new nation, but they were notable rather for their\r\nexalted but impractical ideals than for any grasp of the concrete\r\nsituation with which they had to deal at home. Their patriotism was of\r\na high order, but their statesmanship left much to be desired. Among\r\nthe common people, the great majority were ignorant and superstitious\r\nIndians, with a small admixture of Spanish blood and a thin veneer\r\nof Spanish civilization. They were scattered through a strip of land\r\neight hundred miles in length, in isolated valleys, separated from\r\none another by mountain ranges and pestilential jungles, where rough\r\nmule trails afforded the only means of communication. Throughout the\r\ngreater part of the Isthmus, the people of each village, having little\r\ncommerce with their neighbors or with the outside world, depended for\r\nsubsistence almost entirely upon their own products. A few favored\r\nsections produced indigo, cochineal, or precious metals for export, but\r\nthe expense of shipping these articles from the Pacific Coast to Spain,\r\nthe only country with which the colonists were allowed to trade, was so\r\ngreat that the planters derived little profit from them. Standards of\r\nliving were therefore little higher, even in the cities, than they had\r\nbeen three hundred years before.\r\n\r\nThe Central American nation was divided within itself from the very\r\nfirst. In Guatemala there was a bitter jealousy, created by the special\r\nprivileges and the pretensions of the more favored classes, between\r\nthe Peninsular officials and the creole great families on the one hand\r\nand between the latter and the merchants and professional men of less\r\naristocratic origin on the other; and this feeling was intensified by\r\nradical differences of opinion about religious and economic questions.\r\nBesides the dissensions within the group which assumed the control of\r\npolitical affairs in the capital, there were factional conflicts and\r\nlocal civil wars in almost every part of the Isthmus. The provinces,\r\nwhich had long felt that their interests were sacrificed by the royal\r\nauthorities to those of Guatemala, showed an inclination to dispute\r\nthe authority of the new central government, and their insubordination\r\nwas encouraged by the ambitious local governors, who desired to enjoy\r\nindependent authority, and by the not inconsiderable party which still\r\nremained loyal to Spain. San Salvador, Comayagua, Leon, and Cartago,\r\nthe seats of the provincial governments, were soon the centers of more\r\nor less open revolts against Gainza and the _Junta Consultiva_, while\r\nother towns, actuated on their side by jealousy of the local capitals,\r\nallied themselves to the party in control in Guatemala. The result was\r\na condition of anarchy which throttled agriculture and commerce, and\r\nalmost put an end to all semblance of organized government.\r\n\r\nThe inexperience of the creole leaders, and the conflicts between\r\njealous social classes and rival towns, were the more disastrous\r\nbecause the Central American communities possessed no political\r\ninstitutions which could be used as the basis for the establishment of\r\nan independent government. In this respect they were in a situation\r\nvery different from that of the United States in 1783, for in that\r\ncountry the state and local organizations had remained almost unchanged\r\ndespite the revolution, and the creation of a new central authority\r\nhad been made comparatively easy by the inherent political capacity\r\nderived from centuries of racial experience in self-government. In\r\nCentral America, the country had been ruled for three hundred years by\r\nofficials and laws imposed by an outside force, and when this force\r\nwas withdrawn the old order fell to pieces, leaving nothing to take\r\nits place. The self-appointed revolutionary committees had little hold\r\non the loyalty of the people, and little power to make their commands\r\nrespected. The only political institution which may be said to have\r\nsurvived the change was the municipality. Even in colonial times,\r\nthe wealthier creoles had been able to purchase positions in the\r\n_ayuntamientos_, or governing boards of the cities, and had thus had\r\na voice in the management of certain purely local affairs. After the\r\ndeclaration of independence, the _ayuntamientos_ were in many places\r\nalmost the only respected authority, and they played a large part both\r\nin maintaining order and in organizing the _juntas_ which took charge\r\nof provincial affairs. But they never formed a real basis for the\r\nformation of state and national governments, because their independence\r\nand authority, which had been small under Spanish rule, was taken\r\nfrom them early in the revolutionary era by the military despots who\r\nobtained control of affairs. Their prominence during the transitional\r\nperiod after 1821 contributed little to the establishment of orderly\r\ngovernment, for they were the foci of the local jealousies which did\r\nmore than anything else to keep the country in a state of anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe organization of a permanent government, to take the place of\r\nthe provisional revolutionary committees, consequently presented a\r\ndifficult problem. There was from the first a strong party which\r\nfavored the establishment of a federal republic, but the majority of\r\nthe wealthy classes, who had supported the declaration of independence\r\nonly because of their jealousy of the Peninsular Spaniards who\r\nmonopolized the official positions and because they realized that the\r\nmother country was no longer in a position to protect her colonies from\r\noutside aggression and internal disorder, doubted the ability of the\r\npeople of the Isthmus to rule themselves under republican institutions,\r\nand advocated the union of the five provinces with Iturbide’s Mexican\r\nempire. This party soon grew very strong as the result of disorders\r\nwhich broke out in Honduras and Nicaragua, and on January 25, 1822, the\r\n_Junta Consultiva_ voted in favor of the annexation. General Filísola,\r\nthe representative of the Emperor, reached the capital a few months\r\nlater, and proceeded at once with an army against the people of San\r\nSalvador, who had refused to recognize his authority. He had barely\r\novercome the resistance of the republicans there when news arrived that\r\nIturbide had fallen.\r\n\r\nFilísola, returning to the capital, called together a congress of\r\nrepresentatives from each of the five provinces, to which he turned\r\nover his power. This body, assuming the title of National Constituent\r\nAssembly, declared the former Central American colonies a federal\r\nrepublic, and appointed a provisional executive committee of three men,\r\nwho exercised a precarious authority, subject to constant interference\r\nby the Assembly, for two years. During this time, the Assembly framed\r\nan elaborate constitution, modeled on that of the United States,\r\nestablishing a federal government in Guatemala City, and state\r\ngovernments in each of the five provinces. A president and five _Jefes\r\nde Estado_, chosen by the people through electoral colleges, took the\r\nplace of the Captain General and the royal provincial governors, and\r\nthe law-making power was placed in the hands of a Congress of one\r\nchamber. The system of checks and balances in the American constitution\r\nwas taken over and made more intricate by elaborate provisions for\r\nthe maintenance of the independence of the legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial departments and for the prevention of abuses of power.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly also adopted much progressive legislation, which did away\r\nwith many of the worst features of the Spanish regime. From the first,\r\nhowever, its sessions were disturbed by irreconcilable differences of\r\nopinion between the radical members, who were in the majority, and the\r\nclergy and many of the rich landowners and merchants, who disapproved\r\nof the proposed reforms. As a result of this conflict, two parties\r\nwere formed, which called themselves “Liberals” and “Conservatives.”\r\nThe Liberals controlled the first constitutional congress, which met\r\nin 1825, and elected their candidate, Manuel José Arce, President\r\nof the Republic. The latter, however, soon quarreled with his own\r\nparty, dissolved the congress, and even overthrew and reorganized the\r\nstate government of Guatemala, with the aid of the Conservatives.\r\nThese arbitrary acts caused revolts in many parts of the Isthmus,\r\nand especially in Salvador. The people of that state had always been\r\npeculiarly jealous of the control of their affairs from Guatemala,\r\nand their hostility towards the capital had been increased by the\r\nopposition of the federal authorities to the creation of a new diocese\r\nin their territory. Under the leadership of Father Delgado, who aspired\r\nto the bishopric, they united with the disaffected party in Honduras\r\nand Guatemala in a two years’ war against Arce, and finally succeeded\r\nin overthrowing him (1829).\r\n\r\nFrancisco Morazán of Honduras, the leader of the victorious army, was\r\nproclaimed President of the Federation in 1830. The Guatemala state\r\nauthorities who had been expelled by Arce were reinstated, and Liberal\r\nsupremacy was established by force of arms throughout the Isthmus.\r\nThere were frequent Conservative revolts, however, and even the people\r\nof Salvador, who had played the principal part in Morazán’s triumph,\r\nshowed their former jealousy of domination from Guatemala by turning\r\nagainst him. Their resistance was overcome by force in 1831, but it was\r\nthought politic to transfer the seat of the federal government to San\r\nSalvador. After this, Morazán’s prestige waned rapidly. His efforts\r\nto repress disorder were unavailing, and the Conservatives gradually\r\nregained control of many of the state governments. The last federal\r\ncongress, which adjourned in 1838, declared the states free to govern\r\nthemselves independently; and in 1839, when Morazán’s second term came\r\nto an end, his authority was recognized nowhere outside of Salvador. He\r\nwas expelled from Central America in the following year by an army from\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe breakdown of the federal system was inevitable. Even those\r\nresponsible for the adoption of the constitution of the United States\r\nas a model had little idea how that constitution really worked, and\r\nhad no conception of the spirit of compromise and of mutual respect\r\nfor legal rights which alone made the existence of a government such\r\nas they wished to establish possible. Many of the state governors\r\nrefused to obey the federal officials, and were overthrown by the\r\nlatter and replaced by adherents of the faction in power in the\r\ncapital. The Congress, attempting to tie the hands of the executive,\r\nwas reduced to impotence by the use of the army. The President himself\r\nsuccumbed before the end of his term to a revolution in which all of\r\nthe disaffected elements took part. Even a better organized government\r\nwould probably have been unable long to maintain order in a country\r\nwhere distances were so great, means of communication so inadequate,\r\nand sectional jealousies so intense as in Central America.\r\n\r\nEqually inevitable was the breakdown of the democratic institutions\r\nwhich the leaders of the constituent assembly had sought to create.\r\nThe elections soon became a farce because of the ignorance and\r\nindifference of the great mass of the people. The history of the\r\nCentral Americans had never taught them respect for the will of the\r\nmajority, and there was consequently little inclination from the first\r\nto accept an unsatisfactory verdict at the polls in good faith. The\r\nauthorities gradually learned to bring pressure to bear upon the voters\r\nin the interests of the party in power, and as time went on assumed\r\na more and more complete control of the balloting, until candidates\r\nopposed by the government ceased to have any chance of success. At\r\nthe same time the members of the opposition party were restrained or\r\nexpelled from the country, to prevent their intriguing or revolting\r\nagainst the government. Within a few years authority established\r\nand upheld by force was the only authority which was recognized or\r\nrespected, and there was no means of changing the officials in power,\r\nand consequently no recourse against bad government, except revolution.\r\nCivil war had thus become an indispensable part of the political system.\r\n\r\nFor some years after 1839, there was intermittent internal and\r\ninternational strife, with hardly an interval of real peace, in\r\nnearly every state of the Isthmus. Costa Rica alone, because of her\r\npeculiar social conditions, which will be described in a subsequent\r\nchapter, led a comparatively tranquil existence in her isolated valley.\r\nElsewhere the establishment of stable governments seemed impossible.\r\nConflicting ambitions, mutual persecutions, and sectional jealousy,\r\nas well as differences over religious and economic questions, divided\r\nthe political leaders of the community into vindictively hostile\r\nfactions, which had no means of settling their disputes except by an\r\nappeal to arms. The state governments, resting upon the outcome of\r\nrevolutions, had little claim to legality or to the respect of the\r\ncommunity, and they were compelled to maintain their position, where\r\nthey maintained it at all, by force and by tyrannical repression of\r\nattempts to overthrow them. Besides the opposition of disaffected\r\nclasses at home, they faced also the constant danger of intervention by\r\nneighboring state governments which were in the hands of the opposite\r\nparty, for the solidarity created by mutual action in federal affairs\r\nled the Conservatives and Liberals in each state to assist their former\r\nbrothers in arms in other states even after all formal political\r\nconnection had been broken. This solidarity was strengthened by the\r\nambition of a large section of the Liberal party to re-establish the\r\nold federal union by force, under the leadership of the followers\r\nof Morazán, and by the opposition to this plan on the part of the\r\nConservatives.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the period from 1839 to 1871, the\r\nConservatives, under the leadership of the aristocratic-clerical party\r\nin Guatemala, were dominant throughout the Isthmus. The Liberals\r\nsecured control for short terms at different times in Salvador,\r\nHonduras, and Nicaragua, but in almost every case they were overthrown\r\nby the intervention of Rafael Carrera, the President of Guatemala.\r\nThese Conservative governments, although usually controlled by the\r\nwealthiest and most respectable classes in the community, did little\r\nto improve the desperate political and economic situation into which\r\nthe continual civil war had plunged the new republics, partly because\r\nof frequent changes in the personnel of the governments and frequent\r\ndissensions within the ruling class, and partly because of the inherent\r\nweakness of administrations established and upheld by the force of a\r\nforeign government.\r\n\r\nIn 1871-72 the Liberals returned to power as the result of a concerted\r\nmovement in Guatemala, Honduras, and Salvador. This revolution effected\r\nfar more than a mere change of presidents; it marked the destruction of\r\nthe old aristocratic-clerical party as the dominant force in politics.\r\nIn Guatemala, where the Conservative leaders were exiled or imprisoned,\r\nand both the great families and the Church were deprived of a great\r\npart of their property and influence, the old regime has never been\r\nrestored. Its disappearance greatly weakened the position of its allies\r\nin Honduras and Salvador. A very similar though almost bloodless\r\nrevolution occurred in Costa Rica in 1870, when General Tomás Guardia\r\noverthrew the “principal families” which had hitherto controlled the\r\ngovernment. In Nicaragua, where party divisions were based rather on\r\nlocal rivalries than on class distinctions, the change from the old\r\norder to the new was neither so sudden nor so complete, and the Granada\r\naristocracy was able to maintain itself in power until 1893.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative party continued, indeed, to exist as a political\r\nforce, but it was no longer a social group which stood for definite\r\nprinciples and points of view so much as mere organization of\r\nprofessional politicians. The influence of the great families became\r\nless and less, and the leadership in the party was assumed by military\r\nchiefs whose objects and ambitions were little different from those\r\nof their opponents. Since 1871, party lines have tended to disappear,\r\nand it has made little difference in political conditions whether an\r\nadministration was controlled by one faction or the other. In Honduras\r\nand Salvador, in fact, even the party names have almost ceased to\r\nbe used, and in Nicaragua they denote merely the adherents of rival\r\ncities. It is difficult to say how strong the old aristocracy still is\r\nin Guatemala because of the ruthless suppression of all manifestations\r\nof political opinion by the government.\r\n\r\nSince 1871, the republics of the Isthmus have been governed for the\r\nmost part by strong, absolute rulers, who have concentrated all power\r\nin their own hands and who have on the whole been more successful in\r\nmaintaining order than the frequently changing and less centralized\r\nadministrations controlled by the Conservative oligarchy. Revolutions\r\nand revolts still occur, but they are less often victorious than\r\nformerly, for the relative power of the government has greatly\r\nincreased. The agricultural development of recent years has made\r\nthe wealthy classes, who have capital invested in coffee and sugar\r\nplantations, inclined to frown on attempts to plunge the country into\r\ncivil war; and the improvement and the increased cost of artillery\r\nand other military material have made it more difficult to equip a\r\nrevolution strong enough to overcome the regular army. Individual\r\npresidents, supported by strong military forces, have thus been able to\r\nhold the supreme authority for long terms of years, and to establish\r\nhighly centralized, comparatively efficient administrations, which\r\nhave done much to encourage the development of the country. Whatever\r\nmay be the disadvantages of the exercise of irresponsible power by one\r\nman, there can be no doubt that the Central American countries have\r\nmade more progress under governments of this kind than they did under\r\nthe constantly changing administrations of their early history, which\r\nhad neither the prestige nor the military power necessary to maintain\r\norder. Until the other departments, and especially the legislatures,\r\nhad been reduced to subjection by the executive, the action of the\r\nlatter was often almost completely paralyzed, and more than one\r\npresident was forced to resign by petty disputes arising purely from\r\npersonal jealousy. Under such conditions it was of course impossible to\r\npursue any definite and coherent policy.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Central American governments at the present time\r\nare republican only on paper, although the forms of the various\r\nconstitutions are still observed. Elections are held regularly in all\r\nof the five republics, but they are controlled by the administration,\r\nwhich almost invariably secures the triumph of the official ticket.\r\nThe extent to which this control is exercised varies with the\r\ncharacter and the strength of the President. In most cases, opposition\r\ncandidacies are simply not permitted, and anyone engaging in propaganda\r\nunfavorable to the government’s party is severely dealt with. At\r\nother times, only known adherents of the President are allowed to cast\r\ntheir votes, and the ballots, if necessary, are fraudulently counted.\r\nEven in Costa Rica, where comparative freedom prevails, the citizens\r\nare sometimes intimidated or coerced, and the authorities are able to\r\nbring pressure to bear in many ways, by promises of favors or by petty\r\npersecutions. Such practices are made easier by the fact that the\r\nvoting is open and public, as the Australian ballot is unknown. One\r\nor two real elections, in which the government has not desired or has\r\nnot dared to impose its will on the country, have been held in each of\r\nthe five republics, but they have usually not been participated in by\r\na large part of the people outside of the cities, and they are looked\r\nback upon for generations as events far out of the ordinary. As a rule\r\nchanges in the presidency come about only when the chief magistrate\r\nvoluntarily relinquishes his office to a member of his own party, or\r\nwhen the opposition is victorious in a civil war.\r\n\r\nSo long as he can maintain himself in office and suppress revolts\r\nagainst his authority, a Central American president is an absolute\r\nruler, who dominates all other departments of the government. He\r\nappoints and removes every administrative official, and through his\r\nministers directly supervises every branch of the public service. The\r\nrevenues are collected and expended under his orders with a more or\r\nless perfunctory regard for the budget voted by the legislature, and\r\nwith little pretense of making an accounting for them. He not only\r\nexecutes, but also makes and unmakes the laws, either through his\r\ncontrol of the Congress, or simply by executive decree. The army and\r\nthe police are under his absolute command. Even the courts usually\r\ndecide the more important cases which come before them in accordance\r\nwith his wishes. His power is curbed only by the fear of losing the\r\nsupport of his followers or of being overthrown by a popular revolt,\r\nand neither of these dangers is ordinarily very great so long as he\r\nretains the loyalty of his friends by gifts of offices and money, and\r\nprevents political agitation by an effective use of the army and police.\r\n\r\nThe national legislatures, in spite of the constitutional provisions\r\naiming to make them independent and co-ordinate departments of the\r\ngovernment, have in practice little authority of their own. Except\r\nin Nicaragua, where the bi-cameral system now prevails, each of\r\nthe republics has a Congress of one chamber. The members of these\r\nare theoretically elected by the people for a term of two or four\r\nyears, but they are in reality chosen by the administration like\r\nother officials, and are therefore little more than a mouthpiece of\r\nthe president. Any attempt on the part of the Congress to oppose\r\nthe wishes of the executive, in fact, is discouraged by the use of\r\nforce or by minor persecutions, such as the withholding of salaries\r\nor the molestation of the delegates by the police. Not infrequently\r\ndifferences of opinion arise in regard to matters of little\r\nsignificance, but in matters of serious importance the Congress rarely\r\nattempts to assert its own will.\r\n\r\nWith the judicial department, the case is much the same. The Supreme\r\nCourt, elected for a fixed term either by the Congress or by the\r\npeople, usually appoints and removes all minor judges and judicial\r\nemployees. This system has worked well in Costa Rica, where the\r\ntribunals are generally independent and honest, but in the other\r\nrepublics political considerations are apt to play a large part\r\nnot only in the selection of judges but in the decision of cases.\r\nThe courts are subjected to much the same kind of pressure as the\r\nlegislature, and there are few of them which would dare to oppose\r\nthemselves to the expressed wishes of the president. They therefore do\r\nlittle or nothing to protect private citizens against abuses of power\r\nby the executive authorities or by the minor officials.\r\n\r\nThe president is assisted by ministers whom he appoints and who are\r\nresponsible to him alone. The most important portfolios are those for\r\nWar, Public Works, Finance and Public Credit, and Government. The\r\nminor departments--Justice, Public Instruction, Charities, etc.--are\r\ngenerally placed in charge of subsecretaries. The heads of the\r\ndepartments are rarely more than advisors and aids to the president,\r\nwho directs their policy and passes on practically all of their acts.\r\nThey have no independent authority, and as a rule no real influence\r\nover the conduct of affairs when the chief executive is a man of strong\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe local administration is under the direction of the Department\r\nof Government, which has a representative subject to the orders\r\nof the minister, and through him responsible to the president, in\r\nevery town and village throughout the country. Each republic is\r\ndivided into from seven to twenty-three departments, under governors\r\nwho are at the same time military commanders, “_jefes políticos y\r\ncomandantes de armas_.”[7] These officials, who are appointed by\r\nthe president, enforce the laws, collect the taxes, and control\r\nthe expenditure of government funds in their jurisdictions, and\r\nfor these purposes have under their orders practically all of the\r\nsubordinate national authorities. The departments are subdivided into\r\n“municipalities”--districts which include a town or village with\r\nthe surrounding country--where the central authority is represented\r\nby a minor official commonly called _comandante_,[8] who commands a\r\nfew soldiers and is intrusted with the duty of maintaining order and\r\nenforcing the laws. These departmental and local authorities are too\r\nfrequently petty tyrants, who show little respect for the private\r\nrights or the property of the inhabitants of the districts under their\r\njurisdiction. As they are subject to little real restraint in their\r\nown sphere of action, they are able to exploit the people of the lower\r\nclasses practically as they please, and even persons of wealth and\r\nsocial position are not free from their persecutions unless they can\r\nprotect themselves by the exercise of political influence. Redress\r\nagainst abuses of power is difficult to secure, because the courts\r\nusually cannot or dare not interfere, and the higher authorities, more\r\nconcerned with the loyalty than with the official virtue of their\r\nsubordinates, take little interest in protecting the rights of common\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIn each municipal district, there is a local government, or\r\n_municipalidad_, consisting of one or more _alcaldes_, or executive\r\nofficers, and a board of _regidores_, or aldermen. This body, which has\r\nwide jurisdiction over matters of purely local interest, such as the\r\nrepairing and lighting of streets, the building of roads and bridges,\r\nand the enforcement of sanitary regulations, is elected by popular\r\nvote and is theoretically independent of the local representatives\r\nof the department of government. In practice, however, the latter\r\ndominate its actions, and prevent the _alcaldes_ from carrying\r\nout any action of which they do not approve. The members of the\r\n_municipalidad_ themselves, moreover, are in most places nominated by\r\nthe central government, which controls their election as it does that\r\nof other officials. In any event they are prevented from playing a\r\nvery prominent part in the promotion of local interests by the lack\r\nof funds. Their revenues, which are derived mainly from taxes on\r\nbusiness establishments and fees for water and other public services,\r\nrarely suffice to carry out any very important improvements, and their\r\ncredit is very poor. As a result, the central government is forced to\r\nconstruct and administer all of the more expensive public works, and to\r\nexercise many of the other functions which are assigned to the local\r\nboards by law.\r\n\r\nIt can be readily seen that in a political organization such as has\r\njust been described the character of the administration will depend\r\nalmost entirely upon the capacity and disposition of the man at its\r\nhead. An able president, in a Caribbean Republic, exercises an absolute\r\npower for which it would be difficult to find a parallel anywhere\r\nin the civilized world.[9] He is not restrained, like the absolute\r\nmonarchs of Europe and Asia, by dynastic traditions or religious\r\nconsiderations, and he has little need to consider public opinion so\r\nlong as he retains the good will of the army and of the office holders\r\nwho owe their positions to him. He can often re-elect himself for term\r\nafter term, and he is responsible to no one for the exercise of his\r\nauthority or for his management of the public revenues. The country is\r\nso small that he can, and does, extend his control to matters of minor\r\nand purely local importance, even interfering with his fellow-citizens’\r\npersonal affairs and family relations, without regard for the most\r\nsacred rights of the individual. It is in his power to exile, imprison,\r\nor put to death his enemies, and to confiscate their property, while at\r\nthe same time he can enrich and advance his friends. The ever-present\r\npossibility of revolution, it is true, prevents too great an abuse of\r\npower in some of the more enlightened republics, but in the others\r\ncenturies of misgovernment and of the oppression of one class by\r\nanother have done away with respect for individual rights to such\r\nan extent that the cruelest and most arbitrary rulers are tolerated\r\nbecause the people feel that they would only risk their lives and\r\nproperty, without improving their condition, by revolt.\r\n\r\nOnly an exceptionally able man, however, can exercise such despotic\r\npower for a long period. A chief executive of less force of character\r\nwill generally find it impossible to maintain his position or will\r\nbe dominated by his political associates. Often a military leader or\r\na powerful minister is the real ruler. It is frequently said that a\r\nstrong, autocratic government is that which is best suited to the\r\npeculiar conditions of tropical America, because it affords the\r\ngreatest security to agriculture and commerce and the best protection\r\nto foreign investments. Many Central American presidents, however,\r\ninspired by patriotism and by republican ideals, have refused to\r\nexercise dictatorial powers, allowing the other departments of the\r\ngovernment a measure of independence, and relinquishing their offices\r\nto a more or less freely elected successor at the end of their legal\r\nterm. These have not always been so successful in maintaining order\r\nand in carrying out public improvements as their less scrupulous\r\ncontemporaries, because they have been unable to act with the same\r\ndecisiveness and effectiveness which are possible where all authority\r\nis concentrated in the hands of one man; but such administrations at\r\nleast provide an opportunity for the people to gain some experience in\r\nself-government, and make for a more healthy national political life\r\nthan can be found where the expression of opinion in the press and even\r\nin conversation is curbed by a military despotism. When a long-standing\r\nand strongly established dictatorship breaks down, moreover, there is\r\ntoo frequently a period of disorder which destroys all of the advances\r\nmade during years of peace. The entire organization of the government,\r\nbuilt around one commanding figure, goes to pieces when the leader,\r\neither through death or incapacity, is compelled to relax his hold; and\r\nit is very rarely that a new man is at once found who is capable of\r\nkeeping the administrative machine together. In those countries, such\r\nas Costa Rica, where the presidency is a position of less influence\r\nand profit, and where the custom of rotation in office prevails, it is\r\ncomparatively easy to settle the question of the succession peaceably,\r\nin accordance with the law or by an agreement between the political\r\nleaders; but where all parties have been subjected for years to the\r\nautocratic rule of one man, and compelled humbly to obey his commands,\r\nnone of the factional chiefs can tolerate the thought that a personal\r\nrival may succeed to the same position. For this reason, the fall of\r\na Central American dictator is generally followed by a more or less\r\nprolonged civil war, which only ends when one group of men succeed in\r\nimposing their will upon the others.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for a single individual, who can rely neither\r\nupon the loyalty due to an hereditary sovereign nor upon the prestige\r\nenjoyed by a chief magistrate chosen by a majority of the people, to\r\nimpose his absolute authority upon the whole nation, were it not for\r\nthe peculiar political conditions existing in Central America. In\r\nall of the five republics, the common people show little hostility\r\nto despotism as such and little disposition to attempt to influence\r\nthe selection or to guide the policy of their rulers. Neither the\r\nilliterate and oppressed Indian _mozo_ of Guatemala nor the prosperous\r\nand conservative _concho_ of Costa Rica has any real conception of\r\nthe meaning or of the possibilities of democratic institutions, and\r\nboth are willing to leave the conduct of political affairs to their\r\nsuperiors. For them, the government, with the forced military service\r\nand the compulsory labor on public works which it demands, is simply\r\na necessary evil, and attempts to change its personnel by civil war\r\narouse more dismay than enthusiasm. Few among the lower classes enter\r\ninto revolutionary uprisings voluntarily. The upper classes, on the\r\nother hand, are interested in politics not so much for the sake of\r\nprinciples or policies, as because they wish to secure a share of\r\nthe offices and spoils which provide many of them with a comfortable\r\nliving at the expense of the rest of the community. There are among\r\nthem many professional politicians and military leaders who have no\r\nother lucrative occupation, and the number of these has been swelled\r\nconsiderably in recent years by the fact that the commerce and to a\r\nless extent the large scale agriculture of the five republics have\r\nfallen under the control of foreigners, leaving many formerly wealthy\r\nnative families impoverished. By the use of offices and money,\r\ntherefore, the government can always secure adherents and build up a\r\nstrong following, the members of which are deeply interested in its\r\nremaining in power because their positions depend upon it. It is upon\r\na political organization of this kind, and upon the army, that the\r\npresident must rely for holding in subjection his personal enemies and\r\nthe mass of the ignorant and indifferent common people.\r\n\r\nThe military force is the chief support of the government. The highest\r\nofficers in this are usually influential and trusted members of the\r\npresident’s party, for the very existence of the administration\r\ndepends upon their loyalty. The standing army itself is composed of a\r\nfew thousands of ragged, barefooted conscripts of the most ignorant\r\ntype, commanded by professional soldiers of little education or social\r\nposition, who have in many cases risen from the ranks themselves.\r\nTheoretically every male citizen is liable to military service, but\r\nin practice all but the poorest classes secure exemption in one way\r\nor another. There is little fairness or system in recruiting. When\r\nadditional soldiers are needed, the required number of peasants or\r\nlaborers are simply seized, taken to the _cuartels_, and forced to\r\nenlist for a longer or shorter period, whether they have already\r\nperformed their legal service or not. When news is received that troops\r\nare being raised in a given vicinity, every able-bodied man goes into\r\nhiding; and in certain capitals, one frequently sees small parties of\r\n“volunteers,” bound with rope and under a heavy guard, being brought in\r\nfrom the country to augment the garrison. Since soldiers of this type\r\nthink little for themselves, and follow blindly the commands of their\r\nleaders, it is the latter who really control the army. In spite of\r\nthe immense power which they might exert, however, these officers are\r\nusually merely the tools of the civilian politicians, who secure their\r\nsupport by giving them money and conferring military honors upon them.\r\nAlthough each republic has been governed at times during its history\r\nby men who were professional soldiers, the number of real military\r\ndictators has been surprisingly small.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great historic political parties have disintegrated,\r\nand in some states have disappeared altogether, there is always a\r\nmore or less open and organized opposition to the government, made up\r\nof the rivals of the men in power and of the discontented elements\r\nwhich have not received their share of the offices and spoils. These\r\nfactions, in the main, simply represent personal and local jealousies\r\nand ambitions. Their members are held together by ties of blood and of\r\nfriendship, always potent in a Latin American country, but especially\r\nso in these little republics, whose people have until recently had\r\ncomparatively little intercourse with the outside world and have become\r\nclosely related by continual intermarriage. Enmities between prominent\r\nfamilies become especially bitter in such communities, as does also\r\nthe jealousy between different towns and villages, which, though but a\r\nfew miles apart, have little commercial or social intercourse with one\r\nanother. Questions of national policy, and plans for the development\r\nof the national resources play a small part in political contests. The\r\nprominent leaders are not so much the representatives of theories or\r\ntendencies as men who have won the confidence and loyalty of the people\r\nof their towns and villages, or who are the heads of powerful family\r\nconnections, and the intrigues and the struggles for power between such\r\nmen and their followings are the principal motive of the civil wars\r\nwhich are still so frequent in many of the five republics. The factions\r\nwhich dispute the control of the government in the four northern\r\nrepublics still call themselves Liberals and Conservatives, but there\r\nis at the present time little difference in their policies or in the\r\ncharacter of their membership. They are in reality mere combinations\r\nbetween the ambitious leaders of smaller groups, each of whom is\r\nstriving to advance his own fortunes and those of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe animosities created by former civil wars, however, as well as the\r\nbitterness of the struggles for office at the present time, still\r\nmake the feeling between the different factions very intense. In some\r\nof the republics, each group of men which has secured control of the\r\ngovernment has endeavored to consolidate its power, and to avenge\r\nits members for past injuries at the hands of the party which it has\r\noverthrown, by severe and often utterly unjustifiable treatment of\r\nits defeated enemies. The latter are frequently reduced to a point\r\nwhere they find life in their own country almost intolerable. The\r\nmore influential leaders of the opposition are exiled or imprisoned,\r\nand sometimes deprived of their property by confiscation or forced\r\nloans, and the rank and file of the party are subjected to all of\r\nthe persecutions which the greed or the vindictiveness of the new\r\nauthorities may suggest. Many of the measures taken are really\r\nnecessary, especially when there is danger of a counter revolution; but\r\nthey do much to keep alive a bitter personal hatred between the rival\r\ngroups of politicians. Within the last few years, the realization of\r\nthis fact has led the governments of many of the republics to adopt\r\na more humane and civilized policy, but the customs formed during a\r\ncentury of civil war have made the execution of such a policy very\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the control of the government is seized and held by each\r\nsucceeding administration by force naturally inclines the victorious\r\nparty to treat it as the spoils of war. A sweeping change of employees,\r\nfrom cabinet ministers to janitors, takes place upon the accession\r\nof each new president, and causes a demoralization of the public\r\nservice which can easily be imagined. Not only are inexperienced and\r\ninefficient men given official positions, but the pay roll is loaded\r\ndown with salaries to useless or purely ornamental functionaries,\r\nappointed as a reward for political services. The schools and certain\r\nother governmental activities, such as the telegraphs, are to a\r\nslight extent saved from the general disorganization by the fact that\r\nthe small salaries paid and the special abilities required in them\r\nmake the positions unattractive to the sinecure-hunting professional\r\npoliticians; but even in these, the experienced and faithful employee\r\nhas no chance against the man who has powerful friends.\r\n\r\nFavoritism in appointments is not, however, so grave an evil as the\r\ngraft which is more or less prevalent in the governments of all of the\r\nfive republics. This corruption is due partly to the tendency to regard\r\nofficial positions as the fruits of a temporary victory, from which\r\nas much profit as possible is to be secured while the domination of\r\nthe party in power lasts, and partly to the fact that it is impossible\r\nfor many of the employees to live on their ridiculously inadequate\r\nand often irregularly paid salaries. In some of the countries, where\r\nthere have been long periods of despotic government by one man, who\r\nhas subordinated every other consideration to the maintenance of his\r\npersonal following and the consolidation of his power, conditions are\r\nalmost incredibly bad. From the postal clerk who steals illustrated\r\nreviews out of the mail boxes, to the high official who mysteriously\r\nbecomes the owner of large amounts of property during his tenure of\r\noffice, the servants of the nation rob their fellow-citizens by an\r\ninfinite variety of methods. The President and the ministers derive\r\nprofits from the granting of concessions and contracts; the local\r\nofficials exact tribute from those who depend on them for protection;\r\nand every other employee who has regulations to enforce or favors to\r\ndispense endeavors to secure small sums from those who are affected by\r\nhis performance of his duties. Under these military dictatorships, the\r\nirresponsible authority enjoyed by the officials, and their continual\r\nabuse of their position, result eventually in a deplorable vitiation\r\nof political ideals and official morality among the members of all\r\nparties, for the opponents of such an administration, on coming into\r\npower in their turn, are too often unable to resist the temptation to\r\nfollow the example of their predecessors, and to avenge and indemnify\r\nthemselves for their sufferings at the hands of their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe most harmful corruption is that which exists in the courts.\r\nCases are too often decided with regard only to the influence of\r\nthe persons involved or to the inducements which they hold out, and\r\npolitical considerations play a very large part wherever they arise.\r\nIn some countries, in fact, the President has often intervened openly\r\nin judicial questions, forcing the magistrates to decide them as he\r\ndesired. Where the evidence makes impossible or ridiculous the verdict\r\nwhich the court would like to render, cases are very likely to be held\r\nup indefinitely by the loss of necessary documents, or the decision is\r\npurposely made invalid by allowing technical defects in the procedure.\r\nA magistrate who attempts to perform his work conscientiously\r\nfrequently has his decisions reversed by the upper courts or left\r\nunexecuted by administrative officials, and is himself not unlikely to\r\nbe deprived of his position.\r\n\r\nSuch corruption, however, has reached its extreme development only in a\r\nfew cases, where particularly unscrupulous men have obtained absolute\r\ncontrol of the government. In the majority of the five republics,\r\ngraft flourishes to an alarming extent, but is neither so universal\r\nnor so disastrous to the public morals. Ideas of official virtue are\r\nrather lax among most of the professional politicians, but there are\r\nnevertheless comparatively few who do not show a sincere desire to\r\ncarry out the duties of their offices faithfully and efficiently, even\r\nthough profiting at the same time from their position in ways which an\r\nAnglo-Saxon official would consider illegitimate. In Costa Rica, as\r\nwe shall see, the employees of the government receive fairly adequate\r\nsalaries, which under normal conditions are regularly paid, and, in\r\nconsequence perhaps of this fact, perform their duties as honestly\r\nand efficiently as the officials of the average North American state.\r\nIn each of the other governments, there are officials whose integrity\r\nis above suspicion. These, however, are the exception rather than the\r\nrule, and graft will apparently always be one of the most salient\r\ncharacteristics of Central American administration so long as the moral\r\nstandards and political conditions of the Isthmus remain what they are.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the criminal laws is usually lax and sometimes\r\ncorrupt. The members of the upper classes can generally evade\r\npunishment, or at least escape with light penalties, even when\r\nthey have committed a serious offense, provided the offense be not\r\npolitical. There is none of the five countries in which atrocious\r\nmurders have not been committed with impunity, and frauds of a\r\ndisgraceful character carried out without fear of justice, by persons\r\nof social prominence, within very recent years. Where the lower classes\r\nare involved, the laws are enforced rather more severely, but in an\r\nirregular manner, and criminals frequently escape punishment through\r\nthe venality or the carelessness of the courts or of their jailers,\r\nwhen there are no special circumstances to make the government anxious\r\nto hold them. Those who are convicted and sentenced are usually\r\nemployed under a heavy guard on public works, and receive in return\r\nfor their labor a small amount of money with which they can buy food.\r\nThe death penalty is very rarely enforced for any non-political crime,\r\nalthough it is said that it is the custom of the military officials in\r\nsome of the countries to shoot suspects at the time of their arrest, in\r\norder to avoid the trouble and expense of trying them. Notwithstanding\r\nthe inactivity of the officials, however, there is not a large amount\r\nof brigandage in Central America, and deeds of personal violence, if\r\nwe except the bloody encounters which occur every Sunday under the\r\ninfluence of _aguardiente_, are comparatively few. The people seem to\r\nbe peaceable and law-abiding by nature, even in places where there is\r\nno organized force to hold criminals in check.\r\n\r\nThe worst features of the Central American governments are due chiefly\r\nto the fact that the officials are subject to so little control by\r\npublic opinion. Those who benefit by the acts of the administration\r\nsupport it whatever its defects, while those who do not, oppose it\r\nregardless of its merits. The sentiment of the ruling class as a\r\nwhole may influence the government in non-political matters, but in\r\ntaking measures to strengthen their own position the president and his\r\nadvisors are rarely deterred by considerations of legality, popularity,\r\nor morality. An administration does not weaken itself so much by the\r\nviolation of rights guaranteed by the constitution as by failing to\r\nprovide offices and other rewards for its own supporters. The press, as\r\na means for shaping public opinion, has little political importance,\r\nfor even in those countries where it is not subject to a close\r\ncensorship, the majority of the newspapers are too partisan or too\r\nvenal to command general respect.\r\n\r\nThe only remedy against bad government is revolution. This,\r\nunfortunately, almost invariably proves worse than the evil which it\r\nseeks to cure. The civil wars of the last ninety-six years have wrought\r\nincalculable harm in all of the five republics except Costa Rica, not\r\nonly by the destruction of lives and property, but by making force the\r\nonly basis of authority, and by placing men of military ability rather\r\nthan constructive statesmen in positions of power. The numerous Central\r\nAmerican patriots who have worked with all their will and energy for\r\nthe establishment of efficient administration and the economic progress\r\nof their countries have found their efforts nullified by the continual\r\ndisorder which has made peaceful evolution impossible. Time after time,\r\nby an outbreak of civil war, all classes of the population have been\r\nforced to suspend their regular occupations, and crops, livestock, and\r\nother property have been carried off for provisions or for loot. Under\r\nsuch conditions there is little incentive for the natives to develop\r\ntheir agricultural properties or for foreigners to invest money in\r\nrailways or in mines. The resources and energies of the governments,\r\nwasted in maintaining their military supremacy over their enemies,\r\nhave not been available for the construction of the much needed roads\r\nand railways or for the execution of the sanitary measures which are\r\nall but indispensable in a tropical country. As the result of these\r\nconditions some of the republics of the Isthmus have made little\r\nprogress since their declaration of independence, although those which\r\nhave enjoyed comparative peace have advanced rapidly in prosperity and\r\ncivilization. The first requisite for the improvement of the economic\r\nand political conditions of Central America is the substitution of some\r\npeaceful means of changing the personnel of the governments for the\r\ncostly and destructive method of revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] By Peninsular Spaniard is meant a native of European Spain.\r\n\r\n[7] In Costa Rica, the departments are called provinces, and their\r\nadministrative heads, _gobernadores_.\r\n\r\n[8] This is not the official designation, which differs from country\r\nto country. In Guatemala, they are called _comisionado político y\r\ncomandante militar_, in Nicaragua, _agente de policía_, in Costa Rica,\r\n_jefe político_, etc.\r\n\r\n[9] It should be stated that the description of Central American\r\ngovernments in this chapter does not apply in all its details to Costa\r\nRica. In that country, although the written constitution and the\r\nframework of the government are the same as in the other countries,\r\npolitical conditions are, in fact, very different. The President comes\r\ninto office, in most cases at least, by a free election rather than a\r\nrevolution, and exercises a far less absolute power than elsewhere on\r\nthe Isthmus. The peculiar conditions existing in Costa Rica will be\r\ndescribed in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                               GUATEMALA\r\n\r\n Political History--The Government--The Indian Population--The Contract\r\n Labor System--Production of Coffee and Other Crops on the South\r\n Coast--Means of Transportation--Outlying Sections of the Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuatemala is the most important of the five Central American republics.\r\nHer two millions of people form about forty per cent of the entire\r\npopulation of the Isthmus, and her commerce is greater than that of any\r\nof the other four countries. Although in many respects less advanced\r\nthan Costa Rica and Salvador, her wealth and her strongly organized\r\ngovernment, supported by a formidable army, have always enabled her\r\nrulers to play the leading part in the international politics of the\r\nIsthmus, and even to exert a decisive influence in the internal affairs\r\nof her neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Republic live for the most part on the plateaus along\r\nthe Pacific Coast, not far from a chain of lofty volcanic peaks which\r\nfringe the interior tableland on the south, and on their farther side\r\nslope abruptly down to the low coastal plain. Of the many populous\r\ntowns in this region, by far the greater number were prosperous\r\nand rather highly civilized communities centuries before Columbus\r\ndiscovered America. They are still inhabited mainly by Indians,\r\nalthough in each place there is now an upper class of white merchants,\r\nplanters, and professional men.\r\n\r\nFor several years after the declaration of independence, the history\r\nof Guatemala, as we have seen, was closely connected with that of the\r\nfederal government. The Liberal state administration, which Morazán had\r\ninstalled, maintained itself in office until 1838. It was overthrown\r\nby a revolt among the bigoted and ignorant _ladinos_ east of the\r\ncapital, who were persuaded by the priests that an outbreak of cholera\r\nin the preceding year was due to the poisoning of the rivers by the\r\nauthorities. The Liberals retired to the western city of Quezaltenango,\r\nwhere they attempted to set up an independent state, but they were\r\ncompletely defeated by the Conservative army in 1840. Rafael Carrera,\r\na half-breed peasant who had led the popular uprising, was for a\r\ngeneration the most powerful personage of Central America. Becoming\r\npresident in 1844, he retained this office during the greater part of\r\nthe period from then until his death in 1865, although the difficulties\r\narising from renewed Liberal revolts caused him to resign twice for\r\nshort intervals. In 1854, he was made president for life. Carrera was\r\nan absolute despot, fond of the trappings of supreme power, but in\r\npolitical matters somewhat subject to the control of the leaders of the\r\nConservative party and the ecclesiastical authorities. The policy of\r\nhis government was therefore shaped by the great families and by the\r\nChurch, and the more liberal and progressive elements in the community\r\nwere not allowed to express their opinions or to take part in public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the early acts of the Conservative administration was the\r\nrepudiation of the federal union. The wealthy classes of the capital\r\nhad suffered so much from the disturbances attending that ill-starred\r\nexperiment, and had been put to so much expense in organizing\r\nexpeditions to uphold the authority of the federation in the other\r\nstates and in defending the central authorities against attacks from\r\noutside, that it is not surprising that they preferred to sever all\r\nconnection with their turbulent neighbors. During their entire tenure\r\nof power, it was their policy to discourage the restoration of the\r\nunion, not only by refusing to accede to any proposals tending to this\r\nend, but also by intervening by intrigue and even by force in the\r\ninternal affairs of their neighbors when the plans of the unionist\r\nparty could not be frustrated in any other way.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Carrera, and during the administration of Vicente\r\nCerna, his successor, the Liberals renewed their activities in\r\nopposition to the government, and finally succeeded in 1871 in\r\noverthrowing it by revolution. The first president under the new regime\r\nwas Miguel García Granados. He was succeeded in 1873 by the real leader\r\nof the party, General Justo Rufino Barrios, under whose masterful\r\nleadership the Conservatives were completely crushed. The religious\r\norders, which had been very powerful, were expelled from the country\r\nand deprived of their property, and a similar fate overtook the heads\r\nof the old aristocratic families. Liberal reforms of all kinds were\r\nintroduced in theory if not always in practice, and provision was made\r\nfor the building of railways, the encouragement of agriculture, and the\r\nestablishment of schools. Barrios’ great ambition was the restoration\r\nof the Central American union, but his efforts to secure the\r\nco-operation of the other governments of the Isthmus for this purpose\r\nmet with little success. It was in an attempt to accomplish this object\r\nby force that he met his death, for he was killed in a battle against\r\nthe army of Salvador in 1885.\r\n\r\nManuel Lisandro Barillas, one of the _designados_, or vice-presidents,\r\nsucceeded Barrios and held office until 1892. At the expiration of\r\nhis term, not having the strength nor the desire to remain in power,\r\nBarillas held the only comparatively free election in the history of\r\nthe Republic, and José María Reyna Barrios, a young nephew of the great\r\nLiberal leader, became President. Although capable and energetic, this\r\nruler was so extravagant in his expenditure of the public revenues that\r\nhis death by assassination in 1898 left the Republic in a very serious\r\nfinancial condition. This was intensified by the political difficulties\r\nwhich confronted the first _designado_, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, when\r\nthe latter took control of the administration. After a few months of\r\ntension, however, the new chief executive succeeded in establishing the\r\nlegal authority and in overcoming some of the problems confronting the\r\nnational treasury. He is still at the head of the state, after nineteen\r\nyears of service.\r\n\r\nThe dense ignorance and the oppressed condition of the masses of the\r\npeople, combined with the bitter factional strife among the upper\r\nclasses, where party hatred has probably been stronger than in any\r\nof the other Central American countries, have caused the government\r\nof Guatemala to became a military despotism, more absolute than\r\nany other on the Isthmus. The administration firmly maintains its\r\nauthority by means of a large standing army and police force, and\r\npromptly and mercilessly checks the slightest manifestation of popular\r\ndissatisfaction. An elaborate secret service attempts, with a large\r\nmeasure of success, to inform itself fully of everything which occurs\r\nin the Republic. Supposed enemies of the party in power are closely\r\nwatched, through their neighbors, their servants, and even through\r\nthe members of their own families, and foreigners coming to the\r\ncountry often find themselves shadowed until the details of their\r\nbusiness are discovered. It is dangerous to express an opinion on\r\npolitical matters even in private conversation. Much of the mail,\r\nand especially that coming from abroad, is opened and read in the\r\npost office. The formation of social clubs is discouraged because of\r\npossible political results, and it is impossible for a man prominent\r\nin official circles to have many friends without arousing distrust.\r\nPersons who fall under suspicion are imprisoned or restricted in their\r\nliberty, or even mysteriously disappear. The ruthless execution of\r\nlarge numbers of persons, many of whom were probably innocent, have\r\nfollowed attempts to revolt or to assassinate the President. This\r\nreign of terror is approved by many influential natives and by the\r\nmajority of the foreigners in the country on the ground that only a\r\nvery strong government can prevent revolution and maintain order; and\r\nthere is no doubt that the life and property of foreigners, at least,\r\nhas been safer in Guatemala than in some of the other Central American\r\ncountries. The omnipresent spy system, however, and the cruel treatment\r\nmeted out to those who incur the displeasure of the authorities, have\r\ncreated an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and fear, especially in the\r\ncapital, which has noticeably sapped the spirit and the self-respect of\r\nthe people. Patriotism and national pride have to a great extent been\r\ndestroyed by the ban on the discussion of important national questions,\r\nand the country has thus probably become less rather than more fit for\r\nself-government during the last two decades.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presidents, almost without exception, have shown great\r\nforce of character and marked administrative ability, the subordinate\r\nofficials are very frequently inefficient and corrupt. Official\r\nmorality seems to be growing worse rather than better, apparently\r\nas a direct result of the depreciation of the currency, which has\r\nnot been accompanied by a corresponding increase in salaries. The\r\nhighest employees, such as the ministers and the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt, receive the equivalent of about fifty dollars a month, and the\r\nremuneration of minor functionaries varies from one dollar to twenty\r\ndollars. Posts in the government, consequently, have little attraction\r\nexcept for those who desire them because of the opportunities which\r\nthey afford for graft, and respectable persons, who are often appointed\r\nto professorships in the schools or to other positions requiring\r\nspecial knowledge and experience, accept only because they are\r\npractically compelled to. The great majority of the administrative and\r\njudicial officials are men of a rather low type, and bribery, theft,\r\nand oppression are consequently very prevalent. The fact that the\r\nsuperior authorities do not punish or discourage even the most flagrant\r\ncorruption gives rise to the suspicion that they are willing to have\r\ntheir subordinates recompense themselves in this way, in order not to\r\nbe forced to pay them salaries out of the national treasury adequate\r\nfor their support.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the corruption in the government and the exploitation\r\nof the people for the benefit of the official class, there is at least\r\na pretense of public-spirited administration. Humanitarian laws are\r\nput on the statute books and praised in the newspapers; the cities are\r\nbeautified by laying out parks and erecting monuments; magnificent\r\nbuildings for schools, hospitals, and other public institutions\r\nare constructed; and the progressiveness and benevolence of the\r\nadministration are heralded by subsidized writers, not only in Central\r\nAmerica, but even in the United States and Europe. The motives of the\r\ngovernment are no doubt praiseworthy, but the actual good accomplished\r\nhas not been great. The execution of the reforms has been left to\r\nofficials who had no understanding of their spirit and who were in\r\nmany cases deterred by their own interests from carrying out their\r\nprovisions; and the schools and other public institutions have never\r\nbeen properly equipped or provided with adequate teaching staffs\r\nbecause of the failure to appropriate money for these purposes.\r\n\r\nAlthough all power is centered in the hands of one man, the forms of\r\nthe constitution are still observed and elections are held regularly in\r\naccordance with the law. They are, moreover, participated in, not by a\r\nfew chosen voters, as in some other Central American countries, but by\r\nthe entire body of citizens. In a presidential election, especially,\r\nall classes of the population are rounded up by the military and taken\r\nto the polls, where they exercise a right of suffrage restricted\r\nonly by the fact that they are not permitted to vote for any but the\r\nofficial candidates. The number of votes for the re-election of the\r\npresident thus equals, when it does not exceed, the total number of\r\nadult males in the Republic.\r\n\r\nSince the breakdown of the Central American federation, Guatemala\r\nhas suffered from fewer successful revolutions than any other state\r\nof the Isthmus. The Republic has been by no means free from internal\r\ndisorder, but at least it has not been subjected to the continual\r\ndemoralizing changes of regime which have occurred so frequently\r\nin its neighbors. This comparative stability has been in part due\r\nto the strong organization which the government inherited from its\r\nSpanish predecessors. The Captain General and the royal _audiencia_ in\r\nGuatemala City had naturally enjoyed more prestige and had possessed\r\nmore means of making their authority respected than had the subordinate\r\ngovernors in the provinces in colonial days, and the old administrative\r\nmachinery and traditions were maintained to some extent after the\r\ndeclaration of independence. Moreover, the country has had a series of\r\nable rulers, holding office generally for life, who have crushed all\r\nopposition with little regard for constitutional provisions or public\r\nopinion, and who have almost always been able to defeat attempts at\r\nrevolution and to arrange for the succession of a president of their\r\nown choosing. There are, of course, turbulent elements which make\r\noccasional attempts to overthrow the government, but their influence\r\nhas been much less than in Honduras, Nicaragua, or Salvador because of\r\nGuatemala’s racial and economic conditions.\r\n\r\nAmong the upper classes, although they are divided among themselves by\r\nbitter political feuds, and although there are many powerful families\r\nwhich have suffered indescribable outrages at the hands of governments\r\nof opposite political faith, the revolutionary spirit seems at present\r\nto be conspicuously absent. The majority of the white families who own\r\nplantations upon which they employ Indian labor are more interested\r\nin the maintenance of peace than in obtaining offices for themselves\r\nby a revolt which would cause their workmen to be recruited into the\r\narmy and would perhaps lead to the destruction of their properties.\r\nThe difficulty of overthrowing the government, with its large standing\r\narmy and its superior military equipment, and the terrible consequences\r\nwhich follow an unsuccessful attempt to do so, deter those who have\r\nanything to lose from engaging in political agitation.\r\n\r\nThe half-breed middle class, which is usually a cause of disturbance\r\nin the neighboring republics, plays but a small part in politics.\r\nThe _ladinos_, as they are called, occupy an economic and social\r\nposition between that of the Indian laboring population and the landed\r\nproprietors, being employed as artisans, small tradesmen, and minor\r\npublic officials in the towns, and as carpenters, mule drivers, and\r\nskilled laborers in the country. In the districts east of the capital,\r\nwhere there are few full-blooded Indians, the _ladinos_ work on the\r\nplantations or on their own small patches of ground. Many of the\r\nmore intelligent rise from humble origins to high positions, but the\r\nmajority are ignorant, dishonest, and vicious, and form one of the\r\nleast desirable elements in the community. Their importance, however,\r\nis small, as compared with that of the other classes.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the inhabitants of the Republic are docile and\r\nignorant pure-blooded Indians. These have never shown any liking or\r\ncapacity for war since the first small force of Spanish invaders\r\nconquered their populous kingdoms at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Political agitators have rarely been able to incite them to\r\nresistance to the authorities, for whom they have a deep-rooted respect\r\nand fear; and for this reason the organization of a revolutionary army\r\namong them is more difficult than among the turbulent half-breeds of\r\nthe other Central American countries. For the government, on the\r\nother hand, they make patient and obedient, if not very intelligent,\r\nsoldiers. Many of them are raised to high military offices, for their\r\nlack of interest in political affairs makes them more dependable than\r\nthe white or _ladino_ officials. They are on the whole, therefore, an\r\ninfluence on the side of peace.\r\n\r\nGuatemala is the only one of the Central American countries where\r\nthe aboriginal population still maintains its identity as a distinct\r\nrace. In other parts of the Isthmus the Indians were exterminated by\r\nthousands during the first century of Spanish rule, and those who\r\nsurvived were assimilated into the European communities to such an\r\nextent that they adopted the language and customs of their conquerors\r\neverywhere except in a few outlying districts. In Guatemala this did\r\nnot take place, partly because the population was more compact and more\r\ncivilized at the time of the conquest, and partly because the natives\r\nreceived more protection in their rights from the Spanish authorities\r\nin the capital than in the provinces. The Indians were of course\r\nsubjected to the _encomienda_ system just as were those of Honduras and\r\nNicaragua, but the _repartimientos_ worked less harm among them than\r\nin those countries because their great number made the exploitation of\r\nthe whole population by the small groups of Spaniards impossible. The\r\nIndians are still sharply set apart as a class from the half-breed and\r\nwhite population. In many places they are almost entirely unacquainted\r\nwith Spanish, although their native languages, of which it is said\r\nthat there are nineteen spoken in the Republic, are becoming more and\r\nmore contaminated by Castilian words and phrases. The inhabitants\r\nof each village still maintain the distinctive costumes and in some\r\nplaces retain traces of the religious observances of pre-Spanish days;\r\nand wherever they have been left to themselves they still carry on\r\nagriculture and their primitive household industries in much the same\r\nway as before the conquest.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Indians to assimilate with the white population\r\ncaused them to remain in the position of a subject race. Even after the\r\nabolition of the _encomiendas_ they were still compelled to labor for\r\nlittle or no remuneration on the plantations of the white landowners,\r\nfor it became the practice for the authorities to recruit a number\r\nof them by force and to send them anywhere where their services were\r\nneeded, either as a special favor to the beneficiary or for a money\r\nconsideration paid into the treasury. These _mandamientos_, as they\r\nwere called, were the chief means by which agricultural laborers were\r\nsecured until nearly the end of the nineteenth century. After the\r\nestablishment of the large coffee plantations, however, they were found\r\nto be entirely inadequate for providing the large and regular supply of\r\nlabor which was necessary for the new industry, and the system has been\r\nto a great extent superseded, although not entirely done away with by\r\nthe present _Ley de Trabajadores_, enacted in 1894.\r\n\r\nThis law defines two classes of laborers or _mozos_: _colonos_, who\r\nreside permanently on the plantation, and _jornaleros_, who sell\r\ntheir services for a longer or shorter period by contract. The former\r\nusually work for the employer only a part of each month in return for\r\nthe land which he allows them to cultivate. This system is most common\r\nin the Alta Verapaz, where the plantations have great amounts of land\r\nunsuitable for coffee cultivation, and where the Indians, who until\r\na short time ago had lived a life of complete freedom in the forest,\r\nare less amenable to control than on the South Coast. The laborers\r\nthere are for the most part natives who lived upon the land before it\r\nwas purchased by the present owner, and who had no recourse, after\r\nthe establishment of the plantation, but to accept their new status\r\nor to leave their homes. They are on the whole better off than the\r\n_jornaleros_ because they enjoy more independence and are able to work\r\npart of the time for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe _jornaleros_, or day laborers, are held on the plantations under a\r\npeonage system. Theoretically the Indian is perfectly free to contract\r\nhimself or not as he pleases, but when he has once done so, he may\r\nnot leave his employer’s service until he has completed the time for\r\nwhich he agreed to work and has repaid any money which the _patron_\r\nmay have lent him. If he attempts to escape, he is hunted down by the\r\nauthorities and returned to the plantation; and the entire expense of\r\ncapturing him and bringing him back is debited in his account. If, on\r\nthe other hand, he refuses to work, he may be imprisoned until he is\r\nin a more reasonable frame of mind. Those who still prove obstinate,\r\nafter fifteen days in jail, may be sent at the request of the employer\r\nto the convict labor squads, where fifty per cent of the returns of\r\ntheir labor are set aside for the benefit of their creditors. The whole\r\nsystem depends upon keeping the _mozo_ in debt. For this purpose, he\r\nis allowed a limited amount of credit at the plantation store and is\r\neven loaned small sums of money from time to time if necessary. Few are\r\nsufficiently energetic or ambitious to make a serious effort to free\r\nthemselves from these obligations. They have in fact little incentive\r\nto do so, for those who leave the plantation can only look forward to\r\nsimilar employment elsewhere, or what is much worse, to impressment\r\ninto the army, from which _mozos_ working on large coffee, sugar-cane,\r\nbanana, or cacao plantations are legally exempt.\r\n\r\nThe law imposes on the employers certain obligations which are more or\r\nless faithfully observed. In most cases, huts are provided for _mozos_\r\nof both classes, and food is dealt out to them when the supplies of\r\nfood which they themselves raise are exhausted. The _jornaleros_, in\r\nfact, are fed almost entirely by their employers, although they are\r\nfrequently given small patches of ground for gardens and are allowed\r\nthree or four weeks during the year in which to cultivate them. The\r\nplanter distributes medicines and even furnishes amateur medical advice\r\nwhen it is needed. Free schools, required on all by law, are maintained\r\non some plantations, although as a rule they are attended only by\r\nthe children of the _ladino_ employees, for the Indians do not care\r\nabout educating their children and are generally not compelled to do\r\nso. The owner of the plantation is responsible for the maintenance of\r\norder, and is empowered to imprison criminals and fugitives from labor\r\nuntil the local authorities can take charge of them. In these duties\r\nhe is assisted on the larger plantations by an _alcalde auxiliar_, an\r\nofficial appointed by the municipal _alcalde_ from a list of names\r\nsubmitted by the owner. This functionary, who nominally represents\r\nthe authority of the government, but is in reality an employee of the\r\nplanter, is an invaluable aid to the latter in maintaining his control\r\nover the laborers.\r\n\r\nThe wages paid to laborers are at the present time extremely low,\r\nfor they have risen little in spite of the rapid depreciation of\r\nthe national currency. The _jornalero_ or _colono_ on the average\r\nplantation, in addition to a limited amount of very simple food,\r\nreceives from two to three _pesos_ (from five to eight cents in United\r\nStates currency) a day, whereas voluntary laborers, upon whom the\r\nplanter has no hold, receive from five to seven _pesos_ for precisely\r\nthe same work. It is customary in most places to pay by the task, so\r\nthat those who are most efficient may earn slightly more than this sum,\r\nwhile those who are weak or incapable will receive less. Considering\r\nthat the Indian enters the service of the planter owing the fifty or\r\none hundred _pesos_ which it is customary to advance to him when he is\r\ncontracted, it is not surprising that he is unable to free himself\r\nfrom debt, especially as the few articles which he must buy--clothes,\r\ntools, and candles for the church or chapel--are relatively very\r\nexpensive. The combined earnings of the whole family, for the women and\r\nchildren are usually given tasks as well as the men, are in fact hardly\r\nsufficient to supply the necessities of life without an occasional\r\nextra loan from the employer.\r\n\r\nThis peonage system, in itself pernicious, is subject to the gravest\r\nabuses. The short-sighted and improvident Indians are easily persuaded\r\nto accept advances of money when they have some immediate occasion,\r\nsuch as a baptism or a funeral, for spending it, without realizing\r\napparently the onerous conditions under which they must make repayment.\r\nThe professional _habilitadores_, or contractors of labor, and the\r\nagents whom many of the planters maintain in the native villages, take\r\nadvantage of this fact and of the other weaknesses of the Indians’\r\ncharacter to obtain a hold upon them. This is made much easier by the\r\naborigines’ fondness for liquor and by their helplessness when drunk.\r\nThe Indians are often induced to sign contracts by misrepresentations\r\nor even actual violence, for the corrupt and unscrupulous local\r\nauthorities not infrequently bring pressure to bear upon them by\r\nthreats of arbitrary imprisonment or of impressment into the army. Many\r\nof the representatives of the government derive a large income from\r\nconsiderations paid them for service of this kind and from tributes\r\nwhich they exact every month or every year from the planters in their\r\ndistricts as the price of official support in disputes with their\r\nlaborers. That the contracts are rarely entered into voluntarily and\r\nwith a full appreciation of their terms is evident from the great\r\ndifference in the wages received by those who work under them and the\r\nwages earned by the so-called voluntary laborers. The government has\r\nmade half-hearted attempts to check the worst features of the system,\r\nbut its decrees enjoining strict respect for personal liberty and\r\nstipulating minimum wages for contracts made in the future have for the\r\nmost part been left unexecuted by the local officials.\r\n\r\nThe contract labor system is defended in Guatemala on the ground\r\nthat the cultivation of coffee, upon which the prosperity and the\r\ncommerce of the country depend, could not be carried on without it.\r\nThe Indian, it is said, would never work for more than a few days in\r\nthe year unless he were compelled to, as he is perfectly contented\r\nwith a few possessions which he can obtain for himself by cultivating\r\na small patch of ground in the woods. The planters complain of a\r\nscarcity of labor even at the present time, and often find it difficult\r\nto cultivate their properties and harvest the crops. This argument\r\nexplains, but hardly justifies, the system. An institution which\r\nsubjects the masses of the people to a degrading bondage, and which\r\nprevents these masses from progressing or becoming more fit for the\r\nself-government which they are nominally supposed to exercise, must\r\nin the long run be extremely harmful to the country as a whole. The\r\ndevelopment of agriculture and commerce, which has been beneficial\r\nchiefly to foreign investors, can hardly be said to be desirable\r\nif it has made social and political conditions within the country\r\nworse. While the Indians are practically serfs, living under the most\r\nprimitive conditions and deprived of any opportunity to better their\r\nposition, it will be impossible to educate them or to raise their\r\nstandard of living.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, no conclusive proof that the Indians would refuse\r\nto work if they were not forced to by the labor laws and the tyranny\r\nof the officials. They naturally do everything they can to escape\r\nemployment under the present conditions, where they receive in return\r\nfor their labor nothing but the bare necessities of life. These they\r\ncould obtain for themselves, almost without working, if they were\r\nleft in their original condition in the forest. There is no reason to\r\nsuppose, however, that they would refuse employment at wages which\r\nwere really worth their while. They are certainly not a more lazy race\r\nthan their half-breed neighbors, and they would doubtless improve\r\ntheir standards of living, which are today no lower than those of the\r\n_ladinos_ in the more backward parts of Honduras and Nicaragua, if\r\nthey were given an opportunity to do so. Nor would the cost of coffee\r\ngrowing be so increased as to make it prohibitive. In Costa Rica and\r\nSalvador, where the wages are from four to eight hundred per cent\r\nhigher than in Guatemala, the planters are prosperous and make large\r\nprofits. Under the present system, the underfed and ill-treated Indians\r\nare unwilling and inefficient workers, and their services involve a\r\ngreat extra expense to the employer in the form of sums to be paid to\r\n_habilitadores_ and local officials in return for aid in contracting\r\nthem. This money would be saved, and the value of the Indians as\r\nlaborers would certainly be greatly increased, if the peonage system\r\nwere done away with and the workers were freely employed at fair wages.\r\n\r\nThere are some thousands of Indians, especially in the less developed\r\nparts of the Republic, who still cultivate their own properties or a\r\nshare in the common lands of their villages, raising not only the corn\r\nand beans with which they feed their families, but also a small surplus\r\nwhich they carry long distances to sell in the markets in the towns.\r\nThey seem to delight in the free life of the mountain trails, where the\r\ntraveler continually passes long lines of them, in their picturesque\r\nlocal costumes, carrying vegetables, home-made cloth, baskets, and\r\ngrass mats--the men with heavy burdens in the peculiar square frames\r\non their backs, and the women with baskets or bundles poised on their\r\nheads. Many of them come to the capital from places several days’\r\njourney distant, camping by the side of the road at night, and reach\r\ntheir destination nearly as quickly as more aristocratic travelers do\r\non mule back. Besides those who market their own products in this way,\r\nthere are large numbers of professional _cargadores_, who spend their\r\nlives on the roads, taking goods from one place to another for hire or\r\nas a commercial speculation. They are said to cover as much as thirty\r\nmiles a day with a load of one hundred pounds, and they form one of the\r\nmost important factors in the internal transportation of the country.\r\n\r\nThese free Indians work only part of the time or not at all on the\r\nplantations. When they do work, it is usually as “volunteers” at the\r\ntime of the harvest. Their number, however, is constantly diminishing.\r\nAs the extension of the coffee plantations has made the demand for\r\nlaborers more and more insistent, it has become increasingly difficult\r\nfor the Indians to escape from the snares of the _habilitadores_ and\r\nthe pressure exerted by the local officials, so that those in the\r\nmore developed agricultural districts have with few exceptions been\r\npersuaded or forced into service on the plantations. Many of the\r\nIndians who lived on the public domain have been forced to work for the\r\nforeigners who purchased from the government the land which they had\r\nformerly cultivated, for it has been the regular practice in some parts\r\nof the country to secure new _mozos_ in this way. Even those who once\r\nowned land of their own have often sold it to their wealthier neighbors.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the situation of the Indians is probably worse than\r\nit was fifty years ago, and it is certainly worse than that of the\r\nlowest classes in the other republics. The development of the peonage\r\nsystem has deprived them of even the small measure of economic and\r\npolitical liberty which they once enjoyed, and by taking them away from\r\ntheir homes has almost entirely destroyed their old community life.\r\nThe native municipalities, which exist side by side with the _ladino_\r\nmunicipal boards in many of the towns, and which formerly managed\r\nthe internal affairs of the native community, have been powerless\r\nto protect the members of the latter from the operations of the\r\n_habilitadores_ and the tyranny of the representatives of the central\r\ngovernment. Many of the Indian villages which once enjoyed a sort of\r\nindependence of their white neighbors are now completely at the mercy\r\nof brutal local officials, who are not content to exact money from the\r\npeople under them by every conceivable pretext, but even make a regular\r\npractice of virtually selling into slavery those who are intrusted to\r\ntheir government.\r\n\r\nTheir own vices, meanwhile, have reduced the native race to a pitiable\r\ncondition in those districts where they have longest been in contact\r\nwith civilization. The cheap and poisonous _aguardiente_, the sale of\r\nwhich is encouraged by the government because of the revenue which it\r\nproduces, is consumed in great quantities by the laboring classes,\r\nand there are drinking places everywhere, not only in the towns and\r\nvillages, but even along the country roads. The liquor is much inferior\r\nto that produced in the other Central American countries, and is sold\r\nat a price equivalent to less than ten cents a quart. Its effects are\r\nappalling. To it are due the greater part of the crimes committed\r\nin the country, for drunkenness makes the usually peaceable Indians\r\nquarrelsome and unruly, and causes Sundays and holidays to be marked\r\neverywhere by a great number of murders and robberies. There is a very\r\nevident degeneration, due to this one vice, among the Indians in the\r\nsouthern part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe coffee plantations, which have within fifty years become the most\r\nimportant enterprises in the country, are for the most part situated on\r\nthe southern slopes of the volcanoes along the Pacific Coast, not far\r\nfrom the populous towns and villages of the interior plateau. They are\r\non the average larger than in the other countries of the Isthmus, and\r\nas a rule have their own cleaning mills. The coffee of Guatemala is the\r\nbest in Central America, with the possible exception of that of Costa\r\nRica, and is hardly excelled in any part of the world. The largest\r\nand best plantations are owned and managed by Germans, who either set\r\nthem out in the first place or acquired them from their former native\r\nowners; and many of those which still belong to citizens of Guatemala\r\nare for all practical purposes under the control of foreign concerns\r\nwhich hold mortgages on them. Not only production, but also marketing,\r\nwhich is mainly in the hands of German export firms, have been highly\r\nsystematized.\r\n\r\nThe production of coffee overshadows all other agricultural enterprises\r\non the South Coast, but there are nevertheless many other crops which\r\ndeserve to be mentioned because of their local importance. In the\r\nplateau above the coffee plantations, not only the typical Central\r\nAmerican foods, like corn and beans, but also many temperate zone\r\nfruits and vegetables, and even wheat, are cultivated successfully.\r\nOn the coastal plain to the South, there are large cattle ranches and\r\ncane plantations, which, in part at least, supply the home demand for\r\nmeat, sugar, and _aguardiente_. Sheep in the highlands, and cotton in\r\nthe lowlands, supply the raw material for the clothes still woven by\r\nthe Indians on hand looms in their huts. There is a regular exchange\r\nof foodstuffs, carried for the most part on the backs of men, between\r\nthe settlements in the plateau and the more tropical districts of\r\nthe coast plain. The traveler cannot fail to be impressed with the\r\ngreat variety of products which differences in the altitude and in\r\nthe distribution of rainfall make possible, for in the markets of the\r\ncapital one can see almost every kind of temperate and tropical zone\r\nfruits and vegetables, brought from one point or another of the steep\r\nslope between the plateau and the coast. Little attempt has been made,\r\nhowever, to cultivate for export any of the valuable native plants,\r\nwith the exception of coffee, or even, in the case of some of them,\r\nto raise enough to supply the local demand. Flour, for instance, is\r\nbrought from the United States in large amounts, although there is no\r\napparent reason why a quantity of wheat sufficient to supply the whole\r\ncountry should not be harvested on the plateaus west of the capital.\r\nCotton also flourishes, but most of the cloth used is imported or\r\nis manufactured in the country from imported yarn. As in the other\r\ncountries of the Isthmus, the production of the one great export has\r\nconsumed the capital and energies of the inhabitants of the Republic\r\nto such an extent that other forms of agriculture have been seriously\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe economic development of the southern part of the country has\r\nbeen greatly accelerated in recent years by the improvement in means\r\nof transportation. The Northern Railway, which connects the capital\r\nand the South Coast with Puerto Barrios on the Caribbean Sea, was\r\ncompleted in 1908 after great expense and many difficulties. Another\r\nroad runs from Guatemala City to the Pacific ports of San José,\r\nChamperico, and Ocós, crossing the southern part of the country to the\r\nMexican frontier, where it is separated by only a few hundred yards\r\nfrom the Pan American Railway of that Republic. With the exception\r\nof the capital, however, most of the important towns still depend\r\nupon more primitive forms of transportation, as they are situated in\r\nthe high plateaus, several miles above the railway line which runs\r\nalong the South Coast. The same is true of the majority of the coffee\r\nplantations. The highways which connect the towns and _fincas_ with the\r\nstations and with each other are chiefly mule paths, although there\r\nare cart roads, and even in some cases carriage and automobile roads,\r\nbetween the largest cities.\r\n\r\nThe railway system is under the control of an American-owned\r\ncorporation which is closely allied to the United Fruit Company.\r\nThe freight rates are high and very inequitable, as they have been\r\narranged with a view to giving Puerto Barrios, which is served by the\r\nFruit Company steamers, every possible advantage over the Pacific\r\nCoast ports, through which a large part of the foreign commerce of the\r\ncountry is still carried on. According to the schedule in force in the\r\nfall of 1915, for example, the company charged $0.70 gold[10] to haul\r\na bag of coffee from the station of Candelaria to Barrios, a distance\r\nof 331 miles; $1.48 from Guatemala City to Barrios, or 196 miles; and\r\n$0.64 from Los Amates to Barrios, which is sixty miles. To the Pacific\r\nports, on the other hand, the rates were proportionately much higher,\r\nfor that from Candelaria to Champerico, twenty-two miles away, was\r\n$0.22, and that for the seventy-five mile haul from Guatemala to San\r\nJosé was $1.00.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the railway company has to a great extent counteracted\r\nthe benefits which the Republic might have received from the opening of\r\nthe Panama Canal, because it has discouraged the shipping of imports\r\nand exports by way of the Pacific Coast. The western departments\r\nhave profited somewhat by receiving lower rates to Barrios, but it\r\nstill costs them more to send their coffee by that route than if\r\nthey had a fair rate to the southern ports. In other parts of the\r\ncountry, the railroad is forced to charge higher rates than would\r\notherwise be necessary, in order to maintain its total revenues. The\r\nloss to the country as a whole from having its commerce deflected\r\nto a more expensive route than that which it would otherwise have\r\ntaken is considerable. Although the Pacific Coast ports are mere open\r\nroadsteads, where the irregular steamship service cannot be compared\r\nwith that provided by the Fruit Company at the safe harbor of Puerto\r\nBarrios, they are nevertheless the logical outlet for the commerce of\r\nthe more populous part of Guatemala, because they are so much nearer\r\nto the coffee plantations. The difference in the ocean freights from\r\nBarrios to New York and from the Pacific ports via Tehuantepec or\r\nPanama to New York--between forty and fifty cents on each one-hundred\r\npound bag of coffee--is not in reality enough to offset the actual cost\r\nof the long railroad haul across the mountains.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is on the South Coast that the great majority of the people\r\nof Guatemala live, there are several other districts of economic\r\nimportance. The exploitation of the natural resources of these has been\r\nleft almost entirely to foreigners. Beyond the arid and unproductive\r\ninterior districts immediately north of the volcanic region, there is\r\nanother coffee belt in the Department of Alta Verapaz, the product of\r\nwhich, known to the trade by the name of the departmental capital,\r\n“Coban,” is of an unusually fine quality. The owners of the plantations\r\nare for the most part Germans. The coffee, which amounts to about ten\r\nper cent of the total exported from the Republic, is shipped from the\r\nport of Livingston, with which the plantations are connected by a short\r\nrailway and a regular line of launches on Lake Izabal and the Rio\r\nDulce. East of the Alta Verapaz, along the lower part of the railway\r\nline from the capital to Puerto Barrios, the United Fruit Company has\r\nestablished a number of banana plantations. These are not so extensive\r\nas those of Costa Rica or Honduras, but they furnish a continually\r\nincreasing export, which is now second in value only to that of coffee.\r\nThe low, unhealthful plain of Peten in the North, which comprises\r\nalmost a third of the area of the Republic, is rich in mahogany,\r\nSpanish cedar, and other valuable trees, but the lack of means of\r\ntransportation and the deadly climate have so far prevented the\r\nincrease of the population there and have discouraged the development\r\nof the natural resources.\r\n\r\nGuatemala has been gifted by nature with a delightful and healthful\r\nclimate and a marvelously fertile soil which ought to make her one of\r\nthe richest countries in tropical America. She can never attain real\r\nprosperity, however, until her rulers make a determined effort to\r\nimprove the situation of the masses of the people by doing away with\r\nthe worst features of her social organization. Among the lower classes,\r\nthe contract labor system and the unrestricted sale of _aguardiente_\r\nare today causing a steady degeneration, which eventually, if not\r\nchecked, will cause the community as a whole to sink farther and\r\nfarther into a condition of semi-barbarism. These evils will be very\r\ndifficult to remedy. Legislative action to secure the independence of\r\nthe Indians will be obstructed by the interest which the ruling classes\r\nhave in the _status quo_, and the education of the laborers to a point\r\nwhere they will be able to protect their own interests will be a matter\r\nof generations and perhaps of centuries. Upon a gradual raising of the\r\nsocial and economic status of the aborigines, however, rather than upon\r\nthe development of agriculture and the exploitation of the natural\r\nresources of the country, the future of Guatemala depends.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] When the expression “gold” is used in regard to sums of money,\r\nUnited States currency is meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                               NICARAGUA\r\n\r\n Points of Resemblance Between Nicaragua, Salvador, and\r\n Honduras--Peculiar Geographical Situation of Nicaragua--Factors\r\n Which Have Caused Disorder There--Rivalry Between Leon and\r\n Granada--History of the Republic--Economic Conditions--Means of\r\n Transportation--Relations with the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicaragua, Salvador, and Honduras strongly resemble one another in many\r\nof their characteristics. They differ from the two other republics of\r\nthe Isthmus in that there has been more mixture of races among their\r\npeople than in those countries. The Indians did not remain a distinct\r\nethnic entity, as in Guatemala, and were not exterminated, as in Costa\r\nRica, but fused with the invaders into a fairly homogeneous half-breed\r\npopulation which adopted the language and religion of the Spaniards\r\nbut in most places retained the Indian ways of living and cultivating\r\nthe soil. The upper classes, especially in Nicaragua and Salvador, are\r\nfor the most part of European ancestry, and the laboring population,\r\nalthough there is but a small part of it which does not also show\r\nan admixture of Spanish blood, is distinctly Indian in features and\r\ncustoms; but only in a few places is there a sharp line between either\r\nof these classes and the half-breed, or _mestizo_, element, which is\r\nperhaps the most numerous of the three. Social distinctions seem to\r\nsome extent to coincide with, but they can hardly be said to depend\r\nupon, racial lines.\r\n\r\nThere is thus more homogeneity in the population and less inequality\r\nbetween the classes than there is in Guatemala. Although the greater\r\npart of the people are laborers on the plantations of the aristocracy\r\nwhich owns all of the best agricultural properties, they are free\r\nlaborers, who receive fair wages and are not compelled to work unless\r\nthey wish to. There is, furthermore, a somewhat wider distribution of\r\nland than in the northern Republic, and the rights of the small farmer\r\nare better protected than are those of the Guatemalan Indian.\r\n\r\nThe government, although in no sense democratic, is nevertheless\r\ndependent to some extent upon public opinion, for the lower classes\r\nare all too prone to revolt and overthrow a president with whom they\r\nare discontented. The political parties are led and directed by a\r\nwealthy and educated minority, but their sanguinary contests with one\r\nanother are usually decided by the support of the common people, and\r\nespecially of the people of the cities. Several causes lead artisans\r\nand laborers who otherwise have no interest in politics to take part\r\nin these civil wars. One of the most important is the rivalry between\r\ndifferent towns and villages, the spirit of _localismo_, and another,\r\nwhich, however, is rapidly becoming less prominent, is the traditional\r\ndivision, based on no real opposition in principles or policy, into\r\n“Conservatives” and “Liberals.” Still a third is the disposition to\r\nbe “against the government,” whatever its merits--a disposition which\r\nis by no means peculiar to the Hispano-Indian race. It is upon these\r\nfactors that the political parties are built up. Each chief endeavors\r\nto secure a following among the artisans and laborers of his district\r\nby cultivating friendly personal relations with them and by playing on\r\ntheir prejudices, and to carry his followers with him in whatever line\r\nof action best suits his personal interests. The groups thus formed\r\nconsequently represent petty prejudices and loyalty to individuals\r\nrather than political principles.\r\n\r\nThe presidents of these countries are therefore less absolute rulers\r\nthan the chief executive of Guatemala usually is. Instead of an easily\r\ncontrolled army of ignorant Indians, who have little disposition to\r\ndo anything but obey the commands of their officers, the government\r\nmust depend on soldiers who, to some extent at any rate, think for\r\nthemselves and take an interest in political affairs. It must not\r\nonly retain the good will of its followers, but it must refrain from\r\narousing hostility in the community at large, where the opposition is\r\nusually too numerous and too well-organized to be rendered harmless by\r\nkilling or exiling its leaders and repressing its agitation. There is\r\nno public opinion sufficiently strong to prevent the party in power\r\nfrom dealing severely with its most conspicuous enemies, or from\r\nmisusing its control of the machinery of the administration for the\r\nbenefit of the officials and their friends, but there is at least an\r\never-present danger of revolution to make it cautious about alienating\r\nthe sympathies of too large a proportion of the people at large.\r\n\r\nRepublican institutions cannot be said to flourish in any of the\r\ncentral republics, but there is a far more hopeful prospect of their\r\neventually becoming a reality there than in Guatemala. It would be\r\nimpossible, among the factious half-breeds of the Nicaraguan towns,\r\nto round up all classes of the population by military action and\r\nlead them to the polls to vote for the president, as was done when\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera was unanimously re-elected in 1916, but it\r\nis not very difficult to control the election by other means. Under\r\nordinary circumstances, there is no chance for any but the official\r\nticket. The opponents of the government, and even those who are\r\nsuspected of being lukewarm in their support of it, are excluded from\r\nthe official lists of voters, with or without a perfunctory excuse,\r\nand opposition candidacies are discouraged by the imprisonment or\r\nthe expulsion from the country of the rival leaders and of their\r\nchief supporters. Fraud and intimidation are generously employed to\r\nincrease the government’s majority. The measures taken are usually\r\nsufficient to secure a result satisfactory to the faction in power,\r\nbut occasionally they are unavailing because the opposition is strong\r\nenough to wring a compromise from the administration or to overthrow it\r\nby revolution. Elections, therefore, are often accompanied by more or\r\nless disorder and uncertainty, and a too violent attempt to impose an\r\nunpopular candidate on the people has not infrequently been followed\r\nby civil war. With the spread of popular education at the present\r\ntime, there are grounds for hoping that elections will in the not very\r\ndistant future become more nearly a real expression of the will of the\r\npeople--a character which they have already assumed in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThe political and economic development of Nicaragua has been determined\r\nby forces similar to, but more marked than, those which have affected\r\nSalvador and Honduras, and a study of her history and institutions will\r\ntherefore make it easier to understand the situation of the other two\r\nrepublics.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has always been an object of interest to the outside world\r\nbecause of her geographical situation. In her territory, the Central\r\nAmerican _Cordillera_ is broken by a depression which extends across\r\nthe Isthmus, forming the basin of the two great lakes and of the San\r\nJuan River, their outlet to the Atlantic. Lake Nicaragua, which is\r\nonly 110 feet higher than the ocean, is separated from the Pacific\r\nby a range of small hills, the lowest passes of which are said to be\r\nbut twenty-five or twenty-six feet above its surface and thus only\r\n135 above that of the sea.[11] At the narrowest place this strip of\r\nland is less than thirteen miles wide. North of Lake Nicaragua, and\r\nconnected with it by a small river, is Lake Managua, between which\r\nand the Pacific there is a distance of about thirty miles across the\r\nlow plain of Leon. In colonial times, the route across the Isthmus\r\nthrough Leon to Granada on Lake Nicaragua, and from thence by water,\r\nwas commonly used for the transportation of products from all parts\r\nof Central America to Spain; and much more recently it was one of the\r\nmost popular ways of reaching California from the East Coast of the\r\nUnited States. It early attracted the attention of those who were\r\ninterested in transisthmian canal projects, and came to be considered\r\nby many as the most practicable route for an interoceanic waterway.\r\nDiplomatic controversies for the control of the proposed canal, and the\r\nmachinations of corporations desiring to secure concessions for its\r\nconstruction, which it would be impossible even to sketch here, have\r\nplayed a large part in the international relations of the Republic,\r\nand at times have not been without effect on her internal political\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nicaragua, more than those of any of the other countries\r\nof the Isthmus, are dwellers in cities. About a fourth of all her\r\ninhabitants live in six important towns in the lake plains.[12] The\r\nSpaniards established their principal settlements in this region at\r\nthe time of the conquest, in spite of the hot climate, in order the\r\nmore easily to hold in subjection and to utilize the labor of the\r\nlarge Indian communities which had long since grown up there because\r\nof the fertility of the soil and the plentiful water supply. The\r\nconcentration of the population in a few centers has intensified all\r\nof the conditions which have worked against peace in Central America,\r\nand has made Nicaragua the most turbulent of the five republics. The\r\ninhabitants of cities, since the beginning of history, have been\r\nmore inclined to disorder and revolt than their brothers in the\r\ncountry, and this is especially true in Central America, because both\r\n_personalismo_ and _localismo_, with all their attendant evils, reach\r\ntheir most complete development in large communities, where the contact\r\nbetween individuals is closer and the number of persons interested in\r\npolitics is greater than in rural districts. The _mestizo_ artisans,\r\nwho are relatively more numerous and more influential in Nicaragua than\r\nanywhere else in the Isthmus, are always ready to drop their work and\r\ntake up arms in the interests of their faction or of their _patron_,\r\nand even the ordinary laborers, in the towns at least, are Liberals or\r\nConservatives, and followers of this or that chief. The common people\r\nare but little interested in the principles involved in the contests\r\nbetween the two great traditional political parties, but they follow\r\ntheir leaders partly from personal devotion and partly because they are\r\nunited to them by the old local hatreds which have kept these parties\r\nalive in Nicaragua after they have become little more than names in\r\nother parts of the Isthmus. This rivalry between different towns\r\nhas caused bloodshed at one time or another in each of the Central\r\nAmerican republics, but in all except Nicaragua it has to a great\r\nextent died out at the present time, because the capitals have become\r\nmore important than any of their rivals, and have drawn to themselves\r\nmany of the wealthier and more influential provincial families. In\r\nNicaragua, neither of the two cities established by the Spaniards at\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century has been able to establish its\r\nsupremacy, and the history of the country from the very beginning has\r\nbeen one long struggle, made more bitter by radical differences in the\r\nideals and interests of their people, for the control of the government\r\nand the direction of the affairs of the nation.\r\n\r\nGranada, at the western end of the Great Lake, has always been\r\nprimarily a commercial center, since the days when it was the chief\r\nport for the trade between Central America and Spain by way of the San\r\nJuan River. Her leading citizens are not only landed proprietors, but\r\nmerchants, who sell goods in person over the counters of their stores.\r\nHer great families form a coherent and powerful group, which has\r\nalways been able, because of its wealth and social prestige, to exert\r\nan influence far out of proportion to its numbers, not only in its\r\nown city but in the country at large. The greater part of the fifteen\r\nor twenty thousand other inhabitants depend upon them as servants or\r\nemployees, for the artisan class is small and relatively unimportant.\r\nThere are few professional men of social prominence and few small\r\nlandholders, for the rural districts roundabout are mostly given over\r\nto large, carelessly managed cattle ranches. The Chamorros, Lacayos,\r\nand Cuadras, with their relatives, have always considered themselves\r\na sort of creole aristocracy, and even in colonial times they were\r\nrestive under the control of the Spanish authorities at Leon. After the\r\ndeclaration of independence, they naturally joined the great families\r\nof Guatemala in the Conservative party, and they have since retained\r\nthe name, if not the principles, of that organization.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal party, on the other hand, has its center in Leon, the\r\ncapital of the province in colonial times, and today, with sixty or\r\nseventy thousand inhabitants, the largest city of the Republic. There,\r\nthe domination of political and social affairs until 1821 by officials\r\nsent over from Spain prevented the rise of a strong creole aristocracy,\r\nand the constant infusion of Spanish blood during colonial times,\r\nas well as the presence of many Peninsular Spaniards even after the\r\ndeclaration of independence, somewhat retarded the changes wrought in\r\nthe white stock in other places by nearly four centuries of life in the\r\ntorrid climate of the lake plains. The people of Leon have always shown\r\nan inclination towards intellectual and professional pursuits which is\r\nnoticeably absent in Granada, and take great pride in their schools\r\nand their university. The most prominent lawyers and physicians of the\r\nRepublic, even in Managua and the other cities, are for the most part\r\n_Leoneses_, just as the majority of the leading native merchants are\r\nrelated to the Granada families. Leon has a large and aggressive body\r\nof artisans and many small landholders, for the wide plain around the\r\ncity is divided into a large number of little properties, worked either\r\nby the owner in person or under his immediate supervision. There are\r\nfew families of great wealth. It was inevitable that such a community\r\nshould take the side of the Liberals in the struggles which marked\r\nthe early years of the Central American federation, for the character\r\nof its population made it radical just as the position of the great\r\nfamilies of Granada made them conservative.\r\n\r\nThe other towns of the Republic, none of which until within recent\r\nyears could compare in wealth or population with either of the two\r\nchief cities, are divided between these in their sympathies. Those\r\nwhich are dependent geographically upon one of the rivals have\r\nnaturally followed it in politics. Others are split within themselves\r\nby feuds between their leading citizens and between different elements\r\nin their population. Since the development of the coffee industry has\r\ncaused a great increase in the importance of Managua, Matagalpa, and\r\nsome of the other towns, these places have of course acquired much\r\npolitical influence, but the various groups among their people have\r\nrather allied themselves to the already existing factions than formed\r\nnew ones of their own. The Conservative and Liberal leaders in Granada\r\nand Leon still dominate the party councils, although their authority is\r\nsometimes questioned by their allies in the newer centers.\r\n\r\nThe jealousy between Granada and Leon found expression in armed\r\nconflict as soon as the authority of the mother country was removed.\r\nAfter the declaration of independence, the Spanish governor in\r\nLeon, like the authorities in many of the other provinces, refused\r\nto recognize the authority of Gainza, while the Granadinos joyfully\r\naccepted the new central government in Guatemala in preference to that\r\nof the mother country. As the result of this situation, an intermittent\r\nwar began which lasted until General Morazán, on becoming president\r\nof the Federation, sent Dionisio de Herrera, as _jefe de estado_, to\r\nrestore order. Under him the Liberal party was firmly intrenched in\r\npower. He was succeeded by a series of _jefes_ of the same faction,\r\nmost of them under the control of a military leader named Casto\r\nFonseca, who was _comandante de armas_. The destruction of the Liberal\r\ngovernments in the other republics, however, made the position of the\r\nauthorities in Nicaragua precarious; and in 1845 their administration\r\nwas overthrown by a Conservative uprising aided by armies from Honduras\r\nand Salvador, which wished to punish Leon for the asylum afforded there\r\nto the defeated followers of Morazán. After sacking the capital and\r\nslaughtering a large part of its inhabitants, the invaders moved the\r\ncapital to Masaya and later to Managua, both small towns near Granada.\r\nA Conservative government, made up of the great families of the latter\r\ncity, endeavored to establish order and repair the damage wrought by\r\nthe civil wars which had continued almost without interruption ever\r\nsince the federal government had grown too weak to maintain peace, but\r\ntheir efforts were of little avail. The new _comandante de armas_,\r\nTrinidad Muñoz, kept the country in a state of continual disturbance,\r\nby intrigue and conspiracy, in order to increase his own influence,\r\nand finally betrayed the party which had placed him in office and used\r\nthe force intrusted to him to bring about the re-establishment of the\r\ncapital at Leon. A new Conservative uprising aided by Honduras and\r\nCosta Rica overthrew him in 1851, and the seat of the government was\r\nagain transferred to Managua. The Conservatives made a sincere effort\r\nto establish harmony between the two parties, but after their attempts\r\nto conciliate their opponents by giving them a place in the cabinet had\r\nproved a failure, they endeavored equally unsuccessfully to maintain\r\norder by severe measures which only made the Liberals the more bitter.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, the people of Leon, under the lead of Máximo Jeréz and\r\nFrancisco Castellón, drove the forces of the government out of their\r\ncity and attacked Granada. The Conservatives, who received timely aid\r\nfrom Guatemala, resisted determinedly. By the end of the year they were\r\napparently gaining the upper hand, when the Liberals, in their attempts\r\nto turn the tide, called in the support of a band of North American\r\nfilibusters. This was the origin of the “National War,” one of the most\r\nremarkable and most romantic events in the history of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1855, William Walker landed at the port of Realejo, with\r\nfifty-seven other adventurers, ostensibly for the purpose of aiding the\r\nLiberal government at Leon, which had invited him to come to Nicaragua,\r\nbut in reality with the intention of obtaining control of the entire\r\ncountry for himself. This he succeeded within a few months in doing.\r\nCarrying his force to San Juan del Sur by sea, he evaded a Conservative\r\narmy sent to attack him there, sailed up the lake to Granada, and on\r\nOctober 13 occupied that city with little resistance. The force of the\r\nConservative leaders was unimpaired, but they feared to attack the\r\nforeigners, who held their families as hostages. Corral, the head of\r\nthe government forces, agreed therefore to a treaty of peace, signed on\r\nOctober 23, by which Patricio Rivas, a moderate Conservative, became\r\npresident, Corral himself secretary of war, and Walker commander of\r\nthe army. The native troops were for the most part disbanded, and the\r\nfilibusters, or the “American Phalanx,” as they called themselves, were\r\npractically the only military force in the Republic.\r\n\r\nWalker desired to establish a coalition government, under his own\r\ncontrol, in which the leaders of both great parties should be\r\nrepresented. This proved impossible, because the native chiefs from the\r\nfirst showed signs of disaffection. Corral was discovered to be holding\r\ntreasonable correspondence with the presidents of the other Central\r\nAmerican republics, and was shot only a short time after the signature\r\nof the treaty of peace. Rivas, the new president, and Jeréz, the leader\r\nof the Liberals, deserted Walker in the following June, and began a\r\nrevolution against him in Leon and the western departments. Walker\r\nthereupon had himself elected President of the Republic (June 29, 1856).\r\n\r\nThe adventure of the filibusters had meanwhile attracted much interest\r\nand sympathy in the United States, where the control of Nicaragua by\r\nan American was regarded as an offset to the encroachments of Great\r\nBritain on the eastern end of the proposed route of the interoceanic\r\ncanal. The control exercised by that power over Greytown, at the\r\nmouth of the San Juan River, had not yet been given up, in spite of\r\nthe provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The people of the South,\r\nmoreover, who favored expansion in tropical countries in order to\r\nmaintain the relative influence of the slave states in the Union,\r\nbelieved that they saw in the measures which Walker adopted early in\r\nhis administration to aid Americans in acquiring land in Nicaragua,\r\nand to open the way for the introduction there of negro slavery,\r\nindications that his ultimate object was the annexation of the country\r\nto the United States as a new slave-holding commonwealth. This belief\r\nappears to have been erroneous, for Walker himself more than once\r\nexpressed the intention of creating an independent nation, with\r\nhimself at its head as military dictator;[13] but it at least gained\r\nfor the adventurer a large amount of assistance.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore easy for Walker’s friends to secure large amounts of\r\nsupplies and many recruits for his cause in the United States. The\r\noriginal force of fifty-eight was soon increased to several hundred,\r\nand the immense losses caused by disease and by fighting were made\r\nup with little difficulty. It is said that 2,500 men in all joined\r\nthe “phalanx,” of whom more than one thousand died of wounds or of\r\ndisease.[14] The government of the United States attempted to stop\r\nthe recruiting of men and the fitting out of expeditions within its\r\njurisdiction, but it was able to accomplish very little because of the\r\ndeficiencies of its neutrality laws and the strong popular feeling in\r\nfavor of the filibusters, which often prevented the federal officials\r\nfrom carrying out the orders of their superiors. The President and the\r\nDepartment of State themselves were by no means unfriendly to Walker’s\r\nenterprise while it still offered a prospect of success. The American\r\nminister in Nicaragua had throughout exerted his influence in favor of\r\nWalker, although in so doing he had greatly exceeded his instructions,\r\nand the Rivas government had been officially recognized by President\r\nPierce on May 14, 1856. This recognition was not, however, extended to\r\nWalker after the latter had become president.\r\n\r\nThe most useful friends and the most dangerous enemies of Walker’s\r\nregime were the American financiers interested in the Accessory\r\nTransit Company, a concern which was at that time transporting many\r\nthousands of Americans each month from New York to San Francisco\r\nby way of the San Juan River, crossing from the Great Lake to the\r\nPacific by a macadamized road from La Virgen to San Juan del Sur.\r\nWhen the filibusters arrived in Nicaragua, a contest was in progress\r\nin this company in which Morgan and Garrison, the agents at New York\r\nand San Francisco respectively, were striving to wrest the control\r\nfrom Cornelius Vanderbilt. Failing to achieve their purpose, Morgan\r\nand Garrison determined to make use of Walker to turn the tables upon\r\ntheir successful rival. They did much to aid him in securing control\r\nof the Nicaraguan government by supplying him with money and arms and\r\nby bringing him large numbers of recruits in their steamers from New\r\nYork and San Francisco; and in return for these favors they prevailed\r\nupon him to revoke the concession of the old company and to grant a\r\nnew concession to them. This action brought Walker into a conflict\r\nwith Vanderbilt, who from that time on used every means to compass the\r\nfilibuster’s destruction.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1856, Walker was practically supreme in southwestern\r\nNicaragua, and had complete control of the Transit route. An army\r\nsent against him by Costa Rica a few months before had won two or\r\nthree battles, but had soon been forced to withdraw by an epidemic of\r\ncholera. The hostile elements in Nicaragua itself, and the armies of\r\nGuatemala, Salvador, and Honduras, were however gathering at Leon, for\r\nall Central America had risen in arms against the foreign invader. In\r\nSeptember the allies advanced on Masaya, where they inflicted a heavy\r\ndefeat on a small force of Americans. In November they took Granada,\r\nthe seat of Walker’s government, which the filibusters evacuated and\r\ndestroyed on their approach. Walker then moved his army by water to the\r\nTransit road, which was the chief avenue by which he received supplies\r\nand recruits from the outside world.\r\n\r\nThe allies had thus far been unable to inflict a decisive defeat on\r\nthe American leader. Although they had faced him for five months\r\nwith forces which must have outnumbered his little command at least\r\nthree to one, the quarrels between their leaders had made effective\r\naction impossible, and the diseases which had decimated both camps had\r\ndisheartened them far more than they had the intrepid “phalanx.” It\r\nis probable that they would soon have abandoned the campaign had not\r\nCosta Rica, instigated by Vanderbilt and encouraged by the government\r\nof Great Britain, again taken the field and struck Walker a decisive\r\nblow at his weakest point. In December a force from that country,\r\ndirected by one of Vanderbilt’s agents, had descended the San Carlos\r\nRiver and seized the steamers on the San Juan and the Great Lake,\r\nthus cutting off Walker’s communications with New York, whence he had\r\nreceived the greatest part of his reinforcements. They then joined the\r\nallies who were confronting the filibuster force at Rivas. Walker was\r\nnow no longer able to replenish his supplies or to fill the gaps in his\r\nranks with new recruits. Although in desperate straits, he held out for\r\nseveral months, beating off the attacks of the Central American troops\r\nwith great loss. The melting away of his small force through disease\r\nand desertion, however, finally made his position untenable. On May 1,\r\n1857, he surrendered to Commander Davis of the U. S. S. St. Mary’s, who\r\nhad interposed his mediation to put an end to the hostilities.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the war there were six armies in Nicaragua,\r\nrepresenting the four other Central American republics and the two\r\nfactions in the country itself. Most of the foreign contingents\r\nwere withdrawn by their respective governments, after some slight\r\ndifficulties, but neither the Conservatives under General Tomás\r\nMartínez nor the Liberals under Jeréz were willing to allow the other\r\nparty to take possession of the government. Another civil war would\r\nprobably have been the result, had not the Republic suddenly been\r\nmenaced by a new danger from without. Costa Rica, attempting to take\r\nadvantage of the exhaustion of her neighbor, declined to evacuate the\r\nterritory which she had occupied on the south bank of the San Juan\r\nRiver, and demanded the surrender of certain military posts there which\r\nwould give her control of the greater part of the route of the proposed\r\ncanal. As soon as the intentions of President Mora became evident,\r\nJeréz and Martínez assumed a joint dictatorship and prepared for war.\r\nHostilities were only averted by the sudden return of Walker, which\r\nforced the two countries to settle their differences and to prepare to\r\nresist a new invasion. Costa Rica had already withdrawn her claims when\r\nnews arrived that the filibuster had been taken prisoner by the captain\r\nof an American warship on the East Coast before he had had time to\r\nreach the interior.[15]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the capital had been definitely and permanently established\r\nat Managua, and Tomás Martínez had taken charge of the presidency\r\nas the result of an election. With his accession began the first,\r\nand up to the present time the only, era of relatively stable and\r\ncomparatively efficient government in the history of the Republic.\r\nMartínez held office until 1867, suppressing a Liberal revolt led by\r\nJeréz in 1863, and was succeeded by a series of capable and honorable\r\npresidents belonging to the Conservative party.[16] These men were\r\nthe leaders of a strongly organized and homogeneous group, which was\r\nable to maintain itself in office until 1893 because of its unity and\r\nits moderate and sagacious policy. Although thoroughly conservative\r\nin ideas as well as in name, striving to maintain the existing social\r\norder and the influence of the Church, the administrations of the\r\n“thirty years” nevertheless did much to promote the economic and\r\nsocial progress of the country. A railway was built from the Pacific\r\nport of Corinto to Leon and Lake Managua, and another from the city\r\nof Managua to Granada; agriculture was encouraged in many ways; and\r\neven the school system was enlarged and improved. Their most important\r\nachievement was the maintenance of peace during so long a period. There\r\nwere few revolts of importance, and not one successful revolution\r\nbetween 1863 and 1893, notwithstanding the fact that the prolonged\r\ntenure of power by one political group, which allowed no real freedom\r\nof elections, was naturally distasteful to the opposition.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which the Conservatives were able to sustain their\r\nauthority for so long should afford a valuable lesson for their\r\nsuccessors. In the first place, the government was that of a group\r\nof men, rather than that of one absolute ruler. As each president\r\nat the end of his term turned over his office to one of his\r\nassociates, instead of bringing about his own re-election, there\r\nwas little jealousy between the leaders, and each in turn had the\r\nsupport of a united party. So long as there was no treachery within\r\nthe administration itself, and so long as friendly relations were\r\ncultivated with the neighboring states, the government, with its\r\ncontrol of the army and the forts, had little to fear from its enemies.\r\nThe Liberals, on their side, showed little inclination to recommence\r\nthe civil wars which had devastated the country from 1821 to 1863,\r\nfor they profited by the maintenance of order, and were treated with\r\nfar more fairness and generosity than usually falls to the lot of the\r\nopposition party in Central America. At the present time, after a\r\nquarter century of renewed party strife and mutual persecution, many\r\nmembers of both parties look back on the “thirty years” as the happiest\r\nperiod of the Republic’s history.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, dissatisfied elements which only awaited an\r\nopportunity to overthrow the Conservative regime. The Leon leaders were\r\nfar from accepting the rule of their traditional rivals complacently,\r\nand they could rely upon the support of increasingly numerous groups\r\nof young men of the middle and lower classes in other parts of the\r\ncountry, who were beginning to take a prominent part in political\r\nagitation. The “Principal Families” were losing their prestige as they\r\nhad already lost it in Guatemala and Costa Rica, and their political\r\npower was destroyed when the first serious dissension appeared in their\r\nranks. In 1889 President Carazo died in the middle of his term, and was\r\nsucceeded by Roberto Sacasa, one of the few Conservatives from Leon.\r\nWhen the new president attempted to give the people of his own city\r\nsome of the more important public offices, the extreme partisans of\r\nGranada overthrew him in 1893. This act, which broke the unity of the\r\nConservative party and thus weakened the government, was followed by a\r\nsuccessful Liberal uprising in Leon some months later.\r\n\r\nAs the result of this revolution, the presidency was given to a young\r\nman from Managua, who was prominent among the younger generation of\r\nLiberals. José Santos Zelaya was the absolute ruler of Nicaragua for\r\nsixteen years. He was supported at first by the leaders at Leon,\r\nbut in 1896, when it became evident that he intended to force his\r\nre-election for a second term, the western city rose against him.\r\nThe administration was saved only by the intervention of the allied\r\ngovernment of Honduras and by the aid of the Conservatives of Granada,\r\nwho were willing to support even a Liberal president against their\r\ntraditional enemies. This episode illustrates one of the chief sources\r\nof Zelaya’s power--his skill in playing off the members of the\r\ndifferent factions against one another. When it became evident that\r\nit was impossible to overthrow him, the Leon chiefs again associated\r\nthemselves with him, and even some of the wealthy _Granadinos_ accepted\r\npositions and favors from him.\r\n\r\nDuring the Liberal administration, the railway system and the steamer\r\nservice on the lakes were extended and improved, the development of the\r\ncoffee districts was stimulated by generous subsidies, and the capital,\r\nZelaya’s birthplace, was transformed from a rather primitive small town\r\nto the most progressive city of the Republic, which at the present\r\ntime is ahead of Granada, and but little behind Leon, in population.\r\nMarked progress was made in the matter of public instruction, for\r\nschools were opened in all parts of the country, and many young men of\r\nspecial ability were sent abroad to study. It is to be regretted that\r\nthe Conservative administrations which succeeded Zelaya have fallen far\r\nbehind the Liberal dictator in this respect, and have abandoned many of\r\nthe educational institutions which he opened.\r\n\r\nDespite his progressive policy, however, Zelaya was a brutal and\r\nunscrupulous tyrant, who exploited the country for his own personal\r\nprofit on a scale unprecedented in the history of the Isthmus. He and\r\nhis ministers established monopolies of all sorts, and sold valuable\r\nconcessions to foreigners or acquired them themselves, until there\r\nwere few forms of agriculture or industry which did not pay a heavy\r\ntribute to some favored person. The silver currency disappeared before\r\nlarge issues of irredeemable paper money, and the requisitions of the\r\ngovernment were paid for, not with cash, but with receipts which could\r\nbe negotiated only at a loss and through the aid of persons having\r\ninfluence with the treasury department. Private persons enjoyed little\r\nprotection in their property and personal liberty against abuses of\r\npower by the local and military officials, and the enemies of the\r\ngovernment suffered not only exile and the confiscation of their\r\nproperty, but even torture and sometimes death in the prisons. The\r\nrich families of Granada, who were with some reason held responsible\r\nfor the revolts which occurred almost every year, were treated with\r\ngreat brutality. The avarice and cruelty of the men in power, however,\r\nwere felt most severely only by their irreconcilable enemies. The\r\nfriends of the government prospered, and the people as a whole suffered\r\ncomparatively little. In the country at large, in fact, the inflow of\r\nmoney resulting from the reckless sale of concessions created a sort of\r\nprosperity, for which the country has had to pay since Zelaya’s fall.\r\n\r\nZelaya raised Nicaragua to a position of influence in Central America\r\nwhich she had never before enjoyed. He fomented revolutions in all\r\nof the other four republics, and even in countries so far distant as\r\nColombia and Ecuador, until by 1909 the only one of his neighbors\r\nwho did not hate and fear him was the president of Honduras, whom he\r\nhimself had placed in office by his invasion of that state in 1907.\r\nDuring the last three years of his administration, his attempts to\r\nre-establish the old federal union, with himself at its head, plunged\r\nall Central America into turmoil. His warlike activities and his\r\nsystematic opposition to American influence in the Isthmus finally\r\nbrought about an open rupture with the government of the United States,\r\nand did much to cause his downfall. The history of the revolution of\r\n1909, and the history of the Republic since that date will be treated\r\nin Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nNinety-five years of rarely interrupted civil strife have left\r\nNicaragua in a condition which offers little hope for the early\r\nre-establishment of peace and good government. The advances made along\r\nthese lines between 1863 and 1893 were to a great extent nullified\r\nduring the Liberal regime, when the continual attempts at revolution,\r\nfollowed usually by barbarous treatment of the people of Granada and\r\nother Conservative centers, not only revived and intensified the old\r\nlocalistic spirit, but aroused a turbulent spirit and a strong taste\r\nfor factional strife among the people of all classes. Within a few\r\nyears after 1893, it would have been impossible for either party to\r\nacquiesce in the rule of the other as the Liberals had acquiesced in\r\nthe Conservative regime of the “thirty years,” for the subordination\r\nof any sense of justice to political considerations in the conduct of\r\nthe government and in the courts made the opponents of the party in\r\npower so insecure in their property and in their personal liberty that\r\nthey were ready to support almost any revolutionary movement which\r\npromised an alleviation of their condition. The only creed of public\r\nofficials and professional politicians seemed to be the promotion of\r\nthe interests of their faction and the abuse and subjugation of their\r\npolitical enemies. These conditions were little changed by the advent\r\nof the Conservatives to power in 1910, because the new authorities, who\r\nhad grown up under the oppression of Zelaya, with the worst features of\r\nhis administration constantly before their eyes, apparently could not\r\nresist the temptation to avenge themselves upon their former rulers on\r\nthe one hand and to attempt to recoup their losses at the expense of\r\nthe nation on the other. The political morality of all parties had been\r\nso debased that a restoration of the clean and moderate regime of the\r\n“thirty years,” of which many of the older generation in Granada had\r\ndreamed, was no longer possible.\r\n\r\nThe fertile lake plains, laid waste time after time by revolutionary\r\narmies, are no longer the “Mahomet’s Paradise” which travelers had\r\ndescribed in glowing terms in colonial times. After the declaration of\r\nindependence, the energies of the ruling class in each section of the\r\ncountry were entirely occupied in endeavors to maintain themselves in\r\npower or to overthrow administrations controlled by their enemies. The\r\nharassed landholders continued to cultivate their plantations as well\r\nas they could in the intervals between civil wars, but the political\r\nsituation of the country soon became so hopeless that there was little\r\nincentive for them to attempt to repair the damage wrought by each\r\nsuccessive outbreak or to engage in new agricultural enterprises. The\r\nindigo plantations which had made the people of the province wealthy\r\nunder the rule of Spain were abandoned some time before the invention\r\nof aniline dyes made them unprofitable in the other states, and the\r\nfamous cacao of Nicaragua, which was formerly an important export,\r\nis now grown in quantities little more than sufficient to supply the\r\nlocal demand. The only important products of the lake basin today are\r\nplantains, corn, beans, sugar, and cacao, which are planted for local\r\nconsumption, and cattle, which are still raised in large numbers,\r\nnotwithstanding the losses inflicted on ranch owners by foraging\r\nparties and bandits.\r\n\r\nOutside of the hot plains of the interior, there have until recently\r\nbeen few settlements of importance. The climate of the mountains to\r\nthe northwest and southeast of the lakes is much more suitable to\r\nEuropean colonization than that of Granada and Leon, but the latter\r\ncities, situated as they are on what was formerly the transisthmian\r\ncommercial route, have always been preferred as a place of residence by\r\nthe creole families. The majority of the towns which were established\r\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the regions of Matagalpa,\r\nJinotega, and Segovia were soon destroyed by the fierce mountain\r\nIndians or by pirates who came up the rivers from their bases of\r\noperations on the East Coast; and those which survived, with few\r\nexceptions, are today but little more than straggling villages. In\r\nthe _sierras_ between the lakes and the Pacific, there were at the\r\ntime of the conquest a number of Indian villages, but their growth\r\nwas discouraged by the fact that the lack of rivers and springs made\r\nit difficult to secure even drinking water in the dry season. Neither\r\ndistrict received much attention from the government until the latter\r\npart of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty-five years, however, a number of coffee\r\nplantations have been established both in the departments of Matagalpa\r\nand Jinotega, and in the mountains near Managua and Granada. These\r\nare not so large nor so well equipped as those in other countries of\r\nthe Isthmus, and their product is much less than that of Guatemala or\r\nSalvador, but their development has nevertheless greatly increased the\r\ncommerce of the country. It has not, however, affected general economic\r\nand political conditions so much as it would have if the majority of\r\nthe plantations were not owned and managed by foreigners. Nicaraguan\r\ncitizens hold only a part of the properties in the southwestern\r\n_sierras_, and those in the North are almost entirely in the hands of\r\nGermans, Englishmen, and Americans. The natives have participated less\r\nin the prosperity due to the new conditions than in any of the other\r\ncountries where coffee has become the principal national product.\r\n\r\nThe Matagalpa and Jinotega districts have a large Indian population,\r\nliving in little settlements scattered through the mountains. These\r\ntribes were not subjugated by the colonial authorities until nearly two\r\ncenturies after the establishment of Leon and Granada, and even at the\r\npresent time, when most of them have adopted the Spanish language and\r\nreligion, they show little admixture of white blood. At the time of\r\ntheir pacification they received large tracts of land from the crown,\r\nwhich they still hold in common and apportion at regular intervals\r\namong their members. As the extent and the exact boundaries of these\r\ngrants have never been definitely settled, they have been a cause\r\nof constant friction between the native communities and the white\r\nplanters. The officials of the central government have often carelessly\r\nsold land belonging to the Indians to the coffee growers as a part of\r\nthe public domain, and the planters themselves have in some instances\r\ntaken possession of the property of the aboriginal communities without\r\nany right to do so. Projects for the surveying of the Indian lands and\r\nfor the sale of those which their owners do not need to the coffee\r\nplanters have for some time occupied the attention of the authorities\r\nat Managua.\r\n\r\nThe labor situation in the northern coffee belt presents considerable\r\ndifficulties. The Indians, who see little advantage in exchanging their\r\nfree life in their own villages for one of toil on the plantations,\r\ndo not furnish the regular and dependable supply of workmen which are\r\nindispensable for the proper cultivation of the plantations, although\r\nthey do not refuse to work for a few days when they have need for a\r\nsmall sum of ready money. Under Zelaya, an attempt was made to solve\r\nthe problem by the passage of a peonage law similar to the _Ley de\r\nTrabajadores_ in Guatemala. This system seems never to have borne so\r\nheavily upon the Indians as in the latter republic, but it at least\r\ngave the planters a means for securing a regular force with which to\r\nwork their properties. Further aid was furnished by the recruiting\r\nof laborers by force during the harvest time, when many Indians from\r\nMatagalpa were even forced to travel for many days on foot across the\r\nhot plains of the interior to work for friends of the administration\r\nin the _sierras_ south of the lakes. The labor laws were abolished by\r\nthe Conservative administration, however, and since 1910 the planters,\r\nunable to enforce contracts which they make with the Indians, have\r\noften had difficulties in harvesting their crops. Their position has\r\nbeen alleviated somewhat by the fact that the local authorities have\r\nin many cases illegally enforced the old law; but the uncertainty of\r\nthe labor situation has greatly discouraged the extension of the\r\nplantations and the introduction of new capital.[17]\r\n\r\nThe East Coast, which is for all practical purposes farther from the\r\ncities of the interior than it is from New Orleans, has only within\r\nthe last quarter century become an integral part of Nicaragua, for\r\nuntil 1894 it enjoyed a sort of independent existence under British\r\nprotection as the “Mosquito Kingdom.” This was a fictitious state of\r\nhalf-breed Indians and negroes, who had from early times maintained\r\ncommercial and to some extent political relations with the nearby\r\nsettlements of English pirates and woodcutters, and through them with\r\nthe governor of Jamaica. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when\r\nthe attention of the world was first called to the possibility of\r\nconstructing an interoceanic canal by way of the San Juan River, these\r\nrelations were made the pretext for the establishment of a protectorate\r\nover the entire eastern portion of Nicaragua and for the seizure of\r\nGreytown, at the mouth of the San Juan, which had never even been in\r\nthe domain claimed by the Indians. The territory which was thus brought\r\nunder British control was in reality governed, not by the savage and\r\ndegenerate native chiefs, but by the British and other foreigners who\r\nhad settled along the Coast. The United States from the first refused\r\nto recognize the protectorate, and protested vigorously and in the\r\nend successfully against the violation of Nicaragua’s sovereignty.\r\nThe Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, signed in 1850, bound both powers not to\r\ncolonize, occupy, or exercise dominion over any part of Nicaragua or\r\nCentral America, but the British government refused to admit that\r\nthis obliged it to withdraw its protection from the Mosquitos, and\r\nthe continued occupation of Greytown, as we have seen, was one of\r\nthe causes which led the people of the United States to support the\r\nfilibustering expeditions of Walker. In 1860, Great Britain agreed to\r\nabandon the protectorate on condition that Greytown should be made a\r\nfree port, and that the Indians should be given a reservation in which\r\nthey were to be free to govern themselves in accordance with their own\r\nusages. This meant that the foreigners on the Coast were practically to\r\nbe at liberty to manage their own affairs without interference by the\r\nnative authorities. The arrangement was unsatisfactory from the first,\r\nfor the residents of Greytown and Bluefields objected to every exercise\r\nof Nicaraguan sovereignty, and Great Britain upheld them in their\r\nattitude, and thus in fact continued to exercise a protectorate over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMatters came to a crisis in 1893, when Zelaya made a war with Honduras\r\nthe pretext for sending an army into the reservation and seizing the\r\ncontrol of the government. The Indians and the foreigners on the Coast\r\nprotested strongly against this action, but Great Britain, wearied of\r\nthe difficult and equivocal position in which her relations with the\r\nMosquitos had placed her, refused to uphold them. They had, therefore,\r\nno choice but to submit. In 1894 a convention called by the Nicaraguan\r\ncommander and dominated by him voted for the complete incorporation of\r\nthe reservation into the Republic as the Department of “Zelaya,” and\r\nthe Republic has ever since exercised complete jurisdiction over the\r\nformer “sambo” kingdom.\r\n\r\nLike other sections of the Caribbean litoral, the East Coast of\r\nNicaragua is inhabited chiefly by Americans and English-speaking\r\nnegroes. Its principal product is the banana. Bluefields, which is the\r\nadministrative center and the seaport, is connected with New Orleans\r\nby a regular line of small steamers, and has far more commercial and\r\nfinancial relations with the United States than with the interior.\r\nDuring the Liberal regime, many important concessions were granted for\r\nenterprises in the newly incorporated territory, which later became\r\na source of no little embarrassment to the government. In some cases\r\nthe higher officials made grants which were actually harmful to the\r\ncommunity as a whole, for their own personal profit, while in others\r\nlarge tracts of land were ceded or special privileges were granted to\r\nunscrupulous promoters who had little intention of carrying out in\r\ngood faith the obligations which they assumed, but who appealed to\r\ntheir own governments for aid whenever they became involved in disputes\r\nwith the native authorities. Some of the monopolies established, and\r\nparticularly the exclusive right which one company received to operate\r\nsteamers on the Bluefields River, caused great discontent on the Coast\r\nitself, and led the foreign colony there to take a prominent part in\r\norganizing and supporting the revolution of 1909, by which Zelaya was\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\nThe means of transportation between the various sections of Nicaragua\r\nare as yet very primitive. In the interior, they are by no means bad,\r\nfor it was comparatively easy to build a railroad from Corinto, the\r\nchief port on the Pacific, to all of the important cities of the lake\r\nregion and to the coffee district west of it; and the lakes themselves\r\nafford a cheap means of transportation to the regions around their\r\nshores. Matagalpa and the northern departments, however, depend upon\r\nthe rudest kind of cart roads, and are almost inaccessible in the rainy\r\nseason. Communication with the Atlantic Coast is still more difficult,\r\nespecially at present, for the steamer service which formerly existed\r\non the San Juan River has been allowed to deteriorate, and the overland\r\nroute to Bluefields involves several days of traveling through a\r\nsparsely settled tropical forest on mule back. Preparations are now\r\nwell advanced for the construction by American capital of a railway\r\nfrom Bluefields to Lake Nicaragua, which would make travel from the\r\nEast to the West Coast comparatively easy. Another road is planned\r\nfrom the main line of the Pacific Railway to Matagalpa, and it seems\r\nnot improbable that this and the Bluefields line may eventually be\r\nconnected, so that it will be possible to cross the Republic from one\r\nocean to the other.\r\n\r\nThe execution of these projects, and in fact Nicaragua’s whole prospect\r\nfor the immediate future, depend upon her relations with the United\r\nStates. Since 1911, both the political affairs and the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country have not been entirely in the hands of her\r\nown citizens, for the government at Washington, in its efforts to\r\npromote peace in Nicaragua and in Central America, has entered upon a\r\ncourse which has forced it on several occasions to intervene decisively\r\nin the internal politics of the country, and two firms of American\r\nbankers, as a result of their financial assistance to the government,\r\nhave gradually assumed control of the customs houses, of the railways,\r\nof the currency system, and even of the internal revenues of the\r\nRepublic. The course of events which has brought this to pass will be\r\ndescribed in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Elisée Reclus, _North America_, Vol. II, pp. 274, 279.\r\n\r\n[12] There are no very reliable figures for the population of the\r\ncities or for the total population of the Republic, but the best\r\nestimates agree that the Republic has about 600,000 inhabitants, while\r\nthe population of the cities mentioned may be stated approximately as\r\nfollows: Leon, 62,000; Managua, 35,000; Granada, 17,000; Chinandega,\r\n10,000; Masaya, 13,000; Rivas, 8,000.\r\n\r\n[13] See William O. Scroggs, _Filibusters and Financiers_, which\r\ngives a very complete account of Walker’s career, and upon-which the\r\nforegoing sketch is to a great extent based. Walker himself wrote a\r\nbook about his campaigns, entitled _The War in Nicaragua_, and many of\r\nhis followers also left accounts of their adventures.\r\n\r\n[14] Scroggs, op. cit. p. 305.\r\n\r\n[15] Walker was eventually captured and shot while attempting a third\r\ninvasion of Central America on the North Coast of Honduras in 1860.\r\n\r\n[16] These were: Fernando Guzmán, 1867-71; Vicente Cuadra, 1871-75;\r\nPedro Joaquín Chamorro, 1875-79; Joaquín Zavala, 1879-83; Adán\r\nCárdenas, 1883-87; Evaristo Carazo, 1887-89; David Osorno, 1889; and\r\nRoberto Sacasa, 1889-93.\r\n\r\n[17] In a previous chapter, the author has stated it to be his opinion\r\nthat the plantations of Guatemala could be operated successfully\r\nwithout a peonage system. The effect of the repeal of the labor laws in\r\nNicaragua would seem to prove the contrary, were it not for the great\r\ndifference between the Indians of the two countries. In Guatemala, the\r\nIndians depend upon the planters for a living, as they have little land\r\nof their own. They were, moreover, almost wholly an agricultural people\r\nbefore the Spanish conquest, whereas the Indians of Matagalpa have\r\nalways secured at least a portion of their food by hunting, and have\r\nnever been accustomed to any but spasmodic and irregular agricultural\r\nlabor. They have also great tracts of land of their own, of which,\r\nunlike the tribes in Guatemala, they have never been dispossessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                               SALVADOR\r\n\r\n Geographical Description--History--Improvement of Political Conditions\r\n in Recent Years--Activities of the Government--Agricultural\r\n Products--Social Conditions--Means of Transportation--Relations with\r\n the United States--Prospect for the Future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalvador is the most important of the Central American republics,\r\nafter Guatemala, although she has a far smaller territory than any of\r\nher neighbors. Almost all of her total area of 7,225 square miles is\r\nsuitable for cultivation, and there are few parts of it which are not\r\ninhabited by a dense population. Notwithstanding the fact that she has\r\nno coast line on the Atlantic and has thus been deprived of direct\r\ncommunication with Europe and the Eastern United States, her foreign\r\ntrade is far greater than that of Honduras and Nicaragua, and but\r\nlittle behind that of Guatemala and Costa Rica, while her upper classes\r\nare more closely in touch with the outside world, and have shown a\r\ngreater tendency to adopt foreign customs and practices than those of\r\nthe majority of the other countries. Her capital, San Salvador, is a\r\nbusy, up-to-date commercial center, which impresses the traveler as one\r\nof the most progressive cities of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nExtending from Guatemala on the west to the Gulf of Fonseca on the\r\neast,[18] the Republic occupies a section of the broad plain along the\r\nPacific Coast of the Isthmus, and like the similarly situated section\r\nof Guatemala, is traversed by a chain of volcanic peaks, many of which\r\nare still active or have been active within very recent times. The\r\nsoil, consisting mainly of decomposed lava, is extremely fertile. The\r\nslopes of the mountains are excellently adapted for the cultivation\r\nof coffee, and in the lower altitudes, although much of the country\r\nis rough and broken, nearly all of the other characteristic Central\r\nAmerican products can be grown. There is a plentiful rainfall from\r\nMay to October, and an abundant water supply for the dense population\r\nis provided by several lakes and by a number of streams which do\r\nnot dry up during the rainless season. The Lempa, which divides the\r\neastern from the western half of the country, after flowing through\r\nthe northern departments from its source near the Guatemalan frontier,\r\nis by far the largest river on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. As\r\nthe more important cities are situated in the valleys at the foot of\r\nthe volcanoes, or in the low plains along the coast and on the banks\r\nof the Lempa, few of them are more than two thousand feet above sea\r\nlevel, and their climate is consequently less agreeable than that of\r\nthe most densely populated parts of Guatemala and Costa Rica. Except\r\nin the lower Lempa Valley, however, the people are fairly healthy,\r\nprobably because the porousness of the soil discourages the breeding of\r\nmosquitoes and thus holds in check some of the diseases most prevalent\r\nin other parts of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe people are of much the same racial character as those of Nicaragua\r\nand Honduras, although there seems to be rather more Spanish blood in\r\ntheir veins, and less admixture of negro, than in those countries.\r\nThe majority are in part at least of Indian ancestry, but all speak\r\nSpanish, and there are only a few communities where the aborigines have\r\nmaintained their individuality and their primitive customs. Among the\r\nupper classes, the greater number are of pure or nearly pure European\r\ndescent, but Indian blood is no bar to social or political prominence.\r\nThe people as a whole are fairly industrious, considering the climate\r\nand the prevalence of hookworm and other intestinal parasites, and the\r\nstandard of living among the laboring classes is considerably higher\r\nthan in Guatemala or Nicaragua. The landowning class is perhaps the\r\nwealthiest and the most enterprising in the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Salvador was as turbulent as that of her\r\nneighbors. For many years after the declaration of independence she\r\nwas almost continuously in a state of civil war, partly because of the\r\nrivalry between the political leaders and the jealousy between the\r\ncities within the state itself, and partly because of the incessant\r\nquarrels between the state authorities and those of Guatemala. As\r\nwe have seen, her people played a prominent part in the struggles\r\nwhich accompanied the first attempt to establish a Central American\r\nfederation. The prolonged war in which the citizens of Salvador and\r\nof one section of Honduras overthrew the Conservative government in\r\nGuatemala in 1829 was followed within three years by new difficulties\r\nwhich led President Morazán in his turn to remove the state authorities\r\nin San Salvador and to transfer to that city the seat of the federal\r\nadministration. From then until the final fall of the great unionist\r\nleader, Salvador was frequently involved with one or another and at\r\ntimes with all of her neighbors, because of the opposition of the\r\nlatter to the federal authorities. She was the last of the five states\r\nto admit the dissolution of the union, and at the present time she is\r\nthe chief center of the party which favors its restoration.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal party, which had supported Morazán, was driven from power\r\nby the intervention of President Carrera of Guatemala in 1840, and for\r\nfive years the government was under the control of Francisco Malespín,\r\none of Carrera’s friends, who used his position as _comandante de\r\narmas_ to make and unmake presidents and to dominate the policy of the\r\ncivil authorities. The Liberals were able to return to power in 1845,\r\nafter a bloody struggle in which Malespín, although now estranged from\r\nCarrera, was assisted by the government of Honduras. They were again\r\ndriven out in 1852 by Carrera, and four Conservative leaders occupied\r\nthe presidency for short terms. The Liberals, under the leadership of\r\nGerardo Barrios, regained power in 1860, but were forced to relinquish\r\nit two years later as the result of another war with Carrera. In 1863,\r\nthe Conservative leader, Francisco Dueñas, became president, and\r\nconducted the government efficiently and successfully until 1871, when\r\nthe Liberal party, which was at the same time carrying on successful\r\nrevolutions in Guatemala and Honduras, defeated him and placed at the\r\nhead of the state Santiago González, who remained in office until\r\n1876. His successor, Andrés Valle, became involved in another war with\r\nGuatemala, arising from an intervention by both states in the internal\r\naffairs of Honduras, and was replaced by Rafael Zaldívar, one of the\r\nleading followers of the former president Dueñas. This able ruler\r\nremained in office until 1885, maintaining the friendliest relations\r\nwith President Barrios of Guatemala, despite the fact that one belonged\r\nto the Conservative and the other to the Liberal party. When Barrios\r\nattempted to renew the Central American Union by force, and entered\r\nupon the campaign which ended so disastrously for him at Chalchuapa,\r\nhowever, Zaldívar took the field against him. A short time after this\r\nwar, Zaldívar was forced to resign by a revolution headed by Francisco\r\nMenéndez, and the latter was president until his death in 1890. After\r\nhim, the Republic was ruled by the Ezeta brothers, two military\r\nleaders who seized the presidency by a _coup d’état_ and maintained\r\nthemselves in office by despotic and rather barbarous methods until\r\nthey were overthrown by an uprising in the city of Santa Ana in 1894.\r\nRafael Gutiérrez, who became president in that year, was an able and\r\npatriotic executive, but some features of his administration caused\r\nconsiderable discontent, and his participation in the Treaty of\r\nAmapala, by which Salvador entered into a loose union with Honduras and\r\nNicaragua, caused his fall in 1898.\r\n\r\nThe new president, General Tomás Regalado, served his full term and\r\npassed on the chief magistracy in an orderly manner to Pedro José\r\nEscalón in 1903. From that time there has not been a successful\r\nrevolution in Salvador, although discontented political leaders have\r\noccasionally made ineffectual attempts to overthrow the government. In\r\n1906, General Regalado, who was very influential in the administration\r\nof President Escalón, brought about a short and purposeless war with\r\nGuatemala, which ended with the death of its author on the battlefield.\r\nIn 1907 there was another war, between Salvador and Nicaragua,\r\nabout the presidency of Honduras, and in that and the following\r\nyear President Zelaya of Nicaragua attempted several times, without\r\nsuccess, to promote revolutions against the governments of Escalón\r\nand of Fernando Figueroa, who succeeded him. The Government of the\r\nUnited States exerted its good offices to put an end to the hostilities\r\nbetween the two countries, and finally threatened to use force if\r\nnecessary to put an end to Zelaya’s attacks on his neighbor, but peace\r\nwas not entirely re-established until the Nicaraguan president was\r\noverthrown in 1909. Figueroa was succeeded by Manuel Enrique Araujo in\r\n1911. This president was assassinated in 1913, and the vice-president,\r\nDon Carlos Meléndez, completed the unexpired term and was re-elected to\r\nthe chief magistracy in 1915.\r\n\r\nIn the confused political history of Salvador, two important facts\r\nstand out: first, that the revolutions which occurred so frequently\r\nduring the seventy-five years following the declaration of independence\r\nwere due more to the interference of the other countries, and\r\nespecially of Guatemala, than to the strife of factions at home;\r\nand second, that in recent times, when this kind of interference is\r\nno longer so frequent, there has been a remarkably rapid progress\r\ntowards the establishment of a more stable form of government. For\r\nthree-quarters of a century after 1821, the internal tranquillity of\r\nthe country may be said to have been almost entirely dependent upon its\r\nrelations with its neighbors. The parties which were formed during the\r\nturbulent years of the Central American Union continued to act together\r\nlong after the states which made up the Union had become independent\r\nnations, and Conservative governments in Guatemala continued to regard\r\nthemselves as the natural enemies of Liberal administrations in\r\nNicaragua and Salvador, largely because of the bitter animosity between\r\nthe leaders, which had been engendered by the events of the years\r\n1821-40. Discontented factions in Salvador never hesitated to call in\r\nassistance from other countries to overthrow a hostile government at\r\nhome, and the presidents of the other countries on their side were\r\nalways ready to intervene to secure the establishment of a friendly\r\nadministration in Salvador, in order to increase their own influence\r\nand to make more secure their own position. As the leaders who had\r\nparticipated in the wars under the Federation died, however, and the\r\nparties lost their fundamental economic and social characteristics, so\r\nthat there was little real difference in principles or point of view\r\nbetween the Liberals of one country and the Conservatives of another,\r\nfactional politics ceased to a great extent to be international.\r\nIntervention to overthrow a government of opposite political complexion\r\nwas then no longer so necessary as a measure of self-preservation, as\r\nit had been when every Liberal or Conservative who came into power\r\nin one of the states felt it his duty to use all of the resources at\r\nhis command to secure the domination of his own party in the others.\r\nGuatemala has not played a decisive part in overthrowing a president\r\nof Salvador since the battle of Chalchuapa in 1885, and Honduras and\r\nNicaragua have now fallen so far behind their neighbor in population\r\nand resources that their intervention is no longer seriously to\r\nbe feared. The attempts of the president of the latter country to\r\nencourage revolutions in Salvador in 1907 and 1908 were failures,\r\nalthough they caused the government considerable uneasiness and expense.\r\n\r\nSince 1908, moreover, international wars between the Central American\r\nstates have been made practically impossible by the fact that the\r\nUnited States has employed diplomatic pressure and sometimes actual\r\nforce to secure the observance of the Washington Conventions of\r\n1907, by which the five countries pledged themselves to abstain from\r\ninterfering in each other’s internal affairs. At the present time\r\nit is not probable that an army from one state would be allowed to\r\ninvade one of the others for the purpose of bringing about a change\r\nof government. The prevention of this kind of aggression, of which\r\nthere were instances almost every year before 1907, has done much to\r\ndiscourage revolutions in Central America, because there is little\r\nchance, except in cases where there is a very general and very violent\r\npopular discontent with the government in power, for a revolt to\r\nsucceed without active assistance from outside.\r\n\r\nSince the character of her international relations has changed so\r\nthat external influences no longer make the establishment of internal\r\npeace impossible, Salvador has become one of the most orderly and best\r\ngoverned of the Central American republics. Her political affairs are\r\nalmost entirely in the hands of a small educated class, among whom\r\nlanded proprietors are more powerful and professional politicians and\r\nrevolutionists on the whole less numerous and less influential than\r\nelsewhere in the Isthmus. This class was for many years divided within\r\nitself into hostile factions, which were kept alive, long after the\r\ndisappearance of their original sources of difference, by the intrigues\r\nand interventions of the neighboring governments. After the violent\r\nanimosities created by the wars during the first Central American\r\nUnion died out, however, and after the cultivation of coffee and the\r\ndevelopment of commerce had opened up greater opportunities for the\r\nacquisition of wealth and power than were offered by the contest for\r\npublic offices, the ruling class as a whole turned its attention from\r\npolitics to agriculture. The damage inflicted by the frequent civil\r\nwars was severely felt by the proprietors of the plantations, who were\r\nrealizing for the first time the possibilities of the new life which\r\nthe importation of foreign luxuries and the ability to travel abroad\r\nplaced before them, and they consequently became almost a unit in\r\ntheir desire for peace and a stable government. An attempt to start an\r\nold-fashioned revolution at the present time, unless there were some\r\nstrong reason for desiring to overthrow the government, would probably\r\nmeet with determined hostility among the greater part of the wealthier\r\nand more intelligent classes.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, however, that Salvador is inherently a peaceful\r\ncountry in the same sense in which this is true of Costa Rica. The\r\nlower classes have no more inborn respect for authority and love of\r\npeace than have those of Nicaragua and Honduras, whom they strongly\r\nresemble in their racial characteristics and customs, and a large\r\nelement among them have always taken part in wars and revolutions with\r\nthe same gusto that is shown by the _mestizos_ of the more turbulent\r\ncountries. If they are on the whole less prone to revolt, this is due\r\nto the fact that they are fairly contented under present conditions,\r\nand that they are held under control by a much stronger and better\r\norganized military power than in those countries. The government is\r\nmaintained in office, not by popular respect for authority or by the\r\nwill of the people, but by force, for there are always elements, even\r\namong the upper classes, which are awaiting an opportunity to overthrow\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is at present, however, no organized opposition, as the old\r\nhistorical parties have nearly died out and the formation of new ones\r\nhas been discouraged by the policy of the government, which generally\r\neither wins over discontented political leaders by the gift of offices\r\nor money, or forcibly prevents them from carrying on propaganda hostile\r\nto it. In former times, opponents of the group in power were exiled\r\nor even murdered, but recent administrations have attempted rather to\r\nconciliate their opponents and to maintain the good will of the common\r\npeople, and there has been little of the severity towards defeated\r\nrivals which has helped to keep alive factional hatred in Guatemala\r\nand Nicaragua. Nevertheless, opposition to the government is still\r\nsuppressed with a firm hand, and murders for political purposes are by\r\nno means unknown.\r\n\r\nThe political institutions are no more democratic than those of the\r\nneighboring countries. Except where a successful revolution intervenes,\r\nthe presidency is passed on by each incumbent to a successor of his own\r\nchoosing, and all of the other nominally elective offices are filled in\r\naccordance with the wishes of the administration, since the authorities\r\ncontrol the elections by preventing the nomination of opposition\r\ncandidates and by exerting pressure on the voters. Every department\r\nis under the absolute personal control of the president, so far as he\r\nwishes to exercise his authority, and the responsibility for everything\r\nwhich occurs during the administration rests upon his shoulders. The\r\nCongress has at the present time some degree of independence, and the\r\njudiciary is not subjected to the same dictation by the executive\r\nas in some of the other countries, but neither is in any real sense\r\nco-ordinate with the latter, nor would be able to resist it if a\r\nserious difference of opinion arose.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, the presidents of Salvador have made little\r\nattempt to exercise the absolute and arbitrary authority which some\r\nof the recent rulers of Guatemala and Nicaragua have enjoyed, for\r\nthey have generally been content to abide so far as possible by the\r\nprovisions of the constitution and to relinquish their office to one\r\nof their supporters at the end of their legal term. Since 1898, with a\r\nsingle exception, changes of administration have taken place without\r\nthe intervention of force, and the one president who was assassinated\r\nwas followed by the constitutionally elected vice-president, without\r\ndisorder or further bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe chief support of the government is the army, which is better\r\ntrained and better equipped than that of any other Central American\r\ncountry. A large proportion of the soldiers, apparently, serve\r\nvoluntarily. Moreover, many remain with the colors for long periods,\r\nand learn to take a certain amount of pride in their calling. The\r\nofficers are of an unusually high type, because the comparatively good\r\nsalaries and the education offered by the Polytechnic School have\r\ninduced many young men of the better classes to adopt the military\r\nprofession as a career. Both officers and men seem on the whole to\r\nbe loyal to the government and show little tendency to political\r\nintrigue,--a statement which cannot be made with regard to the forces\r\nof some of the other republics. The army is far larger than the wealth\r\nor the actual necessities of the country would seem to justify, and\r\nheavy expenditures upon it have been a source of some discontent; but\r\nthe existence of a well-organized and well-trained body of troops has\r\nundoubtedly been a strong factor in favor of stable government and a\r\nvaluable protection against attack from without.\r\n\r\nThe civil police is also efficient and well equipped compared with\r\nthat of the neighboring countries. Besides the usual city forces, there\r\nis an organization called the _Guardia Civil_ in the rural districts\r\nnear the capital which patrols the roads and does much to protect life\r\nand property. Crimes of violence, however, are by no means uncommon,\r\nand are very frequently allowed to go unpunished, for the activity of\r\nthe army and the police, as in the other Central American countries,\r\nis directed more towards the maintenance of the authority of the\r\ngovernment than towards the prevention of wrongdoing. The suppression\r\nof revolts and the control of all parts of the Republic by military\r\nforce is easier than in any of the neighboring countries, because of\r\nthe small area to be policed and the denseness and compactness of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe chief functions performed by the government are the preservation\r\nof order, the management of the customs houses and the other sources\r\nof income, and the operation of such fundamentally necessary public\r\nservices as the postal and telegraph systems. A comparatively small\r\namount of money, considering the wealth of the country, is available\r\nfor other purposes, because of the heavy cost of the military\r\nestablishment and the losses due to inefficiency and peculation in\r\nthe collection and expenditure of the revenues. Sanitary measures and\r\npublic instruction have not received the attention which might be\r\nexpected among so progressive a people and little has been done, except\r\nby private initiative, to develop the resources of the country or to\r\nstimulate foreign commerce. Although abortive attempts have been made\r\nfrom time to time to establish agricultural and industrial schools,\r\nthe government has little interest in such institutions, and has never\r\ngiven them sufficient funds to accomplish anything of great value. The\r\nsystem of highways, which is of especial importance because of the\r\nlively internal commerce, leaves much to be desired, but its defects\r\nare due more to almost insurmountable difficulties arising from heavy\r\nrainfall and from the physical formation of the country than to lack of\r\ninterest. There are, however, cart roads, which are fairly good in the\r\ndry season, in all parts of the Republic, and near the capital there\r\nare several roads suitable for automobiles, which are owned by many of\r\nthe wealthy people of the city.\r\n\r\nThe public schools have received less attention than in some of the\r\nother countries. The Department of Public Instruction, which possesses\r\nmany well-informed and able officials, has done what it could with the\r\nscanty resources at its command, but the government has not supported\r\nit with adequate appropriations, and has not always shown care or\r\nimpartiality in the appointment of teachers. Only about one-fourth\r\nof the children between six and fourteen years of age are receiving\r\ninstruction.[19] The schools in the capital and in the larger cities,\r\nalthough badly equipped and very badly housed, do excellent work, and\r\nthe visitor cannot fail to be impressed by the enthusiasm shown by the\r\nchildren and by the teachers. The latter are generally inadequately\r\ntrained, but they appear to have a natural gift for arousing the\r\ninterest and holding the attention of their pupils. In the country,\r\neducational opportunities are much more limited, for the rural schools\r\nhave but three regular grades, with a complementary year in which\r\ninstruction in some trade is given, and there is little opportunity\r\nfor the children to receive a secondary education unless they can\r\nafford to spend five years completing their primary course in one of\r\nthe cities. The education of the lower classes has been purposely\r\nrestricted to a few fundamentals, because the authorities have desired\r\nto discourage the tendency, so harmful in all parts of Central America,\r\ntowards the adoption of the learned professions at the expense of\r\nagricultural pursuits. No government aid is now granted to poor\r\nchildren for advanced study either at home or in foreign countries, and\r\nevery effort is made rather to encourage those who have completed their\r\nprimary course to fit themselves for the cultivation of the soil or for\r\nsome trade. In the capital, schools have just been inaugurated where\r\npractical instruction for this purpose is given. There are a number of\r\nsecondary institutions in the larger cities which compare favorably\r\nwith those in other parts of Central America, although they also suffer\r\nfrom lack of funds and from the absence of well-trained teachers. The\r\nsame is true of the University, where law, engineering, pharmacy, and\r\nother professions are taught. The wealthier families educate their\r\nchildren in private institutions rather than in the public schools,\r\nand more and more young people at the present time are being sent to\r\ncomplete their studies in foreign countries, and especially in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe administration of public affairs is considerably less corrupt and\r\nsomewhat more efficient than in Guatemala, Nicaragua, or Honduras.\r\nThe integrity of many of the higher officials is above suspicion, and\r\ntheft is apparently not practiced on a large scale in any department\r\nof the government. The judiciary is neither so hopelessly venal nor\r\nso inefficient as in some of the other countries, and the Supreme\r\nCourt is a body which commands general respect. The administration of\r\nthe postal and telegraph systems is fairly reliable, although it is\r\ntypically Central American in its methods and in its spirit. Conditions\r\nare nevertheless very far from what they should be. Even at the present\r\ntime, under a president whose honesty and whose progressive ideals are\r\ndoubted by no one, public officials are too often appointed for purely\r\npersonal reasons rather than with any regard to their fitness, and\r\ngraft is practiced more or less openly in all of the departments, with\r\nthe knowledge, if not with the consent, of the higher authorities.\r\nLarge amounts of money are paid from the public treasury on different\r\npretexts to political leaders whom the administration desires to\r\nconciliate, and men of little ability or patriotism are given positions\r\nof responsibility and authority for which they are not at all fitted,\r\nand in which their conduct is not infrequently scandalous. These\r\nconditions are to a great extent beyond the control of the government,\r\nfor an administration which failed to consolidate its power by such\r\nmethods probably could not maintain itself very long in office. The\r\nold-style professional revolutionists, many of whom have a considerable\r\nfollowing among the lower and middle classes, are still too powerful to\r\nbe disregarded, and the idea that offices and graft are the legitimate\r\nrewards of political activity is no less paramount than formerly. There\r\nis every prospect, however, that political conditions will improve as\r\nthe government becomes more stable, and as public opinion, already a\r\npowerful influence for good, becomes more enlightened and exerts more\r\ncontrol over the factional leaders.\r\n\r\nEconomically, Salvador is one of the most prosperous countries of the\r\nIsthmus. Her principal product is coffee, grown on the slopes of all\r\nthe higher volcanoes and hills, which is exported to the amount of\r\nfrom sixty to seventy million pounds annually to France, the United\r\nStates, and other countries. In the lower parts of the country, there\r\nare many large cattle ranches and cane plantations, which produce meat\r\nand sugar for local consumption. Corn is raised everywhere, even more\r\nthan in other parts of Central America, because of the denseness of\r\nthe population and because of the large _per capita_ consumption. One\r\nsmall section of the Pacific Coast, called _La Costa del Bálsamo_, is\r\nnotable for its exports of balsam of Peru, a forest product which is\r\nfound in its wild state only in this one spot.[20] The trees from\r\nwhich this medicinal gum is extracted have within recent years been\r\nbrought under systematic care in large plantations, and have proved a\r\nsource of considerable wealth to the native capitalists, as well as to\r\nthe Indians who collect the balsam in the forest by primitive methods.\r\n\r\nThe upper classes are as enterprising and progressive as any social\r\ngroup in Central America. A large proportion of them have traveled\r\nabroad and have adopted foreign ways of living at home, and as a\r\nwhole they have shown a responsiveness to new ideas and an energy and\r\npatriotism which promises much for the future of their country. The\r\nowners of the large plantations live in the cities, but they take a\r\ndeep interest in the management and development of their properties,\r\nand usually spend a portion of the year upon them. Few are free from\r\nthe Central American tendency to extravagance and improvidence, but\r\nthey have nevertheless been sufficiently enterprising and progressive\r\nto maintain their dominant position in the economic life of the country\r\nwhile the resources of the other republics have been falling more and\r\nmore into the hands of Europeans and North Americans. There are some\r\nrich agriculturalists who are foreigners, but they are relatively few\r\nas compared with those in Guatemala and Nicaragua. The great majority\r\nof the more valuable plantations still belong to citizens of Salvador,\r\nand much of the stock in the banks and in the more important industrial\r\nenterprises is controlled by native capital. This fact is of great\r\nsignificance, because it indicates that the people of the Republic have\r\nadapted themselves to modern conditions more readily than have their\r\nneighbors. The preservation of the class which furnishes the natural\r\nleaders and rulers of the community cannot but have a beneficial social\r\nand political effect.\r\n\r\nThe lower classes, housed in dirt-floored thatched huts, and subsisting\r\non a diet in which the corn _tortilla_ is the chief feature, offer\r\na striking contrast to their wealthy and Europeanized superiors,\r\nbut they are nevertheless somewhat better off than in any of the\r\nneighboring republics except Costa Rica. The majority of them have\r\nregular work on the plantations, where they are supplied with homes\r\nand food and receive wages which compare favorably with those paid in\r\nHonduras and Nicaragua. Their standard of living is somewhat higher\r\nthan in those countries, and they are in general better treated both\r\nby their employers and by the authorities. A large proportion of\r\nthe laborers on the bigger plantations are given patches of land to\r\ncultivate for themselves. In the central part of the country there are\r\nmany small landholders, who find a ready market for their products in\r\nthe cities, and are enabled by the possession of a regular money income\r\nto enjoy many little luxuries which are unknown in the more backward\r\nparts of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nIn the cities, and especially in the capital, small-scale commerce\r\nand manufacturing are very active. Great quantities of vegetables,\r\nmilk, firewood, and other country products are daily brought into town\r\nin ox-carts by the peasants, who exchange them for the manufactured\r\narticles which they need, and the market and the countless small stores\r\nin the vicinity are always a scene of great animation. There are a\r\nnumber of little manufacturing establishments, where candles, shoes,\r\nsoap, and cigarettes are made, chiefly by hand labor, and the products\r\nof these are bought by the lower classes in surprisingly large amounts.\r\nOnly a few of the smaller commercial establishments, however, belong to\r\nnatives of the country, for the greater part of the retail trade is in\r\nthe hands of foreigners.\r\n\r\nExternal commerce has attained large proportions, despite the fact that\r\nthe Republic has no access to the Atlantic. As in the other countries\r\nof the Isthmus, there are few North American merchants; and English,\r\nGerman, and Dutch houses control the import and wholesale trade.\r\nUntil the outbreak of the European war, Salvador purchased a smaller\r\nproportion of her imports from the United States than did any of the\r\nother republics of the Isthmus, but this condition has necessarily\r\nchanged within the last two years. Of the exports, the coffee, which\r\nis the only item of first importance, is shipped to some extent to San\r\nFrancisco, but more to France and Germany.\r\n\r\nBoth external and internal commerce have been greatly aided by the fact\r\nthat the territory of the Republic is so small, and that all parts of\r\nit are so close to the Pacific Coast. The problem of transportation has\r\nnot been nearly so difficult as in some of the other countries. There\r\nare now few important towns which have no railway connection. The most\r\nimportant line is that of the Salvador Railway Company, an English\r\ncorporation which provides a cheap, rapid, and in every way excellent\r\nservice from the capital and Santa Ana to Sonsonate and Acajutla. Over\r\nthis passes the greater part of the freight and passenger traffic,\r\nfor Acajutla, although merely an open roadstead, where loading and\r\nunloading is difficult and expensive, is the principal port of the\r\nRepublic. Another line is being built by the International Railways\r\nof Central America, the American concern which operates the Guatemala\r\nsystem, from La Union on the Gulf of Fonseca to San Salvador. This\r\npasses through many important cities in the eastern departments, and\r\nhas now reached San Vicente, about forty miles from the capital.\r\nThe service is not so good, and the rates are higher than on the\r\nSalvador Railway Company’s line, and the usefulness of the road is\r\ngreatly diminished by the fact that its builders have as yet failed\r\nto construct a permanent bridge over the Lempa River, to cross which\r\nfreight and passengers must submit to a disagreeable and hazardous\r\ntransfer in scows during the rainy season. It is, however, of immense\r\nimportance to the rich sections through which it passes, and when it\r\nis completed, connecting the capital with the land-locked harbor of\r\nLa Union, it will not only provide a new outlet for the commerce of\r\nSalvador, but will also open a much more rapid and convenient route\r\nto Honduras and Nicaragua, which are reached in a few hours by water\r\nfrom La Union. The same company plans to build a line from Santa Ana\r\nto Zacapa, on the Guatemala Railway, which will make both San Salvador\r\nand La Union accessible directly by railway from Puerto Barrios on the\r\nAtlantic. When this is done, the journey from the United States to each\r\nof the three central republics of the Isthmus will be shortened by\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nBesides the ports mentioned, Salvador possesses two others. La\r\nLibertad, immediately south of the capital but separated from it by a\r\nsteep range of hills, is an open roadstead from which a large amount of\r\ncoffee produced in the neighborhood is shipped. El Triunfo, on a rather\r\nshallow bay east of the Lempa River, is close to another coffee-growing\r\ndistrict, but it will have to be greatly improved before it can be made\r\na regular port of call for large steamers. Both of these are connected\r\nwith their tributary country by cart roads, which are good in the dry\r\nseason, but become very bad when it rains.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere on the Pacific Coast of Central America, there has been\r\nhardly any steamship service at these ports since the beginning of the\r\nEuropean war except that of the Pacific Mail, whose ships touch there\r\nat irregular intervals and afford expensive and rather unsatisfactory\r\naccommodations for freight and passengers. The Pacific Steam Navigation\r\nCompany also operates one small steamer, formerly the property of the\r\nSalvador Railway Company, between Panama and Salina Cruz, stopping at\r\nmost of the ports on the way, and the government of Salvador owns a\r\nstill smaller vessel which plies between the ports of the Republic and\r\nSan José, Guatemala. Salvador suffers far more from the inadequacy of\r\nthe West Coast steamship service than do any of the other countries,\r\nfor Guatemala and Costa Rica have excellent connections with the United\r\nStates and Europe by way of their Atlantic ports, and Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras have comparatively a small amount of foreign commerce. The\r\nRepublic will not be able to develop as it should until its connections\r\nwith the outside world are greatly improved.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Salvador and the United States have never been\r\nso close as in the case of those republics where more American capital\r\nhas been invested and where regular and direct steamer communications\r\nhave encouraged commerce and travel; and in recent years the friendship\r\nbetween the two countries has been endangered, although it has by no\r\nmeans been destroyed, by political questions. The influence exerted\r\nby the United States in the internal politics of some of the nearby\r\ncountries, especially in the case of Nicaragua, and the proposal\r\nto establish an American naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca, close\r\nto the port of La Union, have greatly alarmed public sentiment in\r\nSalvador, and have called forth strong but ineffectual protests from\r\nher government. This fear of what the people of the Republic regard\r\nas American tendencies towards expansion has caused a rather marked\r\ndistrust and dislike of the United States among certain classes,--a\r\nfeeling which can be dispelled only by the most careful regard for\r\nCentral American rights and susceptibilities in the future. With\r\nfrankness and fair treatment on both sides, however, the relations\r\nbetween the two republics are bound to grow more friendly as they grow\r\ncloser; for the influence of the increasingly large number of natives\r\nof Salvador who travel and study in North America, and of the Americans\r\nwho are now in Salvador, should do much to bring about a better\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe prospect for the future of Salvador seems very bright. Political\r\nand social conditions are improving steadily, and the prosperity of\r\nthe Republic, with its fertile soil and industrious population,\r\nseems secure. The progressive spirit of the ruling classes and their\r\nrapid absorption of foreign ideas afford reason to believe that the\r\ncontrol of the economic life of the country by foreign interests,\r\nwhich is becoming more and more marked elsewhere in the Isthmus, may\r\nhere be avoided. The introduction of foreign capital is of course very\r\nnecessary for the development of the country, as is the immigration of\r\nforeigners of the better class, but it is to be hoped that this may\r\ntake place without resulting in the impoverishment and the decay of\r\nthe leading native families. If the best people of the Republic can\r\ncontinue in the future to play the part which they play at present in\r\npolitics and agriculture, the little country promises to remain one of\r\nthe most prosperous and most civilized states in tropical America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] It should be noted that the Isthmus is bounded by the Atlantic\r\non the north and the Pacific on the south in Guatemala, Salvador, and\r\nHonduras, whereas the former ocean lies east and the latter west of\r\nNicaragua and Costa Rica.\r\n\r\n[19] According to figures furnished to me by Sr. Juan Lainez, Director\r\nof Primary Instruction, there are 245,251 children between the ages of\r\nsix and fourteen in Salvador, of whom 60,860 are enrolled in public and\r\nprivate schools. The average attendance is considerably less than the\r\nnumber enrolled. The budget for Public Instruction for the year 1916\r\nwas $1,205,074.44, or approximately $408,000 in U. S. currency.\r\n\r\n[20] It has been introduced into Ceylon. _Encyclopædia Brittanica_,\r\narticle on “Balsam.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                               HONDURAS\r\n\r\n General Description--History--Effects of Continual Civil War--Lack of\r\n Means of Communication--Backwardness of the People--The North Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe territory of Honduras may be roughly described as a triangle, the\r\nbase of which is formed by the shore of the Caribbean Sea, and the\r\nother sides by the Guatemala-Salvador boundary on the southwest and\r\nby that of Nicaragua on the southeast. At the apex, on the south,\r\nthere are a few miles of coast on the Gulf of Fonseca which give\r\nthe Republic its only outlet on the Pacific. The country is very\r\nmountainous, but, unlike its neighbors, is in no part of volcanic\r\norigin, for the chain of craters which elsewhere traverses the Isthmus\r\nseveral miles inland from the coast passes by Honduras through the\r\nconical islands of the Gulf of Fonseca, leaving the mainland entirely\r\noutside of the belt of decomposed tufas which forms the most fertile\r\nagricultural districts of other parts of Central America. There are\r\nthus none of the rich eruptive plains and gently sloping mountainsides\r\nwhich have encouraged the establishment of the great coffee and sugar\r\nplantations of Guatemala and Salvador and have made it possible for\r\nthe regions near the Pacific Coast in all of the other countries to\r\nsupport dense populations. The southern portion of Honduras is occupied\r\nby a series of rugged mountain chains, where only small amounts of\r\nland in the valleys are suitable for cultivation and the rainfall is\r\nscanty and irregular. The first Spanish settlements were established\r\nin this district, notwithstanding the difficulties of raising food\r\nand transporting supplies from the outside world, because of the\r\ngold and silver mines, which in colonial times made Honduras one of\r\nthe most important provinces of the Isthmus; and when the mines were\r\nabandoned, during the years of anarchy which followed the declaration\r\nof independence, the inhabitants still clung to their decayed villages\r\nand supported themselves as well as they could by agriculture. North of\r\nthe continental divide, the mountains are lower and less precipitous,\r\nand there are great stretches of open savannahs and pine-covered\r\nhills, where the rainfall is plentiful and the grass is green at all\r\nseasons of the year. The soil is not very fertile, except in the river\r\nbottoms, but the region is admirably adapted for the raising of cattle.\r\nThe cities of the south and of the interior are still the center of\r\nthe political life of the country, but since the development of the\r\nbanana trade they have been rapidly outstripped in economic importance\r\nby the newer towns created by foreign enterprise on the North Coast.\r\nThe region near the Caribbean Sea is a low plain, extending for many\r\nmiles into the interior, traversed by scattered mountain ranges and by\r\nseveral large, slow-flowing rivers. Here there are many settlements of\r\nNorth Americans, West Indian negroes, and natives, who are occupied\r\nchiefly with the cultivation of bananas.\r\n\r\nThe people are a mixed race. Spanish is the only language, and\r\nCatholicism the only religion, but even in the cities there are few\r\npersons who are entirely white, and in the country districts, although\r\nthere are almost no pure-blooded Indians except on the uncivilized\r\nMosquito Coast, the majority of the inhabitants have far more American\r\nand African than European blood. The aborigines of Honduras were never\r\nso numerous or so civilized as those of Guatemala, Salvador, and\r\nNicaragua, and they were exterminated after the conquest to a somewhat\r\ngreater extent than in those countries because of the hard labor in the\r\nmines; but their characteristics are nevertheless those which are most\r\nmarked in the half-breed population of today. Negro blood also is very\r\nevident in the people in the regions north of the continental divide,\r\nand in many places, especially near the coast, seems to predominate\r\nover the other racial constituents. It was far easier for runaway West\r\nIndian slaves and other immigrants of the same color to reach the\r\ninterior from the Caribbean Coast of Honduras than elsewhere in the\r\nIsthmus, because the country back of the coast line was more open and\r\nmore attractive, to them, on account of its warm climate. What effect\r\nthis element has had on the development of the Republic it is difficult\r\nto say, but it is possible that it may account in some measure for the\r\nbackwardness of most of the regions in which it is found.\r\n\r\nThe central position of Honduras has forced her, whether she wished to\r\nor not, to take part in nearly every international conflict which has\r\noccurred in the Isthmus; and the continual intervention of her stronger\r\nneighbors in her internal affairs, combined with factional hatred and\r\ngreed for the spoils of office on the part of her own citizens, have\r\nkept the Republic in a state of chronic disorder down to the present\r\ntime. Because of the economic backwardness and the isolation of her\r\npeople, she has been affected comparatively little by the factors\r\nwhich have in recent years tended to discourage internal disorder and\r\ncivil strife in Salvador. Her government has never become so strong\r\nthat it was able to repel aggression from without or to hold in check\r\nits enemies at home, and no part of her territory, with the possible\r\nexception of the North Coast, has reached a stage of agricultural or\r\nindustrial development sufficiently high to give rise to a class of\r\nplantation owners or capitalists more interested in the maintenance\r\nof peace than in the dominance of one or the other political faction.\r\nShe does not enjoy the favorable climate and the fertile soil which\r\nhave encouraged the development of the great agricultural enterprises\r\nof the neighboring states, and she has been prevented from using the\r\nvery valuable natural resources which she does possess by constant\r\ndisturbances promoted both by external and by domestic enemies.\r\n\r\nDissensions within the country broke out soon after the authority\r\nof Spain was thrown off in 1821. The Spanish governor at Comayagua,\r\nwho had already repudiated the authority of the Captain General in\r\nGuatemala, was opposed by the people of Tegucigalpa and several\r\nother towns, and his attempts to establish his supremacy were the\r\nbeginning of a desultory conflict which lasted with few intermissions\r\nfor a number of years. After the establishment of the Federal Union,\r\nComayagua sided with the Conservatives and Tegucigalpa with the\r\nLiberals, and an army from the latter city, led by Morazán, played\r\na large part in defending Salvador and in overthrowing the federal\r\nauthorities in 1829. The triumph of the revolution in Guatemala led\r\nto the establishment of a Liberal state government in Honduras, but\r\nthis fell after the disruption of the Union, when President Carrera\r\nof Guatemala aided the Conservatives to return to power (1840). From\r\nthat time until 1911, the Republic was kept in a state of turmoil\r\nby a series of revolutions and civil wars, instigated and often\r\nactively participated in by Guatemala, Salvador, or Nicaragua, and\r\nsometimes by all three. Francisco Ferrer, supported by Carrera, held\r\nthe supreme power from 1840 to 1852, first as president and then as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army. His successor was Trinidad Cabañas, a\r\nLiberal, who had been in office only three years when Carrera sent an\r\narmy into the country to supplant him by Santos Guardiola. This ruler\r\nwas assassinated in 1862. His successor, allying himself to Salvador,\r\nbecame involved in a war against Guatemala and Nicaragua, and the\r\nvictory of the two latter states resulted in the “election” of José\r\nMaría Medina as president of Honduras. He was overthrown in 1872 by\r\nthe intervention of the Liberals who had just returned to power in\r\nGuatemala and Salvador. Ponciano Leíva assumed the chief magistracy\r\nin the following year, but was forced to relinquish it in 1876 by the\r\nintrigues of President Barrios of Guatemala. Marco Aurelio Soto, a\r\nman of ability and great influence, succeeded him, but he was also\r\nforced to resign in 1883 because of the hostile attitude of Barrios,\r\nand was succeeded by Luís Bográn, who held office until 1891. Ponciano\r\nLeíva, who followed Bográn, was again forced to resign in 1893 by a\r\nthreatened revolution. His successor, Domingo Vásquez, was overthrown\r\na year later as the result of a disastrous war with Nicaragua, and\r\nPolicarpo Bonilla, an ally of President Zelaya and an ardent Liberal,\r\nbecame president. After one constitutional term, he turned over his\r\noffice to General Terencio Sierra. Sierra was overthrown in 1903 by\r\nManuel Bonilla, who had started a revolution when the president made an\r\nattempt to impose on the country a successor of his own choosing.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, as the result of a quarrel between Bonilla and President\r\nZelaya of Nicaragua, the latter sent an army into Honduras to aid a\r\nrevolutionary movement headed by Miguel Dávila. Salvador, fearing the\r\nincrease of Zelaya’s influence, came to the aid of Bonilla, but was\r\nunable to prevent the complete victory of the revolution. Zelaya now\r\nthreatened to attack Salvador, and the president of that country,\r\nin league with Guatemala, prepared to support a counter revolution\r\nin Honduras. A general Central American war would undoubtedly have\r\nfollowed, had not the United States and Mexico jointly interposed their\r\nmediation and suggested that all of the republics of the Isthmus send\r\nrepresentatives to Washington to discuss the questions at issue between\r\nthem. This was the origin of the celebrated Washington Conference. One\r\nof the most important conventions adopted by the delegates of the five\r\ncountries provided for the complete neutralization of Honduras and the\r\nabstention of her government from all participation in the conflicts\r\nbetween the other governments of the Isthmus.[21]\r\n\r\nThis treaty had little effect for the time being on the situation of\r\nHonduras, for nearby countries encouraged and materially assisted\r\na number of uprisings against the government of Dávila during the\r\nfour years following 1907. Zelaya helped his ally to suppress these,\r\nbut when the Nicaraguan dictator himself fell the fate of the\r\nadministration which he had protected in Honduras was sealed. Manuel\r\nBonilla invaded the Republic from the North Coast in the latter part\r\nof 1910, and decisively defeated Dávila’s troops after a few weeks of\r\nfighting. When it was evident that the revolutionists were gaining\r\nthe upper hand, a peace conference was arranged through the mediation\r\nof the United States, and both factions agreed to place the control\r\nof affairs provisionally in the hands of Dr. Francisco Bertrand. In\r\nthe election which followed, Bonilla was made president by an almost\r\nunanimous vote. He held office until his death in 1913, when Dr.\r\nBertrand, the vice-president, succeeded him. The latter is still at the\r\nhead of affairs, having been reëlected in 1915.\r\n\r\nToday, more than ever before, there seems to be good reason to hope\r\nthat Honduras may enjoy a long period of peace. A large part of the\r\npeople are wearied of the continual disturbance in which they have\r\nlived, and are beginning to distrust the factional leaders who have\r\nhitherto been able to incite them to revolt at every unpopular or\r\naggressive action of the authorities. The government of Dr. Bertrand\r\nhas pursued a conciliatory policy towards all political elements, and\r\nby treating its enemies with far less severity than has been customary\r\nin the past has given them little excuse for rebellion. The so-called\r\nparties of today have become little more than groups of professional\r\noffice-seekers, without programs or permanent organizations. While\r\nmany of the causes of discord at home have thus been removed, the\r\nexternal influences which have hitherto made stable government\r\nimpossible have lost much of their importance in the last four years.\r\nThe other governments have been prevented from encouraging or allowing\r\nthe preparation in their territory of revolutionary expeditions against\r\nHonduras, or from intervening themselves in the internal affairs of\r\ntheir neighbor, by the attitude of the United States. The decisive\r\nintervention of that Republic in the last revolution in Nicaragua\r\nand the intimation, by a timely show of force, when outbreaks were\r\nthreatened elsewhere, that similar action might be taken if it proved\r\nnecessary, have had a salutary effect on potential revolutionists in\r\nall of the states of the Isthmus, for there are few Central American\r\npolitical leaders who desire to see the events of 1912 repeated in\r\ntheir own countries.\r\n\r\nThe government of Honduras has always been and is today a military\r\ndespotism where all branches of the administration are under the\r\nabsolute control of the president. Graft and favoritism are as much\r\nin evidence as in the neighboring countries, and the public offices,\r\noccupied exclusively by the friends of those in power, are swept clean\r\nand refilled after each successful revolution. Nevertheless, the\r\ncountry has had a series of able and patriotic presidents, who have\r\ndone what they could, with the scanty resources at their command and\r\nin the face of very great difficulties, to encourage agriculture and\r\ncommerce. Very real progress has been made in the field of education,\r\nand recently in the building of roads, and that more has not been\r\naccomplished has been due to the poverty of the national treasury, the\r\nwaste of revenues by civil wars, and the deep-ingrained practice of\r\ngraft in the public offices, rather than to any lack of progressive\r\nspirit. The idea of enriching themselves at the expense of the public\r\nis so much a part of the creed of the professional politicians who\r\nform the bulk of each party and the backbone of the revolutions\r\nto which each successive government owes its existence that it is\r\nimpossible even for a president of the highest civic ideals to devote\r\nthe entire resources of the government to internal improvements.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the disorder and misrule from which the Republic has\r\nsuffered for nearly a century are most clearly evident in the southern\r\ndepartments and the interior, which are the home of the majority\r\nof the people. The mines, in which many of the inhabitants of the\r\nprovince had been employed in colonial times, were abandoned soon\r\nafter the declaration of independence, and those who were dependent\r\nupon them were left to make a living as best they could. A large\r\nnumber joined the factional armies, which were hardly disbanded during\r\nthe lifetime of the Central American Federation. Others turned their\r\nattention to agriculture or cattle raising, but did little more than\r\nsecure a bare subsistence, working under a great disadvantage because\r\nof the impossibility of transporting their products to a market,\r\nand constantly facing ruin from the visits of revolutionary armies.\r\nThose who tilled the soil confined themselves to producing small\r\namounts of corn, beans, and sugar from year to year for their own\r\nconsumption. Conditions were more unfavorable for the establishment of\r\nlarge plantations than they had been in the other countries, because\r\nrevolutions were more continuous and more destructive, and because\r\nthere was in Honduras comparatively little land suitable for the\r\ncultivation of coffee, indigo, or sugar for export. The raising of\r\ncattle, which might otherwise have been carried on under very favorable\r\nconditions, especially in the open, grassy valleys of the Olancho, was\r\nmade all but impossible by the civil wars, for no one suffers more from\r\nthe passing of a Central American army than the herdsman. There are\r\nindeed many ranches in the interior and on the South Coast at present,\r\nbut they are run carelessly and with primitive methods. The owners,\r\nwho have lost a large part of their stock time after time by military\r\nrequisitions or by confiscation, make no effort to introduce animals of\r\na better breed from abroad or to give their cattle more than the most\r\nelementary care, leaving the herds to wander in an almost wild state\r\nover great stretches of land, and only interesting themselves in them\r\nwhen they have occasion to drive a few hundred head to market. A slight\r\nchange in this respect is even now noticeable, however, for some of\r\nthe landowners are beginning to pay more attention to the welfare of\r\ntheir stock and to fence in and otherwise improve their properties. If\r\nthe Republic enjoys a few more years of peace, and if a better market\r\ncan be provided abroad for live animals or beef, Honduras might easily\r\nbecome the most important cattle-raising country of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nMany of the mines were reopened by promoters from the United States\r\nin the last quarter of the nineteenth century, but the majority were\r\nabandoned a few years later because of the decline of the price of\r\nsilver, which was the chief product. At the present time there are a\r\nnumber of companies and individuals extracting the precious metals on\r\na small scale, but the only plant of real importance is that of the\r\nNew York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company at San Juancito, near\r\nTegucigalpa. The silver shipped by this one firm comprises almost\r\nthe only important export of the southern departments, and nearly\r\ntwenty-five per cent of the total exports of the Republic. There are\r\nvery great undeveloped mineral resources, and many new mines would\r\ndoubtless be opened if the difficulty of transporting machinery into\r\nthe interior could be overcome, and if the political conditions of the\r\nRepublic should be made sufficiently stable to encourage the investment\r\nof foreign capital.\r\n\r\nOne of the factors which has done most to retard the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country is the lack of means of communication.\r\nTegucigalpa is now the only Central American capital which is not\r\nconnected with at least one seaport by railway. Even ox-carts\r\ncan be used only in a very few places in the interior, for the\r\nconstruction of roads between the principal centers of population\r\nhas been more difficult than elsewhere in the Isthmus because of\r\nthe greater distances to be traversed and the broken character of\r\nthe country. The chief towns of the Republic are scattered from the\r\nGuatemalan to the Nicaraguan frontier and from the North Coast to\r\nthe South, and the mountain ranges between them, although not so\r\nhigh as in the neighboring countries, are often so sharp and rugged\r\nthat they are difficult to cross even on mule back. As has already\r\nbeen said, moreover, the expenditure of the energies of the people\r\nand the financial resources of the government on civil war has made\r\nit impossible to devote much attention to internal improvements.\r\nTransportation between the different sections, therefore, is\r\nprincipally by rough mule trails, but there is nevertheless one\r\nsplendid highway, from Tegucigalpa to San Lorenzo on the Gulf of\r\nFonseca, which has no equal in Central America. The regular services of\r\nmotor cars and trucks on this route have greatly reduced the difficulty\r\nof transporting freight and passengers between the capital and its port\r\nof entry at Amapala, although the rates charged are exceedingly high,\r\neven as compared with those charged on Central American railways.[22]\r\nSimilar roads are now being constructed, very slowly, from Tegucigalpa\r\nto Comayagua and to the Olancho, but they are so expensive to build and\r\nto maintain that it seems likely to be many years before those sections\r\nof the country will enjoy communication by automobile with the capital.\r\n\r\nTegucigalpa, with the nearby municipality of Comayagüela, is a\r\nprosperous little town, with a thriving commerce and many families\r\nof wealth and culture, but outside of the capital, if we except half\r\na dozen foreign settlements on the North Coast, there are few places\r\nwhich show any signs of contact with modern civilization. The majority\r\nof the people reside in the provincial cities, which are decayed\r\nvillages of from three to five thousand inhabitants, or in still more\r\ndesolate smaller settlements. There are also thousands of families\r\nscattered through the mountains, living in thatched _ranchos_, and\r\nsubsisting almost entirely on the produce from their cornfields and\r\nplantain patches. Even the more important towns are almost entirely\r\nisolated economically and socially. A small amount of internal commerce\r\nis carried on by means of mule trains, and the mails are carried to\r\nalmost all of the towns and villages with tolerable frequency and\r\nregularity, but the great mass of the people have little interest\r\nin anything outside of the community in which they live, and little\r\nconception of a world beyond the boundaries of their own country.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that people living under such conditions should\r\nhave advanced little in civilization beyond their savage ancestors.\r\nEven those who might have risen above their environment, had they had\r\nthe opportunity, have been kept down by almost insuperable obstacles.\r\nThere is no incentive to improve agricultural properties, or to lay up\r\na store of products for possible future needs, when all that a man has\r\nis likely to be taken from him at any time, and there is no object in\r\nraising more produce than is required for the support of the farmer’s\r\nfamily when there is no market in which it can be sold or exchanged\r\nfor other goods. It is dangerous and expensive to transport products\r\nfrom one part of the country to another where they may be needed, and\r\nthere are few articles which the peasant can purchase when he does\r\nsecure ready money. Little is manufactured in the country, and imports\r\nfrom abroad, by the time they have borne the heavy freights from North\r\nAmerica and Europe via Panama to Amapala, the exorbitant charges of\r\nboatmen, brokers, and customs officials at that port, and the expense\r\nof transporting them into the interior, are beyond the reach of any but\r\nthe rich. In the interior, one may ride in some places for days without\r\npassing a place where articles manufactured abroad can be bought, and\r\nthose commercial establishments which do exist, outside of Tegucigalpa,\r\ncarry only the most inferior textiles, machetes, and other necessities,\r\ntogether with a few very cheap articles of personal adornment, at\r\nprices from three to five times those which would be demanded for the\r\nsame things in the United States.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions have inevitably condemned the people to a hand-to-mouth\r\nexistence, which has eradicated all tendency to thrift. Improvidence,\r\nwhich seems to be an inborn characteristic of the Spanish-Negro-Indian\r\npopulation, has been encouraged by the ease with which the corn and\r\nbeans necessary to support even a large family can be produced, for\r\nthere is an abundance of unoccupied land in most parts of the country\r\nwhich can be cultivated with little labor by the primitive methods in\r\nvogue, and which will usually produce at least two crops each year.\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that the people should lead an easy, if not\r\nan interesting existence, but the very conditions which have made\r\nit possible for them to secure a living with little difficulty have\r\ncontributed to make them in some ways the poorest and most miserable of\r\nthe _ladino_ populations of the Isthmus. Unaccustomed to hard work or\r\nto taking thought for the future, they rarely plant more corn during\r\nthe rainy season than is barely necessary to last them through the\r\ndry months, so that a drought or other mishap to their crops causes\r\nwidespread want and suffering, aggravated by the difficulty of bringing\r\nfood from other parts of the country where it may be abundant. There is\r\nno other inhabited part of Central America where the traveler finds it\r\nso hard to secure provender for himself and his mule as he does in most\r\nparts of Honduras during April and May.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, the people are densely ignorant and\r\nunprogressive. Schools have been established in many of the towns\r\nand villages, but the percentage of illiteracy in the community as\r\na whole seems to be very high. Religion is at a low ebb, although\r\none section of the Republic, around Comayagua, seems to be the most\r\nfanatically Catholic portion of Central America. Outside of the\r\nlarger towns, there are almost no priests, and the people, although\r\nsuperstitious, pay little attention to the precepts of the Church. It\r\nmust not be supposed, however, that the Honduraneans are necessarily\r\ninferior, intellectually or physically, to the inhabitants of the other\r\nrepublics. They are naturally quick and intelligent, and they are said\r\nto be as efficient laborers as any of the other Central Americans.\r\nForeign mining corporations in all parts of the Isthmus prefer them\r\nto the inhabitants of any of the other countries as workmen, not only\r\nbecause of their greater skill, but because of their comparative\r\ntrustworthiness. There is every prospect that they will advance rapidly\r\nin civilization when their country is brought into closer contact with\r\nthe outside world.\r\n\r\nThe economic backwardness of the country, which is in itself an effect\r\nof the civil wars, is at the same time one of their causes. The great\r\nmajority of the people have little to lose by internal disorders, for\r\nthere are few who own more than a cheaply constructed adobe house and\r\na small corn patch. They welcome a revolution, with its opportunity\r\nfor plunder and for living at someone else’s expense, as an agreeable\r\nchange from the monotony of their lives and an opportunity temporarily\r\nto improve their condition. Among the upper classes in the cities,\r\nmany of whom devote themselves to politics rather than to more useful\r\noccupations because neither large scale agricultural or commercial\r\nenterprises nor the learned professions afford a secure income, there\r\nis always a large number of discontented office-seekers, ready to\r\nengage in any kind of intrigue which offers an opportunity to make a\r\nliving at the public’s expense. The organization of a revolutionary\r\nconspiracy is thus an easy matter, and the raising of an army among\r\nthe common people is hardly more difficult. Money and arms are secured\r\nfrom foreign corporations which desire special favors, and material\r\nand moral support can almost always be obtained from one of the other\r\nCentral American governments. With so many circumstances in their\r\nfavor, it is not remarkable that the party leaders have been able\r\ntime after time to plunge the country into civil war, sacrificing its\r\nwelfare to their own ambitions and rivalries, and frustrating the\r\nefforts made by their more patriotic and far-sighted fellow-citizens to\r\nimprove their country’s economic and social conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough at least eighty per cent of her people live in the central\r\nand southern departments, the most important portion of Honduras, from\r\nthe point of view of the outside world, is the long coast line on the\r\nCaribbean Sea. This region is not only more productive than other parts\r\nof the Republic, because of its fertile soil and heavy rainfall, but\r\nit also has the immense advantage of being close to the Gulf ports of\r\nthe United States, with which it is in regular communication by means\r\nof several lines of fast steamers. In recent years, its agricultural\r\npossibilities have been developed on a large scale by immigrants and\r\ncapital from that country. Its ports, where English is the language\r\nmost generally used and American influence is predominant, have become\r\nprosperous commercial towns, and one of them, La Ceiba, is the most\r\nimportant city in the Republic, after Tegucigalpa, and has more foreign\r\ncommerce than all of the interior districts together.\r\n\r\nThe native element on the Coast is somewhat larger than in the similar\r\nsections of Guatemala and Costa Rica, because the government has\r\nopposed certain legal obstacles to the free immigration of West Indian\r\nnegroes. This policy has enabled other sections to profit to some\r\ndegree from the prosperity of the banana farms, because many laborers\r\nfrom the interior spend longer or shorter periods working there,\r\nearning wages far greater than they could secure at home. There is\r\nlittle commercial intercourse between the two sections of the country,\r\nhowever, as the roads which unite them are not suitable to any traffic\r\nother than pack and saddle mules. Travelers frequently make the\r\njourney from the United States to Tegucigalpa by the overland route,\r\nand the mails are brought over regularly from the weekly steamers\r\nwhich touch at Puerto Cortez, but almost none of the exportations or\r\nimportations of the interior are shipped through the Caribbean ports.\r\nThe North Coast had until lately little political connection with the\r\nother departments of the Republic, but within the last few years the\r\ngovernment has established civilian officials and military forces\r\nthere, and has endeavored to strengthen the feeling of allegiance among\r\nits inhabitants. The people of the banana district, and especially the\r\nforeign residents, have played an important part in recent revolutions,\r\nmost of which have had one of the Caribbean ports as a base.\r\n\r\nThe bananas which are the principal product of the coast are raised\r\nand exported by numerous small growers and by a few great fruit\r\ncompanies, each of which possesses its own line of steamers and\r\ncontrols the agriculture and commerce of the district in which it\r\noperates. These concerns, nominally independent and competing, are\r\ngenerally supposed to be closely connected with, if not under the\r\ncontrol of, the United Fruit Company, which itself has plantations\r\nand buys fruit at one or two places. The “United” has for some years\r\nbeen on unfriendly terms with the Honduranean government, and it is\r\nsaid that it prefers for this reason to operate through supposedly\r\nunrelated subsidiaries, which are in a better position than it could\r\nbe to obtain concessions and privileges at Tegucigalpa. Most of these\r\nfruit companies have obtained concessions from the government under\r\nthe terms of which they agree to build a railroad from the North\r\nCoast to some point in the interior, and receive in return the right\r\nto appropriate for their own use amounts of land varying from 250 to\r\n500 hectares (that is, from 617.5 to 1,235 acres) for every kilometer\r\nconstructed along the main line and its branches. They are allowed to\r\nimprove the ports to which their steamers sail and to build wharves\r\nfor the use of which they charge a fee to other exporters. The object\r\nof the government in making these contracts has been to provide means\r\nof communication between the Atlantic ports and the interior towns,\r\nwith the idea of extending the railroads eventually to the capital,\r\nbut the fruit companies, interested merely in securing land suitable\r\nfor the planting of bananas, have usually built only those sections\r\nof their lines which are in low, flat country, and when this has\r\nbeen accomplished have turned their attention to the construction of\r\nbranches through districts of the same kind. Most of them are under\r\nobligations to extend the railways to the interior towns within a\r\ncertain term of years, but the government seems so far to have been\r\nunable to find means to give effect to this part of the contracts.\r\nThe desire to secure railway communication between the capital and\r\nthe North Coast has been so strong that valuable and far-reaching\r\nprivileges have often been granted, with little consideration and\r\nwith no effective safeguards, to companies which have promised more\r\nthan they had any intention of carrying out; and other concessions,\r\noften actually prejudicial to the interests of the Republic, have\r\nbeen secured occasionally by foreigners who have aided revolutionary\r\nleaders in securing control of the government. Because of the lessons\r\nlearned through many hard experiences with unscrupulous promoters,\r\nhowever, the native authorities are much more cautious of late about\r\ninvestigating the character and financial standing of persons applying\r\nto them for favors, and the majority of the contracts recently entered\r\ninto have been more equitable in their terms and more explicit in their\r\nprovisions than those of former years.\r\n\r\nThe North Coast not only exports bananas, but also small quantities\r\nof lumber, cattle, rubber, and other products. Special concessions\r\nhave been granted from time to time for cutting mahogany and cedar,\r\nproviding usually that the government shall receive five dollars,\r\nUnited States currency, for every tree; and contracts have been made\r\noccasionally with foreigners for the development of other natural\r\nresources. Since the beginning of the European war many of the\r\nplanters, who have been unable to export their bananas because of the\r\nwithdrawal of the steamers which had hitherto carried them to the\r\nUnited States, have turned their attention to the breeding of cattle\r\nand hogs, which thrive on the otherwise useless fruit, and which are\r\nreadily sold either in Honduras itself or in the neighboring countries.\r\nThis new industry has saved many of the foreigners along the Coast from\r\nthe ruin which in 1914 seemed inevitable, and there is every reason to\r\nsuppose that it will become more and more important in the future.\r\n\r\nThe commercial relations of Honduras with the outside world are small\r\nas compared with some of the neighboring countries. The chief exports,\r\nand almost the only ones which reach large amounts, are the bananas\r\nfrom the foreign-owned plantations on the North Coast and the silver\r\nfrom the one large mine already mentioned. The coffee crop, cultivated\r\nby primitive methods on small patches of ground, little more than\r\nsuffices to supply the local demand. Other products,--hides, lumber,\r\ncocoanuts, etc.,--are shipped abroad in comparatively small amounts.\r\nThe imports differ little in character from those of the other Central\r\nAmerican countries. Their amount is small because the people have no\r\ncrop which provides them with money for the purchase of foreign goods.\r\nThe imports somewhat exceed the exports at the present time because of\r\nthe railway material and mining machinery which is being brought in by\r\nforeign investors, and because a certain amount of goods is undoubtedly\r\nbeing paid for every year under present conditions by the shipment\r\nabroad of silver coin. By far the largest part of the Republic’s trade\r\nis with the United States, and more than half of it is carried on\r\nthrough the North Coast ports, which have regular steamer connection\r\nwith New Orleans and Mobile. The interior and the South Coast, which\r\nhave no outlet at the present time except through Amapala, have few\r\nexports, and can buy little from foreign countries because of their\r\npoverty and because the expense of transporting goods from Amapala to\r\nthe capital and from there to the interior towns is so great that most\r\nimported articles are far beyond the reach of the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the poverty which characterizes Honduras today, her future\r\nis not necessarily less promising than that of other parts of Central\r\nAmerica. Her people are not backward because they are degenerate,\r\nbut because they have been prevented from developing the natural\r\nresources of their country by the lack of means of transportation\r\nand by continual civil war. As has already been stated, they are by\r\nno means lacking in intelligence or ability. The country itself,\r\nperhaps, does not enjoy the natural advantages which have brought\r\nabout the prosperity of some of its coffee-growing neighbors, but it\r\nnevertheless possesses great fertile tracts which are as yet hardly\r\nexplored, and great undeveloped mineral resources, which will be opened\r\nto the world by the building of railways and the investment of foreign\r\ncapital, if the present era of peace continues. There is no section\r\nof the Isthmus more favorably situated for banana growing, for cattle\r\nraising, or for mining than are the northern departments of Honduras.\r\nThe Caribbean Coast, and the great plains and open valleys tributary\r\nto its ports, which are already more important commercially than the\r\nolder settlements of the interior and the southern departments, seem\r\nlikely in the near future to become the home of the larger portion of\r\nthe Republic’s inhabitants. If this occurs, and if the railways already\r\nunder construction are extended through this region into the interior,\r\nthere will be no other country of Central America so easily accessible\r\nfrom the United States and Europe, and none which should enjoy closer\r\ncommercial and cultural relations with the outside world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] For a more complete discussion of the Washington Conference, see\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\n[22] The rates charged are equivalent to $10 in gold for each\r\npassenger, and $1.20 to $1.60 per hundred pounds for freight.

The\r\npopulation is so dense in this _meseta central_, as it is called, that\r\nit is seldom possible to walk more than a few minutes without passing\r\na house. San José, Cartago, Heredia, and Alajuela, the four principal\r\ncities, are connected with one another by a single cart road less than\r\nthirty miles in length, and few of the smaller towns and villages are\r\nmore than a day’s walk from the capital. Almost every acre, in the\r\nvalley and on the sides of the mountains, is used for agricultural\r\npurposes. The people have never shown any inclination to expand into\r\nthe mountainous country to the southward, where communication with\r\nthe towns would be rather difficult, or into the hot and insalubrious\r\nregions on the coasts. The Atlantic seaboard, as in the other Central\r\nAmerican countries, is given over to banana plantations, owned and\r\nworked by foreigners; and the provinces bordering on the Pacific are\r\nsparsely inhabited by an unprogressive race who are largely of Indian\r\ndescent. Both of these districts, because of their products, are of\r\nimportance economically, but the social and political life of the\r\ncountry has its center in the cool and fertile _meseta central_.\r\n\r\nHere there has grown up a nation which is entirely different from any\r\nof the other Central American republics. The Spanish pioneers who\r\nfounded the city of Cartago in the latter part of the sixteenth century\r\nwere unable from the outset to establish a colony similar to those in\r\nother parts of the Isthmus, because there was no dense agricultural\r\npopulation to be divided up as laborers among the settlers. Elsewhere\r\nthe Indians, already living in large towns and devoting themselves\r\nto agriculture, had been forced with surprisingly little difficulty\r\nto work for their new masters; but in Costa Rica there were only a\r\nfew scattered tribes, in a low stage of civilization, who cultivated\r\nthe soil in a rude way simply to supplement their natural food supply\r\nobtained by hunting. Unaccustomed to steady labor, they were not\r\npromising material for a serf class like that existing at the time\r\nin Guatemala and Nicaragua. The settlers nevertheless introduced the\r\n_repartimiento_ system immediately after their arrival in their new\r\nhome, notwithstanding the royal order forbidding further enslavement\r\nof the Indians, and they are said to have treated those natives who\r\nwere within reach with even greater cruelty than had been practiced\r\nin the other colonies.[23] In consequence of this oppression, the\r\nnumbers of the aborigines decreased very rapidly, and the settlers\r\nfound themselves forced more and more to do their own work, in spite of\r\ntheir efforts to replenish the supply of slaves with war captives from\r\nTalamanca and other unsubjugated districts. Indian labor seems never to\r\nhave been a considerable factor in the economic life of the country.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are few remnants of the aboriginal tribes\r\nin the interior, although Indian blood is still very evident in the\r\npeople of Guanacaste and other outlying districts. The inhabitants of\r\nthe central plateau are distinctly Spanish in race and civilization.\r\nThe white families, moreover, do not seem to be of the same type as\r\nthose of Guatemala and the other countries. The majority of the people\r\nof Costa Rica, it is commonly said, are descended from _Gallegos_, one\r\nof the most law-abiding and hard-working of the numerous races that\r\noccupy the Iberian Peninsula, while those of the other countries are\r\npredominantly Andalusian. However this may be, the traveler cannot\r\navoid noticing a certain dissimilarity in appearance and in customs and\r\npersonal traits, between the prominent families of San José and those\r\nof other Central American capitals.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a large Indian population had an economic and social\r\neffect which can hardly be exaggerated. The unfortunate settlers of\r\nCosta Rica, throughout the colonial period, were in a condition which\r\ncaused them to be pitied by all of their neighbors. Instead of living\r\nin large towns, supported by tributes brought in by the Indians of\r\ntheir _encomiendas_, the majority of the creoles found themselves\r\nforced to settle in the country, where each family raised by its own\r\nlabor everything that it consumed. The harvests, as Governor Diego de\r\nla Haya reported in 1719, were gathered “with the personal labor of\r\nthe poor Spanish settlers, because of there being very few slaves in\r\nall the province.”[24] The colony was so poor that the name Costa Rica\r\nbecame a standing joke. Although there was plenty of food, clothes and\r\nother articles of European manufacture could be secured only with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, because there were no exports with which they\r\ncould be purchased. The people were almost completely shut off from the\r\noutside world. As those who could do so left the country, and there was\r\nno immigration, the population grew very slowly. The little community\r\nwas, however, spared the problems arising from the presence of a large\r\nclass of laborers of another race, and the Spaniards, although they\r\nsank into a state of dense ignorance and were forced to adopt most\r\nprimitive ways of living, acquired industrious habits which still\r\ndistinguish them from their neighbors. Each settler cultivated a small\r\namount of land, sufficient for the support of himself and his family,\r\nand was prevented from extending his holdings by his inability to\r\nemploy laborers and by the fact that he had no market for his products.\r\nWith the growth of the population, the entire _meseta central_\r\neventually became occupied by little farms. There were a few wealthy\r\nand influential families, who had been given special privileges by the\r\nSpanish government, but they never occupied the dominant position which\r\nthe aristocracy of Guatemala and Nicaragua had been able to assume, and\r\nthe land which they held never amounted to more than a small portion of\r\nthe cultivated area of the colony.\r\n\r\nIn colonial times, a large part of the land belonged to municipalities\r\nrather than to individuals. As the population expanded, it became\r\ncustomary to give to the founders of each new village a tract of land\r\nto be held for the common use, part of it to be divided among the\r\ninhabitants from time to time according to their ability to cultivate\r\nit, and part to be held as pasture or forest. In 1841 President Braulio\r\nCarillo ordered that a large portion of these _tierras ejidales_ should\r\nbecome the property of those who were at the time cultivating them.\r\nThis decree was later annulled, but a similar law was passed in 1848,\r\npermitting the cultivators to buy for a small price such parts of the\r\ncommon lands as they had fenced in and were using.[25] These measures\r\nresulted in a great increase in the number of small holdings.\r\n\r\nThe large uncultivated tracts owned by the central government have been\r\nsold at low prices to anyone who wished to buy them, or have been given\r\naway as premiums to encourage the planting of coffee or cacao. Many\r\npersons acquired large estates in this manner, especially during the\r\nlast years of the nineteenth century, and a class of large landholders\r\nhas thus gradually grown up. These have in most cases converted their\r\nproperties into coffee plantations or cattle ranches, but many large\r\ntracts have never been brought under cultivation, because their owners\r\nhave lacked the enterprise and the capital to do so. When the quantity\r\nof public lands in the more accessible parts of the country began to\r\ngrow small, attempts were made to check the reckless sale of them to\r\npersons who did not intend to turn them to account agriculturally, and\r\nto encourage their division into small holdings. The amount sold to\r\nany one purchaser was gradually reduced, and in 1909 a law was passed\r\ngiving each head of a family the right to claim fifty hectares of\r\ngovernment land, free of cost, provided that he actually settle upon\r\nit and cultivate it. The greater part of the more favorably situated\r\ndistricts, however, have now passed into private hands, and the people\r\nshow little desire to undertake the conquest of the inaccessible\r\ncountry outside of the _meseta central_. The establishment of new\r\nplantations and the opening of means of communication require more\r\nmoney and a larger labor supply than the natives of the country can\r\nprovide. For these reasons, the legislation intended to increase the\r\namount of the Republic’s territory used for agricultural purposes has\r\nnot been very successful.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are now many large plantations scattered here and there\r\nthrough the country, the greater part of the _meseta central_ is still\r\ndivided into small farms. In the year 1906, there had been inscribed\r\nin the public land register 110,201 different properties, of which the\r\naverage value was less than five hundred dollars American gold.[26]\r\nEven when allowance is made for the fact that there are many foreigners\r\nand rich natives, each of whom possesses a large number of separate\r\nproperties, it is evident that an overwhelming proportion of Costa\r\nRican families own their own homes. There is in fact practically no\r\nlandless class, with the exception of a few thousands of laborers in\r\nthe cities.\r\n\r\nThe political development of this compact community of white peasants\r\nhas necessarily been very different from that of the neighboring\r\ncountries, where a small upper class of Spanish descent had ruled and\r\nexploited many times its number of ignorant Indians and half-breeds.\r\nIn Costa Rica the fact that nearly all of the inhabitants were of the\r\nsame stock and had inherited the same civilization has always made the\r\ncountry more democratic, and has forced the class which controlled the\r\ngovernment to consider to some extent the wishes and interests of the\r\nmasses. The development of the Republic, unlike that of its neighbors,\r\nhas for this reason been toward rather than away from the realization\r\nof the republican ideals held by the framers of the first Central\r\nAmerican constitutions. The small landholders have always exerted a\r\nstrong influence on the side of peace and stable government, for they\r\nhave rarely joined in attempted revolutions, and have shown themselves\r\ninclined rather to take the part of the constituted authorities when\r\ndisaffected politicians endeavored to plunge the country into civil\r\nwar. Costa Rica has seen none of the protracted and bloody struggles\r\nwhich have darkened the history of the other republics, for the violent\r\nchanges of government which have occurred from time to time have\r\nbeen effected rather by military conspiracies in the capital than by\r\ncampaigns in the field.\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation of the Republic, moreover, has enabled it\r\nto escape from the outside influences which until very recent years\r\nmade the establishment of stable government almost impossible in other\r\nparts of Central America. At the southern extremity of the Isthmus,\r\nseparated from its nearest neighbors by several days’ travel through\r\npractically uninhabited territory, it has been able to hold aloof from\r\nthe quarrels between the other republics, and has never been forced\r\nto submit to their intervention in its internal affairs. Costa Rica\r\nseparated herself at an early date from the Central American Union,\r\nand has taken little part in the attempts for its restoration, for her\r\nstatesmen have been unwilling to yoke their destinies with those of the\r\nturbulent communities north of them.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of Central American independence, the war\r\nbetween the imperialist and republican parties in other parts of\r\nthe Isthmus had its counterpart in Costa Rica in a short struggle\r\nbetween Cartago and Heredia, which favored annexation to the Mexican\r\nEmpire, and San José and Alajuela, which opposed it. The victory of\r\nthe republicans led to the removal of the capital from Cartago to\r\nSan José, where it has since remained. For nearly half a century the\r\ngovernment was controlled by a few powerful families, among whom the\r\nmost prominent were the Montealegres and the Moras, and the number\r\nof persons who participated in public affairs was very limited. The\r\nfirst president, Juan Mora, was successful in organizing a fairly\r\nefficient administration and in promoting the almost non-existent\r\ncommerce of the country, and Braulio Carillo, who took charge of the\r\ngovernment in 1835, after two years of agitation and disorder, carried\r\non the policy of his predecessor and laid the basis for the present\r\nprosperity of the country by encouraging the production and exportation\r\nof coffee, which rapidly became the Republic’s chief crop. He also\r\ndefinitely established the capital at San José, although to do so it\r\nwas necessary to put down an armed uprising by the other towns, which\r\ndesired that the seat of the government should move from one place to\r\nanother. Carillo was defeated for re-election in 1837, but he regained\r\nhis position by a _coup d’état_ in 1838 and for four years exercised\r\ndictatorial powers. During this period, the administration was reformed\r\nand made more centralized, the courts were reorganized and a penal\r\ncode was drawn up, and Costa Rica’s share of the debt incurred by\r\nthe federal government was paid in full. Carillo was overthrown by a\r\nbloodless revolution in 1842, when Francisco Morazán, landing on the\r\nPacific Coast, won over the chiefs of the army which the president sent\r\nagainst him, and occupied the capital. The victor had hardly reached\r\nSan José when he began to raise troops and money for an attempt to\r\nre-establish the federal union, from the presidency of which he had\r\nrecently been ejected by his enemies. Angered by this attempt to force\r\nthem into a war of aggression on their neighbors, the people deposed\r\nMorazán and put him to death.\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years which followed this revolution, continual\r\nquarrels between political factions and constant interference by the\r\nmilitary leaders made it impossible for any administration long to\r\nmaintain itself in office. In 1849, however, with the election of\r\nJuan Rafael Mora, another era of stable government commenced. The\r\narmy was reduced to obedience, and order was restored throughout the\r\nRepublic. During this administration, Costa Rica took the leading part\r\nin the war against Walker in Nicaragua. Mora was overthrown in 1859\r\nby a conspiracy in San José, and two military chiefs named Blanco and\r\nSalazar, who were allied to the Montealegre and Tinoco families, came\r\ninto power. Through their influence, José María Montealegre was made\r\npresident. Mora, who had attempted an unsuccessful counter revolution,\r\nwas put to death, and the members of his family were exiled. The\r\nseverity of the government’s action aroused much bitter feeling, but\r\ncivil war was avoided by a compromise, as the result of which Jesús\r\nJiménez was elected president in 1863 and José María Castro in 1866.\r\nThe latter was deposed by a pronunciamento of Blanco and Salazar in\r\n1868, and Jiménez, as first designate, or vice-president, again took\r\ncharge of the government. The new president made a determined effort\r\nto destroy the control which the army had been exercising over the\r\nadministration, by removing Blanco and Salazar from their commands and\r\nforcing the other officers to obey the civil authorities. In doing\r\nthis, however, he deprived the small group which had controlled the\r\ngovernment for so many years of its chief support.\r\n\r\nJiménez was deposed in 1870. A handful of men boldly entered the\r\nartillery barracks, concealed in an ox-cart under a load of fodder,\r\nand seized them, and with them the control of the city, almost\r\nwithout bloodshed. The leader of the revolution was Tomás Guardia, an\r\narmy officer, who, unlike Blanco and Salazar, had little political\r\nconnection with the great families. This man was the real ruler of\r\nCosta Rica from 1870 until his death in 1882, although he did not at\r\nonce assume the presidency. His government was a repressive military\r\ndictatorship, in which his own personal followers held all of the\r\nprincipal offices. The great families, whose leaders were exiled and\r\ndeprived of their property, were reduced almost to insignificance as\r\na political factor, and have never entirely regained their former\r\ninfluence. Guardia was succeeded after his death by his close\r\nassociate, Próspero Fernández, who was at the time in command of the\r\narmy. When the latter died in 1885, his son-in-law, Bernardo Soto, took\r\ncharge of the administration as first designate, and caused himself to\r\nbe elected president for the term beginning in 1886. These two rulers\r\ndid much to improve the administration and the government finances,\r\nboth of which Guardia had left badly disorganized. The administration\r\nof Soto was especially notable because of the work of Mauro Fernández,\r\nhis Minister of Public Instruction, who for the first time established\r\nfree and compulsory education throughout the Republic. The small group\r\nwhich had been in power, however, had made many enemies, among whom\r\nthe most powerful were the clergy. The opposition grew so strong, as\r\nthe election of 1889 approached, that Soto found himself unable to\r\nimpose his own candidate on the nation without incurring serious danger\r\nof revolution. He consequently allowed the first comparatively free\r\nand popular election which the Republic had ever known, in which José\r\nJoaquín Rodríguez, the candidate of the clerical party, was victorious.\r\nMany of the partisans of the government desired to retain control of\r\nthe administration by the use of force, but they were prevented from\r\ndoing so by the firmness of the president and by the attitude of the\r\ncountry people, who rose in arms and prepared to march on the capital\r\nto enforce the verdict which they had given at the polls.\r\n\r\nRodríguez severely repressed all opposition, and governed during the\r\ngreater part of his term without the aid of Congress. In 1894 he forced\r\nthe legislature to elect his friend Rafael Yglesias to succeed him.\r\nDuring the latter’s administration, the currency was reformed and\r\nplaced on a gold basis, and the commercial and agricultural development\r\nof the country was promoted in many other ways. Yglesias was re-elected\r\nin 1898, but in 1902 he turned over the chief magistracy to Ascensión\r\nEsquivel, who had been selected by a compromise between the government\r\nand its opponents.\r\n\r\nWith the election of Esquivel began an era of republican and\r\nconstitutional government which was unprecedented in the history of\r\nCentral America. Since 1902, the Republic has enjoyed an almost\r\ncomplete freedom from internal disorder, with perfect liberty of the\r\npress, and genuine, if somewhat corrupt, elections. Cleto González\r\nVíquez, who followed Esquivel in 1906, and Ricardo Jiménez, president\r\nfrom 1910 to 1914, were chosen by a majority of the voters in contests\r\nin which practically all of the adult male population of the Republic\r\ntook part. Alfredo González, Jiménez’s successor, was placed in office\r\nby Congress in 1914, after no candidate had received a majority of the\r\npopular vote. The legality of his election was considered doubtful,\r\nbut he remained at the head of the government until January, 1917. His\r\nadvocacy of radical financial reforms, including a direct property tax\r\nand a heavy progressive income tax, aroused much hostility among the\r\nwealthy classes and alienated several of the more influential political\r\nleaders, with the result that he was overthrown by an almost bloodless\r\n_golpe de cuartel_ engineered by Federico Tinoco, the Minister of War.\r\nThe latter was formally elected president of the Republic on April\r\n1, 1917. Each of the recent rulers of Costa Rica has devoted himself\r\nwith enlightened patriotism to promoting the welfare of the country,\r\nand great advances have been made in reorganizing the finances, in\r\nsafeguarding the public health, and in providing for the education of\r\nthe masses of the people.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Costa Rica now enjoy more stable and more nearly\r\ndemocratic political institutions than any of their Central American\r\nneighbors. Constitutional government works in practice, and the letter\r\nof the law is generally respected, even though its spirit is often\r\ningeniously circumvented. The president walks through the streets much\r\nlike a private citizen, without fear of assassination or of being\r\ncaptured by his enemies, and the leaders of the opposition carry on\r\ntheir propaganda in San José without hindrance or persecution, and at\r\ntimes are even called in to consult with the president on matters of\r\ngreat importance. The press criticises the administration fearlessly\r\nand at times scurrilously, and animated political discussions may\r\nbe heard every day on the principal corner of the main street of\r\nthe capital. The elections are participated in by about as large a\r\nproportion of the entire population as in the United States.[27] If one\r\ncandidate receives a majority of the votes cast, he becomes president,\r\nand if no absolute choice is made by the people, the question goes\r\nto the Congress, where it is decided by intrigues and deals between\r\nthe political leaders. The administration is able to exert a decided\r\ninfluence in the selection of its successor through its control of the\r\npatronage and the army; but the final decision rests with the people\r\nor the popularly elected deputies, and it is not probable that any\r\npresident would resort now to the forceful methods by which official\r\ncandidates were placed in office a few decades ago. The only break\r\nin the peaceful development of constitutional government since 1902\r\nwas the _coup d’état_ of 1917. That the dissatisfied party should\r\nhave chosen violent means for obtaining control of the government,\r\ninstead of waiting for the election which would have been held within\r\na year, must be regretted by every friend of Costa Rica, but this very\r\nevent nevertheless gave the people of the Republic an opportunity\r\nto show their capacity for self-government. Nothing could be more\r\ncharacteristic of Costa Rica than the whole-hearted co-operation of\r\nall political elements in the organization of the new administration,\r\nwithout either bloodshed or persecution.\r\n\r\nGovernment by the people, however, has not really advanced so far as\r\nthe number of votes cast at the elections would seem to indicate, for\r\nthe great majority of the Republic’s inhabitants still take little\r\ninterest in political affairs. So long as order is maintained and\r\ntheir property rights are secure, they do not care particularly which\r\ngroup of politicians is in control and they are guided in voting more\r\nby the inducements held out by the rival candidates than by their\r\njudgments. Personalities rather than questions of national policy are\r\nthe issue, for it is rarely that any candidate makes his campaign upon\r\na definite political or economic platform. Between the elections,\r\npublic opinion, although far more influential than in any of the other\r\nCentral American countries, exercises little real control over the\r\npolicy of the government. The newspapers are very widely read, and the\r\npeople as a whole are remarkably well informed about current events,\r\nbut the press nevertheless has comparatively little power, because no\r\none believes in its impartiality or its incorruptibility.\r\n\r\nThe choice of candidates for public office and the conduct of the\r\ngovernment are left almost entirely to a small number of landed\r\nproprietors, lawyers, physicians, and professional politicians residing\r\nin San José. These owe their influence partly to social position and\r\nwealth, but more especially to education; for although the members\r\nof the old principal families are still prominent, there are also\r\nmany influential leaders who have risen from the lower classes by\r\navailing themselves of the educational advantages which the Republic\r\noffers to all its citizens. The ruling class is divided into a number\r\nof small political cliques, each of which professes allegiance to a\r\nparty chief. As might be expected in an aristocracy composed chiefly\r\nof the leading people of a town of thirty thousand inhabitants, ties\r\nof blood and personal feeling play a very large part in the formation\r\nof these groups, especially as the prominent families are very large,\r\nand each is closely related with the others by intermarriage. A leader\r\nis often able to derive the major portion of his strength from his\r\nrelatives alone, for the aid of ten or fifteen active and popular\r\nsons or sons-in-law, together with that of several score of brothers\r\nand cousins and nephews, is not to be despised in a country where\r\nthere are at most only a few hundred active politicians. Besides his\r\nrelatives and his intimate friends, however, each party chief has also\r\na number of followers who are attached to him by the hope of obtaining\r\nemployment in one of the government offices, for a very large number\r\nof persons among the upper class have little occupation aside from\r\npolitics, and little income beyond that derived from official positions\r\nwhen their friends are in power.\r\n\r\nThe various leaders may have different political ideals and economic\r\ntheories, which to some extent influence their relations to one\r\nanother, but it can hardly be said that any of the present parties have\r\ndefinite principles or programs. Each desires primarily to win the\r\nelections in order to put its followers in office; and the platforms\r\nand the utterances of the leaders are shaped with this end in view,\r\nwith the result that they receive little attention and less credence.\r\nWhen it is necessary in order to obtain control of the government,\r\nleaders of widely different points of view will join forces without any\r\nsuspicion of inconsistency, and it is no very uncommon occurrence for a\r\nprominent member of one party to join another and very different group,\r\nbecause of a quarrel with his former associates or simply because the\r\nchange improves his chances of advancement. Sectional jealousy is no\r\nlonger a force in politics, since the capital has so far outstripped\r\nthe other towns in population and wealth, and religious questions are\r\nrarely injected into the campaign. Attempts have been made to organize\r\na popular party among the laborers and peasants, and this party has\r\nachieved some notable successes at the polls, but its policy when\r\nin power is very similar to that of the other factions. There is in\r\nreality little ground for political rivalry between the different\r\nclasses of the population.\r\n\r\nThe so-called parties have so little permanent organization that\r\nthey can hardly be said to be in existence during the greater part\r\nof the presidential term. About a year before an election, the heads\r\nof the stronger groups, who are often perennial candidates, begin to\r\norganize their own followers, and to bargain for the support of the\r\nless powerful leaders, with a view to inaugurating their campaigns.\r\nCommittees and clubs are organized in each town and village, and\r\ndesperate efforts are made to secure the support of influential\r\ncitizens who are not permanently affiliated with any party, and to\r\narouse the interest of the voters in general. Processions and serenades\r\nare organized to show the popularity of each candidate, and orators\r\nare sent to every town and village on Sunday afternoons to entertain\r\nthe voters with abuse and denunciation of the rival aspirants. Party\r\nnewspapers are established, but they confine themselves to printing\r\nlong lists of local committees and adherents and to describing meetings\r\nand ovations. One may search their columns in vain for serious\r\ndiscussion of the issues of the campaign. Several of the regular\r\nnewspapers take sides more or less openly, while others maintain an\r\nostensible neutrality, but the press as a whole seems to have little\r\ninfluence over the voters. As the contest progresses, feeling runs\r\nhigher and higher among the politicians, and the voters become first\r\ninterested and then excited. The meetings and ovations, the continual\r\npolitical arguments on the streets, resulting in an occasional riot,\r\nand the wholesale treating by the party workers in the drink-shops,\r\ndistract the attention of the people from their ordinary occupations,\r\nand temporarily disorganize the entire community. Elections are\r\ntherefore looked forward to with a certain amount of dread by the more\r\nrespectable classes.\r\n\r\nSince the adoption of the law of 1913, the President, the members of\r\nCongress, and the municipal _regidores_ have been chosen by direct\r\npopular vote instead of by electoral colleges. The balloting takes\r\nplace on the same day in all parts of the country. Each citizen must\r\ninscribe his choice in a book where all may read it, and every party\r\nhas representatives at the polls to secure fair play. This system\r\nprevents fraudulent counting, but it also encourages corruption and\r\nthe exercise of improper influence on the individual elector. Bribery\r\nis practiced openly and on a large scale by all parties, and the voter\r\nis often prevented from exercising his own discretion in casting his\r\nballot by the fear of offending the local authorities or other powerful\r\npersonages in his village. The amount of intimidation and coercion,\r\nhowever, is insignificant as compared with that in the other republics,\r\nand attempts to influence voters by such means are generally condemned\r\nby public opinion. The president is prevented by the constitution from\r\nseeking his own re-election, but one of his associates is usually\r\nfrankly supported by the administration as the official candidate,\r\nand thus has an immense advantage over his opponents, even though\r\nrecent presidents have refrained from using the army and the police to\r\ninterfere with their enemies’ campaigns or to keep the adherents of the\r\nopposition party away from the polls on election day.\r\n\r\nThe large supplies of money which are perhaps the most important factor\r\nin the campaign are obtained by contributions from members of the\r\nparty, who hope to obtain offices for themselves or their friends in\r\nthe event of a victory, and from native and foreign business men who\r\ndesire special concessions. The banks of San José usually assist one\r\ncandidate actively though secretly, and considerable amounts are also\r\nobtained from certain rich speculators, in return for favors contingent\r\non the election of the candidate whom they support. Consequently a\r\nnew administration comes into office bound by numerous more or less\r\nimproper pledges, and burdened by a considerable party debt. After\r\nthe election of 1913-14, the victorious group liquidated a portion of\r\nits financial obligations by a levy on all office-holders, who were\r\npresumably the chief beneficiaries of the party triumph.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the voters does not always inspire the respect which\r\nit would in a democracy more conscious of its power and more jealous\r\nof its rights. The people of Costa Rica have more than once shown\r\nthat they were ready to compel respect for their will when their\r\ninterests were at stake, but as a rule they are disposed to recognize\r\nany administration which controls the capital, regarding civil war,\r\nwith its attendant destruction of crops and livestock, as a greater\r\nevil than submission to an illegal government. It is not strange,\r\ntherefore, that a defeated faction should occasionally attempt to\r\nseize the barracks in San José by force or by strategy, or that the\r\npresident should exact conditions from an opponent victorious in\r\nan election before turning over to him the command of the military\r\nforces. No candidate opposed by the government has ever obtained the\r\npresidency without either making a compromise with his predecessor or\r\nelse overcoming the latter’s resistance by force, for even the freely\r\nelected presidents of the last decade have in every case had the\r\napproval, if not the active support, of the previous administration.\r\nThe strength of the government, however, in reality rests far less upon\r\nthe army than upon the disapproval of the people as a whole of any\r\nattempt to displace the constituted authorities in a disorderly manner,\r\nfor the army itself is almost insignificant as a military force. There\r\nare a few troops in the barracks of the capital, but elsewhere order\r\nis maintained entirely by the civil police. It is a proud boast of the\r\nCosta Ricans that their government employs more school teachers than\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Republic has an almost absolute control over the\r\nmachinery of the government. He not only appoints all administrative\r\nofficers, but also in practice exercises a dominant influence over\r\nthe deliberations of the Congress, where his ministers initiate the\r\nmost important legislation. Even when his personal followers do not\r\nhave a majority in the Chamber, he can usually command one by the\r\nuse of patronage or of money from the treasury, which is often paid\r\nto the Deputies in the form of fees for professional services to the\r\ngovernment. As party lines break down soon after an election, the\r\nminor political leaders who make up the legislative body are apt to be\r\ninfluenced less by hostility to the administration than by a desire\r\nto maintain their following in their own districts by securing public\r\nworks for their towns and employment for their constituents. In times\r\nof emergency, moreover, the Congress itself frequently vests the\r\nPresident with practically absolute power, as it did when the country\r\nwas passing through the economic crisis which followed the outbreak of\r\nthe European war.\r\n\r\nThe Judicial Department, however, is far more nearly independent of\r\nthe Executive. The Supreme Court, which is elected by the Congress\r\nevery four years during the political slack season in the middle\r\nof the presidential term, appoints and removes all subordinate\r\nmagistrates throughout the Republic. Politics enters very little into\r\nthe composition of this body, partly because of the strong sentiment\r\nin favor of a non-partisan judiciary, and partly because party lines\r\nare almost non-existent at the time when the judges are chosen. The\r\nsubordinate positions are also saved from the spoils system which rules\r\nin other departments of the government, although it is inevitable that\r\npurely personal considerations should enter to some extent into the\r\nappointments. The administration of justice is on the whole prompt\r\nand efficient, although the magistrates are not always distinguished\r\nfor erudition or ability and those on the supreme bench sometimes\r\nshow a human desire to make sure of their re-election as the time for\r\nthis draws near, by keeping on good terms with the President and with\r\nthe members of Congress. They are generally honest and impartial in\r\ntheir decisions, however, and their incorruptibility, with hardly any\r\nexceptions, is undoubted. That not only the people themselves but also\r\nthe foreigners in the country have confidence in the courts is shown by\r\nthe fact that there has been a conspicuous lack of the complaints of\r\ndenial of justice which have complicated the relations of some other\r\nLatin American republics.\r\n\r\nThe local administration is highly centralized, but the people of\r\neach district enjoy a certain amount of local self-government through\r\ntheir municipalities. The representatives of the central government\r\nare the executive officers of these bodies,[28] and the Department of\r\n_Gobernación_ has a final veto over all their acts, but the _regidores_\r\nare freely elected by the people of each town and village, and have\r\nvery wide powers in matters of purely local interest. The lack of\r\nfunds, however, arising from the fact that the municipalities have\r\nno source of revenue except certain license fees and fees for public\r\nservices, forces them to leave to the central government many of\r\nthe functions which are assigned to them by the constitution, and\r\nespecially the support and direction of almost all the more costly\r\npublic works, and at the same time makes them politically subservient\r\nto the President and the Congress, which can provide or withhold\r\nappropriations for local purposes. President Alfredo González attempted\r\nto make the local units truly autonomous, by authorizing them, in the\r\nfiscal legislation passed just before his fall, to levy direct taxes\r\nupon their inhabitants by adding a percentage to the national direct\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThe central government itself, thanks to a long period of internal\r\npeace and to the patriotism and ability of the men who have been at\r\nits head, has reached a high degree of efficiency and of usefulness to\r\nthe community. Private rights are generally well protected, and the\r\noppression of private citizens by the officials, while not unknown,\r\nis unusual. The security of persons and property is guaranteed by a\r\nwell-organized police force, a fairly efficient judiciary, and an\r\nexcellent land registry system. In spite of the difficulties presented\r\nby the mountainous character of the country and by six months of heavy\r\nrains every year, the Republic possesses a fair system of highways,\r\nalthough in this matter there is still room for improvement. The\r\ngovernment-owned and operated railway from San José to the Pacific\r\nCoast compares favorably, at least in the service rendered, with those\r\ncontrolled by foreign corporations in other parts of Central America.\r\nThere are sewers in the larger towns, and aqueducts supply healthful\r\ndrinking water even in the small villages. The public health is also\r\nprotected by a rigid quarantine service, by a veterinary service which\r\ninspects live cattle and meat, and by the regulation of contagious\r\ndiseases and prostitution; and the government employs forty physicians\r\nin various parts of the country who treat the poor in their districts\r\nfree of charge. Many of the public services, because of the lack of\r\nexperience and training on the part of the officials, and because of\r\nthe poverty of the government, are still in an unsatisfactory state,\r\nbut they at least show an earnest desire on the part of the authorities\r\nto promote the welfare of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three years, remarkable progress has been made in\r\nimproving sanitary conditions. The campaign against the hookworm,\r\ninaugurated in 1914 with the aid of the International Health Commission\r\nof the Rockefeller Foundation, already promises to effect an\r\nincalculable change in the condition of the country people, an immense\r\nnumber of whom suffer from this disease. The representative of the\r\nInternational Health Commission has been made the head of an official\r\ndepartment under the Ministry of Police, and all local health officers\r\nand police officials have been placed under his orders to assist him\r\nin the examination and treatment of patients and the execution of\r\nsanitary measures designed to check further spread of the disease. At\r\nthe same time, he has been made Director of the School Medical Corps,\r\nin which capacity he has done much to secure proper care for the health\r\nof the children and to improve hygienic conditions in the schools.\r\nWith the earnest co-operation of the government, notable results have\r\nbeen obtained even in the short time which has elapsed since the work\r\nwas begun. It is impossible to estimate what the final effect of work\r\nsuch as this will be, for the extinction of the hookworm alone, to\r\nsay nothing of the other results of the campaign of medical education\r\nand sanitary improvement which has been undertaken, cannot but have a\r\nlasting effect on the happiness of the people and on their capacity for\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe field of activity in which the rulers of Costa Rica have perhaps\r\nshown the most interest has been that of education. Its school system\r\ngives the Republic one of its strongest claims to be ranked among the\r\nprogressive communities of the world. The nation which a century ago\r\nwas so illiterate that it was difficult to find enough men who could\r\nread and write to fill the public offices, now provides free and\r\nobligatory instruction for all of its citizens, with a primary school\r\nin every settlement where there are thirty children to attend it. In\r\n1915, there were 1,108 teachers and 34,703 children in the public\r\nschools.[29] New buildings and equipment are being secured as fast\r\nas possible, and new courses of technical and agricultural training\r\nare being introduced everywhere. There are five institutions for the\r\nsecondary education of both sexes, two in San José, and one each in\r\nCartago, Heredia, and Alajuela, offering instruction similar to that\r\ngiven in American schools. These have somewhat over eight hundred\r\nstudents in all. The latter are chiefly from the middle classes in\r\nthe towns, but the brighter children from the country schools are\r\nalso encouraged and financially aided in continuing their education\r\nafter they complete the primary course. A national normal school has\r\nrecently been established in Heredia to provide teachers for the entire\r\nsystem. Besides the government institutions, there are schools of\r\nlaw, pharmacy, music, fine arts, textiles, agriculture, and domestic\r\nscience, most of them in San José, which receive some aid from the\r\ntreasury. How high the percentage of literacy is, is attested by the\r\nlarge circulation of newspapers in the country districts.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the work of the government shows that the men who\r\ncontrol the destinies of the Republic, however regrettable their\r\npolitical methods sometimes are, do not seek power solely for their own\r\nprofit. If there is a large amount of favoritism and graft in official\r\ncircles, there is also much progressive spirit and true patriotism.\r\nMost of the government employees are appointed for political reasons,\r\nbut they ordinarily perform their duties with as much energy and zeal\r\nas can be expected in tropical America. Public money is often misused,\r\nand improper considerations sometimes govern the letting of contracts,\r\nbut public works are nevertheless well executed. Wholesale theft from\r\nthe treasury, which is too often regarded with cynical indifference in\r\nother parts of the Isthmus, would not be tolerated by public opinion in\r\nCosta Rica.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica’s freedom from internal disorder has enabled her to\r\nattain a prosperity which has entirely transformed the backward and\r\npoverty-stricken community of colonial days. In 1821, her people had\r\nalmost no means of communication with the outside world. They produced\r\nnothing which they could export, and they were separated from either\r\ncoast by several days of difficult and dangerous traveling. Commerce\r\nwith the outside world, however, began soon after the declaration of\r\nindependence with the development of the growing of coffee, which was\r\nexported for the first time in 1835.[30] The importance of this crop\r\nincreased rapidly, especially after the construction of a cart road,\r\nwhich was completed in 1846, to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. The\r\nCosta Rica berry soon acquired and still holds a high reputation in the\r\nEuropean markets.\r\n\r\nThe exporters at first encountered great difficulty and expense in\r\nshipping their product, which they had to send around Cape Horn, or\r\nlater by the expensive route of the Panama Railway. The government,\r\ntherefore, early endeavored to provide more adequate means of\r\ntransportation. In 1871, work on a line from Puerto Limón on the\r\nCaribbean Sea to the capital was begun by Mr. Minor C. Keith. After\r\ndifficulties which seemed almost insuperable had been overcome and\r\nthousands of lives had been sacrificed in the deadly lowlands of the\r\nEast Coast, through train service to San José was finally opened in\r\n1890, and the Republic found itself for the first time in direct\r\ncommunication with the United States and Europe. The railway, which\r\nstill carries the greater part of the imports and exports, was leased\r\nin 1905 for a period of ninety-five years to the Northern Railway of\r\nCosta Rica, a concern owned by the United Fruit Company.\r\n\r\nIt was while building this road that Mr. Keith began to plant the\r\nbanana farms which later developed into the enormous Caribbean\r\nproperties of the United Fruit Company. Costa Rica still leads the\r\nCentral American republics in the production of this fruit. Almost\r\nthe entire East Coast has now been brought under cultivation, and\r\nEnglish-speaking communities of Americans and Jamaica negroes have\r\ngrown up everywhere along the railroad and its numerous branches.\r\nIn spite of the ravages of the disease which has attacked the older\r\nplantations, more than eleven million bunches of bananas were exported\r\nfrom Limón and its tributary ports in 1913,[31]--a quantity the\r\nimmensity of which can only be grasped when we realize that it would\r\nprovide approximately a dozen bananas for every man, woman, and child\r\nin the United States. The Fruit Company is of course very powerful in\r\nthis region, where even the police duties of the central government are\r\nto a great extent exercised through its agents. In the interior, the\r\n“United” has less influence. It has many friends as well as enemies\r\namong the party leaders, and it has not encountered so intense a spirit\r\nof jealousy and hostility towards foreign enterprises as is found in\r\ncertain of the other republics; but whatever efforts it has made to\r\ninfluence the outcome of presidential and congressional elections, in\r\norder to be in a more advantageous position to ask concessions from the\r\ngovernment, have usually been conspicuously unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Northern Railway, the Republic has another line,\r\nowned and operated by the government, from San José to Puntarenas on\r\nthe Pacific Coast. This also was commenced during the administration\r\nof General Guardia, but it was not completed until 1910. Being shorter\r\nand on the whole less expensive to operate than the Atlantic road, it\r\nshould eventually become a formidable competitor of the latter when\r\nadequate transportation is provided by way of the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade of the nineteenth century, when the price of\r\ncoffee in the world’s markets was high, the Republic enjoyed an era\r\nof great prosperity. The wealthier families were able to travel and\r\nto study abroad as they had never done before, and both society and\r\nthe government entered on a period of extravagance, of which the\r\nmagnificent national theater in San José is an enduring memorial.\r\nWhen the coffee prices fell, there was a reaction which checked\r\nthe development of the country’s natural resources. The area under\r\ncultivation in the interior has now remained practically the same for\r\nmany years, and the exports of coffee, which have declined in value,\r\nhave increased little or not at all in quantity.[32] During this time,\r\nmany of the more prominent native families have become impoverished,\r\nand the upper classes as a whole have hardly shown either the energy\r\nor the adaptability necessary to maintain their political and economic\r\nleadership under modern conditions. They devote themselves to politics\r\nand to the learned professions, but there are now comparatively few\r\nof the wealthy landholders who form the most influential class in the\r\nother Central American republics.\r\n\r\nBanking, commerce, and mining are almost entirely in the hands of\r\nforeigners, although the majority of the coffee plantations are still\r\nowned by citizens of the country. These immigrants have identified\r\nthemselves more completely with the community than in any of the other\r\nrepublics, often intermarrying with the natives and taking a prominent\r\npart in local affairs. San José, although not so large or so wealthy as\r\nGuatemala or San Salvador, is more like a European city than any other\r\ncapital in the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe industrious, sturdily independent peasant class in the country\r\ndistricts has been little affected by the changes which have taken\r\nplace in the cities. Throughout the _meseta central_ there are\r\ncountless small farms, which not only supply their owners with corn,\r\nbeans, and sugar cane for food, but at the same time frequently produce\r\na small amount of coffee, which is sold to the proprietors of the\r\nlarge cleaning mills to be prepared for export. The farmers not only\r\ncultivate their own properties, but also work for several days in each\r\nweek on the larger plantations. As wages are fairly high, they thus\r\nhave a money income which enables them to live far better than their\r\nbrothers in the neighboring countries. Most of them can read and write,\r\nand they are able to give their children educational advantages little\r\ninferior to those enjoyed by country people in any other part of the\r\nworld. During the last few years, as we have seen, they have even\r\nacquired a not inconsiderable political power, which will become more\r\nimportant as they become more experienced in its use. It is these small\r\nlandholders who have made Costa Rica what she is today, and who offer\r\nthe strongest guarantee for her future.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] See L.

Realizing that the five countries\r\ncan never be really independent of one another, and that the interests\r\nof all would be best served by joining forces for their common ends,\r\nthe majority of their statesmen have always been, and are today,\r\nperhaps more than ever, desirous of seeing them transformed from a\r\ngroup of small, disorderly republics into one strong nation, able to\r\npromote the interests of its people and to command respect from foreign\r\npowers. Such a nation, with its five millions of inhabitants, its\r\nfertile soil, and its great natural resources, would, they believe,\r\nbe able to assume a position of importance in the councils of Latin\r\nAmerica and to make great strides towards better government and towards\r\na more complete realization of economic opportunities at home. In the\r\nlast five years especially, increasing contact and occasional friction\r\nwith other powers have drawn the five states closer together than ever\r\nbefore, for the problems created by the invasion of foreign financial\r\ninterests and by the intervention of foreign governments in their\r\ninternal affairs have made them realize more than ever the dangers to\r\nwhich their divided condition and their quarrels among themselves\r\nexpose them. The pressure from outside has given rise to a stronger\r\nsentiment of their common nationality and to a fuller realization of\r\nthe identity of their interests than could exist while they were still\r\nalmost shut off from intercourse with other countries.\r\n\r\nThere are many influences which make the relations between the five\r\ncountries closer than those which ordinarily exist between neighboring\r\nindependent states. Their administrative union during the three\r\ncenturies of Spanish rule and their entry together into the family\r\nof nations not only created a strong sentimental tie between them,\r\nbut also gave rise to political problems common to them all, and\r\nto political parties which regarded not individual states but the\r\nIsthmus as a whole as their theater of activity. The factions which\r\narose during the years of the Federation kept up an international\r\norganization after the dissolution of the central government, and\r\nConservatives in Guatemala, or Liberals in Salvador and Nicaragua,\r\ninterfered from time to time to promote the interests of their\r\nparties in other countries throughout the nineteenth century. Even at\r\nthe present time, each state has too much interest in the internal\r\naffairs of its neighbors to remain indifferent when revolutions or\r\nother political changes occur. As a result of this situation, men\r\nof the same way of thinking have been brought into closer relations\r\nwith one another, and have been made to feel, by their co-operation\r\nfor common political ends, that they were, in fact, citizens of one\r\nCentral American nation. This feeling has been strengthened by the\r\ncustom of exiling the leaders of the defeated party after revolutions,\r\nwhich has encouraged travel from one country to another, and by the\r\nfact that many of the prominent families of the Isthmus are related to\r\none another by intermarriage. The five republics, moreover, are all\r\nconfronted with the same economic problems, in developing their natural\r\nresources, improving their agricultural methods, and securing capital\r\nfor the construction of railroads and other public works; and they have\r\nmuch in common in their civilization, and especially in the customs\r\nand ways of thought of the upper classes, despite the wide divergences\r\nbetween them in racial and social conditions.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, when the authority of Spain was thrown off, it was supposed as\r\na matter of course that the provinces of what had been the Viceroyalty\r\nof Guatemala would continue to be united under one government. The\r\nConstituent Assembly which met after the dissolution of the short-lived\r\nunion with Mexico was therefore following the logical course laid down\r\nfor it by the history and the existing political organization of the\r\nfive countries, as well as by the ideas of the political theorists\r\namong its members, when it adopted a constitution providing for a\r\nfederal republic. The stormy history of the government thus established\r\nhas already been sketched. The Federation fell to pieces partly\r\nbecause of local jealousies and the conflicts of local interests,\r\nand partly because of faults in its constitution and weaknesses in\r\nits administration. The civil war which existed in almost all of the\r\nstates, and the strife between the different departments of the central\r\ngovernment itself, made it impossible for the latter to establish\r\na constitutional regime or permanently to exercise any real power.\r\nThe states, jealous of the control of their affairs from Guatemala,\r\nrespected the orders of the federal authorities only when it suited\r\ntheir convenience to do so; and these authorities, in order to maintain\r\ntheir position, were forced to intervene in the internal affairs of the\r\nstates to establish administrations subservient to their wishes. There\r\nwas thus a series of revolutions and counter revolutions, until within\r\na few years both the national and local governments had become mere\r\ndespotisms which depended for support solely upon the federal army. It\r\nwas impossible for a centralized military regime to exist very long in\r\na country where means of communication between the different sections\r\nwere so inadequate, and where the centrifugal forces were so strong\r\nas they were in the turbulent, mutually jealous communities of the\r\nIsthmus. The federal government had less and less real power after the\r\nfirst term of President Morazán, and in 1840 it disappeared entirely\r\nwith the expulsion of its representatives from Central America.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous failure of the federal republic convinced many of the\r\nstatesmen of the Isthmus that their countries would be better off\r\nas separate states. This feeling was especially strong among the\r\nConservatives in Guatemala, who for more than thirty years were the\r\ngreatest obstacle to the restoration of the Union. The great families’\r\nopposition to a political connection with the other states seems to\r\nhave arisen from the memory of the expense to which they had been\r\nput in supporting the federal authorities before 1829, and of their\r\nsufferings at the hands of the Liberals from Honduras and Salvador,\r\nwho overwhelmed and subjugated them in that year. Costa Rica, at the\r\nother extreme of the Isthmus, had also withdrawn formally from the\r\nFederation, inspired by motives much similar to those which actuated\r\nGuatemala. Unlike the latter country, however, she was able because\r\nof her isolated position to remain entirely aloof from the political\r\nstruggles elsewhere, and only on one or two occasions was forced to\r\ntake notice of the agitation to which the activities of the Unionist\r\nparty periodically gave rise.\r\n\r\nSalvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras, on the other hand, refused to\r\naccept the dissolution of the first union as a final settlement of the\r\nrelation of the states to one another. Many of the leaders in those\r\ncountries had taken part in the defeat of Morazán, but they had done\r\nso from personal hostility to the federal president rather than from a\r\ndesire for the destruction of the federal government. The restoration\r\nof the Union was championed by the Liberal party, but it was also\r\nfavored by many of the Conservatives, despite the influence exerted\r\nupon the latter by their allies in Guatemala. There were a number of\r\nfactors which tended to draw the three central republics together.\r\nWith their _mestizo_ population, they resembled one another in their\r\neconomic and social conditions far more than they resembled Guatemala,\r\nwith its primitive Indian tribes, on the one hand, or white Costa Rica\r\non the other; and thus no one of them was influenced, as were those\r\ncountries, by a consciousness that its internal problems were entirely\r\ndifferent from those of its neighbors. Furthermore, their jealousy of\r\nthe superior power of Guatemala, and the alarm caused by Carrera’s\r\nrepeated interventions in their affairs during his dictatorship in that\r\ncountry, greatly strengthened their desire to unite their forces for\r\npurposes of mutual defense. Great Britain’s aggressions on the East\r\nCoast of Nicaragua and Honduras had the same result after 1848. Between\r\n1840 and the invasion of Nicaragua by Walker in 1854, hardly a year\r\npassed without the meeting of a congress to discuss plans for forming\r\na union, at least between these three countries. As a rule these\r\ncongresses adjourned without achieving any definite result, finding\r\ntheir work made hopeless by the intrigues of the separatist party in\r\nGuatemala and by the mutual mistrust of the participating states, but\r\ntwice a federal government in which neither Guatemala nor Costa Rica\r\nwas represented was actually established. A third attempt to unite\r\nthe central republics was made forty years later, at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe history of these abortive unions affords an instructive\r\nillustration of the influences which have kept the five states apart.\r\nIn 1842, delegates from Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua met at\r\nChinandega, in the last named republic, and adopted a treaty providing\r\nnot so much for a central government as for a confederation, in which\r\neach state was left free to manage its own affairs, even to the extent\r\nof carrying on diplomatic relations and making war. The only common\r\nauthority was a council, consisting of one delegate from each republic\r\nand presided over by a Supreme Delegate, and a supreme court chosen by\r\nthe state legislatures. This government sent troops to aid Salvador\r\nin a war between that country and Guatemala in 1844, and finally\r\nsucceeded in bringing the war to an end through the mediation of Frutos\r\nChamorro, the Supreme Delegate. The confederation came to an abrupt and\r\ndisastrous end in the same year, however, when Salvador and Honduras\r\nattacked Nicaragua because the latter had granted asylum to political\r\nexiles from these countries.[33]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, the central republics again signed a treaty of confederation\r\nwhich provided for common action in foreign affairs and a union for\r\npurposes of defense. Their action was inspired by the encroachment\r\nof Great Britain on the territory of Nicaragua and Honduras on the\r\nMosquito Coast. The council of commissioners to which the management\r\nof the affairs of the confederation was intrusted accomplished little;\r\nbut in 1852, in the face of renewed foreign complications, a diet met\r\nat Tegucigalpa to make the union between the three countries closer and\r\nto establish, if possible, a real federal government. The diet elected\r\na president, and adopted a constitution giving that official power, not\r\nonly to represent the three republics in their dealings with foreign\r\npowers, but also to intervene by force in the internal affairs of the\r\nstates, when it was necessary to maintain order. Disapproving of this\r\nprovision, Salvador and Nicaragua refused to ratify the constitution,\r\nand the diet dissolved.[34]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Conservatives of the central republics had been less\r\nhostile to the restoration of the federation than were the great\r\nfamilies of Guatemala, they took little interest in plans for a\r\nunion after these two failures. During their thirty years’ rule in\r\nNicaragua, therefore, that country did not enter into another attempt\r\nto accomplish what was regarded as primarily the ideal of the opposite\r\nparty. With Salvador and Costa Rica, in fact, it opposed and defeated\r\nthe projects of Rufino Barrios in 1885. It was not until the accession\r\nof President Zelaya that the Nicaraguan government again showed itself\r\nready to enter into projects for the restoration of the federation.\r\nIn 1895, the representatives of the three central republics, meeting\r\nat Amapala, drew up a treaty establishing a diet, composed of one\r\nmember from each country, to which was intrusted the conduct of their\r\nrelations with one another and with other nations. This body was to\r\nelaborate a definite plan for a closer, permanent union.[35] The\r\nfederation assumed the name “Greater Republic of Central America,”\r\nand at once took steps to enter into diplomatic relations with the\r\npowers.[36] During the next two years a constitution was drawn up, and\r\nin the autumn of 1898 an executive council, with far broader powers\r\nthan the old diet, was installed in Amapala. It had scarcely assembled,\r\nhowever, when the party opposed to the union in Salvador overthrew\r\nthe government of that state, and declared the federation at an end.\r\nThe council called upon the presidents of Nicaragua and Honduras\r\nto send troops to uphold its authority, but neither executive was\r\nwilling to make war upon the new government of Salvador. The union was\r\nconsequently dissolved.[37]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the federations created by the treaties of 1842, 1849,\r\nand 1895 did not indicate that a real union of the five countries\r\nwould be impracticable, because a real union was not attempted.\r\nThe political leaders who were in control in Salvador, Honduras,\r\nand Nicaragua theoretically favored the establishment of a central\r\ngovernment, but they were loath to surrender to it any real power\r\nor to confer upon it any right of control over themselves. They\r\ninsisted upon keeping the management of the state armies, finances,\r\nand administrative machinery in their own hands, and they therefore\r\nconferred upon the federal officials only an indefinite authority,\r\nbacked by no military force, which they respected and supported only\r\nso long and in so far as it suited their own interests to do so.\r\nThe unions thus established were not nations, but mere leagues of\r\nindependent states. Each came to an inglorious end as soon as the rapid\r\nchanges of Central American politics brought to the front in one of the\r\nstates an administration which was not in sympathy with the men who\r\ncontrolled the central government.\r\n\r\nThe apparent impossibility of restoring the federation by the voluntary\r\naction of the five republics convinced many of the strongest advocates\r\nof a union that their ideal could be realized only by the use of force.\r\nIt was this belief which led Rufino Barrios, the first great Liberal\r\npresident of Guatemala, to embark on the disastrous adventure which\r\ncaused his death. Soon after his accession to power, Barrios endeavored\r\nto persuade the presidents of the other republics to agree to some form\r\nof federation. The latter declined to enter into any definite treaty,\r\nalthough negotiations upon the subject were carried on intermittently\r\nfor several years. The United States, when invited to participate in\r\nthese efforts, declined to interfere, although warmly approving the\r\nplan for a union.[38] The equivocal attitude of his neighbors, and\r\ntheir refusal either to agree to or to reject his proposals, finally\r\nconvinced Barrios that the people of the Isthmus favored his plans,\r\nbut that the governments would consent only if they were compelled\r\nto. On February 28, 1885, therefore, he announced that he had assumed\r\ncommand of the military forces of the Central American Federation, and\r\ninvited the other states to recognize the new government, and to send\r\ndelegates to a constituent assembly which was to meet in Guatemala City\r\nin May of the same year. Honduras expressed approval of his action and\r\nplaced troops at his disposal, but all of the other countries of the\r\nIsthmus at once began to raise armies to defend their independence.\r\nPresident Zaldívar of Salvador, upon whose aid Barrios had confidently\r\ncounted, yielded to the popular demand for resistance to the aggression\r\nof that republic’s traditional enemy, and sent an army which defeated\r\nthe forces of Guatemala at Chalchuapa, on April 2, 1885. The death of\r\nBarrios in this battle disheartened his followers, and put an end to a\r\nwar which could not have failed to have involved every section of the\r\nIsthmus if it had continued.\r\n\r\nAn ambition to place himself at the head of a restored Central American\r\nnation has influenced more than one Central American president in his\r\ndealings with the neighboring countries. Few have actually gone so far\r\nas Barrios did, but the same idea which inspired the Guatemalan leader\r\nhas often influenced powerful rulers to intervene openly or covertly in\r\nthe internal affairs of the other states, and has thus frequently been\r\na cause of revolutions and international wars. The most recent attempt\r\nto unite the five countries by force was made in 1907. In that year\r\nPresident Zelaya of Nicaragua overthrew the government of President\r\nBonilla in Honduras, and set up a new one, under Miguel Dávila, which\r\nwas practically controlled by himself. He then proceeded to attack\r\nSalvador, inspired by the idea of establishing a Central American\r\nunion,--an idea which, as he said, was at the time being advocated\r\nwith enthusiasm by the press of Central America, the United States,\r\nand Mexico.[39] The war which followed was brought to an end by the\r\nmediation of President Roosevelt and President Porfirio Díaz.\r\n\r\nAt the Washington Conference, which met a few months later, the\r\ndelegates of Honduras, supported by those of Nicaragua, formally\r\nproposed that a treaty of union be signed, and stated that the\r\npresidents of those countries were ready to lay down their offices\r\nif that were necessary to make the execution of the treaty possible.\r\nThis motion nearly caused the disruption of the conference, for\r\nthe delegates from Guatemala opposed it, and those from Costa Rica\r\nobjected even to its being discussed. The representatives from\r\nSalvador, who were at first inclined to favor the plan, voted against\r\nit as inopportune after receiving instructions to do so from their\r\ngovernment, and the matter was finally dropped. The arguments advanced\r\nby the advocates and the opponents of this project give a good idea\r\nof Central American opinion in regard to the establishment of a\r\nunion. Señor Fiallos, one of the delegates from Honduras, emphasized\r\nthe necessity for a federation to put an end to the wars between the\r\nstates. These, he said, were only civil wars which had crossed the\r\nnational boundaries, for there were no real antipathies or conflicting\r\ninterests between the various countries. He dwelt upon the expense of\r\nkeeping up five separate governments and armies,--an expense which\r\nprevented the use of the national revenues for the development of\r\nthe country. The majority of the committee appointed to consider the\r\nmatter, on the other hand, admitted that the Union was the greatest\r\nand noblest aspiration of Central American patriotism, but affirmed\r\nthat it could not be brought about until the economic, moral,\r\npolitical, and material conditions of the five republics had been\r\nharmonized. It recommended for the present the discussion of measures\r\nwhich might prepare the way for the Union, such as the improvement\r\nof communications, the encouragement of the coasting trade, the\r\nestablishment of uniform fiscal systems and customs duties, the holding\r\nof annual Central American conferences, and the creation of a court of\r\ncompulsory arbitration.[40]\r\n\r\nThere seems little probability that a stable and enduring federal\r\ngovernment could be established in Central America at the present\r\ntime. Even a union brought about by the voluntary action of the five\r\ncountries would almost inevitably fall to pieces sooner or later,\r\nhowever patriotic the spirit which presided at its formation. The\r\ncentrifugal forces would be no stronger, perhaps, than they were in the\r\nNorth American states before 1787, but they would be fatal because it\r\nwould be impossible to provide political machinery for settling them.\r\nThe establishment of a constitutional and orderly administration for\r\nthe five states together would be as difficult as it has been for each\r\nstate alone, for the mere fact of union could effect little change in\r\npolitical methods or political morality, and none in the capacity of\r\nthe people for self-government. The nature of the economic and social\r\nconditions in the four northern countries makes it inevitable that any\r\nadministration under which they were united, if at all centralized,\r\nshould be a regime of force, similar to that which already prevails\r\nin each country. Real elections could no more be held throughout the\r\nentire Isthmus than they can be held in any one state today, and in\r\nthe absence of elections there would be no means of changing the\r\nauthorities of the federation except by revolution or by a compromise,\r\nnot between three or four political groups, as in Nicaragua or Honduras\r\ntoday, but between a large number, few of which could be represented\r\nin the new government. The unfriendly feeling between different\r\nsections, which is still strong among both the upper classes and the\r\ncommon people, and the inevitable jealousy of the small states towards\r\nthe larger ones would sooner or later cause dissatisfaction with\r\nthe working of the federal system, and quarrels over such questions\r\nas the distribution of offices and the expenditure of money on\r\ninternal improvements. These difficulties would be intensified by the\r\ndifferences in civilization, and consequently in political requirements\r\nand in points of view between the more and the less advanced republics.\r\nIt is hard to see how these conflicting interests could be reconciled\r\nby a government whose officials and subjects have as yet never learned\r\nthe value of compromise, or the necessity of respecting the will of the\r\nmajority and the rights of the minority.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles to the formation of a permanent union by the voluntary\r\naction of the five states would be still greater in the case of one\r\nbrought about by force. An able leader, supported by the unionist party\r\nin each of the countries, might impose a federal government on the\r\nentire Isthmus for a time, but he would meet with immense difficulties\r\nin upholding his authority against hostile political groups because\r\nof the difficulty of sending troops and supplies from one section to\r\nanother. While it endured, his regime could only be a personal one.\r\nThe dissatisfied elements might be held in check temporarily, but they\r\nwould tear the Union to pieces with the more fury when the ruler who\r\nhad founded it was forced by his death or by a defeat at the hands of\r\nhis enemies to relinquish his hold upon the supreme power.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of uniting the five republics would not be\r\ninsuperable if the ruling classes were genuinely ready to co-operate in\r\nrealizing the national ideal, but the men who enjoy the high offices\r\nand the control of the revenues of the state governments show a decided\r\nreluctance to giving up any of their power for the common good. The\r\nlocal political groups and the influential families would necessarily\r\nbe reduced to a position of far less importance if the union were\r\naccomplished; and the realization of this fact makes many of those\r\nwho are most enthusiastic in their advocacy of a Central American\r\nFederation slow to take any definite steps towards its realization. It\r\nis not difficult for the state authorities to frustrate the endeavors\r\nof the Unionist party, because the common people and even the majority\r\nof the upper classes show little real interest in the measures which\r\nare from time to time proposed for actually bringing the five republics\r\ntogether. Educated and patriotic people, at least in the four northern\r\ncountries, express themselves in favor of union, but they nevertheless\r\nbring little influence to bear on their governments to support projects\r\naiming to bring nearer the time when a Central American nation can\r\nbe established. The international conferences provided for by the\r\nWashington Conventions of 1907, to take a recent example, met regularly\r\nfor several years to discuss the common interests of the five republics\r\nand to formulate plans for bringing them closer together, but they were\r\nfinally suppressed because the state authorities had failed, apparently\r\nfrom pure indifference, to carry out any of their excellent and for the\r\nmost part perfectly practical recommendations. The realization of the\r\nnational ideal will not be possible until this indifference disappears\r\nand a broader patriotism takes the place of the jealousy and mistrust\r\nwhich influences the relations of the states to one another at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a permanent union will be all but impossible until a change\r\nhas taken place in the political conditions of the Isthmus. No central\r\ngovernment could long endure unless it commanded the active support\r\nof a strong party in every one of the states, and such a party could\r\nhardly exist on the basis of cliques, resting largely on local feeling\r\nand personal and family ties, such as those which today dominate the\r\npolitical affairs of the five republics. An administration set up under\r\npresent conditions could only maintain itself by playing off against\r\none another the rival factions in the states, thus bringing about a\r\nsituation similar to that which caused unbroken turmoil during the\r\nlife of the first federation. To secure a solid basis for the creation\r\nof a Central American nation, the control of politics must be taken\r\nout of the hands of the factions as they are at present organized,\r\nthrough an increased participation in the government by the people at\r\nlarge. The spread of popular education and the introduction of foreign\r\nideas throughout the Isthmus makes such a change by no means a distant\r\nprobability. When it takes place, questions of personal and purely\r\nlocal interests, which are now so prominent in affairs of state, will\r\nbe relegated to the background, and one of the forces which operates\r\nmost strongly to keep the states apart will thus be removed.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the five republics would be closer if the means\r\nof intercommunication were better. Although each country possesses\r\nrailroads and cart roads, which give the majority a comparatively\r\nadequate internal transportation system, they are connected with one\r\nanother only by the roughest of mule paths. Very little commerce passes\r\nover these, and journeys overland from one capital to another are beset\r\nby many difficulties. Travelers from one country to another, in fact,\r\nalmost invariably prefer to make use of the expensive and not very\r\ncomfortable steamers which run at rare and irregular intervals between\r\nthe ports of the West Coast. This lack of transportation facilities not\r\nonly tends to isolate the five republics from one another, but also\r\nmakes much more difficult the problem of establishing a government able\r\nto exercise an effective military control over all of them. The gradual\r\nimprovement of interstate communications will overcome this difficulty,\r\nand will also make possible a far greater interchange of products.\r\n\r\nThe strong unionist sentiment which exists in the four northern\r\ncountries is not shared by the people of Costa Rica, who regard the\r\nidea of throwing in their lot with that of the other republics with an\r\naversion which makes their participation in the re-establishment of the\r\nfederation very doubtful. The Costa Ricans, having successfully held\r\naloof from the disorders in other parts of the Isthmus, have little\r\ndesire to accept any plan which might involve them in the quarrels of\r\ntheir neighbors. They are loath to exchange their free institutions\r\nfor the military government which prevails around them, or to give up\r\ntheir position as an independent nation to become an unimportant part\r\nof a country in which a majority of the inhabitants, and therefore\r\npresumably of the voters, would be backward _mestizos_ or uncivilized\r\nIndians. Rather inclined to be self-centered and self-satisfied,\r\nthey show little sympathy with the nationalist aspirations of their\r\nneighbors, and they are perfectly contented, for the present at least,\r\nto continue their peaceful development in their own way.\r\n\r\nThe free people of Costa Rica could hardly be expected to submit to\r\nsuch a government as social conditions have made inevitable in some of\r\nthe republics. The differences in the internal situation of the five\r\ncountries are really the most discouraging obstacle to the realization\r\nof the dream of Central American Union. Guatemala, for instance, with\r\nforty per cent of the inhabitants of the Isthmus, must under any fair\r\nplan of organization have a preponderant influence in the councils of\r\nthe federation. Her wealth and her dense Indian population, which is\r\nmore pliable in the hands of the officials than are the _ladinos_ of\r\nthe other countries, would give those who controlled her administrative\r\nmachinery a dangerous power when dissensions arose within the\r\nfederation. It is unthinkable that elections there should be anything\r\nbut a farce for generations to come, for the Indians, untouched for the\r\nmost part by the changes which are improving the position of the common\r\npeople in other parts of the Isthmus, must for a period impossible to\r\ncalculate remain under the political control of the upper classes. For\r\nthe smaller and weaker countries, therefore, the union would present\r\nmany very serious dangers. Human ingenuity could hardly devise a form\r\nof government able to maintain itself against disaffected factions, and\r\nto cope with the conditions existing in the less advanced parts of the\r\nIsthmus, which would at the same time be acceptable to the people of\r\nthe more enlightened sections.\r\n\r\nThe realization of this difficulty has led many Central American\r\nleaders to advocate a confederation, in which each state should\r\nbe left free to manage its own affairs, rather than a centralized\r\nfederal government. As we have seen, however, unions of this kind have\r\nseveral times been attempted, and have in every case been a failure.\r\nThe states which were parties to them showed little respect for the\r\ncentral authorities, and refused to allow the latter to exercise any\r\nreal power. On several occasions, war broke out between the very\r\nstates which were parties to the confederation. No Central American\r\nUnion, while present political conditions continue, can be permanent\r\nor beneficial unless the government is given real power, not only to\r\nrepresent the Union in international relations, but also to maintain\r\norder and enforce the law throughout its territory. If the individual\r\nstates retained the control of their military forces, or if they were\r\nunder administrations which were not in harmony with the national\r\nauthorities, the federation could only expect a short and stormy\r\nlife. To establish a decentralized administration would be to invite\r\ndisaffection and revolution, for each local government would become\r\nalmost inevitably a center of intrigues against the _status quo_. It\r\nis only necessary to recall the history of the first Central American\r\nFederation to appreciate the dangers which a half-way measure of union\r\nwould involve.\r\n\r\nThe union of the five republics under a central government strong\r\nenough to maintain order and make itself respected would in many ways\r\ngreatly improve their position. One nation of five million inhabitants,\r\nwith a rich territory 172,000 square miles in area, would be in a far\r\nbetter position to deal with the rest of the world commercially and\r\ndiplomatically than five petty states whose quarrels make them one\r\nanother’s worst enemies. If the peoples of the Isthmus were able to\r\npresent a united front, instead of intriguing with foreign governments\r\nagainst one another’s tranquillity or forcing those governments to\r\nintervene in Central American affairs by inciting revolutions or\r\nengaging in wars against neighboring states, one of the most serious\r\ndangers which today threatens their independence would be done away\r\nwith. Other countries would of course rather deal with one central\r\nauthority than with five petty ones. The United States especially,\r\nwhich cannot remain indifferent to the disorders arising from the\r\ndissensions and the rival ambitions of Central American rulers, because\r\nof its immense interests in the Caribbean Sea and the obligations which\r\nit assumed in connection with the Washington conventions of 1907, could\r\nnot but welcome any change which promised to make for peace.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the present governments, with their heavy\r\nexpenditures, would effect an economy which would be of the greatest\r\nimportance to countries suffering from so many financial difficulties\r\nas do those of Central America. In the first place, the cost of\r\nmaintaining five separate presidents, with their suites, cabinets, and\r\ndiplomatic corps, which is one of the heavy burdens upon the national\r\ntreasury today, could be eliminated, and many other unnecessary\r\nofficials could be dispensed with. Military expenditures could also\r\nbe cut down, for the armies of the several states are maintained in\r\npart at least for use against one another. With the money thus saved,\r\nthe improvement of means of communication and the development of\r\nnatural resources could be undertaken on a larger scale than ever\r\nbefore, and could moreover be carried on without encountering many\r\nof the obstacles which interstate jealousy now puts in the way. Much\r\nmore progress than is possible at present could be made in such\r\nmatters as public instruction, sanitation, and the encouragement of\r\nagriculture; and problems like the development of markets for Central\r\nAmerican exports and the protection of the national resources against\r\nexcessive exploitation by foreign capitalists could be dealt with more\r\neffectively by united action. To obtain these benefits, however, there\r\nmust be a central government able to preserve order and to make its\r\nauthority respected in all parts of the Isthmus, for one which could\r\nnot fulfill these requirements would be worse than none at all.\r\n\r\nProjects for the federation of the Central American republics have\r\nalways aroused a friendly interest in the United States, where there\r\nhas been a hope that the Union would promote the stability and the\r\npolitical and economic progress of the Isthmus. As early as 1859,\r\nPresident Buchanan secretly offered to support Juan Rafael Mora, who\r\nhad just been exiled from Costa Rica, in an attempt to make himself\r\npresident of a restored Central American Union, promising to aid\r\nhim by sending two warships as an evidence of moral support. Mora\r\nrefused, however, on the ground that such a Union, even if it could\r\nbe established, would in the end be harmful to the best interests of\r\nCosta Rica, which would be involved by it in the civil wars of the\r\nother countries.[41] Some years later, Secretary Blaine expressed the\r\nsympathy of the State Department with Barrios’ projects for uniting\r\nthe five countries, although he declined to intervene or to express\r\napproval of the use of force in accomplishing them.[42] In 1907, before\r\nand after the Washington Conference, there was a considerable amount of\r\ndiscussion of the question in the United States both by officials and\r\nby the press.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the intervention of the United States in the\r\ninternational affairs of the Isthmus, and even in the internal affairs\r\nof some of the republics, has made its attitude towards the question\r\nof re-establishing the Union more important than ever before.[43]\r\nMany of the leading statesmen of the Isthmus believe today that the\r\nestablishment of a strong and permanent federal government can only\r\nbe brought about through active aid from Washington. On the other\r\nhand, it has been vehemently asserted that the establishment of what\r\nis virtually an American protectorate over Nicaragua has made it\r\nimpossible that the other countries should join in any union with her\r\nuntil the policy of the United States is reversed, since they would\r\nsubject themselves by doing so to the same foreign domination. Whether\r\nthis view is entirely justified may well be doubted. In the first\r\nplace, no permanent political connection between the United States and\r\nNicaragua has been established, or is likely to be established. The\r\ngovernment of the North American Republic has indeed intervened in\r\nNicaragua to prevent revolutions, but it seems probable that it would\r\nbe forced to do as much in any other Central American state where\r\nsimilar conditions existed. The arrangements with the North American\r\nbankers, which have aroused so much opposition in Central America, are\r\nprimarily of a financial character. It would be idle to deny that they\r\nconstitute infringements of Nicaragua’s sovereignty, but they can be\r\nbrought to an end at any time when the Republic is ready to repay the\r\nmoney which its government has borrowed and to buy back the national\r\nproperty which has been sold. It is ridiculous to suppose that either\r\nthe United States or the bankers have any ulterior political purposes,\r\nor that their aim has been other than the improvement of the economic\r\nsituation of Nicaragua. The treaty providing for American control\r\nof the canal route and for a naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca has\r\ncaused bitter controversies, but it is difficult to see how it can\r\nhave a permanent adverse influence on the question of the Union. The\r\nUnited States has no interest in Central America more important than\r\nthat of aiding the five republics to become strong, prosperous, and\r\nwell-governed commonwealths, and it is therefore impossible to suppose\r\nthat it will be hostile to any movement which promises to improve their\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe unionist idea is one which should command the sympathy of everyone\r\ninterested in the future welfare of the people of the Isthmus. As we\r\nhave seen, a stable federation, established upon an equitable basis,\r\nand accepted by all of the five republics, could not but greatly\r\nimprove their situation, making them less exposed to aggression and\r\ninterference from outside, and encouraging their internal economic\r\nand social development. The establishment of such a federation seems\r\nimpracticable at present, and an attempt to unite the five countries,\r\nwhether by force or by the voluntary action of their governments, would\r\nprobably result in more harm than good. But the time when a strong\r\nand progressive Central American nation can be founded seems to be\r\ndrawing steadily though slowly nearer, and the forces which are now\r\nat work, changing the internal and the international situation of\r\nthe five republics, may bring about the consummation which so many of\r\ntheir statesmen desire, sooner than now seems possible. Every friend\r\nof the Central American countries must hope that this will be so, in\r\norder that the dangers to which they are now exposed through their own\r\ndivisions and weaknesses and through the inability of some of them to\r\nafford protection to the life and property of foreigners may be averted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] See Bancroft, _History of Central America_, Vol. III, p. 188ff.,\r\nand A.

It is said\r\nthat all of the other republics have accepted the invitation of the\r\ngovernment of Honduras to send delegates for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n              THE CAUSES OF CENTRAL AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS\r\n\r\n Civil War as a Characteristic Central American Political\r\n Institution--Character and Extent of the Conflicts--Forces back of\r\n Them: Unfitness of the People for Democratic Government, Oppression by\r\n the Party in Power of its Enemies, Rivalry for Office, _Personalismo_\r\n and _Localismo_--Indifference of the Mass of the People--Hope for\r\n Improvement--Effects of Contact with the Outside World.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important fact in the history of the Central American\r\nrepublics, from their declaration of independence down to the present\r\ntime, has been the almost continuous civil war from which the majority\r\nof them have suffered. Their inability to establish stable governments\r\nhas retarded their economic and social progress in the past, and is a\r\nmenace to their welfare and even to their national existence today.\r\nThe development of agriculture, the building of roads and railroads,\r\nand the civilization and education of the masses of the people, have\r\nbeen discouraged, both by strife between factions at home and contests\r\nwith neighboring governments, and by the misrule resulting from the\r\npredominance of the military elements which have been brought to the\r\nfront by the premium which these conflicts have placed on armed force.\r\nThe weakness of the five countries, moreover, has frequently exposed\r\nthem to acts of aggression from foreign powers, and in recent times\r\ntheir very independence has been endangered because the apparent\r\nincapacity of most of them for self-government has led to a general\r\nbelief in Europe and America that they must one day fall under the\r\ncontrol of some stronger power. Under modern conditions, it is\r\nimpossible for a government which cannot maintain order and secure to\r\nthe lives and property of foreigners the protection which international\r\nlaw demands to expect that its rights of sovereignty, or even its\r\nterritorial integrity, should be scrupulously respected by governments\r\nwhich are more powerful and better organized. The elimination of\r\ninternal disorder is therefore one of the most serious problems which\r\nconfronts the people of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nIf one asks the average Central American, whether of the educated\r\nclasses or of the common people, what has been the principal cause of\r\nthe revolutions which have occurred in his country, he will almost\r\ncertainly answer: the ambition of professional politicians and the\r\nabuse of power by the government,--the desire of each member of the\r\nruling class to hold office, and the tendency of each administration\r\nto use its authority for the personal benefit of those who control its\r\npolicy and for the gratification of their hatred of their opponents.\r\nThe force of this reply can be readily appreciated by one who has\r\nseen the conditions which exist in some of the five republics, but\r\nthe causes assigned are nevertheless hardly adequate to explain the\r\nextreme prevalence of internal strife in the five republics. There\r\nare many countries with perfectly stable governments which are cursed\r\nwith politicians more ambitious and more selfish than those who have\r\nbeen prominent in revolutions in Central America, and many also where\r\nthe opponents of those in power are treated with far more severity\r\nthan falls to the lot of the defeated party there. The reasons given\r\nindicate, perhaps, the motives which actuate those who participate\r\nin each revolt, but they do not explain the underlying causes which\r\nhave made uprisings against the government more frequent in Central\r\nAmerica than in almost any other part of the civilized world. These\r\ncauses must be sought, not in the aspirations and immorality of any one\r\nrelatively small group of men, such as that which figures in Central\r\nAmerican political affairs, but rather in the nature and working of the\r\ngovernmental institutions and in the economic and social condition of\r\nthe people as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe way in which revolution became the only means by which the\r\npolitical institutions of the five republics could be worked has\r\nalready been described. The constitutions which were drawn up for\r\nthe federal government and for the five states in the years 1823-25\r\nprovided, as we have seen, for the choosing of the more important\r\nofficials by popular elections; but the holding of real elections soon\r\nproved to be impossible, because of the ignorance and indifference\r\nof the great majority of the people, and the lack of experience in\r\nself-government among the ruling classes. The parties which were\r\ncontending with one another for the control of the government soon\r\nyielded to the temptation to employ force and fraud to attain their\r\nends; and the voting for officials consequently became, first an\r\noccasion for periodic disorders, accompanied frequently by an appeal to\r\narms, and then a mere farce, in which the triumph of the administration\r\ncandidate was assured by the pressure exerted by the government. Within\r\na few years after the declaration of independence, force had come to\r\nbe recognized as the only means by which power was secured and held,\r\nand revolution was not only the sole remedy for bad government, but the\r\none way in which a change of officials could be effected. Civil war was\r\nthus an indispensable part of the political system.\r\n\r\nRevolutions were of almost yearly occurrence throughout the Isthmus\r\nduring the first half century after the declaration of independence,\r\nfor the development just described took place in each of the five\r\ncountries. In some, however, there was early apparent a tendency\r\ntowards avoiding actual warfare, so long as the established government\r\npursued a policy which made its rule tolerable to the parties not\r\nrepresented in it. Even when disaffection grew so strong that a change\r\nwas inevitable, attempts were usually made to bring about a compromise.\r\nForce still remained the basis of all authority, and potential\r\nrevolution the only corrective of bad government, but actual fighting\r\nbetween the factions was rare. In Costa Rica, where this tendency was\r\nstrongest, practically no blood has been shed in political quarrels for\r\nnearly sixty years. Nicaragua and Honduras, on the other hand, have\r\nhad frequent and sanguinary revolutions throughout their history as\r\nindependent nations. This difference between them and their peaceful\r\nneighbor is enough to indicate that other factors, besides the mere\r\nimpossibility of changing their governments except by force, have\r\ncontributed to make them turbulent. Before attempting to explain what\r\nthese factors are, however, it is necessary to understand the nature of\r\nCentral American revolutions and the character and the motives of the\r\npersons who participate in them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it should be borne in mind that the average\r\nrevolution is not a movement which embraces a very large number of\r\npeople or which calls into play deep economic or social motives. The\r\ncountries themselves are very small, for the largest barely exceeds\r\nfifty thousand square miles in area. In all of them, except Salvador,\r\nmuch of the national territory is so sparsely settled, and often so\r\nimpenetrable and unhealthful, that it hardly enters into consideration\r\nas a theater of military operations. Of the total population, which\r\nis probably not more than 600,000 in Nicaragua, Honduras, or Costa\r\nRica, only a very small portion is sufficiently interested in politics\r\nto participate voluntarily in a civil war. Revolutionary armies,\r\ntherefore, rarely reach any great size, and they rarely need to in\r\norder to succeed. The military force of the government is small,\r\nill-equipped, and poorly trained, and not infrequently part of it\r\nproves disloyal in a political crisis. Although it is impossible to\r\nestimate with any degree of accuracy how many soldiers are actually\r\nunder arms at a given time in such countries as Nicaragua or Honduras,\r\nit seems very doubtful if the total exceeds two or three thousand, and\r\nthese are scattered through the country to such an extent that a much\r\nsmaller revolutionary force, sometimes of less than a hundred men,\r\ncan seize and hold an important strategic point before the government\r\nhas time to rally its forces. After an uprising has started, both\r\nsides fill their ranks by voluntary recruiting and impressment, but\r\nneither is able to raise or to fit out any army which would seem very\r\nformidable to a single well-trained regiment. It is only necessary to\r\nrecall the stand which William Walker, with a few hundred dissolute\r\nand undisciplined adventurers, was able to make against the combined\r\nmilitary power of the five republics, in order to appreciate the actual\r\nforce at the disposal of a Central American government. Yet these\r\ngovernments are nevertheless able to suppress the greater part of the\r\nrevolts which occur against their authority.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which causes the revolutions is not often one which arouses\r\nvery much enthusiasm among the people at large. Their leaders are\r\nusually inspired by a thirst for offices and spoils or a desire for\r\nrevenge against political rivals who have oppressed them, and the\r\nrank and file are actuated mainly by sectional or class jealousy, but\r\nrarely by any genuine political motives. There are of course many men\r\nin politics who seek to obtain control of the government, even by\r\nrevolution, in order to effect economic and social reforms. Generous\r\nand patriotic ideas are found both among the chiefs and their followers\r\nin all parties, but they play a smaller part in actually bringing about\r\na revolt than do the less creditable but still very human motives upon\r\nwhich the political parties are built up.\r\n\r\nRevolutions are rarely the result of a widespread conspiracy among\r\nthe people. Even a large portion of the active members of the party\r\ninterested often know little about the plans of the leaders until an\r\narmed uprising has already taken place. The procedure followed is much\r\nthe same in nearly all cases. A group of factional chiefs, with a few\r\nscore of their more intimate personal followers, raise the standard\r\nof revolt with a pronunciamento against the government, naming one\r\nof their number as provisional president. An attempt is made either\r\nto seize from within some town in which the revolutionary party is\r\nparticularly strong, or to invade the country from outside, occupying\r\none of the seaports as a base of operations. The latter is perhaps\r\nmore common, because the important members of the opposition party\r\nare generally in exile. The revolution not infrequently gains its\r\nfoothold, as did that of 1909 in Nicaragua, through the treachery of\r\nlocal authorities who turn over to it the soldiers and the military\r\nsupplies under their control, or by the disaffection of high officials\r\nsufficiently influential to carry with them a considerable part of the\r\narmy. Arms and supplies are secured from some neighboring government\r\nwhich has reasons for wishing to overthrow the existing administration,\r\nor from foreign corporations and speculators who wish concessions or\r\nspecial privileges. A revolt often attains formidable proportions in\r\nthis way before the government can raise and equip an army to send\r\nagainst it, as it usually starts in regions remote from the capital,\r\nwhere it is able to consolidate its forces before it meets with\r\nserious opposition. In the districts still under the control of the\r\nauthorities, meanwhile, martial law is proclaimed, known or suspected\r\nadherents of the party responsible for the revolution are thrown into\r\njail, horses and other property are requisitioned for the army, and\r\nevery able-bodied man of the laboring and artisan classes, except\r\nthose who succeed in concealing themselves, is pressed into service\r\nas a soldier. The result, of course, is an immediate paralyzation of\r\nagriculture and commerce. A revolution thus begun often lasts several\r\nmonths before there is a decision, although only a few battles are\r\nfought, and only two or three thousand men, and often less, are engaged\r\non each side. If the rebels win a few successes at the beginning, or if\r\nthe government is unable to defeat them after a prolonged campaign, the\r\npresident usually falls, because of his loss of prestige and because of\r\nthe defection of the always numerous politicians who desire above all\r\nelse to be on the winning side. When this occurs, there is a complete\r\ndemoralization of all of the departments of the administration,\r\naccompanied, not infrequently, by a split in the victorious party or a\r\ncounter revolution on the part of the defeated. Order is not restored\r\nuntil one strong leader or group of leaders has established himself or\r\nitself in complete military control.\r\n\r\nSince these revolutions are the work of so small a proportion of the\r\npeople, their causes must evidently be sought not so much in any\r\ninherent disorderliness and lawlessness of the nation as a whole, as in\r\nthe questions which have divided the classes interested in politics,\r\nand in the conditions which have made it possible for these classes to\r\nplunge the community into civil war time after time by their incessant\r\nfeuds, without being effectually checked by the desire of the rest of\r\nthe country for peace.\r\n\r\nThe instigators and leaders of Central American revolutions are in\r\nalmost every case the pure-blooded, or nearly pure-blooded, descendants\r\nof the _conquistadores_, and one of the chief causes of these phenomena\r\nmust therefore be sought in the characteristics which the creole\r\naristocracy has inherited from its sixteenth century ancestors. Among\r\nthe Spaniards who founded the colonies on the Isthmus there were a few\r\nrespectable families, but the majority were adventurers, fugitives from\r\njustice, and soldiers who had been left without occupation by the\r\ncessation of the wars against the Moors, and came to America in search\r\nof excitement and easily gained wealth. In exploring and subjugating\r\nthe Indian kingdoms, they showed a bravery and an indomitable energy\r\nwhich have few parallels in history, but as colonists they were\r\nturbulent, lawless, and unprincipled. Their cruelty towards the Indians\r\nhas already been described. Their dissensions among themselves, before\r\nthe government at home had firmly established its military control\r\nover them, forecasted what might be expected when the authority of\r\nSpain should be withdrawn, for the bloody clashes between rival\r\nexploring parties, the vindictiveness and treachery exhibited towards\r\none another by ambitious governors who could not agree upon the extent\r\nof their respective jurisdictions, and the occasional uprisings,\r\nlike that of the Contreras brothers in Nicaragua, among the rabble\r\nof the Spanish settlements, made the annals of the Central American\r\nprovinces during the sixteenth century one long chronicle of bloodshed.\r\nAfter the declaration of independence, it was the descendants of the\r\nearly colonists who carried on the civil wars which lasted almost\r\nwithout intermission for so many years. The leaders of the political\r\nfactions,--the men who fill the higher offices when their party is in\r\npower and bear the brunt of the opposition at other times,--are still\r\nfor the most part members of the white upper class, even though the\r\nexclusiveness of the old creole aristocracy has been broken down.\r\n\r\nIt is rather surprising to find the native landholders and merchants,\r\nwho have more interest than anyone else in the maintenance of order\r\nand good government, taking the lead in the civil wars which have made\r\norder and good government impossible. But the feuds which have divided\r\nthe educated and wealthy classes among themselves have been so bitter\r\nthat it has been impossible down to the present time for their leaders\r\nto co-operate with one another in establishing and supporting a stable\r\nand efficient government. The custom of proscribing and despoiling\r\npolitical enemies has kept alive and intensified the personal hatred\r\nbetween the members of the rival parties even in those countries where\r\nthere are no fundamental economic or social questions upon which the\r\nruling classes are divided. After a change of government, the more\r\nprominent adversaries of the victorious party are usually exiled or\r\nimprisoned; their property is taken from them either by outright\r\nconfiscation or forced loans; and their constitutional rights are\r\nlittle respected by the officials or by the courts. When an outbreak\r\nagainst the government is attempted or threatened, many of those of its\r\nopponents who are still at liberty are seized, and even their wives and\r\nchildren are subjected to imprisonment and mistreatment, and sometimes,\r\nas under the government of President Zelaya in Nicaragua, to barbarous\r\ntortures. These persecutions, inspired not only by a determination to\r\nprevent uprisings against the government, but often by a desire for\r\nrevenge and for the gratification of individual spite, frequently make\r\nthe situation of the enemies of the administration so intolerable that\r\nthey prefer to risk everything in a revolt rather than to submit. This\r\nhas been especially true in countries where continual revolutions have\r\nkept party feeling at white heat, accustoming all classes to regard\r\ncivil war almost as a normal condition, and forcing the government to\r\ntake severe measures against all whom it thinks likely to resist its\r\nauthority by force of arms. Peace can never be hoped for under these\r\nconditions. The only republics of Central America which have made any\r\nreal progress towards stable government are those where the opponents\r\nof the party in power are treated with comparative fairness, and where\r\nconfiscation and imprisonment for political reasons are rare.\r\n\r\nResistance to oppression, however, is by no means the only motive\r\nwhich leads members of the upper classes to engage in intrigues and\r\nrevolts against the government. The pursuit of office is in itself an\r\nattractive occupation, for every member of the small ruling class has a\r\ncomparatively good chance of becoming president or cabinet minister or\r\nof attaining some other honorable and lucrative position. The rewards\r\noffered by politics are on the whole greater than those held out by the\r\nmore solid occupations, especially in those countries where continual\r\ndisorder make agriculture and commerce a precarious means of securing a\r\nlivelihood, for very few of the native planters or merchants receive so\r\ngreat an income as they could secure, legitimately or illegitimately,\r\nat the expense of the community if they could reach one of the higher\r\npositions in the government. Politics, moreover, provides the natural\r\noutlet for the energies of those members of the upper class who have no\r\nproperty. This is especially true of the great majority of the lawyers,\r\ndoctors, and dentists, few of whom secure a respectable living from\r\ntheir overcrowded professions.\r\n\r\nMany members of the wealthy and educated classes, however, have always\r\nworked for peace, realizing that revolutions not only deprived their\r\nproperty of most of its value, but also lessened their own influence\r\nin the community by raising demagogues and purely military leaders\r\nto positions of prominence. The influence exerted by this moderate\r\nparty has depended upon the economic development of each country. In\r\nCosta Rica and Salvador, where the cultivation of coffee has been\r\ndeveloped until it offers a more attractive field of endeavor than\r\npolitics, the great landholders have been a powerful factor in bringing\r\nabout the establishment of stable government. In Guatemala also, the\r\nprosperity of agriculture has probably favored peace, although the\r\nbitterness of party strife in that country and the backwardness of the\r\nIndian population have greatly retarded its political development.\r\nAgriculture in Honduras and Nicaragua, on the other hand, being still\r\nin a primitive condition, affords a comparatively unattractive\r\noccupation, and politics may still be said to be the chief interest of\r\nthe propertied classes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the landholding and professional classes furnish the leaders,\r\nthe revolutions would hardly be possible without the participation of\r\nthe far more numerous other elements in the community. The half-breed\r\nartisans in the towns and villages form perhaps the largest part of\r\nthe factional armies. These laborers, who have little property, and\r\ntherefore, so far as they can see, little direct interest in the\r\npreservation of peace or the economic well-being of the community,\r\nfind in civil war both a welcome source of excitement and an avenue\r\nfor personal advancement and profit, for the opportunities for loot\r\nduring the campaigns, and the rewards distributed among the adherents\r\nof the victorious party after a successful revolution, make conspiracy\r\nand revolt a more lucrative occupation than hard labor at a trade.\r\nThere is no way in which the intelligent but unstable _ladino_, little\r\ninclined to steady manual or intellectual labor, can so easily achieve\r\nwealth and influence as by the pursuit of politics,--a vocation which\r\nmakes it possible for a boy of the humblest, barefooted, illiterate\r\nfamily, coming from a thatched, one-room hut in the mountains, to\r\nrise to a position where he is addressed as “Great and Good Friend”\r\nby the heads of the leading nations of the world. Not a few artisans\r\nand professional soldiers of this class have actually risen to such\r\na position, and some, especially in the Liberal party, have been\r\npresidents of their countries for long periods. Ordinarily, however,\r\nthey play a less prominent part in affairs than the members of the\r\nwhite aristocracy, who have the advantage of superior education, social\r\nprestige, and wealth.\r\n\r\nThose who hope to derive some direct individual profit, however,\r\nform but a small part of the number of persons engaging in a typical\r\nrevolution. The rebel leaders would have but little hope of overcoming\r\nthe advantage conferred on the government by its control of the\r\nadministrative machinery, and above all of the standing army and\r\nmilitary stores, if they did not receive active support from adherents\r\nfar too numerous to be rewarded by offices or money in the event of\r\nvictory. The principal motive which brings together the rank and\r\nfile of a revolutionary army is “_personalismo_,”--the devotion to\r\nindividual chiefs, sometimes the heads of great families, sometimes\r\nprofessional soldiers, sometimes mere demagogues, whose relation to\r\ntheir followers is usually not so much that of political leaders as\r\nof friends and patrons. Ties of blood, friendships, and gratitude for\r\nfavors received or expected play a much greater part in holding these\r\nfactions together than community of ideals or principles; and the very\r\nnature of the parties consequently makes the strife between them the\r\nmore bitter and compromise the more difficult. Closely connected with\r\nthis _personalismo_ is _localismo_, the jealousy and rivalry between\r\ntown and town, which makes the political leaders of each hostile to\r\nthose in other parts of the country and enables them too often to carry\r\nthe common people with them in their armed opposition to a government\r\ncontrolled by their enemies. We have already seen how disastrous an\r\ninfluence this spirit has exerted in the history of the Isthmus, and\r\nhow it has been intensified by continual internal strife and by the\r\npersecution of the people of one section by those of another.\r\n\r\nOther factors also have often contributed, though usually in a minor\r\ndegree, to bring about an uprising against the government. Religious\r\nquestions have been a source of much trouble, although they are less\r\nimportant at present than in the early history of the Isthmus. The\r\nChurch has now lost its one-time influence through the decline of\r\nreligious feeling among the people, but in the first half century\r\nafter the declaration of independence it was often strong enough to\r\ninstigate a revolt against a government which oppressed it, or, by\r\nits own exactions, to cause one against a government which supported\r\nit. Abuses of power by the officials, or the adoption of a policy\r\nwhich directly injured a large portion of the people, have sometimes\r\ndone much to make a revolution possible, and dissatisfaction with\r\nthe existing administration, apart from any desire to put any other\r\ngroup of individuals in power, always causes many persons to join the\r\nranks of the rebel army. Many others take part merely for the sake of\r\nexcitement and plunder,--because they wish to fight and to “eat fat\r\ncows.” The revolutions, when they have once started, naturally attract\r\nall of the discontented and adventurous elements in the community. But\r\nit is _personalismo_ and _localismo_ which make it possible for them to\r\nstart, and which hold the armies participating in them together through\r\nthe exigencies of the conflict.\r\n\r\nOnly a small part of the people, however, enter at all into these party\r\nconflicts. The great majority, especially in the rural districts,\r\nknow little and care less about political affairs. They dislike and\r\nfear the revolutions, which often involve forced military service for\r\nthemselves and destruction for their livestock and their little patches\r\nof corn and beans, but they have been so accustomed to misgovernment\r\nand exploitation ever since their ancestors were conquered by the\r\nSpaniards that it never occurs to them to make a concerted effort\r\nto check the disorderly tendencies of the politicians. It is this\r\nignorance and indifference of the masses of the people, rather than\r\nany disposition to turbulence in the nation as a whole, which has\r\nprevented the establishment of stable government in many of the Central\r\nAmerican republics, by making it impossible to hold elections and work\r\nthe constitution by peaceful means, and by permitting rival cliques\r\nof professional office-seekers to plunge the country into civil war\r\ntime after time for the gratification of personal ambitions and feuds,\r\nwithout other restraint than that suggested by their own interests.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asserted that it is the Indian and part Indian element\r\nwhich is chiefly responsible for the disorders in Central America. This\r\nview seems to find justification in the tranquillity of Costa Rica,\r\nwhere the population is almost entirely of Spanish descent, but it is,\r\nin fact, very unjust to a race which is on the whole more peaceful,\r\nlaw-abiding, and industrious than the descendants of their conquerors.\r\nThe Indians rarely participate in a revolution. In Guatemala, where\r\nthey have retained their racial identity more than in any other part\r\nof the Isthmus, they have hardly ever risen against the government\r\nsince their final subjugation at the beginning of the colonial period,\r\nalthough they have always been forced to serve against their will both\r\nin the standing army and in revolutionary forces. The only real popular\r\nuprising which has occurred in that republic,--the revolution which\r\nplaced Carrera in power in 1838, originated not among the Indians but\r\namong the ignorant _ladinos_ in the districts east of the capital,\r\nwhere the conditions are far more similar to those of Honduras and\r\nNicaragua than to those which prevail throughout the greater part of\r\nGuatemala itself. It was among the half-breeds that Carrera secured\r\nthe followers who enabled him to establish his military despotism,\r\nand it was these same half-breeds, under the influence of the village\r\npriests, who made the Church so strong a factor during the Conservative\r\nadministration. In Nicaragua, the semi-civilized rural population in\r\nthe district of Matagalpa and the villages which have retained their\r\ndistinctly Indian character in the southwestern Sierras have as a\r\nrule remained neutral, so far as they could, in the contests between\r\nLeon and Granada, although the Indians of Matagalpa revolted on one\r\noccasion, about thirty years ago, when they were forced to aid in\r\nconstructing a telegraph line into their country. The Indians in the\r\nfour northern countries, indeed, are responsible for the revolutions\r\nonly in the sense that they are helpless to prevent them. Their\r\nsituation is very different from that of the common people of Costa\r\nRica, where the early extinction of the aborigines made possible the\r\ndevelopment of a compact, homogeneous community of white peasants,\r\namong whom it was comparatively easy to establish stable political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe causes of Central American revolutions, therefore, may be said to\r\nbe: first, the attempt to impose political institutions copied from\r\none of the world’s most advanced democracies upon a country where\r\nelections were absolutely impossible; second, what may be called the\r\nhabit of revolution among the ruling class and the people of many of\r\nthe towns,--a habit formed during the turbulent years that followed\r\nthe breakdown of the federal constitution, and perpetuated by the\r\nbitterness of personal feuds and sectional jealousy, the pursuit of\r\npolitics as a money-making occupation, and the mutual persecutions\r\nof rival factions; and third, the backwardness of the masses of\r\nthe people, which has not only made the republican constitutions\r\nunworkable, but has also prevented those who in the long run suffer\r\nmost from civil war from exerting any effective influence for peace.\r\n\r\nNone of these causes can be said to be permanent. There is no reason to\r\nsuppose that stable governments will not be attained eventually in all\r\nof the five republics, as a result of the education of the people. The\r\npublic schools, which have been established in the last quarter century\r\neven in the remote country districts of the Isthmus, have already done\r\nmuch to improve the situation and enlarge the outlook of the masses of\r\nthe population, and to hasten the approach of the day when they will be\r\nable to assume the control of their own affairs through the democratic\r\nmachinery which already exists on paper, and to protect themselves\r\nagainst the disastrous consequences arising from the factional quarrels\r\nof selfish professional politicians. This influence makes itself felt\r\nslowly, but the social and political effects of popular education, once\r\nthey have asserted themselves, can never be undone. The penetration of\r\nforeign ideas and the increase of wealth and improvement of standards\r\nof living which have resulted from the development of foreign commerce\r\nare also doing their part in changing the situation of the countries\r\nof the Isthmus. The landholding classes, as we have seen, are already\r\nexerting a strong influence in behalf of peace in the more prosperous\r\ncountries, for their success in agricultural pursuits has greatly\r\nlessened their interest in politics. The laboring classes, also,\r\nhave found new opportunities for employment and advancement, and are\r\nbeginning to learn by experience that their own welfare is dependent\r\nupon the peaceful development of their country. The factors in favor of\r\nstable government have thus been immeasurably strengthened.\r\n\r\nThose who hope for the ultimate political regeneration of the Isthmus\r\nreceive much encouragement from the example of Costa Rica, which\r\nstarted upon her independent existence with the same institutions\r\nand the same inexperience in self-government as her neighbors. Costa\r\nRica, it is true, has owed her freedom from civil war largely to her\r\nisolation and her homogeneous European population, but the substitution\r\nof a popularly elected and constitutional government for the military\r\ntyrannies which had existed at first there as well as in other parts of\r\nthe Isthmus was due primarily to the education of the common people and\r\nto the increasing realization on their part of their interest in the\r\nconduct of public affairs. There is no reason to suppose that a similar\r\ndevelopment will not take place eventually in Nicaragua, Honduras,\r\nand Salvador, and even among the Indians of Guatemala. The people of\r\nthose countries have never had the opportunities for peaceful progress\r\nwhich the prosperous peasants of Costa Rica have enjoyed, but there\r\nseems little reason to suppose, from observation of the races as they\r\nwork side by side in schools and public offices, that the Indian or\r\nthe _mestizo_ of the other republics is inherently less capable of\r\nadvancement or less fitted for self-government than his fellow-citizen\r\nof Spanish descent.\r\n\r\nThe changes brought about by increased intercourse with foreign\r\ncountries have on the whole favored stability and good government, but\r\nin some respects they have been far from beneficial. While agriculture\r\nor commerce has been made a more attractive occupation than conspiracy\r\nand revolt for many of the great landholders, many others have been\r\ndriven out of these pursuits and into politics, as the only means of\r\nmaking a living which remained open to them, by the immigration of more\r\nefficient foreign planters and business men. We have already seen to\r\nwhat an extent this has taken place in some of the five countries. The\r\ninterest in peace among the classes who by wealth and education are\r\nbest qualified to be the leaders of the community has been lessened by\r\nthe loss of their property, and the number of professional politicians\r\nand revolutionists who are almost entirely dependent upon the pursuit\r\nof office for support has been swelled by members of many families\r\nwhich formerly devoted their energies to more useful occupations.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the foreigners, moreover, have taken part in civil wars\r\nand disturbances, for the furtherance of purely selfish aims, and\r\nto the great detriment of the native community. The North American\r\nor European professional revolutionist, usually an adventurer or a\r\nfugitive from justice in his own country, is a type which is all too\r\nfamiliar in the more disorderly countries of the Isthmus. He is rarely\r\nanything more than a mercenary soldier, ready to offer his services\r\nto the highest bidder, but his presence is a source of annoyance and\r\ndanger to the constituted authorities, and the viciousness and greed of\r\nsome who have been rewarded for their assistance in war with official\r\npositions has equaled if not exceeded that of the most depraved\r\nnative leaders. The participation of these men in the armies on both\r\nsides of a civil contest, moreover, is often a positive danger to the\r\nCentral American countries, because of the regrettable readiness of the\r\ngreat powers of the world to protect their citizens in their real or\r\nfancied rights even when they are engaged in an occupation so little\r\ncommendable as that of making war for money against a constituted\r\ngovernment. A significant example of the difficulties which arise from\r\nthis source was afforded by the events which followed the shooting of\r\ntwo American adventurers during the Nicaraguan revolution of 1909.[44]\r\n\r\nStill more dangerous to the welfare of the Central American countries\r\nare the foreign corporations which, for equally unworthy purposes,\r\noften render open or covert aid to a revolutionary movement, in order\r\nto assure themselves of the protection and favor of the new government.\r\nThere is unfortunately little doubt that recent uprisings in Honduras\r\nand Nicaragua have been financed and supplied with arms from New\r\nOrleans, or that they have owed their success largely to the aid thus\r\nreceived. So long as the resources of the five republics continue to\r\nbe developed under special concessions and privileges, there will\r\ninevitably be a strong temptation for the large fruit companies and\r\nother corporations having interests there to intervene in political\r\naffairs, because of the great part which official favor or disfavor\r\nplays in determining the conditions under which they do business.\r\nSuch a situation is disastrous to the internal peace of the countries\r\ninvolved, for any discontented faction can usually secure support\r\nfrom some group of investors or speculators who think that they can\r\nfurther their interests or secure valuable concessions by promoting\r\na revolution. In the governments which come into power in this way,\r\nhowever, the influence of the foreign corporations which have aided\r\nthem is generally far less than might be expected, for Central American\r\npolitical leaders are none too grateful and none too scrupulous about\r\ncarrying out obligations which they have entered into; and they rarely\r\nlose sight of their distrust of the foreigner in their appreciation of\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\nThe disturbing influences introduced by intercourse with other\r\ncountries, however, are offset, and more than offset, by the pressure\r\nwhich foreign governments, actuated by a desire to protect their\r\nsubjects who have settled or invested capital in Central America, have\r\nexerted in behalf of peace. The United States, especially, has been\r\nforced to take positive action to prevent civil and international wars\r\nin the Isthmus, not only because its commerce and its investments there\r\nare larger than those of any other nation, but also because its settled\r\npolicy not to permit European intervention in the affairs of the weaker\r\nAmerican nations has made it necessary to adopt measures which deprive\r\nother powers of an excuse for interference. Inspired by a desire to\r\npromote the stability and well-being of its neighbors, the United\r\nStates has in the last ten years taken more and more radical steps to\r\nsafeguard the peace of the Isthmus, until it has finally reached the\r\npoint of actually suppressing revolutions in one of the countries by\r\nforce. Its influence has therefore become the most potent factor, for\r\ngood or for evil, both in the external and the internal affairs of the\r\nfive republics. No description of Central American conditions would be\r\ncomplete without a discussion of the way in which this influence has\r\nbeen exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] See Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                   THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE OF 1907\r\n\r\n The Increased Responsibilities of the United States in the Caribbean\r\n Sea Since 1900--The San José Conference--The War of 1907--The\r\n Washington Conference and the Conventions Adopted by it--Their\r\n Effectiveness in Promoting Internal and International Peace--Work of\r\n the Central American Court--The Central American Conferences and the\r\n Central American Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first years of the twentieth century have brought about a decided\r\nchange in the attitude of the United States towards its neighbors\r\naround the Caribbean Sea. The increasing importance of our political\r\nand economic interests in those countries has made their domestic\r\nprosperity and the maintenance of their independence from European\r\ninfluence more than ever before essential to our own well-being.\r\nAmerican investments and trade in the West Indies have attained such\r\ngreat proportions that anything which affects the normal life of one\r\nof the countries of that region is felt at once in commercial and\r\nfinancial centers in the United States. The sugar plantations of\r\nCuba and the banana plantations of Central America, to take only two\r\nexamples, represent many millions of dollars of American capital,\r\nand at the same time are important sources of the food supply of the\r\nAmerican people. Simultaneously with the expansion of our economic\r\ninterests, our political interests in the Caribbean have become of\r\nparamount national importance. The acquisition of Porto Rico, and much\r\nmore the building of the Panama Canal, have made it impossible for the\r\nUnited States to remain indifferent when international complications\r\narise which affect the military situation or the political status\r\nof countries close to these possessions. The Monroe Doctrine, as\r\napplied to the American tropics, has thus become more than ever an\r\nindispensable national policy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine has involved\r\nincreasingly heavy responsibilities and burdens, because the commercial\r\nand financial interests of other countries in the Caribbean have\r\nalso increased as that region has been developed economically and\r\ncommercially. Even when they have had no ulterior political motives,\r\nthe European powers have been unable to stand by with equanimity while\r\nthe security and the interests of their citizens were endangered by\r\nthe continual revolutions and other disorders which have occurred in\r\nsome tropical American states. There has consequently been evident\r\nan increasing disposition on their part to use force both to secure\r\nprotection for their nationals and to obtain the payment of debts due\r\nto the latter by irresponsible and unscrupulous governments. To such\r\ninterventions, which necessarily tend to assume a political character,\r\nthe United States cannot possibly remain indifferent. Neither, however,\r\ncan it oppose itself to the protection by another country of the lives\r\nand property of the latter’s subjects. European interference in the\r\naffairs of American countries can only be averted if the United States\r\nitself assumes the duty of protecting foreigners in the more turbulent\r\nof the neighboring republics, and the Monroe Doctrine can only be\r\nupheld in the long run if intelligent and disinterested efforts are\r\nmade to help those republics to remedy the conditions which at present\r\nexpose them to aggression. As President Roosevelt said in 1905:\r\n\r\n “We cannot permanently adhere to the Monroe Doctrine unless we succeed\r\n in making it evident, in the first place, that we do not intend to\r\n treat it in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our\r\n part at the expense of the Republics to the south of us; second, that\r\n we do not intend to permit it to be used by any of these Republics\r\n as a shield to protect that Republic from the consequences of its\r\n own misdeeds against foreign nations; third, that inasmuch as by\r\n this doctrine we prevent other nations from interfering on this side\r\n of the water, we shall ourselves in good faith try to help those of\r\n our sister republics which need such help, upward toward peace and\r\n order.”[45]\r\n\r\nThe first occasion on which the new policy of the United States became\r\nevident in its dealings with the Central American republics was in\r\n1906, when there was a war between Guatemala and Salvador, in which\r\nHonduras, as the ally of the latter country, also became involved. The\r\nconflict had arisen from the aid furnished by some of the officials\r\nof Salvador to a revolutionary movement directed against President\r\nEstrada Cabrera. After exerting his influence in vain to prevent the\r\noutbreak of hostilities, President Roosevelt invited President Díaz\r\nof Mexico to join him in offering mediation. The efforts of the two\r\ngovernments, seconded by those of Costa Rica, resulted in the holding\r\nof a peace conference on the deck of the U. S. S. Marblehead, at\r\nwhich representatives of the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, and\r\nNicaragua were present, as well as the plenipotentiaries of the three\r\nbelligerents. At this meeting an agreement was signed providing for the\r\ncessation of hostilities and the disarmament of the contending forces,\r\nand for another conference, to be held later, to conclude a general\r\ntreaty of peace.[46]\r\n\r\nThe second conference was held at San José, Costa Rica, in September\r\nof the same year. Each of the Central American republics was invited\r\nto send delegates, and all did so with the exception of Nicaragua.\r\nPresident Zelaya declined because he was unwilling to recognize\r\nthe right of the United States to intervene in Central American\r\naffairs.[47] The governments, represented agreed that all differences\r\narising out of the late war should be arbitrated by the United States\r\nand Mexico, and that future disputes should be settled by Central\r\nAmerican tribunals, specially organized to deal with each case as it\r\narose. They pledged themselves to keep political refugees from other\r\nstates away from the frontiers of the countries from which they had\r\nbeen exiled, and not to allow their territory to be used as a base for\r\nrevolutionary movements against their neighbors. Provision was made\r\nalso for the establishment of a Central American Bureau in Guatemala\r\nCity and a pedagogical institute in Costa Rica; and general conventions\r\nwere signed regulating commerce, navigation, and extradition. The work\r\nof the San José Conference was superseded by that of the Washington\r\nConference of the following year, when the treaties entered into were\r\nreaffirmed and given greater weight by the moral support of the United\r\nStates and Mexico.[48]\r\n\r\nThe San José Conference was followed by a year of almost continuous\r\ndisorder. In December, 1906, a revolution was started in Honduras\r\nagainst the government of Manuel Bonilla. The rebels were operating\r\nclose to the Nicaraguan boundary, and it was asserted that they were\r\nreceiving aid from President Zelaya. Whether or not this was so, an\r\nalleged violation of Nicaraguan territory by the troops of Honduras\r\nsoon made war seem inevitable. At the urgent request of the United\r\nStates and of the other Central American republics, both Zelaya and\r\nBonilla agreed to submit the dispute to the arbitration of a tribunal\r\ncomposed of one member from each Central American republic, which met\r\nat once at San Salvador. Before taking up the matter in dispute, this\r\nbody demanded that both parties withdraw their armies from the border.\r\nAs Zelaya refused to do this, and furthermore declared in advance that\r\nhe would not accept any settlement which did not make full reparation\r\nfor the violation of the Nicaraguan frontier, the tribunal dissolved.\r\nZelaya at once declared war on Honduras, and sent forces to co-operate\r\nwith the revolutionists there. Salvador, on the other hand, assisted\r\nthe Bonilla administration, at first indirectly and later by sending\r\ntroops, although her government remained ostensibly neutral. Despite\r\nthis aid, Bonilla’s forces were completely defeated at Namasigue, on\r\nMarch 18, 1907, and not long afterward Tegucigalpa and Amapala, where\r\nBonilla made his last stand, were captured by the Nicaraguan troops\r\nand the Honduranean revolutionists. Miguel Dávila was inaugurated as\r\nprovisional president of Honduras.[49]\r\n\r\nBy this time, another general conflict seemed inevitable. Zelaya was\r\npreparing to attack Salvador, and President Estrada of Guatemala,\r\nfearing the extension of Nicaraguan influence, was apparently ready to\r\nintervene in defense of his neighbor. The United States and Mexico,\r\nhowever, at the request of the governments of Costa Rica, Guatemala,\r\nand Salvador, again exerted their good offices, and finally brought\r\nabout a conference at Amapala between the ministers of foreign affairs\r\nof Nicaragua and Salvador. Here, with the assistance of the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives of the United States, an effort was made to settle\r\nthe differences between these two countries. The chief question at\r\nissue was the presidency of Honduras, for Salvador declared that she\r\ncould not accept terms of peace which did not assure the existence of\r\na government in that Republic which would be satisfactory to her and\r\nto Guatemala, which had now become her ally against Zelaya. After a\r\nlong discussion of various names in an effort to find a candidate who\r\nwould not only be acceptable to all of the neighboring governments,\r\nbut who would also be able to maintain himself in power in Honduras,\r\nthe delegates finally agreed upon General Terencio Sierra, a former\r\npresident of Honduras, who was then in command of the Nicaraguan forces\r\nat Amapala. They accordingly signed a secret treaty, by which they\r\npledged themselves to overthrow the Dávila government and to set up one\r\nunder Sierra in its place. Nicaragua, however, as the fifth article\r\nstated, found it difficult to attack President Dávila, who was her\r\nally, and therefore left this to Salvador. After Dávila was disposed\r\nof, both were to join in assisting Sierra, and he was to be considered\r\nthe ally of both.[50] Having settled this matter, they drew up a\r\ngeneral peace treaty.\r\n\r\nThe terms of these treaties were never carried out. The exigencies of\r\nher internal politics prevented Salvador from supporting Sierra, and\r\nDávila was consequently able to establish himself firmly in power.\r\nHis government, set up by Nicaraguan arms, was of course perfectly\r\nacceptable to Zelaya, but the latter nevertheless made the failure\r\nof Salvador to carry out the stipulations of the Amapala agreement\r\na pretext for again beginning hostilities against that country.\r\nAnimated, as he said, by a desire for the union of Central America, he\r\nopenly aided a revolt against the government of President Figueroa,\r\nsending men and supplies to Acajutla on a Nicaraguan gunboat.[51] This\r\nexpedition was repulsed, and further hostilities were averted by the\r\nenergetic representations of the United States.\r\n\r\nZelaya’s avowed aggressive designs against the other states, and his\r\ncontrol over the government of Honduras, created a situation which\r\nwas intolerable to Guatemala and Salvador. It was soon evident that\r\nthese countries were planning to attack him, by the usual means of\r\naiding revolutions in Nicaragua and Honduras. The situation became\r\nvery threatening in the latter part of the summer of 1907, for the\r\nfour states were already massing armies on their frontiers. In view\r\nof the imminent danger of war, Presidents Roosevelt and Díaz jointly\r\noffered their mediation, and brought pressure to bear on the various\r\ngovernments to cease their hostile preparations. As a result, it was\r\nagreed that a conference should be held in Washington to settle all\r\noutstanding difficulties and permanently to establish the relations of\r\nthe Central American republics on a peaceful basis. The United States\r\nand Mexico were invited to appoint representatives “to lend their good\r\nand impartial offices in a purely friendly way towards the realization\r\nof the objects of the Conference.”[52]\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the five Central American countries met in the Bureau\r\nof American Republics on November 14, 1907. The United States was\r\nrepresented by Mr. William I. Buchanan, whose tact and perseverance\r\nwere inestimably valuable in the negotiations of the succeeding five\r\nweeks. Secretary of State Root and Señor Creel, the Mexican ambassador,\r\nmade speeches at the inaugural session, and the Conference began its\r\nwork under the most favorable auspices, animated by a spirit of mutual\r\ngood will and by a genuine desire to bring about peace in Central\r\nAmerica. Following the lead of Salvador, each government in turn\r\ndeclared that it had no claims or grievances against its neighbors,\r\nand that it was ready to proceed at once to a discussion of plans\r\nfor a closer union between the republics. A proposal by Nicaragua\r\nand Honduras for the immediate establishment of a Central American\r\nfederation caused a temporary interruption of the prevailing good\r\nfeeling, but harmony was soon restored, and the work of the Conference\r\nproceeded smoothly until December 20, when eight conventions,\r\nrepresenting the fruit of its deliberations, were signed by the\r\ndelegates.[53]\r\n\r\nThe first of these was a general treaty of peace and amity, by which\r\nthe five governments sought to remove several of the chief causes of\r\nrevolutions and international wars in the Isthmus, and to provide for a\r\ncloser co-operation in promoting their common interests. Among its most\r\nimportant provisions were the following:\r\n\r\n Article I. “The Republics of Central America ... bind themselves to\r\n always observe the most complete harmony, and decide every difference\r\n or difficulty that may arise amongst them, of whatever nature it may\r\n be, by means of the Central American Court of Justice created by the\r\n Convention which they have concluded for that purpose on this date.”\r\n\r\n Art. II. “... They declare that any disposition or measure which\r\n may tend to disturb the constitutional organization” [that is, the\r\n existing government] “of one of the Republics is to be deemed a menace\r\n to the peace of all.”\r\n\r\n Art. III. “Taking into account the central geographical position\r\n of Honduras, and the facilities which owing to this circumstance\r\n have made its territory most often the theater of Central American\r\n conflicts, Honduras declares from now on its absolute neutrality in\r\n event of any conflict between the other republics; and the latter, in\r\n their turn, provided such neutrality be observed, bind themselves to\r\n respect it, and in no case to violate the Honduranean territory.”\r\n\r\n Art. XVI. “... Desiring to prevent one of the most frequent causes\r\n of disturbances in the Republics, the contracting Governments shall\r\n not permit the leaders or principal chiefs of political refugees, or\r\n their agents, to reside in the departments bordering on the countries\r\n whose peace they might disturb.”\r\n\r\n Art. XVII. “Every person, no matter what his nationality, who, within\r\n the territory of one of the contracting parties, shall initiate or\r\n foster revolutionary movements against any of the others, shall be\r\n immediately brought to the capital of the Republic, where he shall be\r\n submitted to trial according to law.”\r\n\r\nThe other provisions of the treaty aimed to make the relations\r\nbetween the republics closer and more friendly, and to foster their\r\nco-operation for the furthering of their mutual interests. It\r\nprovided for a reciprocal recognition of the validity of judicial\r\nproceedings, professional degrees, patents, and copyrights. Citizens\r\nof each country, residing in the territory of one of the others, were\r\nto enjoy the same privileges as nationals of the latter, and were\r\nto be considered as citizens of the latter if they fulfilled other\r\nconstitutional requirements. Each Republic pledged itself to accredit\r\na permanent legation to each of the others, and agreed that its\r\ndiplomatic and consular agents in foreign countries should afford the\r\nsame protection to the persons, ships, and properties of the citizens\r\nof other Central American states as to their compatriots. Vessels\r\nof any Central American state were to receive the same treatment as\r\nnational vessels in the ports of others, and an agreement was to be\r\nentered into for the encouragement by subsidies of the coasting trade\r\nand of foreign steamship connections. The establishment of a practical\r\nagricultural school in Salvador, a school of mines and mechanics in\r\nHonduras, and one of arts and trades in Nicaragua, as well as the\r\nproposed pedagogical institute in Costa Rica and the Central American\r\nBureau in Guatemala, was recommended, although not specifically\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nAn additional convention to the General Treaty contained radical and\r\nrather impractical provisions aiming to make revolutions less frequent:\r\n\r\n Art. I. “The Governments of the High Contracting Parties shall not\r\n recognize any other Government which may come into power in any of the\r\n five Republics as a consequence of a _coup d’état_, or of a revolution\r\n against a recognized government, so long as the freely elected\r\n representatives of the people thereof have not constitutionally\r\n reorganized the country.”\r\n\r\n Art. II. “No Government of Central America shall in case of civil war\r\n intervene in favor of or against the Government of the country where\r\n the struggle takes place.”\r\n\r\n Art. III. “The Governments of Central America, in the first place, are\r\n recommended to endeavor to bring about, by the means at their command,\r\n a constitutional reform in the sense of prohibiting the re-election\r\n of the President of a Republic, where such prohibition does not\r\n exist; secondly, to adopt all measures necessary to effect a complete\r\n guarantee of the principle of alternation in power.”\r\n\r\nAnother convention established a Central American Court of Justice,\r\nconsisting of five judges, one to be elected by the legislature of each\r\nstate. To this tribunal, the five republics bound themselves “to submit\r\nall controversies or questions which may arise among them, of whatever\r\nnature and no matter what their origin may be, in case the respective\r\nDepartments of Foreign Affairs shall not have been able to reach an\r\nunderstanding.” The Court was also to take cognizance of suits which\r\ncitizens of one of the contracting parties might bring against the\r\ngovernment of one of the others on account of violation of treaties or\r\ndenial of justice and of the other cases of an international character,\r\nincluding those which two or more of the Central American governments,\r\nor one of them and a foreign government, might agree to submit to it.\r\nIt was to be “competent to determine its own jurisdiction, interpreting\r\nthe Treaties and Conventions germane to the matter in dispute, and\r\napplying the principles of international law.” Article XIII provided:\r\n\r\n “From the moment in which any suit is instituted against any one\r\n or more governments up to that in which a final decision has been\r\n pronounced, the Court may at the solicitation of any one of the\r\n parties fix the situation in which the contending parties must remain,\r\n to the end that the difficulty shall not be aggravated and that things\r\n shall be conserved in _statu quo_ pending a final decision.”\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of its duties, the Court might address itself to the\r\ngovernments or the tribunals of the respective states, to have its\r\norders carried out, or it might provide for securing their execution\r\nthrough special commissioners, whom the parties were to assist in every\r\nway possible. The latter solemnly bound themselves to submit to the\r\njudgments of the Court, and agreed “to lend all moral support that may\r\nbe necessary in order that they may be properly fulfilled.”\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to secure the complete independence of the\r\nCourt. It was to sit at Cartago, Costa Rica,[54] where it would be\r\nmore free from political or personal pressure than in some other parts\r\nof the Isthmus. The judges were to serve for five years, receiving\r\na fixed salary paid out of the treasury of the Court, to which each\r\nstate contributed, and enjoying the privileges and immunities of\r\ndiplomatic agents; and they were not to exercise their profession or\r\nhold public office during their term of service. They were not to\r\nconsider themselves barred from sitting in a case to which their\r\nown governments were parties, for they were to represent, not the\r\nindividual states, but the “national conscience of Central America.”\r\n\r\nAn additional article proposed to give the Court “jurisdiction over\r\nthe conflicts which may arise between the Legislative, Executive, and\r\nJudicial powers--when as a matter of fact the judicial decisions and\r\nthe resolutions of the National Congress are not respected.” This\r\nprovision, which would have authorized the tribunal to intervene in\r\nthe internal affairs of the contracting powers in times of internal\r\ndisorder, was never ratified.\r\n\r\nThe Convention which established the Central American Bureau recognized\r\ncertain interests as being “those to which special attention should\r\nbe paid.” These were: “the peaceful reorganization of their mother\r\ncountry, Central America”; the establishment of a broad, practical,\r\nand complete system of education of an essentially Central American\r\ncharacter; the development of commerce and the advancement of\r\nagriculture and industry; and the uniformity of civil, commercial,\r\nand criminal legislation, customs tariffs, and monetary systems. The\r\nfunctions of the Bureau were to be all those considered necessary and\r\nexpedient to achieve the objects placed in its care. It was to have an\r\norgan of publicity, and was to serve as a center for the distribution\r\nof information about Central American conditions both in the Isthmus\r\nand in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, several other conventions were signed. One provided\r\nfor the extradition of criminals; another for the establishment of a\r\npedagogical institute directed by the government of Costa Rica but\r\nsupported by all of the others; another for the co-operation of the\r\nfive countries in making plans for the construction of the Central\r\nAmerican sections of the Pan American railway and the improvement of\r\nother means of intercommunication. By still another treaty, each of\r\nthe contracting governments obligated itself to name one or more\r\ncommissions to study the currency systems, customs tariffs, weights and\r\nmeasures, and other matters of an economic and fiscal nature in their\r\nrespective countries. After these had reported, delegates were to be\r\nappointed to a Central American Conference, which was to discuss the\r\nmeasures recommended by the commissioners, and especially the reform\r\nof the various currency systems on a gold basis. Similar conferences\r\nwere to be held annually thereafter to consider matters which the\r\ngovernments might agree to submit to them.\r\n\r\nThe Conference’s program for the political and economic regeneration\r\nof the Isthmus was obviously too ambitious to be carried out at\r\nonce, for evils arising from deep-rooted habits and fundamental\r\nsocial conditions could not be done away with by mere international\r\nagreement, however sincere the contracting parties might be in their\r\ndesire for peace and for a realization of a closer union. No one\r\ncould reasonably expect that the five governments would turn at once\r\nfrom their attitude of mutual suspicion and hostility to a harmonious\r\nco-operation in undertakings for their common welfare. Neither of the\r\ntwo main objects of the Washington Conventions,--the elimination of\r\ncivil and international wars and the creation of closer ties between\r\nthe five republics with a view to uniting them eventually under one\r\ngovernment,--seemed to have been realized to any appreciable extent in\r\nthe years immediately following 1907, and this led many who had hoped\r\nthat there would at once be a marked improvement in international\r\nrelations to brand the treaties as a failure. A careful examination\r\nof their results, however, shows that the treaties have been very far\r\nfrom a failure, even though their effects have as yet only begun to\r\nmake themselves felt. Both of the objects of the Conference have been\r\nrealized to some extent, and there is every prospect that they will be\r\nrealized more and more fully as time goes on.\r\n\r\nAt first, indeed, there was little change in the relations between\r\nthe five republics. Some of the governments, and especially that of\r\nNicaragua, showed little inclination to carry out the obligations\r\nof the conventions in good faith. President Zelaya, who already\r\npractically controlled Honduras through the Dávila government,\r\ncontinued his machinations against the tranquillity of other\r\nneighboring states, directing his efforts mainly towards placing one of\r\nhis own supporters in the presidency of Salvador. His open assistance\r\nto Prudencio Alfaro, who made repeated attempts to invade that republic\r\nin 1908 and 1909, finally forced the United States to authorize the\r\ncommanders of its naval vessels in Central American waters to use force\r\nto prevent the launching of filibustering expeditions from Nicaraguan\r\nports.[55] Zelaya’s policy created a situation which was intolerable\r\nto Guatemala and Salvador, and soon convinced all who were interested\r\nin Central American affairs that he was the greatest obstacle to\r\nthe establishment of permanent peace in the Isthmus. President Taft\r\nexpressed this belief in his annual message to Congress in December,\r\n1909, when he said:\r\n\r\n “Since the Washington Conventions of 1907 were communicated to the\r\n Government of the United States as a consulting and advising party,\r\n this Government has been almost continuously called upon by one or\r\n another, and in turn by all of the five Central American republics,\r\n to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Nearly every\r\n complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which\r\n has kept Central America in constant tension and turmoil.”\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the summer of 1908, a band of revolutionists\r\ninvaded Honduras from Salvador, and another band, led by General Lee\r\nChristmas, an American soldier of fortune, attacked some of the towns\r\non the north coast of that republic. There was little doubt in the\r\nminds of well-informed people that one or both of Zelaya’s principal\r\nenemies, the Presidents of Guatemala and Salvador, were aiding the\r\nrevolutionists with a view to striking at him through the government\r\nof Honduras. Zelaya at once prepared for war, and the treaties of\r\npeace, hardly six months old, seemed to have been forgotten. The United\r\nStates and Mexico, however, made strong representations to all the\r\nparties concerned, and Costa Rica, by a happy inspiration, suggested\r\nto the newly established Central American Court that it interpose\r\nits influence to prevent the threatened conflict. On July 8, this\r\ntribunal addressed a telegram to the presidents of Guatemala, Salvador,\r\nHonduras, and Nicaragua, urging them to submit their differences to\r\narbitration. On receipt of this communication, Nicaragua and Honduras\r\nmade formal complaints to the Court in accordance with the terms of the\r\nWashington Conventions,--Honduras charging that Guatemala and Salvador\r\nhad fomented and assisted the revolution, and had failed to restrain\r\nthe Honduranean exiles residing in their territory, and Nicaragua\r\nappearing as an interested party. The Court acted with promptness and\r\ndecision. The complainants were asked to submit proofs in support of\r\ntheir charges, and Guatemala, Salvador, and Nicaragua were ordered to\r\nrefrain from any military movements which might suggest intervention\r\nin the internal affairs of Honduras, and to reduce their forces to a\r\npeace basis. These messages were transmitted and answered by telegraph,\r\nso that within five days of the Court’s first note a _modus vivendi_\r\nhad been established and the immediate danger of a conflict had been\r\ndispelled. After Guatemala and Salvador complied with the orders of\r\nthe Court, the revolution in Honduras subsided. The Court handed down\r\nits decision on December 19, 1908. Salvador was absolved of all\r\nresponsibility for the revolution in Honduras by the votes of the\r\njudges representing Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica against those\r\nof the judges from Honduras and Nicaragua. Guatemala was exonerated by\r\nall except the representative of Honduras. This decision was severely\r\ncriticised by many persons in Central America, and it lost much of its\r\nforce from the fact that most of the judges had obviously voted as the\r\ninterests of the governments which named them dictated. There could\r\nbe no doubt, however, that the Court had averted a general Central\r\nAmerican war, and had thus done a signal service to the cause of\r\npeace.[56]\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear that the Washington Conventions would have\r\nlittle effect so long as Zelaya continued to be president of Nicaragua.\r\nWhen a revolution broke out against him in the fall of 1909, therefore,\r\nit was regarded with more sympathy and favor by those who had been\r\ninterested in the work of the Conference than was consistent with the\r\nspirit, at least, of the Conference’s acts. The attitude of the United\r\nStates and of the other Central American governments, as we shall see\r\nin the next chapter, did much to make this uprising a success. Zelaya’s\r\ndefeat naturally involved the fall of Dávila a short time afterward.\r\n\r\nAfter the elimination of Zelaya, the beneficial effects of the\r\nConventions began to show themselves somewhat more than had been\r\npossible while the same conditions which had caused the disturbances\r\nof the years 1906-7 had continued to exist. It became evident after\r\n1910 that they marked a turning point in the relations of the five\r\nrepublics. Since that year, and in fact, if we except occasional\r\nattempts to render covert aid to revolutions, since 1907, there has not\r\nbeen one international war in Central America. It would be difficult\r\nto point to another ten years in the history of the Isthmus of which\r\nthis has been true. It is, moreover, hardly conceivable under present\r\nconditions, and especially in view of the influence exerted in behalf\r\nof peace by the United States, that there should be an armed conflict\r\nbetween two or more of the five republics. The principal object of the\r\nWashington Conference may therefore be said to have been realized.\r\nThe change which has taken place has been in large part due to the\r\nfact that the five countries themselves have generally abided by the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty of Amity and the Treaty establishing the\r\nCentral American Court, for they have refrained from sending troops\r\nto intervene in one another’s internal affairs, and have shown a\r\nreadiness which had been rare before 1907 to submit differences which\r\narose between them to settlement by diplomatic means or arbitration\r\nrather than by a resort to arms. Their relations with one another\r\nhave undoubtedly been improved by the new spirit which the Conference\r\ncalled into being, and their feeling of common nationality and their\r\nreadiness to co-operate for the realization of their mutual purposes\r\nand ambitions have been strengthened by an increasing realization of\r\nthe external dangers which confront a Central America divided and\r\ndistracted by internal wars.\r\n\r\nThe Conventions did less to bring about stability of government in\r\nthe individual states, but even in this their effect has been by\r\nno means negligible. Internal disorders cannot, of course, be done\r\naway with while their fundamental causes remain; and the convention\r\nproviding that governments coming into office by the use of force\r\nshould not be recognized until after they had received the approval\r\nof the voters at a popular election, and that the state constitutions\r\nshould be so amended as to insure alternation in power, have been\r\nentirely disregarded. Nevertheless, revolutionary uprisings have been\r\nmade decidedly less frequent by the fact that several of the republics\r\nhave faithfully observed their obligations to exercise surveillance\r\nover political exiles from neighboring countries and not to encourage\r\nor permit the organization within their territories of attempts to\r\noverthrow nearby governments. Enemies of the established order in one\r\nof the republics now find it far more difficult than ever before to\r\nsecure the base of operations and the financial and military assistance\r\nwhich are usually indispensable for the success of a revolt.\r\n\r\nThe measure of success which the work of the Conference has attained\r\nhas been very largely due to the energetic support by the United States\r\nof the principles which it established. The government at Washington\r\nhas several times intervened diplomatically, or even by the use of\r\nforce, to prevent violations of the more important conventions, to\r\nwhich it was practically, if not formally, a party. In doing this,\r\nit has usually acted upon the invitation of one or the other of the\r\nfive republics. It has not hesitated to use any means necessary to\r\nprevent unjustified attacks by one country on another, and it has\r\noften brought strong pressure to bear to deter the signatory powers\r\nfrom permitting their territory to be used as a base of revolutionary\r\noperations against their neighbors. Sometimes North American influence\r\nhas apparently been the only factor which has secured respect for\r\nthe obligations imposed by the peace treaty, for one or two of the\r\nparties which signed that treaty have shown little disposition to abide\r\nby its provisions and have thus endangered the peace of the Isthmus\r\ndespite the fact that their neighbors were endeavoring to carry out the\r\nprovisions of the Conventions in good faith.\r\n\r\nThe Central American Court of Justice, which was to have been the\r\ncrowning work of the Conference, has not entirely fulfilled the\r\nexpectations of its founders. It cannot be said to be a tribunal\r\nindependent of and superior to the five governments, to which\r\nany aggrieved person or state may appeal in the confidence of\r\nsecuring justice. Several of the men appointed as judges have been\r\ndistinguished lawyers of conspicuous ability and undoubted integrity,\r\nbut at the same time there have been others, sometimes constituting\r\nthe majority of the Court, who have owed their nominations purely\r\nto domestic political considerations. The honor and the large\r\nsalary attached to them have made the judgeships one of the most\r\nattractive positions in the gift of the state governments, and there\r\nhas consequently been a keen competition for them among prominent\r\npoliticians, which has made it more difficult to select a man solely\r\non his merits. In addition to this, the importance of controlling the\r\nCourt as a means of influencing the international politics of the\r\nIsthmus has made almost inevitable the appointment of men who could\r\nbe relied upon to vote as their governments wished when important\r\nquestions were at issue. The control exerted over the judges by the\r\npowers which named them has prevented the Court from becoming in any\r\ntrue sense independent, and has given it the position of a standing\r\ncommission of distinguished diplomats rather than that of a true court\r\nof justice. This was perhaps inevitable, because the states of the\r\nIsthmus, which had never known a judicial tribunal not subject in some\r\ndegree at least to official influence, could hardly grasp the idea of\r\nan international body which would be entirely free from the dictation\r\nof the authority which created it. There has been, therefore, no strong\r\nforce of public opinion to support the Court in asserting its right to\r\nspeak for the “National Conscience of Central America,” and even the\r\njudges themselves have shown little inclination to seize and hold the\r\nposition of complete freedom from control with which the Washington\r\nConference had intended to invest them.\r\n\r\nThat this was true was evident in the first case that was brought\r\nbefore the tribunal. In deciding the suit of Honduras and Nicaragua\r\nagainst Guatemala and Salvador in 1908, each of the judges from the\r\nfour states interested voted, as we have seen, on the side supported\r\nby the country which had appointed him. The general belief that the\r\ndictation of the governments involved, rather than the facts as shown\r\nby the evidence, had determined the decision of this question, did\r\nmuch to injure the Court and to deprive it of public confidence. Its\r\nindependence suffered another serious blow as the result of the action\r\ntaken in another question which arose three years later after the\r\nrevolution in Nicaragua. The government which succeeded Zelaya failed\r\nto contribute its share towards the expenses of the Court, in which\r\nthe judge appointed by the late administration was still sitting.\r\nNow the salaries of the judges, according to the convention founding\r\nthe tribunal, were to be paid out of the latter’s treasury, from a\r\ngeneral fund to which each of the states contributed. In this way\r\nthe Conference had hoped to establish the financial independence of\r\nthe judges with respect to their governments, but its intention does\r\nnot seem to have been carried out, for the refusal of Nicaragua to\r\ncontribute her quota was regarded as the equivalent of withholding her\r\njudge’s salary. The latter was thus forced to withdraw temporarily from\r\nthe Court, whereupon that body, instead of calling upon the substitute\r\nprovided by its constitution, admitted a new magistrate appointed\r\nby the Conservative government of Nicaragua. This action entirely\r\ndisillusioned those who had hoped that the Court would be above party\r\npolitics and independent of outside pressure, for it established the\r\ndependence of the judges on the governments that named them, and\r\nconstituted a recognition by the tribunal itself of the fact that its\r\nmembers were representatives of the administration in power in their\r\nrespective countries, rather than magistrates whose tenure was secure\r\nwithout regard to political changes during their legal term of office.\r\n\r\nSince its action in averting a general war in 1908, the Court has been\r\nmore ornamental than useful. It has served as a symbol of Central\r\nAmerican unity, and it has kept alive the principle of international\r\narbitration, but it has actually decided very few cases. Three or\r\nfour suits have been brought against the government of one of the\r\ncountries by citizens of another, charging violation of treaty rights\r\nor denial of justice, but the Court has refused in every instance to\r\nadjudicate them, on the ground that the petitioners had not exhausted\r\nthe means of redress at their disposal in the countries where they\r\nclaimed that they had been mistreated. It also refused to intervene in\r\nthe internal affairs of Costa Rica in 1914 to determine the validity\r\nof a presidential election. During the two revolutions in Nicaragua,\r\nin 1910 and 1912, it endeavored to bring about an agreement between\r\nthe contending factions, and in 1912 it even sent a commission of\r\nits members to confer with the rival leaders; but its efforts came\r\nto naught in both cases because the Conservatives, who had the moral\r\nsupport of the United States, were confident of their ability to defeat\r\ntheir opponents, and therefore refused to agree to a compromise.\r\n\r\nIts most recent, and in many ways its most important decisions, were\r\nthose handed down on September 30, 1916, and March 2, 1917, in the\r\nsuits brought against Nicaragua by Costa Rica and Salvador, which\r\nclaimed that their rights had been violated by the recent treaty\r\nbetween that country and the United States. The Court refused to\r\ndeclare the treaty void, saying that it had no jurisdiction over the\r\nUnited States, but it held, nevertheless, that the complainants’ rights\r\nhad been violated, thus condemning Nicaragua’s action as illegal. This\r\ncase has raised a very serious question as to the extent to which the\r\nauthority of the tribunal will be recognized. Despite Nicaragua’s\r\nrefusal to appear as a party to the case or to accept the verdict,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the Court had jurisdiction over the question\r\nat issue, or that Nicaragua is bound, by the Washington Conventions,\r\nto respect its decision. Whether she will do so, however, seems very\r\ndoubtful. If she continues in her refusal, and is supported in her\r\nattitude by the Government of the United States, the prestige of the\r\nCourt will be seriously impaired, if, indeed, its very existence is not\r\nendangered. It is already rather unpopular because of the expense which\r\nit involves and because it has accomplished so little, and it seems\r\nprobable that it would have been disbanded before this if the United\r\nStates had not exerted a strong influence in behalf of its continuance.\r\n\r\nThe measures planned by the Conference for promoting closer economic\r\nrelations between the five republics have only been carried out in\r\npart, and their results have been far from satisfactory. Although the\r\nprovisions for granting citizens of each Central American state the\r\nrights of citizens in all the others, and the mutual recognition of\r\nprofessional degrees, patents, and copyrights, have undoubtedly done\r\nmuch to encourage travel and commerce and to promote good feeling, the\r\nmore ambitious projects outlined in the Conventions have been almost,\r\nif not quite, fruitless. Few of the educational institutions which\r\nthe Conference contemplated have been established, and those which\r\nindividual states have founded as a result of its recommendations have\r\nnot attained a truly international character because of the reluctance\r\nof other governments to appropriate money for their support. The\r\nCentral American conferences met annually for five years, drawing up\r\nconventions for the reform of the currency and fiscal systems, the\r\nestablishment of free trade, the adoption of a comprehensive unified\r\nsystem of education, and the improvement of interstate communications;\r\nbut they were finally discontinued because none of their work had been\r\ngiven any practical effect by the governments. The Central American\r\nBureau (Oficina Internacional Centroamericana) has perhaps been the\r\nonly institution provided for at the meeting in 1907 which has thus\r\nfar fully justified its creation. This office, which has been sort of\r\na clearing house for statistical and other data, has done much useful\r\nwork in distributing commercial information in Central America and\r\nabroad, and has also served as an international agency for elaborating\r\nplans for joint action on subjects of general importance. Its organ,\r\n“Centro America,” is the most important periodical published in the\r\nIsthmus.\r\n\r\nIt is still too early to attempt a final estimate of the results\r\nof the Washington Conference, or to judge of the ultimate economic\r\nand political effects of its work. Some of the stipulations of the\r\nconventions adopted by it have never been carried out, and others have\r\nbeen rendered obsolete by the events of the last ten years, but in the\r\nmain the agreements entered into are still in force, and are by no\r\nmeans without practical value. The provisions restraining the states\r\nfrom interfering in one another’s affairs and binding them to submit\r\ntheir disputes to arbitration cannot but make a great change in the\r\npolitical conditions of the Isthmus, if the five countries continue to\r\nobserve them and if the United States continues to exert its influence\r\nto secure respect for them. The spirit of Central American unity, which\r\ninspired the actions of the Conference, is growing stronger daily as\r\nthe states realize more fully their dependence upon one another and\r\nthe importance of presenting a united front to the world. It seems not\r\nimprobable that the meeting in Washington in 1907 will be looked back\r\nupon in the future as a turning point in the history of the Isthmus,\r\nmarking a first and decisive step towards the elimination of the\r\ninternational and internal wars which had hitherto been so frequent and\r\nso destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] Quoted by Critchfield (_American Supremacy_, Vol. II, p. 419) from\r\na speech made at Chautauqua.\r\n\r\n[46] U.

They won over Juan J. Estrada, the governor\r\nof the province of which that city is the capital, by proclaiming him\r\nprovisional president, and thus secured control of most of the East\r\nCoast of the Republic. Money and supplies were obtained from some of\r\nthe other Central American countries, and also from the foreign colony\r\non the Coast, whose interests had been injured by certain concessions\r\nwhich President Zelaya had recently granted. This assistance, and the\r\nprotection afforded by the wild country which separated Bluefields\r\nfrom the rest of the Republic, enabled the revolutionists to raise a\r\nconsiderable army and to organize a _de facto_ government before the\r\nconstituted authorities were able to attack them.\r\n\r\nThe uprising was from the first regarded with sympathy throughout\r\nCentral America and in Washington, for Zelaya’s continual encouragement\r\nof revolutions in other countries had made him obnoxious to all of his\r\nneighbors, and had led to a general belief that his administration was\r\nthe principal obstacle to the establishment of peace in the Isthmus.\r\nThe relations between Nicaragua and the United States had been strained\r\nfor some time, because of the friction caused by Zelaya’s violations\r\nof the Washington Conventions, and because there had been a number of\r\nunpleasant diplomatic incidents, including the prolonged dispute over\r\nthe so-called Emery claim,[57] which had culminated in the withdrawal\r\nof the American minister from Managua. Nevertheless, both the United\r\nStates and the other Central American countries remained at first\r\nostensibly neutral in the contest. In November, however, the execution\r\nby Zelaya’s troops of two American soldiers of fortune, who held\r\ncommissions in the revolutionary army, caused President Taft to break\r\noff diplomatic relations with the Liberal administration entirely, and\r\nto give the revolution his open, if indirect, support.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the American government was set forth in a note\r\naddressed by Secretary of State Knox to the Nicaraguan Chargé\r\nd’Affaires at Washington. “Since the Washington Conference of\r\n1907,” it stated, “it is notorious that President Zelaya has almost\r\ncontinuously kept Central America in tension and turmoil.” The Liberal\r\nadministration was described as “a regime which unfortunately has been\r\na blot upon the history of Nicaragua.” The murder of American citizens\r\nwas but the culmination of a series of outrages which had made friendly\r\nrelations between the two governments impossible. Moreover, the United\r\nStates was convinced “that the revolution represents the ideals and\r\nthe will of a majority of the Nicaraguan people more faithfully\r\nthan does the Government of President Zelaya.” The revolution, the\r\nSecretary said, had already attained serious proportions on the East\r\nCoast, and new uprisings were reported in the West. This tended to\r\nproduce “a condition of anarchy which leaves, at a given time, no\r\ndefinite, responsible source to which the Government of the United\r\nStates could look for reparation for the killing of Messrs. Cannon and\r\nGroce, or indeed, for the protection which must be assured American\r\ncitizens and American interests in Nicaragua. In these circumstances,\r\nthe President no longer feels for the Government of President Zelaya\r\nthat respect and confidence which would make it appropriate hereafter\r\nto maintain with it regular diplomatic relations, implying the will\r\nand the ability to respect and assure what is due from one state to\r\nanother.” Both factions were to be held responsible for the protection\r\nof American life and property in the sections under their control. The\r\nUnited States would wait, before demanding reparation for the murders,\r\nuntil it saw whether or not the government which was in power after\r\nthe revolution was “entirely dissociated from the present intolerable\r\nconditions.” Meanwhile it reserved the liberty to take such action as\r\nit saw fit to preserve its interests, and the State Department would\r\ncontinue to receive unofficially both the former Chargé d’Affaires and\r\nthe representative of the revolution.[58]\r\n\r\nThis note brought about Zelaya’s fall, for he realized that he could\r\nnot hope to maintain himself against the open opposition of the\r\nUnited States. After vainly attempting to come to an understanding\r\nwith Secretary Knox, the Nicaraguan ruler yielded to the advice of\r\nPresident Díaz of Mexico and to the pleas of his friends at home, and\r\nresigned his position to Dr. José Madriz, one of the most distinguished\r\ncitizens of Leon. The Liberals had hoped to placate the United States\r\nby making president a civilian of known ability and honesty, but their\r\nexpectations were disappointed, for President Taft refused to recognize\r\nthe new executive.[59] The revolutionists also declined his offer to\r\nopen peace negotiations.\r\n\r\nFor a time, nevertheless, it appeared probable that President Madriz\r\nwould be able to restore order. On February 22, 1910, a revolutionary\r\narmy which attempted to invade the lake region was defeated and almost\r\ndestroyed, and Estrada and the other leaders, with the remnants of\r\ntheir troops, were forced to retire to Bluefields. The government\r\nat once prepared to attack that city vigorously by land and by sea,\r\nproclaiming a blockade of the port, and occupying the Bluff, where the\r\ncustoms house was situated. The final reduction of the rebel army,\r\nhowever, proved impossible. The officers of the American warships,\r\nwhich had been sent to the port at the outbreak of the war, refused\r\nto allow the blockading squadron to interfere with American ships or\r\nships carrying American goods, and denied the right of the Government\r\nofficials to collect customs duties at the Bluff, permitting Estrada to\r\nestablish a new customs house in the territory under his control. When\r\nthe Liberal commanders, thus prevented from cutting off the supplies or\r\nthe revenues of the insurgents, prepared to take the town by assault,\r\nthe American commander forbade them to attack it from the land side,\r\nand threatened to sink the gunboats if they shelled the rebel trenches.\r\nThis action, taken on the ground that a bombardment or fighting in the\r\nstreets would destroy the property of Americans and other foreigners,\r\nrendered certain the defeat of the Government army, which could not\r\nlong remain encamped far from its base of supplies in the hot and\r\nunhealthful coast district outside of the city. Within a few weeks the\r\nbesiegers were forced to withdraw into the interior.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals in control at the capital, who had already lost the\r\nsympathy of many of Zelaya’s former supporters by their wholesale\r\npolitical arrests and their partisan policy, were completely\r\ndiscredited by their failure to take Bluefields, and their government\r\ncollapsed entirely when Estrada again approached the interior with\r\na reinforced army. There were new outbreaks at several points in the\r\nlake region which it was impossible to suppress. Madriz left Managua\r\non August 20, 1910, and the revolutionists entered the city on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary forces were composed mainly of adherents of the\r\nwealthy Conservative families of Granada, but there were also many\r\nLiberals, some of whom had been prominent leaders in the revolt, who\r\nhad joined the uprising either from personal hostility to Zelaya or\r\nfrom the hope of gaining something for themselves. The new provisional\r\npresident, Juan J. Estrada, was a member of the artisan class of\r\nManagua, who had been raised by Zelaya to the position of governor of\r\nthe East Coast province, and whose leadership had been accepted by the\r\nConservatives only because the success of their plot at the beginning\r\ndepended upon his betraying his patron and turning over to them the\r\ngarrison at Bluefields. Another Liberal, General José María Moncada,\r\nwho had for several years been an opponent of Zelaya, became minister\r\nof _gobernación_ in the new government, and was one of the most trusted\r\nadvisors of the provisional president. The minister of war, General\r\nLuís Mena, had formerly been a follower of the Chamorro family, but\r\nhis military exploits during the recent struggle and his influence\r\nwith the army had given him a prestige which threatened to eclipse\r\nthat of his former patrons, and had made him the most powerful figure\r\nin the administration. None of these men were liked or trusted by the\r\nold Granada aristocracy, who had hoped through the success of the\r\nrevolution to regain the power which they had enjoyed during the thirty\r\nyears before Zelaya became president. Even the _Granadinos_, however,\r\nwere not entirely united among themselves, for there was no little\r\njealousy between some of the great families. General Emiliano Chamorro,\r\nwho had for many years been the leader of Conservative revolts against\r\nZelaya, had a strong following among the members of his party in all\r\nsections of the Republic, but he was opposed by a faction headed by\r\nthe Cuadra family, who subsequently became very powerful through their\r\nalliance with President Adolfo Díaz. It is necessary to bear in mind\r\nthese rivalries between the different leaders and groups in the new\r\nadministration, in order to understand the political difficulties which\r\nconfronted it during the two years following its accession to power.\r\n\r\nThe agreement by which the Liberals had turned over the government to\r\nthe revolutionary leaders had provided for a general amnesty, for a\r\nfree election to be held within one year, and for the recognition of\r\nthe debts contracted by both parties during the struggle. Little or\r\nno attention was paid to the two former articles, but the debts of\r\nboth parties,--to members of the revolutionary forces,--were fully\r\nrecognized, and, in so far as the condition of the treasury permitted,\r\npaid. Each person who had taken part in the revolt received fifty\r\nhectares (about 123 acres) of the national lands, and vast sums were\r\nawarded to prominent members of the Conservative party who had suffered\r\nunder the Zelaya regime from confiscation or forced loans, or even from\r\n“moral” injuries, such as the death of a close relative. A large sum\r\nwhich had been left in the treasury by Dr. Madriz was soon exhausted,\r\nand new issues of unsecured paper money were resorted to. By April,\r\n1911, the government admitted that the already depreciated currency\r\nhad been further inflated to the extent of 15,000,000 pesos, and in\r\nthe autumn of the same year 10,000,000 pesos more were secretly put\r\ninto circulation.[60] Some of this money was necessarily used to meet\r\nthe current expenses of the government, for the revenues had suffered\r\na serious decline since the revolution, but the greater part seems to\r\nhave gone to those in power and to their friends and relatives.\r\n\r\nThe emptiness of the treasury, accompanied by the inflation of the\r\ncurrency to twice its former quantity, made worse the already desperate\r\neconomic situation of the country. The revolution had paralyzed\r\nagriculture and commerce, not only by taking thousands of workers\r\naway from their fields and shops, but also by the actual destruction\r\nof cattle and crops, and by the complete disorganization of the\r\ntransportation system. The discontent caused by these conditions made\r\nthe position of the new government very precarious, for the Liberals,\r\nwho outnumbered the Conservatives in the country at large, had no\r\nintention of accepting their defeat as final. They felt that they had\r\nbeen beaten, not through the superior strength of their enemies, but by\r\nthe intervention of the United States; and they were encouraged to keep\r\nup an active opposition to the government by the hope of returning to\r\npower through the dissensions which soon appeared among the different\r\nchiefs of the Conservative party. The opposition press, which for a\r\nfew months enjoyed and abused an unwonted liberty, kept party feeling\r\nat the boiling point, and the bitterness between the two factions was\r\ngreatly intensified by a bloody clash between government troops and the\r\nmembers of a peaceful Liberal parade at Leon in November, 1911. The\r\nConservative administration, bankrupt and divided within itself, seemed\r\nfor a time utterly unable to cope with the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Republic was saved from falling into a condition of complete\r\nanarchy only by the assistance rendered to the new government by\r\nthe United States. In October, 1910, the State Department sent Mr.\r\nThomas C. Dawson to Managua to study the situation and to bring about\r\nan understanding between the Conservative leaders. Through his good\r\noffices, the so-called Dawson agreement was signed on November 5 by\r\nthe principal leaders of the revolution. This arrangement provided\r\nfor the continuance of Estrada at the head of the government, for the\r\nappointment of a commission containing American members to pass on\r\nall claims against the government arising out of the recent war and\r\nout of the cancellation of concessions granted by Zelaya, and for the\r\nnegotiation of a loan treaty in the United States.[61] A constitutional\r\nconvention which met on December 31 elected Estrada provisional\r\npresident for two years, and Adolfo Díaz vice-president. The new\r\nadministration was at once officially recognized by the United States.\r\n\r\nEstrada’s position was by no means an easy one. He could rely neither\r\nupon the military power, which was entirely in the hands of General\r\nMena, nor upon the Constitutional Convention, which was composed\r\nchiefly of followers of Emiliano Chamorro. The rival ambitions of\r\nthe different leaders soon broke down the political arrangements\r\nestablished by the Dawson agreement. When the Convention framed a\r\nconstitution which would have made itself rather than the president\r\nthe actual authority in the state, Estrada dissolved it, thus breaking\r\nwith Chamorro, who left the country. Estrada later attempted to remove\r\nfrom office and imprison General Mena, who had used his control of the\r\narmy to fill a new constituent assembly with his personal followers.\r\nThe military leaders remained loyal to their chief, and prepared to\r\nsecure his release by force. Only the intervention of the United States\r\nminister averted fighting in the streets of Managua. Estrada and\r\nMoncada, the minister of _gobernación_, resigned, and Díaz succeeded to\r\nthe presidency, with the consent of Mena. The minister of war was for\r\nsome months the real head of the government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the plans for the financial reorganization of the Republic,\r\nwhich had also been a part of the Dawson agreement, had assumed\r\ndefinite form. Early in 1911, a study of the situation had been made\r\nby a financial advisor appointed by Estrada at the suggestion of the\r\nState Department. The pecuniary difficulties which confronted the new\r\ngovernment were growing very serious. Foreign creditors, supported by\r\ntheir governments, were urgently demanding the payment of interest\r\non the bonded debt, and several claimants were seeking compensation\r\nfor concessions which the revolutionists had cancelled or violated.\r\nThe treasury was practically empty, and the repeated issues of paper\r\nmoney which had been resorted to to provide funds had disorganized the\r\ncurrency to such an extent that fluctuations in the rate of exchange\r\nmade foreign commerce almost impossible.[62]\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1911, a treaty was signed with the United States, by which\r\nthat country agreed to assist Nicaragua in securing a loan from\r\nAmerican bankers for the consolidation of its internal and external\r\ndebt and for other purposes. The loan was to be secured by the customs\r\nduties, which were to be collected, so long as the bonds remained\r\nunpaid, by an official appointed by Nicaragua from a list presented\r\nby the fiscal agent of the loan and approved by the President of the\r\nUnited States.[63] The treaty was similar in every way to that signed\r\nin January of the same year by the United States and Honduras, and,\r\nlike it, was never ratified by the United States Senate. On September\r\n1, while it was still under consideration by the Senate, contracts\r\nwere signed by which Brown Brothers and Company and J. and W. Seligman\r\nand Company, of New York, agreed to lend the Republic fifteen million\r\ndollars when the treaty went into effect. The bankers were to purchase\r\nthe Republic’s bonds, bearing five per cent interest, at 90¹⁄₂ per cent\r\nof their face value, and the money thus received was to be employed\r\nfor the reform of the currency, the construction of railroads from the\r\ninterior to Matagalpa and to the Atlantic Coast, and the refunding\r\nof the external and the internal debts. As there was little hope of\r\nimmediate action on the loan treaty, for the United States Congress\r\nhad adjourned, the bankers agreed to purchase of the Republic six per\r\ncent treasury bills to the amount of $1,500,000, in order to provide\r\nfunds for the most needed reform, an immediate reorganization of the\r\ncurrency. These were guaranteed by the customs revenues, which were to\r\nbe administered until the notes were retired by a collector general\r\ndesignated by the bankers. The Republic agreed that any dispute\r\nrelating to this contract should be referred to the Secretary of State\r\nof the United States for final decision. The treasury bills were to be\r\nretired at once if the fifteen-million-dollar bond issue took place.[64]\r\n\r\nThe product of this loan was spent by the bankers for the benefit of\r\nthe Republic. The reorganization of the monetary system was intrusted\r\nto the National Bank of Nicaragua, an institution incorporated in the\r\nUnited States with capital supplied from the loan. This was to be\r\nmanaged by the bankers until such time as the treasury bills should\r\nbe paid. On March 20, 1912, a new currency law was passed by the\r\nNicaraguan Congress, putting into effect a plan which had been worked\r\nout by two distinguished American financial experts, who had been sent\r\nby the bankers to report on the situation.[65] A unit called _Córdoba_,\r\nequal in value to one dollar United States currency, was instituted,\r\nand the National Bank was authorized to issue paper and silver money\r\nof the new denominations in such quantities as it might consider\r\nexpedient. This was to be exchanged for the old _billetes_ at a rate\r\nto be fixed by agreement between the President of Nicaragua and the\r\nbankers. The bank-notes which were to form the greater part of the new\r\ncirculating medium were to be kept at par by the sale of drafts against\r\na reserve fund maintained in New York by the Republic with its own\r\nmoney, but managed by the National Bank. The latter was to have full\r\ncontrol of the currency reform as the agent of the Republic, and was to\r\nhave an exclusive right to issue paper money.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it had been found that additional funds would be necessary\r\nif the currency reform were to be carried out, because the secret\r\nissues of paper money made during the autumn of 1911, even after the\r\nsignature of the treasury bills agreement, had greatly increased the\r\nprobable expense of the reform. The bankers therefore agreed to open a\r\ncredit of $500,000 to provide the reserve fund contemplated in the plan\r\nof reorganization, and agreed also to lend the Republic an additional\r\n$255,000 in small monthly amounts for current expenses. Both of these\r\nadvances were to bear interest at the rate of six per cent, and were\r\nto be repaid when Nicaragua received the money which was due to it, as\r\nwill be explained below, from the Ethelburga Syndicate. Payment was due\r\non October 15, 1912, but the bankers agreed to grant an extension of\r\ntime both for these loans and for the treasury bills, if the Republic\r\nwere then unable to pay them. In return, the Republic agreed to cut\r\ndown its budget and to raise the customs duties by collecting them at\r\na new rate of exchange. At the same time, it granted the bankers an\r\noption on fifty-one per cent of the stock in the National Railway, the\r\nmanagement of which was to be turned over to a corporation formed in\r\nthe United States. This company was to be entirely controlled by the\r\nbankers until they had received all money due them from the Republic.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plan for the currency reform was completed the\r\ngovernment began to purchase and destroy the old paper money, in order\r\nto reduce the rate of exchange, for the expert commission had decided\r\nthat a conversion at the prevailing rate of twenty to one would work\r\na serious injustice to some classes in the community in view of the\r\nrapidity with which the rate had risen during the past twelve months.\r\nThis proceeding, although justifiable from a broad social point of\r\nview, involved a heavy expense to the government, and at the same\r\ntime proved extremely profitable to those who had shared in the\r\ndistributions of paper money which had taken place since the victory\r\nof the revolution. The National Bank was established in the summer\r\nof 1912, and early in 1913 the new money was in circulation. The old\r\n_billetes_ were gradually retired, being exchanged at a fixed rate of\r\n12¹⁄₂ to one. In November, 1915, they ceased to be legal tender.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Customs Collectorship had been installed in December,\r\n1911, under the direction of Colonel Clifford D. Ham. This gentleman\r\nhas administered the service ever since, in accordance with the terms\r\nof the treasury bills contract and of the later agreement with the\r\nholders of the Republic’s foreign debt. The Collector General, in\r\nhis own words, has regarded himself not so much as an employee of\r\nthe Nicaraguan Government as a “trustee, with obligations to four\r\nparties--the Republic of Nicaragua, the Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States, certain citizens of the United States, and certain\r\ncitizens of England.”[66] In accordance with this view, he has\r\ndeclined to recognize the right of the Tribunal of Accounts and other\r\ngovernmental agencies to exercise any authority over him, and he has\r\nbeen in the main supported in this position by the higher Nicaraguan\r\nofficials. By the terms of its arrangements with the bankers, the\r\nRepublic is debarred from reducing its tariff without the latters’\r\nconsent, or from taking any other action which might lessen the value\r\nof the guarantee afforded by the customs revenues. The collectorship,\r\nand the readjustment of the foreign debt which its establishment made\r\npossible, may perhaps be said to be the one conspicuously successful\r\nfeature of the American bankers’ operations in Nicaragua. The Collector\r\nGeneral, who has entire power to appoint and remove his subordinates,\r\nhas reorganized and reformed the service, and has succeeded in\r\neliminating most of the corruption and inefficiency which had prevailed\r\nunder native administration. Foreign importers and customs agencies\r\nwho had enjoyed special privileges or improper exemptions have in\r\nsome cases opposed the new regime very bitterly, but the majority of\r\nthe business men of the country have had good reason to welcome the\r\nsubstitution of a fair system for one which exposed them to continual\r\nextortion and fraud. The amount of revenue secured, in proportion to\r\nthe imports, has been greatly increased, although the paralyzation\r\nof trade during the war of 1912 and the commercial stagnation which\r\nhas prevailed since the beginning of the European war have prevented\r\nthe receipts from reaching an amount much greater than that secured\r\nin the days of Zelaya. Nevertheless, the collections during 1913,\r\nthe only year since the establishment of the new system in which\r\nnormal conditions prevailed, were the largest in the history of the\r\nRepublic.[67]\r\n\r\nNegotiations with the holders of the Republic’s foreign debt were\r\ncompleted in the first months of 1912, when an arrangement highly\r\nbeneficial to both parties was brought about by the American bankers,\r\nacting on behalf of the Nicaraguan Government. Zelaya had refunded the\r\nthen existing foreign debt in 1909, by placing bonds to the amount of\r\n£1,250,000 at seventy-five per cent of their face value, bearing six\r\nper cent interest, with the Ethelburga Syndicate in London. As the\r\nservice of this loan had been suspended after the revolution, and the\r\nBritish Government had already intervened diplomatically on behalf\r\nof the bondholders, the need for a readjustment had been pressing. A\r\ncontract was signed on May 25, 1912, between the American bankers and\r\nthe Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, by which the latter agreed to\r\na reduction of the interest on the loan to five per cent, on condition\r\nthat the interest and amortization charges be made a first lien on\r\nthe customs receipts of the Republic, and that those receipts should\r\ncontinue to be collected under the control of the bankers. This\r\nagreement not only effected a saving in money and an improvement in the\r\ncredit of the Republic, but it also secured for the government the use\r\nof a sum of £371,000, representing part of the proceeds of the sale of\r\nthe 1909 bonds, which had been held in London when the service of the\r\nloan had been suspended. About one-third of this money was used for the\r\npayment of interest already due, but the remainder was available, in\r\naccordance with an agreement made on the same date between the American\r\nbankers and the Republic, for the fortification of the currency reform\r\nand the repayment of a part of the obligations of the government to the\r\nbankers.\r\n\r\nThe Claims Commission provided for by the Dawson agreement began its\r\nsessions on May 1, 1911. It was authorized by legislative decree to\r\nadjudicate without further appeal all unliquidated claims against the\r\ngovernment, including especially those arising from the late war and\r\nfrom the cancellation of concessions and other contracts made by former\r\nadministrations. Of the three commissioners, one was a Nicaraguan\r\ncitizen appointed by the Nicaraguan Government and the other two\r\nwere Americans, one named by the Republic on the recommendation of\r\nthe United States and the other designated by the State Department.\r\nThe commission continued its labors until late in 1914, and passed\r\non 7,908 claims for a total of $13,808,161 gold. Its awards amounted\r\nto $1,840,432.31, about two-thirds of which was for small claims\r\npresented by natives. The American holders of concessions, who demanded\r\n$7,576,564.13, received only $538,749.71. The original intention had\r\nbeen to provide for the payment of these awards with the money received\r\nfrom the proposed fifteen-million-dollar bond issue. It was impossible\r\nafter the failure of the loan treaty for the government to do this,\r\nbut a sum of $158,548 was nevertheless provided from the customs\r\nreceipts for the payment of 4,116 of the smallest claims, which were\r\nmainly for losses of livestock and similar property by poor persons\r\nduring the civil wars of 1909-10 and 1912.[68] Even though the plan\r\nfor the refunding of the internal debt could not be carried out, it\r\nwas a decided advantage both for the government and for the holders of\r\nthe claims to have them passed on by an impartial tribunal, in order\r\nthat the former might know definitely how much it owed, and that the\r\nlatter might secure the recognition of their claims as acknowledged\r\nobligations of the treasury.\r\n\r\nThese measures had been carried out by the State Department, and by\r\nthe bankers at the request and with the co-operation of the State\r\nDepartment, in anticipation of the ratification of the loan treaty by\r\nthe United States Senate. Their effect was practically to put into\r\noperation the most important features of that agreement,--the customs\r\ncollectorship, the adjustment of the external debt, and the reform\r\nof the currency,--despite the opposition to the State Department’s\r\npolicy which defeated the treaty in the Senate. The rejection of the\r\ntreaty, however, made it impossible to secure money for the complete\r\nexecution of the reforms which had been inaugurated by the Treasury\r\nBills Agreement, for the bankers were naturally unwilling to make the\r\nlarge loan which had been planned for without an adequate guarantee\r\nof the protection of their government. Their situation and that of\r\nthe Republic was thus made very difficult. The foreign debt remained\r\nin English and French hands; the creditors of the government at home\r\nremained unpaid; the projected railroads could not be built; and the\r\ngeneral improvement in the condition of business and agriculture, which\r\nhad been expected to result from the solution of the government’s\r\nfinancial difficulties and the payment of its obligations to planters,\r\nmerchants, and officials, did not take place. The poor credit of the\r\nRepublic made it impossible for it to secure additional loans from the\r\nbankers except on onerous terms, while its pressing necessities forced\r\nit to embark on a hand-to-mouth policy of mortgaging or selling all of\r\nits available resources in order to secure funds. The bankers, on the\r\nother hand, had been drawn into a business which promised little profit\r\nor credit to themselves, but from which they could not well withdraw.\r\nInstead of underwriting a large bond issue, and aiding in an ambitious\r\nproject for the economic regeneration of Nicaragua, as they had\r\nexpected to when they first entered into the contracts of September,\r\n1911, they have become involved deeper and deeper in the financial\r\nsupport of a virtually bankrupt government.\r\n\r\nWhile these financial operations were being carried out, the political\r\nsituation had become more threatening than ever. General Mena had\r\ncaused the Assembly to elect him President of the Republic, in\r\nOctober, 1911, for the term beginning January 1, 1913, notwithstanding\r\nthe protests of the United States Minister and of the Granada\r\nConservatives, who asserted that this action was a violation of the\r\nDawson agreement. The strength of the opposition to this proceeding\r\nencouraged President Díaz to attempt to throw off the control of the\r\nminister of war. On July 29, 1912, he summarily removed the latter from\r\noffice, and appointed Emiliano Chamorro general-in-chief of the army.\r\nMena fled to Masaya, with a large part of the troops and of the city\r\npolice of the capital. Most of the national stores of artillery and\r\nammunition had been gathered in Masaya and in Granada, where Mena’s son\r\nwas in command of the barracks. The revolutionists were reinforced by\r\na large number of Liberals, for Benjamín Zeledón, formerly minister of\r\nwar under Zelaya, assumed the leadership of one of their armies, and\r\nthe people of Leon revolted and seized control of that city and of the\r\nneighboring provinces. Mena’s distrust of his old enemies, however, and\r\nhis refusal to send arms and ammunition to the Leon leaders, prevented\r\neffective co-operation between the two factions, and probably saved the\r\ngovernment from defeat.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the government could not expect to hold out long, with\r\nlittle ammunition and few troops, while the rebels controlled\r\npractically all the approaches to the capital. The United States,\r\nhowever, could hardly permit the overthrow of the Conservative\r\nauthorities. Mena, who had fallen seriously ill, had been forced to\r\nlet the leadership of the revolution pass almost completely into the\r\nhands of Zeledón and the Leon chiefs. If Zelaya’s followers regained\r\ncontrol of the government, all of the efforts of the State Department\r\nto place Nicaragua on her feet politically and financially would have\r\nbeen useless, and the interests of the New York bankers, who had\r\nundertaken their operations in the country at the express request\r\nof the United States Government, would be seriously imperiled. The\r\nAmerican Minister, therefore, demanded that President Díaz guarantee\r\neffective protection to the life and property of foreigners in the\r\nRepublic. The latter replied that he was unable to do so, but asked\r\nthe United States to assume this responsibility itself. In compliance\r\nwith this request, American marines landed at Corinto, and assumed\r\ncontrol of the National Railway, which ran from that port through\r\nLeon, Managua, and Masaya to Granada. This, as we have seen, was the\r\nproperty of the government, but was held and operated by the bankers as\r\na partial guarantee of their loans. By September 8, traffic had been\r\nresumed between Corinto and Granada, although the rebels still held\r\nall of the more important cities along the route with the exception\r\nof Managua. On September 18, the United States Minister, Mr. Weitzel,\r\nmade public an official declaration that the United States intended to\r\nkeep open the routes of communication in the Republic and to protect\r\nAmerican life and property. His government, he said, had been opposed\r\nto Zelaya not only as a person but as a system, and it would exert\r\nits influence, at the request of President Díaz, to prevent a return\r\nto that system and to uphold the lawful authority. This pronouncement\r\ndisheartened the revolutionists and caused many to withdraw from the\r\nuprising. On September 25, General Mena surrendered at Granada to\r\nAdmiral Sutherland, the commander of the American forces, and the\r\nrebels were confined to their positions at Masaya and Leon. A few days\r\nlater, Admiral Sutherland ordered Zeledón to evacuate the Barranca\r\nFort, overlooking Masaya, on the ground that his position threatened\r\nthe railway. When the Liberal leader refused, American troops stormed\r\nand took the position. The war soon afterwards came to an end with the\r\nsurrender of Leon to another American officer. Seven American marines\r\nand bluejackets had lost their lives.[69]\r\n\r\nAfter the revolution, it was necessary to decide upon the election of a\r\npresident for the term 1913-1917. The greater part of the Conservative\r\nparty supported the candidacy of General Chamorro, but Díaz, who\r\ncontrolled the machinery of the administration, desired to succeed\r\nhimself in power. An agreement was effected through the intervention of\r\nMr. Weitzel, who insisted that the _Chamorristas_ accept Díaz, while\r\nChamorro was given the position of minister at Washington. At the\r\nelection, which was held while a large part of the American marines\r\nwere still in the country, the three or four thousand voters who were\r\nallowed to participate unanimously approved the official ticket, which\r\nwas the only one in the field.\r\n\r\nSince 1912, the Government of Nicaragua has practically been maintained\r\nin office by the support of the United States, for a legation guard\r\nof one hundred marines is kept in one of the forts at Managua and a\r\nwarship is stationed at Corinto as reminders that the United States\r\nwill not permit another uprising against the constituted authorities.\r\nOne hundred well-trained and well-equipped soldiers are in themselves\r\nno inconsiderable force in a country like Nicaragua, and their\r\ninfluence is increased by the recollection of the events of 1912.\r\nWithout their moral backing, the administration could hardly have\r\nremained in power. Although President Díaz dealt with his opponents\r\nmore justly and humanely than has been customary in Nicaragua, and\r\nshowed great liberality in his attitude towards the expression of\r\npolitical opinion in the press and in private conversation, his\r\nadministration did not have the whole-hearted adherence of any of the\r\nlarger political groups, and was for this reason decidedly unpopular.\r\nNot only the Liberals and the friends of General Mena, but even most\r\nof the Conservatives, were dissatisfied. General Chamorro himself\r\nco-operated loyally with the president, but he was unable to prevent\r\nmany of his followers from conspiring to place their own faction in\r\npower. There were, therefore, continual intrigues and frequent petty\r\nrevolts, which lessened the government’s prestige and exhausted its\r\nenergy and resources. The outbreak of another civil war was prevented,\r\napparently, only by the determined attitude of the United States.\r\n\r\nTwo of the causes which contributed most to the weakness of the Díaz\r\ngovernment were its inability to meet its current expenses and the\r\nincreasing unpopularity of its relations with the New York bankers.\r\nAt the time of Mena’s revolt, the difficulties confronting the\r\ntreasury had seemed in a fair way to solution, but the expense and\r\nthe loss of revenue due to the war made matters worse than ever. The\r\ngovernment was forced to ask further advances from the bankers, and\r\nto turn over to them, as security, and in the hope of improving its\r\nfinancial situation thereby, the collection of all of its internal\r\nrevenues.[70] These were administered by the National Bank for a year,\r\nafter which the arrangement was abandoned as unsatisfactory, because\r\nof the difficulties encountered by the American administrators in\r\nobtaining the enforcement of the fiscal laws and the prevention of the\r\nclandestine manufacture of _aguardiente_. It was reported in October,\r\n1916, however, that the internal revenues had again been taken over by\r\nthe bankers.\r\n\r\nAs there was no improvement in the financial condition of the Republic,\r\ncontracts providing for further assistance by the bankers were signed\r\non October 8, 1913. The latter agreed to purchase another issue of\r\ntreasury bills to the amount of one million dollars, bearing interest\r\nat six per cent, and at the same time bought fifty-one per cent of the\r\nstock of the National Railway for one million dollars, thus becoming\r\nthe owners of property which they had in fact held and operated for\r\nmore than a year. The Republic agreed to employ a part of the two\r\nmillion dollars thus received in the payment of all its outstanding\r\nobligations to the bankers and to the National Bank, including the sums\r\nstill due on the 1911 treasury bills and the supplementary loans, and\r\nin the addition of $350,000 to the currency reserve. At the same time\r\nit was to subscribe $47,000, while the bankers subscribed $153,000,\r\nfor an increase in the capital of the National Bank, which was to be\r\nraised from $100,000 to $300,000. The remainder of the money, amounting\r\napproximately to three quarters of a million dollars, went to the\r\nRepublic for its current expenses. Since the bankers acquired fifty-one\r\nper cent of the stock of the National Bank as well as of the Railway\r\nby these contracts, it was arranged that they should name six, the\r\nNicaraguan Minister of Finance two, and the United States Secretary of\r\nState one, of the directors of both corporations.\r\n\r\nBefore these new treasury bills fell due, the outbreak of the European\r\nwar put an end to all hope for the immediate financial rehabilitation\r\nof the Republic. The economic situation of the country at large was\r\nalready very bad before this final disaster occurred. The exhaustion\r\nand demoralization which had resulted from two unusually destructive\r\ncivil wars, combined with the reduction of military forces in the\r\nrural districts from motives of economy, had led to a great increase\r\nin highway robbery and crime, which caused general unrest and\r\ndiscouraged internal commerce. Matters were made worse by the continual\r\npolitical agitation. The crops, moreover, had been severely damaged by\r\ndroughts and by a plague of grasshoppers, and in many districts the\r\nagricultural population had been reduced to a pitiable state of want.\r\nThe merchants in the cities had suffered great losses from the failure\r\nof the Government to pay for large amounts of supplies purchased or\r\nrequisitioned by it, and from the inability of the treasury to meet the\r\nsalaries of the public employees, who made up a large part of the city\r\npopulation. When the outbreak of the war cut off the European credits\r\nupon which both the coffee growers and the merchants had depended,\r\nforeign and domestic commerce came almost to a standstill. The income\r\nof the national treasury was greatly reduced, for the receipts from the\r\ncustoms duties declined from $1,730,603.22 in 1913 to $1,237,593.33 in\r\n1914 and $789,716.76 in 1915, and the other revenues decreased at the\r\nsame time to an alarming extent. It was manifestly impossible for the\r\ngovernment to meet even the most necessary of its current expenses,\r\nif it had to discharge its obligations to foreign creditors at the\r\nsame time, and it would have faced absolute bankruptcy had not the\r\nbankers again come to its assistance. The payment of interest on the\r\ntreasury bills was suspended, by contracts made in October, 1914, and\r\nthe bankers used their good offices to secure a similar suspension of\r\ncharges on the English debt, in order that the Republic might use all\r\nof the reduced customs revenue for its own needs. These arrangements\r\nhave since been renewed from time to time for short periods, always\r\non condition that the Republic should so far as possible resume the\r\nservice of the loans if it should receive the three million dollars due\r\nto it in accordance with the canal treaty with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe conditions created by the war put a severe strain upon the new\r\ncurrency system. The replenishment of the reserve fund became well-nigh\r\nimpossible just at the time when the disorganization of international\r\ncredit, which forced exchange upon European centers to an unprecedented\r\nfigure throughout the Western Hemisphere, caused an abnormal drain upon\r\nit. The National Bank, therefore, was forced to suspend the sale of the\r\ndrafts by which the par value of its notes had been maintained. At the\r\nsame time there was a strong popular demand for new issues of money\r\nto supply funds for the government and to finance the coffee growers,\r\nwho were unable to secure the usual advances from abroad for moving\r\ntheir crop. As a result of this, a contract was signed on December\r\n2, 1914, by which a new issue of 1,500,000 Córdobas was provided\r\nfor,--C1,000,000 to be used for making loans to agriculturalists and\r\nexporters, and C500,000, which was to be guaranteed by the proceeds of\r\na new capital tax collected by the National Bank, for the payment of\r\nsalaries and other obligations of the government. At the same time,\r\nthe Bank was authorized to pay its depositors with additional notes,\r\nsecured by mortgages and other securities. All of these issues were to\r\nbe retired as rapidly as the loans were repaid and the profits of the\r\ncapital tax were received. The interest upon the loans to planters and\r\nmerchants, which was to be at the rate of twelve per cent, was divided\r\nbetween the government and the Bank,--an arrangement highly profitable\r\nto the latter, considering that the notes were exclusively obligations\r\nof the Republic. So long as these issues were still in circulation,\r\nthe Bank was not to sell drafts against the reserve fund, and the\r\ngovernment was to be relieved of its obligation to maintain that fund\r\nat the amount required by previous contracts. The new issues of paper\r\nand the suspension of the sale of exchange constituted of course a\r\ntemporary abandonment of the gold standard. The premium on New York\r\ndrafts rose to thirty per cent during the first months of 1915, but in\r\nMay of that year it was greatly reduced by the operations of an English\r\nbank in Managua. Some months later, the National Bank itself resumed\r\nthe sale of drafts with its own funds, thus raising its notes again to\r\ntheir par value.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1916, all parties in the Republic turned their attention\r\nto the coming presidential election. In the campaign which preceded\r\nthis, the various political groups enjoyed a very unusual amount of\r\nfreedom in carrying on their propaganda, and each one founded clubs\r\nand published numerous newspapers to support its candidate. The\r\nchief factions which took part in the campaign were: the government\r\nparty, which had few friends outside of official circles; the old\r\nConservatives, with their chief strength in Granada, who were in the\r\nmain enthusiastic followers of Emiliano Chamorro; and the Liberals,\r\nwho, though by no means entirely at harmony among themselves, were\r\nnevertheless united in their determination to regain control of the\r\ngovernment. There were also one or two lesser groups, which had hopes\r\nof coming into power as the result of a compromise between the more\r\nextreme parties. The Liberals, with the support of the great city of\r\nLeon, and with a strong following in each of the other important cities\r\nexcept Granada, were probably more numerous than all of their opponents\r\ntogether. It was clear from the beginning, however, that the outcome\r\nof the election would depend not so much upon the will of the majority\r\nas upon the attitude assumed by the United States. The administration,\r\nwhich had made Dr. Carlos Cuadra Pasos the official candidate,\r\nobviously intended to perpetuate its own regime, relying on the support\r\nof the American marines to prevent armed opposition to its plans. The\r\nChamorristas, on their side, believed that the United States would\r\ninsist that the Government accept their candidate, who had won general\r\nrespect during his service as minister at Washington. The security of\r\nAmerican interests in Nicaragua was in very large measure dependent\r\nupon the continuance in power of the Conservative party, of which\r\nChamorro was undoubtedly the most popular leader; and the latter had\r\nstrong additional claims to consideration because of his loyal support\r\nof the constituted authorities, after the disappointment which he had\r\nsuffered in 1913, and despite the discontent of his own followers with\r\nthe Díaz administration.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals, on the other hand, believed that any fair solution of the\r\nsituation would restore them to power. They unquestionably constituted\r\na majority of the people of the Republic, and they were on the whole\r\nmore united than their Conservative opponents. For several years they\r\nhad been endeavoring to secure the withdrawal of the marines from\r\nNicaragua, believing that they would easily obtain control of the\r\ngovernment as soon as the existing administration should be deprived of\r\nforeign support; and they had been carrying on an extensive campaign\r\nin Central America and in political circles in Washington with a view\r\nto arousing sentiment against the intervention of the United States\r\nin the internal affairs of Nicaragua. Their leaders desired first of\r\nall to secure the withdrawal of the American marines, but many were\r\nwilling, if this proved unobtainable, to accept American supervision\r\nof the presidential election, which would have reduced somewhat the\r\npossibility of the exercise of pressure and the employment of fraud\r\nby the government. Whatever chance the Liberals might once have had\r\nto secure the recognition of their right to participate on equal\r\nterms in the election, however, was forfeited when they nominated as\r\ntheir candidate for president Dr. Julián Irías, Zelaya’s most trusted\r\nminister, who had been closely associated with the dictator in all of\r\nthe acts which had aroused the hostility of the United States between\r\n1906 and 1909. Although Irías was one of the ablest and most popular\r\nleaders of the Liberal party, it was hardly possible that a man whose\r\nelection would mean a restoration of the old regime should become\r\npresident of Nicaragua with the consent and assistance of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe United States could not well escape the responsibility for deciding\r\nwhich of the three candidates should become president for the ensuing\r\nterm. A policy of non-intervention except to prevent disorder would\r\nhave meant the election of Dr. Cuadra, against the wishes of the great\r\nmajority of both parties. A supervised election, on the other hand,\r\nsupposing that it could have been conducted with any fairness, which\r\nseemed unlikely, would probably have placed in office a president\r\nwhose avowed object was to expel the American bankers from the\r\nRepublic and to terminate American influence in the government. It was\r\nalmost inevitable under such circumstances that the Conservative party\r\nshould receive the open support of the American minister. By the time\r\nof the election, it was evident that General Chamorro was to be the\r\nnext president. Dr. Irías had been prevented from entering Nicaragua\r\nwhen he came home to conduct his campaign in August, and the Liberals\r\nhad been warned that no candidate who had been associated with the\r\nZelaya regime would be recognized by the United States if elected.\r\nSomewhat later Dr. Cuadra withdrew his candidacy. The election was held\r\nin October, and the new president, General Chamorro, was inaugurated in\r\nJanuary, 1917.\r\n\r\nAfter the attempt to secure the ratification of the loan treaty had\r\nbeen finally abandoned, the hopes of the Nicaraguan Government for the\r\neventual solution of its financial problems were centered upon a new\r\nagreement signed in February, 1913, which provided for the payment by\r\nthe United States to Nicaragua of three million dollars in return for\r\nan exclusive right to construct a transisthmian canal through the San\r\nJuan River and the Great Lake and for the privilege of establishing a\r\nnaval base in her territory on the Gulf of Fonseca. After Mr. Bryan\r\nassumed office as Secretary of State, this treaty was modified by the\r\naddition of an article by which Nicaragua agreed not to declare war\r\nwithout the consent of the United States, or to enter into treaties\r\nwith foreign governments affecting her independence or territorial\r\nintegrity, or to contract public debts beyond her ability to pay, and\r\nby which she recognized the right of the United States to intervene\r\nin her affairs when necessary to preserve her independence or to\r\nprotect life and property in her domain. This so-called protectorate\r\nplan failed of ratification in the United States Senate, and a new\r\ntreaty, without it, was signed on August 5, 1914. Despite the strong\r\nopposition which this also encountered in the Senate, it was finally\r\nratified with some amendments, and was proclaimed on June 24, 1916. The\r\nprincipal provisions of the treaty as ratified were as follows:\r\n\r\nI. “The Government of Nicaragua grants in perpetuity to the Government\r\nof the United States, forever free from all taxation or other public\r\ncharge, the exclusive proprietary rights necessary and convenient for\r\nthe construction, operation, and maintenance of an interoceanic canal\r\nby way of the San Juan River and the Great Lake of Nicaragua, or by way\r\nof any route over Nicaraguan territory....\r\n\r\nII. “... The Government of Nicaragua hereby leases for a term of\r\nninety-nine years to the Government of the United States the islands in\r\nthe Caribbean Sea known as Great Corn Island and Little Corn Island;\r\nand the Government of Nicaragua further grants to the Government of\r\nthe United States for a like period of ninety-nine years the right\r\nto establish, operate and maintain a naval base at such place on the\r\nterritory of Nicaragua bordering upon the Gulf of Fonseca as the\r\nGovernment of the United States may select....\r\n\r\nIII. “In consideration of the foregoing stipulations and for the\r\npurposes contemplated by this Convention and for the purpose of\r\nreducing the present indebtedness of Nicaragua, the Government of\r\nthe United States shall ... pay for the benefit of the Republic of\r\nNicaragua the sum of three million dollars ... to be applied by\r\nNicaragua upon its indebtedness or other public purposes for the\r\nadvancement of the welfare of Nicaragua in a manner to be determined by\r\nthe two high contracting parties....”\r\n\r\nEven before this treaty had been made public, unofficial reports\r\nrevealing its provisions had led Costa Rica and Salvador to protest\r\nvigorously to the United States and to Nicaragua against what each\r\nconsidered to be a grave infringement of its own rights. Their\r\nopposition had led the United States Senate to add to the treaty a\r\nproviso declaring that nothing in the Convention was intended to affect\r\nany existing right of Costa Rica, Salvador, or Honduras. This, however,\r\ndid little to conciliate those states, and the efforts of the State\r\nDepartment to secure their approval of the new condition of affairs\r\ncreated by the treaty by an offer to make similar agreements with\r\nthem, to safeguard their rights and to indemnify them with pecuniary\r\ncompensations, proved unavailing. After the treaty had been proclaimed,\r\nCosta Rica and Salvador took their protests to the Central American\r\nCourt of Justice, requesting that tribunal to enjoin Nicaragua from\r\ncarrying out its provisions. The Court decided to take cognizance of\r\nthe matter, despite Nicaragua’s refusal to be a party to any action\r\nbefore it.[71]\r\n\r\nCosta Rica’s case was a simple one, based upon treaty provisions. By\r\nthe boundary treaty between her and Nicaragua, signed in 1858, she had\r\nbeen given perpetual rights of free navigation in the lower part of the\r\nSan Juan River, and the Nicaraguan Government had agreed to consult\r\nher before it entered into any contract for the construction of an\r\ninteroceanic canal. There had been some dispute about the terms of this\r\ntreaty, which had led in 1888 to the submission of the questions at\r\nissue to the arbitration of President Cleveland. The latter had held\r\nthe treaty valid, and had expressly declared in his award that: “The\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua remains bound not to make any grants for canal\r\npurposes across her territory without first asking the opinion of the\r\nRepublic of Costa Rica.” Costa Rica asserted that the construction\r\nof the proposed canal would interfere with her navigation of the San\r\nJuan River, thus infringing her rights under the convention of 1858\r\nand also under those provisions of the Washington Conventions of 1907\r\nwhich granted to each Central American Republic the free navigation\r\nof the waters of the others; that it would injuriously affect her own\r\nterritory on the banks of the San Juan; and finally that the Canal\r\nTreaty had been signed and ratified before she had even been informed\r\nof its provisions, and without her assent being asked at any stage of\r\nthe proceedings. Nicaragua refused to answer the complaint of Costa\r\nRica, and declared that she would neither recognize the competence\r\nof the Court to assume jurisdiction in the matter nor abide by its\r\ndecision when rendered. She denied that the treaty was either a\r\nconcession for the construction of a canal, or an agreement for the\r\nsale of the San Juan River, saying that it was only an option granting\r\nto the United States the privilege of building a canal, under an\r\nadditional contract, at some future time.\r\n\r\nSalvador’s case was based upon broader political grounds, and her\r\nprotests were directed chiefly against the establishment of the naval\r\nbase in the Gulf of Fonseca, in close proximity to one of her most\r\nimportant ports. “It must be patent to every one,” her complaint\r\nstated, “that the establishment, by a powerful state, of a naval\r\nbase in the immediate vicinity of the Republic of El Salvador would\r\nconstitute a serious menace--not merely imaginary, but real and\r\napparent--to the freedom of life and the autonomy of that Republic. And\r\nthat positive menace would exist, not solely by reason of the influence\r\nthat the United States, as an essential to the adequate development\r\nof the ends determined upon for the efficiency and security of the\r\nproposed naval base, would naturally need to exercise and enjoy at all\r\ntimes in connection with incidents of the highest importance in the\r\nnational life of the small neighboring states, but would be also, and\r\nespecially, vital because in the future, in any armed conflict that\r\nmight arise between the United States and one or more military powers,\r\nthe territories bounded by the Gulf of Fonseca would be converted,\r\nto an extent incalculable in view of the offensive power and range\r\nof modern armaments, into belligerent camps wherein would be decided\r\nthe fate of the proposed naval establishment--a decision that would\r\ninevitably involve the sacrifice of the independence and sovereignty\r\nof the weaker Central American States, as has been the case with the\r\nsmaller nations in the present European struggle under conditions more\r\nor less similar.”\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Salvador asserted that the treaty violated her proprietary\r\nrights in the Gulf of Fonseca. As successors of the Central American\r\nFederation, she said, Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua exercised a\r\njoint ownership over the Gulf, which clearly gave her the right to\r\nobject to the use of its waters for military purposes by a foreign\r\npower. Her contention was somewhat weakened by the fact that the\r\nthree republics in question had divided all of the islands of the\r\nGulf between them, and that each in practice exercised jurisdiction\r\nover a portion of it; but it was nevertheless impossible to show that\r\nany treaty to which Salvador had been a party had ever put an end to\r\nthe community which the three adjacent republics had inherited from\r\nSpain and the Central American Federation. Salvador also asserted\r\nthat the treaty was prejudicial to the general interests of Central\r\nAmerica, which despite temporary political separation was nevertheless\r\na definite political entity of which each of the states was still a\r\npart. The alienation of Central American territory by one country was\r\na violation of the rights of the others. Such alienation was at the\r\nsame time, by a rather far-fetched interpretation, claimed to be a\r\nviolation of the article in the Washington Peace Treaty of 1907 which\r\ndeclared any alteration in the constitutional order of one of the\r\nstates a menace to the welfare of all. Finally, it was maintained that\r\nthe treaty could not legally have been concluded under the Nicaraguan\r\nconstitution, and was therefore void.\r\n\r\nThe Court handed down its decision in the case of Costa Rica on\r\nSeptember 30, 1916. It declared that Nicaragua had violated Costa\r\nRica’s rights by making the treaty, but it declined to declare the\r\ntreaty void, as it had no jurisdiction over the United States. On March\r\n2, 1917, it handed down a similar decision in the case of Salvador.\r\nIts action has been disregarded by Nicaragua, and by the United\r\nStates. The decision has undoubtedly created an extremely embarrassing\r\nsituation. There can be no doubt that the Court had jurisdiction over\r\nthe question at issue, under the terms of the Washington conventions,\r\nor that the other Central American countries, and particularly Costa\r\nRica, had strong cases against the convention, based not only upon\r\ninternational law and treaty provisions, but also upon the necessity\r\nfor protecting their vital national interests. If the treaty is still\r\nput into effect, after what has happened, both the Court of Justice and\r\nthe Washington Conventions will have ceased to be of practical value,\r\nand our government will be committed to a policy which involves the\r\nentire disregard of what the Central American republics consider to be\r\ntheir rights. It may well be doubted whether even the great military\r\nvalue of the proposed naval base, or the theoretical value of an option\r\non another canal route, are worth the permanent alienation of Central\r\nAmerican public opinion and the abandonment of the considerations of\r\njustice and good will which have hitherto governed our relations with\r\nthe five republics.\r\n\r\nThe policy pursued by the United States Government in Nicaragua\r\nsince 1912 has caused bitter resentment throughout Central America.\r\nThe Nicaraguan Liberals and most thinking people in other parts of\r\nthe Isthmus feel that the intervention of American marines in the\r\nrevolution of 1912 and the subsequent maintenance of the administration\r\nby armed force have reduced Nicaragua to the position of a subject\r\ncountry and have gravely jeopardized the independence of the other\r\nrepublics. The Díaz government has been regarded as a mere creature of\r\nthe State Department, and it is denied that the agreements made by it\r\nare in any sense acts of the Nicaraguan nation. Both the contracts with\r\nthe American bankers and the canal convention are regarded as evidences\r\nof an intention in the State Department to exploit the present\r\nsituation for the benefit of American capitalists and for the promotion\r\nof an aggressive policy of political expansion. It is perhaps rather\r\ndifficult for Americans, who realize how far any purpose of territorial\r\nexpansion is from the minds of those who control our foreign policy,\r\nto comprehend the feeling of suspicion and fear which recent events\r\nhave aroused among the more intelligent and patriotic classes in\r\nCentral America. That feeling is nevertheless in large measure\r\njustified. No country can be said to enjoy independence when it is\r\nconstantly in danger, as the events of the last five years have shown\r\nall the Central American republics to be, of arbitrary and sometimes\r\nundiscriminating intervention by an outside power in their political\r\nand financial affairs. Although the United States has been actuated\r\nin the policy which it has pursued solely by a desire to promote the\r\npeace and prosperity of the Central American countries, neither the\r\nnecessity for the action which it has taken nor the purity of its\r\nmotives has been fully appreciated in the Isthmus. The result has been\r\na misunderstanding and a sentiment of hostility which threaten, unless\r\nsteps can be taken to regain their confidence, to make the people of\r\nthe five republics regard their North American neighbor as their most\r\ndangerous enemy.\r\n\r\nIt will be difficult to convince the Central Americans of the sincerity\r\nof our good will or the disinterestedness of our intentions so long\r\nas we continue to uphold a minority administration in Nicaragua by\r\nforce of arms. The maintenance of the established authority has thus\r\nfar been unavoidable because the only alternative was the abandonment\r\nof Nicaragua to a renewal of the civil wars which reduced her to so\r\npitiable a condition before 1912. Peace was the first and absolute\r\nnecessity if the country were to be saved from utter ruin. But it is\r\nunthinkable that the United States, in the name of constitutional\r\ngovernment, should permanently identify itself with any one faction\r\nor that it should continue indefinitely to use its power to exclude\r\nfrom all share in the administration the party to which a majority of\r\nthe people of the Republic profess allegiance. Ultimately, an attempt\r\nmust be made, either to hold a fair election or to effect an agreement\r\nbetween the various parties by which a president accepted by all can be\r\nplaced in office.\r\n\r\nAny adjustment of the political situation must necessarily involve\r\nmeasures to protect the interests of the American bankers, who have\r\ninvested about two million dollars in their efforts to preserve\r\nNicaragua from bankruptcy and to improve her economic condition. Brown\r\nBrothers and Company and J. and W. Seligman and Company entered upon\r\ntheir dealings with Nicaragua at the explicit request of the State\r\nDepartment, and it would be impossible to expose them to the partial\r\nor total loss of their investments by withdrawing the support of the\r\ngovernment. The first thought of a Liberal administration would be to\r\nundo so far as it could the situation created by the loan contracts.\r\nActual confiscation of property would of course be impossible, but\r\nboth the bankers and the holders of the English bonds, which are now\r\nsecured by the American collection of the customs duties, might suffer\r\nserious losses at the hands of an unfriendly president. For this\r\nreason, an agreement in regard to the future status of the bankers, or\r\nan adjustment of the debts due to them from the Republic, would be an\r\nessential part of any arrangement which aimed to terminate the American\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nThe motives and methods of the bankers, like those of the State\r\nDepartment, have been severely impugned by the Nicaraguan Liberals and\r\nby the leaders of public opinion in other parts of Central America.\r\nOne constantly hears charges that they are co-operating with a corrupt\r\nand subservient administration to defraud the people, and that they\r\nhave taken advantage of the needs of the government and the greed of\r\nthe officials to secure control of all of the more valuable national\r\nproperty. Those who make these accusations point to the fact that\r\nthe Republic has become heavily indebted to the New York firms, and\r\nthat the National Railway, the National Bank, the customs houses, and\r\nthe collection of the internal revenues have at the same time passed\r\ninto their hands, while the government apparently has nothing to show\r\nin return. The more serious of these charges spring entirely from\r\nignorance or from partisan political motives. The Liberals are ready\r\nto use any means and to make any statement likely to discredit the\r\nConservative administration or to arouse public sentiment in Nicaragua\r\nor in the United States against the policy which has enabled their\r\nrivals to remain in power; and the patriotic fervor of their efforts\r\nto free their country from alien domination receives at least a part\r\nof its force from the fact that they hope thereby to gain control of\r\nthe government for themselves. Few of them, moreover, have taken the\r\ntrouble to investigate the financial operations of the bankers in\r\norder to substantiate the accusations which they make. The writer was\r\nunable, during a stay of six months in Nicaragua, to find one prominent\r\nLiberal who had even read the loan contracts. For this, and for the\r\nstatement frequently put forth that the Government and the bankers\r\nhave carried on their operations in secret and in an underhand manner,\r\nthere is no excuse, for every one of the more important contracts has\r\nbeen published in the reports of the Minister of Finance, which are\r\neasily accessible to the public. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nthere are very few persons in Nicaragua who are fitted by training or\r\nexperience to form an intelligent opinion from the perusal of these\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nThe bankers’ investments in Nicaragua so far have been as follows:\r\n\r\n1913 Treasury Bills                         $1,000,000\r\n51% of the stock in the National Railway     1,000,000\r\n51% of the stock in the National Bank          153,000\r\n                                            ----------\r\n  Total (exclusive of accrued interest)     $2,153,000\r\n\r\nEarlier loans were, as we have seen, repaid or refunded with the 1913\r\ntreasury bills. These bear interest at the rate of six per cent, which\r\nis certainly not excessive if we consider the desperate condition of\r\nthe Republic’s credit. The par value of the bankers’ holdings in the\r\ncapital stock of the railway is $1,683,000. Since the total net profits\r\nof the line were $244,706.62 Cordobas in 1913-14, and $251,320.56 in\r\n1914-15,[72] it is evident that it will be a valuable property under\r\nforeign management and protection, although the return thus far has\r\nnot been great considering the dangers attending investments in such\r\nenterprises in countries where revolutions, with their consequent\r\ndestruction of material and paralyzation of traffic, are of frequent\r\noccurrence. It should be remembered, moreover, that the Government\r\nstill owns forty-nine per cent of the stock and thus receives nearly\r\nhalf of the profits, so that it is a direct beneficiary from the\r\nimprovement in the property and the increase in the profits which\r\nresulted from the reorganization. The Republic shares similarly in\r\nany profits which may be made by the National Bank. This institution,\r\nfounded primarily for the purposes of the currency reform, has\r\napparently not made large profits up to the present time, because of\r\nits small capital, its not very efficient management, and the heavy\r\nexpenses involved in maintaining three separate branches besides\r\nthe central office. It has received small sums for its services in\r\nconnection with the currency reform, and it has in addition loaned\r\nconsiderable amounts to the government and to private individuals,\r\ncharging both twelve per cent interest, which is rather less than the\r\nprevailing rate in Nicaragua. The wisdom, and perhaps the propriety, of\r\nsome of its operations have been open to criticism, but its services\r\nin connection with the currency reform and its extension of credit to\r\nthe government when the latter has been in difficulties have certainly\r\njustified its institution.\r\n\r\nThe charge that the United States Government has been guided in its\r\nfinancial policy in Nicaragua by a deliberate intention to exploit\r\nthe people of that country for the benefit of American capitalists is\r\nof course simply ridiculous. Equally so is the idea that two great\r\nfinancial institutions of the standing of Brown Brothers and Seligman\r\nand Company would compromise their reputation and devote their time\r\nand energy in schemes for defrauding Nicaragua of a few thousands of\r\ndollars a year. The bankers have necessarily sought to protect their\r\nown interests, and in order to do so have imposed rather onerous\r\nconditions upon the Republic; but it must be remembered that they have\r\nbeen dealing with a practically bankrupt country, which is at the\r\npresent time unable to meet any of its foreign obligations, and that\r\ntheir investments are rendered doubly insecure by the bad economic\r\nsituation and by the uncertainty of political conditions. The sums\r\ninvolved and the possibilities of illegitimate profits may well seem\r\nimmense to citizens of a country whose total annual budget is only\r\ntwo or three million dollars; but no one who sees the matter in its\r\ntrue proportions can well believe that the bankers have been enriching\r\nthemselves very rapidly at the expense of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be admitted that the loan contracts have\r\ncontained much that is objectionable from the point of view of the\r\npatriotic Nicaraguan citizen. The situation which they have created\r\ncannot but be humiliating to a people which values its national\r\nindependence. The collection of the public revenues by foreigners, and\r\nthe sale of the most valuable national property, however necessary for\r\nthe good of the country, has naturally been exceedingly distasteful to\r\npublic opinion. Moreover there has been a suspicion, apparently too\r\nwell founded, that some of the money received from the bankers has\r\nbenefited certain high officials rather than the nation as a whole, and\r\nthere is no doubt at all that large profits were made by members of the\r\nparty in power as the result of the currency reform. The men sent from\r\nthe United States to take charge of the various interests acquired by\r\nthe bankers have not always shown tact or ability, and some of them,\r\nfor this reason or from causes lying entirely beyond their control,\r\nhave become very unpopular. The raising of rates by the railway, and\r\nthe refusal to grant free passes to all persons of social or political\r\nprominence, have caused much dissatisfaction; and the National Bank\r\nhas been severely criticised for its failure to make loans to everyone\r\nwho was in need of money. The currency reform was bitterly opposed at\r\nfirst because of the inconvenience which the conversion caused and\r\nthe apparent shortage of money which resulted, and it was generally\r\nregarded as a failure when the bank-notes fell below par at the\r\noutbreak of the European war. It has since become more popular. The\r\nfinancial reforms as a whole, however beneficial in the long run,\r\nhave involved expenses which the nation could ill afford. The expert\r\ncommission which worked out the currency reform, the mixed claims\r\ncommission, the officials of the customs service, and other Americans\r\nwho have been appointed to official or semi-official positions since\r\n1912 have received remunerations which have seemed inordinately\r\nlarge as compared with the incomes of the native officials; and the\r\npublication of their salaries and their expense accounts has given rise\r\nto many charges of extravagance.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to point out how insignificant these grievances are as\r\ncompared with the benefits conferred by the adjustment of and the\r\nreduction of charges on the foreign debt, the immense improvement\r\nin the operation of the railway and in the customs service, and the\r\nestablishment of a currency system on a stable basis in place of\r\nthe depreciated, fluctuating paper of former times. It is also easy\r\nto prove that the vast majority of the people have been inestimably\r\nbetter off through the maintenance of order, which has been entirely\r\ndue to the military and financial support of the government by the\r\nUnited States, than they would have been if the bloody party strife\r\nand the wars with Central American neighbors which marked the last\r\nyears of the Liberal regime had been allowed to continue. But this\r\ndoes not alter the fact that the situation which exists in Nicaragua\r\ntoday is inherently and fundamentally wrong, and that it cannot form a\r\nbasis for a permanent settlement satisfactory either to that country\r\nor to the United States. Our government cannot continue to uphold by\r\nforce a minority administration and to support that administration\r\nin a financial policy which is opposed by the great majority of the\r\nNicaraguan people, if it wishes to eradicate the suspicion in Central\r\nAmerica, and in fact throughout Latin America, that its ultimate\r\nintention is to deprive Nicaragua, and eventually her neighbors, of\r\ntheir position as independent nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] See U.

The mining companies give employment to many natives at\r\nwages somewhat greater than those paid in agricultural enterprises,\r\nbut otherwise they do little to add to the general prosperity of the\r\ncommunity. The owners of the coffee plantations, the majority of whom\r\nare natives, reside in Central America and spend their income there,\r\nand all employ exclusively native labor. Except in Honduras, where it\r\nis cultivated only for local consumption, coffee is the chief export of\r\nthe mountain region on the West Coast where the great majority of the\r\ninhabitants of the Isthmus live.\r\n\r\nCentral American coffee is of an excellent quality, and brings a high\r\nprice in the European markets, to which the greater part of it has\r\nalways been sent. The product of Costa Rica is a favorite in England,\r\nwhile “Coban” and other Guatemalan varieties are well known in Germany\r\nand on the continent. The product of the Isthmus has not been so\r\npopular in the United States, where it has been unable to compete with\r\nthe lower-priced, but inferior, coffee of Brazil or with certain other\r\nsuperior grades which have secured a better foothold in our markets.\r\nTable V indicates the disposition of the crop of each country of the\r\nIsthmus in normal times, and to some extent the change which has been\r\nbrought about in export conditions by the European war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLE I\r\n\r\n                   EXPORTS OF CENTRAL AMERICA, 1913.\r\n\r\n                        (Value in U.

The larger growers, who produce the greater\r\npart of the total crop, ordinarily have their own _beneficios_ on\r\ntheir plantations. Those who have not been able to install the rather\r\nexpensive machinery which these plants require either ship their coffee\r\npartly cleaned, in the shell, or else have it prepared for the market\r\non the plantation of a neighbor or at establishments which exist\r\nfor the purpose in such cities as Guatemala and Managua. The small\r\nlandholders, many of whom have a few trees from which they secure a\r\nmoney income to supplement their food crops, ordinarily sell their\r\ncoffee in the berry to the owners of the _beneficios_. The exportation\r\nis frequently, perhaps usually, undertaken by the planter himself, who\r\nships his crop directly to an importer in some European city or on\r\nconsignment to an agent in Hamburg or London, to be sold in the open\r\nmarket. This seems to be the general though not the universal practice\r\nin Costa Rica, Salvador, and Nicaragua. In Guatemala, on the other\r\nhand, there are several German and North American houses which buy the\r\ncoffee from the grower and export it on their own account. Certain\r\ncompanies in the United States, with agencies in Central America, have\r\ndone a large business of this kind, especially since the beginning of\r\nthe European war.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the coffee plantations of the Isthmus belong to native\r\nCentral Americans. This is true even in Guatemala and Nicaragua,\r\nwhere, as has been said in preceding chapters, nearly all of the\r\nlargest and best equipped _fincas_ are the property of Germans or of\r\nother aliens.[74] In Salvador and Costa Rica there are few foreign\r\nowners. Even in these countries, however, the tendency which has been\r\nso strong in Guatemala, for the more valuable plantations to pass\r\ngradually into the hands of investors from abroad, has been at work in\r\nrecent years. Foreign influence, moreover, is by no means confined to\r\nthe ownership of the plantations themselves, for the native planters\r\nfrequently have financial connections with European banking houses\r\nin the Central American capitals or in Hamburg or London which give\r\nthe latter a large measure of control over the sale of their coffee\r\nand even over their methods of production. A very large proportion of\r\nthe plantations is heavily mortgaged to these concerns, and even the\r\nannual crop is often hypothecated or sold to the banker several months\r\nbefore it is harvested, and is handled by him when ready for market.\r\nThe terms of these arrangements are usually anything but favorable to\r\nthe planter. In Guatemala, for example, the banker ordinarily not only\r\nreceives interest on the sums advanced at the prevailing rate of ten or\r\ntwelve per cent, but at the same time takes an option upon the entire\r\ncrop, under which he can purchase it at twenty-five cents per bag less\r\nthan the market price at the time of the harvest. This option alone is\r\nequivalent to the payment by the planter of about three per cent of\r\nhis entire gross receipts, in addition to the interest. Under these\r\nconditions, especially in view of the improvidence and inefficiency\r\nof many of the native landowners, it is not strange that the most\r\ndesirable plantations are passing one by one into the hands of Germans\r\nand Englishmen, who are able either to finance themselves or to secure\r\nmoney for moving their crops upon better terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE II\r\n\r\n                 THE WORLD’S EXPORTS OF BANANAS, 1911.\r\n\r\n     (From U.

(Commerce\r\n and Navigation of the U. S., 1911.)\r\n\r\nSecond only to coffee in the value of the total amount exported, and\r\nfar more important so far as the United States is concerned, are\r\nbananas. In 1913, nearly twenty-two million bunches, or between two and\r\nthree billions of bananas, were exported from Costa Rica, Honduras,\r\nGuatemala, and Nicaragua. Nearly all of this immense amount, which was\r\nabout forty per cent of the total commercial production of the world,\r\nwent to the United States. Less than fifty years ago, Mr. Minor C.\r\nKeith, who was building a railway from Puerto Limon to the interior of\r\nCosta Rica, began the cultivation of bananas along the line in order to\r\nprovide freight for the road during the years which must elapse before\r\nit could reach the inhabited part of the Republic. Until this time, the\r\nhot and unhealthful forests along the East Coast of Central America had\r\nbeen an uninhabited and undeveloped jungle, but they proved so well\r\nadapted to the growing of bananas that the fruit farms soon became\r\nmore valuable than the railway. Meanwhile other planters had engaged\r\nin the same business in Jamaica and elsewhere in the West Indies,\r\nand the banana, which had hitherto been a curiosity, was coming into\r\ngeneral use in the United States. The more important producers around\r\nthe Caribbean Sea joined in forming the United Fruit Company, which is\r\nnow by far the most important business concern in tropical America.\r\nIts immense plantations in Central America, Jamaica, Cuba, Colombia,\r\nand Panama are traversed by hundreds of miles of railway, and their\r\nproducts are carried to the United States and Europe by a great fleet\r\nof its own steamers, which are the principal, and since the beginning\r\nof the European war almost the only, carriers of freight and passengers\r\nbetween Central American ports and the eastern part of the United\r\nStates. Besides the numerous lines built expressly for carrying bananas\r\nfrom the farms to the wharves, the Fruit Company, or concerns allied to\r\nit, control the entire railway system of Guatemala, a large part of\r\nthat of Salvador, and the most important road, from San José to Puerto\r\nLimon, in Costa Rica. The few independent growers along its lines are\r\ncompletely at its mercy, for they have no alternative but to sell their\r\nfruit to it under the conditions which it dictates. In Honduras and\r\nNicaragua, there are a number of ostensibly competing companies, with\r\ntheir own railway lines and ships, but many of these are said to be\r\nactually under the control of the greater corporation. The latter has\r\non more than one occasion shown itself ruthless and unscrupulous in\r\ndealing with real competitors, over whom it has every advantage through\r\nits control of the facilities for shipping fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, the bananas have been attacked by a disease\r\nwhich apparently shows itself in nearly all plantations after a certain\r\nperiod of cultivation. Its appearance has made it necessary to abandon\r\nlarge tracts of developed land and many miles of railway, especially\r\nin some portions of Costa Rica. No means of checking it has yet been\r\ndiscovered, and it has been found easier to plant new farms than to\r\nfight it where it has obtained a foothold. At present the disease does\r\nnot seem likely to decrease materially the total production, for there\r\nare still immense tracts of virgin land suitable for banana growing\r\naround the shores of the Caribbean Sea, but it is a very grave menace\r\nto the prosperous communities which have grown up on the coast as a\r\nresult of the fruit trade. Unless it is overcome, or unless some other\r\nproduct, such as cacao, can be grown on the abandoned farms, there\r\nseems to be serious danger that many sections of the East Coast will\r\nsink back into jungle.\r\n\r\nAmong Americans who have been on the Coast and have but a slight\r\nacquaintance with the interior, there is a tendency greatly to\r\nexaggerate the influence of the United Fruit Company in Central\r\nAmerica. As a matter of fact, that corporation plays a smaller part\r\nthan might be expected in the economic and political life of the five\r\nrepublics. On the Coast, especially in Costa Rica, it is all-powerful,\r\nfor it absolutely controls the industry and the export and import trade\r\nof the banana country, and is the employer of the greater part of\r\nthe population; but in the interior, where the great majority of the\r\npeople live, its influence is confined to its control of the railway\r\nlines. These are not owned and operated directly by the Fruit Company,\r\nbut by corporations closely connected with it. There are also many\r\nother enterprises, including street railways, mines, and electrical\r\nplants, which have been financed by some of the capitalists who are\r\nprominent in the Fruit Company, so that the total Central American\r\ninvestments of what are known as the “Keith interests” are very great.\r\nThese investors, however, apparently interfere little in politics.\r\nTheir relations with the governments, sometimes cordial, sometimes\r\nthe opposite, are not so close that they can be said to exercise\r\nany important influence on the internal affairs of any of the five\r\nrepublics, and the native officials are apt to be jealous of their\r\npower and to regard with suspicion any concession which seems likely to\r\nincrease their influence.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the immense development of the banana trade, the full\r\npossibilities of this fruit in providing cheap fruit for the people of\r\nthe temperate zones are still far from being realized. Exportation from\r\nCentral America and other producing countries is at present limited\r\nto the amount necessary to meet the demand for the fresh fruit in the\r\nUnited States, because the European market has as yet been little\r\nexploited, and few facilities have been provided for exporting bananas\r\nfrom the Caribbean to transatlantic ports. A considerable proportion of\r\nthe product of Costa Rica was sent to England in the years immediately\r\npreceding the war, but the total was insignificant in comparison\r\nwith the consumption in the United States.[75] Millions of bunches of\r\nfruit now go to waste every year, for the amount cut each week on the\r\nplantations is arbitrarily limited with a view to the state of the\r\nmarket and the facilities for shipping, and thousands of bunches are\r\nrejected at the train or at the steamer as being overripe or otherwise\r\ndefective. It ought to be practicable to convert this waste product\r\ninto dried bananas or banana flour, both of which are now commercially\r\npossible, but few attempts have so far been made to do so. The two\r\nor three factories which have been established in Central American\r\nports for this purpose have had little success, apparently from poor\r\nmanagement or lack of proper equipment.\r\n\r\nThe precious metals, which rank third in the list of exports, are\r\nfound in all parts of Central America, but as yet they have been\r\nexploited on a comparatively small scale. There are a few gold and\r\nsilver mines, operated by foreign capital, in each of the republics\r\nexcept Guatemala, but the total exportations of the Isthmus, according\r\nto customs reports, amounted to less than four and one half millions\r\nof dollars in 1913.[76] The investment of foreign capital in mines has\r\nbeen discouraged by the disorder which has prevailed in some of the\r\nfive republics, and the lack of adequate transportation facilities\r\nhas been an obstacle to the introduction of heavy machinery and to\r\nthe exportation of the product. These difficulties, which have held\r\nback the production of gold and silver, have of course made impossible\r\nthe exploitation of the other mineral resources of the Isthmus,\r\nalthough these are known to be great. With the establishment of\r\ninternal stability and the building of good roads to the metalliferous\r\ndistricts, however, mining should easily become a much more important\r\nindustry than it is at present.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with coffee, bananas, and the precious metals, the other\r\nexports of Central America are of little importance. The herds of\r\ncattle, which are one of the principal forms of wealth in Honduras\r\nand Nicaragua, provide some horns and hides for shipment to foreign\r\ncountries, but the quantity has hitherto been very small. The live\r\nanimals are the chief articles of commerce between Honduras and\r\nNicaragua on the one hand and their more densely populated neighbors\r\non the other, but they have never been exported to any extent to other\r\ncountries. Mahogany, Spanish cedar, and other forest products, such as\r\nrubber and chicle, which is used in making chewing gum, are exported,\r\nchiefly by foreigners, from the low country along the coasts. Sugar\r\nin various forms and cacao are grown in large quantities, but almost\r\nentirely for local consumption. Besides these products, typical of any\r\ntropical country, there are others which have importance in certain\r\nlocalities as articles of foreign commerce. Thus, some millions of\r\ncocoanuts are shipped from the North Coast of Honduras, and indigo and\r\nbalsam of Peru from Salvador. None of these minor exports have received\r\nvery much attention, because the interest of the native community\r\nhas been centered in the production of coffee and of the staple food\r\ncrops, and foreign capital has been invested chiefly in mines, banana\r\nplantations, and railways. With the comparatively good transportation\r\nfacilities that now exist, it would seem that there should be a great\r\nopportunity for the cultivation of such products as cacao, vanilla, and\r\nrubber, or for the shipment to the United States, on the fast banana\r\nsteamers, of some of the countless delicious tropical fruits which have\r\nhitherto been almost unknown in our markets. Countries of such rich\r\nand varied agricultural possibilities, with such easy access to the\r\nGulf ports of the United States, must eventually acquire an importance\r\nfar greater than that which they now have in supplying our markets with\r\nmany kinds of food which we cannot ourselves produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE III\r\n\r\nSHARE OF THE UNITED STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND GERMANY IN THE COMMERCE\r\n                          OF CENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\n                               EXPORTS.\r\n\r\n                   United States  Great Britain  Germany      Total\r\n\r\nGuatemala, 1913      3,923,354      1,857,105   7,653,557   14,449,926\r\n           1915      6,881,410      1,322,271      50,237   11,566,586\r\nSalvador, 1913       2,676,637        668,823   1,611,085    9,411,112\r\n          1915       3,096,277        341,920       9,945    8,812,387\r\nHonduras, 1913       2,974,000         18,000     164,000    3,421,000\r\n          1915       2,987,000          1,000         690    3,858,000\r\nNicaragua, 1913      2,722,385        998,564   1,887,698    7,712,047\r\n           1915      3,079,810        438,500      ......    4,567,201\r\nCosta Rica, 1913     5,204,429      4,319,085     504,506   10,324,149\r\n            1915     4,864,803      4,438,233      13,225    9,971,582\r\nTotal for Central   ----------      ---------  ----------   ----------\r\n  America, 1913     17,500,805      7,861,577  11,820,866   45,318,234\r\n           1915     20,909,300      6,541,924      74,097   38,775,756\r\n\r\n (Compiled from official reports of the Central American governments.\r\n The values are given as in American gold, calculated at the prevailing\r\n rate of exchange for the year in question.)\r\n\r\nEven before the beginning of the European war, the United States\r\nbought the greater part of Central America’s exports. Nearly all of\r\nthe bananas went to American ports, as did by far the greater part of\r\nthe gold and silver from the mines. With the coffee, the situation\r\nwas different, but the partial closing of the European markets forced\r\nthe planters to seek a market for this in the United States. This was\r\nespecially true in Guatemala, where American buyers were almost the\r\nonly ones in the field during 1915 and 1916. In the countries which\r\nhad been less dependent on the German market, the change was not so\r\nmarked, but all of them nevertheless shipped more coffee to the United\r\nStates in those years than ever before. Costa Rica, however, retained\r\nher privileged position in the London market, at least during 1915,\r\nand Salvador found valuable new customers in the Scandinavian countries\r\nand Holland. The necessity for finding new purchasers has naturally\r\ninvolved a considerable loss for the Central American planters. Their\r\ncoffee has on the whole met with a favorable reception in the United\r\nStates, but the prices which they have received have not been so high\r\nas those to which they were accustomed in the markets in which they\r\nhad long established connections, and they have encountered no little\r\ndifficulty in making shipments because of the withdrawal of many of the\r\nsteamers which formerly called at the ports of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE IV\r\n\r\n       IMPORTS OF COFFEE INTO THE UNITED STATES, 1913 and 1915.\r\n\r\n   (From Commerce and Navigation of the United States, 1915, p. 75.)\r\n\r\n                    1913              1915\r\nGuatemala       18,544,228 lbs.    44,605,039 lbs.\r\nSalvador         8,756,267  ”      15,823,350  ”\r\nNicaragua        2,915,239  ”       6,430,600  ”\r\nHonduras           239,114  ”         665,912  ”\r\nCosta Rica       1,474,397  ”       6,770,964  ”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLE V\r\n\r\n           COFFEE EXPORTS OF CENTRAL AMERICA, 1913 and 1915.\r\n\r\n    (Figures in quintals of 100 lbs.

Machinery and\r\ntools for agricultural purposes; textiles; flour, lard, and other food\r\nproducts which are produced in insufficient quantities in the Isthmus;\r\nand in general, manufactured articles of all kinds, must be purchased\r\nabroad. The greater part of these are for the use of the upper classes,\r\nbut even the ordinary laborers, whose standard of living in many places\r\nis otherwise little better than it was in the days when the country had\r\nno foreign commerce, use some foreign goods, such as cheap textiles and\r\nmachetes.\r\n\r\nIn the import as well as the export trade, the United States easily\r\noccupies the leading place, supplying the greater part of the\r\nfoodstuffs, hardware, and machinery, and a very considerable part of\r\nthe textiles. Our share in the total, even before the war, was well\r\nover fifty per cent, with Great Britain and Germany respectively second\r\nand third. Tables VI, VII, and VIII will give an approximate idea of\r\nthe nature and origin of the imports of the Isthmus in normal times.\r\nThe predominance of the United States was due primarily to proximity\r\nand superior steamer connections. The Caribbean ports of the Isthmus,\r\nwhich are less than fifteen hundred miles from our Gulf ports, were\r\nconnected with those ports by regular lines of swift steamers, whereas\r\nthey had no adequate means of communication with Europe. The Pacific\r\nports, on the other hand, although they were visited regularly by the\r\nsmall steamers of the German Cosmos Line, relied chiefly upon the\r\nservice of the Pacific Mail between San Francisco and Panama.\r\n\r\nThis gave American trade an advantage which would have been even\r\ngreater than it was if transatlantic manufacturers had not been favored\r\nby several factors which to some extent offset their geographical\r\nhandicap. Freight rates to Europe, however, were not proportionately\r\ngreater than rates to the United States, even in cases where the goods\r\nmust be transshipped at a North American port. Furthermore, European\r\nmerchants controlled the greater part of the import and wholesale\r\ntrade in each of the five republics, and naturally bought articles\r\nfrom export houses in their own country, whenever they could, not only\r\nfor sentimental reasons, but because they received better terms and\r\nlonger credits. Even at the present time, when the war has caused a\r\ngreat reduction in the exports of all of the belligerent countries,\r\nthe people of the Isthmus still continue to buy certain classes of\r\ngoods from French or English manufacturers which might just as well\r\nbe imported from the United States if American manufacturers made an\r\neffort to secure the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE VI\r\n\r\nSHARE OF THE UNITED STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND GERMANY IN THE COMMERCE\r\n                          OF CENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\n                               IMPORTS.\r\n\r\n  (Compiled from Central American government publications; values in\r\n                            American gold.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                    United States  Great Britain    Germany      Total\r\n\r\nGuatemala, 1913      5,053,060      1,650,387      2,043,329   10,062,327\r\n           1915      3,751,761        577,206        146,053    5,072,476\r\nSalvador, 1913       2,491,145      1,603,846        713,855    6,173,545\r\n          1915       2,478,322      1,054,838         41,136    4,182,922\r\nNicaragua, 1913      3,244,008      1,150,611        619,212    5,770,006\r\n           1915      2,592,799        302,294         36,960    3,159,219\r\nHonduras, 1913-14    5,262,000        460,000        522,000    6,625,000\r\n          1914-15    5,177,000        303,000         96,000    5,875,000\r\nCosta Rica, 1913     4,468,946      1,289,181      1,341,333    8,867,280\r\n            1915     3,031,997        548,810         42,979    4,478,782\r\nTotal for Central   ----------      ---------      ---------   ----------\r\nAmerica, 1913       20,519,159      6,154,025      5,239,729   37,498,158\r\n         1915       17,031,879      2,786,148        363,128   22,768,399\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE VII\r\n\r\n            PRINCIPAL IMPORTS OF GUATEMALA, 1913 and 1915.\r\n\r\n(From U.

The\r\nreasons why American exporters fail to make a better showing in Latin\r\nAmerican markets have been discussed so often and so fully in the last\r\nthree years that there is little object in repeating them here. It is\r\nsufficient to say that the same story of carelessness in filling orders\r\nand in packing goods, of failure to send well-equipped salesmen, and\r\nof refusal to comply with the custom of the country in such matters as\r\ncredits and accommodations, are heard in Central America as elsewhere.\r\nSince the European war has forced the importers of the Isthmus to\r\ndepend more than ever before upon American manufacturers for their\r\nsupplies, one hears many complaints of inconsiderate or discourteous\r\ntreatment, and of general inefficiency in handling trade.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief obstacles to the increase of American trade in\r\nCentral America has been the lack of banking facilities. Most of the\r\nbanks which exist in the larger cities of the Isthmus at the present\r\ntime are purely local institutions, and their operations are rarely\r\nsuch as to make them a strong force for good in the economic life of\r\nthe community. They speculate in the rate of exchange, issue more or\r\nless depreciated paper money, engage in financial transactions with\r\nthe government which consume a large part of their available funds,\r\nand make loans to planters and merchants at rates of interest which\r\nvary from ten per cent, with first-class security, to thirty or forty\r\nper cent in cases where the element of speculation is greater. These\r\nconditions, which are perhaps inevitable in a country where capital\r\nis so scarce and where the instability of political affairs makes\r\nthe element of risk in all credit transactions so great, seriously\r\ndetract from their usefulness. Unfortunately, moreover, there are\r\nsome institutions which are not managed in accordance with the\r\nprinciples either of sound banking or of ordinary honesty, and these\r\nare necessarily a source of weakness to the whole financial community.\r\nWithin the last five years, two of the largest banks in Central America\r\nhave failed, under circumstances which aroused very grave suspicions\r\nof mismanagement and defalcation. The banks cannot afford adequate\r\nfacilities for financing the export and the import trade, for they\r\nhave neither the available funds nor the connections abroad which are\r\nnecessary for this purpose. Moreover, they can obtain such high profits\r\nin other forms of operations that there is little inducement for them\r\nto engage in ordinary commercial transactions. Many of them are engaged\r\nin the coffee export business or in other forms of trade themselves\r\nand are consequently little inclined to aid other merchants who may\r\nwish to compete with them. The establishment of branches of American\r\nbanks, dedicated to a legitimate banking business, and especially to\r\nthe financing of American trade, would perhaps do more to stimulate\r\ncommerce with the United States than any other one influence.\r\n\r\nThe question of credits has been another serious obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment of our trade. The average Central American merchant must\r\nhave from three to six months to make payment for goods which he\r\nimports, because he in turn must grant a considerable time to the\r\nsmall retail dealers whom he supplies. American manufacturers are as a\r\nrule unwilling to grant credits for so long a period, and they have\r\nsometimes exposed themselves to heavy loss when they have done so\r\nbecause of the difficulty of ascertaining which of the local importers\r\nwere deserving of confidence. This difficulty also could to a great\r\nextent be obviated if reliable American banks could be established in\r\nthe five republics.\r\n\r\nThat our commerce holds first place in Central America despite these\r\ndrawbacks is due partly to the fact that there are certain articles,\r\nsuch as flour, railway material, and petroleum, which the people of the\r\nIsthmus must almost inevitably purchase in our markets, and partly to\r\nthe activity of a few great corporations which have stores or permanent\r\nagencies in Central America, and handle a very large amount of imports\r\nfrom the United States. The United Fruit Company and other fruit\r\ncompanies in Honduras and Nicaragua, as well as most of the mining\r\ncompanies, maintain commissaries where American goods are sold in\r\ngreat quantities. Grace and Company, in co-operation with the American\r\nInternational Corporation, does a considerable business in merchandise\r\non the West Coast, and has offices in most of the important cities of\r\nthe Isthmus. Several well-known American manufacturers also are more\r\nor less adequately represented by permanent agents in the important\r\ncommercial centers.\r\n\r\nAlthough our share in the total imports and exports of the Isthmus has\r\nbeen greater than ever before, since the beginning of the European\r\nwar, the total of our trade has not been so large as might have been\r\nexpected, because of the partial paralyzation of the commerce of the\r\nfive republics. At the outbreak of hostilities the foreign credits\r\nupon which the normal business of the Central American community had\r\ndepended were entirely cut off, and exchange on European centers rose\r\nto a prohibitive figure, especially in the countries which were not on\r\na gold basis. Merchants were thus unable to obtain goods or even to pay\r\ntheir debts. At the same time, the purchasing power of their customers\r\nwas seriously decreased, because the rise in the rate of exchange\r\nmade prices inordinately high in the local currency, and because the\r\nplanters, unable to secure advances from abroad to move their crops,\r\nwere forced to cut down their expenditures and in some cases to lay off\r\ntheir workmen. Most of the governments, also, were in severe financial\r\ndifficulties, for their revenues, which consisted chiefly of the import\r\nduties, had declined, and their expenditures, of which the money for\r\nthe service of the foreign debt constituted an important part, had\r\nincreased with the advance in the cost of foreign drafts. Some of them\r\nwere thus unable to pay their employees, and the poverty of the latter\r\nintensified the general financial depression. For a time, the sale\r\nof foreign goods almost ceased. When it was found, however, that the\r\nproducts of the Isthmus could still be sold abroad, even if at somewhat\r\nlower prices, confidence began to return and commerce recovered to some\r\ndegree, but imports are still far below normal, and seem likely to\r\nremain so for some time.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the war, it seems probable that the position lost\r\nby English and German exporters since 1914 will be regained by them,\r\nunless their American competitors make a more successful effort than\r\nthey have yet made to secure a permanent foothold in the market. The\r\nEuropean houses which control the import business of the Isthmus\r\nwill probably turn back to their former correspondents at the first\r\nopportunity, for their experience with American firms in the last three\r\nyears has not been such as to encourage them to continue it after they\r\nare able to resume their old connections. Many of the difficulties\r\nwhich merchants in Central America say they have encountered in dealing\r\nwith American exporters have undoubtedly been due to war conditions\r\nin the United States and to an ignorance on both sides of the other’s\r\nmethods of doing business, but many others can only have resulted from\r\ncarelessness and indifference to new trade opportunities.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is every prospect that the share of the United\r\nStates in the commerce of Central America will continue to increase in\r\nthe future as it has in the past. Proximity and the excellent steamer\r\nconnections created by the banana trade give our manufacturers an\r\nadvantage against which European importers will find it increasingly\r\nhard to compete. The North American element in the Isthmus as a whole\r\nis increasing more rapidly than any other foreign element, especially\r\nin the banana towns on the East Coast, and North American investments\r\nare probably already greater than those of any other country. The\r\nricher classes among the Central Americans themselves, moreover, travel\r\nmore and more in the United States rather than in Europe, and thus\r\nacquire a taste for articles of North American manufacture, where they\r\nformerly demanded French or English products. A great increase in our\r\ntrade with the five republics waits only upon the establishment of\r\nproper banking facilities and upon the awakening of American exporters\r\nto a realization of their opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] Figures of Costa Rican government for imports from Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nNote.

(Costa Rica, _Anuario Estadístico_, 1913, p. 279.)\r\n\r\n[76] It is probable that more than this was actually produced. Large\r\namounts are said to be smuggled out of certain countries every year to\r\navoid paying the export tax, and this assertion is to some extent borne\r\nout by a comparison of the export statistics with the import statistics\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n[77] Figures not available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                    CENTRAL AMERICAN PUBLIC FINANCE\r\n\r\n Sources of Revenue--Defects of the Fiscal Systems--Floating\r\n Debts--Brief History of the Bonded Debt in Each Republic--Depreciation\r\n of the Currency Systems--The Monetary Situation in Each Country--Need\r\n for Financial Assistance from the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew factors have done more to retard the economic progress of the\r\nCentral American republics than the defects of their fiscal systems.\r\nThe inability of the governments to meet the current expenses of\r\nefficient administration or to discharge their obligations to\r\nforeigners, and the demoralization of the monetary systems which has\r\nresulted from attempts to make the depreciation of the currency a\r\nsource of revenue, have been a serious drawback to the investment\r\nof capital and the development of commerce in the Isthmus, and have\r\ninvolved some of the five countries in rather serious diplomatic\r\ncomplications. This financial weakness has been due partly to\r\nthe nature of the governments’ incomes, partly to defects in\r\nadministration, arising from ignorance or dishonesty, and partly to\r\ngeneral economic and political conditions.\r\n\r\nEach of the five republics obtains its revenues principally from\r\ncustoms duties, on exports and imports, and from the rum monopoly.\r\nOther sources of income, of which the most important are tobacco and\r\npowder monopolies and stamp taxes, amount to very little as compared\r\nwith these two great items. Direct property taxes, the introduction of\r\nwhich has at times been attempted in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa\r\nRica, have met with very little success, and have been very unpopular.\r\n\r\nThis fiscal system has many bad features. The duties upon imports,\r\nupon which the chief reliance is placed, are so high that they seem\r\nin many cases to discourage commerce. This is especially true in\r\nregard to the cheap textiles and other articles used by the working\r\nclasses, for the imposition of the duty according to the gross weight\r\nof the package, and the failure to make adequate distinction between\r\ndifferent qualities of the same category of articles, raises the prices\r\nof some goods to a point where consumption is materially lessened.\r\nThere are still stronger objections to the second great source of\r\nrevenue, the manufacture and sale of _aguardiente_, or rum, for as in\r\nother countries where similar monopolies have existed the temptation\r\nto stimulate the consumption of the liquor has in some cases proved\r\nstronger than consideration for the welfare of the community. In view\r\nof the relation between drink and vice and crime, which is nowhere more\r\ndirectly evident than among the working classes of the Isthmus, it is\r\nhard to understand how the public authorities can not only permit but\r\nencourage the unrestricted sale of what is little more than a low grade\r\nof alcohol. Some of the governments, indeed, have endeavored by raising\r\nthe price of the _aguardiente_ to check its consumption, and have\r\ndone so without materially decreasing their own income, but with the\r\nmajority the object has seemed to be to sell a large amount at a low\r\nprice rather than the opposite.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the revenues of each of the five republics in\r\n1913, the last year before the general financing disorganization caused\r\nby the European war:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Revenues in 1913.

The miscellaneous expenditures include items of nearly $500,000\r\n for “exchange,” i. e. for buying drafts on foreign places, in\r\n Guatemala, and of $1,680,000 for paying claims arising from recent\r\n revolutions in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe revenues are decreased, and the expenditures are increased, in\r\nsome countries to an alarming degree, by inefficiency and corruption\r\nin their administration. The control of the public funds is almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the President and his subordinates, for the\r\nvoting of taxes and of the budget by Congress is a very perfunctory\r\nmatter even in those countries which have most nearly attained\r\nconstitutional government in other respects. The income is derived\r\nfrom sources which remain much the same from year to year, and its\r\ndisposition is subject to little control by the Congress, because the\r\nannual financial legislation does not always appropriate specific sums\r\nfor specific purposes, but simply divides the estimated expenditure\r\nbetween the various departments. The administration, moreover, does\r\nnot seem to regard itself as bound to keep within the general limits\r\nlaid down if it can obtain funds for additional outlays. The Congress,\r\nwhich is rarely in a position to oppose itself to the wishes of\r\nthe executive in this or in other matters, usually ratifies excess\r\nexpenditures or proposed changes in the budget with little question.\r\n\r\nIn some of the countries, there is undoubtedly a large amount of\r\ncorruption in the management of financial affairs. The traditions\r\nof the public service encourage rather lax conduct on the part of\r\nthe officials, for custom and public opinion tolerate many practices\r\nwhich are now considered improper in countries which have had a longer\r\nexperience in self-government, and those who are unscrupulous are\r\naided in defrauding the government by the inadequate provision which\r\nis made for the supervision of accounts. The commonest forms of graft\r\nare those which imply a rather loose standard of official morality\r\nrather than actual theft or dishonesty, but it cannot be denied that\r\nthere are many officials, some of whom occupy the highest positions in\r\ntheir respective countries, who have enriched themselves during their\r\ntenure of office by means which nothing could excuse. Few such men,\r\nfortunately, occupy positions of power in the five republics at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe chief fault of Central American public finance is the indifference\r\nshown in regard to the balancing of revenues and expenditures. The\r\ngovernments frequently pay salaries and other obligations with receipts\r\nrather than with money. This practice gives rise to many abuses, for\r\noften the receipts can be cashed only by persons having influence\r\nwith the authorities of the treasury department, and thus become a\r\nsource of graft. Certain governments, indeed, make it a practice to\r\nbuy their own promises to pay at a discount, after depreciating them\r\nby refusing to redeem them at their face value. The floating debt,\r\nwhich ordinarily bears a very high rate of interest, is always an\r\nindefinite but steadily increasing quantity, comprising a great variety\r\nof obligations. It includes claims for salaries and for supplies\r\nfurnished to the government, for damage to property during revolutions,\r\nfor violated concessions and contracts, and other demands of every\r\ndegree of validity. Some of these are paid off from time to time as the\r\ncondition of the treasury permits, but no provision is made for the\r\nservice or amortization of the internal debt as a whole.[79]\r\n\r\nEach of the five republics has also a bonded debt, held for the most\r\npart in England. In most cases this dates back to the loan of £163,000\r\ncontracted in London by the officials of the first Central American\r\nFederation. Costa Rica and Salvador paid off their share of this after\r\nthey became independent, but the other states, after defaulting for\r\nseveral years, eventually made arrangements for refunding the bonds\r\nwith new loans. At the same time, further issues were made, chiefly\r\nfor the construction of railways, during the period of prosperity\r\nand inflation which accompanied the first development of the coffee\r\nplantations in the seventies and eighties. These were often accompanied\r\nby fraud, in which both the officials of the Central American\r\ngovernments and the companies which floated the bonds participated,\r\nand which in some cases reached immense proportions. The service of\r\nthe foreign debts became very difficult when the coffee prices fell,\r\nand when the decline in the price of silver, upon which the monetary\r\nsystems of the Isthmus were based, greatly increased the amount of\r\nthe debt in terms of the national currency without proportionately\r\nincreasing the national revenues. During the decade 1890-1900, nearly\r\nall of the republics found it impossible to maintain regular payments\r\nof interest. New arrangements were therefore made with the creditors,\r\nwho were forced to accept successive reductions of their claims,\r\namounting in some cases to a large proportion of the total, in order\r\nto obtain any payment at all. These readjustments, with the partial\r\nrepudiation which they involved, naturally injured severely the credit\r\nof the five countries.\r\n\r\nGuatemala has until very recently been involved in almost continuous\r\ndifficulties with her creditors. Her share of the debt of the Central\r\nAmerican Federation remained in default until 1856, when it was\r\nrefunded with the accrued interest into a new five per cent loan of\r\n£100,000. In 1869 another loan of £500,000, issued at 70¹⁄₂ and bearing\r\ninterest at six per cent, was issued through a London banking house.\r\nBoth loans went into default in 1876. They were refunded in 1888 by a\r\nbond issue of £922,700, bearing four per cent interest, and another\r\nissue was made at the same time to consolidate the internal debt. The\r\nRepublic again failed to meet its obligations to its creditors in 1894,\r\nand the latter were forced to accept a further reduction of their\r\nclaims. By an arrangement made in 1895, both the external and internal\r\nbonds were refunded by a new issue of £1,600,000, at four per cent,\r\nsecured by a special tax of $1.50 gold on each bag of coffee exported.\r\nThese bonds now constitute the principal foreign debt of the Republic.\r\nThe government soon violated the terms of the agreement under which\r\nthey were issued, for the coffee export tax was reduced in 1898 and\r\n1899, and its proceeds were used for other purposes than the service\r\nof the loan. Payments of interest were suspended from 1898 to 1913.\r\nAfter several fruitless attempts to reach an agreement, the bondholders\r\nfinally secured the resumption of payments through the energetic\r\ndiplomatic intervention of the British government, and the interest has\r\nbeen met regularly since 1913. The principal, on December 31, 1915,\r\namounted to £2,357,063.[80]\r\n\r\nSalvador had paid off her share of the federal debt in 1860, by a\r\ncompromise with the holders of the bonds. In 1899, a loan of £300,000\r\nat six per cent and in 1892 another of £500,000 at six per cent were\r\nobtained from bankers in London for the purpose of extending the\r\nrailway line from Acajutla to Santa Ana and San Salvador. These were\r\nsecured by mortgages on the railway. In 1894 the service of the loans\r\nwas assumed by the Central American Public Works Company, which took\r\nover the railway for eighty years in return for a promise of an annual\r\nsubsidy from the government and a guarantee of a minimum annual profit.\r\nIn 1899 this company entered into another contract with the Republic,\r\nby which it agreed to retire on its own account all of the 1889 and\r\n1892 bonds, converting them into five per cent mortgage debentures of\r\nthe Salvador Railway Company, which had been formed to take over the\r\nconcessions held by the Public Works Company. The Railway Company was\r\nto receive a fixed annual subsidy of £24,000 for eighteen years. In\r\nthis way the bonds ceased to be obligations of the Republic. The only\r\nforeign bonded debt of Salvador at the present time is the issue of\r\nsix per cent sterling bonds secured through two London banks in 1908.\r\nOn January 1, 1916, £756,900 out of the original £1,000,000 were still\r\noutstanding. The service of these was suspended after the outbreak of\r\nthe European war, but an arrangement was made with the bondholders by\r\nwhich the coupons from August, 1915, to August, 1919, were to be funded\r\ninto new bonds bearing seven per cent interest.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica, which had paid off her share of the Central American\r\ndebt in full immediately after the dissolution of the Federation,\r\ncontracted two loans in London,--one of £1,000,000 at six per cent in\r\n1871, and the other of £2,400,000 at seven per cent in 1872,--during\r\nthe first years of General Guardia’s administration. From the two,\r\nit is said that the Republic received a total sum of £1,158,611, 18\r\ns, 5 d,[81] the rest being kept by the speculators who arranged the\r\ntransaction. The service of the debt was suspended in 1874. In 1885 a\r\nnew arrangement was made through Mr. Minor C. Keith, by which the old\r\nbonds were refunded at one half their face value by a new issue of\r\n£2,000,000 at five per cent. The interest was to be paid by Mr. Keith\r\nuntil 1888, in return for concessions in regard to the railroad which\r\nhe was building, and after that date by the government. The service\r\nof the debt was suspended from 1895 to 1897, when a new agreement\r\nwas made by which the rate of interest was reduced and the unpaid\r\ncoupons were exchanged for certificates at forty per cent of their\r\nface value. Payments were resumed and were maintained until October,\r\n1901, when a financial crisis caused by high rates of exchange and\r\nfalling coffee prices again forced the government to suspend them. For\r\nnearly ten years the bondholders were put off, usually on the ground\r\nthat the Republic was unable to pay as much as its creditors asked.\r\nEach administration made an effort to settle the matter by securing\r\na reduction of the debt, but refunding contracts made with Speyer\r\nand Company in 1905 and with the National City Bank of New York in\r\n1909 were rejected by the Congress. Finally, however, the pressing\r\nneed for refunding the internal debt, which bore ruinous rates of\r\ninterest and was increasing alarmingly every year, led the government\r\nto make a new contract with Mr. Minor Keith in 1911. This provided for\r\na bond issue of £1,617,200, bearing four per cent interest for the\r\nfirst ten years and five per cent thereafter, to refund entirely the\r\nprincipal and the unpaid interest of the old debt, which, even with\r\nthe numerous previous reductions, amounted to £2,710,293 by the end of\r\n1910. The creditors accepted the arrangement, and the bonds were taken\r\nby an international syndicate, formed by bankers in New York, London,\r\nHamburg, and Paris. The interest was secured by the customs revenues,\r\nthe administration of which was to be taken over by the syndicate in\r\ncase of default. As soon as the Congress had ratified this agreement,\r\nanother loan of 35,000,000 francs at five per cent, issued at eighty,\r\nand secured by a mortgage on the _aguardiente_ monopoly, was arranged\r\nin Paris for the payment of the internal debt. Since 1911, the service\r\nof these obligations has been maintained with scrupulous regularity.\r\nThe total foreign debt of the Republic on December 31, 1915, was\r\n31,478,392.27 colones, or $14,641,112.68 American gold.[82]\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua, £285,000 in six per cent bonds secured by a mortgage on\r\nthe National Railway had been issued in 1886. Payments were suspended\r\non these in 1894, and an arrangement was made in 1895 by which the\r\ninterest was reduced to four per cent. In 1904, another six per cent\r\nloan, to the amount of $1,000,000 gold, was negotiated with Mr.\r\nWeinberger of New Orleans. Both of these debts were paid in 1909 by\r\nmeans of an issue of £1,250,000 at six per cent contracted for by the\r\nEthelburga Syndicate of London. The interest on the Ethelburga loan\r\nwas reduced to five per cent in 1912, through the good offices of the\r\ntwo New York banking firms which had undertaken the reorganization of\r\nthe currency, on condition that these firms continue to administer the\r\ncustoms revenues of the Republic, by which the bonds were secured.\r\nThe total foreign debt of Nicaragua on December 31, 1915, was as\r\nfollows:[83]\r\n\r\nEthelburga bonds (£1,179,620)        $5,740,131\r\nDebt to Brown Brothers and Seligman   1,060,000\r\n                                     ----------\r\nTotal                                $6,800,131\r\n\r\nHonduras is now the only one of the Central American republics which\r\nhas not effected some adjustment of its foreign debt. This country,\r\non January 1, 1916, owed to foreign creditors the immense sum of\r\n£25,407,858,[84] arising from loans contracted in London and Paris\r\nin the years 1867-70. Bonds to a nominal value of £5,398,570, and\r\nbearing from five to ten per cent interest, were issued at that time\r\nfor the construction of an interoceanic railroad from Puerto Cortez\r\nto the Gulf of Fonseca. The greater part of the money received from\r\nthe investors in these securities seems to have been divided between\r\nthe officials of the Republic and the promoters, with the result\r\nthat the sum which finally found its way into the national treasury\r\nwas sufficient only to build ninety kilometers of the railroad. The\r\npayments of interest, which until that time had been made out of the\r\nprincipal of the loan, were suspended in 1872, and the quotation of\r\nthe bonds on the European exchanges dropped rapidly from 85¹⁄₂% to\r\n1¹⁄₄% of their face value.[85] A few half-hearted efforts to enter into\r\nnegotiations with the bondholders have been made during the years which\r\nhave since intervened, but the Republic has shown little inclination\r\nto make good its obligations, and there have even been occasional\r\npropositions to repudiate the debt altogether, because of the fraud\r\nwhich accompanied its flotation. Meanwhile the government has been\r\nunable to make arrangements for the extension of the National Railway\r\ninto the interior, because of the lien held by the bondholders upon the\r\nline, and it has also been unable to obtain new loans for carrying out\r\nother internal improvements. The foreign debt has thus been one of the\r\nprincipal factors which have retarded the Republic’s economic advance.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1909, a plan for the settlement of the debt was arranged by\r\nthe British minister in Central America, but its consummation was\r\nprevented by the protest of the United States, which insisted that\r\nprovision must at the same time be made for the adjustment of certain\r\nAmerican claims. An arrangement suggested by J. P. Morgan and Company\r\nwas therefore substituted for the British scheme. The New York bankers\r\nagreed to purchase the old bonds at the rate of £15 in cash for each\r\n£100 of the old bonds with their accrued interest, on condition that\r\nthe United States government be a party to the agreement under which\r\nthis was done. After some delay, a treaty was signed on January 10,\r\n1911, by Secretary of State Knox and the Minister of Honduras at\r\nWashington, in accordance with which the United States was to assist\r\nHonduras in obtaining a loan secured by her customs duties, which\r\nwere to be administered, until the bonds were paid, by a collector\r\ngeneral nominated by the State Department. The treaty was rejected by\r\nthe Honduranean Congress on January 31, 1911.[86] After the Bonilla\r\nrevolution, another attempt was made to arrange for the loan, but there\r\nwas such strong opposition to the treaty in the American Senate that\r\nnothing could be accomplished. In February, 1912, J. P. Morgan and\r\nCompany withdrew from the negotiations, and a syndicate of New Orleans\r\nbankers took their place. The treaty, however, was never ratified, and\r\nthe plan for a new loan was finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nAt the Pan American Financial Conference in May, 1915, the delegates\r\nfrom Honduras announced that their government was ready to increase\r\nthe customs duties and the banana export tax to a point where they\r\nwould yield an additional sum of $410,000 gold each year, which might\r\nbe set aside for the service of the foreign debt. As the holders of the\r\nbonds have indicated their willingness to negotiate upon this basis,\r\nthere seems to be reason to hope that an adjustment will eventually be\r\nbrought about which will place the credit of the Republic on a sound\r\nbasis.[87] Until this is done, it will be impossible to build railroads\r\nor to carry out the other internal improvements which are indispensable\r\nfor the development of the country.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Central American governments to fulfill their\r\nobligations to foreign creditors is not due entirely to a listless\r\nsense of national honor, for in many cases there has been serious\r\ndoubt whether these obligations should be regarded as entirely valid.\r\nThe circumstances under which the majority of the public debts were\r\ncontracted were such that the governments have felt a strong reluctance\r\nto recognize their duty to repay them in full. The bonds, bearing heavy\r\nrates of interest, were usually purchased in the first place at a\r\nconsiderable reduction from their face value, and the speculators who\r\nfloated them took advantage of the ignorance or the cupidity of the\r\nagents with whom they negotiated to defraud the borrowing governments\r\nof large sums. A large part of the product of the issue, in fact, seems\r\nin many cases to have been retained by the underwriters or divided by\r\nthem with the Central American officials. Subsequent administrations\r\nwere naturally unwilling to repay sums from which the country as a\r\nwhole had never received the benefit, especially as the service of the\r\nloan involved a heavy and in some cases intolerable burden upon the\r\nimpoverished treasury and deprived the government of resources which\r\nwere sorely needed for the maintenance of order and the promotion of\r\ninternal improvements.\r\n\r\nOne of the influences which have most disastrously affected the\r\ngovernment finances and the credit of the Central American republics\r\nduring the last generation has been the depreciation of their\r\ncurrencies. Until the last decade of the nineteenth century, the money\r\nof the Isthmus had been based upon the silver dollar, subdivided into\r\neight _reales_ or one hundred cents. Each of the five countries had its\r\nown coinage, but foreign money, especially from other Latin American\r\nstates, was ordinarily accepted at its face value. When the market\r\nprice of silver declined, as it did with great rapidity after 1890,\r\nthere was a serious disturbance both of the foreign commerce and of the\r\nfinances and credit of the five governments, and this disturbance was\r\nintensified by a further depreciation of the currency, in Guatemala,\r\nCosta Rica, and Nicaragua, by the issue of irredeemable paper money.\r\nFor a number of years, rates of exchange fluctuated widely, with\r\na general upward tendency, and it became increasingly difficult\r\nfor merchants to pay their bills in foreign countries and for the\r\ngovernments to meet the service of their loans. Costa Rica, and later\r\nNicaragua, succeeded in establishing a currency on a gold basis, but in\r\nthe other republics the situation grew more and more difficult until\r\nthe outbreak of the European war in 1915. This catastrophe caused the\r\nrate of exchange upon New York to rise from 25 to 100 per cent in each\r\nof the five countries, and made necessary a suspension of payments upon\r\nthe foreign debt in two of them.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes have contributed to the disorganization of the Central\r\nAmerican currencies. The fallacies which have at times caused\r\nunfortunate experiments with the monetary systems of other countries\r\nhave been as attractive in Central America as elsewhere, and every\r\nfinancial or commercial depression has seen demands, which have\r\nusually been acceded to, for an increase in the circulating medium.\r\nThe banks, whose notes form the larger part of the currency in each\r\nstate, have been subject to little effective regulation, and have in\r\nsome cases been abetted by the governments in flooding the country\r\nwith worthless paper money. By unscrupulous speculation in foreign\r\nexchange, moreover, they have often done much to cause unnecessarily\r\nviolent fluctuations in the premium on gold. At the present time, laws\r\nrelieving the banks of their obligation to exchange their notes for\r\ngold or silver are in force in Guatemala, Salvador, Nicaragua, and\r\nCosta Rica. The factor which has done most to disorganize the monetary\r\nsystems of the five republics, however, has been the inability of the\r\nauthorities to resist the temptation to use the depreciation of the\r\ncurrency as a source of revenue. There is no easier method of raising\r\nmoney for pressing needs than the issue of government paper or the\r\ngranting of special privileges to the banks in return for loans; and\r\nfew of the countries have as yet learned that such a policy in the long\r\nrun does far more harm than good.\r\n\r\nThe worst currency system of the Isthmus is that of Guatemala, where\r\nsilver coin has entirely disappeared from the circulation within the\r\nlast twenty years. On assuming office in 1898, President Estrada\r\nCabrera found himself confronted by serious financial difficulties\r\narising from the extravagance of his predecessor and the business\r\ndepression from which all of the Central American countries were at\r\nthe time suffering. In order to provide funds, the new administration\r\nresorted to what was practically an issue of unsecured paper money.\r\nIn return for a large loan, drawn in part from the reserves which\r\nguaranteed their circulation, the banks were relieved of their\r\nobligation to redeem their notes in silver, and a large issue of\r\nnew notes, guaranteed solely by the claims of the banks against the\r\ngovernment, was made at the same time through the so-called _Comité\r\nBancario_. Subsequent decrees made all debts payable in paper even\r\nthough the contracts expressly provided for payment in silver.\r\nThe redemption of the bank-notes has never been attempted, and\r\nfurther issues have been made from time to time until the amount in\r\ncirculation, on January 1, 1916, was more than $160,000,000.[88] The\r\nmoney depreciated rapidly. Just before the outbreak of the European\r\nwar, the paper _peso_ was worth about five cents in gold, but in August\r\nand September, 1914, the difficulty of obtaining drafts on foreign\r\ncountries forced the rate of exchange from 20 to 1 to 40 to 1. It has\r\nremained approximately at this point since that time, although it has\r\nfluctuated considerably, sometimes rising or falling as much as thirty\r\nper cent within a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe circulating medium is now in a very bad condition. The notes of the\r\nsmaller denominations are dirty and torn almost beyond recognition,\r\nand in quantity they fall far short of supplying the necessities of\r\ncommerce. The subsidiary coinage, which consists of nickel and copper\r\npieces of 12¹⁄₂ and 25 cents, is also insufficient in quantity, and it\r\nis supplemented in ordinary transactions by tokens issued by business\r\nhouses and municipalities, tram-car tickets, and postage stamps. This\r\nstate of affairs naturally causes great inconvenience to persons\r\nengaged in commerce on a small scale.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations in the rate of exchange make business transactions\r\nvery difficult, for merchants who handle imported goods must change\r\ntheir prices from day to day if they are to avoid loss, and must at\r\nthe same time face the greatly decreased purchasing power of the\r\nmasses of the people when the money in which wages and salaries are\r\npaid depreciates. There is a growing tendency to quote prices and make\r\ntransactions in United States currency, of which there is a large\r\namount in circulation.\r\n\r\nProposals for reforming the currency have been made from time to\r\ntime, but none of them have been taken up by the government. The\r\nreintroduction of a metal standard, in fact, has been opposed by one of\r\nthe most influential classes in the community. The coffee planters and\r\nother employers of labor have benefited greatly by the rising rate of\r\nexchange. Despite the depreciation of the currency, they have raised\r\nthe wages of their employees comparatively little, and the latter,\r\nbound by contracts from which the decline in their earning power made\r\nit more difficult than ever for them to escape, have been unable to\r\nprotest. The result has been an enormous increase in profits, for wage\r\ncosts have been reduced, while the coffee has continued to be sold for\r\ngold in the European and North American markets. The government also\r\nbenefits by the present situation, for the revenues from the customs\r\nhouses are received in gold, and the employees are paid in paper, with\r\nthe result that there is a yearly increasing surplus in favor of the\r\ntreasury. The effect of this condition on the morality of the underpaid\r\nofficials has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua, monetary conditions were much similar to those in\r\nGuatemala before the reform carried out by the New York bankers in\r\n1912. President Zelaya had driven the silver out of circulation early\r\nin his administration by the issue of legal tender treasury notes, and\r\nthe value of the _peso_, after his fall, had sunk to about five cents\r\ngold. The establishment of a new currency, under the 1911 treasury\r\nbills agreement, has been described in Chapter XI. At the beginning\r\nof the European war, the new money was exchangeable at par for sight\r\ndrafts on New York. The inability of the government to replenish the\r\nexchange fund against which these drafts were drawn forced the National\r\nBank to suspend their sale for a time, with the result that the premium\r\non American exchange rose to thirty per cent early in 1915. More\r\nrecently, however, the National Bank has resumed the sale of drafts at\r\npar with its own funds.\r\n\r\nHonduras is still upon a silver basis. Silver coin circulates at its\r\nintrinsic value, and bank-notes, which are generally used in commerce,\r\nare accepted at par in the cities and towns, although the country\r\npeople as a rule prefer to use specie. The Republic has coined little\r\nmoney of its own, but a considerable part of the silver of Guatemala\r\nand Nicaragua found its way over the border when those republics fell\r\nunder a paper regime, and _pesos_, or dollars, from Salvador, Chile,\r\nand Peru are in general use. The monetary system of the Republic is\r\nthus better than that of the majority of its neighbors, but it can\r\nnevertheless hardly be said to be sound. The rise and fall of the price\r\nof silver in the world’s markets involves fluctuations in the rate of\r\nexchange which are only less violent than in the case of an unsecured\r\npaper circulation, and cause much inconvenience and danger to merchants\r\ndealing with foreign countries. A part of the Republic’s imports, which\r\nfor several years past have exceeded the exports, are undoubtedly paid\r\nfor in silver coin, despite the restrictions on the export of specie.\r\nThis tends to leave only subsidiary coins, of a lower standard of\r\nfineness than that of the _pesos_, in circulation, and to make it more\r\ndifficult also for the banks to maintain their metallic reserves. Since\r\nthe beginning of 1916, especially, the scarcity of exchange on New\r\nYork, combined with the high price of silver in the foreign markets,\r\nhas threatened to drain the country of its circulating medium, and has\r\nforced the government to forbid entirely the exportation of coin.\r\n\r\nThe currency of Salvador was until very recently on a silver basis,\r\nbut in August, 1914, the banks, whose notes formed a large part of the\r\ncirculating medium, were allowed to suspend silver payments in order to\r\nsafeguard their metallic reserves, and the exportation of specie was\r\nforbidden. Silver coin has now almost disappeared from circulation,\r\nand bank-notes and small nickel coins have taken its place in all\r\ntransactions. The fact that the banks still maintain a large reserve\r\nfor the resumption of specie payments after the war, however, has\r\nprevented a serious depreciation, although the rate of exchange has\r\nfluctuated considerably.\r\n\r\nIn Costa Rica, the depreciation of the currency had begun as early as\r\n1882 with the issue of government paper and bank-notes which gradually\r\ndrove silver coin out of circulation. Rates of exchange rose slowly\r\nuntil 1896, when President Rafael Yglesias procured the passage of a\r\nlaw which provided for the establishment of a gold standard. A unit\r\ncalled the _colón_, worth about 46¹⁄₂ cents in United States currency,\r\nwas adopted, and certificates were gradually exchanged for the old\r\nmoney at the rate of one _colón_ for one _peso_. On July 15, 1900, the\r\ngovernment was able to begin the redemption of these certificates in\r\ngold coin. A new law, meanwhile, had required the banks to guarantee\r\ntheir notes by adequate reserves of specie, so that the currency of\r\nthe Republic was placed upon a sound basis. At the outbreak of the\r\nEuropean war, however, the government relieved the banks of their\r\nobligation to redeem their notes in gold. A little later, finding that\r\nits revenues were falling off, and being unable to arrange for a loan\r\nwith the existing banks, it granted to a new institution, the Banco\r\nInternacional, the privilege of issuing inconvertible notes secured by\r\ngovernment bonds. The result was a rapid depreciation of the currency.\r\nThe rate of exchange on New York rose from 218 on August 1, 1914, to\r\n260 in January, 1915, and to nearly 300 a few months later. It has been\r\nreduced somewhat since that time, and a metallic reserve has gradually\r\nbeen accumulated by the Banco Internacional, so that there seems to be\r\nground for hoping that the paper will be redeemed at par when normal\r\nconditions are restored.\r\n\r\nThe Central American republics will have to depend upon the assistance\r\nof foreign capital both for the readjustment of their foreign debts and\r\nthe reorganization of their monetary systems,--reforms for which the\r\nneed will become pressing soon after the conclusion of the war. The\r\nproblem of placing their credit on a sound basis is one of the most\r\nimportant which confronts them today. If their economic development\r\nis to continue, they will require new loans from abroad, not only\r\nfor refunding old obligations and stabilizing their depreciated and\r\nfluctuating currencies, but also for building railways and roads,\r\nimproving ports, and making other internal improvements. These new\r\nloans, probably, can be obtained to best advantage only in the United\r\nStates, with the aid of the American government, for no other country\r\nhas the interest which we have in the solvency and the economic welfare\r\nof the Central American nations, and no other, while the Monroe\r\nDoctrine is maintained in its present form, is really in a position\r\nto guarantee to its bankers the full measure of protection which\r\nis necessary to make loans to the republics of the Isthmus a safe\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] Includes export duties.\r\n\r\n[79] The internal debt of each of the republics, according to\r\nstatistics compiled from their Treasury Reports and from the 1915\r\nReport of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, was as\r\nfollows on December 31, 1914.\r\n\r\n(Figures in American gold.)\r\n\r\nGuatemala                   3,880,986\r\nSalvador                    4,563,676\r\nNicaragua                   6,676,662\r\nHonduras (July 31, 1914.)   1,844,585\r\nCosta Rica                  2,692,215\r\n\r\n\r\n[80] These and other details in regard to the bonded debts of the\r\nCentral American Republics are for the most part based on information\r\nin the 1915 Report of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign\r\nBondholders in London.\r\n\r\n[81] Message of President Jiménez to Congress, 1911.\r\n\r\n[82] Costa Rica, _Memoria de Hacienda_, 1915.

However much we may dislike interfering in the\r\ninternal affairs of our neighbors, we cannot remain indifferent when\r\ndisorder and misrule paralyze agriculture and commerce and threaten\r\nto provoke European intervention in a region where our political and\r\neconomic interests are so great as they are in the republics bordering\r\non the Caribbean Sea. Both for our own security and for the sake of\r\nhelping neighbors with whom we are united by powerful ties of proximity\r\nand common interests, we must inevitably use our influence more and\r\nmore to aid the Central American republics in developing stable\r\npolitical institutions which will insure their prosperity and their\r\ncontinued independence.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the United States in the Isthmus are far greater\r\nthan those of any other foreign power. In the first place, like the\r\nother countries around the Caribbean Sea, the five republics are one\r\nof the most promising fields for the expansion of American commerce\r\nand the investment of American capital. While no one of them is an\r\nimportant customer of itself, together they make up a market which will\r\none day be of very great value. Our exports to them have increased\r\ngreatly in recent years and especially since the beginning of the\r\nEuropean war, and our imports from them are growing steadily. Only a\r\nvery small part of the food-producing possibilities of the tropics,\r\nmoreover, has as yet been realized, and economists say that it is not\r\nimprobable that the people of the temperate zone will be forced to rely\r\nupon their equatorial neighbors for an increasingly large proportion\r\nof their provisions in the not distant future. If this is so, the\r\ndevelopment of that part of the tropics which is naturally tributary to\r\nus commercially cannot be a matter of indifference. This development\r\ncan only take place with the improvement of political conditions, and\r\nwith the introduction of capital from wealthier countries which the\r\nestablishment of peaceful government will make possible.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of peaceful government in the Isthmus is a matter\r\nin which we are deeply interested for political reasons. The Monroe\r\nDoctrine must always be a paramount principle of our foreign policy,\r\nat least in so far as it deals with the countries of the Caribbean,\r\nbecause the exercise of political influence in that region by a foreign\r\npower could not but be a constant menace to our peace and security.\r\nSeveral European nations, however, have extensive and legitimate\r\ninterests in Central America, for many of their citizens reside and\r\nown property there and most of the foreign debt of each of the five\r\nrepublics is held in London or Paris. It is impossible to expect that\r\nthey should remain inactive when these investments are made worthless\r\nby internal disorders or by the arbitrary action of irresponsible\r\nnative rulers. Whatever one may think of the morality of the protection\r\nof foreign investments by intervention and the collection of public\r\ndebts by force, this is the established practice of most civilized\r\nnations, and it is a practice which finds much justification in the\r\nconditions which exist in certain Central American countries. The\r\nlanding of troops and the seizure of ports by a foreign power, so near\r\nour shores and in the immediate vicinity of the Panama Canal, can\r\nhardly fail to endanger the most vital interests of the United States,\r\nbecause of the manifold opportunities which such measures afford for\r\nexerting an influence over internal politics. The control of the policy\r\nof one of the Central American governments by a European chancellory or\r\nthe grant of special economic privileges would of course be intolerable\r\nto the United States. That such consequences might follow even a simple\r\nintervention to enforce the payment of debts, is all too evident from\r\nevents which have occurred in other parts of the world. The American\r\ngovernment cannot, however, oppose measures adopted by European powers\r\nfor the protection of the legitimate interests of their nationals\r\nwithout itself assuming a certain responsibility for the safeguarding\r\nof foreign life and property. Even supposing that it were sufficiently\r\npowerful to prevent other governments from intervening, it could\r\nhardly allow its protection to be made a cloak for the confiscation of\r\nforeign property and the repudiation of bonded debts by unscrupulous\r\nprofessional revolutionists like those who have at one time or another\r\nbeen in power in each of the Central American countries.\r\n\r\nThe United States has already gone very far in its attempts to assist\r\nits Central American neighbors to attain political and financial\r\nstability. At first it limited its efforts to friendly advice and\r\nmediation. By participating in the Washington Conference of 1907,\r\nhowever, it became in a measure responsible for the enforcement of the\r\nconventions drawn up by that body, in so far, at least, as they related\r\nto the discouragement of revolutions, the compulsory arbitration of\r\ndisputes, and the neutralization of Honduras.[89] The continual\r\nviolation of the provisions of the Washington Treaties by President\r\nZelaya of Nicaragua led President Taft to break off relations with him\r\nin 1909 and to intervene in the revolution of that year in such a way\r\nthat the fall of the Liberal administration was inevitable; and the\r\nfinancial and military assistance which it was necessary to render to\r\nZelaya’s successors, in order to prevent the Republic from falling into\r\na state of anarchy, imposed new and still greater responsibilities upon\r\nthe United States. Since 1912, when a revolt against the established\r\nauthorities was suppressed by American troops, the Conservative\r\ngovernment at Managua has been kept in office by the presence of a\r\nforce of American marines, and the State Department has become deeply\r\ninvolved in assisting the Republic to adjust its financial affairs.\r\nThe United States has recently acquired new interests in the Isthmus\r\nby the treaty giving it the right to construct an interoceanic canal\r\nthrough Nicaragua and to establish a naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca.\r\nMeanwhile outbreaks of disorder have been discouraged in all parts of\r\nthe Isthmus by the influence exerted by the authorities at Washington\r\nagainst violations of the 1907 conventions and by their refusal to\r\nrecognize governments which came into power through revolution.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States has aroused strong antagonism in\r\nCentral America. The people of the Isthmus are by no means convinced\r\nof the disinterestedness or the friendly intentions of their\r\npowerful neighbor, and it would be difficult to persuade them that\r\nthe interference of the latter in their affairs will ultimately be\r\nfor their own good. Their hostility is due partly to the inevitable\r\nopposition among a proud and sensitive people to foreign intervention\r\nin their domestic concerns, and partly to the failure of the American\r\ngovernment to convince the Central Americans of the altruism of its\r\naims. Our State Department has had no definite, well-understood, and\r\nenergetically enforced policy, but has been forced from step to step\r\nby circumstances as they have arisen, and its course of action has\r\nnot always been such as to inspire confidence in the purity of its\r\nmotives. The attitude of the American government in the revolution\r\nof 1909-10 in Nicaragua, for example, was hardly consistent in view\r\nof its championship of the Washington Conventions, notwithstanding\r\nthe excellent reasons which the United States as well as the Central\r\nAmerican countries had for desiring President Zelaya’s fall. The\r\n“Dollar Diplomacy” of Mr. Taft’s administration was regarded throughout\r\nthe Isthmus as the opening wedge for the political absorption of the\r\nfive republics by the United States. This feeling caused the emphatic\r\nrejection of the proposed loan treaty by the Honduranean congress,\r\nand aroused a violent opposition to the financial policy of the\r\nConservative government in Nicaragua,--an opposition which was greatly\r\nintensified by the fact that the authorities who signed the loan\r\ncontracts and who turned over to American banking concerns the control\r\nof the customs houses, the currency system, and the national railways,\r\nwere maintained in office by the armed forces of the United States. The\r\nsteps taken more recently in connection with the canal treaty have been\r\nregarded by many Central Americans as final proof of the aggressive\r\nintentions of the American government.\r\n\r\nThe United States has nevertheless achieved one of its main objects, in\r\nthat revolutions and international wars have been checked throughout\r\nthe Isthmus. There has been no very serious disturbance of the peace\r\nsince the suppression of Mena’s revolt in Nicaragua in 1912. This has\r\nbeen due partly to the efforts of the State Department to secure the\r\nstrict observance of those provisions of the Washington Conventions\r\nwhich restrain the Central American republics from intervening in one\r\nanother’s internal political affairs, and from allowing their territory\r\nto be made the base of operations against neighboring governments, but\r\nmore to a fear on the part of native political leaders that a renewal\r\nof the disorderly conditions which formerly existed would lead to\r\nAmerican intervention and to the domination of their affairs, as in\r\nNicaragua, by an outside power. This apprehension has exerted a most\r\nvaluable restraining influence on enemies of the established order in\r\nmany countries which had hardly ever known five years of continuous\r\npeace before 1912. There were, it is true, small revolts in Nicaragua\r\nand Guatemala in 1915 and 1916, but they were easily suppressed by the\r\nauthorities, and they hardly disturbed the tranquillity of the greater\r\npart of the territory of the republics in which they occurred. Their\r\ninsignificance showed that no large or influential section of the\r\nopposition party had participated in them. As the result even of this\r\nshort era of peace, there has been a marked improvement in economic and\r\npolitical conditions in many sections of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe policy of refusing to recognize any forcible change of government,\r\nhowever, is a very difficult one to carry out consistently. It would\r\nbe manifestly impossible to prevent all revolutions. An attempt to do\r\nso would involve continual armed intervention in the internal affairs\r\nof the Central American republics, which would be as burdensome and\r\ndistasteful to the United States as it would be intolerable to the\r\npeople of the Isthmus. It is often equally impossible, and sometimes\r\nexceedingly disastrous, to refuse to recognize a government which has\r\nsprung from a revolution. After one administration has fallen and its\r\nsuccessor has established itself firmly in power, the refusal of the\r\nUnited States to recognize the new authorities only weakens them, and\r\nthus opens the way for a complete disintegration of the political\r\norganization, without advancing appreciably the cause of constitutional\r\ngovernment. The restoration of the old regime is rarely either possible\r\nor desirable. The ousted authorities, if they themselves secured\r\noffice, like almost all Central American administrations, as the\r\nresult of a successful revolution or an election controlled by the\r\ngovernment, can hardly lay claim to a higher degree of legality than\r\ntheir successors, and a president who has once lost his prestige and\r\nhis following is not often able to re-establish a strong and efficient\r\ngovernment, even with foreign support.\r\n\r\nThe prevention of chronic civil war is indeed the first great requisite\r\nfor the improvement of political conditions in Central America, but\r\neven peace will be a doubtful blessing in the long run if it is secured\r\nby the maintenance in office by outside influence of presidents who\r\nare responsible to no one and who have nothing to fear from popular\r\nopposition. The mere discouragement of revolutions offers no solution\r\nfor the most serious of Central America’s political problems, for it\r\nprovides no guarantee of good government and no peaceful method of\r\nremoving authorities whose rule may have become intolerable.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility resting upon the United States is the more\r\nserious, because the American government is not infrequently called\r\nupon actually to decide who shall be president of one or the other\r\nof the five republics. Even an intervention to protect foreign life\r\nand property often determines, as a matter of fact, the outcome of a\r\ncivil war, and the influence upon internal politics is still greater\r\nwhen the United States uses diplomatic pressure or force to prevent\r\na revolution or to bring about an agreement between the contending\r\nfactions. In either case, the United States practically imposes upon\r\nthe country affected the rule of one or the other political group. It\r\nis impossible to intervene merely to prevent disorder, and then leave\r\nto the people the choice of their own rulers, for elections, as we have\r\nseen, are nothing more than a form for putting into effect the choice\r\nof the government already in office. It would be foolish to attempt\r\nto force democratic institutions upon the less advanced republics\r\nof the Isthmus at the present time. No president of one of those\r\ncountries, however sincere he might be in his purpose, could really\r\nhold a free election, and any attempt to do so would probably end in\r\nbloodshed and disaster. An election supervised by the United States,\r\nwhich was proposed as a solution of the recent presidential problem in\r\nNicaragua, would be equally unsatisfactory as a means of establishing\r\na new administration. Aside from the difficulty of ascertaining the\r\nwishes of a nation where the majority of the voters have no interest in\r\npolitical affairs, there are so many opportunities for fraud and for\r\nthe exercise of pressure by the government and by the local officials\r\nat every stage of the campaign, as well as in the election itself, that\r\nit would be practically impossible to guarantee the opposition party a\r\nfair chance. An administration which has once obtained military control\r\ncan perpetuate itself indefinitely under constitutional forms until its\r\nopponents become sufficiently strong to overthrow it by force of arms.\r\n\r\nThe United States, therefore, can hardly assist one party in securing\r\nand holding the control of the government, without assuring itself that\r\nthe men whom it thus keeps in office are acceptable to the people under\r\ntheir rule, and that they administer the affairs of their country with\r\nat least a reasonable degree of honesty and efficiency. This can only\r\nbe done by establishing an administration which fairly represents the\r\nbest elements in the community. It should not be impossible to secure\r\nsuch an administration by an agreement between the party leaders,\r\nwho for all practical purposes represent the country in political\r\naffairs. Compromise between the various factions, which is the only\r\npracticable means, except revolution, of changing the higher officials,\r\nis the end towards which the diplomatic efforts of the United States\r\nshould be directed in cases where circumstances make a reorganization\r\nof the government inevitable. The more respectable and patriotic\r\nleaders of all parties would far prefer an adjustment of this kind to\r\na continuation of civil war, and even those who might be unwilling to\r\nsubordinate their own ambitions to the general welfare would probably\r\naccept it rather than incur the danger of armed intervention by the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe friendly mediation of the United States would do much to improve\r\nthe political conditions of the Isthmus if it were directed towards\r\nstrengthening the influence of the better element in the educated\r\nclass. Numerous intelligent and patriotic men of high political ideals\r\nare to be found in each country, but they have not hitherto had so\r\nlarge a share in the direction of affairs as they should because the\r\nrevolutions have brought to the front military leaders and demagogues\r\nrather than statesmen. Even where men of the highest character have\r\nbeen at the head of the government, as has not infrequently been the\r\ncase, they have found themselves forced to place corrupt or unworthy\r\nmen in office for political reasons, because they have been unable to\r\nfree themselves from dependence upon the support of the professional\r\npoliticians. With the greater stability in the government which will\r\nnecessarily result from the discouragement of revolutions, however,\r\nthe less turbulent elements should become more and more prominent,\r\nespecially if they are supported by the influence of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States can at the same time materially assist its Central\r\nAmerican neighbors by aiding them in securing new loans for the\r\nreorganization of their finances and the development of their natural\r\nresources. The unenviable record of Central American bonds makes it\r\nunlikely that any bankers, whether American or European, would lend\r\nmoney to one of the five republics, unless it were on the most onerous\r\nterms, without an effective guarantee of the protection of their\r\ngovernment in case of default. Considering the close relation between\r\nthe solvency of the countries of the Isthmus and the maintenance of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine, it is evident that the United States must eventually\r\nexert its good offices in cases where it has been impossible to reach\r\nan agreement with foreign creditors by any other means.\r\n\r\nIn Santo Domingo and Nicaragua, the service of loans made by American\r\nbankers has been guaranteed by placing the administration of the\r\ncustoms duties in the hands of officials appointed by or at least\r\napproved by the State Department. This is far from being an entirely\r\nsatisfactory solution of the problem. The collectorships thus far\r\nestablished have provided a highly satisfactory guarantee for the\r\nforeign creditors, and have decidedly increased the efficiency of the\r\ncustoms service, but their existence has been very distasteful and\r\nof doubtful advantage to the native community. Graft is abolished in\r\nthe customs houses themselves, but there is nothing to prevent that\r\nportion of the receipts which is not used for the service of the\r\nforeign debt from being misspent. Revolutions are not done away with,\r\nfor revolutionists fight, not, as is sometimes said, for the possession\r\nof the customs houses, but rather for the control of the appointing\r\npower and of the revenues, which the customs officials must necessarily\r\nturn over to them when they become the _de facto_ government. The\r\nchief result is the imposition upon the American government of a heavy\r\nburden of responsibility which forces it to intervene continually in\r\nthe internal affairs of the native governments, and which often leads\r\nto friction with the officials and to a feeling of dislike towards\r\nthe United States in the community at large. The acceptance of foreign\r\nfinancial control, moreover, inevitably involves a lessening of the\r\nsense of international responsibility and a certain loss of national\r\nself-respect which cannot but react unfavorably upon internal politics.\r\n\r\nIt may well be questioned whether the bondholders could not be\r\nsatisfactorily protected by other methods. If, for instance, the\r\nforeign loan were secured by the hypothecation of the customs revenues\r\nor of some other easily collected source of revenue, with a promise\r\nof the protection of the State Department in realizing the guarantee\r\nof the loan in case of default, the interests of the creditor would\r\nbe adequately protected, while the Central American governments, so\r\nlong as they dealt honestly by the bondholders, would be spared the\r\nhumiliation of having to place one of their principal functions in\r\nthe hands of a foreign official who was in no way subject to their\r\ncontrol. This is the basis upon which Costa Rica’s external debt rests\r\nat present, except that no foreign government participated officially\r\nin the arrangement. There would probably be little difficulty about\r\nmaintaining the service of the loan under such conditions. The majority\r\nof the Central American governments have shown little regard for\r\ntheir credit in times past, but they would probably manifest little\r\ninclination to default if their debts were reorganized on a fair basis,\r\nand if they were aware that a failure to pay would involve the seizure\r\nof their customs houses.\r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable that the United States should exercise a\r\nmeasure of control over the operations not only of American bankers\r\nbut of other American corporations which do business in the Isthmus.\r\nThe economic development of the last twenty-five years has created a\r\nsituation in which some of the five republics are almost powerless\r\nto protect themselves against the oppression and greed of foreign\r\ninterests, for corporations like the great fruit companies and\r\nthe railroad companies are able to bring to the support of their\r\nprojects financial resources which far exceed those of the local\r\ngovernment or of any group of natives. Some of these concerns, by the\r\ncorruption of officials or by the unscrupulous use of their control\r\nof transportation facilities, have obtained special privileges which\r\nhave been an obstacle to the legitimate business of other foreigners\r\nand to the development of the community as a whole. Moreover, serious\r\ninternational difficulties have not infrequently arisen when subsequent\r\ngovernments have attempted to annul or to modify these concessions.\r\nOnly a more careful supervision of the contracts entered into by\r\nAmerican concerns with native officials, who are not always above\r\ntemptation and who are in any event rarely in a position to ascertain\r\nthe financial responsibility of the concerns with which they are\r\ndealing or the ultimate effects of the privileges which are asked,\r\ncan insure the United States against the possibility of being forced\r\nto use its power to protect unscrupulous speculators and predatory\r\ncorporations in the exercise of rights which, even though legally\r\nacquired, are in many cases extremely unfair and injurious to the\r\ncountries which have granted them.\r\n\r\nThe same interests which have obtained inequitable concessions by\r\ndishonest methods have too often sought to secure influence with the\r\nnative governments by fomenting and assisting revolutions against\r\npresidents from whom they cannot obtain what they desire. In recent\r\nyears influences of this kind have done even more to cause internal\r\ndisorder in some of the republics than the intervention and intrigues\r\nof other Central American governments. Honduras has been the chief\r\nsufferer, for the numerous outbreaks which occurred in that Republic\r\nbetween 1907 and 1911 seem to have been financed in many cases by\r\ninterests in New Orleans, and to have received valuable assistance\r\nfrom the foreign colony on the North Coast. In Nicaragua also the\r\nindiscriminate granting of concessions on the one hand and the\r\ndissatisfaction among the foreign interests which were injured by\r\nthese grants of special privileges on the other was one of the primary\r\ncauses of the revolution of 1909-10. If permanent peace is ever to\r\nbe established in the Isthmus, the encouragement of revolutions from\r\noutside, whether it be for the satisfaction of the ambition or the\r\njealousy of petty despots in neighboring republics or for the pecuniary\r\nprofit of unprincipled foreigners, must be repressed by every possible\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nMuch can be done to promote stable government in Central America by the\r\nconsistent enforcement of the principles of the Washington conventions,\r\nfor few revolutions, except those which originate in genuine popular\r\ndiscontent with the existing regime, would attain formidable\r\nproportions if they were not allowed to use neutral territory as a\r\nbase and if they received no assistance from other Central American\r\ncountries or from friends in the United States. If the American\r\ngovernment exerts its influence to secure the observation of the 1907\r\ntreaties, and at the same time adopts effective means for restraining\r\nits own citizens from disturbing the peace of the Isthmus, the position\r\nof constituted governments throughout Central America will be greatly\r\nstrengthened. To be effective, such a policy must be vigorously\r\nenforced, and its one end,--to prevent revolutions and international\r\nwars in Central America,--should be pursued in such a way that there\r\ncan be no suspicion of selfish objects or ulterior political purposes.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the character and the ability of the men who are sent\r\nto represent the United States diplomatically in the Central American\r\ncapitals. Unless they are fitted for their positions by disposition\r\nand by training, their relations with the native governments can never\r\nbe entirely satisfactory. An acquaintance with the character of the\r\npeople and a command of Spanish are of the first importance, for\r\nCentral American political methods and the motives which govern the\r\naction of men and parties, incomprehensible at best to the average\r\nAmerican, are entirely beyond the understanding of one who does not\r\nspeak the language and is thus barred from association with any but\r\na very small portion of the people. The cordiality of our relations\r\nwith the republics of the Isthmus depends to a very great extent upon\r\nthe capacity of our agents to win the confidence and friendship of\r\ntheir people; and the extremely important position occupied by the\r\nUnited States minister in these countries, where he is forced to play\r\na part far more influential than that which falls to the lot of the\r\naverage diplomat, makes it an act of injustice to the Central American\r\ncountries themselves to send ministers who are not properly qualified\r\nfor their position.\r\n\r\nThe influence and authority of the United States in Central America\r\nare very great, for there are few educated men in the Isthmus who do\r\nnot realize that the future of their countries will be determined\r\nalmost entirely by their relations with their northern neighbor. The\r\npeople of the five republics have always admired our civilization\r\nand our institutions, and they have often turned to the American\r\ngovernment, not only for protection against European powers, but also\r\nfor aid in adjusting their domestic difficulties. They have bitterly\r\nresented the policy of the last five years, which they have regarded\r\nas a menace to their independence, but their hostility to American\r\nintervention would to a great extent disappear if they were convinced\r\nthat it was actuated by a desire to assist them and not by any purpose\r\nof expansion. Even those elements which are most jealously opposed to\r\nforeign control at present would not object so strongly to the exercise\r\nof foreign influence if they themselves profited by it, and most of the\r\nmore intelligent and patriotic political leaders avow that they would\r\nwelcome the assistance of the American government in securing peace\r\nand stability in the Isthmus and in bringing about the Central American\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nWhile their political and economic interests have become so closely\r\ninterdependent, cultural ties between the United States and Central\r\nAmerica have also grown far stronger in the last quarter century as a\r\nresult of the increasing prosperity of the coffee-producing countries\r\nand the improvement in means of communication. The wealthier families\r\nof the Isthmus travel more and more in the United States, and a very\r\nlarge proportion of them send their children to be educated in our\r\nschools and colleges. English has taken the place formerly held by\r\nFrench as the most widely spoken foreign language, and North American\r\nnews services and periodicals are the principal sources of information\r\non events occurring in the outside world. The creation of ties of this\r\nkind will have more influence than treaties and diplomatic conferences\r\nin determining whether our relations with Central America shall be\r\nfriendly and mutually profitable rather than characterized by dictation\r\nand compulsion on the one side and bitter resentment on the other.\r\n\r\nThe influence of North American civilization in the Isthmus, which is\r\ndaily becoming stronger under present conditions, could be greatly\r\nincreased if the missionary educational enterprise which has been so\r\nsuccessful in the Orient could be turned in some measure to these\r\ncountries at our own doors. The establishment by American philanthropic\r\nsocieties of institutions for higher education and for technical\r\ntraining in agriculture and engineering would perhaps do more than any\r\nother one factor could to improve both the economic and the political\r\nconditions of the Isthmus. Many of the governments have advanced far in\r\nthe primary instruction of their people, but they have been prevented\r\nfrom making corresponding progress in higher education by the expense\r\ninvolved and by the lack of properly trained teachers. There is no form\r\nof assistance which the people of the Isthmus would appreciate more,\r\nand which would do more to convince them of the friendly intentions of\r\ntheir great neighbor.\r\n\r\nThe political stability and the prosperity of the Central American\r\ncountries have been the one great object which the United States has\r\nsought in its relations with their governments. Modern conditions have\r\nmade the maintenance of peace and the development of commerce and\r\nnatural resources in the Isthmus far more important to the American\r\npeople than ever before. It is inevitable, therefore, that the United\r\nStates should exert a decided influence in the internal affairs of\r\nthe five republics, so long as disorder and insolvency expose them\r\nto aggression by European powers. But it should never be forgotten\r\nthat the ultimate purpose of the American policy is to enable the\r\ncountries of the Isthmus to attain a position where they can manage\r\ntheir own affairs without outside interference. Careless talk about\r\nthe ultimate absorption of these countries by the United States is as\r\nunwarranted as it is mischievous, for none of the measures thus far\r\ntaken in any Central American state have had as their object or their\r\nlogical outcome permanent political domination. If the efforts of our\r\ngovernment to assist its weaker neighbors are to attain any measure of\r\nsuccess, its sincerity and its freedom from any desire for territorial\r\nexpansion must be placed beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\nThe present political condition of the Isthmus is a transitory one,\r\nwhich is changing rapidly with the economic development of the\r\ncountry and the spread of education among the common people. If they\r\nare given a fair chance, the five republics will work out their own\r\nsalvation, but they will not be aided in doing so either by the\r\nestablishment of foreign protectorates over them or by the attempt of\r\na foreign government to impose upon their people responsibilities\r\nof self-government for which they are not as yet ready. The ultimate\r\nsolution of their political problems must be sought in making a reality\r\nthe democratic institutions which each of them already possesses on\r\npaper, by preparing their people for the intelligent exercise of the\r\nsuffrage. When the people are fitted to take an active part in choosing\r\ntheir own officials, as they already do in Costa Rica, and when they\r\nhave learned the respect for the constitution and for the will of\r\nthe majority which can only come with experience in self-government,\r\nthere will be no need for foreign intervention to protect life and\r\nproperty from destruction at the hands of revolutionary armies. To aid\r\nin bringing that time nearer should be one of the primary aims of the\r\nforeign policy of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] “The Treaties and Conventions of Washington of 1907, ... were\r\nconceived, debated, and concluded through the friendly intervention of\r\nthe Government of the United States of America.
