The question is a difficult and complicated\r\none, and though I am a strong Tariff Reformer myself I hope I am not\r\nincapable of seeing both sides of the case. I certainly should have\r\nreason to be ashamed if I could not be fair to those whom, for the\r\nsake of brevity and convenience, I will call Free Traders, though I do\r\nnot altogether admit the correctness of that designation. My views\r\nwere once the same as theirs, and though I long ago felt constrained\r\nto modify them, and had become a Tariff Reformer some years before the\r\nsubject attained its present prominence in public discussion, it would\r\nill become me to treat as foolish arguments which I once found so\r\nconvincing or to vilify opinions which I once honestly shared.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened to me is what I expect has happened to a good many\r\npeople. I still admire the great Free Trade writers, the force of\r\ntheir intellect, the lucidity of their arguments. There can be no\r\nclearer proof of the spell which they exercised over the minds of\r\ntheir countrymen than the fact that so many leading public men on both\r\nsides of politics remain their disciples to this very day. But for my\r\nown part I have been unable to resist the evidence of facts which\r\nshows me clearly that in the actual world of trade and industry things\r\ndo not work out even approximately as they ought to work out if the\r\nFree Trade theory were the counsel of perfection which I once thought\r\nit. And that has led me to question the theory itself, and so\r\nquestioned it now seems to me far from a correct statement of the\r\ntruth, even from the point of view of abstract inquiry. But I am not\r\nhere to engage in abstract arguments. What I want to do is to look at\r\nthe question from a strictly practical point of view, but at the same\r\ntime a very broad one. I am anxious to bring home to you the place of\r\nTariff Reform in a sound national policy, for, indeed, it seems to me\r\nvery difficult to construct such a policy without a complete revision\r\nof our fiscal arrangements. Now a sound national policy has two\r\naspects. There are two great objects of practical patriotism, two\r\nheads under which you may sum it up, much as the Church Catechism sums\r\nup practical religion, under the heads of \"duty to God\" and \"duty to\r\nyour neighbour.\" These objects are the strength of the Empire, and the\r\nhealth, the well-being, the contentedness of the mass of the people,\r\nresting as they always must on steady, properly organised, and fairly\r\nremunerated labour. Remember always, these two things are one; they\r\nare inseparable. There can be no adequate prosperity for the forty or\r\nfifty million people in these islands without the Empire and all that\r\nit provides; there can be no enduring Empire without a healthy,\r\nthriving, manly people at the centre. Stunted, overcrowded town\r\npopulations, irregular employment, sweated industries, these things\r\nare as detestable to true Imperialism as they are to philanthropy,\r\nand they are detestable to the Tariff Reformer. His aim is to improve\r\nthe condition of the people at home, and to improve it concurrently\r\nwith strengthening the foundations of the Empire. Mind you, I do not\r\nsay that Tariff Reform alone is going to do all this. I make no such\r\npreposterous claim for it. What I do say is that it fits in better\r\nalike with a policy of social reform at home and with a policy\r\ndirected to the consolidation of the Empire than our existing fiscal\r\nsystem does.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the essential difference between Tariff Reformers and the\r\nadvocates of the present system? I must dwell on this even at the risk\r\nof appearing tiresome, because there is so much misunderstanding on\r\nthe subject. In the eyes of the advocates of the present system, the\r\nstatesman, or at any rate the British statesman, when he approaches\r\nfiscal policy, is confronted with the choice of Hercules. He is\r\nplaced, like the rider in the old legend, between the black and the\r\nwhite horseman. On the one hand is an angel of light called Free\r\nTrade; on the other a limb of Satan called Protection. The one is\r\nentirely and always right; the other is entirely and always wrong.\r\nAll fiscal wisdom is summed up in clinging desperately to the one and\r\neschewing like sin anything that has the slightest flavour of the\r\nother. Now, that view has certainly the merit of simplicity, and\r\nsimplicity is a very great thing; but, if we look at history, it does\r\nnot seem quite to bear out this simple view. This country became one\r\nof the greatest and wealthiest in the world under a system of rigid\r\nProtection. It has enjoyed great, though by no means unbroken,\r\nprosperity under Free Trade. Side by side with that system of ours\r\nother countries have prospered even more under quite different\r\nsystems. These facts alone are sufficient to justify the critical\r\nspirit, which is the spirit of the Tariff Reformer. He does not\r\nbelieve in any absolute right or wrong in such a matter as the\r\nimposition of duties upon imports. Such duties cannot, he thinks, be\r\njudged by one single test, namely, whether they do or do not favour\r\nthe home producer, and be condemned out of hand if they do favour him.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Reformer rejects this single cast-iron principle. He\r\nrefuses to bow down before it, regardless of changing circumstances,\r\nregardless of the policy of other countries and of that of the other\r\nDominions of the Crown. He wants a free hand in dealing with imports,\r\nthe power to adapt the fiscal policy of this country to the varying\r\nconditions of trade and to the situation created at any given time by\r\nthe fiscal action of others. He has no superstitious objection to\r\nusing duties either to increase employment at home or to secure\r\nmarkets abroad. But on the other hand he does not go blindly for\r\nduties upon foreign imports as so-called Free Traders go blindly\r\nagainst them, except in the case of articles not produced in this\r\ncountry, some of which the Free Traders are obliged to tax\r\npreposterously. Tariff Reform is not one-ideaed, rigid, inelastic, as\r\nour existing system is. Many people are afraid of it, because they\r\nthink Tariff Reformers want to put duties on foreign goods for the fun\r\nof the thing, merely for the sake of making them dearer. Certainly\r\nTariff Reformers do not think that cheapness is everything. Certainly\r\nthey hold that the blind worship of immediate cheapness may cost the\r\nnation dear in the long run. But, unless cheapness is due to some\r\nmischievous cause, they are just as anxious that we should buy cheaply\r\nas the most ardent Cobdenite, and especially that we should buy\r\ncheaply what we cannot produce ourselves. Talking of cheapness,\r\nhowever, I must make a confession which I hope will not be\r\nmisunderstood by ladies present who are fond of shopping--I wish we\r\ncould get out of the way of discussing national economics so much from\r\nthe shopping point of view. Surely what matters, from the point of\r\nview of the general well-being, is the productive capacity of the\r\npeople, and the actual amount of their production of articles of\r\nnecessity, use, or beauty. Everything we consume might be cheaper, and\r\nyet if the total amount of things which were ours to consume was less\r\nwe should be not richer but poorer. It is, I think, one of the first\r\nduties of Tariff Reformers to keep people's eyes fixed upon this vital\r\npoint--the amount of our national production. It is that which\r\nconstitutes the real income of the nation, on which wages and profits\r\nalike depend.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to another point. Production in this country is\r\ndependent on importation, more dependent than in most countries. We\r\nare not self-supplying. We must import from outside these islands vast\r\nquantities of raw materials and of the necessaries of life. That, at\r\nleast, is common ground between the Free Trader and the Tariff\r\nReformer. But the lessons they draw from the fact are somewhat\r\ndifferent. The Free Trader is only anxious that we should buy all\r\nthese necessary imports as cheaply as possible. The Tariff Reformer is\r\nalso anxious that we should buy them cheaply, but he is even more\r\nanxious to know how we are going to pay for all this vast quantity of\r\nthings which we are bound to import. And that leads him to two\r\nconclusions. The first is that, seeing how much we are obliged to buy\r\nfrom abroad in any case, he looks rather askance at our increasing our\r\nindebtedness by buying things which we could quite easily produce at\r\nhome, especially with so many unemployed and half-employed people. The\r\nother, and this is even a more pressing solicitude to him, is that it\r\nis of vital importance to us to look after our external markets, to\r\nmake sure that we shall always have customers, and good customers, to\r\nbuy our goods, and so to enable us to pay for our indispensable\r\nimports. The Free Trader does not share this solicitude. He has got a\r\ncomfortable theory that if you only look after your imports your\r\nexports will look after themselves. Will they? The Tariff Reformer\r\ndoes not agree with that at all. Imports no doubt are paid for by\r\nexports, but it does not in the least follow that by increasing your\r\ndependence on others you will necessarily increase their dependence on\r\nyou. It would be much truer to say: \"Look after the exports and the\r\nimports will look after themselves.\" The more you sell the more you\r\nwill be able to buy, but it does not in the least follow that the more\r\nyou buy the more you will be able to sell. What business man would go\r\non the principle of buying as much as possible and say: \"Oh, that is\r\nall right. I am sure to be able to sell enough to pay for it.\" The\r\nfirst thought of a wise business man is for his markets, and you as a\r\ngreat trading nation are bound to think of your markets, not only your\r\nmarkets of to-day but of to-morrow and the day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Free Trade theory was the birth of a time when our imports were\r\npractically all supplemental to our exports, all indispensable to us,\r\nand when, on the other hand, the whole of the world was in need of our\r\ngoods, far beyond our power of supplying it. Since then the situation\r\nhas wholly altered. At this actual moment, it is true, there is\r\ntemporarily a state of things which in one respect reproduces the\r\nsituation of fifty years ago. There is for the moment an almost\r\nunlimited demand for some of our goods abroad. But that is not the\r\nnormal situation. The normal situation is that there is an increasing\r\ninvasion of our markets by goods from abroad which we used to produce\r\nourselves, and an increasing tendency to exclude our goods from\r\nforeign markets. The Tariff Reform movement is the inevitable result\r\nof these altered circumstances. There is nothing artificial about it.\r\nIt is not, as some people think, the work of a single man, however\r\nmuch it may owe to his genius and his courage, however much it may\r\nsuffer, with other good causes, through his enforced retirement from\r\nthe field. It is not an eccentric idea of Mr. Chamberlain's. Sooner or\r\nlater it was bound to come in any case. It is the common sense and\r\nexperience of the people waking up to the altered state of affairs,\r\nbeginning to shake itself free from a theory which no longer fits the\r\nfacts. It is a movement of emancipation, a twofold struggle for\r\nfreedom--in the sphere of economic theory, for freedom of thought, in\r\nthe sphere of fiscal policy, for freedom of action.\r\n\r\nAnd that freedom of action is needed quickly. It is needed now. I am\r\nnot doubtful of the ultimate triumph of Tariff Reform. Sooner or\r\nlater, I believe, it is sure to achieve general recognition. What does\r\ndistress me is the thought of the opportunities we are losing in the\r\nmeantime. This year has been marked, disastrously marked, in our\r\nannals by the emphatic and deliberate rejection on the part of our\r\nGovernment of the great principle of Preferential Trade within the\r\nEmpire. All the other self-governing States are in favour of it. The\r\nUnited Kingdom alone blocks the way. What does that mean? What is it\r\nthat we risk losing as long as we refuse to accept the principle of\r\nPreferential Trade, and will certainly lose in the long run if we\r\npersist in that refusal? It is a position of permanent and assured\r\nadvantage in some of the greatest and most growing markets in the\r\nworld. Preference to British goods in the British dominions beyond the\r\nsea would be a constant and potent influence tending to induce the\r\npeople of those countries to buy what they require to buy outside\r\ntheir own borders from us rather than from our rivals. It means beyond\r\nall doubt and question so much more work for British hands. And the\r\npeople of those countries are anxious that British hands should get\r\nit. They have, if I may so express myself, a family feeling, which\r\nmakes them wish to keep the business within the family. But business\r\nis business. They are willing to give us the first chance. But if we\r\nwill give nothing in return, if we tell them to mind their own\r\nbusiness and not to bother us with offers of mutual concessions, it is\r\nonly a question of time, and the same chance will be given to others,\r\nwho will not refuse to avail themselves of it.\r\n\r\nYou see the beginning of the process already in such an event as the\r\nnewly-concluded commercial treaty between Canada and France. If we\r\nchoose, it is still possible for us not only to secure the preference\r\nwe have in Colonial markets, but to increase it. But if we do nothing,\r\ncommercial arrangements with other nations who are more far-sighted\r\nwill gradually whittle that preference away. To my mind the action of\r\nCanada in the matter of that treaty, perfectly legitimate and natural\r\nthough it be, is much more ominous and full of warning to us than the\r\nnew Australian Tariff, about which such an unjustifiable outcry has\r\nbeen made. Rates of duty can be lowered as easily as they can be\r\nraised, but the principle of preference once abandoned would be very\r\ndifficult to revive. I am sorry that the Australians have found it\r\nnecessary in their own interests to raise their duties, but I would\r\nrather see any of the British Dominions raise its duties and still\r\ngive a preference to British goods than lower its duties and take away\r\nthat preference. Whatever duties may be imposed by Canada, Australia,\r\nor the other British Dominions, they will still remain great\r\nimporters, and with the vast expansion in front of them their imports\r\nare bound to increase. They will still be excellent customers, and the\r\npoint is that they should be our customers.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Australia the actual extent of the preference accorded\r\nto British goods under the new tariff is not, as has been represented,\r\nof small value to us. It is of considerable value. But what is of far\r\nmore importance is the fact that Australia continues to adhere to the\r\nprinciple of Preference. Moreover, Australia, following the example of\r\nCanada, has established an extensive free list for the benefit of this\r\ncountry. Let nobody say after this that Australia shows no family\r\nfeeling. I for one am grateful to Australia, and I am grateful to that\r\ngreat Australian statesman, Mr. Deakin, for the way in which, in the\r\nteeth of discouragement from us, he has still persisted in making the\r\nprinciple of preferential trade within the Empire an essential feature\r\nof the Australian Tariff.\r\n\r\nPreference is vital to the future growth of British trade, but it is\r\nnot only trade which is affected by it. The idea which lies at the\r\nroot of it is that the scattered communities, which all own\r\nallegiance to the British Crown, should regard and treat one another\r\nnot as strangers but as kinsmen, that, while each thinks first of its\r\nown interests, it should think next of the interests of the family,\r\nand of the rest of the world only after the family. That idea is the\r\nvery corner-stone of Imperial unity. To my mind any weakening of that\r\nidea, any practical departure from it, would be an incalculable loss\r\nto all of us. I should regard a readjustment of our own Customs duties\r\nwith the object of maintaining that idea, even if such readjustment\r\nwere of some immediate expense to ourselves, as I hope to show you\r\nthat it would not be, as a most trifling and inconsiderable price to\r\npay for a prize of infinite value. I am the last man to contend that\r\npreferential trade alone is a sufficient bond of Empire. But I do\r\ncontend that the maintenance or creation of other bonds becomes very\r\ndifficult, if in the vitally important sphere of commerce we are to\r\nmake no distinction between our fellow-citizens across the seas and\r\nforeigners. Closer trade relations involve closer relations in all\r\nother respects. An advantage, even a slight advantage, to Colonial\r\nimports in the great British market would tend to the development of\r\nthe Colonies as compared with the foreign nations who compete with\r\nthem. But the development of the British communities across the seas\r\nis of more value to us than an equivalent development of foreign\r\ncountries. It is of more value to our trade, for, if there is one\r\nthing absolutely indisputable, it is that these communities buy ever\r\nso much more of us per head than foreign nations do. But it is not\r\nonly a question of trade; it is a question of the future of our\r\npeople. By encouraging the development of the British Dominions beyond\r\nthe seas we direct emigration to them in preference to foreign lands.\r\nWe keep our people under the flag instead of scattering them all over\r\nthe world. We multiply not merely our best customers but our fellow\r\ncitizens, our only sure and constant friends.\r\n\r\nAnd now is there nothing we can do to help forward this great object?\r\nIs it really the case, as the Free Traders contend, that in order to\r\nmeet the advances of the other British States and to give, as the\r\nsaying is, Preference for Preference, we should be obliged to make\r\nexcessive sacrifices, and to place intolerable burdens on the people\r\nof this country? I believe that this is an absolute delusion. I\r\nbelieve that, if only we could shake off the fetters of a narrow and\r\npedantic theory, and freely reshape our own system of import duties on\r\nprinciples of obvious common sense, we should be able at one and the\r\nsame time to promote trade within the Empire, to strengthen our hands\r\nin commercial negotiations with foreign countries, and to render tardy\r\njustice to our home industries.\r\n\r\nThe Free Trader goes on the principle of placing duties on a very few\r\narticles only, articles, generally, of universal consumption, and of\r\nmaking those duties very high ones. Moreover, with the exception of\r\nalcohol, these articles are all things which we cannot produce\r\nourselves. I do not say that the system has not some merits. It is\r\neasy to work, and the cost of collection is moderate. But it has also\r\ngreat defects. The system is inelastic, for the duties being so few\r\nand so heavy it is difficult to raise them in case of emergency\r\nwithout checking consumption. Moreover, the burden of the duties\r\nfalls entirely on the people of this country, for the foreign\r\nimporter, except in the case of alcoholic liquors, has no home\r\nproducer to compete with, and so he simply adds the whole of the duty\r\nto the price of the article. Last, but not least, the burden is\r\ninequitably distributed. It would be infinitely fairer, as between\r\ndifferent classes of consumers, to put a moderate duty on a large\r\nnumber of articles than to put an enormous duty on two or three. But\r\nfrom that fairer and more reasonable system we are at present debarred\r\nby our pedantic adhesion to the rule that no duty may be put on\r\nimported articles unless an equivalent duty is put on articles of the\r\nsame kind produced at home. Why, you may well ask, should we be bound\r\nby any such rule? I will tell you. It is because, unless we imposed\r\nsuch an equivalent duty, we should be favouring the British producer,\r\nand because under our present system every other consideration has got\r\nto give way to this supreme law, the \"categorical imperative\" of the\r\nFree Trader, that we must not do anything which could by any\r\npossibility in the remotest degree benefit the British producer in\r\nhis competition with the foreigner in our home market. It is from the\r\nobsession of this doctrine that the Tariff Reformer wishes to liberate\r\nour fiscal policy. He approaches this question free from any doctrinal\r\nprepossessions whatever. Granted that a certain number of millions\r\nhave to be raised by Customs duties, he sees before him some five to\r\nsix hundred millions of foreign imports on which to raise them, and so\r\nhis first and very natural reflection is, that by distributing duties\r\npretty equally over this vast mass of imported commodities he could\r\nraise a very large revenue without greatly enhancing the price of\r\nanything. Our present system throws away, so to speak, the advantage\r\nof our vast and varied importation by electing to place the burden of\r\nduties entirely on very few articles. As against this system the\r\nTariff Reformer favours the principle of a widespread tariff, of\r\nmaking all foreign imports pay, but pay moderately, and he holds that\r\nit is no more than justice to the British producer that all articles\r\nbrought to the British market should contribute to the cost of\r\nkeeping it up. It is no answer to say that it is the British consumer\r\nwho would pay the duty, for even if this were invariably true, which\r\nit is not, it leaves unaffected the question of fair play between the\r\nBritish producer and the foreign producer. The price of the home-made\r\narticle is enhanced by the taxes which fall upon the home makers, and\r\nwhich are largely devoted to keeping up our great open market, but the\r\nprice of the foreign article is not so enhanced, though it has the\r\nfull benefit of the open market all the same. Moreover, the price of\r\nthe home-made article is also enhanced by the many restrictions which\r\nwe place, and rightly place, on home manufacture in the interests of\r\nthe workers--restrictions as to hours, methods of working, sanitary\r\nconditions, and so forth--all excellent, all laudable, but expensive,\r\nand from which the foreign maker is often absolutely, and always\r\ncomparatively, free. The Tariff Reformer is all for the open market,\r\nbut he is for fair play as between those who compete in it, and he\r\nholds that even cheapness ought not to be sought at the expense of\r\nunfairness to the British producer.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that the Tariff Reformer starts with the idea of a\r\nmoderate all-round tariff. But he is not going to ride his principle\r\nto death. He is essentially practical. There are some existing duties,\r\nlike those on alcoholic liquors, the high rate of which is justified\r\nfor other than fiscal reasons. He sees no reason to lower these\r\nduties. On the other hand, there are some articles, such as raw\r\ncotton, which compete with no British produce, and even a slight\r\nenhancement of the price of which might materially injure our export\r\ntrade. The Tariff Reformer would place these on a free list, for he\r\nfeels that, however strong may be the argument for moderate all-round\r\nduties as a guiding rule, it is necessary to admit exceptions even to\r\nthe best of rules, and it is part of his creed that we are bound to\r\nstudy the actual effect of particular duties both upon ourselves and\r\nupon others. No doubt that means hard work, an intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the details of our industry and trade, an eye upon the\r\nproceedings of foreign countries. A modern tariff, if it is to be\r\nreally suitable to the requirements of the nation adopting it, must be\r\nthe work of experts. But is that any argument against it? Are we less\r\ncompetent to make a thorough study of these questions than other\r\npeople, as for instance the Germans, or are we too lazy? Free Traders\r\nmake fun of a scientific tariff, but why should science be excluded\r\nfrom the domain of fiscal policy, especially when the necessity of it\r\nis so vigorously and so justly impressed upon us in every other field?\r\nIt is not only the War Office which has got to get rid of antiquated\r\nprejudices and to open its eyes to what is going on in the world. Our\r\nfinancial departments might reasonably be asked to do the same, and\r\nthey are quite equally capable, and I have no doubt equally willing,\r\nto respond to such an appeal, instead of leaving the most thorough,\r\nthe most comprehensive, and the most valuable inquiry into the effects\r\nof import duties, which has ever been made in this country, to a\r\nprivate agency like the Tariff Commission.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is necessary for me to point out how a widespread\r\ntariff, besides those other advantages which I have indicated, would\r\nstrengthen our hands in commercial policy. In the first place, it\r\nwould at once enable us to meet the advances of the other States of\r\nthe Empire, and to make the British Empire in its commercial aspect a\r\npermanent reality. To do this it would not be necessary, nor do I\r\nthink it would be right, to exempt goods from the British Dominions\r\nentirely from the duties to which similar goods coming from foreign\r\nlands are subject. Our purpose would be equally well served by doing\r\nwhat the Colonies do, and having two scales of duty, a lower one for\r\nthe products of all British States and Dependencies, a higher one for\r\nthose of the outside world. The amount of this preference would be a\r\nmatter of bargain to be settled by some future Imperial Conference,\r\nnot foredoomed to failure, and preceded by careful preliminary\r\ninvestigation and negotiations. It might be twenty-five, or\r\nthirty-three, or even fifty per cent. And whatever it was, I think we\r\nshould reserve the right also to give a preference, but never of the\r\nsame amount, to any foreign country which was willing to give us some\r\nsubstantial equivalent. It need not be a general preference; it might\r\nbe the removal or reduction of some particular duties. I may say I do\r\nnot myself like the idea of engaging in tariff wars. I do not believe\r\nin prohibitive or penal tariffs. But I do believe in having something\r\nto give to those who treat us well, something to withhold from those\r\nwho treat us badly. At present, as you are well aware, Great Britain\r\nis the one great nation which is treated with absolute disregard by\r\nforeign countries in framing their tariffs. They know that however\r\nbadly they treat us they have nothing to lose by it, and so we go to\r\nthe wall on every occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, though there is a great deal more to be said, I feel I must\r\nnot trespass much further on your patience. But there is one objection\r\nto Tariff Reform which is constantly made, and which is at once so\r\nuntrue and so damaging, that before sitting down I should like to say\r\na few words about it. We are told that this is an attempt to transfer\r\nthe burden of a part of our taxation from the shoulders of the rich to\r\nthose of the poor. If that were true, it would be fatal to Tariff\r\nReform, and I for one would have nothing to do with it. But it is not\r\ntrue. There is no proposal to reduce and I believe there is no\r\npossibility of reducing, the burden which at present falls on the\r\nshoulders of the upper and middle classes in the shape of direct\r\ntaxation. On the other hand, I do not believe there is much room for\r\nincreasing it--though I think it can be increased in one or two\r\ndirections--without consequences which the poorer classes would be the\r\nfirst to feel. Excise duties, which are mainly paid by those classes,\r\nare already about as high as they can be. It follows that for any\r\nincrease of revenue, beyond the ordinary growth arising from increase\r\nof wealth and population, you must look, at least to a great extent,\r\nto Customs duties. And the tendency of the time is towards increased\r\nexpenditure, all of it, mind you--and I do not complain of the\r\nfact--due to the effort to improve the condition of the mass of the\r\npeople. It is thus no question of shifting existing burdens, it is a\r\nquestion of distributing the burden of new expenditure of which the\r\nmass of the people will derive the benefit. And if that new\r\nexpenditure must, as I think I have shown, be met, at least in large\r\npart, by Customs duties, which method of raising these duties is more\r\nin the interest of the poorer classes--our present system, which\r\nenhances enormously the price of a few articles of universal\r\nconsumption like tea and sugar and tobacco, or a tariff spread over a\r\nmuch greater number of articles at a much lower rate? Beyond all doubt\r\nor question the mass of the people would be better off under the\r\nlatter system. Even assuming--as I will for the sake of argument,\r\nthough I do not admit it--that the British consumer pays the whole of\r\nthe duty on imported foreign goods competing with British goods, is it\r\nnot evident that the poorer classes of the community would pay a\r\nsmaller proportion of Customs duties under a tariff which included a\r\ngreat number of foreign manufactured articles, at present entirely\r\nfree, and largely the luxuries of the rich, than they do, when Customs\r\nduties are restricted to a few articles of universal consumption?\r\n\r\nAnd that is at the same time the answer to the misleading, and often\r\ndishonest, outcry about \"taxing the food of the people,\" about the big\r\nloaf and little loaf, and all the rest of it. The construction of a\r\nsensible all-round tariff presents many difficulties, but there is\r\none difficulty which it does not present, and that is the difficulty\r\nof so adjusting your duties that the total proportion of them falling\r\nupon the wage-earning classes shall not be increased. I for one regard\r\nsuch an adjustment as a postulate in any scheme of Tariff Reform. And\r\njust one other argument--and I recommend it especially to those\r\nworking-class leaders who are so vehement in their denunciation of\r\nTariff Reform. Is it of no importance to the people whom they\r\nespecially claim to represent that our fiscal policy should lean so\r\nheavily in favour of the foreign and against the British producer? If\r\nthey regard that as a matter of indifference, I think they will come\r\nto find in time that the mass of the working classes do not agree with\r\nthem. But be that as it may, it is certain that I, for one, do not\r\nadvocate Tariff Reform in the interests of the rich, but in the\r\ninterests of the whole nation, and therefore necessarily of the\r\nworking classes, who are the majority of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY\r\n\r\nGuildford, October 29, 1907\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very sensible of the honour of being called on to reply for the\r\nUnionist cause, but I approach the task with some diffidence, not to\r\nsay trepidation. I feel very conscious that I am not a very good\r\nspecimen of a party man. It is not that I do not hold strong opinions\r\non many public questions--in fact, that is the very trouble. My\r\nopinions are too strong to fit well into any recognised programme. I\r\nsuffer from an inveterate habit, which is partly congenital, but which\r\nhas been developed by years spent in the service of the Crown, of\r\nlooking at public questions from other than party points of view. And\r\nI am too old to unlearn it.\r\n\r\nFor a man so constituted there is evidently only a limited _rôle_ in\r\npolitical life. But he may have his uses all the same, if you take\r\nhim for what he is, and not for what he is not, and does not pretend\r\nto be. If he does not speak with the weight and authority of a party\r\nleader, he is at least free from the embarrassments by which a party\r\nleader is beset, and unhampered by the caution which a party leader is\r\nbound to exercise. He commits nobody but himself, and therefore he can\r\nafford to speak with a bluntness which is denied to those whose\r\nutterances commit many thousands of other people. And I am not sure\r\nwhether the present moment is not one at which the unconventional\r\ntreatment of public questions may not be specially useful, so, whether\r\nit be as an independent Unionist or as a friendly outsider--in\r\nwhichever light you like to regard me--I venture to contribute my mite\r\nto the discussion.\r\n\r\nHaving now made my position clear, I will at once plunge _in medias\r\nres_ with a few artless observations. You hear all this grumbling\r\nwhich is going on just now against the Unionist leader. Well,\r\ngentlemen, a party which is in low water always does grumble at its\r\nleader. I have known this sort of thing happen over and over again in\r\nmy own lifetime. And the consequence is, it is all like water on a\r\nduck's back to me; it makes no impression on me whatsoever. I remember\r\nas long back as the late sixties and early seventies the Conservative\r\nparty were ceaselessly grumbling at Lord Beaconsfield, then Mr.\r\nDisraeli, right up to his greatest victory and the commencement of his\r\nlongest tenure of power--almost up to the moment when he became the\r\npermanent idol of the Conservative party. I remember how the Liberals\r\ngrumbled at Mr. Gladstone from 1873 and 1874 almost up to the opening\r\nof the Midlothian campaign. Again, I remember how the Conservatives\r\ngrumbled at Lord Salisbury from the first moment of his accession to\r\nthe leadership right up to 1885. I can recall as well as if it were\r\nyesterday a young Tory friend of mine--he has become a distinguished\r\nman since, and I am not going to give him away--telling me, who was at\r\nthat time a Liberal, in the year of grace 1883 or 1884, that it was\r\nabsolutely hopeless for the Tory party ever to expect to come back\r\ninto power with such a leader as Lord Salisbury. He called him a\r\n\"Professor.\" He said, \"No doubt he is a very able man and an excellent\r\nspeaker, but he is a man of science. He has no popular gifts whatever.\r\nThere is not a ghost of a chance of a Conservative victory so long as\r\nhe is in command.\" Yet that was not more than two years before Lord\r\nSalisbury commenced a series of Premierships which kept him, for some\r\nthirteen and a half years out of seventeen, at the helm of the State.\r\n\r\nWith all these experiences to look back upon it is really impossible\r\nfor me to be much affected by the passing wave of dissatisfaction with\r\nMr. Balfour. Men of first-rate ability and character are rare. Still\r\nrarer are men who, having those qualities, also have the knack of\r\ncompelling the attention and respect even of a hostile House of\r\nCommons. When a party possesses a leader with all these gifts, it is\r\nnot likely to change him in a hurry.\r\n\r\nBut if I refuse to take a gloomy view of the Unionist leadership, I\r\nmust admit that I am not altogether an optimist about the immediate\r\nprospects of Unionism. There is no doubt a bright side to the picture\r\nas well as a less encouraging one. The bright side, from the party\r\npoint of view, is afforded by the hopeless chaos of opinion in the\r\nranks of our opponents--by the total absence of any clear conviction\r\nor definite line whatever in the counsels of the Government, which\r\ncauses Ministers to dash wildly from measure to measure in\r\nendeavouring to satisfy first one section and then another section of\r\ntheir motley following, and which prevents them from ever giving\r\nreally adequate attention to any one of their proposals.\r\n\r\nI am not speaking of Ministers individually. Granted that some of them\r\nhave done excellent work at the heads of their several departments--I\r\nthink it would not be fair to deny that. I am thinking of their\r\ncollective policy, and especially of their legislative efforts. For\r\nmonuments of clumsy opportunism, commend me to the legislative\r\nfailures, and, for the matter of that, to most of the legislative\r\nachievements, of the last two years.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. Unionists cannot complain of what the Government is\r\ndoing for them. And on the negative side of policy--in their duty as\r\na mere Opposition--their course is clear. It is a fundamental article\r\nof their faith to maintain the authority of the Imperial Parliament in\r\nIreland. But that authority can be set aside by the toleration of\r\nlawlessness just as much, and in a worse way, than by the repeal of\r\nthe Union. And such toleration is the rule to-day. There may be no\r\nviolent crime, but there is open and widespread defiance of the law\r\nand interference with the elementary rights of law-abiding people. It\r\nis a demoralising state of affairs, and one to which no good citizen\r\nin any part of the United Kingdom, however little he may be personally\r\naffected by it, can afford to be indifferent. Once let it be granted\r\nthat any popular movement, which is not strong enough to obtain an\r\nalteration of the law by regular means, can simply set the law aside\r\nin practice, and you are at the beginning of general anarchy.\r\n\r\nUnionists have to fight for a restoration of the respect for law in\r\nIreland in the interest of the whole kingdom. And they may have to\r\nfight also, it appears, against the abrogation of our existing\r\nconstitution in favour of a system of quinquennial dictatorships. For\r\nthat and nothing else is involved in the proposal to reduce the House\r\nof Lords to impotence and put nothing in its place. I am not concerned\r\nto represent the present constitution of the House of Lords as\r\nperfect. I have always been of opinion that a more representative and\r\ntherefore a stronger second chamber was desirable. But that we can\r\nafford to do without any check on the House of Commons, especially\r\nsince the removal of all checks upon the power of those who from time\r\nto time control the House of Commons to rush through any measures they\r\nplease without the possibility of an appeal to the people--that is a\r\nproposition which no man with any knowledge of history or any respect\r\nfor constitutional government can possibly defend. To resist such a\r\nproposal as that is not fighting for a party; it is not fighting for a\r\nclass. It is fighting for the stability of society, for the\r\nfundamental rights of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that on the negative side, in the things it is called\r\nupon to resist, the Unionist party is strong and fortunate. But are we\r\nto be content with that? Should we not all like to feel that we\r\nappealed for the confidence of the people on the merits of our own\r\npolicy, and not merely on the demerits of our opponents? That, I take\r\nit, is the feeling at the bottom of what men are saying on all hands\r\njust now--that the Unionist party ought to have a constructive policy.\r\nNow, if by a constructive policy is meant a string of promises, a sort\r\nof Newcastle programme, then I can well imagine any wise statesmen,\r\nespecially if they happened to be in Opposition, thinking twice before\r\nthey committed themselves to it. But if by a constructive policy is\r\nmeant a definite set of principles, a clear attitude to the questions\r\nwhich most agitate the public mind, a sympathetic grasp of popular\r\nneeds, and a readiness to indicate the extent to which, and the lines\r\non which, you think it possible and desirable to satisfy them--then I\r\nagree that the Unionist party ought to have such a policy. And I\r\nventure to say that, if it has such a policy, the fact is not yet\r\nsufficiently apparent to the popular mind, or, perhaps, I should say,\r\nspeaking as one of the populace, to my mind.\r\n\r\nMany people think that it is sufficient for the purpose--that it is\r\npossible to conduct a victorious campaign with the single watchword\r\n\"Down with Socialism.\" Well, I am not fond of mere negatives. I do not\r\nlike fighting an abstract noun. My objection to anti-Socialism as a\r\nplatform is that Socialism means so many different things. On this\r\npoint I agree with Mr. Asquith. I will wait to denounce Socialism till\r\nI see what form it takes. Sometimes it is synonymous with robbery, and\r\nto robbery, open or veiled, boldly stalking in the face of day or\r\nhiding itself under specious phrases, Unionists are, as a matter of\r\ncourse, opposed. But mere fidelity to the eighth Commandment is not a\r\nconstructive policy, and Socialism is not necessarily synonymous with\r\nrobbery. Correctly used, the word only signifies a particular view of\r\nthe proper relation of the State to its citizens--a tendency to\r\nsubstitute public for private ownership, or to restrict the freedom of\r\nindividual enterprise in the interests of the public. But there are\r\nsome forms of property which we all admit should be public and not\r\nprivate, and the freedom of individual enterprise is already limited\r\nby a hundred laws. Socialism and Individualism are opposing\r\nprinciples, which enter in various proportions into the constitution\r\nof every civilised society; it is merely a question of degree. One\r\ncommunity is more Socialistic than another. The same community is more\r\nSocialistic at one time than at another. This country is far more\r\nSocialistic than it was fifty years ago, and for most of the changes\r\nin that direction the Unionist and the Tory party are responsible. The\r\nFactory Acts are one instance; free education is another. The danger,\r\nas it seems to me, of the Unionist party going off on a crusade\r\nagainst Socialism is that in the heat of that crusade it may neglect,\r\nor appear to neglect, those social evils of which honest Socialism is\r\nstriving, often, no doubt, by unwise means, to effect a cure. If the\r\nUnionist party did that, it would be unfaithful to its own best\r\ntraditions from the days of \"Sybil\" and \"Coningsby\" to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe true antidote to revolutionary Socialism is practical social\r\nreform. That is no claptrap phrase--although it may sound so; there is\r\na great historical truth behind it. The revolutionary Socialist--I\r\ncall him revolutionary because he wants to alter the whole basis of\r\nsociety--would like to get rid of all private property, except,\r\nperhaps, our domestic pots and pans. He is averse from private\r\nenterprise. He is going absurdly too far; but what gave birth to his\r\ndoctrine? The abuse of the rights of private property, the cruelty and\r\nthe failure of the scramble for gain, which mark the reign of a\r\none-sided Individualism. If we had not gone much too far in one\r\ndirection, we should not have had this extravagant reaction in the\r\nother. But do not let us lose our heads in face of that reaction.\r\nWhile resisting the revolutionary propaganda, let us be more, and not\r\nless, strenuous in removing the causes of it.\r\n\r\nYou may think I am now talking pure Radicalism. Well, but it is not to\r\nthe objects which many Radicals have at heart that we, as Unionists,\r\nneed take exception. Why should we make them a present of those good\r\nobjects? Old age pensions; the multiplication of small landholders--and,\r\nlet me add, landowners; the resuscitation of agriculture; and, on the\r\nother hand, better housing in our crowded centres; town planning;\r\nsanitary conditions of labour; the extinction of sweating; the physical\r\ntraining of the people; continuation schools--these and all other\r\nmeasures necessary to preserve the stamina of the race and develop its\r\nintelligence and productive power--have we not as good a right to\r\nregard these as our objects, aye, and in many cases a better right, than\r\nthe supporters of the Government have?\r\n\r\nIt is not these objects which we deprecate. On the contrary, they have\r\nour ardent sympathy. What we do deprecate is the spirit in which they\r\nare so often preached and pursued. No progress is going to be\r\nmade--quite the contrary--by stirring up class hatred or trying to rob\r\nPeter in order to pay Paul. It is not true that you cannot benefit one\r\nclass without taking from another class--still less true that by\r\ntaking from one you necessarily benefit another. The national income,\r\nthe sum total of all our productive activities, is capable of being\r\nenormously increased or diminished by wise or foolish policy. For it\r\ndoes not only depend on the amount of capital and labour. A number of\r\nfar subtler factors enter into the account--science, organisation,\r\nenergy, credit, confidence, the spirit in which men set about their\r\nbusiness. The one thing which would be certain to diminish that\r\nincome, and to recoil on all of us, would be that war of classes which\r\nmany people seem anxious to stir up. Nothing could be more fatal to\r\nprosperity, and to the fairest hopes of social progress, than if the\r\ngreat body of the upper and middle classes of the community had cause\r\nto regard that progress as indissolubly associated with an attack upon\r\nthemselves. And that is why, if reforms such as I have indicated are\r\ncostly--as they will be costly--you must find some better way of\r\nproviding for them than by merely giving another turn to the\r\nincome-tax screw, or just adding so much per cent. to the estate duty.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, social reform is a national affair. All classes\r\nbenefit by it, not only those directly affected. And therefore all\r\nshould contribute according to their means. I do not in any way object\r\nto the rich being made to contribute, even for purposes in which they\r\nare not directly interested. What I do object to is that the great\r\nbody of the people should not contribute to them. It is thoroughly\r\nvicious in principle to divide the nation, as many of the Radical and\r\nLabour men want to divide it, into two sections--a majority which only\r\ncalls the tune, and a minority which only pays the piper.\r\n\r\nI own I am aghast at the mean opinion which many politicians seem to\r\nhave of the mass of their working fellow countrymen, when they\r\napproach them with this crude sort of bribery, offering them\r\neverything for nothing, always talking to them of their claims upon\r\nthe State, and never of their duties towards it. This is a democratic\r\ncountry. It is their State and their Empire--theirs to possess, theirs\r\nto control, but theirs also to support and to defend. And I for one\r\nhave such faith in the common sense and fair-mindedness of the British\r\npeople that I believe you have only to convince them that you have a\r\nreally sound national policy, and they will rally to it, without\r\nhaving to be bought by promises of a penny off this and twopence off\r\nthe other--a sort of appeal, I regret to say, which is not only\r\nconfined to Radical orators, but in which Unionists also are\r\nsometimes too apt to indulge.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, gentlemen, only one word in conclusion--a brief and\r\ninadequate reference to a vast subject, but one to which I am at all\r\ntimes and seasons specially bound to refer. After all, my chief\r\nquarrel with the Radical party--not with all of them--I do not say\r\nthat for a moment--but with a far too large and influential\r\nsection--is their anti-patriotism. I use the word advisedly. It is not\r\nthat they are unpatriotic in the sense of having no affection for\r\ntheir country. It is that they are deliberately and on principle--I do\r\nnot asperse their motives; I do not question their sincerity and\r\nconviction--anti-patriotic, opposed to national as distinct from\r\ncosmopolitan ideals. They are not zealous for national defence; they\r\nhave no faith in the Empire; they love to show their impartiality by\r\ntaking sides against their own country; they object to their children\r\nbeing taught respect for the flag. But we Unionists are not\r\ncosmopolitans, but Britons. We have no envy or ill-will towards other\r\nnations; a man is not a worse neighbour because he loves his own\r\nfamily. But we do hold that it is not our business to look after\r\nothers. It is our business to look after ourselves and our\r\ndependencies, and the great kindred communities who own allegiance to\r\nthe British flag. We want to draw closer to them, to stand together;\r\nand we believe that the strength and the unity of the British Empire\r\nare of vital and practical importance to every citizen. In all our\r\npropaganda, and in all our policy, let us continue to give that great\r\nprinciple a foremost place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIONISTS AND THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nEdinburgh, November 15, 1907\r\n\r\n\r\nI am greatly reassured by the very kind reception which you have just\r\ngiven me. To tell the truth, I had been feeling a little alarmed at\r\nthe fate which might await me in Edinburgh. From a faithful perusal of\r\nthe Radical Press I had been led to believe that Scotland was seething\r\nwith righteous indignation against that branch of the Legislature of\r\nwhich I am, it is true, only a humble and very recent member, but yet\r\na member, and therefore involved in the general condemnation of the\r\nruthless hereditary tyrants and oppressors of the people, the\r\nprivileged landowning class, which is alleged to be so out of sympathy\r\nwith the mass of their fellow-countrymen, although, oddly enough, it\r\nsupplies many of the most popular candidates, not only of one party,\r\nat any General Election. Personally, I feel it rather hard to be\r\npainted in such black colours. There is no taint of hereditary\r\nprivilege about me. I am not--I wish I were--the owner of broad acres,\r\nand I am in no way conscious of belonging to a specially favoured\r\nclass. There are a great many of my fellow members in the House of\r\nLords who are in the same position, and who sit there, not by virtue\r\nof any privilege, but by virtue of their services, or, let me say in\r\nmy own case, supposed services, to the State. And while we sit\r\nthere--and here I venture, with all humility, to speak for all the\r\nmembers of that body, whether hereditary or created--we feel that we\r\nought to deal with the questions submitted to us to the best of our\r\njudgment and conscience, without fear of the consequences to ourselves\r\nand without allowing ourselves to be brow-beaten for not being\r\ndifferent from what we are. We believe that we perform a useful and\r\nnecessary function. We believe that a Second Chamber is essential to\r\nthe good government of this country. We do not contend--certainly I am\r\nmyself very far from contending--that the existing Second Chamber is\r\nthe best imaginable. Let there be a well-considered reform of the\r\nHouse of Lords, or even, if need be, an entirely different Second\r\nChamber. But until you have got this better instrument, do not throw\r\naway the instrument which you have--the only defence, not of the\r\nprivileges of a class, but of the rights of the whole nation, against\r\nhasty, ill-considered measures and against the subordination of\r\npermanent national interests to the temporary exigencies of a party.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there is a permanent Conservative majority in the\r\nHouse of Lords. But then every Second Chamber is, and ought to be,\r\nconservative in temper. It exists to exercise a restraining influence,\r\nto ensure that great changes shall not be made in fundamental\r\ninstitutions except by the deliberate will of the nation, and not as\r\nthe outcome of a mere passing mood. And if the accusation is, that the\r\nHouse of Lords is too Conservative in a party sense, which is a\r\ndifferent thing, I admit, from being Conservative in the highest and\r\nbest sense, that points not to doing away with the Second Chamber, but\r\nto making such a change in its composition as, while leaving it still\r\npowerful, still, above all, independent, will render it more\r\nrepresentative of the permanent mind of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut let me be permitted to observe that the instance relied on to prove\r\nthat the House of Lords is in the pocket of the Conservative party is a\r\nvery unfortunate instance. What is its offence? It is said that the\r\nLords rejected the Scottish Land Bill. But they did not reject the\r\nScottish Land Bill. They were quite prepared to accept a portion of the\r\nBill, and it is for the Government to answer to the people interested\r\nin that portion for their not having received the benefits which the\r\nBill was presumably intended to bestow on them. What the Government did\r\nwas to hold a pistol at the head of the House of Lords, and to say that\r\nthey must either accept the whole straggling and ill-constructed\r\nmeasure as it stood, or be held up to public odium for rejecting it.\r\nBut when the Bill was looked at as a whole, it was found to contain\r\nprinciples--novel principles as far as the great part of Scotland was\r\nconcerned, bad principles, as the experience of Ireland showed--which\r\nthe House of Lords, and not only the Conservatives in the House of\r\nLords, were not prepared to endorse. Was it Conservative criticism\r\nwhich killed the Bill? It was riddled with arguments by a Liberal Peer\r\nand former Liberal Prime Minister--arguments to which the Government\r\nspeakers were quite unable, and had the good sense not even to attempt,\r\nto reply. And that is the instance which is quoted to prove that the\r\nHouse of Lords is a Tory Caucus!\r\n\r\nNow, before leaving this question of the House of Lords, let me just\r\nsay one word about its general attitude. I have not long been a member\r\nof that assembly. I do not presume to take much part in its\r\ndiscussions. But I follow them, and I think I follow them with a\r\nfairly unprejudiced mind. On many questions I am perhaps not in accord\r\nwith the views of the majority of the House. But what strikes me about\r\nthe House of Lords is that it is a singularly independent assembly. It\r\nis not at the beck and call of any man. It is a body which does not\r\ncare at all about party claptrap, but which does care a great deal\r\nabout a good argument, from whatever quarter it may proceed.\r\nMoreover, I am confident that the great body of its members are quite\r\nalive to the fact that they cannot afford to cast their votes merely\r\naccording to their individual opinions and personal prejudices--that\r\nthey are trustees for the nation, and that while it is their duty to\r\nprevent the nation being hustled into revolution, as but for them it\r\nwould have been hustled into Home Rule in 1893, they have no right to\r\nresist changes upon which the nation has clearly and after full\r\ndeliberation set its mind. And when the Prime Minister says that it is\r\nintolerable arrogance on the part of the House of Lords to pretend to\r\nknow better what the nation wishes than the House of Commons, I can\r\nonly reply that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. In 1893 the\r\nHouse of Commons said that the nation wished Home Rule. The House of\r\nLords had the intolerable arrogance to take a different view. Well,\r\nwithin less than two years the question was submitted to the nation;\r\nand who proved to be right?\r\n\r\nI regret to have had to dwell at such length upon this particular\r\ntopic. But it seems to me that we have no choice in the matter. If\r\nthe Government succeed in their attempt to divert the attention of the\r\nnation from matters of the greatest interest at home and abroad in\r\norder to involve us all in a constitutional struggle on a false issue,\r\nwe must be prepared to meet them. But I do not wish to waste the rare\r\nopportunity afforded to me to-night of addressing this great and\r\nrepresentative Scottish audience by talking exclusively about this\r\nregrettable manoeuvre. There is something I am anxious to say to you\r\nabout the future of the Unionist party. I do not claim to lay down a\r\npolicy for that or for any party. I am not, by temperament or\r\nantecedents, a good party man. But I want to be allowed, as a private\r\ncitizen, to point out what are the great services which I think the\r\nUnionist party can render to the nation at the present very critical\r\njuncture in its history. The Unionist party has a splendid record in\r\nthe past. For twenty years it has saved the United Kingdom from\r\ndisruption. It has preserved South Africa for the Empire; and, greatly\r\nas I feel and know, that the results of the efforts and sacrifices of\r\nthe nation have been marred and impaired by the disastrous policy of\r\nthe last two years, South Africa is still one country under the\r\nBritish flag. And all the time, in spite of foreign war and domestic\r\nsedition, the Unionist party has pursued a steady policy of practical\r\nsocial reform, and the administrative and legislative record of the\r\nlast twenty years will compare favourably with that of any period of\r\nour history.\r\n\r\nBut no party can afford to rely upon its past achievements. How is the\r\nUnionist party going to confront the great problems of the present\r\nday? The greatest of these problems, as I shall never cease to preach\r\nto my countrymen, is the maintenance of the great heritage which we\r\nowe to the courage, the enterprise, and the self-sacrifice of our\r\nforefathers, who built up one of the greatest Empires in history by,\r\non the whole, the most honourable means. The epoch of expansion is\r\npretty nearly past, but there remains before us a great work of\r\ndevelopment and consolidation. And that is a work which should appeal\r\nespecially to Scotsmen. The Scottish people have borne a great part,\r\ngreat out of proportion to their numbers, in building up our common\r\nBritish heritage. They are taking a foremost part in it to-day. All\r\nover the world, as settlers in Canada, in Australia, or in South\r\nAfrica, as administrators in India and elsewhere, they are among the\r\nsturdiest pillars on which the great Imperial fabric rests. I am not\r\ntalking in the air. I am speaking from my personal experience, and\r\nonly saying in public here to-night what I have said in private a\r\nhundred times, that as an agent of my country in distant lands I have\r\nhad endless occasion to appreciate the support given to the British\r\ncause by the ability, the courage, the shrewd sense and the broad\r\nImperial instinct of many Scotsmen. And therefore I look with\r\nconfidence to a Scottish audience to support my appeal for continuous\r\nnational effort in making the most of the British Empire. I say this\r\nis not a matter with regard to which we can afford to rest on our\r\nlaurels. We must either go forward or we shall go back. And especially\r\nought we to go forward in developing co-operation, on a basis of\r\nequality and partnership, with the great self-governing communities\r\nof our race in the distant portions of the world, else they will drift\r\naway from us. Do not let us think for a moment that we can afford such\r\nanother fiasco as the late Colonial Conference. Do not let us imagine\r\nfor a moment that we can go to sleep over the questions then raised,\r\nand not one of them settled, for four years, only to find ourselves\r\nunprepared when the next Conference meets. A cordial social welcome,\r\nmany toasts, many dinners, are all very well in their way, but they\r\nare not enough. What is wanted is a real understanding of what our\r\nfellow countrymen across the seas are driving at, and a real attempt\r\nto meet them in their efforts to keep us a united family. All that our\r\npresent rulers seem able to do is to misunderstand, and therefore\r\nunconsciously to misrepresent--I do not question their good\r\nintentions, but I think they are struck with mental blindness in this\r\nmatter--to misrepresent the attitude of the colonists and greatly to\r\nexaggerate the difficulties of meeting them half-way. The speeches of\r\nMinisters on a question like that of Colonial Preference leave upon me\r\nthe most deplorable impression. One would have thought that, if they\r\ncould not get over the objections which they feel to meeting the\r\nadvances of our kinsmen, they would at least show some sort of regret\r\nat their failure. But not a bit of it. Their one idea all along has\r\nbeen to magnify the difficulties in the way in order to make party\r\ncapital out of the business. They saw their way to a good cry about\r\n\"taxing the food of the people,\" the big and the little loaf, and so\r\nforth, and they went racing after it, regardless of everything but its\r\nelectioneering value. From first to last there has been the same\r\ndesire to make the worst of things, sometimes by very disingenuous\r\nmeans. First of all it was said that there was \"no Colonial offer.\"\r\nBut when the representatives of the Colonies came here, and all in the\r\nplainest terms offered us preference for preference, this device\r\nevidently had to be abandoned. So then it was asserted that, in order\r\nto give preference to the Colonies, we must tax raw materials. But\r\nthis move again was promptly checkmated by the clear and repeated\r\ndeclaration of the Colonial representatives that they did not expect\r\nus to tax raw materials. And so nothing was left to Ministers,\r\ndetermined as they were to wriggle out of any agreement with the\r\nColonies at all costs, except to fall back on the old, weary\r\nparrot-cry--\"Will you tax corn?\" \"Will you tax butter?\" and so on\r\nthrough the whole list of articles of common consumption, the taxation\r\nof any one of which was thought to be valuable as an electioneering\r\nbogey.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I am not the least bit frightened by any of these\r\nquestions. If I am asked whether I would tax this or tax that, it may\r\nbe proof of great depravity on my part, but I say without hesitation,\r\nthat, for a sufficient object, I should not have the least objection\r\nto putting two shillings a quarter on wheat or twopence a pound on\r\nbutter. But I must add that the whole argument nauseates me. What sort\r\nof opinion must these gentlemen have of their fellow countrymen, if\r\nthey think that the question of a farthing on the quartern loaf or\r\nhalf a farthing on the pat of butter is going to outweigh in their\r\nminds every national consideration? And these are the men who accused\r\nMr. Chamberlain of wishing to unite the Empire by sordid bonds! It is\r\nindeed extraordinary and to my mind almost heartrending to see how\r\nthis question of Tariff Reform continues to be discussed on the lowest\r\ngrounds, and how its higher and wider aspects seem to be so constantly\r\nneglected. Yet we have no excuse for ignoring them. The Colonial\r\nadvocates of Preference, and especially Mr. Deakin, with whose point\r\nof view I thoroughly agree, have repeatedly explained the great\r\npolitical, national, and I might almost say moral aspects of that\r\npolicy. There is a great deal more in it than a readjustment of\r\nduties--twopence off this and a penny on that. I do not say that such\r\ndetails are not important. When the time comes I am prepared to\r\nshow--and I am an old hand at these things--that the objections which\r\nloom so large in many eyes can really be very easily circumvented. But\r\nI would not attempt to bother my fellow countrymen with complicated\r\nchanges in their fiscal arrangements, or even with the discussion of\r\nthem, if it were not for the bigness of the principle that is\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nI wish to look at it from two points of view. The principle which\r\nlies at the root of Tariff Reform, in its Imperial aspect, is the\r\nnational principle. The people of these great dominions beyond the\r\nseas are no strangers to us. They are our own kith and kin. We do not\r\nwish to deal with them, even in merely material matters, on the same\r\nbasis as with strangers. That is the great difference between us\r\nTariff Reformers and the Cobdenites. The Cobdenite only looks at the\r\ncommercial side. He is a cosmopolitan. He does not care from whom he\r\nbuys, or to whom he sells. He does not care about the ulterior effects\r\nof his trading, whether it promotes British industry or ruins it;\r\nwhether it assists the growth of the kindred States, or only enriches\r\nforeign countries. To us Tariff Reformers these matters are of moment,\r\nand of the most tremendous moment. We do not undervalue our great\r\nforeign trade, and I for one am convinced that there is nothing in the\r\nprinciples of Tariff Reform which will injure that trade. Quite the\r\nreverse. But we do hold that our first concern is with the industry\r\nand productive capacities of our own country, and our next with those\r\nof the great kindred countries across the seas. We hold that a wise\r\nfiscal policy would help to direct commerce into channels which would\r\nnot only assist the British worker, but also assist Colonial\r\ndevelopment, and make for the greater and more rapid growth of those\r\ncountries, which not only contain our best customers, but our fellow\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThat, I say, is one aspect of the matter. But then there is the other\r\nside--the question of social reform in this country. Now here again we\r\ndiffer from the Cobdenite. The Cobdenite is an individualist. He\r\nbelieves that private enterprise, working under a system of unfettered\r\ncompetition, with cheapness as its supreme object, is the surest road\r\nto universal well-being. The Tariff Reformer also believes in private\r\nenterprise, but he does not believe that the mere blind struggle for\r\nindividual gain is going to produce the most beneficent results. He\r\ndoes not believe in cheapness if it is the result of sweating or of\r\nunderpaid labour. He keeps before him as the main object of all\r\ndomestic policy the gradual, steady elevation of the standard of life\r\nthroughout the community; and he believes that the action of the\r\nState deliberately directed to the encouragement of British industry,\r\nnot merely by tariffs, is part and parcel of any sound national policy\r\nand of true Imperialism. And please observe that in a number of cases\r\nthe Radical party itself has abandoned Cobdenism. Pure individualism\r\nwent to the wall in the Factory Acts, and it is going to the wall\r\nevery day in our domestic legislation. It is solely with regard to\r\nthis matter of imports that the Radical party still cling to the\r\nCobdenite doctrine, and the consequence is that their policy has\r\nbecome a mass of inconsistencies. It is devoid of any logical\r\nfoundation whatever.\r\n\r\nI know that there are many people, sound Unionists at heart, who still\r\nhave a difficulty about accepting the doctrines of the Tariff\r\nReformers. My belief is that, if they could only look at the matter\r\nfrom the broad national and Imperial point of view, they would come to\r\nalter their convictions. I am not advocating Tariff Reform as in\r\nitself the greatest of human objects. But it seems to me the key of\r\nthe position. It seems to me that, without it, we can neither take the\r\nfirst steps towards drawing closer the bonds between the mother\r\ncountry and the great self-governing States of the Empire; nor\r\nmaintain the prosperity of the British worker in face of unfair\r\nforeign competition; nor obtain that large and elastic revenue which\r\nis absolutely essential, if we are going to pursue a policy of social\r\nreform and mean real business. I cannot but hope that many of those\r\nwho still shy at Tariff Reform, when they come to look at it from this\r\npoint of view--to see it as I see it, not as an isolated thing, but as\r\nan essential and necessary part of a comprehensive national\r\npolicy--will rally to our cause. I have travelled along that road\r\nmyself. I have been a Cobdenite myself--I am not ashamed of it. But I\r\nhave come to see that the doctrine of free imports--the religion of\r\nfree imports, I ought to say--as it is practised in this country\r\nto-day, is inconsistent with social reform, inconsistent with fair\r\nplay to British industry, and inconsistent with the development and\r\nconsolidation of the Empire. And therefore I rejoice that, in the\r\nreally great speech which he delivered last night, the leader of the\r\nUnionist party has once more unhesitatingly affirmed his adhesion to\r\nthe principles which I have been trying, in my feebler way, to\r\nadvocate here this evening. My own conviction is that, when these\r\nprinciples are understood in all their bearings, they will command the\r\napproval of the mass of the people. And even in Scotland, where I dare\r\nsay it is a very uphill fight, I look forward with confidence to their\r\nultimate victory. Do not let us be discouraged if the fight is long\r\nand the progress slow. The great permanent influences are on our side.\r\nOn the one hand there is the growth of the Empire, with all the\r\nopportunities which it affords; on the other there is the increasing\r\ndetermination of foreign nations to keep their business to themselves.\r\nThese potent facts, which have already converted so many leading\r\nminds, will in due time make themselves felt in ever-widening circles.\r\nAnd they will not fail to produce their effect upon the shrewd\r\npractical sense of the Scottish people, especially when combined with\r\nan appeal to the patriotic instincts of a race which has done so much\r\nto make the Empire what it is, and which has such a supreme interest\r\nin its maintenance and consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIONISTS AND SOCIAL REFORM\r\n\r\nRugby, November 19, 1907\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been such a deluge of talk during the last three weeks that\r\nI doubt whether it is possible for me, or any man, to make a further\r\ncontribution to the discussion which will have any freshness or value.\r\nBut inasmuch as you probably do not all read all the speeches, you may\r\nperhaps be willing to hear from me a condensed summary of what it all\r\ncomes to--of course, from my point of view, which no doubt is not\r\nquite the same as that of the Prime Minister or Mr. Asquith. Now, from\r\nmy point of view, there has been a considerable clearing of the air,\r\nand we ought all to be in a position to take a more practical and less\r\nexaggerated view of the situation. Speaking as a Tariff Reformer, I\r\nthink that those people, with whom Tariff Reformers agree on almost\r\nall other political questions, but who are strongly and\r\nconscientiously opposed to anything like what they call tampering with\r\nour fiscal system, must by now understand a little better than they\r\ndid before what Tariff Reformers really aim at, and must begin to see\r\nthat there is nothing so very monstrous or revolutionary about our\r\nproposals. I hope they may also begin to see why it is that Tariff\r\nReformers are so persistent and so insistent upon their own particular\r\nview. There is something very attractive in the argument which says\r\nthat, since Tariff Reform is a stumbling-block to many good Unionists,\r\nit should be dropped, and our ranks closed in defence of an effective\r\nSecond Chamber, and in defence of all our institutions against\r\nrevolutionary attacks directed upon the existing order of society. In\r\nso far as this is an argument for tolerance and against\r\nexcommunicating people because they do not agree with me about Tariff\r\nReform, I am entirely in accord with it. I am only a convert to Tariff\r\nReform myself, although I am not a very recent convert, for at the\r\nbeginning of 1903, at Bloemfontein, I was instrumental in inducing all\r\nthe South African Colonies to give a substantial preference to goods\r\nof British origin. I was instrumental in doing that some months before\r\nthe great Tariff Reform campaign was inaugurated in this country by\r\nits leading champion, Mr. Chamberlain. But while I am all for personal\r\ntolerance, I am opposed to any compromise on the question of\r\nprinciple. I am not opposed to it from any perverseness or any\r\nobstinacy. I am opposed to it because I see clearly that dropping\r\nTariff Reform will knock the bottom out of a policy which I believe is\r\nnot only right in itself, but is the only effective defence of the\r\nUnion and of many other things which are very dear to us--I mean a\r\npolicy of constructive Imperialism, and of steady, consistent,\r\nunhasting, and unresting Social Reform.\r\n\r\nI have never advocated Tariff Reform as a nostrum or as a panacea. I\r\nhave never pretended that it is by itself alone sufficient to cure all\r\nthe evils inherent in our social system, or alone sufficient as a bond\r\nof Empire. What I contend is that without it, without recovering our\r\nfiscal freedom, without recovering the power to deal with Customs\r\nDuties in accordance with the conditions of the present time and not\r\nthe conditions of fifty years ago, we cannot carry out any of those\r\nmeasures which it is most necessary that we should carry out. Without\r\nit we are unable to defend ourselves against illegitimate foreign\r\ncompetition; we are unable to enter into those trade arrangements with\r\nthe great self-governing States of the British Crown across the seas,\r\nwhich are calculated to bestow the most far-reaching benefits upon\r\nthem and upon us; and we are unable to obtain the revenue which is\r\nrequired for a policy of progressive Social Reform. I hope that people\r\notherwise in agreement with us, who have hitherto not seen their way\r\nto get over their objections to Tariff Reform, will, nevertheless,\r\nfind themselves able to accept that principle, when they regard it,\r\nnot as an isolated thing, but as an essential part of a great national\r\nand Imperial policy.\r\n\r\nOf course, they will have to see it as it is, and not as it is\r\nrepresented by its opponents. The opponents of Tariff Reform have a\r\nvery easy method of arguing with its supporters. They say that any\r\ndeparture whatsoever from our present fiscal system necessarily\r\ninvolves taxing raw materials, and must necessarily result in high and\r\nprohibitive duties, which will upset our foreign trade, and will be\r\nruinous and disorganising to the whole business of the country. But\r\nTariff Reformers are not going to frame their duties in order to suit\r\nthe argumentative convenience of Mr. Asquith. They are going to be\r\nguided by wholly different considerations from that. It is curious\r\nthat everybody opposed to Tariff Reform says that Tariff Reformers\r\nintend to tax raw material, while Tariff Reformers themselves have\r\nsteadily said they do not. I ask you in that respect to take the\r\ndescription of a policy of Tariff Reform from those who advocate it,\r\nand not from those who oppose it. And as for the argument about high\r\nprohibitive duties, I wish people would read the reports or summaries\r\nof the reports of the Tariff Commission. They contain not only the\r\nmost valuable collection that exists anywhere of the present facts\r\nabout almost every branch of British industry but they are also an\r\nauthoritative source from which to draw inferences as to the\r\nintentions of Tariff Reformers. Now the Tariff Reform Commission have\r\nnot attempted to frame a complete tariff, a scale of duties for all\r\narticles imported into this country, and wisely, because, if they had\r\ntried to do that, people would have said that they were arrogating to\r\nthemselves the duties of Parliament. What they have done is to show by\r\na few instances that a policy of Tariff Reform is not a thing in the\r\nair, not a mere thing of phrases and catchwords, but is a practical,\r\nbusinesslike working policy. They have drawn up what may be called\r\nexperimental scales of duties, which are merely suggestions for\r\nconsideration, with respect to a number of articles under the\r\nprincipal heads of British imports, such as, for instance,\r\nagricultural imports and imports of iron and steel. These experimental\r\nduties vary on the average from something like 5 per cent. to 10 per\r\ncent. on the value of the articles. In no one case in my recollection\r\ndo they exceed 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nBut then the opponents of Tariff Reform say: \"Yes. That is all very\r\nwell. But though you may begin with moderate duties, you are bound to\r\nproceed to higher ones. It is in the nature of things that you should\r\ngo on increasing and increasing, and in the end we shall all be\r\nruined.\" I must say that seems to me great nonsense. It reminds me of\r\nnothing so much as the fearful warnings which I have read in the least\r\njudicious sort of temperance literature, and sometimes heard from\r\ntemperance orators of the more extreme type--the sort of warning, I\r\nmean, that, if you once begin touching anything stronger than water,\r\nyou are bound to go on till you end by beating your wife and die in a\r\nworkhouse. But you and I know perfectly well that it is possible to\r\nhave an occasional glass of beer or glass of wine, or even, low be it\r\nspoken, a little whisky, without beating or wanting to beat anybody,\r\nand without coming to such a terrible end. The argument against the\r\nuse of anything from its abuse has always struck me as one of the\r\nfeeblest of arguments. And just see how particularly absurd it is in\r\nthe present case. The effect of duties on foreign imports, even such\r\nmoderate and carefully devised duties as those to which I have\r\nreferred, would, we are told, be ruinous to British trade. It would\r\nplace intolerable burdens upon the people. Yet for all that the people\r\nwould, it appears, insist on increasing these burdens. Surely it is as\r\nclear as a pike-staff that, if the duties which Tariff Reformers\r\nadvocate were to produce the evils which Free Importers allege that\r\nthey would produce, these duties, so far from being inevitably\r\nmaintained and increased, would not survive one General Election after\r\ntheir imposition.\r\n\r\nIt is not only with regard to Tariff Reform that I think the air is\r\nclearer. The Unionist Party has to my mind escaped another danger\r\nwhich was quite as great as that of allowing the Tariff question to be\r\npushed on one side, and that was the danger of being frightened by the\r\nscare, which the noisy spreading of certain subversive doctrines has\r\nlately caused, into a purely negative and defensive attitude; of\r\nceasing to be, as it has been, a popular and progressive party, and\r\nbecoming merely the embodiment of upper and middle class prejudices\r\nand alarms. I do not say that there are not many projects in the air\r\nwhich are calculated to excite alarm, but they can only be\r\nsuccessfully resisted on frankly democratic and popular lines. My own\r\nfeeling is--I may be quite wrong, but I state my opinion for what it\r\nis worth--that there is far less danger of the democracy going wrong\r\nabout domestic questions than there is of its going wrong about\r\nforeign and Imperial questions, and for this simple reason, that with\r\nregard to domestic questions they have their own sense and experience\r\nto guide them.\r\n\r\nIf a mistake is made in domestic policy its consequences are rapidly\r\nfelt, and no amount of fine talking will induce people to persist in\r\ncourses which are affecting them injuriously in their daily lives. You\r\nhave thus a constant and effective check upon those who are disposed\r\nto try dangerous experiments, or to go too fast even on lines which\r\nmay be in themselves laudable, as the experience of recent municipal\r\nelections, among other things, clearly shows. But with regard to\r\nImperial questions, to our great and vital interests in distant parts\r\nof the earth, there is necessarily neither the same amount of personal\r\nknowledge on the part of the electorate, nor do the consequences of a\r\nmistaken policy recoil so directly and so unmistakably upon them.\r\nThese subjects, therefore, are the happy hunting-ground of the\r\nvisionary and the phrase-maker. I have seen the people of this country\r\ntalked into a policy with regard to South Africa at once so injurious\r\nto their own interests, and so base towards those who had thrown in\r\ntheir lot with us and trusted us, that, if the British nation had only\r\nknown what that policy really meant, they would have spat it out of\r\ntheir mouths. And I tremble every day lest, on the vital question of\r\nDefence, the pressure of well-meaning but ignorant idealists, or the\r\nmeaner influence of vote-catching demagogues, should lead this\r\nGovernment or, indeed, any Government, to curtail the provisions,\r\nalready none too ample, for the safety of the Empire, in order to pose\r\nas the friends of peace or as special adepts in economy. I know these\r\nsavings of a million or two a year over say five or ten years, which\r\ncost you fifty or one hundred millions, wasted through unreadiness\r\nwhen the crisis comes, to say nothing of the waste of gallant lives\r\neven more precious. This is the kind of question about which the\r\ndemocracy is liable to be misled, being without the corrective of\r\ndirect personal contact with the facts to keep it straight. And it is\r\nunpopular and up-hill work to go on reminding people of the vastness\r\nof the duty and the responsibility which the control of so great a\r\nportion of the earth's surface, with a dependent population of three\r\nor four hundred millions, necessarily involves; to go on reminding\r\nthem, too, how their own prosperity and even existence in these\r\nislands are linked by a hundred subtle but not always obvious or\r\nsuperficially apparent threads with the maintenance of those great\r\nexternal possessions.\r\n\r\nI say these are difficulties which any party or any man, who is\r\nprepared to do his duty by the electorate of this country, not merely\r\nto ingratiate himself with them for the moment, but to win their\r\nconfidence by deserving it, by telling them the truth, by serving\r\ntheir permanent interests and not their passing moods, is bound to\r\nface. For my own part, I have always been perfectly frank on these\r\nquestions. I have maintained on many platforms, I am prepared to\r\nmaintain here to-night and shall always maintain, although this is a\r\nsubject on which it may be long before my views are included in any\r\nparty programme--I say I shall always maintain that real security is\r\nnot possible without citizen service, and that the training of every\r\nable-bodied man to be capable of taking part, if need be, in the\r\ndefence of his country, is not only good for the country but good for\r\nthe man--and would materially assist in the solution of many other\r\nproblems, social and economic. But being, as I am, thus\r\nuncompromising, and quite prepared to find myself unpopular, on these\r\nvital questions of national security, and of our Imperial duties and\r\nresponsibilities, I can perhaps afford to say, without being suspected\r\nof fawning or of wishing to play the demagogue myself, that in the\r\nmatter of domestic reform I am not easy to frighten, and that I have a\r\nvery great trust in the essential fair-mindedness and good sense of\r\nthe great body of my fellow countrymen with regard to questions which\r\ncome within their own direct cognisance. And therefore it was most\r\nreassuring to me at any rate--and I hope it was to you--to observe,\r\nthat that large section of the Unionist Party which met at Birmingham\r\nlast week, not so much by any resolutions or formal programme--for\r\nthere was nothing very novel in these--as by the whole tone and temper\r\nof its proceedings, affirmed in the most emphatic manner the\r\nessentially progressive and democratic character of Unionism. The\r\ngreatest danger I hold to the Unionist Party and to the nation is that\r\nthe ideals of national strength and Imperial consolidation on the one\r\nhand, and of democratic progress and domestic reform on the other,\r\nshould be dissevered, and that people should come to regard as\r\nantagonistic objects which are essentially related and complementary\r\nto one another. The upholders of the Union, the upholders of the\r\nEmpire, the upholders of the fundamental institutions of the State,\r\nmust not only be, but must be seen and known to be, the strenuous and\r\nconstant assailants of those two great related curses of our social\r\nsystem--irregular employment and unhealthy conditions of life--and of\r\nall the various causes which lead to them.\r\n\r\nI cannot stay here to enumerate those causes, but I will mention a\r\nfew of them. There is the defective training of children, defective\r\nphysical training to begin with, and then the failure to equip them\r\nwith any particular and definite form of skill. There is the irregular\r\nway in which new centres of population are allowed to spring up, so\r\nthat we go on creating fresh slums as fast as we pull down the old\r\nrookeries. There is the depopulation of the countryside, and the\r\ninflux of foreign paupers into our already overcrowded towns. There is\r\nthe undermining of old-established and valuable British industries by\r\nunfair foreign competition. That is not an exhaustive list, but it is\r\nsufficient to illustrate my meaning. Well, wherever these and similar\r\nevils are eating away the health and independence of our working\r\npeople, there the foundations of the Empire are being undermined, for\r\nit is the race that makes the Empire. Loud is the call to every true\r\nUnionist, to every true Imperialist, to come to the rescue.\r\n\r\nAnd now at the risk of wearying you there is one other subject to\r\nwhich I would like specially to refer, lest I should be accused of\r\ndeliberately giving it the go-by, and that is the question of old age\r\npensions. It is not a reform altogether of the same nature as those on\r\nwhich I have been dwelling, nor is it perhaps the kind of reform about\r\nwhich I feel the greatest enthusiasm, because I would rather attack\r\nthe causes, which lead to that irregularity of employment and that\r\nunder-payment which prevents people from providing for their own old\r\nage themselves, than merely remedy the evils arising from it. But I\r\naccept the fact that under present conditions, which it may be that a\r\nprogressive policy in time will alter, a sufficient case for State aid\r\nin the matter of old age pensions has been made out, and I believe\r\nthat no party is going to oppose the introduction of old age pensions.\r\nBut, on the other hand, I foresee great difficulties and great\r\ndisputes over the question of the manner in which the money is to be\r\nprovided. I know how our Radical friends will wish to provide the\r\nmoney. They will want to get it, in the first instance, by starving\r\nthe Army and the Navy. To that way of providing it I hope the Unionist\r\nParty, however unpopular such a course may be, and however liable to\r\nmisrepresentation it may be, will oppose an iron resistance, because\r\nthis is an utterly rotten and bad way of financing old age pensions,\r\nor anything else. But that method alone, however far it is carried,\r\nwill not provide money enough, and there will be an attempt to raise\r\nthe rest by taxes levied exclusively on the rich. I am against that\r\nalso, because it is thoroughly wrong in principle. I am not against\r\nmaking the rich pay, to the full extent of their capacity, for great\r\nnational purposes, even for national purposes in which they have no\r\ndirect interest. But I am not prepared to see them made to pay\r\nexclusively. Let all pay according to their means. It is a thoroughly\r\nvicious idea that money should be taken out of the pocket of one man,\r\nhowever rich, in order to be put into the pocket of another, however\r\npoor. That is a bad, anti-national principle, and I hope the\r\nUnionist Party will take a firm stand against it. And this is an\r\nadditional reason why we should raise whatever money may be necessary\r\nby duties upon foreign imports, because in that way all will\r\ncontribute. No doubt the rich will contribute the bulk of the money\r\nthrough the duties on imported luxuries, but there will be some\r\ncontribution, as there ought to be some contribution, from every class\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in conclusion, one word about purely practical\r\nconsiderations. We Unionists, if you will allow me to call myself a\r\nUnionist--at any rate I have explained quite frankly what I mean by\r\nthe term--are not a class party, but a national party. That being so,\r\nit is surely of the utmost importance that men of all classes should\r\nparticipate in every branch and every grade of the work of the\r\nUnionist Party. Why should we not have Unionist Labour members as well\r\nas Radical Labour members? I think that the working classes of this\r\ncountry are misrepresented in the eyes of the public of this country\r\nand of the world, as long as they appear to have no leaders in\r\nParliament except the men who concoct and pass those machine-made\r\nresolutions with which we are so familiar in the reports of Trade\r\nUnion Congresses. I am not speaking now about their resolutions on\r\ntrade questions, which they thoroughly understand, but about\r\nresolutions on such subjects as foreign politics, the Army and Navy,\r\nand Colonial and Imperial questions, resolutions which are always\r\nupon the same monotonous lines. I do not believe that the working\r\nclasses are the unpatriotic, anti-national, down-with-the-army,\r\nup-with-the-foreigner, take-it-lying-down class of Little Englanders\r\nthat they are constantly represented to be. I do not believe it for a\r\nmoment. I have heard Imperial questions discussed by working men in\r\nexcellent speeches, not only eloquent speeches, but speeches showing a\r\nbroad grasp and a truly Imperial spirit, and I should like speeches of\r\nthat kind to be heard in the House of Commons as an antidote to the\r\nsort of preaching which we get from the present Labour members. And\r\nwhat I say about the higher posts in the Unionist Army applies equally\r\nto all other ranks. No Unionist member or Unionist candidate is really\r\nwell served unless he has a number of men of the working class on what\r\nI may call his political staff. And I say this not merely for\r\nelectioneering reasons. This is just one of the cases in which\r\nconsiderations of party interest coincide--I wish they always or often\r\ndid--with considerations of a higher character. There is nothing more\r\ncalculated to remove class prejudice and antagonism than the\r\nco-operation of men of different classes on the same body for the same\r\npublic end. And there is this about the aims of Unionism, that they\r\nare best calculated to teach the value of such co-operation; to bring\r\nhome to men of all classes their essential inter-dependence on one\r\nanother, as well as to bring home to each individual the pettiness and\r\nmeanness of personal vanity and ambition in the presence of anything\r\nso great, so stately, as the common heritage and traditions of the\r\nBritish race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEATED INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nOxford, December 5, 1907\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exhibition is one of a series which are being held in different\r\nparts of the country with the object of directing attention, or rather\r\nof keeping it directed, to the conditions under which a number of\r\narticles, many of them articles of primary necessity, are at present\r\nbeing produced, and with the object also of improving the lot of the\r\npeople engaged in the production of those articles. Now this matter is\r\none of great national importance, because the sweated workers are\r\nnumbered by hundreds of thousands, and because their poverty and the\r\nresulting evils affect many beside themselves, and exercise a\r\ndepressing influence on large classes of the community. What do we\r\nmean by sweating? I will give you a definition laid down by a\r\nParliamentary Committee, which made a most exhaustive inquiry into\r\nthe subject: \"Unduly low rates of wages, excessive hours of work, and\r\ninsanitary condition of the workplaces.\" You may say that this is a\r\nstate of things against which our instincts of humanity and charity\r\nrevolt. And that is perfectly true, but I do not propose to approach\r\nthe question from that point of view to-day. I want to approach it\r\nfrom the economic and political standpoint. But when I say political I\r\ndo not mean it in any party sense. This is not a party question; may\r\nit never become one. The organisers of this exhibition have done what\r\nlay in their power to prevent the blighting and corrosive influence of\r\nparty from being extended to it. The fact that the position which I\r\noccupy at this moment will be occupied to-morrow by the wife of a\r\ndistinguished member of the present Government (Mrs. Herbert\r\nGladstone), and on Saturday by a leading member of the Labour Party\r\n(Mr. G.N. Barnes, M.P.), shows that this is a cause in which people of\r\nall parties can co-operate. The more we deal with sweating on these\r\nlines, the more we deal with it on its merits or demerits without\r\nulterior motive, the more likely we shall be to make a beginning in\r\nthe removal of those evils against which our crusade is directed.\r\n\r\nMy view is, that the sweating system impoverishes and weakens the\r\nwhole community, because it saps the stamina and diminishes the\r\nproductive power of thousands of workers, and these in their turn drag\r\nothers down with them. \"Unduly low rates of wages, excessive hours of\r\nlabour, insanitary condition of workplaces\"--what does all that mean?\r\nIt means an industry essentially rotten and unsound. To say that the\r\nlabourer is worthy of his hire is not only the expression of a natural\r\ninstinct of justice, but it embodies an economic truth. One does not\r\nneed to be a Socialist, not, at least, a Socialist in the sense in\r\nwhich the word is ordinarily used, as designating a man who desires\r\nthat all instruments of production should become common property--one\r\ndoes not need to be a Socialist in that sense in order to realise that\r\nan industry, which does not provide those engaged in it with\r\nsufficient to keep them in health is essentially unsound. Used-up\r\ncapital must be replaced, and of all forms of capital the most\r\nfundamental and indispensable is the human energy necessarily consumed\r\nin the work of production. A sweated industry does not provide for the\r\nreplacing of that kind of capital. It squanders its human material. It\r\nconsumes more energy in the work it exacts than the remuneration it\r\ngives is capable of replacing. The workers in sweated industries are\r\nnot able to live on their wages. As it is, they live miserably, grow\r\nold too soon, and bring up sickly children. But they would not live at\r\nall, were it not for the fact that their inadequate wages are\r\nsupplemented, directly, in many cases, by out-relief, and indirectly\r\nby numerous forms of charity. In one way or another the community has\r\nto make good the inefficiency that sweating produces. In one way or\r\nanother the community ultimately pays, and it is my firm belief that\r\nit pays far more in the long run under the present system than if all\r\nworkers were self-supporting. If a true account could be kept, it\r\nwould be found that anything which the community gains by the\r\ncheapness of articles produced under the sweating system is more than\r\noutweighed by the indirect loss involved in the inevitable subsidising\r\nof a sweated industry. That would be found to be the result, even if\r\nno account were taken of the greatest loss of all, the loss arising\r\nfrom the inefficiency of the sweated workers and of their children,\r\nfor sweating is calculated to perpetuate inefficiency and\r\ndegeneration.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Can anything be done? Of the three related\r\nevils--unduly low rates of wages, excessive hours of labour, and\r\ninsanitary condition of work-places--it is evident that the first\r\napplies equally to sweated workers in factories and at home, but the\r\ntwo others are to some extent guarded against, in factories, by\r\nexisting legislation. This is the reason why some people would like to\r\nsee all work done for wages transferred to factories. Broadly\r\nspeaking, I sympathise with that view. But if it were universally\r\ncarried out at the present moment, it would inflict an enormous amount\r\nof suffering and injustice on those who add to their incomes by home\r\nwork. Hence the problem is twofold. First, can we extend to workers in\r\ntheir own homes that degree or protection in respect of hours and\r\nsanitary conditions which the law already gives to workers in\r\nfactories? And secondly, can we do anything to obtain for sweated\r\nworkers, whether in homes or factories, rates of remuneration less\r\npalpably inadequate? Now it certainly seems impossible to limit the\r\nhours of workers, especially adult workers, in their own homes. More\r\ncan be done to ensure sanitary conditions of work. Much has been done\r\nalready, so far as the structural condition of dwellings is concerned.\r\nBut I am afraid that the measures necessary to introduce what may be\r\ncalled the factory standard of sanitariness into every room, where\r\nwork is being done for wages, would involve an amount of inspection\r\nand interference with the domestic lives of hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople which might create such unpopularity as to defeat its own\r\nobject. I do not say that nothing more should be attempted in that\r\ndirection, quite the reverse; but I say that nothing which can be\r\nattempted in that direction really goes to the root of the evil, which\r\nis the insufficiency of the wage. How can you possibly make it healthy\r\nfor a woman, living in a single room, perhaps with children, but even\r\nwithout, to work twelve or fourteen hours a day for seven or eight\r\nshillings a week, and at the same time to do her own cooking, washing,\r\nand so on. How much food is she likely to have? How much time will be\r\nhers to keep the place clean and tidy? An increase of wages would not\r\nmake sanitary regulations unnecessary, but it would make their\r\nobservance more possible.\r\n\r\nAn increase of wages then is the primary condition of any real\r\nimprovement in the lives of the sweated workers. So the point is this.\r\nCan we do anything by law to screw up the remuneration of the\r\nworst-paid workers to the minimum necessary for tolerable human\r\nexistence? I know that many people think it impossible, but my answer\r\nis that the fixing of a limit below which wages shall not fall is\r\nalready not the exception but the rule in this country. That may seem\r\na rather startling statement, but I believe I can prove it. Take the\r\ncase of the State, the greatest of all employers. The State does not\r\nallow the rates of pay even of its humblest employés to be decided by\r\nthe scramble for employment. The State cannot afford, nor can any\r\ngreat municipality afford, to pay wages on which it is obviously\r\nimpossible to live. There would be an immediate outcry. Here then you\r\nhave a case of vast extent in which a downward limit of wages is fixed\r\nby public opinion. Take, again, any of the great staple industries of\r\nthe country, the cotton industry, the iron and steel industry, and\r\nmany others. In the case of these industries rates of remuneration are\r\nfixed in innumerable instances by agreement between the whole body of\r\nemployers in a particular trade and district on the one hand and the\r\nwhole body of employés on the other. The result is to exclude\r\nunregulated competition and to secure the same wages for the same\r\nwork. No doubt there is an element--and this is a point of great\r\nimportance--which enters into the determination of wages in these\r\norganised trades, but which does not enter in the same degree into the\r\ndetermination of the salaries paid by the State. That element is the\r\nconsideration of what the employers can afford to pay. This question\r\nis constantly being threshed out between them and the workpeople,\r\nwith resulting agreements. The number of such agreements is very\r\nlarge, and the provisions contained in them often regulate the rate of\r\nremuneration for various classes of workers with the greatest\r\nminuteness. But the great object, and the principal effect of all\r\nthese agreements, is this: it is to ensure uniformity of remuneration,\r\nthe same wage for the same work, and to protect the most necessitous\r\nand most helpless workers from being forced to take less than the\r\nemployers can afford to pay. Broadly speaking, the rate of pay, in\r\nthese highly organised industries, is determined by the value of the\r\nwork and not by the need of the worker. That makes an enormous\r\ndifference. But in sweated industries this is not the case. Sweated\r\nindustries are the unorganised industries, those in which there is no\r\npossibility of organisation among the workers. Here the individual\r\nworker, without resources and without backing, is left, in the\r\nstruggle of unregulated competition, to take whatever he can get,\r\nregardless of what others may be getting for the same work and-of the\r\nvalue of the work itself. Hence the extraordinary inequality of\r\npayment for the same kind of work and the generally low average of\r\npayment which are the distinguishing features of all sweated\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nNow, if you have followed this rather dry argument, I shall probably\r\nhave your concurrence when I say, that the proposal that the State\r\nshould intervene to secure, not an all-round minimum wage, but the\r\nsame wages for the same work, and nothing less than the standard rate\r\nof his particular work for every worker, is not a proposition that the\r\nState should do something new, or exceptional, or impracticable. It is\r\na proposal that the State should do for the weakest and most helpless\r\ntrades what the strongly-organised trades already do for themselves. I\r\ncannot see that there is anything unreasonable, much less\r\nrevolutionary or subversive, in that suggestion.\r\n\r\nThis proposal has taken practical form in a Bill presented to the\r\nHouse of Commons last session. Whether the measure reached its second\r\nreading or not I do not know. It was a Bill for the establishment of\r\nWages Boards in certain industries employing great numbers of\r\nworkpeople, such as tailoring, shirtmaking, and so on. The industries\r\nselected were those in which the employés, though numerous, are\r\nhopelessly disorganised and unable to make a bargain for themselves.\r\nAnd the Bill provided that where any six persons, whether masters or\r\nemployés, applied to the Home Secretary for the establishment of a\r\nWages Board, such a Board should be created in the particular industry\r\nand district concerned; that it should consist of representatives of\r\nemployers and employed in equal proportions, with an impartial\r\nchairman; and that it should have the widest possible discretion to\r\nfix rates of remuneration. If Wages Boards were established, as the\r\nBill proposed, they would simply do for sweated trades what is already\r\nconstantly being done in organised trades, with no doubt one important\r\ndifference, that the decisions of these Boards would be enforceable by\r\nlaw. Now that no doubt may seem to many of you a drastic proposition.\r\nBut I would strongly recommend any one interested in the subject to\r\nstudy a recently-published Blue-book, one of the most interesting I\r\nhave ever read, which contains the evidence given before the House of\r\nCommons Committee on Home Work. That Blue-book throws floods of light\r\non the conditions which have led to the proposal of Wages Boards, on\r\nthe way in which these Boards would be likely to work, and on the\r\nresults of the operation of such Boards in the Colony of Victoria,\r\nwhere they have existed for more than ten years, and now apply to more\r\nthan forty industries. The perusal of that evidence would, I feel\r\nsure, remove some at least of the most obvious objections to this\r\nproposed remedy for sweating.\r\n\r\nMany people look askance, and justly look askance, at the interference\r\nof the State in anything so complicated and technical as a schedule of\r\nwages for any particular industry. But the point to bear in mind is\r\nthis, that the wages, which under this proposal would be enforceable\r\nby law, would be wages that had been fixed for a particular industry\r\nin a particular district by persons intimately cognisant with all the\r\ncircumstances, and, more than that, by persons having the deepest\r\ncommon interest to avoid anything which could injure the industry. The\r\nrates of remuneration so arrived at would be based on the\r\nconsideration of what the employers could afford to pay and yet retain\r\nsuch a reasonable rate of profit as would lead to their remaining in\r\nthe industry. Such a regulation of wages would be as great a\r\nprotection to the best employers against the cut-throat competition of\r\nunscrupulous rivals as it would be to the workers against being\r\ncompelled to sell their labour for less than its value. There is\r\nplenty of evidence that the regulation of wages would be welcomed by\r\nmany employers. And as for the fear sometimes expressed, that it would\r\ninjure the weakest and least efficient workers, because, with\r\nincreased wages, it would no longer be profitable to employ them, it\r\nmust be borne in mind that people of that class are mainly home\r\nworkers, and as remuneration for home work must be based on the piece,\r\nthere would be no reason why they should not continue to be employed.\r\nNo doubt they would not benefit as much as more efficient workers from\r\nincreased rates, but _pro tanto_ they would still benefit, and that is\r\na consideration of great importance. But even if this were not the\r\ncase, I would still contend, that it was unjustifiable to allow\r\nthousands of people to remain in a preventable state of misery and\r\ndegradation all their lives, merely in order to keep a tenth of their\r\nnumber out of the workhouse a few years longer.\r\n\r\nI have only one more word to say. I come back to the supreme interest\r\nof the community in the efficiency and welfare of all its members, to\r\nsay nothing of the removal of the stain upon its honour and conscience\r\nwhich continued tolerance of this evil involves. That to my mind is\r\nthe greatest consideration of all. That is the true reason, as it\r\nwould be the sufficient justification, for the intervention of the\r\nState. And, or my own part, I feel no doubt that, whether by the\r\nadoption of such a measure as we have been considering, or by some\r\nother enactment, steps will before long be taken for the removal of\r\nthis national disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Printed by BALLANTYNE & CO.
