  "content": "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death\r\n\r\n \r\nPatrick Henry, March 23, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities,\r\nof the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different\r\nmen often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it\r\nwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do\r\nopinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my\r\nsentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.\r\nThe question before the House is one of awful moment to this country.\r\nFor my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of\r\nfreedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject\r\nought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that\r\nwe can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility\r\nwhich we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions\r\nat such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself\r\nas guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty\r\ntoward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\r\n\r\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\r\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\r\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\r\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\r\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\r\nand, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\r\ntemporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,\r\nI am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\r\n\r\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of\r\nexperience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.\r\nAnd judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct\r\nof the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with\r\nwhich  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.\r\nIs it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?\r\nTrust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves\r\nto be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our\r\npetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and\r\ndarken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\r\nreconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that\r\nforce must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,\r\nsir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to\r\nwhich kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\r\nits purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other\r\npossible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\r\nthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,\r\nshe has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.\r\nThey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British\r\nministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?\r\nShall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.\r\nHave we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the\r\nsubject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\r\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we\r\nfind which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,\r\ndeceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert\r\nthe storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\r\nwe have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have\r\nimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and\r\nParliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced\r\nadditional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;\r\nand we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!\r\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\r\nreconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free--\r\nif we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which\r\nwe have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\r\nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged\r\nourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest\r\nshall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!\r\nAn appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\r\n\r\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\r\nan adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,\r\nor the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\r\nguard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength by\r\nirresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance\r\nby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until\r\nour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make\r\na proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\r\nThe millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a\r\ncountry as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy\r\ncan send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\r\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will\r\nraise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the\r\nstrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,\r\nwe have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late\r\nto retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!\r\nOur chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!\r\nThe war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\r\nbut there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\r\nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\r\nOur brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\r\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,\r\nor peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\r\nForbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;\r\nbut as for me, give me liberty or give me death!",
