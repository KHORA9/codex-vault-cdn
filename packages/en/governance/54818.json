[Price 2 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n                           STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n\r\n       In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n             States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Life of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcDonald Clarke had the dyspepsia badly, and would board at the Graham\r\nHouse while his money lasted, and then Goss would request him to leave.\r\nAt the table he always created infinite mirth. I often met him on the\r\nBattery, (with his pockets filled with stale Graham bread,) and at\r\nMercer’s Dining Saloon, at the corner of Ann and Nassau, and on the\r\nsteps of the Astor, and while rapidly promenading Broadway, with his\r\neyes riveted on the ground. I also saw him every Sabbath in front of Dr.\r\nTaylor’s Grace Church, at the corner of Rector street and Broadway,\r\nwhere he used to await the arrival of Miss Jones, and almost stare her\r\ninto fits, and to whom he addressed such lines as these through the\r\npublic journals:\r\n\r\n        Her form’s elastic as a willow tree,\r\n        Glorious in motion, when the winds are free:\r\n        She moves with timid dignity and grace,\r\n        While thought is thrilling through her sweet young face.\r\n\r\nIn his last days, he often came to the Graham House, and Goss was very\r\nkind to him, and did not charge him for his meals. He called on Sunday\r\nmorning, when all were at church save myself. I was ill, in the rocking\r\nchair, and for an hour he amused me with his incoherent flights of\r\neloquence, and the recitation of his choicest poetry. He came several\r\ntimes during the week. On a stormy evening, while I was seated by the\r\nstove, he rushed in and took a seat beside me, and wept aloud, and spoke\r\nof his intense affection for Miss Jones, (the daughter of the wealthy\r\nBanker, and President of the Chemical Bank,) whom he supposed was\r\nardently in love with him. He said that he had been twice invited to her\r\nparties, but that on ringing the bell, he was twice ejected by the\r\nservant. The cards of invitation were forgeries, but those who imposed\r\non McDonald, assured him that they were genuine, and were written by\r\nMiss Jones. I strove in vain to disabuse McDonald’s mind, who said he\r\nshould make the third attempt the following week, and, if possible, he\r\nwould have an interview with the precious object of his affection. On\r\nthe afternoon of the following Sunday, he came to the Graham House, and\r\nviolently rang the bell, and dashed into the parlor, greatly excited,\r\nand took a seat on the sofa, where I was reclining, and exclaimed: “Why,\r\nBranch, people call me crazy. But you don’t think I’m crazy, do you,\r\nBranch? I know you don’t. You love me, don’t you, Branch? I know you do.\r\nHeigh ho! I’m not long for this world. I’m going to Heaven in a few\r\ndays, where I shall fare better than among the unkind people of this\r\nworld. Yes, I rambled through Greenwood, last week, by the Silver Lake,\r\nand selected the lovely and romantic spot where my poor bones will soon\r\nrepose and wither. (His tears now began to fall like summer rain.) And\r\nthere will be the sacred bells, and the Grace Church exercises,\r\nconducted by the pure and eloquent Dr. Taylor, and the mournful music,\r\nand solemn procession, and the Sexton’s dreary hearse and spade, and the\r\npale white monument. And those who now deny me bread, and call me crazy,\r\nand trifle with my affections, will then sadly miss me, and my beautiful\r\npoetry, and lament my melancholy fate. And they will come and stand\r\nbefore my monument in Greenwood’s Silver Dell, and weep, and profoundly\r\nregret that they always neglected poor McDonald Clarke. Yes, Branch, I\r\nsee my snowy monument by the Silver Lake, and I shall soon be there. O\r\nGod! Yes, I shall too soon be in that dismal vale. But you will come and\r\nsee me, won’t you, Branch? I know you will. I know you will, O God! O\r\nGod! My destiny is very hard.” And he buried his face with both hands,\r\nand cried with all the simplicity of childhood, and I strove to restrain\r\nmy tears, lest he would not cease his lamentation, if he saw my eyes\r\nmoistened with nature’s sympathising waters. And I breathed kind words\r\ninto his lacerated heart, and he leaned his head upon my shoulder, and\r\nwas silent for some minutes, when he sprang to his feet, and said he\r\nwould like a bath, and went to the bathing room. In half an hour, he\r\nreturned, went to the tea table, ate sparingly, came into the parlor,\r\nwent to the window, and knelt and prayed in whisper tones. The clouds\r\nhad suddenly dispersed, and the moon was full, whose soft rays rested on\r\nthe sad face of McDonald. He then got the Bible, and read a chapter, and\r\nwas absorbed in a second prayer, just above a whisper, when a transient\r\nboarder (from Boston) entered the parlor, and sat on the sofa, and began\r\na spirited conversation with a friend who had long been waiting for him.\r\nMcDonald, while engaged in prayer, in a kneeling posture, sprang to his\r\nfeet, and rushed towards the two gentlemen in lively conversation on the\r\nsofa, and told them that if they did not cease to laugh, and talk so\r\nloudly, he would smite them on the spot. They were amazed and terrified,\r\nand dared not speak. McDonald then rapidly paced the parlor, and\r\nexclaimed: “I am only 40 years old, with nearly half the period often\r\nallotted to man yet to run, and I am near my journey’s close.” And then,\r\nwith a sudden halt in the centre of the parlor, he again riveted his\r\nwild eyes on the gentlemen seated on the sofa, who had excited his ire,\r\nand stamped, and most violently exclaimed: “How dare you talk and laugh\r\nin God’s holy hour? This is the all-glorious Sabbath, and it is\r\nsacrilege to talk and laugh beyond a whisper. Do it again, and as sure\r\nas my name is McDonald Clarke, I will paralyse you where you sit.\r\nSilence, I say, (stamping,) silence!” The two gentlemen then arose, and\r\nleft the parlor, in pursuit of Mr. Goss, and McDonald went to the\r\nwindow, and delivered a glowing apostrophe to the moon and stars, and\r\nasked me to play sacred music on the piano, which I did, and he strove\r\nto sing, but his voice was severely weakened, and nearly lost, by his\r\nnervous excitement, and through his severe anathema of the two gentlemen\r\nwho had just left the parlor. As I played, he stood beside me, and\r\nhummed and beat time with his hands. I closed the piano, and he went to\r\nthe window, and prayed again, and breathed the most eloquent and\r\ntouching soliloquy I ever heard. Such melting pathos and purity of\r\nlanguage never flowed from human lips. He rose to the highest\r\ninspiration in his allusion to his departed mother, and his anticipated\r\njoy at his early reunion with her in Heaven. I have always regretted\r\nthat I had no pencil and paper on this sad occasion, so that I could\r\nhave preserved his supernatural soliloquies, which impressed me with the\r\nprofoundest solemnity. Mr. Goss now came into the parlor, and asked\r\nMcDonald where he boarded, and he said he had no home. Goss then asked\r\nhim if he had any friends. He said that James Gordon Bennett was his\r\nfriend, and had been kind and generous towards him, and had given him\r\nmoney and apparel, and published his poetry in the _Herald_. He also\r\nsaid that he ate, and sometimes slept, at a Dentist’s in Park Place, and\r\nthat he would now go there. I asked him if I should accompany him, and\r\nhe warmly thanked me, and he put on his cloak and cap, and very\r\ncarefully adjusted his large red comforter around his neck, and took my\r\narm, and I accompanied him to the residence of his dentist friend in\r\nPark Place. I rang the bell, and the servant came, and said the dentist\r\nwas out, and McDonald then shook my hand, and bade me an affectionate\r\ngood night, and walked in and closed the door, which was my last\r\ncommunion with poor McDonald Clarke. I called the next day, and the\r\nservant told me that McDonald left in half an hour after my departure on\r\nthe previous night, and had not returned. I went in pursuit of him, but\r\ncould not find him. The next I heard of him was through the newspapers,\r\nwhich stated that he was found at midnight, by a Policeman, in Broadway,\r\nnear St. Paul’s Church, in a terrible storm, and in a state of raving\r\ninsanity, with his apparel partially gone,—that he was conveyed to the\r\nTombs,—that neither the Policemen nor any of the officers at the Tombs\r\nknew McDonald, nor was he sane enough to disclose his name,—that on\r\ngoing to feed him in the morning, his place of confinement was partially\r\nfilled with icy water, (in which he was bathing himself,) which had been\r\nrunning all night, and which gave him a chill of death,—that he was\r\nfinally recognised by one of the Tombs’ officers, and conveyed to the\r\nAlms House Hospital, where he soon died. I called to see him before he\r\ndied, but he did not know me. His reason entirely returned just prior to\r\nhis death, when he called for a custard, (of which he was always\r\nextremely fond,) and he ate a little, and said he was glad his hour had\r\ncome, as he was tired of earth. He bade his nurse an affectionate\r\nfarewell, and died without a contortion or a moan. His sudden and pauper\r\ndeath produced great excitement, and the newspapers severely lashed his\r\nmurderers, who strove to make him think that Miss Jones loved him\r\ndearly, and had invited him to her aristocratic parties. But the names\r\nof the villains were not published, (as they should have been,) because\r\nthey belonged to the upper circles. Some kind friends erected a monument\r\nto his memory, on the very spot McDonald had selected, by the Silver\r\nLake in Greenwood, for which they received much praise. And thus closes\r\nmy sad allusion to poor McDonald Clarke.\r\n\r\n                   (To be continued to my last sun.)\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A Melodious Fragment!\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TO ALL WHO LOVE ENTRANCING MUSIC.\r\n\r\nREADER:—Did you ever behold the tumultuous excitement of the populace at\r\na Race Course, as the furious steeds neared the judge’s stand on the\r\nlast heat? Then go and see Gazzaniga’s reflection of the passions at the\r\nAcademy of Music, and behold the glow and palor, and joy and terror, and\r\nstamps and screams of the excited and enraptured multitudes. Did you\r\never see the moon emerge from a tranquil ocean, or the sun descend a\r\nwild horison? Then see Gazzaniga. Did you ever see a peerless virgin at\r\nthe altar, or on her journey to the sepulchre? Then see Gazzaniga. Do\r\nyou remember the merry laugh of childhood, or your fond mother’s gentle\r\ntones? Then see Gazzaniga. Do you lament Ophelia’s sadness and mournful\r\ndestiny, and the fatal grief of Portia at the absence of Brutus? Then\r\nsee Gazzaniga. Do you love the murmurs of the rivulet, or of summer\r\nzephyrs on the moonlight waters? Then see Gazzaniga. Do you love the\r\nmelody of the birds, and the hues of the pastures, and the romance of\r\nthe forest, and the perfume of the foliage, and the silence of the\r\nwilderness, and the beauty of the vales, and the majesty of the\r\nmountains? Then see Gazzaniga. Do you love the security of a calm, or\r\nthe sublimity of a storm? Then see Gazzaniga. Have you seen Niagara or\r\nVesuvius, and admired and trembled in their glorious and awful presence?\r\nThen see Gazzaniga. Have you read and dreamed of Antony and Cleopatra?\r\nThen see Brignoli and Gazzaniga. Have you read Cæsar’s hatred of Cassius\r\nand Horace Greeley, and his love of Matsell and fat men? Then see Ullman\r\nand Armodio. Do you love to roam in dells and caves and deserts? Do you\r\nlove the pensive meditations of genius in cavern solitudes? Do you love\r\nto gaze at Heaven’s Panorama, in the silence and glory of midnight? Do\r\nyou love your parent’s admonitions, and the sweet tones of your brothers\r\nand sisters, and wives and children? Do you remember your early love,\r\nand pleasant rambles with your devoted and beauteous Juliet? Do you love\r\nto witness the reflection of your own heart? Do you love to shed tears\r\nof joy at the triumph of the virtuous, and to paralyse the vicious with\r\nyour terrible execrations? Have you breathed Italian skies, and wandered\r\nby Italian streams, and fondly lingered on Italian sunsets? O then go\r\nand see and hear Gazzaniga, whose mighty soul reflects the smiles and\r\ntears—lovers and misanthropes—beauties and melodies—calms and\r\nstorms—rainbows and landscapes—plains and mountains—cataracts and\r\nvolcanoes—thunder and lightning—rain and hail—tornadoes and\r\nearthquakes—witches and angels—devils and demons—ghosts and hobgoblins,\r\nand suns and globes and caravans of Universal Nature. O Gazzaniga! Thy\r\ntranquil music is the echo of a Choir of Angels, and thy frenzied strain\r\nis the yell of a gang of devils. More than a thousand millions of human\r\npilgrims rove in the romantic paths of earth, but in all this mighty\r\nthrong, on its march to a common sepulchre, there is but one Gazzaniga\r\nin the delightful realms of melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                   NEW YORK, SATURDAY, JULY 3, 1858.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H. BRANCH’S “ALLIGATOR” CAN BE obtained at all hours, (day or\r\nnight,) at wholesale and retail, at No. 128 Nassau Street, Near Beekman\r\nStreet, and opposite Ross & Tousey’s News Depot, New York.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Human Devils.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome $10,000 have been expended in building fences, and improving the\r\nforest grounds at the corner of Fourteenth and Fifteenth streets and the\r\nSixth Avenue? We have received a card, heralding a “Palace Garden,”\r\nsigned by De Forest and Tisdale, Proprietors. Mr. De Forest was the\r\nTreasurer of the Crystal Palace Ball, and Mr. Tisdale is the Treasurer\r\nof the Hunter Woodis Benevolent Society. A few loaves of John Hecker’s\r\nbread, distributed among the poor, was the only charitable result of the\r\nAcademy of Music Ball, and none of John Hecker’s bread, nor of any\r\nbaker, nor any necessaries of life were distributed among the indigent,\r\nas the result of the mighty and lucrative Crystal Palace Ball. Both of\r\nthose Balls were given by the public—for the benefit of the Poor—in the\r\nname of the self-constituted members of the Hunter Woodis Society, and\r\nDe Forest and Tisdale, who control the vast receipts of that Society,\r\nnow open an Ice Cream and Lager Bier Saloon on a scale of unprecedented\r\nmagnitude and magnificence, while the poor creatures are starving, who\r\nown all the surplus funds in the vile grasp of the Hunter Woodis\r\nSociety, and of the outside scamps, who partially control those pauper\r\nfunds. De Forest and Tisdale (who thrice cunningly assured me that all\r\nthe members of the Hunter Woodis Society were Know Nothings) beckoned me\r\nlast week to their gorgeous chariot on Broadway, and told me that they\r\nwere “snags,” and through dagger eyes, and ferocious gestures, and\r\nstunning declamation, threatened my utter annihilation, for my recent\r\nexposure of their plunder of our generous citizens, and the private\r\npaupers, whose funds they withhold and squander. If one of the huge\r\nvillains of these devilish days in which my lot is cast approaches me\r\nwith menacing look or attitude, he will be a dead thief before he can\r\nimplore the God of truth and justice and mercy to forgive him for his\r\nawful crimes. Where the $40,000 that were doubtless received by the\r\nManagers and Treasurers of the Academy of Music and Crystal Palace\r\nBalls; and where their vast private collections have all mysteriously\r\nvanished, will never be disclosed to the poor of this, nor of coming\r\ngenerations, but, at the Throne of God, these consummate villains and\r\ninfernal scamps will have to confront the famishing creatures they have\r\nrobbed and starved, when they will be convicted, and condemned, and\r\nhurled from Heaven’s resplendent heights into a gulph of yelling devils,\r\nwho will pinch them, and prick them, and bite them, and lance them, and\r\nroast them through wasteless ages.\r\n\r\n                 O, what I hear, and what I see,\r\n                 Makes me from earth yearn to be free.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                James Gordon Bennett’s Editorial Career.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Bennett and John Kelly._\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—John, the wall cracked again yesterday, and I fear this old\r\nruin will soon fall, and bury us in death. So, after you have folded\r\nthose papers, you can take them and the broom, and I will take my\r\nmemorandum book and easy slippers, and we will go to the new quarters\r\nthat I hired yesterday in Broadway. The rent is very cheap, and I am not\r\nto pay it until the end of the month, which is a godsend in these days\r\nof poverty.\r\n\r\n_John_—I have only got fifty papers to fold, and I will soon be ready.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Hurry, Johnny, for the building may fall before we get out.\r\n(John folds papers mighty fast.)\r\n\r\n_John_—I am ready, sir.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Come on then. (They depart for Broadway, with all their\r\nluggage, consisting of fifty _Heralds_, a broom, memorandum book, and\r\nBennett’s easy slippers.)\r\n\r\n                           _Enter Landlord._\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—Mr. Bennett, I told you that you could pay your rent at the\r\nend of the month, but I have concluded to require it in advance.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I have not the money to spare, but I will let you have my\r\nwatch as security.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—I have no pawnbroker’s license, and I fear it would be a\r\nviolation of the law to take a watch in pawn.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I have let Anderson & Ward have it as security for the payment\r\nof my papers some fifty times, and they have not been arrested.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—Is it gold or silver?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Silver.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—What is its value?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—Does it keep good time?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—It goes well, don’t it, Johnny (giving him a wink.)\r\n\r\n_John_—Yes, sir. (May God forgive me for this lie.)\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—I will take it, but you must try to pay the rent before the\r\nclose of the month.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I will, sir. Our circulation is rapidly increasing, ain’t it,\r\nJohnny?\r\n\r\n_John_ (pale as death)—Y-e-s, s-i-r. (O, Heavenly Father, do forgive me\r\nfor another lie.)\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—Good day, Mr. Bennett, and may success attend your\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Good by, sir, but don’t call again until the very last week in\r\nthe month.\r\n\r\n_Landlord_—I will be as lenient as I can. Good day. (He goes.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—John, why did you say y-e-s, s-i-r? This is no time to drawl\r\nyour words. And I saw your lips quiver, and your eyes and arms directed\r\nto Heaven, as though you were engaged in silent prayer. This won’t do,\r\nsir. My case is desperate. Can’t you lie, in matters of business,\r\nwithout invoking the celestial pardon? If you can’t, you will soon ruin\r\nme. What say you, John?\r\n\r\n_John_—My parents will not let me tell lies. They would kill me, if they\r\ncaught me in the two lies I have told for you to-day. They are extremely\r\nindigent, but they are as honest as poor Burns, the great poet of your\r\nnative land, who said:\r\n\r\n                  “The honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor,\r\n                  Is king o’ men for a’ that.”\r\n\r\nAnd who also said:\r\n\r\n                  “O, wad some Pow’r the giftie gie us\r\n                  To see oursels as ithers see us!”\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (stamping the floor)—Darm it, boy, this is no time for poetry.\r\nHang Burns, who was an old fool, and lived on air, like all the poets. I\r\nprefer Richard, who said:\r\n\r\n                      “I have set my life upon a cast,\r\n                And I will stand the hazard of the die.”\r\n\r\nOr Iago:\r\n\r\n                                “This is the night,\r\n              That either makes me, or fordoes me quite.”\r\n\r\nOr Ophelia, with whose beautiful aphorism I closed my leading editorial,\r\nin the first number of the _Herald_:\r\n\r\n                     “Lord, we know that we are,\r\n                     But know not what we may be.”\r\n\r\nBut darm the rhyme. We want bread and butter. I have been starving on\r\ntruth and poetry, and I intend to lie, and cheat, and black mail, during\r\nthe residue of my days. Do you understand me?\r\n\r\n_John_—Yes, sir, but I can’t lie. I had rather be poor, and tell the\r\ntruth, than lie, and cheat, and wrong my fellow creatures, and be\r\nloathed by my parents, and be despised by myself, and by others, and\r\nhave sleepless nights, and be in constant fear of death, and be in\r\ndanger of a prison or the scaffold. So, you had better get another boy.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I am sorry to part with you, dear Johnny, because you have\r\nbeen so true and kind to me.\r\n\r\n_John_—I would like to remain, but I must leave, if you require me to\r\nlie. And yet I dread to inform my poor father and mother that I have\r\nleft you, and have no means to aid them. But I had rather go hungry than\r\ntell lies, and I hope and believe that my parents will forgive me for\r\nleaving you.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I fear you are too conscientious to be my associate in the\r\nreckless and unscrupulous career of journalism before me, and therefore\r\nI shall advertise for another boy to-morrow.\r\n\r\n_John_—Very well, sir. (John takes his hat to go.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Don’t go until I get another boy.\r\n\r\n_John_—I must go now, because you have proclaimed yourself a dishonest\r\nman, and I should be unhappy if I remained longer in your presence.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—How much do I owe you?\r\n\r\n_John_—Nothing.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Yes I do.\r\n\r\n_John_—You can have it, because I fear you did not get it honestly, and\r\nI do not want it. (John goes.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (soliloquises)—This boy’s rebuke is terrible. And now I am\r\nalone. O God! if I only had his integrity, I would make any sacrifice.\r\nThat boy has got the principles of Washington in his breast, and the\r\nworld will hear of him. No earthly power can crush the love of truth in\r\nthe heart of that dear little boy. And now what shall I do? His merited\r\ncastigation has unnerved and unmanned me. I know not which way to turn.\r\nI have but little money. I cannot get another boy so faithful as Johnny.\r\nI must strive to sell my papers in the stores alone, now that Johnny is\r\ngone, and, if I fail, I am forever ruined. But this won’t do. I must not\r\ndespair. I must rally. (He arises, and paces his office rapidly, with\r\ncompressed jaws and lips, and distended nostrils, and clenched fingers,\r\nand ferocious gesticulation.) I must not whine now. I must cut and\r\nsmash, and detract and terrify the innocent, and levy thousands on the\r\naffluent, or I am forever lost. I have no associate, nor friend, nor\r\nkindred in all this land, and I can only degrade myself, as my aged\r\nparents are in the deep mountain glades of Scotland, and can never hear\r\nof my degradation. So I will be a devil. I will advertise for another\r\nboy, and if I get one who will conspire with me in my contemplated\r\nvillainy, my fortunes will yet be vast. (He writes an advertisement, and\r\nputs it in the _New York Sun_.)\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Peter Cooper’s Funny little Grocery-Groggery, at the Corner of the\r\n                Bowery and Stuyversant Street, in 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PETER BEHIND THE COUNTER.\r\n\r\n                        _Enter Female Customer._\r\n\r\n_Customer_—I want two candles, and a quart of soft soap, and a pint of\r\ngin.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—There’s the candles, and there’s the soap, and now I will get\r\nthe gin. (Measures it.) And there’s the gin.\r\n\r\n_Customer_—Put it all down on the book.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—I will only put it on the slate, as I want you to pay me by\r\nSaturday evening.\r\n\r\n_Customer_—O, certainly. (She goes.)\r\n\r\n                         _Enter Jim, a Darkey._\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Mr. Cooper, I want a plug of tobacco, and a glass of rum, and I\r\nwill pay you on Saturday night, when I get my week’s wages.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—I can’t trust any more to-day, as I have just let a woman have\r\nsome candles, soap, and gin on credit, and I shall ruin myself if I\r\ntrust so much as I have recently. My capital is very small, and my\r\ncredit is so bad that I have to pay cash for nearly all I buy, and if I\r\ntrust much, I shall have to fail again, and shut up my little shop for\r\never. So, Jim, I can’t trust you any more.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Then I will trade elsewhere. I have been drinking your rum for a\r\nlong time, and I have always paid you for it, and I have got drunk many\r\na time on your rum, and now you won’t let me have a glass on credit. You\r\nmust have an iron heart.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Jim, you have drunk a large quantity of rum at my bar, and you\r\nhave always paid me for it, as you declare, but I am going to turn over\r\na new leaf, and trust no more. But if you will promise never to ask me\r\nto trust you again, I will let you have as nice a glass of rum as you\r\never drank.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Agreed.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—(pours out some cheap and nasty rum, and squats down behind the\r\ncounter so that Jim can’t see him, and adulterates it about two-thirds\r\nwith old Manhattan water, that had been in the pitcher all day)—There’s\r\nyour rum, Jim, and now drink it, and enjoy yourself.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—(drinks, and can hardly taste the nasty rum, and makes wry\r\nfaces,)—How much bilge water did you put in this mean rum, and how much\r\ndo you intend to put down on the slate against me for this disgusting\r\ndose of rum and water?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—That is nice rum, Jim, and I shall charge you my usual price of\r\nthree cents a glass.\r\n\r\n_Jim_—Take that, and that, and that, you stingy old villain. (Throws\r\nmost of the rum and water into his face, and strikes him twice, and\r\nknocks him down, and runs down the Bowery.)\r\n\r\n_Peter_ (solus and nose bleeding profusely)—I fear the black rascal has\r\nbroken my nose and ribs, and blackened my eyes badly. I will close the\r\nshop, and go and see a physician, and I suppose I shall have to run up\r\nquite a Doctor’s bill before my wounds are entirely healed. (Shuts the\r\nshop and goes to an Apothecary.)\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Doctor, nigger Jim has just struck me several times with all his\r\nmight, and I fear he has mutilated me for life. Just examine my nose and\r\nribs, Doctor, and dress my nose and eyes as soon as possible, so that\r\nthey will soon heal.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Why did Jim strike you?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Well, Doctor, he wanted some rum on credit, and because I\r\nhesitated, and finally gave him some very poor rum (rather freely\r\nadulterated), to get rid of him, he got angry, and threw the rum and\r\nwater in my face, and then most cruelly beat me.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Mr. Cooper, why don’t you stop selling rum, and especially to\r\nsuch low characters as nigger Jim?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O, I can’t stop selling rum, as I make more profit on that than\r\nany thing else. In fact, it is nearly all profit, if properly and\r\njudiciously adulterated.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—But don’t you impoverish and degrade and render vicious all to\r\nwhom you sell your poisonous alcohol, and expose their wives and\r\nchildren to all the horrors of poverty, and the brutal ferocity and\r\ninsanity of a drunken father?\r\n\r\n_Peter_—O, I don’t know any thing about all that. All I know, as a\r\nbusiness man, is, that I get a mighty large profit on my rum, and if my\r\ncustomers get drunk, and abuse and starve their families, and commit\r\ntheft or murder, that is their fault, and I shall not be responsible for\r\nit here, nor hereafter.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—I fear you view this matter altogether in the light of\r\nselfishness.\r\n\r\n_Peter_ (terribly cornered)—Doctor, no more of this. I have come to have\r\nyou examine and dress my wounds, and if you can’t do it, without a\r\ntedious homily on temperance, I will go to the other Apothecary, down\r\nthe Bowery, who has long been your rival, and would like the job mighty\r\nwell. (This was a clincher, and smashed the Doctor’s impregnable\r\nposition.)\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—That is all true, Mr. Cooper, and I will discharge my painful\r\nduty. Here, Samuel, bring me some warm water. (Washes Peter’s bloody\r\nnose and dark eyes, and dresses them. He then feels of his bruised ribs,\r\nand finds them unbroken, though very sore and inflamed.)\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Doctor, what is your charge?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Business is very dull now, and your rival Apothecary, down the\r\nBowery, would not have charged more than twenty cents. Can’t you take\r\ntwenty, Doctor?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Twenty will do, if you will promise to come again, when nigger\r\nJim beats you.\r\n\r\n_Peter_ (very slightly blushes)—I will certainly come again, when I have\r\nany more business in the Apothecary line. (Gives the Doctor an old\r\npistareen, and departs, with poultices and bandages over his eyes and\r\nnose.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SUNDAY EVENING.\r\n\r\n_Peter’s Groggery full of political strikers and vagabonds and criminals\r\n  of every hue—A primary election to come off early in the morning._\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Now, boys, I want you to put me through to-morrow.\r\n\r\n_Thieves_—We will—we will.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—If you will, I’ll give you all the most glorious drunk you have\r\nhad since the last election.\r\n\r\n_Head Thief_—We will elect a majority of our friends to the Convention,\r\nand you may regard your nomination as sure.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—Give me your hand on that delightful news, and now, boys, what\r\nare you going to drink? As it is Sunday evening, and as some of the\r\nstiff old deacons will soon be coming by on their way to Church, I will\r\nclose my shop doors, and then we will all sit down, and drink and smoke\r\nuntil daylight appears, so that you can be earlier than our adversaries\r\nat the polls, and put in a handful or two of ballots before the polls\r\nopen. What say you?\r\n\r\n_Jack_ (one of the primary inspectors)—Go it, Peter,—you are the boy for\r\nme. I put in a large handful of ballots with your name on them half an\r\nhour since.\r\n\r\n_Peter_—That’s the talk, my lad. I will remember you for that, if I’m\r\nelected. (Closes the doors, and brings jug of rum.) Now, boys, fill\r\nyourselves to your throats with rum, and in the mean time, I’ll get some\r\ncrackers and cheese.\r\n\r\n_Thieves_ (all drink like fish while Peter is after the crackers and\r\ncheese.)\r\n\r\n                   (To be continued for a long time.)\r\n\r\n\r\nT.
