This became more apparent as work\r\non the second number progressed. Reproductions foreign to the vital\r\nIndian cause were given precedence over \"fighting\" originality; and when\r\nthe Wolf =howled=, he was summarily =bounced= by the Fox, who then assumed\r\nfull control as both manager and editor.\r\n\r\nThe contribution by =Hal-ish Ho-sat=: Klickitat for \"Old Wolf\"; was the\r\nfirst of a series of hitherto unpublished legends of the Yakimas and\r\nkindred tribes contemplated for the =Tepee=. This, with some editorials,\r\none or two incomplete, were retained and made use of, while the\r\n=Discards=, a few in galley proof, were returned to me. The editorial\r\nexplanation of my severance with the =Tepee= was in bad taste and my own\r\ncard was censored to suit the drawing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Wolf was too strenuous and the =Discards= had no place in =The\r\nTepee's= pages. Doubtless the Manager will receive laudation from certain\r\nelements for his action; but believing it good at times that the public\r\nbe made acquainted with disagreeable facts, such as contained in some of\r\nthese rejects, they are here offered as mere samples of far reaching\r\nconditions. If \"Elasticity of Indian Bureau Promises\" appear unworthy of\r\ncredence, there are the abandoned allotments, parched and dry, still in\r\nevidence, as well as voluminous correspondence on file in the Indian\r\nDepartment. The pie from the Indian Bureau bakery may look appetizing\r\nand palatable on the printed menu. Lift the crust! then--shield your\r\nnose as you watch 'em crawl. The \"consideration\" from the honest\r\nbusiness man for Poor Lo's heritage ofttimes shows glitteringly\r\nmunificent. Insert the probe! gilded illusion--\"mess of pottage\"--vermin\r\ninfested and stenchful.\r\n\r\nAnd all this under a Government of the people ($), by the people ($$)\r\nand for the people ($$$).\r\n\r\n                                         =He-mene Ka-wan=: \"Old Wolf\".\r\n                                                    (L. V. McWhorter).\r\n\r\n  July 23, 1920\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_That \"Same Old Howl\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the Yakimas are wondering how long it takes the Indian\r\nDepartment to make good a promise. Tribesmen have waited vainly the\r\nyears for a consummation of pledges made, while others, sore at heart\r\nand foot weary have passed over the Last Trail with thoughts embittered\r\nby the memory of wanton indifference, if not actual connivance of the\r\nDepartment officials in the brazen robberies which they have suffered.\r\nUgly, sombre facts have been unearthed in the no distant past, while\r\nothers are incubating for an unsavory hatching.\r\n\r\nFraudulent land deals and theft of irrigation waters are common\r\ncomplaints. The riparian right to water established by long usage, is a\r\njoke when applied to the Indian. During the vital irrigation period of\r\nMay, present year, the editor personally looked into conditions of one\r\nIndian ditch on the Ahtanum. Three Indian allottees, Louis Mann, William\r\nAdams and Joe Yemowat, dependent in part upon this ditch, had not been\r\nable to obtain a drop of water, while white renters above them had been\r\nreceiving a full flow for a month. Mr. Clyde Stevens, a heavy renter,\r\nhad \"soaked\" a forty acre field the second time, while two other renters\r\nwere getting water galore. In one instance a secret way was discovered\r\ntaking a heavy flow. In marked contrast to the luxuriant crops on these\r\nlands, were those of the Indians, parched and withered. While the Indian\r\nDepartment has no jurisdiction over the distribution of the water in\r\nthis particular ditch it =does= have jurisdiction over the leased lands\r\nand has the power to evict any undesirable tenant. Why does it allow a\r\nwater-hog to fatten at the expense of those whom it holds in its iron\r\ngrasp? If the Injun \"hollers\" he is branded as a troublesome complainer\r\nand peace disturber. Intimidated and helpless, he suffers deep wrongs in\r\nstolid silence. A husky, in an altercation with one of the looters in\r\nquestion, took unreasonable abuse rather than come to blows. When asked\r\nwhy he did this, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of him--the shrimp. I could break him in two. It is his\r\nlaw that I am afraid of. I know what an Injun would get in court. I have\r\na family to live for. Our Agent is supposed to protect us in our rights.\r\nHe does nothing. He knows that the white man has no right to the water\r\nin this, our Injun ditch. He knows that it is being stolen from us. This\r\nwhite water thief is protected. He says that Mr. Carr is a fine man. Of\r\ncourse he should speak well of Mr. Carr. Look at this water thief's\r\ncrop, this Mr. Stevens and others. They are fine while our crops are\r\nscorched for water. When only Injuns were on this ditch we had no\r\ntrouble. All got water, dividing with each other. I was driven from the\r\nMedicine Valley country because Mr. Reece B. Brown stole all my water\r\neleven years ago. The Indian Department knew of it, but the Department\r\nis afraid of Mr. Brown or stands in with him in that grab. I came over\r\nhere on the Ahtanum to farm and now they steal my water here. The\r\n=Shoyahpoo= is a hog. He takes all and squeals for more.\"\r\n\r\nIt takes no careful observer to ride through the Ahtanum Reservation\r\nlands and pick out the Indian tilled lands from those of white owners\r\nand lessors. The former invariably present a withered appearance, while\r\nthose of the whites show fine crops, resultant from sufficient water.\r\nThere may be exceptions to this rule, but the cases are few. One fair\r\nminded white man said, when questioned:\r\n\r\n\"The Indians get the dirty end of the water deal. The ditch tender has\r\nlands leased down near the lower end of the canal. He has, so he was\r\nheard to say, now finished irrigating his crops for the present, and\r\nturned his water to the orchards owned by whites. It is not right to\r\nhave an interested man distributing this water.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: =LOUIS CHARLES MANN=\r\n\r\n  Recognized Head of the Ahtanum Clan of Yakimas. From \"The Crime Against\r\n  the Yakimas.\" (Copyrighted)]\r\n\r\nMr. Lew Perkins is Ditch Tender for the Ahtanum section in controversy.\r\nHis crops on Indian leased lands show that they have suffered no dearth\r\nof water this season. It is hard to conceive that the Indian officials\r\nare blind to conditions so openly apparent. In 1916 the Ahtanum\r\nsituation, the gross injustice suffered by these Indians in stolen water\r\nrights, was exposed in an illustrated article in an eastern journal of\r\n30,000 copies, under the caption: =The Continued Crime Against The\r\nYakimas=. Promises from the powers that be was the only result. Louis\r\nMann was referred to by Mr. Dorrington, Indian Inspector, as: \"Howling\r\nthe same old howl that he has put up for ten years.\" Does it redound to\r\nthe credit of the Indian Department that one of its Wards should howl\r\nvainly for simple justice even for one year? Apropos to this question is\r\nthe following letter. Mr. L. M. Holt is Chief Engineer, Indian\r\nReclamation Service. Mr. Lee referred to is Supervisor of Ditches for\r\nthe Yakima Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n    L. M. Holt,                       Yakima, Wash., July 6th, 1920\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. Holt:\r\n\r\n    I have been deprived from my irrigation waters, my neighbors\r\n    steal my water and I have been studying where to make my report\r\n    to, as you have all grades of employees on this irrigation\r\n    system. As there is earth without water no living man can farm\r\n    his dry lands in the Spring, and the white man has no better\r\n    system in his body or being he is no better than I am why I\r\n    write you so because he dies just the same as poor Injuns die so\r\n    therefore I see why you turn all the water for his side and\r\n    leave us destitute helpless. Do you be satisfied if I go up to\r\n    the head gate and burst up the head gate and get my share of\r\n    this irrigation waters for my crops. Is the white man looking\r\n    for war path about this irrigation system? I am all time\r\n    wondering where all these white people came from. They must have\r\n    come where people are starving and they grab everything they\r\n    come to. Where did they come from any way, from above the clouds\r\n    or from hell? This puzzles me. Everything they want to\r\n    themselves, and they are hogging all the time. Their hunger for\r\n    more money is not filled; they all time want more, and as I hear\r\n    them often say \"Damn the Indians\" now, but where them white\r\n    devils go when they do die, and who is the man on this earth can\r\n    tell me I lie. Oh, no, I have been studying these subject for\r\n    many years, white man ways of living is no good to me, I hate it\r\n    but I cannot help it, as every year I am fussing about this\r\n    irrigation system. Now the earth and water is all time here, but\r\n    me, I shall be gone where everybody go time they do die, and I\r\n    want to live right while living, now I am losing 5 acres in\r\n    wheat and 6 acres in alfalfa, now who can protect my rights\r\n    about this irrigation system. You want cash down every time and\r\n    from the start my irrigation waters been cut short all time. Now\r\n    I have six seven rows, that is all for my $60.00 and how do you\r\n    expect any man to be a farmer that way. It seems to me the\r\n    government is robbing me out of my money. I want to find out who\r\n    is the man betrayed my rights on this irrigation system on this\r\n    Ahtanum creek. Since all the Ahtanum creek is a reservation\r\n    stream all the creek is ours in first place, and Secretary\r\n    Garfield robbed us time he gave our water to the whites at the\r\n    Ahtanum Academy. White ladies sang a song to him for more Hiyou\r\n    Chuck. Was this fine scheme and now we are robbed today. Who\r\n    will help us out. Mr. Lee has power to rob us out of our\r\n    irrigation system, he is the man told the head gate man to shut\r\n    off. I learn this from one of my white man friends. I remember\r\n    one time of seeing Mr. Lee at old man Seluskin house time he\r\n    told the old man Seluskin he was a man from Washington, D. C. to\r\n    help the Indians on this reservation on the irrigation system,\r\n    now this day this very same man is no help to us Injuns. I am\r\n    not mad at him when I write you this. Now this irrigation system\r\n    is too far beyond the law, don't you take me for a bunch of\r\n    Coyotes. Look out, do what is right. I am a person just the same\r\n    as whites are: we all live by eating same food, and I want to be\r\n    in a right living while living on this earth. I was there in\r\n    your office twice but you was gone. I want to see you but I do\r\n    not know when. I shall see what can be done toward protecting\r\n    our irrigation system on this Ahtanum valley, and you know this\r\n    earth and water was here and thereon it was the Injuns, and this\r\n    will be all.\r\n\r\n                              I am your truly poor friend,\r\n\r\n                                                         LOUIS MANN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a substance of fact no white man has a right to any of the water from\r\nthis Indian ditch, yet year after year the thefts go on unpunished. Is\r\nit any wonder that the Indian has learned to look upon the Agent as a\r\nconniver with the white man to loot and despoil him of his own? The\r\nlame excuse that such things go on unknown to the Indian officials is to\r\nbe taken with a mountain of allowance. These Ahtanum Indians have for\r\nyears clamored for justice, and have in turn been branded by the\r\ninspectors as \"howlers.\" Such treatment makes Bolshevik and I. W. W. of\r\nwhite people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elasticity of Indian Bureau Promises_\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This article was added to after discardure by the =Tepee=.\r\n\r\nThere is an unmistakable national wide agitation looking to the complete\r\nabolition of the Indian Bureau. The insistent outcry of the Indian\r\nagainst flagrant injustice suffered at the hands of this political\r\nincubus with its army of 7,000 employees, is reaching the rank and file\r\nof the people and already the Czars are visioning the handwriting on the\r\nwall. But as yet the masses know practically nothing about reservation\r\nconditions, know nothing about the inner workings of the Agencies, know\r\nnothing about the blundering incompetency if not down-right dishonesty\r\nof many of the acting officials. Methods employed in letting grazing\r\npermits to outside stockmen, leasing of agricultural lands and the\r\ndistribution of irrigation water, too often appear shady and\r\nquestionable. On the Yakima Reservation, Wash., water rights of long\r\nstanding have been ignored, the entire flow of Indian constructed canals\r\nseized upon, confiscated by the Department or openly stolen by\r\nunprincipled scoundrels who apparently have a stand in with the \"higher\r\nups.\" Why foster a Bureau which will tolerate and countenance such\r\nbrazen and uncovered thievery of the only means by which an Indian can\r\nmake use of his lands? A Bureau under which apparently a rich and\r\npowerful \"System\" has sprung up and is operating. A single case:\r\n\r\nNear White Swan, nine Indian eighty acre allotments were receiving water\r\nfrom a ditch of their own construction, tapping Medicine Valley. Indian\r\nhomes were established on all these tracts, each irrigating from ten to\r\nsixty acres. Some had planted small orchards, others were gardening and\r\nraising grain. About eleven years ago, one Reece B. Brown bought at a\r\nlow figure the Umtouch allotment on the west, the first receiving water\r\nfrom the ditch. Mr. Brown, who has been connected with divers\r\nlitigations connected with Reservation deals, boldly appropriated (?)\r\nall the water from the lower eight allotments, diverting it to his own\r\nland which was planted to orchard. The Agent knew of the\r\n\"appropriation.\" He did nothing--for the Indians. I personally called\r\nthe attention of the Acting Engineer of the Indian Reclamation Service\r\nto the robbery. An \"investigator\" looked the situation over. Looked, and\r\nnothing more. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs was appealed to. An\r\ninvestigation and promises--nothing more. The aid of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior was invoked. An \"investigation\" and more promises--nothing\r\nmore. In 1913 I was told by Superintendent Carr that suit had been\r\ninstituted in the Federal Court for the recovery of this water, and a\r\nsubsequent letter from the Assistant Indian Commissioner in reply to an\r\ninquiry, stated that such suit was \"pending.\" The case has never\r\nprogressed beyond this \"pending\" stage. Evidently the \"pending\" cord was\r\nmost carefully selected for its stretching and wearing qualities. Is the\r\nIndian Bureau a party to the crime? Or is it only afraid of the reputed\r\nmillionaire water \"appropriator\"? So far the \"investigations\" have all\r\nbeen conducted by the Indian Bureau officials only. Will a higher\r\ntribunal be invoked before another Planting Moon shall have arrived?\r\n\r\nIn 1916 a very full account of this most disgusting affair was given by\r\nme in an eastern journal of 30,000 copies, under the caption: =The\r\nContinued Crime Against The Yakimas=. This brought out a feeble renewal\r\nof never-to-be-kept-promises from the Department. Water by the Wapato\r\nCanal would cover these lands \"next year\" in any event. Several \"next\r\nyears\" have passed and these lands are still powder-dry, while the\r\norchards planted on the Umtouch allotment have flourished and brought\r\nreturns, nourished by stolen water. The other eight allotments are also\r\nproducing--fine second growth desert sage. The houses are tumbling to\r\ndecay, the fencing in some instances disappearing beneath the drifting\r\nsand dunes--fitting monument to the cowardly, vacillating policy of an\r\nobsolete Bureau.\r\n\r\nOf late the Department has ignored all local letters touching Brown's\r\nseizure of the Indian water and the \"pending\" suit, but goaded and\r\ncornered by a Boston philanthropist, the Hon. Cato Sells while not\r\nconceding a crime, has agreed that the water \"diminished\" in that\r\nparticular ditch; but points pridefully to Departmental activity in\r\nbringing water to the lands \"this season\" by the Wapato Canal; or by the\r\nstorage system of Medicine Valley or Toppenish Creek \"next year.\" Nay\r\nmore! another \"investigation\" by Supt. Carr and Federal District\r\nAttorney, Francis H. Garrecht, actually took place in a Yakima hotel\r\nlobby last spring, where it was found that: \"Differences of opinion\r\nbetween white settlers and Indians regarding Water rights along Medicine\r\nCreek have arisen;\" and that \"it is probable that cases which have\r\nalready been in court will again have to come up for adjudication.\"\r\nLater in response to an inquiry, Mr. Garrecht intimates that some time\r\nand some where some body may be summoned to give testimony in a possible\r\nsuit against the Reservation Water Hog.\r\n\r\nDuring all these weary years, the Indians, who have not died, have been\r\nbuoyed up by these worthless and hollow promises of \"water next year;\"\r\ninducing some of them, especially Luke Wappet, to repeatedly plant\r\nfields only to meet with disappointment and loss of both seed and labor.\r\nWappet had sixty acres under cultivation until Brown stole the Indian\r\nditch dry. Last spring I saw him toiling on a ditch hoping to bring\r\nwater from another source, but met with failure. His wheat crop withered\r\nand blasted as on former occasions.\r\n\r\nForty acres of Simon Goudy's allotment lies just east of the Wappet\r\ntract, and on the extreme tail of the looted Medicine Valley ditch.\r\nGoudy had this north forty under cultivation, now returned to desert\r\nsage and weeds. Instead of this land being covered by the Wapato Canal\r\nas repeatedly promised, the waterway has been constructed along the east\r\nline of his ranch, which irrigates from the west. Goudy cannot irrigate\r\nthe fraction of an acre from this \"bring-water-to-you-next-year\" canal.\r\nNot only this, but the canal embankment completely closes all avenue of\r\nescape for waste water from his south forty acres, heretofore utilized\r\nby his neighbor, Simon George, Indian, whose land adjoins him on the\r\neast. Simon George received his water through Goudy's lateral, which was\r\nsevered by the canal. The flimsy, half-sized flume constructed over the\r\ncanal by the Indian Service for the purpose of a waterway, broke down\r\nwithin a few hours after water had been turned into it. Mr. George was\r\ncompelled to rebuild the flume, enlarging it to capacity at his own\r\nexpense. His loss in damaged crops because of this delay was not\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: =SIMON GEORGE REBUILDING WORTHLESS FLUME PLACED BY INDIAN\r\n  SERVICE ACROSS WAPATO CANAL=\r\n\r\n  Showing the Embankments of the Canal Which Completely Bars the Escape of\r\n  Simon Goudy's Waste Water]\r\n\r\nApproximately four acres of Goudy's land was taken by the canal right of\r\nway, soil being appropriated even beyond the fenced limits, leaving the\r\nsurface so lowered as to swamp and become worthless. For this right of\r\nway, Goudy received not one dollar for either ground or damages\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nRunning midway from west to east through Goudy's allotment is the dry\r\nbed of a small creek, which carries water contingent only on the\r\nheaviest snows of winter. The Wapato Canal completely blocks this water\r\nway, but a gap has been left in the west, or near embankment for the\r\npurpose of permitting any possible flow of the creek to enter the canal.\r\nThis of course allows the canal to empty into the dry bed, filling it to\r\nwithin a few hundred feet of Goudy's west line. This former dry\r\ndepression, which Goudy always kept free from waste water, is thus\r\nconverted into a veritable lagoon, unfordable and which in time will\r\ndevelop into a mosquito-breeding, willow-grown swamp.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy irrigates his south forty acres from the Paiute Ditch, which\r\nwas constructed by Indians under the supervision of James H. Wilbur,\r\nAgent, for the Paiute prisoners of war brought to the Yakima Reservation\r\nat the close of the Bannock uprising in 1878. The Paiutes running away,\r\nthe ditch was turned over to the Yakimas by Agent Wilbur, and has been\r\nused by them unmolested during the intervening forty one years. Mr.\r\nGoudy built his own lateral more than a quarter of a century ago. This\r\nyear, during the vital irrigating season of May, three several \"ditch\r\ntenders\" called upon him, ordering him not to use such a volume of\r\nwater, although water was running waste down the main creek bed. The\r\nIndian refused to obey the injunction. It appeared to him that it was\r\nnot enough that he had been despoiled of water for half of his ranch by\r\na seemingly upheld thief, but the Government was now bent on ruining, or\r\nconfiscating his remaining water supply. The danger point had been\r\nreached and the \"ditch tenders\" were afterwards conspicuous by their\r\nabsence on the Goudy lateral. Perhaps the \"tenders\" had a vision of an\r\noutraged Indian with a Winchester near that same spot on a former\r\noccasion, when the foreman of the railroad construction gang suddenly\r\nrealized that his health was in jeopardy should he insist too\r\nstrenuously on entering Goudy's field before settlement of right of way\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: =SIMON GOUDY, Allottee=\r\n\r\n  Robbed of His Medicine Valley Ditch Eleven Years Ago, 40 Acres of His\r\n  Ranch, Where Once He Harvested 892 Sacks of Fine Wheat, Is Now, Thanks\r\n  to Indian Bureau Efficiency, a Desert Waste of Drifting Sands and\r\n  Useless Sage.]\r\n\r\nAs stated, Mr. Goudy has no outlet for his waste drainage, and about\r\nfour acres of growing wheat and alfalfa became flooded in consequence.\r\nThis he saved by cutting the canal bank, the overflow escaping through\r\nthe vent. Earlier in the season and before irrigation, I had, at the\r\ninstance of Mr. Goudy, called the attention of the Indian Service\r\nEngineer, Mr. L. M. Holt, to the fact that Mr. Goudy had not been\r\nprovided with an outlet for his waste flow; and the reply was: \"We do\r\nnot expect him to have any waste water.\" It was not known at that time\r\nthat an attempt would be made to curtail his Paiute source of water.\r\n\r\nThus we see how Simon Goudy, allottee, has been damaged thousands of\r\ndollars, as land values are computed in that section, how he has\r\nsuffered not only at the hands of an unrestrained water-thief, but also\r\nfrom the very Bureau officials sworn to protect him in his vested rights\r\nas a Ward of the Government. He recalls bitterly how he was refused\r\npatent for his south forty acres when the White Swan branch of the N. P.\r\nRailroad was under construction, when he thought by realizing on it as a\r\ntown site. Soon after he was waited on by a committee of \"business men\"\r\nwho assured him that they could easily obtain the coveted patent for\r\nhim, provided he first contract the land to them. Now, that there is no\r\nlonger an opportunity to realize on it as a town site, he is importuned\r\nby the Bureau to accept a patent and become a full fledged citizen\r\nof--his own native land.\r\n\r\nCan the most prejudiced of \"Indian haters\" find excuse for the treatment\r\naccorded Simon Goudy by the Indian Department? And yet there are other\r\npotential facts which would lend color to Goudy's contention that he has\r\nincurred the divine displeasure of the Bureau officials and has been\r\nsingled out as an object of dirt and spite. As incredulous as this may\r\nseem there are grounds for the conjecture. Petty annoyances and\r\ndiscriminations suffered by Goudy are many and manifold. The Agency\r\nthrasher has more than once refused to thrash his crop until all others\r\nwere attended to. Last year it passed and repassed his stack yard,\r\ncompelling him at additional cost of time and money to procure another\r\nmachine lest his grain damage by possible rain as on a former occasion.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Goudy is not the only allottee to suffer by this\r\n\"past-all-understanding\" methods of the Indian Service. There are other\r\nYakimas on the Paiute Ditch. Louis Mann has two inherited eighties below\r\nthe Goudy lateral and this year has experienced unlooked for trouble.\r\nThe Wapato Canal carries water to the Paiute, and a charge has been\r\nlevied against the water users. The Agency claims that not more than one\r\nfifth of the water used is now supplied by the Paiute source, but a\r\nfairer estimate would place it at one half. The Indians contend that\r\nthey have always had sufficient water from the Paiute alone, that the\r\nIndian Service has seized upon their forty-one year-old ditch without\r\ntheir knowledge or consent, and are now charging them for water which\r\nthey can not get in sufficient quantity for their crops. Personal\r\nobservation discloses the astounding fact that the head gate of the Mann\r\nlateral is under lock and key, that the intake is at a very low\r\npressure, affording a water supply inadequate for the crops planted, and\r\nnot on par with the money demanded of him by the Departmental\r\nauthorities; while lower down on the Paiute the lateral head gate in use\r\nby whites is without lock and is under an exceedingly high pressure,\r\ninsuring to the users thereof the full and unlimited control of their\r\nown water supply. Can any fair minded citizen blame an Indian for\r\nputting up \"the same old howl that he has howled for the last ten\r\nyears?\" Apropos to the foregoing facts are the following communications\r\nwhich are self-explanatory. The =Neekass Canal= is the Paiute Ditch. The\r\nname used is that pertaining to the surrounding country: \"where horses\r\nwere left.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=INDIAN WATER USERS OF THE PIUTE DITCH IN COUNCIL=\r\n\r\n                                WHITE SWAN, WASH., May 28, 1920.\r\n\r\n    Mr. DON M. CARR:\r\n\r\n    At this meeting today, We Protest and Oppose to Reclamation\r\n    Service to enter their water into Our Neekass Ditch. Let\r\n    Reclamation keep out from our Neekass Canal. Our Flood Water We\r\n    have been using this water from the Simcoe Creek for 41 years,\r\n    And our Prior Riparian Rights was there Before Reclamation\r\n    Service Came. Indians used this Simcoe Creek Water for 41 years\r\n    now, We want you to Protect our Rights. We are shamed to see\r\n    this Reclamation Let our crops go to hell, what kind of people\r\n    are these Reclamation Service where do they come from, they are\r\n    all to crush us down and what can we do to save our crops, we\r\n    are trying our best to do what is right, Our Great Father of\r\n    Washington D. C. want to see us be a farmers that is us Injuns\r\n    but not to take away our water with which we been Irrigating our\r\n    lands for 41 years, and where ever the Reclamation Service\r\n    constructed the Ditches at their own funds, and we do not kick\r\n    about it we are willing to pay the assessments to the water\r\n    charges but here we hate to bring an Injunction Suit to the\r\n    Reclamation Service. I want you to see and to protect our\r\n    rights, You do not want to see me and my neighbors be loosing\r\n    our crops, Because the Reclamation Service are the only persons\r\n    to live on this Earth they are hungry after the Dollars and\r\n    their hunger is not filled. We do bitterly here Protest and\r\n    Oppose to see our ditch be Grabbed away, and let us go to hell\r\n    and of course where the reclamation service build their own\r\n    ditches, and it is their own sole rights to collect the\r\n    assessment from the Lands watered, but not on this Ditch which\r\n    we have been using for 41 years can you do any Assistance? I am\r\n    feeling very bad I hate to loose my hard labor and seed, I want\r\n    you to stop Interfering Our rights let the Reclamation Service\r\n    leave us all alone.\r\n\r\n        Sincerely your friend\r\n\r\n                                                      LOUIS MANN,\r\n\r\n    =Simon Goudy, George Simon, Shepherd Peter, and Guy Howard= took\r\n    this letter to Mr. Carr.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    L. M. Holt,                         Yakima, Wash., July 16, 1920.\r\n\r\n      Reclamation Service, Yakima, Wash.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    I have received a notice (bill for money due) No. 1762 W1/2\r\n    SW1/4 and SE1/4 SW1/4 and SW1/4 SE1/4 35-11-17 and I was\r\n    investigating the number of my allotments and I have found. Well\r\n    my friend now my mistake (understanding) is this way. I am water\r\n    user on this Piute Ditch for 41 solid years before you enter\r\n    your water into this ditch without my consent and your ditch\r\n    tenders bother me from my own water, and I am wondering who must\r\n    be too damn white on your office, and he do not understand what\r\n    is on this earth Prior Riparian Rights to water. I am a man want\r\n    to do what is right, I am not waiting to beat some one in my\r\n    ranching business. That Mr. Holt you consider my talking to you\r\n    in this writing I am not crazy when I am writing this to you\r\n    today. I want to know who did put this assessment to me and\r\n    charging me $80.00. That ditch was constructed before the first\r\n    allotment was made to the Indians, and am I mistaken in my mind\r\n    to be a man holder of that water as a man to have a Prior\r\n    Riparian Rights to my water on these two allotments, which your\r\n    employees has a charge to me. Do you think you will make me to\r\n    pay you for my own water? Do you think you have a right to\r\n    grabble my Prior Riparian Rights? Now here is the question, is\r\n    your power right to crush me down as you see fit? I do not want\r\n    to be too damn smart, I know where you build or constructed\r\n    ditches with government funds, you have sole rights to put the\r\n    assessment charges to lands and I am willing to pay, but where I\r\n    am using this water for 41 years do not think you have founded\r\n    the Indian ditch that is owned by the dead Indians. Look out\r\n    man! The earth and water are all time here but me I am not all\r\n    time here. Like my little son which you have seen time you was\r\n    to my house. The little boy was buried yesterday at 1 o'clock P.\r\n    M. and every one of us to die, and we of course every one of us\r\n    want is money. But let us see where we are at, some times yet I\r\n    will call to your office when I am in town. Well the earth and\r\n    water before I was born, and next is me before your Reclamation\r\n    Service came. Do not be too white and too Damn Smart. Recognize\r\n    my being first water user along this Piute Ditch. When James H.\r\n    Wilbur being Agent and when he left he was shaking my hands and\r\n    he was talking to me good bye and he told me at that time \"take\r\n    care the Ditch it is yours my boy, he said to me this that Ditch\r\n    was built for the Piutes, but the Piutes ran away, and now is\r\n    yours, that water will give you money and support for your\r\n    living,\" and so from that time we use that Ditch and water, and\r\n    do you rather let us have the litigation of the Injunction Suit?\r\n    I am no Renter of them two Allotments, I am the owner of the\r\n    land and the water for 41 years. I am not writing a foolish\r\n    talk. I mean business, I am of course a Red man and by being is\r\n    Same and the Rest have and I will die same. No difference I am\r\n    talking about my Rights.\r\n\r\n                                Very truly your friend,\r\n\r\n                                           LOUIS MANN, R. 4, Box 233.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        Yakima, Wash., July 22, 1920.\r\n\r\n    Dear McWhorter My white Brother: I am not feeling good yet. I\r\n    cannot forget my Dearest Child in my poor Family, one that was\r\n    loved by all in my family, and it will take some time to get\r\n    over this Lamentations over the loss of the beloved Dearest Son.\r\n    I know that I am to Die yet myself but I cannot help this my\r\n    dearest white brother. We all of course have to Die on this\r\n    Earth, and if honest on this earth we may meet our loved one\r\n    gone before us. well brother I was over to see F. J. MAPES to my\r\n    old ranch yesterday, and I have seen my Irrigation water none on\r\n    my head gate, and I am wondering could any man on this face of\r\n    the Earth Irrigate 80 acres with one inch by 18 inches of water,\r\n    now they have Done me Dirtiest Trick them Reclamation Service\r\n    outfit. I Don't give A Damn who ever is in this Service all of\r\n    course they come from the old world where white people are\r\n    Starving, this is my understanding from the papers I read. Now\r\n    If I was Sleeping Indian I would Loose all my crops over there\r\n    all of it, but as my Neighbors carry water through my Premises\r\n    and if my hired man maybe to steal water this our own water, and\r\n    this awful shame way of using Reclamation Service Tricks, To\r\n    CIVILIZE me. Oh What A white mans Rulings. Very soon he will run\r\n    me Down, and what is the Right way to bringing me to\r\n    Citizenship? learn me First To steal? which I never like it in\r\n    my life, well brother No man can Civilize me this way, bad\r\n    whites are combined to run Down Indians like a Wolf Runs Down\r\n    deer when wolf is awful hungry, I have been Studying these\r\n    things, and one of my Neighbor crops went to hell there\r\n    adjoining my place, that is Mr GUY HOWARD he is an Injun man. I\r\n    wish you would make a trip with me there and see that GUY\r\n    HOWARDS Crops, and have it taken a Picture, what a Damn Nice\r\n    piece of the work the Reclamation Service done with this Injun,\r\n    Starve the mans crops because no money in advance, while the\r\n    Reclamation Service Committed a crime enter their water into our\r\n    Ditch without our Consent. Piute Ditch was build with Indian\r\n    money for the Piute Indians who were brought here from Malhiuer\r\n    from Oregon by the Agent JAMES H. WILBUR, and with help by some\r\n    of our Yakima Indians with Teams and wagons. I have forgotten\r\n    now, may be old man Peter Klickitat was in that trip, well\r\n    brother may be to Damn white Rullers in this Reclamation\r\n    Service, and to Dirty heart Tricks with this Service, this\r\n    Government is Polished with Black when Such Water Lords are in\r\n    this Service, now brother If you had time to go with me over\r\n    this coming Sunday, you would come to my place in the first car\r\n    that comes out in the morning, and we would start out from my\r\n    place with a hack drive over there and back in the evening.\r\n\r\n      I am yours very Truly Brother\r\n\r\n                                                      LOUIS MANN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: =HUM ISHUMA--\"Morning Dove\" of the Okanogans=\r\n\r\n  Author of COGEWEA, an Unpublished Manuscript Romance of the Great\r\n  Montana Cattle Range\r\n\r\n  Photo and Copyright by J.

Two weeks later her body was found with eyes picked\r\nout by the magpies. Was there an investigation?--an inquest? If so who\r\never heard of it?

Sahpamequick Twatentush, a young Indian was on trial\r\nfor his life for killing Sheowit a \"bad\" medicine man who had cast a\r\ndeath spell over his infant boy. Advised by two medicine women, who had\r\nbeen summoned to treat the child, that they could render no aid unless\r\nthe man remove his evil spell, the distressed father rode twenty miles\r\nhorseback to entreat Sheowit to come to the rescue. The medicine man\r\nrefused, and according to the testimony of an eye witness, and that of\r\nthe accused himself, he mocked at the sorrow of the father, stating that\r\nhe had sent an evil spirit into his child's body and that it would die.\r\nHe angrily exclaimed: \"I am a strong man! I want to kill somebody all\r\nthe time! I have killed your child and I will kill you!\" With this he\r\ndrew a hatchet from beneath his blanket and made an attempt to strike\r\nthe young man; who dodged and backed away. The enraged medicine man\r\nfollowed him, striking once or twice with the hatchet. It was then that\r\nthe Indian drew his pistol and killed his assailant. The medicine man\r\nwas of bad repute, having killed two or more men. For one of the crimes\r\nhe had served a term in the penitentiary. During the trial, many\r\ninteresting points concerning the philosophy of the Yakimas were brought\r\nto light. It is needless to say that the sympathy of the public was with\r\nthe defendant, who sat stoical during the trial in full tribal costume.\r\nIt took the jury but ten minutes to bring in a verdict of not guilty.\r\nBarring self defense, the young man in taking the life of Sheowit, had\r\nbut followed an ancient law of his tribe. It was suggested, by one who\r\nattended the trial, that it might serve a good purpose could this\r\nunwritten Yakima tamanwit be enforced against some of the quack M.

He is having\r\n    awful time talking, repeating the words of the Indian Doctors\r\n    and this matter nearly set me crazy, and if it was not for my\r\n    religion I would take my gun and kill the bad Indian Doctors,\r\n    but my Great God is on my side and he shall save my little boy's\r\n    soul, but of course, the body will be buried to rot and decay\r\n    and that my religion tell me this: Thou shall not kill, and I\r\n    tried my best to save him, but white man doctor can not cure the\r\n    boy because the boy had Indian doctor sick to which white man\r\n    has no belief, but this is true as you understand Indian ways.\r\n    Old Man Tom is a bad one. He killed my mother-in-law and one\r\n    little child for me. I can not do no further to reach a cure for\r\n    my little dear son. I had Priest there yesterday giving the\r\n    little boy blessing and extreme unctions so the boy will die\r\n    holy. The Indian doctors are killing us right and left this day.\r\n    This is no lie and I do not know how long the little son live\r\n    and he will go. He get some times unconscious and this is all my\r\n    brother.\r\n\r\nThe sick child died four days later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe curse of =Shakerism= on the Yakima Reservation is well illustrated in\r\nthe following. A young married woman stricken in confinement, was, for\r\nthree days and nights \"doctored\" by one of the \"priests\", or \"preachers\"\r\nby noisy incantations and ringing of bells, assisted by many \"helpers\".\r\nAt the end of that period the poor sufferer was released by death. Think\r\nof this and lend your moral and financial aid to the Mission now being\r\nestablished at White Swan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Tepee Association is a body of its own, entirely distinct and\r\nseparate from the =Mission= being established on the Yakima Reservation.\r\nThe =Tepee= will work in unison with the Mission and kindred organizations\r\nfor the uplift of the Indian and for a more liberal recognition of his\r\nrights. Not only must the coming Indian be prepared by education for a\r\nhigher plane in life, but the public must also be enlightened to his\r\nneeds and to the fact that the Indian can =never be= a man until delivered\r\nfrom the unreasonable trammelings of the Indian Bureau. That body must\r\nbe reformed or dethroned.\r\n\r\nNOTE--Will the =Tepee= return to its original declared principal of\r\nbattling for a better recognition of the rights of its people?; or is it\r\nto follow the less rugged trail of mediocre so recently determined on?\r\nThe true warrior never shows his heels at the first sound of the enemy\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Tipi Order of America opened a new Council in Tacoma (Tahoma) during\r\nthe Planting Moon.

Recently two of\r\nits officers attended a round-up of wild range horses at the \"Ten Cent\r\nCorral\" near the Agency where they found some of the animals being\r\n\"broke\" by the usual method of keeping them tethered for three or four\r\ndays without food or water. It was explained to the Indians that this\r\ncould not be allowed, that under no circumstances must an animal be so\r\nconfined for more than 24 hours. With but one or two exceptions the\r\nwarning was received kindly, many of the Indians expressing their\r\napprobation. The brutality of the branding corral, where the young colts\r\nare trampled and maimed, ofttimes killed outright, was also supervised.\r\nThis part of the work fell to Mr. Simon Goudy, a half-blood Volunteer\r\nOfficer. Here there was some friction, and it is said, a delegation of\r\nIndians laid complaint before their Superintendent, with what result is\r\nnot known further than that the Humane Society received no official\r\nnotice of action by the Agency. Later, in reply to a communication from\r\nthe society setting forth its desire to promote humane education among\r\nthe Yakimas, Supt. Carr expressed his unqualified approval and pledged\r\nto lend his support to the movement within the resources at his command.\r\nThus the way is paved and if properly handled, many of the ghastly\r\nfeatures of the Yakima roundup will be eliminated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Yakima Humane Society has in its ranks two Indian Volunteer Officers\r\nhelping to enforce humane laws on the Yakima Reservation, and\r\ninstructing their people in the ways of kindness to animals.

The newly elected President of the Association\r\npledged her support of this new Departure, realizing that such education\r\nmeans the elimination of much crime and all around better citizenship.\r\nMrs. Nichols' accreditation as the most active field humane worker in\r\nthe United States is borne out by the success of her indefatigable\r\nefforts at the great Madison Convention, was loyally supported by Mrs.\r\nC. A. Varney, President of the Washington State Parent-Teachers'\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nSince Indian children are more in attendance at our public schools each\r\nsucceeding year, this new feature of humane education is bound to have\r\ntelling effect on the minds of the youth of the First Americans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut on a rock crowned desert mountain in the Okanogan country, far from\r\nwater lies the shriveled form of a coyote with one foot clamped in the\r\nrusted jaws of a Government trap. The chain, with its triple flukes\r\nanchored to a sage brush, is taut and twisted, attesting the awful\r\nstrugglings of the animal before death came to its release. Trapped in\r\nmid-summer, the agony of that coyote can not be imagined, as day after\r\nday passed with the scorching rays of a hell-sizzling sun beating down\r\nupon it. Obviously a war of extermination against certain predatory\r\nanimals is justifiable, but there is nothing more brutal than the modern\r\nmethods of trapping. Notwithstanding, we have the amazing spectacle of\r\nDr. William T. Hornaday, naturalist, advocating that this brutalizing\r\npursuit be taken up by the Boy Scouts; and the suggestion is sanctioned\r\nby the executive board of that fine organization. God created man and\r\nall kinds of animal life, but he did not create the steel trap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe catch of salmon at Top-tut, now known as Prosser, on the Yakima\r\nriver this year was unusually heavy. Under the Treaty of 1855, it would\r\nappear that the right to take fish at this, their ancient fishing\r\ngrounds, is assured the Indians, but a State law interferes and the\r\nauthorities tacitly permitted the Yakimas a certain number of days in\r\nwhich to catch and cure a winter's supply of this, their favorite food.\r\nThe fish is both dried and salted. It is hoped that the next legislature\r\nwill restore to the Yakimas their right to fish at Top-tut, built\r\nespecially for them in the beginning by Speelyi.\r\n\r\nThe State Federation of Women's Clubs, meeting in convention at\r\nWenatchee, Wash., June 1920, unanimously passed resolutions requesting\r\nthe coming legislature to enact some measure which will permit the\r\nYakimas to take fish hereafter unmolested at Top-tut during the salmon\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPursuant to a recent ordinance passed by the City Commission of Yakima,\r\nno dog is to bark, no cow to moo nor rooster to crow within the\r\ncorporate limits after night fall, under penalty of a fine not to exceed\r\n$100 with possible imprisonment. The next sane move is to enact a\r\ntamanawit against the cooing of babies and the early carol of robin red\r\nbreast. The dulcet yodel of the tom cat, the musical purr of the open\r\nmuffler and the rhythmical chime of the flat car wheel is symphony\r\nplenty a-nuff for the city denizens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT\r\n\r\nHelp on the Yakima Reservation has been extremely scarce during the\r\nharvest season this year. A rancher came to Wapato and entering a pool\r\nroom saw two young Indians taking life easy. He accosted them, enquiring\r\nif they wanted work, offering them substantial wages if they would help\r\nhim a few days. The Indians exchanged glances and one of them spoke:\r\n\"No! you white people came here, we did not want you. You made all this\r\nwork, all this trouble. You can do the work yourselves; it is your\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"=Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,\r\nye have done it unto me.=\" (Matthew 25-40.)\r\n\r\nBut Matthew, like James was only writing the words of the Master long\r\nbefore Columbus discovered America, before the Injun was even thought\r\nof, maybe invented.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SERPENT'S SLIMY TRAIL\r\n\r\nA favorite method of swindling is to inveigle the Indian into\r\nencumbering an allotment with a mortgage which will seldom if ever be\r\nredeemed, thus obtaining the land by foreclosure. The following gives an\r\ninkling to this mode of \"stalking\" by the financial gun-man.\r\n\r\n    CENTRAL BANK OF TOPPENISH\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Lucy James                     Toppenish, Wash., July 2, 1920.\r\n\r\n      Harrah, Wash.\r\n\r\n    Dear Madam:\r\n\r\n    I note that you have received and recorded Patent in Fee to your\r\n    allotment in section 27-11-18 near Harrah, and in this\r\n    connection, wish to advise that if you desire to either borrow\r\n    money on the property or sell the same, we would be pleased to\r\n    talk with you at any time it is convenient.\r\n\r\n    We are in a position to place suitable farm loans for three or\r\n    five years at favorable rates of interest with prompt service.\r\n\r\n    Awaiting the opportunity of serving you, I am\r\n\r\n                                        Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                 H. B. MILLER, Cashier.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. James' deed was filed for record June 29, 1920. Her \"friend\" lost\r\nno time in his offer of financial assistance (?). Nasty intrigue. Mr. H.\r\nM. Gilbert is President of the Central Bank of Toppenish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Let the white man get all the water he can in this life, for he is\r\ngoing where it is awfully hot and dry.\"--=Louis Mann= in =The Continued\r\nCrime Against The Yakimas=.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Water is Life. =Tahoma=, the =Big White Mountain! the= source of water.\r\nWhen I die, the Earth will take care of my body.\"\r\n\r\n                                           =Chief Sluskin=, the Yakima.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?\r\n\r\nHon. Cato Sells recently visited the Yakima Indian Reservation\r\nostensibly in the interest of the Indian, but so far as can be learned\r\nno Indian was consulted, no tribesman invited to council, none permitted\r\nto air their many just grievances. None knew of his coming and but few\r\nlearned of his going, and this, through a few friendly whites. Perhaps\r\nthe Commissioner had not the time to devote to his Red Wards. Banquets\r\nwith officials and speculators in Indian lands could not be foregone. In\r\nToppenish a few of the Yakimas were informed of the stranger's personnel\r\nas he and his \"escorts,\" or \"body guard,\" as one observer commented,\r\nstepped into the Agency car and was whirled away. One of the tribesmen\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean? Why does our Commissioner do this thing? I\r\nthought he was =our= commissioner, to look after =us=. What is he\r\nhere for? What is he doing? I know some of those men with him. I\r\nknow who they are, what they are doing to the Injuns. We want to\r\ntell Mr. Sells something about how we are treated, how we are\r\nrobbed, but Mr. Carr keeps him from us. Why is this? What is\r\nwrong with Mr. Sells.\"\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Cato Sells explain his course to this untutored Yakima.\r\n\r\nThere is \"something rotten in Denmark\" when an Indian who has a thousand\r\ndollars due him at the Agency is compelled to borrow fifty dollars with\r\nwhich to purchase grain sacks before he can thrash his wheat crop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"=It is Hell to be an Injun!=\" was the rueful self diagnosis of a Yakima\r\nallottee as he dejectedly surveyed his torn hog fence and ruined garden,\r\nground and demolished by one of the Government dredges. The crew,\r\nfinding a bridge on the public road possibly unsafe, had, without\r\nconsulting the Indian or asking his permission, opened his fence,\r\nentered his premises with the many toned machine, passed over a part of\r\nhis garden, obliterating it, leaving the fence broken permitting his\r\nhogs to scatter at large. The Indian was not aware of this occurrence\r\nuntil hours afterwards when he found his hogs wandering on the highway.\r\nWhen the dredge-crew was spoken to he was referred to the Indian Farmer.\r\nWhen this official was approached, he was referred to the Agency\r\nSuperintendent. Appealing to this worthy, he was informed that he \"knew\r\nnothing about it.\" And yet it is expected of the Indian that he be law\r\nabiding, show love and reverence for the Flag and the Government--to\r\nlick the hand that vivisects him. Surely it is \"Hell to be an Injun.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHAT SAWMILL\r\n\r\nThe Yakima Indian Reservation has timber valued at more than three\r\nmillion dollars, and yet the Yakimas have no way of making domestic or\r\ncommercial use of this wealth. Building material must be obtained from\r\nlocal dealers at high cost. The saw mill built by the Government in\r\ncompliance with treaty stipulations, burned more than a quarter century\r\nago \"under very suspicious circumstances,\" so the Indians declare, and\r\nhas never been replaced. Under date of April 26, 1909, Mr. C. F. Hauke,\r\nChief Clerk of the Indian Office, in answer to an inquiry, wrote Louis\r\nMann: \"The sawmill is to be put into shape for operation at an early\r\ndate.\" No move has ever been made to redeem that \"black and white\"\r\npromise. It will be remembered that at that time the Department was over\r\nanxious to secure Yakima signatures which would permit the looting of\r\nthe tribesmen to the tune of undetermined millions. The signatures were\r\nnot forthcoming and the sawmill promise turned out to be another Indian\r\nBureau fabrication.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt should redound to the credit of the Yakima Indians who refused to\r\naccompany the Pack Train under the supervision of Head Packer Anderson,\r\nwho served the Mountaineer Club on its outing in the Olympic Mountains\r\nthis season. Anderson packed for the Club in its tour of Tahoma last\r\nyear, with three or four Yakimas and their horses. The Indians, usually\r\nconsidered hard horse masters, got their fill of Anderson's mode of\r\nover-loading and driving the long stretches of steep and rugged trail,\r\nofttimes occupying seventeen hours without food or rest. The horses,\r\nwith raw and sore backs, staggered under stacks of dunnage, leaving the\r\ntrail red with blood from their worn and unshod feet. The personal\r\neffects of preachers, professors and teachers were included in those\r\npacks. On a previous outing of the Club, Anderson's packers mutinied.\r\nThe Mountaineers are winning an unenviable reputation for this brutal\r\ntreatment of its yearly pack-train. What is the Washington State Humane\r\nBureau for that it does not interfere with this lawless disregard of the\r\nhumane laws?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Text in bold is enclosed with equals signs: =bold=.\r\n\r\n  Text in italics is enclosed with underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected as follows:\r\n\r\n    Page 3:  expalnation changed to explanation\r\n             malined changed to maligned\r\n             summarly changed to summarily\r\n             gally changed to galley\r\n             volumnous changed to voluminous\r\n             oftimes changed to ofttimes\r\n             potage changed to pottage\r\n    Page 4:  imbittered changed embittered\r\n    Page 5:  consumation changed to consummation\r\n             wonton changed to wanton\r\n             connivence changed to connivance\r\n             on changed to one\r\n             into changed to in two\r\n    Page 6:  leassors changed to lessors\r\n             Man changed to Mann\r\n             refered changed to referred\r\n             redown changed to redound\r\n    Page 7:  Appropose changed to Apropos\r\n             refered changed to referred\r\n             grabbe changed to grab\r\n             couds changed to clouds\r\n             tao changed to to\r\n             dont changed to don't\r\n    Page 9:  journalo f changed to journal of\r\n             siezure changed to seizure\r\n    Page 10: compeled changed to compelled\r\n    Page 11: alhtough changed to although\r\n    Page 12: incured changed to incurred\r\n             compeling changed to compelling\r\n             Appropose changed to Apropos\r\n    Page 13: useing changed to using\r\n             Ripirian changed to Riparian\r\n             Irregating changed to Irrigating\r\n             assesment changed to assessment\r\n             useing changed to using\r\n             Interferreing changed to Interfering\r\n             Sincerey changed to Sincerely\r\n             ennter changed to enter\r\n             Ripirian changed to Riparian\r\n    Page 14: Irregation changed to Irrigation\r\n             Irregate changed to Irrigate\r\n             Dont changed to Don't\r\n             useing changed to using\r\n             ue changed to me\r\n             seal changed to steal\r\n             con changed to can\r\n    Page 16: hinderance changed to hindrance\r\n             pappoose changed to papoose\r\n    Page 17: effiency changed to efficiency\r\n             beief changed to belief\r\n    Page 18: bessing changed to blessing\r\n             regretable changed to regrettable\r\n             liviing changed to living\r\n    Page 19: oftimes changesd to ofttimes\r\n             outroight changed to outright\r\n             deelgation changed to delegation\r\n             resutl changed to result\r\n             summerized changed to summarize\r\n    Page 20: reelase changed to release\r\n             rythmical changed to rhythmical\r\n    Page 21: rceorded changed to recorded\r\n             tribesfan changed to tribesman\r\n             timet o changed to time to\r\n    Page 22: oftimes changed to ofttimes\r\n             sevetneen chenged to seventeen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Discards, by Lucullus Virgil McWhorter",
