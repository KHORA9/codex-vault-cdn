John C. Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1851,\r\n\r\nBY A.S. BARNES & CO.,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the\r\n\r\nSouthern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe American publishers of M. De Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America,\"\r\nhave been frequently solicited to furnish the work in a form adapted\r\nto seminaries of learning, and at a price which would secure its more\r\ngeneral circulation, and enable trustees of School District Libraries,\r\nand other libraries, to place it among their collections. Desirous to\r\nattain these objects, they have consulted several gentlemen, in whose\r\njudgment they confided, and particularly the editor of the American\r\neditions, to ascertain whether the work was capable of abridgment or\r\ncondensation, so as to bring the expense of its publication within the\r\nnecessary limits. They are advised that the nature of the work renders\r\nit impossible to condense it by omitting any remarks or illustrations of\r\nthe author upon any subject discussed by him, even if common justice to\r\nhim did not forbid any such attempt; and that the only mode of reducing\r\nits bulk, is to exclude wholly such subjects as are deemed not to be\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the first volume was originally published\r\nseparately, and was complete in itself. It treated of the influence\r\nof democracy upon the political institutions of the United States,\r\nand exhibited views of the nature of our government, and of their\r\ncomplicated machinery, so new, so striking, and so just, as to excite\r\nthe admiration and even the wonder of our countrymen. It was universally\r\nadmitted to be the best, if not the first systematic and philosophic\r\nview of the great principles of our constitutions which has been\r\npresented to the world. As a treatise upon the spirit of our\r\ngovernments, it was full and finished, and was deemed worthy of being\r\nintroduced as a text-book in some of our Seminaries of Learning.\r\nThe publication of the first volume alone would therefore seem to be\r\nsufficient to accomplish in the main the objects of the publishers above\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nAnd upon a careful re-examination of the second volume, this impression\r\nis confirmed. It is entirely independent of the first volume, and is\r\nin no way essential to a full understanding of the principles and views\r\ncontained in that volume. It discusses the effects of the democratic\r\nprinciple upon the tastes, feelings, habits, and manners of the\r\nAmericans; and although deeply interesting and valuable, yet the\r\nobservations of the author on these subjects are better calculated for\r\nforeign countries than for our own citizens. As he wrote for Europe\r\nthey were necessary to his plan. They follow naturally and properly the\r\nprofound views which had already been presented, and which they carry\r\nout and illustrate. But they furnish no new developments of those views,\r\nnor any facts that would be new to us.\r\n\r\nThe publishers were therefore advised that the printing of the first\r\nvolume complete and entire, was the only mode of attaining the object\r\nthey had in view. They have accordingly determined to adopt that course,\r\nintending, if the public sentiment should require it, hereafter to print\r\nthe second volume in the same style, so that both may be had at the same\r\nmoderate price.\r\n\r\nA few notes, in addition to those contained in the former editions, have\r\nbeen made by the American editor, which upon a reperusal of the volume\r\nseemed useful if not necessary: and some statistical results of the\r\ncensus of 1840 have been added, in connection with similar results given\r\nby the author from returns previous to that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.\r\n\r\nThe following work of M. DE TOCQUEVILLE has attracted great attention\r\nthroughout Europe, where it is universally regarded as a sound,\r\nphilosophical, impartial, and remarkably clear and distinct view of our\r\npolitical institutions, and of our manners, opinions, and habits, as\r\ninfluencing or influenced by those institutions. Writers, reviewers, and\r\nstatesmen of all parties, have united in the highest commendations of\r\nits ability and integrity. The people, described by a work of such a\r\ncharacter, should not be the only one in Christendom unacquainted with\r\nits contents. At least, so thought many of our most distinguished men,\r\nwho have urged the publishers of this edition to reprint the work, and\r\npresent it to the American public. They have done so in the hope of\r\npromoting among their countrymen a more thorough knowledge of their\r\nframes of government, and a more just appreciation of the great\r\nprinciples on which they are founded.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed to them that a reprint in America of the views of an\r\nauthor so well entitled to regard and confidence, without any correction\r\nof the few errors or mistakes that might be found, would be in effect\r\nto give authenticity to the whole work, and that foreign readers,\r\nespecially, would consider silence, under such circumstances, as strong\r\nevidence of the accuracy of its statements. The preface to the English\r\nedition, too, was not adapted to this country, having been written, as\r\nit would seem, in reference to the political questions which agitate\r\nGreat Britain. The publishers, therefore, applied to the writer of this,\r\nto furnish them with a short preface, and such notes upon the text as\r\nmight appear necessary to correct any erroneous impressions. Having had\r\nthe honor of a personal acquaintance with M. DE TOCQUEVILLE while he was\r\nin this country; having discussed with him many of the topics treated\r\nof in this book; having entered deeply into the feelings and sentiments\r\nwhich guided and impelled him in his task, and having formed a high\r\nadmiration of his character and of this production, the writer felt\r\nunder some obligation to aid in procuring for one whom he ventures\r\nto call his friend, a hearing from those who were the subjects of his\r\nobservations. These circumstances furnish to his own mind an apology for\r\nundertaking what no one seemed willing to attempt, notwithstanding\r\nhis want of practice in literary composition, and notwithstanding\r\nthe impediments of professional avocations, constantly recurring, and\r\ninterrupting that strict and continued examination of the work, which\r\nbecame necessary, as well to detect any errors of the author, as any\r\nmisunderstanding or misrepresentation of his meaning by his translator.\r\nIf the same circumstances will atone in the least for the imperfections\r\nof what the editor has contributed to this edition, and will serve to\r\nmitigate the severity of judgment upon those contributions, it is all he\r\ncan hope or ask.\r\n\r\nThe NOTES are confined, with very few exceptions, to the correction of\r\nwhat appeared to be misapprehensions of the author in regard to some\r\nmatters of fact, or some principles of law, and to explaining his\r\nmeaning where the translator had misconceived it. For the latter purpose\r\nthe original was consulted; and it affords great pleasure to bear\r\nwitness to the general fidelity with which Mr. REEVE has transferred\r\nthe author's ideas from French into English. He has not been a literal\r\ntranslator, and this has been the cause of the very few errors which\r\nhave been discovered: but he has been more and better: he has caught the\r\nspirit of M. DE TOCQUEVILLE, has understood the sentiment he meant to\r\nexpress, and has clothed it in the language which M. DE TOCQUEVILLE\r\nwould have himself used, had he possessed equal facility in writing the\r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\nBeing confined to the objects before mentioned, the reader will not find\r\nany comments on the theoretical views of our author. He has discussed\r\nmany subjects on which very different opinions are entertained in the\r\nUnited States; but with an ability, a candor, and an evident devotion\r\nto the cause of truth, which will commend his views to those who most\r\nradically dissent from them. Indeed, readers of the most discordant\r\nopinions will find that he frequently agrees with both sides, and as\r\nfrequently differs from them. As an instance, his remarks on slavery\r\nwill not be found to coincide throughout with the opinions either of\r\nabolitionists or of slaveholders: but they will be found to present a\r\nmasterly view of a most perplexing and interesting subject, which seems\r\nto cover the whole ground, and to lead to the melancholy conclusion of\r\nthe utter impotency of human effort to eradicate this acknowledged evil.\r\nBut on this, and on the various topics of the deepest interest which are\r\ndiscussed in this work, it was thought that the American readers would\r\nbe fully competent to form their own opinions, and to detect any errors\r\nof the author, if such there are, without any attempt of the present\r\neditor to enlighten them. At all events, it is to be hoped that\r\nthe citizens of the United States will patiently read, and candidly\r\nconsider, the views of this accomplished foreigner, however hostile they\r\nmay be to their own preconceived opinions or prejudices. He says: \"There\r\nare certain truths which Americans can only learn from strangers, or\r\nfrom experience.\" Let us, then, at least listen to one who admires us\r\nand our institutions, and whose complaints, when he makes any, are, that\r\nwe have not perfected our own glorious plans, and that there are some\r\nthings yet to be amended. We shall thus furnish a practical proof, that\r\npublic opinion in this country is not so intolerant as the author may be\r\nunderstood to represent it. However mistaken he may be, his manly appeal\r\nto our understandings and to our consciences, should at least be heard.\r\n\"If ever,\" he says, \"these lines are read in America, I am well assured\r\nof two things: in the first place, that all who peruse them will raise\r\ntheir voice to condemn me; and, in the second place, that very many of\r\nthem will acquit me at the bottom of their consciences.\" He is writing\r\non that very sore subject, the tyranny of public opinion in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFully to comprehend the scope of the present work, the author's motive\r\nand object in preparing it should be distinctly kept in view. He has\r\nwritten, not for America, but for France. \"It was not, then, merely to\r\nsatisfy a legitimate curiosity,\" he says, \"that I have examined America:\r\nmy wish has been to find instruction, by which we might ourselves\r\nprofit.\"--\"I sought the image of democracy itself, with its\r\ninclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order\r\nto learn what we have to hope or fear from its progress.\" He thinks that\r\nthe principle of democracy has sprung into new life throughout Europe,\r\nand particularly in France, and that it is advancing: with a firm and\r\nsteady march to the control of all civilized governments. In his own\r\ncountry, he had seen a recent attempt to repress its energies within due\r\nbounds, and to prevent the consequences of its excesses. And it seems\r\nto be a main object with him, to ascertain whether these bounds can be\r\nrelied upon; whether the dikes and embankments of human contrivance\r\ncan keep within any appointed channel this mighty and majestic stream.\r\nGiving the fullest confidence to his declaration, that his book \"is\r\nwritten to favor no particular views and with no design of serving or\r\nattacking any party,\" it is yet evident that his mind has been very open\r\nto receive impressions unfavorable to the admission into France of the\r\nunbounded and unlimited democracy which reigns in these United States.\r\nA knowledge of this inclination of his mind will necessarily induce some\r\ncaution in his readers, while perusing those parts of the work which\r\ntreat of the effects of our democracy upon the stability of our\r\ngovernment and its administration. While the views of the author,\r\nrespecting the application of the democratic principle, in the extent\r\nthat it exists with us, to the institutions of France, or to any of\r\nthe European nations, are of the utmost importance to the people and\r\nstatesmen of those countries, they are scarcely less entitled to the\r\nattention of Americans. He has exhibited, with admirable skill, the\r\ncauses and circumstances which prepared our forefathers, gradually, for\r\nthe enjoyment of free institutions, and which enable them to sustain,\r\nwithout abusing, the utmost liberty that was ever enjoyed by any people.\r\nIn tracing these causes, in examining how far they continue to influence\r\nour conduct, manners, and opinions, and in searching for the means of\r\npreventing their decay or destruction, the intelligent American reader\r\nwill find no better guide than M. DE TOCQUEVILLE.\r\n\r\nFresh from the scenes of the \"three days\" revolution in France, the\r\nauthor came among us to observe, carefully and critically, the operation\r\nof the new principle on which the happiness of his country, and, as he\r\nseems to believe, the destinies of the civilized world, depend. Filled\r\nwith the love of liberty, but remembering the atrocities which, in its\r\nname, had been committed under former dynasties at home, he sought to\r\ndiscover the means by which it was regulated in America, and reconciled\r\nwith social order. By his laborious investigations, and minute\r\nobservations of the history of the settlement of the country, and of its\r\nprogress through the colonial state to independence, he found the object\r\nof his inquiry in the manners, habits, and opinions, of a people who had\r\nbeen gradually prepared, by a long course of peculiar circumstances, and\r\nby their local position, for self-government; and he has explained, with\r\na pencil of light, the mystery that has baffled Europeans and perplexed\r\nAmericans. He exhibits us, in our present condition, a new, and to\r\nEuropeans, a strange people. His views of our political institutions are\r\nmore general, comprehensive, and philosophic than have been presented by\r\nany writer, domestic or foreign. He has traced them from their source,\r\ndemocracy--the power of the people--and has steadily pursued this\r\nfoundation-principle in all its forms and modifications: in the frame of\r\nour governments, in their administration by the different executives, in\r\nour legislation, in the arrangement of our judiciary, in our manners,\r\nin religion, in the freedom and licentiousness of the press, in the\r\ninfluence of public opinion, and in various subtle recesses, where its\r\nexistence was scarcely suspected. In all these, he analyzes and dissects\r\nthe tendencies of democracy; heartily applauds where he can, and\r\nfaithfully and independently gives warning of dangers that he foresees.\r\nNo one can read the result of his observations without better and\r\nclearer perceptions of the structure of out governments, of the great\r\npillars on which they rest, and of the dangers to which they are\r\nexposed: nor without a more profound and more intelligent admiration\r\nof the harmony and beauty of their formation, and of the safeguards\r\nprovided for preserving and transmitting them to a distant posterity.\r\nThe more that general and indefinite notions of our own liberty,\r\ngreatness, happiness, &c., are made to give place to precise and\r\naccurate knowledge of the true merits of our institutions, the peculiar\r\nobjects they are calculated to attain or promote, and the means provided\r\nfor that purpose, the better will every citizen be enabled to discharge\r\nhis great political duty of guarding those means against the approach\r\nof corruption, and of sustaining them against the violence of party\r\ncommotions. No foreigner has ever exhibited such a deep, clear, and\r\ncorrect insight of the machinery of our complicated systems of federal\r\nand state governments. The most intelligent Europeans are confounded\r\nwith our _imperium in imperio_; and their constant wonder is, that these\r\nsystems are not continually jostling each other. M. DE TOCQUEVILLE has\r\nclearly perceived, and traced correctly and distinctly, the orbits\r\nin which they move, and has described, or rather defined, our federal\r\ngovernment, with an accurate precision, unsurpassed even by an American\r\npen. There is no citizen of this country who will not derive instruction\r\nfrom our author's account of our national government, or, at least, who\r\nwill not find his own ideas systematised, and rendered more fixed and\r\nprecise, by the perusal of that account.\r\n\r\nAmong other subjects discussed by the author, that of the _political\r\ninfluence_ of the institution of trial by jury, is one of the most\r\ncurious and interesting. He has certainly presented it in a light\r\nentirely new, and as important as it is new. It may be that he has\r\nexaggerated its influence as \"a gratuitous public school;\" but if he\r\nhas, the error will be readily forgiven.\r\n\r\nHis views of religion, as connected with patriotism, in other words,\r\nwith the democratic principle, which he steadily keeps in view, are\r\nconceived in the noblest spirit of philanthropy, and cannot fail to\r\nconfirm the principles already so thoroughly and universally entertained\r\nby the American people. And no one can read his observations on the\r\nunion of \"church and state,\" without a feeling of deep gratitude to the\r\nfounders of our government, for saving us from such a prolific source of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nThese allusions to topics that have interested the writer, are not\r\nintended as an enumeration of the various subjects which will arrest the\r\nattention of the American reader. They have been mentioned rather with a\r\nview of exciting an appetite for the whole feast, than as exhibiting the\r\nchoice dainties which cover the board.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to observe, that in this edition the constitutions of\r\nthe United States and of the state of New York, which had been published\r\nat large in the original and in the English edition, have been omitted,\r\nas they are documents to which every American reader has access. The\r\nmap which the author annexed to his work, and which has been hitherto\r\nomitted, is now for the first time inserted in the American edition, to\r\nwhich has been added the census of 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN EDITOR\r\n  Introduction\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n  Exterior form of North America\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n  Origin of

attention during my stay in\r\nthe United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general\r\nequality of conditions. I readily discovered the prodigious influence\r\nwhich this primary fact exercises on the whole course of society, by\r\ngiving a certain direction to public opinion, and a certain tenor to\r\nthe laws; by imparting new maxims to the governing powers, and peculiar\r\nhabits to the governed.\r\n\r\nI speedily perceived that the influence of this fact extends far beyond\r\nthe political character and the laws of the country, and that it has\r\nno less empire over civil society than over the government; it creates\r\nopinions, engenders sentiments, the ordinary practices of life, and\r\nmodifies whatever it does not produce.\r\n\r\nThe more I advanced in the study of American society, the more I\r\nperceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from\r\nwhich all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all\r\nmy observations constantly terminated.\r\n\r\nI then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where I imagined that\r\nI discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the New World\r\npresented to me. I observed that the equality of conditions is daily\r\nadvancing towards those extreme limits which it seems to have reached\r\nin the United States; and that the democracy which governs the American\r\ncommunities, appears to be rapidly rising into power in Europe.\r\n\r\nI hence conceived the idea of the book which is now before the reader.\r\n\r\nIt is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is\r\ngoing on among us; but there are two opinions as to its nature and\r\nconsequences. To some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such\r\nmay still be checked; to others it seems irresistible, because it is the\r\nmost uniform, the most ancient, and the most permanent tendency which is\r\nto be found in history.\r\n\r\nLet us recollect the situation of France seven hundred years ago, when\r\nthe territory was divided among a small number of families, who were\r\nthe owners of the soil and the rulers of the inhabitants; the right\r\nof governing descended with the family inheritance from generation to\r\ngeneration; force was the only means by which man could act on man; and\r\nlanded property was the sole source of power.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the political power of the clergy was founded, and began\r\nto exert itself; the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to the poor\r\nand the rich, the villain and the lord; equality penetrated into the\r\ngovernment through the church, and the being who, as a serf, must have\r\nvegetated in perpetual bondage, took his place as a priest in the midst\r\nof nobles, and not unfrequently above the heads of kings.\r\n\r\nThe different relations of men became more complicated and more\r\nnumerous, as society gradually became more stable and more civilized.\r\nThence the want of civil laws was felt; and the order of legal\r\nfunctionaries soon rose from the obscurity of the tribunals and their\r\ndusty chambers, to appear at the court of the monarch, by the side of\r\nthe feudal barons in their ermine and their mail.\r\n\r\nWhile the kings were ruining themselves by their great enterprises, and\r\nthe nobles exhausting their resources by private wars, the lower orders\r\nwere enriching themselves by commerce. The influence of money began to\r\nbe perceptible in state affairs. The transactions of business opened\r\na new road to power, and the financier rose to a station of political\r\ninfluence in which he was at once flattered and despised.\r\n\r\nGradually the spread of mental acquirements, and the increasing taste\r\nfor literature and art, opened chances of success to talent; science\r\nbecame the means of government, intelligence led to social power, and\r\nthe man of letters took a part in the affairs of the state.\r\n\r\nThe value attached to the privileges of birth, decreased in the exact\r\nproportion in which new paths were struck out to advancement. In the\r\neleventh century nobility was beyond all price; in the thirteenth it\r\nmight be purchased; it was conferred for the first time in 1270; and\r\nequality was thus introduced into the government by the aristocracy\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these seven hundred years, it sometimes happened that,\r\nin order to resist the authority of the crown, or to diminish the power\r\nof their rivals, the nobles granted a certain share of political rights\r\nto the people. Or, more frequently the king permitted the lower orders\r\nto enjoy a degree of power, with the intention of repressing the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nIn France the kings have always been the most active and the most\r\nconstant of levellers. When they were strong and ambitious, they spared\r\nno pains to raise the people to the level of the nobles; when they were\r\ntemperate or weak, they allowed the people to rise above themselves.\r\nSome assisted the democracy by their talents, others by their vices.\r\nLouis XI. and Louis XIV. reduced every rank beneath the throne to the\r\nsame subjection; Louis XV. descended, himself and all his court, into\r\nthe dust.\r\n\r\nAs soon as land was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and\r\npersonal property began in its turn to confer influence and power, every\r\nimprovement which was introduced in commerce or manufacture, was a fresh\r\nelement of the equality of conditions. Henceforward every new discovery,\r\nevery new want which it engendered, and every new desire which craved\r\nsatisfaction, was a step toward the universal level. The taste for\r\nluxury, the love of war, the sway of fashion, the most superficial, as\r\nwell as the deepest passions of the human heart, co-operated to enrich\r\nthe poor and to impoverish the rich.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the exercise of the intellect became the source of\r\nstrength and of wealth, it is impossible not to consider every addition\r\nto science, every fresh truth, and every new idea, as a germe of power\r\nplaced within the reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory,\r\nthe grace of wit, the glow of imagination, the depth of thought, and all\r\nthe gifts which are bestowed by Providence with an equal hand, turned\r\nto the advantage of the democracy; and even when they were in the\r\npossession of its adversaries, they still served its cause by throwing\r\ninto relief the natural greatness of man; its conquests spread,\r\ntherefore, with those of civilisation and knowledge; and literature\r\nbecame an arsenal, where the poorest and weakest could always find\r\nweapons to their hand.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the pages of our history, we shall scarcely meet with a\r\nsingle great event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not\r\nturned to the advantage of equality.\r\n\r\nThe crusades and the wars of the English decimated the nobles, and\r\ndivided their possessions; the erection of communes introduced an\r\nelement of democratic liberty into the bosom of feudal monarchy; the\r\ninvention of firearms equalized the villain and the noble on the field\r\nof battle; printing opened the same resources to the minds of all\r\nclasses; the post was organized so as to bring the same information to\r\nthe door of the poor man's cottage and to the gate of the palace; and\r\nprotestantism proclaimed that all men are alike able to find the road\r\nto heaven. The discovery of America offered a thousand new paths to\r\nfortune, and placed riches and power within the reach of the adventurous\r\nand the obscure.\r\n\r\nIf we examine what has happened in France at intervals of fifty years,\r\nbeginning with the eleventh century, we shall invariably perceive that\r\na twofold revolution has taken place in the state of society. The noble\r\nhas gone down on the social ladder, and the _roturier_ has gone up; the\r\none descends as the other rises. Every half-century brings them nearer\r\nto each other, and they will very shortly meet.\r\n\r\nNor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France. Whithersoever we turn\r\nour eyes, we shall discover the same continual revolution throughout the\r\nwhole of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe various occurrences of national existence have everywhere turned to\r\nthe advantage of democracy; all men have aided it by their exertions;\r\nthose who have intentionally labored in its cause, and those who have\r\nserved it unwittingly--those who have fought for it, and those who have\r\ndeclared themselves its opponents--have all been driven along in the\r\nsame track, have all labored to one end, some ignorantly, and some\r\nunwillingly; all have been blind instruments in the hands of God.\r\n\r\nThe gradual development of the equality of conditions is, therefore, a\r\nprovidential fact, and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine\r\ndecree: it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human\r\ninterference, and all events as well as all men contribute to its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nWould it, then, be wise to imagine that a social impulse which dates\r\nfrom so far back, can be checked by the efforts of a generation? Is it\r\ncredible that the democracy which has annihilated the feudal system, and\r\nvanquished kings, will respect the citizen and the capitalist? Will it\r\nstop now that it has grown so strong and its adversaries so weak?\r\n\r\nNone can say which way we are going, for all terms of comparison are\r\nwanting: the equality of conditions is more complete in the Christian,\r\ncountries of the present day, than it has been at any time, or in any\r\npart of the world; so that the extent of what already exists prevents us\r\nfrom foreseeing what may be yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe whole book which is here offered to the public, has been written\r\nunder the impression of a kind of religious dread, produced in the\r\nauthor's mind by the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution,\r\nwhich has advanced for centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles, and\r\nwhich is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that God himself should speak in order to disclose\r\nto us the unquestionable signs of his will; we can discern them in the\r\nhabitual course of nature, and in the invariable tendency of events; I\r\nknow, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the orbits\r\ntraced by the Creator's fingers.\r\n\r\nIf the men of our time were led by attentive observation and by sincere\r\nreflection, to acknowledge that the gradual and progressive development\r\nof social equality is at once the past and future of their history, this\r\nsolitary truth would confer the sacred character of a divine decree\r\nupon the change. To attempt to check democracy would be in that case\r\nto resist the will of God; and the nations would then be constrained to\r\nmake the best of the social lot awarded to them by Providence.\r\n\r\nThe Christian nations of our age seem to me to present a most alarming\r\nspectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so strong that it\r\ncannot be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided:\r\ntheir fate is in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe first duty which is at this time imposed upon those who direct\r\nour affairs is to educate the democracy; to warm its faith, if that be\r\npossible; to purify its morals; to direct its energies; to substitute a\r\nknowledge of business for its inexperience, and an acquaintance with its\r\ntrue interests for its blind propensities; to adapt its government to\r\ntime and place, and to modify it in compliance with the occurrences and\r\nthe actors of the age.\r\n\r\nA new science of politics is indispensable to a new world.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is what we think of least; launched in the middle of a\r\nrapid stream, we obstinately fix our eyes on the ruins which may still\r\nbe descried upon the shore we have left, while the current sweeps us\r\nalong, and drives us backward toward the gulf.\r\n\r\nIn no country in Europe has the great social revolution which I have\r\nbeen describing, made such rapid progress as in France; but it has\r\nalways been borne on by chance. The heads of the state have never had\r\nany forethought for its exigences, and its victories have been obtained\r\nwithout their consent or without their knowledge. The most powerful, the\r\nmost intelligent, and the most moral classes of the nation have never\r\nattempted to connect themselves with it in order to guide it. The people\r\nhave consequently been abandoned to its wild propensities, and it has\r\ngrown up like those outcasts who receive their education in the\r\npublic streets, and who are unacquainted with aught but the vices and\r\nwretchedness of society. The existence of a democracy was seemingly\r\nunknown, when, on a sudden, it took possession of the supreme power.\r\nEverything was then submitted to its caprices; it was worshipped as the\r\nidol of strength; until, when it was enfeebled by its own excesses, the\r\nlegislator conceived the rash project of annihilating its power, instead\r\nof instructing it and correcting its vices; no attempt was made to fit\r\nit to govern, but all were bent on excluding it from the government.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this has been that the democratic revolution has been\r\neffected only in the material parts of society, without that concomitant\r\nchange in laws, ideas, customs, and manners, which was necessary to\r\nrender such a revolution beneficial. We have gotten a democracy, but\r\nwithout the conditions which lessen its vices, and render its natural\r\nadvantages more prominent; and although we already perceive the evils it\r\nbrings, we are ignorant of the benefits it may confer.\r\n\r\nWhile the power of the crown, supported by the aristocracy, peaceably\r\ngoverned the nations of Europe, society possessed, in the midst of its\r\nwretchedness, several different advantages which can now scarcely be\r\nappreciated or conceived.\r\n\r\nThe power of a part of his subjects was an insurmountable barrier to\r\nthe tyranny of the prince; and the monarch who felt the almost divine\r\ncharacter which he enjoyed in the eyes of the multitude, derived a\r\nmotive for the just use of his power from the respect which he inspired.\r\n\r\nHigh as they were placed above the people, the nobles could not but take\r\nthat calm and benevolent interest in its fate which the shepherd feels\r\ntoward his flock; and without acknowledging the poor as their equals,\r\nthey watched over the destiny of those whose welfare Providence had\r\nintrusted to their care.\r\n\r\nThe people, never having conceived the idea of a social condition\r\ndifferent from its own, and entertaining no expectation of ever ranking\r\nwith its chiefs, received benefits from them without discussing their\r\nrights. It grew attached to them when they were clement and just, but it\r\nsubmitted without resistance or servility to their exactions, as to the\r\ninevitable visitations of the arm of God. Custom, and the manners of the\r\ntime, had moreover created a species of law in the midst of violence,\r\nand established certain limits to oppression.\r\n\r\nAs the noble never suspected that any one would attempt to deprive him\r\nof the privileges which he believed to be legitimate, and as the serf\r\nlooked upon his own inferiority as a consequence of the immutable order\r\nof nature, it is easy to imagine that a mutual exchange of good-will\r\ntook place between two classes so differently gifted by fate. Inequality\r\nand wretchedness were then to be found in society; but the souls of\r\nneither rank of men were degraded.\r\n\r\nMen are not corrupted by the exercise of power or debased by the habit\r\nof obedience; but by the exercise of power which they believe to be\r\nillegal, and by obedience to a rule which they consider to be usurped\r\nand oppressive.\r\n\r\nOn one side were wealth, strength, and leisure, accompanied by the\r\nrefinement of luxury, the elegance of taste, the pleasures of wit, and\r\nthe religion of art. On the other were labor, and a rude ignorance; but\r\nin the midst of this coarse and ignorant multitude, it was not uncommon\r\nto meet with energetic passions, generous sentiments, profound religious\r\nconvictions, and independent virtues.\r\n\r\nThe body of a state thus organized, might boast of its stability, its\r\npower, and above all, of its glory.\r\n\r\nBut the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the\r\ndivisions which once severed mankind, are lowered; property is divided,\r\npower is held in common, the light of intelligence spreads, and the\r\ncapacities of all classes are equally cultivated; the state becomes\r\ndemocratic, and the empire of democracy is slowly and peaceably\r\nintroduced into the institutions and manners of the nation.\r\n\r\nI can conceive a society in which all men would profess an equal\r\nattachment and respect for the laws of which they are the common\r\nauthors; in which the authority of the state would be respected as\r\nnecessary, though not as divine; and the loyalty of the subject to\r\nthe chief magistrate would not be a passion, but a quiet and rational\r\npersuasion. Every individual being in the possession of rights which\r\nhe is sure to retain, a kind of manly reliance and reciprocal courtesy\r\nwould arise between all classes, alike removed from pride and meanness.\r\n\r\nThe people, well acquainted with its true interests, would allow, that\r\nin order to profit by the advantages of society, it is necessary to\r\nsatisfy its demands. In this state of things, the voluntary association\r\nof the citizens might supply the individual exertions of the nobles, and\r\nthe community would be alike protected from anarchy and from oppression.\r\n\r\nI admit that in a democratic state thus constituted, society will not\r\nbe stationary; but the impulses of the social body may be regulated\r\nand directed forward; if there be less splendor than in the halls of\r\nan aristocracy, the contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the\r\npleasures of enjoyment may be less excessive, but those of comfort will\r\nbe more general; the sciences may be less perfectly cultivated, but\r\nignorance will be less common; the impetuosity of the feelings will be\r\nrepressed, and the habits of the nation softened; there will be more\r\nvices and fewer crimes.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of enthusiasm and of an ardent faith, great sacrifices\r\nmay be obtained from the members of a commonwealth by an appeal to their\r\nunderstandings and their experience: each individual will feel the\r\nsame necessity for uniting with his fellow-citizens to protect his own\r\nweakness; and as he knows that if they are to assist he must co-operate,\r\nhe will readily perceive that his personal interest is identified with\r\nthe interest of the community.\r\n\r\nThe nation, taken as a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious,\r\nand perhaps less strong; but the majority of the citizens will enjoy\r\na greater degree of prosperity, and the people will remain quiet, not\r\nbecause it despairs of melioration, but because it is conscious of the\r\nadvantages of its condition.\r\n\r\nIf all the consequences of this state of things were not good or useful,\r\nsociety would at least have appropriated all such as were useful and\r\ngood; and having once and for ever renounced the social advantages of\r\naristocracy, mankind would enter into possession of all the benefits\r\nwhich democracy can afford.\r\n\r\nBut here it may be asked what we have adopted in the place of those\r\ninstitutions, those ideas, and those customs of our forefathers which we\r\nhave abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been succeeded by the\r\nmajesty of the laws; the people have learned to despise all authority.\r\nBut fear now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than that which was\r\nformerly paid by reverence and by love.\r\n\r\nI perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were\r\nable to cope with tyranny single-handed; but it is the government\r\nthat has inherited the privileges of which families, corporations, and\r\nindividuals, have been deprived; the weakness of the whole community\r\nhas, therefore, succeeded to that influence of a small body of citizens,\r\nwhich, if it was sometimes oppressive, was often conservative.\r\n\r\nThe division of property has lessened the distance which separated the\r\nrich from the poor; but it would seem that the nearer they draw to each\r\nother, the greater is their mutual hatred, and the more vehement the\r\nenvy and the dread with which they resist each other's claims to power;\r\nthe notion of right is alike insensible to both classes, and force\r\naffords to both the only argument for the present, and the only\r\nguarantee for the future.\r\n\r\nThe poor man retains the prejudices of his forefathers without their\r\nfaith, and their ignorance without their virtues; he has adopted\r\nthe doctrine of self-interest as the rule of his actions, without\r\nunderstanding the science which controls it, and his egotism is no less\r\nblind than his devotedness was formerly.\r\n\r\nIf society is tranquil, it is not because it relies upon its strength\r\nand its well-being, but because it knows its weakness and its\r\ninfirmities; a single effort may cost it its life; everybody feels the\r\nevil, but no one has courage or energy enough to seek the cure; the\r\ndesires, the regret, the sorrows, and the joys of the time, produce\r\nnothing that is visible or permanent, like the passions of old men which\r\nterminate in impotence.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old state of things\r\nafforded, without receiving any compensation from our present condition;\r\nhaving destroyed an aristocracy, we seem inclined to survey its ruins\r\nwith complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of them.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which the intellectual world presents, are not less\r\ndeplorable. The democracy of France, checked in its course or abandoned\r\nto its lawless passions, has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and\r\nhas shaken all that it has not destroyed. Its control over society has\r\nnot been gradually introduced, or peaceably established, but it has\r\nconstantly advanced in the midst of disorder, and the agitation of a\r\nconflict. In the heat of the struggle each partisan is hurried beyond\r\nthe limits of his opinions by the opinions and the excesses of his\r\nopponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds a\r\nlanguage which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts. Hence\r\narises the strange confusion which we are beholding.\r\n\r\nI cannot recall to my mind a passage in history more worthy of sorrow\r\nand of pity than the scenes which are happening under our eyes; it is as\r\nif the natural bond which unites the opinions of man to his tastes, and\r\nhis actions to his principles, was now broken; the sympathy which has\r\nalways been acknowledged between the feelings and the ideas of mankind,\r\nappears to be dissolved, and all the laws of moral analogy to be\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nZealous Christians may be found among us, whose minds are nurtured in\r\nthe love and knowledge of a future life, and who readily espouse\r\nthe cause of human liberty, as the source of all moral greatness.\r\nChristianity, which has declared that all men are equal in the sight of\r\nGod, will not refuse to acknowledge that all citizens are equal in the\r\neye of the law. But, by a singular concourse of events, religion is\r\nentangled in those institutions which democracy assails, and it is not\r\nunfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves, and to curse that\r\ncause of liberty as a foe, which it might hallow by its alliance.\r\n\r\nBy the side of these religious men I discern others whose looks are\r\nturned to the earth more than to heaven; they are the partisans of\r\nliberty, not only as the source of the noblest virtues, but more\r\nespecially as the root of all solid advantages; and they sincerely\r\ndesire to extend its sway, and to impart its blessings to mankind. It\r\nis natural that they should hasten to invoke the assistance of religion,\r\nfor they must know that liberty cannot be established without morality,\r\nnor morality without faith; but they have seen religion in the ranks of\r\ntheir adversaries, and they inquire no farther; some of them attack it\r\nopenly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.\r\n\r\nIn former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal and\r\nslavish-minded, while the independent and the warm-hearted were\r\nstruggling without hope to save the liberties of mankind. But men of\r\nhigh and generous characters are now to be met with, whose opinions are\r\nat variance with their inclinations, and who praise that servility which\r\nthey have themselves never known. Others, on the contrary, speak in\r\nthe name of liberty as if they were able to feel its sanctity and its\r\nmajesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights which they have\r\nalways disowned.\r\n\r\nThere are virtuous and peaceful individuals whose pure morality, quiet\r\nhabits, affluence, and talents, fit them to be the leaders of the\r\nsurrounding population; their love of their country is sincere, and they\r\nare prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its welfare, but they\r\nconfound the abuses of civilisation with its benefits, and the idea of\r\nevil is inseparable in their minds from that of novelty.\r\n\r\nNot far from this class is another party, whose object is to materialise\r\nmankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what is just;\r\nto acquire knowledge without faith, and prosperity apart from virtue;\r\nassuming the title of the champions of modern civilisation, and placing\r\nthemselves in a station which they usurp with insolence, and from which\r\nthey are driven by their own unworthiness.\r\n\r\nWhere are we then?\r\n\r\nThe religionists are the enemies of liberty, and the friends of liberty\r\nattack religion; the high-minded and the noble advocate subjection,\r\nand the meanest and most servile minds preach independence; honest and\r\nenlightened citizens are opposed to all progress, while men without\r\npatriotism and without principles, are the apostles of civilisation and\r\nof intelligence.\r\n\r\nHas such been the fate of the centuries which have preceded our own?\r\nand has man always inhabited a world, like the present, where nothing\r\nis linked together, where virtue is without genius, and genius\r\nwithout honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste for\r\noppression, and the holy rites of freedom with a contempt of law;\r\nwhere the light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim, and\r\nwhere nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or allowed, honorable or\r\nshameful, false or true?\r\n\r\nI cannot, however, believe that the Creator made man to leave him in an\r\nendless struggle with the intellectual miseries which surround us:\r\nGod destines a calmer and a more certain future to the communities of\r\nEurope; I am unacquainted with his designs, but I shall not cease to\r\nbelieve in them because I cannot fathom them, and I had rather mistrust\r\nmy own capacity than his justice.\r\n\r\nThere is a country in the world where the great revolution which I am\r\nspeaking of seems nearly to have reached its natural limits; it has\r\nbeen effected with ease and simplicity, say rather that this country\r\nhas attained the consequences of the democratic revolution which we are\r\nundergoing, without having experienced the revolution itself.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of America in the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, severed the democratic principle\r\nfrom all the principles which repressed it in the old communities of\r\nEurope, and transplanted it unalloyed to the New World. It has there\r\nbeen allowed to spread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its\r\nconsequences in the laws by influencing the manners of the country.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me beyond a doubt, that sooner or later we shall arrive,\r\nlike the Americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. But I\r\ndo not conclude from this, that we shall ever be necessarily led to draw\r\nthe same political consequences which the Americans have derived from\r\na similar social organization. I am far from supposing that they have\r\nchosen the only form of government which a democracy may adopt; but the\r\nidentity of the efficient cause of laws and manners in the two countries\r\nis sufficient to account for the immense interest we have in becoming\r\nacquainted with its effects in each of them.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that I have\r\nexamined America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may\r\nourselves profit. Whoever should imagine that I have intended to write a\r\npanegyric would be strangely mistaken, and on reading this book, he\r\nwill perceive that such was not my design: nor has it been my object to\r\nadvocate any form of government in particular, for I am of opinion that\r\nabsolute excellence is rarely to be found in any legislation; I have not\r\neven affected to discuss whether the social revolution, which I believe\r\nto be irresistible, is advantageous or prejudicial to mankind; I have\r\nacknowledged this revolution as a fact already accomplished or on the\r\neve of its accomplishment; and I have selected the nation, from among\r\nthose which have undergone it, in which its development has been the\r\nmost peaceful and the most complete, in order to discern its natural\r\nconsequences, and, if it be possible, to distinguish the means by which\r\nit may be rendered profitable. I confess that in America I saw more than\r\nAmerica; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations,\r\nits character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what\r\nwe have to fear or to hope from its progress.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this work I have attempted to show the tendency\r\ngiven to the laws by the democracy of America, which is abandoned almost\r\nwithout restraint to its instinctive propensities; and to exhibit the\r\ncourse it prescribes to the government, and the influence it exercises\r\non affairs. I have sought to discover the evils and the advantages which\r\nit produces. I have examined the precautions used by the Americans to\r\ndirect it, as well as those which they have not adopted, and I have\r\nundertaken to point out the causes which enable it to govern society.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to depict, in a second part, the influence which the\r\nequality of conditions and the rule of democracy exercise on the civil\r\nsociety, the habits, the ideas, and the manners of the Americans;\r\nI begin, however, to feel less ardor for the accomplishment of this\r\nproject, since the excellent work of my friend and travelling companion\r\nM. de Beaumont has been given to the world.[1] I do not know whether I\r\nhave succeeded in making known what I saw in America, but I am certain\r\nthat such has been my sincere desire, and that I have never, knowingly,\r\nmoulded facts to ideas, instead of ideas to facts.\r\n\r\nWhenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents,\r\nI have had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and\r\napproved works.[2] I have cited my authorities in the notes, and any one\r\nmay refer to them. Whenever an opinion, a political custom, or a remark\r\non the manners of the country was concerned, I endeavored to consult the\r\nmost enlightened men I met with. If the point in question was important\r\nor doubtful, I was not satisfied with one testimony, but I formed my\r\nopinion on the evidence of several witnesses. Here the reader must\r\nnecessarily believe me upon my word. I could frequently have quoted\r\nnames which are either known to him, or which deserve to be so, in proof\r\nof what I advance; but I have carefully abstained from this practice. A\r\nstranger frequently hears important truths at the fireside of his host,\r\nwhich the latter would perhaps conceal even from the ear of friendship;\r\nhe consoles himself with his guest, for the silence to which he is\r\nrestricted, and the shortness of the traveller's stay takes away all\r\nfear of his indiscretion. I carefully noted every conversation of this\r\nnature as soon as it occurred, but these notes will never leave my\r\nwriting-case; I had rather injure the success of my statements than\r\nadd my name to the list of those strangers who repay the generous\r\nhospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and annoyance.\r\n\r\nI am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be easier than to\r\ncriticise this book, if any one ever chooses to criticise it.\r\n\r\nThose readers who may examine it closely will discover the fundamental\r\nidea which connects the several parts together. But the diversity of the\r\nsubjects I have had to treat is exceedingly great, and it will not be\r\ndifficult to oppose an isolated fact to the body of facts which I quote,\r\nor an isolated idea to the body of ideas I put forth. I hope to be read\r\nin the spirit which has guided my labors, and that my book may be judged\r\nby the general impression it leaves, as I have formed my own judgment\r\nnot on any single reason, but upon the mass of evidence.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the author who wishes to be understood is\r\nobliged to push all his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences,\r\nand often to the verge of what is false or impracticable; for if it be\r\nnecessary sometimes to quit the rules of logic in active life, such\r\nis not the case in discourse, and a man finds that almost as many\r\ndifficulties spring from inconsistency of language, as usually arise\r\nfrom consistency of conduct.\r\n\r\nI conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider\r\nthe principal defect of the work. This book is written to favor no\r\nparticular views, and in composing it I have entertained no design\r\nof serving or attacking any party: I have undertaken not to see\r\ndifferently, but to look farther than parties, and while they are busied\r\nfor the morrow, I have turned my thoughts to the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[1] This work is entitled, Marie, ou l'Esclavage aux Etats-Unis.\r\n\r\n[2] Legislative and administrative documents have been furnished me with\r\na degree of politeness which I shall always remember with gratitude.\r\nAmong the American functionaries who thus favored my inquiries I am\r\nproud to name Mr. Edward Livingston, then Secretary of State and late\r\nAmerican minister at Paris. During my stay at the session of Congress,\r\nMr. Livingston was kind enough to furnish me with the greater part\r\nof the documents I possess relative to the federal government.

A simple but grand arrangement is\r\ndiscoverable amid the confusion of objects and the prodigious variety of\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nThis continent is divided, almost equally, into two vast regions, one of\r\nwhich is bounded, on the north by the arctic pole, and by the two great\r\noceans on the east and west. It stretches toward the south, forming a\r\ntriangle, whose irregular sides meet at length below the great lakes of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe second region begins where the other terminates, and includes all\r\nthe remainder of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe one slopes gently toward the pole, the other toward the equator.\r\n\r\nThe territory comprehended in the first regions descends toward the\r\nnorth with so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form\r\na level plain. Within the bounds of this immense tract of country there\r\nare neither high mountains nor deep valleys. Streams meander through it\r\nirregularly; great rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again,\r\ndisperse and form vast marshes, losing all trace of their channels\r\nin the labyrinth of waters they have themselves created; and thus, at\r\nlength, after innumerable windings, fall into the polar seas. The great\r\nlakes which bound this first region are not walled in, like most of\r\nthose in the Old World, between hills and rocks. Their banks are flat,\r\nand rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each of them\r\nthus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in the\r\nstructure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either toward\r\nthe pole or to the tropical sea.\r\n\r\nThe second region is more varied on its surface, and better suited for\r\nthe habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains divide it from one\r\nextreme to the other; the Allegany ridge takes the form of the shores of\r\nthe Atlantic ocean; the other is parallel with the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe space which lies between these two chains of mountains contains\r\n1,341,649 square miles.[3] Its surface is therefore about six times as\r\ngreat as that of France.\r\n\r\nThis vast territory, however, forms a single valley, one side of which\r\ndescends gradually from the rounded summits of the Alleganies, while\r\nthe other rises in an uninterrupted course toward the tops of the Rocky\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the valley flows an immense river, into which the\r\nvarious streams issuing from the mountains fall from all parts. In\r\nmemory of their native land, the French formerly called this the river\r\nSt. Louis. The Indians, in their pompous language, have named it the\r\nFather of Waters, or the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two great\r\nregions of which I have spoken, not far from the highest point of the\r\ntable-land where they unite. Near the same spot rises another river,[4]\r\nwhich empties itself into the polar seas. The course of the Mississippi\r\nis at first devious: it winds several times toward the north, whence it\r\nrose; and, at length, after having been delayed in lakes and marshes, it\r\nflows slowly onward to the south.\r\n\r\nSometimes quietly gliding along the argillaceous bed which nature has\r\nassigned to it, sometimes swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters\r\n2,500 miles in its course.[5] At the distance of 1,364 miles from its\r\nmouth this river attains an average depth of fifteen feet; and it is\r\nnavigated by vessels of 300 tons burden for a course of nearly 500\r\nmiles. Fifty-seven large navigable rivers contribute to swell the waters\r\nof the Mississippi; among others the Missouri, which traverses a space\r\nof 2,500 miles; the Arkansas of 1,300 miles; the Red river 1,000\r\nmiles; four whose course is from 800 to 1000 miles in length, viz., the\r\nIllinois, the St. Peter's, the St. Francis, and the Moingona; besides a\r\ncountless number of rivulets which unite from all parts their tributary\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nThe valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems formed to be the\r\nbed of this mighty river, which like a god of antiquity dispenses both\r\ngood and evil in its course. On the shores of the stream nature displays\r\nan inexhaustible fertility; in proportion as you recede from its banks,\r\nthe powers of vegetation languish, the soil becomes poor, and the plants\r\nthat survive have a sickly growth. Nowhere have the great convulsions\r\nof the globe left more evident traces than in the valley of the\r\nMississippi: the whole aspect of the country shows the powerful effects\r\nof water, both by its fertility and by its barrenness. The waters of\r\nthe primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of vegetable mould in the\r\nvalley, which they levelled as they retired. Upon the right shore of the\r\nriver are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the husbandman had passed\r\nover them with his roller. As you approach the mountains, the soil\r\nbecomes more and more unequal and sterile; the ground is, as it were,\r\npierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks, which appear like the\r\nbones of a skeleton whose flesh is partly consumed. The surface of the\r\nearth is covered with a granitic sand, and huge irregular masses\r\nof stone, among which a few plants force their growth, and give the\r\nappearance of a green field covered with the ruins of a vast edifice.\r\nThese stones and this sand discover, on examination, a perfect analogy\r\nwith those which compose the arid and broken summits of the Rocky\r\nmountains. The flood of waters which washed the soil to the bottom of\r\nthe valley, afterward carried away portions of the rocks themselves;\r\nand these, dashed and bruised against the neighboring cliffs, were left\r\nscattered like wrecks at their feet.[6]\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Mississippi is, upon the whole, the most magnificent\r\ndwelling-place prepared by God for man's abode; and yet it may be said\r\nthat at present it is but a mighty desert.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the Alleganies, between the base of these\r\nmountains and the Atlantic ocean, lies a long ridge of rocks and sand,\r\nwhich the sea appears to have left behind as it retired. The mean\r\nbreadth of this territory does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is\r\nabout nine hundred miles in length. This part of the American continent\r\nhas a soil which offers every obstacle to the husbandman, and its\r\nvegetation is scanty and unvaried.\r\n\r\nUpon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of human industry\r\nwere made. This tongue of arid land was the cradle of those English\r\ncolonies which were destined one day to become the United States of\r\nAmerica. The centre of power still remains there; while in the backward\r\nStates the true elements of the great people, to whom the future control\r\nof the continent belongs, are secretly springing up.\r\n\r\nWhen the Europeans first landed on the shores of the Antilles, and\r\nafterwards on the coast of South America, they thought themselves\r\ntransported into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. The sea\r\nsparkled with phosphoric light, and the extraordinary transparency of\r\nits waters discovered to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto\r\nbeen hidden in the deep abyss.[7] Here and there appeared little islands\r\nperfumed with odoriferous plants, and resembling baskets of flowers,\r\nfloating on the tranquil surface of the ocean. Every object which met\r\nthe sight, in this enchanting region, seemed prepared to satisfy the\r\nwants, or contribute to the pleasures of man. Almost all the trees were\r\nloaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as food,\r\ndelighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors. In\r\ngroves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles, acacias,\r\nand oleanders, which were hung with festoons of various climbing-plants,\r\ncovered with flowers, a multitude of birds unknown in Europe displayed\r\ntheir bright plumage, glittering with purple and azure, and mingled\r\ntheir warbling in the harmony of a world teeming with life and\r\nmotion.[8]\r\n\r\nUnderneath this brilliant exterior death was concealed. The air of these\r\nclimates had so enervating an influence that man, completely absorbed by\r\nthe present enjoyment, was rendered regardless of the future.\r\n\r\nNorth America appeared under a very different aspect; there, everything\r\nwas grave, serious, and solemn; it seemed created to be the domain of\r\nintelligence, as the south was that of sensual delight. A turbulent and\r\nfoggy ocean washed its shores. It was girded round by a belt of granite\r\nrocks, or by wide plains of sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and\r\ngloomy; for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild\r\nolive-trees, and laurels.\r\n\r\nBeyond this outer belt lay the thick shades of the central forests,\r\nwhere the largest trees which are produced in the two hemispheres grow\r\nside by side. The plane, the catalpa, the sugar-maple, and the Virginian\r\npoplar, mingled their branches with those of the oak, the beech, and the\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nIn these, as in the forests of the Old World, destruction was\r\nperpetually going on. The ruins of vegetation were heaped upon each\r\nother; but there was no laboring hand to remove them, and their\r\ndecay was not rapid enough to make room for the continual work of\r\nreproduction. Climbing-plants, grasses and other herbs, forced their way\r\nthrough the moss of dying trees; they crept along their bending trunks,\r\nfound nourishment in their dusty cavities, and a passage beneath\r\nthe lifeless bark. Thus decay gave its assistance to life, and their\r\nrespective productions were mingled together. The depths of these\r\nforests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand rivulets, undirected in\r\ntheir course by human industry, preserved in them a constant moisture.\r\nIt was rare to meet with flowers, wild fruits, or birds, beneath their\r\nshades. The fall of a tree overthrown by age, the rushing torrent of a\r\ncataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the howling of the wind, were\r\nthe only sounds which broke the silence of nature.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the great river the woods almost disappeared; in their\r\nstead were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether nature in her\r\ninfinite variety had denied the germes of trees to these fertile\r\nplains, or whether they had once been covered with forests, subsequently\r\ndestroyed by the hand of man, is a question which neither tradition nor\r\nscientific research has been able to resolve.\r\n\r\nThese immense deserts were not, however, devoid of human inhabitants.\r\nSome wandering tribes had been for ages scattered among the forest\r\nshades or the green pastures of the prairie. From the mouth of the St.\r\nLawrence to the Delta of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific ocean, these savages possessed certain points of resemblance\r\nwhich bore witness of their common origin: but at the same time they\r\ndiffered from all other known races of men:[9] they were neither white\r\nlike the Europeans, nor yellow like most of the Asiatics, nor black like\r\nthe negroes. Their skin was reddish brown, their hair long and shining,\r\ntheir lips thin, and their cheek-bones very prominent. The languages\r\nspoken by the North American tribes were various as far as regarded\r\ntheir words, but they were subject to the same grammatical rules. Those\r\nrules differed in several points from such as had been observed to\r\ngovern the origin of language.\r\n\r\nThe idiom of the Americans seemed to be the product of new combinations,\r\nand bespoke an effort of the understanding, of which the Indians of our\r\ndays would be incapable.[10]\r\n\r\nThe social state of these tribes differed also in many respects from all\r\nthat was seen in the Old World. They seemed to have multiplied freely in\r\nthe midst of their deserts, without coming in contact with other races\r\nmore civilized than their own.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they exhibited none of those indistinct, incoherent notions\r\nof right and wrong, none of that deep corruption of manners that is\r\nusually joined with ignorance and rudeness among nations which, after\r\nadvancing to civilisation, have relapsed into a state of barbarism. The\r\nIndian was indebted to no one but himself; his virtues, his vices,\r\nand his prejudices, were his own work; he had grown up in the wild\r\nindependence of his nature.\r\n\r\nIf, in polished countries, the lowest of the people are rude and\r\nuncivil, it is not merely because they are poor and ignorant, but that,\r\nbeing so, they are in daily contact with rich and enlightened men.\r\nThe sight of their own hard lot and of their weakness, which are\r\ndaily contrasted with the happiness and power of some of their fellow\r\ncreatures, excites in their hearts at the same time the sentiments of\r\nanger and of fear: the consciousness of their inferiority and of their\r\ndependence irritates while it humiliates them. This state of mind\r\ndisplays itself in their manners and language; they are at once insolent\r\nand servile. The truth of this is easily proved by observation; the\r\npeople are more rude in aristocratic countries than elsewhere; in\r\nopulent cities than in rural districts. In those places where the rich\r\nand powerful are assembled together, the weak and the indigent feel\r\nthemselves oppressed by their inferior condition. Unable to perceive a\r\nsingle chance of regaining their equality, they give up to despair, and\r\nallow themselves to fall below the dignity of human nature.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is not observable\r\nin savage life; the Indians, although they are ignorant and poor, are\r\nequal and free.\r\n\r\nAt the period when Europeans first came among them, the natives of North\r\nAmerica were ignorant of the value of riches, and indifferent to the\r\nenjoyments which civilized man procures to himself by their means.\r\nNevertheless there was nothing coarse in their demeanor; they practised\r\nan habitual reserve, and a kind of aristocratic politeness.\r\n\r\nMild and hospitable when at peace, though merciless in war beyond any\r\nknown degree of human ferocity, the Indian would expose himself to die\r\nof hunger in order to succor the stranger who asked admittance by night\r\nat the door of his hut--yet he could tear in pieces with his hands the\r\nstill quivering limbs of his prisoner. The famous republics of antiquity\r\nnever gave examples of more unshaken courage, more haughty spirits, or\r\nmore intractable love of independence, than were hidden in former times\r\namong the wild forests of the New World.[11] The Europeans produced\r\nno great impression when they landed upon the shores of North America:\r\ntheir presence engendered neither envy nor fear. What influence could\r\nthey possess over such men as we have described? The Indian could live\r\nwithout wants, suffer without complaint, and pour out his death-song\r\nat the stake.[12] Like all the other members of the great human family,\r\nthese savages believed in the existence of a better world, and adored,\r\nunder different names, God, the Creator of the universe. Their\r\nnotions on the great intellectual truths were, in general, simple and\r\nphilosophical.[13]\r\n\r\nAlthough we have here traced the character of a primitive people, yet it\r\ncannot be doubted that another people, more civilized and more advanced\r\nin all respects, had preceded it in the same regions.\r\n\r\nAn obscure tradition, which prevailed among the Indians to the north of\r\nthe Atlantic, informs us that these very tribes formerly dwelt on\r\nthe west side of the Mississippi. Along the banks of the Ohio, and\r\nthroughout the central valley, there are frequently found, at this day,\r\n_tumuli_ raised by the hands of men. On exploring these heaps of\r\nearth to their centre, it is usual to meet with human bones, strange\r\ninstruments, arms and utensils of all kinds, made of a metal, or\r\ndestined for purposes, unknown to the present race.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of our time are unable to give any information relative to\r\nthe history of this unknown people. Neither did those who lived three\r\nhundred years ago, when America was first discovered, leave any\r\naccounts from which even an hypothesis could be formed. Tradition--that\r\nperishable, yet ever-renewed monument of the pristine world--throws no\r\nlight upon the subject. It is an undoubted fact, however, that in this\r\npart of the globe thousands of our fellow-beings had lived. When they\r\ncame hither, what was their origin, their destiny, their history, and\r\nhow they perished, no one can tell.\r\n\r\nHow strange does it appear that nations have existed, and afterward so\r\ncompletely disappeared from the earth, that the remembrance of their\r\nvery name is effaced: their languages are lost; their glory is vanished\r\nlike a sound without an echo; but perhaps there is not one which has\r\nnot left behind it a tomb in memory of its passage. The most durable\r\nmonument of human labor is that which recalls the wretchedness and\r\nnothingness of man.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vast country which we have been describing was inhabited\r\nby many indigenous tribes, it may justly be said, at the time of its\r\ndiscovery by Europeans, to have formed one great desert. The Indians\r\noccupied, without possessing it. It is by agricultural labor that man\r\nappropriates the soil, and the early inhabitants of North America\r\nlived by the produce of the chase. Their implacable prejudices, their\r\nuncontrolled passions, their vices, and still more, perhaps, their\r\nsavage virtues, consigned them to inevitable destruction. The ruin of\r\nthese nations began from the day when Europeans landed on their shores:\r\nit has proceeded ever since, and we are now seeing the completion of it.\r\nThey seemed to have been placed by Providence amid the riches of the New\r\nWorld to enjoy them for a season, and then surrender them. Those coasts,\r\nso admirably adapted for commerce and industry; those wide and deep\r\nrivers; that inexhaustible valley of the Mississippi; the whole\r\ncontinent, in short, seemed prepared to be the abode of a great nation,\r\nyet unborn.\r\n\r\nIn that land the great experiment was to be made by civilized man, of\r\nthe attempt to construct society upon a new basis; and it was there, for\r\nthe first time, that theories hitherto unknown, or deemed impracticable,\r\nwere to exhibit a spectacle for which the world had not been prepared by\r\nthe history of the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[3] Darby's \"View of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[4] Mackenzie's river.\r\n\r\n[5] Warden's \"Description of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[6] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[7] Malte Brun tells us (vol. v., p. 726) that the water of the\r\nCaribbean sea is so transparent, that corals and fish are discernible\r\nat a depth of sixty fathoms. The ship seemed to float in the air, the\r\nnavigator became giddy as his eye penetrated through the crystal flood,\r\nand beheld submarine gardens, or beds of shells, or gilded fishes\r\ngliding among tufts and thickets of seaweed.\r\n\r\n[8] See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[9] With the progress of discovery, some resemblance has been found to\r\nexist between the physical conformation, the language, and the habits\r\nof the Indians of North America, and those of the Tongous, Mantchous,\r\nMoguls, Tartars, and other wandering tribes of Asia. The land occupied\r\nby these tribes is not very distant from Behring's strait; which allows\r\nof the supposition, that at a remote period they gave inhabitants to the\r\ndesert continent of America. But this is a point which has not yet been\r\nclearly elucidated by science. See Malte Brun, vol. v.; the works of\r\nHumboldt; Fischer, \"Conjecture sur l'Origine des Américains;\" Adair,\r\n\"History of the American Indians.\"\r\n\r\n[10] See Appendix C.\r\n\r\n[11] We learn from President Jefferson's \"Notes upon Virginia,\" p. 148,\r\nthat among the Iroquois, when attacked by a superior force, aged men\r\nrefused to fly, or to survive the destruction of their country; and they\r\nbraved death like the ancient Romans when their capital was sacked by\r\nthe Gauls. Further on, p. 150, he tells us, that there is no example of\r\nan Indian, who, having fallen into the hands of his enemies, begged for\r\nhis life; on the contrary, the captive sought to obtain death at the\r\nhands of his conquerors by the use of insult and provocation.\r\n\r\n[12] See \"Histoire de la Louisiane,\" by Lepage Dupratz; Charlevoix,\r\n\"Histoire de la Nouvelle France;\" \"Lettres du Rev. G. Hecwelder;\"\r\n\"Transactions of the American Philosophical Society,\" v. i.; Jefferson's\r\n\"Notes on Virginia,\" pp. 135-190. What is said by Jefferson is of\r\nespecial weight, on account of the personal merit of the writer, and of\r\nthe matter-of-fact age in which he lived.\r\n\r\n[13] See Appendix D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANS AND ITS IMPORTANCE, IN RELATION TO THEIR\r\nFUTURE CONDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtility of knowing the Origin of Nations in order to understand their\r\nsocial Condition and their Laws.--America the only Country in which the\r\nStarting-Point of a great People has been clearly observable.--In what\r\nrespects all who emigrated to British America were similar.--In what\r\nthey differed.--Remark applicable to all the Europeans who established\r\nthemselves on the shores of the New World.--Colonization of\r\nVirginia.--Colonization of New England.--Original Character of the first\r\ninhabitants of New England.--Their Arrival.--Their first\r\nLaws.--Their social Contract.--Penal Code borrowed from the Hebrew\r\nLegislation.--Religious Fervor.--Republican Spirit.--Intimate Union of\r\nthe Spirit of Religion with the Spirit of Liberty.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of a human being, his early years are obscurely spent in\r\nthe toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up, the world receives\r\nhim, when his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his\r\nfellows. He is then studied for the first time, and it is imagined that\r\nthe germe of the vices and the virtues of his maturer years is then\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThis, if I am not mistaken, is a great error. We must begin higher up;\r\nwe must watch the infant in his mother's arms; we must see the first\r\nimages which the external world casts upon the dark mirror of his mind;\r\nthe first occurrences which he beholds; we must hear the first words\r\nwhich awaken the sleeping powers of thought, and stand by his earliest\r\nefforts, if we would understand the prejudices, the habits, and the\r\npassions, which will rule his life. The entire man is, so to speak, to\r\nbe seen in the cradle of the child.\r\n\r\nThe growth of nations presents something analogous to this; they all\r\nbear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied\r\ntheir birth and contributed to their rise, affect the whole term of\r\ntheir being.\r\n\r\nIf we were able to go back to the elements of states, and to examine the\r\noldest monuments of their history, I doubt not that we should discover\r\nthe primary cause of the prejudices, the habits, the ruling passions,\r\nand in short of all that constitutes what is called the national\r\ncharacter: we should then find the explanation of certain customs which\r\nnow seem at variance with prevailing manners, of such laws as conflict\r\nwith established principles, and of such incoherent opinions as are\r\nhere and there to be met with in society, like those fragments of broken\r\nchains which we sometimes see hanging from the vault of an edifice, and\r\nsupporting nothing. This might explain the destinies of certain nations\r\nwhich seem borne along by an unknown force to ends of which they\r\nthemselves are ignorant. But hitherto facts have been wanting to\r\nresearches of this kind: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon\r\ncommunities in their latter days; and when they at length turned their\r\nattention to contemplate their origin, time had already obscured it, or\r\nignorance and pride adorned it with truth-concealing fables.\r\n\r\nAmerica is the only country in which it has been possible to study\r\nthe natural and tranquil growth of society, and where the influence\r\nexercised on the future condition of states by their origin is clearly\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the people of Europe landed in the New World, their\r\nnational characteristics were already completely formed; each of them\r\nhad a physiognomy of its own; and as they had already attained that\r\nstage of civilisation at which men are led to study themselves, they\r\nhave transmitted to us a faithful picture of their opinions, their\r\nmanners, and their laws. The men of the sixteenth century are almost as\r\nwell known to us as our contemporaries. America consequently exhibits in\r\nthe broad light of day the phenomena which the ignorance or rudeness of\r\nearlier ages conceals from our researches. Near enough to the time when\r\nthe states of America were founded to be accurately acquainted with\r\ntheir elements, and sufficiently removed from that period to judge\r\nof some of their results. The men of our own day seem destined to\r\nsee farther than their predecessors into the series of human events.\r\nProvidence has given us a torch which our forefathers did not possess,\r\nand has allowed us to discern fundamental causes in the history of the\r\nworld which the obscurity of the past concealed from them.\r\n\r\nIf we carefully examine the social and political state of America, after\r\nhaving studied its history, we shall remain perfectly convinced that\r\nnot an opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may even say not an event,\r\nis upon record which the origin of that people will not explain. The\r\nreaders of this book will find the germe of all that is to follow in the\r\npresent chapter, and the key to almost the whole work.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants who came at different periods to occupy the territory\r\nnow covered by the American Union, differed from each other in many\r\nrespects; their aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on\r\ndifferent principles.\r\n\r\nThese men had, however, certain features in common, and they were all\r\nplaced in an analogous situation. The tie of language is perhaps the\r\nstrongest and most durable that can unite mankind. All the emigrants\r\nspoke the same tongue; they were all offsets from the same people. Born\r\nin a country which had been agitated for centuries by the struggles\r\nof faction, and in which all parties had been obliged in their turn\r\nto place themselves under the protection of the laws, their political\r\neducation had been perfected in this rude school, and they were more\r\nconversant with the notions of right, and the principles of true\r\nfreedom, than the greater part of their European contemporaries. At the\r\nperiod of the first emigrations, the parish system, that fruitful germe\r\nof free institutions, was deeply rooted in the habits of the English;\r\nand with it the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had been\r\nintroduced even into the bosom of the monarchy of the house of Tudor.\r\n\r\nThe religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian world were then\r\nrife. England had plunged into the new order of things with headlong\r\nvehemence. The character of its inhabitants, which had always been\r\nsedate and reflecting, became argumentative and austere. General\r\ninformation had been increased by intellectual debate, and the mind\r\nhad received a deeper cultivation. While religion was the topic of\r\ndiscussion, the morals of the people were reformed. All these national\r\nfeatures are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of those\r\nadventurers who came to seek a new home on the opposite shores of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nAnother remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion to recur, is\r\napplicable not only to the English, but to the French, the Spaniards,\r\nand all the Europeans who successively established themselves in the New\r\nWorld. All these European colonies contained the elements, if not the\r\ndevelopment of a complete democracy. Two causes led to this result. It\r\nmay safely be advanced, that on leaving the mother-country the emigrants\r\nhad in general no notion of superiority over one another. The happy and\r\nthe powerful do not go into exile, and there are no surer guarantees of\r\nequality among men than poverty and misfortune. It happened, however,\r\non several occasions that persons of rank were driven to America\r\nby political and religious quarrels. Laws were made to establish a\r\ngradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil of America was\r\nentirely opposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring that refractory\r\nland into cultivation, the constant and interested exertions of the\r\nowner himself were necessary; and when the ground was prepared, its\r\nproduce was found to be insufficient to enrich a master and a farmer\r\nat the same time. The land was then naturally broken up into small\r\nportions, which the proprietor cultivated for himself. Land is the basis\r\nof an aristocracy, which clings to the soil that supports it; for it\r\nis not by privileges alone, nor by birth, but by landed property handed\r\ndown from generation to generation, that an aristocracy is constituted.\r\nA nation may present immense fortunes and extreme wretchedness; but\r\nunless those fortunes are territorial, there is no aristocracy, but\r\nsimply the class of the rich and that of the poor.\r\n\r\nAll the British colonies had then a great degree of similarity at the\r\nepoch of their settlement. All of them, from their first beginning,\r\nseemed destined to behold the growth, not of the aristocratic liberty of\r\ntheir mother-country, but of that freedom of the middle and lower orders\r\nof which the history of the world has as yet furnished no complete\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIn this general uniformity several striking differences were however\r\ndiscernible, which it is necessary to point out. Two branches may be\r\ndistinguished in the Anglo-American family, which have hitherto grown\r\nup without entirely commingling; the one in the south, the other in the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nVirginia received the first English colony; the emigrants took\r\npossession of it in 1607. The idea that mines of gold and silver are\r\nthe sources of national wealth, was at that time singularly prevalent in\r\nEurope; a fatal delusion, which has done more to impoverish the nations\r\nwhich adopted it, and has cost more lives in America, than the united\r\ninfluence of war and bad laws. The men sent to Virginia[14] were seekers\r\nof gold, adventurers without resources and without character, whose\r\nturbulent and restless spirits endangered the infant colony,[15] and\r\nrendered its progress uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists arrived\r\nafterward; and although they were a more moral and orderly race of\r\nmen, they were in nowise above the level of the inferior classes in\r\nEngland.[16] No lofty conceptions, no intellectual system directed the\r\nfoundation of these new settlements. The colony was scarcely established\r\nwhen slavery was introduced,[17] and this was the main circumstance\r\nwhich has exercised so prodigious an influence on the character, the\r\nlaws, and all the future prospects of the south.\r\n\r\nSlavery, as we shall afterward show, dishonors labor; it introduces\r\nidleness into society, and, with idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury\r\nand distress. It enervates the powers of the mind, and benumbs the\r\nactivity of man. The influence of slavery, united to the English\r\ncharacter, explains the mariners and the social condition of the\r\nsouthern states.\r\n\r\nIn the north, the same English foundation was modified by the most\r\nopposite shades of character; and here I may be allowed to enter into\r\nsome details. The two or three main ideas which constitute the basis\r\nof the social theory of the United States, were first combined in the\r\nnorthern British colonies, more generally denominated the states of\r\nNew England.[18] The principles of New England spread at first to the\r\nneighboring states; they then passed successively to the more distant\r\nones; and at length they embued the whole confederation. They now extend\r\ntheir influence beyond its limits over the whole American world. The\r\ncivilisation of New England has been like a beacon lit upon a hill,\r\nwhich, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant\r\nhorizon with its glow.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of New England was a novel spectacle, and all the\r\ncircumstances attending it were singular and original. The large\r\nmajority of colonies have been first inhabited either by men without\r\neducation and without resources, driven by their poverty and their\r\nmisconduct from the land which gave them birth, or by speculators\r\nand adventurers greedy of gain. Some settlements cannot even boast so\r\nhonorable an origin: St. Domingo was founded by buccaneers; and, at the\r\npresent day, the criminal courts of England supply the population of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England all\r\nbelonged to the more independent classes of their native country. Their\r\nunion on the soil of America at once presented the singular phenomenon\r\nof a society containing neither lords nor common people, neither rich\r\nnor poor. These men possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater\r\nmass of intelligence than is to be found in any European nation of\r\nour own time. All, without a single exception, had received a good\r\neducation, and many of them were known in Europe for their talents and\r\ntheir acquirements. The other colonies had been founded by adventurers\r\nwithout family; the emigrants of New England brought with them the best\r\nelements of order and morality, they landed in the desert accompanied\r\nby their wives and children. But what most especially distinguished them\r\nwas the aim of their undertaking. They had not been obliged by necessity\r\nto leave their country, the social position they abandoned was one to\r\nbe regretted, and their means of subsistence were certain. Nor did they\r\ncross the Atlantic to improve their situation, or to increase their\r\nwealth; the call which summoned them from the comforts of their homes\r\nwas purely intellectual; and in facing the inevitable sufferings of\r\nexile, their object was the triumph of an idea.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the pilgrims,\r\nbelonged to that English sect, the austerity of whose principles had\r\nacquired for them the name of puritans. Puritanism was not merely a\r\nreligious doctrine, but it corresponded in many points with the most\r\nabsolute democratic and republican theories. It was this tendency which\r\nhad aroused its most dangerous adversaries. Persecuted by the government\r\nof the mother-country, and disgusted by the habits of a society opposed\r\nto the rigor of their own principles, the puritans went forth to seek\r\nsome rude and unfrequented part of the world, where they could live\r\naccording to their own opinions, and worship God in freedom.\r\n\r\nA few quotations will throw more light upon the spirit of these pious\r\nadventurers than all we can say of them. Nathaniel Morton,[19]\r\nthe historian of the first years of the settlement, thus opens his\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n\"GENTLE READER: I have for some length of time looked upon it as a duty\r\nincumbent, especially on the immediate successors of those that have had\r\nso large experience of those many memorable and signal demonstrations\r\nof God's goodness, viz., the first beginning of this plantation in New\r\nEngland, to commit to writing his gracious dispensations on that\r\nbehalf; having so many inducements thereunto, not only otherwise, but\r\nso plentifully in the Sacred Scriptures: that so, what we have seen, and\r\nwhat our fathers have told us (Psalm lxxviii., 3, 4), we may not hide\r\nfrom our children, showing to the generations to come the praises of the\r\nLord; that especially the seed of Abraham his servant, and the children\r\nof Jacob his chosen (Psalm cv., 5, 6), may remember his marvellous\r\nworks in the beginning and progress of the planting of New England, his\r\nwonders and the judgments of his mouth; how that God brought a vine into\r\nthis wilderness; that he cast out the heathen and planted it; that he\r\nmade room for it, and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the\r\nland (Psalm lxxx., 8, 9). And not onely so, but also that he hath guided\r\nhis people by his strength to his holy habitation, and planted them\r\nin the mountain of his inheritance in respect of precious gospel\r\nenjoyments: and that as especially God may have the glory of all unto\r\nwhom it is most due; so also some rays of glory may reach the names of\r\nthose blessed saints, that were the main instruments and the beginning\r\nof this happy enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read this opening paragraph without an involuntary\r\nfeeling of religious awe; it breathes the very savor of gospel\r\nantiquity. The sincerity of the author heightens his power of language.\r\nThe band, which to his eyes was a mere party of adventurers, gone forth\r\nto seek their fortune beyond the seas, appears to the reader as the\r\ngerme of a great nation wafted by Providence to a predestined shore.\r\n\r\nThe author thus continues his narrative of the departure of the first\r\npilgrims:--\r\n\r\n\"So they left that goodly and pleasant city of Leyden, which had been\r\ntheir resting-place for above eleven years; but they knew that they were\r\npilgrims and strangers here below, and looked not much on these things,\r\nbut lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their dearest country, where God\r\nhath prepared for them a city (Heb. xi., 16), and therein quieted their\r\nspirits. When they came to Delfs-Haven they found the ship and all\r\nthings ready; and such of their friends as could come with them,\r\nfollowed after them, and sundry came from Amsterdam to see them shipt,\r\nand to take their leaves of them. One night was spent with little sleep\r\nwith the most, but with friendly entertainment and Christian discourse,\r\nand other real expressions of true Christian love. The next day they\r\nwent on board, and their friends with them, where truly doleful was the\r\nsight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear what sighs and sobs and\r\nprayers did sound among them; what tears did gush from every eye, and\r\npithy speeches pierced each other's heart, that sundry of the Dutch\r\nstrangers that stood on the key as spectators could not refrain from\r\ntears. But the tide (which stays for no man) calling them away that were\r\nthus loath to depart, their reverend pastor falling down on his knees,\r\nand they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them with most\r\nfervent prayers unto the Lord and his blessing; and then, with mutual\r\nembraces and many tears, they took their leaves one of another, which\r\nproved to be the last leave to many of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe emigrants were about 150 in number, including the women and the\r\nchildren. Their object was to plant a colony on the shores of the\r\nHudson; but after having been driven about for some time in the Atlantic\r\nocean, they were forced to land on that arid coast of New England which\r\nis now the site of the town of Plymouth. The rock is still shown on\r\nwhich the pilgrims disembarked.[20]\r\n\r\n\"But before we pass on,\" continues our historian, \"let the reader with\r\nme make a pause, and seriously consider this poor people's present\r\ncondition, the more to be raised up to admiration of God's goodness\r\ntoward them in their preservation: for being now passed the vast ocean,\r\nand a sea of troubles before them in expectation, they had now no\r\nfriends to welcome them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no\r\nhouses, or much less towns to repair unto to seek for succor; and for\r\nthe season it was winter, and they that know the winters of the country\r\nknow them to be sharp and violent, subject to cruel and fierce storms,\r\ndangerous to travel to known places, much more to search unknown coasts.\r\nBesides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full\r\nof wilde beasts, and wilde men? and what multitudes of them there were,\r\nthey then knew not: for which way soever they turned their eyes (save\r\nupward to Heaven) they could have but little solace or content in\r\nrespect of any outward object; for summer being ended, all things stand\r\nin appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole country full\r\nof woods and thickets represented a wild and savage hue; if they looked\r\nbehind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had passed, and was\r\nnow as a main bar or gulph to separate them from all the civil parts of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that the piety of the puritans was of a merely\r\nspeculative kind, or that it took no cognizance of the course of worldly\r\naffairs. Puritanism, as I have already remarked, was scarcely less a\r\npolitical than a religious doctrine. No sooner had the emigrants landed\r\non the barren coast, described by Nathaniel Morton, than their first\r\ncare was to constitute a society, by passing the following act:[21]--\r\n\r\n\"IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN! We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal\r\nsubjects of our dread sovereign lord King James, &c., &c., having\r\nundertaken for the glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith,\r\nand the honor of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first\r\ncolony in the northern parts of Virginia: do by these presents solemnly\r\nand mutually, in the presence of God and one another, covenant and\r\ncombine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better\r\nordering and preservation, and furtherance of the ends aforesaid: and by\r\nvirtue hereof do enact, constitute, and frame, such just and equal laws,\r\nordinances, acts, constitutions, and officers, from time to time, as\r\nshall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the\r\ncolony: unto which we promise all due submission and obedience,\" &c.[22]\r\n\r\nThis happened in 1620, and from that time forward the emigration went\r\non. The religious and political passions which ravished the British\r\nempire during the whole reign of Charles I., drove fresh crowds\r\nof sectarians every year to the shores of America. In England the\r\nstronghold of puritanism was in the middle classes, and it was from the\r\nmiddle classes that the majority of the emigrants came. The population\r\nof New England increased rapidly; and while the hierarchy of rank\r\ndespotically classed the inhabitants of the mother-country, the colony\r\ncontinued to present the novel spectacle of a community homogeneous in\r\nall its parts. A democracy, more perfect than any which antiquity\r\nhad dreamed of, started in full size and panoply from the midst of an\r\nancient feudal society.\r\n\r\nThe English government was not dissatisfied with an emigration which\r\nremoved the elements of fresh discord and of future revolutions. On the\r\ncontrary, everything was done to encourage it, and little attention\r\nwas paid to the destiny of those who sought a shelter from the rigor of\r\ntheir country's laws on the soil of America. It seemed as if New England\r\nwas a region given up to the dreams of fancy, and the unrestrained\r\nexperiments of innovators.\r\n\r\nThe English colonies (and this is one of the main causes of their\r\nprosperity) have always enjoyed more internal freedom and more political\r\nindependence than the colonies of other nations; but this principle of\r\nliberty was nowhere more extensively applied than in the states of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt was generally allowed at that period that the territories of the\r\nNew World belonged to that European nation which had been the first to\r\ndiscover them. Nearly the whole coast of North America thus became a\r\nBritish possession toward the end of the sixteenth century. The means\r\nused by the English government to people these new domains were of\r\nseveral kinds: the king sometimes appointed a governor of his own\r\nchoice, who ruled a portion of the New World in the name and under the\r\nimmediate orders of the crown;[23] this is the colonial system adopted\r\nby the other countries of Europe. Sometimes grants of certain tracts\r\nwere made by the crown to an individual or to a company,[24] in which\r\ncase all the civil and political power fell into the hands of one or\r\nmore persons, who, under the inspection and control of the crown, sold\r\nthe lands and governed the inhabitants. Lastly, a third system consisted\r\nin allowing a certain number of emigrants to constitute a political\r\nsociety under the protection of the mother-country, and to govern\r\nthemselves in whatever was not contrary to her laws. This mode of\r\ncolonization, so remarkably favorable to liberty, was adopted only in\r\nNew England.[25]\r\n\r\nIn 1628,[26] a charter of this kind was granted by Charles I. to the\r\nemigrants who went to form the colony of Massachusetts. But, in general,\r\ncharters were not given to the colonies of New England till they had\r\nacquired a certain existence. Plymouth, Providence, New Haven, the state\r\nof Connecticut, and that of Rhode Island,[27] were founded without the\r\nco-operation, and almost without the knowledge of the mother-country.\r\nThe new settlers did not derive their incorporation from the head of\r\nthe empire, although they did not deny its supremacy; they constituted\r\na society of their own accord, and it was not till thirty or forty\r\nyears afterward, under Charles II., that their existence was legally\r\nrecognised by a royal charter.\r\n\r\nThis frequently renders it difficult to detect the link which connected\r\nthe emigrants with the land of their forefathers, in studying the\r\nearliest historical and legislative records of New England. They\r\nperpetually exercised the rights of sovereignty; they named their\r\nmagistrates, concluded peace or declared war, made police regulations,\r\nand enacted laws, as if their allegiance was due only to God.[28]\r\nNothing can be more curious, and at the same time more instructive than\r\nthe legislation of that period; it is there that the solution of the\r\ngreat social problem which the United States now present to the world is\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nAmong these documents we shall notice as especially characteristic, the\r\ncode of laws promulgated by the little state of Connecticut in 1650.[29]\r\n\r\nThe legislators of Connecticut[30] begin with the penal laws, and,\r\nstrange to say, they borrow their provisions from the text of holy writ.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever shall worship any other God than the Lord,\" says the preamble\r\nof the code, \"shall surely be put to death.\" This is followed by ten or\r\ntwelve enactments of the same kind, copied verbatim from the books of\r\nExodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Blasphemy, sorcery, adultery,[31]\r\nand rape were punished with death; an outrage offered by a son to his\r\nparents, was to be expiated by the same penalty. The legislation of a\r\nrude and half-civilized people was thus transferred to an enlightened\r\nand moral community. The consequence was, that the punishment of death\r\nwas never more frequently prescribed by the statute, and never more\r\nrarely enforced toward the guilty.\r\n\r\nThe chief care of the legislators, in this body of penal laws, was the\r\nmaintenance of orderly conduct and good morals in the community: they\r\nconstantly invaded the domain of conscience, and there was scarcely a\r\nsin which they did not subject to magisterial censure. The reader is\r\naware of the rigor with which these laws punished rape and adultery;\r\nintercourse between unmarried persons was likewise severely repressed.\r\nThe judge was empowered to inflict a pecuniary penalty, a whipping, or\r\nmarriage,[32] on the misdemeanants; and if the records of the old\r\ncourts of New Haven may be believed, prosecutions of this kind were\r\nnot infrequent. We find a sentence bearing date the first of May, 1660,\r\ninflicting a fine and a reprimand on a young woman who was accused of\r\nusing improper language, and of allowing herself to be kissed.[33] The\r\ncode of 1650 abounds in preventive measures. It punishes idleness and\r\ndrunkenness with severity.[34] Innkeepers are forbidden to furnish more\r\nthan a certain quantity of liquor to each customer; and simple lying,\r\nwhenever it may be injurious,[35] is checked by a fine or a flogging. In\r\nother places, the legislator, entirely forgetting the great principles\r\nof religious toleration which he had himself upheld in Europe, renders\r\nattendance on divine service compulsory,[36] and goes so far as to visit\r\nwith severe punishment,[37] and even with death, the Christians who\r\nchose to worship God according to a ritual differing from his own.[38]\r\nSometimes indeed, the zeal of his enactments induces him to descend to\r\nthe most frivolous particulars: thus a law is to be found in the same\r\ncode which prohibits the use of tobacco.[39] It must not be forgotten\r\nthat these fantastical and vexatious laws were not imposed by authority,\r\nbut that they were freely voted by all the persons interested, and that\r\nthe manners of the community were even more austere and more puritanical\r\nthan the laws. In 1649 a solemn association was formed in Boston to\r\ncheck the worldly luxury of long hair.[40]\r\n\r\nThese errors are no doubt discreditable to the human reason; they attest\r\nthe inferiority of our nature, which is incapable of laying firm hold\r\nupon what is true and just, and is often reduced to the alternative of\r\ntwo excesses. In strict connection with this penal legislation, which\r\nbears such striking marks of a narrow sectarian spirit, and of those\r\nreligious passions which had been warmed by persecution, and were still\r\nfermenting among the people, a body of political laws is to be found,\r\nwhich, though written two hundred years ago, is still ahead of the\r\nliberties of our age.\r\n\r\nThe general principles which are the groundwork of modern\r\nconstitutions--principles which were imperfectly known in Europe, and\r\nnot completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury--were all recognised and determined by the laws of New England:\r\nthe intervention of the people in public affairs, the free voting of\r\ntaxes, the responsibility of authorities, personal liberty, and trial by\r\njury, were all positively established without discussion.\r\n\r\nFrom these fruitful principles, consequences have been derived and\r\napplications have been made such as no nation in Europe has yet ventured\r\nto attempt.\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut the electoral body consisted, from its origin, of the\r\nwhole number of citizens; and this is readily to be understood,[41]\r\nwhen we recollect that this people enjoyed an almost perfect equality of\r\nfortune, and a still greater uniformity of capacity.[42] In Connecticut,\r\nat this period, all the executive functionaries were elected, including\r\nthe governor of the state.[43] The citizens above the age of sixteen\r\nwere obliged to bear arms; they formed a national militia, which\r\nappointed its own officers, and was to hold itself at all times in\r\nreadiness to march for the defence of the country.[44]\r\n\r\nIn the laws of Connecticut, as well as in those of New England, we find\r\nthe germe and gradual development of that township independence, which\r\nis the life and mainspring of American liberty at the present day. The\r\npolitical existence of the majority of the nations of Europe commenced\r\nin the superior ranks of society, and was gradually and always\r\nimperfectly communicated to the different members of the social body.\r\nIn America, on the other hand, it may be said that the township was\r\norganized before the county, the county before the state, the state\r\nbefore the Union.\r\n\r\nIn New England, townships were completely and definitively constituted\r\nas early as 1650. The independence of the township was the nucleus\r\naround which the local interests, passions, rights, and duties,\r\ncollected and clung. It gave scope to the activity of a real political\r\nlife, most thoroughly democratic and republican. The colonies still\r\nrecognised the supremacy of the mother-country; monarchy was still the\r\nlaw of the state; but the republic was already established in every\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\nThe towns named their own magistrates of every kind, rated themselves,\r\nand levied their own taxes.[45] In the townships of New England the law\r\nof representation was not adopted, but the affairs of the community were\r\ndiscussed, as at Athens, in the market-place, by a general assembly of\r\nthe citizens.\r\n\r\nIn studying the laws which were promulgated at this first era of the\r\nAmerican republics, it is impossible not to be struck by the remarkable\r\nacquaintance with the science of government, and the advanced theory of\r\nlegislation, which they display. The ideas there formed of the duties\r\nof society toward its members, are evidently much loftier and more\r\ncomprehensive than those of the European legislators at that time:\r\nobligations were there imposed which were elsewhere slighted. In the\r\nstates of New England, from the first, the condition of the poor was\r\nprovided for;[46] strict measures were taken for the maintenance of\r\nroads, and surveyors were appointed to attend to them;[47] registers\r\nwere established in every parish, in which the results of public\r\ndeliberations, and the births, deaths, and marriages of the citizens\r\nwere entered;[48] clerks were directed to keep these registers;[49]\r\nofficers were charged with the administration of vacant inheritances,\r\nand with the arbitration of litigated landmarks; and many others were\r\ncreated whose chief functions were the maintenance of public order in\r\nthe community.[50] The law enters into a thousand useful provisions for\r\na number of social wants which are at present very inadequately felt in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBut it is by the attention it pays to public education that the original\r\ncharacter of American civilisation is at once placed in the clearest\r\nlight. \"It being,\" says the law, \"one chief project of Satan to keep\r\nmen from the knowledge of the Scripture by persuading from the use of\r\ntongues, to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of\r\nour forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our\r\nendeavors.\"[51] Here follow clauses establishing schools in every\r\ntownship, and obliging the inhabitants, under pain of heavy fines, to\r\nsupport them. Schools of a superior kind were founded in the same manner\r\nin the more populous districts. The municipal authorities were bound to\r\nenforce the sending of children to school by their parents; they were\r\nempowered to inflict fines upon all who refused compliance; and in cases\r\nof continued resistance, society assumed the place of the parent, took\r\npossession of the child, and deprived the father of those natural rights\r\nwhich he used to so bad a purpose. The reader will undoubtedly have\r\nremarked the preamble of these enactments: in America, religion is the\r\nroad to knowledge, and the observance of the divine laws leads men to\r\ncivil freedom.\r\n\r\nIf, after having cast a rapid glance over the state of American society\r\nin 1650, we turn to the condition of Europe, and more especially to that\r\nof the continent, at the same period, we cannot fail to be struck\r\nwith astonishment. On the continent of Europe, at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, absolute monarchy had everywhere triumphed over the\r\nruins of the oligarchical and feudal liberties of the middle ages. Never\r\nwere the notions of right more completely confounded than in the midst\r\nof the splendor and literature of Europe; never was there less political\r\nactivity among the people; never were the principles of true freedom\r\nless widely circulated, and at that very time, those principles, which\r\nwere scorned or unknown by the nations of Europe, were proclaimed in\r\nthe deserts of the New World, and were accepted as the future creed of\r\na great people. The boldest theories of the human reason were put into\r\npractice by a community so humble, that not a statesman condescended to\r\nattend to it; and a legislation without precedent was produced off-hand\r\nby the imagination of the citizens. In the bosom of this obscure\r\ndemocracy, which had as yet brought forth neither generals, nor\r\nphilosophers, nor authors, a man might stand up in the face of a free\r\npeople, and pronounce amid general acclamations the following fine\r\ndefinition of liberty:[52]--\r\n\r\n\"Nor would I have you to mistake in the point of your own liberty. There\r\nis a liberty of corrupt nature, which is affected both by men and beasts\r\nto do what they list; and this liberty is inconsistent with authority,\r\nimpatient of all restraint; by this liberty '_sumus omnes deteriores_;'\r\nit is the grand enemy of truth and peace, and all the ordinances of God\r\nare bent against it. But there is a civil, a moral, a federal liberty,\r\nwhich is the proper end and object of authority; it is a liberty for\r\nthat only which is just and good: for this liberty you are to stand\r\nwith the hazard of your very lives, and whatsoever crosses it is not\r\nauthority, but a distemper thereof. This liberty is maintained in a way\r\nof subjection to authority; and the authority set over you will, in all\r\nadministrations for your good, be quietly submitted unto by all but such\r\nas have a disposition to shake off the yoke and lose their true liberty,\r\nby their murmuring at the honor and power of authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of\r\nAnglo-American civilisation in its true light. It is the result (and\r\nthis should be constantly present to the mind) of two distinct elements,\r\nwhich in other places have been in frequent hostility, but which in\r\nAmerica have admirably incorporated and combined with one another. I\r\nallude to the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians\r\nand daring innovators. Narrow as the limits of some of their religious\r\nopinions were, they were entirely free from political prejudices.\r\n\r\nHence arose two tendencies, distinct but not opposite, which are\r\nconstantly discernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their\r\nfamily, and their native land, to a religious conviction, were absorbed\r\nin the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at\r\nso dear a rate. The energy, however, with which they strove for the\r\nacquirements of wealth, moral enjoyment, and the comforts as well as the\r\nliberties of the world, was scarcely inferior to that with which they\r\ndevoted themselves to Heaven.\r\n\r\nPolitical principles, and all human laws and institutions were moulded\r\nand altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the society in which they\r\nwere born were broken down before them; the old principles which had\r\ngoverned the world for ages were no more; a path without a turn, and\r\na field without a horizon, were opened to the exploring and ardent\r\ncuriosity of man; but at the limits of the political world he checks\r\nhis researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable\r\nfaculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate, but carefully\r\nabstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with\r\nsubmissive respect to truths which he will not discuss.\r\n\r\nThus in the moral world, everything is classed, adapted, decided, and\r\nforeseen; in the political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and\r\ndisputed: in the one is a passive, though a voluntary obedience; in the\r\nother an independence, scornful of experience and jealous of authority.\r\n\r\nThese two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from\r\nconflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each other.\r\n\r\nReligion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the\r\nfaculties of man, and that the political world is a field prepared by\r\nthe Creator for the efforts of the intelligence. Contented with the\r\nfreedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the\r\nplace which it occupies, the empire of religion is never more surely\r\nestablished than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by\r\naught besides its native strength.\r\n\r\nReligion is no less the companion of liberty in all its battles and\r\nits triumphs; the cradle of its infancy, and the divine source of its\r\nclaims. The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best\r\nsecurity of law as well as the surest pledge of freedom.[53]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREASONS OF CERTAIN ANOMALIES WHICH THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THE\r\nANGLO-AMERICANS PRESENT.\r\n\r\nRemains of aristocratic Institutions in the midst of a complete\r\nDemocracy.--Why?--Distinction carefully to be drawn between what is of\r\nPuritanical and what is of English Origin.\r\n\r\nThe reader is cautioned not to draw too general or too absolute an\r\ninference from what has been said. The social condition, the religion,\r\nand the manners of the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense\r\ninfluence on the destiny of their new country. Nevertheless it was\r\nnot in their power to found a state of things originating solely in\r\nthemselves; no man can entirely shake off the influence of the past, and\r\nthe settlers, unintentionally or involuntarily, mingled habits derived\r\nfrom their education and from the traditions of their country, with\r\nthose habits and notions which were exclusively their own. To form a\r\njudgment on the Anglo-Americans of the present day, it is therefore\r\nnecessary carefully to distinguish what is of puritanical from what is\r\nof English origin.\r\n\r\nLaws and customs are frequently to be met with in the United States\r\nwhich contrast strongly with all that surrounds them. These laws seem to\r\nbe drawn up in a spirit contrary to the prevailing tenor of the American\r\nlegislation; and these customs are no less opposed to the general\r\ntone of society. If the English colonies had been founded in an age of\r\ndarkness, or if their origin was already lost in the lapse of years, the\r\nproblem would be insoluble.\r\n\r\nI shall quote a single example to illustrate what I advance.\r\n\r\nThe civil and criminal procedure of the Americans has only two means of\r\naction--committal or bail. The first measure taken by the magistrate\r\nis to exact security from the defendant, or, in case of refusal, to\r\nincarcerate him: the ground of the accusation, and the importance of the\r\ncharges against him are then discussed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a legislation of this kind is hostile to the poor\r\nman, and favorable only to the rich. The poor man has not always a\r\nsecurity to produce, even in a civil cause: and if he is obliged to wait\r\nfor justice in prison, he is speedily reduced to distress. The wealthy\r\nindividual, on the contrary, always escapes imprisonment in civil\r\ncauses; nay, more, he may readily elude the punishment which awaits him\r\nfor a delinquency, by breaking his bail. So that all the penalties\r\nof the law are, for him, reducible to fines.[54] Nothing can be more\r\naristocratic than this system of legislation. Yet in America it is the\r\npoor who make the law, and they usually reserve the greatest social\r\nadvantages to themselves. The explanation of the phenomenon is to be\r\nfound in England; the laws of which I speak are English,[55] and the\r\nAmericans have retained them, however repugnant they may be to the tenor\r\nof their legislation, and the mass of their ideas.\r\n\r\nNext to its habits, the thing which a nation is least apt to change is\r\nits civil legislation. Civil laws are only familiarly known to legal\r\nmen, whose direct interest it is to maintain them as they are, whether\r\ngood or bad, simply because they themselves are conversant with them.\r\nThe body of the nation is scarcely acquainted with them: it merely\r\nperceives their action in particular cases; but it has some difficulty\r\nin seizing their tendency, and obeys them without reflection.\r\n\r\nI have quoted one instance where it would have been easy to adduce a\r\ngreat number of others.\r\n\r\nThe surface of American society is, if I may use the expression, covered\r\nwith a layer of democracy, from beneath which the old aristocratic\r\ncolors sometimes peep.[56]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[14] The charter granted by the crown of England, in 1609, stipulated,\r\namong other conditions, that the adventurers should pay to the crown a\r\nfifth of the produce of all gold and silver mines. See Marshall's \"Life\r\nof Washington,\" vol i., pp. 18-66.\r\n\r\n[15] A large portion of the adventurers, says Stith (History of\r\nVirginia), were unprincipled young men of family, whom their parents\r\nwere glad to ship off, discharged servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or\r\ndebauchees: and others of the same class, people more apt to pillage\r\nand destroy than to assist the settlement, were the seditious chiefs who\r\neasily led this band into every kind of extravagance and excess. See for\r\nthe history of Virginia the following works:--\r\n\r\n\"History of Virginia, from the first Settlements in the year 1624,\" by\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n\"History of Virginia,\" by William Stith.\r\n\r\n\"History of Virginia, from the earliest Period,\" by Beverley.\r\n\r\n[16] It was not till some time later that a certain number of rich\r\nEnglish capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.\r\n\r\n[17] Slavery was introduced about the year 1620, by a Dutch vessel,\r\nwhich landed twenty negroes on the banks of the river James.

See \"Pitkin's History,\" pp 42, 47.\r\n\r\n[23] This was the case in the state of New York.\r\n\r\n[24] Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, were in this\r\nsituation.

He quotes a curious anecdote on this subject,\r\nwhich occurred in the year 1663. A married woman had had criminal\r\nintercourse with a young man; her husband died, and she married the\r\nlover. Several years had elapsed, when the public began to suspect the\r\nprevious intercourse of this couple; they were thrown into prison, put\r\nupon trial, and very narrowly escaped capital punishment.\r\n\r\n[32] Code of 1650, p. 48. It seems sometimes to have happened that\r\nthe judge superadded these punishments to each other, as is seen in a\r\nsentence pronounced in 1643 (New Haven Antiquities, p. 114), by which\r\nMargaret Bedford, convicted of loose conduct, was condemned to be\r\nwhipped, and afterward to marry Nicolas Jemmings her accomplice.\r\n\r\n[33] New Haven Antiquities, p. 104.

A person\r\naccused of crime is, in the first instance, arrested by virtue of a\r\nwarrant issued by the magistrate, upon a complaint granted upon proof of\r\na crime having been committed by the person charged. He is then brought\r\nbefore the magistrate, the complainant examined in his presence, other\r\nevidence adduced, and he is heard in explanation or defence. If the\r\nmagistrate is satisfied that a crime has been committed, and that the\r\naccused is guilty, the latter is, then, and then only, required to give\r\nsecurity for his appearance at the proper court to take his trial, if an\r\nindictment shall be found against him by a Grand Jury of twenty-three\r\nof his fellow-citizens. In the event of his inability or refusal to give\r\nthe security he is incarcerated, so as to secure his appearance at a\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nIn France, after the preliminary examination, the accused, unless\r\nabsolutely discharged, is in all cases incarcerated, to secure his\r\npresence at the trial. It is the relaxation of this practice in England\r\nand the United States, in order to attain the ends of justice at the\r\nleast possible inconvenience to the accused, by accepting what is\r\ndeemed an adequate pledge for his appearance, which our author considers\r\nhostile to the poor man and favorable to the rich. And yet it is very\r\nobvious, that such is not its design or tendency. Good character, and\r\nprobable innocence, ordinarily obtain for the accused man the required\r\nsecurity. And if they do not, how can complaint be justly made that\r\nothers are not treated with unnecessary severity, and punished in\r\nanticipation, because some are prevented by circumstances from availing\r\nthemselves of a benign provision so favorable to humanity, and to that\r\ninnocence which our law presumes, until guilt is proved? To secure the\r\npersons of suspected criminals, that they may abide the sentence of the\r\nlaw, is indispensable to all jurisprudence. And instead of reproof\r\nor aristocratic tendency, our system deserves credit for having\r\nameliorated, as far as possible, the condition of persons accused.\r\nThat this amelioration cannot be made in all instances, flows from the\r\nnecessity of the case.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose, as the author seems to have done,\r\nthat the forfeiture of the security given, exonerates the accused from\r\npunishment. He may be again arrested and detained in prison, as security\r\nwould not ordinarily be received from a person who had given such\r\nevidence of his guilt as would be derived from his attempt to escape.\r\nAnd the difficulty of escape is rendered so great by our constitutional\r\nprovisions for the delivery, by the different states, of fugitives\r\nfrom justice, and by our treaties with England and France for the same\r\npurpose, that the instances of successful evasion are few and rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONDITION OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Social condition is commonly the result of circumstances, sometimes of\r\nlaws, oftener still of these two causes united; but wherever it exists,\r\nit may justly be considered as the source of almost all the laws, the\r\nusages, and the ideas, which regulate the conduct of nations: whatever\r\nit does not produce, it modifies.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary, if we would become acquainted with the\r\nlegislation and the manners of a nation, to begin by the study of its\r\nsocial condition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE STRIKING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE\r\nANGLO-AMERICANS IS ITS ESSENTIAL DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nThe first Emigrants of New England.--Their Equality.--Aristocratic Laws\r\nintroduced in the South.--Period of the Revolution.--Change in the Law\r\nof Descent.--Effects produced by this Change.--Democracy carried to its\r\nutmost Limits in the new States of the West.--Equality of Education.\r\n\r\nMany important observations suggest themselves upon the social condition\r\nof the Anglo-Americans; but there is one which takes precedence of all\r\nthe rest. The social condition of the Americans is eminently democratic;\r\nthis was its character at the foundation of the colonies, and is still\r\nmore strongly marked at the present day.\r\n\r\nI have stated in the preceding chapter that great equality existed among\r\nthe emigrants who settled on the shores of New England. The germe\r\nof aristocracy was never planted in that part of the Union. The only\r\ninfluence which obtained there was that of intellect; the people were\r\nused to reverence certain names as the emblems of knowledge and virtue.\r\nSome of their fellow-citizens acquired a power over the rest which\r\nmight truly have been called aristocratic, if it had been capable of\r\ninvariable transmission from father to son.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things to the east of the Hudson: to the southwest\r\nof that river, and in the direction of the Floridas, the case was\r\ndifferent. In most of the states situated to the southwest of the Hudson\r\nsome great English proprietors had settled, who had imported with them\r\naristocratic principles and the English law of descent. I have\r\nexplained the reasons why it was impossible ever to establish a powerful\r\naristocracy in America; these reasons existed with less force to the\r\nsouthwest of the Hudson. In the south, one man, aided by slaves, could\r\ncultivate a great extent of country: it was therefore common to see rich\r\nlanded proprietors. But their influence was not altogether aristocratic\r\nas that term is understood in Europe, since they possessed no\r\nprivileges; and the cultivation of their estates being carried on by\r\nslaves, they had no tenants depending on them, and consequently no\r\npatronage. Still, the great proprietors south of the Hudson constituted\r\na superior class, having ideas and tastes of its own, and forming the\r\ncentre of political action. This kind of aristocracy sympathized with\r\nthe body of the people, whose passions and interests it easily embraced;\r\nbut it was too weak and too short-lived to excite either love or hatred\r\nfor itself. This was the class which headed the insurrection in the\r\nsouth, and furnished the best leaders of the American revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which we are now speaking, society was shaken to\r\nits centre: the people, in whose name the struggle had taken place,\r\nconceived the desire of exercising the authority which it had acquired;\r\nits democratic tendencies were awakened; and having thrown off the yoke\r\nof the mother-country, it aspired to independence of every kind. The\r\ninfluence of individuals gradually ceased to be felt, and custom and law\r\nunited together to produce the same result.\r\n\r\nBut the law of descent was the last step to equality. I am surprised\r\nthat ancient and modern jurists have not attributed to this law a\r\ngreater influence on human affairs.[57] It is true that these laws\r\nbelong to civil affairs: but they ought nevertheless to be placed at the\r\nhead of all political institutions; for, while political laws are\r\nonly the symbol of a nation's condition, they exercise an incredible\r\ninfluence upon its social state. They have, moreover, a sure and uniform\r\nmanner of operating upon society, affecting, as it were, generations yet\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThrough their means man acquires a kind of preternatural power over\r\nthe future lot of his fellow-creatures. When the legislator has once\r\nregulated the law of inheritance, he may rest from his labor. The\r\nmachine once put in motion will go on for ages, and advance, as if\r\nself-guided, toward a given point. When framed in a particular manner,\r\nthis law unites, draws together, and vests property and power in a few\r\nhands: its tendency is clearly aristocratic. On opposite principles its\r\naction is still more rapid; it divides, distributes, and disperses both\r\nproperty and power. Alarmed by the rapidity of its progress, those who\r\ndespair of arresting its motion endeavor to obstruct by difficulties\r\nand impediments; they vainly seek to counteract its effect by contrary\r\nefforts: but it gradually reduces or destroys every obstacle, until\r\nby its incessant activity the bulwarks of the influence of wealth\r\nare ground down to the fine and shifting sand which is the basis of\r\ndemocracy. When the law of inheritance permits, still more when it\r\ndecrees, the equal division of a father's property among all his\r\nchildren, its effects are of two kinds: it is important to distinguish\r\nthem from each other, although they tend to the same end.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the law of partible inheritance, the death of every\r\nproprietor brings about a kind of revolution in property: not only do\r\nhis possessions change hands, but their very nature is altered; since\r\nthey are parcelled into shares, which become smaller and smaller at each\r\ndivision. This is the direct, and, as it were, the physical effect\r\nof the law. It follows, then, that in countries where equality of\r\ninheritance is established by law, property, and especially landed\r\nproperty, must have a tendency to perpetual diminution. The effects,\r\nhowever, of such legislation would only be perceptible after a lapse\r\nof time, if the law was abandoned to its own working; for supposing a\r\nfamily to consist of two children (and in a country peopled as France\r\nis, the average number is not above three), these children, sharing\r\namong them the fortune of both parents, would not be poorer than their\r\nfather or mother.\r\n\r\nBut the law of equal division exercises its influence not merely upon\r\nthe property itself, but it affects the minds of the heirs, and brings\r\ntheir passions into play. These indirect consequences tend powerfully to\r\nthe destruction of large fortunes, and especially of large domains.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations whose law of descent is founded upon the right of\r\nprimogeniture, landed estates often pass from generation to generation\r\nwithout undergoing division. The consequence of which is, that family\r\nfeeling is to a certain degree incorporated with the estate. The family\r\nrepresents the estate, the estate the family; whose name, together with\r\nits origin, its glory, its power, and its virtues, is thus perpetuated\r\nin an imperishable memorial of the past, and a sure pledge of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhen the equal partition of property is established by law, the intimate\r\nconnection is destroyed between family feeling and the preservation of\r\nthe paternal estate; the property ceases to represent the family; for,\r\nas it must inevitably be divided after one or two generations, it\r\nhas evidently a constant tendency to diminish, and must in the end be\r\ncompletely dispersed. The sons of the great landed proprietor, if they\r\nare few in number, or if fortune befriend them, may indeed entertain the\r\nhope of being as wealthy as their father, but not that of possessing the\r\nsame property as he did; their riches must necessarily be composed of\r\nelements different from his.\r\n\r\nNow, from the moment when you divest the land-owner of that interest in\r\nthe preservation of his estate which he derives from association, from\r\ntradition, and from family pride, you may be certain that sooner or\r\nlater he will dispose of it; for there is a strong pecuniary interest in\r\nfavor of selling, as floating capital produces higher interest than real\r\nproperty, and is more readily available to gratify the passions of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nGreat landed estates which have once been divided, never come together\r\nagain; for the small proprietor draws from his land a better revenue in\r\nproportion, than the large owner does from his; and of course he sells\r\nit at a higher rate.[58] The calculations of gain, therefore, which\r\ndecided the rich man to sell his domain, will still more powerfully\r\ninfluence him against buying small estates to unite them into a large\r\none.\r\n\r\nWhat is called family pride is often founded upon an illusion of\r\nself-love. A man wishes to perpetuate and immortalize himself, as it\r\nwere, in his great-grandchildren. Where the _esprit de famille_ ceases\r\nto act, individual selfishness comes into play. When the idea of family\r\nbecomes vague, indeterminate, and uncertain, a man thinks of his\r\npresent convenience; he provides for the establishment of the succeeding\r\ngeneration, and no more.\r\n\r\nEither a man gives up the idea of perpetuating his family, or at any\r\nrate he seeks to accomplish it by other means than that of a landed\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThus not only does the law of partible inheritance render it difficult\r\nfor families to preserve their ancestral domains entire, but it deprives\r\nthem of the inclination to attempt it, and compels them in some measure\r\nto co-operate with the law in their own extinction.\r\n\r\nThe law of equal distribution proceeds by two methods: by acting upon\r\nthings, it acts upon persons; by influencing persons, it affects things.\r\nBy these means the law succeeds in striking at the root of landed\r\nproperty, and dispersing rapidly both families and fortunes.[59]\r\n\r\nMost certainly is it not for us, Frenchmen of the nineteenth century,\r\nwho daily behold the political and social changes which the law\r\nof partition is bringing to pass, to question its influence. It is\r\nperpetually conspicuous in our country, overthrowing the walls of our\r\ndwellings and removing the landmarks of our fields. But although it has\r\nproduced great effects in France, much still remains for it to do. Our\r\nrecollections, opinions, and habits, present powerful obstacles to its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIn the United States it has nearly completed its work of destruction,\r\nand there we can best study its results. The English laws concerning the\r\ntransmission of property were abolished in almost all the states at\r\nthe time of the revolution. The law of entail was so modified as not to\r\ninterrupt the free circulation of property.[60] The first having passed\r\naway, estates began to be parcelled out; and the change became more and\r\nmore rapid with the progress of time. At this moment, after a lapse of\r\nlittle more than sixty years, the aspect of society is totally altered;\r\nthe families of the great landed proprietors are almost all commingled\r\nwith the general mass. In the state of New York, which formerly\r\ncontained many of these, there are but two who still keep their heads\r\nabove the stream; and they must shortly disappear. The sons of these\r\nopulent citizens have become merchants, lawyers, or physicians. Most of\r\nthem have lapsed into obscurity. The last trace of hereditary ranks and\r\ndistinctions is destroyed--the law of partition has reduced all to one\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nI do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in the\r\nUnited States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money\r\nhas taken stronger hold on the affections of men, and where a profounder\r\ncontempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of\r\nproperty. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and\r\nexperience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in\r\nthe full enjoyment of it.\r\n\r\nThis picture, which may perhaps be thought overcharged, still gives a\r\nvery imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new states of\r\nthe west and southwest. At the end of the last century a few bold\r\nadventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and\r\nthe mass of the population very soon began to move in that direction:\r\ncommunities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from their wilds:\r\nstates, whose names were not in existence a few years before, claimed\r\ntheir place in the American Union; and in the western settlements we may\r\nbehold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme. In these states,\r\nfounded off hand, and as it were by chance, the inhabitants are but\r\nof yesterday. Scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors\r\nare ignorant of each other's history. In this part of the American\r\ncontinent, therefore, the population has not experienced the influence\r\nof great names and great wealth, nor even that of the natural\r\naristocracy of knowledge and virtue. None are there to wield that\r\nrespectable power which men willingly grant to the remembrance of a life\r\nspent in doing good before their eyes. The new states of the west are\r\nalready inhabited; but society has no existence among them.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the fortunes of men which are equal in America; even\r\ntheir acquirements partake in some degree of the same uniformity. I do\r\nnot believe there is a country in the world where, in proportion to the\r\npopulation, there are so few uninstructed, and at the same time so\r\nfew learned individuals. Primary instruction is within the reach of\r\neverybody; superior instruction is scarcely to be obtained by any. This\r\nis not surprising; it is in fact the necessary consequence of what we\r\nhave advanced above. Almost all the Americans are in easy circumstances,\r\nand can therefore obtain the elements of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn America there are comparatively few who are rich enough to live\r\nwithout a profession. Every profession requires an apprenticeship, which\r\nlimits the time of instruction to the early years of life. At fifteen\r\nthey enter upon their calling, and thus their education ends at the age\r\nwhen ours begins. Whatever is done afterward, is with a view to some\r\nspecial and lucrative object; a science is taken up as a matter of\r\nbusiness, and the only branch of it which is attended to is such as\r\nadmits of an immediate practical application.\r\n\r\n[This paragraph does not fairly render the meaning of the author. The\r\noriginal French is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"En Amérique il y a peu de riches; presque tous les Américains ont\r\ndonc besoin d'exercer une profession. Or, toute profession exige an\r\napprentissage. Les Américains ne peuvent donc donner a la culture\r\ngénérale de l'intelligence que les premières années de la vie: à quinze\r\nans ils entrent dans une carrière: ainsi leur education finit le plus\r\nsouvent à l'époque où la nôtre commence.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the remark; that \"at fifteen they enter upon a career,\r\nand thus their education is very often finished at the epoch when ours\r\ncommences,\" is not clearly perceived. Our professional men enter upon\r\ntheir course of preparation for their respective professions, wholly\r\nbetween eighteen and twenty-one years of age. Apprentices to trades\r\nare bound out, ordinarily, at fourteen, but what general education they\r\nreceive is after that period. Previously, they have acquired the mere\r\nelements of reading, writing, and arithmetic. But it is supposed there\r\nis nothing peculiar to America, in the age at which apprenticeship\r\ncommences. In England, they commence at the same age, and it is believed\r\nthat the same thing occurs throughout Europe. It is feared that the\r\nauthor has not here expressed himself with his usual clearness and\r\nprecision.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nIn America most of the rich men were formerly poor; most of those who\r\nnow enjoy leisure were absorbed in business during their youth; the\r\nconsequence of which is, that when they might have had a taste for study\r\nthey had no time for it, and when the time is at their disposal they\r\nhave no longer the inclination.\r\n\r\nThere is no class, then, in America in which the taste for intellectual\r\npleasures is transmitted with hereditary fortune and leisure, and by\r\nwhich the labors of the intellect are held in honor. Accordingly there\r\nis an equal want of the desire and the power of application to these\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nA middling standard is fixed in America for human knowledge. All\r\napproach as near to it as they can; some as they rise, others as they\r\ndescend. Of course, an immense multitude of persons are to be found\r\nwho entertain the same number of ideas on religion, history, science,\r\npolitical economy, legislation, and government. The gifts of intellect\r\nproceed directly from God, and man cannot prevent their unequal\r\ndistribution. But in consequence of the state of things which we have\r\nhere represented, it happens, that although the capacities of men are\r\nwidely different, as the Creator has doubtless intended they should be,\r\nthey are submitted to the same method of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn America the aristocratic element has always been feeble from its\r\nbirth; and if at the present day it is not actually destroyed, it is at\r\nany rate so completely disabled that we can scarcely assign to it any\r\ndegree of influence in the course of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe democratic principle, on the contrary, has gained so much strength\r\nby time, by events, and by legislation, as to have become not only\r\npredominant but all-powerful. There is no family or corporate authority,\r\nand it is rare to find even the influence of individual character enjoy\r\nany durability.\r\n\r\nAmerica, then, exhibits in her social state a most extraordinary\r\nphenomenon. Men are there seen on a greater equality in point of fortune\r\nand intellect, or in other words, more equal in their strength, than\r\nin any other country of the world, or, in any age of which history has\r\npreserved the remembrance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nThe political consequences of such a social condition as this are easily\r\ndeducible.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to believe that equality will not eventually find its\r\nway into the political world as it does everywhere else. To conceive of\r\nmen remaining for ever unequal upon one single point, yet equal on all\r\nothers, is impossible; they must come in the end to be equal upon all.\r\n\r\nNow I know of only two methods of establishing equality in the political\r\nworld: every citizen must be put in possession of his rights, or rights\r\nmust be granted to no one. For nations which have arrived at the same\r\nstage of social existence as the Anglo-Americans, it is therefore very\r\ndifficult to discover a medium between the sovereignty of all and the\r\nabsolute power of one man: and it would be vain to deny that the social\r\ncondition which I have been describing is equally liable to each of\r\nthese consequences.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, a manly and lawful passion for equality, which\r\nexcites men to wish all to be powerful and honored. This passion tends\r\nto elevate the humble to the rank of the great; but there exists also in\r\nthe human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak\r\nto attempt to lower the powerful to their own level, and reduces men to\r\nprefer equality in slavery to inequality with freedom. Not that those\r\nnations whose social condition is democratic naturally despise liberty;\r\non the contrary, they have an instinctive love of it. But liberty is not\r\nthe chief and constant object of their desires; equality is their idol:\r\nthey make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty, and if they miss\r\ntheir aim, resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can\r\nsatisfy them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve to\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in a state where the citizens are nearly on an\r\nequality, it becomes difficult for them to preserve their independence\r\nagainst the aggression of power. No one among them being strong enough\r\nto engage singly in the struggle with advantage, nothing but a general\r\ncombination can protect their liberty: and such a union is not always to\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nFrom the same social position, then, nations may derive one or the other\r\nof two great political results; these results are extremely different\r\nfrom each other, but they may both proceed from the same cause.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans are the first who, having been exposed to this\r\nformidable alternative, have been happy enough to escape the dominion\r\nof absolute power. They have been allowed by their circumstances, their\r\norigin, their intelligence, and especially by their moral feeling, to\r\nestablish and maintain the sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[57] I understand by the law of descent all those laws whose principal\r\nobject it is to regulate the distribution of property after the death\r\nof its owner. The law of entail is of this number: it certainly prevents\r\nthe owner from disposing of his possessions before his death; but\r\nthis is solely with a view of preserving them entire for the heir. The\r\nprincipal object, therefore, of the law of entail is to regulate the\r\ndescent of property after the death of its owner: its other provisions\r\nare merely means to this end.\r\n\r\n[58] I do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates his land\r\nbetter, but he cultivates it with more ardor and care; so that he makes\r\nup by his labor for his want of skill.\r\n\r\n[59] Land being the most stable kind of property, we find, from time\r\nto time, rich individuals who are disposed to make great sacrifices in\r\norder to obtain it, and who willingly forfeit a considerable part of\r\ntheir income to make sure of the rest. But these are accidental cases.\r\nThe preference for landed property is no longer found habitually in\r\nany class but among the poor. The small land-owner, who has less\r\ninformation, less imagination, and fewer passions, than the great one,\r\nis generally occupied with the desire of increasing his estate; and it\r\noften happens that by inheritance, by marriage, or by the chances of\r\ntrade, he is gradually furnished with the means. Thus, to balance the\r\ntendency which leads men to divide their estates, there exists another,\r\nwhich incites them to add to them. This tendency, which is sufficient to\r\nprevent estates from being divided _ad infinitum_, is not strong enough\r\nto create great territorial possessions, certainly not to keep them up\r\nin the same family.\r\n\r\n[60] See Appendix G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIt predominates over the whole of Society in America.--Application\r\nmade of this Principle by the Americans even before their\r\nRevolution.--Development given to it by that Revolution.--Gradual and\r\nirresistible Extension of the elective Qualification.\r\n\r\nWhenever the political laws of the United States are to be discussed,\r\nit is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people that we must\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the sovereignty of the people, which is to be found,\r\nmore or less, at the bottom of almost all human institutions, generally\r\nremains concealed from view. It is obeyed without being recognised, or\r\nif for a moment it be brought to light, it is hastily cast back into the\r\ngloom of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n\"The will of the nation\" is one of those expressions which have been\r\nmost profusely abused by the wily and the despotic of every age. To the\r\neyes of some it has been represented by the venal suffrages of a few of\r\nthe satellites of power; to others, by the votes of a timid minority;\r\nand some have even discovered it in the silence of a people, on the\r\nsupposition that the fact of submission established the right of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nIn America, the principle of the sovereignty of the people is not either\r\nbarren or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognised\r\nby the customs and proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely, and\r\narrives without impediment at its most remote consequences. If there\r\nbe a country in the world where the doctrine of the sovereignty of\r\nthe people can be fairly appreciated, where it can be studied in its\r\napplication to the affairs of society, and where its dangers and its\r\nadvantages may be foreseen, that country is assuredly America.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that, from their origin, the sovereignty of\r\nthe people was the fundamental principle of the greater number of the\r\nBritish colonies in America. It was far, however, from then exercising\r\nas much influence on the government of society as it now does. Two\r\nobstacles, the one external, the other internal, checked its invasive\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt could not ostensibly disclose itself in the laws of the colonies,\r\nwhich were still constrained to obey the mother country; it was\r\ntherefore obliged to spread secretly, and to gain ground in the\r\nprovincial assemblies, and especially in the townships.\r\n\r\nAmerican society was not yet prepared to adopt it with all its\r\nconsequences. The intelligence of New England, and the wealth of the\r\ncountry to the south of the Hudson (as I have shown in the preceding\r\nchapter), long exercised a sort of aristocratic influence, which tended\r\nto limit the exercise of social authority within the hands of a few. The\r\npublic functionaries were not universally elected, and the citizens were\r\nnot all of them electors. The electoral franchise was everywhere placed\r\nwithin certain limits, and made dependant on a certain qualification,\r\nwhich was exceedingly low in the north, and more considerable in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe American revolution broke out, and the doctrine of the sovereignty\r\nof the people, which had been nurtured in the townships, took possession\r\nof the state; every class was enlisted in its cause; battles were\r\nfought, and victories obtained for it; until it became the law of laws.\r\n\r\nA scarcely less rapid change was effected in the interior of society,\r\nwhere the law of descent completed the abolition of local influences.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when this consequence of the laws and of the revolution\r\nbecame apparent to every eye, victory was irrevocably pronounced in\r\nfavor of the democratic cause. All power was, in fact, in its hands, and\r\nresistance was no longer possible. The higher orders submitted without\r\na murmur and without a struggle to an evil which was thenceforth\r\ninevitable. The ordinary fate of falling powers awaited them; each\r\nof their several members followed his own interest; and as it was\r\nimpossible to wring the power from the hands of a people which they\r\ndid not detest sufficiently to brave, their only aim was to secure its\r\ngood-will at any price. The most democratic laws were consequently voted\r\nby the very men whose interests they impaired; and thus, although the\r\nhigher classes did not excite the passions of the people against their\r\norder, they accelerated the triumph of the new state of things; so\r\nthat, by a singular change, the democratic impulse was found to be most\r\nirresistible in the very states where the aristocracy had the firmest\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nThe state of Maryland, which had been founded by men of rank, was the\r\nfirst to proclaim universal suffrage,[61] and to introduce the most\r\ndemocratic forms into the conduct of its government.\r\n\r\nWhen a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may easily be\r\nforeseen that sooner or later that qualification will be entirely\r\nabolished. There is no more invariable rule in the history of society:\r\nthe farther electoral rights are extended, the more is felt the need of\r\nextending them; for after each concession the strength of the democracy\r\nincreases, and its demands increase with its strength. The ambition of\r\nthose who are below the appointed rate is irritated in exact proportion\r\nto the great number of those who are above it. The exception at last\r\nbecomes the rule, concession follows concession, and no stop can be made\r\nshort of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the principle of the sovereignty of the people has\r\nacquired, in the United States, all the practical development which the\r\nimagination can conceive. It is unencumbered by those fictions which\r\nhave been thrown over it in other countries, and it appears in every\r\npossible form according to the exigency of the occasion. Sometimes the\r\nlaws are made by the people in a body, as at Athens; and sometimes its\r\nrepresentatives, chosen by universal suffrage, transact business in its\r\nname, and almost under its immediate control.\r\n\r\nIn some countries a power exists which, though it is in a degree foreign\r\nto the social body, directs it, and forces it to pursue a certain track.\r\nIn others the ruling force is divided, being partly within and partly\r\nwithout the ranks of the people. But nothing of the kind is to be seen\r\nin the United States; there society governs itself for itself. All power\r\ncentres in its bosom; and scarcely an individual is to be met with\r\nwho would venture to conceive, or, still more, to express, the idea of\r\nseeking it elsewhere. The nation participates in the making of its laws\r\nby the choice of its legislators, and in the execution of them by the\r\nchoice of the agents of the executive government; it may almost be said\r\nto govern itself, so feeble and so restricted is the share left to the\r\nadministration, so little do the authorities forget their popular origin\r\nand the power from which they emanate.[62]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[61] See the amendments made to the constitution of Maryland in 1801 and\r\n1809.\r\n\r\n[62] See Appendix H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF EXAMINING THE CONDITION OF THE STATES BEFORE THAT OF THE\r\nUNION AT LARGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to examine in the following chapter, what is the form of\r\ngovernment established in America on the principle of the sovereignty of\r\nthe people; what are its resources, its hindrances, its advantages, and\r\nits dangers. The first difficulty which presents itself arises from the\r\ncomplex nature of the constitution of the United States, which consists\r\nof two distinct social structures, connected, and, as it were, encased,\r\none within the other; two governments, completely separate, and almost\r\nindependent, the one fulfilling the ordinary duties, and responding to\r\nthe daily and indefinite calls of a community, the other circumscribed\r\nwithin certain limits, and only exercising an exceptional authority over\r\nthe general interests of the country. In short, there are twenty-four\r\nsmall sovereign nations, whose agglomeration constitutes the body of the\r\nUnion. To examine the Union before we have studied the states, would be\r\nto adopt a method filled with obstacles. The Federal government of the\r\nUnited States was the last which was adopted; and it is in fact nothing\r\nmore than a modification or a summary of these republican principles\r\nwhich were current in the whole community before it existed, and\r\nindependently of its existence. Moreover, the federal government is, as\r\nI have just observed, the exception; the government of the states is the\r\nrule. The author who should attempt to exhibit the picture as a whole,\r\nbefore he had explained its details, would necessarily fall into\r\nobscurity and repetition.\r\n\r\nThe great political principles which govern American society at this\r\nday, undoubtedly took their origin and their growth in the state. It\r\nis therefore necessary to become acquainted with the state in order to\r\npossess a clew to the remainder. The states which at present compose\r\nthe American Union, all present the same features as far as regards the\r\nexternal aspect of their institutions. Their political or administrative\r\nexistence is centred in three foci of action, which may not inaptly be\r\ncompared to the different nervous centres which convey motion to the\r\nhuman body. The township is in the lowest order, then the county, and\r\nlastly the state; and I propose to devote the following chapter to the\r\nexamination of these three divisions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF TOWNSHIPS AND MUNICIPAL BODIES.[63]\r\n\r\nWhy the Author begins the Examination of the Political Institutions with\r\nthe Township.--Its Existence in all Nations.--Difficulty of Establishing\r\nand Preserving Independence.--Its Importance.--Why the Author has\r\nselected the Township System of New England as the main Object of his\r\nInquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is not undesignedly that I begin this subject with the township.\r\nThe village or township is the only association which is so perfectly\r\nnatural, that wherever a number of men are collected, it seems to\r\nconstitute itself.\r\n\r\nThe town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a community, must\r\nnecessarily exist in all nations, whatever their laws and customs\r\nmay be: if man makes monarchies, and establishes republics, the first\r\nassociation of mankind seems constituted by the hand of God. But\r\nalthough the existence of the township is coeval with that of man, its\r\nliberties are not the less rarely respected and easily destroyed. A\r\nnation is always able to establish great political assemblies, because\r\nit habitually contains a certain number of individuals fitted by their\r\ntalents, if not by their habits, for the direction of affairs. The\r\ntownship is, on the contrary, composed of coarser materials, which are\r\nless easily fashioned by the legislator. The difficulties which attend\r\nthe consolidation of its independence rather augment than diminish with\r\nthe increasing enlightenment of the people. A highly-civilized community\r\nspurns the attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at its\r\nnumerous blunders, and is apt to despair of success before the\r\nexperiment is completed. Again, no immunities are so ill-protected from\r\nthe encroachments of the supreme power as those of municipal bodies in\r\ngeneral: they are unable to struggle, single-handed, against a strong\r\nor an enterprising government, and they cannot defend their cause with\r\nsuccess unless it be identified with the customs of the nation and\r\nsupported by public opinion. Thus, until the independence of townships\r\nis amalgamated with the manners of a people, it is easily destroyed;\r\nand it is only after a long existence in the laws that it can be thus\r\namalgamated. Municipal freedom eludes the exertions of man; it is rarely\r\ncreated; but it is, as it were, secretly and spontaneously engendered in\r\nthe midst of a semi-barbarous state of society. The constant action of\r\nthe laws and the national habits, peculiar circumstances, and above\r\nall, time, may consolidate it; but there is certainly no nation on the\r\ncontinent of Europe which has experienced its advantages. Nevertheless,\r\nlocal assemblies of citizens constitute the strength of free nations.\r\nMunicipal institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to\r\nscience; they bring it within the people's reach, they teach men how\r\nto use and how to enjoy it. A nation may establish a system of free\r\ngovernment, but without the spirit of municipal institutions it cannot\r\nhave the spirit of liberty. The transient passions, and the interests of\r\nan hour, or the chance of circumstances, may have created the external\r\nforms of independence; but the despotic tendency which has been repelled\r\nwill, sooner or later, inevitably reappear on the surface.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain to the reader the general principles on which the\r\npolitical organisations of the counties and townships of the United\r\nStates rest, I have thought it expedient to choose one of the states of\r\nNew England as an example, to examine the mechanism of its constitution,\r\nand then to cast a general glance over the country.\r\n\r\nThe township and the county are not organized in the same manner in\r\nevery part of the Union; it is, however, easy to perceive that the same\r\nprinciples have guided the formation of both of them throughout the\r\nUnion. I am inclined to believe that these principles have been carried\r\nfarther in New England than elsewhere, and consequently that they offer\r\ngreater facilities to the observations of a stranger.\r\n\r\nThe institutions of New England form a complete and regular whole; they\r\nhave received the sanction of time, they have the support of the laws,\r\nand the still stronger support of the manners of the community, over\r\nwhich they exercise the most prodigious influence; they consequently\r\ndeserve our attention on every account.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLIMITS OF THE TOWNSHIP.\r\n\r\nThe township of New England is a division which stands between the\r\ncommune and the canton of France, and which corresponds in general to\r\nthe English tithing, or town. Its average population is from two to\r\nthree thousand;[64] so that, on the one hand, the interests of the\r\ninhabitants are not likely to conflict, and, on the other, men capable\r\nof conducting its affairs are always to be found among its citizens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES OF THE TOWNSHIP IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe People the Source of all Power here as Elsewhere.--Manages its own\r\nAffairs. No Corporation.--The greater part of the Authority vested\r\nin the Hands of the Selectmen.--How the Selectmen\r\nact.--Town-meeting.--Enumeration of the public Officers of the Township\r\nObligatory and remunerated Functions.\r\n\r\nIn the township, as well as everywhere else, the people is the only\r\nsource of power; but in no stage of government does the body of citizens\r\nexercise a more immediate influence. In America, the people is a master\r\nwhose exigences demand obedience to the utmost limits of possibility.\r\n\r\nIn New England the majority acts by representatives in the conduct\r\nof the public business of the state; but if such an arrangement be\r\nnecessary in general affairs, in the township, where the legislative\r\nand administrative action of the government is in more immediate contact\r\nwith the subject, the system of representation is not adopted. There is\r\nno corporation; but the body of electors, after having designated\r\nits magistrates, directs them in anything that exceeds the simple and\r\nordinary executive business of the state.[65]\r\n\r\nThis state of things is so contrary to our ideas, and so different from\r\nour customs, that it is necessary for me to adduce some examples to\r\nexplain it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe public duties in the township are extremely numerous and minutely\r\ndivided, as we shall see farther on; but the large proportion of\r\nadministrative power is vested in the hands of a small number of\r\nindividuals called \"the selectmen.\"[66]\r\n\r\nThe general laws of the state impose a certain number of obligations on\r\nthe selectmen, which may they fulfil without the authorization of\r\nthe body they govern, but which they can only neglect on their own\r\nresponsibility. The law of the state obliges them, for instance, to draw\r\nup the list of electors in the townships; and if they omit this part of\r\ntheir functions, they are guilty of a misdemeanor. In all the affairs,\r\nhowever, which are determined by the town-meeting, the selectmen are\r\nthe organs of the popular mandate, as in France the maire executes\r\nthe decree of the municipal council. They usually act upon their own\r\nresponsibility, and merely put in practice principles which have been\r\npreviously recognised by the majority. But if any change is to be\r\nintroduced in the existing state of things, or if they wish to undertake\r\nany new enterprise, they are obliged to refer to the source of their\r\npower. If, for instance, a school is to be established, the selectmen\r\nconvoke the whole body of electors on a certain day at an appointed\r\nplace; they explain the urgency of the case; they give their opinion on\r\nthe means of satisfying it, on the probable expense, and the site which\r\nseems to be most favorable. The meeting is consulted on these several\r\npoints; it adopts the principle, marks out the site, votes the rate, and\r\nconfides the execution of its resolution to the selectmen.\r\n\r\nThe selectmen alone have the right of calling a town-meeting; but they\r\nmay be requested to do so: if the citizens are desirous of submitting\r\na new project to the assent of the township, they may demand a general\r\nconvocation of the inhabitants; the selectmen are obliged to comply, but\r\nthey have only the right of presiding at the meeting.[67]\r\n\r\nThe selectmen are elected every year in the month of April or of\r\nMay. The town-meeting chooses at the same time a number of municipal\r\nmagistrates, who are intrusted with important administrative functions.\r\nThe assessors rate the township; the collectors receive the rate. A\r\nconstable is appointed to keep the peace, to watch the streets, and to\r\nforward the execution of the laws; the town-clerk records all the town\r\nvotes, orders, grants, births, deaths, and marriages; the treasurer\r\nkeeps the funds; the overseer of the poor performs the difficult task of\r\nsuperintending the action of the poor laws; committee-men are\r\nappointed to attend to the schools and to public instruction; and the\r\nroad-surveyors, who take care of the greater and lesser thoroughfares\r\nof the township, complete the list of the principal functionaries. They\r\nare, however, still farther subdivided; and among the municipal officers\r\nare to be found parish commissioners, who audit the expenses of public\r\nworship; different classes of inspectors, some of whom are to direct\r\nthe citizens in case of fire; tithing-men, listers, haywards,\r\nchimney-viewers, fence-viewers to maintain the bounds of property,\r\ntimber-measurers, and sealers of weights and measures.[68]\r\n\r\nThere are nineteen principal offices in a township. Every inhabitant\r\nis constrained, on pain of being fined, to undertake these different\r\nfunctions; which, however, are almost all paid, in order that the poor\r\ncitizens may be able to give up their time without loss. In general the\r\nAmerican system is not to grant a fixed salary to its functionaries.\r\nEvery service has its price, and they are remunerated in proportion to\r\nwhat they have done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXISTENCE OF THE TOWNSHIP.\r\n\r\nEvery one the best Judge of his own Interest.--Corollary of the\r\nPrinciple of the Sovereignty of the People.--Application of these\r\nDoctrines in the Townships of America.--The Township of New England is\r\nSovereign in that which concerns itself alone; subject to the State\r\nin all other matters.--Bond of Township and the State.--In France the\r\nGovernment lends its Agents to the _Commune_.--In America the Reverse\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nI have already observed, that the principle of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople governs the whole political system of the Anglo-Americans. Every\r\npage of this book will afford new instances of the same doctrine. In\r\nthe nations by which the sovereignty of the people is recognised, every\r\nindividual possesses an equal share of power, and participates alike in\r\nthe government of the state. Every individual is therefore supposed\r\nto be as well informed, as virtuous, and as strong, as any of his\r\nfellow-citizens. He obeys the government, not because he is inferior to\r\nthe authorities which conduct it, or that he is less capable than his\r\nneighbor of governing himself, but because he acknowledges the utility\r\nof an association with his fellow-men, and because he knows that no such\r\nassociation can exist without a regulating force. If he be a subject\r\nin all that concerns the mutual relations of citizens, he is free and\r\nresponsible to God alone for all that concerns himself. Hence arises the\r\nmaxim that every one is the best and the sole judge of his own private\r\ninterest, and that society has no right to control a man's actions,\r\nunless they are prejudicial to the common weal, or unless the common\r\nweal demands his co-operation. This doctrine is universally admitted in\r\nthe United States. I shall hereafter examine the general influence which\r\nit exercises on the ordinary actions of life: I am now speaking of the\r\nnature of municipal bodies.\r\n\r\nThe township, taken as a whole, and in relation to the government of the\r\ncountry, may be looked upon as an individual to whom the theory I\r\nhave just alluded to is applied. Municipal independence is therefore a\r\nnatural consequence of the principle of the sovereignty of the people in\r\nthe United States, all the American republics recognise it more or less;\r\nbut circumstances have peculiarly favored its growth in New England.\r\n\r\nIn this part of the Union the impulsion of political activity was given\r\nin the townships; and it may almost be said that each of them originally\r\nformed an independent nation. When the kings of England asserted their\r\nsupremacy, they were contented to assume the central power of the state.\r\nThe townships of New England remained as they were before; and although\r\nthey are now subject to the state, they were at first scarcely dependent\r\nupon it. It is important to remember that they have not been invested\r\nwith privileges, but that they seem, on the contrary, to have\r\nsurrendered a portion of their independence to the state. The townships\r\nare only subordinate to the state in those interests which I shall term\r\n_social_, as they are common to all the citizens. They are independent\r\nin all that concerns themselves; and among the inhabitants of New\r\nEngland I believe that not a man is to be found who would acknowledge\r\nthat the state has any right to interfere in their local interests. The\r\ntowns of New England buy and sell, prosecute or are indicted, augment\r\nor diminish their rates, without the slightest opposition on the part of\r\nthe administrative authority of the state.\r\n\r\nThey are bound, however, to comply with the demands of the community. If\r\nthe state is in need of money, a town can neither give nor withhold the\r\nsupplies. If the state projects a road, the township cannot refuse to\r\nlet it cross its territory; if a police regulation is made by the state,\r\nit must be enforced by the town. A uniform system of instruction is\r\norganised all over the country, and every town is bound to establish the\r\nschools which the law ordains. In speaking of the administration of the\r\nUnited States, I shall have occasion to point out the means by which the\r\ntownships are compelled to obey in these different cases: I here merely\r\nshow the existence of the obligation. Strict as this obligation is,\r\nthe government of the state imposes it in principle only, and in its\r\nperformance the township resumes all its independent rights. Thus,\r\ntaxes are voted by the state, but they are assessed and collected by\r\nthe township; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the township\r\nbuilds, pays, and superintends it. In France the state collector\r\nreceives the local imposts; in America the town collector receives the\r\ntaxes of the state. Thus the French government lends its agents to the\r\ncommune; in America, the township is the agent of the government. This\r\nfact alone shows the extent of the differences which exist between the\r\ntwo nations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SPIRIT OF THE TOWNSHIPS OF NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nHow the Township of New England wins the Affections of its\r\nInhabitants.--Difficulty of creating local public Spirit in\r\nEurope.--The Rights and Duties of the American Township favorable to\r\nit.--Characteristics of Home in the United States.--Manifestations of\r\npublic Spirit in New England.--Its happy Effects.\r\n\r\nIn America, not only do municipal bodies exist, but they are kept alive\r\nand supported by public spirit. The township of New England possesses\r\ntwo advantages which infallibly secure the attentive interest of\r\nmankind, namely, independence and authority. Its sphere is indeed small\r\nand limited, but within that sphere its action is unrestrained; and its\r\nindependence would give to it a real importance, even if its extent and\r\npopulation did not ensure it.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the affections of men are generally turned\r\nonly where there is strength. Patriotism is not durable in a conquered\r\nnation. The New Englander is attached to his township, not only because\r\nhe was born in it, but because it constitutes a strong and free social\r\nbody of which he is a member, and whose government claims and deserves\r\nthe exercise of his sagacity. In Europe, the absence of local public\r\nspirit is a frequent subject of regret to those who are in power; every\r\none agrees that there is no surer guarantee of order and tranquillity,\r\nand yet nothing is more difficult to create. If the municipal bodies\r\nwere made powerful and independent, the authorities of the nation might\r\nbe disunited, and the peace of the country endangered. Yet, without\r\npower and independence, a town may contain good subjects, but it can\r\nhave no active citizens. Another important fact is, that the township\r\nof New England is so constituted as to excite the warmest of human\r\naffections, without arousing the ambitious passions of the heart of man.\r\nThe officers of the county are not elected, and their authority is very\r\nlimited. Even the state is only a second-rate community, whose tranquil\r\nand obscure administration offers no inducement sufficient to draw\r\nmen away from the circle of their interests into the turmoil of public\r\naffairs. The federal government confers power and honor on the men who\r\nconduct it; but these individuals can never be very numerous. The high\r\nstation of the presidency can only be reached at an advanced period of\r\nlife; and the other federal functionaries are generally men who have\r\nbeen favored by fortune, or distinguished in some other career. Such\r\ncannot be the permanent aim of the ambitious. But the township serves\r\nas a centre for the desire of public esteem, the want of exciting\r\ninterests, and the taste for authority and popularity, in the midst of\r\nthe ordinary relations of life: and the passions which commonly embroil\r\nsociety, change their character when they find a vent so near the\r\ndomestic hearth and the family circle.\r\n\r\nIn the American states power has been disseminated with admirable skill,\r\nfor the purpose of interesting the greatest possible number of persons\r\nin the common weal. Independently of the electors who are from time to\r\ntime called into action, the body politic is divided into innumerable\r\nfunctionaries and officers, who all, in their several spheres, represent\r\nthe same powerful corporation in whose name they act. The local\r\nadministration thus affords an unfailing source of profit and interest\r\nto a vast number of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe American system, which divides the local authority among so many\r\ncitizens, does not scruple to multiply the functions of the town\r\nofficers. For in the United States, it is believed, and with truth,\r\nthat patriotism is a kind of devotion, which is strengthened by ritual\r\nobservance. In this manner the activity of the township is continually\r\nperceptible; it is daily manifested in the fulfilment of a duty, or the\r\nexercise of a right; and a constant though gentle motion is thus kept up\r\nin society which animates without disturbing it.\r\n\r\nThe American attaches himself to his home, as the mountaineer clings to\r\nhis hills, because the characteristic features of his country are there\r\nmore distinctly marked than elsewhere. The existence of the townships\r\nof New England is in general a happy one. Their government is suited\r\nto their tastes, and chosen by themselves. In the midst of the profound\r\npeace and general comfort which reign in America, the commotions of\r\nmunicipal discord are infrequent. The conduct of local business is easy.\r\nThe political education of the people has long been complete; say rather\r\nthat it was complete when the people first set foot upon the soil. In\r\nNew England no tradition exists of a distinction of ranks; no portion of\r\nthe community is tempted to oppress the remainder; and the abuses which\r\nmay injure isolated individuals are forgotten in the general contentment\r\nwhich prevails. If the government is defective (and it would no doubt\r\nbe easy to point out its deficiencies), the fact that it really emanates\r\nfrom those it governs, and that it acts, either ill or well, casts\r\nthe protecting spell of a parental pride over its faults. No term of\r\ncomparison disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen: England formerly\r\ngoverned the mass of the colonies, but the people was always sovereign\r\nin the township, where its rule is not only an ancient, but a primitive\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe native of New England is attached to his township because it is\r\nindependent and free; his co-operation in its affairs ensures his\r\nattachment to its interest; the well-being it affords him secures his\r\naffection; and its welfare is the aim of his ambition and of his\r\nfuture exertions; he takes a part in every occurrence in the place; he\r\npractises the art of government in the small sphere within his reach;\r\nhe accustoms himself to those forms which can alone ensure the steady\r\nprogress of liberty; he imbibes their spirit; he acquires a taste for\r\norder, comprehends the union of the balance of powers, and collects\r\nclear practical notions on the nature of his duties and the extent of\r\nhis rights.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTIES OF NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe division of the counties in America has considerable analogy with\r\nthat of the arrondissements of France. The limits of the counties are\r\narbitrarily laid down, and the various districts which they contain have\r\nno necessary connexion, no common traditional or natural sympathy; their\r\nobject is simply to facilitate the administration of public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the township was too small to contain a system of judicial\r\ninstitutions; each county has, however, a court of justice,[69] a\r\nsheriff to execute its decrees, and a prison for criminals. There are\r\ncertain wants which are felt alike by all the townships of a county;\r\nit is therefore natural that they should be satisfied by a central\r\nauthority. In the state of Massachusetts this authority is vested in the\r\nhands of several magistrates who are appointed by the governor of the\r\nstate, with the advice[70] of his council.[71] The officers of the\r\ncounty have only a limited and occasional authority, which is applicable\r\nto certain predetermined cases. The state and the townships possess all\r\nthe power requisite to conduct public business. The budget of the county\r\nis only drawn up by its officers, and is voted by the legislature.[72]\r\nThere is no assembly which directly or indirectly represents the county;\r\nit has, therefore, properly speaking, no political existence.\r\n\r\nA twofold tendency may be discerned in the American constitutions, which\r\nimpels the legislator to centralize the legislative, and to disperse\r\nthe executive power. The township of New England has in itself an\r\nindestructible element of independence; but this distinct existence\r\ncould only be fictitiously introduced into the county, where its utility\r\nhad not been felt. All the townships united have but one representation,\r\nwhich is the state, the centre of the national authority: beyond the\r\naction of the township and that of the nation, nothing can be said to\r\nexist but the influence of individual exertion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nAdministration not perceived in America.--Why?--The Europeans believe\r\nthat Liberty is promoted by depriving the social Authority of some of\r\nits Rights; the Americans, by dividing its Exercise.--Almost all the\r\nAdministration confined to the Township, and divided among the town\r\nOfficers.--No trace of an administrative Hierarchy to be perceived\r\neither in the Township, or above it.--The Reason of this.--How it\r\nhappens that the Administration of the State is uniform.--Who is\r\nempowered to enforce the Obedience of the Township and the County to\r\nthe Law.--The introduction of judicial Power into the\r\nAdministration.--Consequence of the Extension of the elective Principle\r\nto all Functionaries.--The Justice of the Peace in New England.--By\r\nwhom Appointed.--County Officer.--Ensures the Administration of the\r\nTownships.--Court of Sessions.--Its Action.--Right of Inspection\r\nand Indictment disseminated like the other administrative\r\nFunctions.--Informers encouraged by the division of Fines.\r\n\r\nNothing is more striking to a European traveller in the United States\r\nthan the absence of what we term government, or the administration.\r\nWritten laws exist in America, and one sees that they are daily\r\nexecuted; but although everything is in motion, the hand which gives the\r\nimpulse to the social machine can nowhere be discovered. Nevertheless,\r\nas all people are obliged to have recourse to certain grammatical forms,\r\nwhich are the foundation of human language, in order to express their\r\nthoughts; so all communities are obliged to secure their existence by\r\nsubmitting to a certain portion of authority, without which they fall a\r\nprey to anarchy. This authority may be distributed in several ways, but\r\nit must always exist somewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of diminishing the force of authority in a nation.\r\n\r\nThe first is to weaken the supreme power in its very principle, by\r\nforbidding or preventing society from acting in its own defence under\r\ncertain circumstances. To weaken authority in this manner is what is\r\ngenerally termed in Europe to lay the foundations of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe second manner of diminishing the influence of authority does not\r\nconsist in stripping society of any of its rights, nor in paralysing\r\nits efforts, but in distributing the exercise of its privileges among\r\nvarious hands, and in multiplying functionaries, to each of whom the\r\ndegree of power necessary for him to perform his duty is intrusted.\r\nThere may be nations whom this distribution of social powers might lead\r\nto anarchy; but in itself it is not anarchical. The action of authority\r\nis indeed thus rendered less irresistible, and less perilous, but it is\r\nnot totally suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of the United States was the result of a mature and\r\ndeliberate taste for freedom, not of a vague or ill-defined craving for\r\nindependence. It contracted no alliance with the turbulent passions of\r\nanarchy; but its course was marked, on the contrary, by an attachment to\r\nwhatever was lawful and orderly.\r\n\r\nIt was never assumed in the United States that the citizen of a free\r\ncountry has a right to do whatever he pleases: on the contrary, social\r\nobligations were there imposed upon him more various than anywhere\r\nelse; no idea was ever entertained of attacking the principles, or of\r\ncontesting the rights of society; but the exercise of its authority was\r\ndivided, to the end that the office might be powerful and the officer\r\ninsignificant, and that the community should be at once regulated\r\nand free. In no country in the world does the law hold so absolute a\r\nlanguage as in America; and in no country is the right of applying it\r\nvested in so many hands. The administrative power in the United States\r\npresents nothing either central or hierarchical in its constitution,\r\nwhich accounts for its passing unperceived. The power exists, but its\r\nrepresentative is not to be discerned.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the independent townships of New England\r\nprotect their own private interests; and the municipal magistrates\r\nare the persons to whom the execution of the laws of the state is most\r\nfrequently intrusted.[73] Beside the general laws, the state sometimes\r\npasses general police regulations; but more commonly the townships and\r\ntown officers, conjointly with the justices of the peace, regulate\r\nthe minor details of social life, according to the necessities of the\r\ndifferent localities, and promulgate such enactments as concern the\r\nhealth of the community, and the peace as well as morality of the\r\ncitizens.[74] Lastly, these municipal magistrates provide of their\r\nown accord and without any delegated powers, for those unforeseen\r\nemergencies which frequently occur in society.[75]\r\n\r\nIt results, from what we have said, that in the state of Massachusetts\r\nthe administrative authority is almost entirely restricted to the\r\ntownship,[76] but that it is distributed among a great number of\r\nindividuals. In the French commune there is properly but one official\r\nfunctionary, namely, the maire; and in New England we have seen that\r\nthere are nineteen. These nineteen functionaries do not in general\r\ndepend upon one another. The law carefully prescribes a circle of action\r\nto each of these magistrates; and within that circle they have an entire\r\nright to perform their functions independently of any other authority.\r\nAbove the township scarcely any trace of a series of official dignities\r\nis to be found. It sometimes happens that the county officers alter a\r\ndecision of the townships, or town magistrates,[77] but in general\r\nthe authorities of the county have no right to interfere with the\r\nauthorities of the township,[78] except in such matters as concern the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates of the township, as well as those of the county, are\r\nbound to communicate their acts to the central government in a very\r\nsmall number of predetermined cases.[79] But the central government is\r\nnot represented by an individual whose business it is to publish police\r\nregulations and ordinances enforcing the execution of the laws; to keep\r\nup a regular communication with the officers of the township and the\r\ncounty; to inspect their conduct, to direct their actions, or reprimand\r\ntheir faults. There is no point which serves as a centre to the radii of\r\nthe administration.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the uniform plan on which the government is conducted,\r\nand how is the compliance of the counties and their magistrates, or the\r\ntownships and their officers, enforced? In the states of New England the\r\nlegislative authority embraces more subjects than it does in France; the\r\nlegislator penetrates to the very core of the administration; the law\r\ndescends to the most minute details; the same enactment prescribes\r\nthe principle and the method of its application, and thus imposes a\r\nmultitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations on the secondary\r\nfunctionaries of the state. The consequence of this is, that if all\r\nthe secondary functionaries of the administration conform to the law,\r\nsociety in all its branches proceeds with the greatest uniformity; the\r\ndifficulty remains of compelling the secondary functionaries of the\r\nadministration to conform to the law. It may be affirmed that, in\r\ngeneral, society has only two methods of enforcing the execution of\r\nthe laws at its disposal; a discretionary power may be intrusted to a\r\nsuperior functionary of directing all the others, and of cashiering them\r\nin case of disobedience; or the courts of justice may be authorized to\r\ninflict judicial penalties on the offender: but these two methods are\r\nnot always available.\r\n\r\nThe right of directing a civil officer pre-supposes that of cashiering\r\nhim if he does not obey orders, and of rewarding him by promotion if he\r\nfulfils his duties with propriety. But an elected magistrate can neither\r\nbe cashiered nor promoted. All elective functions are inalienable until\r\ntheir term is expired. In fact, the elected magistrate has nothing\r\neither to expect or to fear from his constituents; and when all public\r\noffices are filled by ballot, there can be no series of official\r\ndignities, because the double right of commanding and of enforcing\r\nobedience can never be vested in the same individual, and because the\r\npower of issuing an order can never be joined to that of inflicting a\r\npunishment or bestowing a reward.\r\n\r\nThe communities therefore in which the secondary functionaries of\r\nthe government are elected, are perforce obliged to make great use of\r\njudicial penalties as a means of administration. This is not evident at\r\nfirst sight; for those in power are apt to look upon the institution\r\nof elective functionaries as one concession, and the subjection of\r\nthe elective magistrate to the judges of the land as another. They\r\nare equally averse to both these innovations; and as they are more\r\npressingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they accede\r\nto the election of the magistrate, and leave him independent of the\r\njudicial power. Nevertheless, the second of these measures is the only\r\nthing that can possibly counter-balance the first; and it will be found\r\nthat an elective authority which is not subject to judicial power will,\r\nsooner or later, either elude all control or be destroyed. The courts of\r\njustice are the only possible medium between the central power and the\r\nadministrative bodies; they alone can compel the elected functionary\r\nto obey, without violating the rights of the elector. The extension of\r\njudicial power in the political world ought therefore to be in the exact\r\nratio of the extension of elective offices; if these two institutions\r\ndo not go hand in hand, the state must fall into anarchy or into\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\nIt has always been remarked that habits of legal business do not render\r\nmen apt to the exercise of administrative authority. The Americans have\r\nborrowed from the English, their fathers, the idea of an institution\r\nwhich is unknown upon the continent of Europe: I allude to that of\r\njustices of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the peace is a sort of _mezzo termine_ between the\r\nmagistrate and the man of the world, between the civil officer and the\r\njudge. A justice of the peace is a well-informed citizen, though he is\r\nnot necessarily versed in the knowledge of the laws. His office simply\r\nobliges him to execute the police regulations of society; a task in\r\nwhich good sense and integrity are of more avail than legal science.\r\nThe justice introduces into the administration a certain taste for\r\nestablished forms and publicity, which renders him a most unserviceable\r\ninstrument of despotism; and, on the other hand, he is not blinded\r\nby those superstitions which render legal officers unfit members of a\r\ngovernment. The Americans have adopted the system of English justices\r\nof the peace, but they have deprived it of that aristocratic\r\ncharacter which is discernible in the mother-country. The governor of\r\nMassachusetts[80] appoints a certain number of justices of the peace\r\nin every county, whose functions last seven years.[81] He farther\r\ndesignates three individuals from among the whole body of justices, who\r\nform in each county what is called the court of sessions. The justices\r\ntake a personal share in public business; they are sometimes intrusted\r\nwith administrative functions in conjunction with elected officers;[82]\r\nthey sometimes constitute a tribunal, before which the magistrates\r\nsummarily prosecute a refractory citizen or the citizens inform against\r\nthe abuses of the magistrate. But it is in the court of sessions that\r\nthey exercise their most important functions. This court meets twice a\r\nyear in the county town; in Massachusetts it is empowered to enforce the\r\nobedience of the greater number[83] of public officers.[84] It must be\r\nobserved that in the state of Massachusetts the court of sessions is\r\nat the same time an administrative body, properly so called, and a\r\npolitical tribunal. It has been asserted that the county is a purely\r\nadministrative division. The court of sessions presides over that small\r\nnumber of affairs which, as they concern several townships, or all the\r\ntownships of the county in common, cannot be intrusted to any of them in\r\nparticular.[85]\r\n\r\nIn all that concerns county business, the duties of the court\r\nof sessions are therefore purely administrative; and if in its\r\ninvestigations it occasionally borrows the forms of judicial procedure,\r\nit is only with a view to its own information,[86] or as a guarantee to\r\nthe community over which it presides. But when the administration of the\r\ntownship is brought before it, it almost always acts as a judicial body,\r\nand in some few cases as an administrative assembly.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty is to procure the obedience of an authority so\r\nentirely independent of the general laws of the state as the township\r\nis. We have stated that assessors are annually named by the town\r\nmeetings, to levy the taxes. If a township attempts to evade the payment\r\nof the taxes by neglecting to name its assessors, the court of sessions\r\ncondemns it to a heavy penalty.[87] The fine is levied on each of\r\nthe inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is an officer of\r\njustice, executes the mandate. Thus it is that in the United States the\r\nauthority of the government is mysteriously concealed under the forms of\r\na judicial sentence; and the influence is at the same time fortified by\r\nthat irresistible power with which men have invested the formalities of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings are easy to follow, and to understand. The demands\r\nmade upon a township are in general plain and accurately defined; they\r\nconsist in a simple fact without any complication, or in a principle\r\nwithout its application in detail.[88] But the difficulty increases when\r\nit is not the obedience of the township, but that of the town officers,\r\nwhich is to be enforced. All the reprehensible actions of which a public\r\nfunctionary may be guilty are reducible to the following heads:\r\n\r\nHe may execute the law without energy or zeal;\r\n\r\nHe may neglect to execute the law;\r\n\r\nHe may do what the law enjoins him not to do.\r\n\r\nThe last two violations of duty can alone come under the cognizance of\r\na tribunal; a positive and appreciable fact is the indispensable\r\nfoundation of an action at law. Thus, if the selectmen omit to fulfil\r\nthe legal formalities usual to town elections, they may be condemned to\r\npay a fine;[89] but when the public officer performs his duty without\r\nability, and when he obeys the letter of the law without zeal or energy,\r\nhe is at least beyond the reach of judicial interference. The court of\r\nsessions, even when it is invested with its administrative powers, is\r\nin this case unable to compel him to a more satisfactory obedience. The\r\nfear of removal is the only check to these quasi offences; and as the\r\ncourt of sessions does not originate the town authorities, it cannot\r\nremove functionaries whom it does not appoint. Moreover, a perpetual\r\ninvestigation would be necessary to convict the subordinate officer of\r\nnegligence or lukewarmness; and the court of sessions sits but twice\r\na year, and then only judges such offences as are brought before its\r\nnotice. The only security for that active and enlightened obedience,\r\nwhich a court of justice cannot impose upon public officers, lies in\r\nthe possibility of their arbitrary removal. In France this security is\r\nsought for in powers exercised by the heads of the administration; in\r\nAmerica it is sought for in the principle of election.\r\n\r\nThus, to recapitulate in a few words what I have been showing:--\r\n\r\nIf a public officer in New England commits a crime in the exercise of\r\nhis functions, the ordinary courts of justice are always called upon to\r\npass sentence upon him.\r\n\r\nIf he commits a fault in his official capacity, a purely administrative\r\ntribunal is empowered to punish him; and, if the affair is important or\r\nurgent, the judge supplies the omission of the functionary.[90]\r\n\r\nLastly, if the same individual is guilty of one of those intangible\r\noffences, of which human justice has no cognizance, he annually appears\r\nbefore a tribunal from which there is no appeal, which can at once\r\nreduce him to insignificance, and deprive him of his charge. This system\r\nundoubtedly possesses great advantages, but its execution is attended\r\nwith a practical difficulty which it is important to point out.\r\n\r\nI have already observed, that the administrative tribunal, which is\r\ncalled the court of sessions, has no right of inspection over the town\r\nofficers. It can only interfere when the conduct of a magistrate is\r\nspecially brought under its notice; and this is the delicate part of the\r\nsystem. The Americans of New England are unacquainted with the office\r\nof public prosecutor in the court of sessions,[91] and it may readily be\r\nperceived that it could not have been established without difficulty.\r\nIf an accusing magistrate had merely been appointed in the chief town of\r\neach county, and if he had been unassisted by agents in the townships,\r\nhe would not have been better acquainted with what was going on in the\r\ncounty than the members of the court of sessions. But to appoint agents\r\nin each township, would have been to centre in his person the most\r\nformidable of powers, that of a judicial administration. Moreover,\r\nlaws are the children of habit, and nothing of the kind exists in\r\nthe legislation of England. The Americans have therefore divided the\r\nofficers of inspection and of prosecution as well as all the other\r\nfunctions of the administration. Grand-jurors are bound by the law to\r\napprize the court to which they belong of all the misdemeanors which\r\nmay have been committed in their county.[92] There are certain great\r\noffences which are officially prosecuted by the state;[93] but more\r\nfrequently the task of punishing delinquents devolves upon the fiscal\r\nofficer, whose province it is to receive the fine; thus the treasurer\r\nof the township is charged with the prosecution of such administrative\r\noffences as fall under his notice. But a more especial appeal is made\r\nby American legislation to the private interest of the citizen,[94] and\r\nthis great principle is constantly to be met with in studying the laws\r\nof the United States. American legislators are more apt to give men\r\ncredit for intelligence than for honesty; and they rely not a little on\r\npersonal cupidity for the execution of the laws. When an individual is\r\nreally and sensibly injured by an administrative abuse, it is natural\r\nthat his personal interest should induce him to prosecute. But if\r\na legal formality be required which, however advantageous to the\r\ncommunity, is of small importance to individuals, plaintiffs may be less\r\neasily found; and thus, by a tacit agreement, the laws might fall into\r\ndisuse. Reduced by their system to this extremity, the Americans are\r\nobliged to encourage informers by bestowing on them a portion of the\r\npenalty in certain cases;[95] and to ensure the execution of the laws by\r\nthe dangerous expedient of degrading the morals of the people.\r\n\r\nThe only administrative authority above the county magistrates is,\r\nproperly speaking, that of the government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nDifference of the States of the Union in their Systems of\r\nAdministration.--Activity and Perfection of the local Authorities\r\ndecreases towards the South.--Power of the Magistrates increases; that\r\nof the Elector diminishes.--Administration passes from the Township\r\nto the County.--States of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania.--Principles\r\nof Administration applicable to the whole Union.--Election of public\r\nOfficers, and Inalienability of their Functions.--Absence of Gradation\r\nof Ranks.--Introduction of judicial Resources into the Administration.\r\n\r\nI have already promised that after having examined the constitution of\r\nthe township and the county of New England in detail, I should take\r\na general view of the remainder of the Union. Townships and a local\r\nactivity exist in every state; but in no part of the confederation is a\r\ntownship to be met with precisely similar to those in New England. The\r\nmore we descend toward the south, the less active does the business of\r\nthe township or parish become; the number of magistrates, of functions,\r\nand of rights, decreases; the population exercises a less immediate\r\ninfluence on affairs; town-meetings are less frequent, and the subjects\r\nof debates less numerous. The power of the elected magistrate is\r\naugmented, and that of the elector diminished, while the public spirit\r\nof the local communities is less awakened and less influential.[96]\r\n\r\nThese differences may be perceived to a certain extent in the state of\r\nNew York; they are very sensible in Pennsylvania; but they become less\r\nstriking as we advance to the northwest. The majority of the emigrants\r\nwho settle in the northwestern states are natives of New England, and\r\nthey carry the habits of their mother-country with them into that which\r\nthey adopt. A township in Ohio is by no means dissimilar from a township\r\nin Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Massachusetts the principal part of the public\r\nadministration lies in the township. It forms the common centre of the\r\ninterests and affections of the citizens. But this ceases to be the case\r\nas we descend to states in which knowledge is less generally diffused,\r\nand where the township consequently offers fewer guarantees of a wise\r\nand active administration. As we leave New England, therefore, we find\r\nthat the importance of the town is gradually transferred to the county,\r\nwhich becomes the centre of administration, and the intermediate power\r\nbetween the government and the citizen. In Massachusetts the business of\r\nthe town is conducted by the court of sessions, which is composed of a\r\n_quorum_ named by the governor and his council; but the county has\r\nno representative assembly, and its expenditure is voted by the\r\nnational[97] legislature. In the great state of New York, on the\r\ncontrary, and in those of Ohio and Pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each\r\ncounty choose a certain number of representatives, who constitute the\r\nassembly of the county.[98] The county assembly has the right of taxing\r\nthe inhabitants to a certain extent; and in this respect it enjoys the\r\nprivileges of a real legislative body: at the same time it exercises an\r\nexecutive power in the county, frequently directs the administration of\r\nthe townships, and restricts their authority within much narrower bounds\r\nthan in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal differences which the systems of county and town\r\nadministration present in the federal states. Were it my intention to\r\nexamine the provisions of American law minutely, I should have to point\r\nout still farther differences in the executive details of the several\r\ncommunities. But what I have already said may suffice to show the\r\ngeneral principles on which the administration of the United States\r\nrests. These principles are differently applied; their consequences\r\nare more or less numerous in various localities; but they are always\r\nsubstantially the same. The laws differ, and their outward features\r\nchange, but their character does not vary. If the township and the\r\ncounty are not everywhere constituted in the same manner, it is at least\r\ntrue that in the United States the county and the township are always\r\nbased upon the same principle, namely, that every one is the best judge\r\nof what concerns himself alone, and the person most able to supply his\r\nprivate wants. The township and the county are therefore bound to take\r\ncare of their special interests: the state governs, but it does not\r\ninterfere with their administration. Exceptions to this rule may be met\r\nwith, but not a contrary principle.\r\n\r\nThe first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all the\r\nmagistrates to be chosen either by, or at least from among the citizens.\r\nAs the officers are everywhere elected or appointed for a certain\r\nperiod, it has been impossible to establish the rules of a dependent\r\nseries of authorities; there are almost as many independent\r\nfunctionaries as there are functions, and the executive power is\r\ndisseminated in a multitude of hands. Hence arose the indispensable\r\nnecessity of introducing the control of the courts of justice over the\r\nadministration, and the system of pecuniary penalties, by which the\r\nsecondary bodies and their representatives are constrained to obey the\r\nlaws. The system obtains from one end of the Union to the other. The\r\npower of punishing the misconduct of public officers, or of performing\r\nthe part of the executive, in urgent cases, has not, however, been\r\nbestowed on the same judges in all the states. The Anglo-Americans\r\nderived the institution of justices of the peace from a common source;\r\nbut although it exists in all the states, it is not always turned to\r\nthe same use. The justices of the peace everywhere participate in the\r\nadministration of the townships and the counties,[99] either as public\r\nofficers or as the judges of public misdemeanors, but in most of the\r\nstates the more important classes of public offences come under the\r\ncognisance of the ordinary tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe election of public officers, or the inalienability of their\r\nfunctions, the absence of a gradation of powers, and the introduction\r\nof a judicial control over the secondary branches of the administration,\r\nare the universal characteristics of the American system from Maine to\r\nthe Floridas. In some states (and that of New York has advanced most\r\nin this direction) traces of a centralised administration begin to\r\nbe discernible. In the state of New York the officers of the central\r\ngovernment exercise, in certain cases, a sort of inspection of control\r\nover the secondary bodies.[100] At other times they constitute a court\r\nof appeal for the decision of affairs.[101] In the state of New York\r\njudicial penalties are less used than in other parts as a means of\r\nadministration; and the right of prosecuting the offences of public\r\nofficers is vested in fewer hands.[102] The same tendency is faintly\r\nobservable in some other states;[103] but in general the prominent\r\nfeature of the administration in the United States is its excessive\r\nlocal independence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOF THE STATE.\r\n\r\nI have described the townships and the administration: it now remains\r\nfor me to speak of the state and government. This is ground I may pass\r\nover rapidly, without fear of being misunderstood; for all I have to say\r\nis to be found in written forms of the various constitutions, which are\r\neasily to be procured.[104] These constitutions rest upon a simple and\r\nrational theory; their forms have been adopted by all constitutional\r\nnations, and are become familiar to us.\r\n\r\nIn this place, therefore, it is only necessary for me to give a short\r\nanalysis; I shall endeavor afterward to pass judgment upon what I now\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE POWER OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\nDivision of the Legislative Body into two Houses.--Senate.--House of\r\nRepresentatives.--Different functions of these two Bodies.\r\n\r\nThe legislative power of the state is vested in two assemblies, the\r\nfirst of which generally bears the name of the senate.\r\n\r\nThe senate is commonly a legislative body; but it sometimes becomes an\r\nexecutive and judicial one. It takes a part in the government in several\r\nways, according to the constitution of the different states;[105] but\r\nit is in the nomination of public functionaries that it most commonly\r\nassumes an executive power. It partakes of judicial power in the trial\r\nof certain political offences, and sometimes also in the decision of\r\ncertain civil cases.[106] The number of its members is always small. The\r\nother branch of the legislature, which is usually called the house of\r\nrepresentatives, has no share whatever in the administration, and only\r\ntakes a part in the judicial power inasmuch as it impeaches public\r\nfunctionaries before the senate.\r\n\r\nThe members of the two houses are nearly everywhere subject to the same\r\nconditions of election. They are chosen in the same manner, and by the\r\nsame citizens.\r\n\r\nThe only difference which exists between them is, that the term for\r\nwhich the senate is chosen, is in general longer than that of the house\r\nof representatives. The latter seldom remain in office longer than a\r\nyear; the former usually sit two or three years.\r\n\r\nBy granting to the senators the privilege of being chosen for several\r\nyears, and being renewed seriatim, the law takes care to preserve in the\r\nlegislative body a nucleus of men already accustomed to public business,\r\nand capable of exercising a salutary influence upon the junior members.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, plainly, did not desire, by this separation of the\r\nlegislative body into two branches, to make one house hereditary and the\r\nother elective; one aristocratic and the other democratic. It was not\r\ntheir object to create in the one a bulwark to power, while the\r\nother represented the interests and passions of the people. The only\r\nadvantages which result from the present constitution of the United\r\nStates, are, the division of the legislative power, and the consequent\r\ncheck upon political assemblies; with the creation of a tribunal of\r\nappeal for the revision of the laws.\r\n\r\nTime and experience, however, have convinced the Americans that if these\r\nare its only advantages, the division of the legislative power is still\r\na principle of the greatest necessity. Pennsylvania was the only one of\r\nthe United States which at first attempted to establish a single\r\nhouse of assembly; and Franklin himself was so far carried away by\r\nthe necessary consequences of the principle of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople, as to have concurred in the measure; but the Pennsylvanians\r\nwere soon obliged to change the law, and to create two houses. Thus\r\nthe principle of the division of the legislative power was finally\r\nestablished, and its necessity may henceforward be regarded as a\r\ndemonstrated truth.\r\n\r\nThis theory, which was nearly unknown to the republics of\r\nantiquity--which was introduced into the world almost by accident, like\r\nso many other great truths--and misunderstood by several modern nations,\r\nis at length become an axiom in the political science of the present\r\nage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE POWER OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\nOffice of Governor in an American State.--The Place he occupies in\r\nrelation to the Legislature.--His Rights and his Duties.--His Dependence\r\non the People.\r\n\r\nThe executive power of the state may with truth be said to be\r\n_represented_ by the governor, although he enjoys but a portion of its\r\nrights. The supreme magistrate, under the title of governor, is the\r\nofficial moderator and counsellor of the legislature. He is armed with\r\na suspensive veto, which allows him to stop, or at least to retard,\r\nits movements at pleasure. He lays the wants of the country before\r\nthe legislative body, and points out the means which he thinks may be\r\nusefully employed in providing for them; he is the natural executor\r\nof its decrees in all the undertakings which interest the nation at\r\nlarge.[107] In the absence of the legislature, the governor is bound to\r\ntake all necessary steps to guard the state against violent shocks and\r\nunforeseen dangers.\r\n\r\nThe whole military power of the state is at the disposal of the\r\ngovernor. He is commander of the militia and head of the armed force.\r\nWhen the authority, which is by general consent awarded to the laws, is\r\ndisregarded, the governor puts himself at the head of the armed force of\r\nthe state, to quell resistance and to restore order.\r\n\r\nLastly, the governor takes no share in the administration of townships\r\nand counties, except it be indirectly in the nomination of justices of\r\nthe peace, which nomination he has not the power to revoke.[108]\r\n\r\nThe governor is an elected magistrate, and is generally chosen for one\r\nor two years only; so that he always continues to be strictly dependent\r\non the majority who returned him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL EFFECTS OF THE SYSTEM OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nNecessary Distinction between the general Centralisation of\r\nGovernment and the Centralisation of the local Administration.--Local\r\nAdministration not centralized in the United States; great general\r\nCentralisation of the Government.--Some bad Consequences resulting\r\nto the United States from the local Administration.--Administrative\r\nAdvantages attending the Order of things.--The Power which conducts the\r\nGovernment is less regular, less enlightened, less learned, but\r\nmuch greater than in Europe.--Political Advantages of this Order\r\nof things.--In the United States the Interests of the Country are\r\neverywhere kept in View.--Support given to the Government by the\r\nCommunity.--Provincial Institutions more necessary in Proportion as the\r\nsocial Condition becomes more democratic.--Reason of this.\r\n\r\nCentralisation is become a word of general and daily use, without any\r\nprecise meaning being attached to it. Nevertheless, there exist two\r\ndistinct kinds of centralisation, which it is necessary to discriminate\r\nwith accuracy.\r\n\r\nCertain interests are common to all parts of a nation, such as the\r\nenactment of its general laws, and the maintenance of its foreign\r\nrelations. Other interests are peculiar to certain parts of the nation;\r\nsuch, for instance, as the business of different townships. When the\r\npower which directs the general interests is centred in one place, or\r\nin the same persons, it constitutes a central government. The power of\r\ndirecting partial or local interests, when brought together, in like\r\nmanner constitutes what may be termed a central administration.\r\n\r\nUpon some points these two kinds of centralisation coalesce; but by\r\nclassifying the objects which fall more particularly within the province\r\nof each of them, they may easily be distinguished.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a central government acquires immense power when\r\nunited to administrative centralisation. Thus combined, it accustoms men\r\nto set their own will habitually and completely aside; to submit, not\r\nonly for once or upon one point, but in every respect, and at all times.\r\nNot only, therefore, does the union of power subdue them by force, but\r\nit affects them in the ordinary habits of life, and influences each\r\nindividual, first separately, and then collectively.\r\n\r\nThese two kinds of centralisation mutually assist and attract each\r\nother: but they must not be supposed to be inseparable. It is impossible\r\nto imagine a more completely central government than that which existed\r\nin France under Louis XIV.; when the same individual was the author and\r\nthe interpreter of the laws, and being the representative of France\r\nat home and abroad, he was justified in asserting that the state was\r\nidentified with his person. Nevertheless, the administration was much\r\nless centralized under Louis XIV., than it is at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn England the centralisation of the government is carried to great\r\nperfection; the state has the compact vigor of a man, and by the\r\nsole act of its will it puts immense engines in motion, and wields or\r\ncollects the efforts of its authority. Indeed, I cannot conceive that\r\na nation can enjoy a secure or prosperous existence without a powerful\r\ncentralisation of government. But I am of opinion that a central\r\nadministration enervates the nations in which it exists by incessantly\r\ndiminishing their public spirit. If such an administration succeeds\r\nin condensing at a given moment on a given point all the disposable\r\nresources of a people, it impairs at least the renewal of those\r\nresources. It may ensure a victory in the hour of strife, but it\r\ngradually relaxes the sinews of strength. It may contribute admirably\r\nto the transient greatness of a man, but it cannot ensure the durable\r\nprosperity of a people.\r\n\r\nIf we pay proper attention, we shall find that whenever it is said\r\nthat a state cannot act because it has no central point, it is the\r\ncentralisation of the government in which it is deficient. It is\r\nfrequently asserted, and we are prepared to assent to the proposition,\r\nthat the German empire was never able to bring all its powers into\r\naction. But the reason was, that the state has never been able to\r\nenforce obedience to its general laws, because the several members\r\nof that great body always claimed the right, or found the means,\r\nof refusing their co-operation to the representatives of the common\r\nauthority, even in the affairs which concerned the mass of the people;\r\nin other words, because there was no centralisation of government.\r\nThe same remark is applicable to the middle ages; the cause of all the\r\nconfusion of feudal society was that the control, not only of local but\r\nof general interests, was divided among a thousand hands, and broken\r\nup in a thousand different ways; the absence of a central government\r\nprevented the nations of Europe from advancing with energy in any\r\nstraightforward course.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that in the United States no central administration, and\r\nno dependent series of public functionaries, exist. Local authority has\r\nbeen carried to lengths which no European nation could endure without\r\ngreat inconvenience, and which have even produced some disadvantageous\r\nconsequences in America. But in the United States the centralisation\r\nof the government is complete; and it would be easy to prove that\r\nthe national power is more compact than it has ever been in the old\r\nmonarchies of Europe. Not only is there but one legislative body in each\r\nstate; not only does there exist but one source of political authority;\r\nbut numerous district assemblies and county courts have in general been\r\navoided, lest they should be tempted to exceed their administrative\r\nduties and interfere with the government. In America the legislature\r\nof each state is supreme; nothing can impede its authority; neither\r\nprivileges, nor local immunities, nor personal influence, nor even the\r\nempire of reason, since it represents that majority which claims to be\r\nthe sole organ of reason. Its own determination is, therefore, the only\r\nlimit to its action. In juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate\r\ncontrol, is the representative of the executive power, whose duty it\r\nis to constrain the refractory to submit by superior force. The only\r\nsymptom of weakness lies in certain details of the action of the\r\ngovernment. The American republics have no standing armies to intimidate\r\na discontented minority; but as no minority has as yet been reduced to\r\ndeclare open war, the necessity of an army has not been felt. The state\r\nusually employs the officers of the township or the county, to deal with\r\nthe citizens. Thus, for instance, in New England the assessor fixes the\r\nrate of taxes; the collector receives them; the town treasurer transmits\r\nthe amount to the public treasury; and the disputes which may arise are\r\nbrought before the ordinary courts of justice. This method of collecting\r\ntaxes is slow as well as inconvenient, and it would prove a perpetual\r\nhindrance to a government whose pecuniary demands were large. In general\r\nit is desirable that in what ever materially affects its existence, the\r\ngovernment should be served by officers of its own, appointed by itself,\r\nremovable at pleasure, and accustomed to rapid methods of proceeding.\r\nBut it will always be easy for the central government, organized as it\r\nis in America, to introduce new and more efficacious modes of action\r\nproportioned to its wants.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a central government will not, then, as has often been\r\nasserted, prove the destruction of the republics of the New World;\r\nfar from supposing that the American governments are not sufficiently\r\ncentralized, I shall prove hereafter that they are too much so. The\r\nlegislative bodies daily encroach upon the authority of the government,\r\nand their tendency, like that of the French convention, is to\r\nappropriate it entirely to themselves. Under these circumstances the\r\nsocial power is constantly changing hands, because it is subordinate to\r\nthe power of the people, which is too apt to forget the maxims of wisdom\r\nand of foresight in the consciousness of its strength: hence arises its\r\ndanger; and thus its vigor, and not its impotence, will probably be the\r\ncause of its ultimate destruction.\r\n\r\nThe system of local administration produces several different effects in\r\nAmerica. The Americans seem to me to have outstepped the limits of sound\r\npolicy, in isolating the administration of the government; for order,\r\neven in second-rate affairs, is a matter of national importance.[109] As\r\nthe state has no administrative functionaries of its own, stationed on\r\ndifferent parts of its territory, to whom it can give a common impulse,\r\nthe consequence is that it rarely attempts to issue any general police\r\nregulations. The want of these regulations is severely felt, and is\r\nfrequently observed by Europeans. The appearance of disorder which\r\nprevails on the surface, leads them at first to imagine that society is\r\nin a state of anarchy; nor do they perceive their mistake till they have\r\ngone deeper into the subject. Certain undertakings are of importance to\r\nthe whole state; but they cannot be put in execution, because there is\r\nno national administration to direct them. Abandoned to the exertions\r\nof the towns or counties, under the care of elected or temporary agents,\r\nthey lead to no result, or at least to no durable benefit.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of centralisation in Europe maintain that the government\r\ndirects the affairs of each locality better than the citizens could\r\ndo it for themselves: this may be true when the central power is\r\nenlightened, and when the local districts are ignorant; when it is as\r\nalert as they are slow; when it is accustomed to act, and they to obey.\r\nIndeed, it is evident that this double tendency must augment with the\r\nincrease of centralisation, and that the readiness of the one, and the\r\nincapacity of the others, must become more and more prominent. But I\r\ndeny that such is the case when the people is as enlightened, as awake\r\nto its interests, and as accustomed to reflect on them, as the Americans\r\nare. I am persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the collective\r\nstrength of the citizens will always conduce more efficaciously to the\r\npublic welfare than the authority of the government. It is difficult to\r\npoint out with certainty the means of arousing a sleeping population,\r\nand of giving it passions and knowledge which it does not possess; it\r\nis, I am well aware, an arduous task to persuade men to busy themselves\r\nabout their own affairs; and it would frequently be easier to interest\r\nthem in the punctilios of court etiquette than in the repairs of their\r\ncommon dwelling. But whenever a central administration affects to\r\nsupersede the persons most interested, I am inclined to suppose that\r\nit is either misled, or desirous to mislead. However enlightened and\r\nhowever skilful a central power may be, it cannot of itself embrace all\r\nthe details of the existence of a great nation. Such vigilance exceeds\r\nthe powers of man. And when it attempts to create and set in motion so\r\nmany complicated springs, it must submit to a very imperfect result, or\r\nconsume itself in bootless efforts.\r\n\r\nCentralisation succeeds more easily, indeed, in subjecting the external\r\nactions of men to a certain uniformity, which at last commands our\r\nregard, independently of the objects to which it is applied, like those\r\ndevotees who worship the statue and forget the deity it represents.\r\nCentralisation imparts without difficulty an admirable regularity to\r\nthe routine of business; rules the details of the social police\r\nwith sagacity; represses the smallest disorder and the most petty\r\nmisdemeanors; maintains society in a _status quo_, alike secure from\r\nimprovement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy precision in the\r\nconduct of affairs, which is hailed by the heads of the administration\r\nas a sign of perfect order and public tranquillity;[110] in short, it\r\nexcels more in prevention than in action. Its force deserts it when\r\nsociety is to be disturbed or accelerated in its course; and if once the\r\nco-operation of private citizens is necessary to the furtherance of\r\nits measures, the secret of its impotence is disclosed. Even while it\r\ninvokes their assistance, it is on the condition that they shall act\r\nexactly as much as the government chooses, and exactly in the manner it\r\nappoints. They are to take charge of the details, without aspiring to\r\nguide the system; they are to work in a dark and subordinate sphere,\r\nand only to judge the acts in which they have themselves co-operated, by\r\ntheir results. These, however, are not conditions on which the alliance\r\nof the human will is to be obtained; its carriage must be free, and its\r\nactions responsible, or (such is the constitution of man) the citizen\r\nhad rather remain a passive spectator than a dependent actor in schemes\r\nwith which he is unacquainted.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable, that the want of those uniform regulations which\r\ncontrol the conduct of every inhabitant of France is not unfrequently\r\nfelt in the United States. Gross instances of social indifference and\r\nneglect are to be met with; and from time to time disgraceful blemishes\r\nare seen, in complete contrast with the surrounding civilisation. Useful\r\nundertakings, which cannot succeed without perpetual attention and\r\nrigorous exactitude, are very frequently abandoned in the end; for in\r\nAmerica, as well as in other countries, the people is subject to sudden\r\nimpulses and momentary exertions. The European who is accustomed to find\r\na functionary always at hand to interfere with all he undertakes, has\r\nsome difficulty in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of the\r\nadministration of the townships. In general it may be affirmed that the\r\nlesser details of the police, which render life easy and comfortable,\r\nare neglected in America; but that the essential guarantees of man in\r\nsociety are as strong there as elsewhere. In America the power which\r\nconducts the government is far less regular, less enlightened, and less\r\nlearned, but a hundredfold more authoritative, than in Europe. In no\r\ncountry in the world do the citizens make such exertions for the common\r\nweal; and I am acquainted with no people which has established schools\r\nas numerous and as efficacious, places of public worship better suited\r\nto the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.\r\nUniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of\r\ndetails,[111] and the perfection of an ingenious administration, must\r\nnot be sought for in the United States; but it will be easy to find,\r\non the other hand, the symptoms of a power, which, if it is somewhat\r\nbarbarous, is at least robust; and of an existence, which is checkered\r\nwith accidents indeed, but cheered at the same time by animation and\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nGranting for an instant that the villages and counties of the United\r\nStates would be more usefully governed by a remote authority, which\r\nthey had never seen, than by functionaries taken from the midst of\r\nthem--admitting, for the sake of argument, that the country would be\r\nmore secure, and the resources of society better employed, if the whole\r\nadministration centred in a single arm, still the _political_ advantages\r\nwhich the Americans derive from their system would induce me to prefer\r\nit to the contrary plan. It profits me but little, after all, that\r\na vigilant authority protects the tranquillity of my pleasures, and\r\nconstantly averts all danger from my path, without my care or my\r\nconcern, if the same authority is the absolute mistress of my liberty\r\nand of my life, and if it so monopolises all the energy of existence,\r\nthat when it languishes everything languishes around it, that when it\r\nsleeps everything must sleep, that when it dies the state itself must\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nIn certain countries of Europe the natives consider themselves as a kind\r\nof settlers, indifferent to the fate of the spot upon which they live.\r\nThe greatest changes are effected without their concurrence and (unless\r\nchance may have apprised them of the event) without their knowledge; nay\r\nmore, the citizen is unconcerned as to the condition of his village, the\r\npolice of his street, the repairs of the church or the parsonage; for\r\nhe looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself, and as the\r\nproperty of a powerful stranger whom he calls the government. He has\r\nonly a life-interest in these possessions, and he entertains no notions\r\nof ownership or of improvement. This want of interest in his own\r\naffairs goes so far, that if his own safety or that of his children is\r\nendangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold his arms,\r\nand wait till the nation comes to his assistance. This same individual,\r\nwho has so completely sacrificed his own free will, has no natural\r\npropensity to obedience; he cowers, it is true, before the pettiest\r\nofficer; but he braves the law with the spirit of a conquered foe\r\nas soon as its superior force is removed: his oscillations between\r\nservitude and license are perpetual. When a nation has arrived at this\r\nstate, it must either change its customs and its laws, or perish: the\r\nsource of public virtue is dry; and though it may contain subjects,\r\nthe race of citizens is extinct. Such communities are a natural prey to\r\nforeign conquest; and if they do not disappear from the scene of life,\r\nit is because they are surrounded by other nations similar or inferior\r\nto themselves; it is because the instinctive feeling of their country's\r\nclaims still exists in their hearts; and because an involuntary pride\r\nin the name it bears, or the vague reminiscence of its by-gone fame,\r\nsuffices to give them the impulse of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nNor can the prodigious exertions made by certain people in the defence\r\nof a country, in which they may almost be said to have lived as aliens,\r\nbe adduced in favor of such a system; for it will be found that in these\r\ncases their main incitement was religion. The permanence, the glory, and\r\nthe prosperity of the nation, were become parts of their faith; and in\r\ndefending the country they inhabited, they defended that holy city of\r\nwhich they were all citizens. The Turkish tribes have never taken\r\nan active share in the conduct of the affairs of society, but they\r\naccomplished stupendous enterprises as long as the victories of the\r\nsultans were the triumphs of the Mohammedan faith. In the present\r\nage they are in rapid decay, because their religion is departing, and\r\ndespotism only remains. Montesquieu, who attributed to absolute power an\r\nauthority peculiar to itself, did it, as I conceive, undeserved honor;\r\nfor despotism, taken by itself, can produce no durable results. On close\r\ninspection we shall find that religion, and not fear, has ever been the\r\ncause of the long-lived prosperity of absolute governments. Whatever\r\nexertions may be made, no true power can be founded among men which does\r\nnot depend upon the free union of their inclinations; and patriotism\r\nand religion are the only two motives in the world which can permanently\r\ndirect the whole of a body politic to one end.\r\n\r\nLaws cannot succeed in rekindling the ardor of an extinguished faith;\r\nbut men may be interested in the fate of their country by the laws. By\r\nthis influence, the vague impulse of patriotism, which never abandons\r\nthe human heart, may be directed and revived: and if it be connected\r\nwith the thoughts, the passions and daily habits of life, it may be\r\nconsolidated into a durable and rational sentiment. Let it not be said\r\nthat the time for the experiment is already past; for the old age of\r\nnations is not like the old age of men, and every fresh generation is a\r\nnew people ready for the care of the legislator.\r\n\r\nIt is not the _administrative_, but the _political_ effects of the local\r\nsystem that I most admire in America. In the United States the interests\r\nof the country are everywhere kept in view; they are an object of\r\nsolicitude to the people of the whole Union, and every citizen is as\r\nwarmly attached to them as if they were his own. He takes pride in the\r\nglory of his nation; he boasts of his success, to which he conceives\r\nhimself to have contributed; and he rejoices in the general prosperity\r\nby which he profits. The feeling he entertains toward the state is\r\nanalogous to that which unites him to his family, and it is by a kind of\r\negotism that he interests himself in the welfare of his country.\r\n\r\nThe European generally submits to a public officer because he represents\r\na superior force; but to an American he represents a right. In America\r\nit may be said that no one renders obedience to man, but to justice\r\nand to law. If the opinion which the citizen entertains of himself is\r\nexaggerated, it is at least salutary; he unhesitatingly confides in his\r\nown powers, which appear to him to be all-sufficient. When a private\r\nindividual meditates an undertaking, however directly connected it\r\nmay be with the welfare of society, he never thinks of soliciting the\r\nco-operation of the government: but he publishes his plan, offers to\r\nexecute it himself, courts the assistance of other individuals, and\r\nstruggles manfully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly he is less\r\nsuccessful than the state might have been in his position; but in the\r\nend, the sum of these private undertakings far exceeds all that the\r\ngovernment could effect.\r\n\r\nAs the administrative authority is within the reach of the citizens,\r\nwhom it in some degree represents, it excites neither their jealousy nor\r\ntheir hatred: as its resources are limited, every one feels that he must\r\nnot rely solely on its assistance. Thus when the administration thinks\r\nfit to interfere, it is not abandoned to itself as in Europe; the duties\r\nof the private citizens are not supposed to have lapsed because the\r\nstate assists in their fulfilment; but every one is ready, on the\r\ncontrary, to guide and to support it. This action of individual\r\nexertions, joined to that of the public authorities, frequently performs\r\nwhat the most energetic central administration would be unable to\r\nexecute. It would be easy to adduce several facts in proof of what I\r\nadvance, but I had rather give only one, with which I am more thoroughly\r\nacquainted.[112] In America, the means which the authorities have at\r\ntheir disposal for the discovery of crimes and the arrest of criminals\r\nare few. A state police does not exist, and passports are unknown. The\r\ncriminal police of the United States cannot be compared with that of\r\nFrance; the magistrates and public prosecutors are not numerous, and the\r\nexaminations of prisoners are rapid and oral. Nevertheless in no country\r\ndoes crime more rarely elude punishment. The reason is that every one\r\nconceives himself to be interested in furnishing evidence of the act\r\ncommitted, and in stopping the delinquent. During my stay in the United\r\nStates, I saw the spontaneous formation of committees for the pursuit\r\nand prosecution of a man who had committed a great crime in a certain\r\ncounty. In Europe a criminal is an unhappy being, who is struggling\r\nfor his life against the ministers of justice, while the population is\r\nmerely a spectator of the conflict: in America he is looked upon as an\r\nenemy of the human race, and the whole of mankind is against him.\r\n\r\nI believe that provincial institutions are useful to all nations, but\r\nnowhere do they appear to me to be more indispensable than among a\r\ndemocratic people. In an aristocracy, order can always be maintained in\r\nthe midst of liberty; and as the rulers have a great deal to lose, order\r\nis to them a first-rate consideration. In like manner an aristocracy\r\nprotects the people from the excesses of despotism, because it always\r\npossesses an organized power ready to resist a despot. But a democracy\r\nwithout provincial institutions has no security against these evils. How\r\ncan a populace, unaccustomed to freedom in small concerns, learn to\r\nuse it temperately in great affairs? What resistance can be offered to\r\ntyranny in a country where every private individual is impotent, and\r\nwhere the citizens are united by no common tie? Those who dread the\r\nlicense of the mob, and those who fear the rule of absolute power, ought\r\nalike to desire the progressive growth of provincial liberties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am convinced that democratic nations are most\r\nexposed to fall beneath the yoke of a central administration, for\r\nseveral reasons, among which is the following:--\r\n\r\nThe constant tendency of these nations is to concentrate all the\r\nstrength of the government in the hands of the only power which directly\r\nrepresents the people: because, beyond the people nothing is to be\r\nperceived but a mass of equal individuals confounded together. But when\r\nthe same power is already in possession of all the attributes of the\r\ngovernment, it can scarcely refrain from penetrating into the details\r\nof the administration; and an opportunity of doing so is sure to present\r\nitself in the end, as was the case in France. In the French revolution\r\nthere were two impulses in opposite directions, which must never be\r\nconfounded; the one was favorable to liberty, the other to despotism.\r\nUnder the ancient monarchy the king was the sole author of the laws;\r\nand below the power of the sovereign, certain vestiges of provincial\r\ninstitutions half-destroyed, were still distinguishable. These\r\nprovincial institutions were incoherent, ill-compacted, and frequently\r\nabsurd; in the hands of the aristocracy they had sometimes been\r\nconverted into instruments of oppression. The revolution declared itself\r\nthe enemy of royalty and of provincial institutions at the same time;\r\nit confounded all that had preceded it--despotic power and the checks to\r\nits abuses--in an indiscriminate hatred; and its tendency was at once to\r\nrepublicanism and to centralisation. This double character of the French\r\nrevolution is a fact which has been adroitly handled by the friends\r\nof absolute power. Can they be accused of laboring in the cause of\r\ndespotism, when they are defending of the revolution?[113] In this\r\nmanner popularity may be conciliated with hostility to the rights of the\r\npeople, and the secret slave of tyranny may be the professed admirer of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nI have visited the two nations in which the system of provincial liberty\r\nhas been most perfectly established, and I have listened to the opinions\r\nof different parties in those countries. In America I met with men who\r\nsecretly aspired to destroy the democratic institutions of the Union; in\r\nEngland, I found others who attacked aristocracy openly; but I know of\r\nno one who does not regard provincial independence as a great benefit.\r\nIn both countries I have heard a thousand different causes assigned for\r\nthe evils of the state; but the local system was never mentioned among\r\nthem. I have heard citizens attribute the power and prosperity of their\r\ncountry to a multitude of reasons: but they _all_ placed the advantages\r\nof local institutions in the foremost rank.\r\n\r\nAm I to suppose that when men who are naturally so divided on religious\r\nopinions, and on political theories, agree on one point (and that, one\r\nof which they have daily experience), they are all in error? The only\r\nnations which deny the utility of provincial liberties are those which\r\nhave fewest of them; in other words, those who are unacquainted with the\r\ninstitution are the only persons who pass a censure upon it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[63] It is by this periphrasis that I attempt to render the French\r\nexpressions \"_Commune_\" and \"_Système Communal_.\" I am not aware that\r\nany English word precisely corresponds to the general term of the\r\noriginal. In France every association of human dwellings forms a\r\n_commune_, and every commune is governed by a _maire_ and a _conseil\r\nmunicipal_. In other words, the _mancipium_ or municipal privilege,\r\nwhich belongs in England to chartered corporations alone, is alike\r\nextended to every commune into which the cantons and departments of\r\nFrance were divided at the revolution. Thence the different application\r\nof the expression, which is general in one country and restricted in the\r\nother. In America, the counties of the northern states are divided into\r\ntownships, those of the southern into parishes; besides which, municipal\r\nbodies, bearing the name of corporations, exist in the cities. I shall\r\napply these several expressions to render the term _commune_. The term\r\n\"parish,\" now commonly used in England, belongs exclusively to the\r\necclesiastical division; it denotes the limits over which a\r\n_parson's_ (_personae ecclesiae_ or perhaps _parochianus_) rights\r\nextend.--_Translator's Note_.\r\n\r\n[64] In 1830, there were 305 townships in the state of Massachusetts and\r\n610,014 inhabitants; which gives an average of about 2,000 inhabitants\r\nto each township.\r\n\r\n[65] The same rules are not applicable to the great towns, which\r\ngenerally have a mayor, and a corporation divided into two bodies; this,\r\nhowever, is an exception which requires a sanction of a law. See the\r\nact of 22d February, 1822, for appointing the authorities of the city\r\nof Boston. It frequently happens that small towns as well as cities\r\nare subject to a peculiar administration. In 1832, 104 townships in the\r\nstate of New York were governed in this manner.--_Williams's Register_.\r\n\r\n[66] Three selectmen are appointed in the small townships, and nine in\r\nthe large ones. See \"The Town Officer,\" p. 186. See also the principal\r\nlaws of the state of Massachusetts relative to the selectmen:--\r\n\r\nAct of the 20th February, 1786, vol. i, p. 219; 24th February, 1796,\r\nvol. i., p. 488, 7th March, 1801, vol. ii., p. 45; 16th June, 1795, vol.\r\ni., p. 475; 12th March, 1808, vol. ii., p. 186; 28th February, 1787,\r\nvol. i., p. 302; 22d June, 1797, vol. i., p. 539.\r\n\r\n[67] See laws of Massachusetts, vol. i., p. 150 Act of the 25th March,\r\n1786.\r\n\r\n[68] All these magistrates actually exist; their different functions\r\nare all detailed in a book called, \"The Town Officer,\" by Isaac\r\nGoodwin, Worcester, 1827; and in the Collection of the General Laws of\r\nMassachusetts, 3 vols., Boston, 1823.\r\n\r\n[69] See the act of 14th February, 1821. Laws of Massachusetts, vol i.,\r\np. 551.\r\n\r\n[70] See the act of 20th February, 1819. Laws of Massachusetts, vol ii.,\r\np. 494.\r\n\r\n[71] The council of the governor is an elective body.\r\n\r\n[72] See the act of 2d November, 1791. Laws of Massachusetts, vol i., p.\r\n61.\r\n\r\n[73] See \"The Town Officer,\" especially at the words SELECTMEN,\r\nASSESSORS, COLLECTORS, SCHOOLS, SURVEYORS OF HIGHWAYS. I take one\r\nexample in a thousand: the state prohibits travelling on a Sunday; the\r\n_tything-men_, who are town-officers, are especially charged to keep\r\nwatch and to execute the law. See the laws of Massachusetts, vol. i., p.\r\n410. The selectmen draw up the lists of electors for the election of the\r\ngovernor, and transmit the result of the ballot to the secretary of the\r\nstate. See act of 24th February, 1796; _Ib_., vol. i., p. 488.\r\n\r\n[74] Thus, for instance, the selectmen authorise the construction of\r\ndrains, point out the proper sites for slaughter-houses and other trades\r\nwhich are a nuisance to the neighborhood. See the act of 7th June, 1735;\r\nLaws of Massachusetts, vol. i., p. 193.\r\n\r\n[75] The selectmen take measures for the security of the public in case\r\nof contagious disease, conjointly with the justices of the peace. See\r\nthe act of 22d June, 1797; vol. i., p. 539.\r\n\r\n[76] I say _almost_, for there are various circumstances in the annals\r\nof a township which are regulated by the justice of the peace in his\r\nindividual capacity, or by the justices of the peace, assembled in the\r\nchief town of the county; thus licenses are granted by the justices. See\r\nthe act of 28th Feb., 1787; vol. i., p. 297.\r\n\r\n[77] Thus licenses are only granted to such persons as can produce a\r\ncertificate of good conduct from the selectmen. If the selectmen refuse\r\nto give the certificate, the party may appeal to the justices assembled\r\nin the court of sessions; and they may grant the license. See the act of\r\n12th March, 1808; vol. ii., p. 186.\r\n\r\nThe townships have the right to make by-laws, and to enforce them by\r\nfines which are fixed by law; but these by-laws must be approved by the\r\ncourt of sessions. See the act of 23d March, 1786; vol. i., p. 254.\r\n\r\n[78] In Massachusetts the county-magistrates are frequently called upon\r\nto investigate the acts of the town-magistrates; but it will be shown\r\nfarther on that this investigation is a consequence, not of their\r\nadministrative, but of their judicial power.\r\n\r\n[79] The town committees of schools are obliged to make an annual report\r\nto the secretary of the state on the condition of the School. See the\r\nact of 10th March, 1827; vol. iii., p. 183.\r\n\r\n[80] We shall hereafter learn what a governor is; I shall content myself\r\nwith remarking in this place, that he represents the executive power of\r\nthe whole state.\r\n\r\n[81] See the constitution of Massachusetts, chap ii., § 1; chap iii., §\r\n3.\r\n\r\n[82] Thus, for example, a stranger arrives in a township from a country\r\nwhere a contagious disease prevails, and he falls ill. Two justices of\r\nthe peace can, with the assent of the selectmen, order the sheriff of\r\nthe county to remove and take care of him. Act of 22d June, 1797; vol.\r\ni., p. 540.\r\n\r\nIn general the justices interfere in all the important acts of the\r\nadministration, and give them a semi-judicial character.\r\n\r\n[83] I say the greater number because certain administrative\r\nmisdemeanors are brought before the ordinary tribunals. If, for\r\ninstance, a township refuses to make the necessary expenditure for its\r\nschools, or to name a school-committee, it is liable to a heavy fine.\r\nBut this penalty is pronounced by the supreme judicial court or\r\nthe court of common pleas. See the act of 10th March, 1827; laws of\r\nMassachusetts, vol. iii., p. 190. Or when a township neglects to provide\r\nthe necessary war-stores. Act of 21st February, 1822; Id. vol. ii., p.\r\n570.\r\n\r\n[84] In their individual capacity, the justices of the peace take a part\r\nin the business of the counties and townships. The more important\r\nacts of the municipal government are rarely decided upon without the\r\nco-operation of one of their body.\r\n\r\n[85] These affairs may be brought under the following heads: 1. The\r\nerection of prisons and courts of justice. 2. The county budget, which\r\nis afterward voted by the state. 3. The assessment of the taxes so\r\nvoted. 4. Grants of certain patents. 5. The laying down and repairs of\r\nthe county roads.\r\n\r\n[86] Thus, when a road is under consideration, almost all difficulties\r\nare disposed of by the aid of the jury.\r\n\r\n[87] See the act of the 20th February, 1786; laws of Massachusetts, vol.\r\n1., p. 217.\r\n\r\n[88] There is an indirect method of enforcing the obedience of\r\na township. Suppose that the funds which the law demands for the\r\nmaintenance of the roads have not been voted; the town-surveyor is then\r\nauthorized, _ex-officio_, to levy the supplies. As he is personally\r\nresponsible to private individuals for the state of the roads, and\r\nindictable before the court of sessions, he is sure to employ the\r\nextraordinary right which the law gives him against the township. Thus\r\nby threatening the officer, the court of sessions exacts compliance from\r\nthe town. See the act of 5th March, 1787; laws of Massachusetts, vol.\r\n1., p. 305.\r\n\r\n[89] Laws of Massachusetts, vol. 2., p. 45.\r\n\r\n[90] If, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name its\r\nassessors, the court of sessions nominates them; and the magistrates\r\nthus appointed are invested with the same authority as elected officers\r\nSee the act quoted above, 20th February, 1787.\r\n\r\n[91] I say the court of sessions, because in common courts there is a\r\nmagistrate who exercises some of the functions of a public prosecutor.\r\n\r\n[92] The grand-jurors are, for instance, bound to inform the court of\r\nthe bad state of the roads. Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i., p. 308.\r\n\r\n[93] If, for instance, the treasurer of the county holds back his\r\naccount. Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i., p. 406.\r\n\r\n[94] Thus, if a private individual breaks down or is wounded in\r\nconsequence of the badness of a road, he can sue the township or the\r\ncounty for damages at the sessions. Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i., p.\r\n309.\r\n\r\n[95] In cases of invasion or insurrection, if the town officers neglect\r\nto furnish the necessary stores and ammunition for the militia, the\r\ntownship may be condemned to a fine of from two to five hundred dollars.\r\nIt may readily be imagined that in such a case it might happen that no\r\none cared to prosecute: hence the law adds that all the citizens may\r\nindict offences of this kind, and that half the fine shall belong to the\r\nplaintiff. See the act of 6th March, 1810; vol. ii., p. 236. The same\r\nclause is frequently to be met with in the laws of Massachusetts. Not\r\nonly are private individuals thus incited to prosecute public officers,\r\nbut the public officers are encouraged in the same manner to bring the\r\ndisobedience of private individuals to justice. If a citizen refuses\r\nto perform the work which has been assigned to him upon a road, the\r\nroad-surveyor may prosecute him, and he receives half the penalty for\r\nhimself. See the laws above quoted, vol. i., p. 308.\r\n\r\n[96] For details, see Revised Statutes of the state of New York, part I,\r\nchap, xi., vol. i., pp. 336-364, entitled, \"Of the Powers, Duties, and\r\nPrivileges of Towns.\"\r\n\r\nSee in the digest of the laws of Pennsylvania, the words, ASSESSORS,\r\nCOLLECTOR, CONSTABLES, OVERSEER OF THE POOR, SUPERVISORS OF HIGHWAYS:\r\nand in the acts of a general nature of the state of Ohio, the act of\r\n25th February, 1834, relating to townships, p. 412; beside the peculiar\r\ndispositions relating to divers town officers, such as township's\r\nclerks, trustees, overseers of the poor, fence-viewers, appraisers of\r\nproperty, township's treasurer, constables, supervisors of highways.\r\n\r\n[97] The author means the state legislature.

See the Statutes of the State of\r\nTennessee, _arts._ JUDICIARY, TAXES, &c.\r\n\r\n[100] For instance, the direction of public instruction centres in\r\nthe hands of the government. The legislature names the members of\r\nthe university, who are denominated regents; the governor and\r\nlieutenant-governor of the state are necessarily of the number. Revised\r\nStatutes, vol. i., p. 455. The regents of the university annually visit\r\nthe colleges and academies, and make their report to the legislature.\r\nTheir superintendence is not inefficient, for several reasons: the\r\ncolleges in order to become corporations stand in need of a charter,\r\nwhich is only granted on the recommendation of the regents: every year\r\nfunds are distributed by the state for the encouragement of learning,\r\nand the regents are the distributors of this money. See chap. xv.,\r\n\"Public Instruction,\" Revised Statutes, vol i., p. 455.\r\n\r\nThe school commissioners are obliged to send an annual report to the\r\nsuperintendent of the state. _Idem_, p. 448.\r\n\r\nA similar report is annually made to the same person on the number and\r\ncondition of the poor. _Idem_, p. 631.\r\n\r\n[101] If any one conceives himself to be wronged by the school\r\ncommissioners (who are town-officers), he can appeal to the\r\nsuperintendent of the primary schools, whose decision is final. Revised\r\nStatutes, vol. i., p. 487.\r\n\r\nProvisions similar to those above cited are to be met with from time to\r\ntime in the laws of the state of New York: but in general these attempts\r\nat centralisation are weak and unproductive. The great authorities of\r\nthe state have the right of watching and controlling the subordinate\r\nagents, without that of rewarding or punishing them. The same individual\r\nis never empowered to give an order and to punish disobedience; he\r\nhas therefore the right of commanding, without the means of exacting\r\ncompliance. In 1830 the superintendent of schools complained in\r\nhis annual report addressed to the legislature, that several school\r\ncommissioners had neglected, notwithstanding his application, to furnish\r\nhim with the accounts which were due. He added, that if this omission\r\ncontinued, he should be obliged to prosecute them, as the law directs,\r\nbefore the proper tribunals.\r\n\r\n[102] Thus the district-attorney is directed to recover all fines,\r\nunless such a right has been specially awarded to another magistrate.\r\nRevised Statutes, vol. i., p. 383.\r\n\r\n[103] Several traces of centralisation may be discovered in\r\nMassachusetts, for instance, the committees of the town-schools are\r\ndirected to make an annual report to the secretary of state. See Laws of\r\nMassachusetts, vol. i., p. 367.\r\n\r\n[104] See the constitution of New York.\r\n\r\n[105] In Massachusetts the Senate is not invested with any\r\nadministrative functions.\r\n\r\n[106] As in the state of New York.\r\n\r\n[107] Practically speaking, it is not always the governor who executes\r\nthe plans of the legislature; it often happens that the latter, in\r\nvoting a measure, names special agents to superintend the execution of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[108] In some of the states the Justices of the peace are not nominated\r\nby the governor.\r\n\r\n[109] The authority which represents the state ought not, I think, to\r\nwaive the right of inspecting the local administration, even when it\r\ndoes not interfere more actively. Suppose, for instance, that an agent\r\nof the government was stationed at some appointed spot, in the county,\r\nto prosecute the misdemeanors of the town and county officers, would not\r\na more uniform order be the result, without in any way compromising the\r\nindependence of the township? Nothing of the kind, however, exists in\r\nAmerica; there is nothing above the county courts, which have, as it\r\nwere, only an accidental cognizance of the offences they are meant to\r\nrepress.\r\n\r\n[This note seems to have been written without reference to the provision\r\nexisting, it is believed in every state of the Union, by which a local\r\nofficer is appointed in each county, to conduct all public prosecutions\r\nat the expense of the state. And in each county, a grand-jury is\r\nassembled three or four times at least in every year, to which all who\r\nare aggrieved have free access, and where every complaint, particularly\r\nthose against public officers, which has the least color of truth, is\r\nsure to be heard and investigated.\r\n\r\nSuch an agent as the author suggests would soon come to be considered a\r\npublic informer, the most odious of all characters in the United States;\r\nand he would lose all efficiency and strength. With the provision above\r\nmentioned, there is little danger that a citizen, oppressed by a public\r\nofficer, would find any difficulty in becoming his own informer,\r\nand inducing a rigid inquiry into the alleged misconduct.--_American\r\nEditor_.]\r\n\r\n[110] China appears to me to present the most perfect instance of that\r\nspecies of well-being which a completely central administration may\r\nfurnish to the nations among which it exists. Travellers assure us that\r\nthe Chinese have peace without happiness, industry without improvement,\r\nstability without strength, and public order without public morality.\r\nThe condition of society is always tolerable, never excellent. I am\r\nconvinced that, when China is opened to European observation, it will\r\nbe found to contain the most perfect model of a central administration\r\nwhich exists in the universe.\r\n\r\n[111] A writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has drawn\r\nbetween the finances of France and those of the United States, has\r\nproved that ingenuity cannot always supply the place of a knowledge of\r\nfacts, very justly reproaches the Americans for the sort of confusion\r\nwhich exists in the accounts of the expenditure in the townships; and\r\nafter giving the model of a departmental budget in France, he adds: \"We\r\nare indebted to centralisation, that admirable invention of a great\r\nman, for the uniform order and method which prevail alike in all the\r\nmunicipal budgets, from the largest town to the humblest commune.\"\r\nWhatever may be my admiration of this result, when I see the communes of\r\nFrance, with their excellent system of accounts, plunged in the grossest\r\nignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to so incorrigible\r\nan apathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to live; when, on the\r\nother hand, I observe the activity, the information, and the spirit of\r\nenterprise which keeps society in perpetual labor, in those American\r\ntownships whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with still\r\nless uniformity, I am struck by the spectacle; for to my mind the end\r\nof a good government is to ensure the welfare of a people, and not\r\nto establish order and regularity in the midst of its misery and its\r\ndistress. I am therefore led to suppose that the prosperity of the\r\nAmerican townships and the apparent confusion of their accounts, the\r\ndistress of the French communes and the perfection of their budget,\r\nmay be attributable to the same cause. At any rate I am suspicious of a\r\nbenefit which is united to so many evils, and I am not averse to an evil\r\nwhich is compensated by so many benefits.\r\n\r\n[112] See Appendix I.\r\n\r\n[113] See Appendix K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL POWER IN THE UNITED STATES, AND ITS INFLUENCE ON POLITICAL\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans have retained the Characteristics of judicial Power\r\nwhich are common to all Nations.--They have, however, made it a\r\npowerful political Organ.--How.--In what the judicial System of the\r\nAnglo-Americans differs from that of all other Nations.--Why\r\nthe American Judges have the right of declaring the Laws to be\r\nUnconstitutional.--How they use this Right.--Precautions taken by the\r\nLegislator to prevent its abuse.\r\n\r\nI have thought it essential to devote a separate chapter to the judicial\r\nauthorities of the United States, lest their great political importance\r\nshould be lessened in the reader's eyes by a merely incidental mention\r\nof them. Confederations have existed in other countries beside America;\r\nand republics have not been established on the shores of the New World\r\nalone: the representative system of government has been adopted in\r\nseveral states of Europe; but I am not aware that any nation of the\r\nglobe has hitherto organized a judicial power on the principle adopted\r\nby the Americans. The judicial organization of the United States is\r\nthe institution which the stranger has the greatest difficulty in\r\nunderstanding. He hears the authority of a judge invoked in the\r\npolitical occurrences of every day, and he naturally concludes that\r\nin the United States the judges are important political functionaries:\r\nnevertheless, when he examines the nature of the tribunals, they offer\r\nnothing which is contrary to the usual habits and privileges of those\r\nbodies; and the magistrates seem to him to interfere in public affairs\r\nby chance, but by a chance which recurs every day.\r\n\r\nWhen the Parliament of Paris remonstrated, or refused to enregister an\r\nedict, or when it summoned a functionary accused of malversation to its\r\nbar, its political influence as a judicial body was clearly visible; but\r\nnothing of the kind is to be seen in the United States. The Americans\r\nhave retained all the ordinary characteristics of judicial authority,\r\nand have carefully restricted its action to the ordinary circle of its\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThe first characteristic of judicial power in all nations is the duty\r\nof arbitration. But rights must be contested in order to warrant the\r\ninterference of a tribunal; and an action must be brought to obtain the\r\ndecision of a judge. As long, therefore, as a law is uncontested, the\r\njudicial authority is not called upon to discuss it, and it may exist\r\nwithout being perceived. When a judge in a given case attacks a law\r\nrelating to that case, he extends the circle of his customary duties,\r\nwithout, however, stepping beyond it; since he is in some measure\r\nobliged to decide upon the law, in order to decide the case. But if\r\nhe pronounces upon a law without resting upon a case, he clearly steps\r\nbeyond his sphere, and invades that of the legislative authority.\r\n\r\nThe second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on\r\nspecial cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge, in deciding\r\na particular point, destroys a general principle, by passing a judgment\r\nwhich tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and\r\nconsequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his\r\nfunctions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without having\r\na particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations\r\nhave agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and\r\nperhaps a more useful influence than that of the magistrate, but he\r\nceases to represent the judicial power.\r\n\r\nThe third characteristic of the judicial power is its inability to act\r\nunless it is appealed to, or until it has taken cognizance of an\r\naffair. This characteristic is less general than the other two; but\r\nnotwithstanding the exceptions, I think it may be regarded as essential.\r\nThe judicial power is by its nature devoid of action; it must be put in\r\nmotion in order to produce a result. When it is called upon to repress a\r\ncrime, it punishes the criminal; when a wrong is to be redressed, it is\r\nready to redress it; when an act requires interpretation, it is prepared\r\nto interpret it; but it does not pursue criminals, hunt out wrongs,\r\nor examine into evidence of its own accord. A judicial functionary who\r\nshould open proceedings, and usurp the censorship of the laws, would in\r\nsome measure do violence to the passive nature of his authority.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics\r\nof the judicial power; an American judge can only pronounce a decision\r\nwhen litigation has arisen, he is only conversant with special cases,\r\nand he cannot act until the cause has been duly brought before the\r\ncourt. His position is therefore perfectly similar to that of the\r\nmagistrate of other nations; and he is nevertheless invested with\r\nimmense political power. If the sphere of his authority and his means of\r\naction are the same as those of other judges, it may be asked whence he\r\nderives a power which they do not possess. The cause of this difference\r\nlies in the simple fact that the Americans have acknowledged the right\r\nof the judges to found their decisions on the constitution, rather than\r\non the laws. In other words, they have left them at liberty not to apply\r\nsuch laws as may appear to them to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nI am aware that a similar right has been claimed--but claimed in\r\nvain--by courts of justice in other countries; but in America it is\r\nrecognized by all the authorities; and not a party, nor so much as an\r\nindividual, is found to contest it. This fact can only be explained by\r\nthe principles of the American constitution. In France the constitution\r\nis (or at least is supposed to be) immutable; and the received theory is\r\nthat no power has the right of changing any part of it. In England, the\r\nparliament has an acknowledged right to modify the constitution: as,\r\ntherefore, the constitution may undergo perpetual changes, it does\r\nnot in reality exist; the parliament is at once a legislative and a\r\nconstituent assembly. The political theories of America are more simple\r\nand more rational. An American constitution is not supposed to be\r\nimmutable as in France; nor is it susceptible of modification by the\r\nordinary powers of society as in England. It constitutes a detached\r\nwhole, which, as it represents the determination of the whole people, is\r\nno less binding on the legislator than on the private citizen, but\r\nwhich may be altered by the will of the people in predetermined cases,\r\naccording to established rules. In America the constitution may,\r\ntherefore, vary, but as long as it exists it is the origin of all\r\nauthority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating force.[114]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must act\r\nupon the position and the rights of the judicial bodies in the three\r\ncountries I have cited. If in France the tribunals were authorized\r\nto disobey the laws on the ground of their being opposed to the\r\nconstitution, the supreme power would in fact be placed in their hands,\r\nsince they alone would have the right of interpreting a constitution,\r\nthe clauses of which can be modified by no authority. They would,\r\ntherefore, take the place of the nation, and exercise as absolute a sway\r\nover society as the inherent weakness of judicial power would allow them\r\nto do. Undoubtedly, as the French judges are incompetent to declare a\r\nlaw to be unconstitutional, the power of changing the constitution is\r\nindirectly given to the legislative body, since no legal barrier would\r\noppose the alterations which it might prescribe. But it is better to\r\ngrant the power of changing the constitution of the people to men who\r\nrepresent (however imperfectly) the will of the people, than to men who\r\nrepresent no one but themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would be still more unreasonable to invest the English judges with\r\nthe right of resisting the decisions of the legislative body, since\r\nthe parliament which makes the laws also makes the constitution; and\r\nconsequently a law emanating from the three powers of the state can in\r\nno case be unconstitutional. But neither of these remarks is applicable\r\nto America.[115]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the constitution governs the legislator as much as\r\nthe private citizen: as it is the first of laws, it cannot be modified\r\nby a law; and it is therefore just that the tribunals should obey the\r\nconstitution in preference to any law. This condition is essential to\r\nthe power of the judicature; for to select that legal obligation\r\nby which he is most strictly bound, is the natural right of every\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nIn France the constitution is also the first of laws, and the judges\r\nhave the same right to take it as the ground of their decisions; but\r\nwere they to exercise this right, they must perforce encroach on rights\r\nmore sacred than their own, namely, on those of society, in whose name\r\nthey are acting. In this case the state motive clearly prevails over the\r\nmotives of an individual. In America, where the nation can always reduce\r\nits magistrates to obedience by changing its constitution, no danger of\r\nthis kind is to be feared. Upon this point therefore the political and\r\nthe logical reason agree, and the people as well as the judges preserve\r\ntheir privileges.\r\n\r\nWhenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is argued\r\nin a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule;\r\nthis power is the only one which is peculiar to the American magistrate,\r\nbut it gives rise to immense political influence. Few laws can escape\r\nthe searching analysis; for there are few which are not prejudicial to\r\nsome private interest or other, and none which may not be brought before\r\na court of justice by the choice of parties, or by the necessity of the\r\ncase. But from the time that a judge has refused to apply any given law\r\nin a case, that law loses a portion of its moral sanction. The persons\r\nto whose interest it is prejudicial, learn that means exist of evading\r\nits authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes\r\npowerless. One of two alternatives must then be resorted to: the people\r\nmust alter the constitution, or the legislature must repeal the law.\r\n\r\nThe political power which the Americans have intrusted to their courts\r\nof justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are\r\nconsiderably diminished, by the obligation which has been imposed of\r\nattacking the laws through the courts of justice alone. If the judge\r\nhad been empowered to contest the laws on the ground of theoretical\r\ngeneralities; if he had been enabled to open an attack or to pass a\r\ncensure on the legislator, he would have played a prominent part in the\r\npolitical sphere; and as the champion or the antagonist of a party, he\r\nwould have arrayed the hostile passions of the nation in the conflict.\r\nBut when a judge contests a law, applied to some particular case in an\r\nobscure proceeding, the importance of his attack is concealed from the\r\npublic gaze; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and\r\nif the law is slighted, it is only collaterally. Moreover, although it\r\nbe censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but\r\nits cogency is by no means suspended; and its final destruction can only\r\nbe accomplished by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries. It\r\nwill readily be understood that by connecting the censorship of the\r\nlaws with the private interests of members of the community, and by\r\nintimately uniting the prosecution of the law with the prosecution of\r\nan individual, the legislation is protected from wanton assailants, and\r\nfrom the daily aggressions of party spirit. The errors of the legislator\r\nare exposed whenever their evil consequences are most felt; and it is\r\nalways a positive and appreciable fact which serves as the basis of a\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at\r\nonce the most favorable to liberty as well as to public order. If the\r\njudge could only attack the legislator openly and directly, he would\r\nsometimes be afraid to oppose any resistance to his will; and at other\r\nmoments party spirit might encourage him to brave it every day. The laws\r\nwould consequently be attacked when the power from which they emanate\r\nis weak, and obeyed when it is strong. That is to say, when it would be\r\nuseful to respect them, they would be contested; and when it would be\r\neasy to convert them into an instrument of oppression, they would be\r\nrespected. But the American judge is brought into the political arena\r\nindependently of his own will. He only judges the law because he is\r\nobliged to judge a case. The political question which he is called upon\r\nto resolve is connected with the interest of the parties, and he cannot\r\nrefuse to decide it without abdicating the duties of his post. He\r\nperforms his functions as a citizen by fulfilling the strict duties\r\nwhich belong to his profession as a magistrate. It is true that upon\r\nthis system the judicial censorship which is exercised by the courts of\r\njustice over the legislation cannot extend to all laws indiscriminately,\r\ninasmuch as some of them can never give rise to that precise species\r\nof contestation which is termed a lawsuit; and even when such a\r\ncontestation is possible, it may happen that no one cares to bring\r\nit before a court of justice. The Americans have often felt this\r\ndisadvantage, but they have left the remedy incomplete, lest they should\r\ngive it efficacy which in some cases might prove dangerous. Within\r\nthese limits, the power vested in the American courts of justice of\r\npronouncing a statute to be unconstitutional, forms one of the most\r\npowerful barriers which have ever been devised against the tyranny of\r\npolitical assemblies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOTHER POWERS GRANTED TO THE AMERICAN JUDGES.\r\n\r\nIn the United States all the Citizens have the Right of indicting the\r\npublic Functionaries before the ordinary Tribunals.--How they use this\r\nRight.--Art. 75 of the An VIII.--The Americans and the English cannot\r\nunderstand the Purport of this Clause.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly natural that in a free country like America all the\r\ncitizens should have the right of indicting public functionaries before\r\nthe ordinary tribunals, and that all the judges should have the power of\r\npunishing public offences. The right granted to the courts of justice,\r\nof judging the agents of the executive government, when they have\r\nviolated the laws, is so natural a one that it cannot be looked upon as\r\nan extraordinary privilege. Nor do the springs of government appear to\r\nme to be weakened in the United States by the custom which renders all\r\npublic officers responsible to the judges of the land. The Americans\r\nseem, on the contrary, to have increased by this means that respect\r\nwhich is due to the authorities, and at the same time to have rendered\r\nthose who are in power more scrupulous of offending public opinion. I\r\nwas struck by the small number of political trials which occur in\r\nthe United States; but I have no difficulty in accounting for this\r\ncircumstance. A lawsuit, of whatever nature it may be, is always a\r\ndifficult and expensive undertaking. It is easy to attack a public man\r\nin a journal, but the motives which can warrant an action at law must be\r\nserious. A solid ground of complaint must therefore exist, to induce an\r\nindividual to prosecute a public officer, and public officers careful\r\nnot to furnish these grounds of complaint, when they are afraid of being\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\nThis does not depend upon the republican form of the American\r\ninstitutions, for the same facts present themselves in England. These\r\ntwo nations do not regard the impeachment of the principal officers of\r\nstate as a sufficient guarantee of their independence. But they hold\r\nthat the right of minor prosecutions, which are within the reach of the\r\nwhole community, is a better pledge of freedom than those great judicial\r\nactions which are rarely employed until it is too late.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, when it was very difficult to overtake offenders,\r\nthe judges inflicted the most dreadful tortures on the few who were\r\narrested, which by no means diminished the number of crimes. It has\r\nsince been discovered that when justice is more certain and more mild,\r\nit is at the same time more efficacious. The English and the Americans\r\nhold that tyranny and oppression are to be treated like any other crime,\r\nby lessening the penalty and facilitating conviction.\r\n\r\nIn the year VIII. of the French republic, a constitution was drawn up in\r\nwhich the following clause was introduced: \"Art. 75. All the agents of\r\nthe government below the rank of ministers can only be prosecuted for\r\noffences relating to their several functions by virtue of a decree of\r\nthe conseil d'etat; in which case the prosecution takes place before\r\nthe ordinary tribunals.\" This clause survived the \"Constitution de l'an\r\nVIII.,\" and it is still maintained in spite of the just complaints of\r\nthe nation. I have always found the utmost difficulty in explaining its\r\nmeaning to Englishmen or Americans. They were at once led to conclude\r\nthat the conseil d'etat in France was a great tribunal, established in\r\nthe centre of the kingdom, which exercised a preliminary and somewhat\r\ntyrannical jurisdiction in all political causes. But when I told them\r\nthat the conseil d'etat was not a judicial body, in the common sense of\r\nthe term, but an administrative council composed of men dependent on\r\nthe crown--so that the king, after having ordered one of his servants,\r\ncalled a prefect, to commit an injustice, has the power of commanding\r\nanother of his servants, called a councillor of state, to prevent the\r\nformer from being punished--when I demonstrated to them that the citizen\r\nwho had been injured by the order of the sovereign is obliged to solicit\r\nfrom the sovereign permission to obtain redress, they refused to credit\r\nso flagrant an abuse, and were tempted to accuse me of falsehood or\r\nof ignorance. It frequently happened before the revolution that a\r\nparliament issued a warrant against a public officer who had committed\r\nan offence; and sometimes the proceedings were annulled by the authority\r\nof the crown. Despotism then displayed itself openly, and obedience was\r\nextorted by force. We have then retrograded from the point which our\r\nforefathers had reached, since we allow things to pass under the color\r\nof justice and the sanction of the law, which violence alone could\r\nimpose upon them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[114] See Appendix L.\r\n\r\n[115] See Appendix M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinition of political Jurisdiction.--What is understood by political\r\nJurisdiction in France, in England, and in the United States.--In\r\nAmerica the political Judge can only pass Sentence on public\r\nOfficers.--He more frequently passes a Sentence of Removal from Office\r\nthan a Penalty.--Political Jurisdiction, as it Exists in the United\r\nStates, is, notwithstanding its Mildness, and perhaps in Consequence of\r\nthat Mildness, a most powerful Instrument in the Hands of the Majority.\r\n\r\nI understand, by political jurisdiction, that temporary right of\r\npronouncing a legal decision with which a political body may be\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nIn absolute governments no utility can accrue from the introduction of\r\nextraordinary forms of procedure; the prince, in whose name an offender\r\nis prosecuted, is as much the sovereign of the courts of justice as of\r\neverything else, and the idea which is entertained of his power is of\r\nitself a sufficient security. The only thing he has to fear is, that the\r\nexternal formalities of justice may be neglected, and that his authority\r\nmay be dishonored, from a wish to render it more absolute. But in\r\nmost free countries, in which the majority can never exercise the same\r\ninfluence upon the tribunals as an absolute monarch, the judicial\r\npower has occasionally been vested for a time in the representatives of\r\nsociety. It has been thought better to introduce a temporary confusion\r\nbetween the functions of the different authorities, than to violate the\r\nnecessary principle of the unity of government.\r\n\r\nEngland, France, and the United States, have established this political\r\njurisdiction in their laws; and it is curious to examine the different\r\nuse which these three great nations have made of the principle. In\r\nEngland and in France the house of lords and the chambre des pairs\r\nconstitute the highest criminal court of their respective nations; and\r\nalthough they do not habitually try all political offences, they are\r\ncompetent to try them all. Another political body enjoys the right of\r\nimpeachment before the house of lords: the only difference which exists\r\nbetween the two countries in this respect is, that in England the\r\ncommons may impeach whomsoever they please before the lords, while in\r\nFrance the deputies can only employ this mode of prosecution against the\r\nministers of the crown.\r\n\r\nIn both countries the upper house make use of all the existing penal\r\nlaws of the nation to punish the delinquents.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as well as in Europe, one branch of the\r\nlegislature is authorized to impeach, and another to judge: the house\r\nof representatives arraigns the offender, and the senate awards his\r\nsentence. But the senate can only try such persons as are brought before\r\nit by the house of representatives, and those persons must belong to the\r\nclass of public functionaries. Thus the jurisdiction of the senate is\r\nless extensive than that of the peers of France, while the right of\r\nimpeachment by the representatives is more general than that of the\r\ndeputies. But the great difference which exists between Europe and\r\nAmerica is, that in Europe political tribunals are empowered to inflict\r\nall the dispositions of the penal code, while in America, when they\r\nhave deprived the offender of his official rank, and have declared\r\nhim incapable of filling any political office for the future, their\r\njurisdiction terminates and that of the ordinary tribunals begins.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that the president of the United States has\r\ncommitted the crime of high treason; the house of representatives\r\nimpeaches him, and the senate degrades him; he must then be tried by\r\na jury, which alone can deprive him of his liberty or his life. This\r\naccurately illustrates the subject we are treating. The political\r\njurisdiction which is established by the laws of Europe is intended to\r\ntry great offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or their\r\npowers in the state; and to this end all the privileges of the courts\r\nof justice are temporarily extended to a great political assembly. The\r\nlegislator is then transformed into a magistrate: he is called upon to\r\nadmit, to distinguish, and to punish the offence; and as he exercises\r\nall the authority of a judge, the law restricts him to the observance\r\nof all the duties of that high office, and of all the formalities of\r\njustice. When a public functionary is impeached before an English or a\r\nFrench political tribunal, and is found guilty, the sentence deprives\r\nhim _ipso facto_ of his functions, and it may pronounce him to be\r\nincapable of resuming them or any others for the future. But in this\r\ncase the political interdict is a consequence of the sentence, and not\r\nthe sentence itself. In Europe the sentence of a political tribunal\r\nis therefore to be regarded as a judicial verdict, rather than as an\r\nadministrative measure. In the United States the contrary takes place;\r\nand although the decision of the senate is judicial in its form, since\r\nthe senators are obliged to comply with the practices and formalities of\r\na court of justice; although it is judicial in respect to the motives on\r\nwhich it is founded, since the senate is in general obliged to take an\r\noffence at common law as the basis of its sentence; nevertheless the\r\nobject of the proceeding is purely administrative.\r\n\r\nIf it had been the intention of the American legislator to invest a\r\npolitical body with great judicial authority, its action would not\r\nhave been limited to the circle of public functionaries, since the most\r\ndangerous enemies of the state may be in the possession of no functions\r\nat all; and this is especially true in republics, where party favor is\r\nthe first of authorities, and where the strength of many a leader is\r\nincreased by his exercising no legal power. If it had been the intention\r\nof the American legislator to give society the means of repressing state\r\noffences by exemplary punishment, according to the practice of ordinary\r\njudgment, the resources of the penal code would all have been placed at\r\nthe disposal of the political tribunals. But the weapon with which\r\nthey are intrusted is an imperfect one, and it can never reach the most\r\ndangerous offenders; since men who aim at the entire subversion of the\r\nlaws are not likely to murmur at a political interdict.\r\n\r\nThe main object of the political jurisdiction which obtains in the\r\nUnited States is, therefore, to deprive the citizen of an authority\r\nwhich he has used amiss, and to prevent him from ever acquiring it\r\nagain. This is evidently an administrative measure sanctioned by the\r\nformalities of judicial investigation. In this matter the Americans have\r\ncreated a mixed system: they have surrounded the act which removes a\r\npublic functionary with the securities of a political trial; and they\r\nhave deprived all political condemnations of their severest penalties.\r\nEvery link of the system may easily be traced from this point; we at\r\nonce perceive why the American constitutions subject all the civil\r\nfunctionaries to the jurisdiction of the senate, while the military,\r\nwhose crimes are nevertheless more formidable, are exempt from that\r\ntribunal. In the civil service none of the American functionaries can\r\nbe said to be removeable; the places which some of them occupy are\r\ninalienable, and the others derive their rights from a power which\r\ncannot be abrogated. It is therefore necessary to try them all in order\r\nto deprive them of their authority. But military officers are\r\ndependent on the chief magistrate of the state, who is himself a civil\r\nfunctionary; and the decision which condemns him is a blow upon them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIf we now compare the American and European systems, we shall meet with\r\ndifferences no less striking in the different effects which each of them\r\nproduces or may produce. In France and in England the jurisdiction of\r\npolitical bodies is looked upon as an extraordinary resource, which is\r\nonly to be employed in order to rescue society from unwonted dangers.\r\nIt is not to be denied that these tribunals, as they are constituted in\r\nEurope, are apt to violate the conservative principle of the balance of\r\npower in the state, and to threaten incessantly the lives and liberties\r\nof the subject. The same political jurisdiction in the United States is\r\nonly indirectly hostile to the balance of power; it cannot menace the\r\nlives of the citizens, and it does not hover, as in Europe, over the\r\nheads of the community, since those only who have before-hand submitted\r\nto its authority upon accepting office are exposed to its severity. It\r\nis at the same time less formidable and less efficacious; indeed, it has\r\nnot been considered by the legislators of the United States as a remedy\r\nfor the more violent evils of society, but as an ordinary means of\r\nconducting the government. In this respect it probably exercises more\r\nreal influence on the social body in America than in Europe. We must not\r\nbe misled by the apparent mildness of the American Legislation in all\r\nthat relates to political jurisdiction. It is to be observed, in\r\nthe first place, that in the United States the tribunal which passes\r\nsentence is composed of the same elements, and subject to the same\r\ninfluences, as the body which impeaches the offender, and that this\r\nuniformity gives an almost irresistible impulse to the vindictive\r\npassions of parties. If political judges in the United States cannot\r\ninflict such heavy penalties as those of Europe, there is the less\r\nchance of their acquitting a prisoner; and the conviction, if it is\r\nless formidable, is more certain. The principal object of the political\r\ntribunals of Europe is to punish the offender; the purpose of those in\r\nAmerica is to deprive him of his authority. A political condemnation\r\nin the United States may, therefore, be looked upon as a preventive\r\nmeasure; and there is no reason for restricting the judges to the exact\r\ndefinitions of criminal law. Nothing can be more alarming than the\r\nexcessive latitude with which political offences are described in the\r\nlaws of America. Article II., section iv., of the constitution of the\r\nUnited States runs thus: \"The president, vice-president, and all the\r\ncivil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on\r\nimpeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, _or other high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors_.\" Many of the constitutions of the states\r\nare even less explicit. \"Public officers,\" says the constitution\r\nof Massachusetts,[116] \"shall be impeached for misconduct or\r\nmal-administration.\" The constitution of Virginia declares that all\r\nthe civil officers who shall have offended against the state by\r\nmal-administration, corruption, or other high crimes, may be impeached\r\nby the house of delegates: in some constitutions no offences are\r\nspecified, in order to subject the public functionaries to an unlimited\r\nresponsibility.[117] But I will venture to affirm, that it is precisely\r\ntheir mildness which renders the American laws most formidable in this\r\nrespect. We have shown that in Europe the removal of a functionary and\r\nhis political interdiction are consequences of the penalty he is to\r\nundergo, and that in America they constitute the penalty itself. The\r\nresult is, that in Europe political tribunals are invested with rights\r\nwhich they are afraid to use, and that the fear of punishing too much\r\nhinders them from punishing at all. But in America no one hesitates\r\nto inflict a penalty from which humanity does not recoil. To condemn a\r\npolitical opponent to death, in order to deprive him of his power, is\r\nto commit what all the world would execrate as a horrible assassination;\r\nbut to declare that opponent unworthy to exercise that authority, to\r\ndeprive him of it, and to leave him uninjured in life and liberty, may\r\nappear to be the fair issue of the struggle. But this sentence, which is\r\nso easy to pronounce, is not the less fatally severe to the majority of\r\nthose upon whom it is inflicted. Great criminals may undoubtedly\r\nbrave its intangible rigor, but ordinary offenders will dread it as a\r\ncondemnation which destroys their position in the world, casts a blight\r\nupon their honor, and condemns them to a shameful inactivity worse than\r\ndeath. The influence exercised in the United States upon the progress\r\nof society by the jurisdiction of political bodies may not appear to be\r\nformidable, but it is only the more immense. It does not act directly\r\nupon the governed, but it renders the majority more absolute over those\r\nwho govern; it does not confer an unbounded authority on the legislator\r\nwhich can only be exerted at some momentous crisis, but it establishes a\r\ntemperate and regular influence, which is at all times available. If\r\nthe power is decreased, it can, on the other hand, be more conveniently\r\nemployed, and more easily abused. By preventing political tribunals from\r\ninflicting judicial punishments, the Americans seem to have eluded the\r\nworst consequences of legislative tyranny, rather than tyranny itself;\r\nand I am not sure that political jurisdiction, as it is constituted in\r\nthe United States, is not the most formidable which has ever been placed\r\nin the rude grasp of a popular majority. When the American republics\r\nbegin to degenerate, it will be easy to verify the truth of this\r\nobservation, by remarking whether the number of political impeachments\r\naugments.[118]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[116] Chapter I., sect. ii., § 8.\r\n\r\n[117] See the constitutions of Illinois, Maine, Connecticut, and\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n[118] See Appendix N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have hitherto considered each state as a separate whole, and I have\r\nexplained the different springs which the people sets in motion, and the\r\ndifferent means of action which it employs. But all the states which I\r\nhave considered as independent are forced to submit, in certain cases,\r\nto the supreme authority of the Union. The time is now come for me to\r\nexamine the partial sovereignty which has been conceded to the Union,\r\nand to cast a rapid glance over the federal constitution.[119]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nOrigin of the first Union.--Its Weakness.--Congress appeals to the\r\nconstituent Authority.--Interval of two Years between the Appeal and the\r\nPromulgation of the new Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the yoke of\r\nEngland toward the end of the last century, possessed, as I have already\r\nobserved, the same religion, the same language, the same customs, and\r\nalmost the same laws; they were struggling against a common enemy; and\r\nthese reasons were sufficiently strong to unite them one to another, and\r\nto consolidate them into one nation. But as each of them had enjoyed\r\na separate existence, and a government within its own control, the\r\npeculiar interests and customs which resulted from this system, were\r\nopposed to a compact and intimate union, which would have absorbed the\r\nindividual importance of each in the general importance of all. Hence\r\narose two opposite tendencies, the one prompting the Anglo-Americans to\r\nunite, the other to divide their strength. As long as the war with\r\nthe mother-country lasted, the principle of union was kept alive by\r\nnecessity; and although the laws which constituted it were defective,\r\nthe common tie subsisted in spite of their imperfections.[120] But no\r\nsooner was peace concluded than the faults of the legislation became\r\nmanifest, and the state seemed to be suddenly dissolved. Each colony\r\nbecame an independent republic, and assumed an absolute sovereignty. The\r\nfederal government, condemned to impotence by its constitution, and no\r\nlonger sustained by the presence of a common danger, saw the outrages\r\noffered to its flag by the great nations of Europe, while it was\r\nscarcely able to maintain its ground against the Indian tribes, and to\r\npay the interest of the debt which had been contracted during the war\r\nof independence. It was already on the verge of destruction, when it\r\nofficially proclaimed its inability to conduct the government, and\r\nappealed to the constituent authority of the nation.[121]\r\n\r\nIf America ever approached (for however brief a time) that lofty\r\npinnacle of glory to which the proud fancy of its inhabitants is wont\r\nto point, it was at the solemn moment at which the power of the nation\r\nabdicated, as it were, the empire of the land. All ages have\r\nfurnished the spectacle of a people struggling with energy to win its\r\nindependence; and the efforts of the Americans in throwing off the\r\nEnglish yoke have been considerably exaggerated. Separated from their\r\nenemies by three thousand miles of ocean, and backed by a powerful ally,\r\nthe success of the United States may be more justly attributed to\r\ntheir geographical position, than to the valor of their armies or the\r\npatriotism of their citizens. It would be ridiculous to compare the\r\nAmerican war to the wars of the French revolution, or the efforts of the\r\nAmericans to those of the French, who, when they were attacked by the\r\nwhole of Europe, without credit and without allies, were still capable\r\nof opposing a twentieth part of their population to their foes, and\r\nof bearing the torch of revolution beyond their frontiers while they\r\nstifled its devouring flame within the bosom of their country. But it\r\nis a novelty in the history of society to see a great people turn a calm\r\nand scrutinizing eye upon itself when apprised by the legislature that\r\nthe wheels of government had stopped; to see it carefully examine the\r\nextent of the evil, and patiently wait for two whole years until a\r\nremedy was discovered, which it voluntarily adopted without having wrung\r\na tear or a drop of blood from mankind. At the time when the inadequacy\r\nof the first constitution was discovered, America possessed the double\r\nadvantage of that calm which had succeeded the effervescence of the\r\nrevolution, and of those great men who had led the revolution to a\r\nsuccessful issue. The assembly which accepted the task of composing\r\nthe second constitution was small;[122] but George Washington was its\r\npresident, and it contained the choicest talents and the noblest hearts\r\nwhich had ever appeared in the New World. This national commission,\r\nafter long and mature deliberation, offered to the acceptance of the\r\npeople the body of general laws which still rules the Union. All\r\nthe states adopted it successively.[123] The new federal government\r\ncommenced its functions in 1789, after an interregnum of two years. The\r\nrevolution of America terminated when that of France began.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nDivision of Authority between the Federal Government and the\r\nStates.--The Government of the States is the Rule: the Federal\r\nGovernment the Exception.\r\n\r\nThe first question which awaited the Americans was intricate, and by no\r\nmeans easy of solution; the object was so to divide the authority of\r\nthe different states which composed the Union, that each of them should\r\ncontinue to govern itself in all that concerned its internal prosperity,\r\nwhile the entire nation, represented by the Union, should continue to\r\nform a compact body, and to provide for the exigencies of the people. It\r\nwas as impossible to determine beforehand, with any degree of accuracy,\r\nthe share of authority which each of the two governments was to enjoy,\r\nas to foresee all the incidents in the existence of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe obligations and the claims of the federal government were simple\r\nand easily definable, because the Union had been formed with the express\r\npurpose of meeting the general exigencies of the people; but the claims\r\nand obligations of the states were, on the other hand, complicated and\r\nvarious, because those governments penetrated into all the details of\r\nsocial life. The attributes of the federal government were, therefore,\r\ncarefully enumerated, and all that was not included among them\r\nwas declared to constitute a part of the privileges of the several\r\ngovernments of the states. Thus the government of the states remained\r\nthe rule, and that of the confederation became the exception.[124]\r\n\r\nBut as it was foreseen, that, in practice, questions might arise as to\r\nthe exact limits of this exceptional authority, and that it would be\r\ndangerous to submit these questions to the decision of the ordinary\r\ncourts of justice, established in the states by the states themselves,\r\na high federal court was created,[125] which was destined, among other\r\nfunctions, to maintain the balance of power which had been established\r\nby the constitution between the two rival governments.[126]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPREROGATIVE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nPower of declaring War, making Peace, and levying general Taxes vested\r\nin the Federal Government.--What Part of the internal Policy of the\r\nCountry it may direct.--The Government of the Union in some respects\r\nmore central than the King's Government in the old French monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe external relations of a people may be compared to those of private\r\nindividuals, and they cannot be advantageously maintained without the\r\nagency of the single head of a government. The exclusive right of making\r\npeace and war, of concluding treaties of commerce, of raising armies,\r\nand equipping fleets, was therefore granted to the Union.[127] The\r\nnecessity of a national government was less imperiously felt in the\r\nconduct of the internal affairs of society; but there are certain\r\ngeneral interests which can only be attended to with advantage by a\r\ngeneral authority. The Union was invested with the power of controlling\r\nthe monetary system, of directing the post-office, and of opening the\r\ngreat roads which were to establish communication between the different\r\nparts of the country.[128] The independence of the government of each\r\nstate was formally recognized in its sphere; nevertheless the federal\r\ngovernment was authorized to interfere in the internal affairs of the\r\nstates[129] in a few predetermined cases, in which an indiscreet abuse\r\nof their independence might compromise the security of the Union at\r\nlarge. Thus, while the power of modifying and changing their legislation\r\nat pleasure was preserved in all the republics, they were forbidden\r\nto enact _ex post facto_ laws, or to create a class of nobles in their\r\ncommunity.[130] Lastly, as it was necessary that the federal government\r\nshould be able to fulfil its engagements, it was endowed with an\r\nunlimited power of levying taxes.[131]\r\n\r\nIn examining the balance of power as established by the federal\r\nconstitution; in remarking on the one hand the portion of sovereignty\r\nwhich has been reserved to the several states, and on the other the\r\nshare of power which the Union has assumed, it is evident that the\r\nfederal legislators entertained the clearest and most accurate notions\r\non the nature of the centralisation of government. The United States\r\nform not only a republic, but a confederation; nevertheless the\r\nauthority of the nation is more central than it was in several of the\r\nmonarchies of Europe when the American constitution was formed. Take,\r\nfor instance, the two following examples:--\r\n\r\nThirteen supreme courts of justice existed in France, which, generally\r\nspeaking, had the right of interpreting the law without appeal; and\r\nthose provinces, styled _pays d'etats_, were authorized to refuse\r\ntheir assent to an impost which had been levied by the sovereign who\r\nrepresented the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the Union there is but one tribunal to interpret, as there is one\r\nlegislature to make the laws; and an impost voted by the representatives\r\nof the nation is binding upon all the citizens.\r\n\r\nIn these two essential points, therefore, the Union exercises more\r\ncentral authority than the French monarchy possessed, although the Union\r\nis only an assemblage of confederate republics.\r\n\r\nIn Spain certain provinces had the right of establishing a system of\r\ncustomhouse duties peculiar to themselves, although that privilege\r\nbelongs, by its very nature, to the national sovereignty. In America the\r\ncongress alone has the right of regulating the commercial relations\r\nof the states. The government of the confederation is therefore more\r\ncentralized in this respect than the kingdom of Spain. It is true that\r\nthe power of the crown in France or in Spain was always able to obtain\r\nby force whatever the constitution of the country denied, and that the\r\nultimate result was consequently the same; and I am here discussing the\r\ntheory of the constitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEDERAL POWERS.\r\n\r\nAfter having settled the limits within which the federal government\r\nwas to act, the next point was to determine the powers which it was to\r\nexert.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE POWERS.\r\n\r\nDivision of the legislative Body into two Branches.--Difference in the\r\nManner of forming the two Houses.--The Principle of the Independence of\r\nthe States predominates in the Formation of the Senate.--The Principle\r\nof the Sovereignty of the Nation in the Composition of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.--Singular Effects of the Fact that a Constitution can\r\nonly be Logical in the early Stages of a Nation.\r\n\r\nThe plan which had been laid down beforehand for the constitution of the\r\nseveral states was followed, in many points, in the organization of the\r\npowers of the Union. The federal legislature of the Union was composed\r\nof a senate and a house of Representatives. A spirit of conciliation\r\nprescribed the observance of distinct principles in the formation of\r\neach of these two assemblies. I have already shown that two contrary\r\ninterests were opposed to each other in the establishment of the federal\r\nconstitution. These two interests had given rise to two opinions. It was\r\nthe wish of one party to convert the Union into a league of independent\r\nstates, or a sort of congress, at which the representatives of the\r\nseveral peoples would meet to discuss certain points of their common\r\ninterests. The other party desired to unite the inhabitants of the\r\nAmerican colonies into one sole nation, and to establish a government,\r\nwhich should act as the sole representative of the nation, as far as the\r\nlimited sphere of its authority would permit. The practical consequences\r\nof these two theories were exceedingly different.\r\n\r\nThe question was, whether a league was to be established instead of a\r\nnational government; whether the majority of the states, instead of a\r\nmajority of the inhabitants of the Union, was to give the law; for every\r\nstate, the small as well as the great, then retained the character of\r\nan independent power, and entered the Union upon a footing of perfect\r\nequality. If, on the contrary, the inhabitants of the United States were\r\nto be considered as belonging to one and the same nation, it was natural\r\nthat the majority of the citizens of the Union should prescribe the law.\r\nOf course the lesser states could not subscribe to the application of\r\nthis doctrine without, in fact, abdicating their existence in relation\r\nto the sovereignty of the confederation; since they would have passed\r\nfrom the condition of a co-equal and co-legislative authority, to that\r\nof an insignificant fraction of a great people. The former system would\r\nhave invested them with an excessive authority, the latter would have\r\nannulled their influence altogether. Under these circumstances, the\r\nresult was, that the strict rules of logic were evaded, as is usually\r\nthe case when interests are opposed to arguments. A middle course was\r\nhit upon by the legislators, which brought together by force two systems\r\ntheoretically irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the independence of the states prevailed in the\r\nformation of the senate, and that of the sovereignty of the nation\r\npredominated in the composition of the house of representatives. It\r\nwas decided that each state should send two senators to congress, and\r\na number of representatives proportioned to its population.[132] It\r\nresults from this arrangement that the state of New York has at the\r\npresent day forty representatives, and only two senators; the state of\r\nDelaware has two senators, and only one representative; the state of\r\nDelaware is therefore equal to the state of New York in the senate,\r\nwhile the latter has forty times the influence of the former in\r\nthe house of representatives. Thus, if the minority of the nation\r\npreponderates in the senate, it may paralyze the decisions of the\r\nmajority represented in the other house, which is contrary to the spirit\r\nof constitutional government.\r\n\r\nThe facts show how rare and how difficult it is rationally and logically\r\nto combine all the several parts of legislation. In the course of time\r\ndifferent interests arise, and different principles are sanctioned by\r\nthe same people; and when a general constitution is to be established,\r\nthese interests and principles are so many natural obstacles to the\r\nrigorous application of any political system, with all its consequences.\r\nThe early stages of national existence are the only periods at which it\r\nis possible to maintain the complete logic of legislation; and when we\r\nperceive a nation in the enjoyment of this advantage, before we hasten\r\nto conclude that it is wise, we should do well to remember that it\r\nis young. When the federal constitution was formed, the interest of\r\nindependence for the separate states, and the interest of union for\r\nthe whole people, were the only two conflicting interests which existed\r\namong the Anglo-Americans; and a compromise was necessarily made between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, just to acknowledge that this part of the constitution\r\nhas not hitherto produced those evils which might have been feared. All\r\nthe states are young and contiguous; their customs, their ideas, and\r\ntheir wants, are not dissimilar; and the differences which result from\r\ntheir size or inferiority do not suffice to set their interests at\r\nvariance. The small states have consequently never been induced to\r\nleague themselves together in the senate to oppose the designs of the\r\nlarger ones; and indeed there is so irresistible an authority in the\r\nlegitimate expression of the will of a people, that the senate could\r\noffer but a feeble opposition to the vote of the majority of the house\r\nof representatives.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was not in the\r\npower of the American legislators to reduce to a single nation the\r\npeople for whom they were making laws. The object of the federal\r\nconstitution was not to destroy the independence of the states, but\r\nto restrain it. By acknowledging the real authority of these secondary\r\ncommunities (and it was impossible to deprive them of it), they\r\ndisavowed beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing the\r\ndecisions of the majority. Upon this principle the introduction of the\r\ninfluence of the states into the mechanism of the federal government was\r\nby no means to be wondered at; since it only attested the existence\r\nof an acknowledged power, which was to be humored, and not forcibly\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA FARTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nThe Senate named by the provincial Legislature--the Representatives,\r\nby the People.--Double Election of the Former--Single Election of the\r\nLatter.--Term of the different Offices.--Peculiar Functions of each\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe senate not only differs from the other house in the principle which\r\nit represents, but also in the mode of its election, in the term for\r\nwhich it is chosen, and in the nature of its functions. The house of\r\nrepresentatives is named by the people, the senate by the legislators of\r\neach state; the former is directly elected; the latter is elected by an\r\nelected body; the term for which the representatives are chosen is only\r\ntwo years, that of the senators is six. The functions of the house of\r\nrepresentatives are purely legislative, and the only share it takes in\r\nthe judicial power is in the impeachment of public officers. The senate\r\nco-operates in the work of legislation, and tries those political\r\noffences which the house of representatives submits to its decision.\r\nIt also acts as the great executive council of the nation; the treaties\r\nwhich are concluded by the president must be ratified by the senate; and\r\nthe appointments he may make must be definitively approved by the same\r\nbody.[133]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE POWER.[134]\r\n\r\nDependence of the President--He is Elective and Responsible.--He is\r\nFree to act in his own Sphere under the Inspection, but not under\r\nthe Direction, of the Senate.--His Salary fixed at his Entry into\r\nOffice.--Suspensive Veto.\r\n\r\nThe American legislators undertook a difficult task in attempting to\r\ncreate an executive power dependent on the majority of the people and\r\nnevertheless sufficiently strong to act without restraint in its own\r\nsphere. It was indispensable to the maintenance of the republican form\r\nof government that the representatives of the executive power should be\r\nsubject to the will of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe president is an elective magistrate. His honor, his property, his\r\nliberty, and his life, are the securities which the people has for the\r\ntemperate use of his power. But in the exercise of his authority he\r\ncannot be said to be perfectly independent; the senate takes cognizance\r\nof his relations with foreign powers, and of the distribution of public\r\nappointments, so that he can neither be bribed, nor can he employ the\r\nmeans of corruption. The legislators of the Union acknowledged that the\r\nexecutive power would be incompetent to fulfill its task with dignity\r\nand utility, unless it enjoyed a greater degree of stability and of\r\nstrength than had been granted to it in the separate states.\r\n\r\nThe president is chosen for four years, and he may be re-elected; so\r\nthat the chances of a prolonged administration may inspire him with\r\nhopeful undertakings for the public good, and with the means of carrying\r\nthem into execution. The president was made the sole representative of\r\nthe executive power of the Union; and care was taken not to render his\r\ndecisions subordinate to the vote of a council--a dangerous measure,\r\nwhich tends at the same time to clog the action of the government and\r\nto diminish its responsibility. The senate has the right of annulling\r\ncertain acts of the president; but it cannot compel him to take any\r\nsteps, nor does it participate in the exercise of the executive power.\r\n\r\nThe action of the legislature on the executive power may be direct; and\r\nwe have just shown that the Americans carefully obviated this influence;\r\nbut it may, on the other hand, be indirect. Public assemblies which have\r\nthe power of depriving an officer of state of his salary, encroach upon\r\nhis independence; and as they are free to make the laws, it is to be\r\nfeared lest they should gradually appropriate to themselves a portion\r\nof that authority which the constitution had vested in his hands. This\r\ndependence of the executive power is one of the defects inherent in\r\nrepublican constitutions. The Americans have not been able to counteract\r\nthe tendency which legislative assemblies have to get possession of the\r\ngovernment, but they have rendered this propensity less irresistible.\r\nThe salary of the president is fixed, at the time of his entering\r\nupon office, for the whole period of his magistracy. The president is,\r\nmoreover, provided with a suspensive veto, which allows him to oppose\r\nthe passing of such laws as might destroy the portion of independence\r\nwhich the constitution awards him. The struggle between the president\r\nand the legislature must always be an unequal one, since the latter is\r\ncertain of bearing down all resistance by persevering in its plans; but\r\nthe suspensive veto forces it at least to reconsider the matter, and,\r\nif the motion be persisted in, it must then be backed by a majority of\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole house. The veto is, in fact, a sort of appeal\r\nto the people. The executive power, which, without this security, might\r\nhave been secretly oppressed, adopts this means of pleading its\r\ncause and stating its motives. But if the legislature is certain of\r\noverpowering all resistance by persevering in its plans, I reply, that\r\nin the constitutions of all nations, of whatever kind they may be, a\r\ncertain point exists at which the legislator is obliged to have recourse\r\nto the good sense and the virtue of his fellow-citizens. This point\r\nis more prominent and more discoverable in republics, while it is more\r\nremote and more carefully concealed in monarchies, but it always exists\r\nsomewhere. There is no country in the world in which everything can be\r\nprovided for by the laws, or in which political institutions can prove a\r\nsubstitute for common sense and public morality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nAND THAT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL KING OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nExecutive Power in the United States as Limited and as Partial as the\r\nSupremacy which it Represents.--Executive Power in France as\r\nUniversal as the Supremacy it Represents.--The King a Branch of the\r\nLegislature.--The President the mere Executor of the Law.--Other\r\nDifferences resulting from the Duration of the two Powers.--The\r\nPresident checked in the Exercise of the executive Authority.--The\r\nKing Independent in its Exercise.--Notwithstanding these\r\nDiscrepancies, France is more akin to a Republic than the Union to a\r\nMonarchy.--Comparison of the Number of public Officers depending upon\r\nthe executive Power in the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe executive power has so important an influence on the destinies of\r\nnations that I am inclined to pause for an instant at this portion of\r\nmy subject, in order more clearly to explain the part it sustains\r\nin America. In order to form an accurate idea of the position of the\r\npresident of the United States, it may not be irrelevant to compare it\r\nto that of one of the constitutional kings of Europe. In this comparison\r\nI shall pay but little attention to the external signs of power, which\r\nare more apt to deceive the eye of the observer than to guide his\r\nresearches. When a monarchy is being gradually transformed into a\r\nrepublic, the executive power retains the titles, the honors, the\r\netiquette, and even the funds of royalty, long after its authority has\r\ndisappeared. The English, after having cut off the head of one king,\r\nand expelled another from his throne, were accustomed to accost the\r\nsuccessors of those princes upon their knees. On the other hand, when\r\na republic falls under the sway of a single individual, the demeanor of\r\nthe sovereign is simple and unpretending, as if his authority was not\r\nyet paramount. When the emperors exercised an unlimited control over\r\nthe fortunes and the lives of their fellow-citizens, it was customary to\r\ncall them Caesar in conversation, and they were in the habit of supping\r\nwithout formality at their friends' houses. It is therefore necessary to\r\nlook below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty of the United States is shared between the Union and the\r\nstates, while in France it is undivided and compact: hence arises the\r\nfirst and the most notable difference which exists between the president\r\nof the United States and the king of France. In the United States the\r\nexecutive power is as limited and partial as the sovereignty of the\r\nUnion in whose name it acts; in France it is as universal as the\r\nauthority of the state. The Americans have a federal, and the French a\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nThe first cause of inferiority results from the nature of things, but it\r\nis not the only one; the second in importance is as follows: sovereignty\r\nmay be defined to be the right of making laws: in France, the king\r\nreally exercises a portion of the sovereign power, since the laws have\r\nno weight till he has given his assent to them; he is moreover the\r\nexecutor of all they ordain. The president is also the executor of the\r\nlaws, but he does not really co-operate in their formation, since the\r\nrefusal of his assent does not annul them. He is therefore merely to be\r\nconsidered as the agent of the sovereign power. But not only does\r\nthe king of France exercise a portion of the sovereign power, he also\r\ncontributes to the nomination of the legislature, which exercises the\r\nother portion. He has the privilege of appointing the members of one\r\nchamber, and of dissolving the other at his pleasure; whereas the\r\npresident of the United States has no share in the formation of the\r\nlegislative body, and cannot dissolve any part of it. The king has the\r\nsame right of bringing forward measures as the chambers; a right which\r\nthe president does not possess. The king is represented in each assembly\r\nby his ministers, who explain his intentions, support his opinions,\r\nand maintain the principles of the government. The president and his\r\nministers are alike excluded from congress; so that his influence and\r\nhis opinions can only penetrate indirectly into that great body. The\r\nking of France is therefore on an equal footing with the legislature,\r\nwhich can no more act without him, than he can without it. The president\r\nexercises an authority inferior to, and depending upon, that of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nEven in the exercise of the executive power, properly so called, the\r\npoint upon which his position seems to be almost analogous to that\r\nof the king of France--the president labors under several causes of\r\ninferiority. The authority of the king, in France, has, in the first\r\nplace, the advantage of duration over that of the president: and\r\ndurability is one of the chief elements of strength; nothing is either\r\nloved or feared but what is likely to endure. The president of the\r\nUnited States is a magistrate elected for four years. The king, in\r\nFrance, is an hereditary sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the executive power the president of the United\r\nStates is constantly subject to jealous scrutiny. He may make, but he\r\ncannot conclude a treaty; he may designate, but he cannot appoint, a\r\npublic officer.[135] The king of France is absolute in the sphere of the\r\nexecutive power.\r\n\r\nThe president of the United States is responsible for his actions; but\r\nthe person of the king is declared inviolable by the French charter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the supremacy of public opinion is no less above the head\r\nof one than of the other. This power is less definite, less evident,\r\nand less sanctioned by the laws in France than in America, but in\r\nfact exists. In America it acts by elections and decrees; in France it\r\nproceeds by revolutions; but notwithstanding the different constitutions\r\nof these two countries, public opinion is the predominant authority\r\nin both of them. The fundamental principle of legislation--a principle\r\nessentially republican--is the same in both countries, although its\r\nconsequences may be different, and its results more or less extensive.\r\nWhence I am led to conclude, that France with its king is nearer akin to\r\na republic, than the Union with its president is to a monarchy.\r\n\r\nIn what I have been saying I have only touched upon the main points\r\nof distinction; and if I could have entered into details, the contrast\r\nwould have been rendered still more striking.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the authority of the president in the United States\r\nis only exercised within the limits of a partial sovereignty, while that\r\nof the king, in France, is undivided. I might have gone on to show that\r\nthe power of the king's government in France exceeds its natural limits,\r\nhowever extensive they may be, and penetrates in a thousand different\r\nways into the administration of private interests. Among the examples of\r\nthis influence may be quoted that which results from the great number\r\nof public functionaries, who all derive their appointments from the\r\ngovernment. This number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to\r\n138,000[136] nominations, each of which may be considered as an element\r\nof power. The president of the United States has not the exclusive\r\nright of making any public appointments, and their whole number scarcely\r\nexceeds 12,000.[137]\r\n\r\n[Those who are desirous of tracing the question respecting the power\r\nof the president to remove every executive officer of the government\r\nwithout the sanction of the senate, will find some light upon it by\r\nreferring to 5th Marshall's Life of Washington, p. 196: 5 Sergeant and\r\nRawle's Reports (Pennsylvania), 451: Elliot's Debates on the Federal\r\nConstitution, vol iv., p. 355, contains the debate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, June 16, 1799, when the question was first mooted:\r\nReport of a committee of the senate in 1822, in Niles's Register of 29th\r\nAugust in that year. It is certainly very extraordinary that such a vast\r\npower, and one so extensively affecting the whole administration of the\r\ngovernment, should rest on such slight foundations, as an _inference_\r\nfrom an act of congress, providing that when the secretary of the\r\ntreasury should be removed by the president, his assistant should\r\ndischarge the duties of the office. How congress could confer the\r\npower, even by a direct act, is not perceived. It must be a necessary\r\nimplication from the words of the constitution, or it does not exist.\r\nIt has been repeatedly denied in and out of congress, and must be\r\nconsidered, as yet, an unsettled question.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL CAUSES WHICH MAY INCREASE THE INFLUENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\nExternal security of the Union.--Army of six thousand Men.--Few\r\nShips.--The President has no Opportunity of exercising his great\r\nPrerogatives.--In the Prerogatives he exercises he is weak.\r\n\r\nIf the executive power is feebler in America than in France, the cause\r\nis more attributable to the circumstances than to the laws of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly in its foreign relations that the executive power of a\r\nnation is called upon to exert its skill and vigor. If the existence of\r\nthe Union were perpetually threatened, and its chief interest were in\r\ndaily connexion with those of other powerful nations, the executive\r\ngovernment would assume an increased importance in proportion to the\r\nmeasures expected of it, and those which it would carry into effect. The\r\npresident of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the army,\r\nbut of an army composed of only six thousand men; he commands the fleet,\r\nbut the fleet reckons but few sail; he conducts the foreign relations\r\nof the Union, but the United States are a nation without neighbors.\r\nSeparated from the rest of the world by the ocean, and too weak as yet\r\nto aim at the dominion of the seas, they have no enemies, and their\r\ninterests rarely come into contact with those of any other nation of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe practical part of a government must not be judged by the theory\r\nof its constitution. The president of the United States is in the\r\npossession of almost royal prerogatives, which he has no opportunity of\r\nexercising; and those privileges which he can at present use are very\r\ncircumscribed: the laws allow him to possess a degree of influence which\r\ncircumstances do not permit him to employ.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the great strength of the royal prerogative in\r\nFrance arises from circumstances far more than from the laws. There\r\nthe executive government is constantly struggling against prodigious\r\nobstacles, and exerting all its energies to repress them; so that it\r\nincreases by the extent of its achievements, and by the importance\r\nof the events it controls, without, for that reason, modifying its\r\nconstitution. If the laws had made it as feeble and as circumscribed as\r\nit is in the Union, its influence would very soon become much greater.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT REQUIRE THE MAJORITY OF\r\nTHE TWO HOUSES IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nIt is an established axiom in Europe that a constitutional king cannot\r\npersevere in a system of government which is opposed by the two other\r\nbranches of the legislature. But several presidents of the United States\r\nhave been known to lose the majority in the legislative body, without\r\nbeing obliged to abandon the supreme power, and without inflicting a\r\nserious evil upon society. I have heard this fact quoted as an instance\r\nof the independence and power of executive government in America: a\r\nmoment's reflection will convince us, on the contrary, that it is a\r\nproof of its extreme weakness.\r\n\r\nA king in Europe requires the support of the legislature to enable him\r\nto perform the duties imposed upon him by the constitution, because\r\nthose duties are enormous. A constitutional king in Europe is not merely\r\nthe executor of the law, but the execution of its provisions devolves so\r\ncompletely upon him, that he has the power of paralyzing its influence\r\nif it opposes his designs. He requires the assistance of the legislative\r\nassemblies to make the law, but those assemblies stand in need of his\r\naid to execute it: these two authorities cannot subsist without each\r\nother, and the mechanism of government is stopped as soon as they are at\r\nvariance.\r\n\r\nIn America the president cannot prevent any law from being passed, nor\r\ncan he evade the obligation of enforcing it. His sincere and zealous\r\nco-operation is no doubt useful, but it is not indispensable in the\r\ncarrying on of public affairs. All his important acts are directly or\r\nindirectly submitted to the legislature; and where he is independent\r\nof it he can do but little. It is therefore his weakness, and not his\r\npower, which enables him to remain in opposition to congress. In Europe,\r\nharmony must reign between the crown and the other branches of the\r\nlegislature, because a collision between them may prove serious; in\r\nAmerica, this harmony is not indispensable, because such a collision is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nDangers of the elective System increase in Proportion to the Extent of\r\nthe Prerogative.--This System possible in America because no powerful\r\nexecutive Authority is required.--What Circumstances are favorable to\r\nthe elective System.--Why the Election of the President does not cause\r\na Deviation from the Principles of the Government.--Influence of the\r\nElection of the President on secondary Functionaries.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the system of election applied to the head of the\r\nexecutive government of a great people, have been sufficiently\r\nexemplified by experience and by history; and the remarks I am about\r\nto make refer to America alone. These dangers may be more or less\r\nformidable in proportion to the place which the executive power\r\noccupies, and to the importance it possesses in the state; and they may\r\nvary according to the mode of election, and the circumstances in which\r\nthe electors are placed. The most weighty argument against the election\r\nof a chief-magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a lure to private\r\nambition, and is so apt to inflame men in the pursuit of power, that\r\nwhen legitimate means are wanting, force may not unfrequently seize what\r\nright denies.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the greater the privileges of the executive authority\r\nare, the greater is the temptation; the more the ambition of the\r\ncandidates is excited, the more warmly are their interests espoused by\r\na throng of partisans who hope to share the power when their patron has\r\nwon the prize. The dangers of the elective system increase, therefore,\r\nin the exact ratio of the influence exercised by the executive power\r\nin the affairs of state. The revolutions of Poland are not solely\r\nattributable to the elective system in general, but to the fact that the\r\nelected magistrate was the head of a powerful monarchy. Before we can\r\ndiscuss the absolute advantages of the elective system, we must make\r\npreliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the laws,\r\nthe habits, the manners, and the opinions of the people among whom it\r\nis to be introduced, will admit of the establishment of a weak\r\nand dependent executive government; for to attempt to render the\r\nrepresentative of the state a powerful sovereign, and at the same time\r\nelective, is, in my opinion, to entertain two incompatible designs. To\r\nreduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an elective authority, the\r\nonly means that I am acquainted with are to circumscribe its sphere\r\nof action beforehand, gradually to diminish its prerogatives, and to\r\naccustom the people to live without its protection. Nothing, however, is\r\nfarther from the designs of the republicans of Europe than this course:\r\nas many of them only owe their hatred of tyranny to the sufferings which\r\nthey have personally undergone, the extent of the executive power does\r\nnot excite their hostility, and they only attack its origin without\r\nperceiving how nearly the two things are connected.\r\n\r\nHitherto no citizen has shown any disposition to expose his honor and\r\nhis life, in order to become the president of the United States; because\r\nthe power of that office is temporary, limited, and subordinate. The\r\nprize of fortune must be great to encourage adventurers in so desperate\r\na game. No candidate has as yet been able to arouse the dangerous\r\nenthusiasm or the passionate sympathies of the people in his favor, for\r\nthe very simple reason, that when he is at the head of the government he\r\nhas but little power, but little wealth, and but little glory to share\r\namong his friends; and his influence in the state is too small for the\r\nsuccess or the ruin of a faction to depend upon the elevation of an\r\nindividual to power.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of hereditary monarchies is, that as the private\r\ninterest of a family is always intimately connected with the interests\r\nof the state, the executive government is never suspended for a single\r\ninstant; and if the affairs of a monarchy are not better conducted than\r\nthose of a republic, at least there is always some one to conduct them,\r\nwell or ill, according to his capacity. In elective states, on the\r\ncontrary, the wheels of government cease to act, as it were of their own\r\naccord, at the approach of an election, and even for some time previous\r\nto that event. The laws may indeed accelerate the operation of the\r\nelection, which may be conducted with such simplicity and rapidity that\r\nthe seat of power will never be left vacant; but, notwithstanding these\r\nprecautions, a break necessarily occurs in the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of an election the head of the executive government is\r\nwholly occupied by the coming struggle; his future plans are doubtful;\r\nhe can undertake nothing new, and he will only prosecute with\r\nindifference those designs which another will perhaps terminate. \"I am\r\nso near the time of my retirement from office,\" said President Jefferson\r\non the 21st of January, 1809 (six weeks before the election), \"that I\r\nfeel no passion, I take no part, I express no sentiment. It appears\r\nto me just to leave to my successor the commencement of those measures\r\nwhich he will have to prosecute, and for which he will be responsible.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the eyes of the nation are centred on a single point;\r\nall are watching the gradual birth of so important an event. The wider\r\nthe influence of the executive power extends, the greater and the\r\nmore necessary is its constant action, the more fatal is the term of\r\nsuspense; and a nation which is accustomed to the government, or, still\r\nmore, one used to the administrative protection of a powerful executive\r\nauthority, would be infallibly convulsed by an election of this kind.\r\nIn the United States the action of the government may be slackened with\r\nimpunity, because it is always weak and circumscribed.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal vices of the elective system is, that it always\r\nintroduces a certain degree of instability into the internal and\r\nexternal policy of the state. But this disadvantage is less sensibly\r\nfelt if the share of power vested in the elected magistrate is small. In\r\nRome the principles of the government underwent no variation, although\r\nthe consuls were changed every year, because the senate, which was an\r\nhereditary assembly, possessed the directing authority. If the elective\r\nsystem were adopted in Europe, the condition of most of the monarchical\r\nstates would be changed at every new election. In America the president\r\nexercises a certain influence on state affairs, but he does not conduct\r\nthem; the preponderating power is vested in the representatives of the\r\nwhole nation. The political maxims of the country depend therefore on\r\nthe mass of the people, not on the president alone; and consequently\r\nin America the elective system has no very prejudicial influence on the\r\nfixed principles of the government. But the want of fixed principles is\r\nan evil so inherent in the elective system, that it is still extremely\r\nperceptible in the narrow sphere to which the authority of the president\r\nextends.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have admitted that the head of the executive power, who\r\nhas to bear the whole responsibility of the duties he is called upon to\r\nfulfil, ought to be empowered to choose his own agents, and to remove\r\nthem at pleasure: the legislative bodies watch the conduct of the\r\npresident more than they direct it. The consequence of this arrangement\r\nis, that at every new election the fate of all the federal public\r\nofficers is in suspense. Mr. Quincy Adams, on his entry into office,\r\ndischarged the majority of the individuals who had been appointed by his\r\npredecessor; and I am not aware that General Jackson allowed a single\r\nremoveable functionary employed in the federal service to retain\r\nhis place beyond the first year which succeeded his election. It is\r\nsometimes made a subject of complaint, that in the constitutional\r\nmonarchies of Europe the fate of the humbler servants of an\r\nadministration depends upon that of the ministers. But in elective\r\ngovernments this evil is far greater. In a constitutional monarchy\r\nsuccessive ministers are rapidly formed; but as the principal\r\nrepresentative of the executive power does not change, the spirit of\r\ninnovation is kept within bounds; the changes which take place are in\r\nthe details rather than in the principles of the administrative system;\r\nbut to substitute one system for another, as is done in America\r\nevery four years by law, is to cause a sort of revolution. As to the\r\nmisfortunes which may fall upon individuals in consequence of this state\r\nof things, it must be allowed that the uncertain situation of the\r\npublic officers is less fraught with evil consequences in America than\r\nelsewhere. It is so easy to acquire an independent position in the\r\nUnited States, that the public officer who loses his place may be\r\ndeprived of the comforts of life, but not of the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nI remarked at the beginning of this chapter that the dangers of the\r\nelective system applied to the head of the state, are augmented or\r\ndecreased by the peculiar circumstances of the people which adopts it.\r\nHowever the functions of the executive power may be restricted, it\r\nmust always exercise a great influence upon the foreign policy of the\r\ncountry, for a negotiation cannot be opened or successfully carried\r\non otherwise than by a single agent. The more precarious and the more\r\nperilous the position of a people becomes, the more absolute is the want\r\nof a fixed and consistent external policy, and the more dangerous does\r\nthe elective system of the chief magistrate become. The policy of the\r\nAmericans in relation to the whole world is exceedingly simple; and it\r\nmay almost be said that no country stands in need of them, nor do they\r\nrequire the co-operation of any other people. Their independence is\r\nnever threatened. In their present condition, therefore, the functions\r\nof the executive power are no less limited by circumstances, than by the\r\nlaws; and the president may frequently change his line of policy without\r\ninvolving the state in difficulty or destruction.\r\n\r\nWhatever the prerogatives of the executive power may be, the period\r\nwhich immediately precedes an election, and the moment of its duration,\r\nmust always be considered as a national crisis, which is perilous in\r\nproportion to the internal embarrassments and the external dangers of\r\nthe country. Few of the nations of Europe could escape the calamities\r\nof anarchy or of conquest, every time they might have to elect a new\r\nsovereign. In America society is so constituted that it can stand\r\nwithout assistance upon its own basis; nothing is to be feared from the\r\npressure of external dangers; and the election of the president is a\r\ncause of agitation, but not of ruin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMODE OF ELECTION.\r\n\r\nSkill of the American Legislators shown in the Mode of Election adopted\r\nby them.--Creation of a special electoral Body.--Separate Votes of these\r\nElectors.--Case in which the House of Representatives is called upon to\r\nchoose the President.--Results of the twelve Elections which have taken\r\nPlace since the Constitution has been established.\r\n\r\nBeside the dangers which are inherent in the system, many other\r\ndifficulties may arise from the mode of election, which may be obviated\r\nby the precaution of the legislator. When a people met in arms on some\r\npublic spot to choose its head, it was exposed to all the chances of\r\ncivil war resulting from so martial a mode of proceeding, beside\r\nthe dangers of the elective system in itself. The Polish laws, which\r\nsubjected the election of the sovereign to the veto of a single\r\nindividual, suggested the murder of that individual, or prepared the way\r\nto anarchy.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the institutions, and the political as well as the\r\nsocial condition of the United States, we are struck by the admirable\r\nharmony of the gifts of fortune and the efforts of man. That nation\r\npossessed two of the main causes of internal peace; it was a new\r\ncountry, but it was inhabited by a people grown old in the exercise of\r\nfreedom. America had no hostile neighbors to dread; and the American\r\nlegislators, profiting by these favorable circumstances, created a weak\r\nand subordinate executive power, which could without danger be made\r\nelective.\r\n\r\nIt then only remained for them to choose the least dangerous of the\r\nvarious modes of election; and the rules which they laid down upon this\r\npoint admirably complete the securities which the physical and political\r\nconstitution of the country already afforded. Their object was to find\r\nthe mode of election which would best express the choice of the people\r\nwith the least possible excitement and suspense. It was admitted in\r\nthe first place that the _simple_ majority should be decisive; but the\r\ndifficulty was to obtain this majority without an interval of delay\r\nwhich it was most important to avoid. It rarely happens that an\r\nindividual can at once collect the majority of the suffrages of a great\r\npeople; and this difficulty is enhanced in a republic of confederate\r\nstates, where local influences are apt to preponderate. The means by\r\nwhich it was proposed to obviate this second obstacle was to delegate\r\nthe electoral powers of the nation to a body of representatives. The\r\nmode of election rendered a majority more probable; for the fewer the\r\nelectors are, the greater is the chance of their coming to a final\r\ndecision. It also offered an additional probability of a judicious\r\nchoice. It then remained to be decided whether this right of election\r\nwas to be intrusted to the legislative body, the habitual representative\r\nassembly of the nation, or whether an electoral assembly should be\r\nformed for the express purpose of proceeding to the nomination of a\r\npresident. The Americans chose the latter alternative, from a belief\r\nthat the individuals who were returned to make the laws were incompetent\r\nto represent the wishes of the nation in the election of its chief\r\nmagistrate; and that as they are chosen for more than a year, the\r\nconstituency they represented might have changed its opinion in that\r\ntime. It was thought that if the legislature was empowered to elect the\r\nhead of the executive power, its members would, for some time before the\r\nelection, be exposed to the manoeuvres of corruption, and the tricks of\r\nintrigue; whereas, the special electors would, like a jury, remain mixed\r\nup with the crowd till the day of action, when they would appear for the\r\nsole purpose of giving their votes.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore established that every state should name a certain\r\nnumber of electors,[138] who in their turn should elect the president;\r\nand as it had been observed that the assemblies to which the choice of\r\na chief magistrate had been intrusted in elective countries, inevitably\r\nbecame the centres of passion and of cabal; that they sometimes usurped\r\nan authority which did not belong to them: and that their proceedings,\r\nor the uncertainty which resulted from them, were sometimes prolonged so\r\nmuch as to endanger the welfare of the state, it was determined that the\r\nelectors should all vote upon the same day, without being convoked to\r\nthe same place.[139] This double election rendered a majority probable,\r\nthough not certain; for it was possible that as many differences might\r\nexist between the electors as between their constituents. In this case\r\nit was necessary to have recourse to one of three measures; either\r\nto appoint new electors, or to consult a second time those already\r\nappointed, or to defer the election to another authority. The first\r\ntwo of these alternatives, independently of the uncertainty of their\r\nresults, were likely to delay the final decision, and to perpetuate\r\nan agitation which must always be accompanied with danger. The third\r\nexpedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed that the votes should\r\nbe transmitted sealed to the president of the senate, and that they\r\nshould be opened and counted in the presence of the senate and the house\r\nof representatives. If none of the candidates has a majority, the house\r\nof representatives then proceeds immediately to elect the president; but\r\nwith the condition that it must fix upon one of the three candidates who\r\nhave the highest numbers.[140]\r\n\r\nThus it is only in case of an event which cannot often happen, and which\r\ncan never be foreseen, that the election is intrusted to the ordinary\r\nrepresentatives of the nation; and even then they are obliged to choose\r\na citizen who has already been designated by a powerful minority of the\r\nspecial electors. It is by this happy expedient that the respect due to\r\nthe popular voice is combined with the utmost celerity of execution\r\nand those precautions which the peace of the country demands. But\r\nthe decision of the question by the house of representatives does not\r\nnecessarily offer an immediate solution of the difficulty, for the\r\nmajority of that assembly may still be doubtful, and in this case the\r\nconstitution prescribes no remedy. Nevertheless, by restricting the\r\nnumber of candidates to three, and by referring the matter to the\r\njudgment of an enlightened public body, it has smoothed all the\r\nobstacles[141] which are not inherent in the elective system.\r\n\r\nIn the forty years which have elapsed since the promulgation of the\r\nfederal constitution, the United States have twelve times chosen a\r\npresident. Ten of these elections took place simultaneously by the\r\nvotes of the special electors in the different states. The house of\r\nrepresentatives has only twice exercised its conditional privilege of\r\ndeciding in cases of uncertainty: the first time was at the election\r\nof Mr. Jefferson in 1801; the second was in 1825, when Mr. John Quincy\r\nAdams was chosen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCRISIS OF THE ELECTION.\r\n\r\nThe election may be considered as a national Crisis.--Why?--Passions\r\nof the People.--Anxiety of the President.--Calm which succeeds the\r\nAgitation of the Election.\r\n\r\nI have shown what the circumstances are which favored the adoption of\r\nthe elective system in the United States, and what precautions were\r\ntaken by the legislators to obviate its dangers. The Americans are\r\naccustomed to all kinds of elections; and they know by experience the\r\nutmost degree of excitement which is compatible with security. The vast\r\nextent of the country, and the dissemination of the inhabitants, render\r\na collision between parties less probable and less dangerous there than\r\nelsewhere. The political circumstances under which the elections have\r\nhitherto been carried on, have presented no real embarrassments to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the epoch of the election of a president of the United\r\nStates may be considered as a crisis in the affairs of the nation. The\r\ninfluence which he exercises on public business is no doubt feeble and\r\nindirect; but the choice of the president, which is of small importance\r\nto each individual citizen, concerns the citizens collectively; and\r\nhowever trifling an interest may be, it assumes a great degree of\r\nimportance as soon as it becomes general. The president possesses but\r\nfew means of rewarding his supporters in comparison to the kings of\r\nEurope; but the places which are at his disposal are sufficiently\r\nnumerous to interest, directly or indirectly, several thousand electors\r\nin his success. Moreover, political parties in the United States, as\r\nwell as elsewhere, are led to rally around an individual, in order to\r\nacquire a more tangible shape in the eyes of the crowd, and the name\r\nof the candidate for the presidency is put forth as the symbol and\r\npersonification of their theories. For these reasons parties are\r\nstrongly interested in gaining the election, not so much with a view\r\nto the triumph of their principles under the auspices of the president\r\nelected, as to show, by the majority which returned him, the strength of\r\nthe supporters of those principles.\r\n\r\nFor a long while before the appointed time is at hand, the election\r\nbecomes the most important and the all-engrossing topic of discussion.\r\nThe ardor of faction is redoubled; and all the artificial passions which\r\nthe imagination can create in the bosom of a happy and peaceful land\r\nare agitated and brought to light. The president, on the other hand,\r\nis absorbed by the cares of self-defence. He no longer governs for the\r\ninterest of the state, but for that of his re-election; he does homage\r\nto the majority, and instead of checking its passions, as his duty\r\ncommands him to do, he frequently courts its worst caprices. As the\r\nelection draws near, the activity of intrigue and the agitation of the\r\npopulace increase; the citizens are divided into several camps, each of\r\nwhich assumes the name of its favorite candidate; the whole nation glows\r\nwith feverish excitement; the election is the daily theme of the public\r\npapers, the subject of private conversation, the end of every thought\r\nand every action, the sole interest of the present. As soon as the\r\nchoice is determined, this ardor is dispelled; and as a calmer season\r\nreturns, the current of the state, which has nearly broken its banks,\r\nsinks to its usual level; but who can refrain from astonishment at the\r\ncauses of the storm?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRE-ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nWhen the Head of the executive Power is re-eligible, it is the State\r\nwhich is the Source of Intrigue and Corruption.--The desire of\r\nbeing re-elected, the chief Aim of a President of the United\r\nStates.--Disadvantage of the System peculiar to America.--The natural\r\nEvil of Democracy is that it subordinates all Authority to the slightest\r\nDesires of the Majority.--The Re-election of the President encourages\r\nthis Evil.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether the legislators of the United States did right\r\nor wrong in allowing the re-election of the president. It seems at first\r\nsight contrary to all reason to prevent the head of the executive power\r\nfrom being elected a second time. The influence which the talents and\r\nthe character of a single individual may exercise upon the fate of a\r\nwhole people, especially in critical circumstances or arduous times,\r\nis well known: a law preventing the re-election of the chief magistrate\r\nwould deprive the citizens of the surest pledge of the prosperity and\r\nthe security of the commonwealth; and, by a singular inconsistency, a\r\nman would be excluded from the government at the very time when he had\r\nshown his ability in conducting its affairs.\r\n\r\nBut if these arguments are strong, perhaps still more powerful reasons\r\nmay be advanced against them. Intrigue and corruption are the natural\r\ndefects of elective government; but when the head of the state can be\r\nre-elected, these evils rise to a great height, and compromise the\r\nvery existence of the country. When a simple candidate seeks to rise by\r\nintrigue, his manoeuvres must necessarily be limited to a narrow sphere;\r\nbut when the chief magistrate enters the lists, he borrows the strength\r\nof the government for his own purposes. In the former case the feeble\r\nresources of an individual are in action; in the latter, the state\r\nitself, with all its immense influence, is busied in the work of\r\ncorruption and cabal. The private citizen, who employs the most\r\nimmoral practices to acquire power, can only act in a manner indirectly\r\nprejudicial to the public prosperity. But if the representative of the\r\nexecutive descends into the lists, the cares of government dwindle into\r\nsecond-rate importance, and the success of his election is his first\r\nconcern. All laws and negotiations are then to him nothing more than\r\nelectioneering schemes; places become the reward of services rendered,\r\nnot to the nation, but to its chief; and the influence of the\r\ngovernment, if not injurious to the country, is at least no longer\r\nbeneficial to the community for which it was created.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the\r\nUnited States without perceiving that the desire of being re-elected is\r\nthe chief aim of the president; that his whole administration, and even\r\nhis most indifferent measures, tend to this object; and that, as the\r\ncrisis approaches, his personal interest takes the place of his interest\r\nin the public good. The principle of re-eligibility renders the corrupt\r\ninfluence of elective governments still more extensive and pernicious.\r\nIt tends to degrade the political morality of the people, and to\r\nsubstitute adroitness for patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn America it exercises a still more fatal influence on the sources of\r\nnational existence. Every government seems to be afflicted by some evil\r\ninherent in its nature, and the genius of the legislator is shown in\r\neluding its attacks. A state may survive the influence of a host of bad\r\nlaws, and the mischief they cause is frequently exaggerated; but a law\r\nwhich encourages the growth of the canker within must prove fatal in the\r\nend, although its bad consequences may not be immediately perceived.\r\n\r\nThe principle of destruction in absolute monarchies lies in the\r\nexcessive and unreasonable extension of the prerogative of the crown;\r\nand a measure tending to remove the constitutional provisions which\r\ncounterbalance this influence would be radically bad, even if its\r\nconsequences should long appear to be imperceptible. By a parity of\r\nreasoning, in countries governed by a democracy, where the people is\r\nperpetually drawing all authority to itself, the laws which increase or\r\naccelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very principle of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe greatest proof of the ability of the American legislators is, that\r\nthey clearly discerned this truth, and that they had the courage to act\r\nup to it. They conceived that a certain authority above the body of\r\nthe people was necessary, which should enjoy a degree of independence,\r\nwithout however being entirely beyond the popular control; an authority\r\nwhich would be forced to comply with the _permanent_ determinations of\r\nthe majority, but which would be able to resist its caprices, and to\r\nrefuse its most dangerous demands. To this end they centred the whole\r\nexecutive power of the nation in a single arm; they granted extensive\r\nprerogatives to the president, and they armed him with the veto to\r\nresist the encroachments of the legislature.\r\n\r\nBut by introducing the principle of re-election, they partly destroyed\r\ntheir work; and they rendered the president but little inclined to exert\r\nthe great power they had invested in his hands. If ineligible a second\r\ntime, the president would be far from independent of the people, for his\r\nresponsibility would not be lessened; but the favor of the people would\r\nnot be so necessary to him as to induce him to court it by humoring its\r\ndesires. If re-eligible (and this is more especially true at the present\r\nday, when political morality is relaxed, and when great men are rare),\r\nthe president of the United States becomes an easy tool in the hands of\r\nthe majority. He adopts its likings and its animosities, he hastens to\r\nanticipate its wishes, he forestalls its complaints, he yields to its\r\nidlest cravings, and instead of guiding it, as the legislature intended\r\nthat he should do, he is ever ready to follow its bidding. Thus, in\r\norder not to deprive the state of the talents of an individual, those\r\ntalents have been rendered almost useless, and to reserve an expedient\r\nfor extraordinary perils the country has been exposed to daily dangers.\r\n\r\n[The question of the propriety of leaving the president re-eligible,\r\nis one of that class which probably must for ever remain undecided. The\r\nauthor himself, at page 125, gives a strong reason for re-eligibility,\r\n\"so that the chance of a prolonged administration may inspire him with\r\nhopeful undertakings for the public good, and with the means of carrying\r\nthem into execution,\"--considerations of great weight. There is an\r\nimportant fact bearing upon this question, which should be stated in\r\nconnexion with it. President Washington established the practice of\r\ndeclining a third election, and every one of his successors, either from\r\na sense of its propriety or from apprehensions of the force of public\r\nopinion, has followed the example. So that it has become as much a\r\npart of the constitution, that no citizen can be a third time elected\r\npresident, as if it were expressed in that instrument in words. This may\r\nperhaps be considered a fair adjustment of objections on either side.\r\nThose against a continued and perpetual re-eligibility are certainly\r\nmet: while the arguments in favor of an opportunity to prolong an\r\nadministration under circumstances that may justify it, are allowed\r\ntheir due weight. One effect of this practical interpolation of the\r\nconstitution unquestionably is, to increase the chances of a president's\r\nbeing once re-elected; as men will be more disposed to acquiesce in a\r\nmeasure that thus practically excludes the individual from ever again\r\nentering the field of competition.--_American Editor_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEDERAL COURTS.[142]\r\n\r\nPolitical Importance of the Judiciary in the United States.--Difficulty\r\nof treating this Subject.--Utility of judicial Power in\r\nConfederations--What Tribunals could be introduced into\r\nthe Union.--Necessity of establishing federal Courts of\r\nJustice.--Organization of the national Judiciary.--The Supreme\r\nCourt.--In what it differs from all known Tribunals.\r\n\r\nI have inquired into the legislative and executive power of the Union,\r\nand the judicial power now remains to be examined; but in this place I\r\ncannot conceal my fears from the reader. Judicial institutions exercise\r\na great influence on the condition of the Anglo-Americans, and they\r\noccupy a prominent place among what are properly called political\r\ninstitutions: in this respect they are peculiarly deserving of our\r\nattention. But I am at a loss to explain the political action of the\r\nAmerican tribunals without entering into some technical details on\r\ntheir constitution and their forms of proceeding; and I know not how to\r\ndescend to these minutiae without wearying the curiosity of the reader\r\nby the natural aridity of the subject, or without risking to fall into\r\nobscurity through a desire to be succinct. I can scarcely hope to escape\r\nthese various evils; for if I appear too prolix to a man of the world,\r\na lawyer may on the other hand complain of my brevity. But these are the\r\nnatural disadvantages of my subject, and more especially of the point\r\nwhich I am about to discuss.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty was, not to devise the constitution of the federal\r\ngovernment, but to find out a method of enforcing its laws. Governments\r\nhave in general but two means of overcoming the opposition of the people\r\nthey govern, viz., the physical force which is at their own disposal,\r\nand the moral force which they derive from the decisions of the courts\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nA government which should have no other means of exacting obedience than\r\nopen war, must be very near its ruin; for one of two alternatives would\r\nthen probably occur: if its authority was small, and its character\r\ntemperate, it would not resort to violence till the last extremity,\r\nand it would connive at a number of partial acts of insubordination,\r\nin which case the state would gradually fall into anarchy; if it was\r\nenterprising and powerful, it would perpetually have recourse to\r\nits physical strength, and would speedily degenerate into a military\r\ndespotism. So that its activity would not be less prejudicial to the\r\ncommunity than its inaction.\r\n\r\nThe great end of justice is to substitute the notion of right for that\r\nof violence; and to place a legal barrier between the power of the\r\ngovernment and the use of physical force. The authority which is awarded\r\nto the intervention of a court of justice by the general opinion of\r\nmankind is so surprisingly great, that it clings to the mere formalities\r\nof justice, and gives a bodily influence to the shadow of the law. The\r\nmoral force which courts of justice possess renders the introduction of\r\nphysical force exceedingly rare, and it is very frequently substituted\r\nfor it; but if the latter proves to be indispensable, its power is\r\ndoubled by the association of the idea of law.\r\n\r\nA federal government stands in greater need of the support of judicial\r\ninstitutions than any other, because it is naturally weak, and opposed\r\nto formidable opposition.[143] If it were always obliged to resort to\r\nviolence in the first instance, it could not fulfil its task. The Union,\r\ntherefore, required a national judiciary to enforce the obedience of the\r\ncitizens to the laws, and to repel the attacks which might be directed\r\nagainst them. The question then remained what tribunals were to exercise\r\nthese privileges; were they to be intrusted to the courts of justice\r\nwhich were already organized in every state? or was it necessary to\r\ncreate federal courts? It may easily be proved that the Union could not\r\nadapt the judicial power of the state to its wants. The separation\r\nof the judiciary from the administrative power of the state, no doubt\r\naffects the security of every citizen, and the liberty of all. But it\r\nis no less important to the existence of the nation that these several\r\npowers should have the same origin, should follow the same principles,\r\nand act in the same sphere; in a word, that they should be correlative\r\nand homogeneous. No one, I presume, ever suggested the advantage of\r\ntrying offences committed in France, by a foreign court of justice, in\r\norder to ensure the impartiality of the judges. The Americans form one\r\npeople in relation to their federal government; but in the bosom of this\r\npeople divers political bodies have been allowed to subsist, which are\r\ndependent on the national government in a few points, and independent\r\nin all the rest--which have all a distinct origin, maxims peculiar to\r\nthemselves, and special means of carrying on their affairs. To intrust\r\nthe execution of the laws of the Union to tribunals instituted by these\r\npolitical bodies, would be to allow foreign judges to preside over the\r\nnation. Nay more, not only is each state foreign to the Union at\r\nlarge, but it is in perpetual opposition to the common interests, since\r\nwhatever authority the Union loses turns to the advantage of the states.\r\nThus to enforce the laws of the Union by means of the tribunals of\r\nthe states, would be to allow not only foreign, but partial judges to\r\npreside over the nation.\r\n\r\nBut the number, still more than the mere character, of the tribunals of\r\nthe states rendered them unfit for the service of the nation. When the\r\nfederal constitution was formed, there were already thirteen courts of\r\njustice in the United States which decided causes without appeal. That\r\nnumber is now increased to twenty-four. To suppose that a state can\r\nsubsist, when its fundamental laws may be subjected to four-and-twenty\r\ndifferent interpretations at the same time, is to advance a proposition\r\nalike contrary to reason and to experience.\r\n\r\nThe American legislators therefore agreed to create a federal judiciary\r\npower to apply the laws of the Union, and to determine certain questions\r\naffecting general interests, which were carefully determined beforehand.\r\nThe entire judicial power of the Union was centred in one tribunal,\r\nwhich was denominated the supreme court of the United States. But, to\r\nfacilitate the expedition of business, inferior courts were appended to\r\nit, which were empowered to decide causes of small importance without\r\nappeal, and with appeal causes of more magnitude. The members of the\r\nsupreme court are named neither by the people nor the legislature, but\r\nby the president of the United States, acting with the advice of the\r\nsenate. In order to render them independent of the other authorities,\r\ntheir office was made inalienable; and it was determined that their\r\nsalary, when once fixed, should not be altered by the legislature.[144]\r\nIt was easy to proclaim the principle of a federal judiciary, but\r\ndifficulties multiplied when the extent of its jurisdiction was to be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMEANS OF DETERMINING THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS.\r\n\r\nDifficulty of determining the Jurisdiction of separate courts of Justice\r\nin Confederation.--The Courts of the Union obtained the Right of fixing\r\ntheir own Jurisdiction.--In what Respect this Rule attacks the Portion\r\nof Sovereignty reserved to the several States.--The Sovereignty of\r\nthese States restricted by the Laws, and the Interpretation of the\r\nLaws.--Consequently, the Danger of the several States is more apparent\r\nthan real.\r\n\r\nAs the constitution of the United States recognized two distinct powers,\r\nin presence of each other, represented in a judicial point of view by\r\ntwo distinct classes of courts of justice, the utmost care which could\r\nbe taken in defining their separate jurisdictions would have been\r\ninsufficient to prevent frequent collisions between those tribunals.\r\nThe question then arose, to whom the right of deciding the competency of\r\neach court was to be referred.\r\n\r\nIn nations which constitute a single body politic, when a question is\r\ndebated between two courts relating to their mutual jurisdiction, a\r\nthird tribunal is generally within reach to decide the difference;\r\nand this is effected without difficulty, because in these nations the\r\nquestions of judicial competency have no connexion with the privileges\r\nof the national supremacy. But it was impossible to create an arbiter\r\nbetween a superior court of the Union and the superior court of a\r\nseparate state, which would not belong to one of these two classes. It\r\nwas therefore necessary to allow one of these courts to judge its\r\nown cause, and to take or to retain cognizance of the point which\r\nwas contested. To grant this privilege to the different courts of the\r\nstates, would have been to destroy the sovereignty of the Union _de\r\nfacto_, after having established it _de jure_; for the interpretation of\r\nthe constitution would soon have restored that portion of independence\r\nto the states of which the terms of that act deprived them. The object\r\nof the creation of a federal tribunal was to prevent the courts of the\r\nstates from deciding questions affecting the national interests in their\r\nown department, and so to form a uniform body of jurisprudence for the\r\ninterpretation of the laws of the Union. This end would not have been\r\naccomplished if the courts of the several states had been competent to\r\ndecide upon cases in their separate capacities, from which they were\r\nobliged to abstain as federal tribunals. The supreme court of the\r\nUnited States was therefore invested with the right of determining all\r\nquestions of jurisdiction.[145]\r\n\r\nThis was a severe blow upon the independence of the states, which was\r\nthus restricted not only by the laws, but by the interpretation of them;\r\nby one limit which was known, and by another which was dubious; by a\r\nrule which was certain, and a rule which was arbitrary. It is true the\r\nconstitution had laid down the precise limits of the federal supremacy,\r\nbut whenever this supremacy is contested by one of the states, a federal\r\ntribunal decides the question. Nevertheless, the dangers with which the\r\nindependence of the states was threatened by this mode of proceeding\r\nare less serious than they appear to be. We shall see hereafter that in\r\nAmerica the real strength of the country is vested in the provincial far\r\nmore than in the federal government. The federal judges are conscious of\r\nthe relative weakness of the power in whose name they act, and they are\r\nmore inclined to abandon a right of jurisdiction in cases where it is\r\njustly their own, than to assert a privilege to which they have no legal\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT CASES OF JURISDICTION.\r\n\r\nThe Matter and the Party are the first Conditions of the federal\r\nJurisdiction.--Suits in which Ambassadors are engaged.--Suits of the\r\nUnion.--Of a separate State.--By whom tried.--Causes resulting from the\r\nLaws of the Union.--Why judged by the federal Tribunal.--Causes\r\nrelating to the Non-performance of Contracts tried by the federal\r\nCourts.--Consequences of this Arrangement.\r\n\r\nAfter having appointed the means of fixing the competency of the federal\r\ncourts, the legislators of the Union defined the cases which should come\r\nwithin their jurisdiction. It was established, on the one hand, that\r\ncertain parties must always be brought before the federal courts,\r\nwithout any regard to the special nature of the cause; and, on the\r\nother, that certain causes must always be brought before the same\r\ncourts, without any regard to the quality of the parties in the suit.\r\nThese distinctions were therefore admitted to be the bases of the\r\nfederal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors are the representatives of nations in a state of amity\r\nwith the Union, and whatever concerns these personages concerns in some\r\ndegree the whole Union. When I an ambassador is a party in a suit,\r\nthat suit affects the welfare of the nation, and a federal tribunal is\r\nnaturally called upon to decide it.\r\n\r\nThe Union itself may be involved in legal proceedings, and in this case\r\nit would be alike contrary to the customs of all nations, and to common\r\nsense, to appeal to a tribunal representing any other sovereignty\r\nthan its own; the federal courts, therefore, take cognizance of these\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nWhen two parties belonging to two different states are engaged in a\r\nsuit, the case cannot with propriety be brought before a court of either\r\nstate. The surest expedient is to select a tribunal like that of the\r\nUnion, which can excite the suspicions of neither party, and which\r\noffers the most natural as well as the most certain remedy.\r\n\r\nWhen the two parties are not private individuals, but states, an\r\nimportant political consideration is added to the same motive of equity.\r\nThe quality of the parties, in this case, gives a national importance to\r\nall their disputes; and the most trifling litigation of the states may\r\nbe said to involve the peace of the whole Union.[146]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the cause frequently prescribes the rule of competency.\r\nThus all the questions which concern maritime commerce evidently fall\r\nunder the cognizance of the federal tribunals.[147] Almost all these\r\nquestions are connected with the interpretation of the law of nations;\r\nand in this respect they essentially interest the Union in relation to\r\nforeign powers. Moreover, as the sea is not included within the limits\r\nof any peculiar jurisdiction, the national courts can only hear causes\r\nwhich originate in maritime affairs.\r\n\r\nThe constitution comprises under one head almost all the cases which by\r\ntheir very nature come within the limits of the federal courts. The\r\nrule which it lays down is simple, but pregnant with an entire system of\r\nideas, and with a vast multitude of facts. It declares that the judicial\r\npower of the supreme court shall extend to all cases in law and equity\r\n_arising under the laws of the United States_.\r\n\r\nTwo examples will put the intentions of the legislator in the clearest\r\nlight:--\r\n\r\nThe constitution prohibits the states from making laws on the value\r\nand circulation of money: if, notwithstanding this prohibition, a state\r\npasses a law of this kind, with which the interested parties refuse to\r\ncomply because it is contrary to the constitution, the case must come\r\nbefore a federal court, because it arises under the laws of the United\r\nStates. Again, if difficulties arise in the levying of import duties\r\nwhich have been voted by congress, the federal court must decide the\r\ncase, because it arises under the interpretation of a law of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis rule is in perfect accordance with the fundamental principles\r\nof the federal constitution. The Union as it was established in 1789,\r\npossesses, it is true, a limited supremacy; but it was intended that\r\nwithin its limits it should form one and the same people.[148] Within\r\nthose limits the Union is sovereign. When this point is established\r\nand admitted, the inference is easy; for if it be acknowledged that\r\nthe United States constitute one and the same people within the bounds\r\nprescribed by their constitution, it is impossible to refuse them the\r\nrights which belong to other nations. But it has been allowed, from the\r\norigin of society, that every nation has the right of deciding by its\r\nown courts those questions which concern the execution of its own laws.\r\nTo this it is answered, that the Union is in so singular a position,\r\nthat in relation to some matters it constitutes a people, and that in\r\nrelation to all the rest it is a nonentity. But the inference to be\r\ndrawn is, that in the laws relating to these matters the Union possesses\r\nall the rights of absolute sovereignty. The difficulty is to know what\r\nthese matters are; and when once it is resolved (and we have shown\r\nhow it was resolved, in speaking of the means of determining the\r\njurisdiction of the federal courts), no farther doubt can arise; for as\r\nsoon as it is established that a suit is federal, that is to say, that\r\nit belongs to the share of sovereignty reserved by the constitution to\r\nthe Union, the natural consequence is that it should come within the\r\njurisdiction of a federal court.\r\n\r\nWhenever the laws of the United States are attacked, or whenever they\r\nare resorted to in self-defence, the federal courts must be appealed to.\r\nThus the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the Union extends and narrows\r\nits limits exactly in the same ratio as the sovereignty of the Union\r\naugments or decreases. We have shown that the principal aim of the\r\nlegislators of 1789 was to divide the sovereign authority into two\r\nparts. In the one they placed the control of all the general interests\r\nof the Union, in the other the control of the special interest of\r\nits component states. Their chief solicitude was to arm the federal\r\ngovernment with sufficient power to enable it to resist, within\r\nits sphere, the encroachments of the several states. As for these\r\ncommunities, the principle of independence within certain limits of\r\ntheir own was adopted in their behalf; and they were concealed from the\r\ninspection, and protected from the control, of the central government.\r\nIn speaking of the division of the authority, I observed that this\r\nlatter principle had not always been held sacred, since the states are\r\nprevented from passing certain laws, which apparently belong to their\r\nown particular sphere of interest. When a state of the Union passes\r\na law of this kind, the citizens who are injured by its execution can\r\nappeal to the federal courts.\r\n\r\n[The remark of the author, that whenever the laws of the United States\r\nare attacked, or whenever they are resorted to in self-defence, the\r\nfederal courts _must be_ appealed to, which is more strongly expressed\r\nin the original, is erroneous and calculated to mislead on a point\r\nof some importance. By the grant of power to the courts of the United\r\nStates to decide certain cases, the powers of the state courts are not\r\nsuspended, but are exercised concurrently, subject to an appeal to the\r\ncourts of the United States. But if the decision of the state court\r\nis _in favor_ of the right, title, or privilege claimed under the\r\nconstitution, a treaty, or under a law of congress, no appeal lies\r\nto the federal courts. The appeal is given only when the decision _is\r\nagainst_ the claimant under the treaty or law. See 3d Cranch, 268. 1\r\nWheaton, 304.--_American Editor._]\r\n\r\nThus the jurisdiction of the general courts extends not only to all the\r\ncases which arise under the laws of the Union, but also to those\r\nwhich arise under laws made by the several states in opposition to the\r\nconstitution. The states are prohibited from making _ex-post-facto_ laws\r\nin criminal cases; and any person condemned by virtue of a law of this\r\nkind can appeal to the judicial power of the Union. The states are\r\nlikewise prohibited from making laws which may have a tendency to\r\nimpair the obligations of contracts.[149] If a citizen thinks that an\r\nobligation of this kind is impaired by a law passed in his state, he may\r\nrefuse to obey it, and may appeal to the federal courts.[150]\r\n\r\nThis provision appears to me to be the most serious attack upon the\r\nindependence of the states. The rights awarded to the federal government\r\nfor purposes of obvious national importance are definite and easily\r\ncomprehensible; but those with which this last clause invests it are\r\nnot either clearly appreciable or accurately defined. For there are vast\r\nnumbers of political laws which influence the obligations of contracts,\r\nwhich may thus furnish an easy pretext for the aggressions of the\r\ncentral authority.\r\n\r\n[The fears of the author respecting the danger to the independence of\r\nthe states of that provision of the constitution, which gives to the\r\nfederal courts the authority of deciding when a state law impairs the\r\nobligation of a contract, are deemed quite unfounded. The citizens of\r\nevery state have a deep interest in preserving the obligation of the\r\ncontracts entered into by them in other states: indeed without such a\r\ncontrolling power, \"commerce among several states\" could not exist.\r\nThe existence of this common arbiter is of the last importance to the\r\ncontinuance of the Union itself, for if there were no peaceable means\r\nof enforcing the obligations of contracts, independent of all state\r\nauthority, the states themselves would inevitably come in collision in\r\ntheir efforts to protect their respective citizens from the consequences\r\nof the legislation of another state.\r\n\r\nM. De Tocqueville's observation, that the rights with which the clause\r\nin question invests the federal government \"are not clearly appreciable\r\nor accurately defined,\" proceeds upon a mistaken view of the clause\r\nitself. It relates to the _obligation_ of a contract, and forbids any\r\nact by which that obligation is impaired. To American lawyers, this\r\nseems to be as precise and definite as any rule can be made by human\r\nlanguage. The distinction between the _right_ to the fruits of a\r\ncontract, and the time, tribunal, and manner, in which that right is to\r\nbe enforced, seems very palpable. At all events, since the decision\r\nof the supreme court of the United States in those cases in which this\r\nclause has been discussed, no difficulty is found, practically, in\r\nunderstanding the exact limits of the prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe next observation of the author, that \"there are vast numbers of\r\npolitical laws which influence the obligations of contracts, which\r\nmay thus furnish an easy pretext for the aggressions of the central\r\nauthority,\" is rather obscure. Is it intended that political laws may\r\nbe passed by the central authority, influencing the obligation of a\r\ncontract, and thus the contracts themselves be destroyed? The answer\r\nto this would be, that the question would not arise under the clause\r\nforbidding laws impairing the obligation of contracts, for that clause\r\napplies only to the states and not to the federal government.\r\n\r\nIf it be intended, that the states may find it necessary to pass\r\npolitical laws, which affect contracts, and that under the pretence of\r\nvindicating the obligation of contracts, the central authority may make\r\naggressions on the states and annul their political laws:--the answer\r\nis, that the motive to the adoption of the clause was to reach laws of\r\nevery description, political as well as all others, and that it was the\r\nabuse by the states of what may be called political laws, viz.: acts\r\nconfiscating demands of foreign creditors, that gave rise to the\r\nprohibition. The settled doctrine now is, that states may pass laws in\r\nrespect to the making of contracts, may prescribe what contracts shall\r\nbe made, and how, but that they cannot impair any that are already made.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this note is unwilling to dismiss the subject, without\r\nremarking upon what he must think a fundamental error of the author,\r\nwhich is exhibited in the passage commented on, as well as in other\r\npassages:--and that is, in supposing the judiciary of the United States,\r\nand particularly the supreme court, to be a part of the _political_\r\nfederal government, and as the ready instrument to execute its designs\r\nupon the state authorities. Although the judges are in form commissioned\r\nby the United States, yet, in fact, they are appointed by the delegates\r\nof the state, in the senate of the United States, concurrently with, and\r\nacting upon, the nomination of the president. If the legislature of each\r\nstate in the Union were to elect a judge of the supreme court, he would\r\nnot be less a political officer of the United States than he now is.\r\nIn truth, the judiciary have no political duties to perform; they are\r\narbiters chosen by the federal and state governments, jointly, and when\r\nappointed, as independent of the one as of the other. They cannot be\r\nremoved without the consent of the states represented in the senate, and\r\nthey can be removed without the consent of the president, and against\r\nhis wishes. Such is the theory of the constitution. And it has been\r\nfelt practically, in the rejection by the senate of persons nominated\r\nas judges, by a president of the same political party with a majority\r\nof the senators. Two instances of this kind occurred during the\r\nadministration of Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nIf it be alleged that they are exposed to the influence of the executive\r\nof the United States, by the expectation of offices in his gift, the\r\nanswer is, that judges of state courts are equally exposed to the same\r\ninfluence--that all state officers, from the highest to the lowest, are\r\nin the same predicament; and that this circumstance does not, therefore,\r\ndeprive them of the character of impartial and independent arbiters.\r\n\r\nThese observations receive confirmation from every recent decision\r\nof the supreme court of the United States, in which certain laws of\r\nindividual states have been sustained, in cases where, to say the least,\r\nit was very questionable whether they did not infringe the provisions of\r\nthe constitution, and where a disposition to construe those previsions\r\nbroadly and extensively, would have found very plausible grounds to\r\nindulge itself in annulling the state laws referred to. See the cases of\r\n_City of New York vs. Miln_, 11th _Peters_, 103; _Briscoe vs. the Bank\r\nof the Commonwealth of Kentucky_, ib., 257; _Charles River Bridge vs.\r\nWarren Bridge_, ib., 420.--_American Ed._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE OF THE FEDERAL COURTS.\r\n\r\nNatural Weakness of the judiciary Power in Confederations.--Legislators\r\nought to strive as much as possible to bring private Individuals, and\r\nnot States, before the federal Courts.--How the Americans have succeeded\r\nin this.--Direct Prosecutions of private Individuals in the federal\r\nCourts.--Indirect Prosecution in the States which violate the Laws of\r\nthe Union.--The Decrees of the Supreme Court enervate but do not destroy\r\nthe provincial Laws.\r\n\r\nI have shown what the privileges of the federal courts are, and it is no\r\nless important to point out the manner in which they are exercised. The\r\nirresistible authority of justice in countries in which the sovereignty\r\nis undivided, is derived from the fact that the tribunals of those\r\ncountries represent the entire nation at issue with the individual\r\nagainst whom their decree is directed; and the idea of power is thus\r\nintroduced to corroborate the idea of right. But this is not always\r\nthe case in countries in which the sovereignty is divided: in them the\r\njudicial power is more frequently opposed to a fraction of the nation\r\nthan to an isolated individual, and its moral authority and physical\r\nstrength are consequently diminished. In federal states the power of\r\nthe judge is naturally decreased, and that of the justiciable parties\r\nis augmented. The aim of the legislator in confederate states ought\r\ntherefore to be, to render the position of the courts of justice\r\nanalogous to that which they occupy in countries where the sovereignty\r\nis undivided; in other words, his efforts ought constantly to tend to\r\nmaintain the judicial power of the confederation as the representative\r\nof the nation, and the justiciable party as the representative of an\r\nindividual interest.\r\n\r\nEvery government, whatever may be its constitution, requires the means\r\nof constraining its subjects to discharge their obligations, and of\r\nprotecting its privileges from their assaults. As far as the direct\r\naction of the government on the community is concerned, the constitution\r\nof the United States contrived, by a master-stroke of policy, that\r\nthe federal courts, acting in the name of the laws, should only take\r\ncognizance of parties in an individual capacity. For, as it had been\r\ndeclared that the Union consisted of one and the same people within\r\nthe limits laid down by the constitution, the inference was that the\r\ngovernment created by this constitution, and acting within these limits,\r\nwas invested with all the privileges of a national government, one of\r\nthe principal of which is the right of transmitting its injunctions\r\ndirectly to the private citizen. When, for instance, the Union votes an\r\nimpost, it does not apply to the states for the levying of it, but to\r\nevery American citizen, in proportion to his assessment. The supreme\r\ncourt, which is empowered to enforce the execution of this law of the\r\nUnion, exerts its influence not upon a refractory state, but upon the\r\nprivate taxpayer; and, like the judicial power of other nations, it is\r\nopposed to the person of an individual. It is to be observed that the\r\nUnion chose its own antagonist; and as that antagonist is feeble, he is\r\nnaturally worsted.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not brought\r\nforward _by_ but _against_ the Union. The constitution recognizes the\r\nlegislative power of the state; and a law so enacted may impair the\r\nprivileges of the Union, in which case a collision is unavoidable\r\nbetween that body and the state which had passed the law; and it only\r\nremains to select the least dangerous remedy, which is very clearly\r\ndeducible from the general principles I have before established.[151]\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived that, in the case under consideration, the Union\r\nmight have sued the state before a federal court, which would have\r\nannulled the act; and by this means it would have adopted a natural\r\ncourse of proceeding: but the judicial power would have been placed\r\nin open hostility to the state, and it was desirable to avoid this\r\npredicament as much as possible. The Americans hold that it is nearly\r\nimpossible that a new law should not impair the interests of some\r\nprivate individuals by its provisions: these private interests are\r\nassumed by the American legislators as the ground of attack against such\r\nmeasures as may be prejudicial to the Union, and it is to these cases\r\nthat the protection of the supreme court is extended.\r\n\r\nSuppose a state vends a certain portion of its territory to a company,\r\nand that a year afterwards it passes a law by which the territory\r\nis otherwise disposed of, and that clause of the constitution, which\r\nprohibits laws impairing the obligation of contracts, is violated.\r\nWhen the purchaser under the second act appears to take possession, the\r\npossessor under the first act brings his action before the tribunals of\r\nthe Union, and causes the title of the claimant to be pronounced null\r\nand void.[152] This, in point of fact, the judicial power of the Union\r\nis contesting the claims of the sovereignty of a state; but it only acts\r\nindirectly and upon a special application of detail: it attacks the law\r\nin its consequences, not in its principle, and it rather weakens than\r\ndestroys it.\r\n\r\nThe last hypothesis that remained was that each state formed a\r\ncorporation enjoying a separate existence and distinct civil rights, and\r\nthat it could therefore sue or be sued before a tribunal. Thus a state\r\ncould bring an action against another state. In this instance, the Union\r\nwas not called upon to contest a provincial law, but to try a suit in\r\nwhich a state was a party. This suit was perfectly similar to any other\r\ncause, except that the quality of the parties was different; and here\r\nthe danger pointed out at the beginning of this chapter exists with less\r\nchance of being avoided. The inherent disadvantage of the very essence\r\nof federal constitutions is, that they engender parties in the bosom\r\nof the nation which present powerful obstacles to the free course of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHIGH RANK OF THE SUPREME COURTS AMONG THE GREAT POWERS OF STATE.\r\n\r\nNo Nation ever constituted so great a judicial Power as the Americans.\r\nExtent of its Prerogative.--Its political Influence.--The Tranquillity\r\nand the very Existence of the Union depend on the Discretion of the\r\nseven federal Judges.\r\n\r\nWhen we have successfully examined in detail the organization of the\r\nsupreme court, and the entire prerogatives which it exercises, we shall\r\nreadily admit that a more imposing judicial power was never constituted\r\nby any people. The supreme court is placed at the head of all known\r\ntribunals, both by the nature of its rights and the class of justiciable\r\nparties which it controls.\r\n\r\nIn all the civilized countries of Europe, the government has always\r\nshown the greatest repugnance to allow the cases to which it was itself\r\na party to be decided by the ordinary course of justice. This repugnance\r\nnaturally attains its utmost height in an absolute government; and, on\r\nthe other hand, the privileges of the courts of justice are extended\r\nwith the increasing liberties of the people; but no European nation has\r\nat present held that all judicial controversies, without regard to their\r\norigin, can be decided by the judges of common law.\r\n\r\nIn America this theory has been actually put in practice; and the\r\nsupreme court of the United States is the sole tribunal of the nation.\r\nIts power extends to all the cases arising under laws and treaties made\r\nby the executive and legislative authorities, to all cases of admiralty\r\nand maritime jurisdiction, and in general to all points which affect the\r\nlaw of nations. It may even be affirmed that, although its constitution\r\nis essentially judicial, its prerogatives are almost entirely political.\r\nIts sole object is to enforce the execution of the laws of the Union;\r\nand the Union only regulates the relations of the government with\r\nthe citizens, and of the nation with foreign powers: the relations\r\nof citizens among themselves are almost exclusively regulated by the\r\nsovereignty of the states.\r\n\r\nA second and still greater cause of the preponderance of this court\r\nmay be adduced. In the nations of Europe the courts of justice are only\r\ncalled upon to try the controversies of private individuals; but the\r\nsupreme court of the United States summons sovereign powers to its bar.\r\nWhen the clerk of the court advances on the steps of the tribunal, and\r\nsimply says, \"The state of New York _versus_ the state of Ohio,\" it is\r\nimpossible not to feel that the court which he addresses is no ordinary\r\nbody; and when it is recollected that one of these parties represents\r\none million, and the other two millions of men, one is struck by the\r\nresponsibility of the seven judges whose decision is about to satisfy or\r\nto disappoint so large a number of their fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe peace, the prosperity, and the very existence of the Union,\r\nare invested in the hands of the seven judges. Without their active\r\nco-operation the constitution would be a dead letter: the executive\r\nappeals to them for assistance against the encroachments of the\r\nlegislative powers; the legislature demands their protection from the\r\ndesigns of the executive; they defend the Union from the disobedience\r\nof the states, the states from the exaggerated claims of the Union,\r\nthe public interest against the interests of private citizens, and\r\nthe conservative spirit of order against the fleeting innovations of\r\ndemocracy. Their power is enormous, but it is clothed in the authority\r\nof public opinion. They are the all-powerful guardians of a people which\r\nrespects law; but they would be impotent against popular neglect or\r\npopular contempt. The force of public opinion is the most intractable of\r\nagents, because its exact limits cannot be defined; and it is not less\r\ndangerous to exceed, than to remain below the boundary prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe federal judges must not only be good citizens, and men possessed of\r\nthat information and integrity which are indispensable to magistrates,\r\nbut they must be statesmen--politicians, not unread in the signs of the\r\ntimes, not afraid to brave the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow\r\nto turn aside such encroaching elements as may threaten the supremacy of\r\nthe Union and the obedience which is due to the laws.\r\n\r\nThe president, who exercises a limited power, may err without causing\r\ngreat mischief in the state. Congress may decide amiss without\r\ndestroying the Union, because the electoral body in which congress\r\noriginates may cause it to retract its decision by changing its members.\r\nBut if the supreme court is ever composed of imprudent men or bad\r\ncitizens, the Union may be plunged into anarchy or civil war.\r\n\r\nThe real cause of this danger, however, does not lie in the constitution\r\nof the tribunal, but in the very nature of federal governments. We\r\nhave observed that in confederate peoples it is especially necessary to\r\nconsolidate the judicial authority, because in no other nations do those\r\nindependent persons who are able to cope with the social body, exist, in\r\ngreater power or in a better condition to resist the physical strength\r\nof the government. But the more a power requires to be strengthened, the\r\nmore extensive and independent it must be made; and the dangers\r\nwhich its abuse may create are heightened by its independence and its\r\nstrength. The source of the evil is not, therefore, in the constitution\r\nof the power, but in the constitution of those states which renders its\r\nexistence necessary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN WHAT RESPECTS THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION IS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nIn what respects the Constitution of the Union can be compared to\r\nthat of the States.--Superiority of the Constitution of the Union\r\nattributable to the Wisdom of the federal Legislators.--Legislature\r\nof the Union less dependent on the People than that of the\r\nStates.--Executive Power more independent in its Sphere.--Judicial\r\nPower less subjected to the Inclinations of the Majority.--Practical\r\nConsequences of these Facts.--The Dangers inherent in a democratic\r\nGovernment eluded by the federal Legislators, and increased by the\r\nLegislators of the States.\r\n\r\nThe federal constitution differs essentially from that of the states in\r\nthe ends which it is intended to accomplish; but in the means by which\r\nthese ends are promoted, a greater analogy exists between them. The\r\nobjects of the governments are different, but their forms are the same;\r\nand in this special point of view there is some advantage in comparing\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the federal constitution is superior to all the\r\nconstitutions of the states, for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe present constitution of the Union was formed at a later period\r\nthan those of the majority of the states, and it may have derived some\r\nmelioration from past experience. But we shall be led to acknowledge\r\nthat this is only a secondary cause of its superiority, when we\r\nrecollect that eleven new states have been added to the American\r\nconfederation since the promulgation of the federal constitution, and\r\nthat these new republics have always rather exaggerated than avoided the\r\ndefects which existed in the former constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of the superiority of the federal constitution lay in\r\nthe character of the legislators who composed it. At the time when it\r\nwas formed the dangers of the confederation were imminent, and its ruin\r\nseemed inevitable. In this extremity the people chose the men who most\r\ndeserved the esteem, rather than those who had gained the affections of\r\nthe country. I have already observed, that distinguished as almost all\r\nthe legislators of the Union were for their intelligence, they were\r\nstill more so for their patriotism. They had all been nurtured at a time\r\nwhen the spirit of liberty was braced by a continual struggle against\r\na powerful and predominant authority. When the contest was terminated,\r\nwhile the excited passions of the populace persisted in warring with\r\ndangers which had ceased to threaten them, these men stopped short in\r\ntheir career; they cast a calmer and more penetrating look upon\r\nthe country which was now their own; they perceived that the war of\r\nindependence was definitely ended, and that the only dangers which\r\nAmerica had to fear were those which might result from the abuse of the\r\nfreedom she had won. They had the courage to say what they believed\r\nto be true, because they were animated by a warm and sincere love of\r\nliberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions, because they were\r\nresolutely opposed to destruction.[153]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the constitutions of the states assign one year\r\nfor the duration of the house of representatives, and two years for that\r\nof the senate; so that members of the legislative body are constantly\r\nand narrowly tied down by the slightest desires of their constituents.\r\nThe legislators of the Union were of opinion that this excessive\r\ndependence of the legislature tended to alter the nature of the main\r\nconsequences of the representative system, since it vested the source\r\nnot only of authority, but of government, in the people. They increased\r\nthe length of the time for which the representatives were returned, in\r\norder to give them freer scope for the exercise of their own judgment.\r\n\r\nThe federal constitution, as well as the constitutions of the different\r\nstates, divided the legislative body into two branches. But in the\r\nstates these two branches were composed of the same elements and\r\nelected in the same manner. The consequence was that the passions\r\nand inclinations of the populace were as rapidly and as energetically\r\nrepresented in one chamber as in the other, and that laws were made with\r\nall the characteristics of violence and precipitation. By the federal\r\nconstitution the two houses originate in like manner in the choice of\r\nthe people; but the conditions of eligibility and the mode of election\r\nwere changed, to the end that if, as is the case in certain nations, one\r\nbranch of the legislature represents the same interests as the other, it\r\nmay at least represent a superior degree of intelligence and discretion.\r\nA mature age was made one of the conditions of the senatorial dignity,\r\nand the upper house was chosen by an elected assembly of a limited\r\nnumber of members.\r\n\r\nTo concentrate the whole social force in the hands of the legislative\r\nbody is the natural tendency of democracies; for as this is the\r\npower which emanates the most directly from the people, it is made to\r\nparticipate most fully in the preponderating authority of the multitude,\r\nand it is naturally led to monopolise every species of influence. This\r\nconcentration is at once prejudicial to a well-conducted administration,\r\nand favorable to the despotism of the majority. The legislators of the\r\nstates frequently yielded to these democratic propensities, which were\r\ninvariably and courageously resisted by the founders of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the states the executive power is vested in the hands of a\r\nmagistrate, who is apparently placed upon a level with the legislature,\r\nbut who is in reality nothing more than the blind agent and the passive\r\ninstrument of its decisions. He can derive no influence from the\r\nduration of his functions, which terminate with the revolving year, or\r\nfrom the exercise of prerogatives which can scarcely be said to exist.\r\nThe legislature can condemn him to inaction by intrusting the execution\r\nof the laws to special committees of its own members, and can annul\r\nhis temporary dignity by depriving him of his salary. The federal\r\nconstitution vests all the privileges and all the responsibility of the\r\nexecutive power in a single individual. The duration of the presidency\r\nis fixed at four years; the salary of the individual who fills that\r\noffice cannot be altered during the term of his functions; he is\r\nprotected by a body of official dependents, and armed with a suspensive\r\nveto. In short, every effort was made to confer a strong and independent\r\nposition upon the executive authority, within the limits which had been\r\nprescribed to it.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of all the states the judicial power is that which\r\nremains the most independent of the legislative authority: nevertheless,\r\nin all the states the legislature has reserved to itself the right of\r\nregulating the emoluments of the judges, a practice which necessarily\r\nsubjects these magistrates to its immediate influence. In some states\r\nthe judges are only temporarily appointed, which deprives them of\r\na great portion of their power and their freedom. In others the\r\nlegislative and judicial powers are entirely confounded: thus the senate\r\nof New York, for instance, constitutes in certain cases the superior\r\ncourt of the state. The federal constitution, on the other hand,\r\ncarefully separates the judicial authority from all external influences:\r\nand it provides for the independence of the judges, by declaring that\r\ntheir salary shall not be altered, and that their functions shall be\r\ninalienable.\r\n\r\n[It is not universally correct, as supposed by the author, that the\r\nstate legislatures can deprive their governor of his salary at pleasure.\r\nIn the constitution of New York it is provided, that the governor \"shall\r\nreceive for his services a compensation which shall neither be increased\r\nnor diminished during the term for which he shall have been elected;\"\r\nand similar provisions are believed to exist in other states. Nor is the\r\nremark strictly correct, that the federal constitution \"provides for the\r\nindependence of the judges, by declaring that their salary shall not be\r\n_altered_.\" The provision of the constitution is, that they shall, \"at\r\nstated times, receive for their services a compensation which shall not\r\nbe diminished during their continuance in office.\"--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nThe practical consequences of these different systems may easily be\r\nperceived. An attentive observer will soon remark that the business of\r\nthe Union is incomparably better conducted than that of any individual\r\nstate. The conduct of the federal government is more fair and more\r\ntemperate than that of the states; its designs are more fraught with\r\nwisdom, its projects are more durable and more skilfully combined, its\r\nmeasures are put into execution with more vigor and consistency.\r\n\r\nI recapitulate the substance of this chapter in a few words:--\r\n\r\nThe existence of democracies is threatened by two dangers, viz.: the\r\ncomplete subjection of the legislative body to the caprices of\r\nthe electoral body; and the concentration of all the powers of the\r\ngovernment in the legislative authority.\r\n\r\nThe growth of these evils has been encouraged by the policy of the\r\nlegislators of the states; but it has been resisted by the legislators\r\nof the Union by every means which lay within their control.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS WHICH DISTINGUISH THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES OF AMERICA FROM ALL OTHER FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\nAmerican Union appears to resemble all other\r\nConfederations.--Nevertheless its Effects are different.--Reason of\r\nthis.--Distinctions between the Union and all other Confederations.--The\r\nAmerican Government not a Federal, but an imperfect National Government.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America do not afford either the first or the only\r\ninstance of confederate states, several of which have existed in modern\r\nEurope, without adverting to those of antiquity. Switzerland, the\r\nGermanic empire, and the republic of the United Provinces, either have\r\nbeen or still are confederations. In studying the constitutions of these\r\ndifferent countries, the politician is surprised to observe that the\r\npowers with which they invested the federal government are nearly\r\nidentical with the privileges awarded by the American constitution to\r\nthe government of the United States. They confer upon the central power\r\nthe same rights of making peace and war, of raising money and troops,\r\nand of providing for the general exigencies and the common interests\r\nof the nation. Nevertheless the federal government of these different\r\npeople has always been as remarkable for its weakness and inefficiency\r\nas that of the Union is for its vigorous and enterprising spirit. Again,\r\nthe first American confederation perished through the excessive weakness\r\nof its government; and this weak government was, notwithstanding, in\r\npossession of rights even more extensive than those of the federal\r\ngovernment of the present day. But the more recent constitution of\r\nthe United States contains certain principles which exercise a most\r\nimportant influence, although they do not at once strike the observer.\r\n\r\nThis constitution, which may at first sight be confounded with the\r\nfederal constitutions which preceded it, rests upon a novel theory,\r\nwhich may be considered as a great invention in modern political\r\nscience. In all the confederations which had been formed before the\r\nAmerican constitution of 1789, the allied states agreed to obey the\r\ninjunctions of a federal government: but they reserved to themselves the\r\nright of ordaining and enforcing the execution of the laws of the Union.\r\nThe American states which combined in 1789 agreed that the federal\r\ngovernment should not only dictate the laws, but it should execute its\r\nown enactments. In both cases the right is the same, but the exercise of\r\nthe right is different; and this alteration produced the most momentous\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nIn all the confederations which have been formed before the American\r\nUnion, the federal government demanded its supplies at the hands of the\r\nseparate governments; and if the measure it prescribed was onerous to\r\nany one of those bodies, means were found to evade its claims: if the\r\nstate was powerful, it had recourse to arms; if it was weak, it connived\r\nat the resistance which the law of the Union, its sovereign, met with,\r\nand resorted to inaction under the plea of inability. Under these\r\ncircumstances one of two alternatives has invariably occurred: either\r\nthe most preponderant of the allied peoples has assumed the privileges\r\nof the federal authority, and ruled all the other states in its\r\nname,[154] or the federal government has been abandoned by its natural\r\nsupporters, anarchy has arisen between the confederates, and the Union\r\nhas lost all power of action.[155]\r\n\r\nIn America the subjects of the Union are not states, but private\r\ncitizens: the national government levies a tax, not upon the state of\r\nMassachusetts, but upon each inhabitant of Massachusetts. All former\r\nconfederate governments presided over communities, but that of the Union\r\nrules individuals; its force is not borrowed, but self-derived; and it\r\nis served by its own civil and military officers, by its own army, and\r\nits own courts of justice. It cannot be doubted that the spirit of the\r\nnation, the passions of the multitude, and the provincial prejudices\r\nof each state, tend singularly to diminish the authority of a federal\r\nauthority thus constituted, and to facilitate the means of resistance to\r\nits mandates; but the comparative weakness of a restricted sovereignty\r\nis an evil inherent in the federal system. In America, each state\r\nhas fewer opportunities of resistance, and fewer temptations to\r\nnon-compliance; nor can such a design be put in execution (if indeed it\r\nbe entertained), without an open violation of the laws of the Union,\r\na direct interruption of the ordinary course of justice, and a bold\r\ndeclaration of revolt; in a word, without a decisive step, which men\r\nhesitate to adopt.\r\n\r\nIn all former confederations, the privileges of the Union furnished more\r\nelements of discord than of power, since they multiplied the claims\r\nof the nation without augmenting the means of enforcing them: and in\r\naccordance with this fact it may be remarked, that the real weakness of\r\nfederal governments has almost always been in the exact ratio of their\r\nnominal power. Such is not the case with the American Union, in which,\r\nas in ordinary governments, the federal government has the means of\r\nenforcing all it is empowered to demand.\r\n\r\nThe human understanding more easily invents new things than new words,\r\nand we are thence constrained to employ a multitude of improper and\r\ninadequate expressions. When several nations form a permanent league,\r\nand establish a supreme authority, which, although it has not the same\r\ninfluence over the members of the community as a national government,\r\nacts upon each of the confederate states in a body, this government,\r\nwhich is so essentially different from all others, is denominated a\r\nfederal one. Another form of society is afterward discovered, in which\r\nseveral peoples are fused into one and the same nation with regard to\r\ncertain common interests, although they remain distinct, or at least\r\nonly confederate, with regard to all their other concerns. In this case\r\nthe central power acts directly upon those whom it governs, whom it\r\nrules, and whom it judges, in the same manner as, but in a more limited\r\ncircle than, a national government. Here the term of federal government\r\nis clearly no longer applicable to a state of things which must be\r\nstyled an incomplete national government: a form of government has been\r\nfound out which is neither exactly national nor federal; but no farther\r\nprogress has been made, and the new word which will one day designate\r\nthis novel invention does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nThe absence of this new species of confederation has been the cause\r\nwhich has brought all unions to civil war, to subjection, or to a\r\nstagnant apathy; and the peoples which formed these leagues have been\r\neither too dull to discern, or too pusillanimous to apply this great\r\nremedy. The American confederation perished by the same defects.\r\n\r\nBut the confederate states of America had been long accustomed to form\r\na portion of one empire before they had won their independence: they\r\nhad not contracted the habit of governing themselves, and their national\r\nprejudices had not taken deep root in their minds. Superior to the rest\r\nof the world in political knowledge, and sharing that knowledge equally\r\namong themselves, they were little agitated by the passions which\r\ngenerally oppose the extension of federal authority in a nation, and\r\nthose passions were checked by the wisdom of the chief citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Americans applied the remedy with prudent firmness as soon as they\r\nwere conscious of the evil; they amended their laws, and they saved\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM IN GENERAL, AND ITS SPECIAL UTILITY IN\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nHappiness and Freedom of small Nations.--Power of Great Nations.--Great\r\nEmpires favorable to the Growth of Civilisation.--Strength often the\r\nfirst Element of national Prosperity.--Aim of the federal System to\r\nunite the twofold Advantages resulting from a small and from a\r\nlarge Territory.--Advantages derived by the United States from this\r\nSystem.--The Law adapts itself to the Exigencies of the Population;\r\nPopulation does not conform to the Exigencies of the Law.--Activity,\r\nMelioration, Love, and Enjoyment of Freedom in the American\r\nCommunities.--Public Spirit of the Union the abstract of provincial\r\nPatriotism.--Principles and Things circulate freely over the Territory\r\nof the United States.--The Union is happy and free as a little Nation,\r\nand respected as a great Empire.\r\n\r\nIn small nations the scrutiny of society penetrates into every part, and\r\nthe spirit of improvement enters into the most trifling details; as the\r\nambition of the people is necessarily checked by its weakness, all the\r\nefforts and resources of the citizens are turned to the internal benefit\r\nof the community, and are not likely to evaporate in the fleeting\r\nbreath of glory. The desires of every individual are limited, because\r\nextraordinary faculties are rarely to be met with. The gifts of an equal\r\nfortune render the various conditions of life uniform; and the manners\r\nof the inhabitants are orderly and simple. Thus, if we estimate the\r\ngradations of popular morality and enlightenment, we shall generally\r\nfind that in small nations there are more persons in easy circumstances,\r\na more numerous population, and a more tranquil state of society than in\r\ngreat empires.\r\n\r\nWhen tyranny is established in the bosom of a small nation, it is more\r\ngalling than elsewhere, because, as it acts within a narrow circle,\r\nevery point of that circle is subject to its direct influence. It\r\nsupplies the place of those great designs which it cannot entertain,\r\nby a violent or an exasperating interference in a multitude of minute\r\ndetails; and it leaves the political world to which it properly belongs,\r\nto meddle with the arrangements of domestic life. Tastes as well as\r\nactions are to be regulated at its pleasure; and the families of the\r\ncitizens as well as the affairs of the state are to be governed by its\r\ndecisions. This invasion of rights occurs, however, but seldom,\r\nand freedom is in truth the natural state of small communities. The\r\ntemptations which the government offers to ambition are too weak, and\r\nthe resources of private individuals are too slender, for the sovereign\r\npower easily to fall within the grasp of a single citizen: and should\r\nsuch an event have occurred, the subjects of the state can without\r\ndifficulty overthrow the tyrant and his oppression by a simultaneous\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nSmall nations have therefore ever been the cradles of political liberty:\r\nand the fact that many of them have lost their immunities by extending\r\ntheir dominion, shows that the freedom they enjoyed was more a\r\nconsequence of their inferior size than of the character of the people.\r\n\r\nThe history of the world affords no instance of a great nation retaining\r\nthe form of a republican government for a long series of years,[156]\r\nand this had led to the conclusion that such a state of things is\r\nimpracticable. For my own part, I cannot but censure the imprudence of\r\nattempting to limit the possible, and to judge the future, on the part\r\nof a being who is hourly deceived by the most palpable realities of\r\nlife, and who is constantly taken by surprise in the circumstances with\r\nwhich he is most familiar. But it may be advanced with confidence that\r\nthe existence of a great republic will always be exposed to far greater\r\nperils than that of a small one.\r\n\r\nAll the passions which are most fatal to republican institutions spread\r\nwith an increasing territory, while the virtues which maintain their\r\ndignity do not augment in the same proportion. The ambition of the\r\ncitizens increases with the power of the state; the strength of parties,\r\nwith the importance of the ends they have in view; but that devotion to\r\nthe common weal, which is the surest check on destructive passions, is\r\nnot stronger in a large than in a small republic. It might, indeed, be\r\nproved without difficulty that it is less powerful and less sincere. The\r\narrogance of wealth and the dejection of wretchedness, capital cities of\r\nunwonted extent, a lax morality, a vulgar egotism, and a great confusion\r\nof interests, are the dangers which almost invariably arise from the\r\nmagnitude of states. But several of these evils are scarcely prejudicial\r\nto a monarchy, and some of them contribute to maintain its existence.\r\nIn monarchical states the strength of the government is its own; it may\r\nuse, but it does not depend on, the community: and the authority of the\r\nprince is proportioned to the prosperity of the nation: but the only\r\nsecurity which a republican government possesses against these evils\r\nlies in the support of the majority. This support is not, however,\r\nproportionably greater in a large republic than it is in a small one;\r\nand thus while the means of attack perpetually increase both in number\r\nand in influence, the power of resistance remains the same; or it may\r\nrather be said to diminish, since the propensities and interests of\r\nthe people are diversified by the increase of the population, and the\r\ndifficulty of forming a compact majority is constantly augmented. It\r\nhas been observed, moreover, that the intensity of human passions is\r\nheightened, not only by the importance of the end which they propose to\r\nattain, but by the multitude of individuals who are animated by them at\r\nthe same time. Every one has had occasion to remark that his emotions\r\nin the midst of a sympathizing crowd are far greater than those which he\r\nwould have felt in solitude. In great republics the impetus of political\r\npassion is irresistible, not only because it aims at gigantic purposes,\r\nbut because it is felt and shared by millions of men at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be asserted as a general proposition, that nothing is\r\nmore opposed to the well-being and the freedom of man than vast empires.\r\nNevertheless it is important to acknowledge the peculiar advantages of\r\ngreat states. For the very reason which renders the desire of power more\r\nintense in these communities than among ordinary men, the love of glory\r\nis also more prominent in the hearts of a class of citizens, who regard\r\nthe applause of a great people as a reward worthy of their exertions,\r\nand an elevating encouragement to man. If we would learn why it is\r\nthat great nations contribute more powerfully to the spread of human\r\nimprovement than small states, we shall discover an adequate cause in\r\nthe rapid and energetic circulation of ideas, and in those great cities\r\nwhich are the intellectual centres where all the rays of human genius\r\nare reflected and combined. To this it may be added that most important\r\ndiscoveries demand a display of national power which the government of\r\na small state is unable to make; in great nations the government\r\nentertains a greater number of general notions, and is more completely\r\ndisengaged from the routine of precedent and the egotism of local\r\nprejudice; its designs are conceived with more talent, and executed with\r\nmore boldness.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace the well-being of small nations is undoubtedly more\r\ngeneral and more complete; but they are apt to suffer more acutely from\r\nthe calamities of war than those great empires whose distant frontiers\r\nmay for ages avert the presence of the danger from the mass of the\r\npeople, which is more frequently afflicted than ruined by the evil.\r\n\r\nBut in this matter, as in many others, the argument derived from the\r\nnecessity of the case predominates over all others. If none but small\r\nnations existed, I do not doubt that mankind would be more happy and\r\nmore free; but the existence of great nations is unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThis consideration introduces the element of physical strength as a\r\ncondition of national prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt profits a people but little to be affluent and free, if it is\r\nperpetually exposed to be pillaged or subjugated; the number of its\r\nmanufactures and the extent of its commerce are of small advantage, if\r\nanother nation has the empire of the seas and gives the law in all the\r\nmarkets of the globe. Small nations are often impoverished, not because\r\nthey are small, but because they are weak; and great empires prosper\r\nless because they are great than because they are strong. Physical\r\nstrength is therefore one of the first conditions of the happiness and\r\neven of the existence of nations. Hence it occurs, that unless very\r\npeculiar circumstances intervene, small nations are always united to\r\nlarge empires in the end, either by force or by their own consent; yet\r\nI am unacquainted with a more deplorable spectacle than that of a people\r\nunable either to defend or to maintain its independence.\r\n\r\nThe federal system was created with the intention of combining the\r\ndifferent advantages which result from the greater and the lesser\r\nextent of nations; and a single glance over the United States of America\r\nsuffices to discover the advantages which they have derived from its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nIn great centralized nations the legislator is obliged to impart a\r\ncharacter of uniformity to the laws, which does not always suit the\r\ndiversity of customs and of districts; as he takes no cognizance of\r\nspecial cases, he can only proceed upon general principles; and the\r\npopulation is obliged to conform to the exigencies of the legislation,\r\nsince the legislation cannot adapt itself to the exigencies and customs\r\nof the population; which is the cause of endless trouble and misery.\r\nThis disadvantage does not exist in confederations; congress regulates\r\nthe principal measures of the national government, and all the details\r\nof the administration are reserved to the provincial legislatures. It is\r\nimpossible to imaging how much this division of sovereignty contributes\r\nto the well-being of each of the states which compose the Union. In\r\nthese small communities, which are never agitated by the desire of\r\naggrandizement or the cares of self-defence, all public authority\r\nand private energy is employed in internal melioration. The central\r\ngovernment of each state, which is in immediate juxtaposition to the\r\ncitizens, is daily apprised of the wants which arise in society; and\r\nnew projects are proposed every year, which are discussed either\r\nat town-meetings or by the legislature of the state, and which are\r\ntransmitted by the press to stimulate the zeal and to excite the\r\ninterest of the citizens. This spirit of melioration is constantly alive\r\nin the American republics, without compromising their tranquillity; the\r\nambition of power yields to the less refined and less dangerous love of\r\ncomfort. It is generally believed in America that the existence and the\r\npermanence of the republican form of government in the New World depend\r\nupon the existence and the permanence of the federal system; and it is\r\nnot unusual to attribute a large share of the misfortunes which have\r\nbefallen the new states of South America to the injudicious erection of\r\ngreat republics, instead of a divided and confederate sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is incontestably true that the love and the habits of republican\r\ngovernment in the United States were engendered in the townships and in\r\nthe provincial assemblies. In a small state, like that of Connecticut\r\nfor instance, where cutting a canal or laying down a road is a momentous\r\npolitical question, where the state has no army to pay and no wars to\r\ncarry on, and where much wealth and much honor cannot be bestowed upon\r\nthe chief citizens, no form of government can be more natural or more\r\nappropriate than that of a republic. But it is this same republican\r\nspirit, it is these manners and customs of a free people, which are\r\nengendered and nurtured in the different states, to be afterward applied\r\nto the country at large. The public spirit of the Union is, so to speak,\r\nnothing more than an abstract of the patriotic zeal of the provinces.\r\nEvery citizen of the United States transfuses his attachment to his\r\nlittle republic into the common store of American patriotism. In\r\ndefending the Union, he defends the increasing prosperity of his own\r\ndistrict, the right of conducting its affairs, and the hope of causing\r\nmeasures of improvement to be adopted which may be favorable to his own\r\ninterests; and these are motives which are wont to stir men more readily\r\nthan the general interests of the country and the glory of the nation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the temper and the manners of the inhabitants\r\nespecially fitted them to promote the welfare of a great republic, the\r\nfederal system smoothed the obstacles which they might have encountered.\r\nThe confederation of all the American states presents none of the\r\nordinary disadvantages resulting from great agglomerations of men. The\r\nUnion is a great republic in extent, but the paucity of objects for\r\nwhich its government provides assimilates it to a small state. Its acts\r\nare important, but they are rare. As the sovereignty of the Union is\r\nlimited and incomplete, its exercise is not incompatible with liberty;\r\nfor it does not excite those insatiable desires of fame and power which\r\nhave proved so fatal to great republics. As there is no common centre to\r\nthe country, vast capital cities, colossal wealth, abject poverty, and\r\nsudden revolutions are alike unknown; and political passion, instead\r\nof spreading over the land like a torrent of desolation, spends its\r\nstrength against the interests and the individual passions of every\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all commodities and ideas circulate throughout the Union\r\nas freely as in a country inhabited by one people. Nothing checks the\r\nspirit of enterprise. The government avails itself of the assistance of\r\nall who have talents or knowledge to serve it. Within the frontiers of\r\nthe Union the profoundest peace prevails, as within the heart of some\r\ngreat empire; abroad, it ranks with the most powerful nations of the\r\nearth: two thousand miles of coast are open to the commerce of the\r\nworld; and as it possesses the keys of the globe, its flag is respected\r\nin the most remote seas. The Union is as happy and as free as a small\r\npeople, and as glorious and as strong as a great nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHY THE FEDERAL SYSTEM IS NOT ADAPTED TO ALL PEOPLES, AND HOW THE\r\nANGLO-AMERICANS WERE ENABLED TO ADOPT IT.\r\n\r\nEvery federal System contains defects which baffle the efforts of the\r\nLegislator.--The federal System is complex.--It demands a daily Exercise\r\nof Discretion on the Part of the Citizens.--Practical knowledge of\r\nthe Government common among the Americans.--Relative weakness of\r\nthe Government of the Union another defect inherent in the federal\r\nSystem.--The Americans have diminished without remedying it.--The\r\nSovereignty of the separate States apparently weaker, but really\r\nstronger, than that of the Union.--Why.--Natural causes of Union must\r\nexist between confederate Peoples beside the Laws.--What these Causes\r\nare among the Anglo-Americans.--Maine and Georgia, separated by a\r\nDistance of a thousand Miles, more naturally united than Normandy and\r\nBritany.--War, the main Peril of Confederations.--This proved even\r\nby the Example of the United States.--The Union has no great Wars to\r\nfear.--Why.--Dangers to which Europeans would be exposed if they adopted\r\nthe federal System of the Americans.\r\n\r\nWhen a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exercising an\r\nindirect influence upon the destiny of nations, his genius is lauded\r\nby mankind, while in point of fact, the geographical position of the\r\ncountry which he is unable to change, a social condition which arose\r\nwithout his co-operation, manners and opinions which he cannot trace to\r\ntheir source, and an origin with which he is unacquainted, exercise\r\nso irresistible an influence over the courses of society, that he is\r\nhimself borne away by the current, after an ineffectual resistance. Like\r\nthe navigator, he may direct the vessel which bears him along, but he\r\ncan neither change its structure, nor raise the winds, nor lull the\r\nwaters which swell beneath him.\r\n\r\nI have shown the advantages which the Americans derive from their\r\nfederal system; it remains for me to point out the circumstances which\r\nrender that system practicable, as its benefits are not to be enjoyed\r\nby all nations. The incidental defects of the federal system which\r\noriginate in the laws may be corrected by the skill of the legislator,\r\nbut there are farther evils inherent in the system which cannot be\r\ncounteracted by the peoples which adopt it. These nations must therefore\r\nfind the strength necessary to support the natural imperfections of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent evil of all federal systems is the very complex\r\nnature of the means they employ. Two sovereignties are necessarily in\r\nthe presence of each other. The legislator may simplify and equalize the\r\naction of these two sovereignties, by limiting each of them to a sphere\r\nof authority accurately defined; but he cannot combine them into one, or\r\nprevent them from running into collision at certain points. The federal\r\nsystem therefore rests upon a theory which is necessarily complicated,\r\nand which demands the daily exercise of a considerable share of\r\ndiscretion on the part of those it governs.\r\n\r\nA proposition must be plain to be adopted by the understanding of a\r\npeople. A false notion, which is clear and precise, will always meet\r\nwith a greater number of adherents in the world than a true principle\r\nwhich is obscure or involved. Hence it arises that parties, which are\r\nlike small communities in the heart of the nation, invariably adopt some\r\nprinciple or some name as a symbol, which very inadequately represents\r\nthe end they have in view, and the means which are at their disposal,\r\nbut without which they could neither act nor subsist. The governments\r\nwhich are founded upon a single principle or a single feeling which is\r\neasily defined, are perhaps not the best, but they are unquestionably\r\nthe strongest and the most durable in the world.\r\n\r\nIn examining the constitution of the United States, which is the most\r\nperfect federal constitution that ever existed, one is startled, on\r\nthe other hand, at the variety of information and the excellence of\r\ndiscretion which it presupposes in the people whom it is meant to\r\ngovern. The government of the Union depends entirely upon legal\r\nfictions; the Union is an ideal notion which only exists in the mind,\r\nand whose limits and extent can only be discerned by the understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen once the general theory is comprehended, numerous difficulties\r\nremain to be solved in its application; for the sovereignty of the\r\nUnion is so involved in that of the states, that it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish its boundaries at the first glance. The whole structure\r\nof the government is artificial and conventional; and it would be\r\nill-adapted to a people which has not long been accustomed to conduct\r\nits own affairs, or to one in which the science of politics has not\r\ndescended to the humblest classes of society. I have never been more\r\nstruck by the good sense and the practical judgment of the Americans\r\nthan in the ingenious devices by which they elude the numberless\r\ndifficulties resulting from their federal constitution. I scarcely\r\never met with a plain American citizen who could not distinguish, with\r\nsurprising facility, the obligations created by the laws of congress\r\nfrom those created by the laws of his own state; and who, after having\r\ndiscriminated between the matters which come under the cognizance of the\r\nUnion, and those which the local legislature is competent to regulate,\r\ncould not point out the exact limit of the several jurisdictions of the\r\nfederal courts and the tribunals of the state.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the United States is like those exquisite\r\nproductions of human industry which ensure wealth and renown to their\r\ninventors, but which are profitless in any other hands. This truth is\r\nexemplified by the condition of Mexico at the present time. The Mexicans\r\nwere desirous of establishing a federal system, and they took the\r\nfederal constitution of their neighbors the Anglo-Americans as their\r\nmodel, and copied it with considerable accuracy.[157] But although they\r\nhad borrowed the letter of the law, they were unable to create or\r\nto introduce the spirit and the sense which gave it life. They were\r\ninvolved in ceaseless embarrassments between the mechanism of their\r\ndouble government; the sovereignty of the states and that of the Union\r\nperpetually exceeded their respective privileges, and entered into\r\ncollision; and to the present day Mexico is alternately the victim of\r\nanarchy and the slave of military despotism.\r\n\r\nThe second and the most fatal of all the defects I have alluded to,\r\nand that which I believe to be inherent in the federal system, is the\r\nrelative weakness of the government of the Union. The principle upon\r\nwhich all confederations rest is that of a divided sovereignty. The\r\nlegislator may render this partition less perceptible, he may even\r\nconceal it for a time from the public eye, but he cannot prevent it from\r\nexisting; and a divided sovereignty must always be less powerful than an\r\nentire supremacy. The reader has seen in the remarks I have made on the\r\nconstitution of the United States, that the Americans have displayed\r\nsingular ingenuity in combining the restriction of the power of the\r\nUnion within the narrow limits of the federal government, with the\r\nsemblance, and to a certain extent with the force of a national\r\ngovernment. By this means the legislators of the Union have succeeded\r\nin diminishing, though not in counteracting, the natural danger of\r\nconfederations.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the American government does not apply itself\r\nto the states, but that it immediately transmits its injunctions to the\r\ncitizens, and compels them as isolated individuals to comply with its\r\ndemands. But if the federal law were to clash with the interests and\r\nprejudices of a state, it might be feared that all the citizens of\r\nthat state would conceive themselves to be interested in the cause of a\r\nsingle individual who should refuse to obey. If all the citizens of\r\nthe state were aggrieved at the same time and in the same manner by the\r\nauthority of the Union, the federal government would vainly attempt to\r\nsubdue them individually; they would instinctively unite in the common\r\ndefence, and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from the\r\nshare of sovereignty which the institution of their state allows them\r\nto enjoy. Fiction would give way to reality, and an organized portion of\r\nthe territory might then contest the central authority.\r\n\r\nThe same observation holds good with regard to the federal jurisdiction.\r\nIf the courts of the Union violated an important law of a state in a\r\nprivate case, the real, if not the apparent contest would arise\r\nbetween the aggrieved state, represented by a citizen, and the Union,\r\nrepresented by its courts of justice.[158]\r\n\r\nHe would have but a partial knowledge of the world who should imagine\r\nthat it is possible, by the aid of legal fictions, to prevent men from\r\nfinding out and employing those means of gratifying their passions which\r\nhave been left open to them; and it may be doubted whether the\r\nAmerican legislators, when they rendered a collision between the two\r\nsovereignties less probable, destroyed the causes of such a misfortune.\r\nBut it may even be affirmed that they were unable to ensure the\r\npreponderance of the federal element in a case of this kind. The\r\nUnion is possessed of money and of troops, but the affections and the\r\nprejudices of the people are in the bosom of the states. The sovereignty\r\nof the Union is an abstract being, which is connected with but few\r\nexternal objects; the sovereignty of the states is hourly perceptible,\r\neasily understood, constantly active; and if the former is of recent\r\ncreation, the latter is coeval with the people itself. The sovereignty\r\nof the Union is factitious, that of the states is natural, and derives\r\nits existence from its own simple influence, like the authority of a\r\nparent. The supreme power of the nation affects only a few of the chief\r\ninterests of society; it represents an immense but remote country, and\r\nclaims a feeling of patriotism which is vague and ill-defined; but the\r\nauthority of the states controls every individual citizen at every hour\r\nand in all circumstances; it protects his property, his freedom, and his\r\nlife; and when we recollect the traditions, the customs, the prejudices\r\nof local and familiar attachment with which it is connected, we\r\ncannot doubt the superiority of a power which is interwoven with every\r\ncircumstance that renders the love of one's native country instinctive\r\nto the human heart.\r\n\r\nSince legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous collisions\r\nas occur between the two sovereignties which co-exist in the federal\r\nsystem, their first object must be, not only to dissuade the confederate\r\nstates from warfare, but to encourage such institutions as may promote\r\nthe maintenance of peace. Hence it results that the federal compact\r\ncannot be lasting unless there exists in the communities which are\r\nleagued together, a certain number of inducements to union which render\r\ntheir common dependance agreeable, and the task of the government\r\nlight; and that system cannot succeed without the presence of favorable\r\ncircumstances added to the influence of good laws. All the people which\r\nhave ever formed a confederation have been held together by a certain\r\nnumber of common interests, which served as the intellectual ties of\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nBut the sentiments and the principles of man must be taken into\r\nconsideration as well as his immediate interest. A certain uniformity of\r\ncivilisation is not less necessary to the durability of a confederation,\r\nthan a uniformity of interests in the states which compose it. In\r\nSwitzerland the difference which exists between the canton of Uri and\r\nthe canton of Vaud is equal to that between the fifteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies; and, properly speaking, Switzerland has never possessed a\r\nfederal government. The Union between these two cantons only subsists\r\nupon the map; and their discrepancies would soon be perceived if an\r\nattempt were made by a central authority to prescribe the same laws to\r\nthe whole territory.\r\n\r\nOne of the circumstances which most powerfully contribute to support the\r\nfederal government in America, is that the states have not only similar\r\ninterests, a common origin, and a common tongue, but that they are also\r\narrived at the same stage of civilisation; which almost always renders\r\na union feasible. I do not know of any European nation, how small soever\r\nit may be, which does not present less uniformity in its different\r\nprovinces than the American people, which occupies a territory as\r\nextensive as one half of Europe. The distance from the state of Maine\r\nto that of Georgia is reckoned at about one thousand miles; but the\r\ndifference between the civilisation of Maine and that of Georgia is\r\nslighter than the difference between the habits of Normandy and those of\r\nBritany. Maine and Georgia, which are placed at the opposite extremities\r\nof a great empire, are consequently in the natural possession of more\r\nreal inducements to form a confederation than Normandy and Britany,\r\nwhich are only separated by a bridge.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the country contributed to increase the\r\nfacilities which the American legislators derived from the manners and\r\ncustoms of the inhabitants; and it is to this circumstance that\r\nthe adoption and the maintenance of the federal system are mainly\r\nattributable.\r\n\r\nThe most important occurrence which can mark the annals of a people is\r\nthe breaking out of a war. In war a people struggle with the energy of\r\na single man against foreign nations, in the defence of its very\r\nexistence. The skill of a government, the good sense of the community,\r\nand the natural fondness which men entertain for their country, may\r\nsuffice to maintain peace in the interior of a district, and to favor\r\nits internal prosperity; but a nation can only carry on a great war at\r\nthe cost of more numerous and more painful sacrifices; and to suppose\r\nthat a great number of men will of their own accord comply with the\r\nexigencies of the state, is to betray an ignorance of mankind. All the\r\npeoples which have been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare\r\nhave consequently been led to augment the power of their government.\r\nThose which have not succeeded in this attempt have been subjugated.\r\nA long war almost always places nations in the wretched alternative\r\nof being abandoned to ruin by defeat, or to despotism by success. War\r\ntherefore renders the symptoms of the weakness of a government most\r\npalpable and most alarming; and I have shown that the inherent defect of\r\nfederal governments is that of being weak.\r\n\r\nThe federal system is not only deficient in every kind of centralized\r\nadministration, but the central government itself is imperfectly\r\norganized, which is invariably an influential cause of inferiority when\r\nthe nation is opposed to other countries which are themselves governed\r\nby a single authority. In the federal constitution of the United States,\r\nby which the central government possesses more real force, this evil\r\nis still extremely sensible. An example will illustrate the case to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThe constitution confers upon congress the right of \"calling forth\r\nmilitia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and\r\nrepel invasions;\" and another article declares that the president of the\r\nUnited States is the commander-in-chief of the militia. In the war of\r\n1812, the president ordered the militia of the northern states to march\r\nto the frontiers; but Connecticut and Massachusetts, whose interests\r\nwere impaired by the war, refused to obey the command. They argued that\r\nthe constitution authorizes the federal government to call forth the\r\nmilitia in cases of insurrection or invasion, but that, in the present\r\ninstance, there was neither invasion nor insurrection. They added,\r\nthat the same constitution which conferred upon the Union the right of\r\ncalling forth the militia, reserved to the states that of naming the\r\nofficers; and that consequently (as they understood the clause) no\r\nofficer of the Union had any right to command the militia, even during\r\nwar, except the president in person: and in this case they were ordered\r\nto join an army commanded by another individual. These absurd and\r\npernicious doctrines received the sanction not only of the governors and\r\nlegislative bodies, but also of the courts of justice in both states;\r\nand the federal government was constrained to raise elsewhere the troops\r\nwhich it required.[159]\r\n\r\nThe only safeguard which the American Union, with all the relative\r\nperfection of its laws, possesses against the dissolution which would\r\nbe produced by a great war, lies in its probable exemption from that\r\ncalamity. Placed in the centre of an immense continent, which offers\r\na boundless field for human industry, the Union is almost as much\r\ninsulated from the world as if its frontiers were girt by the ocean.\r\nCanada contains only a million of inhabitants, and its population is\r\ndivided into two inimical nations. The rigor of the climate limits the\r\nextension of its territory, and shuts up its ports during the six months\r\nof winter. From Canada to the Gulf of Mexico a few savage tribes are\r\nto be met with, which retire, perishing in their retreat, before six\r\nthousand soldiers. To the south, the Union has a point of contact with\r\nthe empire of Mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities may one\r\nday be expected to arise. But for a long while to come, the uncivilized\r\nstate of the Mexican community, the depravity of its morals, and its\r\nextreme poverty, will prevent that country from ranking high among\r\nnations. As for the powers of Europe, they are too distant to be\r\nformidable.[160]\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of the United States does not, then, consist in a\r\nfederal constitution which allows them to carry on great wars, but in a\r\ngeographical position, which renders such enterprises improbable.\r\n\r\nNo one can be more inclined than I am myself to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of the federal system, which I hold to be one of the\r\ncombinations most favorable to the prosperity and freedom of man. I\r\nenvy the lot of those nations which have been enabled to adopt it; but I\r\ncannot believe that any confederate peoples could maintain a long or an\r\nequal contest with a nation of similar strength in which the government\r\nshould be centralised. A people which should divide its sovereignty into\r\nfractional powers, in the presence of the great military monarchies of\r\nEurope, would, in my opinion, by that very act, abdicate its power, and\r\nperhaps its existence and its name. But such is the admirable position\r\nof the New World, that man has no other enemy than himself; and that\r\nin order to be happy and to be free, it suffices to seek the gifts of\r\nprosperity and the knowledge of freedom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[119] See the constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n[120] See the articles of the first confederation formed in 1778. This\r\nconstitution was not adopted by all the states until 1781. See also the\r\nanalysis given of this constitution in the Federalist, from No. 15 to\r\nNo. 22 inclusive, and Story's \"Commentary on the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States,\" pp. 85-115.\r\n\r\n[121] Congress made this declaration on the 21st of February, 1787.\r\n\r\n[122] It consisted of fifty-five members: Washington, Madison, Hamilton,\r\nand the two Morrises, were among the number.\r\n\r\n[123] It was not adopted by the legislative bodies, but representatives\r\nwere elected by the people for this sole purpose; and the new\r\nconstitution was discussed at length in each of these assemblies.\r\n\r\n[124] See the amendment to the federal constitution; Federalist, No. 32.\r\nStory, p. 711. Kent's Commentaries, Vol. i., p. 364.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that whenever the _exclusive_ right of regulating\r\ncertain matters is not reserved to congress by the constitution, the\r\nstates may take up the affair, until it is brought before the national\r\nassembly. For instance, congress has the right of making a general law\r\nof bankruptcy, which, however, it neglects to do. Each state is then\r\nat liberty to make a law for itself. This point, however, has been\r\nestablished by discussion in the law-courts, and may be said to belong\r\nmore properly to jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n[125] The action of this court is indirect, as we shall hereafter show.\r\n\r\n[126] It is thus that the Federalist, No. 45, explains the division of\r\nsupremacy between the union and the states: \"The powers delegated by the\r\nconstitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which\r\nare to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite. The\r\nformer will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace,\r\nnegotiation, and foreign commerce. The powers reserved to the several\r\nstates will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of\r\naffairs, concern the internal order and prosperity of the state.\"\r\n\r\nI shall often have occasion to quote the Federalist in this work. When\r\nthe bill which has since become the constitution of the United States\r\nwas submitted to the approval of the people, and the discussions were\r\nstill pending, three men who had already acquired a portion of that\r\ncelebrity which they have since enjoyed, John Jay, Hamilton, and\r\nMadison, formed an association with the intention of explaining to the\r\nnation the advantages of the measure which was proposed. With this view\r\nthey published a series of articles in the shape of a journal, which now\r\nform a complete treatise. They entitled their journal, \"The Federalist,\"\r\na name which has been retained in the work. The Federalist is an\r\nexcellent book, which ought to be familiar to the statesmen of all\r\ncountries, although it especially concerns America.\r\n\r\n[127] See constitution, sect. 8. Federalist, Nos. 41 and 42. Kent's\r\nCommentaries, vol. i., p. 207. Story, pp. 358-382; 409-426.\r\n\r\n[128] Several other privileges of the same kind exist, such as that\r\nwhich empowers the Union to legislate on bankruptcy, to grant patents,\r\nand other matters in which its intervention is clearly necessary.\r\n\r\n[129] Even in these cases its interference is indirect. The Union\r\ninterferes by means of the tribunals, as will be hereafter shown.\r\n\r\n[130] Federal Constitution, sect. 10, art. 1.\r\n\r\n[131] Constitution, sect. 8, 9, and 10.

Kent's Commentaries, vol. i., pp. 207 and 381.\r\nStory pp. 329 and 514.\r\n\r\n[132] Every ten years congress fixes anew the number of representatives\r\nwhich each state is to furnish. The total number was 69 in 1789, and 240\r\nin 1833. (See American Almanac, 1834, p. 194.)\r\n\r\nThe constitution decided that there should not be more than one\r\nrepresentative for every 30,000 persons; but no minimum was fixed\r\nupon. The congress has not thought fit to augment the number of\r\nrepresentatives in proportion to the increase of population. The first\r\nact which was passed on the subject (14th April, 1792: see Laws of the\r\nUnited States, by Story, vol. i., p. 235) decided that there should be\r\none representative for every 33,000 inhabitants. The last act, which was\r\npassed in 1822, fixes the proportion at one for 48,000. The population\r\nrepresented is composed of all the freemen and of three-fifths of the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n[133] See the Federalist, Nos. 52-66, inclusive. Story, pp. 199-314\r\nConstitution of the United States, sections 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n[134] See the Federalist, Nos. 67-77. Constitution of the United States,\r\na. t. 2. Story, pp. 115; 515-780. Kent's Commentaries, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[135] The constitution had left it doubtful whether the president\r\nwas obliged to consult the senate in the removal as well as in the\r\nappointment of federal officers. The Federalist (No. 77) seemed to\r\nestablish the affirmative; but in 1789, congress formally decided that\r\nas the president was responsible for his actions, he ought not to\r\nbe forced to employ agents who had forfeited his esteem. See Kent's\r\nCommentaries, vol. i., p. 289.\r\n\r\n[136] The sums annually paid by the state to these officers amount to\r\n200,000,000 francs (eight millions sterling).\r\n\r\n[137] This number is extracted from the \"National Calendar,\" for 1833.\r\nThe National Calendar is an American almanac which contains the names of\r\nall the federal officers.\r\n\r\nIt results from this comparison that the king of France has eleven times\r\nas many places at his disposal as the president, although the population\r\nof France is not much more than double that of the Union.\r\n\r\n[138] As many as it sends members to congress. The number of electors at\r\nthe election of 1833 was 288. (See the National Calendar, 1833.)\r\n\r\n[139] The electors of the same state assemble, but they transmit to the\r\ncentral government the list of their individual votes, and not the mere\r\nresult of the vote of the majority.\r\n\r\n[140] In this case it is the majority of the states, and not the\r\nmajority of the members, which decides the question; so that New\r\nYork has not more influence in the debate than Rhode Island. Thus the\r\ncitizens of the Union are first consulted as members of one and the same\r\ncommunity; and, if they cannot agree, recourse is had to the division of\r\nthe states, each of which has a separate and independent vote. This is\r\none of the singularities of the federal constitution which can only be\r\nexplained by the jar of conflicting interests.\r\n\r\n[141] Jefferson, in 1801, was not elected until the thirty-sixth time of\r\nballoting.\r\n\r\n[142] See chapter vi., entitled, \"Judicial Power in the United States.\"\r\nThis chapter explains the general principles of the American theory of\r\njudicial institutions. See also the federal constitution, art. 3.\r\nSee the Federalist, Nos. 78-83, inclusive: and a work entitled,\r\n\"Constitutional Law, being a View of the Practice and Jurisdiction of\r\nthe Courts of the United States,\" by Thomas Sergeant. See Story, pp.\r\n134, 162, 489, 511, 581, 668; and the organic law of the 24th September,\r\n1789, in the collection of the laws of the United States, by Story, vol.\r\ni., p. 53.\r\n\r\n[143] Federal laws are those which most require courts of justice, and\r\nthose at the same time which have most rarely established them. The\r\nreason is that confederations have usually been formed by independent\r\nstates, which entertained no real intention of obeying the central\r\ngovernment, and which very readily ceded the right of commanding to\r\nthe federal executive, and very prudently reserved the right of\r\nnon-compliance to themselves.\r\n\r\n[144] The Union was divided into districts, in each of which a resident\r\nfederal judge was appointed, and the court in which he presided was\r\ntermed a \"district court.\" Each of the judges of the supreme court\r\nannually visits a certain portion of the Republic, in order to try the\r\nmost important causes upon the spot; the court presided over by this\r\nmagistrate is styled a \"circuit court.\" Lastly, all the most serious\r\ncases of litigation are brought before the supreme court, which holds\r\na solemn session once a year, at which all the judges of the circuit\r\ncourts must attend. The jury was introduced into the federal courts in\r\nthe same manner, and in the same cases as into the courts of the states.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that no analogy exists between the supreme court\r\nof the United States and the French cour de cassation, since the latter\r\nonly hears appeals. The supreme court decides upon the evidence of the\r\nfact, as well as upon the law of the case, whereas the cour de cassation\r\ndoes not pronounce a decision of its own, but refers the cause to the\r\narbitration of another tribunal. See the law of 24th September, 1789,\r\nlaws of the United States, by Story, vol. i., p. 53.\r\n\r\n[145] In order to diminish the number of these suits, it was decided\r\nthat in a great many federal causes, the courts of the states should be\r\nempowered to decide conjointly with those of the Union, the losing party\r\nhaving then a right of appeal to the supreme court of the United States.\r\nThe supreme court of Virginia contested the right of the supreme\r\ncourt of the United States to judge an appeal from its decisions, but\r\nunsuccessfully. See Kent's Commentaries, vol. i., pp. 350, 370, _et\r\nseq._; Story's Commentaries, p. 646; and \"The Organic Law of the United\r\nStates,\" vol. i., p. 35\r\n\r\n[146] The constitution also says that the federal courts shall decide\r\n\"controversies between a state and the citizens of another state.\" And\r\nhere a most important question of a constitutional nature arose, which\r\nwas, whether the jurisdiction given by the constitution in cases in\r\nwhich a state is a party, extended to suits brought _against_ a state\r\nas well as _by_ it, or was exclusively confined to the latter. This\r\nquestion was most elaborately considered in the case of _Chisholme_ v.\r\n_Georgia_, and was decided by the majority of the supreme court in the\r\naffirmative. The decision created general alarm among the states, and\r\nan amendment was proposed and ratified by which the power was entirely\r\ntaken away so far as it regards suits brought against a state. See\r\nStory's Commentaries, p. 624, or in the large edition, § 1677.\r\n\r\n[147] As, for instance, all cases of piracy.\r\n\r\n[148] This principle was in some measure restricted by the introduction\r\nof the several states as independent powers into the senate, and by\r\nallowing them to vote separately in the house of representatives when\r\nthe president is elected by that body; but these are exceptions, and the\r\ncontrary principle is the rule.\r\n\r\n[149] It is perfectly clear, says Mr. Story (Commentaries, p. 503, or in\r\nthe large edition, § 1379), that any law which enlarges, abridges, or\r\nin any manner changes the intention of the parties, resulting from the\r\nstipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it. He gives in the\r\nsame place a very long and careful definition of what is understood by\r\na contract in federal jurisprudence. A grant made by the state to a\r\nprivate individual, and accepted by him, is a contract, and cannot be\r\nrevoked by any future law. A charter granted by the state to a company\r\nis a contract, and equally binding to the state as to the grantee. The\r\nclause of the constitution here referred to ensures, therefore, the\r\nexistence of a great part of acquired rights, but not of all. Property\r\nmay legally be held, though it may not have passed into the possessor's\r\nhands by means of a contract; and its possession is an acquired right,\r\nnot guaranteed by the federal constitution.\r\n\r\n[150] A remarkable instance of this is given by Mr. Story (p. 508, or in\r\nthe large edition, § 1388). \"Dartmouth college in New Hampshire had been\r\nfounded by a charter granted to certain individuals before the American\r\nrevolution, and its trustees formed a corporation under this charter.\r\nThe legislature of New Hampshire had, without the consent of this\r\ncorporation, passed an act changing the organization of the original\r\nprovincial charter of the college, and transferring all the rights,\r\nprivileges, and franchises, from the old charter trustees to new\r\ntrustees appointed under the act. The constitutionality of the act was\r\ncontested, and after solemn arguments, it was deliberately held by the\r\nsupreme court that the provincial charter was a contract within the\r\nmeaning of the constitution (art. i, sect. 10), and that the amendatory\r\nact was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of that charter. The\r\ncollege was deemed, like other colleges of private foundation, to be a\r\nprivate eleemosynary institution, endowed by its charter with a capacity\r\nto take property unconnected with the government. Its funds were\r\nbestowed upon the faith of the charter, and those funds consisted\r\nentirely of private donations. It is true that the uses were in some\r\nsense public, that is, for the general benefit, and not for the mere\r\nbenefit of the corporators; but this did not make the corporation a\r\npublic corporation. It was a private institution for general charity. It\r\nwas not distinguishable in principle from a private donation, vested in\r\nprivate trustees, for a public charity, or for a particular purpose\r\nof beneficence. And the state itself, if it had bestowed funds upon a\r\ncharity of the same nature, could not resume those funds.\"\r\n\r\n[151] See chapter vi., on judicial power in America.\r\n\r\n[152] See Kent's Commentaries, vol. i., p. 387.\r\n\r\n[153] At this time Alexander Hamilton, who was one of the principal\r\nfounders of the constitution, ventured to express the following\r\nsentiments in the Federalist, No. 71: \"There are some who would be\r\ninclined to regard the servile pliancy of the executive to a prevailing\r\ncurrent, either in the community or in the legislature, as its best\r\nrecommendation. But such men entertain very crude notions, as well of\r\nthe purpose for which government was instituted, as of the true means\r\nby which the public happiness may be promoted. The republican principle\r\ndemands that the deliberative sense of the community should govern the\r\nconduct of those to whom they intrust the managements of their affairs;\r\nbut it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden\r\nbreeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may\r\nreceive from the arts of men who flatter their prejudices to betray\r\ntheir interests. It is a just observation that the people commonly\r\n_intend_ the _public good_. This often applies to their very errors. But\r\ntheir good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they\r\nwould always _reason right_, about the _means_ of promoting it. They\r\nknow from experience that they sometimes err; and the wonder is that\r\nthey so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually are, by the\r\nwiles of parasites and sycophants; by the snares of the ambitious, the\r\navaricious, the desperate; by the artifices of men who possess their\r\nconfidence more than they deserve it; and of those who seek to possess\r\nrather than to deserve it. When occasions present themselves in which\r\nthe interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it\r\nis the duty of persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of\r\nthose interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give\r\nthem time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. Instances\r\nmight be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from\r\nvery fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured lasting\r\nmonuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity\r\nenough to serve at the peril of their displeasure.\"\r\n\r\n[154] This was the case in Greece, when Philip undertook to execute the\r\ndecree of the Amphictyons; in the Low Countries, where the province\r\nof Holland always gave the law; and in our time in the Germanic\r\nconfederation, in which Austria and Prussia assume a great degree of\r\ninfluence over the whole country, in the name of the Diet.\r\n\r\n[155] Such has always been the situation of the Swiss confederation,\r\nwhich would have perished ages ago but for the mutual jealousies of its\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n[156] I do not speak of a confederation of small republics, but of a\r\ngreat consolidated republic.\r\n\r\n[157] See the Mexican constitution of 1824.\r\n\r\n[158] For instance, the Union possesses by the constitution the right of\r\nselling unoccupied lands for its own profit. Supposing that the state of\r\nOhio should claim the same right in behalf of certain territories lying\r\nwithin its boundaries, upon the plea that the constitution refers\r\nto those lands alone which do not belong to the jurisdiction of any\r\nparticular state, and consequently should choose to dispose of them\r\nitself, the litigation would be carried on in the name of the purchasers\r\nfrom the state of Ohio, and the purchasers from the Union, and not in\r\nthe names of Ohio and the Union. But what would become of this legal\r\nfiction if the federal purchaser was confirmed in his right by the\r\ncourts of the Union, while the other competitor was ordered to retain\r\npossession by the tribunals of the state of Ohio?\r\n\r\n[The difficulty supposed by the author in this note is imaginary. The\r\nquestion of title to the lands in the case put, must depend upon the\r\nconstitution, treaties, and laws of the United States; and a decision in\r\nthe state court adverse to the claim or title set up under those laws,\r\nmust, by the very words of the constitution and of the judiciary act,\r\nbe subject to review by the supreme court of the United States, whose\r\ndecision is final.\r\n\r\nThe remarks in the text of this page upon the relative weakness of\r\nthe government of the Union, are equally applicable to any form of\r\nrepublican or democratic government, and are not peculiar to a federal\r\nsystem. Under the circumstances supposed by the author, of all the\r\ncitizens of a state, or a large majority of them, aggrieved at the\r\nsame time and in the same manner, by the operation of any law, the same\r\ndifficulty would arise in executing the laws of the state as those of\r\nthe Union. Indeed, such instances of the total inefficacy of state\r\nlaws are not wanting. The fact is, that all republics depend on the\r\nwillingness of the people to execute the laws. If they will not enforce\r\nthem, there is, so far, an end to the government, for it possesses no\r\npower adequate to the control of the physical power of the people.\r\n\r\nNot only in theory, but in fact, a republican government must be\r\nadministered by the people themselves. They, and they alone, must\r\nexecute the laws. And hence, the first principles in such governments,\r\nthat on which all others depend, and without which no other can exist,\r\nis and must be, obedience to the existing laws at all times and under\r\nall circumstances. It is the vital condition of the social compact.\r\nHe who claims a dispensing power for himself, by which he suspends the\r\noperation of the law in his own case, is worse than a usurper, for\r\nhe not only tramples under foot the constitution of his country,\r\nbut violates the reciprocal pledge which he has given to his\r\nfellow-citizens, and has received from them, that he will abide by the\r\nlaws constitutionally enacted; upon the strength of which pledge, his\r\nown personal rights and acquisitions are protected by the rest of the\r\ncommunity.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\n[159] Kent's Commentaries, vol. i., p. 244. I have selected an example\r\nwhich relates to a time posterior to the promulgation of the present\r\nconstitution. If I had gone back to the days of the confederation, I\r\nmight have given still more striking instances. The whole nation was\r\nat that time in a state of enthusiastic excitement; the revolution was\r\nrepresented by a man who was the idol of the people; but at that very\r\nperiod congress had, to say the truth, no resources at all at its\r\ndisposal. Troops and supplies were perpetually wanting. The best devised\r\nprojects failed in the execution, and the Union, which was constantly on\r\nthe verge of destruction, was saved by the weakness of its enemies far\r\nmore than by its own strength.\r\n\r\n[160] Appendix O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWHY THE PEOPLE MAY STRICTLY BE SAID TO GOVERN IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto examined the institutions of the United States; I have\r\npassed their legislation in review, and I have depicted the present\r\ncharacteristics of political society in that country. But a sovereign\r\npower exists above these institutions and beyond these characteristic\r\nfeatures, which may destroy or modify them at its pleasure; I mean that\r\nof the people. It remains to be shown in what manner this power, which\r\nregulates the laws, acts: its propensities and its passions remain to be\r\npointed out, as well as the secret springs which retard, accelerate,\r\nor direct its irresistible course; and the effects of its unbounded\r\nauthority, with the destiny which is probably reserved for it.\r\n\r\nIn America the people appoints the legislative and the executive power,\r\nand furnishes the jurors who punish all offences against the laws. The\r\nAmerican institutions are democratic, not only in their principle but\r\nin all their consequences; and the people elects its representatives\r\n_directly_, and for the most part _annually_, in order to ensure their\r\ndependence. The people is therefore the real directing power; and\r\nalthough the form of government is representative, it is evident that\r\nthe opinions, the prejudices, the interests, and even the passions of\r\nthe community are hindered by no durable obstacles from exercising\r\na perpetual influence on society. In the United States the majority\r\ngoverns in the name of the people, as is the case in all the countries\r\nin which the people is supreme. This majority is principally composed\r\nof peaceable citizens, who, either by inclination or by interest,\r\nare sincerely desirous of the welfare of their country. But they are\r\nsurrounded by the incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain\r\ntheir co-operation and to avail themselves of their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Division to be made between Parties.--Parties which are to each\r\nother as rival Nations.--Parties properly so called.--Difference\r\nbetween great and small Parties.--Epochs which produce them.--Their\r\nCharacteristics.--America has had great Parties.--They\r\nare extinct.--Federalists.--Republicans.--Defeat of the\r\nFederalists.--Difficulty of creating Parties in the United States.--What\r\nis done with this Intention.--Aristocratic and democratic Character to\r\nbe met with in all Parties.--Struggle of General Jackson against the\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nA great division must be made between parties. Some countries are\r\nso large that the different populations which inhabit them have\r\ncontradictory interests, although they are the subjects of the same\r\ngovernment; and they may thence be in a perpetual state of opposition.\r\nIn this case the different fractions of the people may more properly be\r\nconsidered as distinct nations than as mere parties; and if a civil war\r\nbreaks out, the struggle is carried off by rival peoples rather than by\r\nfactions in the state.\r\n\r\nBut when the citizens entertain different opinions upon subjects which\r\naffect the whole country alike, such, for instance, as the principles\r\nupon which the government is to be conducted, then distinctions arise\r\nwhich may correctly be styled parties. Parties are a necessary evil in\r\nfree governments; but they have not at all times the same character and\r\nthe same propensities.\r\n\r\nAt certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such insupportable evils\r\nas to conceive the design of effecting a total change in its political\r\nconstitution; at other times the mischief lies still deeper, and the\r\nexistence of society itself is endangered. Such are the times of great\r\nrevolutions and of great parties. But between these epochs of misery and\r\nof confusion there are periods during which human society seems to rest,\r\nand mankind to make a pause. This pause is, indeed, only apparent; for\r\ntime does not stop its course for nations any more than for men; they\r\nare all advancing toward a goal with which they are unacquainted; and\r\nwe only imagine them to be stationary when their progress escapes our\r\nobservation; as men who are going at a foot pace seem to be standing\r\nstill to those who run.\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, there are certain epochs at which the changes\r\nthat take place in the social and political constitution of nations are\r\nso slow and so insensible, that men imagine their present condition\r\nto be a final state; and the human mind, believing itself to be firmly\r\nbased upon certain foundations, does not extend its researches beyond\r\nthe horizon which it descries. These are the times of small parties and\r\nof intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe political parties which I style great are those which cling to\r\nprinciples more than to consequences; to general, and not to especial\r\ncases; to ideas, and not to men. These parties are usually distinguished\r\nby a nobler character, by more generous passions, more genuine\r\nconvictions, and a more bold and open conduct than the others. In\r\nthem, private interest, which always plays the chief part in political\r\npassions, is more studiously veiled under the pretext of the public\r\ngood; and it may even be sometimes concealed from the eyes of the very\r\nperson whom it excites and impels.\r\n\r\nMinor parties are, on the other hand, generally deficient in political\r\nfaith. As they are not sustained or dignified by a lofty purpose, they\r\nostensibly display the egotism of their character in their actions.\r\nThey glow with a factitious zeal; their language is vehement, but their\r\nconduct is timid and irresolute. The means they employ are as wretched\r\nas the end at which they aim. Hence it arises that when a calm state\r\nof things succeeds a violent revolution, the leaders of society\r\nseem suddenly to disappear, and the powers of the human mind to lie\r\nconcealed. Society is convulsed by great parties, by minor ones it is\r\nagitated; it is torn by the former, by the latter it is degraded; and\r\nif these sometimes save it by a salutary perturbation, those invariably\r\ndisturb it to no good end.\r\n\r\nAmerica has already lost the great parties which once divided the\r\nnation; and if her happiness is considerably increased, her morality\r\nhas suffered by their extinction. When the war of independence was\r\nterminated, and the foundations of the new government were to be laid\r\ndown, the nation was divided between two opinions--two opinions which\r\nare as old as the world, and which are perpetually to be met with\r\nunder all the forms and all the names which have ever obtained in free\r\ncommunities--the one tending to limit, the other to extend indefinitely,\r\nthe power of the people. The conflict of these two opinions never\r\nassumed that degree of violence in America which it has frequently\r\ndisplayed elsewhere. Both parties of the Americans were in fact agreed\r\nupon the most essential points; and neither of them had to destroy a\r\ntraditionary constitution, or to overthrow the structure of society, in\r\norder to insure its own triumph. In neither of them, consequently, were\r\na great number of private interests affected by success or by defeat;\r\nbut moral principles of a high order, such as the love of equality and\r\nof independence, were concerned in the struggle, and they sufficed to\r\nkindle violent passions.\r\n\r\nThe party which desired to limit the power of the people, endeavored to\r\napply its doctrines more especially to the constitution of the Union,\r\nwhence it derived its name of _federal_. The other party, which affected\r\nto be more exclusively attached to the cause of liberty, took that of\r\n_republican_. America is the land of democracy, and the federalists were\r\nalways in a minority; but they reckoned on their side almost all the\r\ngreat men who had been called forth by the war of independence, and\r\ntheir moral influence was very considerable. Their cause was, moreover,\r\nfavored by circumstances. The ruin of the confederation had impressed\r\nthe people with a dread of anarchy, and the federalists did not fail to\r\nprofit by this transient disposition of the multitude. For ten or twelve\r\nyears they were at the head of affairs, and they were able to apply\r\nsome, though not all, of their principles; for the hostile current was\r\nbecoming from day to day too violent to be checked or stemmed. In 1801\r\nthe republicans got possession of the government: Thomas Jefferson was\r\nnamed president; and he increased the influence of their party by the\r\nweight of his celebrity, the greatness of his talents, and the immense\r\nextent of his popularity.\r\n\r\nThe means by which the federalists had maintained their position were\r\nartificial, and their resources were temporary: it was by the virtues\r\nor the talents of their leaders that they had risen to power. When\r\nthe republicans attained to that lofty station, their opponents were\r\noverwhelmed by utter defeat. An immense majority declared itself against\r\nthe retiring party, and the federalists found themselves in so small a\r\nminority, that they at once despaired of their future success. From that\r\nmoment the republican or democratic party has proceeded from conquest to\r\nconquest, until it has acquired absolute supremacy in the country. The\r\nfederalists, perceiving that they were vanquished without resource, and\r\nisolated in the midst of the nation, fell into two divisions, of which\r\none joined the victorious republicans, and the other abandoned its\r\nrallying point and its name. Many years have already elapsed since they\r\nceased to exist as a party.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the federalists to power was, in my opinion, one of the\r\nmost fortunate incidents which accompanied the formation of the great\r\nAmerican Union: they resisted the inevitable propensities of their age\r\nand of their country. But whether their theories were good or bad, they\r\nhad the defect of being inapplicable, as a system, to the society which\r\nthey professed to govern; and that which occurred under the auspices\r\nof Jefferson must therefore have taken place sooner or later. But their\r\ngovernment gave the new republic time to acquire a certain stability,\r\nand afterward to support the rapid growth of the very doctrines which\r\nthey had combated. A considerable number of their principles were in\r\npoint of fact embodied in the political creed of their opponents;\r\nand the federal constitution, which subsists at the present day, is a\r\nlasting monument of their patriotism and their wisdom.\r\n\r\nGreat political parties are not, then, to be met with in the United\r\nStates at the present time. Parties, indeed, may be found which threaten\r\nthe future tranquillity of the Union; but there are none which seem\r\nto contest the present form of government, or the present course of\r\nsociety. The parties by which the Union is menaced do not rest upon\r\nabstract principles, but upon temporal interests. These interests,\r\ndisseminated in the provinces of so vast an empire, may be said to\r\nconstitute rival nations rather than parties. Thus, upon a recent\r\noccasion, the north contended for the system of commercial prohibition,\r\nand the south took up arms in favor of free trade, simply because the\r\nnorth is a manufacturing, and the south an agricultural district;\r\nand that the restrictive system which was profitable to the one, was\r\nprejudicial to the other.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of great parties, the United States abound with lesser\r\ncontroversies; and public opinion is divided into a thousand minute\r\nshades of difference upon questions of very little moment. The pains\r\nwhich are taken to create parties are inconceivable, and at the present\r\nday it is no easy task. In the United States there is no religious\r\nanimosity, because all religion is respected, and no sect is\r\npredominant; there is no jealousy of rank, because the people is\r\neverything, and none can contest its authority; lastly, there is no\r\npublic misery to serve as a means of agitation, because the physical\r\nposition of the country opens so wide a field to industry, that man is\r\nable to accomplish the most surprising undertakings with his own native\r\nresources. Nevertheless, ambitious men are interested in the creation of\r\nparties, since it is difficult to eject a person from authority upon the\r\nmere ground that his place is coveted by others. The skill of the actors\r\nin the political world lies, therefore, in the art of creating parties.\r\nA political aspirant in the United States begins by discriminating\r\nhis own interest, and by calculating upon those interests which may be\r\ncollected around, and amalgamated with it; he then contrives to discover\r\nsome doctrine or some principle which may suit the purposes of this new\r\nassociation, and which he adopts in order to bring forward his party\r\nand to secure its popularity: just as the _imprimatur_ of a king was\r\nin former days incorporated with the volume which it authorized, but to\r\nwhich it nowise belonged. When these preliminaries are terminated, the\r\nnew party is ushered into the political world.\r\n\r\nAll the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a\r\nstranger to be so incomprehensible and so puerile, that he is at a\r\nloss whether to pity a people which takes such arrant trifles in good\r\nearnest, or to envy that happiness which enables it to discuss them. But\r\nwhen he comes to study the secret propensities which govern the factions\r\nof America, he easily perceives that the greater part of them are more\r\nor less connected with one or the other of these two divisions which\r\nhave always existed in free communities. The deeper we penetrate into\r\nthe workings of these parties, the more do we perceive that the object\r\nof the one is to limit, and that of the other to extend, the popular\r\nauthority. I do not assert that the ostensible end, or even that the\r\nsecret aim, of American parties is to promote the rule of aristocracy or\r\ndemocracy in the country, but I affirm that aristocratic or democratic\r\npassions may easily be detected at the bottom of all parties, and that,\r\nalthough they escape a superficial observation, they are the main point\r\nand the very soul of every faction in the United States.\r\n\r\nTo quote a recent example: when the president attacked the bank, the\r\ncountry was excited and parties were formed; the well-informed classes\r\nrallied round the bank, the common people round the president. But it\r\nmust not be imagined that the people had formed a rational opinion upon\r\na question which offers so many difficulties to the most experienced\r\nstatesmen. The bank is a great establishment which enjoys an independent\r\nexistence, and the people, accustomed to make and unmake whatsoever it\r\npleases, is startled to meet with this obstacle to its authority. In\r\nthe midst of the perpetual fluctuation of society, the community is\r\nirritated by so permanent an institution, and is led to attack it, in\r\norder to see whether it can be shaken and controlled, like all the other\r\ninstitutions of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMAINS OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSecret Opposition of wealthy Individuals to Democracy.--Their\r\nretirement.--Their tastes for exclusive Pleasures and for Luxury at\r\nHome.--Their Simplicity Abroad.--Their affected Condescension toward the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens in a people among which various opinions prevail,\r\nthat the balance of the several parties is lost, and one of them obtains\r\nan irresistible preponderance, overpowers all obstacles, harasses its\r\nopponents, and appropriates all the resources of society to its own\r\npurposes. The vanquished citizens despair of success, and they conceal\r\ntheir dissatisfaction in silence and in a general apathy. The nation\r\nseems to be governed by a single principle, and the prevailing party\r\nassumes the credit of having restored peace and unanimity to the\r\ncountry. But this apparent unanimity is merely a cloak to alarming\r\ndissensions and perpetual opposition.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what occurred in America; when the democratic party\r\ngot the upper hand, it took exclusive possession of the conduct of\r\naffairs, and from that time the laws and customs of society have been\r\nadapted to its caprices. At the present day the more affluent classes of\r\nsociety are so entirely removed from the direction of political affairs\r\nin the United States, that wealth, far from conferring a right to the\r\nexercise of power, is rather an obstacle than a means of attaining to\r\nit. The wealthy members of the community abandon the lists, through\r\nunwillingness to contend, and frequently to contend in vain, against\r\nthe poorest classes of their fellow-citizens. They concentrate all their\r\nenjoyments in the privacy of their homes, where they occupy a rank which\r\ncannot be assumed in public; and they constitute a private society in\r\nthe state, which has its own tastes and its own pleasures. They submit\r\nto this state of things as an irremediable evil, but they are careful\r\nnot to show that they are galled by its continuance; it is even not\r\nuncommon to hear them laud the delights of a republican government, and\r\nthe advantages of democratic institutions when they are in public. Next\r\nto hating their enemies, men are most inclined to flatter them.\r\n\r\nMark, for instance, that opulent citizen, who is as anxious as a Jew of\r\nthe middle ages to conceal his wealth. His dress is plain, his demeanor\r\nunassuming; but the interior of his dwelling glitters with luxury, and\r\nnone but a few chosen guests whom he haughtily styles his equals, are\r\nallowed to penetrate into this sanctuary. No European noble is more\r\nexclusive in his pleasures, or more jealous of the smallest advantages\r\nwhich his privileged station confers upon him. But the very same\r\nindividual crosses the city to reach a dark counting-house in the centre\r\nof traffic, where every one may accost him who pleases. If he meets his\r\ncobbler upon the way, they stop and converse; the two citizens discuss\r\nthe affairs of the state in which they have an equal interest, and they\r\nshake hands before they part.\r\n\r\nBut beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequious attentions\r\nto the preponderating power, it is easy to perceive that the wealthy\r\nmembers of the community entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic\r\ninstitutions of their country. The populace is at once the object\r\nof their scorn and of their fears. If the mal-administration of the\r\ndemocracy ever brings about a revolutionary crisis, and if monarchical\r\ninstitutions ever become practicable in the United States, the truth of\r\nwhat I advance will become obvious.\r\n\r\nThe two chief weapons which parties use in order to ensure success, are\r\nthe _public press_, and the formation of _associations_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLIBERTY OF THE PRESS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulty of restraining the Liberty of the Press.--Particular reasons\r\nwhich some Nations have to cherish this Liberty.--The Liberty of the\r\nPress a necessary Consequence of the Sovereignty of the people as it is\r\nunderstood in America.--Violent Language of the periodical Press in the\r\nUnited States.--Propensities of the periodical Press.--Illustrated by\r\nthe United States.--Opinion of the Americans upon the Repression of the\r\nAbuse of the Liberty of the Press by judicial Prosecutions.--Reasons for\r\nwhich the Press is less powerful in America than in France.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the liberty of the press does not affect political\r\nopinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men, and it\r\nmodifies customs as well as laws. In another part of this work I shall\r\nattempt to determine the degree of influence which the liberty of the\r\npress has exercised upon civil society in the United States, and to\r\npoint out the direction which it has given to the ideas, as well as\r\nthe tone which it has imparted to the character and the feelings of the\r\nAnglo-Americans, but at present I purpose simply to examine the effects\r\nproduced by the liberty of the press in the political world.\r\n\r\nI confess that I do not entertain that firm and complete attachment to\r\nthe liberty of the press, which things that are supremely good in their\r\nvery nature are wont to excite in the mind; and I approve of it more\r\nfrom a recollection of the evils it prevents, than from a consideration\r\nof the advantages it ensures.\r\n\r\nIf any one can point out an intermediate, and yet a tenable position,\r\nbetween the complete independence and the entire subjection of the\r\npublic expression of opinion, I should perhaps be inclined to adopt it;\r\nbut the difficulty is to discover this position. If it is your intention\r\nto correct the abuses of unlicensed printing, and to restore the use of\r\norderly language, you may in the first instance try the offender by\r\na jury; but if the jury acquits him, the opinion which was that of a\r\nsingle individual becomes the opinion of the country at large. Too much\r\nand too little has therefore hitherto been done; if you proceed, you\r\nmust bring the delinquent before permanent magistrates; but even\r\nhere the cause must be heard before it can be decided; and the very\r\nprinciples which no book would have ventured to avow are blazoned\r\nforth in the pleadings, and what was obscurely hinted at in a single\r\ncomposition is then repeated in a multitude of other publications.\r\nThe language in which a thought is embodied is the mere carcase of the\r\nthought, and not the idea itself; tribunals may condemn the form, but\r\nthe sense and spirit of the work is too subtle for their authority: too\r\nmuch has still been done to recede, too little to attain your end: you\r\nmust therefore proceed. If you establish a censorship of the press, the\r\ntongue of the public speaker will still make itself heard, and you have\r\nonly increased the mischief. The powers of thought do not rely, like the\r\npowers of physical strength, upon the number of their mechanical agents,\r\nnor can a host of authors be reckoned like the troops which compose an\r\narmy; on the contrary, the authority of a principle is often increased\r\nby the smallness of the number of men by whom it is expressed. The words\r\nof a strong-minded man, which penetrate amid the passions of a listening\r\nassembly, have more weight than the vociferations of a thousand\r\norators; and if it be allowed to speak freely in any public place,\r\nthe consequence is the same as if free speaking was allowed in every\r\nvillage. The liberty of discourse must therefore be destroyed as well\r\nas the liberty of the press; this is the necessary term of your efforts;\r\nbut if your object was to repress the abuses of liberty, they have\r\nbrought you to the feet of a despot. You have been led from the extreme\r\nof independence to the extreme of subjection, without meeting with a\r\nsingle tenable position for shelter or repose.\r\n\r\nThere are certain nations which have peculiar reasons for cherishing the\r\npress, independently of the general motives which I have just pointed\r\nout. For in certain countries which profess to enjoy the privileges of\r\nfreedom, every individual agent of the government may violate the laws\r\nwith impunity, since those whom he oppresses cannot prosecute him before\r\nthe courts of justice. In this case the liberty of the press is not\r\nmerely a guarantee, but it is the only guarantee of their liberty\r\nand their security which the citizens possess. If the rulers of these\r\nnations proposed to abolish the independence of the press, the people\r\nwould be justified in saying: \"Give us the right of prosecuting your\r\noffences before the ordinary tribunals, and perhaps we may then waive\r\nour right of appeal to the tribunal of public opinion.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the countries in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople ostensibly prevails, the censorship of the press is not only\r\ndangerous, but it is absurd. When the right of every citizen to\r\nco-operate in the government of society is acknowledged, every citizen\r\nmust be presumed to possess the power of discriminating between the\r\ndifferent opinions of his contemporaries, and of appreciating the\r\ndifferent facts from which inferences may be drawn. The sovereignty of\r\nthe people and the liberty of the press may therefore be looked upon\r\nas correlative institutions; just as the censorship of the press and\r\nuniversal suffrage are two things which are irreconcileably opposed, and\r\nwhich cannot long be retained among the institutions of the same people.\r\nNot a single individual of the twelve millions who inhabit the territory\r\nof the United States has as yet dared to propose any restrictions to\r\nthe liberty of the press. The first newspaper over which I cast my eyes,\r\nafter my arrival in America, contained the following article:\r\n\r\n\"In all this affair, the language of Jackson has been that of a\r\nheartless despot, solely occupied with the preservation of his own\r\nauthority. Ambition is his crime, and it will be his punishment too:\r\nintrigue is his native element, and intrigue will confound his tricks,\r\nand will deprive him of his power; he governs by means of corruption,\r\nand his immoral practices will redound to his shame and confusion. His\r\nconduct in the political arena has been that of a shameless and\r\nlawless gamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of retribution\r\napproaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to throw\r\naside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement where he\r\nmay curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a virtue with\r\nwhich his heart is likely to remain for ever unacquainted.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommonly imagined in France, that the virulence of the\r\npress originates in the uncertain social condition, in the political\r\nexcitement, and the general sense of consequent evil which prevail in\r\nthat country; and it is therefore supposed that as soon as society\r\nhas resumed a certain degree of composure, the press will abandon its\r\npresent vehemence. I am inclined to think that the above causes explain\r\nthe reason of the extraordinary ascendency it has acquired over the\r\nnation, but that they do not exercise much influence upon the tone\r\nof its language. The periodical press appears to me to be actuated by\r\npassions and propensities independent of the circumstances in which\r\nit is placed; and the present position of America corroborates this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nAmerica is, perhaps, at this moment, the country of the whole world\r\nwhich contains the fewest germs of revolution; but the press is not less\r\ndestructive in its principles than in France, and it displays the same\r\nviolence without the same reasons for indignation. In America, as\r\nin France, it constitutes a singular power, so strangely composed of\r\nmingled good and evil, that it is at the same time indispensable to the\r\nexistence of freedom, and nearly incompatible with the maintenance of\r\npublic order. Its power is certainly much greater in France than in the\r\nUnited States; though nothing is more rare in the latter country than to\r\nhear of a prosecution having been instituted against it. The reason\r\nof this is perfectly simple; the Americans having once admitted\r\nthe doctrine of sovereignty of the people, apply it with perfect\r\nconsistency. It was never their intention to found a permanent state\r\nof things with elements which undergo daily modifications; and there\r\nis consequently nothing criminal in an attack upon the existing laws,\r\nprovided it be not attended with a violent infraction of them. They\r\nare moreover of opinion that courts of justice are unable to check\r\nthe abuses of the press; and that as the subtlety of human language\r\nperpetually eludes the severity of judicial analysis, offences of this\r\nnature are apt to escape the hand which attempts to apprehend them. They\r\nhold that to act with efficacy upon the press, it would be necessary to\r\nfind a tribunal, not only devoted to the existing order of things, but\r\ncapable of surmounting the influence of public opinion; a tribunal which\r\nshould conduct its proceedings without publicity, which should pronounce\r\nits decrees without assigning its motives, and punish the intentions\r\neven more than the language of an author. Whosoever should have the\r\npower of creating and maintaining a tribunal of this kind, would waste\r\nhis time in prosecuting the liberty of the press; for he would be the\r\nsupreme master of the whole community, and he would be as free to\r\nrid himself of the authors as of their writings. In this question,\r\ntherefore, there is no medium between servitude and extreme license; in\r\norder to enjoy the inestimable benefits which the liberty of the press\r\nensures, it is necessary to submit to the inevitable evils which it\r\nengenders. To expect to acquire the former, and to escape the latter,\r\nis to cherish one of those illusions which commonly mislead nations\r\nin their times of sickness, when, tired with faction and exhausted by\r\neffort, they attempt to combine hostile opinions and contrary principles\r\nupon the same soil.\r\n\r\nThe small influence of the American journals is attributable to several\r\nreasons, among which are the following:--\r\n\r\nThe liberty of writing, like all other liberty, is most formidable\r\nwhen it is a novelty; for a people which has never been accustomed to\r\nco-operate in the conduct of state affairs, places implicit confidence\r\nin the first tribune who arouses its attention. The Anglo-Americans\r\nhave enjoyed this liberty ever since the foundation of the settlements;\r\nmoreover, the press cannot create human passions by its own power,\r\nhowever skilfully it may kindle them where they exist. In America\r\npolitics are discussed with animation and a varied activity, but they\r\nrarely touch those deep passions which are excited whenever the positive\r\ninterest of a part of the community is impaired: but in the United\r\nStates the interests of the community are in a most prosperous\r\ncondition. A single glance upon a French and an American newspaper is\r\nsufficient to show the difference which exists between the two nations\r\non this head. In France the space allotted to commercial advertisements\r\nis very limited, and the intelligence is not considerable, but the most\r\nessential part of the journal is that which contains the discussion of\r\nthe politics of the day. In America three quarters of the enormous sheet\r\nwhich is set before the reader are filled with advertisements, and the\r\nremainder is frequently occupied by political intelligence or trivial\r\nanecdotes: it is only from time to time that one finds a corner devoted\r\nto passionate discussions like those with which the journalists of\r\nFrance are wont to indulge their readers.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated by observation, and discovered by the innate\r\nsagacity of the pettiest as well as the greatest of despots, that the\r\ninfluence of a power is increased in proportion as its direction\r\nis rendered more central. In France the press combines a twofold\r\ncentralisation: almost all its power is centred in the same spot, and\r\nvested in the same hands, for its organs are far from numerous. The\r\ninfluence of a public press thus constituted, upon a sceptical nation,\r\nmust be unbounded. It is an enemy with which a government may sign an\r\noccasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNeither of these kinds of centralisation exists in America. The United\r\nStates have no metropolis; the intelligence as well as the power of the\r\ncountry is dispersed abroad, and instead of radiating from a point, they\r\ncross each other in every direction; the Americans have established no\r\ncentral control over the expression of opinion, any more than over the\r\nconduct of business. These are circumstances which do not depend on\r\nhuman foresight; but it is owing to the laws of the Union that there are\r\nno licenses to be granted to the printers, no securities demanded from\r\neditors, as in France, and no stamp duty as in France and England.\r\nThe consequence of this is that nothing is easier than to set up a\r\nnewspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to defray the expenses\r\nof the editor.\r\n\r\nThe number of periodical and occasional publications which appear in the\r\nUnited States actually surpasses belief. The most enlightened Americans\r\nattribute the subordinate influence of the press to this excessive\r\ndissemination; and it is adopted as an axiom of political science in\r\nthat country, that the only way to neutralise the effect of public\r\njournals is to multiply them indefinitely. I cannot conceive why a truth\r\nwhich is so self-evident has not already been more generally admitted\r\nin Europe; it is comprehensible that the persons who hope to bring about\r\nrevolutions, by means of the press, should be desirous of confining its\r\naction to a few powerful organs; but it is perfectly incredible that the\r\npartisans of the existing state of things, and the natural supporters\r\nof the laws, should attempt to diminish the influence of the press by\r\nconcentrating its authority. The governments of Europe seem to treat\r\nthe press with the courtesy of the knights of old; they are anxious to\r\nfurnish it with the same central power which they have found to be so\r\ntrusty a weapon, in order to enhance the glory of their resistance to\r\nits attacks.\r\n\r\nIn America there is scarcely a hamlet which has not its own newspaper.\r\nIt may readily be imagined that neither discipline nor unity of\r\ndesign can be communicated to so multifarious a host, and each one\r\nis constantly led to fight under his own standard. All the political\r\njournals of the United States are indeed arrayed on the side of the\r\nadministration or against it; but they attack and defend it in a\r\nthousand different ways. They cannot succeed in forming those great\r\ncurrents of opinion which overwhelm the most solid obstacles. This\r\ndivision of the influence of the press produces a variety of other\r\nconsequences which are scarcely less remarkable. The facility with which\r\njournals can be established induces a multitude of individuals to take a\r\npart in them; but as the extent of competition precludes the possibility\r\nof considerable profit, the most distinguished classes of society are\r\nrarely led to engage in these undertakings. But such is the number of\r\nthe public prints, that even if they were a source of wealth, writers\r\nof ability could not be found to direct them all. The journalists of\r\nthe United States are usually placed in a very humble position, with a\r\nscanty education, and a vulgar turn of mind. The will of the majority is\r\nthe most general of laws, and it establishes certain habits which form\r\nthe characteristics of each peculiar class of society; thus it dictates\r\nthe etiquette practised at courts and the etiquette of the bar. The\r\ncharacteristics of the French journalist consist in a violent, but\r\nfrequently an eloquent and lofty manner of discussing the politics\r\nof the day; and the exceptions to this habitual practice are only\r\noccasional. The characteristics of the American journalist consist in\r\nan open and coarse appeal to the passions of the populace; and he\r\nhabitually abandons the principles of political science to assail the\r\ncharacters of individuals, to track them into private life, and disclose\r\nall their weaknesses and errors.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more deplorable than this abuse of the powers of thought;\r\nI shall have occasion to point out hereafter the influence of the\r\nnewspapers upon the taste and the morality of the American people, but\r\nmy present subject exclusively concerns the political world. It cannot\r\nbe denied that the effects of this extreme license of the press tend\r\nindirectly to the maintenance of public order. The individuals who are\r\nalready in possession of a high station in the esteem of their fellow\r\ncitizens, are afraid to write in the newspapers, and they are thus\r\ndeprived of the most powerful instrument which they can use to excite\r\nthe passions of the multitude to their own advantage.[161]\r\n\r\nThe personal opinions of the editors have no kind of weight in the\r\neyes of the public: the only use of a journal is, that it imparts the\r\nknowledge of certain facts, and it is only by altering or distorting\r\nthose facts, that a journalist can contribute to the support of his own\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nBut although the press is limited to these resources, its influence\r\nin America is immense. It is the power which impels the circulation of\r\npolitical life through all the districts of that vast territory. Its eye\r\nis constantly open to detect the secret springs of political designs,\r\nand to summon the leaders of all parties to the bar of public opinion.\r\nIt rallies the interests of the community round certain principles, and\r\nit draws up the creed which factions adopt; for it affords a means of\r\nintercourse between parties which hear, and which address each other,\r\nwithout ever having been in immediate contact. When a great number of\r\nthe organs of the press adopt the same line of conduct, their influence\r\nbecomes irresistible; and public opinion, when it is perpetually\r\nassailed from the same side, eventually yields to the attack. In the\r\nUnited States each separate journal exercises but little authority:\r\nbut the power of the periodical press is only second to that of the\r\npeople.[162]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the democracy perpetually raises fresh individuals\r\nto the conduct of public affairs; and the measures of the administration\r\nare consequently seldom regulated by the strict rules of consistency or\r\nof order. But the general principles of the government are more stable,\r\nand the opinions most prevalent in society are generally more durable\r\nthan in many other countries. When once the Americans have taken up an\r\nidea, whether it be well or ill-founded, nothing is more difficult than\r\nto eradicate it from their minds. The same tenacity of opinion has been\r\nobserved in England, where, for the last century, greater freedom of\r\nconscience, and more invincible prejudices have existed, than in all the\r\nother countries of Europe. I attribute this consequence to a cause which\r\nmay at first sight appear to have a very opposite tendency, namely, to\r\nthe liberty of the press. The nations among which this liberty exists\r\nare as apt to cling to their opinions from pride as from conviction.\r\nThey cherish them because they hold them to be just, and because they\r\nexercised their own free will in choosing them; and they maintain them,\r\nnot only because they are true, but because they are their own. Several\r\nother reasons conduce to the same end.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by a man of genius, that \"ignorance lies at the two\r\nends of knowledge.\" Perhaps it would have been more correct to say that\r\nabsolute convictions are to be met with at the two extremities, and that\r\ndoubt lies in the middle; for the human intellect may be considered in\r\nthree distinct states, which frequently succeed one another.\r\n\r\nA man believes implicitly, because he adopts a proposition without\r\ninquiry. He doubts as soon as he is assailed by the objections which\r\nhis inquiries may have aroused. But he frequently succeeds in satisfying\r\nthese doubts, and then he begins to believe afresh: he no longer lays\r\nhold on a truth in its most shadowy and uncertain form, but he sees\r\nit clearly before him, and he advances onward by the light it gives\r\nhim.[163]\r\n\r\nWhen the liberty of the press acts upon men who are in the first of\r\nthese three states, it does not immediately disturb their habit of\r\nbelieving implicitly without investigation, but it constantly modifies\r\nthe objects of their intuitive convictions. The human mind continues\r\nto discern but one point upon the whole intellectual horizon, and\r\nthat point is in continual motion. Such are the symptoms of sudden\r\nrevolutions, and of the misfortunes that are sure to befall those\r\ngenerations which abruptly adopt the unconditional freedom of the press.\r\n\r\nThe circle of novel ideas is, however, soon terminated; the torch\r\nof experience is upon them, and the doubt and mistrust which their\r\nuncertainty produces, become universal. We may rest assured that the\r\nmajority of mankind will either believe they know not wherefore, or will\r\nnot know what to believe. Few are the beings who can ever hope to attain\r\nthat state of rational and independent conviction which true knowledge\r\ncan beget, in defiance of the attacks of doubt.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that in times of great religious fervor, men\r\nsometimes change their religious opinions; whereas, in times of general\r\nscepticism, every one clings to his own persuasion. The same thing takes\r\nplace in politics under the liberty of the press. In countries where all\r\nthe theories of social science have been contested in their turn, the\r\ncitizens who have adopted one of them, stick to it, not so much because\r\nthey are assured of its excellence, as because they are not convinced of\r\nthe superiority of any other. In the present age men are not very ready\r\nto die in defence of their opinions, but they are rarely inclined to\r\nchange them; and there are fewer martyrs as well as fewer apostates.\r\n\r\nAnother still more valid reason may yet be adduced: when no abstract\r\nopinions are looked upon as certain, men cling to the mere propensities\r\nand external interest of their position, which are naturally more\r\ntangible and more permanent than any opinions in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question of easy solution whether the aristocracy or the\r\ndemocracy is most fit to govern a country. But it is certain that\r\ndemocracy annoys one part of the community, and that aristocracy\r\noppresses another part. When the question is reduced to the simple\r\nexpression of the struggle between poverty and wealth, the tendency\r\nof each side of the dispute becomes perfectly evident without farther\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[161] They only write in the papers when they choose to address the\r\npeople in their own name; as, for instance, when they are called upon to\r\nrepel calumnious imputations, and to correct a mis-statement of facts.\r\n\r\n[162] See Appendix P.\r\n\r\n[163] It may, however, be doubted whether this rational and self-guiding\r\nconviction arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic devotedness in men as\r\ntheir first dogmatical belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily use which the Anglo-Americans make of the Right of\r\nAssociation.--Three kinds of political Association.--In what Manner\r\nthe Americans apply the representative System to Associations.--Dangers\r\nresulting to the State.--Great Convention of 1831 relative to the\r\nTariff. Legislative character of this Convention.--Why the unlimited\r\nExercise of the Right of Association is less dangerous in the United\r\nStates than elsewhere.--Why it may be looked upon as necessary.--Utility\r\nof Associations in a democratic People.\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world has the principle of association been\r\nmore successfully used, or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of\r\ndifferent objects, than in America. Beside the permanent associations\r\nwhich are established by law under the names of townships, cities,\r\nand counties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the\r\nagency of private individuals.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of the United States is taught from his earliest infancy\r\nto rely upon his own exertions, in order to resist the evils and the\r\ndifficulties of life; he looks upon the social authority with an eye of\r\nmistrust and anxiety, and he only claims its assistance when he is quite\r\nunable to shift without it. This habit may even be traced in the schools\r\nof the rising generation, where the children in their games are wont to\r\nsubmit to rules which they have themselves established, and to punish\r\nmisdemeanors which they have themselves defined. The same spirit\r\npervades every act of social life. If a stoppage occurs in a\r\nthoroughfare, and the circulation of the public is hindered, the\r\nneighbors immediately constitute a deliberative body; and this\r\nextemporaneous assembly gives rise to an executive power, which remedies\r\nthe inconvenience, before anybody has thought of recurring to an\r\nauthority superior to that of the persons immediately concerned. If the\r\npublic pleasures are concerned, an association is formed to provide\r\nfor the splendor and the regularity of the entertainment. Societies are\r\nformed to resist enemies which are exclusively of a moral nature, and to\r\ndiminish the vice of intemperance: in the United States associations are\r\nestablished to promote public order, commerce, industry, morality, and\r\nreligion; for there is no end which the human will, seconded by the\r\ncollective exertions of individuals, despairs of attaining.\r\n\r\nI shall hereafter have occasion to show the effects of association upon\r\nthe course of society, and I must confine myself for the present to the\r\npolitical world. When once the right of association is recognized, the\r\ncitizens may employ it in several different ways.\r\n\r\nAn association consists simply in the public assent which a number of\r\nindividuals give to certain doctrines; and in the engagement which they\r\ncontract to promote the spread of those doctrines by their exertions.\r\nThe right of associating with these views is very analogous to the\r\nliberty of unlicensed writing; but societies thus formed possess more\r\nauthority than the press. When an opinion is represented by a society,\r\nit necessarily assumes a more exact and explicit form. It numbers its\r\npartisans, and compromises their welfare in its cause; they, on the\r\nother hand, become acquainted with each other, and their zeal is\r\nincreased by their number. An association unites the efforts of minds\r\nwhich have a tendency to diverge, in one single channel, and urges them\r\nvigorously toward one single end which it points out.\r\n\r\nThe second degree in the right of association is the power of meeting.\r\nWhen an association is allowed to establish centres of action at certain\r\nimportant points in the country, its activity is increased, and its\r\ninfluence extended. Men have the opportunity of seeing each other; means\r\nof execution are more readily combined; and opinions are maintained with\r\na degree of warmth and energy which written language cannot approach.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the exercise of the right of political association, there\r\nis a third degree: the partisans of an opinion may unite in electoral\r\nbodies, and choose delegates to represent them in a central assembly.\r\nThis is, properly speaking, the application of the representative system\r\nto a party.\r\n\r\nThus, in the first instance, a society is formed between individuals\r\nprofessing the same opinion, and the tie which keeps it together is of\r\na purely intellectual nature: in the second case, small assemblies are\r\nformed which only represent a fraction of the party. Lastly, in the\r\nthird case, they constitute a separate nation in the midst of the\r\nnation, a government within the government. Their delegates, like the\r\nreal delegates of the majority, represent the entire collective force\r\nof their party; and they enjoy a certain degree of that national dignity\r\nand great influence which belong to the chosen representatives of the\r\npeople. It is true that they have not the right of making the laws;\r\nbut they have the power of attacking those which are in being, and\r\nof drawing up beforehand those which they may afterward cause to be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIf, in a people which is imperfectly accustomed to the exercise\r\nof freedom, or which is exposed to violent political passions, a\r\ndeliberating minority, which confines itself to the contemplation of\r\nfuture laws, be placed in juxtaposition to the legislative majority, I\r\ncannot but believe that public tranquillity incurs very great risks in\r\nthat nation. There is doubtless a very wide difference between proving\r\nthat one law is in itself better than another, and proving that the\r\nformer ought to be substituted for the latter. But the imagination\r\nof the populace is very apt to overlook this difference, which is so\r\napparent in the minds of thinking men. It sometimes happens that a\r\nnation is divided into two nearly equal parties, each of which affects\r\nto represent the majority. If, in immediate contiguity to the directing\r\npower, another power be established, which exercises almost as much\r\nmoral authority as the former, it is not to be believed that it will\r\nlong be content to speak without acting; or that it will always be\r\nrestrained by the abstract consideration of the nature of associations,\r\nwhich are meant to direct, but not to enforce opinions, to suggest but\r\nnot to make the laws.\r\n\r\nThe more we consider the independence of the press in its principal\r\nconsequences, the more are we convinced that it is the chief, and, so to\r\nspeak, the constitutive element of freedom in the modern world. A nation\r\nwhich is determined to remain free, is therefore right in demanding\r\nthe unrestrained exercise of this independence. But the _unrestrained_\r\nliberty of political association cannot be entirely assimilated to the\r\nliberty of the press. The one is at the same time less necessary and\r\nmore dangerous than the other. A nation may confine it within certain\r\nlimits without forfeiting any part of its self-control; and it may\r\nsometimes be obliged to do so in order to maintain its own authority.\r\n\r\nIn America the liberty of association for political purposes is\r\nunbounded. An example will show in the clearest light to what an extent\r\nthis privilege is tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Tariff, or of free trade, produced a great\r\nmanifestation of party feeling in America; the tariff was not only a\r\nsubject of debate as a matter of opinion, but it exercised a favorable\r\nor a prejudicial influence upon several very powerful interests of the\r\nstates. The north attributed a great portion of its prosperity, and the\r\nsouth all its sufferings, to this system. Insomuch, that for a long\r\ntime the tariff was the sole source of the political animosities which\r\nagitated the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, when the dispute was raging with the utmost virulence, a\r\nprivate citizen of Massachusetts proposed to all the enemies of the\r\ntariff, by means of the public prints, to send delegates to Philadelphia\r\nin order to consult together upon the means which were most fitted to\r\npromote the freedom of trade. This proposal circulated in a few days\r\nfrom Maine to New Orleans by the power of the printing press: the\r\nopponents of the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm; meetings were\r\nformed on all sides, and delegates were named. The majority of these\r\nindividuals were well known, and some of them had earned a considerable\r\ndegree of celebrity. South Carolina alone, which afterward took up arms\r\nin the same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On the 1st October, 1831,\r\nthis assembly, which, according to the American custom, had taken the\r\nname of a convention, met at Philadelphia; it consisted of more than\r\ntwo hundred members. Its debates were public, and they at once assumed\r\na legislative character; the extent of the powers of congress, the\r\ntheories of free trade, and the different clauses of the tariff, were\r\ndiscussed in turn. At the end of ten days' deliberation, the convention\r\nbroke up, after having published an address to the American people, in\r\nwhich it is declared:\r\n\r\nI. The congress had not the right of making a tariff, and that the\r\nexisting tariff was unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nII. That the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the interests\r\nof all nations, and to that of the American people in particular.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of political\r\nassociation has not hitherto produced, in the United States, those fatal\r\nconsequences which might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere. The\r\nright of association was imported from England, and it has always\r\nexisted in America. So that the exercise of this privilege is now\r\namalgamated with the manners and customs of the people. At the present\r\ntime, the liberty of association is become a necessary guarantee against\r\nthe tyranny of the majority. In the United States, as soon as a party\r\nhas become preponderant, all the public authority passes under its\r\ncontrol; its private supporters occupy all the places, and have all the\r\nforce of the administration at their disposal. As the most distinguished\r\npartisans of the other side of the question are unable to surmount the\r\nobstacles which exclude them from power, they require some means of\r\nestablishing themselves upon their own basis, and of opposing the moral\r\nauthority of the minority to the physical power which domineers over it.\r\nThus, a dangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more formidable\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe omnipotence of the majority appears to me to present such extreme\r\nperils to the American republics, that the dangerous measure which is\r\nused to repress it, seems to be more advantageous than prejudicial. And\r\nhere I am about to advance a proposition which may remind the reader\r\nof what I said before in speaking of municipal freedom. There are\r\nno countries in which associations are more needed, to prevent the\r\ndespotism of faction, or the arbitrary power of a prince, than those\r\nwhich are democratically constituted. In aristocratic nations, the\r\nbody of the nobles and the more opulent part of the community are in\r\nthemselves natural associations, which act as checks upon the abuses of\r\npower. In countries in which those associations do not exist, if\r\nprivate individuals are unable to create an artificial and a temporary\r\nsubstitute for them, I can imagine no permanent protection against the\r\nmost galling tyranny; and a great people may be oppressed by a small\r\nfaction, or by a single individual, with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of a great political convention (for there are conventions\r\nof all kinds), which may frequently become a necessary measure, is\r\nalways a serious occurrence, even in America, and one which is never\r\nlooked forward to by the judicious friends of the country, without\r\nalarm. This was very perceptible in the convention of 1831, at which the\r\nexertions of all the most distinguished members of the assembly tended\r\nto moderate its language, and to restrain the subjects which it treated\r\nwithin certain limits. It is probable, in fact, that the convention of\r\n1831 exercised a very great influence upon the minds of the malcontents,\r\nand prepared them for the open revolt against the commercial laws of the\r\nUnion, which took place in 1832.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association for\r\npolitical purposes, is the privilege which a people is longest in\r\nlearning how to exercise. If it does not throw the nation into anarchy,\r\nit perpetually augments the chances of that calamity. On one point,\r\nhowever, this perilous liberty offers a security against dangers of\r\nanother kind; in countries where associations are free, secret\r\nsocieties are unknown. In America there are numerous factions, but no\r\nconspiracies.\r\n\r\nThe most natural privilege of man, next to the right of acting\r\nfor himself, is that of combining his exertions with those of his\r\nfellow-creatures, and of acting in common with them. I am therefore led\r\nto conclude, that the right of association is almost as inalienable\r\nas the right of personal liberty. No legislator can attack it without\r\nimpairing the very foundations of society. Nevertheless, if the liberty\r\nof association is a fruitful source of advantages and prosperity to some\r\nnations, it may be perverted or carried to excess by others, and\r\nthe element of life may be changed into an element of destruction. A\r\ncomparison of the different methods which associations pursue, in those\r\ncountries in which they are managed with discretion, as well as in those\r\nwhere liberty degenerates into license, may perhaps be thought useful\r\nboth to governments and to parties. The greater part of Europeans look\r\nupon an association as a weapon which is to be hastily fashioned,\r\nand immediately tried in the conflict. A society is to be formed for\r\ndiscussion, but the idea of impending action prevails in the minds of\r\nthose who constitute it: it is, in fact, an army; and the time given to\r\nparley, serves to reckon up the strength and to animate the courage of\r\nthe host, after which they direct the march against the enemy. Resources\r\nwhich lie within the bounds of the law may suggest themselves to the\r\npersons who compose it, as means, but never as the only means, of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, is not the manner in which the right of association is\r\nunderstood in the United States. In America, the citizens who form\r\nthe minority associate, in order, in the first place, to show their\r\nnumerical strength, and so to diminish the moral authority of the\r\nmajority; and, in the second place, to stimulate competition, and to\r\ndiscover those arguments which are most fitted to act upon the majority;\r\nfor they always entertain hopes of drawing over their opponents to their\r\nown side, and of afterward disposing of the supreme power in their name.\r\nPolitical associations in the United States are therefore peaceable in\r\ntheir intentions, and strictly legal in the means which they employ; and\r\nthey assert with perfect truth, that they only aim at success by lawful\r\nexpedients.\r\n\r\nThe difference which exists between the Americans and ourselves depends\r\non several causes. In Europe there are numerous parties so diametrically\r\nopposed to the majority, that they can never hope to acquire its\r\nsupport, and at the same time they think that they are sufficiently\r\nstrong in themselves to struggle and to defend their cause. When a party\r\nof this kind forms an association, its object is, not to conquer, but to\r\nfight. In America, the individuals who hold opinions very much opposed\r\nto those of the majority, are no sort of impediment to its power; and\r\nall other parties hope to win it over to their own principles in the\r\nend. The exercise of the right of association becomes dangerous in\r\nproportion to the impossibility which excludes great parties from\r\nacquiring the majority. In a country like the United States, in which\r\nthe differences of opinion are mere differences of hue, the right of\r\nassociation may remain unrestrained without evil consequences. The\r\ninexperience of many of the European nations in the enjoyment of\r\nliberty, leads them only to look upon the liberty of association as\r\na right of attacking the government. The first notion which presents\r\nitself to a party, as well as to an individual, when it has acquired a\r\nconsciousness of its own strength, is that of violence: the notion\r\nof persuasion arises at a later period, and is only derived from\r\nexperience. The English, who are divided into parties which differ most\r\nessentially from each other, rarely abuse the right of association,\r\nbecause they have long been accustomed to exercise it. In France, the\r\npassion for war is so intense that there is no undertaking so mad, or\r\nso injurious to the welfare of the state, that a man does not consider\r\nhimself honored in defending it, at the risk of his life.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most powerful of the causes which tend to mitigate the\r\nexcesses of political association in the United States is universal\r\nsuffrage. In countries in which universal suffrage exists, the majority\r\nis never doubtful, because neither party can pretend to represent that\r\nportion of the community which has not voted. The associations which\r\nare formed are aware, as well as the nation at large, that they do not\r\nrepresent the majority; this is, indeed, a condition inseparable from\r\ntheir existence; for if they did represent the preponderating power,\r\nthey would change the law instead of soliciting its reform. The\r\nconsequence of this is, that the moral influence of the government which\r\nthey attack is very much increased, and their own power is very much\r\nenfeebled.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there are few associations which do not affect to represent\r\nthe majority, or which do not believe that they represent it. This\r\nconviction or this pretension tends to augment their force amazingly,\r\nand contributes no less to legalize their measures. Violence may seem to\r\nbe excusable in defence of the cause of oppressed right. Thus it is,\r\nin the vast labyrinth of human laws, that extreme liberty sometimes\r\ncorrects abuses of license, and that extreme democracy obviates the\r\ndangers of democratic government. In Europe, associations consider\r\nthemselves, in some degree, as the legislative and executive councils of\r\nthe people, which is unable to speak for itself. In America, where they\r\nonly represent a minority of the nation, they argue and they petition.\r\n\r\nThe means which the associations of Europe employ, are in accordance\r\nwith the end which they propose to obtain. As the principal aim of these\r\nbodies is to act, and not to debate, to fight rather than to persuade,\r\nthey are naturally led to adopt a form of organization which differs\r\nfrom the ordinary customs of civil bodies, and which assumes the habits\r\nand the maxims of military life. They centralize the direction of their\r\nresources as much as possible, and they intrust the power of the whole\r\nparty to a very small number of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe members of these associations reply to a watchword, like soldiers on\r\nduty: they profess the doctrine of passive obedience; say rather,\r\nthat in uniting together they at once abjure the exercise of their\r\nown judgment and free will; and the tyrannical control, which these\r\nsocieties exercise, is often far more insupportable than the authority\r\npossessed over society by the government which they attack. Their moral\r\nforce is much diminished by these excesses, and they lose the powerful\r\ninterest which is always excited by a struggle between oppressors and\r\nthe oppressed. The man who in given cases consents to obey his fellows\r\nwith servility, and who submits his activity, and even his opinions, to\r\ntheir control, can have no claim to rank as a free citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have also established certain forms of government which\r\nare applied to their associations, but these are invariably borrowed\r\nfrom the forms of the civil administration. The independence of each\r\nindividual is formally recognized; the tendency of the members of the\r\nassociation points, as it does in the body of the community, toward\r\nthe same end, but they are not obliged to follow the same track. No\r\none abjures the exercise of his reason and his free will; but every\r\none exerts that reason and that will for the benefit of a common\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of my\r\nsubject, but although every expression which I am about to make use\r\nof may clash, upon some one point, with the feelings of the different\r\nparties which divide my country, I shall speak my opinion with the most\r\nperfect openness.\r\n\r\nIn Europe we are at a loss how to judge the true character and the more\r\npermanent propensities of democracy, because in Europe two conflicting\r\nprinciples exist, and we do not know what to attribute to the principles\r\nthemselves, and what to refer to the passions which they bring into\r\ncollision. Such, however, is not the case in America; there the people\r\nreigns without any obstacle, and it has no perils to dread, and no\r\ninjuries to avenge. In America, democracy is swayed by its own free\r\npropensities; its course is natural, and its activity is unrestrained:\r\nthe United States consequently afford the most favorable opportunity of\r\nstudying its real character. And to no people can this inquiry be more\r\nvitally interesting than to the French nation, which is blindly driven\r\nonward by a daily and irresistible impulse, toward a state of things\r\nwhich may prove either despotic or republican, but which will assuredly\r\nbe democratic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that universal suffrage has been adopted in\r\nall the states of the Union: it consequently occurs among different\r\npopulations which occupy very different positions in the scale of\r\nsociety. I have had opportunities of observing its effects in different\r\nlocalities, and among races of men who are nearly strangers to each\r\nother by their language, their religion, and their manner of life; in\r\nLouisiana as well as in New England, in Georgia and in Canada. I have\r\nremarked that universal suffrage is far from producing in America either\r\nall the good or all the evil consequences which are assigned to it in\r\nEurope, and that its effects differ very widely from those which are\r\nusually attributed to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF THE PEOPLE, AND INSTINCTIVE PREFERENCES OF THE AMERICAN\r\nDEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the most talented Individuals are rarely placed\r\nat the Head of Affairs.--Reasons of this Peculiarity.--The Envy which\r\nprevails in the lower Orders of France against the higher Classes, is\r\nnot a French, but a purely democratic Sentiment.--For what Reason the\r\nmost distinguished Men in America frequently seclude themselves from\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nMany people in Europe are apt to believe without saying it, or to say\r\nwithout believing it, that one of the great advantages of universal\r\nsuffrage is, that it intrusts the direction of public affairs to men\r\nwho are worthy of the public confidence. They admit that the people is\r\nunable to govern for itself, but they aver that it is always sincerely\r\ndisposed to promote the welfare of the state, and that it instinctively\r\ndesignates those persons who are animated by the same good wishes, and\r\nwho are the most fit to wield the supreme authority. I confess that the\r\nobservations I made in America by no means coincide with these opinions.\r\nOn my arrival in the United States I was surprised to find so much\r\ndistinguished talent among the subjects, and so little among the heads\r\nof the government. It is a well-authenticated fact, that at the present\r\nday the most talented men in the United States are very rarely placed at\r\nthe head of affairs; and it must be acknowledged that such has been the\r\nresult, in proportion as democracy has outstepped all its former limits.\r\nThe race of American statesmen has evidently dwindled most remarkably in\r\nthe course of the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes may be assigned to this phenomenon. It is impossible,\r\nnotwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, to raise the intelligence\r\nof the people above a certain level. Whatever may be the facilities of\r\nacquiring information, whatever may be the profusion of easy methods and\r\nof cheap science, the human mind can never be instructed and educated\r\nwithout devoting a considerable space of time to those objects.\r\n\r\nThe greater or the lesser possibility of subsisting without labor is\r\ntherefore the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement. This\r\nboundary is more remote in some countries, and more restricted in\r\nothers; but it must exist somewhere as long as the people is constrained\r\nto work in order to procure the means of physical subsistence, that is\r\nto say, as long as it retains its popular character. It is therefore\r\nquite as difficult to imagine a state in which all the citizens should\r\nbe very well-informed, as a state in which they should all be wealthy;\r\nthese two difficulties may be looked upon as correlative. It may very\r\nreadily be admitted that the mass of the citizens are sincerely disposed\r\nto promote the welfare of their country; nay more, it may even\r\nbe allowed that the lower classes are less apt to be swayed by\r\nconsiderations of personal interest than the higher orders; but it is\r\nalways more or less impossible for them to discern the best means of\r\nattaining the end, which they desire with sincerity. Long and patient\r\nobservation, joined to a multitude of different notions, is required to\r\nform a just estimate of the character of a single individual; and can it\r\nbe supposed that the vulgar have the power of succeeding in an inquiry\r\nwhich misleads the penetration of genius itself? The people has neither\r\nthe time nor the means which are essential to the prosecution of an\r\ninvestigation of this kind; its conclusions are hastily formed from a\r\nsuperficial inspection of the more prominent features of a question.\r\nHence it often assents to the clamor of a mountebank, who knows the\r\nsecret of stimulating its tastes; while its truest friends frequently\r\nfail in their exertions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the democracy is not only deficient in that soundness of\r\njudgment which is necessary to select men really deserving of its\r\nconfidence, but it has neither the desire nor the inclination to find\r\nthem out. It cannot be denied that democratic institutions have a very\r\nstrong tendency to promote the feeling of envy in the human heart; not\r\nso much because they afford to every one the means of rising to the\r\nlevel of any of his fellow-citizens, as because those means perpetually\r\ndisappoint the persons who employ them. Democratic institutions awaken\r\nand foster a passion for equality which they can never entirely satisfy.\r\nThis complete equality eludes the grasp of the people at the very moment\r\nwhen it thinks to hold it fast, and \"flies,\" as Pascal says, \"with\r\neternal flight;\" the people is excited in the pursuit of an advantage,\r\nwhich is the more precious because it is not sufficiently remote to\r\nbe unknown, or sufficiently near to be enjoyed. The lower orders\r\nare agitated by the chance of success, they are irritated by its\r\nuncertainty; and they pass from the enthusiasm of pursuit to the\r\nexhaustion of ill-success, and lastly to the acrimony of disappointment.\r\nWhatever transcends their own limits appears to be an obstacle to their\r\ndesires, and there is no kind of superiority, however legitimate it may\r\nbe, which is not irksome in their sight.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the secret instinct, which leads the lower\r\norders to remove their superiors as much as possible from the direction\r\nof public affairs, is peculiar to France. This, however, is an error;\r\nthe propensity to which I allude is not inherent in any particular\r\nnation, but in democratic institutions in general; and although it may\r\nhave been heightened by peculiar political circumstances, it owes its\r\norigin to a higher cause.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the people is not disposed to hate the superior\r\nclass of society; but it is not very favorably inclined toward them, and\r\nit carefully excludes them from the exercise of authority. It does\r\nnot entertain any dread of distinguished talents, but it is rarely\r\ncaptivated by them; and it awards its approbation very sparingly to such\r\nas have risen without the popular support.\r\n\r\nWhile the natural propensities of democracy induce the people to reject\r\nthe most distinguished citizens as its rulers, these individuals are\r\nno less apt to retire from a political career, in which it is almost\r\nimpossible to retain their independence, or to advance without degrading\r\nthemselves. This opinion has been very candidly set forth by Chancellor\r\nKent, who says, in speaking with great eulogium of that part of the\r\nconstitution which empowers the executive to nominate the judges: \"It is\r\nindeed probable that the men who are best fitted to discharge the duties\r\nof this high office would have too much reserve in their manners, and\r\ntoo much austerity in their principles, for them to be returned by the\r\nmajority at an election where universal suffrage is adopted.\" Such were\r\nthe opinions which were printed without contradiction in America in the\r\nyear 1830.\r\n\r\nI hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated, that universal suffrage is\r\nby no means a guarantee of the wisdom of the popular choice; and that\r\nwhatever its advantages may be, this is not one of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCAUSES WHICH MAY PARTLY CORRECT THESE TENDENCIES OF THE DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nContrary Effects produced on Peoples as well as on individuals by great\r\nDangers.--Why so many distinguished Men stood at the Head of Affairs\r\nin America fifty Years ago.--Influence which the intelligence and\r\nthe Manners of the People exercise upon its choice.--Example of New\r\nEngland.--States of the Southwest--Influence of certain Laws upon the\r\nChoice of the People.--Election by an elected Body.--Its Effects upon\r\nthe Composition of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen a state is threatened by serious dangers, the people frequently\r\nsucceed in selecting the citizens who are the most able to save it.\r\nIt has been observed that man rarely retains his customary level in\r\npresence of very critical circumstances; he rises above, or he sinks\r\nbelow, his usual condition, and the same thing occurs in nations at\r\nlarge. Extreme perils sometimes quench the energy of a people instead of\r\nstimulating it; they excite without directing its passions; and instead\r\nof clearing, they confuse its powers of perception. The Jews deluged the\r\nsmoking ruins of their temples with the carnage of the remnant of their\r\nhost. But it is more common, both in the case of nations and in that\r\nof individuals, to find extraordinary virtues arising from the very\r\nimminence of the danger. Great characters are then thrown into\r\nrelief, as the edifices which are concealed by the gloom of night, are\r\nilluminated by the glare of a conflagration. At those dangerous times\r\ngenius no longer abstains from presenting itself in the arena; and\r\nthe people, alarmed by the perils of its situation, buries its envious\r\npassions in a short oblivion. Great names may then be drawn from the urn\r\nof an election.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that the American statesmen of the present day\r\nare very inferior to those who stood at the head of affairs fifty years\r\nago. This is as much a consequence of the circumstances, as of the\r\nlaws of the country. When America was struggling in the high cause of\r\nindependence to throw off the yoke of another country, and when it\r\nwas about to usher a new nation into the world, the spirits of its\r\ninhabitants were roused to the height which their great efforts\r\nrequired. In this general excitement, the most distinguished men were\r\nready to forestall the wants of the community, and the people clung\r\nto them for support, and placed them at its head. But events of this\r\nmagnitude are rare; and it is from an inspection of the ordinary course\r\nof affairs that our judgment must be formed.\r\n\r\nIf passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the passions of\r\ndemocracy, the intelligence and the manners of the community exercise\r\nan influence which is not less powerful, and far more permanent. This is\r\nextremely perceptible in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn New England the education and the liberties of the communities were\r\nengendered by the moral and religious principles of their founders.\r\nWhere society has acquired a sufficient degree of stability to enable it\r\nto hold certain maxims and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders\r\nare accustomed to respect intellectual superiority, and to submit to\r\nit without complaint, although they set at naught all those privileges\r\nwhich wealth and birth have introduced among mankind. The democracy\r\nin New England consequently makes a more judicious choice than it does\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut as we descend toward the south, to those states in which the\r\nconstitution of society is more modern and less strong, where\r\ninstruction is less general, and where the principles of morality, of\r\nreligion, and of liberty, are less happily combined, we perceive that\r\nthe talents and the virtues of those who are in authority become more\r\nand more rare.\r\n\r\nLastly, when we arrive at the new southwestern states, in which the\r\nconstitution of society dates but from yesterday, and presents an\r\nagglomeration of adventurers and speculators, we are amazed at the\r\npersons who are invested with public authority, and we are led to ask by\r\nwhat force, independent of the legislation and of the men who direct it,\r\nthe state can be protected, and society be made to flourish.\r\n\r\nThere are certain laws of a democratic nature which contribute,\r\nnevertheless, to correct, in some measure, the dangerous tendencies of\r\ndemocracy. On entering the house of representatives at Washington,\r\none is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. The eye\r\nfrequently does not discover a man of celebrity within its walls. Its\r\nmembers are almost all obscure individuals, whose names present no\r\nassociations to the mind: they are mostly village-lawyers, men in trade,\r\nor even persons belonging to the lower classes of society. In a country\r\nin which education is very general, it is said that the representatives\r\nof the people do not always know how to write correctly.\r\n\r\nAt a few yards distance from this spot is the door of the senate, which\r\ncontains within a small space a large proportion of the celebrated men\r\nof America. Scarcely an individual is to be perceived in it who does\r\nnot recall the idea of an active and illustrious career: the senate\r\nis composed of eloquent advocates, distinguished generals, wise\r\nmagistrates, and statesmen of note, whose language would at all times do\r\nhonor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the cause of this strange contrast, and why are the most\r\nable citizens to be found in one assembly rather than in the other?\r\nWhy is the former body remarkable for its vulgarity and its poverty of\r\ntalent, while the latter seems to enjoy a monopoly of intelligence and\r\nof sound judgment? Both of these assemblies emanate from the people;\r\nboth of them are chosen by universal suffrage; and no voice has hitherto\r\nbeen heard to assert, in America, that the senate is hostile to the\r\ninterests of the people. From what cause, then, does so startling a\r\ndifference arise? The only reason which appears to me adequately to\r\naccount for it is, that the house of representatives is elected by the\r\npopulace directly, and that of the senate is elected by elected bodies.\r\nThe whole body of the citizens names the legislature of each state,\r\nand the federal constitution converts these legislatures into so many\r\nelectoral bodies, which return the members of the senate. The senators\r\nare elected by an indirect application of universal suffrage; for the\r\nlegislatures which name them are not aristocratic or privileged bodies\r\nwhich exercise the electoral franchise in their own right; but they are\r\nchosen by the totality of the citizens; they are generally elected every\r\nyear, and new members may constantly be chosen, who will employ their\r\nelectoral rights in conformity with the wishes of the public. But this\r\ntransmission of the popular authority through an assembly of chosen\r\nmen, operates an important change in it, by refining its discretion and\r\nimproving the forms which it adopts. Men who are chosen in this manner,\r\naccurately represent the majority of the nation which governs them; but\r\nthey represent the elevated thoughts which are current in the community,\r\nthe generous propensities which prompt its nobler actions, rather than\r\nthe petty passions which disturb, or the vices which disgrace it.\r\n\r\nThe time may be already anticipated at which the American republics will\r\nbe obliged to introduce the plan of election by an elected body more\r\nfrequently into their system of representation, or they will incur no\r\nsmall risk of perishing miserably among the shoals of democracy.\r\n\r\nAnd here I have no scruple in confessing that I look upon this peculiar\r\nsystem of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of\r\npolitical power to the level of all classes of the people. Those\r\nthinkers who regard this institution as the exclusive weapon of a party,\r\nand those who fear, on the other hand, to make use of it, seem to me to\r\nfall into as great an error in the one case as in the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE WHICH THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY HAS EXERCISED ON THE LAWS\r\nRELATING TO ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen Elections are rare, they expose the State to a violent\r\nCrisis.--When they are frequent, they keep up a degree of feverish\r\nExcitement.--The Americans have preferred the second of these two\r\nEvils.--Mutability of the Laws.--Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson on\r\nthis Subject.\r\n\r\nWhen elections recur at long intervals, the state is exposed to violent\r\nagitation every time they take place. Parties exert themselves to the\r\nutmost in order to gain a prize which is so rarely within their reach;\r\nand as the evil is almost irremediable for the candidates who fail, the\r\nconsequence of their disappointed ambition may prove most disastrous:\r\nif, on the other hand, the legal struggle can be repeated within a short\r\nspace of time, the defeated parties take patience.\r\n\r\nWhen elections occur frequently, this recurrence keeps society in\r\na perpetual state of feverish excitement, and imparts a continual\r\ninstability to public affairs.\r\n\r\nThus, on the one hand, the state is exposed to the perils of a\r\nrevolution, on the other, to perpetual mutability; the former system\r\nthreatens the very existence of the government, the latter is an\r\nobstacle to all steady and consistent policy. The Americans have\r\npreferred the second of these evils to the first; but they were led to\r\nthis conclusion by their instinct much more than by their reason; for a\r\ntaste for variety is one of the characteristic passions of democracy. An\r\nextraordinary mutability has, by this means, been introduced into their\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nMany of the Americans consider the instability of their laws as a\r\nnecessary consequence of a system whose general results are beneficial.\r\nBut no one in the United States affects to deny the fact of this\r\ninstability, or to contend that it is not a great evil.\r\n\r\nHamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power which might\r\nprevent, or which might at least impede, the promulgation of bad laws,\r\nadds: \"It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws\r\nincludes that of preventing good ones, and may be used to the one\r\npurpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have but\r\nlittle weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that\r\ninconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest blemish\r\nin the character and genius of our government.\"--(Federalist, No. 73.)\r\n\r\nAnd again, in No. 62 of the same work, he observes: \"The facility and\r\nexcess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments\r\nare most liable.... The mischievous effects of the mutability in the\r\npublic councils arising from a rapid succession of new members, would\r\nfill a volume; every new election in the states is found to change one\r\nhalf of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed\r\na change of opinions and of measures which forfeits the respect and\r\nconfidence of nations, poisons the blessings of liberty itself, and\r\ndiminishes the attachment and reverence of the people toward a political\r\nsystem which betrays so many marks of infirmity.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson himself, the greatest democrat whom the democracy of America\r\nhas as yet produced, pointed out the same evils.\r\n\r\n\"The instability of our laws,\" he said in a letter to Madison, \"is\r\nreally a very serious inconvenience. I think we ought to have obviated\r\nit by deciding that a whole year should always be allowed to elapse\r\nbetween the bringing in of a bill and the final passing of it. It should\r\nafterward be discussed and put to the vote without the possibility\r\nof making any alteration in it; and if the circumstances of the case\r\nrequired a more speedy decision, the question should not be decided by\r\na simple majority, but by a majority of at least two thirds of both\r\nhouses.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUBLIC OFFICERS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRACY OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nSimple Exterior of the American public Officers.--No official\r\nCostume.--All public Officers are remunerated.--Political Consequences\r\nof this System.--No public Career exists in America.--Result of this.\r\n\r\nPublic officers in the United States are commingled with the crowd\r\nof citizens; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial\r\ncostumes. This simple exterior of the persons in authority is connected,\r\nnot only with the peculiarities of the American character, but with\r\nthe fundamental principles of that society. In the estimation of the\r\ndemocracy, a government is not a benefit, but a necessary evil. A\r\ncertain degree of power must be granted to public officers, for they\r\nwould be of no use without it. But the ostensible semblance of authority\r\nis by no means indispensable to the conduct of affairs; and it is\r\nneedlessly offensive to the susceptibility of the public. The public\r\nofficers themselves are well aware that they only enjoy the superiority\r\nover their fellow citizens, which they derive from their authority, upon\r\ncondition of putting themselves on a level with the whole community by\r\ntheir manners. A public officer in the United States is uniformly civil,\r\naccessible to all the world, attentive to all requests, and obliging in\r\nall his replies. I was pleased by these characteristics of a democratic\r\ngovernment; and I was struck by the manly independence of the citizens,\r\nwho respect the office more than the officer, and who are less attached\r\nto the emblems of authority than to the man who bears them.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the influence which costumes really\r\nexercise, in an age like that in which we live, has been a good deal\r\nexaggerated. I never perceived that a public officer in America was the\r\nless respected while he was in the discharge of his duties because his\r\nown merit was set off by no adventitious signs. On the other hand, it is\r\nvery doubtful whether a peculiar dress contributes to the respect which\r\npublic characters ought to have for their own position, at least when\r\nthey are not otherwise inclined to respect it. When a magistrate (and\r\nin France such instances are not rare), indulges his trivial wit at the\r\nexpense of a prisoner, or derides a predicament in which a culprit is\r\nplaced, it would be well to deprive him of his robes of office, to see\r\nwhether he would recall some portion of the natural dignity of mankind\r\nwhen he is reduced to the apparel of a private citizen.\r\n\r\nA democracy may, however, allow a certain show of magisterial pomp, and\r\nclothe its officers in silks and gold, without seriously compromising\r\nits principles. Privileges of this kind are transitory; they belong to\r\nthe place, and are distinct from the individual: but if public officers\r\nare not uniformly remunerated by the state, the public charges must be\r\nintrusted to men of opulence and independence, who constitute the\r\nbasis of an aristocracy; and if the people still retains its right\r\nof election, that election can only be made from a certain class of\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nWhen a democratic republic renders offices which had formerly been\r\nremunerated, gratuitous, it may safely be believed that that state is\r\nadvancing to monarchical institutions; and when a monarchy begins to\r\nremunerate such officers as had hitherto been unpaid, it is a sure\r\nsign that it is approaching toward a despotic or a republican form of\r\ngovernment. The substitution of paid for unpaid functionaries is of\r\nitself, in my opinion, sufficient to constitute a serious revolution.\r\n\r\nI look upon the entire absence of gratuitous functionaries in America as\r\none of the most prominent signs of the absolute dominion which democracy\r\nexercises in that country. All public services, of whatsoever nature\r\nthey may be, are paid; so that every one has not merely a right, but\r\nalso the means of performing them. Although, in democratic states, all\r\nthe citizens are qualified to occupy stations in the government, all\r\nare not tempted to try for them. The number and the capacities of the\r\ncandidates are more apt to restrict the choice of electors than the\r\nconditions of the candidateship.\r\n\r\nIn nations in which the principle of election extends to every place in\r\nthe state, no political career can, properly speaking, be said to exist.\r\nMen are promoted as if by chance to the rank which they enjoy, and\r\nthey are by no means sure of retaining it. The consequence is that in\r\ntranquil times public functions offer but few lures to ambition. In the\r\nUnited States the persons who engage in the perplexities of political\r\nlife are individuals of very moderate pretensions. The pursuit of wealth\r\ngenerally diverts men of great talents and of great passions from the\r\npursuit of power; and it very frequently happens that a man does not\r\nundertake to direct the fortune of the state until he has discovered\r\nhis incompetence to conduct his own affairs. The vast number of very\r\nordinary men who occupy public stations is quite as attributable to\r\nthese causes as to the bad choice of the democracy. In the United\r\nStates, I am not sure that the people would return the men of superior\r\nabilities who might solicit its support, but it is certain that men of\r\nthis description do not come forward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nARBITRARY POWER OF MAGISTRATES[164] UNDER THE RULE OF AMERICAN\r\nDEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nFor what Reason the arbitrary Power of Magistrates is greater in\r\nabsolute Monarchies and in democratic Republics that it is in limited\r\nMonarchies.--Arbitrary Power of the Magistrates in New England.\r\n\r\nIn two different kinds of government the magistrates exercise a\r\nconsiderable degree of arbitrary power; namely, under the absolute\r\ngovernment of a single individual, and under that of a democracy.\r\n\r\nThis identical result proceeds from causes which are nearly analogous.\r\n\r\nIn despotic states the fortune of no citizen is secure; and public\r\nofficers are not more safe than private individuals. The sovereign, who\r\nhas under his control the lives, the property, and sometimes the honor\r\nof the men whom he employs, does not scruple to allow them a great\r\nlatitude of action, because he is convinced that they will not use it\r\nto his prejudice. In despotic states the sovereign is so attached to the\r\nexercise of his power, that he dislikes the constraint even of his own\r\nregulations; and he is well pleased that his agents should follow a\r\nsomewhat fortuitous line of conduct, provided he be certain that their\r\nactions will never counteract his desires.\r\n\r\nIn democracies, as the majority has every year the right of depriving\r\nthe officers whom it has appointed of their power, it has no reason to\r\nfear abuse of their authority. As the people is always able to signify\r\nits wishes to those who conduct the government, it prefers leaving\r\nthem to make their own exertions, to prescribing an invariable rule\r\nof conduct which would at once fetter their activity and the popular\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIt may even be observed, on attentive consideration, that under the\r\nrule of a democracy the arbitrary power of the magistrate must be still\r\ngreater than in despotic states. In the latter, the sovereign has the\r\npower of punishing all the faults with which he becomes acquainted, but\r\nit would be vain for him to hope to become acquainted with all those\r\nwhich are committed. In the former the sovereign power is not only\r\nsupreme, but it is universally present. The American functionaries are,\r\nin point of fact, much more independent in the sphere of action which\r\nthe law traces out for them, than any public officer in Europe. Very\r\nfrequently the object which they are to accomplish is simply pointed out\r\nto them, and the choice of the means is left to their own discretion.\r\n\r\nIn New England, for instance, the selectmen of each township are bound\r\nto draw up the list of persons who are to serve on the jury; the only\r\nrule which is laid down to guide them in their choice is that they are\r\nto select citizens possessing the elective franchise and enjoying a fair\r\nreputation.[165] In France the lives and liberties of the subjects\r\nwould be thought to be in danger, if a public officer of any kind\r\nwas intrusted with so formidable a right. In New England, the same\r\nmagistrates are empowered to post the names of habitual drunkards in\r\npublic houses, and to prohibit the inhabitants of a town from supplying\r\nthem with liquor.[166] A censorial power of this excessive kind would\r\nbe revolting to the population of the most absolute monarchies; here,\r\nhowever, it is submitted to without difficulty.\r\n\r\nNowhere has so much been left by the law to the arbitrary determination\r\nof the magistrates as in democratic republics, because this arbitrary\r\npower is unattended by any alarming consequences. It may even be\r\nasserted that the freedom of the magistrate increases as the elective\r\nfranchise is extended, and as the duration of the time of office\r\nis shortened. Hence arises the great difficulty which attends the\r\nconversion of a democratic republic into a monarchy. The magistrate\r\nceases to be elective, but he retains the rights and the habits of an\r\nelected officer, which lead directly to despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is only in limited monarchies that the law which prescribes the\r\nsphere in which public officers are to act, superintends all their\r\nmeasures. The cause of this may be easily detected. In limited\r\nmonarchies the power is divided between the king and the people, both\r\nof whom are interested in the stability of the magistrate. The king\r\ndoes not venture to place the public officers under the control of the\r\npeople, lest they should be tempted to betray his interests; on the\r\nother hand, the people fears lest the magistrates should serve to\r\noppress the liberties of the country, if they were entirely dependent\r\nupon the crown: they cannot therefore be said to depend on either the\r\none or the other. The same cause which induces the king and the people\r\nto render public officers independent, suggests the necessity of such\r\nsecurities as may prevent their independence from encroaching upon\r\nthe authority of the former and the liberties of the latter. They\r\nconsequently agree as to the necessity of restricting the functionary\r\nto a line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they are interested in\r\nconfining him by certain regulations which he cannot evade.\r\n\r\n[The observations respecting the arbitrary powers of magistrates are\r\npractically among the most erroneous in the work. The author seems to\r\nhave confounded the idea of magistrates being _independent_ with their\r\nbeing arbitrary. Yet he had just before spoken of their dependance on\r\npopular election as a reason why there was no apprehension of the abuse\r\nof their authority. The independence, then, to which he alludes must\r\nbe an immunity from responsibility to any other department. But it is\r\na fundamental principle of our system, that all officers are liable to\r\ncriminal prosecution \"whenever they act partially or oppressively from\r\na malicious or corrupt motive.\" See 15 Wendell's Reports, 278. That\r\nour magistrates are independent when they do not act partially or\r\noppressively is very true, and, it is to be hoped, is equally true in\r\nevery form of government. There would seem, therefore, not to be such\r\na degree of independence as necessarily to produce arbitrariness. The\r\nauthor supposes that magistrates are more arbitrary in a despotism\r\nand in a democracy than in a limited monarchy. And yet, the limits of\r\nindependence and of responsibility existing in the United States are\r\nborrowed from and identical with those established in England--the most\r\nprominent instance of a limited monarchy. See the authorities referred\r\nto in the case in Wendell's Reports, before quoted. Discretion in\r\nthe execution of various ministerial duties, and in the awarding of\r\npunishment by judicial officers, is indispensable in every system of\r\ngovernment, from the utter impossibility of \"laying down beforehand a\r\nline of conduct\" (as the author expresses it) in such cases. The very\r\ninstances of discretionary power to which he refers, and which he\r\nconsiders _arbitrary_, exist in England. There, the persons from whom\r\njuries are to be formed for the trial of causes, civil and criminal,\r\nare selected by the sheriffs, who are appointed by the crown--a\r\npower, certainly more liable to abuse in their hands, than in those of\r\nselectmen or other town-officers, chosen annually by the people.\r\nThe other power referred to, that of posting the names of habitual\r\ndrunkards, and forbidding their being supplied with liquor, is but a\r\nreiteration of the principles contained in the English statute of 32\r\nGeo. III., ch. 45, respecting idle and disorderly persons. Indeed it\r\nmay be said with great confidence, that there is not an instance of\r\ndiscretionary power being vested in American magistrates which does not\r\nfind its prototype in the English laws. The whole argument of the author\r\non this point, therefore, would seem to fail.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINSTABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nIn America the public Acts of a Community frequently leave fewer Traces\r\nthan the Occurrences of a Family.--Newspapers the only historical\r\nRemains.--Instability of the Administration prejudicial to the Art of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe authority which public men possess in America is so brief, and they\r\nare so soon commingled with the ever-changing population of the country,\r\nthat the acts of a community frequently leave fewer traces than the\r\noccurrences of a private family. The public administration is, so to\r\nspeak, oral and traditionary. But little is committed to writing, and\r\nthat little is wafted away for ever, like the leaves of the sibyl, by\r\nthe smallest breeze.\r\n\r\nThe only historical remains in the United States are the newspapers; but\r\nif a number be wanting, the chain of time is broken, and the present\r\nis severed from the past. I am convinced that in fifty years it will\r\nbe more difficult to collect authentic documents concerning the social\r\ncondition of the Americans at the present day, than it is to find\r\nremains of the administration of France during the middle ages; and if\r\nthe United States were ever invaded by barbarians, it would be necessary\r\nto have recourse to the history of other nations, in order to learn\r\nanything of the people which now inhabits them.\r\n\r\nThe instability of the administration has penetrated into the habits of\r\nthe people: it even appears to suit the general taste, and no one cares\r\nfor what occurred before his time. No methodical system is pursued; no\r\narchives are formed; and no documents are brought together when it would\r\nbe very easy to do so. Where they exist little store is set upon them;\r\nand I have among my papers several original public documents which were\r\ngiven to me in answer to some of my inquiries. In America society seems\r\nto live from hand to mouth, like an army in the field. Nevertheless,\r\nthe art of administration may undoubtedly be ranked as a science, and\r\nno sciences can be improved, if the discoveries and observations of\r\nsuccessive generations are not connected together in the order in which\r\nthey occur. One man, in the short space of his life, remarks a fact;\r\nanother conceives an idea; the former invents a means of execution, the\r\nlatter reduces a truth to a fixed proposition; and mankind gathers the\r\nfruits of individual experience upon its way, and gradually forms the\r\nsciences. But the persons who conduct the administration in America can\r\nseldom afford any instruction to each other; and when they assume the\r\ndirection of society, they simply possess those attainments which are\r\nmost widely disseminated in the community, and no experience peculiar\r\nto themselves. Democracy, carried to its farthest limits, is therefore\r\nprejudicial to the art of government; and for this reason it is better\r\nadapted to a people already versed in the conduct of an administration,\r\nthan to a nation which is uninitiated in public affairs.\r\n\r\nThis remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the science of\r\nadministration. Although a democratic government is founded upon a very\r\nsimple and natural principle, it always presupposes the existence of a\r\nhigh degree of culture and enlightenment in society.[167] At the first\r\nglance it may be imagined to belong to the earliest ages of the world;\r\nbut maturer observation will convince us that it could only come last in\r\nthe succession of human history.\r\n\r\n[These remarks upon the \"instability of administration\" in America,\r\nare partly correct, but partly erroneous. It is certainly true that\r\nour public men are not educated to the business of government; even our\r\ndiplomatists are selected with very little reference to their experience\r\nin that department. But the universal attention that is paid by the\r\nintelligent, to the measures of government and to the discussions\r\nto which they give rise, is in itself no slight preparation for\r\nthe ordinary duties of legislation. And, indeed, this the author\r\nsubsequently seems to admit. As to there being \"no archives formed\"\r\nof public documents, the author is certainly mistaken. The journals\r\nof congress, the journals of state legislatures, the public documents\r\ntransmitted to and originating in those bodies, are carefully preserved\r\nand disseminated through the nation: and they furnish in themselves the\r\nmaterials of a full and accurate history. Our great defect, doubtless,\r\nis in the want of statistical information. Excepting the annual reports\r\nof the state of our commerce, made by the secretary of the treasury,\r\nunder law, and excepting the census which is taken every ten years under\r\nthe authority of congress, and those taken by the states, we have no\r\nofficial statistics. It is supposed that the author had this species of\r\ninformation in his mind when he alluded to the general deficiency of our\r\narchives.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHARGES LEVIED BY THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nIn all Communities Citizens divisible into three Classes.--Habits of\r\neach of these Classes in the Direction of public Finances.--Why public\r\nExpenditures must tend to increase when the People governs.--What\r\nrenders the Extravagance of a Democracy less to be feared in\r\nAmerica.--Public Expenditure under a Democracy.\r\n\r\nBefore we can affirm whether a democratic form of government is\r\neconomical or not, we must establish a suitable standard of comparison.\r\nThe question would be one of easy solution if we were to attempt to draw\r\na parallel between a democratic republic and an absolute monarchy. The\r\npublic expenditure would be found to be more considerable under the\r\nformer than under the latter; such is the case with all free states\r\ncompared to those which are not so. It is certain that despotism ruins\r\nindividuals by preventing them from producing wealth, much more than by\r\ndepriving them of the wealth they have produced: it dries up the source\r\nof riches, while it usually respects acquired property. Freedom, on the\r\ncontrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and the nations\r\nwhich are favored by free institutions, invariably find that their\r\nresources increase even more rapidly than their taxes.\r\n\r\nMy present object is to compare free nations to each other; and to point\r\nout the influence of democracy upon the finances of a state.\r\n\r\nCommunities, as well as organic bodies, are subject to certain fixed\r\nrules in their formation which they cannot evade. They are composed of\r\ncertain elements which are common to them at all times and under all\r\ncircumstances. The people may always be mentally divided into three\r\ndistinct classes. The first of these classes consists of the wealthy;\r\nthe second, of those who are in easy circumstances; and the third is\r\ncomposed of those who have little or no property, and who subsist more\r\nespecially by the work which they perform for the two superior orders.\r\nThe proportion of the individuals who are included in these three\r\ndivisions may vary according to the condition of society; but the\r\ndivisions themselves can never be obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that each of these classes will exercise an influence,\r\npeculiar to its own propensities, upon the administration of the\r\nfinances of the state. If the first of the three exclusively possess\r\nthe legislative power, it is probable that it will not be sparing of the\r\npublic funds, because the taxes which are levied on a large fortune only\r\ntend to diminish the sum of superfluous enjoyment, and are, in point of\r\nfact, but little felt. If the second class has the power of making the\r\nlaws, it will certainly not be lavish of taxes, because nothing is\r\nso onerous as a large impost which is levied upon a small income.\r\nThe government of the middle classes appears to me to be the most\r\neconomical, though perhaps not the most enlightened, and certainly not\r\nthe most generous, of free governments.\r\n\r\nBut let us now suppose that the legislative authority is vested in\r\nthe lowest orders: there are two striking reasons which show that the\r\ntendency of the expenditure will be to increase, not to diminish.\r\n\r\nAs the great majority of those who create the laws are possessed of no\r\nproperty upon which taxes can be imposed, all the money which is spent\r\nfor the community appears to be spent to their advantage, at no cost of\r\ntheir own; and those who are possessed of some little property readily\r\nfind means of regulating the taxes so that they are burthensome to the\r\nwealthy and profitable to the poor, although the rich are unable to take\r\nthe same advantage when they are in possession of the government.\r\n\r\nIn countries in which the poor[168] should be exclusively invested with\r\nthe power of making the laws, no great economy of public expenditure\r\nought to be expected; that expenditure will always be considerable;\r\neither because the taxes do not weigh upon those who levy them, or\r\nbecause they are levied in such a manner as not to weigh upon those\r\nclasses. In other words, the government of the democracy is the only one\r\nunder which the power which lays on taxes escapes the payment of them.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected (but the argument has no real weight) that the\r\ntrue interest of the people is indissolubly connected with that of the\r\nwealthier portion of the community, since it cannot but suffer by the\r\nsevere measures to which it resorts. But is it not the true interest of\r\nkings to render their subjects happy; and the true interest of nobles\r\nto admit recruits into their order on suitable grounds? If remote\r\nadvantages had power to prevail over the passions and the exigencies\r\nof the moment, no such thing as a tyrannical sovereign or an exclusive\r\naristocracy could ever exist.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be objected that the poor are never invested with the sole\r\npower of making the laws; but I reply, that wherever universal suffrage\r\nhas been established, the majority of the community unquestionably\r\nexercises the legislative authority, and if it be proved that the poor\r\nalways constitute the majority, it may be added, with perfect truth,\r\nthat in the countries in which they possess the elective franchise, they\r\npossess the sole power of making laws. But it is certain that in all the\r\nnations of the world the greater number has always consisted of those\r\npersons who hold no property, or of those whose property is insufficient\r\nto exempt them from the necessity of working in order to procure an easy\r\nsubsistence. Universal suffrage does therefore in point of fact invest\r\nthe poor with the government of society.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous influence which popular authority may sometimes exercise\r\nupon the finances of a state, was very clearly seen in some of the\r\ndemocratic republics of antiquity, in which the public treasure was\r\nexhausted in order to relieve indigent citizens, or to supply the\r\ngames and theatrical amusements of the populace. It is true that the\r\nrepresentative system was then very imperfectly known, and that, at\r\nthe present time, the influence of popular passions is less felt in the\r\nconduct of public affairs; but it may be believed that the delegate\r\nwill in the end conform to the principles of his constituents, and favor\r\ntheir propensities as much as their interests.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of democracy is, however, less to be dreaded in\r\nproportion as the people acquires a share of property, because on the\r\none hand the contributions of the rich are then less needed, and on\r\nthe other, it is more difficult to lay on taxes which do not affect the\r\ninterests of the lower classes. On this account universal suffrage\r\nwould be less dangerous in France than in England, because in the latter\r\ncountry the property on which taxes may be levied is vested in fewer\r\nhands. America, where the great majority of the citizens is possessed of\r\nsome fortune, is in a still more favorable position than France.\r\n\r\nThere are still farther causes which may increase the sum of public\r\nexpenditures in democratic countries. When the aristocracy governs, the\r\nindividuals who conduct the affairs of state are exempted, by their own\r\nstation in society, from every kind of privation: they are contented\r\nwith their position; power and renown are the objects for which they\r\nstrive; and, as they are placed far above the obscurer throng of\r\ncitizens, they do not always distinctly perceive how the wellbeing of\r\nthe mass of the people ought to redound to their own honor. They are\r\nnot indeed, callous to the sufferings of the poor, but they cannot feel\r\nthose miseries as acutely as if they were themselves partakers of them.\r\nProvided that the people appear to submit to its lot, the rulers are\r\nsatisfied and they demand nothing farther from the government. An\r\naristocracy is more intent upon the means of maintaining its influence,\r\nthan upon the means of improving its condition.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, the people is invested with the supreme\r\nauthority, the perpetual sense of their own miseries impels the rulers\r\nof society to seek for perpetual meliorations. A thousand different\r\nobjects are subjected to improvement; the most trivial details are\r\nsought out as susceptible of amendment; and those changes which are\r\naccompanied with considerable expense, are more especially advocated,\r\nsince the object is to render the condition of the poor more tolerable,\r\nwho cannot pay for themselves.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all democratic communities are agitated by an ill-defined\r\nexcitement, and by a kind of feverish impatience, that engenders a\r\nmultitude of innovations, almost all of which are attended with expense.\r\n\r\nIn monarchies and aristocracies, the natural taste which the rulers have\r\nfor power and for renown, is stimulated by the promptings of ambition,\r\nand they are frequently incited by these temptations to very costly\r\nundertakings. In democracies, where the rulers labor under privations,\r\nthey can only be courted by such means as improve their wellbeing, and\r\nthese improvements cannot take place without a sacrifice of money. When\r\na people begins to reflect upon its situation, it discovers a multitude\r\nof wants, to which it had not before been subject, and to satisfy these\r\nexigencies, recourse must be had to the coffers of the state. Hence it\r\narises, that the public charges increase in proportion as civilisation\r\nspreads, and that the imposts are augmented as knowledge pervades the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe last cause which frequently renders a democratic government\r\ndearer than any other is, that a democracy does not always succeed in\r\nmoderating its expenditure, because it does not understand the art of\r\nbeing economical. As the designs which it entertains are frequently\r\nchanged, and the agents of those designs are more frequently removed,\r\nits undertakings are often ill-conducted or left unfinished; in the\r\nformer case the state spends sums out of all proportion to the end\r\nwhich it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the expense itself is\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTENDENCIES OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS REGARDS THE SALARIES OF PUBLIC\r\nOFFICERS.\r\n\r\nIn Democracies those who establish high Salaries have no Chance of\r\nprofiting by them.--Tendency of the American Democracy to increase\r\nthe Salaries of subordinate Officers, and to lower those of the more\r\nimportant functionaries.--Reason of this.--Comparative Statement of the\r\nSalaries of public Officers in the United States and in France.\r\n\r\nThere is a powerful reason which usually induces democracies to\r\neconomise upon the salaries of public officers. As the number of\r\ncitizens who dispense the remuneration is extremely large in democratic\r\ncountries, so the number of persons who can hope to be benefited by the\r\nreceipt of it is comparatively small. In aristocratic countries, on the\r\ncontrary, the individuals who appoint high salaries, have almost always\r\na vague hope of profiting by them. These appointments may be looked\r\nupon as a capital which they create for their own use, or at least, as a\r\nresource for their children.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be allowed that a democratic state is most\r\nparsimonious toward its principal agents. In America the secondary\r\nofficers are much better paid, and the dignitaries of the administration\r\nmuch worse than they are elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThese opposite effects result from the same cause: the people fixes\r\nthe salaries of the public officers in both cases; and the scale of\r\nremuneration is determined by the consideration of its own wants. It is\r\nheld to be fair that the servants of the public should be placed in the\r\nsame easy circumstances as the public itself;[169] but when the question\r\nturns upon the salaries of the great officers of state, this rule\r\nfails, and chance alone can guide the popular decision. The poor have\r\nno adequate conceptions of the wants which the higher classes of society\r\nmay feel. The sum which is scanty to the rich, appears enormous to the\r\npoor man, whose wants do not extend beyond the necessaries of life: and\r\nin his estimation the governor of a state, with his two or three hundred\r\na year, is a very fortunate and enviable being.[170] If you undertake to\r\nconvince him that the representative of a great people ought to be able\r\nto maintain some show of splendor in the eyes of foreign nations, he\r\nwill perhaps assent to your meaning; but when he reflects on his own\r\nhumble dwelling, and on the hard-earned produce of his wearisome\r\ntoil, he remembers all that he could do with a salary which you say is\r\ninsufficient, and he is startled or almost frightened at the sight of\r\nsuch uncommon wealth. Besides, the secondary public officer is almost\r\non a level with the people, while the others are raised above it. The\r\nformer may therefore excite his interest, but the latter begins to\r\narouse his envy.\r\n\r\nThis is very clearly seen in the United States, where the salaries seem\r\nto decrease as the authority of those who receive them augments.[171]\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of an aristocracy it frequently happens, on the contrary,\r\nthat while the high officers are receiving munificent salaries, the\r\ninferior ones have not more than enough to procure the necessaries of\r\nlife. The reason of this fact is easily discoverable from causes very\r\nanalogous to those to which I have just alluded. If a democracy is\r\nunable to conceive the pleasures of the rich, or to see them without\r\nenvy, an aristocracy is slow to understand, or, to speak more correctly,\r\nis unacquainted with the privations of the poor. The poor man is not (if\r\nwe use the term aright) the fellow of the rich one; but he is the being\r\nof another species. An aristocracy is therefore apt to care but little\r\nfor the fate of its subordinate agents: and their salaries are only\r\nraised when they refuse to perform their service for too scanty a\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\nIt is the parsimonious conduct of democracy toward its principal\r\nofficers, which has countenanced a supposition of far more economical\r\npropensities than any which it really possesses. It is true that it\r\nscarcely allows the means of honorable subsistence to the individuals\r\nwho conduct its affairs; but enormous sums are lavished to meet the\r\nexigencies or to facilitate the enjoyments of the people.[172] The\r\nmoney raised by taxation may be better employed, but it is not saved. In\r\ngeneral, democracy gives largely to the community, and very sparingly\r\nto those who govern it. The reverse is the case in the aristocratic\r\ncountries, where the money of the state is expended to the profit of the\r\npersons who are at the head of affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY OF DISTINGUISHING THE CAUSES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY\r\nOF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nWe are liable to frequent errors in the research of those facts which\r\nexercise a serious influence upon the fate of mankind, since nothing\r\nis more difficult than to appreciate their real value. One people\r\nis naturally inconsistent and enthusiastic; another is sober and\r\ncalculating; and these characteristics originate in their physical\r\nconstitution, or in remote causes with which we are unacquainted.\r\n\r\nThere are nations which are fond of parade and the bustle of festivity,\r\nand which do not regret the costly gaieties of an hour. Others, on\r\nthe contrary, are attached to more retiring pleasures, and seem almost\r\nashamed of appearing to be pleased. In some countries the highest value\r\nis set upon the beauty of public edifices; in others the productions of\r\nart are treated with indifference, and everything which is unproductive\r\nis looked down upon with contempt. In some renown, in others money, is\r\nthe ruling passion.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the laws, all these causes concur to exercise a very\r\npowerful influence upon the conduct of the finances of the state. If the\r\nAmericans never spend the money of the people in galas, it is not only\r\nbecause the imposition of taxes is under the control of the people,\r\nbut because the people takes no delight in public rejoicings. If they\r\nrepudiate all ornament from their architecture, and set no store on any\r\nbut the more practical and homely advantages, it is not only because\r\nthey live under democratic institutions, but because they are a\r\ncommercial nation. The habits of private life are continued in public;\r\nand we ought carefully to distinguish that economy which depends upon\r\ntheir institutions, from that which is the natural result of their\r\nmanners and customs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHETHER THE EXPENDITURE OF THE UNITED STATES CAN BE COMPARED TO THAT OF\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nTwo Points to be established in order to estimate the Extent of\r\nthe public Charges, viz.: the national Wealth, and the Rate of\r\nTaxation.--The Wealth and the Charges of France not accurately\r\nknown.--Why the Wealth and Charges of the Union cannot be accurately\r\nknown.--Researches of the Author with a View to discover the Amount of\r\nTaxation in Pennsylvania.--General Symptoms which may serve to indicate\r\nthe Amount of the public Charges in a given Nation.--Result of this\r\nInvestigation for the Union.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have recently been made in France to compare the public\r\nexpenditure of that country with the expenditure of the United States;\r\nall these attempts have, however, been unattended by success; and a few\r\nwords will suffice to show that they could not have had a satisfactory\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the amount of the public charges of a people, two\r\npreliminaries are indispensable; it is necessary, in the first place, to\r\nknow the wealth of that people; and in the second, to learn what portion\r\nof that wealth is devoted to the expenditure of the state. To show the\r\namount of taxation without showing the resources which are destined\r\nto meet the demand, is to undertake a futile labor; for it is not the\r\nexpenditure, but the relation of the expenditure to the revenue, which\r\nit is desirable to know.\r\n\r\nThe same rate of taxation which may easily be supported by a wealthy\r\ncontributor, will reduce a poor one to extreme misery. The wealth of\r\nnations is composed of several distinct elements, of which population\r\nis the first, real property the second, and personal property the third.\r\nThe first of these three elements may be discovered without difficulty.\r\n\r\nAmong civilized nations it is easy to obtain an accurate census of\r\nthe inhabitants; but the two others cannot be determined with so much\r\nfacility. It is difficult to take an exact account of all the lands in\r\na country which are under cultivation, with their natural or their\r\nacquired value; and it is still more impossible to estimate the entire\r\npersonal property which is at the disposal of the nation, and which\r\neludes the strictest analysis by the diversity and number of shapes\r\nunder which it may occur. And, indeed, we find that the most ancient\r\ncivilized nations of Europe, including even those in which the\r\nadministration is most central, have not succeeded, as yet, in\r\ndetermining the exact condition of their wealth.\r\n\r\nIn America the attempt has never been made; for how would such an\r\ninvestigation be possible in a country where society has not yet\r\nsettled into habits of regularity and tranquillity; where the national\r\ngovernment is not assisted by a multitude of agents whose exertions it\r\ncan command, and direct to one sole end; and where statistics are not\r\nstudied, because no one is able to collect the necessary documents,\r\nor can find time to peruse them? Thus the primary elements of the\r\ncalculations which have been made in France, cannot be obtained in the\r\nUnion; the relative wealth of the two countries is unknown: the property\r\nof the former is not accurately determined, and no means exist of\r\ncomputing that of the latter.\r\n\r\nI consent, therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to abandon this\r\nnecessary term of the comparison, and I confine myself to a computation\r\nof the actual amount of taxation, without investigating the relation\r\nwhich subsists between the taxation and the revenue. But the reader will\r\nperceive that my task has not been facilitated by the limits which I\r\nhere lay down for my researches.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the central administration of France, assisted\r\nby all the public officers who are at its disposal, might determine with\r\nexactitude the amount of the direct and indirect taxes levied upon\r\nthe citizens. But this investigation, which no private individual can\r\nundertake, has not hitherto been completed by the French government, or,\r\nat least, its results have not been made public. We are acquainted\r\nwith the sum total of the state; we know the amount of the departmental\r\nexpenditure; but the expenses of the communal divisions have not been\r\ncomputed, and the amount of the public expenses of France is unknown.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to America, we shall perceive that the difficulties are\r\nmultiplied and enhanced. The Union publishes an exact return of the\r\namount of its expenditure; the budgets of the four-and-twenty states\r\nfurnish similar returns of their revenues; but the expenses incident to\r\nthe affairs of the counties and the townships are unknown.[173]\r\n\r\nThe authority of the federal government cannot oblige the provincial\r\ngovernments to throw any light upon this point; and even if these\r\ngovernments were inclined to afford their simultaneous co-operation,\r\nit may be doubted whether they possess the means of procuring a\r\nsatisfactory answer. Independently of the natural difficulties of the\r\ntask, the political organization of the country would act as a hindrance\r\nto the success of their efforts. The county and town magistrates are not\r\nappointed by the authorities of the state, and they are not subjected\r\nto their control. It is therefore very allowable to suppose, that if\r\nthe state was desirous of obtaining the returns which we require,\r\nits designs would be counteracted by the neglect of those subordinate\r\nofficers whom it would be obliged to employ.[174] It is, in point of\r\nfact, useless to inquire what the Americans might do to forward this\r\ninquiry, since it is certain that they have hitherto done nothing at\r\nall. There does not exist a single individual at the present day, in\r\nAmerica or in Europe, who can inform us what each citizen of the Union\r\nannually contributes to the public charges of the nation.[175]\r\n\r\nIf I attempt to compare the French budget with the budget of the Union,\r\nit must be remembered that the latter embraces much fewer objects than\r\nthe central government of the former country, and that the expenditure\r\nmust consequently be much smaller. If I contrast the budgets of the\r\ndepartments to those of the states which constitute the Union, it must\r\nbe observed, that as the power and control exercised by the states is\r\nmuch greater than that which is exercised by the departments, their\r\nexpenditure is also more considerable. As for the budgets of the\r\ncounties, nothing of the kind occurs in the French system of finance;\r\nand it is, again, doubtful whether the corresponding expenses should\r\nbe referred to the budget of the state or to those of the municipal\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nMunicipal expenses exist in both countries, but they are not always\r\nanalogous. In America the townships discharge a variety of offices\r\nwhich are reserved in France to the departments or the state. It may,\r\nmoreover, be asked, what is to be understood by the municipal expenses\r\nof America. The organization of the municipal bodies or townships\r\ndiffers in the several states: Are we to be guided by what occurs in New\r\nEngland or in Georgia, in Pennsylvania or the state of Illinois?\r\n\r\nA kind of analogy may very readily be perceived between certain budgets\r\nin the two countries: but as the elements of which they are composed\r\nalways differ more or less, no fair comparison can be instituted between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHence we must conclude, that it is no less difficult to compare the\r\nsocial expenditure, than it is to estimate the relative wealth of France\r\nand of America. I will even add, that it would be dangerous to attempt\r\nthis comparison; for when statistics are not founded upon computations\r\nwhich are strictly accurate, they mislead instead of guiding aright. The\r\nmind is easily imposed upon by the false affectation of exactitude which\r\nprevails even in the mis-statements of the science, and adopts with\r\nconfidence the errors which are apparelled in the forms of mathematical\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nWe abandon, therefore, our numerical investigation, with the hope of\r\nmeeting with data of another kind. In the absence of positive documents,\r\nwe may form an opinion as to the proportion which the taxation of a\r\npeople bears to its real prosperity, by observing whether its external\r\nappearance is flourishing; whether, after having discharged the calls of\r\nthe state, the poor man retains the means of subsistence, and the rich\r\nthe means of enjoyment; and whether both classes are contented with\r\ntheir position, seeking however to meliorate it by perpetual exertions,\r\nso that industry is never in want of capital, nor capital unemployed by\r\nindustry. The observer who draws his inferences from these signs will,\r\nundoubtedly, be led to the conclusion, that the American of the United\r\nStates contributes a much smaller portion of his income to the state\r\nthan the citizen of France. Nor, indeed, can the result be otherwise.\r\n\r\nA portion of the French debt is the consequence of two successive\r\ninvasions; and the Union has no similar calamity to fear. A nation\r\nplaced upon the continent of Europe is obliged to maintain a large\r\nstanding army; the isolated position of the Union enables it to have\r\nonly 6,000 soldiers. The French have a fleet of 300 sail; the Americans\r\nhave 52 vessels.[176] How, then, can the inhabitant of the Union be\r\ncalled upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitant of France?\r\nNo parallel can be drawn between the finances of two countries so\r\ndifferently situated.\r\n\r\nIt is by examining what actually takes place in the Union, and not\r\nby comparing the Union with France, that we may discover whether the\r\nAmerican government is really economical. On casting my eyes over the\r\ndifferent republics which form the confederation, I perceive that their\r\ngovernments lack perseverance in their undertakings, and that they\r\nexercise no steady control over the men whom they employ. Whence I\r\nnaturally infer, that they must often spend the money of the people\r\nto no purpose, or consume more of it than is really necessary to their\r\nundertakings. Great efforts are made, in accordance with the democratic\r\norigin of society, to satisfy the exigencies of the lower orders, to\r\nopen the career of power to their endeavors, and to diffuse knowledge\r\nand comfort among them. The poor are maintained, immense sums are\r\nannually devoted to public instruction, all services whatsoever are\r\nremunerated, and the most subordinate agents are liberally paid. If\r\nthis kind of government appears to me to be useful and rational, I am\r\nnevertheless constrained to admit that it is expensive.\r\n\r\nWherever the poor direct public affairs and dispose of the national\r\nresources, it appears certain, that as they profit by the expenditure of\r\nthe state, they are apt to augment that expenditure.\r\n\r\nI conclude therefore, without having recourse to inaccurate\r\ncomputations, and without hazarding a comparison which might prove\r\nincorrect, that the democratic government of the Americans is not a\r\ncheap government, as is sometimes asserted; and I have no hesitation in\r\npredicting, that if the people of the United States is ever involved\r\nin serious difficulties, its taxation will speedily be increased to the\r\nrate of that which prevails in the greater part of the aristocracies and\r\nthe monarchies of Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCORRUPTION AND VICES OF THE RULERS IN A DEMOCRACY, AND CONSEQUENT\r\nEFFECTS UPON PUBLIC MORALITY.\r\n\r\nIn Aristocracies Rulers sometimes endeavor to corrupt the People.--In\r\nDemocracies Rulers frequently show themselves to be corrupt.--In the\r\nformer their Vices are directly prejudicial to the Morality of\r\nthe People.--In the latter their indirect Influence is still more\r\npernicious.\r\n\r\nA distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the democratic\r\nprinciples mutually inveigh against each other, as tending to facilitate\r\ncorruption. In aristocratic governments the individuals who are placed\r\nat the head of affairs are rich men, who are solely desirous of power.\r\nIn democracies statesmen are poor, and they have their fortunes to make.\r\nThe consequence is, that in aristocratic states the rulers are rarely\r\naccessible to corruption, and have very little craving for money; while\r\nthe reverse is the case in democratic nations.\r\n\r\nBut in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving at the head\r\nof affairs are possessed of considerable wealth, and as the number of\r\npersons by whose assistance they may rise is comparatively small, the\r\ngovernment is, if I may use the expression, put up to a sort of auction.\r\nIn democracies, on the contrary, those who are covetous of power are\r\nvery seldom wealthy, and the number of citizens who confer that power is\r\nextremely great. Perhaps in democracies the number of men who might be\r\nbought is by no means smaller, but buyers are rarely to be met with;\r\nand, besides, it would be necessary to buy so many persons at once, that\r\nthe attempt is rendered nugatory.\r\n\r\nMany of the men who have been in the administration in France during\r\nthe last forty years, have been accused of making their fortunes at\r\nthe expense of the state or of its allies; a reproach which was rarely\r\naddressed to the public characters of the ancient monarchy. But in\r\nFrance the practice of bribing electors is almost unknown, while it is\r\nnotoriously and publicly carried on in England. In the United States\r\nI never heard a man accused of spending his wealth in corrupting\r\nthe populace; but I have often heard the probity of public officers\r\nquestioned; still more frequently have I heard their success attributed\r\nto low intrigues and immoral practices.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the men who conduct the government of an aristocracy sometimes\r\nendeavor to corrupt the people, the heads of a democracy are themselves\r\ncorrupt. In the former case the morality of the people is directly\r\nassailed; in the latter, an indirect influence is exercised upon the\r\npeople, which is still more to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nAs the rulers of democratic nations are almost always exposed to\r\nthe suspicion of dishonorable conduct, they in some measure lend the\r\nauthority of the government to the base practices of which they are\r\naccused. They thus afford an example which must prove discouraging\r\nto the struggles of virtuous independence, and must foster the secret\r\ncalculations of a vicious ambition. If it be asserted that evil passions\r\nare displayed in all ranks of society; that they ascend the throne by\r\nhereditary right; and that despicable characters are to be met with\r\nat the head of aristocratic nations as well as in the sphere of a\r\ndemocracy; this objection has but little weight in my estimation. The\r\ncorruption of men who have casually risen to power has a coarse and\r\nvulgar infection in it, which renders it contagious to the multitude. On\r\nthe contrary, there is a kind of aristocratic refinement, and an air of\r\ngrandeur, in the depravity of the great, which frequently prevents it\r\nfrom spreading abroad.\r\n\r\nThe people can never penetrate the perplexing labyrinth of court\r\nintrigue, and it will always have difficulty in detecting the turpitude\r\nwhich lurks under elegant manners, refined tastes, and graceful\r\nlanguage. But to pillage the public purse, and to vend the favors of the\r\nstate, are arts which the meanest villain may comprehend, and hope to\r\npractise in his turn.\r\n\r\nIn reality it is far less prejudicial to be a witness to the immorality\r\nof the great, than to that immorality which leads to greatness. In a\r\ndemocracy, private citizens see a man of their own rank in life, who\r\nrises from that obscure position, and who becomes possessed of riches\r\nand of power in a few years: the spectacle excites their surprise and\r\ntheir envy: and they are led to inquire how the person who was yesterday\r\ntheir equal, is to-day their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents\r\nor his virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they\r\nare themselves less virtuous and less talented than he was. They are\r\ntherefore led (and not unfrequently their conjecture is a correct one)\r\nto impute his success mainly to some of his defects; and an odious\r\nmixture is thus formed of the ideas of turpitude and power, unworthiness\r\nand success, utility and dishonor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEFFORTS OF WHICH A DEMOCRACY IS CAPABLE.\r\n\r\nThe Union has only had one struggle hitherto for its\r\nExistence.--Enthusiasm at the Commencement of the War.--Indifference\r\ntoward its Close.--Difficulty of establishing a military Conscription\r\nor impressment of Seamen in America.--Why a democratic People is less\r\ncapable of sustained Effort than another.\r\n\r\nI here warn the reader that I speak of a government which implicitly\r\nfollows the real desires of the people, and not of a government which\r\nsimply commands in its name. Nothing is so irresistible as a tyrannical\r\npower commanding in the name of the people, because, while it exercises\r\nthat moral influence which belongs to the decisions of the majority, it\r\nacts at the same time with the promptitude and the tenacity of a single\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what degree of exertion a democratic government\r\nmay be capable of making, at a crisis in the history of the nation. But\r\nno great democratic republic has hitherto existed in the world. To style\r\nthe oligarchy which ruled over France in 1793, by that name, would be to\r\noffer an insult to the republican form of government. The United States\r\nafford the first example of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe American Union has now subsisted for half a century, in the course\r\nof which time its existence has only once been attacked, namely, during\r\nthe war of independence. At the commencement of that long war, various\r\noccurrences took place which betokened an extraordinary zeal for the\r\nservice of the country.[177] But as the contest was prolonged, symptoms\r\nof private egotism began to show themselves. No money was poured into\r\nthe public treasury; few recruits could be raised to join the army;\r\nthe people wished to acquire independence, but was very ill disposed to\r\nundergo the privations by which alone it could be obtained. \"Tax laws,\"\r\nsays Hamilton in the Federalist (No. 12), \"have in vain been multiplied;\r\nnew methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried; the\r\npublic expectation has been uniformly disappointed; and the treasuries\r\nof the states have remained empty. The popular system of administration\r\ninherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real\r\nscarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade,\r\nhas hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and\r\nhas at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States have not had any serious war to carry on since\r\nthat period. In order, therefore, to appreciate the sacrifices which\r\ndemocratic nations may impose upon themselves, we must wait until the\r\nAmerican people is obliged to put half its entire income at the disposal\r\nof the government, as was done by the English; or until it sends forth a\r\ntwentieth part of its population to the field of battle, as was done by\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn America the use of conscription is unknown, and men are induced to\r\nenlist by bounties. The notions and habits of the people of the United\r\nStates are so opposed to compulsory enlistments, that I do not\r\nimagine that it can ever be sanctioned by the laws. What is termed the\r\nconscription in France is assuredly the heaviest tax upon the population\r\nof that country; yet how could a great continental war be carried on\r\nwithout it? The Americans have not adopted the British impressment of\r\nseamen, and they have nothing which corresponds to the French system\r\nof maritime conscription; the navy, as well as the merchant service, is\r\nsupplied by voluntary engagement. But it is not easy to conceive how a\r\npeople can sustain a great maritime war, without having recourse to one\r\nor the other of these two systems. Indeed, the Union, which has fought\r\nwith some honor upon the seas, has never possessed a very numerous\r\nfleet, and the equipment of the small number of American vessels has\r\nalways been excessively expensive.\r\n\r\n[The remark that \"in America the use of conscription is unknown, and men\r\nare induced to enlist by bounties,\" is not exactly correct. During the\r\nlast war with Great Britain, the state of New York, in October, 1814\r\n(see the laws of that session, p. 15), passed an act to raise troops for\r\nthe defence of the state, in which the whole body of the militia were\r\ndirected to be classed, and each class to furnish one soldier, so as to\r\nmake up the whole number of 12,000 directed to be raised. In case of the\r\nrefusal of a class to furnish a man, one was to be detached from them by\r\nballot, and was compelled to procure a substitute or serve personally.\r\nThe intervention of peace rendered proceedings under the act\r\nunnecessary, and we have not, therefore, the light of experience to\r\nform an opinion whether such a plan of raising a military force is\r\npracticable. Other states passed similar laws. The system of classing\r\nwas borrowed from the practice of the revolution.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nI have heard American statesmen confess that the Union will have great\r\ndifficulty in maintaining its rank on the seas, without adopting the\r\nsystem of impressment or of maritime conscription; but the difficulty is\r\nto induce the people, which exercises the supreme authority, to submit\r\nto impressment or any compulsory system.\r\n\r\nIt is incontestable, that in times of danger a free people displays far\r\nmore energy than one which is not so. But I incline to believe, that\r\nthis is more especially the case in those free nations in which the\r\ndemocratic element preponderates. Democracy appears to me to be much\r\nbetter adapted for the peaceful conduct of society, or for an occasional\r\neffort of remarkable vigor, than for the hardy and prolonged endurance\r\nof the storms which beset the political existence of nations. The reason\r\nis very evident; it is enthusiasm which prompts men to expose themselves\r\nto dangers and privations; but they will not support them long without\r\nreflection. There is more calculation, even in the impulses of bravery,\r\nthan is generally attributed to them; and although the first efforts are\r\nsuggested by passion, perseverance is maintained by a distinct regard of\r\nthe purpose in view. A portion of what we value is exposed, in order to\r\nsave the remainder.\r\n\r\nBut it is this distinct perception of the future, founded upon a sound\r\njudgment and an enlightened experience, which is most frequently wanting\r\nin democracies. The populace is more apt to feel than to reason; and\r\nif its present sufferings are great, it is to be feared that the still\r\ngreater sufferings attendant upon defeat will be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnother cause tends to render the efforts of a democratic government\r\nless persevering than those of an aristocracy. Not only are the lower\r\nclasses less awakened than the higher orders to the good or evil chances\r\nof the future, but they are liable to suffer far more acutely from\r\npresent privations. The noble exposes his life, indeed, but the chance\r\nof glory is equal to the chance of harm. If he sacrifices a large\r\nportion of his income to the state, he deprives himself for a time of\r\nthe pleasure of affluence; but to the poor man death is embellished by\r\nno pomp or renown; and the imposts which are irksome to the rich are\r\nfatal to him.\r\n\r\nThis relative impotence of democratic republics is, perhaps, the\r\ngreatest obstacle to the foundation of a republic of this kind in\r\nEurope. In order that such a state should subsist in one country of the\r\nOld World, it would be necessary that similar institutions should be\r\nintroduced into all the other nations.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that a democratic government tends in the end to\r\nincrease the real strength of society; but it can never combine, upon a\r\nsingle point and at a given time, so much power as an aristocracy or\r\na monarchy. If a democratic country remained during a whole century\r\nsubject to a republican government, it would probably at the end of\r\nthat period be more populous and more prosperous than the neighboring\r\ndespotic states. But it would have incurred the risk of being conquered\r\nmuch oftener than they would in that lapse of years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSELF-CONTROL OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nThe American People acquiesces slowly, or frequently does not acquiesce\r\nin what is beneficial to its Interests.--The faults of the American\r\nDemocracy are for the most part reparable.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which a democracy has in conquering the passions, and\r\nin subduing the exigencies of the moment, with a view to the future, is\r\nconspicuous in the most trivial occurrences in the United States.\r\nThe people which is surrounded by flatterers, has great difficulty in\r\nsurmounting its inclinations; and whenever it is solicited to undergo a\r\nprivation or any kind of inconvenience, even to attain an end which is\r\nsanctioned by its own rational conviction, it almost always refuses to\r\ncomply at first. The deference of the Americans to the laws has been\r\nvery justly applauded; but it must be added, that in America the\r\nlegislation is made by the people and for the people. Consequently,\r\nin the United States, the law favors those classes which are most\r\ninterested in evading it elsewhere. It may therefore be supposed that an\r\noffensive law, which should not be acknowledged to be one of immediate\r\nutility, would either not be enacted or would not be obeyed.\r\n\r\nIn America there is no law against fraudulent bankruptcies; not because\r\nthey are few, but because there are a great number of bankruptcies. The\r\ndread of being prosecuted as a bankrupt acts with more intensity upon\r\nthe mind of the majority of the people, than the fear of being involved\r\nin losses or ruin by the failure of other parties; and a sort of guilty\r\ntolerance is extended by the public conscience, to an offence which\r\nevery one condemns in his individual capacity. In the new states of the\r\nsouthwest, the citizens generally take justice into their own hands,\r\nand murders are of very frequent occurrence. This arises from the rude\r\nmanners and the ignorance of the inhabitants of those deserts, who do\r\nnot perceive the utility of investing the law with adequate force, and\r\nwho prefer duels to prosecutions.\r\n\r\nSome one observed to me one day, in Philadelphia, that almost all crimes\r\nin America are caused by the abuse of intoxicating liquors, which\r\nthe lower classes can procure in great abundance from their excessive\r\ncheapness.--\"How comes it,\" said I, \"that you do not put a duty upon\r\nbrandy?\"--\"Our legislators,\" rejoined my informant, \"have frequently\r\nthought of this expedient; but the task of putting it in operation is a\r\ndifficult one: a revolt might be apprehended; and the members who\r\nshould vote for a law of this kind would be sure of losing their\r\nseats.\"--\"Whence I am to infer,\" I replied, \"that the drinking\r\npopulation constitutes the majority in your country and that temperance\r\nis somewhat unpopular.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these things are pointed out to the American statesmen, they\r\ncontent themselves with assuring you that time will operate the\r\nnecessary change, and that the experience of evil will teach the people\r\nits true interests. This is frequently true; although a democracy is\r\nmore liable to error than a monarch or a body of nobles, the chances of\r\nits regaining the right path, when once it has acknowledged its\r\nmistake, are greater also; because it is rarely embarrassed by internal\r\ninterests, which conflict with those of the majority, and resist the\r\nauthority of reason. But a democracy can only obtain truth as the result\r\nof experience; and many nations may forfeit their existence, while they\r\nare awaiting the consequences of their errors.\r\n\r\nThe great privilege of the Americans does not simply consist in their\r\nbeing more enlightened than other nations, but in their being able to\r\nrepair the faults they may commit. To which it must be added, that a\r\ndemocracy cannot derive substantial benefit from past experience, unless\r\nit be arrived at a certain pitch of knowledge and civilisation. There\r\nare tribes and peoples whose education has been so vicious, and whose\r\ncharacter presents so strange a mixture of passion, of ignorance, and of\r\nerroneous notions upon all subjects, that they are unable to discern the\r\ncause of their own wretchedness, and they fall a sacrifice to ills with\r\nwhich they are unacquainted.\r\n\r\nI have crossed vast tracts of country that were formerly inhabited by\r\npowerful Indian nations which are now extinct; I have myself passed some\r\ntime in the midst of mutilated tribes, which see the daily decline of\r\ntheir numerical strength, and of the glory of their independence; and\r\nI have heard these Indians themselves anticipate the impending doom of\r\ntheir race. Every European can perceive means which would rescue\r\nthese unfortunate beings from inevitable destruction. They alone are\r\ninsensible to the expedient; they feel the woe which year after year\r\nheaps upon their heads, but they will perish to a man without accepting\r\nthe remedy. It would be necessary to employ force to induce them to\r\nsubmit to the protection and the constraint of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe incessant revolutions which have convulsed the South American\r\nprovinces for the last quarter of a century have frequently been\r\nadverted to with astonishment, and expectations have been expressed that\r\nthose nations would speedily return to their natural state. But can\r\nit be affirmed that the turmoil of revolution is not actually the most\r\nnatural state of the South American Spaniards at the present time? In\r\nthat country society is plunged into difficulties from which all its\r\nefforts are insufficient to rescue it. The inhabitants of that fair\r\nportion of the western hemisphere seem obstinately bent on pursuing\r\nthe work of inward havoc. If they fall into a momentary repose from the\r\neffects of exhaustion, that repose prepares them for a fresh state\r\nof phrensy. When I consider their condition, which alternates between\r\nmisery and crime, I should be inclined to believe that despotism itself\r\nwould be a benefit to them, if it were possible that the words despotism\r\nand benefit could ever be united in my mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS BY THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nDirection given to the foreign Policy of the United States by\r\nWashington and Jefferson.--Almost all the defects inherent in\r\ndemocratic Institutions are brought to light in the Conduct of foreign\r\nAffairs.--Their advantages are less perceptible.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the federal constitution intrusts the permanent\r\ndirection of the external interests of the nation to the president\r\nand the senate;[178] which tends in some degree to detach the general\r\nforeign policy of the Union from the control of the people. It cannot\r\ntherefore be asserted, with truth, that the external affairs of state\r\nare conducted by the democracy. The policy of America owes its rise to\r\nWashington, and after him to Jefferson, who established those principles\r\nwhich it observes at the present day. Washington said, in the admirable\r\nletter which he addressed to his fellow-citizens, and which may be\r\nlooked upon as his political bequest to the country:--\r\n\r\n\"The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is,\r\nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little\r\n_political_ connexion as possible. So far as we have already formed\r\nengagements, let them lie fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n\"Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very\r\nremote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent controversies,\r\nthe causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence,\r\ntherefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial\r\nties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary\r\ncombinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.\r\n\r\n\"Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue\r\na different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient\r\ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury\r\nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will\r\ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously\r\nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making\r\nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation;\r\nwhen we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice,\r\nshall counsel.\r\n\r\n\"Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own\r\nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that\r\nof any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of\r\nEuropean ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\r\n\r\n\"It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any\r\nportion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty\r\nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronising\r\ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable\r\nto public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best\r\npolicy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in\r\ntheir genuine sense; but in my opinion it is unnecessary, and would be\r\nunwise, to extend them.\r\n\r\n\"Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, in\r\na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\r\nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\"\r\n\r\nIn a previous part of the same letter, Washington makes the following\r\nadmirable and just remark: \"The nation which indulges toward another an\r\nhabitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is, in some degree, a slave.\r\nIt is a slave to its animosity or its affection, either of which is\r\nsufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe political conduct of Washington was always guided by these maxims.\r\nHe succeeded in maintaining his country in a state of peace, while all\r\nthe other nations of the globe were at war; and he laid it down as a\r\nfundamental doctrine, that the true interest of the Americans consisted\r\nin a perfect neutrality with regard to the internal dissensions of the\r\nEuropean powers.\r\n\r\nJefferson went still farther, and introduced a maxim into the policy of\r\nthe Union, which affirms, that \"the Americans ought never to solicit\r\nany privileges from foreign nations, in order not to be obliged to grant\r\nsimilar privileges themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThese two principles, which were so plain and so just as to be adapted\r\nto the capacity of the populace, have greatly simplified the foreign\r\npolicy of the United States. As the Union takes no part in the affairs\r\nof Europe, it has, properly speaking, no foreign interests to discuss,\r\nsince it has at present no powerful neighbors on the American continent.\r\nThe country is as much removed from the passions of the Old World by\r\nits position, as by the line of policy which it has chosen; and it\r\nis neither called upon to repudiate nor to espouse the conflicting\r\ninterests of Europe; while the dissensions of the New World are still\r\nconcealed within the bosom of the future.\r\n\r\nThe Union is free from all pre-existing obligations; and it is\r\nconsequently enabled to profit by the experience of the old nations\r\nof Europe, without being obliged, as they are, to make the best of the\r\npast, and to adapt it to their present circumstances; or to accept\r\nthat immense inheritance which they derive from their forefathers--an\r\ninheritance of glory mingled with calamities, and of alliances\r\nconflicting with national antipathies. The foreign policy of the United\r\nStates is reduced by its very nature to await the chances of the\r\nfuture history of the nation; and for the present it consists more in\r\nabstaining from interference than in exerting its activity.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore very difficult to ascertain, at present, what degree\r\nof sagacity the American democracy will display in the conduct of the\r\nforeign policy of the country; and upon this point its adversaries, as\r\nwell as its advocates, must suspend their judgment. As for myself, I\r\nhave no hesitation in avowing my conviction, that it is most especially\r\nin the conduct of foreign relations, that democratic governments appear\r\nto me to be decidedly inferior to governments carried on upon different\r\nprinciples. Experience, instruction, and habit, may almost always\r\nsucceed in creating a species of practical discretion in democracies,\r\nand that science of the daily occurrences of life which is called good\r\nsense. Good sense may suffice to direct the ordinary course of society;\r\nand among a people whose education has been provided for, the advantages\r\nof democratic liberty in the internal affairs of the country may more\r\nthan compensate for the evils inherent in a democratic government. But\r\nsuch is not always the case in the mutual relations of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nForeign politics demand scarcely any of those qualities which a\r\ndemocracy possesses; and they require, on the contrary, the perfect use\r\nof almost all those faculties in which it is deficient. Democracy is\r\nfavorable to the increase of the internal resources of a state; it tends\r\nto diffuse a moderate independence; it promotes the growth of public\r\nspirit, and fortifies the respect which is entertained for law in all\r\nclasses of society: and these are advantages which only exercise an\r\nindirect influence over the relations which one people bears to another.\r\nBut a democracy is unable to regulate the details of an important\r\nundertaking, to persevere in a design, and to work out its execution in\r\nthe presence of serious obstacles. It cannot combine its measures with\r\nsecrecy, and will not await their consequences with patience. These\r\nare qualities which more especially belong to an individual or to an\r\naristocracy; and they are precisely the means by which an individual\r\npeople attains a predominant position.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, we observe the natural defects of aristocracy,\r\nwe shall find that their influence is comparatively innoxious in the\r\ndirection of the external affairs of a state. The capital fault of\r\nwhich aristocratic bodies may be accused, is that they are more apt to\r\ncontrive their own advantage than that of the mass of the people. In\r\nforeign politics it is rare for the interest of the aristocracy to be in\r\nany way distinct from that of the people.\r\n\r\nThe propensity which democracies have to obey the impulse of passion\r\nrather than the suggestions of prudence, and to abandon a mature design\r\nfor the gratification of a momentary caprice, was very clearly seen in\r\nAmerica on the breaking out of the French revolution. It was then as\r\nevident to the simplest capacity as it is at the present time, that the\r\ninterests of the Americans forbade them to take any part in the contest\r\nwhich was about to deluge Europe with blood, but which could by no means\r\ninjure the welfare of their own country. Nevertheless the sympathies\r\nof the people declared themselves with so much violence in behalf of\r\nFrance, that nothing but the inflexible character of Washington, and the\r\nimmense popularity which he enjoyed, could have prevented the Americans\r\nfrom declaring war against England. And even then, the exertions, which\r\nthe austere reason of that great man made to repress the generous but\r\nimprudent passions of his fellow-citizens, very nearly deprived him of\r\nthe sole recompense which he had ever claimed--that of his country's\r\nlove. The majority then reprobated the line of policy which he adopted\r\nand which has since been unanimously approved by the nation.[179]\r\n\r\nIf the constitution and the favor of the public had not intrusted the\r\ndirection of the foreign affairs of the country to Washington, it is\r\ncertain that the American nation would at that time have taken the very\r\nmeasures which it now condemns.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the nations which have exercised a powerful influence upon\r\nthe destinies of the world, by conceiving, following up, and executing\r\nvast designs--from the Romans to the English--have been governed by\r\naristocratic institutions. Nor will this be a subject of wonder when we\r\nrecollect that nothing in the world has so absolute a fixity of purpose\r\nas an aristocracy. The mass of the people may be led astray by ignorance\r\nor passion; the mind of a king may be biased, and his perseverance in\r\nhis designs may be shaken--beside which a king is not immortal; but an\r\naristocratic body is too numerous to be led astray by the blandishments\r\nof intrigue, and yet not numerous enough to yield readily to the\r\nintoxicating influence of unreflecting passion: it has the energy of\r\na firm and enlightened individual, added to the power which it derives\r\nfrom its perpetuity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[164] I here use the word _magistrates_ in the widest sense in which it\r\ncan be taken; I apply it to all the officers to whom the execution of\r\nthe laws is intrusted.\r\n\r\n[165] See the act 27th February, 1813, General Collection of the Laws of\r\nMassachusetts, vol. ii., p. 331. It should be added that the Jurors are\r\nafterward drawn from these lists by lot.\r\n\r\n[166] See the act of 28th February, 1787, General Collection of the Laws\r\nof Massachusetts, vol. i., p. 302.\r\n\r\n[167] It is needless to observe, that I speak here of the democratic\r\nform of government as applied to a people, not merely to a tribe.\r\n\r\n[168] The word _poor_ is used here, and throughout the remainder of this\r\nchapter, in a relative and not in an absolute sense. Poor men in America\r\nwould often appear rich in comparison with the poor of Europe but they\r\nmay with propriety be styled poor in comparison with their more affluent\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n[169] The easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries are\r\nplaced in the United States, result also from another cause, which\r\nis independent of the general tendencies of democracy: every kind of\r\nprivate business is very lucrative, and the state would not be served at\r\nall if it did not pay its servants. The country is in the position of\r\na commercial undertaking, which is obliged to sustain an expensive\r\ncompetition, notwithstanding its taste for economy.\r\n\r\n[170] The state of Ohio, which contains a million of inhabitants, gives\r\nits governor a salary of only $1,200 (260_l_.) a year.\r\n\r\n[171] To render this assertion perfectly evident, it will suffice to\r\nexamine the scale of salaries of the agents of the federal government.\r\nI have added the salaries attached to the corresponding officers in\r\nFrance, to complete the comparison:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      UNITED  STATES.

In France the democratic tendencies of the nation exercise\r\nan ever-increasing influence upon the government, and the chambers show\r\na disposition to raise the lowest salaries and to lower the principal\r\nones. Thus the minister of finance, who received 160,000 fr. under\r\nthe empire, receives 80,000 fr., in 1835; the directeurs-generaux of\r\nfinance, who then received 50,000 fr., now receive only 20,000 fr.\r\n\r\n[172] See the American budgets for the cost of indigent citizens and\r\ngratuitous instruction. In 1831, 50,000_l_. were spent in the state of\r\nNew York for the maintenance of the poor; and at least 200,000_l_. were\r\ndevoted to gratuitous instruction. (Williams's New York Annual Register,\r\n1832, pp. 205, 243.) The state of New York contained only 1,900,000\r\ninhabitants in the year 1830; which is not more than double the amount\r\nof population in the department du Nord in France.\r\n\r\n[173] The Americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets;\r\nthe Union, the states, the counties, and the townships, having each\r\nseverally their own. During my stay in America I made every endeavor\r\nto discover the amount of the public expenditure in the townships and\r\ncounties of the principal states of the Union, and I readily obtained\r\nthe budget of the larger townships, but I found it quite impossible to\r\nprocure that of the smaller ones. I possess, however, some documents\r\nrelating to county expenses, which, although incomplete, are still\r\ncurious. I have to thank Mr. Richards, mayor of Philadelphia, for the\r\nbudgets of thirteen of the counties of Pennsylvania, viz.: Lebanon,\r\nCentre, Franklin, Fayette, Montgomery, Luzerne, Dauphin, Butler,\r\nAllegany, Columbia, Northampton, Northumberland, and Philadelphia,\r\nfor the year 1830. Their population at that time consisted of 495,207\r\ninhabitants. On looking at the map of Pennsylvania, it will be seen\r\nthat these thirteen counties are scattered in every direction, and so\r\ngenerally affected by the causes which usually influence the condition\r\nof a country, that they may easily be supposed to furnish a correct\r\naverage of the financial state of the counties of Pennsylvania in\r\ngeneral; and thus, upon reckoning that the expenses of these counties\r\namounted in the year 1830 to about 72,330_l_., or nearly 3_s_. for each\r\ninhabitant, and calculating that each of them contributed in the same\r\nyear about 10_s_. 2_d_. toward the Union, and about 3_s_. to the state\r\nof Pennsylvania, it appears that they each contributed as their share\r\nof all the public expenses (except those of the townships), the sum of\r\n16_s_. 2_d_. This calculation is doubly incomplete, as it applies only\r\nto a single year and to one part of the public charges; but it has at\r\nleast the merit of not being conjectural.\r\n\r\n[174] Those who have attempted to draw a comparison between the expenses\r\nof France and America, have at once perceived that no such comparison\r\ncould be drawn between the total expenditures of the two countries; but\r\nthey have endeavored to contrast detached portions of this expenditure.\r\nIt may readily be shown that this second system is not at all less\r\ndefective than the first.\r\n\r\n[175] Even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every French\r\nand American citizen to the coffers of the state, we should only come at\r\na portion of the truth. Governments not only demand supplies of money,\r\nbut they call for personal services, which may be looked upon as\r\nequivalent to a given sum. When a state raises an army, beside the pay\r\nof the troops which is furnished by the entire nation, each soldier must\r\ngive up his time, the value of which depends on the use he might make\r\nof it if he were not in the service. The same remark applies to the\r\nmilitia: the citizen who is in the militia devotes a certain portion\r\nof valuable time to the maintenance of the public peace, and he does in\r\nreality surrender to the state those earnings which he is prevented from\r\ngaining. Many other instances might be cited in addition to these. The\r\ngovernments of France and America both levy taxes of this kind, which\r\nweigh upon the citizens; but who can estimate with accuracy their\r\nrelative amount in the two countries?\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us from\r\ncomparing the expenditure of the Union with that of France. The French\r\ngovernment contracts certain obligations which do not exist in America,\r\nand _vice versâ_. The French government pays the clergy; in America, the\r\nvoluntary principle prevails. In America, there is a legal provision for\r\nthe poor; in France they are abandoned to the charity of the public. The\r\nFrench public officers are paid by a fixed salary: in America they are\r\nallowed certain perquisites. In France, contributions in kind take place\r\non very few roads; in America upon almost all the thoroughfares: in\r\nthe former country the roads are free to all travellers: in the latter\r\nturnpikes abound. All these differences in manner in which contributions\r\nare levied in the two countries, enhance the difficulty of comparing\r\ntheir expenditure; for there are certain expenses which the citizens\r\nwould not be subjected to, or which would at any rate be much less\r\nconsiderable, if the state did not take upon itself to act in the name\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\n[176] See the details in the budget of the French minister of marine,\r\nand for America, the National Calendar of 1833, p. 228.\r\n\r\n[177] One of the most singular of these occurrences was the resolution\r\nwhich the Americans took of temporarily abandoning the use of tea. Those\r\nwho know that men usually cling more to their habits than to their life,\r\nwill doubtless admire this great and obscure sacrifice which was made by\r\na whole people.\r\n\r\n[178] \"The president,\" says the constitution, art. ii., sect. 2, § 2,\r\n\"shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, to\r\nmake treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur.\"\r\nThe reader is reminded that the senators are returned for a term of six\r\nyears, and that they are chosen by the legislature of each state.\r\n\r\n[179] See the fifth volume of Marshall's Life of Washington. \"In a\r\ngovernment constituted like that of the United States,\" he says, \"it is\r\nimpossible for the chief magistrate, however firm he may be, to\r\noppose for any length of time the torrents of popular opinion; and the\r\nprevalent opinion of that day seemed to incline to war. In fact, in\r\nthe session of congress held at the time, it was frequently seen that\r\nWashington had lost the majority in the house of representatives.\" The\r\nviolence of the language used against him in public was extreme, and in\r\na political meeting they did not scruple to compare him indirectly to\r\nthe treacherous Arnold. \"By the opposition,\" says Marshall, \"the friends\r\nof the administration were declared to be an aristocratic and corrupt\r\nfaction, who, from a desire to introduce monarchy, were hostile to\r\nFrance, and under the influence of Britain; that they were a paper\r\nnobility, whose extreme sensibility at every measure which threatened\r\nthe funds, induced a tame submission to injuries and insults, which the\r\ninterests and honor of the nation required them to resist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE REAL ADVANTAGES ARE WHICH AMERICAN SOCIETY DERIVES FROM THE\r\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon the subject of the present chapter, I am induced\r\nto remind the reader of what I have more than once adverted to in the\r\ncourse of this book. The political institutions of the United States\r\nappear to me to be one of the forms of government which a democracy may\r\nadopt but I do not regard the American constitution as the best, or as\r\nthe only one which a democratic people may establish. In showing the\r\nadvantages which the Americans derive from the government of democracy,\r\nI am therefore very far from meaning, or from believing, that similar\r\nadvantages can be obtained only from the same laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL TENDENCY OF THE LAWS UNDER THE RULE OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY,\r\nAND HABITS OF THOSE WHO APPLY THEM.\r\n\r\nDefects of a democratic Government easy to be discovered.--Its\r\nadvantages only to be discerned by long Observation.--Democracy\r\nin America often inexpert, but the general Tendency of the Laws\r\nadvantageous.--In the American Democracy public Officers have no\r\npermanent Interests distinct from those of the Majority.--Result of this\r\nState of Things.\r\n\r\nThe defects and the weaknesses of a democratic government may very\r\nreadily be discovered; they are demonstrated by the most flagrant\r\ninstances, while its beneficial influence is less perceptibly exercised.\r\nA single glance suffices to detect its evil consequences, but its good\r\nqualities can only be discerned by long observation. The laws of\r\nthe American democracy are frequently defective or incomplete; they\r\nsometimes attack vested rights, or give a sanction to others which are\r\ndangerous to the community; but even if they were good, the frequent\r\nchanges which they undergo would be an evil. How comes it, then, that\r\nthe American republics prosper, and maintain their position?\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of laws, a distinction must be carefully observed\r\nbetween the end at which they aim, and the means by which they are\r\ndirected to that end; between their absolute and their relative\r\nexcellence. If it be the intention of the legislator to favor the\r\ninterests of the minority at the expense of the majority, and if the\r\nmeasures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the object he has in\r\nview with the least possible expense of time and exertion, the law may\r\nbe well drawn up, although its purpose be bad; and the more efficacious\r\nit is, the greater is the mischief which it causes.\r\n\r\nDemocratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest\r\npossible number; for they emanate from a majority of the citizens, who\r\nare subject to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their\r\nown advantage. The laws of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to\r\nconcentrate wealth and power in the hands of the minority, because\r\nan aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes a minority. It may\r\ntherefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the purpose of\r\na democracy, in the conduct of its legislation, is useful to a greater\r\nnumber of citizens than that of an aristocracy. This is, however, the\r\nsum total of its advantages.\r\n\r\nAristocracies are infinitely more expert in the science of legislation\r\nthan democracies ever can be. They are possessed of a self-control which\r\nprotects them from the errors of a temporary excitement; and they form\r\nlasting designs which they mature with the assistance of favorable\r\nopportunities. Aristocratic government proceeds with the dexterity of\r\nart; it understands how to make the collective force of all its laws\r\nconverge at the same time to a given point. Such is not the case with\r\ndemocracies, whose laws are almost always ineffective, or inopportune.\r\nThe means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those of\r\naristocracy, and the measures which it unwittingly adopts are frequently\r\nopposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is more useful.\r\n\r\nLet us now imagine a community so organized by nature, or by its\r\nconstitution, that it can support the transitory action of bad laws,\r\nand it can await, without destruction, the general tendency of the\r\nlegislation: we shall then be able to conceive that a democratic\r\ngovernment, notwithstanding its defects, will be most fitted to conduce\r\nto the prosperity of this community. This is precisely what has occurred\r\nin the United States; and I repeat, what I have before remarked, that\r\nthe great advantage of the Americans consists in their being able to\r\ncommit faults which they may afterward repair.\r\n\r\nAn analogous observation may be made respecting officers. It is easy to\r\nperceive that the American democracy frequently errs in the choice of\r\nthe individuals to whom it intrusts the power of the administration; but\r\nit is more difficult to say why the state prospers under their rule. In\r\nthe first place it is to be remarked, that if in a democratic state\r\nthe governors have less honesty and less capacity than elsewhere, the\r\ngoverned on the other hand are more enlightened and more attentive\r\nto their interests. As the people in democracies is more incessantly\r\nvigilant in its affairs, and more jealous of its rights, it prevents its\r\nrepresentatives from abandoning that general line of conduct which its\r\nown interest prescribes. In the second place, it must be remembered\r\nthat if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse his power, he\r\npossesses it for a shorter period of time. But there is yet another\r\nreason which is still more general and conclusive. It is no doubt of\r\nimportance to the welfare of nations that they should be governed by men\r\nof talents and virtue; but it is perhaps still more important that\r\nthe interests of those men should not differ from the interests of the\r\ncommunity at large; for if such were the case, virtues of a high order\r\nmight become useless, and talents might be turned to a bad account.\r\n\r\nI say that it is important that the interests of the persons in\r\nauthority should not conflict with or oppose the interests of the\r\ncommunity at large; but I do not insist upon their having the same\r\ninterests as the _whole_ population, because I am not aware that such a\r\nstate of things ever existed in any country.\r\n\r\nNo political form has hitherto been discovered, which is equally\r\nfavorable to the prosperity and the development of all the classes into\r\nwhich society is divided. These classes continue to form, as it were,\r\na certain number of distinct nations in the same nation; and experience\r\nhas shown that it is no less dangerous to place the fate of these\r\nclasses exclusively in the hands of any one of them, than it is to make\r\none people the arbiter of the destiny of another. When the rich alone\r\ngovern, the interest of the poor is always endangered; and when the poor\r\nmake the laws, that of the rich incurs very serious risks. The advantage\r\nof democracy does not consist, therefore, as has been sometimes\r\nasserted, in favoring the prosperity of all, but simply in contributing\r\nto the well-being of the greatest possible number.\r\n\r\nThe men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in\r\nthe United States, are frequently inferior, both in capacity and of\r\nmorality, to those whom aristocratic institutions would raise to\r\npower. But their interest is identified and confounded with that of the\r\nmajority of their fellow-citizens. They may frequently be faithless, and\r\nfrequently mistake; but they will never systematically adopt a line of\r\nconduct opposed to the will of the majority; and it is impossible that\r\nthey should give a dangerous or an exclusive tendency to the government.\r\n\r\nThe mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated\r\nfact, which only occurs during the short period for which he is elected.\r\nCorruption and incapacity do not act as common interests, which may\r\nconnect men permanently with one another. A corrupt or an incapable\r\nmagistrate will concert his measures with another magistrate, simply\r\nbecause that individual is as corrupt and as incapable as himself; and\r\nthese two men will never unite their endeavors to promote the corruption\r\nand inaptitude of their remote posterity. The ambition and manoeuvres of\r\nthe one will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other. The vices of\r\na magistrate, in democratic states, are usually peculiar to his own\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nBut under aristocratic governments public men are swayed by the\r\ninterests of their order, which, if it is sometimes confounded with the\r\ninterests of the majority, is very frequently distinct from them. This\r\ninterest is the common and lasting bond which unites them together;\r\nit induces them to coalesce, and to combine their efforts in order to\r\nattain an end which does not always ensure the greatest happiness of\r\nthe greatest number; and it serves not only to connect the persons in\r\nauthority, but to unite them to a considerable portion of the community,\r\nsince a numerous body of citizens belongs to the aristocracy, without\r\nbeing invested with official functions. The aristocratic magistrate is\r\ntherefore constantly supported by a portion of the community, as well as\r\nby the government of which he is a member.\r\n\r\nThe common purpose which connects the interest of the magistrates\r\nin aristocracies, with that of a portion of their contemporaries,\r\nidentifies it with that of future generations; their influence belongs\r\nto the future as much as to the present. The aristocratic magistrate\r\nis urged at the same time toward the same point, by the passions of the\r\ncommunity, by his own, and I may almost add, by those of his posterity.\r\nIs it, then, wonderful that he does not resist such repeated impulses?\r\nAnd, indeed, aristocracies are often carried away by the spirit of their\r\norder without being corrupted by it; and they unconsciously fashion\r\nsociety to their own ends, and prepare it for their own descendants.\r\n\r\nThe English aristocracy is perhaps the most liberal which ever existed,\r\nand no body of men has ever, uninterruptedly, furnished so many\r\nhonorable and enlightened individuals to the government of a country. It\r\ncannot, however, escape observation, that in the legislation of England\r\nthe good of the poor has been sacrificed to the advantage of the\r\nrich, and the rights of the majority to the privileges of the few. The\r\nconsequence is that England, at the present day, combines the extremes\r\nof fortune in the bosom of her society; and her perils and calamities\r\nare almost equal to her power and her renown.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, where the public officers have no interests to\r\npromote connected with their caste, the general and constant influence\r\nof the government is beneficial, although the individuals who conduct it\r\nare frequently unskilful and sometimes contemptible. There is, indeed,\r\na secret tendency in democratic institutions to render the exertions\r\nof the citizens subservient to the prosperity of the community,\r\nnotwithstanding their private vices and mistakes; while in aristocratic\r\ninstitutions there is a secret propensity, which, notwithstanding the\r\ntalents and the virtues of those who conduct the government, leads them\r\nto contribute to the evils which oppress their fellow creatures. In\r\naristocratic governments public men may frequently do injuries which\r\nthey do not intend; and in democratic states they produce advantages\r\nwhich they never thought of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SPIRIT IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nPatriotism of Instinct.--Patriotism of Reflection.--Their different\r\nCharacteristics.--Nations ought to strive to acquire the second when\r\nthe first has disappeared.--Efforts of the Americans to acquire\r\nit.--Interest of the Individual intimately connected with that of the\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nThere is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally arises from\r\nthat instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable feeling which connects\r\nthe affections of man with his birthplace. This natural fondness is\r\nunited to a taste for ancient customs, and to a reverence for ancestral\r\ntraditions of the past; those who cherish it love their country as they\r\nlove the mansion of their fathers. They enjoy the tranquillity which\r\nit affords them; they cling to the peaceful habits which they have\r\ncontracted within its bosom; they are attached to the reminiscences\r\nwhich it awakens, and they are even pleased by the state of obedience\r\nin which they are placed. This patriotism is sometimes stimulated\r\nby religious enthusiasm, and then it is capable of making the most\r\nprodigious efforts. It is in itself a kind of religion; it does not\r\nreason, but it acts from the impulse of faith and of sentiment. By\r\nsome nations the monarch has been regarded as a personification of the\r\ncountry; and the fervor of patriotism being converted into the fervor of\r\nloyalty, they took a sympathetic pride in his conquests, and gloried in\r\nhis power. At one time, under the ancient monarchy, the French felt a\r\nsort of satisfaction in the sense of their dependence upon the arbitrary\r\npleasure of their king, and they were wont to say with pride: \"We are\r\nthe subjects of the most powerful king in the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut, like all instinctive passions, this kind of patriotism is more apt\r\nto prompt transient exertion than to supply the motives of continuous\r\nendeavor. It may save the state in critical circumstances, but it will\r\nnot unfrequently allow the nation to decline in the midst of peace.\r\nWhile the manners of a people are simple, and its faith unshaken,\r\nwhile society is steadily based upon traditional institutions, whose\r\nlegitimacy has never been contested, this instinctive patriotism is wont\r\nto endure.\r\n\r\nBut there is another species of attachment to a country which is more\r\nrational than the one we have been describing. It is perhaps less\r\ngenerous and less ardent, but it is more fruitful and more lasting; it\r\nis coeval with the spread of knowledge, it is nurtured by the laws, it\r\ngrows by the exercise of civil rights, and in the end, it is confounded\r\nwith the personal interest of the citizen. A man comprehends the\r\ninfluence which the prosperity of his country has upon his own welfare;\r\nhe is aware that the laws authorize him to contribute his assistance\r\nto that prosperity, and he labors to promote it as a portion of his\r\ninterest in the first place, and as a portion of his right in the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nBut epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation,\r\nat which the ancient customs of a people are changed, public morality\r\ndestroyed, religious belief disturbed, and the spell of tradition\r\nbroken, while the diffusion of knowledge is yet imperfect, and the civil\r\nrights of the community are ill secured, or confined within very narrow\r\nlimits. The country then assumes a dim and dubious shape in the eyes of\r\nthe citizens; they no longer behold it in the soil which they inhabit,\r\nfor that soil is to them a dull inanimate clod; nor in the usages\r\nof their forefathers, which they have been taught to look upon as a\r\ndebasing yoke; nor in religion, for of that they doubt; nor in the laws,\r\nwhich do not originate in their own authority; nor in the legislator,\r\nwhom they fear and despise. The country is lost to their senses, they\r\ncan neither discover it under its own, nor under borrowed features, and\r\nthey intrench themselves within the dull precincts of a narrow egotism.\r\nThey are emancipated from prejudice, without having acknowledged\r\nthe empire of reason; they are animated neither by the instinctive\r\npatriotism of monarchical subjects, nor by the thinking patriotism of\r\nrepublican citizens; but they have stopped half-way between the two, in\r\nthe midst of confusion and of distress.\r\n\r\nIn this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people cannot\r\nrestore the vivacity of its earlier times, any more than a man can\r\nreturn to the innocence and the bloom of childhood; such things may\r\nbe regretted, but they cannot be renewed. The only thing, then, which\r\nremains to be done, is to proceed, and to accelerate the union of\r\nprivate with public interests, since the period of disinterested\r\npatriotism is gone by for ever.\r\n\r\nI am certainly very far from averring, that, in order to obtain this\r\nresult, the exercise of political rights should be immediately granted\r\nto all the members of the community. But I maintain that the most\r\npowerful, and perhaps the only means of interesting men in the welfare\r\nof their country, which we still possess, is to make them partakers\r\nin the government. At the present time civic zeal seems to me to be\r\ninseparable from the exercise of political rights; and I hold that the\r\nnumber of citizens will be found to augment or decrease in Europe in\r\nproportion as those rights are extended.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon\r\nthe soil which they now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor\r\ntraditions with them there; they meet each other for the first time\r\nwith no previous acquaintance; in short, the instinctive love of their\r\ncountry can scarcely exist in their minds; but every one takes as\r\nzealous an interest in the affairs of his township, his country, and\r\nof the whole state, as if they were his own, because every one, in his\r\nsphere, takes an active part in the government of society.\r\n\r\nThe lower orders in the United States are alive to the perception of the\r\ninfluence exercised by the general prosperity upon their own welfare;\r\nand simple as this observation is, it is one which is but too rarely\r\nmade by the people. But in America the people regard this prosperity as\r\nthe result of its own exertions; the citizen looks upon the fortune of\r\nthe public as his private interest, and he co-operates in its success,\r\nnot so much from a sense of pride or of duty, as from what I shall\r\nventure to term cupidity.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history of the\r\nAmericans in order to discover the truth of this remark, for their\r\nmanners render it sufficiently evident. As the American participates\r\nin all that is done in his country, he thinks himself obliged to defend\r\nwhatever may be censured; for it is not only his country which is\r\nattacked upon these occasions, but it is himself. The consequence is\r\nthat his national pride resorts to a thousand artifices, and to all the\r\npetty tricks of individual vanity.\r\n\r\nNothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life than\r\nthis irritable patriotism of the Americans. A stranger may be well\r\ninclined to praise many of the institutions of their country, but he\r\nbegs permission to blame some of the peculiarities which he observes--a\r\npermission which is however inexorably refused. America is therefore a\r\nfree country, in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you\r\nare not allowed to speak freely of private individuals or of the\r\nstate; of the citizens or of the authorities; of public or of private\r\nundertakings; or, in short, of anything at all, except it be of the\r\nclimate and the soil; and even then Americans will be found ready to\r\ndefend either the one or the other, as if they had been contrived by the\r\ninhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\nIn our times, option must be made between the patriotism of all and the\r\ngovernment of a few; for the force and activity which the first confers,\r\nare irreconcilable with the guarantees of tranquillity which the second\r\nfurnishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTION OF RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nNo great People without a Notion of Rights.--How the Notion of\r\nRights can be given to a People.--Respect of Rights in the United\r\nStates.--Whence it arises.\r\n\r\nAfter the idea of virtue, I am acquainted with no higher principle\r\nthan that of right; or, to speak more accurately, these two ideas are\r\ncommingled in one. The idea of right is simply that of virtue introduced\r\ninto the political world. It is the idea of right which enabled men to\r\ndefine anarchy and tyranny; and which taught them to remain independent\r\nwithout arrogance, as well as to obey without servility. The man who\r\nsubmits to violence is debased by his compliance; but when he obeys\r\nthe mandate of one who possesses that right of authority which he\r\nacknowledges in a fellow creature, he rises in some measure above the\r\nperson who delivers the command. There are no great men without virtue,\r\nand there are no great nations--it may also be added that there would be\r\nno society--without the notion of rights; for what is the condition of a\r\nmass of rational and intelligent beings who are only united together by\r\nthe bond of force?\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the present time\r\nof inculcating the notion of rights, and of rendering it, as it were,\r\npalpable to the senses, is to invest all the members of the community\r\nwith the peaceful exercise of certain rights: this is very clearly seen\r\nin children, who are men without the strength and the experience of\r\nmanhood. When a child begins to move in the midst of the objects which\r\nsurround him, he is instinctively led to turn everything which he can\r\nlay his hands upon to his own purpose; he has no notion of the property\r\nof others; but as he gradually learns the value of things, and begins\r\nto perceive that he may in his turn be deprived of his possessions, he\r\nbecomes more circumspect, and he observes those rights in others which\r\nhe wishes to have respected in himself. The principle which the child\r\nderives from the possession of his toys, is taught to the man by the\r\nobjects which he may call his own. In America those complaints against\r\nproperty in general, which are so frequent in Europe, are never heard,\r\nbecause in America there are no paupers; and as every one has property\r\nof his own to defend, every one recognizes the principle upon which he\r\nholds it.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs in the political world. In America the lowest\r\nclasses have conceived a very high notion of political rights, because\r\nthey exercise those rights; and they refrain from attacking those of\r\nother people, in order to ensure their own from attack. While in Europe\r\nthe same classes sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme power,\r\nthe American submits without a murmur to the authority of the pettiest\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nThis truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of national\r\npeculiarities. In France very few pleasures are exclusively reserved\r\nfor the higher classes; the poor are admitted wherever the rich are\r\nreceived; and they consequently behave with propriety, and respect\r\nwhatever contributes to the enjoyments in which they themselves\r\nparticipate. In England, where wealth has a monopoly of amusement as\r\nwell as of power, complaints are made that whenever the poor happen to\r\nsteal into the enclosures which are reserved for the pleasures of the\r\nrich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can this be wondered at,\r\nsince care has been taken that they should have nothing to lose?\r\n\r\nThe government of the democracy brings the notion of political rights to\r\nthe level of the humblest citizens, just as the dissemination of wealth\r\nbrings the notion of property within the reach of all the members of the\r\ncommunity; and I confess that, to my mind, this is one of its greatest\r\nadvantages. I do not assert that it is easy to teach men to exercise\r\npolitical rights; but I maintain that when it is possible, the effects\r\nwhich result from it are highly important: and I add that if there ever\r\nwas a time at which such an attempt ought to be made, that time is our\r\nown. It is clear that the influence of religious belief is shaken, and\r\nthat the notion of divine rights is declining; it is evident that\r\npublic morality is vitiated, and the notion of moral rights is also\r\ndisappearing: these are general symptoms of the substitution of argument\r\nfor faith, and of calculation for the impulses of sentiment. If, in the\r\nmidst of this general disruption, you do not succeed in connecting\r\nthe notion of rights with that of personal interest, which is the\r\nonly immutable point in the human heart, what means will you have of\r\ngoverning the world except by fear? When I am told that since the laws\r\nare weak and the populace is wild, since passions are excited and the\r\nauthority of virtue is paralyzed, no measures must be taken to increase\r\nthe rights of the democracy; I reply that it is for these very reasons\r\nthat some measures of the kind must be taken; and I am persuaded that\r\ngovernments are still more interested in taking them than society at\r\nlarge, because governments are liable to be destroyed, and society\r\ncannot perish.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the example which America\r\nfurnishes. In those states the people was invested with political rights\r\nat a time when they could scarcely be abused, for the citizens were\r\nfew in number and simple in their manners. As they have increased, the\r\nAmericans have not augmented the power of the democracy, but they have,\r\nif I may use the expression, extended its dominions.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the moment at which political rights are\r\ngranted to a people that had before been without them, is a very\r\ncritical, though it be a very necessary one. A child may kill before he\r\nis aware of the value of life; and he may deprive another person of his\r\nproperty before he is aware that his own may be taken away from him. The\r\nlower orders, when first they are invested with political rights, stand\r\nin relation to those rights, in the same position as a child does to the\r\nwhole of nature, and the celebrated adage may then be applied to them,\r\n_Homo, puer robustus_. This truth may even be perceived in America. The\r\nstates in which the citizens have enjoyed their rights longest are those\r\nin which they make the best use of them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in\r\nprodigies than the art of being free; but there is nothing more arduous\r\nthan the apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not the case with despotic\r\ninstitutions; despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand\r\nprevious ills; it supports the right, it protects the oppressed, and it\r\nmaintains public order. The nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity\r\nwhich accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense of its own misery.\r\nLiberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the midst of\r\nagitation, it is perfected by civil discord, and its benefits cannot be\r\nappreciated until it is already old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRESPECT FOR THE LAW IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nRespect of the Americans for the Law.--Parental Affection which they\r\nentertain for it.--Personal Interest of every one to increase the\r\nAuthority of the Law.\r\n\r\nIt is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either directly\r\nor indirectly, in the formation of the law; but it cannot be denied that\r\nwhen such a measure is possible, the authority of the law is very much\r\naugmented. This popular origin, which impairs the excellence and the\r\nwisdom of legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase its power.\r\nThere is an amazing strength in the expression of the determination of a\r\nwhole people; and when it declares itself, the imagination of those who\r\nare most inclined to contest it, is overawed by its authority. The truth\r\nof this fact is very well known by parties; and they consequently strive\r\nto make out a majority whenever they can. If they have not the greater\r\nnumber of voters on their side, they assert that the true majority\r\nabstained from voting; and if they are foiled even there, they have\r\nrecourse to the body of those persons who had no votes to give.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, except slaves, servants, and paupers in the\r\nreceipt of relief from the townships, there is no class of persons\r\nwho do not exercise the elective franchise, and who do not contribute\r\nindirectly to make the laws. Those who design to attack the laws must\r\nconsequently either modify the opinion of the nation or trample upon its\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nA second reason, which is still more weighty, may be farther adduced:\r\nin the United States every one is personally interested in enforcing\r\nthe obedience of the whole community to the law; for as the minority\r\nmay shortly rally the majority to its principles, it is interested in\r\nprofessing that respect for the decrees of the legislator, which it may\r\nsoon have occasion to claim for its own. However irksome an enactment\r\nmay be, the citizen of the United States complies with it, not only\r\nbecause it is the work of the majority, but because it originates in his\r\nown authority; and he regards it as a contract to which he is himself a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does\r\nnot exist, which always looks upon the law as its natural enemy, and\r\naccordingly surveys it with fear and with distrust. It is impossible,\r\non the other hand, not to perceive that all classes display the utmost\r\nreliance upon the legislation of their country, and that they are\r\nattached to it by a kind of parental affection.\r\n\r\nI am wrong, however, in saying all classes; for as in America the\r\nEuropean scale of authority is inverted, the wealthy are there placed in\r\na position analogous to that of the poor in the Old World, and it is\r\nthe opulent classes which frequently look upon the law with suspicion.\r\nI have already observed that the advantage of democracy is not, as has\r\nbeen sometimes asserted, that it protects the interests of the whole\r\ncommunity, but simply that it protects those of the majority. In the\r\nUnited States, where the poor rule, the rich have always some reason to\r\ndread the abuses of their power. This natural anxiety of the rich may\r\nproduce a sullen dissatisfaction, but society is not disturbed by it;\r\nfor the same reason which induces the rich to withhold their confidence\r\nin the legislative authority, makes them obey its mandates; their\r\nwealth, which prevents them from making the law, prevents them from\r\nwithstanding it. Among civilized nations revolts are rarely excited\r\nexcept by such persons as have nothing to lose by them; and if the laws\r\nof a democracy are not always worthy of respect, at least they always\r\nobtain it; for those who usually infringe the laws have no excuse for\r\nnot complying with the enactments they have themselves made, and by\r\nwhich they are themselves benefited, while the citizens whose interests\r\nmight be promoted by the infraction of them, are induced, by their\r\ncharacter and their station, to submit to the decisions of the\r\nlegislature, whatever they may be. Beside which, the people in America\r\nobeys the law not only because it emanates from the popular authority,\r\nbut because that authority may modify it in any points which may prove\r\nvexatory; a law is observed because it is a self-imposed evil in the\r\nfirst place, and an evil of transient duration in the second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACTIVITY WHICH PERVADES ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE BODY POLITIC IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES; INFLUENCE WHICH IT EXERCISES UPON SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nMore difficult to conceive the political Activity which pervades the\r\nUnited States than the Freedom and Equality which reign here.--The great\r\nactivity which perpetually agitates the legislative Bodies is only an\r\nEpisode to the general Activity.--Difficult for an American to confine\r\nhimself to his own Business.--Political Agitation extends to all social\r\nintercourse.--Commercial Activity of the Americans partly attributable\r\nto this cause.--Indirect Advantages which Society derives from a\r\ndemocratic Government.\r\n\r\nOn passing from a country in which free institutions are established to\r\none where they do not exist, the traveller is struck by the change; in\r\nthe former all is bustle and activity, in the latter everything is calm\r\nand motionless. In the one, melioration and progress are the general\r\ntopics of inquiry; in the other, it seems as if the community only\r\naspired to repose in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has\r\nacquired. Nevertheless, the country which exerts itself so strenuously\r\nto promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more prosperous\r\nthan that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we\r\ncompare them together, we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants\r\nare daily felt in the former, while so few seem to occur in the latter.\r\n\r\nIf this remark is applicable to those free countries in which\r\nmonarchical and aristocratic institutions subsist, it is still more\r\nstriking with regard to democratic republics. In these states it is not\r\nonly a portion of the people which is busied with the melioration of its\r\nsocial condition, but the whole community is engaged in the task; and it\r\nis not the exigencies and the convenience of a single class for which a\r\nprovision is to be made, but the exigencies and the convenience of all\r\nranks of life.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to conceive the surpassing liberty which the\r\nAmericans enjoy; some idea may likewise be formed of the extreme\r\nequality which subsists among them; but the political activity which\r\npervades the United States must be seen in order to be understood. No\r\nsooner do you set foot upon the American soil than you are stunned by a\r\nkind of tumult; a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a thousand\r\nsimultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfaction of their social\r\nwants. Everything is in motion around you; here, the people of one\r\nquarter of a town are met to decide upon the building of a church;\r\nthere, the election of a representative is going on; a little further,\r\nthe delegates of a district are posting to the town in order to consult\r\nupon some local improvements; or, in another place, the laborers of a\r\nvillage quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or\r\na public school. Meetings are called for the sole purpose of declaring\r\ntheir disapprobation of the line of conduct pursued by the government;\r\nwhile in other assemblies the citizens salute the authorities of the\r\nday as the fathers of their country. Societies are formed, which regard\r\ndrunkenness as the principal cause of the evils under which the state\r\nlabors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a constant example of\r\ntemperance.[180]\r\n\r\nThe great political agitation of the American legislative bodies, which\r\nis the only kind of excitement that attracts the attention of foreign\r\ncountries, is a mere episode or a sort of continuation of that universal\r\nmovement which originates in the lowest classes of the people and\r\nextends successively to all the ranks of society. It is impossible to\r\nspend more efforts in the pursuit of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the\r\noccupation of a citizen in the United States; and almost the only\r\npleasure of which an American has any idea, is to take a part in the\r\ngovernment, and to discuss the part he has taken. This feeling pervades\r\nthe most trifling habits of life; even the women frequently attend\r\npublic meetings, and listen to political harangues as a recreation\r\nafter their household labors. Debating clubs are to a certain extent a\r\nsubstitute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot converse,\r\nbut he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he falls into a\r\ndissertation. He speaks to you as if he were addressing a meeting; and\r\nif he should warm in the course of the discussion, he will infallibly\r\nsay \"gentlemen,\" to the person with whom he is conversing.\r\n\r\nIn some countries the inhabitants display a certain repugnance to avail\r\nthemselves of the political privileges with which the law invests them;\r\nit would seem that they set too high a value upon their time to spend\r\nit on the interests of the community; and they prefer to withdraw within\r\nthe exact limits of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences\r\nand a quickset hedge. But if an American were condemned to confine\r\nhis activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of\r\nhis existence; he would feel an immense void in the life which he is\r\naccustomed to lead, and his wretchedness would be unbearable.[181] I am\r\npersuaded that if ever a despotic government is established in America,\r\nit will find it more difficult to surmount the habits which free\r\ninstitutions have engendered, than to conquer the attachment of the\r\ncitizens to freedom.\r\n\r\nThis ceaseless agitation which democratic government has introduced into\r\nthe political world, influences all social intercourse. I am not sure\r\nthat upon the whole this is not the greatest advantage of democracy; and\r\nI am much less inclined to applaud it for what it does, than for what it\r\ncauses to be done.\r\n\r\nIt is incontestable that the people frequently conducts public business\r\nvery ill; but it is impossible that the lower orders should take a part\r\nin public business without extending the circle of their ideas, and\r\nwithout quitting the ordinary routine of their mental acquirements. The\r\nhumblest individual who is called upon to co-operate in the government\r\nof society, acquires a certain degree of self-respect; and as he\r\npossesses authority, he can command the services of minds much more\r\nenlightened than his own. He is canvassed by a multitude of applicants,\r\nwho seek to deceive him in a thousand different ways, but who instruct\r\nhim by their deceit. He takes a part in political undertakings which\r\ndid not originate in his own conception, but which give him a taste for\r\nundertakings of the kind. New meliorations are daily pointed out in the\r\nproperty which he holds in common with others, and this gives him the\r\ndesire of improving that property which is more peculiarly his own. He\r\nis perhaps neither happier nor better than those who came before him,\r\nbut he is better informed and more active. I have no doubt that the\r\ndemocratic institutions of the United States, joined to the physical\r\nconstitution of the country, are the cause (not the direct, as is so\r\noften asserted, but the indirect cause) of the prodigious commercial\r\nactivity of the inhabitants. It is not engendered by the laws, but\r\nthe people learns how to promote it by the experience derived from\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWhen the opponents of democracy assert that a single individual performs\r\nthe duties which he undertakes much better than the government of\r\nthe community, it appears to me that they are perfectly right. The\r\ngovernment of an individual, supposing an equality of instruction on\r\neither side, is more consistent, more persevering, and more accurate\r\nthan that of a multitude, and it is much better qualified judiciously\r\nto discriminate the characters of the men it employs. If any deny what I\r\nadvance, they have certainly never seen a democratic government, or have\r\nformed their opinion upon very partial evidence. It is true that\r\neven when local circumstances and the disposition of the people allow\r\ndemocratic institutions to subsist, they never display a regular\r\nand methodical system of government. Democratic liberty is far from\r\naccomplishing all the projects it undertakes, with the skill of an\r\nadroit despotism. It frequently abandons them before they have borne\r\ntheir fruits, or risks them when the consequences may prove dangerous;\r\nbut in the end it produces more than any absolute government, and if it\r\ndo fewer things well, it does a great number of things. Under its\r\nsway, the transactions of the public administration are not nearly so\r\nimportant as what is done by private exertion. Democracy does not confer\r\nthe most skilful kind of government upon the people, but it produces\r\nthat which the most skilful governments are frequently unable to awaken,\r\nnamely, an all-pervading and restless activity, a superabundant force,\r\nand an energy which is inseparable from it, and which may, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, beget the most amazing benefits. These are the\r\ntrue advantages of democracy.\r\n\r\nIn the present age, when the destinies of Christendom seem to be in\r\nsuspense, some hasten to assail democracy as its foe while it is yet in\r\nits early growth; and others are ready with their vows of adoration for\r\nthis new duty which is springing forth from chaos: but both parties are\r\nvery imperfectly acquainted with the object of their hatred or of their\r\ndesires; they strike in the dark, and distribute their blows by mere\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nWe must first understand what the purport of society and the aim of\r\ngovernment are held to be. If it be your intention to confer a certain\r\nelevation upon the human mind, and to teach it to regard the things of\r\nthis world with generous feelings; to inspire men with a scorn of mere\r\ntemporal advantage; to give birth to living convictions, and to keep\r\nalive the spirit of honorable devotedness; if you hold it to be a good\r\nthing to refine the habits, to embellish the manners, to cultivate the\r\narts of a nation, and to promote the love of poetry, of beauty, and of\r\nrenown; if you would constitute a people not unfitted to act with power\r\nupon all other nations; nor unprepared for those high enterprises,\r\nwhich, whatever be the result of its efforts, will leave a name for\r\never famous in time--if you believe such to be the principal object of\r\nsociety, you must avoid the government of democracy, which would be a\r\nvery uncertain guide to the end you have in view.\r\n\r\nBut if you hold it to be expedient to divert the moral and intellectual\r\nactivity of man to the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of\r\nthe necessaries of life; if a clear understanding be more profitable\r\nto men than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of\r\nheroism, but to create habits of peace; if you had rather behold vices\r\nthan crimes, and are content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided\r\noffences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living\r\nin the midst of a brilliant state of society, you are contented to\r\nhave prosperity around you; if, in short, you are of opinion that the\r\nprincipal object of a government is not to confer the greatest possible\r\nshare of power and of glory upon the body of the nation, but to ensure\r\nthe greatest degree of enjoyment, and the least degree of misery, to\r\neach of the individuals who compose it--if such be your desires, you can\r\nhave no surer means of satisfying them than by equalizing the condition\r\nof men, and establishing democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nBut if the time be past at which such a choice was possible, and if\r\nsome superhuman power impel us toward one or the other of these two\r\ngovernments without consulting our wishes, let us at least endeavor to\r\nmake the best of that which is allotted to us: and let us so inquire\r\ninto its good and its evil propensities as to be able to foster the\r\nformer, and repress the latter to the utmost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[180] At the time of my stay in the United States the temperance\r\nsocieties already consisted of more than 270,000 members; and their\r\neffect had been to diminish the consumption of fermented liquors by\r\n500,000 gallons per annum in the state of Pennsylvania alone.\r\n\r\n[181] The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars.\r\nMontesquieu somewhere alludes to the excessive despondency of certain\r\nRoman citizens who, after the excitement of political life, were all at\r\nonce flung back into the stagnation of private life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nUNLIMITED POWER OF THE MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS\r\nCONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\nNatural Strength of the Majority in Democracies.--Most of the American\r\nConstitutions have increased this Strength by artificial Means.--How\r\nthis has been done.--Pledged Delegates.--Moral Power of the\r\nMajority.--Opinions as to its Infallibility.--Respect for its Rights,\r\nhow augmented in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute\r\nsovereignty of the majority: for there is nothing in democratic states\r\nwhich is capable of resisting it. Most of the American constitutions\r\nhave sought to increase this natural strength of the majority by\r\nartificial means.[182]\r\n\r\nThe legislature is, of all political institutions, the one which is most\r\neasily swayed by the wishes of the majority. The Americans determined\r\nthat the members of the legislature should be elected by the people\r\nimmediately, and for a very brief term, in order to subject them not\r\nonly to the general convictions, but even to the daily passions of their\r\nconstituents. The members of both houses are taken from the same\r\nclass in society, and are nominated in the same manner; so that the\r\nmodifications of the legislative bodies are almost as rapid and quite as\r\nirresistible as those of a single assembly. It is to a legislature thus\r\nconstituted, that almost all the authority of the government has been\r\nintrusted.\r\n\r\nBut while the law increased the strength of those authorities which\r\nof themselves were strong, it enfeebled more and more those which were\r\nnaturally weak. It deprived the representatives of the executive of all\r\nstability and independence; and by subjecting them completely to the\r\ncaprices of the legislature, it robbed them completely of the slender\r\ninfluence which the nature of a democratic government might have allowed\r\nthem to retain. In several states the judicial power was also submitted\r\nto the elective discretion of the majority; and in all of them its\r\nexistence was made to depend on the pleasure of the legislative\r\nauthority, since the representatives were empowered annually to regulate\r\nthe stipend of the judges.\r\n\r\nCustom, however, has done even more than law. A proceeding which will in\r\nthe end set all the guarantees of representative government at naught,\r\nis becoming more and more general in the United States: it frequently\r\nhappens that the electors, who choose a delegate, point out a certain\r\nline of conduct to him, and impose upon him a certain number of positive\r\nobligations which he is pledged to fulfil. With the exception of the\r\ntumult, this comes to the same thing as if the majority of the populace\r\nheld its deliberations in the market-place.\r\n\r\nSeveral other circumstances concur in rendering the power of the\r\nmajority in America, not only preponderant, but irresistible. The moral\r\nauthority of the majority is partly based upon the notion, that there\r\nis more intelligence and more wisdom in a great number of men collected\r\ntogether than in a single individual, and that the quantity of\r\nlegislators is more important than their quality. The theory of equality\r\nis in fact applied to the intellect of man; and human pride is thus\r\nassailed in its last retreat, by a doctrine which the minority hesitate\r\nto admit, and in which they very slowly concur. Like all other powers,\r\nand perhaps more than all other powers, the authority of the many\r\nrequires the sanction of time; at first it enforces obedience by\r\nconstraint; but its laws are not respected until they have long been\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe right of governing society, which the majority supposes itself to\r\nderive from its superior intelligence, was introduced into the United\r\nStates by the first settlers; and this idea, which would be sufficient\r\nof itself to create a free nation, has now been amalgamated with the\r\nmanners of the people, and the minor incidents of social intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim (which is still\r\na fundamental principle of the English constitution), that the king\r\ncould do no wrong; and if he did wrong, the blame was imputed to his\r\nadvisers. This notion was highly favorable to habits of obedience; and\r\nit enabled the subject to complain of the law, without ceasing to love\r\nand honor the lawgiver. The Americans entertain the same opinion with\r\nrespect to the majority.\r\n\r\nThe moral power of the majority is founded upon yet another principle,\r\nwhich is, that the interests of the many are to be preferred to those\r\nof the few. It will readily be perceived that the respect here professed\r\nfor the rights of the majority must naturally increase or diminish\r\naccording to the state of parties. When a nation is divided into\r\nseveral irreconcilable factions, the privilege of the majority is often\r\noverlooked, because it is intolerable to comply with its demands.\r\n\r\nIf there existed in America a class of citizens whom the legislating\r\nmajority sought to deprive of exclusive privileges, which they had\r\npossessed for ages, and to bring down from an elevated station to the\r\nlevel of the ranks of the multitude, it is probable that the minority\r\nwould be less ready to comply with its laws. But as the United States\r\nwere colonized by men holding an equal rank among themselves, there\r\nis as yet no natural or permanent source of dissension between the\r\ninterests of its different inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere are certain communities in which the persons who constitute the\r\nminority can never hope to draw over the majority to their side, because\r\nthey must then give up the very point which is at issue between them.\r\nThus, an aristocracy can never become a majority while it retains its\r\nexclusive privileges, and it cannot cede its privileges without ceasing\r\nto be an aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, political questions cannot be taken up in so\r\ngeneral and absolute a manner; and all parties are willing to recognize\r\nthe rights of the majority, because they all hope to turn those rights\r\nto their own advantage at some future time. The majority therefore\r\nin that country exercises a prodigious actual authority, and a moral\r\ninfluence which is scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles exist which\r\ncan impede, or so much as retard its progress, or which can induce it to\r\nheed the complaints of those whom it crushes upon its path. This state\r\nof things is fatal in itself and dangerous for the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW THE UNLIMITED POWER OF THE MAJORITY INCREASES, IN AMERICA, THE\r\nINSTABILITY OF LEGISLATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION INHERENT IN DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nThe Americans increase the mutability of the Laws which is inherent in\r\nDemocracy by changing the Legislature every Year, and by vesting it\r\nwith unbounded Authority.--The same Effect is produced upon the\r\nAdministration.--In America social Melioration is conducted more\r\nenergetically, but less perseveringly than in Europe.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the natural defects of democratic institutions,\r\nand they all of them increase in the exact ratio of the power of the\r\nmajority. To begin with the most evident of them all; the mutability\r\nof the laws is an evil inherent in democratic government, because it is\r\nnatural to democracies to raise men to power in very rapid succession.\r\nBut this evil is more or less sensible in proportion to the authority\r\nand the means of action which the legislature possesses.\r\n\r\nIn America the authority exercised by the legislative bodies is supreme;\r\nnothing prevents them from accomplishing their wishes with celerity, and\r\nwith irresistible power, while they are supplied by new representatives\r\nevery year. That is to say, the circumstances which contribute most\r\npowerfully to democratic instability, and which admit of the free\r\napplication of caprice to every object in the state, are here in full\r\noperation. In conformity with this principle, America is, at the present\r\nday, the country in the world where laws last the shortest time. Almost\r\nall the American constitutions have been amended within the course of\r\nthirty years: there is, therefore, not a single American state which has\r\nnot modified the principles of its legislation in that lapse of time.\r\nAs for the laws themselves, a single glance upon the archives of the\r\ndifferent states of the Union suffices to convince one, that in America\r\nthe activity of the legislator never slackens. Not that the American\r\ndemocracy is naturally less stable than any other, but that it is\r\nallowed to follow its capricious propensities in the formation of the\r\nlaws.[183]\r\n\r\nThe omnipotence of the majority and the rapid as well as absolute manner\r\nin which its decisions are executed in the United States, have not only\r\nthe effect of rendering the law unstable, but they exercise the same\r\ninfluence upon the execution of the law and the conduct of the public\r\nadministration. As the majority is the only power which it is important\r\nto court, all its projects are taken up with the greatest ardor; but no\r\nsooner is its attention distracted, than all this ardor ceases; while in\r\nthe free states of Europe, the administration is at once independent and\r\nsecure, so that the projects of the legislature are put into execution,\r\nalthough its immediate attention may be directed to other objects.\r\n\r\nIn America certain meliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and\r\nactivity than elsewhere; in Europe the same ends are promoted by much\r\nless social effort, more continuously applied.\r\n\r\nSome years ago several pious individuals undertook to meliorate the\r\ncondition of the prisons. The public was excited by the statements\r\nwhich they put forward, and the regeneration of criminals became a very\r\npopular undertaking. New prisons were built; and, for the first time,\r\nthe idea of reforming as well as of punishing the delinquent, formed\r\na part of prison discipline. But this happy alteration, in which the\r\npublic had taken so hearty an interest, and which the exertions of\r\nthe citizens had irresistibly accelerated, could not be completed in a\r\nmoment. While the new penitentiaries were being erected (and it was the\r\npleasure of the majority they should be terminated with all possible\r\ncelerity), the old prisons existed, which still contained a great number\r\nof offenders. These jails became more unwholesome and more corrupt\r\nin proportion as the new establishments were beautified and improved,\r\nforming a contrast which may readily be understood. The majority was so\r\neagerly employed in founding the new prisons, that those which already\r\nexisted were forgotten; and as the general attention was diverted to a\r\nnovel object, the care which had hitherto been bestowed upon the others\r\nceased. The salutary regulations of discipline were first relaxed, and\r\nafterward broken; so that in the immediate neighborhood of a prison\r\nwhich bore witness to the mild and enlightened spirit of our time,\r\ndungeons might be met with, which reminded the visitor of the barbarity\r\nof the middle ages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY.\r\n\r\nHow the Principle of the Sovereignty of the People is to be\r\nunderstood.--Impossibility of conceiving a mixed Government.--The\r\nsovereign Power must centre somewhere.--Precautions to be taken to\r\ncontrol its Action.--These Precautions have not been taken in the United\r\nStates.--Consequences.\r\n\r\nI hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that, politically\r\nspeaking, a people has a right to do whatsoever it pleases; and yet I\r\nhave asserted that all authority originates in the will of the majority.\r\nAm I, then, in contradiction with myself?\r\n\r\nA general law--which bears the name of justice--has been made and\r\nsanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that people, but by\r\na majority of mankind. The rights of every people are consequently\r\nconfined within the limits of what is just. A nation may be considered\r\nin the light of a jury which is empowered to represent society at large,\r\nand to apply the great and general law of justice. Ought such a jury,\r\nwhich represents society, to have more power than the society in which\r\nthe laws it applies originate?\r\n\r\nWhen I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which\r\nthe majority has of commanding, but I simply appeal from the sovereignty\r\nof the people to the sovereignty of mankind. It has been asserted that\r\na people can never entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of\r\nreason in those affairs which are more peculiarly its own; and that\r\nconsequently full power may fearlessly be given to the majority by which\r\nit is represented. But this language is that of a slave.\r\n\r\nA majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose opinions,\r\nand most frequently whose interests, are opposed to those of another\r\nbeing, which is styled a minority. If it be admitted that a man,\r\npossessing absolute power, may misuse that power by wronging his\r\nadversaries, why should a majority not be liable to the same reproach?\r\nMen are not apt to change their characters by agglomeration; nor\r\ndoes their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the\r\nconsciousness of their strength.[184] And for these reasons I can never\r\nwillingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures with that unlimited\r\nauthority which I should refuse to any one of them.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is possible to combine several principles in the same\r\ngovernment, so as at the same time to maintain freedom, and really to\r\noppose them to one another. The form of government which is usually\r\ntermed _mixed_ has always appeared to me to be a mere chimera.\r\nAccurately speaking, there is no such thing as a mixed government (with\r\nthe meaning usually given to that word), because in all communities some\r\none principle of action may be discovered, which preponderates over\r\nthe others. England in the last century, which has been more especially\r\ncited as an example of this form of government, was in point of fact\r\nan essentially aristocratic state, although it comprised very powerful\r\nelements of democracy: for the laws and customs of the country were\r\nsuch, that the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end, and\r\nsubject the direction of public affairs to its own will. The error arose\r\nfrom too much attention being paid to the actual struggle which was\r\ngoing on between the nobles and the people, without considering the\r\nprobable issue of the contest, which was in reality the important point.\r\nWhen a community really has a mixed government, that is to say, when it\r\nis equally divided between two adverse principles, it must either pass\r\nthrough a revolution, or fall into complete dissolution.\r\n\r\nI am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be made\r\nto predominate over the others; but I think that liberty is endangered\r\nwhen this power is checked by no obstacles which may retard its course,\r\nand force it to moderate its own vehemence.\r\n\r\nUnlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing; human beings\r\nare not competent to exercise it with discretion; and God alone can be\r\nomnipotent, because his wisdom and his justice are always equal to his\r\npower. But no power upon earth is so worthy of honor for itself, or of\r\nreverential obedience to the rights which it represents, that I would\r\nconsent to admit its uncontrolled and all-predominate authority. When I\r\nsee that the right and the means of absolute command are conferred on a\r\npeople or upon a king, upon an aristocracy or a democracy, a monarchy or\r\na republic, I recognize the germ of tyranny, and I journey onward to a\r\nland of more hopeful institutions.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the main evil of the present democratic institutions of\r\nthe United States does not arise, as is often asserted in Europe, from\r\ntheir weakness, but from their overpowering strength; and I am not so\r\nmuch alarmed at the excessive liberty which reigns in that country, as\r\nat the very inadequate securities which exist against tyranny.\r\n\r\nWhen an individual or a party is wronged in the United States, to\r\nwhom can he apply for redress? If to public opinion, public opinion\r\nconstitutes the majority; if to the legislature, it represents the\r\nmajority, and implicitly obeys its instructions: if to the executive\r\npower, it is appointed by the majority and is a passive tool in its\r\nhands; the public troops consist of the majority under arms; the jury is\r\nthe majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases; and\r\nin certain states even the judges are elected by the majority. However\r\niniquitous or absurd the evil of which you complain may be, you must\r\nsubmit to it as well as you can.[185]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, a legislative power could be so constituted as\r\nto represent the majority without necessarily being the slave of its\r\npassions; an executive, so as to retain a certain degree of uncontrolled\r\nauthority; and a judiciary, so as to remain independent of the two other\r\npowers; a government would be formed which would still be democratic,\r\nwithout incurring any risk of tyrannical abuse.\r\n\r\nI do not say that tyrannical abuses frequently occur in America at the\r\npresent day; but I maintain that no sure barrier is established against\r\nthem, and that the causes which mitigate the government are to be found\r\nin the circumstances and the manners of the country more than its laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE UNLIMITED POWER OF THE MAJORITY UPON THE ARBITRARY\r\nAUTHORITY OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nLiberty left by the American Laws to public Officers within a certain\r\nSphere.--Their Power.\r\n\r\nA distinction must be drawn between tyranny and arbitrary power.\r\nTyranny may be exercised by means of the law, and in that case it is\r\nnot arbitrary; arbitrary power may be exercised for the good of the\r\ncommunity at large, in which case it is not tyrannical. Tyranny usually\r\nemploys arbitrary means, but, if necessary, it can rule without them.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the unbounded power of the majority, which is\r\nfavorable to the legal despotism of the legislature, is likewise\r\nfavorable to the arbitrary authority of the magistrates. The majority\r\nhas an entire control over the law when it is made and when it is\r\nexecuted; and as it possesses an equal authority over those who are in\r\npower, and the community at large, it considers public officers as its\r\npassive agents, and readily confides the task of serving its designs to\r\ntheir vigilance. The details of their office and the privileges which\r\nthey are to enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority treats\r\nthem as a master does his servants, when they are always at work in his\r\nsight, and he has the power of directing or reprimanding them at every\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nIn general the American functionaries are far more independent than the\r\nFrench civil officers, within the sphere which is prescribed to them.\r\nSometimes, even, they are allowed by the popular authority to exceed\r\nthose bounds; and as they are protected by the opinion, and backed by\r\nthe cooperation of the majority, they venture upon such manifestations\r\nof their power as astonish a European. By this means habits are formed\r\nin the heart of a free country which may some day prove fatal to its\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOWER EXERCISED BY THE MAJORITY IN AMERICA UPON OPINION.\r\n\r\nIn America, when the Majority has once irrevocably decided a Question,\r\nall Discussion ceases.--Reason of this.--Moral Power exercised by the\r\nMajority upon Opinion.--Democratic Republics have deprived Despotism of\r\nits physical Instruments.--Their Despotism sways the Minds of Men.\r\n\r\nIt is in the examination of the display of public opinion in the United\r\nStates, that we clearly perceive how far the power of the majority\r\nsurpasses all the powers with which we are acquainted in Europe.\r\nIntellectual principles exercise an influence which is so invisible and\r\noften so inappreciable, that they baffle the toils of oppression. At the\r\npresent time the most absolute monarchs in Europe are unable to prevent\r\ncertain notions, which are opposed to their authority, from circulating\r\nin secret throughout their dominions, and even in their courts. Such\r\nis not the case in America; so long as the majority is still undecided,\r\ndiscussion is carried on; but as soon as its decision is irrevocably\r\npronounced, a submissive silence is observed; and the friends, as well\r\nas the opponents of the measure, unite in assenting to its propriety.\r\nThe reason of this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so absolute as to\r\ncombine all the powers of society in his own hands, and to conquer all\r\nopposition, with the energy of a majority, which is invested with the\r\nright of making and of executing the laws.\r\n\r\nThe authority of a king is purely physical, and it controls the actions\r\nof the subject without subduing his private will; but the majority\r\npossesses a power which is physical and moral at the same time; it acts\r\nupon the will as well as upon the actions of men, and it represses not\r\nonly all contest, but all controversy.\r\n\r\nI know no country in which there is so little true independence of mind\r\nand freedom of discussion as in America. In any constitutional state in\r\nEurope every sort of religious and political theory may be advocated and\r\npropagated abroad; for there is no country in Europe so subdued by any\r\nsingle authority, as not to contain citizens who are ready to\r\nprotect the man who raises his voice in the cause of truth, from the\r\nconsequences of his hardihood. If he is unfortunate enough to live under\r\nan absolute government, the people is upon his side; if he inhabits a\r\nfree country, he may find a shelter behind the authority of the throne,\r\nif he require one. The aristocratic part of society supports him in some\r\ncountries, and the democracy in others. But in a nation where democratic\r\ninstitutions exist, organized like those of the United States, there is\r\nbut one sole authority, one single element of strength and success, with\r\nnothing beyond it.\r\n\r\nIn America, the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty\r\nof opinion: within these barriers an author may write whatever he\r\npleases, but he will repent it if he ever step beyond them. Not that he\r\nis exposed to the terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by\r\nthe slights and persecutions of daily obloquy. His political career is\r\nclosed for ever, since he has offended the only authority which is\r\nable to promote his success. Every sort of compensation, even that\r\nof celebrity, is refused to him. Before he published his opinions, he\r\nimagined that he held them in common with many others; but no sooner has\r\nhe declared them openly, than he is loudly censured by his overbearing\r\nopponents, while those who think, without having the courage to speak,\r\nlike him, abandon him in silence. He yields at length, oppressed by the\r\ndaily efforts he has been making, and he subsides into silence as if he\r\nwas tormented by remorse for having spoken the truth.\r\n\r\nFetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which tyranny formerly\r\nemployed; but the civilisation of our age has refined the arts of\r\ndespotism, which seemed however to have been sufficiently perfected\r\nbefore. The excesses of monarchical power had devised a variety of\r\npolitical means of oppression; the democratic republics of the present\r\nday have rendered it as entirely an affair of the mind, as that will\r\nwhich it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of an individual\r\ndespot, the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul; and the soul\r\nescaped the blows which were directed against it, and rose superior to\r\nthe attempt; but such is not the course adopted by tyranny in democratic\r\nrepublics; there the body is left free, and the soul is enslaved. The\r\nsovereign can no longer say, \"You shall think as I do on pain of death;\"\r\nbut he says, \"You are free to think differently from me, and to retain\r\nyour life, your property, and all that you possess; but if such be your\r\ndetermination, you are henceforth an alien among your people. You may\r\nretain your civil rights, but they will be useless to you, for you will\r\nnever be chosen by your fellow-citizens, if you solicit their suffrages;\r\nand they will affect to scorn you, if you solicit their esteem. You will\r\nremain among men, but you will be deprived of the rights of mankind.\r\nYour fellow-creatures will shun you like an impure being; and those who\r\nare most persuaded of your innocence will abandon you too, lest they\r\nshould be shunned in their turn. Go in peace! I have given you your\r\nlife, but it is an existence incomparably worse than death.\"\r\n\r\nAbsolute monarchies have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us beware\r\nlest democratic republics should restore oppression, and should render\r\nit less odious and less degrading in the eyes of the many, by making it\r\nstill more onerous to the few.\r\n\r\nWorks have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World,\r\nexpressly intended to censure the vices and deride the follies of the\r\ntime; Labruyère inhabited the palace of Louis XIV. when he composed his\r\nchapter upon the Great, and Molière criticised the courtiers in the very\r\npieces which were acted before the court. But the ruling power in the\r\nUnited States is not to be made game of; the smallest reproach irritates\r\nits sensibility, and the slightest joke which has any foundation in\r\ntruth, renders it indignant; from the style of its language to the more\r\nsolid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject\r\nof encomium. No writer, whatever be his eminence, can escape from this\r\ntribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens. The majority lives in the\r\nperpetual exercise of self-applause; and there are certain truths which\r\nthe Americans can only learn from strangers or from experience.\r\n\r\nIf great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason\r\nis very simply given in these facts; there can be no literary genius\r\nwithout freedom of opinion, and freedom of opinion does not exist in\r\nAmerica. The inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number\r\nof anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the\r\nmajority succeeds much better in the United States, since it actually\r\nremoves the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are to be met with in\r\nAmerica, but, to say the truth, there is no public organ of infidelity.\r\nAttempts have been made by some governments to protect the morality of\r\nnations by prohibiting licentious books. In the United States no one is\r\npunished for this sort of works, but no one is induced to write them;\r\nnot because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but\r\nbecause the majority of the community is decent and orderly.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power\r\nare unquestionable; and I am simply discussing the nature of the\r\npower itself. This irresistible authority is a constant fact, and its\r\nbeneficent exercise is an accidental occurrence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY UPON THE NATIONAL CHARACTER IN\r\nTHE AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nEffects of the Tyranny of the Majority more sensibly felt hitherto in\r\nthe Manners than in the Conduct of Society.--They check the development\r\nof leading Characters.--Democratic Republics, organized like the United\r\nStates, bring the Practice of courting favor within the reach of the\r\nmany.--Proofs of this Spirit in the United States.--Why there is more\r\nPatriotism in the People than in those who govern in its name.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very slightly\r\nperceptible in political society; but they already begin to exercise an\r\nunfavorable influence upon the national character of the Americans. I am\r\ninclined to attribute the paucity of distinguished political characters\r\nto the ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the majority in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen the American revolution broke out, they arose in great numbers;\r\nfor public opinion then served, not to tyrannize over, but to direct the\r\nexertions of individuals. Those celebrated men took a full part in the\r\ngeneral agitation of mind common at that period, and they attained a\r\nhigh degree of personal fame, which was reflected back upon the nation,\r\nbut which was by no means borrowed from it.\r\n\r\nIn absolute governments, the great nobles who are nearest to the throne\r\nflatter the passions of the sovereign, and voluntarily truckle to\r\nhis caprices. But the mass of the nation does not degrade itself\r\nby servitude; it often submits from weakness, from habit, or from\r\nignorance, and sometimes from loyalty. Some nations have been known to\r\nsacrifice their own desires to those of the sovereign with pleasure and\r\nwith pride; thus exhibiting a sort of independence in the very act of\r\nsubmission. These peoples are miserable, but they are not degraded.\r\nThere is a great difference between doing what one does not approve, and\r\nfeigning to approve what one does; the one is the necessary case of a\r\nweak person, the other befits the temper of a lacquey.\r\n\r\nIn free countries, where every one is more or less called upon to give\r\nhis opinions in the affairs of state; in democratic republics, where\r\npublic life is incessantly commingled with domestic affairs, where the\r\nsovereign authority is accessible on every side, and where its attention\r\ncan almost always be attracted by vociferation, more persons are to be\r\nmet with who speculate upon its foibles, and live at the cost of its\r\npassions, than in absolute monarchies. Not because men are naturally\r\nworse in these states than elsewhere, but the temptation is stronger,\r\nand of easier access at the same time. The result is a far more\r\nextensive debasement of the characters of citizens.\r\n\r\nDemocratic republics extend the practice of currying favor with the\r\nmany, and they introduce it into a great number of classes at once: this\r\nis one of the most serious reproaches that can be addressed to them. In\r\ndemocratic states organized on the principles of the American republics,\r\nthis is more especially the case, where the authority of the majority is\r\nso absolute and so irresistible, that a man must give up his rights as\r\na citizen, and almost abjure his quality as a human being, if he intends\r\nto stray from the track which it lays down.\r\n\r\nIn that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to power in the United\r\nStates, I found very few men who displayed any of that manly candor, and\r\nthat masculine independence of opinion, which frequently distinguished\r\nthe Americans in former times, and which constitute the leading feature\r\nin distinguished characters wheresoever they may be found. It seems, at\r\nfirst sight, as if all the minds of the Americans were formed upon one\r\nmodel, so accurately do they correspond in their manner of judging. A\r\nstranger does, indeed, sometimes meet with Americans who dissent from\r\nthese rigorous formularies; with men who deplore the defects of the\r\nlaws, the mutability and the ignorance of democracy; who even go so far\r\nas to observe the evil tendencies which impair the national character,\r\nand to point out such remedies as it might be possible to apply; but\r\nno one is there to hear these things besides yourself, and you, to whom\r\nthese secret reflections are confided, are a stranger and a bird of\r\npassage. They are very ready to communicate truths which are useless to\r\nyou, but they continue to hold a different language in public.\r\n\r\nIf ever these lines are read in America, I am well assured of two\r\nthings: in the first place, that all who peruse them will raise their\r\nvoices to condemn me; and in the second place, that very many of them\r\nwill acquit me at the bottom of their conscience.\r\n\r\n[The author's views upon what he terms the tyranny of the majority, the\r\ndespotism of public opinion in the United States, have already excited\r\nsome remarks in this country, and will probably give occasion to more.\r\nAs stated in the preface to this edition, the editor does not conceive\r\nhimself called upon to discuss the speculative opinions of the\r\nauthor and supposes he will best discharge his duty by confining his\r\nobservations to what he deems errors of fact or law. But in reference to\r\nthis particular subject, it seems due to the author to remark, that\r\nhe visited the United States at a particular time, when a successful\r\npolitical chieftain had succeeded in establishing his party in power, as\r\nit seemed, firmly and permanently; when the preponderance of that party\r\nwas immense, and when there seemed little prospect of any change. He may\r\nhave met with men, who sank under the astonishing popularity of General\r\nJackson, who despaired of the republic, and who therefore shrank from\r\nthe expression of their opinions. It must be confessed, however, that\r\nthe author is obnoxious to the charge which has been made, of the want\r\nof perspicuity and distinctness in this part of his work. He does not\r\nmean that the press was silent, for he has himself not only noticed, but\r\nfurnished proof of the great freedom, not to say licentiousness, with\r\nwhich it assailed the character of the president, and the measures of\r\nhis administration.\r\n\r\nHe does not mean to represent the opponents of the dominant party\r\nas having thrown down their weapons of warfare, for his book shows\r\nthroughout his knowledge of the existence of an active and able party,\r\nconstantly opposing and harassing the administration.\r\n\r\nBut, after a careful perusal of the chapters on this subject, the editor\r\nis inclined to the opinion, that M. De Tocqueville intends to speak of\r\nthe _tyranny of the party_ in excluding from public employment all those\r\nwho do not adopt the _Shibboleth_ of the majority. The language at pp.\r\n266, 267, which he puts in the mouth of a majority, and his observations\r\nimmediately preceding this note, seem to furnish the key to his meaning;\r\nalthough it must be admitted that there are other passages to which a\r\nwider construction may be given. Perhaps they may be reconciled by the\r\nidea that the author considers the acts and opinions of the dominant\r\nparty as the just and true expression of public opinion. And hence,\r\nwhen he speaks of the intolerance of public opinion, he means\r\nthe exclusiveness of the party, which, for the time being, may be\r\npredominant. He had seen men of acknowledged competency removed from\r\noffice, or excluded from it, wholly on the ground of their entertaining\r\nopinions hostile to those of the dominant party, or majority. And he had\r\nseen this system extended to the very lowest officers of the government,\r\nand applied by the electors in their choice of all officers of all\r\ndescriptions; and this he deemed persecution--tyranny--despotism. But he\r\nsurely is mistaken in representing the effect of this system of terror\r\nas stifling all complaint, silencing all opposition, and inducing\r\n\"enemies and friends to yoke themselves alike to the triumphant car of\r\nthe majority.\" He mistook a temporary state of parties for a permanent\r\nand ordinary result, and he was carried away by the immense majority\r\nthat then supported the administration, to the belief of a universal\r\nacquiescence. Without intending here to speak of the merits or demerits\r\nof those who represented that majority, it is proper to remark, that\r\nthe great change which has taken place since the period when the author\r\nwrote, in the political condition of the very persons who he supposed\r\nthen wielded the terrors of disfranchisement against their opponents, in\r\nitself furnishes a full and complete demonstration of the error of\r\nhis opinions respecting the \"true independence of mind and freedom of\r\ndiscussion\" in America. For without such discussion to enlighten the\r\nminds of the people, and without a stern independence of the rewards\r\nand threats of those in power, the change alluded to could not have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to complain not only of the ambiguity, but of the style\r\nof exaggeration which pervades all the remarks of the author on this\r\nsubject--so different from the well considered and nicely adjusted\r\nlanguage employed by him on all other topics. Thus, p. 262, he implies\r\nthat there is no means of redress afforded even by the judiciary, for a\r\nwrong committed by the majority. His error is, _first_, in supposing the\r\njury to constitute the judicial power; _second_, overlooking what he has\r\nhimself elsewhere so well described, the independence of the judiciary,\r\nand its means of controlling the action of a majority in a state or\r\nin the federal government; and _thirdly_, in omitting the proper\r\nconsideration of the frequent changes of popular sentiment by which the\r\nmajority of yesterday becomes the minority of to-day, and its acts of\r\ninjustice are reversed.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the instances which he cites at this page, do not\r\nestablish his position respecting the disposition of the majority. The\r\nriot at Baltimore was, like other riots in England and in France, the\r\nresult of popular phrensy excited to madness by conduct of the\r\nmost provoking character. The majority in the state of Maryland and\r\nthroughout the United States, highly disapproved the acts of violence\r\ncommitted on the occasion. The acquittal by a jury of those arraigned\r\nfor the murder of General Lingan, proves only that there was not\r\nsufficient evidence to identify the accused, or that the jury was\r\ngoverned by passion. It is not perceived how the majority of the people\r\nare answerable for the verdicts rendered. The guilty have often been\r\nerroneously acquitted in all countries, and in France particularly,\r\nrecent instances are not wanting of acquittals especially in\r\nprosecutions for political offences, against clear and indisputable\r\ntestimony. And it was entirely fortuitous that the jury was composed of\r\nmen whose sympathies were with the rioters and murderers, if the\r\nfact was so. It not unfrequently happens that a jury taken from lists\r\nfurnished years perhaps, and always a long time, before the trial, are\r\ndecidedly hostile to the temporary prevailing sentiments of their city,\r\ncounty, or state.\r\n\r\nAs in the other instance, if the inhabitant of Pennsylvania intended\r\nto intimate to our author, that a colored voter would be in personal\r\njeopardy for venturing to appear at the polls to exercise his right,\r\nit must be said in truth, that the incident was local and peculiar, and\r\ncontrary to what is annually seen throughout the states where colored\r\npersons are permitted to vote, who exercise that privilege with as full\r\nimmunity from injury or oppression, as any white citizen. And, after\r\nall, it is believed that the state of feeling intimated by the informant\r\nof our author, is but an indication of dislike to a _caste_ degraded\r\nby servitude and ignorance; and it is not perceived how it proves the\r\ndespotism of a majority over the freedom and independence of opinion.\r\nIf it be true, it proves a detestable tyranny over _acts_, over the\r\nexercise of an acknowledged right. The apprehensions of a mob committing\r\nviolence deterred the colored voters from approaching the polls. Are\r\ninstances unknown in England or even in France, of peaceable subjects\r\nbeing prevented by mobs or the fear of them, from the exercise of a\r\nright, from the discharge of a duty? And are they evidences of the\r\ndespotism of a majority in those countries?--_American Editor._]\r\n\r\nI have heard of patriotism in the United States, and it is a virtue\r\nwhich may be found among the people, but never among the leaders of\r\nthe people. This may be explained by analogy; despotism debases the\r\noppressed, much more than the oppressor; in absolute monarchies the king\r\nhas often great virtues, but the courtiers are invariably servile. It\r\nis true that the American courtiers do not say, \"sire,\" or \"your\r\nmajesty\"--a distinction without a difference. They are for ever talking\r\nof the natural intelligence of the populace they serve; they do not\r\ndebate the question as to which of the virtues of their master are\r\npre-eminently worthy of admiration; for they assure him that he\r\npossesses all the virtues under heaven without having acquired them, or\r\nwithout caring to acquire them: they do not give him their daughters and\r\ntheir wives to be raised at his pleasure to the rank of his concubines,\r\nbut, by sacrificing their opinions, they prostitute themselves.\r\nMoralists and philosophers in America are not obliged to conceal their\r\nopinions under the veil of allegory; but, before they venture upon\r\na harsh truth, they say: \"We are aware that the people which we are\r\naddressing is too superior to all the weaknesses of human nature to lose\r\nthe command of its temper for an instant; and we should not hold this\r\nlanguage if we were not speaking to men, whom their virtues and their\r\nintelligence render more worthy of freedom than all the rest of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible for the sycophants of Louis XIV. to\r\nflatter more dexterously. For my part, I am persuaded that in all\r\ngovernments, whatever their nature may be, servility will cower to\r\nforce, and adulation will cling to power. The only means of preventing\r\nmen from degrading themselves, is to invest no one with that unlimited\r\nauthority which is the surest method of debasing them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GREATEST DANGERS OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLICS PROCEED FROM THE\r\nUNLIMITED POWER OF THE MAJORITY.\r\n\r\nDemocratic Republics liable to perish from a misuse of their Power, and\r\nnot by Impotence.--The Governments of the American Republics are\r\nmore Centralized and more Energetic than those of the Monarchies\r\nof Europe.--Dangers resulting from this.--Opinions of Hamilton and\r\nJefferson upon this Point.\r\n\r\nGovernments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyranny. In\r\nthe former case their power escapes from them: it is wrested from their\r\ngrasp in the latter. Many observers who have noticed the anarchy of\r\ndomestic states, have imagined that the government of those states was\r\nnaturally weak and impotent. The truth is, that when once hostilities\r\nare begun between parties, the government loses its control over\r\nsociety. But I do not think that a democratic power is naturally without\r\nresources: say rather, that it is almost always by the abuse of its\r\nforce, and the misemployment of its resources, that a democratic\r\ngovernment fails. Anarchy is almost always produced by its tyranny or\r\nits mistakes, but not by its want of strength.\r\n\r\nIt is important not to confound stability with force, or the greatness\r\nof a thing with its duration. In democratic republics, the power which\r\ndirects[186] society is not stable; for it often changes hands and\r\nassumes a new direction. But whichever way it turns, its force is almost\r\nirresistible. The governments of the American republics appear to me to\r\nbe as much centralized as those of the absolute monarchies of Europe,\r\nand more energetic than they are. I do not, therefore, imagine that they\r\nwill perish from weakness.[187]\r\n\r\nIf ever the free institutions of America are destroyed, that event may\r\nbe attributed to the unlimited authority of the majority, which may at\r\nsome future time urge the minorities to desperation, and oblige them to\r\nhave recourse to physical force. Anarchy will then be the result, but it\r\nwill have been brought about by despotism.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the Federalist, No. 51.\r\n\"It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society\r\nagainst the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the\r\nsociety against the injustice of the other part. Justice is the end of\r\ngovernment. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever\r\nwill be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the\r\npursuit. In a society, under the forms of which the stronger faction can\r\nreadily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said\r\nto reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not\r\nsecured against the violence of the stronger: and as in the latter state\r\neven the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their\r\ncondition to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well\r\nas themselves, so in the former state will the more powerful factions be\r\ngradually induced by a like motive to wish for a government which will\r\nprotect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be\r\nlittle doubted, that if the state of Rhode Island was separated from\r\nthe confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the\r\npopular form of government within such narrow limits, would be displayed\r\nby such reiterated oppression of the factious majorities, that some\r\npower altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by\r\nthe voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson has also expressed himself in a letter to Madison:[188] \"The\r\nexecutive power in our government is not the only, perhaps not even the\r\nprincipal object of my solicitude. The tyranny of the legislature is\r\nreally the danger most to be feared, and will continue to be so for many\r\nyears to come. The tyranny of the executive power will come in its turn,\r\nbut at a more distant period.\"\r\n\r\nI am glad to cite the opinion of Jefferson upon this subject rather than\r\nthat of another, because I consider him to be the most powerful advocate\r\ndemocracy has ever sent forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[182] We observed in examining the federal constitution that the efforts\r\nof the legislators of the Union had been diametrically opposed to the\r\npresent tendency. The consequence has been that the federal government\r\nis more independent in its sphere than that of the states. But the\r\nfederal government scarcely ever interferes in any but external affairs;\r\nand the governments of the states are in reality the authorities which\r\ndirect society in America.\r\n\r\n[183] The legislative acts promulgated by the state of Massachusetts\r\nalone, from the year 1780 to the present time, already fill three stout\r\nvolumes: and it must not be forgotten that the collection to which I\r\nallude was published in 1823, when many old laws which had fallen into\r\ndisuse were omitted. The state of Massachusetts, which is not more\r\npopulous than a department of France, may be considered as the most\r\nstable, the most consistent, and the most sagacious in its undertakings\r\nof the whole Union.\r\n\r\n[184] No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong another\r\npeople: but parties may be looked upon as lesser nations within a\r\ngreater one, and they are aliens to each other: if therefore it be\r\nadmitted that a nation can act tyrannically toward another nation, it\r\ncannot be denied that a party may do the same toward another party.\r\n\r\n[185] A striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned by\r\nthe despotism of the majority occurred at Baltimore in the year 1812.\r\nAt that time the war was very popular in Baltimore. A journal which\r\nhad taken the other side of the question excited the indignation of\r\nthe inhabitants by its opposition. The populace assembled, broke the\r\nprinting-presses, and attacked the houses of the newspaper editors. The\r\nmilitia was called out, but no one obeyed the call; and the only means\r\nof saving the poor wretches who were threatened by the phrensy of the\r\nmob, was to throw them into prison as common malefactors. But even this\r\nprecaution was ineffectual; the mob collected again during the night;\r\nthe magistrates again made a vain attempt to call out the militia; the\r\nprison was forced, one of the newspaper editors was killed upon the\r\nspot, and the others were left for dead: the guilty parties were\r\nacquitted by the jury when they were brought to trial.\r\n\r\nI said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania: \"Be so good as to\r\nexplain to me how it happens, that in a state founded by quakers, and\r\ncelebrated for its toleration, freed blacks are not allowed to exercise\r\ncivil rights. They pay the taxes: is it not fair that they should have a\r\nvote.\"\r\n\r\n\"You insult us,\" replied my informant, \"if you imagine that our\r\nlegislators could have committed so gross an act of injustice and\r\nintolerance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, the blacks possess the right of voting in this country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without the smallest doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"How comes it then, that at the polling-booth this morning I did not\r\nperceive a single negro in the whole meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not the fault of the law; the negroes have the undisputed right\r\nof voting; but they voluntarily abstain from making their appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very pretty piece of modesty on their parts,\" rejoined I.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the truth is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but they are\r\nafraid of being maltreated; in this country the law is sometimes unable\r\nto maintain its authority without the support of the majority. But in\r\nthis case the majority entertains very strong prejudices against the\r\nblacks, and the magistrates are unable to protect them in the exercise\r\nof their legal privileges.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, the majority claims the right not only of making the laws,\r\nbut of breaking the laws it has made?\"\r\n\r\n[186] This power may be centred in an assembly, in which case it will be\r\nstrong without being stable; or it may be centred in an individual, in\r\nwhich case it will be less strong, but more stable.\r\n\r\n[187] I presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader here,\r\nas well as throughout the remainder of this chapter, that I am speaking\r\nnot of the federal government, but of the several governments of each\r\nstate which the majority controls at its pleasure.\r\n\r\n[188] 15th March, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCAUSES WHICH MITIGATE THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe national Majority does not pretend to conduct all Business.--Is\r\nobliged to employ the town and county Magistrates to execute its supreme\r\nDecisions.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between\r\na centralized government and a centralized administration. The former\r\nexists in America, but the latter is nearly unknown there. If the\r\ndirecting power of the American communities had both these instruments\r\nof government at its disposal, and united the habit of executing its own\r\ncommands to the right of commanding; if, after having established the\r\ngeneral principles of government, it descended to the details of public\r\nbusiness; and if, having regulated the great interests of the country,\r\nit would penetrate into the privacy of individual interest, freedom\r\nwould soon be banished from the New World.\r\n\r\nBut in the United States the majority, which so frequently displays the\r\ntastes and the propensities of a despot, is still destitute of the more\r\nperfect instruments of tyranny.\r\n\r\nIn the American republics the activity of the central government\r\nhas never as yet been extended beyond a limited number of objects\r\nsufficiently prominent to call forth its attention. The secondary\r\naffairs of society have never been regulated by its authority; and\r\nnothing has hitherto betrayed its desire of interfering in them. The\r\nmajority is become more and more absolute, but it has not increased the\r\nprerogatives of the central government; those great prerogatives have\r\nbeen confined to a certain sphere; and although the despotism of the\r\nmajority may be galling upon one point, it cannot be said to extend to\r\nall. However the predominant party of the nation may be carried away by\r\nits passions; however ardent it may be in the pursuit of its projects,\r\nit cannot oblige all the citizens to comply with its desire in the same\r\nmanner, and at the same time, throughout the country. When the central\r\ngovernment which represents that majority has issued a decree, it must\r\nintrust the execution of its will to agents, over whom it frequently\r\nhas no control, and whom it cannot perpetually direct. The townships,\r\nmunicipal bodies, and counties, may therefore be looked upon as\r\nconcealed breakwaters, which check or part the tide of popular\r\nexcitement. If an oppressive law were passed, the liberties of the\r\npeople would still be protected by the means by which that law would be\r\nput in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details, and (as I\r\nwill venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative tyranny.\r\nNor does the people entertain that full consciousness of its authority,\r\nwhich would prompt it to interfere in these matters; it knows the\r\nextent of its natural powers, but it is unacquainted with the increased\r\nresources which the art of government might furnish.\r\n\r\nThis point deserves attention; for if a democratic republic, similar\r\nto that of the United States, were ever founded in a country where the\r\npower of a single individual had previously subsisted, and the effects\r\nof a centralized administration had sunk deep into the habits and the\r\nlaws of the people, I do not hesitate to assert, that in that country a\r\nmore insufferable despotism would prevail than any which now exists in\r\nthe absolute monarchies of Europe; or indeed than any which could be\r\nfound on this side the confines of Asia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSION OF THE LAW IN THE UNITED STATES SERVES TO COUNTERPOISE\r\nTHE DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nUtility of discriminating the natural Propensities of the Members of\r\nthe legal Profession.--These Men called upon to act a prominent Part in\r\nfuture Society.--In what Manner the peculiar Pursuits of Lawyers give\r\nan aristocratic turn to their Ideas.--Accidental Causes which may check\r\nthis Tendency.--Ease with which the Aristocracy coalesces with legal\r\nMen.--Use of Lawyers to a Despot.--The Profession of the Law constitutes\r\nthe only aristocratic Element with which the natural Elements of\r\nDemocracy will combine.--Peculiar Causes which tend to give an\r\naristocratic turn of Mind to the English and American Lawyer.--The\r\nAristocracy of America is on the Bench and at the Bar.--Influence of\r\nLawyers upon American Society.--Their peculiar magisterial Habits affect\r\nthe Legislature, the Administration, and even the People.\r\n\r\nIn visiting the Americans and in studying their laws, we perceive that\r\nthe authority they have intrusted to members of the legal profession,\r\nand the influence which these individuals exercise in the government, is\r\nthe most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy.\r\n\r\nThis effect seems to me to result from a general cause which it is\r\nuseful to investigate, since it may produce analogous consequences\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all\r\nthe vicissitudes of political society in Europe during the last five\r\nhundred years. At one time they have been the instruments of those\r\nwho are invested with political authority, and at another they have\r\nsucceeded in converting political authorities into their instrument. In\r\nthe middle ages they afforded a powerful support to the crown; and since\r\nthat period they have exerted themselves to the utmost to limit the\r\nroyal prerogative. In England they have contracted a close alliance with\r\nthe aristocracy; in France they have proved to be the most dangerous\r\nenemies of that class. It is my object to inquire whether, under all\r\nthese circumstances, the members of the legal profession have been\r\nswayed by sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been\r\nimpelled by principles which are inherent in their pursuits, and which\r\nwill always recur in history. I am incited to this investigation by\r\nreflecting that this particular class of men will most likely play a\r\nprominent part in that order of things to which the events of our time\r\nare giving birth.\r\n\r\nMen who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits,\r\nderive from those occupations certain habits of order, a taste for\r\nformalities, and a kind of instinctive regard for the regular connexion\r\nof ideas, which naturally render them very hostile to the revolutionary\r\nspirit and the unreflecting passions of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe special information which lawyers derive from their studies, ensures\r\nthem a separate station in society: and they constitute a sort of\r\nprivileged body in the scale of intelligence. This notion of their\r\nsuperiority perpetually recurs to them in the practice of their\r\nprofession: they are the masters of a science which is necessary, but\r\nwhich is not very generally known: they serve as arbiters between the\r\ncitizens; and the habit of directing the blind passions of parties in\r\nlitigation to their purpose, inspires them with a certain contempt\r\nfor the judgment of the multitude. To this it may be added, that they\r\nnaturally constitute _a body_; not by any previous understanding, or\r\nby any agreement which directs them to a common end; but the analogy\r\nof their studies and the uniformity of their proceedings connect\r\ntheir minds together, as much as a common interest would combine their\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\nA portion of the tastes and of the habits of the aristocracy may\r\nconsequently be discovered in the characters of men in the profession of\r\nthe law. They participate in the same instinctive love of order and of\r\nformalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions of\r\nthe multitude, and the same secret contempt of the government of the\r\npeople. I do not mean to say that the natural propensities of lawyers\r\nare sufficiently strong to sway them irresistibly; for they, like most\r\nother men, are governed by their private interests and the advantages of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nIn a state of society in which the members of the legal profession are\r\nprevented from holding that rank in the political world which they enjoy\r\nin private life, we may rest assured that they will be the foremost\r\nagents of revolution. But it must then be inquired whether the cause\r\nwhich induces them to innovate and to destroy is accidental, or whether\r\nit belongs to some lasting purpose which they entertain. It is true that\r\nlawyers mainly contributed to the overthrow of the French monarchy in\r\n1789; but it remains to be seen whether they acted thus because they had\r\nstudied the laws, or because they were prohibited from co-operating in\r\nthe work of legislation.\r\n\r\nFive hundred years ago the English nobles headed the people, and spoke\r\nin its name; at the present time, the aristocracy supports the throne,\r\nand defends the royal prerogative. But aristocracy has, notwithstanding\r\nthis, its peculiar instincts and propensities. We must be careful not\r\nto confound isolated members of a body with the body itself. In all\r\nfree governments, of whatsoever form they may be, members of the legal\r\nprofession may be found at the head of all parties. The same remark\r\nis also applicable to the aristocracy; for almost all the democratic\r\nconvulsions which have agitated the world have been directed by nobles.\r\n\r\nA privileged body can never satisfy the ambition of all its members;\r\nit has always more talents and more passions than it can find places to\r\ncontent and to employ; so that a considerable number of individuals\r\nare usually to be met with, who are inclined to attack those very\r\nprivileges, which they find it impossible to turn to their own account.\r\n\r\nI do not, then, assert that _all_ the members of the legal profession\r\nare at _all_ times the friends of order and the opponents of innovation,\r\nbut merely that most of them usually are so. In a community in which\r\nlawyers are allowed to occupy, without opposition, that high station\r\nwhich naturally belongs to them, their general spirit will be eminently\r\nconservative and anti-democratic. When an aristocracy excludes the\r\nleaders of that profession from its ranks, it excites enemies which\r\nare the more formidable to its security as they are independent of the\r\nnobility by their industrious pursuits; and they feel themselves to be\r\nits equal in point of intelligence, although they enjoy less opulence\r\nand less power. But whenever an aristocracy consents to impart some of\r\nits privileges to these same individuals, the two classes coalesce very\r\nreadily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a single order of\r\nfamily interests.\r\n\r\nI am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch will always\r\nbe able to convert legal practitioners into the most serviceable\r\ninstruments of his authority. There is a far greater affinity between\r\nthis class of individuals and the executive power, than there is between\r\nthem and the people; just as there is a greater natural affinity between\r\nthe nobles and monarch, than between the nobles and the people, although\r\nthe higher orders of society have occasionally resisted the prerogative\r\nof the crown in concert with the lower classes.\r\n\r\nLawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration,\r\nand the best security of public order is authority. It must not be\r\nforgotten, that if they prize the free institutions of their country\r\nmuch, they nevertheless value the legality of those institutions far\r\nmore; they are less afraid of tyranny than of arbitrary power: and\r\nprovided that the legislature takes upon itself to deprive men of their\r\nindependence, they are not dissatisfied.[189]\r\n\r\nI am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence of an\r\nencroaching democracy, should endeavor to impair the judicial authority\r\nin his dominions, and to diminish the political influence of lawyers,\r\nwould commit a great mistake. He would let slip the substance\r\nof authority to grasp at the shadow. He would act more wisely in\r\nintroducing men connected with the law into the government; and if he\r\nintrusted them with the conduct of a despotic power, bearing some marks\r\nof violence, that power would most likely assume the external features\r\nof justice and of legality in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe government of democracy is favorable to the political power of\r\nlawyers; for when the wealthy, the noble, and the prince, are excluded\r\nfrom the government, they are sure to occupy the highest stations in\r\ntheir own right, as it were, since they are the only men of information\r\nand sagacity, beyond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of\r\nthe popular choice. If, then, they are led by their tastes to combine\r\nwith the aristocracy, and to support the crown, they are naturally\r\nbrought into contact with the people by their interests. They like the\r\ngovernment of democracy, without participating in its propensities, and\r\nwithout imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold authority\r\nfrom it and over it. The people in democratic states does not mistrust\r\nthe members of the legal profession, because it is well known that they\r\nare interested in serving the popular cause; and it listens to them\r\nwithout irritation, because it does not attribute to them any sinister\r\ndesigns. The object of lawyers is not, indeed, to overthrow the\r\ninstitutions of democracy, but they constantly endeavor to give it an\r\nimpulse which diverts it from its real tendency, by means which are\r\nforeign to its nature. Lawyers belong to the people by birth and\r\ninterest, to the aristocracy by habit and by taste, and they may be\r\nlooked upon as the natural bond and connecting link of the two great\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\nThe profession of the law is the only aristocratic element which can be\r\namalgamated without violence with the natural elements of democracy, and\r\nwhich can be advantageously and permanently combined with them. I am\r\nnot unacquainted with the defects which are inherent in the character\r\nof that body of men; but without this admixture of lawyer-like\r\nsobriety with the democratic principle, I question whether democratic\r\ninstitutions could long be maintained; and I cannot believe that a\r\nrepublic could subsist at the present time, if the influence of lawyers\r\nin public business did not increase in proportion to the power of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal\r\nprofession, is much more distinctly marked in the United States and in\r\nEngland than in any other country. This proceeds not only from the legal\r\nstudies of the English and American lawyers, but from the nature of the\r\nlegislation, and the position which those persons occupy, in the two\r\ncountries. The English and the Americans have retained the law of\r\nprecedents; that is to say, they continue to found their legal opinions\r\nand the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and decisions of\r\ntheir forefathers. In the mind of an English or an American lawyer, a\r\ntaste and a reverence for what is old are almost always united to a love\r\nof regular and lawful proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis predisposition has another effect upon the character of the legal\r\nprofession and upon the general course of society. The English and\r\nAmerican lawyers investigate what has been done; the French advocate\r\ninquires what should have been done: the former produces precedents;\r\nthe latter reasons. A French observer is surprised to hear how often an\r\nEnglish or American lawyer quotes the opinions of others, and how little\r\nhe alludes to his own; while the reverse occurs in France. There, the\r\nmost trifling litigation is never conducted without the introduction\r\nof an entire system of ideas peculiar to the counsel employed; and the\r\nfundamental principles of law are discussed in order to obtain a\r\nperch of land by the decision of the court. This abnegation of his own\r\nopinion, and this implicit deference to the opinion of his forefathers,\r\nwhich are common to the English and American lawyer, this subjection of\r\nthought which he is obliged to profess, necessarily give him more timid\r\nhabits and more sluggish inclinations in England and America than in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe French codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be\r\nread by every one; nothing, on the other hand, can be more impenetrable\r\nto the uninitiated than a legislation founded upon precedents. The\r\nindispensable want of legal assistance which is felt in England and in\r\nthe United States, and the high opinion which is generally entertained\r\nof the ability of the legal profession, tend to separate it more and\r\nmore from the people, and to place it in a distinct class. The French\r\nlawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his\r\ncountry; but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants of\r\nEgypt, for, like them, he is the sole interpreter of an occult science.\r\n\r\n[The remark that English and American lawyers found their opinions and\r\ntheir decisions upon those of their forefathers, is calculated to excite\r\nsurprise in an American reader, who supposes that law, as a prescribed\r\nrule of action, can only be ascertained in cases where the statutes are\r\nsilent, by reference to the decisions of courts. On the continent, and\r\nparticularly in France, as the writer of this note learned from the\r\nconversation of M. De Tocqueville, the judicial tribunals do not\r\ndeem themselves bound by any precedents, or by any decisions of their\r\npredecessors or of the appellate tribunals. They respect such decisions\r\nas the opinions of distinguished men, and they pay no higher regard to\r\ntheir own previous adjudications of any case. It is not easy to perceive\r\nhow the law can acquire any stability under such a system, or how any\r\nindividual can ascertain his rights, without a lawsuit. This note should\r\nnot be concluded without a single remark upon what the author calls an\r\nimplicit deference to the opinions of our forefathers, and abnegation of\r\nour own opinions. The common law consists of principles founded on the\r\ncommon sense of mankind, and adapted to the circumstances of man in\r\ncivilized society. When these principles are once settled by competent\r\nauthority, or rather _declared_ by such authority, they are supposed to\r\nexpress the common sense and the common justice of the community; and\r\nit requires but a moderate share of modesty for any one entertaining\r\na different view of them, to consider that the disinterested and\r\nintelligent judges who have declared them, are more likely to be right\r\nthan he is. Perfection, even in the law, he does not consider attainable\r\nby human beings, and the greatest approximation to it is all he expects\r\nor desires. Besides, there are very few cases of positive and abstract\r\nrule, where it is of any consequence which, of any two or more\r\nmodifications of it, should be adopted. The great point is, that there\r\nshould be _a rule_ by which conduct may be regulated. Thus, whether\r\nin mercantile transactions notice of a default by a principal shall be\r\ngiven to an endorser, or a guarantor, and when and how such notice shall\r\nbe given, are not so important in themselves, as it is that there\r\nshould be some rule to which merchants may adapt themselves and their\r\ntransactions. Statutes cannot or at least do not, prescribe the rules in\r\na large majority of cases. If then they are not drawn from the decision\r\nof courts, they will not exist, and men will be wholly at a loss for\r\na guide in the most important transactions of business. Hence the\r\ndeference paid to legal decisions. But this is not implicit, as the\r\nauthor supposes. The course of reasoning by which the courts have come\r\nto their conclusions, is often assailed by the advocate and shown to be\r\nfallacious, and the instances are not unfrequent of courts disregarding\r\nprior decisions and overruling them when not fairly deducible from sound\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nAgain, the principles of the common law are flexible, and adapt\r\nthemselves to changes in society, and a well-known maxim in our system,\r\nthat when the reason of the law ceases, the law itself ceases, has\r\noverthrown many an antiquated rule. Within these limits, it is conceived\r\nthat there is range enough for the exercise of all the reason of the\r\nadvocate and the judge, without unsettling everything and depriving the\r\nconduct of human affairs of all guidance from human authority;--and the\r\ntalent of our lawyers and courts finds sufficient exercise in applying\r\nthe principles of one case to facts of another.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nThe station which lawyers occupy in England and America exercises no\r\nless an influence upon their habits and their opinions. The English\r\naristocracy, which has taken care to attract to its sphere whatever is\r\nat all analogous to itself, has conferred a high degree of importance\r\nand of authority upon the members of the legal profession. In English\r\nsociety lawyers do not occupy the first rank, but they are contented\r\nwith the station assigned to them; they constitute, as it were, the\r\nyounger branch of the English aristocracy, and they are attached to\r\ntheir elder brothers, although they do not enjoy all their privileges.\r\nThe English lawyers consequently mingle the tastes and the ideas of the\r\naristocratic circles in which they move, with the aristocratic interest\r\nof their profession.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the lawyer-like character which I am endeavoring to depict,\r\nis most distinctly to be met with in England: there laws are esteemed\r\nnot so much because they are good, as because they are old; and if it be\r\nnecessary to modify them in any respect, or to adapt them to the\r\nchanges which time operates in society, recourse is had to the most\r\ninconceivable contrivances in order to uphold the traditionary fabric,\r\nand to maintain that nothing has been done which does not square with\r\nthe intentions, and complete the labors, of former generations. The\r\nvery individuals who conduct these changes disclaim all intention of\r\ninnovation, and they had rather resort to absurd expedients than plead\r\nguilty of so great a crime. This spirit more especially appertains to\r\nthe English lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what\r\nthey treat, and they direct all their attention to the letter, seeming\r\ninclined to infringe the rules of common sense and of humanity, rather\r\nthan to swerve one tittle from the law. The English legislation may be\r\ncompared to the stock of an old tree, upon which lawyers have engrafted\r\nthe most various shoots, with the hope, that, although their fruits may\r\ndiffer, their foliage at least will be confounded with the venerable\r\ntrunk which supports them all.\r\n\r\nIn America there are no nobles or literary men, and the people is apt\r\nto mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political\r\nclass, and the most cultivated circle of society. They have therefore\r\nnothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to\r\ntheir natural taste for public order. If I were asked where I place the\r\nAmerican aristocracy, I should reply without hesitation, that it is not\r\ncomposed of the rich, who are united together by no common tie, but that\r\nit occupies the judicial bench and the bar.\r\n\r\nThe more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States, the\r\nmore shall we be persuaded that the lawyers, as a body, form the most\r\npowerful, if not the only counterpoise to the democratic element. In\r\nthat country we perceive how eminently the legal profession is qualified\r\nby its powers, and even by its defects, to neutralize the vices\r\nwhich are inherent in popular government. When the American people is\r\nintoxicated by passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of its ideas,\r\nit is checked and stopped by the almost invisible influence of its legal\r\ncounsellors, who secretly oppose their aristocratic propensities to its\r\ndemocratic instincts, their superstitious attachment to what is antique\r\nto its love of novelty, their narrow views to its immense designs, and\r\ntheir habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience.\r\n\r\nThe courts of justice are the most visible organs by which the legal\r\nprofession is enabled to control the democracy. The judge is a lawyer,\r\nwho, independently of the taste for regularity and order which he has\r\ncontracted in the study of legislation, derives an additional love of\r\nstability from his own inalienable functions. His legal attainments have\r\nalready raised him to a distinguished rank among his fellow-citizens;\r\nhis political power completes the distinction of his station, and gives\r\nhim the inclinations natural to privileged classes.\r\n\r\nArmed with the power of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional,[190]\r\nthe American magistrate perpetually interferes in political affairs. He\r\ncannot force the people to make laws, but at least he can oblige it not\r\nto disobey its own enactments, or to act inconsistently with its own\r\nprinciples. I am aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial\r\npower exists in the United States; and by most of the constitutions\r\nof the several states, the government can, upon the demand of the two\r\nhouses of the legislature, remove the judges from their station. By some\r\nother constitutions the members of the tribunals are elected, and they\r\nare even subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict\r\nthat these innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal\r\nconsequences; and that it will be found out at some future period,\r\nthat the attack which is made upon the judicial power has affected the\r\ndemocratic republic itself.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which I have\r\nbeen speaking has been confined in the United States to the courts of\r\njustice; it extends far beyond them. As the lawyers constitute the only\r\nenlightened class which the people does not mistrust, they are naturally\r\ncalled upon to occupy most of the public stations. They fill the\r\nlegislative assemblies, and they conduct the administration; they\r\nconsequently exercise a powerful influence upon the formation of the\r\nlaw, and upon its execution. The lawyers are, however, obliged to yield\r\nto the current of public opinion, which is too strong for them to resist\r\nit; but it is easy to find indications of what their conduct would be,\r\nif they were free to act as they chose. The Americans who have made such\r\ncopious innovations in their political legislation, have introduced very\r\nsparing alterations in their civil laws, and that with great difficulty,\r\nalthough those laws are frequently repugnant to their social condition.\r\nThe reason of this is, that in matters of civil law the majority is\r\nobliged to defer to the authority of the legal profession, and that the\r\nAmerican lawyers are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their\r\nown choice.\r\n\r\nIt is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very different state of\r\nthings, to hear the perpetual complaints which are made in the United\r\nStates, against the stationary propensities of legal men, and their\r\nprejudices in favor of existing institutions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the legal habits which are common in America extends\r\nbeyond the limits I have just pointed out. Scarcely any question arises\r\nin the United States which does not become, sooner or later, a subject\r\nof judicial debate; hence all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas,\r\nand even the language, usual in judicial proceedings, in their\r\ndaily controversies. As most public men are, or have been, legal\r\npractitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their\r\nprofession into the affairs of the country. The jury extends this\r\nhabitude to all classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in some\r\nmeasure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the law, which is produced in\r\nthe schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their\r\nwalls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest\r\nclasses, so that the whole people contracts the habits and the tastes of\r\nthe magistrate. The lawyers of the United States form a party which is\r\nbut little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge peculiar to\r\nitself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to the exigencies\r\nof the time, and accommodates itself to all the movements of the social\r\nbody: but this party extends over the whole community, and it penetrates\r\ninto all classes of society; it acts upon the country imperceptibly, but\r\nit finally fashions it to suit its purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY JURY IN THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERED AS A POLITICAL\r\nINSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nTrial by Jury, which is one of the Instruments of the Sovereignty of the\r\nPeople, deserves to be compared with the other Laws which establish that\r\nsovereignty.--Composition of the Jury in the United States.--Effect of\r\nTrial by Jury upon the national Character.--It educates the People.--It\r\ntends to establish the Authority of the Magistrates, and to extend a\r\nknowledge of Law among the People.\r\n\r\nSince I have been led by my subject to recur to the administration of\r\njustice in the United States, I will not pass over this point without\r\nadverting to the institution of the jury. Trial by jury may be\r\nconsidered in two separate points of view: as a judicial, and as a\r\npolitical institution. If it entered into my present purpose to inquire\r\nhow far trial by jury (more especially in civil cases) contributes to\r\nensure the best administration of justice, I admit that its utility\r\nmight be contested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when\r\nsociety was in an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice were\r\nmerely called upon to decide on the evidence of facts, it is not an easy\r\ntask to adapt it to the wants of a highly civilized community, when the\r\nmutual relations of men are multiplied to a surprising extent, and have\r\nassumed the enlightened and intellectual character of the age.[191]\r\n\r\nMy present object is to consider the jury as a political institution;\r\nand any other course would divert me from my subject. Of trial by jury,\r\nconsidered as a judicial institution, I shall here say but very few\r\nwords. When the English adopted trial by jury they were a semi-barbarous\r\npeople; they are become, in course of time, one of the most enlightened\r\nnations of the earth; and their attachment to this institution seems\r\nto have increased with their increasing cultivation. They soon spread\r\nbeyond their insular boundaries to every corner of the habitable globe;\r\nsome have formed colonies, others independent states; the mother-country\r\nhas maintained its monarchical constitution; many of its offspring have\r\nfounded powerful republics; but wherever the English have been,\r\nthey have boasted of the privilege of trial by jury.[192] They\r\nhave established it, or hastened to re-establish it, in all their\r\nsettlements. A judicial institution which obtains the suffrages of a\r\ngreat people for so long a series of ages, which is zealously renewed at\r\nevery epoch of civilisation, in all the climates of the earth, and under\r\nevery form of human government, cannot be contrary to the spirit of\r\njustice.[193]\r\n\r\nI turn, however, from this part of the subject. To look upon the jury\r\nas a mere judicial institution, is to confine our attention to a very\r\nnarrow view of it; for, however great its influence may be upon the\r\ndecisions of the law-courts, that influence is very subordinate to the\r\npowerful effects which it produces on the destinies of the community\r\nat large. The jury is above all a political institution, and it must be\r\nregarded in this light in order to be duly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBy the jury, I mean a certain number of citizens chosen\r\nindiscriminately, and invested with a temporary right of judging.\r\nTrial by jury, as applied to the repression of crime, appears to me to\r\nintroduce an eminently republican element into the government, upon the\r\nfollowing grounds:--\r\n\r\nThe institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic, according\r\nto the class of society from which the jurors are selected; but it\r\nalways preserves its republican character, inasmuch as it places the\r\nreal direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion\r\nof the governed, instead of leaving it under the authority of the\r\ngovernment. Force is never more than a transient element of success; and\r\nafter force comes the notion of right. A government which should only\r\nbe able to crush its enemies upon a field of battle, would very soon be\r\ndestroyed. The true sanction of political laws is to be found in penal\r\nlegislation, and if that sanction be wanting, the law will sooner\r\nor later lose its cogency. He who punishes infractions of the law is\r\ntherefore the real master of society. Now, the institution of the jury\r\nraises the people itself, or at least a class of citizens, to the bench\r\nof judicial authority. The institution of the jury consequently\r\ninvests the people, or that class of citizens, with the direction of\r\nsociety.[194]\r\n\r\nIn England the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of the\r\nnation,[195] the aristocracy makes the laws, applies the laws, and\r\npunishes all infractions of the laws; everything is established upon a\r\nconsistent footing, and England may with truth be said to constitute an\r\naristocratic republic. In the United States the same system is applied\r\nto the whole people. Every American citizen is qualified to be an\r\nelector, a juror, and is eligible to office.[196] The system of the\r\njury, as it is understood in America, appears to me to be as direct and\r\nas extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people, as universal\r\nsuffrage. These institutions are two instruments of equal power, which\r\ncontribute to the supremacy of the majority. All the sovereigns who have\r\nchosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society instead\r\nof obeying its direction, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution of\r\nthe jury. The monarchs of the house of Tudor sent to prison jurors\r\nwho refused to convict, and Napoleon caused them to be returned by his\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nHowever clear most of these truths may seem to be, they do not command\r\nuniversal assent, and in France, at least, the institution of trial by\r\njury is still very imperfectly understood. If the question arise as to\r\nthe proper qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion of\r\nthe intelligence and knowledge of the citizens who may be returned, as\r\nif the jury was merely a judicial institution. This appears to me to\r\nbe the least part of the subject. The jury is pre-eminently a political\r\ninstitution; it must be regarded as one form of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it must be rejected; or it\r\nmust be adapted to the laws by which that sovereignty is established.\r\nThe jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution of the\r\nlaws is intrusted, as the houses of parliament constitute that part\r\nof the nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be\r\ngoverned with consistency and uniformity, the list of citizens qualified\r\nto serve on juries must increase and diminish with the list of electors.\r\nThis I hold to be the point of view must worthy of the attention of the\r\nlegislator; and all that remains is merely accessary.\r\n\r\nI am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political\r\ninstitution, that I still consider it in this light when it is applied\r\nin civil causes. Laws are always unstable unless they are founded upon\r\nthe manners of a nation: manners are the only durable and resisting\r\npower in a people. When the jury is reserved for criminal offences, the\r\npeople only sees its occasional action in certain particular cases;\r\nthe ordinary course of life goes on without its interference, and it\r\nis considered as an instrument, but not as the only instrument, of\r\nobtaining justice. This is true _a fortiori_ when the jury is only\r\napplied to certain criminal causes.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil\r\ncauses, its application is constantly palpable; it affects all the\r\ninterests of the community; every one co-operates in its work: it thus\r\npenetrates into all the usages of life, it fashions the human mind to\r\nits peculiar forms, and is gradually associated with the idea of justice\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the jury, if confined to criminal causes, is always\r\nin danger; but when once it is introduced into civil proceedings, it\r\ndefies the aggressions of time and of man. If it had been as easy to\r\nremove the jury from the manners as from the laws of England, it would\r\nhave perished under Henry VIII. and Elizabeth: and the civil jury did in\r\nreality, at that period, save the liberties of the country. In whatever\r\nmanner the jury be applied, it cannot fail to exercise a powerful\r\ninfluence upon the national character; but this influence is\r\nprodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes. The\r\njury, and more especially the civil jury, serves to communicate the\r\nspirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit,\r\nwith the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for free\r\ninstitutions. It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing judged,\r\nand with the notion of right. If these two elements be removed, the love\r\nof independence is reduced to a more destructive passion. It teaches men\r\nto practise equity; every man learns to judge his neighbor as he would\r\nhimself be judged: and this is especially true of the jury in civil\r\ncauses; for, while the number of persons who have reason to apprehend\r\na criminal prosecution is small, every one is liable to have a civil\r\naction brought against him. The jury teaches every man not to recoil\r\nbefore the responsibility of his own actions, and impresses him with\r\nthat manly confidence without which political virtue cannot exist. It\r\ninvests each citizen with a kind of magistracy; it makes them all feel\r\nthe duties which they are bound to discharge toward society; and the\r\npart which they take in the government. By obliging men to turn their\r\nattention to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it rubs off\r\nthat individual egotism which is the rust of society.\r\n\r\nThe jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgment, and to\r\nincrease the natural intelligence of a people; and this is, in my\r\nopinion, its greatest advantage. It may be regarded as a gratuitous\r\npublic school ever open, in which every juror learns to exercise his\r\nrights, enters into daily communication with the most learned and\r\nenlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes practically\r\nacquainted with the laws of his country, which are brought within the\r\nreach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the\r\njudge, and even by the passions of the parties. I think that the\r\npractical intelligence and political good sense of the Americans are\r\nmainly attributable to the long use which they have made of the jury in\r\ncivil causes.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the jury is useful to those who are in litigation;\r\nbut I am certain it is highly beneficial to those who decide the\r\nlitigation: and I look upon it as one of the most efficacious means for\r\nthe education of the people, which society can employ.\r\n\r\nWhat I have hitherto said, applies to all nations; but the remark I\r\nam now about to make, is peculiar to the Americans and to democratic\r\npeoples. I have already observed that in democracies the members of the\r\nlegal profession, and the magistrates, constitute the only aristocratic\r\nbody which can check the irregularities of the people. This aristocracy\r\nis invested with no physical power; but it exercises its conservative\r\ninfluence upon the minds of men: and the most abundant source of its\r\nauthority is the institution of the civil jury. In criminal causes, when\r\nsociety is armed against a single individual, the jury is apt to\r\nlook upon the judge as the passive instrument of social power, and to\r\nmistrust his advice. Moreover, criminal causes are entirely founded upon\r\nthe evidence of facts which common sense can readily appreciate; upon\r\nthis ground the judge and the jury are equal. Such, however, is not the\r\ncase in civil causes; then the judge appears as a disinterested arbiter\r\nbetween the conflicting passions of the parties. The jurors look up\r\nto him with confidence, and listen to him with respect, for in this\r\ninstance their intelligence is completely under the control of his\r\nlearning. It is the judge who sums up the various arguments with which\r\ntheir memory has been wearied out, and who guides them through the\r\ndevious course of the proceedings; he points their attention to the\r\nexact question of fact, which they are called upon to solve, and he puts\r\nthe answer to the question of law into their mouths. His influence upon\r\ntheir verdict is almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nIf I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved by the\r\narguments derived from the ignorance of jurors in civil causes, I reply,\r\nthat in these proceedings, whenever the question to be solved is not\r\na mere question of fact, the jury has only the semblance of a judicial\r\nbody. The jury sanctions the decisions of the judge; they, by the\r\nauthority of society which they represent, and he, by that of reason and\r\nof law.[197]\r\n\r\nIn England and in America the judges exercise an influence upon criminal\r\ntrials which the French judges have never possessed. The reason of\r\nthis difference may easily be discovered; the English and American\r\nmagistrates establish their authority in civil causes, and only transfer\r\nit afterward to tribunals of another kind, where that authority was\r\nnot acquired. In some cases (and they are frequently the most important\r\nones), the American judges have the right of deciding causes alone.[198]\r\nUpon these occasions they are, accidentally, placed in the position\r\nwhich the French judges habitually occupy: but they are still surrounded\r\nby the reminiscence of the jury, and their judgment has almost as much\r\nauthority as the voice of the community at large, represented by that\r\ninstitution. Their influence extends beyond the limits of the courts;\r\nin the recreations of private life, as well as in the turmoil of public\r\nbusiness, abroad and in the legislative assemblies, the American\r\njudge is constantly surrounded by men who are accustomed to regard his\r\nintelligence as superior to their own; and after having exercised his\r\npower in the decision of causes, he continues to influence the habits\r\nof thought, and the character of the individuals who took a part in his\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n[The remark in the text, that \"in some cases, and they are frequently\r\nthe most important ones, the American judges have the right of deciding\r\ncauses alone,\" and the author's note, that \"the federal judges decide,\r\nupon their own authority, almost all the questions most important to the\r\ncountry,\" seem to require explanation in consequence of their connexion\r\nwith the context in which the author is speaking of the trial by jury.\r\nThey seem to imply that there are some cases which ought to be tried by\r\njury, that are decided by the judges. It is believed that the learned\r\nauthor, although a distinguished advocate in France, never thoroughly\r\ncomprehended the grand divisions of our complicated system of law, in\r\ncivil cases. _First_, is the distinction between cases in equity and\r\nthose in which the rules of the common law govern.--Those in equity\r\nare always decided by the judge or judges, who _may_, however, send\r\nquestions of fact to be tried in the common law courts by a jury. But as\r\na general rule this is entirely in the discretion of the equity judge.\r\n_Second_, in cases at common law, there are questions of fact and\r\nquestions of law:--the former are invariably tried by a jury, the\r\nlatter, whether presented in the course of a jury trial, or by pleading,\r\nin which the facts are admitted, are always decided by the judges.\r\n\r\n_Third_, cases of admiralty jurisdiction, and proceedings _in rem_ of an\r\nanalogous nature, are decided by the judges without the intervention\r\nof a jury. The cases in this last class fall within the peculiar\r\njurisdiction of the federal courts, and, with this exception, the\r\nfederal judges do not decide upon their own authority any questions,\r\nwhich, if presented in the state courts, would not also be decided by\r\nthe judges of those courts. The supreme court of the United States, from\r\nthe nature of its institution as almost wholly an appellant court, is\r\ncalled on to decide merely questions of law, and in no case can that\r\ncourt decide a question of fact, unless it arises in suits peculiar to\r\nequity or admiralty jurisdiction. Indeed the author's original note is\r\nmore correct than the translation. It is as follows: \"Les juges fédéraux\r\ntranchent presque toujours seuls les questions qui touchent de plus près\r\nau _gouvernement_ du pays.\" And it is very true that the supreme court\r\nof the United States, in particular, decides those questions which most\r\nnearly affect the _government_ of the country, because those are the\r\nvery questions which arise upon the constitutionality of the laws\r\nof congress and of the several states, the final and conclusive\r\ndetermination of which is vested in that tribunal.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nThe jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magistracy, does\r\nin reality consolidate its power; and in no country are the judges so\r\npowerful as there where the people partakes their privileges. It is\r\nmore especially by means of the jury in civil causes that the American\r\nmagistrates imbue all classes of society with the spirit of their\r\nprofession. Thus the jury, which is the most energetic means of making\r\nthe people rule, is also the most efficacious means of teaching it to\r\nrule well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[189] This translation does not accurately convey the meaning of M. de\r\nTocqueville's expression. He says: \"Ils craignent moins la tyrannie que\r\nl'arbitraire, et pourvu que le législateur se charge lui-même d'enlever\r\naux hommes leur indépendance, ils sont à peu près content.\"\r\n\r\nThe more correct rendering would be: 'They fear tyranny less than\r\narbitrary sway, and provided it is the legislator himself who\r\nundertakes to deprive men of their independence, they are almost\r\ncontent.'--_Reviser_.\r\n\r\n[190] See chapter vi., p. 94, on the judicial power in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[191] The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial institution, and\r\nthe appreciation of its effects in the United States, together with the\r\nadvantages the Americans have derived from it, would suffice to form a\r\nbook, and a book upon a very useful and curious subject. The state of\r\nLouisiana would in particular afford the curious phenomenon of a French\r\nand English legislation, as well as a French and English population,\r\nwhich are generally combining with each other. See the \"Digeste des Lois\r\nde la Louisiane,\" in two volumes; and the \"Traité sur les Regles des\r\nActions civiles,\" printed in French and English at New Orleans in 1830.\r\n\r\n[192] All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon this head.\r\nMr. Story, judge of the supreme court of the United States, speaks, in\r\nhis treatise on the federal constitution, of the advantages of trial by\r\njury in civil cases: \"The inestimable privilege of a trial by jury in\r\ncivil cases--a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases,\r\nwhich is counted by all persons to be essential to political and civil\r\nliberty\" ... (Story, book iii, ch. xxxviii.).\r\n\r\n[193] If it were our province to point out the utility of the jury as\r\na judicial institution in this place, much might be said, and the\r\nfollowing arguments might be brought forward among others:--\r\n\r\nBy introducing the jury into the business of the courts, you are enabled\r\nto diminish the number of judges; which is a very great advantage. When\r\njudges are very numerous, death is perpetually thinning the ranks of\r\nthe judicial functionaries, and laying places vacant for new comers. The\r\nambition of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they\r\nare naturally made dependant upon the will of the majority, or the\r\nindividual who fills up vacant appointments: the officers of the courts\r\nthen rise like the officers of an army. This state of things is entirely\r\ncontrary to the sound administration of justice, and to the intentions\r\nof the legislator. The office of a judge is made inalienable in order\r\nthat he may remain independent; but of what advantage is it that his\r\nindependence is protected, if he be tempted to sacrifice it of his own\r\naccord? When judges are very numerous, many of them must necessarily be\r\nincapable of performing their important duties; for a great magistrate\r\nis a man of no common powers; and I am inclined to believe that a half\r\nenlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments for obtaining those\r\nobjects which it is the purpose of courts of justice to accomplish.\r\nFor my own part, I had rather submit the decision of a case to ignorant\r\njurors directed by a skilfull judge, than to judges, a majority of whom\r\nare imperfectly acquainted with jurisprudence and with the laws.\r\n\r\n[I venture to remind the reader, lest this note should appear somewhat\r\nredundant to an English eye, that the jury is an institution which has\r\nonly been naturalized in France within the present century; that it is\r\neven now exclusively applied to those criminal causes which come before\r\nthe courts of assize, or to the prosecutions of the public press; and\r\nthat the judges and counsellors of the numerous local tribunals of\r\nFrance--forming a body of many thousand judicial functionaries--try all\r\ncivil causes, appeals from criminal causes, and minor offences, without\r\nthe jury.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[194] An important remark must however be made. Trial by jury does\r\nunquestionably invest the people with a general control over the actions\r\nof citizens, but it does not furnish means of exercising this control in\r\nall cases, or with an absolute authority. When an absolute monarch has\r\nthe right of trying offences by his representatives, the fate of the\r\nprisoner is, as it were, decided beforehand. But even if the people were\r\npredisposed to convict, the composition and the non-responsibility of\r\nthe jury would still afford some chances favorable to the protection of\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\n[195] In France, the qualification of the jurors is the same as the\r\nelectoral qualification, namely, the payment of 200 francs per annum in\r\ndirect taxes: they are chosen by lot. In England they are returned by\r\nthe sheriff; the qualifications of jurors were raised to 10_l_ per annum\r\nin England, and 6_l_ in Wales, of freehold land or copyhold, by the\r\nstatute W. and M., c. 24: leaseholders for a time determinable upon life\r\nor lives, of the clear yearly value of 20_l_ per annum over and above\r\nthe rent reserved, are qualified to serve on juries; and jurors in\r\nthe courts of Westminster and city of London must be householders,\r\nand possessed of real and personal estates of the value of 100_l_.\r\nThe qualifications, however, prescribed in different statutes,\r\nvary according to the object for which the jury is impannelled. See\r\nBlackstone's Commentaries, b. iii., c. 23.--_Translator's Note_.\r\n\r\n[196] See Appendix Q.\r\n\r\n[197] See Appendix R.\r\n\r\n[198] The federal judges decide upon their own authority almost all the\r\nquestions most important to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CAUSES WHICH TEND TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA democratic republic subsists in the United States; and the principal\r\nobject of this book has been to account for the fact of its existence.\r\nSeveral of the causes which contribute to maintain the institutions of\r\nAmerica have been voluntarily passed by, or only hinted at, as I was\r\nborne along by my subject. Others I have been unable to discuss and\r\nthose on which I have dwelt most, are, as it were, buried in the details\r\nof the former part of this work.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, that before I proceed to speak of the future, I\r\ncannot do better than collect within a small compass the reasons which\r\nbest explain the present. In this retrospective chapter I shall be\r\nsuccinct; for I shall take care to remind the reader very summarily of\r\nwhat he already knows; and I shall only select the most prominent of\r\nthose facts which I have not yet pointed out.\r\n\r\nAll the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic\r\nrepublic in the United States are reducible to three heads:\r\n\r\nI. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence has placed\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nII. The laws.\r\n\r\nIII. The manners and customs of the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL OR PROVIDENTIAL CAUSES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe Union has no Neighbors.--No Metropolis.--The Americans have had the\r\nChances of Birth in their favor.--America an empty country.--How this\r\ncircumstance contributes powerfully to the Maintenance of the democratic\r\nRepublic in America.--How the American Wilds are Peopled.--Avidity of\r\nthe Anglo-Americans in taking Possession of the Solitudes of the New\r\nWorld.--Influence of physical Prosperity upon the political Opinions of\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nA thousand circumstances, independent of the will of man, concur to\r\nfacilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United\r\nStates. Some of these peculiarities are known, the others may easily\r\nbe pointed out; but I shall confine myself to the most prominent among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great\r\nwars, or financial crises, or inroads, or conquests to dread; they\r\nrequire neither great taxes, nor great armies, nor great generals; and\r\nthey have nothing to fear from a scourge which is more formidable to\r\nrepublics than all these evils combined, namely, military glory. It\r\nis impossible to deny the inconceivable influence which military\r\nglory exercises upon the spirit of a nation. General Jackson, whom the\r\nAmericans have twice elected to be the head of their government, is a\r\nman of violent temper and mediocre talents; no one circumstance in the\r\nwhole course of his career ever proved that he is qualified to govern a\r\nfree people; and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes of\r\nthe Union has always been opposed to him. But he was raised to the\r\npresidency, and has been maintained in that lofty station, solely by the\r\nrecollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the\r\nwalls of New Orleans; a victory which was, however, a very ordinary\r\nachievement, and which could only be remembered in a country where\r\nbattles are rare. Now the people who are thus carried away by the\r\nillusions of glory, are unquestionably the most cold and calculating,\r\nthe most unmilitary (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic\r\nof all the peoples of the earth.\r\n\r\nAmerica has no great capital city,[199] whose influence is directly or\r\nindirectly felt over the whole extent of the country, which I hold to be\r\none of the first causes of the maintenance of republican institutions\r\nin the United States. In cities, men cannot be prevented from concerting\r\ntogether, and from awakening a mutual excitement which prompts\r\nsudden and passionate resolutions. Cities may be looked upon as large\r\nassemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members; their populace\r\nexercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and frequently\r\nexecutes its own wishes without their intervention.\r\n\r\nTo subject the provinces to the metropolis, is therefore not only\r\nto place the destiny of the empire in the hands of a portion of the\r\ncommunity, which may be reprobated as unjust, but to place it in the\r\nhands of a populace acting under its own impulses, which must be avoided\r\nas dangerous. The preponderance of capital cities is therefore a serious\r\nblow upon the representative system; and it exposes modern republics to\r\nthe same defect as the republics of antiquity, which all perished from\r\nnot being acquainted with that system.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for me to adduce a great number of secondary causes\r\nwhich have contributed to establish, and which concur to maintain, the\r\ndemocratic republic of the United States. But I discern two principal\r\ncircumstances among these favorable elements, which I hasten to point\r\nout. I have already observed that the origin of the American settlements\r\nmay be looked upon as the first and most efficacious cause to which the\r\npresent prosperity of the United States may be attributed. The Americans\r\nhad the chances of birth in their favor; and their forefathers imported\r\nthat equality of conditions into the country, whence the democratic\r\nrepublic has very naturally taken its rise. Nor was this all they did;\r\nfor besides this republican condition of society, the early settlers\r\nbequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners, and opinions,\r\nwhich contribute most to the success of a republican form of government.\r\nWhen I reflect upon the consequences of this primary circumstance,\r\nmethinks I see the destiny of America embodied in the first puritan who\r\nlanded on those shores, just as the human race was represented by the\r\nfirst man.\r\n\r\nThe chief circumstance which has favored the establishment and the\r\nmaintenance of a democratic republic in the United States, is the nature\r\nof the territory which the Americans inhabit. Their ancestors gave them\r\nthe love of equality and of freedom: but God himself gave them the means\r\nof remaining equal and free, by placing them upon a boundless continent,\r\nwhich is open to their exertions. General prosperity is favorable to\r\nthe stability of all governments, but more particularly of a democratic\r\nconstitution, which depends upon the disposition of the majority, and\r\nmore particularly of that portion of the community which is most exposed\r\nto feel the pressure of want. When the people rules, it must be rendered\r\nhappy, or it will overturn the state: and misery is apt to stimulate it\r\nto those excesses to which ambition rouses kings. The physical causes,\r\nindependent of the laws, which contribute to promote general prosperity,\r\nare more numerous in America than they have ever been in any other\r\ncountry in the world, at any other period of history. In the United\r\nStates, not only is legislation democratic, but nature herself favors\r\nthe cause of the people.\r\n\r\nIn what part of human tradition can be found anything at all similar to\r\nthat which is occurring under our eyes in North America? The celebrated\r\ncommunities of antiquity were all founded in the midst of hostile\r\nnations, which they were obliged to subjugate before they could flourish\r\nin their place. Even the moderns have found, in some parts of South\r\nAmerica, vast regions inhabited by a people of inferior civilisation,\r\nbut which occupied and cultivated the soil. To found their new states,\r\nit was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous population, until\r\ncivilisation has been made to blush for their success. But North America\r\nwas only inhabited by wandering tribes, who took no thought of the\r\nnatural riches of the soil: and that vast country was still, properly\r\nspeaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nEverything is extraordinary in America, the social condition of\r\nthe inhabitants, as well as the laws; but the soil upon which these\r\ninstitutions are founded is more extraordinary than all the rest. When\r\nman was first placed upon the earth by the Creator, that earth was\r\ninexhaustible in its youth; but man was weak and ignorant: and when he\r\nhad learned to explore the treasures which it contained, hosts of his\r\nfellow-creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to earn an\r\nasylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that same period\r\nNorth America was discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by the\r\nDeity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of the deluge.\r\n\r\nThat continent still presents, as it did in the primeval time, rivers\r\nwhich rise from never-failing sources, green and moist solitudes, and\r\nfields which the ploughshare of the husbandman has never turned. In this\r\nstate it is offered to man, not in the barbarous and isolated condition\r\nof the early ages, but to a being who is already in possession of\r\nthe most potent secrets of the natural world, who is united to his\r\nfellow-men, and instructed by the experience of fifty centuries. At\r\nthis very time thirteen millions of civilized Europeans are peaceably\r\nspreading over those fertile plains, with whose resources and whose\r\nextent they are not yet accurately acquainted. Three or four thousand\r\nsoldiers drive the wandering races of the aborigines before them; these\r\nare followed by the pioneers, who pierce the woods, scare off the beasts\r\nof prey, explore the courses of the inland streams, and make ready the\r\ntriumphal procession of civilisation across the waste.\r\n\r\nThe favorable influence of the temporal prosperity of America upon the\r\ninstitutions of that country has been so often described by others,\r\nand adverted to by myself, that I shall not enlarge upon it beyond the\r\naddition of a few facts. An erroneous notion is generally entertained,\r\nthat the deserts of America are peopled by European emigrants, who\r\nannually disembark upon the coasts of the New World, while the American\r\npopulation increases and multiplies upon the soil which its forefathers\r\ntilled. The European settler, however, usually arrives in the United\r\nStates without friends, and sometimes without resources; in order to\r\nsubsist he is obliged to work for hire, and he rarely proceeds beyond\r\nthat belt of industrious population which adjoins the ocean. The desert\r\ncannot be explored without capital or credit, and the body must be\r\naccustomed to the rigors of a new climate before it can be exposed to\r\nthe chances of forest life. It is the Americans themselves who daily\r\nquit the spots which gave them birth, to acquire extensive domains in\r\na remote country. Thus the European leaves his country for the\r\ntransatlantic shores; and the American, who is born on that very coast,\r\nplunges into the wilds of central America. This double emigration is\r\nincessant: it begins in the remotest parts of Europe, it crosses the\r\nAtlantic ocean, and it advances over the solitudes of the New World.\r\nMillions of men are marching at once toward the same horizon; their\r\nlanguage, their religion, their manners differ, their object is the\r\nsame. The gifts of fortune are promised in the west, and to the west\r\nthey bend their course.\r\n\r\nNo event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human race,\r\nexcept perhaps those irruptions which preceded the fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire. Then, as well as now, generations of men were impelled forward\r\nin the same direction to meet and struggle on the same spot; but the\r\ndesigns of Providence were not the same; then, every new comer was the\r\nharbinger of destruction and of death; now, every adventurer brings with\r\nhim the elements of prosperity and of life. The future still conceals\r\nfrom us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of the American\r\ntoward the west; but we can hardly apprehend its more immediate results.\r\nAs a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the states in which\r\nthey were born, the population of these states increases very slowly,\r\nalthough they have long been established: thus in Connecticut, which\r\nonly contains 59 inhabitants to the square mile, the population has not\r\nbeen increased by more than one quarter in forty years, while that of\r\nEngland has been augmented by one third in the lapse of the same period.\r\nThe European emigrant always lands, therefore, in a country which is but\r\nhalf full, and where hands are in request: he becomes a workman in easy\r\ncircumstances; his son goes to seek his fortune in unpeopled regions,\r\nand he becomes a rich landowner. The former amasses the capital\r\nwhich the latter invests, and the stranger as well as the native is\r\nunacquainted with want.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the United States are extremely favorable to the division\r\nof property; but a cause which is more powerful than the laws prevents\r\nproperty from being divided to excess.[200] This is very perceptible in\r\nthe states which are beginning to be thickly peopled; Massachusetts is\r\nthe most populous part of the Union, but it contains only 80 inhabitants\r\nto the square mile, which is much less than in France, where 162 are\r\nreckoned to the same extent of country. But in Massachusetts estates are\r\nvery rarely divided; the eldest son takes the land, and the others go\r\nto seek their fortune in the desert. The law has abolished the right of\r\nprimogeniture, but circumstances have concurred to re-establish it\r\nunder a form of which none can complain, and by which no just rights are\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nA single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals\r\nwho leave New England, in this manner, to settle themselves in the\r\nwilds. We were assured in 1830, that thirty-six of the members of\r\ncongress were born in the little state of Connecticut. The population of\r\nConnecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of\r\nthe United States, thus furnished one-eighth of the whole body of\r\nrepresentatives. The state of Connecticut, however, only sends five\r\ndelegates to congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the new western\r\nstates. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in Connecticut,\r\nit is probable that instead of becoming rich landowners they would\r\nhave remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity\r\nwithout being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becoming\r\nuseful members of the legislature, they might have been unruly citizens.\r\n\r\nThese reflections do not escape the observation of the Americans any\r\nmore than of ourselves. \"It cannot be doubted,\" says Chancellor Kent in\r\nhis Treatise on American Law, \"that the division of landed estates must\r\nproduce great evils when it is carried to such excess that each parcel\r\nof land is insufficient to support a family; but these disadvantages\r\nhave never been felt in the United States, and many generations must\r\nelapse before they can be felt. The extent of our inhabited territory,\r\nthe abundance of adjacent land, and the continual stream of emigration\r\nflowing from the shores of the Atlantic toward the interior of\r\nthe country, suffice as yet, and will long suffice, to prevent the\r\nparcelling out of estates.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the American rushes\r\nforward to secure the immense booty which fortune proffers to him.\r\nIn the pursuit he fearlessly braves the arrow of the Indian and the\r\ndistempers of the forest; he is unimpressed by the silence of the woods;\r\nthe approach of beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is goaded\r\nonward by a passion more intense than the love of life. Before him lies\r\na boundless continent, and he urges onward as if time pressed, and he\r\nwas afraid of finding no room for his exertions. I have spoken of the\r\nemigration from the older states, but how shall I describe that which\r\ntakes place from the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed\r\nsince that of Ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants were\r\nnot born within its confines; its capital has only been built thirty\r\nyears, and its territory is still covered by an immense extent of\r\nuncultivated fields; nevertheless, the population of Ohio is already\r\nproceeding westward, and most of the settlers who descend to the fertile\r\nsavannahs of Illinois are citizens of Ohio. These men left their first\r\ncountry to improve their condition; they quit their resting-place to\r\nmeliorate it still more; fortune awaits them everywhere, but happiness\r\nthey cannot attain. The desire of prosperity has become an ardent and\r\nrestless passion in their minds, which grows by what it gains. They\r\nearly broke the ties which bound them to their natal earth, and they\r\nhave contracted no fresh ones on their way. Emigration was at first\r\nnecessary to them as a means of subsistence; and it soon becomes a sort\r\nof game of chance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites, as\r\nmuch as for the gain it procures.\r\n\r\nSometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears\r\nbehind him. The woods stoop to give him a passage, and spring up again\r\nwhen he has passed. It is not uncommon in crossing the new states of\r\nthe west to meet with deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the\r\ntraveller frequently discovers the vestiges of a log-house in the most\r\nsolitary retreats, which bear witness to the power, and no less to the\r\ninconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields, and over those ruins of\r\na day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh vegetation; the beasts\r\nresume the haunts which were once their own; and nature covers the\r\ntraces of man's path with branches and with flowers, which obliterate\r\nhis evanescent track.\r\n\r\nI remember that in crossing one of the woodland districts which still\r\ncover the state of New York, I reached the shore of a lake, which was\r\nembosomed with forests coeval with the world. A small island, covered\r\nwith woods, whose thick foliage concealed its banks, rose from the\r\ncentre of the waters. Upon the shores of the lake no object attested\r\nthe presence of man, except a column of smoke which might be seen on the\r\nhorizon rising from the tops of the trees to the clouds, and seeming\r\nto hang from heaven rather than to be mounting to the sky. An Indian\r\nshallop was hauled up on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet\r\nthat had at first attracted my attention, and in a few minutes I set\r\nfoot upon its banks. The whole island formed one of those delicious\r\nsolitudes of the New World, which almost lead civilized man to regret\r\nthe haunts of the savage. A luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the\r\nincomparable fruitfulness of the soil. The deep silence, which is common\r\nto the wilds of North America, was only broken by the hoarse cooing\r\nof the wood-pigeon and the tapping of the woodpecker upon the bark of\r\ntrees. I was far from supposing that this spot had ever been inhabited,\r\nso completely did nature seem to be left to her own caprices; but when\r\nI reached the centre of the isle I thought that I discovered some traces\r\nof man. I then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with care,\r\nand I soon perceived that an European had undoubtedly been led to seek a\r\nrefuge in this retreat. Yet what changes had taken place in the scene of\r\nhis labors! The logs which he had hastily hewn to build himself a\r\nshed had sprouted afresh; the very props were intertwined with living\r\nverdure, and his cabin was transformed into a bower. In the midst of\r\nthese shrubs a few stones were to be seen, blackened with fire and\r\nsprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no doubt been, and the\r\nchimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. I stood for some time in\r\nsilent admiration of the exuberance of nature and the littleness of man;\r\nand when I was obliged to leave that enchanting solitude, I exclaimed\r\nwith melancholy, \"Are ruins, then, already here?\"\r\n\r\nIn Europe we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded\r\ndesire of riches, and an excessive love of independence, as propensities\r\nvery formidable to society. Yet these are the very elements which ensure\r\na long and peaceful duration to the republics of America. Without these\r\nunquiet passions the population would collect in certain spots, and\r\nwould soon be subject to wants like those of the Old World, which it is\r\ndifficult to satisfy; for such is the present good fortune of the New\r\nWorld, that the vices of its inhabitants are scarcely less favorable\r\nto society than their virtues. These circumstances exercise a great\r\ninfluence on the estimation in which human actions are held in the two\r\nhemispheres. The Americans frequently term what we should call cupidity\r\na laudable industry; and they blame as faint-heartedness what we\r\nconsider to be the virtue of moderate desires.\r\n\r\nIn France simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the\r\nattachment which men feel to the place of their birth, are looked upon\r\nas great guarantees of the tranquillity and happiness of the state. But\r\nin America nothing seems to be more prejudicial to society than these\r\nvirtues. The French Canadians, who have faithfully preserved the\r\ntraditions of their pristine manners, are already embarrassed for room\r\nupon their small territory; and this little community, which has so\r\nrecently begun to exist, will shortly be a prey to the calamities\r\nincident to old nations. In Canada the most enlightened, patriotic,\r\nand humane inhabitants, make extraordinary efforts to render the people\r\ndissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content it. There\r\nthe seductions of wealth are vaunted with as much zeal, as the charms\r\nof an honest but limited income in the Old World: and more exertions\r\nare made to excite the passions of the citizens there than to calm them\r\nelsewhere. If we listen to the eulogies, we shall hear that nothing is\r\nmore praiseworthy than to exchange the pure and homely pleasures which\r\neven the poor man tastes in his own country, for the dull delights of\r\nprosperity under a foreign sky; to leave the patrimonial hearth, and\r\nthe turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in short, to abandon the\r\nliving and the dead in quest of fortune.\r\n\r\nAt the present time America presents a field for human effort, far more\r\nextensive than any sum of labor which can be applied to work it. In\r\nAmerica, too much knowledge cannot be diffused; for all knowledge, while\r\nit may serve him who possesses it, turns also to the advantage of those\r\nwho are without it. New wants are not to be feared, since they can be\r\nsatisfied without difficulty; the growth of human passions need not be\r\ndreaded, since all passions may find an easy and a legitimate object:\r\nnor can men be put in possession of too much freedom, since they are\r\nscarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties.\r\n\r\nThe American republics of the present day are like companies of\r\nadventurers, formed to explore in common the waste lands of the New\r\nWorld, and busied in a flourishing trade. The passions which agitate\r\nthe Americans most deeply, are not their political, but their commercial\r\npassions; or, to speak more correctly, they introduce the habits they\r\ncontract in business into their political life. They love order, without\r\nwhich affairs do not prosper; and they set an especial value upon a\r\nregular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid business; they\r\nprefer the good sense which amasses large fortunes, to that enterprising\r\nspirit which frequently dissipates them; general ideas alarm their\r\nminds, which are accustomed to positive calculations; and they hold\r\npractice in more honor than theory.\r\n\r\nIt is in America that one learns to understand the influence which\r\nphysical prosperity exercises over political actions, and even over\r\nopinions which ought to acknowledge no sway but that of reason; and it\r\nis more especially among strangers that this truth is perceptible. Most\r\nof the European emigrants to the New World carry with them that wild\r\nlove of independence and of change, which our calamities are apt to\r\nengender. I sometimes met with Europeans, in the United States, who had\r\nbeen obliged to leave their own country on account of their political\r\nopinions. They all astonished me by the language they held; but one of\r\nthem surprised me more than all the rest. As I was crossing one of the\r\nmost remote districts of Pennsylvania, I was benighted, and obliged\r\nto beg for hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who was a\r\nFrenchman by birth. He bade me sit down beside his fire, and we began to\r\ntalk with that freedom which befits persons who meet in the backwoods,\r\ntwo thousand leagues from their native country. I was aware that my host\r\nhad been a great leveller and an ardent demagogue, forty years ago,\r\nand that his name was not unknown to fame. I was therefore not a little\r\nsurprised to hear him discuss the rights of property as an economist or\r\na landowner might have done: he spoke of the necessary gradations which\r\nfortune established among men, of obedience to established laws, of\r\nthe influence of good morals in commonwealths, and of the support which\r\nreligious opinions give to order and to freedom; he even went so far\r\nas to quote an evangelical authority in corroboration of one of his\r\npolitical tenets.\r\n\r\nI listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of human reason. A\r\nproposition is true or false, but no art can prove it to be one or the\r\nother, in the midst of the uncertainties of science and the conflicting\r\nlessons of experience, until a new incident disperses the clouds of\r\ndoubt; I was poor, I become rich; and I am not to expect that prosperity\r\nwill act upon my conduct, and leave my judgment free: my opinions\r\nchange with my fortune, and the happy circumstances which I turn to\r\nmy advantage, furnish me with that decisive argument which was before\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n[The sentence beginning \"I was poor, I become rich,\" &c, struck the\r\neditor, on perusal, as obscure, if not contradictory. The original seems\r\nmore explicit, and justice to the author seems to require that it should\r\nbe presented to the reader. \"J'étais pauvre, me voici riche; du moins,\r\nsi le bien-être, en agissant sur ma conduite, laissait mon jugement en\r\nliberté! Mais non, mes opinions sont en effet changées avec ma fortune,\r\net, dans l'événement heureux dont je profite, j'ai réellement découvert\r\nla raison déterminante qui jusque-là m'avait manqué.\"--_American\r\nEditor_.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of prosperity acts still more freely upon the American\r\nthan upon strangers. The American has always seen the connexion of\r\npublic order and public prosperity, intimately united as they are, go on\r\nbefore his eyes; he does not conceive that one can subsist without the\r\nother; he has therefore nothing to forget: nor has he, like so many\r\nEuropeans, to unlearn the lessons of his early education.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE LAWS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThree principal Causes of the Maintenance of the democratic\r\nRepublic.--Federal Constitutions.--Municipal Institutions.--Judicial\r\nPower.\r\n\r\nThe principal aim of this book has been to make known the laws of the\r\nUnited States; if this purpose has been accomplished, the reader is\r\nalready enabled to judge for himself which are the laws that really tend\r\nto maintain the democratic republic, and which endanger its existence.\r\nIf I have not succeeded in explaining this in the whole course of my\r\nwork, I cannot hope to do so within the limits of a single chapter. It\r\nis not my intention to retrace the path I have already pursued; and\r\na very few lines will suffice to recapitulate what I have previously\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThree circumstances seem to me to contribute most powerfully to the\r\nmaintenance of the democratic republic in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first is that federal form of government which the Americans have\r\nadopted, and which enables the Union to combine the power of a great\r\nempire with the security of a small state;--\r\n\r\nThe second consists in those municipal institutions which limit the\r\ndespotism of the majority, and at the same time impart a taste for\r\nfreedom, and a knowledge of the art of being free, to the people;--\r\n\r\nThe third is to be met with in the constitution of the judicial power.\r\nI have shown in what manner the courts of justice serve to repress the\r\nexcesses of democracy; and how they check and direct the impulses of the\r\nmajority, without stopping its activity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF MANNERS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nI have previously remarked that the manners of the people may be\r\nconsidered as one of the general causes to which the maintenance of a\r\ndemocratic republic in the United States is attributable. I here use the\r\nword _manners_, with the meaning which the ancients attached to the word\r\n_mores_; for I apply it not only to manners, in their proper sense of\r\nwhat constitutes the character of social intercourse, but I extend it to\r\nthe various notions and opinions current among men, and to the mass\r\nof those ideas which constitute their character of mind. I comprise,\r\ntherefore, under this term the whole moral and intellectual condition of\r\na people. My intention is not to draw a picture of American manners,\r\nbut simply to point out such features of them as are favorable to the\r\nmaintenance of political institutions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRELIGION CONSIDERED AS A POLITICAL INSTITUTION, WHICH POWERFULLY\r\nCONTRIBUTES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC AMONG THE\r\nAMERICANS.\r\n\r\nNorth America peopled by Men who professed a democratic and republican\r\nChristianity.--Arrival of the Catholics.--For what Reason the Catholics\r\nform the most democratic and the most republican Class at the present\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nEvery religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political opinion,\r\nwhich is connected with it by affinity. If the human mind be left\r\nto follow its own bent, it will regulate the temporal and spiritual\r\ninstitutions of society upon one uniform principle; and man will\r\nendeavor, if I may use the expression, to harmonize the state in which\r\nhe lives upon earth, with the state he believes to await him in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of British America was peopled by men who, after\r\nhaving shaken off the authority of the pope, acknowledged no other\r\nreligious supremacy: they brought with them into the New World a form\r\nof Christianity, which I cannot better describe, than by styling it a\r\ndemocratic and republican religion. This sect contributed powerfully to\r\nthe establishment of a democracy and a republic; and from the earliest\r\nsettlement of the emigrants, politics and religion contracted an\r\nalliance which has never been dissolved.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a catholic population into\r\nthe United States; on the other hand, the catholics of America made\r\nproselytes, and at the present moment more than a million of Christians,\r\nprofessing the truths of the church of Rome, are to be met with in\r\nthe Union. These catholics are faithful to the observances of their\r\nreligion; they are fervent and zealous in the support and belief of\r\ntheir doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the most republican and\r\nthe most democratic class of citizens which exists in the United States;\r\nand although this fact may surprise the observer at first, the cause by\r\nwhich it is occasioned may easily be discovered upon reflection.\r\n\r\nI think that the catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as\r\nthe natural enemy of democracy. Among the various sects of Christians,\r\ncatholicism seems to me, on the contrary, to be one of those which are\r\nmost favorable to the equality of conditions. In the catholic church,\r\nthe religious community is composed of only two elements; the priest and\r\nthe people. The priest alone rises above the rank of his flock, and all\r\nbelow him are equal.\r\n\r\nOn doctrinal points the catholic faith places all human capacities upon\r\nthe same level; it subjects the wise and the ignorant, the man of genius\r\nand the vulgar crowd, to the details of the same creed; it imposes\r\nthe same observances upon the rich and needy, it inflicts the same\r\nausterities upon the strong and the weak, it listens to no compromises\r\nwith mortal man, but reducing all the human race to the same standard,\r\nit confounds all the distinctions of society at the foot of the same\r\naltar, even as they are confounded in the sight of God. If catholicism\r\npredisposes the faithful to obedience, it certainly does not prepare\r\nthem for inequality; but the contrary may be said of protestantism,\r\nwhich generally tends to make men independent, more than to render them\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nCatholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign be removed,\r\nall the other classes of society are more equal than they are in\r\nrepublics. It has not unfrequently occurred that the catholic priest\r\nhas left the service of the altar to mix with the governing powers of\r\nsociety, and to make his place among the civil gradations of men. This\r\nreligious influence has sometimes been used to secure the interests\r\nof that political state of things to which he belonged. At other times\r\ncatholics have taken the side of aristocracy from a spirit of religion.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the government,\r\nas is the case in the United States, than it is found that no class\r\nof men are more naturally disposed than the catholics to transfuse the\r\ndoctrine of the equality of conditions into the political world. If,\r\nthen, the catholic citizens of the United States are not forcibly led\r\nby the nature of their tenets to adopt democratic and republican\r\nprinciples, at least they are not necessarily opposed to them; and their\r\nsocial position, as well as their limited number, obliges them to adopt\r\nthese opinions. Most of the catholics are poor, and they have no\r\nchance of taking a part in the government unless it be open to all the\r\ncitizens. They constitute a minority, and all rights must be respected\r\nin order to ensure to them the free exercise of their own privileges.\r\nThese two causes induce them, unconsciously, to adopt political\r\ndoctrines which they would perhaps support with less zeal if they were\r\nrich and preponderant.\r\n\r\nThe catholic clergy of the United States has never attempted to oppose\r\nthis political tendency; but it seeks rather to justify its results. The\r\npriests in America have divided the intellectual world into two parts:\r\nin the one they place the doctrines of revealed religion, which command\r\ntheir assent; in the other they leave those truths, which they believe\r\nto have been freely left open to the researches of political inquiry.\r\nThus the catholics of the United States are at the same time the most\r\nfaithful believers and the most zealous citizens.\r\n\r\nIt may be asserted that in the United States no religious doctrine\r\ndisplays the slightest hostility to democratic and republican\r\ninstitutions. The clergy of all the different sects holds the same\r\nlanguage; their opinions are consonant to the laws, and the human\r\nintellect flows onward in one sole current.\r\n\r\nI happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the Union, when\r\nI was invited to attend a public meeting which had been called for the\r\npurpose of assisting the Poles, and of sending them supplies of arms and\r\nmoney. I found two or three thousand persons collected in a vast hall\r\nwhich had been prepared to receive them. In a short time a priest in\r\nhis ecclesiastical robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the\r\nspectators rose, and stood uncovered, while he spoke in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n\"Almighty God! the God of armies! Thou who didst strengthen the hearts\r\nand guide the arms of our fathers when they were fighting for the sacred\r\nrights of national independence; thou who didst make them triumph over\r\na hateful oppression, and hast granted to our people the benefits\r\nof liberty and peace; turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the other\r\nhemisphere; pitifully look down upon that heroic nation which is even\r\nnow struggling as we did in the former time, and for the same rights\r\nwhich we defended with our blood. Thou, who didst create man in the\r\nlikeness of the same image, let no tyranny mar thy work, and establish\r\ninequality upon the earth. Almighty God! do thou watch over the destiny\r\nof the Poles, and render them worthy to be free. May thy wisdom direct\r\ntheir councils, and may thy strength sustain their arms! Shed forth thy\r\nterror over their enemies; scatter the powers which take counsel against\r\nthem; and vouchsafe that the injustice which the world has beheld for\r\nfifty years, be not consummated in our time. O Lord, who holdest alike\r\nthe hearts of nations and of men in thy powerful hand, raise up allies\r\nto the sacred cause of right; arouse the French nation from the apathy\r\nin which its rulers retain it, that it go forth again to fight for the\r\nliberties of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, turn not thou thy face from us, and grant that we may always be\r\nthe most religious as well as the freest people of the earth. Almighty\r\nGod, hear our supplications this day. Save the Poles, we beseech thee,\r\nin the name of thy well beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died\r\nupon the cross for the salvation of men. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole meeting responded \"Amen!\" with devotion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDIRECT INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS OPINIONS UPON POLITICAL SOCIETY IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nChristian Morality common to all Sects.--Influence of Religion upon the\r\nManners of the Americans.--Respect for the marriage Tie.--In what\r\nmanner Religion confines the Imagination of the Americans within certain\r\nLimits, and checks the Passion of Innovation.--Opinion of the Americans\r\non the political Utility of Religion.--Their Exertions to extend and\r\nsecure its Predominance.\r\n\r\nI have just shown what the direct influence of religion upon politics\r\nis in the United States; but its indirect influence appears to me to be\r\nstill more considerable, and it never instructs the Americans more fully\r\nin the art of being free than when it says nothing of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe sects which exist in the United States are innumerable. They all\r\ndiffer in respect to the worship which is due from man to his Creator;\r\nbut they all agree in respect to the duties which are due from man to\r\nman. Each sect adores the Deity in its own peculiar manner; but all\r\nthe sects preach the same moral law in the name of God. If it be of the\r\nslightest importance to man, as an individual, that his religion should\r\nbe true, the case of society is not the same. Society has no future life\r\nto hope for or to fear; and provided the citizens profess a religion,\r\nthe peculiar tenets of that religion are of very little importance to\r\nits interests. Moreover, almost all the sects of the United States are\r\ncomprised within the great unity of christianity, and Christian morality\r\nis everywhere the same.\r\n\r\nIt may be believed without unfairness, that a certain number of\r\nAmericans pursue a peculiar form of worship, from habit more than from\r\nconviction. In the United States the sovereign authority is religious,\r\nand consequently hypocrisy must be common; but there is no country\r\nin the whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater\r\ninfluence over the souls of men than in America; and there can be no\r\ngreater proof of its utility, and of its conformity to human nature,\r\nthan that its influence is most powerfully felt over the most\r\nenlightened and free nation of the earth.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the members of the American clergy in general,\r\nwithout even excepting those who do not admit religious liberty, are\r\nall in favor of civil freedom; but they do not support any particular\r\npolitical system. They keep aloof from parties, and from public affairs.\r\nIn the United States religion exercises but little influence upon the\r\nlaws, and upon the details of public opinion; but it directs the manners\r\nof the community, and by regulating domestic life, it regulates the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nI do not question that the great austerity of manners which is\r\nobservable in the United States, arises, in the first instance, from\r\nreligious faith. Religion is often unable to restrain man from the\r\nnumberless temptations of fortune; nor can it check that passion for\r\ngain which every incident of his life contributes to arouse; but\r\nits influence over the mind of women is supreme, and women are the\r\nprotectors of morals. There is certainly no country in the world\r\nwhere the tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or where\r\nconjugal happiness is more highly or worthily appreciated. In Europe\r\nalmost all the disturbances of society arise from the irregularities of\r\ndomestic life. To despise the natural bonds and legitimate pleasures of\r\nhome, is to contract a taste for excesses, a restlessness of heart, and\r\nthe evil of fluctuating desires. Agitated by the tumultuous passions\r\nwhich frequently disturb his dwelling, the European is galled by the\r\nobedience which the legislative powers of the state exact. But when the\r\nAmerican retires from the turmoil of public life to the bosom of his\r\nfamily, he finds in it the image of order and of peace. There his\r\npleasures are simple and natural, his joys are innocent and calm; and\r\nas he finds that an orderly life is the surest path to happiness, he\r\naccustoms himself without difficulty to moderate his opinions as well as\r\nhis tastes. While the European endeavors to forget his domestic troubles\r\nby agitating society, the American derives from his own home that love\r\nof order, which he afterward carries with him into public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the influence of religion is not confined to the\r\nmanners, but it extends to the intelligence of the people. Among\r\nthe Anglo-Americans, there are some who profess the doctrines of\r\nChristianity from a sincere belief in them, and others who do the same\r\nbecause they are afraid to be suspected of unbelief. Christianity,\r\ntherefore, reigns without any obstacle, by universal consent; the\r\nconsequence is, as I have before observed, that every principle of the\r\nmoral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is\r\nabandoned to the debates and the experiments of men. Thus the human mind\r\nis never left to wander across a boundless field; and, whatever may be\r\nits pretensions, it is checked from time to time by barriers which it\r\ncannot surmount. Before it can perpetrate innovation, certain primal and\r\nimmutable principles are laid down, and the boldest conceptions of\r\nhuman device are subjected to certain forms which retard and stop their\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of the Americans, even in its greatest flights, is\r\ncircumspect and undecided; its impulses are checked, and its works\r\nunfinished. These habits of restraint recur in political society, and\r\nare singularly favorable both to the tranquillity of the people and\r\nthe durability of the institutions it has established. Nature and\r\ncircumstances concurred to make the inhabitants of the United States\r\nbold men, as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit with\r\nwhich they seek for fortune. If the minds of the Americans were free\r\nfrom all trammels, they would very shortly become the most daring\r\ninnovators and the most implacable disputants in the world. But the\r\nrevolutionists of America are obliged to profess an ostensible respect\r\nfor Christian morality and equity, which does not easily permit them to\r\nviolate the laws that oppose their designs; nor would they find it easy\r\nto surmount the scruples of their partisans, even if they were able to\r\nget over their own. Hitherto no one, in the United States, has dared\r\nto advance the maxim, that everything is permissible with a view to\r\nthe interests of society; an impious adage, which seems to have been\r\ninvented in an age of freedom, to shelter all the tyrants of future\r\nages. Thus while the law permits the Americans to do what they please,\r\nreligion prevents them from conceiving, and forbids them to commit, what\r\nis rash and unjust.\r\n\r\nReligion in America takes no direct part in the government of society,\r\nbut it must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political\r\ninstitutions of that country; for if it does not impart a taste for\r\nfreedom, it facilitates the use of free institutions. Indeed, it is\r\nin this same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States\r\nthemselves look upon religious belief. I do not know whether all the\r\nAmericans have a sincere faith in their religion; for who can search the\r\nhuman heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable to\r\nthe maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is not peculiar\r\nto a class of citizens or to a party, but it belongs to the whole\r\nnation, and to every rank of society.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, if a political character attacks a sect, this may\r\nnot prevent even the partisans of that very sect, from supporting him;\r\nbut if he attacks all the sects together, every one abandons him, and he\r\nremains alone.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in America, a witness, who happened to be called at the\r\nassizes of the county of Chester (state of New York), declared that he\r\ndid not believe in the existence of God or in the immortality of the\r\nsoul. The judge refused to admit his evidence, on the ground that the\r\nwitness had destroyed beforehand all the confidence of the court in what\r\nhe was about to say.[201] The newspapers related the fact without any\r\nfarther comment.\r\n\r\nThe Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so\r\nintimately in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive\r\nthe one without the other; and with them this conviction does not spring\r\nfrom that barren traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul\r\nrather than to live.\r\n\r\nI have known of societies formed by the Americans to send out ministers\r\nof the gospel into the new western states, to found schools and churches\r\nthere, lest religion should be suffered to die away in those remote\r\nsettlements, and the rising states be less fitted to enjoy free\r\ninstitutions than the people from which they emanated. I met with\r\nwealthy New Englanders who abandoned the country in which they were\r\nborn, in order to lay the foundations of Christianity and of freedom on\r\nthe banks of the Missouri or in the prairies of Illinois. Thus religious\r\nzeal is perpetually stimulated in the United States by the duties of\r\npatriotism. These men do not act from an exclusive consideration of the\r\npromises of a future life; eternity is only one motive of their devotion\r\nto the cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of Christian\r\ncivilisation, you will be surprised to find how much value they set upon\r\nthe goods of this world, and that you meet with a politician where you\r\nexpected to find a priest. They will tell you that \"all the American\r\nrepublics are collectively involved with each other; if the republics of\r\nthe west were to fall into anarchy, or to be mastered by a despot,\r\nthe republican institutions which now flourish upon the shores of the\r\nAtlantic ocean would be in great peril. It is therefore our interest\r\nthat the new states should be religious, in order to maintain our\r\nliberties.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the opinions of the Americans; and if any hold that the\r\nreligious spirit which I admire is the very thing most amiss in America,\r\nand that the only element wanting to the freedom and happiness of the\r\nhuman race is to believe in some blind cosmogony, or to assert with\r\nCabanis the secretion of thought by the brain, I can only reply, that\r\nthose who hold this language have never been in America, and that they\r\nhave never seen a religious or a free nation. When they return from\r\ntheir expedition, we shall hear what they have to say.\r\n\r\nThere are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as\r\na temporary means of power, of wealth and distinction; men who are\r\nthe _condottieri_ of liberty, and who fight for their own advantage,\r\nwhatever be the colors they wear: it is not to these that I address\r\nmyself. But there are others who look forward to the republican form of\r\ngovernment as a tranquil and lasting state, toward which modern\r\nsociety is daily impelled by the ideas and manners of the time, and\r\nwho sincerely desire to prepare men to be free. When these men attack\r\nreligious opinions, they obey the dictates of their passions to the\r\nprejudice of their interests. Despotism may govern without faith, but\r\nliberty cannot. Religion is much more necessary in the republic which\r\nthey set forth in glowing colors, than in the monarchy which they\r\nattack; and it is more needed in democratic republics than in any\r\nothers. How is it possible that society should escape destruction if\r\nthe moral tie be not strengthened in proportion as the political tie is\r\nrelaxed? and what can be done with a people which is its own master, if\r\nit be not submissive to the Divinity?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CAUSES WHICH RENDER RELIGION POWERFUL IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nCare taken by the Americans to separate the Church from the State.--The\r\nLaws, public Opinion, and even the Exertions of the Clergy concur to\r\npromote this end.--Influence of Religion upon the Mind, in the United\r\nStates, attributable to this Cause.--Reason of this.--What is the\r\nnatural State of Men with regard to Religion at the present time.--What\r\nare the peculiar and incidental Causes which prevent Men, in certain\r\nCountries, from arriving at this State.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay\r\nof religious faith in a very simple manner. Religious zeal, said they,\r\nmust necessarily fail, the more generally liberty is established and\r\nknowledge diffused. Unfortunately, facts are by no means in accordance\r\nwith their theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose\r\nunbelief is only equalled by their ignorance and their debasement, while\r\nin America one of the freest and most enlightened nations in the world\r\nfulfils all the outward duties of religion with fervor.\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the\r\ncountry was the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer I\r\nstayed there, the more did I perceive the great political consequences\r\nresulting from this state of things, to which I was unaccustomed. In\r\nFrance I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit\r\nof freedom pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in\r\nAmerica I found that they were intimately united, and that they reigned\r\nin common over the same country. My desire to discover the causes of\r\nthis phenomenon increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it, I\r\nquestioned the members of all the different sects; and I more especially\r\nsought the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries of the\r\ndifferent persuasions, and who are more especially interested in\r\ntheir duration. As a member of the Roman catholic church I was more\r\nparticularly brought into contact with several of its priests, with\r\nwhom I became intimately acquainted. To each of these men I expressed my\r\nastonishment and I explained my doubts: I found that they differed upon\r\nmatters of detail alone; and that they mainly attributed the peaceable\r\ndominion of religion in their country, to the separation of church and\r\nstate. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America, I did\r\nnot meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of the laity, who\r\nwas not of the same opinion upon this point.\r\n\r\nThis led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done, the\r\nstation which the American clergy occupy in political society. I learned\r\nwith surprise that they fill no public appointments;[202] not one of\r\nthem is to be met with in the administration, and they are not even\r\nrepresented in the legislative assemblies. In several states[203] the\r\nlaw excludes them from political life; public opinion in all. And when\r\nI came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy, I found\r\nthat most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the\r\nexercise of power, and that they made it the pride of their profession\r\nto abstain from politics.\r\n\r\nI heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever\r\npolitical opinions these vices might chance to lurk; but I learned\r\nfrom their discourses that men are not guilty in the eye of God for any\r\nopinions concerning political government, which they may profess with\r\nsincerity, any more than they are for their mistakes in building a house\r\nor in driving a furrow. I perceived that these ministers of the gospel\r\neschewed all parties, with the anxiety attendant upon personal interest.\r\nThese facts convinced me that what I had been told was true; and it\r\nthen became my object to investigate their causes, and to inquire how it\r\nhappened that the real authority of religion was increased by a state\r\nof things which diminished its apparent force: these causes did not long\r\nescape my researches.\r\n\r\nThe short space of threescore years can never content the imagination\r\nof man; nor can the imperfect joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man\r\nalone, of all created beings, displays a natural contempt of existence,\r\nand yet a boundless desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads\r\nannihilation. These different feelings incessantly urge his soul to\r\nthe contemplation of a future state, and religion directs his musings\r\nthither. Religion, then, is simply another form of hope; and it is no\r\nless natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot abandon\r\ntheir religious faith without a kind of aberration of intellect, and\r\na sort of violent distortion of their true natures; but they are\r\ninvincibly brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is an\r\naccident, and faith is the only permanent state of mankind. If we only\r\nconsider religious institutions in a purely human point of view, they\r\nmay be said to derive an inexhaustible element of strength from man\r\nhimself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI am aware that at certain times religion may strengthen this influence,\r\nwhich originates in itself, by the artificial power of the laws, and\r\nby the support of those temporal institutions which direct society.\r\nReligions, intimately united to the governments of the earth, have been\r\nknown to exercise a sovereign authority derived from the twofold source\r\nof terror and of faith; but when a religion contracts an alliance of\r\nthis nature, I do not hesitate to affirm that it commits the same error,\r\nas a man who should sacrifice his future to his present welfare; and\r\nin obtaining a power to which it has no claim, it risks that authority\r\nwhich is rightfully its own. When a religion founds its empire upon the\r\ndesire of immortality which lives in every human heart, it may aspire\r\nto universal dominion: but when it connects itself with a government,\r\nit must necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable to certain\r\nnations. Thus, in forming an alliance with a political power, religion\r\naugments its authority over a few, and forfeits the hope of reigning\r\nover all.\r\n\r\nAs long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the\r\nconsolation of all affliction, it may attract the affections of mankind.\r\nBut if it be mixed up with the bitter passions of the world, it may be\r\nconstrained to defend allies whom its interests, and not the principle\r\nof love, have given to it; or to repel as antagonists men who are still\r\nattached to its own spirit, however opposed they may be to the powers\r\nto which it is allied. The church cannot share the temporal power of the\r\nstate, without being the object of a portion of that animosity which the\r\nlatter excites.\r\n\r\nThe political powers which seem to be most firmly established have\r\nfrequently no better guarantee for their duration, than the opinions of\r\na generation, the interests of the time, or the life of an individual.\r\nA law may modify the social condition which seems to be most fixed and\r\ndeterminate; and with the social condition everything else must change.\r\nThe powers of society are more or less fugitive, like the years which\r\nwe spend upon the earth; they succeed each other with rapidity like the\r\nfleeting cares of life; and no government has ever yet been founded upon\r\nan invariable disposition of the human heart, or upon an imperishable\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAs long as religion is sustained by those feelings, propensities, and\r\npassions, which are found to occur under the same forms at all the\r\ndifferent periods of history, it may defy the efforts of time; or at\r\nleast it can only be destroyed by another religion. But when religion\r\nclings to the interests of the world, it becomes almost as fragile a\r\nthing as the powers of the earth. It is the only one of them all which\r\ncan hope for immortality; but if it be connected with their ephemeral\r\nauthority, it shares their fortunes, and may fall with those transient\r\npassions which supported them for a day. The alliance which religion\r\ncontracts with political powers must needs be onerous to itself; since\r\nit does not require their assistance to live, and by giving them its\r\nassistance it may be exposed to decay.\r\n\r\nThe danger which I have just pointed out always exists, but it is\r\nnot always equally visible. In some ages governments seem to be\r\nimperishable, in others the existence of society appears to be more\r\nprecarious than the life of man. Some constitutions plunge the\r\ncitizens into a lethargic somnolence, and others rouse them to feverish\r\nexcitement. When government appears to be so strong, and laws so stable,\r\nmen do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union of church\r\nand state. When governments display so much inconstancy, the danger is\r\nself-evident, but it is no longer possible to avoid it; to be effectual,\r\nmeasures must be taken to discover its approach.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of society, and\r\nas communities display democratic propensities, it becomes more and more\r\ndangerous to connect religion with political institutions; for the\r\ntime is coming when authority will be bandied from hand to hand, when\r\npolitical theories will succeed each other, and when men, laws and\r\nconstitutions, will disappear or be modified from day to day, and this\r\nnot for a season only, but unceasingly. Agitation and mutability are\r\ninherent in the nature of democratic republics, just as stagnation and\r\ninertness are the law of absolute monarchies.\r\n\r\nIf the Americans, who change the head of the government once in\r\nfour years, who elect new legislators every two years, and renew the\r\nprovincial officers every twelvemonth; if the Americans, who have\r\nabandoned the political world to the attempts of innovators, had not\r\nplaced religion beyond their reach, where could it abide in the ebb and\r\nflow of human opinions? where would that respect which belongs to it\r\nbe paid, amid the struggles of faction? and what would become of its\r\nimmortality in the midst of perpetual decay? The American clergy were\r\nthe first to perceive this truth, and to act in conformity with it. They\r\nsaw that they must renounce their religious influence, if they were to\r\nstrive for political power; and they chose to give up the support of the\r\nstate, rather than to share in its vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nIn America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been at\r\ncertain periods in the history of certain peoples; but its influence\r\nis more lasting. It restricts itself to its own resources, but of those\r\nnone can deprive it: its circle is limited to certain principles, but\r\nthose principles are entirely its own, and under its undisputed control.\r\n\r\nOn every side in Europe we hear voices complaining of the absence of\r\nreligious faith, and inquiring the means of restoring to religion some\r\nremnant of its pristine authority. It seems to me that we must first\r\nattentively consider what ought to be _the natural state_ of men with\r\nregard to religion, at the present time; and when we know what we have\r\nto hope and to fear, we may discern the end to which our efforts ought\r\nto be directed.\r\n\r\nThe two great dangers which threaten the existence of religions are\r\nschism and indifference. In ages of fervent devotion, men sometimes\r\nabandon their religion, but they only shake it off in order to adopt\r\nanother. Their faith changes the objects to which it is directed, but\r\nit suffers no decline. The old religion, then, excites enthusiastic\r\nattachment or bitter enmity in either party; some leave it with anger,\r\nothers cling to it with increased devotedness, and although persuasions\r\ndiffer, irreligion is unknown. Such, however, is not the case when a\r\nreligious belief is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be termed\r\nnegative, since they deny the truth of one religion without affirming\r\nthat of any other. Prodigious revolutions then take place in the human\r\nmind, without the apparent co-operation of the passions of man, and\r\nalmost without his knowledge. Men lose the object of their fondest\r\nhopes, as if through forgetfulness. They are carried away by an\r\nimperceptible current which they have not the courage to stem, but which\r\nthey follow with regret, since it bears them from a faith they love, to\r\na scepticism that plunges them into despair.\r\n\r\nIn ages which answer to this description, men desert their religious\r\nopinions from lukewarmness rather than from dislike; they do not reject\r\nthem, but the sentiments by which they were once fostered disappear. But\r\nif the unbeliever does not admit religion to be true, he still considers\r\nit useful. Regarding religious institutions in a human point of view,\r\nhe acknowledges their influence upon manners and legislation. He admits\r\nthat they may serve to make men live in peace with one another and to\r\nprepare them gently for the hour of death. He regrets the faith which\r\nhe has lost; and as he is deprived of a treasure which he has learned to\r\nestimate at its full value, he scruples to take it from those who still\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who continue to believe, are not afraid\r\nopenly to avow their faith. They look upon those who do not share their\r\npersuasion as more worthy of pity than of opposition; and they are\r\naware, that to acquire the esteem of the unbelieving, they are not\r\nobliged to follow their example. They are hostile to no one in the\r\nworld; and as they do not consider the society in which they live as an\r\narena in which religion is bound to face its thousand deadly foes, they\r\nlove their contemporaries, while they condemn their weaknesses, and\r\nlament their errors.\r\n\r\nAs those who do not believe, conceal their incredulity; and as those who\r\nbelieve, display their faith, public opinion pronounces itself in favor\r\nof religion: love, support, and honor, are bestowed upon it, and it is\r\nonly by searching the human soul, that we can detect the wounds which it\r\nhas received. The mass of mankind, who are never without the feeling\r\nof religion, do not perceive anything at variance with the established\r\nfaith. The instinctive desire of a future life brings the crowd about\r\nthe altar, and opens the hearts of men to the precepts and consolations\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nBut this picture is not applicable to us; for there are men among us\r\nwho have ceased to believe in Christianity, without adopting any other\r\nreligion; others who are in the perplexities of doubt, and who already\r\naffect not to believe; and others, again, who are afraid to avow that\r\nChristian faith which they still cherish in secret.\r\n\r\nAmid these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists, a small number of\r\nbelievers exist, who are ready to brave all obstacles, and to scorn\r\nall dangers in defence of their faith. They have done violence to human\r\nweakness, in order to rise superior to public opinion. Excited by the\r\neffort they have made, they scarcely know where to stop; and as they\r\nknow that the first use which the French made, of independence, was to\r\nattack religion, they look upon their contemporaries with dread, and\r\nthey recoil in alarm from the liberty which their fellow-citizens are\r\nseeking to obtain. As unbelief appears to them to be a novelty, they\r\ncomprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. They are at\r\nwar with their age and country, and they look upon every opinion which\r\nis put forth there as the necessary enemy of the faith.\r\n\r\nSuch is not the natural state of men with regard to religion at the\r\npresent day; and some extraordinary or incidental cause must be at\r\nwork in France, to prevent the human mind from following its original\r\npropensities, and to drive it beyond the limits at which it ought\r\nnaturally to stop.\r\n\r\nI am intimately convinced that this extraordinary and incidental cause\r\nis the close connexion of politics and religion. The unbelievers of\r\nEurope attack the Christians as their political opponents, rather than\r\nas their religious adversaries; they hate the Christian religion as\r\nthe opinion of a party, much more than as an error of belief; and they\r\nreject the clergy less because they are the representatives of the\r\nDivinity, than because they are the allies of authority.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Christianity has been intimately united to the powers of\r\nthe earth. Those powers are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried\r\nunder their ruins. The living body of religion has been bound down to\r\nthe dead corpse of superannuated polity; cut the bonds which restrain\r\nit, and that which is alive will rise once more. I know not what could\r\nrestore the Christian church of Europe to the energy of its earlier\r\ndays; that power belongs to God alone; but it may be the effect of human\r\npolicy to leave the faith in all the full exercise of the strength which\r\nit still retains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW THE INSTRUCTION, THE HABITS, AND THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE\r\nAMERICANS PROMOTE THE SUCCESS OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be understood by the instruction of the American People.--The\r\nhuman Mind is more superficially instructed in the United States than in\r\nEurope.--No one completely uninstructed.--Reason of this Rapidity with\r\nwhich Opinions are diffused even in the uncultivated States of the\r\nWest.--Practical Experience more serviceable to the Americans than\r\nBook-learning.\r\n\r\nI have but little to add to what I have already said, concerning the\r\ninfluence which the instruction and the habits of the Americans exercise\r\nupon the maintenance of their political institutions.\r\n\r\nAmerica has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it\r\npossesses no great historians, and not a single eminent poet. The\r\ninhabitants of that country look upon what are properly styled literary\r\npursuits with a kind of disapprobation; and there are towns of very\r\nsecond rate importance in Europe, in which more literary works are\r\nannually published, than in the twenty-four states of the Union put\r\ntogether. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general ideas; and it\r\ndoes not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics nor manufactures\r\ndirect them to these occupations; and although new laws are perpetually\r\nenacted in the United States, no great writers have hitherto inquired\r\ninto the principles of their legislation. The Americans have lawyers\r\nand commentators, but no jurists; and they furnish examples rather than\r\nlessons to the world. The same observation applies to the mechanical\r\narts. In America, the inventions of Europe are adopted with sagacity;\r\nthey are perfected, and adapted with admirable skill to the wants of\r\nthe country. Manufactures exist, but the science of manufacture is not\r\ncultivated; and they have good workmen, but very few inventors. Fulton\r\nwas obliged to proffer his services to foreign nations for a long time\r\nbefore he was able to devote them to his own country.\r\n\r\n[The remark that in America \"there are very good workmen but very\r\nfew inventors,\" will excite surprise in this country. The inventive\r\ncharacter of Fulton he seems to admit, but would apparently deprive us\r\nof the credit of his name, by the remark that he was obliged to proffer\r\nhis services to foreign nations for a long time. He might have added,\r\nthat those proffers were disregarded and neglected, and that it was\r\nfinally in his own country that he found the aid necessary to put in\r\nexecution his great project. If there be patronage extended by the\r\ncitizens of the United States to any one thing in preference to another,\r\nit is to the results of inventive genius. Surely Franklin, Rittenhouse,\r\nand Perkins, have been heard of by our author; and he must have heard\r\nsomething of that wonderful invention, the cotton-gin of Whitney, and\r\nof the machines for making cards to comb wool. The original machines of\r\nFulton for the application of steam have been constantly improving, so\r\nthat there is scarcely a vestige of them remaining. But to sum up the\r\nwhole in one word, can it be possible that our author did not visit the\r\npatent office at Washington? Whatever may be said of the _utility_ of\r\nnine-tenths of the inventions of which the descriptions and models are\r\nthere deposited, no one who has ever seen that depository, or who has\r\nread a description of its contents, can doubt that they furnish the most\r\nincontestible evidence of extraordinary inventive genius--a genius that\r\nhas excited the astonishment of other European travellers.--_American\r\nEditor_.]\r\n\r\nThe observer who is desirous of forming an opinion on the state of\r\ninstruction among the Anglo-Americans, must consider the same object\r\nfrom two different points of view. If he only singles out the learned,\r\nhe will be astonished to find how rare they are; but if he counts the\r\nignorant, the American people will appear to be the most enlightened\r\ncommunity in the world. The whole population, as I observed in another\r\nplace, is situated between these two extremes.\r\n\r\nIn New England, every citizen receives the elementary notions of human\r\nknowledge; he is moreover taught the doctrines and the evidences of his\r\nreligion, the history of his country, and the leading features of its\r\nconstitution. In the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is\r\nextremely rare to find a man imperfectly acquainted with all these\r\nthings, and a person wholly ignorant of them is a sort of phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWhen I compare the Greek and Roman republics with these American states;\r\nthe manuscript libraries of the former, and their rude population, with\r\nthe innumerable journals and the enlightened people of the latter; when\r\nI remember all the attempts which are made to judge the modern republics\r\nby the assistance of those of antiquity, and to infer what will happen\r\nin our time from what took place two thousand years ago, I am tempted\r\nto burn my books, in order to apply none but novel ideas to so novel a\r\ncondition of society.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of New England must not, however, be applied\r\nindiscriminately to the whole Union: as we advance towards the west or\r\nthe south, the instruction of the people diminishes. In the states which\r\nare adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, a certain number of individuals may\r\nbe found, as in our own countries, who are devoid of the rudiments of\r\ninstruction. But there is not a single district in the United States\r\nsunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple reason; the peoples\r\nof Europe started from the darkness of a barbarous condition to advance\r\ntoward the light of civilisation; their progress has been unequal; some\r\nof them have improved apace, while others have loitered in their course,\r\nand some have stopped, and are still sleeping upon the way.\r\n\r\nSuch has not been the case in the United States. The Anglo-Americans\r\nsettled in a state of civilisation, upon that territory which their\r\ndescendants occupy; they had not to begin to learn, and it was\r\nsufficient not to forget. Now the children of these same Americans are\r\nthe persons who, year by year, transport their dwellings into the wilds:\r\nand with their dwellings their acquired information and their esteem for\r\nknowledge. Education has taught them the utility of instruction, and\r\nhas enabled them to transmit that instruction to their posterity. In the\r\nUnited States society has no infancy, but it is born in man's estate.\r\n\r\nThe Americans never use the word \"peasant,\" because they have no idea of\r\nthe peculiar class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more remote\r\nages, the simplicity of rural life, and the rusticity of the villager,\r\nhave not been preserved among them; and they are alike unacquainted with\r\nthe virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the simple graces of an\r\nearly stage of civilisation. At the extreme borders of the confederate\r\nstates, upon the confines of society and of the wilderness, a population\r\nof bold adventurers have taken up their abode, who pierce the solitudes\r\nof the American woods, and seek a country there, in order to escape that\r\npoverty which awaited them in their native provinces. As soon as the\r\npioneer arrives upon the spot which is to serve him for a retreat,\r\nhe fells a few trees and builds a log-house. Nothing can offer a more\r\nmiserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. The traveller who\r\napproaches one of them toward night-fall, sees the flicker of the\r\nhearth-flame through the chinks in the walls; and at night, if the wind\r\nrises, he hears the roof of boughs shake to and fro in the midst of\r\nthe great forest trees. Who would not suppose that this poor hut is the\r\nasylum of rudeness and ignorance? Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn\r\nbetween the pioneer and the dwelling which shelters him. Everything\r\nabout him is primitive and unformed, but he is himself the result of the\r\nlabor and the experience of eighteen centuries. He wears the dress,\r\nand he speaks the language of cities; he is acquainted with the past,\r\ncurious of the future, and ready for argument upon the present; he is,\r\nin short, a highly civilized being, who consents, for a time, to inhabit\r\nthe back-woods, and who penetrates into the wilds of a New World with\r\nthe Bible, an axe, and a file of newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public\r\nopinion circulates in the midst of these deserts.[204] I do not\r\nthink that so much intellectual intercourse takes place in the most\r\nenlightened and populous districts of France.[205] It cannot be doubted\r\nthat in the United States, the instruction of the people powerfully\r\ncontributes to the support of a democratic republic; and such must\r\nalways be the case, I believe, where instruction, which awakens the\r\nunderstanding, is not separated from moral education which amends the\r\nheart. But I by no means exaggerate this benefit, and I am still farther\r\nfrom thinking, as so many people do think in Europe, that men can be\r\ninstantaneously made citizens by teaching them to read and write. True\r\ninformation is mainly derived from experience, and if the Americans had\r\nnot been gradually accustomed to govern themselves, their book-learning\r\nwould not assist them much at the present day.\r\n\r\nI have lived a great deal with the people in the United States, and I\r\ncannot express how much I admire their experience and their good sense.\r\nAn American should never be allowed to speak of Europe; for he will then\r\nprobably display a vast deal of presumption and very foolish pride. He\r\nwill take up with those crude and vague notions which are so useful to\r\nthe ignorant all over the world. But if you question him respecting his\r\nown country, the cloud which dimmed his intelligence will immediately\r\ndisperse; his language will become as clear and as precise as his\r\nthoughts. He will inform you what his rights are, and by what means he\r\nexercises them; he will be able to point out the customs which obtain in\r\nthe political world. You will find that he is well acquainted with the\r\nrules of the administration, and that he is familiar with the mechanism\r\nof the laws. The citizen of the United States does not acquire his\r\npractical science and his positive notions from books; the instruction\r\nhe has acquired may have prepared him for receiving those ideas, but\r\nit did not furnish them. The American learns to know the laws by\r\nparticipating in the act of legislation; and he takes a lesson in the\r\nforms of government, from governing. The great work of society is ever\r\ngoing on beneath his eyes, and, as it were, under his hands.\r\n\r\nIn the United States politics are the end and aim of education;\r\nin Europe its principal object is to fit men for private life. The\r\ninterference of the citizens in public affairs is too rare an occurrence\r\nfor it to be anticipated beforehand. Upon casting a glance over society\r\nin the two hemispheres, these differences are indicated even by its\r\nexternal aspect.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, we frequently introduce the ideas and the habits of private\r\nlife into public affairs; and as we pass at once from the domestic\r\ncircle to the government of the state, we may frequently be heard to\r\ndiscuss the great interests of society in the same manner in which we\r\nconverse with our friends. The Americans, on the other hand, transfuse\r\nthe habits of public life into their manners in private; and in their\r\ncountry the jury is introduced into the games of school-boys, and\r\nparliamentary forms are observed in the order of a feast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES THAN THE PHYSICAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COUNTRY, AND\r\nTHE MANNERS MORE THAN THE LAWS.\r\n\r\nAll the Nations of America have a democratic State of Society.--Yet\r\ndemocratic Institutions subsist only among the Anglo-Americans.--The\r\nSpaniards of South America, equally favored by physical Causes as the\r\nAnglo-Americans, unable to maintain a democratic Republic.--Mexico,\r\nwhich has adopted the Constitution of the United States, in the same\r\nPredicament.--The Anglo-Americans of the West less able to maintain it\r\nthan those of the East.--Reason of these different Results.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the maintenance of democratic institutions in the\r\nUnited States is attributable to the circumstances, the laws, and the\r\nmanners of that country.[206] Most Europeans are only acquainted\r\nwith the first of these three causes, and they are apt to give it a\r\npreponderating importance which it does not really possess.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Anglo-Americans settled in the New World in a state\r\nof social equality; the low-born and the noble were not to be found\r\namong them; and professional prejudices were always as entirely unknown\r\nas the prejudices of birth. Thus, as the condition of society was\r\ndemocratic, the empire of democracy was established without difficulty.\r\nBut this circumstance is by no means peculiar to the United States;\r\nalmost all the transatlantic colonies were founded by men equal among\r\nthemselves, or who became so by inhabiting them. In no one part of\r\nthe New World have Europeans been able to create an aristocracy.\r\nNevertheless democratic institutions prosper nowhere but in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe American Union has no enemies to contend with; it stands in the\r\nwilds like an island in the ocean. But the Spaniards of South America\r\nwere no less isolated by nature; yet their position has not relieved\r\nthem from the charge of standing armies. They make war upon each other\r\nwhen they have no foreign enemies to oppose; and the Anglo-American\r\ndemocracy is the only one which has hitherto been able to maintain\r\nitself in peace.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human activity,\r\nand inexhaustible materials for industry and labor. The passion of\r\nwealth takes the place of ambition, and the warmth of faction is\r\nmitigated by a sense of prosperity. But in what portion of the globe\r\nshall we meet with more fertile plains, with mightier rivers, or with\r\nmore unexplored and inexhaustible riches, than in South America?\r\n\r\nNevertheless South America has been unable to maintain democratic\r\ninstitutions. If the welfare of nations depended on their being placed\r\nin a remote position, with an unbounded space of habitable territory\r\nbefore them, the Spaniards of South America would have no reason to\r\ncomplain of their fate. And although they might enjoy less prosperity\r\nthan the inhabitants of the United States, their lot might still be such\r\nas to excite the envy of some nations in Europe. There are, however, no\r\nnations upon the face of the earth more miserable than those of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThus, not only are physical causes inadequate to produce results\r\nanalogous to those which occur in North America, but they are unable\r\nto raise the population of South America above the level of European\r\nstates, where they act in a contrary direction. Physical causes do not\r\ntherefore affect the destiny of nations so much as has been supposed.\r\n\r\nI have met with men in New England who were on the point of leaving a\r\ncountry, where they might have remained in easy circumstances, to go to\r\nseek their fortunes in the wilds. Not far from that district I found\r\na French population in Canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow\r\nterritory, although the same wilds were at hand; and while the emigrant\r\nfrom the United States purchased an extensive estate with the earnings\r\nof a short term of labor, the Canadian paid as much for land as he would\r\nhave done in France. Nature offers the solitudes of the New World to\r\nEuropeans; but they are not always acquainted with the means of turning\r\nher gifts to account. Other peoples of America have the same physical\r\nconditions of prosperity as the Anglo-Americans, but without their laws\r\nand their manners; and these peoples are wretched. The laws and manners\r\nof the Anglo-Americans are therefore that cause of their greatness which\r\nis the object of my inquiry.\r\n\r\nI am far from supposing that the American laws are preeminently good\r\nin themselves; I do not hold them to be applicable to all democratic\r\npeoples; and several of them seem to me to be dangerous, even in the\r\nUnited States. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the American\r\nlegislation, taken collectively, is extremely well adapted to the genius\r\nof the people and the nature of the country which it is intended to\r\ngovern. The American laws are therefore good, and to them must be\r\nattributed a large portion of the success which attends the government\r\nof democracy in America: but I do not believe them to be the principal\r\ncause of that success; and if they seem to me to have more influence\r\nupon the social happiness of the Americans than the nature of the\r\ncountry, on the other hand there is reason to believe that their effect\r\nis still inferior to that produced by the manners of the people.\r\n\r\nThe federal laws undoubtedly constitute the most important part of the\r\nlegislation of the United States. Mexico, which is not less fortunately\r\nsituated than the Anglo-American Union, has adopted these same laws, but\r\nis unable to accustom itself to the government of democracy. Some other\r\ncause is therefore at work independently of those physical circumstances\r\nand peculiar laws which enable the democracy to rule in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAnother still more striking proof may be adduced. Almost all the\r\ninhabitants of the territory of the Union are the descendants of a\r\ncommon stock; they speak the same language, they worship God in the same\r\nmanner, they are affected by the same physical causes, and they obey the\r\nsame laws. Whence, then, do their characteristic differences arise?\r\nWhy, in the eastern states of the Union, does the republican government\r\ndisplay vigor and regularity, and proceed with mature deliberation?\r\nWhence does it derive the wisdom and durability which mark its acts,\r\nwhile in the western states, on the contrary, society seems to be ruled\r\nby the powers of chance? There, public business is conducted with an\r\nirregularity, and a passionate and feverish excitement, which does not\r\nannounce a long or sure duration.\r\n\r\nI am no longer comparing the Anglo-American states to foreign nations;\r\nbut I am contrasting them with each other, and endeavoring to discover\r\nwhy they are so unlike. The arguments which are derived from the nature\r\nof the country and the difference of legislation, are here all set\r\naside. Recourse must be had to some other cause; and what other cause\r\ncan there be except the manners of the people?\r\n\r\nIt is in the eastern states that the Anglo-Americans have been longest\r\naccustomed to the government of democracy, and that they have adopted\r\nthe habits and conceived the notions most favorable to its maintenance.\r\nDemocracy has gradually penetrated into their customs, their opinions,\r\nand the forms of social intercourse; it is to be found in all the\r\ndetails of daily life equally as in the laws. In the eastern states\r\nthe instruction and practical education of the people have been most\r\nperfected, and religion has been most thoroughly amalgamated with\r\nliberty. Now these habits, opinions, customs, and convictions, are\r\nprecisely the constituent elements of that which I have denominated\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nIn the western states, on the contrary, a portion of the same advantages\r\nis still wanting. Many of the Americans of the west were born in the\r\nwoods, and they mix the ideas and the customs of savage life with the\r\ncivilisation of their parents. Their passions are more intense; their\r\nreligious morality less authoritative; and their convictions are\r\nless secure. The inhabitants exercise no sort of control over their\r\nfellow-citizens, for they are scarcely acquainted with each other. The\r\nnations of the west display, to a certain extent, the inexperience\r\nand the rude habits of a people in its infancy; for although they are\r\ncomposed of old elements, their assemblage is of recent date.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the Americans of the United States are, then, the real\r\ncause which renders that people the only one of the American nations\r\nthat is able to support a democratic government; and it is the influence\r\nof manners which produces the different degrees of order and of\r\nprosperity, that may be distinguished in the several Anglo-American\r\ndemocracies. Thus the effect which the geographical position of a\r\ncountry may have upon the duration of democratic institutions is\r\nexaggerated in Europe. Too much importance is attributed to legislation,\r\ntoo little to manners. These three great causes serve, no doubt, to\r\nregulate and direct the American democracy; but if they were to\r\nbe classed in their proper order, I should say that the physical\r\ncircumstances are less efficient than the laws, and the laws very\r\nsubordinate to the manners of the people. I am convinced that the most\r\nadvantageous situation and the best possible laws cannot maintain a\r\nconstitution in spite of the manners of a country: while the latter\r\nmay turn the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws to some\r\nadvantage. The importance of manners is a common truth to which study\r\nand experience incessantly direct our attention. It may be regarded as\r\na central point in the range of human observation, and the common\r\ntermination of all inquiry. So seriously do I insist upon this head,\r\nthat if I have hitherto failed in making the reader feel the important\r\ninfluence which I attribute to the practical experience, the habits,\r\nthe opinions, in short, to the manners of the Americans, upon the\r\nmaintenance of their institutions, I have failed in the principal object\r\nof my work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHETHER LAWS AND MANNERS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN DEMOCRATIC\r\nINSTITUTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES BESIDE AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans, if transported into Europe, would be obliged\r\nto modify their Laws.--Distinction to be made between democratic\r\nInstitutions and American Institutions.--Democratic Laws may be\r\nconceived better than, or at least different from, those which the\r\nAmerican Democracy has adopted.--The Example of America only proves that\r\nit is possible to regulate Democracy by the assistance of Manners and\r\nLegislation.\r\n\r\nI have asserted that the success of democratic institutions in the\r\nUnited States is more intimately connected with the laws themselves, and\r\nthe manners of the people, than with the nature of the country. But\r\ndoes it follow that the same causes would of themselves produce the same\r\nresults, if they were put into operation elsewhere; and if the country\r\nis no adequate substitute for laws and manners, can laws and manners\r\nin their turn prove a substitute for a country? It will readily be\r\nunderstood that the necessary elements of a reply to this question\r\nare wanting: other peoples are to be found in the New World beside the\r\nAnglo-Americans, and as these peoples are affected by the same physical\r\ncircumstances as the latter, they may fairly be compared together. But\r\nthere are no nations out of America which have adopted the same laws\r\nand manners, being destitute of the physical advantages peculiar to the\r\nAnglo-Americans. No standard of comparison therefore exists, and we can\r\nonly hazard an opinion upon this subject.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me in the first place, that a careful distinction must\r\nbe made between the institutions of the United States and democratic\r\ninstitutions in general. When I reflect upon the state of Europe, its\r\nmighty nations, its populous cities, its formidable armies, and\r\nthe complex nature of its politics, I cannot suppose that even the\r\nAnglo-Americans, if they were transported to our hemisphere, with\r\ntheir ideas, their religion, and their manners, could exist without\r\nconsiderably altering their laws. But a democratic nation may be\r\nimagined, organized differently from the American people. It is not\r\nimpossible to conceive a government really established upon the will\r\nof the majority; but in which the majority, repressing its natural\r\npropensity to equality, should consent, with a view to the order and the\r\nstability of the state, to invest a family or an individual with all\r\nthe prerogatives of the executive. A democratic society might exist, in\r\nwhich the forces of the nation would be more centralized than they are\r\nin the United States; the people would exercise a less direct and less\r\nirresistible influence upon public affairs, and yet every citizen,\r\ninvested with certain rights, would participate, within his sphere,\r\nin the conduct of the government. The observations I made among the\r\nAnglo-Americans induce me to believe that democratic institutions of\r\nthis kind, prudently introduced into society, so as gradually to mix\r\nwith the habits and to be infused with the opinions of the people, might\r\nsubsist in other countries beside America. If the laws of the United\r\nStates were the only imaginable democratic laws, or the most perfect\r\nwhich it is possible to conceive, I should admit that the success\r\nof those institutions affords no proof of the success of democratic\r\ninstitutions in general, in a country less favored by natural\r\ncircumstances. But as the laws of America appear to me to be defective\r\nin several respects, and as I can readily imagine others of the same\r\ngeneral nature, the peculiar advantages of that country do not prove\r\nthat democratic institutions cannot succeed in a nation less favored by\r\ncircumstances, if ruled by better laws.\r\n\r\nIf human nature were different in America from what it is elsewhere; or\r\nif the social condition of the Americans engendered habits and opinions\r\namong them different from those which originate in the same social\r\ncondition in the Old World, the American democracies would afford\r\nno means of predicting what may occur in other democracies. If the\r\nAmericans displayed the same propensities as all other democratic\r\nnations, and if their legislators had relied upon the nature of the\r\ncountry and the favor of circumstances to restrain those propensities\r\nwithin due limits, the prosperity of the United States would be\r\nexclusively attributable to physical causes, and it would afford no\r\nencouragement to a people inclined to imitate their example, without\r\nsharing their natural advantages. But neither of these suppositions is\r\nborne out by facts.\r\n\r\nIn America the same passions are to be met with as in Europe; some\r\noriginating in human nature, others in the democratic condition of\r\nsociety. Thus in the United States I found that restlessness of heart\r\nwhich is natural to men, when all ranks are nearly equal and the chances\r\nof elevation are the same to all. I found the democratic feeling of envy\r\nexpressed under a thousand different forms. I remarked that the people\r\nfrequently displayed, in the conduct of affairs, a consummate mixture\r\nof ignorance and presumption, and I inferred that, in America, men are\r\nliable to the same failings and the same absurdities as among ourselves.\r\nBut upon examining the state of society more attentively, I speedily\r\ndiscovered that the Americans had made great and successful efforts\r\nto counteract these imperfections of human nature, and to correct the\r\nnatural defects of democracy. Their divers municipal laws appeared to\r\nme to be a means of restraining the ambition of the citizens within\r\na narrow sphere, and of turning those same passions, which might have\r\nworked havoc in the state, to the good of the township or the parish.\r\nThe American legislators have succeeded to a certain extent in opposing\r\nthe notion of rights, to the feelings of envy; the permanence of the\r\nreligious world, to the continual shifting of politics; the experience\r\nof the people, to its theoretical ignorance; and its practical knowledge\r\nof business, to the impatience of its desires.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, then, have not relied upon the nature of their country,\r\nto counterpoise those dangers which originate in their constitution and\r\nin their political laws. To evils which are common to all democratic\r\npeoples, they have applied remedies which none but themselves had\r\never thought of before; and although they were the first to make the\r\nexperiment, they have succeeded in it.\r\n\r\nThe manners and laws of the Americans are not the only ones which may\r\nsuit a democratic people; but the Americans have shown that it would be\r\nwrong to despair of regulating democracy by the aid of manners and of\r\nlaws. If other nations should borrow this general and pregnant idea from\r\nthe Americans, without however intending to imitate them in the peculiar\r\napplication which they have made of it; if they should attempt to fit\r\nthemselves for that social condition, which it seems to be the will of\r\nProvidence to impose upon the generations of this age, and so to escape\r\nfrom the despotism of the anarchy which threatens them; what reason is\r\nthere to suppose that their efforts would not be crowned with success?\r\nThe organization and the establishment of democracy in Christendom, is\r\nthe great political problem of the time. The Americans, unquestionably,\r\nhave not resolved this problem, but they furnish useful data to those\r\nwho undertake the task.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF WHAT PRECEDES WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\nIt may readily be discovered with what intention I undertook the\r\nforegoing inquiries. The question here discussed is interesting not only\r\nto the United States, but to the whole world; it concerns, not a nation,\r\nbut all mankind. If those nations whose social condition is democratic\r\ncould only remain free as long as they are inhabitants of the wilds,\r\nwe could not but despair of the future destiny of the human race; for\r\ndemocracy is rapidly acquiring a more extended sway, and the wilds are\r\ngradually peopled with men. If it were true that laws and manners are\r\ninsufficient to maintain democratic institutions, what refuge would\r\nremain open to the nations except the despotism of a single individual?\r\nI am aware that there are many worthy persons at the present time who\r\nare not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who are so tired of\r\nliberty as to be glad of repose, far from those storms by which it is\r\nattended. But these individuals are ill acquainted with the haven to\r\nwhich they are bound. They are so deluded by their recollections, as to\r\njudge the tendency of absolute power by what it was formerly, and not\r\nwhat it might become at the present time.\r\n\r\nIf absolute power were re-established among the democratic nations of\r\nEurope, I am persuaded that it would assume a new form, and appear under\r\nfeatures unknown to our forefathers. There was a time in Europe, when\r\nthe laws and the consent of the people had invested princes with almost\r\nunlimited authority; but they scarcely ever availed themselves of it.\r\nI do not speak of the prerogatives of the nobility, of the authority of\r\nsupreme courts of justice, of corporations and their chartered rights,\r\nor of provincial privileges, which served to break the blows of the\r\nsovereign authority, and to maintain a spirit of resistance in the\r\nnation. Independently of these political institutions--which, however\r\nopposed they might be to personal liberty, served to keep alive the love\r\nof freedom in the mind of the public, and which may be esteemed to have\r\nbeen useful in this respect--the manners and opinions of the nation\r\nconfined the royal authority within barriers which were not less\r\npowerful, although they were less conspicuous. Religion, the affections\r\nof the people, the benevolence of the prince, the sense of honor, family\r\npride, provincial prejudices, custom, and public opinion, limited the\r\npower of kings, and restrained their authority within an invisible\r\ncircle. The constitution of nations was despotic at that time but their\r\nmanners were free. Princes had the right, but they had neither the means\r\nnor the desire, of doing whatever they pleased.\r\n\r\nBut what now remains of those barriers which formerly arrested the\r\naggressions of tyranny? Since religion has lost its empire over the\r\nsouls of men, the most prominent boundary which divided good from evil\r\nis overthrown: the very elements of the moral world are indeterminate;\r\nthe princes and the peoples of the earth are guided by chance, and none\r\ncan define the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of license.\r\nLong revolutions have for ever destroyed the respect which surrounded\r\nthe rulers of the state; and since they have been relieved from the\r\nburden of public esteem, princes may henceforward surrender themselves\r\nwithout fear to the seductions of arbitrary power.\r\n\r\nWhen kings find that the hearts of their subjects are turned toward\r\nthem, they are clement, because they are conscious of their strength;\r\nand they are chary of the affection of their people, because the\r\naffection of their people is the bulwark of the throne. A mutual\r\ninterchange of good will then takes place between the prince and the\r\npeople, which resembles the gracious intercourse of domestic society.\r\nThe subjects may murmur at the sovereign's decree, but they are grieved\r\nto displease him; and the sovereign chastises his subjects with the\r\nlight hand of parental affection.\r\n\r\nBut when once the spell of royalty is broken in the tumult of\r\nrevolution; when successive monarchs have occupied the throne, and\r\nalternately displayed to the people the weakness of right, and the\r\nharshness of power, the sovereign is no longer regarded by any as the\r\nfather of the state, and he is feared by all as its master. If he be\r\nweak, he is despised; if he be strong, he is detested. He is himself\r\nfull of animosity and alarm; he finds that he is a stranger in his own\r\ncountry, and he treats his subjects like conquered enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen the provinces and the towns formed so many different nations in the\r\nmidst of their common country, each of them had a will of its own, which\r\nwas opposed to the general spirit of subjection; but now that all the\r\nparts of the same empire, after having lost their immunities, their\r\ncustoms, their prejudices, their traditions, and their names, are\r\nsubjected and accustomed to the same laws, it is not more difficult to\r\noppress them collectively, than it was formerly to oppress them singly.\r\n\r\nWhile the nobles enjoyed their power, and indeed long after that power\r\nwas lost, the honor of aristocracy conferred an extraordinary degree\r\nof force upon their personal opposition. They afforded instances of men\r\nwho, notwithstanding their weakness, still entertained a high opinion of\r\ntheir personal value, and dared to cope single-handed with the efforts\r\nof the public authority. But at the present day, when all ranks are more\r\nand more confounded, when the individual disappears in the throng, and\r\nis easily lost in the midst of a common obscurity, when the honor of\r\nmonarchy has almost lost its empire without being succeeded by public\r\nvirtue, and when nothing can enable man to rise above himself, who shall\r\nsay at what point the exigencies of power and servility of weakness will\r\nstop?\r\n\r\nAs long as family feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of oppression\r\nwas never alone; he looked about him, and found his clients, his\r\nhereditary friends, and his kinsfolk. If this support was wanting, he\r\nwas sustained by his ancestors and animated by his posterity. But\r\nwhen patrimonial estates are divided, and when a few years suffice to\r\nconfound the distinctions of a race, where can family feeling be found?\r\nWhat force can there be in the customs of a country which has changed,\r\nand is still perpetually changing its aspect; in which every act of\r\ntyranny has a precedent, and every crime an example; in which there\r\nis nothing so old that its antiquity can save it from destruction, and\r\nnothing so unparalleled that its novelty can prevent it from being done?\r\nWhat resistance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make, that they\r\nhave already often yielded? What strength can even public opinion have\r\nretained, when no twenty persons are connected by a common tie; when\r\nnot a man, nor a family, nor chartered corporation, nor class, nor free\r\ninstitution, has the power of representing that opinion; and when every\r\ncitizen--being equally weak, equally poor, and equally dependant--has\r\nonly his personal impotence to oppose to the organized force of the\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nThe annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the condition in which\r\nthat country might then be thrown. But it may more aptly be assimilated\r\nto the times of old, and to those hideous eras of Roman oppression, when\r\nthe manners of the people were corrupted, their traditions obliterated,\r\ntheir habits destroyed, their opinions shaken, and freedom, expelled\r\nfrom the laws, could find no refuge in the land; when nothing protected\r\nthe citizens, and the citizens no longer protected themselves; when\r\nhuman nature was the sport of man, and princes wearied out the clemency\r\nof Heaven before they exhausted the patience of their subjects. Those\r\nwho hope to revive the monarchy of Henry IV. or of Louis XIV., appear\r\nto me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and when I consider the\r\npresent condition of several European nations--a condition to which all\r\nthe others tend--I am led to believe that they will soon be left with\r\nno other alternative than democratic liberty, or the tyranny of the\r\nCaesars.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, it is deserving of consideration, whether men are to be\r\nentirely emancipated, or entirely enslaved; whether their rights are to\r\nbe made equal, or wholly taken away from them. If the rulers of society\r\nwere reduced either gradually to raise the crowd to their own level,\r\nor to sink the citizens below that of humanity, would not the doubts of\r\nmany be resolved, the consciences of many be healed, and the community\r\nbe prepared to make great sacrifices with little difficulty? In that\r\ncase, the gradual growth of democratic manners and institutions should\r\nbe regarded, not as the best, but as the only means of preserving\r\nfreedom; and without liking the government of democracy, it might be\r\nadopted as the most applicable and the fairest remedy for the present\r\nills of society.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to associate a people in the work of government; but it\r\nis still more difficult to supply it with experience, and to inspire\r\nit with the feelings which it requires in order to govern well. I grant\r\nthat the caprices of democracy are perpetual; its instruments are rude,\r\nits laws imperfect. But if it were true that soon no just medium would\r\nexist between the empire of democracy and the dominion of a single arm,\r\nshould we not rather incline toward the former, than submit voluntarily\r\nto the latter? And if complete equality be our fate, is it not better to\r\nbe levelled by free institutions than by despotic power?\r\n\r\nThose who, after having read this book, should imagine that my\r\nintention in writing it has been to propose the laws and manners of\r\nthe Anglo-Americans for the imitation of all democratic peoples, would\r\ncommit a very great mistake; they must have paid more attention to the\r\nform than to the substance of my ideas. My aim has been to show, by the\r\nexample of America, that laws, and especially manners, may exist, which\r\nwill allow a democratic people to remain free. But I am very far from\r\nthinking that we ought to follow the example of the American democracy,\r\nand copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends; for I\r\nam well aware of the influence which the nature of a country and its\r\npolitical precedents exercise upon a constitution; and I should regard\r\nit as a great misfortune for mankind, if liberty were to exist, all over\r\nthe world, under the same forms.\r\n\r\nBut I am of opinion that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing\r\ndemocratic institutions into France, and if we despair of imparting to\r\nthe citizens those ideas and sentiments which first prepare them\r\nfor freedom, and afterward allow them to enjoy it, there will be no\r\nindependence at all, either for the middling classes or the nobility,\r\nfor the poor or for the rich, but an equal tyranny over all; and I\r\nforesee that if the peaceable empire of the majority be not founded\r\namong us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at the unlimited\r\nauthority of a single despot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[199] The United States have no metropolis; but they already contain\r\nseveral very large cities. Philadelphia reckoned 161,000 inhabitants,\r\nand New York 202,000, in the year 1830. The lower orders which inhabit\r\nthese cities constitute a rabble even more formidable than the populace\r\nof European towns. They consist of freed blacks in the first place, who\r\nare condemned by the laws and by public opinion, to an hereditary state\r\nof misery and degradation. They also contain a multitude of Europeans\r\nwho have been driven to the shores of the New World by their misfortunes\r\nor their misconduct; and these men inoculate the United States with\r\nall our vices, without bringing with them any of those interests which\r\ncounteract their baneful influence. As inhabitants of a country where\r\nthey have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all the passions which\r\nagitate the community to their own advantage; thus, within the last few\r\nmonths serious riots have broken out in Philadelphia and in New York.\r\nDisturbances of this kind are unknown in the rest of the country, which\r\nis nowise alarmed by them, because the population of the cities has\r\nhitherto exercised neither power nor influence over the rural districts.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I look upon the size of certain American cities, and\r\nespecially on the nature of their population, as a real danger which\r\nthreatens the future security of the democratic republics of the\r\nNew World: and I venture to predict that they will perish from this\r\ncircumstance, unless the government succeed in creating an armed force,\r\nwhich, while it remains under the control of the majority of the nation,\r\nwill be independent of the town population, and able to repress its\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\n[200] In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they are\r\nrarely subjected to farther division.\r\n\r\n[201] The New York Spectator of August 23, 1831, relates the fact in\r\nthe following terms: \"The court of common pleas of Chester county (New\r\nYork), a few days since rejected a witness who declared his disbelief\r\nin the existence of God. The presiding judge remarked, that he had not\r\nbefore been aware that there was a man living who did not believe in\r\nthe existence of God; that this belief constituted the sanction of\r\nall testimony in a court of justice; and that he knew of no cause in a\r\nChristian country, where a witness had been permitted to testify without\r\nsuch belief.\"\r\n\r\n[The instance given by the author, of a person offered as a witness\r\nhaving been rejected on the ground that he did not believe in the\r\nexistence of a God, seems to be adduced to prove either his assertion\r\nthat the Americans hold religion to be indispensable to the maintenance\r\nof republican institutions--or his assertion, that if a man attacks all\r\nthe sects together, every one abandons him and he remains alone. But\r\nit is questionable how far the fact quoted proves either of these\r\npositions. The rule which prescribes as a qualification for a witness\r\nthe belief in a Supreme Being who will punish falsehood, without which\r\nhe is deemed wholly incompetent to testify, is established for the\r\nprotection of personal rights, and not to compel the adoption of any\r\nsystem of religious belief. It came with all our fundamental principles\r\nfrom England as a part of the common law which the colonists brought\r\nwith them. It is supposed to prevail in every country in Christendom,\r\nwhatever may be the form of its government; and the only doubt that\r\narises respecting its existence in France, is created by our author's\r\napparent surprise at finding such a rule in America.--_American\r\nEditor_.]\r\n\r\n[202] Unless this term be applied to the functions which many of them\r\nfill in the schools. Almost all education is intrusted to the clergy.\r\n\r\n[203] See the constitution of New York, art. 7, § 4:--\"And whereas,\r\nthe ministers of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to the\r\nservice of God and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted\r\nfrom the great duties of their functions; therefore no minister of the\r\ngospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall, at any time\r\nhereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible to,\r\nor capable of holding any civil or military office or place within this\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\nSee also the constitutions of North Carolina, art. 31. Virginia. South\r\nCarolina, art. 1, § 23. Kentucky, art. 2, § 26. Tennessee, art S, § 1.\r\nLouisiana, art. 2, § 22.\r\n\r\n[204] I travelled along a portion of the frontier of the United States\r\nin a sort of cart which was termed the mail. We passed, day and night,\r\nwith great rapidity along roads which were scarcely marked out, through\r\nimmense forests: when the gloom of the woods became impenetrable, the\r\ncoachman lighted branches of fir and we journied along by the light they\r\ncast. From time to time we came to a hut in the midst of the forest,\r\nwhich was a postoffice. The mail dropped an enormous bundle of letters\r\nat the door of this isolated dwelling, and we pursued our way at full\r\ngallop, leaving the inhabitants of the neighboring log-houses to send\r\nfor their share of the treasure.\r\n\r\n[205] In 1832, each inhabitant of Michigan paid a sum equivalent to 1\r\nfranc, 22 centimes (French money) to the postoffice revenue; and each\r\ninhabitant of the Floridas paid 1 fr. 5 cent (See National Calendar,\r\n1833, p. 244.) In the same year each inhabitant of the department du\r\nNord, paid 1 fr. 4 cent, to the revenue of the French postoffice. (See\r\nthe Compte rendu de l'Administration des Finances, 1833, p. 623.) Now\r\nthe state of Michigan only contained at that time 7 inhabitants per\r\nsquare league; and Florida only 5; the instruction and the commercial\r\nactivity of these districts are inferior to those of most of the\r\nstates in the Union; while the department du Nord, which contains\r\n3,400 inhabitants per square league, is one of the most enlightened and\r\nmanufacturing parts of France.\r\n\r\n[206] I remind the reader of the general signification which I give to\r\nthe word _manners_, namely, the moral and intellectual characteristics\r\nof social man taken collectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT AND PROBABLE FUTURE CONDITION OF THE THREE RACES WHICH\r\nINHABIT THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the task which I had imposed upon myself is now\r\nperformed: I have shown, as far as I was able, the laws and manners of\r\nthe American democracy. Here I might stop; but the reader would perhaps\r\nfeel that I had not satisfied his expectations.\r\n\r\nThe absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we meet with in\r\nAmerica; the inhabitants of the New World may be considered from more\r\nthan one point of view. In the course of this work, my subject has often\r\nled me to speak of the Indians and the negroes; but I have never been\r\nable to stop in order to show what places these two races occupy, in the\r\nmidst of the democratic people whom I was engaged in describing. I have\r\nmentioned in what spirit, and according to what laws, the Anglo-American\r\nUnion was formed; but I could only glance at the dangers which menace\r\nthat confederation, while it was equally impossible for me to give a\r\ndetailed account of its chances of duration, independently of its laws\r\nand manners. When speaking of the United republican States, I hazarded\r\nno conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in the New World;\r\nand when making frequent allusion to the commercial activity which\r\nreigns in the Union, I was unable to inquire into the future condition\r\nof the Americans as a commercial people.\r\n\r\nThese topics are collaterally connected with my subject, without forming\r\na part of it; they are American, without being democratic; and to\r\nportray democracy has been my principal aim. It was therefore necessary\r\nto postpone these questions, which I now take up as the proper\r\ntermination of my work.\r\n\r\nThe territory now occupied or claimed by the American Union, spreads\r\nfrom the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific ocean. On the\r\neast and west its limits are those of the continent itself. On the\r\nsouth it advances nearly to the tropic, and it extends upward to the icy\r\nregions of the north.[207]\r\n\r\nThe human beings who are scattered over this space do not form, as\r\nin Europe, so many branches of the same stock. Three races naturally\r\ndistinct, and I might almost say hostile to each other, are discoverable\r\namong them at the first glance. Almost insurmountable barriers had been\r\nraised between them by education and by law, as well as by their origin\r\nand outward characteristics; but fortune has brought them together on\r\nthe same soil, where, although they are mixed, they do not amalgamate,\r\nand each race fulfils its destiny apart.\r\n\r\nAmong these widely differing families of men, the first which attracts\r\nattention, the superior in intelligence, in power, and in enjoyment, is\r\nthe white or European, the MAN pre-eminent; and in subordinate grades,\r\nthe negro and the Indian. These two unhappy races have nothing in\r\ncommon; neither birth, nor features, nor language, nor habits. Their\r\nonly resemblance lies in their misfortunes. Both of them occupy an\r\ninferior rank in the country they inhabit; both suffer from tyranny; and\r\nif their wrongs are not the same, they originate at any rate with the\r\nsame authors.\r\n\r\nIf we reasoned from what passes in the world, we should almost say that\r\nthe European is to the other races of mankind, what man is to the lower\r\nanimals;--he makes them subservient to his use; and when he cannot\r\nsubdue, he destroys them. Oppression has at one stroke deprived the\r\ndescendants of the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity.\r\nThe negro of the United States has lost all remembrance of his country;\r\nthe language which his forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he\r\nabjured their religion and forgot their customs when he ceased to belong\r\nto Africa, without acquiring any claim to European privileges. But he\r\nremains half-way between the two communities; sold by the one, repulsed\r\nby the other; finding not a spot in the universe to call by the name\r\nof country, except the faint image of a home which the shelter of his\r\nmaster's roof affords.\r\n\r\nThe negro has no family; woman is merely the temporary companion of his\r\npleasures, and his children are upon an equality with himself from the\r\nmoment of their birth. Am I to call it a proof of God's mercy, or\r\na visitation of his wrath, that man in certain states appears to be\r\ninsensible to his extreme wretchedness, and almost affects with a\r\ndepraved taste the cause of his misfortunes? The negro, who is plunged\r\nin this abyss of evils, scarcely feels his own calamitous situation.\r\nViolence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the\r\nthoughts and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants more than he\r\nhates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of\r\nthose who oppress him: his understanding is degraded to the level of his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThe negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born; nay, he may have\r\nbeen purchased in the womb, and have begun his slavery before he began\r\nhis existence. Equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to\r\nhimself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the\r\nproperty of another who has an interest in preserving his life, and that\r\nthe care of it does not devolve upon himself; even the power of thought\r\nappears to him a useless gift of Providence, and he quietly enjoys the\r\nprivileges of his debasement.\r\n\r\nIf he becomes free, independence is often felt by him to be a heavier\r\nburden than slavery; for having learned, in the course of his life, to\r\nsubmit to everything except reason, he is too much unacquainted with\r\nher dictates to obey them. A thousand new desires beset him, and he is\r\ndestitute of the knowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these\r\nare masters which it is necessary to contend with, and he has learned\r\nonly to submit and obey. In short, he sinks to such a depth of\r\nwretchedness, that while servitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.\r\n\r\nOppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the negro race,\r\nbut its effects are different. Before the arrival of the white men in\r\nthe New World, the inhabitants of North America lived quietly in their\r\nwoods, enduring the vicissitudes, and practising the virtues and vices\r\ncommon to savage nations. The Europeans, having dispersed the Indian\r\ntribes and driven them into the deserts, condemned them to a wandering\r\nlife full of inexpressible sufferings.\r\n\r\nSavage nations are only controlled by opinion and by custom. When the\r\nNorth American Indians had lost their sentiment of attachment to their\r\ncountry; when their families were dispersed, their traditions obscured,\r\nand the chain of their recollections broken; when all their habits were\r\nchanged, and their wants increased beyond measure, European tyranny\r\nrendered them more disorderly and less civilized than they were before.\r\nThe moral and physical condition of these tribes continually grew\r\nworse, and they became more barbarous as they became more wretched.\r\nNevertheless the Europeans have not been able to metamorphose the\r\ncharacter of the Indians; and though they have had power to destroy\r\nthem, they have never been able to make them submit to the rules of\r\ncivilized society.\r\n\r\nThe lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while\r\nthat of the Indian lies on the utmost verge of liberty; and slavery does\r\nnot produce more fatal effects upon the first, than independence upon\r\nthe second. The negro has lost all property in his own person, and he\r\ncannot dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud:\r\nbut the savage is his own master as soon as he is able to act; parental\r\nauthority is scarcely known to him; he has never bent his will to\r\nthat of any of his kind, or learned the difference between voluntary\r\nobedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of law is unknown\r\nto him. To be free, with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles\r\nof society. As he delights in this barbarous independence, and would\r\nrather perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civilisation has\r\nlittle power over him.\r\n\r\nThe negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself among\r\nmen who repulse him; he conforms to the taste of his oppressors, adopts\r\ntheir opinions, and hopes by imitating them to form a part of their\r\ncommunity. Having been told from infancy that his race is naturally\r\ninferior to that of the whites, he assents to the proposition, and is\r\nashamed of his own nature. In each of his features he discovers a trace\r\nof slavery, and, if it were in his power, he would willingly rid himself\r\nof everything that makes him what he is.\r\n\r\nThe Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated with the\r\npretended nobility of his origin, and lives and dies in the midst of\r\nthese dreams of pride. Far from desiring to conform his habits to ours,\r\nhe loves his savage life as the distinguishing mark of his race, and he\r\nrepels every advance to civilisation, less perhaps from the hatred\r\nwhich he entertains for it, than from a dread of resembling the\r\nEuropeans.[208] While he has nothing to oppose to our perfection in\r\nthe arts but the resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing but\r\nundisciplined courage; while our well-digested plans are met by the\r\nspontaneous instincts of savage life, who can wonder if he fails in this\r\nunequal contest?\r\n\r\nThe negro who earnestly desires to mingle his race with that of the\r\nEuropean, cannot effect it; while the Indian, who might succeed to a\r\ncertain extent, disdains to make the attempt. The servility of the one\r\ndooms him to slavery, the pride of the other to death.\r\n\r\nI remember that while I was travelling through the forests which still\r\ncover the state of Alabama, I arrived one day at the log house of a\r\npioneer. I did not wish to penetrate into the dwelling of the American,\r\nbut retired to rest myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which\r\nwas not far off, in the woods. While I was in this place (which was\r\nin the neighborhood of the Creek territory), an Indian woman appeared,\r\nfollowed by a negress, and holding by the hand a little white girl of\r\nfive or six years old, whom I took to be the daughter of the pioneer.\r\nA sort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the Indian; rings\r\nof metal were hanging from her nostrils and ears; her hair, which was\r\nadorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders; and I saw\r\nthat she was not married, for she still wore the necklace of shells\r\nwhich the bride always deposits on the nuptial couch. The negress was\r\nclad in squalid European garments.\r\n\r\nThey all three came and seated themselves upon the banks of the\r\nfountain; and the young Indian, taking the child in her arms, lavished\r\nupon her such fond caresses as mothers give; while the negress\r\nendeavored by various little artifices to attract the attention of\r\nthe young Creole. The child displayed in her slightest gestures a\r\nconsciousness of superiority which formed a strange contrast with her\r\ninfantine weakness; as if she received the attentions of her companions\r\nwith a sort of condescension.\r\n\r\nThe negress was seated on the ground before her mistress, watching her\r\nsmallest desires, and apparently divided between strong affection for\r\nthe child and servile fear; while the savage displayed, in the midst\r\nof her tenderness, an air of freedom and of pride which was almost\r\nferocious. I had approached the group, and I contemplated them in\r\nsilence; but my curiosity was probably displeasing to the Indian woman,\r\nfor she suddenly rose, pushed the child roughly from her, and giving me\r\nan angry look, plunged into the thicket.\r\n\r\nI had often chanced to see individuals met together in the same place,\r\nwho belonged to the three races of men which people North America. I had\r\nperceived from many different results the preponderance of the whites.\r\nBut in the picture which I have just been describing there was something\r\npeculiarly touching; a bond of affection here united the oppressors with\r\nthe oppressed, and the effort of Nature to bring them together rendered\r\nstill more striking the immense distance placed between them by\r\nprejudice and by law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT AND PROBABLE FUTURE CONDITION OF THE INDIAN TRIBES WHICH\r\nINHABIT THE TERRITORY POSSESSED BY THE UNION.\r\n\r\nGradual disappearance of the native Tribes.--Manner in which it takes\r\nplace.--Miseries accompanying the forced Migrations of the Indians.--The\r\nSavages of North America had only two ways of escaping Destruction; War\r\nor Civilisation.--They are no longer able to make War.--Reasons why they\r\nrefused to become civilized when it was in their Power, and why they\r\ncannot become so now that they desire it.--Instance of the Creek\r\nand Cherokees.--Policy of the particular States toward these\r\nIndians.--Policy of the federal Government.\r\n\r\nNone of the Indian tribes which formerly inhabited the territory of New\r\nEngland--the Narragansets, the Mohicans, the Pequots--have any existence\r\nbut in the recollection of man. The Lenapes, who received William Penn\r\na hundred and fifty years ago upon the banks of the Delaware, have\r\ndisappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were\r\nbegging alms. The nations I have mentioned formerly covered the country\r\nto the seacoast; but a traveller at the present day must penetrate more\r\nthan a hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to find\r\nan Indian. Not only have these wild tribes receded, but they are\r\ndestroyed;[209] and as they give way or perish, an immense and\r\nincreasing people fills their place. There is no instance on record of\r\nso prodigious a growth, or so rapid a destruction; the manner in which\r\nthe latter change takes place is not difficult to describe.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians were the sole inhabitants of the wilds whence they\r\nhave been expelled, their wants were few. Their arms were of their own\r\nmanufacture, their only drink was the water of the brook, and their\r\nclothes consisted of the skin of animals, whose flesh furnished them\r\nwith food.\r\n\r\nThe Europeans introduced among the savages of North America firearms,\r\nardent spirits, and iron: they taught them to exchange for manufactured\r\nstuffs the rough garments which had previously satisfied their untutored\r\nsimplicity. Having acquired new tastes, without the arts by which they\r\ncould be gratified, the Indians were obliged to have recourse to the\r\nworkmanship of the whites; but in return for their productions, the\r\nsavage had nothing to offer except the rich furs which still abounded in\r\nhis woods. Hence the chase became necessary, not merely to provide for\r\nhis subsistence, but in order to procure the only objects of barter\r\nwhich he could furnish to Europe.[210] While the wants of the natives\r\nwere thus increasing, their resources continued to diminish. From the\r\nmoment when a European settlement is formed in the neighborhood of\r\nthe territory occupied by the Indians, the beasts of chase take the\r\nalarm.[211] Thousands of savages, wandering in the forest and destitute\r\nof any fixed dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon as the\r\ncontinuous sounds of European labor are heard in the neighborhood, they\r\nbegin to flee away, and retire to the west, where their instinct teaches\r\nthem that they will find deserts of immeasurable extent. \"The buffalo is\r\nconstantly receding\", say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report of the\r\nyear 1829; \"a few years since they approached the base of the Allegany;\r\nand a few years hence they may even be rare upon the immense plains\r\nwhich extend to the base of the Rocky mountains.\" I have been assured\r\nthat this effect of the approach of the whites is often felt at two\r\nhundred leagues' distance from the frontier. Their influence is thus\r\nexerted over tribes whose name is unknown to them, and who suffer the\r\nevils of usurpation long before they are acquainted with the authors of\r\ntheir distress.[212]\r\n\r\nBold adventurers soon penetrate into the country the Indians have\r\ndeserted, and when they have advanced about fifteen or twenty\r\nleagues from the extreme frontiers of the whites, they begin to build\r\nhabitations for civilized beings in the midst of the wilderness. This\r\nis done without difficulty, as the territory of a hunting nation is ill\r\ndefined; it is the common property of the tribe, and belongs to no one\r\nin particular, so that individual interests are not concerned in the\r\nprotection of any part of it.\r\n\r\nA few European families, settled in different situations at a\r\nconsiderable distance from each other, soon drive away the wild animals\r\nwhich remain between their places of abode. The Indians, who had\r\npreviously lived in a sort of abundance, then find it difficult to\r\nsubsist, and still more difficult to procure the articles of barter\r\nwhich they stand in need of.\r\n\r\nTo drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence,\r\nas effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists were stricken with\r\nbarrenness; and they are reduced, like famished wolves, to prowl through\r\nthe forsaken woods in quest of prey. Their instinctive love of their\r\ncountry attaches them to the soil which gave them birth,[213] even after\r\nit has ceased to yield anything but misery and death. At length they\r\nare compelled to acquiesce, and to depart: they follow the traces of the\r\nelk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by those wild animals\r\nin the choice of their future country. Properly speaking, therefore, it\r\nis not the Europeans who drive away the native inhabitants of America;\r\nit is famine which compels them to recede; a happy distinction, which\r\nhad escaped the casuists of former times, and for which we are indebted\r\nto modern discovery.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive the extent of the sufferings which attend\r\nthese forced emigrations. They are undertaken by a people already\r\nexhausted and reduced; and the countries to which the new-comers betake\r\nthemselves are inhabited by other tribes which receive them with jealous\r\nhostility. Hunger is in the rear; war awaits them, and misery besets\r\nthem on all sides. In the hope of escaping from such a host of enemies,\r\nthey separate, and each individual endeavors to procure the means\r\nof supporting his existence in solitude and secrecy, living in the\r\nimmensity of the desert like an outcast in civilized society. The social\r\ntie, which distress had long since weakened, is then dissolved; they\r\nhave lost their country, and their people soon deserts them; their very\r\nfamilies are obliterated; the names they bore in common are forgotten,\r\ntheir language perishes, and all the traces of their origin disappear.\r\nTheir nation has ceased to exist, except in the recollection of the\r\nantiquaries of America and a few of the learned of Europe.\r\n\r\nI should be sorry to have my reader suppose that I am coloring the\r\npicture too highly: I saw with my own eyes several of the cases of\r\nmisery which I have been describing; and I was the witness of sufferings\r\nwhich I have not the power to portray.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1831, while I was on the left bank of the\r\nMississippi, at a place named by Europeans Memphis, there arrived a\r\nnumerous band of Choctaws (or Chactas, as they are called by the\r\nFrench in Louisiana). These savages had left their country, and were\r\nendeavoring to gain the right bank of the Mississippi, where they\r\nhoped to find an asylum which had been promised them by the American\r\ngovernment. It was then in the middle of winter, and the cold was\r\nunusually severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the\r\nriver was drifting huge masses of ice. The Indians had their families\r\nwith them; and they brought in their train the wounded and the sick,\r\nwith children newly born, and old men upon the verge of death. They\r\npossessed neither tents nor wagons, but only their arms and some\r\nprovisions. I saw them embark to pass the mighty river, and never will\r\nthat solemn spectacle fade from my remembrance. No cry, no sob was heard\r\namong the assembled crowd: all were silent. Their calamities were of\r\nancient date, and they knew them to be irremediable. The Indians had\r\nall stepped into the bark which was to carry them across, but their dogs\r\nremained upon the bank. As soon as these animals perceived that their\r\nmasters were finally leaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and\r\nplunging all together into the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam\r\nafter the boat.\r\n\r\nThe ejectment of the Indians very often takes place at the present\r\nday, in a regular, and, as it were, a legal manner. When the European\r\npopulation begins to approach the limit of the desert inhabited by a\r\nsavage tribe, the government of the United States usually despatches\r\nenvoys to them, who assemble the Indians in a large plain, and having\r\nfirst eaten and drunk with them, accost them in the following manner:\r\n\"What have you to do in the land of your fathers? Before long you must\r\ndig up their bones in order to live. In what respect is the country you\r\ninhabit better than another? Are there no woods, marshes, or prairies,\r\nexcept where you dwell? And can you live nowhere but under your own sun?\r\nBeyond those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond the lake\r\nwhich bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast countries where\r\nbeasts of chase are found in great abundance; sell your land to us, and\r\ngo to live happily in those solitudes.\" After holding this language,\r\nthey spread before the eyes of the Indians fire-arms, woollen garments,\r\nkegs of brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, ear-rings, and\r\nlooking-glasses.[214] If, when they have beheld all these riches,\r\nthey still hesitate, it is insinuated that they have not the means of\r\nrefusing their required consent, and that the government itself will not\r\nlong have the power of protecting them in their rights. What are they to\r\ndo? Half convinced and half compelled, they go to inhabit new deserts,\r\nwhere the importunate whites will not let them remain ten years in\r\ntranquillity. In this manner do the Americans obtain at a very low\r\nprice whole provinces, which the richest sovereigns of Europe could not\r\npurchase.[215]\r\n\r\nThese are great evils, and it must be added that they appear to me to\r\nbe irremediable. I believe that the Indian nations of North America are\r\ndoomed to perish: and that whenever the Europeans shall be established\r\non the shores of the Pacific ocean, that race of men will be no\r\nmore.[216] The Indians had only the two alternatives of war or\r\ncivilization; in other words, they must either have destroyed the\r\nEuropeans or become their equals.\r\n\r\nAt the first settlement of the colonies they might have found it\r\npossible, by uniting their forces, to deliver themselves from the small\r\nbodies of strangers who landed on their continent.[217] They several\r\ntimes attempted to do it, and were on the point of succeeding; but the\r\ndisproportion of their resources, at the present day, when compared\r\nwith those of the whites, is too great to allow such an enterprise to\r\nbe thought of. Nevertheless, there do arise from time to time among the\r\nIndians men of penetration, who foresee the final destiny which awaits\r\nthe native population, and who exert themselves to unite all the tribes\r\nin common hostility to the Europeans; but their efforts are unavailing.\r\nThose tribes which are in the neighborhood of the whites are too much\r\nweakened to offer an effectual resistance; while the others, giving way\r\nto that childish carelessness of the morrow which characterizes savage\r\nlife, wait for the near approach of danger before they prepare to meet\r\nit: some are unable, the others are unwilling to exert themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to foresee that the Indians will never conform to\r\ncivilisation; or that it will be too late, whenever they may be inclined\r\nto make the experiment.\r\n\r\nCivilisation is the result of long social process which takes place in\r\nthe same spot, and is handed down from one generation to another, each\r\none profiting by the experience of the last. Of all nations, those\r\nsubmit to civilisation with the most difficulty, which habitually live\r\nby the chase. Pastoral tribes, indeed, often change their place of\r\nabode; but they follow in regular order in their migrations, and often\r\nreturn again to their old stations, while the dwelling of the hunter\r\nvaries with that of the animals he pursues.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to diffuse knowledge among the Indians,\r\nwithout controlling their wandering propensities; by the Jesuits in\r\nCanada, and by the puritans in New England;[218] but none of these\r\nendeavors were crowned by any lasting success. Civilisation began in the\r\ncabin, but it soon retired to expire in the woods; the great error of\r\nthese legislators of the Indians was their not understanding, that in\r\norder to succeed in civilizing a people, it is first necessary to fix\r\nit; which cannot be done without inducing it to cultivate the soil: the\r\nIndians ought in the first place to have been accustomed to agriculture.\r\nBut not only are they destitute of this indispensable preliminary to\r\ncivilisation, they would even have great difficulty in acquiring it. Men\r\nwho have once abandoned themselves to the restless and adventurous\r\nlife of the hunter, feel an insurmountable disgust for the constant and\r\nregular labor which tillage requires. We see this proved in the bosom\r\nof our own society; but it is far more visible among peoples whose\r\npartiality for the chase is a part of their natural character.\r\n\r\nIndependently of this general difficulty, there is another, which\r\napplies peculiarly to the Indians; they consider labor not merely as an\r\nevil, but as a disgrace; so that their pride prevents them from becoming\r\ncivilized, as much as their indolence.[219]\r\n\r\nThere is no Indian so wretched as not to retain, under his hut of bark,\r\na lofty idea of his personal worth; he considers the cares of industry\r\nand labor as degrading occupations, he compares the husbandman to the ox\r\nwhich traces the furrow; and even in our most ingenious handicraft,\r\nhe can see nothing but the labor of slaves. Not that he is devoid of\r\nadmiration for the power and intellectual greatness of the whites; but\r\nalthough the result of our efforts surprises him, he contemns the means\r\nby which we obtain it; and while he acknowledges our ascendency, he\r\nstill believes in his superiority. War and hunting are the only pursuits\r\nwhich appear to him worthy to be the occupations of a man.[220] The\r\nIndian, in the dreary solitude of his woods, cherishes the same ideas,\r\nthe same opinions, as the noble of the middle ages in his castle, and he\r\nonly requires to become a conqueror to complete the resemblance; thus,\r\nhowever strange it may seem, it is in the forests of the New World,\r\nand not among the Europeans who people its coasts, that the ancient\r\nprejudices of Europe are still in existence.\r\n\r\nMore than once, in the course of this work, I have endeavored to explain\r\nthe prodigious influence which the social condition appears to exercise\r\nupon the laws and the manners of men; and I beg to add a few words on\r\nthe same subject. When I perceive the resemblance which exists between\r\nthe political institutions of our ancestors, the Germans, and of the\r\nwandering tribes of North America: between the customs described by\r\nTacitus, and those of which I have sometimes been a witness, I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that the same cause has brought about the same results\r\nin both hemispheres; and that in the midst of the apparent diversity of\r\nhuman affairs, a certain number of primary facts may be discovered, from\r\nwhich all the others are derived. In what we usually call the German\r\ninstitutions, then, I am inclined only to perceive barbarian habits; and\r\nthe opinions of savages, in what we style feudal principles.\r\n\r\nHowever strongly the vices and prejudices of the North American Indians\r\nmay be opposed to their becoming agricultural and civilized, necessity\r\nsometimes obliges them to it. Several of the southern nations, and among\r\nthem the Cherokees and the Creeks,[221] were surrounded by Europeans,\r\nwho had landed on the shores of the Atlantic, and who, either descending\r\nthe Ohio or proceeding up the Mississippi, arrived simultaneously upon\r\ntheir borders. These tribes have not been driven from place to place,\r\nlike their northern brethren; but they have been gradually enclosed\r\nwithin narrow limits, like the game within the thicket before the\r\nhuntsmen plunge into the interior. The Indians, who were thus placed\r\nbetween civilisation and death, found themselves obliged to live by\r\nignominious labor like the whites. They took to agriculture, and without\r\nentirely forsaking their old habits or manners, sacrificed only as much\r\nas was necessary to their existence.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees went further; they created a written language; established\r\na permanent form of government; and as everything proceeds rapidly\r\nin the New World, before they had all of them clothes, they set up a\r\nnewspaper.[222]\r\n\r\nThe growth of European habits has been remarkably accelerated among\r\nthese Indians by the mixed race which has sprung up[223]: Deriving\r\nintelligence from the father's side, without entirely losing the savage\r\ncustoms of the mother, the half-blood forms the natural link between\r\ncivilisation and barbarism. Wherever this race has multiplied, the\r\nsavage state has become modified, and a great change has taken place in\r\nthe manners of the people.[224]\r\n\r\nThe success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are capable of\r\ncivilisation, but it does not prove that they will succeed in it. The\r\ndifficulty which the Indians find in submitting to civilisation proceeds\r\nfrom the influence of a general cause, which it is almost impossible\r\nfor them to escape. An attentive survey of history demonstrates that,\r\nin general, barbarous nations have raised themselves to civilisation by\r\ndegrees, and by their own efforts. Whenever they derived knowledge from\r\na foreign people, they stood toward it in the relation of conquerors,\r\nnot of a conquered nation. When the conquered nation is enlightened, and\r\nthe conquerors are half savage, as in the case of the invasion of Rome\r\nby the northern nations, or that of China by the Moguls, the power\r\nwhich victory bestows upon the barbarian is sufficient to keep up his\r\nimportance among civilized men, and permit him to rank as their equal,\r\nuntil he becomes their rival: the one has might on his side, the other\r\nhas intelligence; the former admires the knowledge and the arts of the\r\nconquered, the latter envies the power of the conquerors. The barbarians\r\nat length admit civilized man into their palaces, and he in turn opens\r\nhis schools to the barbarians. But when the side on which the physical\r\nforce lies, also possesses an intellectual preponderance, the conquered\r\nparty seldom becomes civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. It may\r\ntherefore be said, in a general way, that savages go forth in arms to\r\nseek knowledge, but that they do not receive it when it comes to them.\r\n\r\nIf the Indian tribes which now inhabit the heart of the continent could\r\nsummon up energy enough to attempt to civilize themselves, they might\r\npossibly succeed. Superior already to the barbarous nations which\r\nsurround them, they would gradually gain strength and experience; and\r\nwhen the Europeans should appear upon their borders, they would be in a\r\nstate, if not to maintain their independence, at least to assert their\r\nright to the soil, and to incorporate themselves with the conquerors.\r\nBut it is the misfortune of Indians to be brought into contact with a\r\ncivilized people, which is also (it may be owned) the most avaricious\r\nnation on the globe, while they are still semi-barbarian: to find\r\ndespots in their instructors, and to receive knowledge from the hand\r\nof oppression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North American\r\nIndian was destitute, but he had no feeling of inferiority toward any\r\none; as soon, however, as he desires to penetrate into the social\r\nscale of the whites, he takes the lowest rank in society, for he enters\r\nignorant and poor within the pale of science and wealth. After having\r\nled a life of agitation, beset with evils and dangers, but at the same\r\ntime filled with proud emotions,[225] he is obliged to submit to a\r\nwearisome, obscure, and degraded state, and to gain the bread which\r\nnourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his eyes the only\r\nresults of which civilisation can boast: and even this much he is not\r\nsure to obtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians undertake to imitate their European neighbors, and to\r\ntill the earth like the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a\r\nvery formidable competition. The white man is skilled in the craft of\r\nagriculture; the Indian is a rough beginner in an art with which he is\r\nunacquainted. The former reaps abundant crops without difficulty, the\r\nlatter meets with a thousand obstacles in raising the fruits of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe European is placed among a population whose wants he knows and\r\npartakes. The savage is isolated in the midst of a hostile people, with\r\nwhose manners, language and laws, he is imperfectly acquainted, but\r\nwithout whose assistance he cannot live. He can only procure the\r\nmaterials of comfort by bartering his commodities against the goods\r\nof the European, for the assistance of his countrymen is wholly\r\ninsufficient to supply his wants. When the Indian wishes to sell the\r\nproduce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser, while the\r\nEuropean readily finds a market; and the former can only produce at a\r\nconsiderable cost, that which the latter vends at a very low rate. Thus\r\nthe Indian has no sooner escaped those evils to which barbarous nations\r\nare exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of\r\ncivilized communities; and he finds it scarcely less difficult to live\r\nin the midst of our abundance, than in the depth of his own wilderness.\r\n\r\nHe has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the traditions of\r\nhis fathers and his passion for the chase are still alive within him.\r\nThe wild enjoyments which formerly animated him in the woods painfully\r\nexcite his troubled imagination; and his former privations appear to\r\nbe less keen, his former perils less appalling. He contrasts the\r\nindependence which he possessed among his equals with the servile\r\nposition which he occupies in civilized society. On the other hand,\r\nthe solitudes which were so long his free home are still at hand; a few\r\nhours' march will bring him back to them once more. The whites offer him\r\na sum, which seems to him to be considerable, for the ground which he\r\nhas begun to clear. This money of the Europeans may possibly furnish him\r\nwith the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remote regions;\r\nand he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns to the\r\nwilderness for ever.[226] The condition of the Creeks and Cherokees,\r\nto which I have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates the truth of\r\nthis deplorable picture.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, in the little which they have done, have unquestionably\r\ndisplayed as much natural genius as the peoples of Europe in their most\r\nimportant designs; but nations as well as men require time to learn,\r\nwhatever may be their intelligence and their zeal. While the savages\r\nwere engaged in the work of civilisation, the Europeans continued to\r\nsurround them on every side, and to confine them within narrower limits;\r\nthe two races gradually met, and they are now in immediate juxtaposition\r\nto each other. The Indian is already superior to his barbarous parent,\r\nbut he is still very far below his white neighbor. With their resources\r\nand acquired knowledge, the Europeans soon appropriated to themselves\r\nmost of the advantages which the natives might have derived from the\r\npossession of the soil: they have settled in the country, they have\r\npurchased land at a very low rate or have occupied it by force, and the\r\nIndians have been ruined by a competition which they had not the means\r\nof resisting. They were isolated in their own country, and their race\r\nonly constituted a colony of troublesome aliens in the midst of a\r\nnumerous and domineering people.[227]\r\n\r\nWashington said in one of his messages to congress, \"We are more\r\nenlightened and powerful than the Indian nations, we are therefore bound\r\nin honor to treat them with kindness and even with generosity.\" But this\r\nvirtuous and high-minded policy has not been followed. The rapacity\r\nof the settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the government.\r\nAlthough the Cherokees and the Creeks are established upon the territory\r\nwhich they inhabited before the settlement of the Europeans, and\r\nalthough the Americans have frequently treated with them as with foreign\r\nnations, the surrounding states have not consented to acknowledge them\r\nas an independent people, and attempts have been made to subject\r\nthese children of the woods to Anglo-American magistrates, laws, and\r\ncustoms.[228] Destitution had driven these unfortunate Indians to\r\ncivilisation, and oppression now drives them back to their former\r\ncondition; many of them abandon the soil which they had begun to clear,\r\nand return to their savage course of life.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the tyrannical measures which have been adopted by the\r\nlegislatures of the southern states, the conduct of their governors, and\r\nthe decrees of their courts of justice, we shall be convinced that the\r\nentire expulsion of the Indians is the final result to which the efforts\r\nof their policy are directed. The Americans of that part of the Union\r\nlook with jealousy upon the aborigines,[229] they are aware that these\r\ntribes have not yet lost the traditions of savage life, and before\r\ncivilisation has permanently fixed them to the soil, it is intended\r\nto force them to recede by reducing them to despair. The Creeks and\r\nCherokees, oppressed by the several states, have appealed to the central\r\ngovernment, which is by no means insensible to their misfortunes, and\r\nis sincerely desirous of saving the remnant of the natives, and of\r\nmaintaining them in the free possession of that territory which the\r\nUnion is pledged to respect.[230] But the several states oppose so\r\nformidable a resistance to the execution of this design, that the\r\ngovernment is obliged to consent to the extirpation of a few barbarous\r\ntribes in order not to endanger the safety of the American Union.\r\n\r\nBut the federal government, which is not able to protect the Indians,\r\nwould fain mitigate the hardships of their lot; and, with this\r\nintention, proposals have been made to transport them into more remote\r\nregions at the public cost.\r\n\r\nBetween the 33d and 37th degrees of north latitude, a vast tract of\r\ncountry lies, which has taken the name of Arkansas, from the principal\r\nriver that waters its extent. It is bounded on the one side by the\r\nconfines of Mexico, on the other by the Mississippi. Numberless\r\nstreams cross it in every direction; the climate is mild, and the\r\nsoil productive, but it is only inhabited by a few wandering hordes\r\nof savages. The government of the Union wishes to transport the broken\r\nremnants of the indigenous population of the south, to the portion of\r\nthis country which is nearest to Mexico, and at a great distance from\r\nthe American settlements.\r\n\r\nWe were assured, toward the end of the year 1831, that 10,000 Indians\r\nhad already gone to the shores of the Arkansas; and fresh detachments\r\nwere constantly following them; but congress has been unable to excite\r\na unanimous determination in those whom it is disposed to protect.\r\nSome, indeed, are willing to quit the seat of oppression, but the most\r\nenlightened members of the community refuse to abandon their recent\r\ndwellings and the springing crops; they are of opinion that the work of\r\ncivilisation, once interrupted, will never be resumed; they fear that\r\nthose domestic habits which have been so recently contracted, may be\r\nirrecoverably lost in the midst of a country which is still barbarous,\r\nand where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of an agricultural\r\npeople; they know that their entrance into those wilds will be opposed\r\nby inimical hordes, and that they have lost the energy of barbarians,\r\nwithout acquiring the resources of civilisation to resist their attacks.\r\nMoreover the Indians readily discover that the settlement which is\r\nproposed to them is merely a temporary expedient. Who can assure them\r\nthat they will at length be allowed to dwell in peace in their new\r\nretreat? The United States pledge themselves to the observance of the\r\nobligation; but the territory which they at present occupy was formerly\r\nsecured to them by the most solemn oaths of Anglo-American faith.[231]\r\nThe American government does not indeed rob them of their lands, but it\r\nallows perpetual incursions to be made on them. In a few years the same\r\nwhite population which now flocks around them, will track them to the\r\nsolitudes of the Arkansas, they will then be exposed to the same evils\r\nwithout the same remedies; and as the limits of the earth will at last\r\nfail them, their only refuge is the grave.\r\n\r\nThe Union treats the Indians with less cupidity and rigor than the\r\npolicy of the several states, but the two governments are alike\r\ndestitute of good faith. The states extend what they are pleased to term\r\nthe benefits of their laws to the Indians, with a belief that the\r\ntribes will recede rather than submit; and the central government, which\r\npromises a permanent refuge to these unhappy beings, is well aware of\r\nits inability to secure it to them.[232]\r\n\r\nThus the tyranny of the states obliges the savages to retire, the Union,\r\nby its promises and resources facilitates their retreat; and these\r\nmeasures tend to precisely the same end.[233] \"By the will of our Father\r\nin heaven, the governor of the whole world,\" said the Cherokees in their\r\npetition to congress,[234] \"the red man of America has become small, and\r\nthe white man great and renowned. When the ancestors of the people of\r\nthese United States first came to the shores of America, they found the\r\nred man strong: though he was ignorant and savage, yet he received them\r\nkindly, and gave them dry land to rest their weary feet. They met in\r\npeace, and shook hands in token of friendship. Whatever the white man\r\nwanted and asked of the Indian, the latter willingly gave. At that time\r\nthe Indian was the lord, and the white man the suppliant. But now the\r\nscene has changed. The strength of the red man has become weakness. As\r\nhis neighbors increased in numbers, his power became less and less, and\r\nnow, of the many and powerful tribes who once covered the United States,\r\nonly a few are to be seen--a few whom a sweeping pestilence had left.\r\nThe northern tribes, who were once so numerous and powerful, are now\r\nnearly extinct. Thus it has happened to the red man of America. Shall\r\nwe, who are remnants, share the same fate?\r\n\r\n\"The land on which we stand we have received as an inheritance from our\r\nfathers who possessed it from time immemorial, as a gift from our common\r\nFather in heaven. They bequeathed it to us as their children, and\r\nwe have sacredly kept it, as containing their remains. This right of\r\ninheritance we have never ceded, nor ever forfeited. Permit us to ask\r\nwhat better right can the people have to a country than the right of\r\ninheritance and immemorial peaceable possession? We know it is said of\r\nlate by the state of Georgia and by the executive of the United States,\r\nthat we have forfeited this right; but we think it is said gratuitously.\r\nAt what time have we made the forfeit? What great crime have we\r\ncommitted, whereby we must for ever be divested of our country and\r\nrights? Was it when we were hostile to the United States, and took part\r\nwith the king of Great Britain, during the struggle for independence?\r\nIf so, why was not this forfeiture declared in the first treaty which\r\nfollowed that war? Why was not such an article as the following inserted\r\nin the treaty: 'The United States give peace to the Cherokees, but for\r\nthe part they took in the last war, declare them to be but tenants at\r\nwill, to be removed when the convenience of the states, within whose\r\nchartered limits they live, shall require it?' That was the proper time\r\nto assume such a possession. But it was not thought of, nor would our\r\nforefathers have agreed to any treaty, whose tendency was to deprive\r\nthem of their rights and their country.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the language of the Indians: their assertions are true, their\r\nforebodings inevitable. From whichever side we consider the destinies\r\nof the aborigines of North America, their calamities appear to be\r\nirremediable: if they continue barbarous, they are forced to retire: if\r\nthey attempt to civilize their manners, the contact of a more civilized\r\ncommunity subjects them to oppression and destitution. They perish if\r\nthey continue to wander from waste to waste, and if they attempt to\r\nsettle, they still must perish; the assistance of Europeans is necessary\r\nto instruct them, but the approach of Europeans corrupts and repels them\r\ninto savage life; they refuse to change their habits as long as their\r\nsolitudes are their own, and it is too late to change them when they are\r\nconstrained to submit.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards pursued the Indians with blood-hounds, like wild beasts;\r\nand they sacked the New World with no more temper or compassion than a\r\ncity taken by storm: but destruction must cease, and phrensy be stayed;\r\nthe remnant of the Indian population, which had escaped the massacre,\r\nmixed with its conquerors and adopted their religion and manners.[235]\r\nThe conduct of the Americans of the United States towards the aborigines\r\nis characterized, on the other hand, by a singular attachment to the\r\nformalities of law. Provided that the Indians retain their barbarous\r\ncondition, the Americans take no part in their affairs: they treat them\r\nas independent nations, and do not possess themselves of their hunting\r\ngrounds without a treaty of purchase; and if an Indian nation happens\r\nto be so encroached upon as to be unable to subsist upon its territory,\r\nthey afford it brotherly assistance in transporting it to a grave\r\nsufficiently remote from the land of its fathers.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were unable to exterminate the Indian race by those\r\nunparalleled atrocities which brand them with indelible shame, nor\r\ndid they even succeed in wholly depriving it of its rights; but the\r\nAmericans of the United States have accomplished this twofold purpose\r\nwith singular felicity; tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without\r\nshedding blood, and without violating a single great principle of\r\nmorality in the eyes of the world.[236] It is impossible to destroy men\r\nwith more respect for the laws of humanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSITUATION OF THE BLACK POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, AND DANGERS WITH\r\nWHICH ITS PRESENCE THREATENS THE WHITES.\r\n\r\nWhy it is more difficult to abolish Slavery, and to efface all Vestiges\r\nof it among the Moderns, than it was among the Ancients.--In the United\r\nStates the prejudices of the Whites against the Blacks seem to increase\r\nin Proportion as Slavery is abolished.--Situation of the Negroes in\r\nthe Northern and Southern States.--Why the Americans abolish\r\nSlavery.--Servitude, which debases the Slave, impoverishes the\r\nMaster.--Contrast between the left and the right Bank of the Ohio.--To\r\nwhat attributable.--The black Race, as well as Slavery, recedes toward\r\nthe South.--Explanation of this fact.--Difficulties attendant upon\r\nthe Abolition of Slavery in the South.--Dangers to come.--General\r\nAnxiety.--Foundation of a black Colony in Africa.--Why the Americans of\r\nthe South increase the Hardships of Slavery, while they are distressed\r\nat its Continuance.\r\n\r\nThe Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in which they\r\nhave lived; but the destiny of the negroes is in some measure interwoven\r\nwith that of the Europeans. These two races are attached to each other\r\nwithout intermingling; and they are alike unable entirely to separate\r\nor to combine. The most formidable of all the ills which threaten the\r\nfuture existence of the United States, arises from the presence of a\r\nblack population upon its territory; and in contemplating the causes\r\nof the present embarrassments or of the future dangers of the United\r\nStates, the observer is invariably led to consider this as a primary\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe permanent evils to which mankind is subjected are usually produced\r\nby the vehement or the increasing efforts of men; but there is one\r\ncalamity which penetrated furtively into the world, and which was at\r\nfirst scarcely distinguishable amid the ordinary abuses of power: it\r\noriginated with an individual whose name history has not preserved; it\r\nwas wafted like some accursed germ upon a portion of the soil, but it\r\nafterward nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spreads naturally\r\nwith the society to which it belongs. I need scarcely add that this\r\ncalamity is slavery. Christianity suppressed slavery, but the Christians\r\nof the sixteenth century re-established it--as an exception, indeed, to\r\ntheir social system, and restricted to one of the races of mankind; but\r\nthe wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though less extensive, was at\r\nthe same time rendered far more difficult of cure.\r\n\r\nIt is important to make an accurate distinction between slavery itself\r\nand its consequences. The immediate evils which are produced by slavery\r\nwere very nearly the same in antiquity as they are among the moderns;\r\nbut the consequences of these evils were different. The slave, among the\r\nancients, belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often the\r\nsuperior of the two in education[237] and instruction. Freedom was the\r\nonly distinction between them; and when freedom was conferred, they were\r\neasily confounded together. The ancients, then, had a very simple\r\nmeans of avoiding slavery and its evil consequences, which was that of\r\nenfranchisement; and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this\r\nmeasure generally. Not but, in ancient states, the vestiges of servitude\r\nsubsisted for some time after servitude was abolished. There is a\r\nnatural prejudice which prompts men to despise whomsoever has been their\r\ninferior, long after he has become their equal; and the real inequality\r\nwhich is produced by fortune or by law, is always succeeded by an\r\nimaginary inequality which is implanted in the manners of the people.\r\nNevertheless, this secondary consequence of slavery was limited to\r\na certain term among the ancients; for the freedman bore so entire\r\na resemblance to those born free, that it soon became impossible to\r\ndistinguish him from among them.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the law;\r\namong the moderns it is of altering the manners; and, as far as we are\r\nconcerned, the real obstacles begin where those of the ancients left\r\noff. This arises from the circumstance that, among the moderns, the\r\nabstract and transient fact of slavery is fatally united to the physical\r\nand permanent fact of color. The tradition of slavery dishonors the\r\nrace, and the peculiarity of the race perpetuates the tradition of\r\nslavery. No African has ever voluntarily emigrated to the shores of the\r\nNew World; whence it must be inferred, that all the blacks who are now\r\nto be found in that hemisphere are either slaves or freedmen. Thus the\r\nnegro transmits the eternal mark of his ignominy to all his descendants;\r\nand although the law may abolish slavery, God alone can obliterate the\r\ntraces of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe modern slave differs from his master not only in his condition,\r\nbut in his origin. You may set the negro free, but you cannot make him\r\notherwise than an alien to the European. Nor is this all; we scarcely\r\nacknowledge the common features of mankind in this child of debasement\r\nwhom slavery has brought among us. His physiognomy is to our eyes\r\nhideous, his understanding weak, his tastes low; and we are almost\r\ninclined to look upon him as a being intermediate between man and the\r\nbrutes.[238] The moderns, then, after they have abolished slavery, have\r\nthree prejudices to contend against, which are less easy to attack, and\r\nfar less easy to conquer, than the mere fact of servitude: the prejudice\r\nof the master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice of color.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born among\r\nmen like ourselves by nature, and equal to ourselves by law, to conceive\r\nthe irreconcilable differences which separate the negro from the\r\nEuropean in America. But we may derive some faint notion of them from\r\nanalogy. France was formerly a country in which numerous distinctions of\r\nrank existed, that had been created by the legislation. Nothing can be\r\nmore fictitious than a purely legal inferiority; nothing more contrary\r\nto the instinct of mankind than these permanent divisions which had\r\nbeen established between beings evidently similar. Nevertheless these\r\ndivisions subsisted for ages; they still subsist in many places; and\r\non all sides they have left imaginary vestiges, which time alone can\r\nefface. If it be so difficult to root out an inequality which solely\r\noriginates in the law, how are those distinctions to be destroyed which\r\nseem to be founded upon the immutable laws of nature herself? When\r\nI remember the extreme difficulty with which aristocratic bodies, of\r\nwhatever nature they may be, are commingled with the mass of the people;\r\nand the exceeding care which they take to preserve the ideal boundaries\r\nof their caste inviolate, I despair of seeing an aristocracy disappear\r\nwhich is founded upon visible and indelible signs. Those who hope that\r\nthe Europeans will ever mix with the negroes, appear to me to delude\r\nthemselves; and I am not led to any such conclusion by my own reason, or\r\nby the evidence of facts.\r\n\r\nHitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have\r\nmaintained the blacks in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever\r\nthe negroes have been strongest, they have destroyed the whites; such\r\nhas been the only course of events which has ever taken place between\r\nthe two races.\r\n\r\nI see that in a certain portion of the territory of the United States\r\nat the present day, the legal barrier which separated the two races is\r\ntending to fall away, but not that which exists in the manners of the\r\ncountry; slavery recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth\r\nremains stationary. Whosoever has inhabited the United States, must have\r\nperceived, that in those parts of the Union in which the negroes are no\r\nlonger slaves, they have in nowise drawn nearer to the whites. On the\r\ncontrary, the prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in the states\r\nwhich have abolished slavery, than in those where it still exists; and\r\nnowhere is it so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never\r\nbeen known.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in the north of the Union, marriages may be legally\r\ncontracted between negroes and whites, but public opinion would\r\nstigmatize a man who should connect himself with a negress as infamous,\r\nand it would be difficult to meet with a single instance of such a\r\nunion. The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in\r\nalmost all the States in which slavery has been abolished; but if they\r\ncome forward to vote, their lives are in danger. If oppressed, they may\r\nbring an action at law, but they will find none but whites among\r\ntheir judges; and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice\r\nrepulses them from that office. The same schools do not receive the\r\nchild of the black and of the European. In the theatres, gold cannot\r\nprocure a seat for the servile race beside their former masters; in the\r\nhospitals they lie apart; and although they are allowed to invoke the\r\nsame Divinity as the whites, it must be at a different altar, and in\r\ntheir own churches, with their own clergy. The gates of heaven are not\r\nclosed against these unhappy beings; but their inferiority is continued\r\nto the very confines of the other world. When the negro is defunct, his\r\nbones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition prevails even in\r\nthe equality of death. The negro is free, but he can share neither the\r\nrights, nor the pleasure, nor the labor, nor the afflictions, nor the\r\ntomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet\r\nhim upon fair terms in life or in death.\r\n\r\nIn the south, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less carefully\r\nkept apart; they sometimes share the labor and the recreations of the\r\nwhites; the whites consent to intermix with them to a certain extent,\r\nand although the legislation treats them more harshly, the habits of the\r\npeople are more tolerant and compassionate. In the south the master is\r\nnot afraid to raise his slave to his own standing, because he knows that\r\nhe can in a moment reduce him to the dust at pleasure. In the north,\r\nthe white no longer distinctly perceives the barrier which separates\r\nhim from the degraded race, and he shuns the negro with the more\r\npertinacity, because he fears lest they should be some day confounded\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAmong the Americans of the south, nature sometimes reasserts her rights,\r\nand restores a transient equality between the blacks and the whites; but\r\nin the north, pride restrains the most imperious of human passions. The\r\nAmerican of the northern states would perhaps allow the negress to share\r\nhis licentious pleasures, if the laws of his country did not declare\r\nthat she may aspire to be the legitimate partner of his bed; but he\r\nrecoils with horror from her who might become his wife.\r\n\r\nThus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which repels the\r\nnegroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated, and\r\ninequality is sanctioned by the manners while it is effaced from the\r\nlaws of the country. But if the relative position of the two races which\r\ninhabit the United States, is such as I have described, it may be asked\r\nwhy the Americans have abolished slavery in the north of the Union,\r\nwhy they maintain it in the south, and why they aggravate its hardships\r\nthere? The answer is easily given. It is not for the good of the\r\nnegroes, but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to abolish\r\nslavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first negroes were imported into Virginia about the year 1621.[239]\r\nIn America, therefore, as well as in the rest of the globe, slavery\r\noriginated in the south. Thence it spread from one settlement to\r\nanother; but the number of slaves diminished toward the northern states,\r\nand the negro population was always very limited in New England.[240]\r\n\r\nA century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies,\r\nwhen the attention of the planters was struck by the extraordinary\r\nfact, that the provinces which were comparatively destitute of slaves,\r\nincreased in population, in wealth, and in prosperity, more rapidly than\r\nthose which contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former,\r\nhowever, the inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves,\r\nor by hired laborers; in the latter, they were furnished with hands for\r\nwhich they paid no wages; yet, although labor and expense were on\r\nthe one side, and ease with economy on the other, the former were in\r\npossession of the most advantageous system. This consequence seemed to\r\nbe the more difficult to explain, since the settlers, who all belonged\r\nto the same European race, had the same habits, the same civilisation,\r\nthe same laws, and their shades of difference were extremely slight.\r\n\r\nTime, however, continued to advance; and the Anglo Americans, spreading\r\nbeyond the coasts of the Atlantic ocean, penetrated farther and farther\r\ninto the solitudes of the west; they met with a new soil and an unwonted\r\nclimate; the obstacles which opposed them were of the most various\r\ncharacter; their races intermingled, the inhabitants of the south went\r\nup toward the north, those of the north descended to the south; but in\r\nthe midst of all these causes, the same result recurred at every step;\r\nand in general, the colonies in which there were no slaves became more\r\npopulous and more rich than those in which slavery flourished. The more\r\nprogress was made, the more was it shown that slavery, which is so cruel\r\nto the slave, is prejudicial to the master.\r\n\r\nBut this truth was most satisfactorily demonstrated when civilisation\r\nreached the banks of the Ohio. The stream which the Indians had\r\ndistinguished by the name of Ohio, or Beautiful river, waters one of\r\nthe most magnificent valleys which have ever been made the abode of man.\r\nUndulating lands extend upon both shores of the Ohio, whose soil affords\r\ninexhaustible treasures to the laborer; on either bank the air is\r\nwholesome and the climate mild; and each of them forms the extreme\r\nfrontier of a vast state: that which follows the numerous windings of\r\nthe Ohio upon the left is called Kentucky; that upon the right bears\r\nthe name of the river. These two states only differ in a single respect;\r\nKentucky has admitted slavery, but the state of Ohio has prohibited the\r\nexistence of slaves within its borders.[241]\r\n\r\nThus the traveller who floats down the current of the Ohio, to the spot\r\nwhere that river falls into the Mississippi, may be said to sail between\r\nliberty and servitude; and a transient inspection of the surrounding\r\nobjects will convince him which of the two is most favorable to mankind.\r\n\r\nUpon the left bank of the stream the population is rare; from time to\r\ntime one descries a troop of slaves loitering in the half-desert fields;\r\nthe primeval forest recurs at every turn; society seems to be asleep,\r\nman to be idle, and nature alone offers a scene of activity and of life.\r\n\r\nFrom the right bank, on the contrary, a confused hum is heard, which\r\nproclaims the presence of industry; the fields are covered with abundant\r\nharvests; the elegance of the dwellings announces the taste and activity\r\nof the laborer; and man appears to be in the enjoyment of that wealth\r\nand contentment which are the reward of labor.[242]\r\n\r\nThe state of Kentucky was founded in 1775, the state of Ohio only twelve\r\nyears later; but twelve years are more in America than half a century in\r\nEurope, and, at the present day, the population of Ohio exceeds that of\r\nKentucky by 250,000 souls.[243] These opposite consequences of slavery\r\nand freedom may readily be understood; and they suffice to explain many\r\nof the differences which we remark between the civilisation of antiquity\r\nand that of our own time.\r\n\r\nUpon the left bank of the Ohio labor is confounded with the idea of\r\nslavery, upon the right bank it is identified with that of prosperity\r\nand improvement; on the one side it is degraded, on the other it is\r\nhonored; on the former territory no white laborers can be found, for\r\nthey would be afraid of assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the\r\nlatter no one is idle, for the white population extends its activity and\r\nits intelligence to every kind of employment. Thus the men whose task\r\nit is to cultivate the rich soil of Kentucky are ignorant and lukewarm;\r\nwhile those who are active and enlightened either do nothing, or pass\r\nover into the state of Ohio, where they may work without dishonor.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in Kentucky the planters are not obliged to pay wages\r\nto the slaves whom they employ; but they derive small profits from\r\ntheir labor, while the wages paid to free workmen would be returned with\r\ninterest in the value of their services. The free workman is paid, but\r\nhe does his work quicker than the slave; and rapidity of execution is\r\none of the great elements of economy. The white sells his services, but\r\nthey are only purchased at the times at which they may be useful; the\r\nblack can claim no remuneration for his toil, but the expense of his\r\nmaintenance is perpetual; he must be supported in his old age as well\r\nas in the prime of manhood, in his profitless infancy as well as in\r\nthe productive years of youth. Payment must equally be made in order to\r\nobtain the services of either class of men; the free workman receives\r\nhis wages in money; the slave in education, in food, in care, and in\r\nclothing. The money which a master spends in the maintenance of his\r\nslaves, goes gradually and in detail, so that it is scarcely perceived;\r\nthe salary of the free workman is paid in a round sum, which appears\r\nonly to enrich the individual who receives it; but in the end the\r\nslave has cost more than the free servant, and his labor is less\r\nproductive.[244]\r\n\r\nThe influence of slavery extends still farther; it affects the character\r\nof the master, and imparts a peculiar tendency to his ideas and his\r\ntastes. Upon both banks of the Ohio, the character of the inhabitants is\r\nenterprising and energetic; but this vigor is very differently exercised\r\nin the two states. The white inhabitant of Ohio, who is obliged to\r\nsubsist by his own exertions, regards temporal prosperity as the\r\nprincipal aim of his existence; and as the country which he occupies\r\npresents inexhaustible resources to his industry, and ever-varying lures\r\nto his activity, his acquisitive ardor surpasses the ordinary limits of\r\nhuman cupidity: he is tormented by the desire of wealth, and he boldly\r\nenters upon every path which fortune opens to him; he becomes a sailor,\r\npioneer, an artisan, or a laborer, with the same indifference, and he\r\nsupports, with equal constancy, the fatigues and the dangers incidental\r\nto these various professions; the resources of his intelligence are\r\nastonishing, and his avidity in the pursuit of gain amounts to a species\r\nof heroism.\r\n\r\nBut the Kentuckian scorns not only labor, but all the undertakings which\r\nlabor promotes; as he lives in an idle independence, his tastes are\r\nthose of an idle man; money loses a portion of its value in his eyes;\r\nhe covets wealth much less than pleasure and excitement; and the energy\r\nwhich his neighbor devotes to gain, turns with him to a passionate love\r\nof field sports and military exercises; he delights in violent bodily\r\nexertion, he is familiar with the use of arms, and is accustomed from\r\na very early age to expose his life in single combat. Thus slavery not\r\nonly prevents the whites from becoming opulent, but even from desiring\r\nto become so.\r\n\r\nAs the same causes have been continually producing opposite effects for\r\nthe last two centuries in the British colonies of North America, they\r\nhave established a very striking difference between the commercial\r\ncapacity of the inhabitants of the south and that of the north. At the\r\npresent day, it is only the northern states which are in possession\r\nof shipping, manufactures, railroads, and canals. This difference is\r\nperceptible not only in comparing the north with the south, but in\r\ncomparing the several southern states. Almost all the individuals who\r\ncarry on commercial operations, or who endeavor to turn slave-labor to\r\naccount in the most southern districts of the Union, have emigrated from\r\nthe north. The natives of the northern states are constantly spreading\r\nover that portion of the American territory, where they have less to\r\nfear from competition; they discover resources there, which escaped the\r\nnotice of the inhabitants; and, as they comply with a system which they\r\ndo not approve, they succeed in turning it to better advantage than\r\nthose who first founded, and who still maintain it.\r\n\r\nWere I inclined to continue this parallel, I could easily prove that\r\nalmost all the differences, which may be remarked between the characters\r\nof the Americans in the southern and in the northern states, have\r\noriginated in slavery; but this would divert me from my subject, and my\r\npresent intention is not to point out all the consequences of servitude,\r\nbut those effects which it has produced upon the prosperity of the\r\ncountries which have admitted it.\r\n\r\nThe influence of slavery upon the production of wealth must have been\r\nvery imperfectly known in antiquity, as slavery then obtained throughout\r\nthe civilized world, and the nations which were unacquainted with\r\nit were barbarous. And indeed Christianity only abolished slavery\r\nby advocating the claims of the slave; at the present time it may be\r\nattacked in the name of the master; and, upon this point, interest is\r\nreconciled with morality.\r\n\r\nAs these truths became apparent in the United States, slavery receded\r\nbefore the progress of experience. Servitude had begun in the south, and\r\nhad thence spread toward the north; but it now retires again. Freedom,\r\nwhich started from the north, now descends uninterruptedly toward the\r\nsouth. Among the great states, Pennsylvania now constitutes the\r\nextreme limit of slavery to the north; but even within those limits\r\nthe slave-system is shaken; Maryland, which is immediately below\r\nPennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and Virginia, which\r\ncomes next to Maryland, is already discussing its utility and its\r\ndangers.[245]\r\n\r\nNo great change takes place in human institutions, without involving\r\namong its causes the law of inheritance. When the law of primogeniture\r\nobtained in the south, each family was represented by a wealthy\r\nindividual, who was neither compelled nor induced to labor; and he was\r\nsurrounded, as by parasitic plants, by the other members of his family,\r\nwho were then excluded by law from sharing the common inheritance,\r\nand who led the same kind of life as himself. The very same thing then\r\noccurred in all the families of the south that still happens in the\r\nwealthy families of some countries in Europe, namely, that the younger\r\nsons remain in the same state of idleness as their elder brother,\r\nwithout being as rich as he is. This identical result seems to be\r\nproduced in Europe and in America by wholly analogous causes. In\r\nthe south of the United States, the whole race of whites formed an\r\naristocratic body, which was headed by a certain number of privileged\r\nindividuals, whose wealth was permanent, and whose leisure was\r\nhereditary. These leaders of the American nobility kept alive the\r\ntraditional prejudices of the white race in the body of which they were\r\nthe representatives, and maintained the honor of inactive life. This\r\naristocracy contained many who were poor, but none who would work; its\r\nmembers preferred want to labor; consequently no competition was set on\r\nfoot against negro laborers and slaves, and whatever opinion might be\r\nentertained as to the utility of their efforts, it was indispensable to\r\nemploy them, since there was no one else to work.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the law of primogeniture abolished than fortunes began\r\nto diminish, and all the families of the country were simultaneously\r\nreduced to a state in which labor became necessary to procure the means\r\nof subsistence: several of them have since entirely disappeared; and\r\nall of them learned to look forward to the time at which it would\r\nbe necessary for every one to provide for his own wants. Wealthy\r\nindividuals are still to be met with, but they no longer constitute a\r\ncompact and hereditary body, nor have they been able to adopt a line of\r\nconduct in which they could persevere, and which they could infuse into\r\nall ranks of society. The prejudice which stigmatized labor was in the\r\nfirst place abandoned by common consent; the number of needy men was\r\nincreased, and the needy were allowed to gain a laborious subsistence\r\nwithout blushing for their exertions. Thus one of the most immediate\r\nconsequences of the partible quality of estates has been to create a\r\nclass of free laborers. As soon as a competition was set on foot between\r\nthe free laborer and the slave, the inferiority of the latter became\r\nmanifest, and slavery was attacked in its fundamental principles, which\r\nis, the interest of the master.\r\n\r\nAs slavery recedes, the black population follows its retrograde course,\r\nand returns with it to those tropical regions from which it originally\r\ncame. However singular this fact may at first appear to be, it may\r\nreadily be explained. Although the Americans abolish the principle of\r\nslavery, they do not set their slaves free. To illustrate this remark I\r\nwill quote the example of the state of New York. In 1788, the state of\r\nNew York prohibited the sale of slaves within its limits; which was an\r\nindirect method of prohibiting the importation of blacks. Thenceforward\r\nthe number of negroes could only increase according to the ratio of the\r\nnatural increase of population. But eight years later a more decisive\r\nmeasure was taken, and it was enacted that all children born of slave\r\nparents after the 4th of July, 1799, should be free. No increase could\r\nthen take place, and although slaves still existed, slavery might be\r\nsaid to be abolished.\r\n\r\nFrom the time at which a northern state prohibited the importation of\r\nslaves, no slaves were brought from the south to be sold in its markets.\r\nOn the other hand, as the sale of slaves was forbidden in that state,\r\nan owner was no longer able to get rid of his slaves (who thus became a\r\nburdensome possession) otherwise than by transporting him to the south.\r\nBut when a northern state declared that the son of the slave should be\r\nborn free, the slave lost a large portion of his market value, since his\r\nposterity was no longer included in the bargain, and the owner had then\r\na strong interest in transporting him to the south. Thus the same law\r\nprevents the slaves of the south from coming to the northern states, and\r\ndrives those of the north to the south.\r\n\r\nThe want of free hands is felt in a state in proportion as the number of\r\nslaves decreases. But in proportion as labor is performed by free hands,\r\nslave-labor becomes less productive; and the slave is then a useless or\r\nan onerous possession, whom it is important to export to those southern\r\nstates where the same competition is not to be feared. Thus the\r\nabolition of slavery does not set the slave free, but it merely\r\ntransfers him from one master to another, and from the north to the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe emancipated negroes, and those born after the abolition of slavery,\r\ndo not, indeed, migrate from the north to the south; but their situation\r\nwith regard to the Europeans is not unlike that of the aborigines of\r\nAmerica; they remain half civilized, and deprived of their rights in\r\nthe midst of a population which is far superior to them in wealth and in\r\nknowledge; where they are exposed to the tyranny of the laws,[246] and\r\nthe intolerance of the people. On some accounts they are still more to\r\nbe pitied than the Indians, since they are haunted by the reminiscence\r\nof slavery, and they cannot claim possession of a single portion of the\r\nsoil: many of them perish miserably,[247] and the rest congregate in the\r\ngreat towns, where they perform the meanest offices, and lead a wretched\r\nand precarious existence.\r\n\r\nBut even if the number of negroes continued to increase as rapidly as\r\nwhen they were still in a state of slavery, as the number of whites\r\naugments with twofold rapidity since the abolition of slavery, the\r\nblacks would soon be, as it were, lost in the midst of a strange\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nA district which is cultivated by slaves is in general more scantily\r\npeopled than a district cultivated by free labor: moreover, America is\r\nstill a new country, and a state is therefore not half peopled at the\r\ntime when it abolished slavery. No sooner is an end put to slavery, than\r\nthe want of free labor is felt, and a crowd of enterprising adventurers\r\nimmediately arrive from all parts of the country, who hasten to profit\r\nby the fresh resources which are then opened to industry. The soil is\r\nsoon divided among them, and a family of white settlers takes possession\r\nof each tract of country. Besides which, European emigration is\r\nexclusively directed to the free states; for what would be the fate of a\r\npoor emigrant who crosses the Atlantic in search of ease and happiness,\r\nif he were to land in a country where labor is stigmatized as degrading?\r\n\r\nThus the white population grows by its natural increase, and at the\r\nsame time by the immense influx of emigrants; while the black population\r\nreceives no emigrants, and is upon its decline. The proportion which\r\nexisted between the two races is soon inverted. The negroes constitute a\r\nscanty remnant, a poor tribe of vagrants, which is lost in the midst of\r\nan immense people in full possession of the land; and the presence of\r\nthe blacks is only marked by the injustice and the hardships of which\r\nthey are the unhappy victims.\r\n\r\nIn several of the western states the negro race never made its\r\nappearance; and in all the northern states it is rapidly declining. Thus\r\nthe great question of its future condition is confined within a narrow\r\ncircle, where it becomes less formidable, though not more easy of\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe more we descend toward the south, the more difficult does it become\r\nto abolish slavery with advantage: and this arises from several physical\r\ncauses, which it is important to point out.\r\n\r\nThe first of these causes is the climate: it is well known that in\r\nproportion as Europeans approach the tropics, they suffer more from\r\nlabor. Many of the Americans even assert, that within a certain latitude\r\nthe exertions which a negro can make without danger are fatal to\r\nthem;[248] but I do not think that this opinion, which is so favorable\r\nto the indolence of the inhabitants of southern regions, is confirmed\r\nby experience. The southern parts of the Union are not hotter than the\r\nsouth of Italy and of Spain;[249] and it may be asked why the European\r\ncannot work as well there as in the two latter countries. If slavery has\r\nbeen abolished in Italy and in Spain without causing the destruction of\r\nthe masters, why should not the same thing take place in the Union? I\r\ncannot believe that Nature has prohibited the Europeans in Georgia and\r\nthe Floridas, under pain of death, from raising the means of subsistence\r\nfrom the soil; but their labor would unquestionably be more irksome and\r\nless productive[250] to them than the inhabitants of New England. As the\r\nfree workman thus loses a portion of his superiority over the slave in\r\nthe southern states, there are fewer inducements to abolish slavery.\r\n\r\nAll the plants of Europe grow in the northern parts of the Union; the\r\nsouth has special productions of its own. It has been observed that\r\nslave labor is a very expensive method of cultivating corn. The farmer\r\nof corn-land in a country where slavery is unknown, habitually retains a\r\nsmall number of laborers in his service, and at seed-time and harvest\r\nhe hires several additional hands, who only live at his cost for a short\r\nperiod. But the agriculturist in a slave state is obliged to keep a\r\nlarge number of slaves the whole year round, in order to sow his fields\r\nand to gather in his crops, although their services are only required\r\nfor a few weeks; but slaves are unable to wait till they are hired, and\r\nto subsist by their own labor in the meantime like free laborers;\r\nin order to have their services, they must be bought. Slavery,\r\nindependently of its general disadvantages, is therefore still more\r\ninapplicable to countries in which corn is cultivated than to those\r\nwhich produce crops of a different kind.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco, of cotton, and especially of the sugar-cane,\r\ndemands, on the other hand, unremitting attention: and women and\r\nchildren are employed in it, whose services are of but little use in\r\nthe cultivation of wheat. Thus slavery is naturally more fitted to the\r\ncountries from which these productions are derived.\r\n\r\nTobacco, cotton, and the sugar-cane, are exclusively grown in the\r\nsouth, and they form one of the principal sources of the wealth of those\r\nstates. If slavery were abolished, the inhabitants of the south would\r\nbe constrained to adopt one of two alternatives: they must either change\r\ntheir system of cultivation, and then they would come into competition\r\nwith the more active and more experienced inhabitants of the north; or,\r\nif they continued to cultivate the same produce without slave labor,\r\nthey would have to support the competition of the other states of the\r\nsouth, which might still retain their slaves. Thus, peculiar reasons\r\nfor maintaining slavery exist in the south which do not operate in the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another motive which is more cogent than all the\r\nothers; the south might indeed, rigorously speaking, abolish slavery,\r\nbut how should it rid its territory of the black population? Slaves\r\nand slavery are driven from the north by the same law, but this twofold\r\nresult cannot be hoped for in the south.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which I have adduced to show that slavery is more natural\r\nand more advantageous in the south than in the north, sufficiently prove\r\nthat the number of slaves must be far greater in the former districts.\r\nIt was to the southern settlements that the first Africans were brought,\r\nand it is there that the greatest number of them have always been\r\nimported. As we advance toward the south, the prejudice which sanctions\r\nidleness increases in power. In the states nearest to the tropics there\r\nis not a single white laborer; the negroes are consequently much\r\nmore numerous in the south than in the north. And, as I have already\r\nobserved, this disproportion increases daily, since the negroes are\r\ntransferred to one part of the Union as soon as slavery is abolished in\r\nthe other. Thus the black population augments in the south, not only by\r\nits natural fecundity, but by the compulsory emigration of the negroes\r\nfrom the north; and the African race has causes of increase in the south\r\nvery analogous to those which so powerfully accelerate the growth of the\r\nEuropean race in the north.\r\n\r\nIn the state of Maine there is one negro in three hundred inhabitants;\r\nin Massachusetts, one in one hundred; in New York, two in one hundred;\r\nin Pennsylvania, three in the same number; in Maryland, thirty-four;\r\nin Virginia, forty-two; and lastly, in South Carolina, fifty-five per\r\ncent.[251] Such was the proportion of the black population to the whites\r\nin the year 1830. But this proportion is perpetually changing, as it\r\nconstantly decreases in the north and augments in the south.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the most southern states of the Union cannot abolish\r\nslavery without incurring very great dangers, which the north had no\r\nreason to apprehend when it emancipated its black population. We\r\nhave already shown the system by which the northern states secure the\r\ntransition from slavery to freedom, by keeping the present generation\r\nin chains, and setting their descendants free; by this means the negroes\r\nare gradually introduced into society; and while the men who might\r\nabuse their freedom are kept in a state of servitude, those who are\r\nemancipated may learn the art of being free before they become their own\r\nmasters. But it would be difficult to apply this method in the south. To\r\ndeclare that all the negroes born after a certain period shall be free,\r\nis to introduce the principle and the notion of liberty into the heart\r\nof slavery; the blacks, whom the law thus maintains in a state of\r\nslavery from which their children are delivered, are astonished at so\r\nunequal a fate, and their astonishment is only the prelude to their\r\nimpatience and irritation. Thenceforward slavery loses in their eyes\r\nthat kind of moral power which it derived from time and habit; it is\r\nreduced to a mere palpable abuse of force. The northern states had\r\nnothing to fear from the contrast, because in them the blacks were few\r\nin number, and the white population was very considerable. But if\r\nthis faint dawn of freedom were to show two millions of men their true\r\nposition, the oppressors would have reason to tremble. After having\r\nenfranchised the children of their slaves, the Europeans of the southern\r\nstates would very shortly be obliged to extend the same benefit to the\r\nwhole black population.\r\n\r\nIn the north, as I have already remarked, a two-fold migration ensues\r\nupon the abolition of slavery, or even precedes that event when\r\ncircumstances have rendered it probable; the slaves quit the country to\r\nbe transported southward; and the whites of the northern states as well\r\nas the emigrants from Europe hasten to fill up their place. But these\r\ntwo causes cannot operate in the same manner in the southern states.\r\nOn the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great for any expectation of\r\ntheir ever being removed from the country to be entertained; and on\r\nthe other hand, the Europeans and the Anglo-Americans of the north are\r\nafraid to come to inhabit a country, in which labor has not yet been\r\nreinstated in its rightful honors. Besides, they very justly look upon\r\nthe states in which the proportion of the negroes equals or exceeds that\r\nof the whites, as exposed to very great dangers; and they refrain from\r\nturning their activity in that direction.\r\n\r\nThus the inhabitants if the south would not be able, like their northern\r\ncountrymen, to initiate the slaves gradually into a state of freedom,\r\nby abolishing slavery; they have no means of perceptibly diminishing\r\nthe black population, and they would remain unsupported to repress its\r\nexcesses. So that in the course of a few years, a great people of free\r\nnegroes would exist in the heart of a white nation of equal size.\r\n\r\nThe same abuses of power which still maintain slavery, would then become\r\nthe source of the most alarming perils, which the white population of\r\nthe south might have to apprehend. At the present time the descendants\r\nof the Europeans are the sole owners of the land; the absolute masters\r\nof all labor; and the only persons who are possessed of wealth,\r\nknowledge, and arms. The black is destitute of all these advantages,\r\nbut he subsists without them because he is a slave. If he were free, and\r\nobliged to provide for his own subsistence, would it be possible for\r\nhim to remain without these things and to support life? Or would not the\r\nvery instruments of the present superiority of the white, while slavery\r\nexists, expose him to a thousand dangers if it were abolished?\r\n\r\nAs long as the negro remains a slave, he may be kept in a condition\r\nnot very far removed from that of the brutes; but, with his liberty,\r\nhe cannot but acquire a degree of instruction which will enable him to\r\nappreciate his misfortunes, and to discern a remedy for them. Moreover,\r\nthere exists a singular principle of relative justice which is very\r\nfirmly implanted in the human heart. Men are much more forcibly struck\r\nby those inequalities which exist within the circles of the same class,\r\nthan with those which may be remarked between different classes. It is\r\nmore easy for them to admit slavery, than to allow several millions\r\nof citizens to exist under a load of eternal infamy and hereditary\r\nwretchedness. In the north, the population of freed negroes feels these\r\nhardships and resents these indignities; but its members and its powers\r\nare small, while in the south it would be numerous and strong.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emancipated blacks\r\nare placed upon the same territory in the situation of two alien\r\ncommunities, it will readily be understood that there are but two\r\nalternatives for the future; the negroes and the whites must either\r\nwholly part or wholly mingle. I have already expressed the conviction\r\nwhich I entertain as to the latter event.[252] I do not imagine that the\r\nwhite and the black races will ever live in any country upon an equal\r\nfooting. But I believe the difficulty to be still greater in the\r\nUnited States than elsewhere. An isolated individual may surmount the\r\nprejudices of religion, of his country, or of his race, and if this\r\nindividual is a king he may effect surprising changes in society; but a\r\nwhole people cannot rise, as it were, above itself. A despot who should\r\nsubject the Americans and their former slaves to the same yoke, might\r\nperhaps succeed in commingling their races; but as long as the American\r\ndemocracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will undertake so\r\ndifficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer the white\r\npopulation of the United States becomes, the more isolated will it\r\nremain.[253]\r\n\r\nI have previously observed that the mixed race is the true bond of union\r\nbetween the Europeans and the Indians; just so the mulattoes are the\r\ntrue means of transition between the white and the negro; so that\r\nwherever mulattoes abound, the intermixture of the two races is not\r\nimpossible. In some parts of America the European and the negro races\r\nare so crossed by one another, that it is rare to meet with a man who is\r\nentirely black or entirely white: when they are arrived at this point,\r\nthe two races may really be said to be combined; or rather to have been\r\nabsorbed in a third race, which is connected with both, without being\r\nidentical with either.\r\n\r\nOf all the Europeans the English are those who have mixed least with the\r\nnegroes. More mulattoes are to be seen in the south of the Union than in\r\nthe north, but still they are infinitely more scarce than in any other\r\nEuropean colony: Mulattoes are by no means numerous in the United\r\nStates; they have no force peculiar to themselves, and when quarrels\r\noriginating in differences of color take place, they generally side\r\nwith the whites, just as the lacqueys of the great in Europe assume the\r\ncontemptuous airs of nobility to the lower orders.\r\n\r\nThe pride of origin, which is natural to the English, is singularly\r\naugmented by the personal pride which democratic liberty fosters among\r\nthe Americans: the white citizen of the United States is proud of his\r\nrace, and proud of himself. But if the whites and the negroes do not\r\nintermingle in the north of the Union, how should they mix in the south?\r\nCan it be supposed for an instant, that an American of the southern\r\nstates, placed, as he must for ever be, between the white man with all\r\nhis physical and moral superiority, and the negro, will ever think of\r\npreferring the latter? The Americans of the southern states have two\r\npowerful passions, which will always keep them aloof; the first is the\r\nfear of being assimilated to the negroes, their former slaves; and the\r\nsecond, the dread of sinking below the whites, their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIf I were called upon to predict what will probably occur at some future\r\ntime, I should say, that the abolition of slavery in the south, will,\r\nin the common course of things, increase the repugnance of the white\r\npopulation for the men of color. I found this opinion upon the analogous\r\nobservation which I already had occasion to make in the north. I there\r\nremarked, that the white inhabitants of the north avoid the negroes with\r\nincreasing care, in proportion as the legal barriers of separation are\r\nremoved by the legislature; and why should not the same result\r\ntake place in the south? In the north, the whites are deterred from\r\nintermingling with the blacks by the fear of an imaginary danger; in the\r\nsouth, where the danger would be real, I cannot imagine that the fear\r\nwould be less general.\r\n\r\nIf, on the one hand, it be admitted (and the fact is unquestionable),\r\nthat the colored population perpetually accumulates in the extreme\r\nsouth, and that it increases more rapidly than that of the whites; and\r\nif, on the other hand, it be allowed that it is impossible to foresee\r\na time at which the whites and the blacks will be so intermingled as to\r\nderive the same benefits from society; must it not be inferred, that the\r\nblacks and the whites will, sooner or later, come to open strife in the\r\nsouthern states of the Union? But if it be asked what the issue of the\r\nstruggle is likely to be, it will readily be understood, that we are\r\nhere left to form a very vague surmise of the truth. The human mind may\r\nsucceed in tracing a wide circle, as it were, which includes the course\r\nof future events; but within that circle a thousand various chances\r\nand circumstances may direct it in as many different ways; and in\r\nevery picture of the future there is a dim spot, which the eye of the\r\nunderstanding cannot penetrate. It appears, however, to be extremely\r\nprobable, that, in the West India islands the white race is destined\r\nto be subdued, and the black population to share the same fate upon the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn the West India islands the white planters are surrounded by an\r\nimmense black population; on the continent, the blacks are placed\r\nbetween the ocean and an innumerable people, which already extends over\r\nthem in a dense mass from the icy confines of Canada to the frontiers\r\nof Virginia, and from the banks of the Missouri to the shores of the\r\nAtlantic. If the white citizens of North America remain united, it\r\ncannot be supposed that the negroes will escape the destruction with\r\nwhich they are menaced; they must be subdued by want or by the sword.\r\nBut the black population which is accumulating along the coast of\r\nthe gulf of Mexico, has a chance of success, if the American Union is\r\ndissolved when the struggle between the two races begins. If the federal\r\ntie were broken, the citizens of the south would be wrong to rely upon\r\nany lasting succor from their northern countrymen. The latter are\r\nwell aware that the danger can never reach them; and unless they are\r\nconstrained to march to the assistance of the south by a positive\r\nobligation, it may be foreseen that the sympathy of color will be\r\ninsufficient to stimulate their exertions.\r\n\r\nYet, at whatever period the strife may break out, the whites of the\r\nsouth, even if they are abandoned to their own resources, will enter\r\nthe lists with an immense superiority of knowledge and of the means of\r\nwarfare: but the blacks will have numerical strength and the energy of\r\ndespair upon their side; and these are powerful resources to men who\r\nhave taken up arms. The fate of the white population of the southern\r\nstates will, perhaps, be similar to that of the Moors in Spain. After\r\nhaving occupied the land for centuries, it will perhaps be forced to\r\nretire to the country whence its ancestors came, and to abandon to the\r\nnegroes the possession of a territory, which Providence seems to have\r\nmore peculiarly destined for them, since they can subsist and labor in\r\nit more easily than the whites.\r\n\r\nThe danger of a conflict between the white and the black inhabitants of\r\nthe southern states of the Union--a danger which, however remote it may\r\nbe, is inevitable--perpetually haunts the imagination of the Americans.\r\nThe inhabitants of the north make it a common topic of conversation,\r\nalthough they have no direct injury to fear from the struggle; but they\r\nvainly endeavor to devise some means of obviating the misfortunes which\r\nthey foresee. In the southern states the subject is not discussed: the\r\nplanter does not allude to the future in conversing with strangers; the\r\ncitizen does not communicate his apprehensions to his friends: he seeks\r\nto conceal them from himself: but there is something more alarming in\r\nthe tacit forebodings of the south, than in the clamorous fears of the\r\nnorthern states.\r\n\r\nThis all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an undertaking which\r\nis but little known, but which may have the effect of changing the fate\r\nof a portion of the human race. From apprehension of the dangers which\r\nI have just been describing, a certain number of American citizens have\r\nformed a society for the purpose of exporting to the coast of Guinea,\r\nat their own expense, such free negroes as may be willing to escape from\r\nthe oppression to which they are subject.[254] In 1820, the society to\r\nwhich I allude formed a settlement in Africa, upon the 7th degree\r\nof north latitude, which bears the name of Liberia. The most recent\r\nintelligence informs us that two thousand five hundred negroes are\r\ncollected there; they have introduced the democratic institutions\r\nof America into the country of their forefathers; and Liberia has a\r\nrepresentative system of government, negro-jurymen, negro-magistrates,\r\nand negro-priests; churches have been built, newspapers established,\r\nand, by a singular change in the vicissitudes of the world, white men\r\nare prohibited from sojourning within the settlement.[255]\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a strange caprice of fortune. Two hundred years have now\r\nelapsed since the inhabitants of Europe undertook to tear the negro\r\nfrom his family and his home, in order to transport him to the shores of\r\nNorth America; at the present day, the European settlers are engaged in\r\nsending back the descendants of those very negroes to the continent from\r\nwhich they were originally taken; and the barbarous Africans have been\r\nbrought into contact with civilisation in the midst of bondage, and have\r\nbecome acquainted with free political institutions in slavery. Up to the\r\npresent time Africa has been closed against the arts and sciences of the\r\nwhites; but the inventions of Europe will perhaps penetrate into those\r\nregions, now that they are introduced by Africans themselves. The\r\nsettlement of Liberia is founded upon a lofty and a most fruitful idea;\r\nbut whatever may be its results with regard to the continent of Africa,\r\nit can afford no remedy to the New World.\r\n\r\nIn twelve years the Colonization society has transported two thousand\r\nfive hundred negroes to Africa; in the same space of time about seven\r\nhundred thousand blacks were born in the United States. If the colony\r\nof Liberia were so situated as to be able to receive thousands of new\r\ninhabitants every year, and if the negroes were in a state to be sent\r\nthither with advantage; if the Union were to supply the society with\r\nannual subsidies,[256] and to transport the negroes to Liberia, there\r\nis little chance that the negro population of the United States would\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIn the South, however, this leaves two choices: either for the whites\r\nto remain in communities with the negroes, and to intermingle with them;\r\nor, remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a state of slavery\r\nas long as possible. All intermediate measures seem to me likely to\r\nterminate, and that shortly, in the most horrible of civil wars, and\r\nperhaps in the extirpation of one or other of the two races. Such is the\r\nview which the Americans of the south take of the question, and they\r\nact consistently with it. As they are determined not to mingle with the\r\nnegroes, they refuse to emancipate them.\r\n\r\nNot that the inhabitants of the south regard slavery as necessary to the\r\nwealth of the planter; for on this point many of them agree with their\r\nnorthern countrymen in freely admitting that slavery is prejudicial to\r\ntheir interests; but they are convinced that, however prejudicial it may\r\nbe, they hold their lives upon no other tenure. The instruction which is\r\nnow diffused in the south has convinced the inhabitants that slavery is\r\ninjurious to the slave-owner, but it has also shown them, more clearly\r\nthan before, that no means exist of getting rid of its bad consequences.\r\nHence arises a singular contrast; the more the utility of slavery is\r\ncontested, the more firmly is it established in the laws; and while\r\nthe principle of servitude is gradually abolished in the north, that\r\nself-same principle gives rise to more and more rigorous consequences in\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the southern states, with regard to slaves, presents\r\nat the present day such unparalleled atrocities, as suffice to show how\r\nradically the laws of humanity have been perverted, and to betray the\r\ndesperate position of the community in which that legislation has\r\nbeen promulgated. The Americans of this portion of the Union have not,\r\nindeed, augmented the hardships of slavery; they have, on the contrary,\r\nbettered the physical condition of the slaves. The only means by which\r\nthe ancients maintained slavery were fetters and death; the Americans of\r\nthe south of the Union have discovered more intellectual securities\r\nfor the duration of their power. They have employed their despotism and\r\ntheir violence against the human mind. In antiquity, precautions were\r\ntaken to prevent the slave from breaking his chains; at the present day\r\nmeasures are adopted to deprive him even of the desire of freedom. The\r\nancients kept the bodies of their slaves in bondage, but they placed\r\nno restraint upon the mind and no check upon education; and they\r\nacted consistently with their established principle, since a natural\r\ntermination of slavery then existed, and one day or other the slave\r\nmight be set free, and become the equal of his master. But the Americans\r\nof the south, who do not admit that the negroes can ever be commingled\r\nwith themselves, have forbidden them to be taught to read or to write,\r\nunder severe penalties; and as they will not raise them to their own\r\nlevel, they sink them as nearly as possible to that of the brutes.\r\n\r\nThe hope of liberty had always been allowed to the slave to cheer the\r\nhardships of his condition. But the Americans of the south are well\r\naware that emancipation cannot but be dangerous, when the freed man can\r\nnever be assimilated to his former master. To give a man his freedom,\r\nand to leave him in wretchedness and ignominy, is nothing less than to\r\nprepare a future chief for a revolt of the slaves. Moreover, it has long\r\nbeen remarked, that the presence of a free negro vaguely agitates the\r\nminds of his less fortunate brethren, and conveys to them a dim notion\r\nof their rights. The Americans of the south have consequently taken\r\nmeasures to prevent slave-owners from emancipating their slaves in most\r\ncases; not indeed by a positive prohibition, but by subjecting that step\r\nto various forms which it is difficult to comply with.\r\n\r\nI happened to meet with an old man, in the south of the Union, who had\r\nlived in illicit intercourse with one of his negresses, and had had\r\nseveral children by her, who were born the slaves of their father. He\r\nhad indeed frequently thought of bequeathing to them at least their\r\nliberty; but years had elapsed without his being able to surmount the\r\nlegal obstacles to their emancipation, and in the meanwhile his old\r\nage was come, and he was about to die. He pictured to himself his sons\r\ndragged from market to market, and passing from the authority of a\r\nparent to the rod of the stranger, until these horrid anticipations\r\nworked his expiring imagination into phrensy. When I saw him he was a\r\nprey to all the anguish of despair, and he made me feel how awful is the\r\nretribution of Nature upon those who have broken her laws.\r\n\r\nThese evils are unquestionably great; but they are the necessary and\r\nforeseen consequences of the very principle of modern slavery. When the\r\nEuropeans chose their slaves from a race differing from their own, which\r\nmany of them considered as inferior to the other races of mankind,\r\nand which they all repelled with horror from any notion of intimate\r\nconnexion, they must have believed that slavery would last for ever;\r\nsince there is no intermediate state which can be durable, between the\r\nexcessive inequality produced by servitude, and the complete equality\r\nwhich originates in independence. The Europeans did imperfectly feel\r\nthis truth, but without acknowledging it even to themselves. Whenever\r\nthey have had to do with negroes, their conduct has either been dictated\r\nby their interest and their pride, or by their compassion. They first\r\nviolated every right of humanity by their treatment of the negro;\r\nand they afterward informed him that those rights were precious and\r\ninviolable. They affected to open their ranks to the slave, but the\r\nnegroes who attempted to penetrate into the community were driven back\r\nwith scorn; and they have incautiously and involuntarily been led to\r\nadmit of freedom instead of slavery, without having the courage to be\r\nwholly iniquitous, or wholly just.[257]\r\n\r\nIf it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the Americans of the\r\nsouth will mingle their blood with that of the negroes, can they allow\r\ntheir slaves to become free without compromising their own security? And\r\nif they are obliged to keep that race in bondage, in order to save their\r\nown families, may they not be excused for availing themselves of the\r\nmeans best adapted to that end? The events which are taking place in the\r\nsouthern states of the Union, appear to be at once the most horrible\r\nand the most natural results of slavery. When I see the order of nature\r\noverthrown, and when I hear the cry of humanity in its vain struggle\r\nagainst the laws, my indignation does not light upon the men of our\r\nown time who were the instruments of these outrages; but I reserve my\r\nexecration for those who, after a thousand years of freedom, brought\r\nback slavery into the world once more.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the efforts of the Americans of the south to maintain\r\nslavery, they will not always succeed. Slavery, which is now confined to\r\na single tract of the civilized earth, which is attacked by Christianity\r\nas unjust, and by political economy as prejudicial, and which is now\r\ncontrasted with democratic liberties and the information of our age,\r\ncannot survive. By the choice of the master or the will of the slave,\r\nit will cease; and in either case great calamities may be expected to\r\nensue. If liberty be refused to the negroes of the south, they will\r\nin the end seize it for themselves by force; if it be given, they will\r\nabuse it ere long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE CHANCES IN FAVOR OF THE DURATION OF THE AMERICAN UNION, AND\r\nWHAT DANGERS THREATEN IT.\r\n\r\nReasons why the preponderating Force lies in the States rather than in\r\nthe Union.--The Union will only last as long as all the States choose\r\nto belong to it.--Causes which tend to keep them united.--Utility of\r\nthe Union to resist foreign Enemies, and to prevent the Existence\r\nof Foreigners in America.--No natural Barriers between the several\r\nStates.--No conflicting Interests to divide them.--Reciprocal Interests\r\nof the Northern, Southern, and Western States.--Intellectual ties of\r\nUnion.--Uniformity of Opinions.--Dangers of the Union resulting from the\r\ndifferent Characters and the Passions of its Citizens.--Character of the\r\nCitizens in the South and in the North.--The rapid growth of the\r\nUnion one of its greatest Dangers.--Progress of the Population to\r\nthe Northwest.--Power gravitates in the same Direction.--Passions\r\noriginating from sudden turns of Fortune.--Whether the existing\r\nGovernment of the Union tends to gain strength, or to lose\r\nit.--Various signs of its Decrease.--Internal Improvement.--Waste\r\nLands.--Indians.--The Bank.--The Tariff.--General Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the existing institutions of the several states\r\ndepends in some measure upon the maintenance of the Union itself. It is\r\ntherefore important in the first instance to inquire into the probable\r\nfate of the Union. One point may indeed be assumed at once; if\r\nthe present confederation were dissolved, it appears to me to be\r\nincontestable that the states of which it is now composed would not\r\nreturn to their original isolated condition; but that several Unions\r\nwould then be formed in the place of one. It is not my intention to\r\ninquire into the principles upon which these new Unions would probably\r\nbe established, but merely to show what the causes are which may effect\r\nthe dismemberment of the existing confederation.\r\n\r\nWith this object I shall be obliged to retrace some of the steps which\r\nI have already taken, and to revert to topics which I have before\r\ndiscussed. I am aware that the reader may accuse me of repetition, but\r\nthe importance of the matter which still remains to be treated is my\r\nexcuse; I had rather say too much, than say too little to be thoroughly\r\nunderstood, and I prefer injuring the author to slighting the subject.\r\n\r\nThe legislators who formed the constitution of 1789 endeavored to confer\r\na distinct and preponderating authority upon the federal power. But they\r\nwere confined by the conditions of the task which they had undertaken\r\nto perform. They were not appointed to constitute the government of a\r\nsingle people, but to regulate the association of several states; and,\r\nwhatever their inclinations might be, they could not but divide the\r\nexercise of sovereignty in the end.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the consequences of this division, it is\r\nnecessary to make a short distinction between the affairs of government.\r\nThere are some objects which are national by their very nature, that is\r\nto say, which affect the nation as a body, and can only be intrusted to\r\nthe man or the assembly of men who most completely represent the entire\r\nnation. Among these may be reckoned war and diplomacy. There are other\r\nobjects which are provincial by their very nature, that is to say, which\r\nonly affect certain localities, and which can only be properly treated\r\nin that locality. Such, for instance, is the budget of municipality.\r\nLastly, there are certain objects of a mixed nature, which are national\r\ninasmuch as they affect all the citizens who compose the nation, and\r\nwhich are provincial inasmuch as it is not necessary that the nation\r\nitself should provide for them all. Such are the rights which regulate\r\nthe civil and political condition of the citizens. No society can exist\r\nwithout civil and political rights. These rights therefore interest all\r\nthe citizens alike; but it is not always necessary to the existence and\r\nthe prosperity of the nation that these rights should be uniform, nor\r\nconsequently, that they should be regulated by the central authority.\r\n\r\nThere are, then, two distinct categories of objects which are submitted\r\nto the direction of the sovereign power; and these categories occur in\r\nall well-constituted communities, whatever the basis of the political\r\nconstitution may otherwise be. Between these two extremes, the objects\r\nwhich I have termed mixed may be considered to lie. As these objects\r\nare neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, they may be\r\nattained by a national or a provincial government, according to the\r\nagreement of the contracting parties, without in any way impairing the\r\ncontract of association.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign power is usually formed by the union of separate\r\nindividuals, who compose a people; and individual powers or collective\r\nforces, each representing a very small portion of the sovereign\r\nauthority, are the sole elements which are subjected to the general\r\ngovernment of their choice. In this case the general government is more\r\nnaturally called upon to regulate, not only those affairs which are\r\nof essential national importance, but those which are of a more local\r\ninterest; and the local governments are reduced to that small share of\r\nsovereign authority which is indispensable to their prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the sovereign authority is composed of preorganized\r\npolitical bodies, by virtue of circumstances anterior to their union;\r\nand in this case the provincial governments assume the control, not only\r\nof those affairs which more peculiarly belong to their province, but of\r\nall, or of a part of the mixed affairs to which allusion has been made.\r\nFor the confederate nations which were independent sovereign states\r\nbefore their Union, and which still represent a very considerable share\r\nof the sovereign power, have only consented to cede to the general\r\ngovernment the exercise of those rights which are indispensable to the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nWhen the national government, independently of the prerogative inherent\r\nin its nature, is invested with the right of regulating the affairs\r\nwhich relate partly to the general and partly to the local interest,\r\nit possesses a preponderating influence. Not only are its own rights\r\nextensive, but all the rights which it does not possess exist by its\r\nsufferance, and it may be apprehended that the provincial governments\r\nmay be deprived of their natural and necessary prerogatives by its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, the provincial governments are invested\r\nwith the power of regulating those same affairs of mixed interest, an\r\nopposite tendency prevails in society. The preponderating force resides\r\nin the province, not in the nation; and it may be apprehended that the\r\nnational government may in the end be stripped of the privileges which\r\nare necessary to its existence.\r\n\r\nIndependent nations have therefore a natural tendency to centralization,\r\nand confederations to dismemberment.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for us to apply these general principles to the\r\nAmerican Union. The several states were necessarily possessed of the\r\nright of regulating all exclusively provincial affairs. Moreover these\r\nsame states retained the right of determining the civil and political\r\ncompetency of the citizens, of regulating the reciprocal relations of\r\nthe members of the community, and of dispensing justice; rights which\r\nare of a general nature, but which do not necessarily appertain to the\r\nnational government. We have shown that the government of the Union is\r\ninvested with the power of acting in the name of the whole nation, in\r\nthose cases in which the nation has to appear as a single and undivided\r\npower; as, for instance, in foreign relations, and in offering a common\r\nresistance to a common enemy; in short, in conducting those affairs\r\nwhich I have styled exclusively national.\r\n\r\nIn this division of the rights of sovereignty, the share of the Union\r\nseems at first sight to be more considerable than that of the states;\r\nbut a more attentive investigation shows it to be less so. The\r\nundertakings of the government of the Union are more vast, but their\r\ninfluence is more rarely felt. Those of the provincial government are\r\ncomparatively small, but they are incessant, and they serve to keep\r\nalive the authority which they represent. The government of the Union\r\nwatches the general interests of the country; but the general interests\r\nof a people have a very questionable influence upon individual\r\nhappiness; while provincial interests produce a most immediate effect\r\nupon the welfare of the inhabitants. The Union secures the independence\r\nand the greatness of the nation, which do not immediately affect private\r\ncitizens; but the several states maintain the liberty, regulate the\r\nrights, protect the fortune, and secure the life and the whole future\r\nprosperity of every citizen.\r\n\r\nThe federal government is very far removed from its subjects, while the\r\nprovincial governments are within the reach of them all, and are ready\r\nto attend to the smallest appeal. The central government has upon its\r\nside the passions of a few superior men who aspire to conduct it; but\r\nupon the side of the provincial governments are the interests of all\r\nthose second-rate individuals who can only hope to obtain power within\r\ntheir own state, and who nevertheless exercise the largest share of\r\nauthority over the people because they are placed nearest to its level.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have therefore much more to hope and to fear from the\r\nstates than from the Union; and, in conformity with the natural tendency\r\nof the human mind, they are more likely to attach themselves to the\r\nformer than to the latter. In this respect their habits and feelings\r\nharmonize with their interests.\r\n\r\nWhen a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a confederate\r\nform of government, the traditions, the customs, and the manners of the\r\npeople are for a long time at variance with their legislation; and the\r\nformer tend to give a degree of influence to the central government\r\nwhich the latter forbids. When a number of confederate states unite to\r\nform a single nation, the same causes operate in an opposite direction.\r\nI have no doubt that if France were to become a confederate republic\r\nlike that of the United States, the government would at first display\r\nmore energy than that of the Union; and if the Union were to alter\r\nits constitution to a monarchy like that of France, I think that the\r\nAmerican government would be a long time in acquiring the force\r\nwhich now rules the latter nation. When the national existence of the\r\nAnglo-Americans began, their provincial existence was already of long\r\nstanding; necessary relations were established between the townships and\r\nthe individual citizens of the same states; and they were accustomed\r\nto consider some objects as common to them all, and to conduct other\r\naffairs as exclusively relating to their own special interests.\r\n\r\nThe Union is a vast body, which presents no definite object to\r\npatriotic feeling. The forms and limits of the state are distinct and\r\ncircumscribed, since it represents a certain number of objects which are\r\nfamiliar to the citizens and beloved by all. It is identified with the\r\nvery soil, with the right of property and the domestic affections, with\r\nthe recollections of the past, the labors of the present, and the hopes\r\nof the future. Patriotism, then, which is frequently a mere extension of\r\nindividual egotism, is still directed to the state, and is not excited\r\nby the Union. Thus the tendency of the interests, the habits, and the\r\nfeelings of the people, is to centre political activity in the states,\r\nin preference to the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to estimate the different forces of the two governments, by\r\nremarking the manner in which they fulfil their respective functions.\r\nWhenever the government of a state has occasion to address an\r\nindividual, or an assembly of individuals, its language is clear and\r\nimperative; and such is also the tone of the federal government in its\r\nintercourse with individuals, but no sooner has it anything to do with a\r\nstate, than it begins to parley, to explain its motives, and to justify\r\nits conduct, to argue, to advise, and in short, anything but to command.\r\nIf doubts are raised as to the limits of the constitutional powers\r\nof each government, the provincial government prefers its claims with\r\nboldness, and takes prompt and energetic steps to support it. In\r\nthe meanwhile the government of the Union reasons, it appeals to the\r\ninterests, to the good sense, to the glory of the nation; it temporizes,\r\nit negotiates, and does not consent to act until it is reduced to the\r\nlast extremity. At first sight it might readily be imagined that it\r\nis the provincial government which is armed with the authority of the\r\nnation, and that congress represents a single state.\r\n\r\nThe federal government is, therefore, notwithstanding the precautions\r\nof those who founded it, naturally so weak, that it more peculiarly\r\nrequires the free consent of the governed to enable it to subsist. It is\r\neasy to perceive that its object is to enable the states to realize with\r\nfacility their determination of remaining united; and, as long as this\r\npreliminary consideration exists, its authority is great, temperate, and\r\neffective. The constitution fits the government to control individuals,\r\nand easily to surmount such obstacles as they may be inclined to\r\noffer, but it was by no means established with a view to the possible\r\nseparation of one or more of the states from the Union.\r\n\r\nIf the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle with\r\nthat of the states at the present day, its defeat may be confidently\r\npredicted; and it is not probable that such a struggle would be\r\nseriously undertaken. As often as steady resistance is offered to the\r\nfederal government, it will be found to yield. Experience has hitherto\r\nshown that whenever a state has demanded anything with perseverance\r\nand resolution, it has invariably succeeded; and that if a separate\r\ngovernment has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do as it\r\nthought fit.[258]\r\n\r\nBut even if the government of the Union had any strength inherent in\r\nitself, the physical situation of the country would render the exercise\r\nof that strength very difficult.[259] The United States cover an immense\r\nterritory; they are separated from each other by great distances; and\r\nthe population is disseminated over the surface of a country which is\r\nstill half a wilderness. If the Union were to undertake to enforce the\r\nallegiance of the confederate states by military means, it would be in\r\na position very analogous to that of England at the time of the war of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nHowever strong a government may be, it cannot easily escape from the\r\nconsequences of a principle which it has once admitted as the foundation\r\nof its constitution. The Union was formed by the voluntary agreement\r\nof the states; and, in uniting together, they have not forfeited their\r\nnationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the\r\nsame people. If one of the states chose to withdraw its name from the\r\ncompact, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so; and\r\nthe federal government would have no means of maintaining its claims\r\ndirectly, either by force or by right. In order to enable the federal\r\ngovernment easily to conquer the resistance which may be offered to it\r\nby any one of its subjects, it would be necessary that one or more of\r\nthem should be especially interested in the existence of the Union, as\r\nhas frequently been the case in the history of confederations.\r\n\r\nIf it be supposed that among the states which are united by the federal\r\ntie, there are some which exclusively enjoy the principal advantages of\r\nunion, or whose prosperity depends on the duration of that union, it\r\nis unquestionable that they will always be ready to support the central\r\ngovernment in enforcing the obedience of the others. But the government\r\nwould then be exerting a force not derived from itself, but from a\r\nprinciple contrary to its nature. States form confederations in order to\r\nderive equal advantages from their union; and in the case just alluded\r\nto, the federal government would derive its power from the unequal\r\ndistribution of those benefits among the states.\r\n\r\nIf one of the confederated states have acquired a preponderance\r\nsufficiently great to enable it to take exclusive possession of\r\nthe central authority, it will consider the other states as subject\r\nprovinces, and will cause its own supremacy to be respected under the\r\nborrowed name of the sovereignty of the Union. Great things may then\r\nbe done in the name of the federal government, but in reality that\r\ngovernment will have ceased to exist.[260] In both these cases, the\r\npower which acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger, the\r\nmore it abandons the natural state and the acknowledged principles of\r\nconfederations.\r\n\r\nIn America the existing Union is advantageous to all the states, but it\r\nis not indispensable to any one of them. Several of them might break\r\nthe federal tie without compromising the welfare of the others, although\r\ntheir own prosperity would be lessened. As the existence and the\r\nhappiness of none of the states are wholly dependent on the present\r\nconstitution, they would none of them be disposed to make great personal\r\nsacrifices to maintain it. On the other hand, there is no state which\r\nseems, hitherto, to have its ambition much interested in the maintenance\r\nof the existing Union. They certainly do not all exercise the same\r\ninfluence in the federal councils, but no one of them can hope to\r\ndomineer over the rest, or to treat them as its inferiors or as its\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me unquestionable, that if any portion of the Union\r\nseriously desired to separate itself from the other states, they would\r\nnot be able, nor indeed would they attempt, to prevent it; and that\r\nthe present Union will only last as long as the states which compose\r\nit choose to continue members of the confederation. If this point be\r\nadmitted, the question becomes less difficult; and our object is not\r\nto inquire whether the states of the existing Union are capable of\r\nseparating, but whether they will choose to remain united.\r\n\r\n[The remarks respecting the inability of the federal government to\r\nretain within the Union any state that may choose \"to withdraw its name\r\nfrom the contract,\" ought not to pass through an American edition of\r\nthis work, without the expression of a dissent by the editor from the\r\nopinion of the author. The laws of the United States must remain in\r\nforce in a revolted state, until repealed by congress; the customs and\r\npostages must be collected; the courts of the United States must sit,\r\nand must decide the causes submitted to them; as has been very happily\r\nexplained by the author, the courts act upon individuals. If their\r\njudgments are resisted, the executive arm must interpose, and if the\r\nstate authorities aid in the resistance, the military power of the whole\r\nUnion must be invoked to overcome it. So long as the laws affecting\r\nthe citizens of such a state remain, and so long as there remain any\r\nofficers of a general government to enforce them, these results must\r\nfollow not only theoretically but actually. The author probably formed\r\nthe opinions which are the subject of these remarks, at the commencement\r\nof the controversy with South Carolina respecting the tariff. And when\r\nthey were written and published, he had not learned the result of\r\nthat controversy, in which the supremacy of the Union and its laws\r\nwas triumphant. There was doubtless great reluctance in adopting the\r\nnecessary measures to collect the customs, and to bring every legal\r\nquestion that could possibly arise out of the controversy, before the\r\njudiciary of the United States, but they were finally adopted, and were\r\nnot the less successful for being the result of deliberation and of\r\nnecessity. Out of that controversy have arisen some advantages of a\r\npermanent character, produced by the legislation which it required.\r\nThere were defects in the laws regulating the manner of bringing from\r\nthe state courts into those of the United States, a cause involving the\r\nconstitutionality of acts of congress or of the states, through which\r\nthe federal authority might be evaded. Those defects were remedied\r\nby the legislation referred to; and it is now more emphatically and\r\nuniversally true, than when the author wrote, that the acts of the\r\ngeneral government operate through the judiciary, upon individual\r\ncitizens, and not upon the states.--_American Editor._]\r\n\r\nAmong the various reasons which tend to render the existing Union useful\r\nto the Americans, two principal causes are peculiarly evident to the\r\nobserver. Although the Americans are, as it were, alone upon their\r\ncontinent, their commerce makes them the neighbors of all the nations\r\nwith which they trade. Notwithstanding their apparent isolation, the\r\nAmericans require a certain degree of strength, which they cannot retain\r\notherwise than by remaining united to each other. If the states were to\r\nsplit, they would not only diminish the strength which they are now able\r\nto display toward foreign nations, but they would soon create foreign\r\npowers upon their own territory. A system of inland custom-houses would\r\nthen be established; the valleys would be divided by imaginary boundary\r\nlines; the courses of the rivers would be confined by territorial\r\ndistinctions and a multitude of hindrances would prevent the Americans\r\nfrom exploring the whole of that vast continent which Providence has\r\nallotted to them for a dominion. At present they have no invasion to\r\nfear, and consequently no standing armies to maintain, no taxes to levy.\r\nIf the Union were dissolved, all these burdensome measures might ere\r\nlong be required. The Americans are then very powerfully interested\r\nin the maintenance of their Union. On the other hand, it is almost\r\nimpossible to discover any sort of material interest which might at\r\npresent tempt a portion of the Union to separate from the other states.\r\n\r\nWhen we cast our eyes upon the map of the United States, we perceive\r\nthe chain of the Allegany mountains, running from the northeast to the\r\nsouthwest, and crossing nearly one thousand miles of country; and we are\r\nled to imagine that the design of Providence was to raise, between the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi and the coasts of the Atlantic ocean, one of\r\nthose natural barriers which break the mutual intercourse of men, and\r\nform the necessary limits of different states. But the average height of\r\nthe Alleganies does not exceed 2,500 feet; their greatest elevation is\r\nnot above 4,000 feet; their rounded summits, and the spacious valleys\r\nwhich they conceal within their passes, are of easy access from several\r\nsides. Beside which, the principal rivers that fall into the Atlantic\r\nocean, the Hudson, the Susquehannah, and the Potomac, take their rise\r\nbeyond the Alleganies, in an open district, which borders upon\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi. These streams quit this tract of\r\ncountry,[261] make their way through the barrier which would seem to\r\nturn them westward, and as they wind through the mountains, they open an\r\neasy and natural passage to man.\r\n\r\nNo natural barrier exists in the regions which are now inhabited by the\r\nAnglo-Americans; the Alleganies are so far from serving as a boundary\r\nto separate nations, that they do not even serve as a frontier to the\r\nstates. New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, comprise them within their\r\nborders and extend as much to the west as to the east of the line.\r\n\r\nThe territory now occupied by the twenty-four states of the Union,\r\nand the three great districts which have not yet acquired the rank of\r\nstates, although they already contain inhabitants, covers a surface\r\nof 1,002,600 square miles,[262] which is about equal to five times the\r\nextent of France. Within these limits the qualities of the soil, the\r\ntemperature, and the produce of the country, are extremely various. The\r\nvast extent of territory occupied by the Anglo-American republics\r\nhas given rise to doubts as to the maintenance of the Union. Here a\r\ndistinction must be made; contrary interests sometimes arise in the\r\ndifferent provinces of a vast empire, which often terminate in open\r\ndissensions; and the extent of the country is then most prejudicial to\r\nthe power of the state. But if the inhabitants of these vast regions are\r\nnot divided by contrary interests, the extent of the territory may be\r\nfavorable to their prosperity; for the unity of the government promotes\r\nthe interchange of the different productions of the soil, and increases\r\ntheir value by facilitating their consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed easy to discover different interests in the different parts\r\nof the Union, but I am unacquainted with any which are hostile to each\r\nother. The southern states are almost exclusively agricultural; the\r\nnorthern states are more peculiarly commercial and manufacturing; the\r\nstates of the west are at the same time agricultural and manufacturing.\r\nIn the south the crops consist of tobacco, of rice, of cotton, and\r\nof sugar; in the north and the west, of wheat and maize; these are\r\ndifferent sources of wealth; but union is the means by which these\r\nsources are opened to all, and rendered equally advantageous to the\r\nseveral districts.\r\n\r\nThe north, which ships the produce of the Anglo-Americans to all parts\r\nof the world, and brings back the produce of the globe to the Union,\r\nis evidently interested in maintaining the confederation in its present\r\ncondition, in order that the number of American producers and consumers\r\nmay remain as large as possible. The north is the most natural agent\r\nof communication between the south and the west of the Union on the one\r\nhand, and the rest of the world upon the other; the north is therefore\r\ninterested in the union and prosperity of the south and the west,\r\nin order that they may continue to furnish raw materials for its\r\nmanufactures, and cargoes for its shipping.\r\n\r\nThe south and the west, on their side, are still more directly\r\ninterested in the preservation of the Union, and the prosperity of the\r\nnorth. The produce of the south is for the most part exported beyond\r\nseas; the south and the west consequently stand in need of the\r\ncommercial resources of the north. They are likewise interested in\r\nthe maintenance of a powerful fleet by the Union, to protect them\r\nefficaciously. The south and the west have no vessels, but they cannot\r\nrefuse a willing subsidy to defray the expenses of the navy; for if the\r\nfleets of Europe were to blockade the ports of the south and the delta\r\nof the Mississippi, what would become of the rice of the Carolinas, the\r\ntobacco of Virginia, and the sugar and cotton which grow in the valley\r\nof the Mississippi? Every portion of the federal budget does therefore\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of material interests which are common to\r\nall the confederate states.\r\n\r\nIndependently of this commercial utility, the south and the west of the\r\nUnion derive great political advantages from their connexion with the\r\nnorth. The south contains an enormous slave population; a population\r\nwhich is already alarming, and still more formidable for the future. The\r\nstates of the west lie in the remoter part of a single valley; and all\r\nthe rivers which intersect their territory rise in the Rocky mountains\r\nor in the Alleganies, and fall into the Mississippi, which bears them\r\nonward to the gulf of Mexico. The western states are consequently\r\nentirely cut off, by their position, from the traditions of Europe and\r\nthe civilisation of the Old World. The inhabitants of the south, then,\r\nare induced to support the Union in order to avail themselves of its\r\nprotection against the blacks; and the inhabitants of the west, in order\r\nnot to be excluded from a free communication with the rest of the globe,\r\nand shut up in the wilds of central America. The north cannot but desire\r\nthe maintenance of the Union, in order to remain, as it now is, the\r\nconnecting link between that vast body and the other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe temporal interests of all the several parts of the Union are, then,\r\nintimately connected; and the same assertion holds true respecting those\r\nopinions and sentiments which may be termed the immaterial interests of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their\r\nattachment to their country; but I confess that I do not rely upon\r\nthat calculating patriotism which is founded upon interest, and which\r\na change in the interest at stake may obliterate. Nor do I attach much\r\nimportance to the language of the Americans, when they manifest in their\r\ndaily conversation, the intention of maintaining the federal system\r\nadopted by their forefathers. A government retains its sway over a great\r\nnumber of citizens, far less by the voluntary and rational consent\r\nof the multitude, than by that instinctive and, to a certain extent,\r\ninvoluntary agreement, which results from similarity of feelings and\r\nresemblances of opinion. I will never admit that men constitute a social\r\nbody, simply because they obey the same head and the same laws. Society\r\ncan only exist when a great number of men consider a great number of\r\nthings in the same point of view; when they hold the same opinions upon\r\nmany subjects, and when the same occurrences suggest the same thoughts\r\nand impressions to their minds.\r\n\r\nThe observer who examines the present condition of the United States\r\nupon this principle, will readily discover, that although the citizens\r\nare divided into twenty-four distinct sovereignties, they nevertheless\r\nconstitute a single people; and he may perhaps be led to think that the\r\nstate of the Anglo-American Union is more truly a state of society, than\r\nthat of certain nations of Europe which live under the same legislation\r\nand the same prince.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects, they all\r\nregard religion in the same manner. They are not always agreed upon the\r\nmeasures which are most conducive to good government, and they vary upon\r\nsome of the forms of government which it is expedient to adopt; but\r\nthey are unanimous upon the general principles which ought to rule human\r\nsociety. From Maine to the Floridas, and from Missouri to the Atlantic\r\nocean, the people is held to be the legitimate source of all power.\r\nThe same notions are entertained respecting liberty and equality,\r\nthe liberty of the press, the right of association, the jury, and the\r\nresponsibility of the agents of government.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from their political and religious opinions to the moral and\r\nphilosophical principles which regulate the daily actions of life,\r\nand govern their conduct, we shall still find the same uniformity. The\r\nAnglo-Americans[263] acknowledge the absolute moral authority of the\r\nreason of the community, as they acknowledge the political authority of\r\nthe mass of citizens; and they hold that public opinion is the surest\r\narbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false. The majority\r\nof them believe that a man will be led to do what is just and good by\r\nfollowing his own interests, rightly understood. They hold that every\r\nman is born in possession of the right of self-government, and that no\r\none has the right of constraining his fellow-creatures to be happy.\r\nThey have all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man; they are of\r\nopinion that the effects of the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily\r\nbe advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all\r\nconsider society as a body in a state of improvement, humanity as a\r\nchanging scene, in which nothing is, or ought to be, permanent; and they\r\nadmit that what appears to them to be good to-day may be superseded by\r\nsomething better to-morrow. I do not give all these opinions as true,\r\nbut I quote them as characteristic of the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans are not only united together by those common\r\nopinions, but they are separated from all other nations by a common\r\nfeeling of pride. For the last fifty years, no pains have been spared to\r\nconvince the inhabitants of the United States that they constitute the\r\nonly religious, enlightened, and free people. They perceive that, for\r\nthe present, their own democratic institutions succeed, while those\r\nof other countries fail; hence they conceive an overweening opinion\r\nof their superiority, and they are not very remote from believing\r\nthemselves to belong to a distinct race of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe dangers which threaten the American Union do not originate in the\r\ndiversity of interests or opinions; but in the various characters and\r\npassions of the Americans. The men who inhabit the vast territory of\r\nthe United States are almost all the issue of a common stock; but the\r\neffects of the climate, and more especially of slavery, have gradually\r\nintroduced very striking differences between the British settler of the\r\nsouthern states, and the British settler of the north. In Europe it is\r\ngenerally believed that slavery has rendered the interests of one\r\npart of the Union contrary to those of another part; but I by no means\r\nremarked this to be the case; slavery has not created interests in the\r\nsouth contrary to those of the north, but it has modified the character\r\nand changed the habits of the natives of the south.\r\n\r\nI have already explained the influence which slavery has exerted upon\r\nthe commercial ability of the Americans in the south; and this same\r\ninfluence equally extends to their manners. The slave is a servant who\r\nnever remonstrates, and who submits to everything without complaint. He\r\nmay sometimes assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. In the\r\nsouth there are no families so poor as not to have slaves. The citizen\r\nof the southern states of the Union is invested with a sort of domestic\r\ndictatorship from his earliest years; the first notion he acquires in\r\nlife is, that he is born to command, and the first habit he contracts is\r\nthat of being obeyed without resistance. His education tends, then, to\r\ngive him the character of a supercilious and a hasty man; irascible,\r\nviolent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of obstacles, but easily\r\ndiscouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt.\r\n\r\nThe American of the northern states is surrounded by no slaves in\r\nhis childhood; he is even unattended by free servants; and is usually\r\nobliged to provide for his own wants. No sooner does he enter the world\r\nthan the idea of necessity assails him on every side; he soon learns to\r\nknow exactly the natural limits of his authority; he never expects to\r\nsubdue those who withstand him, by force; and he knows that the surest\r\nmeans of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures, is to win their\r\nfavor. He therefore becomes patient, reflecting, tolerant, slow to act,\r\nand persevering in his designs.\r\n\r\nIn the southern states the more immediate wants of life are always\r\nsupplied; the inhabitants of those parts are not busied in the material\r\ncares of life, which are always provided for by others; and their\r\nimagination is diverted to more captivating and less definite objects.\r\nThe American of the south is fond of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of\r\ngaiety, of pleasure, and above all, of idleness; nothing obliges him\r\nto exert himself in order to subsist; and as he has no necessary\r\noccupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even attempt what\r\nwould be useful.\r\n\r\nBut the equality of fortunes, and the absence of slavery in the north,\r\nplunge the inhabitants in those same cares of daily life which are\r\ndisdained by the white population of the south. They are taught from\r\ninfancy to combat want, and to place comfort above all the pleasures\r\nof the intellect or the heart. The imagination is extinguished by the\r\ntrivial details of life; and the ideas become less numerous and less\r\ngeneral, but far more practical and more precise. As prosperity is\r\nthe sole aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained; nature and\r\nmankind are turned to the best pecuniary advantage; and society is\r\ndexterously made to contribute to the welfare of each of its members,\r\nwhile individual egotism is the source of general happiness.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of the north has not only experience, but knowledge:\r\nnevertheless, he sets but little value upon the pleasures of knowledge;\r\nhe esteems it as the means of obtaining a certain end, and he is only\r\nanxious to seize its more lucrative applications. The citizen of the\r\nsouth is more given to act upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank,\r\nmore generous, more intellectual, and more brilliant. The former, with\r\na greater degree of activity, of common sense, of information, and of\r\ngeneral aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil qualities of\r\nthe middle classes. The latter has the tastes, the prejudices, the\r\nweaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aristocracies.\r\n\r\nIf two men are united in society, who have the same interests, and to\r\na certain extent the same opinions, but different characters, different\r\nacquirements, and a different style of civilisation, it is probable that\r\nthese men will not agree. The same remark is applicable to a society of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nSlavery then does not attack the American Union directly in its\r\ninterests, but indirectly in its manners.\r\n\r\nThe states which gave their assent to the federal contract in 1790 were\r\nthirteen in number; the Union now consists of twenty-four members. The\r\npopulation which amounted to nearly four millions in 1790, had more than\r\ntripled in the space of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly\r\nthirteen millions.[264] Changes of such magnitude cannot take place\r\nwithout some danger.\r\n\r\nA society of nations, as well as a society of individuals, derive its\r\nprincipal chances of duration from the wisdom of its members, their\r\nindividual weakness, and their limited number. The Americans who quit\r\nthe coasts of the Atlantic ocean to plunge into the western wilderness,\r\nare adventurers impatient of restraint, greedy of wealth, and frequently\r\nmen expelled from the states in which they were born. When they arrive\r\nin the deserts, they are unknown to each other; and they have neither\r\ntraditions, family feeling, nor the force of example to check their\r\nexcesses. The empire of the laws is feeble among them; that of morality\r\nis still more powerless. The settlers who are constantly peopling the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi are, then, in every respect inferior to the\r\nAmericans who inhabit the older parts of the Union. Nevertheless, they\r\nalready exercise a great influence in its councils; and they arrive at\r\nthe government of the commonwealth before they have learned to govern\r\nthemselves.[265]\r\n\r\nThe greater the individual weakness of each of the contracting parties,\r\nthe greater are the chances of the duration of the contract; for their\r\nsafety is then dependant upon their union. When, in 1790, the\r\nmost populous of the American republics did not contain 500,000\r\ninhabitants,[266] each of them felt its own insignificance as an\r\nindependent people, and this feeling rendered compliance with the\r\nfederal authority more easy. But when one of the confederate states\r\nreckons, like the State of New York, two millions of inhabitants,\r\nand covers an extent of territory equal in surface to a quarter of\r\nFrance,[267] it feels its own strength; and although it may continue\r\nto support the Union as advantageous to its prosperity, it no longer\r\nregards that body as necessary to its existence; and, as it continues\r\nto belong to the federal compact, it soon aims at preponderance in the\r\nfederal assemblies. The probable unanimity of the states is diminished\r\nas their number increases. At present the interests of the different\r\nparts of the Union are not at variance; but who is able to foresee the\r\nmultifarious changes of the future, in a country in which towns are\r\nfounded from day to day, and states almost from year to year?\r\n\r\nSince the first settlement of the British colonies, the number of\r\ninhabitants has about doubled every twenty-two years. I perceive no\r\ncauses which are likely to check this progressive increase of the\r\nAnglo-American population for the next hundred years; and before\r\nthat space of time has elapsed, I believe that the territories and\r\ndependencies of the United States will be covered by more than a hundred\r\nmillions of inhabitants, and divided into forty states.[268] I admit\r\nthat these hundred millions of men have no hostile interests; I suppose,\r\non the contrary, that they are all equally interested in the maintenance\r\nof the Union; but I am still of opinion, that where there are a hundred\r\nmillions of men, and forty distinct nations unequally strong, the\r\ncontinuance of the federal government can only be a fortunate accident.\r\n\r\nWhatever faith I may have in the perfectibility of man until human\r\nnature is altered, and men wholly transformed, I shall refuse to believe\r\nin the duration of a government which is called upon to hold together\r\nforty different peoples, disseminated over a territory equal to one-half\r\nof Europe in extent; to avoid all rivalry, ambition, and struggles,\r\nbetween them; and to direct their independent activity to the\r\naccomplishment of the same designs.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its increase,\r\narises from the continual changes which take place in the position of\r\nits internal strength. The distance from Lake Superior to the gulf of\r\nMexico extends from the 47th to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance\r\nof more than twelve hundred miles, as the bird flies. The frontier of\r\nthe United States winds along the whole of this immense line; sometimes\r\nfalling within its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond it,\r\ninto the waste. It has been calculated that the whites advance a mean\r\ndistance of seventeen miles along the whole of this vast boundary.[269]\r\nObstacles, such as an unproductive district, a lake, or an Indian nation\r\nunexpectedly encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing column\r\nthen halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon themselves,\r\nand as soon as they are reunited they proceed onward. This gradual and\r\ncontinuous progress of the European race toward the Rocky mountains, has\r\nthe solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising\r\nunabatedly, and daily driven onward by the hand of God.\r\n\r\nWithin this first line of conquering settlers, towns are built, and\r\nvast states founded. In 1790 there were only a few thousand pioneers\r\nsprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi; and at the present day\r\nthese valleys contain as many inhabitants as were to be found in\r\nthe whole Union in 1790. Their population amounts to nearly four\r\nmillions.[270] The city of Washington was founded in 1800, in the very\r\ncentre of the Union; but such are the changes which have taken place,\r\nthat it now stands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the\r\nmost remote western states are already obliged to perform a journey as\r\nlong as that from Vienna to Paris.[271]\r\n\r\nAll the states are borne onward at the same time in the path of\r\nfortune, but of course they do not all increase and prosper in the same\r\nproportion. In the north of the Union detached branches of the Allegany\r\nchain, extending as far as the Atlantic ocean, form spacious roads\r\nand ports, which are constantly accessible to vessels of the greatest\r\nburden. But from the Potomac to the mouth of the Mississippi, the coast\r\nis sandy and flat. In this part of the Union the mouths of almost all\r\nthe rivers are obstructed; and the few harbors which exist among\r\nthese lagunes, afford much shallower water to vessels, and much fewer\r\ncommercial advantages than those of the north.\r\n\r\nThis first natural cause of inferiority is united to another cause\r\nproceeding from the laws. We have already seen that slavery, which is\r\nabolished in the north, still exists in the south; and I have pointed\r\nout its fatal consequences upon the prosperity of the planter himself.\r\n\r\nThe north is therefore superior to the south both in commerce[272] and\r\nmanufacture; the natural consequence of which is the more rapid increase\r\nof population and of wealth within its borders. The states situated upon\r\nthe shores of the Atlantic ocean are already half-peopled. Most of the\r\nland is held by an owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive\r\nso many emigrants as the western states, where a boundless field is\r\nstill open to their exertions. The valley of the Mississippi is far more\r\nfertile than the coast of the Atlantic ocean. This reason, added to all\r\nthe others, contributes to drive the Europeans westward--a fact which\r\nmay be rigorously demonstrated by figures. It is found that the sum\r\ntotal of the population of all the United States has about tripled in\r\nthe course of forty years. But in the recent states adjacent to the\r\nMississippi, the population has increased thirty-one fold within the\r\nsame space of time.[273]\r\n\r\nThe relative position of the central federal power is continually\r\ndisplaced. Forty years ago the majority of the citizens of the Union was\r\nestablished upon the coast of the Atlantic, in the environs of the spot\r\nupon which Washington now stands; but the great body of the people\r\nis now advancing inland and to the north, so that in twenty years the\r\nmajority will unquestionably be on the western side of the Alleganies.\r\nIf the Union goes on to subsist, the basin of the Mississippi is\r\nevidently marked out, by its fertility and its extent, as the future\r\ncentre of the federal government. In thirty or forty years, that tract\r\nof country will have assumed the rank which naturally belongs to it. It\r\nis easy to calculate that its population, compared to that of the coast\r\nof the Atlantic, will be, in round numbers, as 40 to 11. In a few\r\nyears the states which founded the Union will lose the direction of\r\nits policy, and the population of the valleys of the Mississippi will\r\npreponderate in the federal assemblies.\r\n\r\nThis constant gravitation of the federal power and influence toward\r\nthe northwest, is shown every ten years, when a general census of the\r\npopulation is made, and the number of delegates which each state sends\r\nto congress is settled afresh.[274] In 1790 Virginia had nineteen\r\nrepresentatives in congress. This number continued to increase until the\r\nyear 1813, when it reached to twenty-three: from that time it began\r\nto decrease, and in 1833, Virginia elected only twenty-one\r\nrepresentatives.[275] During the same period the state of New York\r\nadvanced in the contrary direction; in 1790, it had ten representatives\r\nin congress; in 1813, twenty-seven; in 1823, thirty-four; and in 1833,\r\nforty. The state of Ohio had only one representative in 1803, and in\r\n1833, it had already nineteen.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine a durable union of a people which is rich and\r\nstrong, with one which is poor and weak, and if it were proved that the\r\nstrength and wealth of the one are not the causes of the weakness and\r\npoverty of the other. But union is still move difficult to maintain at a\r\ntime at which one party is losing strength, and the other is gaining it.\r\nThis rapid and disproportionate increase of certain states threatens the\r\nindependence of the others. New York might, perhaps, succeed with its\r\ntwo millions of inhabitants and its forty representatives, in dictating\r\nto the other states in congress. But even if the more powerful states\r\nmake no attempt to bear down the lesser ones, the danger still exists;\r\nfor there is almost as much in the possibility of the act as in the act\r\nitself. The weak generally mistrusts the justice and the reason of the\r\nstrong. The states which increase less rapidily than the others, look\r\nupon those which are more favored by fortune, with envy and suspicion.\r\nHence arise the deep-seated uneasiness and ill-defined agitation which\r\nare observable in the south, and which form so striking a contrast to\r\nthe confidence and prosperity which are common to other parts of the\r\nUnion. I am inclined to think that the hostile measures taken by the\r\nsouthern provinces upon a recent occasion, are attributable to no other\r\ncause. The inhabitants of the southern states are, of all the Americans,\r\nthose who are most interested in the maintenance of the Union; they\r\nwould assuredly suffer most from being left to themselves; and yet they\r\nare the only citizens who threaten to break the tie of confederation.\r\nBut it is easy to perceive that the south, which has given four\r\npresidents, Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, to the Union;\r\nwhich perceives that it is losing its federal influence, and that the\r\nnumber of its representatives in congress is diminishing from year to\r\nyear while those of the northern and western states are increasing; the\r\nsouth, which is peopled with ardent and irascible beings, is becoming\r\nmore and more irritated and alarmed. The citizens reflect upon their\r\npresent position and remember their past influence, with the melancholy\r\nuneasiness of men who suspect oppression: if they discover a law of\r\nthe Union which is not unequivocally favorable to their interests,\r\nthey protest against it as an abuse of force; and if their ardent\r\nremonstrances are not listened to, they threaten to quit an association\r\nwhich loads them with burdens while it deprives them of their due\r\nprofits. \"The tariff,\" said the inhabitants of Carolina in 1832,\r\n\"enriches the north, and ruins the south; for if this were not the case,\r\nto what can we attribute the continually increasing power and wealth\r\nof the north, with its inclement skies and arid soil; while the south,\r\nwhich may be styled the garden of America, is rapidly declining.\"[276]\r\nIf the changes which I have described were gradual, so that each\r\ngeneration at least might have time to disappear with the order of\r\nthings under which it had lived, the danger would be less: but the\r\nprogress of society in America is precipitate, and almost revolutionary.\r\nThe same citizen may have lived to see his state take the lead in the\r\nUnion, and afterward become powerless in the federal assemblies; and\r\nan Anglo-American republic has been known to grow as rapidly as a man,\r\npassing from birth and infancy to maturity in the course of thirty\r\nyears. It must not be imagined, however, that the states which lose\r\ntheir preponderance, also lose their population or their riches; no stop\r\nis put to their prosperity, and they even go on to increase more rapidly\r\nthan any kingdom in Europe.[277] But they believe themselves to be\r\nimpoverished because their wealth does not augment as rapidly as that of\r\ntheir neighbors; and they think that their power is lost, because they\r\nsuddenly come into collision with a power greater than their own.[278]\r\nThus they are more hurt in their feelings and their passions, than\r\nin their interests. But this is amply sufficient to endanger the\r\nmaintenance of the Union. If kings and peoples had only had their true\r\ninterests in view, ever since the beginning of the world, the name of\r\nwar would scarcely be known among mankind.\r\n\r\nThus the prosperity of the United States is the source of the most\r\nserious dangers that threaten them, since it tends to create in some of\r\nthe confederate states that over-excitement which accompanies a rapid\r\nincrease of fortune; and to awaken in others those feelings of envy,\r\nmistrust, and regret, which usually attend upon the loss of it. The\r\nAmericans contemplate this extraordinary and hasty progress with\r\nexultation; but they would be wiser to consider it with sorrow and\r\nalarm. The Americans of the United States must inevitably become one of\r\nthe greatest nations in the world; their offset will cover almost\r\nthe whole of North America; the continent which they inhabit is their\r\ndominion, and it cannot escape them. What urges them to take possession\r\nof it so soon? Riches, power, and renown, cannot fail to be theirs at\r\nsome future time; but they rush upon their fortune as if but a moment\r\nremained for them to make it their own.\r\n\r\nI think I have demonstrated, that the existence of the present\r\nconfederation depends entirely on the continued assent of all the\r\nconfederates; and, starting from this principle, I have inquired into\r\nthe causes which may induce any of the states to separate from the\r\nothers. The Union may, however, perish in two different ways: one of\r\nthe confederate states may choose to retire from the compact, and so\r\nforcibly sever the federal tie; and it is to this supposition that most\r\nof the remarks which I have made apply: or the authority of the federal\r\ngovernment may be progressively intrenched on by the simultaneous\r\ntendency of the united republics to resume their independence. The\r\ncentral power, successively stripped of all its prerogatives, and\r\nreduced to impotence by tacit consent, would become incompetent to\r\nfulfil its purpose; and the second Union would perish, like the first,\r\nby a sort of senile inaptitude. The gradual weakening of the federal\r\ntie, which may finally lead to the dissolution of the Union, is a\r\ndistinct circumstance, that may produce a variety of minor consequences\r\nbefore it operates so violent a change. The confederation might still\r\nsubsist, although its government were reduced to such a degree of\r\ninanition as to paralyze the nation, to cause internal anarchy, and to\r\ncheck the general prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter having investigated the causes which may induce the\r\nAnglo-Americans to disunite, it is important to inquire whether, if the\r\nUnion continues to subsist, their government will extend or contract\r\nits sphere of action, and whether it will become more energetic or more\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nThe Americans are evidently disposed to look upon their future condition\r\nwith alarm. They perceive that in most of the nations of the world, the\r\nexercise of the rights of sovereignty tends to fall under the control of\r\na few individuals, and they are dismayed by the idea that such will also\r\nbe the case in their own country. Even the statesmen feel, or affect\r\nto feel, these fears; for, in America, centralization is by no means\r\npopular, and there is no surer means of courting the majority, than by\r\ninveighing against the encroachments of the central power. The Americans\r\ndo not perceive that the countries in which this alarming tendency to\r\ncentralization exists, are inhabited by a single people; while the fact\r\nof the Union being composed of different confederate communities,\r\nis sufficient to baffle all the inferences which might be drawn from\r\nanalogous circumstances. I confess that I am inclined to consider the\r\nfears of a great number of Americans as purely imaginary; and far from\r\nparticipating in their dread of the consolidation of power in the hands\r\nof the Union, I think that the federal government is visibly losing\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nTo prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any remote\r\noccurrences, but to circumstances which I have myself observed, and\r\nwhich belong to our own time.\r\n\r\nAn attentive examination of what is going on in the United States, will\r\neasily convince us that two opposite tendencies exist in that country,\r\nlike two distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same\r\nchannel. The Union has now existed for forty-five years, and in the\r\ncourse of that time a vast number of provincial prejudices, which were\r\nat first hostile to its power, have died away. The patriotic feeling\r\nwhich attached each of the Americans to his own native state is become\r\nless exclusive; and the different parts of the Union have become more\r\nintimately connected the better they have become acquainted with each\r\nother. The post,[279] that great instrument of intellectual intercourse,\r\nnow reaches into the backwoods; and steamboats have established daily\r\nmeans of communication between the different points of the coast. An\r\ninland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodities up and down\r\nthe rivers of the country.[280] And to these facilities of nature and\r\nart may be added those restless cravings, that busymindedness, and love\r\nof self, which are constantly urging the American into active life,\r\nand bringing him into contact with his fellow-citizens. He crosses the\r\ncountry in every direction; he visits all the various populations of the\r\nland; and there is not a province in France, in which the natives are so\r\nwell known to each other as the thirteen millions of men who cover the\r\nterritory of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut while the Americans intermingle, they grow in resemblance of each\r\nother; the differences resulting from their climate, their origin, and\r\ntheir institutions diminish; and they all draw nearer and nearer to the\r\ncommon type. Every year, thousands of men leave the north to settle in\r\ndifferent parts of the Union; they bring with them their faith, their\r\nopinions, and their manners; and as they are more enlightened than the\r\nmen among whom they are about to dwell, they soon rise to the head of\r\naffairs and they adapt society to their own advantage. This continual\r\nemigration of the north to the south is peculiarly favorable to the\r\nfusion of all the different provincial characters into one national\r\ncharacter. The civilisation of the north appears to be the common\r\nstandard, to which the whole nation will one day be assimilated.\r\n\r\nThe commercial ties which unite the confederate states are strengthened\r\nby the increasing manufactures of the Americans; and the union which\r\nbegan to exist in their opinions, gradually forms a part of their\r\nhabits: the course of time has swept away the bugbear thoughts which\r\nhaunted the imaginations of the citizens in 1789. The federal power\r\nis not become oppressive; it has not destroyed the independence of\r\nthe states; it has not subjected the confederates to monarchical\r\ninstitutions; and the Union has not rendered the lesser states dependant\r\nupon the larger ones; but the confederation has continued to increase in\r\npopulation, in wealth, and in power. I am therefore convinced that the\r\nnatural obstacles to the continuance of the American Union are not so\r\npowerful at the present time as they were in 1789; and that the enemies\r\nof the Union are not so numerous.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the United States\r\nfor the last forty-five years, will readily convince us that the federal\r\npower is declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this\r\nphenomenon. When the constitution of 1789 was promulgated, the nation\r\nwas a prey to anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this confusion,\r\nexcited much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly supported\r\nbecause it satisfied an imperious want. Thus, although it was more\r\nattacked than it is now, the federal power soon reached the maximum of\r\nits authority, as is usually the case with a government which triumphs\r\nafter having braced its strength by the struggle. At that time the\r\ninterpretation of the constitution seemed to extend rather than to\r\nrepress, the federal sovereignty; and the Union offered, in several\r\nrespects, the appearance of a single and undivided people, directed in\r\nits foreign and internal policy by a single government. But to attain\r\nthis point the people had risen, to a certain extent, above itself.\r\n\r\nThe constitution had not destroyed the distinct sovereignty of the\r\nstates; and all communities, of whatever nature they may be, are\r\nimpelled by a secret propensity to assert their independence. This\r\npropensity is still more decided in a country like America, in which\r\nevery village forms a sort of republic accustomed to conduct its own\r\naffairs. It therefore cost the states an effort to submit to the federal\r\nsupremacy; and all efforts, however successful they may be, necessarily\r\nsubside with the causes in which they originated.\r\n\r\nAs the federal government consolidated its authority, America resumed\r\nits rank among the nations, peace returned to its frontiers, and public\r\ncredit was restored; confusion was succeeded by a fixed state of\r\nthings which was favorable to the full and free exercise of industrious\r\nenterprise. It was this very prosperity which made the Americans forget\r\nthe cause to which it was attributable; and when once the danger was\r\npassed, the energy and the patriotism which had enabled them to brave\r\nit, disappeared from among them. No sooner were they delivered from the\r\ncares which oppressed them, than they easily returned to their ordinary\r\nhabits, and gave themselves up without resistance to their natural\r\ninclinations. When a powerful government no longer appeared to\r\nbe necessary, they once more began to think it irksome. The Union\r\nencouraged a general prosperity, and the states were not inclined to\r\nabandon the Union; but they desired to render the action of the power\r\nwhich represented that body as light as possible. The general principle\r\nof union was adopted, but in every minor detail there was an actual\r\ntendency to independence. The principle of confederation was every\r\nday more easily admitted and more rarely applied; so that the federal\r\ngovernment brought about its own decline, while it was creating order\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this tendency of public opinion began to be manifested\r\nexternally, the leaders of parties, who live by the passions of the\r\npeople, began to work it to their own advantage. The position of the\r\nfederal government then became exceedingly critical. Its enemies were\r\nin possession of the popular favor; and they obtained the right of\r\nconducting its policy by pledging themselves to lessen its influence.\r\nFrom that time forward, the government of the Union has invariably been\r\nobliged to recede, as often as it has attempted to enter the lists with\r\nthe government of the states. And whenever an interpretation of\r\nthe terms of the federal constitution has been called for, that\r\ninterpretation has most frequently been opposed to the Union, and\r\nfavorable to the states.\r\n\r\nThe constitution invested the federal government with the right of\r\nproviding for the interests of the nation; and it has been held that no\r\nother authority was so fit to superintend the \"internal improvements\"\r\nwhich affected the prosperity of the whole Union; such, for instance, as\r\nthe cutting of canals. But the states were alarmed at a power,\r\ndistinct from their own, which could thus dispose of a portion of their\r\nterritory, and they were afraid that the central government would, by\r\nthis means, acquire a formidable extent of patronage within their own\r\nconfines, and exercise a degree of influence which they intended to\r\nreserve exclusively to their own agents. The democratic party, which has\r\nconstantly been opposed to the increase of the federal authority,\r\nthen accused the congress of usurpation, and the chief magistrate of\r\nambition. The central government was intimidated by the opposition;\r\nand it soon acknowledged its error, promising exactly to confine its\r\ninfluence, for the future, within the circle which was prescribed to it.\r\n\r\nThe constitution confers upon the Union the right of treating with\r\nforeign nations. The Indian tribes, which border upon the frontiers of\r\nthe United States, have usually been regarded in this light. As long\r\nas these savages consented to retire before the civilized settlers,\r\nthe federal right was not contested; but as soon as an Indian tribe\r\nattempted to fix its dwelling upon a given spot, the adjacent states\r\nclaimed possession of the lands and the rights of sovereignty over the\r\nnatives. The central government soon recognized both these claims; and\r\nafter it had concluded treaties with the Indians as independent\r\nnations, it gave them up as subjects to the legislative tyranny of the\r\nstates.[281]\r\n\r\nSome of the states which had been founded upon the coast of the\r\nAtlantic, extended indefinitely to the west, into wild regions, where no\r\nEuropean had ever penetrated. The states whose confines were irrevocably\r\nfixed, looked with a jealous eye upon the unbounded regions which the\r\nfuture would enable their neighbors to explore. The latter then agreed,\r\nwith a view to conciliate the others, and to facilitate the act\r\nof union, to lay down their own boundaries, and to abandon all the\r\nterritory which lay beyond those limits to the confederation at\r\nlarge.[282] Thenceforward the federal government became the owner of\r\nall the uncultivated lands which lie beyond the borders of the thirteen\r\nstates first confederated. It was invested with the right of parcelling\r\nand selling them, and the sums derived from this source were exclusively\r\nreserved to the public treasury of the Union, in order to furnish\r\nsupplies for purchasing tracts of country from the Indians, for opening\r\nroads to the remote settlements, and for accelerating the increase of\r\ncivilisation as much as possible. New states have, however, been formed\r\nin the course of time, in the midst of those wilds which were formerly\r\nceded by the inhabitants of the shores of the Atlantic. Congress has\r\ngone on to sell, for the profit of the nation at large, the uncultivated\r\nlands which those new states contained. But the latter at length\r\nasserted that, as they were now fully constituted, they ought to enjoy\r\nthe exclusive right of converting the produce of these sales to their\r\nown use. As their remonstrances became more and more threatening,\r\ncongress thought fit to deprive the Union of a portion of the privileges\r\nwhich it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832 it passed a law\r\nby which the greatest part of the revenue derived from the sale of\r\nlands was made over to the new western republics, although the lands\r\nthemselves were not ceded to them.[283]\r\n\r\n[The remark of the author, that \"whenever an interpretation of the terms\r\nof the federal constitution has been called for, that interpretation has\r\nmost frequently been opposed to the Union, and favorable to the states\"\r\nrequires considerable qualification. The instances which the author\r\ncites, are those of _legislative_ interpretations, not those made by the\r\njudiciary. It may be questioned whether any of those cited by him are\r\nfair instances of _interpretation_. Although the then president and many\r\nof his friends doubted or denied the power of congress over many of the\r\nsubjects mentioned by the author, yet the omission to exercise the\r\npower thus questioned, did not proceed wholly from doubts of the\r\nconstitutional authority. It must be remembered that all these questions\r\naffected local interests of the states or districts represented in\r\ncongress, and the author has elsewhere shown the tendency of the local\r\nfeeling to overcome all regard for the abstract interest of the Union.\r\nHence many members have voted on these questions without reference to\r\nthe constitutional question, and indeed without entertaining any doubt\r\nof their power. These instances may afford proof that the federal power\r\nis declining, as the author contends, but they do not prove any actual\r\ninterpretation of the constitution. And so numerous and various are the\r\ncircumstances to influence the decision of a legislative body like the\r\ncongress of the United States, that the people do not regard them\r\nas sound and authoritative expositions of the true sense of the\r\nconstitution, except perhaps in those very few cases, where there has\r\nbeen a constant and uninterrupted practice from the organization of the\r\ngovernment. The judiciary is looked to as the only authentic expounder\r\nof the constitution, and until a law of congress has passed that\r\nordeal, its constitutionality is open to question: of which our history\r\nfurnishes many examples ... There are errors in some of the instances\r\ngiven by our author, which would materially mislead, if not corrected.\r\nThat in relation to the Indians proceeds upon the assumption that the\r\nUnited States claimed some rights over Indians or the territory occupied\r\nby them, inconsistent with the claims of the states. But this is a\r\nmistake. As to their lands, the United States never pretended to any\r\nright in them, except such as was granted by the cessions of the states.\r\nThe principle universally acknowledged in the courts of the United\r\nStates and of the several states, is, that by the treaty with Great\r\nBritain in which the independence of the colonies was acknowledged,\r\nthe states became severally and individually independent, and as such\r\nsucceeded to the rights of the crown of England to and over the lands\r\nwithin the boundaries of the respective states. The right of the crown\r\nin these lands was the absolute ownership, subject only to the rights\r\nof occupancy by the Indians so long as they remained a tribe. This\r\nright devolved to each state by the treaty which established their\r\nindependence, and the United States have never questioned it. See 6th\r\nCranch, 87; 8th Wheaton, 502, 884; 17th Johnson's Reports, 231. On\r\nthe other hand, the right of holding treaties with the Indians has\r\nuniversally been conceded to the United States. The right of a state to\r\nthe lands occupied by the Indians, within the boundaries of such state,\r\ndoes not in the least conflict with the right of holding treaties on\r\nnational subjects by the United States with those Indians. With respect\r\nto Indians residing in any territory _without_ the boundaries of any\r\nstate, or on lands ceded to the United States, the case is different;\r\nthe United States are in such cases the proprietors of the soil, subject\r\nto the Indian right of occupancy, and when that right is extinguished\r\nthe proprietorship becomes absolute. It will be seen, then, that\r\nin relation to the Indians and their lands, no question could arise\r\nrespecting the interpretation of the constitution. The observation that\r\n\"as soon as an Indian tribe attempted to fix its dwelling upon a given\r\nspot, the adjacent states claimed possession of the lands, and the\r\nrights of sovereignty over the natives\"--is a strange compound of error\r\nand of truth. As above remarked, the Indian right of occupancy has ever\r\nbeen recognized by the states, with the exception of the case referred\r\nto by the author, in which Georgia claimed the right to possess certain\r\nlands occupied by the Cherokees. This was anomalous, and grew out\r\nof treaties and cessions, the details of which are too numerous and\r\ncomplicated for the limits of a note. But in no other cases have the\r\nstates ever claimed the possession of lands occupied by Indians, without\r\nhaving previously extinguished their right by purchase.\r\n\r\nAs to the rights of sovereignty over the natives, the principle admitted\r\nin the United States is that all persons within the territorial limits\r\nof a state are and of necessity must be, subject to the jurisdiction of\r\nits laws. While the Indian tribes were numerous, distinct, and separate\r\nfrom the whites, and possessed a government of their own, the state\r\nauthorities, from considerations of policy, abstained from the exercise\r\nof criminal jurisdiction for offences committed by the Indians among\r\nthemselves, although for offences against the whites they were subjected\r\nto the operation of the state laws. But as these tribes diminished\r\nin numbers, as those who remained among them became enervated by bad\r\nhabits, and ceased to exercise any effectual government, humanity\r\ndemanded that the power of the states should be interposed to protect\r\nthe miserable remnants from the violence and outrage of each other. The\r\nfirst recorded instance of interposition in such a case was in 1821,\r\nwhen an Indian of the Seneca tribe in the state of New York was tried\r\nand convicted of murder on a squaw of the tribe. The courts declared\r\ntheir competency to take cognizance of such offences, and the\r\nlegislature confirmed the declaration by a law.--Another instance of\r\nwhat the author calls interpretation of the constitution against the\r\ngeneral government, is given by him in the proposed act of 1832, which\r\npassed both houses of congress, but was vetoed by the president, by\r\nwhich, as he says, \"the greatest part of the revenue derived from the\r\nsale of lands, was made over to the new western republics.\" But this act\r\nwas not founded on any doubt of the title of the United States to the\r\nlands in question, or of its constitutional power over them, and cannot\r\nbe cited as any evidence of the interpretation of the constitution. An\r\nerror of fact in this statement ought to be corrected. The bill to which\r\nthe author refers, is doubtless that usually called Mr. Clay's land\r\nbill. Instead of making over the greatest part of the revenue to the new\r\nstates, it appropriated twelve and a half per cent. to them, in addition\r\nto five per cent. which had been originally granted for the purpose\r\nof making roads. See Niles's Register, vol. 42, p. 355.--_American\r\nEditor._]\r\n\r\nThe slightest observation in the United States enables one to appreciate\r\nthe advantages which the country derives from the bank. These advantages\r\nare of several kinds, but one of them is peculiarly striking to the\r\nstranger. The bank-notes of the United States are taken upon the borders\r\nof the desert for the same value as at Philadelphia, where the bank\r\nconducts its operations.[284]\r\n\r\nThe bank of the United States is nevertheless an object of great\r\nanimosity. Its directors have proclaimed their hostility to the\r\npresident; and they are accused, not without some show of probability,\r\nof having abused their influence to thwart his election. The president\r\ntherefore attacks the establishment which they represent, with all the\r\nwarmth of personal enmity; and he is encouraged in the pursuit of\r\nhis revenge by the conviction that he is supported by the secret\r\npropensities of the majority. The bank may be regarded as the great\r\nmonetary tie of the Union, just as congress is the great legislative\r\ntie; and the same passions which tend to render the states independent\r\nof the central power, contribute to the overthrow of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe bank of the United States always holds a great number of the notes\r\nissued by the provincial banks, which it can at any time oblige them to\r\nconvert into cash. It has itself nothing to fear from a similar demand,\r\nas the extent of its resources enables it to meet all claims. But\r\nthe existence of the provincial banks is thus threatened, and their\r\noperations are restricted, since they are only able to issue a quantity\r\nof notes duly proportioned to their capital. They submit with impatience\r\nto this salutary control. The newspapers which they have bought over,\r\nand the president, whose interest renders him their instrument, attack\r\nthe bank with the greatest vehemence. They rouse the local passions,\r\nand the blind democratic instinct of the country to aid their cause; and\r\nthey assert that the bank-directors form a permanent aristocratic body,\r\nwhose influence must ultimately be felt in the government, and must\r\naffect those principles of equality upon which society rests in America.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the bank and its opponents is only an incident in\r\nthe great struggle which is going on in America between the provinces\r\nand the central power; between the spirit of democratic independence,\r\nand the spirit of gradation and subordination. I do not mean that the\r\nenemies of the bank are identically the same individuals, who, on other\r\npoints, attack the federal government; but I assert that the attacks\r\ndirected against the bank of the United States originate in the\r\npropensities which militate against the federal government; and that the\r\nvery numerous opponents of the former afford a deplorable symptom of the\r\ndecreasing support of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Union has never displayed so much weakness as in the celebrated\r\nquestion of the tariff.[285] The wars of the French revolution and of\r\n1812 had created manufacturing establishments in the north of the Union,\r\nby cutting off all free communication between America and Europe. When\r\npeace was concluded, and the channel of intercourse reopened by which\r\nthe produce of Europe was transmitted to the New World, the Americans\r\nthought fit to establish a system of import duties, for the twofold\r\npurpose of protecting their incipient manufactures, and of paying off\r\nthe amount of the debt contracted during the war. The southern states,\r\nwhich have no manufactures to encourage, and which are exclusively\r\nagricultural, soon complained of this measure. Such were the simple\r\nfacts, and I do not pretend to examine in this place whether their\r\ncomplaints were well founded or unjust.\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1820, South Carolina declared, in a petition\r\nto Congress, that the tariff was \"unconstitutional, oppressive, and\r\nunjust.\" And the states of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama,\r\nand Mississippi, subsequently remonstrated against it with more or less\r\nvigor. But Congress, far from lending an ear to these complaints, raised\r\nthe scale of tariff duties in the years 1824 and 1828, and recognized\r\nanew the principle on which it was founded. A doctrine was then\r\nproclaimed, or rather revived, in the south, which took the name of\r\nnullification.\r\n\r\nI have shown in the proper place that the object of the federal\r\nconstitution was not to form a league, but to create a national\r\ngovernment. The Americans of the United States form a sole and undivided\r\npeople, in all the cases which are specified by that constitution; and\r\nupon these points the will of the nation is expressed, as it is in all\r\nconstitutional nations, by the voice of the majority. When the majority\r\nhas pronounced its decision, it is the duty of the minority to submit.\r\nSuch is the sound legal doctrine, and the only one which agrees with the\r\ntext of the constitution, and the known intention of those who framed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of nullification in the south maintain, on the contrary,\r\nthat the intention of the Americans in uniting was not to reduce\r\nthemselves to the condition of one and the same people; that they meant\r\nto constitute a league of independent states; and that each state,\r\nconsequently, retains its entire sovereignty, if not _de facto_, at\r\nleast _de jure_; and has the right of putting its own construction\r\nupon the laws of congress, and of suspending their execution within the\r\nlimits of its own territory, if they are held to be unconstitutional or\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\nThe entire doctrine of nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered\r\nby Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that party in the south, before\r\nthe senate of the United States, in the year 1833: \"The constitution is\r\na compact to which the states were parties in their sovereign capacity;\r\nnow, whenever a contract is entered into by parties which acknowledge\r\nno tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort, each of\r\nthem has a right to judge for himself in relation to the nature,\r\nextent, and obligations of the instrument.\" It is evident that a similar\r\ndoctrine destroys the very basis of the federal constitution, and brings\r\nback all the evils of the old confederation, from which the Americans\r\nwere supposed to have had a safe deliverance.\r\n\r\nWhen South Carolina perceived that Congress turned a deaf ear to its\r\nremonstrances, it threatened to apply the doctrine of nullification to\r\nthe federal tariff bill. Congress persisted in its former system; and at\r\nlength the storm broke out. In the course of 1832 the citizens of South\r\nCarolina[286] named a national [state] convention, to consult upon the\r\nextraordinary measures which they were called upon to take; and on the\r\n24th November of the same year, this convention promulgated a law, under\r\nthe form of a decree, which annulled the federal law of the tariff,\r\nforbade the levy of the imposts which that law commands, and refused\r\nto recognize the appeal which might be made to the federal courts of\r\nlaw.[287] This decree was only to be put into execution in the ensuing\r\nmonth of February, and it was intimated, that if Congress modified the\r\ntariff before that period, South Carolina might be induced to proceed no\r\nfarther with her menaces; and a vague desire was afterward expressed\r\nof submitting the question to an extraordinary assembly of all the\r\nconfederate states.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime South Carolina armed her militia, and prepared for war.\r\nBut congress, which had slighted its suppliant subjects, listened to\r\ntheir complaints as soon as they were found to have taken up arms.[288]\r\nA law was passed, by which the tariff duties were to be progressively\r\nreduced for ten years, until they were brought so low as not to exceed\r\nthe amount of supplies necessary to the government.[289] Thus congress\r\ncompletely abandoned the principle of the tariff; and substituted a mere\r\nfiscal impost for a system of protective duties.[290] The government of\r\nthe Union, in order to conceal its defeat, had recourse to an expedient\r\nwhich is very much in vogue with feeble governments. It yielded the\r\npoint _de facto_, but it remained inflexible upon the principles in\r\nquestion; and while congress was altering the tariff law, it passed\r\nanother bill, by which the president was invested with extraordinary\r\npowers, enabling him to overcome by force a resistance which was then no\r\nlonger to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nBut South Carolina did not consent to leave the Union in the enjoyment\r\nof these scanty trophies of success: the same national [state]\r\nconvention which annulled the tariff bill, met again, and accepted the\r\nproffered concession: but at the same time it declared its unabated\r\nperseverance in the doctrine of nullification; and to prove what it\r\nsaid, it annulled the law investing the president with extraordinary\r\npowers, although it was very certain that the clauses of that law would\r\nnever be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the controversies of which I have been speaking have taken\r\nplace under the presidency of General Jackson; and it cannot be denied\r\nthat in the question of the tariff he has supported the claims of\r\nthe Union with vigor and with skill. I am however of opinion that the\r\nconduct of the individual who now represents the federal government, may\r\nbe reckoned as one of the dangers which threaten its continuance.\r\n\r\nSome persons in Europe have formed an opinion of the possible influence\r\nof General Jackson upon the affairs of his country, which appears highly\r\nextravagant to those who have seen more of the subject. We have\r\nbeen told that General Jackson has won sundry battles, that he is\r\nan energetic man, prone by nature and by habit to the use of force,\r\ncovetous of power, and a despot by taste. All this may perhaps be\r\ntrue; but the inferences which have been drawn from these truths are\r\nexceedingly erroneous. It has been imagined that General Jackson is bent\r\non establishing a dictatorship in America, on introducing a military\r\nspirit, and on giving a degree of influence to the central authority\r\nwhich cannot but be dangerous to provincial liberties. But in America,\r\nthe time for similar undertakings, and the age for men of this kind, is\r\nnot yet come; if General Jackson had entertained a hope of exercising\r\nhis authority in this manner, he would infallibly have forfeited his\r\npolitical station, and compromised his life; accordingly he has not been\r\nso imprudent as to make any such attempt.\r\n\r\nFar from wishing to extend the federal power, the president belongs\r\nto the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the bare and\r\nprecise letter of the constitution, and which never puts a construction\r\nupon that act, favorable to the government of the Union; far from\r\nstanding forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is\r\nthe agent of all the jealousies of the states; and he was placed in the\r\nlofty station he occupies, by the passions of the people which are most\r\nopposed to the central government. It is by perpetually flattering these\r\npassions, that he maintains his station and his popularity. General\r\nJackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its\r\npropensities, and its demands; say rather, that he anticipates and\r\nforestalls them.\r\n\r\nWhenever the governments of the states come into collision with that\r\nof the Union, the president is generally the first to question his own\r\nrights: he almost always outstrips the legislature; and when the extent\r\nof the federal power is controverted he takes part, as it were, against\r\nhimself; he conceals his official interests, and extinguishes his own\r\nnatural inclinations. Not indeed that he is naturally weak or hostile\r\nto the Union; for when the majority decided against the claims of the\r\npartisans of nullification, he put himself at its head, asserted the\r\ndoctrines which the nation held, distinctly and energetically, and was\r\nthe first to recommend forcible measures; but General Jackson appears to\r\nme, if I may use the American expressions, to be a federalist by taste,\r\nand a republican by calculation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he\r\nfeels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the\r\npursuit of the objects which the community approves, or of those which\r\nit does not look upon with a jealous eye. He is supported by a power\r\nwith which his predecessors were unacquainted; and he tramples on his\r\npersonal enemies wherever they cross his path, with a facility which no\r\nformer president ever enjoyed; he takes upon himself the responsibility\r\nof measures which no one, before him, would have ventured to attempt;\r\nhe even treats the national representatives with disdain approaching\r\nto insult; he puts his veto upon the laws of congress, and frequently\r\nneglects to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes\r\ntreats his master roughly. The power of General Jackson perpetually\r\nincreases; but that of the President declines: in his hands the federal\r\ngovernment is strong, but it will pass enfeebled into the hands of his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nI am strangely mistaken if the federal government of the United States\r\nbe not constantly losing strength, retiring gradually from public\r\naffairs, and narrowing its circle of action more and more. It is\r\nnaturally feeble, but it now abandons even its pretensions to strength.\r\nOn the other hand, I thought that I remarked a more lively sense of\r\nindependence, and a more decided attachment to provincial government, in\r\nthe states. The Union is to subsist, but to subsist as a shadow; it\r\nis to be strong in certain cases, and weak in all others; in time of\r\nwarfare, it is to be able to concentrate all the forces of the nation\r\nand all the resources of the country in its hands; and in time of\r\npeace its existence is to be scarcely perceptible: as if this alternate\r\ndebility and vigor were natural or possible.\r\n\r\nI do not foresee anything for the present which may be able to\r\ncheck this general impulse of public opinion: the causes in which it\r\noriginated do not cease to operate with the same effect. The change will\r\ntherefore go on, and it may be predicted that, unless some extraordinary\r\nevent occurs, the government of the Union will grow weaker and weaker\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that the period is still remote, at which the federal\r\npower will be entirely extinguished by its inability to protect itself\r\nand to maintain peace in the country. The Union is sanctioned by\r\nthe manners and desires of the people; its results are palpable, its\r\nbenefits visible. When it is perceived that the weakness of the federal\r\ngovernment compromises the existence of the Union, I do not doubt that a\r\nreaction will take place with a view to increase its strength.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States is, of all the federal governments\r\nwhich have hitherto been established, the one which is most naturally\r\ndestined to act. As long as it is only indirectly assailed by the\r\ninterpretation of its laws, and as long as its substance is not\r\nseriously altered, a change of opinion, an internal crisis, or a war,\r\nmay restore all the vigor which it requires. The point which I have\r\nbeen most anxious to put in a clear light is simply this; many people,\r\nespecially in France, imagine that a change of opinion is going on in\r\nthe United States, which is favorable to a centralization of power in\r\nthe hands of the president and the congress. I hold that a contrary\r\ntendency may be distinctly observed. So far is the federal government\r\nfrom acquiring strength, and from threatening the sovereignty of the\r\nstates, as it grows older, that I maintain it to be growing weaker and\r\nweaker, and that the sovereignty of the Union alone is in danger. Such\r\nare the facts which the present time discloses. The future conceals the\r\nfinal result of this tendency, and the events which may check, retard,\r\nor accelerate, the changes I have described; but I do not affect to be\r\nable to remove the veil which hides them from our sight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOF THE REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND WHAT THEIR\r\nCHANCES OF DURATION ARE.\r\n\r\nThe Union is Accidental.--The Republican Institutions have more prospect\r\nof Permanence.--A Republic for the Present the Natural State of the\r\nAnglo-Americans.--Reason of this.--In order to destroy it, all Laws\r\nmust be changed at the same time, and a great alteration take place\r\nin Manners.--Difficulties experienced by the Americans in creating an\r\nAristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe dismemberment of the Union, by the introduction of war into the\r\nheart of those states which are now confederate, with standing armies, a\r\ndictatorship, and a heavy taxation, might eventually compromise the fate\r\nof the republican institutions. But we ought not to confound the future\r\nprospects of the republic with those of the Union. The Union is an\r\naccident, which will last only so long as circumstances are favorable to\r\nits existence; but a republican form of government seems to me to be the\r\nnatural state of the Americans; which nothing but the continued action\r\nof hostile causes, always acting in the same direction, could change\r\ninto a monarchy. The Union exists principally in the law which formed\r\nit; one revolution, one change in public opinion, might destroy it for\r\never; but the republic has a much deeper foundation to rest upon.\r\n\r\nWhat is understood by republican government in the United States, is the\r\nslow and quiet action of society upon itself. It is a regular state of\r\nthings really founded upon the enlightened will of the people. It is\r\na conciliatory government under which resolutions are allowed time to\r\nripen, and in which they are deliberately discussed, and executed with\r\nmature judgment. The republicans in the United States set a high value\r\nupon morality, respect religious belief, and acknowledge the existence\r\nof rights. They profess to think that a people ought to be moral,\r\nreligious, and temperate, in proportion as it is free. What is called\r\nthe republic in the United States, is the tranquil rule of the majority,\r\nwhich, after having had time to examine itself, and to give proof of its\r\nexistence, is the common source of all the powers of the state. But the\r\npower of the majority is not of itself unlimited. In the moral world\r\nhumanity, justice, and reason, enjoy an undisputed supremacy; in the\r\npolitical world vested rights are treated with no less deference. The\r\nmajority recognizes these two barriers; and if it now and then overstep\r\nthem, it is because, like individuals, it has passions, and like them,\r\nit is prone to do what is wrong, while it discerns what is right.\r\n\r\nBut the demagogues of Europe have made strange discoveries. A republic\r\nis not, according to them, the rule of the majority, as has hitherto\r\nbeen taught, but the rule of those who are strenuous partisans of\r\nthe majority. It is not the people who preponderates in this kind of\r\ngovernment, but those who best know what is for the good of the people.\r\nA happy distinction, which allows men to act in the name of nations\r\nwithout consulting them, and to claim their gratitude while their rights\r\nare spurned. A republican government, moreover, is the only one which\r\nclaims the right of doing whatever it chooses, and despising what men\r\nhave hitherto respected, from the highest moral obligations to the\r\nvulgar rules of common sense. It had been supposed, until our time,\r\nthat despotism was odious, under whatever form it appeared. But it is\r\na discovery of modern days that there are such things as legitimate\r\ntyranny and holy injustice, provided they are exercised in the name of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe ideas which the Americans have adopted respecting the republican\r\nform of government, render it easy for them to live under it, and ensure\r\nits duration. If, in their country, this form be often practically bad,\r\nat least it is theoretically good; and, in the end, the people always\r\nacts in conformity with it.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, at the foundation of the states, and it would still\r\nbe difficult, to establish a central administration in America. The\r\ninhabitants are dispersed over too great a space, and separated by too\r\nmany natural obstacles, for one man to undertake to direct the details\r\nof their existence. America is therefore pre-eminently the country of\r\nprovincial and municipal government. To this cause, which was plainly\r\nfelt by all the Europeans of the New World, the Anglo-Americans added\r\nseveral others peculiar to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the settlement of the North American colonies, municipal\r\nliberty had already penetrated into the laws as well as the manners\r\nof the English, and the emigrants adopted it, not only as a necessary\r\nthing, but as a benefit which they knew how to appreciate. We have\r\nalready seen the manner in which the colonies were founded: every\r\nprovince, and almost every district, was peopled separately by men who\r\nwere strangers to each other, or who associated with very different\r\npurposes. The English settlers in the United States, therefore, early\r\nperceived that they were divided into a great number of small and\r\ndistinct communities which belonged to no common centre; and that it\r\nwas needful for each of these little communities to take care of its own\r\naffairs, since there did not appear to be any central authority which\r\nwas naturally bound and easily enabled to provide for them. Thus, the\r\nnature of the country, the manner in which the British colonies were\r\nfounded, the habits of the first emigrants, in short everything, united\r\nto promote, in an extra-ordinary degree, municipal and provincial\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, therefore, the mass of the institutions of the\r\ncountry is essentially republican; and in order permanently to destroy\r\nthe laws which form the basis of the republic, it would be necessary to\r\nabolish all the laws at once. At the present day, it would be even more\r\ndifficult for a party to succeed in founding a monarchy in the\r\nUnited States, than for a set of men to proclaim that France should\r\nhenceforward be a republic. Royalty would not find a system of\r\nlegislation prepared for it beforehand; and a monarchy would then exist,\r\nreally surrounded by republican institutions. The monarchical principle\r\nwould likewise have great difficulty in penetrating into the manners of\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated\r\ndoctrine bearing no relation to the prevailing manners and ideas of the\r\npeople: it may, on the contrary, be regarded as the last link of a chain\r\nof opinions which binds the whole Anglo-American world. That Providence\r\nhas given to every human being the degree of reason necessary to direct\r\nhimself in the affairs which interest him exclusively; such is the grand\r\nmaxim upon which civil and political society rests in the United States.\r\nThe father of a family applies it to his children; the master to his\r\nservants; the township to its officers; the province to its townships;\r\nthe state to the provinces; the Union to the states; and when extended\r\nto the nation, it becomes the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\nThus, in the United States, the fundamental principle of the republic\r\nis the same which governs the greater part of human actions; republican\r\nnotions insinuate themselves into all the ideas, opinions, and habits\r\nof the Americans, while they are formally recognized by the legislation:\r\nand before this legislation can be altered, the whole community must\r\nundergo very serious changes. In the United States, even the religion of\r\nmost of the citizens is republican, since it submits the truths of the\r\nother world to private judgment: as in politics the care of its temporal\r\ninterests is abandoned to the good sense of the people. Thus every man\r\nis allowed freely to take that road which he thinks will lead him to\r\nheaven; just as the law permits every citizen to have the right of\r\nchoosing his government.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all having the\r\nsame tendency, can substitute for this combination of laws, opinions,\r\nand manners, a mass of opposite opinions, manners and laws.\r\n\r\nIf republican principles are to perish in America, they can only yield\r\nafter a laborious social process, often interrupted, and as often\r\nresumed; they will have many apparent revivals, and will not become\r\ntotally extinct until an entirely new people shall have succeeded to\r\nthat which now exists. Now, it must be admitted that there is no symptom\r\nor presage of the approach of such a revolution. There is nothing more\r\nstriking to a person newly arrived in the United States, than the kind\r\nof tumultuous agitation in which he finds political society. The laws\r\nare incessantly changing, and at first sight it seems impossible that a\r\npeople so variable in its desires should avoid adopting, within a short\r\nspace of time, a completely new form of government. Such apprehensions\r\nare, however, premature; the instability which affects political\r\ninstitutions is of two kinds, which ought not to be confounded: the\r\nfirst, which modifies secondary laws, is not incompatible with a very\r\nsettled state of society; the other shakes the very foundations of the\r\nconstitution, and attacks the fundamental principles of legislation;\r\nthis species of instability is always followed by troubles and\r\nrevolutions, and the nation which suffers under it, is in a state of\r\nviolent transition.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that these two kinds of legislative instability have\r\nno necessary connexion; for they have been found united or separate,\r\naccording to times and circumstances. The first is common in the United\r\nStates, but not the second: the Americans often change their laws, but\r\nthe foundation of the constitution is respected.\r\n\r\nIn our days the republican principle rules in America, as the\r\nmonarchical principle did in France under Louis XIV. The French of\r\nthat period were not only friends of the monarchy, but they thought it\r\nimpossible to put anything in its place; they received it as we receive\r\nthe rays of the sun and the return of the seasons. Among them the royal\r\npower had neither advocates nor opponents. In like manner does\r\nthe republican government exist in America, without contention or\r\nopposition; without proofs and arguments, by a tacit agreement, a\r\nsort of _consensus universalis_. It is, however, my opinion, that, by\r\nchanging their administrative forms as often as they do, the inhabitants\r\nof the United States compromise the future stability of their\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt may be apprehended that men, perpetually thwarted in their designs\r\nby the mutability of legislation, will learn to look upon republican\r\ninstitutions as an inconvenient form of society; the evil resulting from\r\nthe instability of the secondary enactments, might then raise a doubt\r\nas to the nature of the fundamental principles of the constitution,\r\nand indirectly bring about a revolution; but this epoch is still very\r\nremote.\r\n\r\n[It has been objected by an American review, that our author is mistaken\r\nin charging our laws with instability, and in answer to the charge, the\r\npermanence of our fundamental political institutions has been contrasted\r\nwith the revolutions in France. But the objection proceeds upon a\r\nmistake of the author's meaning, which at this page is very clearly\r\nexpressed. He refers to the instability which modifies _secondary laws_,\r\nand not to that which shakes the foundations of the constitution. The\r\ndistinction is equally sound and philosophic, and those in the least\r\nacquainted with the history of our legislation, must bear witness to the\r\ntruth of the author's remarks. The frequent revisions of the statutes of\r\nthe states rendered necessary by the multitude, variety, and often\r\nthe contradiction of the enactments, furnish abundant evidence of this\r\ninstability.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be foreseen, even now, that when the Americans lose\r\ntheir republican institutions, they will speedily arrive at a despotic\r\ngovernment, without a long interval of limited monarchy. Montesquieu\r\nremarked, that nothing is more absolute than the authority of a\r\nprince who immediately succeeds a republic, since the powers which had\r\nfearlessly been intrusted to an elected magistrate are then transferred\r\nto an hereditary sovereign. This is true in general, but it is more\r\npeculiarly applicable to a democratic republic. In the United States,\r\nthe magistrates are not elected by a particular class of citizens, but\r\nby the majority of the nation; they are the immediate representatives of\r\nthe passions of the multitude; and as they are wholly dependent upon its\r\npleasure, they excite neither hatred nor fear: hence, as I have already\r\nshown, very little care has been taken to limit their influence, and\r\nthey are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary power. This\r\nstate of things has engendered habits which would outlive itself; the\r\nAmerican magistrate would retain his power, but he would cease to be\r\nresponsible for the exercise of it; and it is impossible to say what\r\nbounds could then be set to tyranny.\r\n\r\nSome of our European politicians expect to see an aristocracy arise in\r\nAmerica, and they already predict the exact period at which it will be\r\nable to assume the reins of government. I have previously observed, and\r\nI repeat my assertion, that the present tendency of American society\r\nappears to me to become more and more democratic. Nevertheless, I do not\r\nassert that the Americans will not, at some future time, restrict the\r\ncircle of political rights in their country, or confiscate those rights\r\nto the advantage of a single individual; but I cannot imagine that they\r\nwill ever bestow the exclusive exercise of them upon a privileged\r\nclass of citizens, or, in other words, that they will ever found an\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nAn aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of citizens,\r\nwho, without being very far removed from the mass of the people, are,\r\nnevertheless, permanently stationed above it: a body which it is easy\r\nto touch, and difficult to strike; with which the people are in daily\r\ncontact, but with which they can never combine. Nothing can be imagined\r\nmore contrary to nature and to the secret propensities of the human\r\nheart, than a subjection of this kind; and men, who are left to follow\r\ntheir own bent, will always prefer the arbitrary power of a king to\r\nthe regular administration of an aristocracy. Aristocratic institutions\r\ncannot subsist without laying down the inequality of men as a\r\nfundamental principle, as a part and parcel of the legislation,\r\naffecting the condition of the human family as much as it affects that\r\nof society; but these things are so repugnant to natural equity that\r\nthey can only be extorted from men by constraint.\r\n\r\nI do not think a single people can be quoted, since human society began\r\nto exist, which has, by its own free will and by its own exertions,\r\ncreated an aristocracy within its own bosom. All the aristocracies of\r\nthe middle ages were founded by military conquest: the conqueror was the\r\nnoble, the vanquished became the serf. Inequality was then imposed by\r\nforce; and after it had been introduced into the manners of the country,\r\nit maintained its own authority, and was sanctioned by the legislation.\r\nCommunities have existed which were aristocratic from their earliest\r\norigin, owing to circumstances anterior to that event, and which became\r\nmore democratic in each succeeding age. Such was the destiny of the\r\nRomans, and of the Barbarians after them. But a people, having taken its\r\nrise in civilisation and democracy, which should gradually establish an\r\ninequality of conditions until it arrived at inviolable privileges and\r\nexclusive castes, would be a novelty in the world; and nothing intimates\r\nthat America is likely to furnish so singular an example.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS ON THE CAUSES OF THE COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nThe Americans destined by Nature to be a great maritime People.--Extent\r\nof their Coasts.--Depth of their Ports.--Size of their Rivers.--The\r\ncommercial Superiority of the Anglo-Saxons less attributable, however,\r\nto physical Circumstances than to moral and intellectual Causes.--Reason\r\nof this Opinion.--Future Destiny of the Anglo-Americans as a commercial\r\nNation.--The Dissolution of the Union would not check the maritime Vigor\r\nof the States.--Reason of this.--Anglo-Americans will naturally supply\r\nthe Wants of the inhabitants of South America.--They will become, like\r\nthe English, the Factors of a great portion of the World.\r\n\r\nThe coast of the United States, from the bay of Fundy to the Sabine\r\nriver in the gulf of Mexico, is more than two thousand miles in extent.\r\nThese shores form an unbroken line, and they are all subject to the same\r\ngovernment. No nation in the world possesses vaster, deeper, or more\r\nsecure ports for shipping than the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States constitute a great civilized\r\npeople, which fortune has placed in the midst of an uncultivated\r\ncountry, at a distance of three thousand miles from the central point\r\nof civilisation. America consequently stands in daily need of European\r\ntrade. The Americans will, no doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or\r\nmanufacturing at home most of the articles which they require; but the\r\ntwo continents can never be independent of each other, so numerous are\r\nthe natural ties which exist between their wants, their ideas, their\r\nhabits, and their manners.\r\n\r\nThe Union produces peculiar commodities which are now become necessary\r\nto us, but which cannot be cultivated, or can only be raised at an\r\nenormous expense, upon the soil of Europe. The Americans only consume a\r\nsmall portion of this produce, and they are willing to sell us the rest.\r\nEurope is therefore the market of America, as America is the market\r\nof Europe; and maritime commerce is no less necessary to enable the\r\ninhabitants of the United States to transport their raw materials to\r\nthe ports of Europe, than it is to enable us to supply them with our\r\nmanufactured produce. The United States were therefore necessarily\r\nreduced to the alternative of increasing the business of other maritime\r\nnations to a great extent, if they had themselves declined to enter\r\ninto commerce, as the Spaniards of Mexico have hitherto done; or, in the\r\nsecond place, of becoming one of the first trading powers of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans have always displayed a very decided taste for the\r\nsea. The declaration of independence broke the commercial restrictions\r\nwhich united them to England, and gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to\r\ntheir maritime genius. Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union\r\nhas increased in almost the same rapid proportion as the number of its\r\ninhabitants. The Americans themselves now transport to their own shores\r\nnine-tenths of the European produce which they consume.[291] And\r\nthey also bring three-quarters of the exports of the New World to the\r\nEuropean consumer.[292] The ships of the United States fill the docks of\r\nHavre and of Liverpool; while the number of English and French vessels\r\nwhich are to be seen at New York is comparatively small.[293]\r\n\r\nThus, not only does the American merchant face competition in his own\r\ncountry, but he even supports that of foreign nations in their own ports\r\nwith success. This is readily explained by the fact that the vessels of\r\nthe United States can cross the seas at a cheaper rate than any other\r\nvessels in the world. As long as the mercantile shipping of the United\r\nStates preserves this superiority, it will not only retain what it has\r\nacquired, but it will constantly increase in prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can trade at a\r\nlower rate than other nations; and one is at first led to attribute\r\nthis circumstance to the physical or natural advantages which are within\r\ntheir reach; but this supposition is erroneous. The American vessels\r\ncost almost as much to build as our own[294]; they are not better built,\r\nand they generally last for a shorter time. The pay of the American\r\nsailor is more considerable than the pay on board European ships; which\r\nis proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be met with in the\r\nmerchant vessels of the United States. But I am of opinion that the\r\ntrue cause of their superiority must not be sought for in physical\r\nadvantages, but that it is wholly attributable to their moral and\r\nintellectual qualities.\r\n\r\nThe following comparison will illustrate my meaning. During the\r\ncampaigns of the revolution the French introduced a new system of\r\ntactics into the art of war, which perplexed the oldest generals,\r\nand very nearly destroyed the most ancient monarchies in Europe. They\r\nundertook (what had never been before attempted) to make shift without\r\na number of things which had always been held to be indispensable in\r\nwarfare; they required novel exertions on the part of their troops,\r\nwhich no civilized nations had ever thought of; they achieved great\r\nactions in an incredibly short space of time: and they risked human life\r\nwithout hesitation, to obtain the object in view. The French had less\r\nmoney and fewer men than their enemies; their resources were infinitely\r\ninferior; nevertheless they were constantly victorious, until their\r\nadversaries chose to imitate their example.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have introduced a similar system into their commercial\r\nspeculations; and they do for cheapness what the French did for\r\nconquest. The European sailor navigates with prudence; he only sets sail\r\nwhen the weather is favorable; if an unforeseen accident befalls him, he\r\nputs into port; at night he furls a portion of his canvass; and when the\r\nwhitening billows intimate the vicinity of land, he checks his way,\r\nand takes an observation of the sun. But the American neglects these\r\nprecautions and braves these dangers. He weighs anchor in the midst\r\nof tempestuous gales; by night and by day he spreads his sheets to the\r\nwind; he repairs as he goes along such damage as his vessel may have\r\nsustained from the storm; and when he at last approaches the term of his\r\nvoyage, he darts onward to the shore as if he already descried a port.\r\nThe Americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader crosses the seas so\r\nrapidly. And as they perform the same distance in a shorter time, they\r\ncan perform it at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\nThe European touches several times at different ports in the course of a\r\nlong voyage; he loses a good deal of precious time in making the harbor,\r\nor in waiting for a favorable wind to leave it; and he pays daily dues\r\nto be allowed to remain there. The American starts from Boston to go to\r\npurchase tea in China: he arrives at Canton, stays there a few days and\r\nthen returns. In less than two years he has sailed as far as the entire\r\ncircumference of the globe, and he has seen land but once. It is true\r\nthat during a voyage of eight or ten months he has drunk brackish water,\r\nand lived upon salt meat; that he has been in a continual contest with\r\nthe sea, with disease, and with the tedium of monotony; but, upon his\r\nreturn, he can sell a pound of his tea for a halfpenny less than the\r\nEnglish merchant, and his purpose is accomplished.\r\n\r\nI cannot better explain my meaning than by saying that the Americans\r\naffect a sort of heroism in their manner of trading. But the European\r\nmerchant will always find it very difficult to imitate his American\r\ncompetitor, who, in adopting the system which I have just described,\r\nfollows not only a calculation of his gain, but an impulse of his\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States are subject to all the wants and\r\nall the desires which result from an advanced stage of civilisation; but\r\nas they are not surrounded by a community admirably adapted, like that\r\nof Europe, to satisfy their wants, they are often obliged to procure for\r\nthemselves the various articles which education and habit have rendered\r\nnecessaries. In America it sometimes happens that the same individual\r\ntills his field, builds his dwelling, contrives his tools, makes his\r\nshoes, and weaves the coarse stuff of which his dress is composed.\r\nThis circumstance is prejudicial to the excellence of the work: but\r\nit powerfully contributes to awaken the intelligence of the workman.\r\nNothing tends to materialise man, and to deprive his work of the\r\nfaintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor. In a\r\ncountry like America, where men devoted to special occupations are rare,\r\na long apprenticeship cannot be required from any one who embraces a\r\nprofession. The Americans therefore change their means of gaining\r\na livelihood very readily; and they suit their occupations to the\r\nexigencies of the moment, in the manner most profitable to themselves.\r\nMen are to be met with who have successively been barristers, farmers,\r\nmerchants, ministers of the gospel, and physicians. If the American be\r\nless perfect in each craft than the European, at least there is scarcely\r\nany trade with which he is utterly unacquainted. His capacity is more\r\ngeneral, and the circle of his intelligence is enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States are never fettered by the axioms of\r\ntheir profession; they escape from all the prejudices of their present\r\nstation; they are not more attached to one line of operation than to\r\nanother; they are not more prone to employ an old method than a new\r\none; they have no rooted habits, and they easily shake off the influence\r\nwhich the habits of other nations might exercise upon their minds,\r\nfrom a conviction that their country is unlike any other, and that its\r\nsituation is without a precedent in the world. America is a land of\r\nwonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every movement\r\nseems an improvement. The idea of novelty is there indissolubly\r\nconnected with the idea of melioration. No natural boundary seems to be\r\nset to the efforts of man; and what is not yet done is only what he has\r\nnot yet attempted to do.\r\n\r\nThis perpetual change which goes on in the United States, these frequent\r\nvicissitudes of fortune, accompanied by such unforeseen fluctuations in\r\nprivate and in public wealth, serve to keep the minds of the citizens\r\nin a perpetual state of feverish agitation, which admirably invigorates\r\ntheir exertions, and keeps them in a state of excitement above the\r\nordinary level of mankind. The whole life of an American is passed like\r\na game of chance, a revolutionary crisis or a battle. As the same causes\r\nare continually in operation throughout the country, they ultimately\r\nimpart an irresistible impulse to the national character. The American,\r\ntaken as a chance specimen of his countrymen, must then be a man of\r\nsingular warmth in his desires, enterprising, fond of adventure, and\r\nabove all of innovation. The same bent is manifest in all that he does;\r\nhe introduces it into his political laws, his religious doctrines, his\r\ntheories of social economy, and his domestic occupations; he bears it\r\nwith him in the depth of the backwoods, as well as in the business of\r\nthe city. It is the same passion, applied to maritime commerce, which\r\nmakes him the cheapest and the quickest trader in the world.\r\n\r\nAs long as the sailors of the United States retain these inspiriting\r\nadvantages, and the practical superiority which they derive from them,\r\nthey will not only continue to supply the wants of the producers and\r\nconsumers of their own country, but they will tend more and more to\r\nbecome, like the English, the factors of all other peoples.[295] This\r\nprediction has already begun to be realized; we perceive that the\r\nAmerican traders are introducing themselves as intermediate agents in\r\nthe commerce of several European nations;[296] and America will offer a\r\nstill wider field to their enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe great colonies which were founded in South America by the Spaniards\r\nand the Portuguese have since become empires. Civil war and oppression\r\nnow lay waste those extensive regions. Population does not increase, and\r\nthe thinly-scattered inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares of\r\nself-defence even to attempt any melioration of their condition. Such,\r\nhowever, will not always be the case. Europe has succeeded by her own\r\nefforts in piercing the gloom of the middle ages; South America has the\r\nsame Christian laws and Christian manners as we have; she contains all\r\nthe germs of civilisation which have grown amid the nations of Europe or\r\ntheir offsets, added to the advantages to be derived from our example;\r\nwhy then should she always remain uncivilized? It is clear that the\r\nquestion is simply one of time; at some future period, which may be\r\nmore or less remote, the inhabitants of South America will constitute\r\nflourishing and enlightened nations.\r\n\r\nBut when the Spaniards and Portuguese of South America begin to feel\r\nthe wants common to all civilized nations, they will still be unable\r\nto satisfy those wants for themselves; as the youngest children of\r\ncivilisation, they must perforce admit the superiority of their elder\r\nbrethren. They will be agriculturists long before they succeed in\r\nmanufactures or commerce, and they will require the mediation of\r\nstrangers to exchange their produce beyond seas for those articles for\r\nwhich a demand will begin to be felt.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that the Americans of the north will one day supply\r\nthe wants of the Americans of the south. Nature has placed them in\r\ncontiguity; and has furnished the former with every means of knowing and\r\nappreciating those demands, of establishing a permanent connexion with\r\nthose states, and of gradually filling their markets. The merchant of\r\nthe United States could only forfeit these natural advantages if he were\r\nvery inferior to the merchant of Europe; to whom he is, on the contrary,\r\nsuperior in several respects. The Americans of the United States already\r\nexercise a very considerable moral influence upon all the people of\r\nthe New World. They are the source of intelligence, and all the nations\r\nwhich inhabit the same continent are already accustomed to consider them\r\nas the most enlightened, the most powerful, and the most wealthy members\r\nof the great American family. All eyes are therefore turned toward the\r\nUnion; and the states of which that body is composed are the models\r\nwhich the other communities try to imitate to the best of their power:\r\nit is from the United states that they borrow their political principles\r\nand their laws.\r\n\r\nThe Americans of the United States stand in precisely the same position\r\nwith regard to the peoples of South America as their fathers, the\r\nEnglish, occupy with regard to the Italians, the Spaniards, the\r\nPortuguese, and all those nations of Europe, which receive their\r\narticles of daily consumption from England, because they are less\r\nadvanced in civilisation and trade. England is at this time the natural\r\nemporium of almost all the nations which are within its reach; the\r\nAmerican Union will perform the same part in the other hemisphere; and\r\nevery community which is founded, or which prospers in the New World, is\r\nfounded and prospers to the advantage of the Anglo-Americans.\r\n\r\nIf the Union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the states which\r\nnow compose it, would undoubtedly be checked for a time; but this\r\nconsequence would be less perceptible than is generally supposed. It\r\nis evident that whatever may happen, the commercial states will remain\r\nunited. They are all contiguous to each other; they have identically the\r\nsame opinions, interests, and manners, and they are alone competent to\r\nform a very great maritime power. Even if the south of the Union were to\r\nbecome independent of the north, it would still require the service of\r\nthose states. I have already observed that the south is not a commercial\r\ncountry, and nothing intimates that it is likely to become so. The\r\nAmericans of the south of the United States will therefore be obliged,\r\nfor a long time to come, to have recourse to strangers to export their\r\nproduce, and to supply them with the commodities which are requisite to\r\nsatisfy their wants. But the northern states are undoubtedly able to act\r\nas their intermediate agents cheaper than any other merchants. They will\r\ntherefore retain that employment, for cheapness is the sovereign law\r\nof commerce. National claims and national prejudices cannot resist the\r\ninfluence of cheapness. Nothing can be more virulent than the hatred\r\nwhich exists between the Americans of the United States and the English.\r\nBut, notwithstanding these inimical feelings, the Americans derive the\r\ngreater part of their manufactured commodities from England, because\r\nEngland supplies them at a cheaper rate than any other nation. Thus the\r\nincreasing prosperity of America turns, notwithstanding the grudges of\r\nthe Americans, to the advantage of British manufactures.\r\n\r\nReason shows and experience proves that no commercial prosperity can be\r\ndurable if it cannot be united, in case of need, to naval force. This\r\ntruth is as well understood in the United States as it can be anywhere\r\nelse: the Americans are already able to make their flag respected: in a\r\nfew years they will be able to make it feared. I am convinced that the\r\ndismemberment of the Union would not have the effect of diminishing the\r\nnaval power of the Americans, but that it would powerfully contribute\r\nto increase it. At the present time the commercial states are connected\r\nwith others which have not the same interests, and which frequently\r\nyield an unwilling consent to the increase of a maritime power by which\r\nthey are only indirectly benefited. If, on the contrary, the commercial\r\nstates of the Union formed one independent nation, commerce would become\r\nthe foremost of their national interests; they would consequently be\r\nwilling to make very great sacrifices to protect their shipping, and\r\nnothing would prevent them from pursuing their designs upon this point.\r\n\r\nNations, as well as men, almost always betray the most prominent\r\nfeatures of their future destiny in their earliest years. When\r\nI contemplate the ardor with which the Anglo-Americans prosecute\r\ncommercial enterprise, the advantages which befriend them, and the\r\nsuccess of their undertakings, I cannot refrain from believing that they\r\nwill one day become the first maritime power of the globe. They are born\r\nto rule the seas, as the Romans were to conquer the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[207] See the map. [Transcriber's Note: Map of North America.]\r\n\r\n[208] The native of North America retains his opinions and the most\r\ninsignificant of his habits with a degree of tenacity which has no\r\nparallel in history. For more than two hundred years the wandering\r\ntribes of North America have had daily intercourse with the whites, and\r\nthey have never derived from them either a custom or an idea. Yet the\r\nEuropean have exercised a powerful influence over the savages: they have\r\nmade them more licentious, but not more European. In the summer of 1831,\r\nI happened to be beyond Lake Michigan, at a place called Green Bay,\r\nwhich serves as the extreme frontier between the United States and\r\nthe Indians on the northwestern side. Here I became acquainted with an\r\nAmerican officer, Major H., who, after talking to me at length on the\r\ninflexibility of the Indian character, related the following fact: \"I\r\nformerly knew a young Indian,\" said he, \"who had been educated at a\r\ncollege in New England, where he had greatly distinguished himself, and\r\nhad acquired the external appearance of a member of civilized society.\r\nWhen the war broke out between ourselves and the English, in 1810, I\r\nsaw this young man again; he was serving in our army at the head of the\r\nwarriors of his tribe; for the Indians were admitted among the ranks\r\nof the Americans, upon condition that they would abstain from their\r\nhorrible custom of scalping their victims. On the evening of the battle\r\nof ----, C. came and sat himself down by the fire of our bivouac. I\r\nasked him what had been his fortune that day: he related his exploits;\r\nand growing warm and animated by the recollection of them, he concluded\r\nby suddenly opening the breast of his coat, saying, 'You must not betray\r\nme--see here!' And I actually beheld,\" said the major, \"between his body\r\nand his shirt, the skin and hair of an English head still dripping with\r\ngore.\"\r\n\r\n[209] In the thirteen original states, there are only 6,273 Indians\r\nremaining. (See Legislative Documents, 20th congress, No. 117, p. 90.)\r\n\r\n[210] Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their report to congress, the 4th\r\nFebruary, 1829, p. 23, expressed themselves thus: \"The time when the\r\nIndians generally could supply themselves with food and clothing,\r\nwithout any of the articles of civilized life, has long since passed\r\naway. The more remote tribes, beyond the Mississippi, who live where\r\nimmense herds of buffalo are yet to be found, and who follow those\r\nanimals in their periodical migrations, could more easily than any\r\nothers recur to the habits of their ancestors, and live without the\r\nwhite man or any of his manufactures. But the buffalo is constantly\r\nreceding. The smaller animals--the bear, the deer, the beaver, the\r\notter, the muskrat, &c., principally minister to the comfort and support\r\nof the Indians; and these cannot be taken without guns, ammunition, and\r\ntraps.\r\n\r\n\"Among the northwestern Indians particularly, the labor of supplying\r\na family with food is excessive. Day after day is spent by the hunter\r\nwithout success, and during this interval his family must subsist upon\r\nbark or roots, or perish. Want and misery are around them and among\r\nthem. Many die every winter from actual starvation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians will not live as Europeans live; and yet they can neither\r\nsubsist without them, nor exactly after the fashion of their fathers.\r\nThis is demonstrated by a fact which I likewise give upon official\r\nauthority. Some Indians of a tribe on the banks of Lake Superior had\r\nkilled a European; the American government interdicted all traffic\r\nwith the tribe to which the guilty parties belonged, until they were\r\ndelivered up to justice. This measure had the desired effect.\r\n\r\n[211] \"Five years ago,\" says Volney in his Tableaux des Etats Unis, p.\r\n370, \"in going from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, a territory which now forms\r\npart of the State of Illinois, but which at the time I mention was\r\ncompletely wild (1797), you could not cross a prairie without seeing\r\nherds of from four to five hundred buffaloes. There are now none\r\nremaining; they swam across the Mississippi to escape from the hunters,\r\nand more particularly from the bells of the American cows.\"\r\n\r\n[212] The truth of what I here advance may be easily proved by\r\nconsulting the tabular statement of Indian tribes inhabiting the United\r\nStates, and their territories. (Legislative Documents, 20th congress,\r\nNo. 117, pp. 90-105.) It is there shown that the tribes of America\r\nare rapidly decreasing, although the Europeans are at a considerable\r\ndistance from them.\r\n\r\n[213] \"The Indians,\" says Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their report to\r\ncongress, p. 15, \"are attached to their country by the same feelings\r\nwhich bind us to ours; and, besides, there are certain superstitious\r\nnotions connected with the alienation of what the Great Spirit gave to\r\ntheir ancestors, which operate strongly upon the tribes who have made\r\nfew or no cessions, but which are gradually weakened as our intercourse\r\nwith them is extended. 'We will not sell the spot which contains\r\nthe bones of our fathers,' is almost always the first answer to a\r\nproposition for a sale.\"\r\n\r\n[214] See in the legislative documents of congress (Doc. 117), the\r\nnarrative of what takes place on these occasions. This curious passage\r\nis from the abovementioned report, made to congress by Messrs. Clarke\r\nand Cass, in February, 1829. Mr. Cass is now secretary of war.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians,\" says the report, \"reach the treaty-ground poor, and\r\nalmost naked. Large quantities of goods are taken there by the traders,\r\nand are seen and examined by the Indians. The women and children become\r\nimportunate to have their wants supplied, and their influence is\r\nsoon exerted to induce a sale. Their improvidence is habitual and\r\nunconquerable. The gratification of his immediate wants and desires is\r\nthe ruling passion of an Indian: the expectation of future advantages\r\nseldom produces much effect. The experience of the past is lost, and\r\nthe prospects of the future disregarded. It would be utterly hopeless\r\nto demand a cession of land unless the means were at hand of gratifying\r\ntheir immediate wants; and when their condition and circumstances are\r\nfairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that they are so anxious\r\nto relieve themselves.\"\r\n\r\n[215] On the 19th of May, 1830, Mr. Edward Everett affirmed before the\r\nhouse of representatives, that the Americans had already acquired by\r\n_treaty_, to the east and west of the Mississippi, 230,000,000 of acres.\r\nIn 1808, the Osages gave up 48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of\r\n1,000 dollars. In 1818, the Quapaws yielded up 29,000,000 acres for\r\n4,000 dollars. They reserved for themselves a territory of 1,000,000\r\nacres for a hunting-ground. A solemn oath was taken that it should be\r\nrespected: but before long it was invaded like the rest. Mr. Bell, in\r\nhis \"Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs,\" February 24th,\r\n1830, has these words: \"To pay an Indian tribe what their ancient\r\nhunting-grounds are worth to them, after the game is fled or destroyed,\r\nas a mode of appropriating wild lands claimed by Indians, has been found\r\nmore convenient, and certainly it is more agreeable to the forms of\r\njustice, as well as more merciful, than to assert the possession of\r\nthem by the sword. Thus the practice of buying Indian titles is but the\r\nsubstitute which humanity and expediency have imposed, in place of the\r\nsword, in arriving at the actual enjoyment of property claimed by the\r\nright of discovery, and sanctioned by the natural superiority allowed to\r\nthe claims of civilized communities over those of savage tribes. Up\r\nto the present time, so invariable has been the operation of certain\r\ncauses, first in diminishing the value of forest lands to the Indians,\r\nand secondly in disposing them to sell readily, that the plan of\r\nbuying their right of occupancy has never threatened to retard, in any\r\nperceptible degree, the prosperity of any of the states.\" (Legislative\r\ndocuments, 21st congress, No. 227, p. 6.)\r\n\r\n[216] This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of almost all the American\r\nstatesmen. \"Judging of the future by the past,\" says Mr. Cass, \"we\r\ncannot err in anticipating a progressive diminution of their numbers,\r\nand their eventual extinction, unless our border should become\r\nstationary, and they be removed beyond it, or unless some radical change\r\nshould take place in the principles of our intercourse with them, which\r\nit is easier to hope for than to expect.\"\r\n\r\n[217] Among other warlike enterprises, there was one of the Wampanoags,\r\nand other confederate tribes, under Metacom in 1675, against the\r\ncolonists of New England; the English were also engaged in war in\r\nVirginia in 1622.\r\n\r\n[218] See the \"Histoire de la Nouvelle France,\" by Charlevoix, and the\r\nwork entitled \"Lettres Edifiantes.\"\r\n\r\n[219] \"In all the tribes,\" says Volney, in his \"Tableau des Etats Unis,\"\r\np. 423, \"there still exists a generation of old warriors, who cannot\r\nforbear, when they see their countrymen using the hoe, from exclaiming\r\nagainst the degradation of ancient manners, and asserting that the\r\nsavages owe their decline to these innovations: adding, that they have\r\nonly to return to their primitive habits, in order to recover their\r\npower and their glory.\"\r\n\r\n[220] The following description occurs in an official document: \"Until a\r\nyoung man has been engaged with an enemy, and has performed some acts of\r\nvalor, he gains no consideration, but is regarded nearly as a woman. In\r\ntheir great war-dances all the warriors in succession strike the post,\r\nas it is called, and recount their exploits. On these occasions their\r\nauditory consists of the kinsmen, friends, and comrades of the narrator.\r\nThe profound impression which his discourse produces on them is\r\nmanifested by the silent attention it receives, and by the loud shouts\r\nwhich hail its termination. The young man who finds himself at such a\r\nmeeting without anything to recount, is very unhappy; and instances\r\nhave sometimes occurred of young warriors whose passions had been thus\r\ninflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and going off alone to seek\r\nfor trophies which they might exhibit, and adventures which they might\r\nbe allowed to relate.\"\r\n\r\n[221] These nations are now swallowed up in the states of Georgia,\r\nTennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. There were formerly in the south\r\nfour great nations (remnants of which still exist), the Choctaws, the\r\nChickasaws, the Creeks, and the Cherokees. The remnants of these four\r\nnations amounted, in 1830, to about 75,000 individuals. It is computed\r\nthat there are now remaining in the territory occupied or claimed by\r\nthe Anglo-American Union about 300,000 Indians. (See proceedings of the\r\nIndian board in the city of New York.) The official documents supplied\r\nto congress make the number amount to 313,130. The reader who is curious\r\nto know the names and numerical strength of all the tribes which inhabit\r\nthe Anglo-American territory, should consult the documents I refer to.\r\n(Legislative Documents, 28th congress, No. 117, pp. 90-105.)\r\n\r\n[222] I brought back with me to France, one or two copies of this\r\nsingular publication.\r\n\r\n[223] See in the report of the committee on Indian affairs, 21st\r\ncongress, No. 227, p. 23, the reasons for the multiplication of Indians\r\nof mixed blood among the Cherokees. The principal cause dates from the\r\nwar of independence. Many Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having taken the\r\nside of England, were obliged to retreat among the Indians where they\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n[224] Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less\r\ninfluential in North America than in any other country. The American\r\ncontinent was peopled by two great nations of Europe, the French and\r\nthe English. The former were not slow in connecting themselves with the\r\ndaughters of the natives; but there was an unfortunate affinity between\r\nthe Indian character and their own: instead of giving the tastes and\r\nhabits of civilized life to the savages, the French too often grew\r\npassionately fond of the state of wild freedom they found them in. They\r\nbecame the most dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the\r\nfriendship of the Indian by exaggerating his vices and his virtues.\r\nM. de Senonville, the governor of Canada, wrote thus to Louis XIV., in\r\n1685: \"It has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages\r\nwe ought to draw them nearer to us, but there is every reason to suppose\r\nwe have been mistaken. Those which have been brought into contact with\r\nus have not become French, and the French who have lived among them are\r\nchanged into savages, affecting to live and dress like them.\" (History\r\nof New France, by Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The Englishman, on the\r\ncontrary, continuing obstinately attached to the customs and the most\r\ninsignificant habits of his forefathers, has remained in the midst of\r\nthe American solitudes just what he was in the bosom of European cities;\r\nhe would not allow of any communication with savages whom he despised,\r\nand avoided with care the union of his race with theirs. Thus, while\r\nthe French exercised no salutary influence over the Indians, the English\r\nhave always remained alien from them.\r\n\r\n[225] There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain\r\nirresistible charm which seizes the heart of man, and carries him away\r\nin spite of reason and experience. This is plainly shown by the memoirs\r\nof Tanner. Tanner is a European who was carried away at the age of six\r\nby the Indians, and has remained thirty years with them in the woods.\r\nNothing can be conceived more appalling than the miseries which he\r\ndescribes. He tells us of tribes without a chief, families without\r\na nation to call their own, men in a state of isolation, wrecks of\r\npowerful tribes wandering at random amid the ice and snow and desolate\r\nsolitudes of Canada. Hunger and cold pursue them; every day their\r\nlife is in jeopardy. Among these men manners have lost their empire,\r\ntraditions are without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner\r\nshared in all these miseries; he was aware of his European origin; he\r\nwas not kept away from the whites by force; on the contrary, he came\r\nevery year to trade with them, entered their dwellings, and saw their\r\nenjoyments; he knew that whenever he chose to return to civilized life,\r\nhe was perfectly able to do so--and he remained thirty years in the\r\ndeserts. When he came to civilized society, he declared that the rude\r\nexistence which he described had a secret charm for him which he was\r\nunable to define: he returned to it again and again: at length he\r\nabandoned it with poignant regret; and when he was at length fixed among\r\nthe whites, several of his children refused to share his tranquil and\r\neasy situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake Superior;\r\nhe seemed to be more like a savage than a civilized being. His book is\r\nwritten without either taste or order; but he gives, even unconsciously,\r\na lively picture of the prejudices, the passions, vices, and, above all,\r\nof the destitution in which he lived.\r\n\r\n[226] The destructive influence of highly civilized nations upon others\r\nwhich are less so, has been exemplified by the Europeans themselves.\r\nAbout a century ago the French founded the town of Vincennes upon the\r\nWabash, in the middle of the desert; and they lived there in great\r\nplenty, until the arrival of the American settlers, who first ruined the\r\nprevious inhabitants by their competition, and afterward purchased their\r\nlands at a very low rate. At the time when M. de Volney, from whom I\r\nborrow these details, passed through Vincennes, the number of the French\r\nwas reduced to a hundred individuals, most of whom were about to pass\r\nover to Louisiana or to Canada. These French settlers were worthy\r\npeople, but idle and uninstructed: they had contracted many of the\r\nhabits of the savages. The Americans, who were perhaps their inferiors\r\nin a moral point of view, were immeasurably superior to them in\r\nintelligence: they were industrious, well-informed, rich, and accustomed\r\nto govern their own community.\r\n\r\nI myself saw in Canada, where the intellectual difference between the\r\ntwo races is less striking, that the English are the masters of commerce\r\nand manufacture in the Canadian country, that they spread on all sides,\r\nand confine the French within limits which scarcely suffice to contain\r\nthem. In like manner, in Louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and\r\nmanufacture centres in the hands of the Anglo-Americans.\r\n\r\nBut the case of Texas is still more striking: the state of Texas is a\r\npart of Mexico, and lies upon the frontier between that country and the\r\nUnited States. In the course of the last few years the Anglo-Americans\r\nhave penetrated into this province, which is still thinly peopled; they\r\npurchase land, they produce the commodities of the country, and supplant\r\nthe original population. It may easily be foreseen that if Mexico takes\r\nno steps to check this change, the province of Texas will very shortly\r\ncease to belong to that government.\r\n\r\nIf the different degrees, comparatively so light, which exist\r\nin European civilisation, produce results of such magnitude, the\r\nconsequences which must ensue from the collision of the most perfect\r\nEuropean civilisation with Indian savages may readily be conceived.\r\n\r\n[227] See in the legislative documents (21st congress, No. 89),\r\ninstances of excesses of every kind committed by the whites upon the\r\nterritory of the Indians, either in taking possession of a part of their\r\nlands, until compelled to retire by the troops of congress, or carrying\r\noff their cattle, burning their houses, cutting down their corn, and\r\ndoing violence to their persons.\r\n\r\nIt appears, nevertheless, from all these documents, that the claims of\r\nthe natives are constantly protected by the government from the abuse\r\nof force. The Union has a representative agent continually employed to\r\nreside among the Indians; and the report of the Cherokee agent, which\r\nis among the documents I have referred to, is almost always favorable to\r\nthe Indians. \"The intrusion of whites,\" he says, \"upon the lands of\r\nthe Cherokees would cause ruin to the poor, helpless, and inoffensive\r\ninhabitants.\" And he farther remarks upon the attempt of the state of\r\nGeorgia to establish a division line for the purpose of limiting the\r\nboundaries of the Cherokees, that the line drawn having been made by the\r\nwhites, and entirely upon _exparte_ evidence of their several rights,\r\nwas of no validity whatever.\r\n\r\n[228] In 1829 the state of Alabama divided the Creek territory into\r\ncounties, and subjected the Indian population to the power of European\r\nmagistrates.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the state of Mississippi assimilated the Choctaws and Chickasaws\r\nto the white population, and declared that any of them that should take\r\nthe title of chief would be punished by a fine of 1,000 dollars and 3\r\nyear's imprisonment. When these laws were enforced upon the Choctaws who\r\ninhabited that district, the tribes assembled, their chief communicated\r\nto them the intentions of the whites, and read to them some of the laws\r\nto which it was intended that they should submit; and they unanimously\r\ndeclared that it was better at once to retreat again into the wilds.\r\n\r\n[229] The Georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proximity of the\r\nIndians, inhabit a territory which does not at present contain more than\r\nseven inhabitants to the square mile. In France there are one hundred\r\nand sixty-two inhabitants to the same extent of country.\r\n\r\n[230] In 1818 congress appointed commissioners to visit the Arkansas\r\nterritory accompanied by a deputation of Creeks, Choctaws, and\r\nChickasaws. This expedition was commanded by Messrs. Kennerly,\r\nM'Coy, Wash Hood, and John Bell. See the different reports of the\r\ncommissioners, and their journal, in the documents of congress, No. 87\r\nhouse of representatives.\r\n\r\n[231] The fifth article of the treaty made with the Creeks in August,\r\n1790, is in the following words: \"The United States solemnly guaranty to\r\nthe Creek nation all their land within the limits of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with the Cherokees\r\nsays: \"The United States solemnly guaranty to the Cherokee nation all\r\ntheir lands not hereby ceded.\" The following article declared that if\r\nany citizen of the United States or other settler not of the Indian\r\nrace, should establish himself upon the territory of the Cherokees, the\r\nUnited States would withdraw their protection from that individual, and\r\ngive him up to be punished as the Cherokee nation should think fit.\r\n\r\n[232] This does not prevent them from promising in the most solemn\r\nmanner to do so. See the letter of the president addressed to the Creek\r\nIndians, 23d March, 1829. (\"Proceedings of the Indian Board, in the City\r\nof New York,\" p. 5.) \"Beyond the great river Mississippi, where a part\r\nof your nation has gone, your father has provided a country large enough\r\nfor all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your white\r\nbrothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the land, and\r\nyou can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as the grass\r\ngrows or the water runs, in peace and plenty. _It will be yours for\r\never_.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary of war, in a letter written to the Cherokees, April 18th,\r\n1829 (see the same work, page 6), declares to them that they cannot\r\nexpect to retain possession of the land, at the time occupied by them,\r\nbut gives them the most positive assurance of uninterrupted peace if\r\nthey would remove beyond the Mississippi: as if the power which\r\ncould not grant them protection then, would be able to afford it them\r\nhereafter!\r\n\r\n[233] To obtain a correct idea of the policy pursued by the several\r\nstates and the Union with respect to the Indians, it is necessary to\r\nconsult, 1st, \"The laws of the colonial and state governments relating\r\nto the Indian inhabitants.\" (See the legislative documents, 21st\r\ncongress, No. 319.) 2d, \"The laws of the Union on the same subject, and\r\nespecially that of March 20th, 1802.\" (See Story's Laws of the United\r\nStates.) 3d, \"The report of Mr. Cass, secretary of war, relative to\r\nIndian affairs, November 29th, 1823\".\r\n\r\n[234] December 18th, 1829.\r\n\r\n[235] The honor of this result is, however, by no means due to the\r\nSpaniards. If the Indian tribes had not been tillers of the ground at\r\nthe time of the arrival of the Europeans, they would unquestionably have\r\nbeen destroyed in South as well as in North America.\r\n\r\n[236] See among other documents, the report made by Mr. Bell in the name\r\nof the committee on Indian affairs, Feb. 24th, 1830, in which it is most\r\nlogically established and most learnedly proved, that \"the fundamental\r\nprinciple, that the Indians had no right by virtue of their ancient\r\npossession either of will or sovereignty, has never been abandoned\r\neither expressly or by implication.\"\r\n\r\nIn perusing this report, which is evidently drawn up by an able hand,\r\none is astonished at the facility with which the author gets rid of all\r\narguments founded upon reason and natural right, which he designates\r\nas abstract and theoretical principles. The more I contemplate the\r\ndifference between civilized and uncivilized man with regard to the\r\nprinciples of justice, the more I observe that the former contests the\r\njustice of those rights, which the latter simply violates.\r\n\r\n[237] It is well known that several of the most distinguished authors\r\nof antiquity, and among them Æsop and Terence, were or had been slaves.\r\nSlaves were not always taken from barbarous nations, and the chances of\r\nwar reduced highly civilized men to servitude.\r\n\r\n[238] To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have conceived\r\nof the moral and intellectual inferiority of their former slaves, the\r\nnegroes must change; but as long as this opinion subsists, to change is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[239] See Beverley's History of Virginia. See also in Jefferson's\r\nMemoirs some curious details concerning the introduction of negroes into\r\nVirginia, and the first act which prohibited the importation of them in\r\n1778.\r\n\r\n[240] The number of slaves was less considerable in the north, but the\r\nadvantages resulting from slavery were not more contested there than in\r\nthe south. In 1740, the legislature of the state of New York declared\r\nthat the direct importation of slaves ought to be encouraged as much as\r\npossible, and smuggling severely punished, in order not to discourage\r\nthe fair trader. (Kent's Commentaries, vol. ii., p. 206.) Curious\r\nresearches, by Belknap, upon slavery in New England, are to be found\r\nin the Historical Collections of Massachusetts, vol. iv., p. 193.\r\nIt appears that negroes were introduced there in 1630, but that the\r\nlegislation and manners of the people were opposed to slavery from the\r\nfirst; see also, in the same work, the manner in which public opinion,\r\nand afterward the laws, finally put an end to slavery.\r\n\r\n[241] Not only is slavery prohibited in Ohio, but no free negroes are\r\nallowed to enter the territory of that state, or to hold property in it.\r\nSee the statutes of Ohio.\r\n\r\n[242] The activity of Ohio is not confined to individuals, but the\r\nundertakings of the state are surprisingly great: a canal has been\r\nestablished between Lake Erie and the Ohio, by means of which the valley\r\nof the Mississippi communicates with the river of the north, and the\r\nEuropean commodities with arrive at New York, may be forwarded by water\r\nto New Orleans across five hundred leagues of continent.\r\n\r\n[243] The exact numbers given by the census of 1830 were: Kentucky,\r\n588,844; Ohio, 937,679. [In 1840 the census gave, Kentucky 779,828; Ohio\r\n1,519,467.]\r\n\r\n[244] Independently of these causes which, wherever free workmen abound,\r\nrender their labor more productive and more economical than that of\r\nslaves, another cause may be pointed out which is peculiar to the United\r\nStates: the sugar-cane has hitherto been cultivated with success only\r\nupon the banks of the Mississippi, near the mouth of that river in\r\nthe gulf of Mexico. In Louisiana the cultivation of the sugar-cane is\r\nexceedingly lucrative; nowhere does a laborer earn so much by his\r\nwork: and, as there is always a certain relation between the cost of\r\nproduction and the value of the produce, the price of slaves is very\r\nhigh in Louisiana. But Louisiana is one of the confederate states, and\r\nslaves may be carried thither from all parts of the Union; the price\r\ngiven for slaves in New Orleans consequently raises the value of slaves\r\nin all the other markets. The consequence of this is, that in the\r\ncountries where the land is less productive, the cost of slave labor\r\nis still very considerable, which gives an additional advantage to the\r\ncompetition of free labor.\r\n\r\n[245] A peculiar reason contributes to detach the two last-mentioned\r\nstates from the cause of slavery. The former wealth of this part of\r\nthe Union was principally derived from the cultivation of tobacco. This\r\ncultivation is specially carried on by slaves; but within the last few\r\nyears the market-price of tobacco has diminished, while the value of the\r\nslaves remains the same. Thus the ratio between the cost of production\r\nand the value of the produce is changed. The natives of Maryland and\r\nVirginia are therefore more disposed than they were thirty years ago, to\r\ngive up slave labor in the cultivation of tobacco, or to give up slavery\r\nand tobacco at the same time.\r\n\r\n[246] The states in which slavery is abolished usually do what they\r\ncan to render their territory disagreeable to the negroes as a place\r\nof residence; and as a kind of emulation exists between the different\r\nstates in this respect, the unhappy blacks can only choose the least of\r\nthe evils which beset them.\r\n\r\n[247] There is a very great difference between the mortality of the\r\nblacks and of the whites in the states in which slavery is abolished;\r\nfrom 1820 to 1831 only one out of forty-two individuals of the white\r\npopulation died in Philadelphia; but one negro out of twenty-one\r\nindividuals of the black population died in the same space of time.\r\nThe mortality is by no means so great among the negroes who are still\r\nslaves. (See Emmerson's Medical Statistics, p. 28.)\r\n\r\n[248] This is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated;\r\nrice-grounds, which are unwholesome in all countries, are particularly\r\ndangerous in those regions which are exposed to the beams of a tropical\r\nsun. Europeans would not find it easy to cultivate the soil in that part\r\nof the New World if it must necessarily be made to produce rice: but may\r\nthey not subsist without rice-grounds?\r\n\r\n[249] These states are nearer to the equator than Italy and Spain, but\r\nthe temperature of the continent of America is very much lower than that\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\n[250] The Spanish government formerly caused a certain number of\r\npeasants from the Azores to be transported into a district of Louisiana\r\ncalled Attakapas, by way of experiment. These settlers still cultivate\r\nthe soil without the assistance of slaves, but their industry is so\r\nlanguid as scarcely to supply their most necessary wants.\r\n\r\n[251] We find it asserted in an American work, entitled, \"Letters on\r\nthe Colonization Society,\" by Mr. Carey, 1833, that \"for the last forty\r\nyears the black race has increased more rapidly than the white race in\r\nthe state of South Carolina; and that if we take the average population\r\nof the five states of the south into which slaves were first introduced,\r\nviz., Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia,\r\nwe shall find that from 1790 to 1830, the whites have augmented in the\r\nproportion of 80 to 100, and the blacks in that of 112 to 100.\"\r\n\r\nIn the United States, 1830, the population of the two races stood as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nStates where slavery is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520 blacks.\r\nSlave states, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,112 blacks.\r\n\r\n[By the census of 1840, the population of the two races was as follows:\r\nStates where slavery is abolished, 9,556,065 whites; 171,854 blacks.\r\nSlave states, 4,633,153 whites; 2,581,688 blacks.]\r\n\r\n[252] This opinion is sanctioned by authorities infinitely weightier\r\nthan anything that I can say; thus, for instance, it is stated in the\r\nMemoirs of Jefferson (as collected by M. Conseil), \"Nothing is more\r\nclearly written in the book of destiny than the emancipation of the\r\nblacks; and it is equally certain that the two races will never live in\r\na state of equal freedom under the same government, so insurmountable\r\nare the barriers which nature, habit, and opinions, have established\r\nbetween them.\"\r\n\r\n[253] If the British West India planters had governed themselves, they\r\nwould assuredly not have passed the slave emancipation bill which the\r\nmother country has recently imposed upon them.\r\n\r\n[254] This society assumed the name \"The Society for the Colonization\r\nof the Blacks.\" See its annual reports; and more particularly the\r\nfifteenth. See also the pamphlet, to which allusion has already been\r\nmade, entitled \"Letters on the Colonization Society, and on its probable\r\nresults,\" by Mr. Carey, Philadelphia, April, 1833.\r\n\r\n[255] This last regulation was laid down by the founders of the\r\nsettlement; they apprehended that a state of things might arise in\r\nAfrica, similar to that which exists on the frontiers of the United\r\nStates, and that if the negroes, like the Indians, were brought into\r\ncollision with a people more enlightened than themselves, they would be\r\ndestroyed before they could be civilized.\r\n\r\n[256] Nor would these be the only difficulties attendant upon the\r\nundertaking; if the Union undertook to buy up the negroes now in\r\nAmerica, in order to transport them to Africa, the price of slaves,\r\nincreasing with their scarcity, would soon become enormous.\r\n\r\n[257] In the original, \"Voulant la servitude, il se sont laissé\r\nentrainer, malgré eux ou à leur insu, vers la liberté.\"\r\n\r\n\"Desiring servitude, they have suffered themselves, involuntarily or\r\nignorantly, to be drawn toward liberty.\"--_Reviser_.\r\n\r\n[258] See the conduct of the northern states in the war of 1812. \"During\r\nthat war,\" said Jefferson, in a letter to General Lafayette, \"four\r\nof the eastern states were only attached to the Union, like so many\r\ninanimate bodies to living men.\"\r\n\r\n[259] The profound peace of the Union affords no pretext for a standing\r\narmy; and without a standing army a government is not prepared to profit\r\nby a favorable opportunity to conquer resistance, and take the sovereign\r\npower by surprise.\r\n\r\n[260] Thus the province of Holland in the republic of the Low Countries,\r\nand the emperor in the Germanic Confederation, have sometimes put\r\nthemselves in the place of the Union, and have employed the federal\r\nauthority to their own advantage.\r\n\r\n[261] See Darby's View of the United States, pp. 64, 79.\r\n\r\n[262] See Darby's View of the United States, p. 435.\r\n\r\n[In Carey & Lea's Geography of America, the United States are said to\r\nform an area of 2,076,400 square miles.--_Translator's Note._]\r\n\r\n[The discrepancy between Darby's estimate of the area of the United\r\nStates given by the author, and that stated by the translator, is\r\nnot easily accounted for. In Bradford's comprehensive Atlas, a work\r\ngenerally of great accuracy, it is said that \"as claimed by this\r\ncountry, the territory of the United States extends from 25° to 54°\r\nnorth latitude, and from 65° 49' to 125° west longitude, over an area of\r\nabout 2,200,000 square miles.\"--_American Editor._]\r\n\r\n[263] It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the expression\r\n_Anglo-Americans_, I only mean to designate the great majority of the\r\nnation; for a certain number of isolated individuals are of course to be\r\nmet with holding very different opinions.\r\n\r\n[264] Census of 1790........ 3,929,328.  do      1830........12,856,165.\r\n [do.     1840........17,068,666.]\r\n\r\n[265] This indeed is only a temporary danger. I have no doubt that in\r\ntime society will assume as much stability and regularity in the west,\r\nas it has already done upon the coast of the Atlantic ocean.\r\n\r\n[266] Pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790.\r\n\r\n[267] The area of the state of New York is about 46,000 square miles.\r\nSee Carey & Lea's American Geography, p. 142.\r\n\r\n[268] If the population continues to double every twenty-two years, as\r\nit has done for the last two hundred years, the number of inhabitants in\r\nthe United States in 1852, will be twenty millions: in 1874, forty-eight\r\nmillions; and in 1896, ninety-six millions. This may still be the case\r\neven if the lands on the western slope of the Rocky mountains should\r\nbe found to be unfit for cultivation. The territory which is already\r\noccupied can easily contain this number of inhabitants. One hundred\r\nmillions of men disseminated over the surface of the twenty-four states,\r\nand the three dependencies, which constitute the Union, would give only\r\n702 inhabitants to the square league: this would be far below the\r\nmean population of France, which is 1,003 to the square league; or of\r\nEngland, which is 1,457; and it would even be below the population of\r\nSwitzerland, for that country, notwithstanding its lakes and mountains,\r\ncontains 783 inhabitants to the square league. (See Maltebrun, vol. vi.,\r\np. 92.)\r\n\r\n[269] See Legislative Documents, 20th congress, No. 117, p. 105.\r\n\r\n[270] 3,672,317; census 1830.\r\n\r\n[271] The distance of Jefferson, the capital of the state of Missouri,\r\nto Washington, is 1,018 miles. (American Almanac, 1831, p. 40.)\r\n\r\n[272] The following statements will suffice to show the difference which\r\nexists between the commerce of the south and that of the north:--\r\n\r\nIn 1829, the tonnage of all the merchant-vessels belonging to Virginia,\r\nthe two Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great southern states),\r\namounted to only 5,243 tons. In the same year the tonnage of the vessels\r\nof the state of Massachusetts alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (See\r\nLegislative Documents, 21st congress, 2d session, No. 140, p. 244.) Thus\r\nthe state of Massachusetts has three times as much shipping as the\r\nfour abovementioned states. Nevertheless the area of the state of\r\nMassachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its population amounts\r\nto 610,014 inhabitants; while the area of the four other states I have\r\nquoted is 210,000 square miles, and their population 3,047,767. Thus the\r\narea of the state of Massachusetts forms only one thirtieth part of the\r\narea of the four states; and its population is five times smaller than\r\ntheirs. (See Darby's View of the United States.) Slavery is prejudicial\r\nto the commercial prosperity of the south in several different ways; by\r\ndiminishing the spirit of enterprise among the whites, and by preventing\r\nthem from meeting with as numerous a class of sailors as they require.\r\nSailors are generally taken from the lowest ranks of the population. But\r\nin the southern states these lowest ranks are composed of slaves, and\r\nit is very difficult to employ them at sea. They are unable to serve as\r\nwell as a white crew, and apprehensions would always be entertained of\r\ntheir mutinying in the middle of the ocean, or of their escaping in the\r\nforeign countries at which they might touch.\r\n\r\n[273] Darby's view of the United States, p. 444.\r\n\r\n[274] It may be seen that in the course of the last ten years (1820-'30)\r\nthe population of one district, as for instance, the state of Delaware,\r\nhas increased in the proportion of 5 per cent.; while that of another,\r\nas the territory of Michigan, has increased 250 per cent. Thus the\r\npopulation of Virginia has augmented 13 per cent., and that of the\r\nborder state of Ohio 61 per cent., in the same space of time. The\r\ngeneral table of these changes, which is given in the National Calendar,\r\ndisplays a striking picture of the unequal fortunes of the different\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[275] It has just been said that in the course of the last term the\r\npopulation of Virginia has increased 13 per cent.; and it is necessary\r\nto explain how the number of representatives of a state may decrease,\r\nwhen the population of that state, far from diminishing, is actually\r\nupon the increase. I take the state of Virginia, to which I have already\r\nalluded, as my term of comparison. The number of representatives\r\nof Virginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total number of the\r\nrepresentatives of the Union, and to the relation which its population\r\nbore to that of the whole Union; in 1833, the number of representatives\r\nof Virginia was likewise proportionate to the total number of the\r\nrepresentatives of the Union, and to the relation which its population,\r\naugmented in the course of ten years, bore to the augmented population\r\nof the Union in the same space of time. The new number of Virginian\r\nrepresentatives will then be to the old number, on the one hand, as the\r\nnew number of all the representatives is to the old number; and, on the\r\nother hand, as the augmentation of the population of Virginia is to that\r\nof the whole population of the country. Thus, if the increase of the\r\npopulation of the lesser country be to that of the greater in an exact\r\ninverse ratio of the proportion between the new and the old numbers of\r\nall the representatives, the number of representatives of Virginia will\r\nremain stationary; and if the increase of the Virginian population be\r\nto that of the whole Union in a feebler ratio than the new number\r\nof representatives of the Union to the old number, the number of the\r\nrepresentatives of Virginia must decrease.\r\n\r\n[276] See the report of its committees to the convention, which\r\nproclaimed the nullification of the tariff in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n[277] The population of a country assuredly constitutes the first\r\nelement of its wealth. In the ten years (1820-'30) during which Virginia\r\nlost two of its representatives in congress, its population increased in\r\nthe proportion of 13-7 per cent.; that of Carolina in the proportion\r\nof 15 per cent.; and that of Georgia 51-5 per cent. (See the American\r\nAlmanac, 1832, p. 162.) But the population of Russia, which increases\r\nmore rapidly than that of any other European country, only augments in\r\nten years at the rate of 9-5 per cent.; of France at the rate of 7\r\nper cent.; and of Europe in general at the rate of 4-7 per cent. (See\r\nMaltebrun, vol. vi., p. 95.)\r\n\r\n[278] It must be admitted, however, that the depreciation which has\r\ntaken place in the value of tobacco, during the last fifty years, has\r\nnotably diminished the opulence of the southern planters; but this\r\ncircumstance is as independent of the will of their northern brethren,\r\nas it is of their own.\r\n\r\n[279] In 1832, the district of Michigan, which only contains 31,639\r\ninhabitants, and is still an almost unexplored wilderness, possessed\r\n940 miles of mail-roads. The territory of Arkansas, which is still more\r\nuncultivated, was already intersected by 1,938 miles of mail-roads. (See\r\nreport of the general post-office, 30th November, 1833.) The postage of\r\nnewspapers alone in the whole Union amounted to $254,796.\r\n\r\n[280] In the course of ten years, from 1821 to 1831, 271 steamboats have\r\nbeen launched upon the rivers which water the valley of the Mississippi\r\nalone. In 1829, 259 steamboats existed in the United States. (See\r\nLegislative Documents, No. 140, p. 274.)\r\n\r\n[281] See in the legislative documents already quoted in speaking of\r\nthe Indians, the letter of the President of the United States to the\r\nCherokees, his correspondence on this subject with his agents, and his\r\nmessages to Congress.\r\n\r\n[282] The first act of cession was made by the state of New York in\r\n1780; Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South and North Carolina,\r\nfollowed this example at different times, and lastly, the act of cession\r\nof Georgia was made as recently as 1802.\r\n\r\n[283] It is true that the president refused his assent to this law;\r\nbut he completely adopted it in principle. See message of 8th December,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\n[284] The present bank of the United States was established in 1816,\r\nwith a capital of 35,000,000 dollars; its charter expires in 1836. Last\r\nyear congress passed a law to renew it, but the president put his veto\r\nupon the bill. The struggle is still going on with great violence on\r\neither side, and the speedy fall of the bank may easily be foreseen.\r\n\r\n[285] See principally for the details of this affair, the legislative\r\ndocuments, 22d congress, 2d session, No 3.\r\n\r\n[286] That is to say, the majority of the people; for the opposite\r\nparty, called the Union party, always formed a very strong and active\r\nminority. Carolina may contain about 47,000 electors; 30,000 were in\r\nfavor of nullification, and 17,000 opposed to it.\r\n\r\n[287] This decree was preceded by a report of the committee by which it\r\nwas framed, containing the explanation of the motives and object of\r\nthe law. The following passage occurs in it, p. 34: \"When the rights\r\nreserved by the constitution to the different states are deliberately\r\nviolated, it is the duty and the right of those states to interfere, in\r\norder to check the progress of the evil, to resist usurpation, and to\r\nmaintain, within their respective limits, those powers and privileges\r\nwhich belong to them as _independent sovereign states_. If they were\r\ndestitute of this right, they would not be sovereign. South Carolina\r\ndeclares that she acknowledges no tribunal upon earth above her\r\nauthority. She has indeed entered into a solemn compact of union with\r\nthe other states: but she demands, and will exercise, the right of\r\nputting her own construction upon it; and when this compact is violated\r\nby her sister states, and by the government which they have created, she\r\nis determined to avail herself of the unquestionable right of judging\r\nwhat is the extent of the infraction, and what are the measures best\r\nfitted to obtain justice.\"\r\n\r\n[288] Congress was finally decided to take this step by the conduct of\r\nthe powerful state of Virginia, whose legislature offered to serve as a\r\nmediator between the Union and South Carolina. Hitherto the latter\r\nstate had appeared to be entirely abandoned even by the states which had\r\njoined her in her remonstrances.\r\n\r\n[289] This law was passed on the 2d March, 1833.\r\n\r\n[290] This bill was brought in by Mr. Clay, and it passed in four days\r\nthrough both houses of Congress, by an immense majority.\r\n\r\n[291] The total value of goods imported during the year which ended\r\non the 30th September, 1832, was 101,129,266 dollars. The value of the\r\ncargoes of foreign vessels did not amount to 10,731,039 dollars, or\r\nabout one-tenth of the entire sum.\r\n\r\n[292] The value of goods exported during the same year amounted to\r\n87,176,943 dollars; the value of goods exported by foreign vessels\r\namounted to 21,036,183 dollars, or about one quarter of the whole sum.\r\n(Williams's Register, 1833, p. 398.)\r\n\r\n[293] The tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of the\r\nUnion in the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719 tons,\r\nof which 544,571 tons were foreign vessels; they stood therefore to\r\nthe American vessels in a ratio of about 16 to 100. (National Calendar,\r\n1833, p. 304.) The tonnage of the English vessels which entered the\r\nports of London, Liverpool and Hull, in the years 1820, 1826, and 1831,\r\namounted to 443,800 tons. The foreign vessels which entered the same\r\nports during the same years, amounted to 159,431 tons. The ratio between\r\nthem was therefore about 36 to 100. (Companion to the Almanac, 1834, p.\r\n169.) In the year 1832 the ratio between the foreign and British ships\r\nwhich entered the ports of Great Britain was 29 to 100.\r\n\r\n[294] Materials are, generally speaking, less expensive in America than\r\nin Europe, but the price of labor is much higher.\r\n\r\n[295] It must not be supposed that English vessels are exclusively\r\nemployed in transporting foreign produce into England, or British\r\nproduce to foreign countries; at the present day the merchant shipping\r\nof England may be regarded in the light of a vast system of public\r\nconveyances ready to serve all the producers of the world, and to open\r\ncommunications between all peoples. The maritime genius of the Americans\r\nprompts them to enter into competition with the English.\r\n\r\n[296] Part of the commerce of the Mediterranean is already carried on by\r\nAmerican vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry. Hitherto, in speaking\r\nof the future destiny of the United States, I have endeavored to divide\r\nmy subject into distinct portions, in order to study each of them with\r\nmore attention. My present object is to embrace the whole from one\r\nsingle point; the remarks I shall make will be less detailed, but they\r\nwill be more sure. I shall perceive each object less distinctly, but I\r\nshall descry the principal facts with more certainty. A traveller, who\r\nhas just left the walls of an immense city, climbs the neighboring\r\nhill; as he goes farther off, he loses sight of the men whom he has so\r\nrecently quitted; their dwellings are confused in a dense mass; he can\r\nno longer distinguish the public squares, and he can scarcely trace out\r\nthe great thoroughfares; but his eye has less difficulty in following\r\nthe boundaries of the city, and for the first time he sees the shape of\r\nthe vast whole. Such is the future destiny of the British race in North\r\nAmerica to my eye; the details of the stupendous picture are overhung\r\nwith shade, but I conceive a clear idea of the entire subject.\r\n\r\nThe territory now occupied or possessed by the United States of America,\r\nforms about one-twentieth part of the habitable earth. But extensive as\r\nthese confines are, it must not be supposed that the Anglo-American race\r\nwill always remain within them; indeed, it has already far overstepped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was once a time at which we also might have created a great French\r\nnation in the American wilds, to counter-balance the influence of the\r\nEnglish upon the destinies of the New World. France formerly possessed\r\na territory in North America, scarcely less extensive than the whole of\r\nEurope. The three greatest rivers of that continent then flowed within\r\nher dominions. The Indian tribes which dwelt between the mouth of the\r\nSt. Lawrence and the delta of the Mississippi were unaccustomed to any\r\ntongue but ours; and all the European settlements scattered over that\r\nimmense region recalled the traditions of our country. Louisburg,\r\nMontmorency, Duquesne, Saint-Louis, Vincennes, New Orleans (for such\r\nwere the names they bore), are words dear to France and familiar to our\r\nears.\r\n\r\nBut a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious to\r\nenumerate,[297] have deprived us of this magnificent inheritance.\r\nWherever the French settlers were numerically weak and partially\r\nestablished, they have disappeared; those who remain are collected on a\r\nsmall extent of country, and are now subject to other laws. The 400,000\r\nFrench inhabitants of Lower Canada constitute, at the present time, the\r\nremnant of an old nation lost in the midst of a new people. A foreign\r\npopulation is increasing around them unceasingly, and on all sides,\r\nwhich already penetrates among the ancient masters of the country,\r\npredominates in their cities, and corrupts their language. This\r\npopulation is identical with that of the United States; it is therefore\r\nwith truth that I asserted that the British race is not confined within\r\nthe frontiers of the Union, since it already extends to the northeast.\r\n\r\nTo the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insignificant\r\nRussian settlements; but to the southwest, Mexico presents a barrier to\r\nthe Anglo-Americans. Thus, the Spaniards and the Anglo-Americans are,\r\nproperly speaking, the only two races which divide the possession of the\r\nNew World. The limits of separation between them have been settled by\r\na treaty; but although the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly\r\nfavorable to the Anglo-Americans, I do not doubt that they will\r\nshortly infringe this arrangement. Vast provinces, extending beyond\r\nthe frontiers of the Union toward Mexico, are still destitute of\r\ninhabitants. The natives of the United States will forestall the\r\nrightful occupants of these solitary regions. They will take possession\r\nof the soil, and establish social institutions, so that when the legal\r\nowner arrives at length, he will find the wilderness under cultivation,\r\nand strangers quietly settled in the midst of his inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the New World belong to the first occupants and they are\r\nthe natural reward of the swiftest pioneer. Even the countries which are\r\nalready peopled will have some difficulty in securing themselves from\r\nthis invasion. I have already alluded to what is taking place in the\r\nprovince of Texas. The inhabitants of the United States are perpetually\r\nmigrating to Texas, where they purchase land, and although they conform\r\nto the laws of the country, they are gradually founding the empire of\r\ntheir own language and their own manners. The province of Texas is still\r\npart of the Mexican dominions, but it will soon contain no Mexicans:\r\nthe same thing has occurred whenever the Anglo-Americans have come into\r\ncontact with populations of a different origin.\r\n\r\n[The prophetic accuracy of the author, in relation to the present actual\r\ncondition of Texas, exhibits the sound and clear perception with which\r\nhe surveyed our institutions and character.--_American Editor_.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the British race has acquired an amazing\r\npreponderance over all the other European races in the New World; and\r\nthat it is very superior to them in civilisation, in industry, and in\r\npower. As long as it is only surrounded by desert or thinly-peopled\r\ncountries, as long as it encounters no dense populations upon its route,\r\nthrough which it cannot work its way, it will assuredly continue to\r\nspread. The lines marked out by treaties will not stop it; but it will\r\neverywhere transgress these imaginary barriers.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the British race in the New World is\r\npeculiarly favorable to its rapid increase. Above its northern frontiers\r\nthe icy regions of the pole extend; and a few degrees below its southern\r\nconfines lies the burning climate of the equator. The Anglo-Americans\r\nare therefore placed in the most temperate and habitable zone of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the prodigious increase of population in\r\nthe United States is posterior to their declaration of independence. But\r\nthis is an error: the population increased as rapidly under the colonial\r\nsystem as it does at the present day; that is to say, it doubled in\r\nabout twenty-two years. But this proportion, which is now applied to\r\nmillions, was then applied to thousands, of inhabitants; and the same\r\nfact which was scarcely noticeable a century ago, is now evident to\r\nevery observer.\r\n\r\nThe British subjects in Canada, who are dependent on a king, augment and\r\nspread almost as rapidly as the British settlers of the United States,\r\nwho live under a republican government. During the war of independence,\r\nwhich lasted eight years, the population continued to increase without\r\nintermission in the same ratio. Although powerful Indian nations allied\r\nwith the English existed, at that time, upon the western frontiers, the\r\nemigration westward was never checked. While the enemy laid waste the\r\nshores of the Atlantic, Kentucky, the western parts of Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe states of Vermont and of Maine were filling with inhabitants. Nor\r\ndid the unsettled state of the constitution, which succeeded the war,\r\nprevent the increase of the population, or stop its progress across the\r\nwilds. Thus, the difference of laws, the various conditions of peace and\r\nwar, of order and of anarchy, have exercised no perceptible influence\r\nupon the gradual development of the Anglo-Americans. This may be readily\r\nunderstood: for the fact is, that no causes are sufficiently general\r\nto exercise a simultaneous influence over the whole of so extensive a\r\nterritory. One portion of the country always offers a sure retreat from\r\nthe calamities which afflict another part; and however great may be the\r\nevil, the remedy which is at hand is greater still.\r\n\r\nIt must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the British race in\r\nthe New World can be arrested. The dismemberment of the Union, and the\r\nhostilities which might ensue, the abolition of republican institutions,\r\nand the tyrannical government which might succeed it, may retard this\r\nimpulse, but they cannot prevent it from ultimately fulfilling the\r\ndestinies to which that race is reserved. No power upon earth can close\r\nupon the emigrants that fertile wilderness which offers resources to all\r\nindustry and a refuge from all want. Future events, of whatever nature\r\nthey may be, will not deprive the Americans of their climate or of their\r\ninland seas, of their great rivers or of their exuberant soil. Nor will\r\nbad laws, revolutions, and anarchy, be able to obliterate that love\r\nof prosperity and that spirit of enterprise which seem to be the\r\ndistinctive characteristics of their race, or to extinguish that\r\nknowledge which guides them on their way.\r\n\r\nThus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure.\r\nAt a period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the\r\nlife of a nation), the Anglo-Americans will alone cover the immense\r\nspace contained between the polar regions and the tropics, extending\r\nfrom the coasts of the Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific ocean. The\r\nterritory which will probably be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at\r\nsome future time, may be computed to equal three-quarters of Europe in\r\nextent.[298] The climate of the Union is upon the whole preferable to\r\nthat of Europe, and its natural advantages are not less great; it\r\nis therefore evident that its population will at some future time be\r\nproportionate to our own. Europe, divided as it is between so many\r\ndifferent nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars and the\r\nbarbarous manners of the Middle Ages, has notwithstanding attained a\r\npopulation of 410 inhabitants to the square league.[299] What cause can\r\nprevent the United States from having as numerous a population in time?\r\n\r\nMany ages must elapse before the divers offsets of the British race in\r\nAmerica cease to present the same homogeneous characteristics; and the\r\ntime cannot be foreseen at which a permanent inequality of conditions\r\nwill be established in the New World. Whatever differences may arise,\r\nfrom peace or from war, from freedom or oppression, from prosperity or\r\nwant, between the destinies of the different descendants of the great\r\nAnglo-American family, they will at least preserve an analogous social\r\ncondition, and they will hold in common the customs and the opinions to\r\nwhich that social condition has given birth.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, the tie of religion was sufficiently powerful\r\nto imbue all the different populations of Europe with the same\r\ncivilisation. The British of the New World have a thousand other\r\nreciprocal ties; and they live at a time when the tendency to equality\r\nis general among mankind. The Middle Ages were a period when everything\r\nwas broken up; when each people, each province, each city, and each\r\nfamily, had a strong tendency to maintain its distinct individuality. At\r\nthe present time an opposite tendency seems to prevail, and the nations\r\nseem to be advancing to unity. Our means of intellectual intercourse\r\nunite the most remote parts of the earth; and it is impossible for men\r\nto remain strangers to each other, or to be ignorant of the events which\r\nare taking place in any corner of the globe. The consequence is, that\r\nthere is less difference, at the present day, between the Europeans and\r\ntheir descendants in the New World, than there was between certain towns\r\nin the thirteenth century, which were only separated by a river. If this\r\ntendency to assimilation brings foreign nations closer to each other,\r\nit must _a fortiori_ prevent the descendants of the same people from\r\nbecoming aliens to each other.\r\n\r\nThe time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men\r\nwill be living in North America,[300] equal in condition, the progeny of\r\none race, owing their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same\r\ncivilisation, the same language, the same religion, the same habits, the\r\nsame manners, and imbued with the same opinions, propagated under the\r\nsame forms. The rest is uncertain, but this is certain; and it is a fact\r\nnew to the world--a fact fraught with such portentous consequences as to\r\nbaffle the efforts even of the imagination.\r\n\r\nThere are, at the present time, two great nations in the world, which\r\nseem to tend toward the same end, although they started from different\r\npoints; I allude to the Russians and the Americans. Both of them have\r\ngrown up unnoticed; and while the attention of mankind was directed\r\nelsewhere, they have suddenly assumed a most prominent place among the\r\nnations; and the world learned their existence and their greatness at\r\nalmost the same time.\r\n\r\nAll other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural limits, and\r\nonly to be charged with the maintenance of their power; but these are\r\nstill in the act of growth;[301] all the others are stopped, or continue\r\nto advance with extreme difficulty; these are proceeding with ease and\r\nwith celerity along a path to which the human eye can assign no term.\r\nThe American struggles against the natural obstacles which oppose\r\nhim; the adversaries of the Russian are men; the former combats the\r\nwilderness and savage life; the latter, civilisation with all its\r\nweapons and its arts; the conquests of the one are therefore gained by\r\nthe ploughshare; those of the other, by the sword. The Anglo-American\r\nrelies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends, and gives free\r\nscope to the unguided exertions and common sense of the citizens;\r\nthe Russian centres all the authority of society in a single arm; the\r\nprincipal instrument of the former is freedom; of the latter, servitude.\r\nTheir starting-point is different, and their courses are not the same;\r\nyet each of them seems to be marked out by the will of Heaven to sway\r\nthe destinies of half the globe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[297] The foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which are\r\naccustomed to free institutions and municipal government are better able\r\nthan any others to found prosperous colonies. The habit of thinking and\r\ngoverning for oneself is indispensable in a new country, where success\r\nnecessarily depends, in a great measure, upon the individual exertions\r\nof the settlers.\r\n\r\n[298] The United States already extend over a territory equal to one\r\nhalf of Europe. The area of Europe is 500,000 square leagues, and its\r\npopulation 205,000,000 of inhabitants. (Maltebrun, liv. 114, vol., vi.,\r\np. 4.)\r\n\r\n[299] See Maltebrun, liv. 116, vol. vi., p.92.\r\n\r\n[300] This would be a population proportionate to that of Europe, taken\r\nat a mean rate of 410 inhabitants to the square league.\r\n\r\n[301] Russia is the country in the Old World in which population\r\nincreases most rapidly in proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.--Page 17.\r\n\r\nFor information concerning all the countries of the West which have\r\nnot been visited by Europeans, consult the account of two expeditions\r\nundertaken at the expense of congress by Major Long. This traveller\r\nparticularly mentions, on the subject of the great American desert, that\r\na line may be drawn nearly parallel to the 20th degree of longitude[302]\r\n(meridian of Washington), beginning from the Red river and ending at\r\nthe river Platte. From this imaginary line to the Rocky mountains, which\r\nbound the valley of the Mississippi on the west, lie immense plains,\r\nwhich are almost entirely covered with sand, incapable of cultivation,\r\nor scattered over with masses of granite. In summer, these plains are\r\nquite destitute of water, and nothing is to be seen on them but herds of\r\nbuffaloes and wild horses. Some hordes of Indians are also found there,\r\nbut in no great number.\r\n\r\nMajor Long was told, that in travelling northward from the river Platte,\r\nyou find the same desert constantly on the left; but he was unable to\r\nascertain the truth of this report. (Long's Expedition, vol. ii., p.\r\n361.)\r\n\r\nHowever worthy of confidence may be the narrative of Major Long, it\r\nmust be remembered that he only passed through the country of which he\r\nspeaks, without deviating widely from the line which he had traced out\r\nfor his journey.\r\n\r\n[302] The 20th degree of longitude according to the meridian of\r\nWashington, agrees very nearly with the 97th degree on the meridian of\r\nGreenwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.--Page 18.\r\n\r\nSouth America, in the regions between the tropics, produces an\r\nincredible profusion of climbing-plants, of which the Flora of the\r\nAntilles alone presents us with forty different species.\r\n\r\nAmong the most graceful of these shrubs is the passion-flower, which,\r\naccording to Descourtiz, grows with such luxuriance in the Antilles, as\r\nto climb trees by means of the tendrils with which it is provided, and\r\nform moving bowers of rich and elegant festoons, decorated with blue and\r\npurple flowers, and fragrant with perfume. (Vol. i., p. 265.)\r\n\r\nThe _mimosa scandens_ (acacia à grandes gousses) is a creeper of\r\nenormous and rapid growth, which climbs from tree to tree, and sometimes\r\ncovers more than half a league. (Vol. iii., p. 227.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.--Page 20.\r\n\r\nThe languages which are spoken by the Indians of America, from the Pole\r\nto Cape Horn, are said to be all formed upon the same model, and subject\r\nto the same grammatical rules; whence it may fairly be concluded that\r\nall the Indian nations sprang from the same stock.\r\n\r\nEach tribe of the American continent speaks a different dialect; but\r\nthe number of languages, properly so called, is very small, a fact which\r\ntends to prove that the nations of the New World had not a very remote\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the languages of America have a great degree of regularity;\r\nfrom which it seems probable that the tribes which employ them had not\r\nundergone any great revolutions, or been incorporated, voluntarily, or\r\nby constraint, with foreign nations. For it is generally the union of\r\nseveral languages into one which produces grammatical irregularities.\r\n\r\nIt is not long since the American languages, especially those of the\r\nnorth, first attracted the serious attention of philologists, when the\r\ndiscovery was made that this idiom of a barbarous people was the product\r\nof a complicated system of ideas and very learned combinations. These\r\nlanguages were found to be very rich, and great pains had been taken at\r\ntheir formation to render them agreeable to the ear.\r\n\r\nThe grammatical system of the Americans differs from all others in\r\nseveral points, but especially in the following:--\r\n\r\nSome nations in Europe, among others the Germans, have the power of\r\ncombining at pleasure different expressions, and thus giving a complex\r\nsense to certain words. The Indians have given a most surprising\r\nextension to this power, so as to arrive at the means of connecting a\r\ngreat number of ideas with a single term. This will be easily understood\r\nwith the help of an example quoted by Mr. Duponceau, in the Memoirs of\r\nthe Philosophical Society of America.\r\n\r\n\"A Delaware woman, playing with a cat or a young dog,\" says this writer,\r\n\"is heard to pronounce the word _kuligatschis_; which is thus composed;\r\n_k_ is the sign of the second person, and signifies 'thou' or 'thy;'\r\n_uli_ is a part of the word _wulit_, which signifies 'beautiful,'\r\n'pretty;' _gat_ is another fragment of the word _wichgat_, which means\r\n'paw;' and lastly, _schis_ is a diminutive giving the idea of smallness.\r\nThus in one word the Indian woman has expressed, 'Thy pretty little\r\npaw.'\"\r\n\r\nTake another example of the felicity with which the savages of America\r\nhave composed their words. A young man of Delaware is called _pilape_.\r\nThis word is formed from _pilsit_, chaste, innocent; and _lenape_, man;\r\nviz., man in his purity and innocence.\r\n\r\nThis facility of combining words is most remarkable in the strange\r\nformation of their verbs. The most complex action is often expressed by\r\na single verb, which serves to convey all the shades of an idea by the\r\nmodification of its construction.\r\n\r\nThose who may wish to examine more in detail this subject, which I have\r\nonly glanced at superficially, should read:--\r\n\r\n1. The correspondence of Mr. Duponceau and the Rev. Mr. Hecwelder\r\nrelative to the Indian languages; which is to be found in the first\r\nvolume of the Memoirs of the Philosophical Society of America, published\r\nat Philadelphia, 1819, by Abraham Small, vol i., pp 356-464.\r\n\r\n2. The grammar of the Delaware or Lenape language by Geiberger, the\r\npreface of Mr. Duponceau. All these are in the same collection, vol.\r\niii.\r\n\r\n3. An excellent account of these works, which is at the end of the 6th\r\nvolume of the American Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.--Page 22.\r\n\r\nSee in Charlevoix, vol i., p. 235, the history of the first war which\r\nthe French inhabitants of Canada carried on, in 1610, against the\r\nIroquois. The latter, armed with bows and arrows, offered a desperate\r\nresistance to the French and their allies. Charlevoix is not a great\r\npainter, yet he exhibits clearly enough, in this narrative, the contrast\r\nbetween the European manners and those of savages, as well as the\r\ndifferent way in which the two races of men understood the sense of\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nWhen the French, says he, seized upon the beaver-skins which covered the\r\nIndians who had fallen, the Hurons, their allies, were greatly offended\r\nat this proceeding; but without hesitation they set to work in their\r\nusual manner, inflicting horrid cruelties upon the prisoners, and\r\ndevouring one of those who had been killed, which made the Frenchmen\r\nshudder. The barbarians prided themselves upon a scrupulousness\r\nwhich they were surprised at not finding in our nation; and could not\r\nunderstand that there was less to reprehend in the stripping of dead\r\nbodies, than in the devouring of their flesh like wild beasts.\r\n\r\nCharlevoix, in another place (vol. i., p. 230), thus describes the first\r\ntorture of which Champlain was an eyewitness, and the return of the\r\nHurons into their own village.\r\n\r\n\"Having proceeded about eight leagues,\" says he, \"our allies halted: and\r\nhaving singled out one of their captives, they reproached him with all\r\nthe cruelties which he had practised upon the warriors of their nation\r\nwho had fallen into his hands, and told him that he might expect to\r\nbe treated in like manner; adding, that if he had any spirit, he would\r\nprove it by singing. He immediately chanted forth his death-song, and\r\nthen his war-song, and all the songs he knew, 'but in a very mournful\r\nstrain,' says Champlain, who was not then aware that all savage music\r\nhas a melancholy character. The tortures which succeeded, accompanied by\r\nall the horrors which we shall mention hereafter, terrified the French,\r\nwho made every effort to put a stop to them, but in vain. The following\r\nnight one of the Hurons having dreamed that they were pursued, the\r\nretreat was changed to a real flight, and the savages never stopped\r\nuntil they were out of the reach of danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment they perceived the cabins of their own village, they cut\r\nthemselves long sticks, to which they fastened the scalps which had\r\nfallen to their share, and carried them in triumph. At this sight, the\r\nwomen swam to the canoes, where they received the bloody scalps from the\r\nhands of their husbands, and tied them round their necks.\r\n\r\nThe warriors offered one of these horrible trophies to Champlain; they\r\nalso presented him with some bows and arrows--the only spoils of the\r\nIroquois which they had ventured to seize--entreating him to show them\r\nto the king of France.\r\n\r\nChamplain lived a whole winter quite alone among these barbarians,\r\nwithout being under any alarm for his person or property.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.--Page 36.\r\n\r\nAlthough the puritanical strictness which presided over the\r\nestablishment of the English colonies in America is now much relaxed,\r\nremarkable traces of it are still found in their habits and their laws.\r\nIn 1792, at the very time when the anti-Christian republic of France\r\nbegan its ephemeral existence, the legislative body of Massachusetts\r\npromulgated the following law, to compel the citizens to observe the\r\nsabbath. We give the preamble, and the principal articles of this law,\r\nwhich is worthy of the reader's attention.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas,\" says the legislator, \"the observation of the Sunday is\r\nan affair of public interest; inasmuch as it produces a necessary\r\nsuspension of labor, leads men to reflect upon the duties of life and\r\nthe errors to which human nature is liable, and provides for the public\r\nand private worship of God the creator and governor of the universe,\r\nand for the performance of such acts of charity as are the ornament and\r\ncomfort of Christian societies:--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, irreligious or light-minded persons, forgetting the duties\r\nwhich the sabbath imposes, and the benefits which these duties confer on\r\nsociety, are known to profane its sanctity, by following their pleasures\r\nor their affairs; this way of acting being contrary to their own\r\ninterest as Christians, and calculated to annoy those who do not follow\r\ntheir example; being also of great injury to society at large, by\r\nspreading a taste for dissipation and dissolute manners;--\r\n\r\n\"Be it enacted and ordained by the governor, council, and\r\nrepresentatives convened in general court of assembly, that all and\r\nevery person and persons shall, on that day, carefully apply themselves\r\nto the duties of religion and piety; that no tradesman or laborer shall\r\nexercise his ordinary calling, and that no game or recreation shall be\r\nused on the Lord's day, upon pain of forfeiting ten shillings;--\r\n\r\n\"That no one shall travel on that day, or any part thereof, under pain\r\nof forfeiting twenty shillings; that no vessel shall leave a harbor of\r\nthe colony; that no person shall keep outside the meetinghouse during\r\nthe time of public worship, or profane the time by playing or talking,\r\non penalty of five shillings.\r\n\r\n\"Public-houses shall not entertain any other than strangers or lodgers,\r\nunder a penalty of five shillings for every person found drinking or\r\nabiding therein.\r\n\r\n\"Any person in health who, without sufficient reason, shall omit to\r\nworship God in public during three months, shall be condemned to a fine\r\nof ten shillings.\r\n\r\n\"Any person guilty of misbehavior in a place of public worship shall be\r\nfined from five to forty shillings.\r\n\r\n\"These laws are to be enforced by the tithing-men of each township, who\r\nhave authority to visit public-houses on the Sunday. The innkeeper who\r\nshall refuse them admittance shall be fined forty shillings for such\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\"The tithing-men are to stop travellers, and to require of them their\r\nreason for being on the road on Sunday: any one refusing to answer shall\r\nbe sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five pounds sterling. If\r\nthe reason given by the traveller be not deemed by the tithing-men\r\nsufficient, he may bring the traveller before the justice of the\r\npeace of the district.\" (_Law of the 8th March, 1792: General Laws of\r\nMassachusetts_, vol. i., p. 410.)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th March, 1797, a new law increased the amount of fines, half\r\nof which was to be given to the informer. (_Same collection_, vol. ii.,\r\np. 525.)\r\n\r\nOn the 16th February, 1816, a new law confirmed these measures. (_Same\r\ncollection_, vol. ii., p. 405.)\r\n\r\nSimilar enactments exist in the laws of the state of New York, revised\r\nin 1827 and 1828. (See _Revised Statutes_, part i., chapter 20, p. 675.)\r\nIn these it is declared that no one is allowed on the sabbath to sport,\r\nto fish, play at games, or to frequent houses where liquor is sold. _No\r\none_ can travel except in case of necessity.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not the only trace which the religious strictness and\r\naustere manners of the first emigrants have left behind them in the\r\nAmerican laws.\r\n\r\nIn the revised statutes of the state of New York, vol. i., p. 662, is\r\nthe following clause:--\r\n\r\n\"Whoever shall win or lose in the space of twenty-four hours, by gaming\r\nor betting, the sum of twenty-five dollars, shall be found guilty of\r\na misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be condemned to pay a fine\r\nequal to at least five times the value of the sum lost or won; which\r\nwill be paid to the inspector of the poor of the township. He that loses\r\ntwenty-five dollars or more, may bring an action to recover them; and\r\nif he neglects to do so, the inspector of the poor may prosecute the\r\nwinner, and oblige him to pay into the poor box both the sum he has\r\ngained and three times as much beside.\"\r\n\r\nThe laws we quote from are of recent date; but they are unintelligible\r\nwithout going back to the very origin of the colonies. I have no doubt\r\nthat in our days the penal part of these laws is very rarely applied.\r\nLaws preserve their inflexibility long after the manners of a nation\r\nhave yielded to the influence of time. It is still true, however, that\r\nnothing strikes a foreigner on his arrival in America more forcibly than\r\nthe regard to the sabbath.\r\n\r\nThere is one, in particular, of the large American cities, in which all\r\nsocial movements begin to be suspended even on Saturday evening. You\r\ntraverse its streets at the hour at which you expect men in the middle\r\nof life to be engaged in business, and young people in pleasure; and you\r\nmeet with solitude and silence. Not only have all ceased to work, but\r\nthey appear to have ceased to exist. Neither the movements of industry\r\nare heard, nor the accents of joy, nor even the confused murmur which\r\narises from the midst of a great city. Chains are hung across the\r\nstreets in the neighborhood of the churches; the half closed shutters\r\nof the houses scarcely admit a ray of sun into the dwellings of the\r\ncitizens. Now and then you perceive a solitary individual, who glides\r\nsilently along the deserted streets and lanes.\r\n\r\nNext day, at early dawn, the rolling of carriages, the noise of hammers,\r\nthe cries of the population, begin to make themselves heard again. The\r\ncity is awake. An eager crowd hastens toward the resort of commerce\r\nand industry; everything around you bespeaks motion, bustle, hurry. A\r\nfeverish activity succeeds to the lethargic stupor of yesterday: you\r\nmight almost suppose that they had but one day to acquire wealth and to\r\nenjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.--Page 41.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary for me to say, that in the chapter which has just been\r\nread, I have not had the intention of giving a history of America. My\r\nonly object was to enable the reader to appreciate the influence which\r\nthe opinions and manners of the first emigrants had exercised upon\r\nthe fate of the different colonies and of the Union in general. I have\r\ntherefore confined myself to the quotation of a few detached fragments.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I am deceived, but it appears to me that by\r\npursuing the path which I have merely pointed out, it would be easy to\r\npresent such pictures of the American republics as would not be unworthy\r\nthe attention of the public, and could not fail to suggest to the\r\nstatesman matter for reflection.\r\n\r\nNot being able to devote myself to this labor, I am anxious to render\r\nit easy to others; and for this purpose, I subjoin a short catalogue and\r\nanalysis of the works which seem to me the most important to consult.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the general documents, which it would be advantageous\r\nto examine, I place the work entitled An Historical Collection of State\r\nPapers, and other authentic Documents, intended as Materials for a\r\nHistory of the United States of America, by Ebenezer Hasard. The first\r\nvolume of this compilation, which was printed at Philadelphia in 1792,\r\ncontains a literal copy of all the charters granted by the crown of\r\nEngland to the emigrants, as well as the principal acts of the colonial\r\ngovernments, during the commencement of their existence. Among other\r\nauthentic documents, we here find a great many relating to the affairs\r\nof New England and Virginia during this period. The second volume is\r\nalmost entirely devoted to the acts of the confederation of 1643. This\r\nfederal compact, which was entered into by the colonies of New England\r\nwith the view of resisting the Indians, was the first instance of\r\nunion afforded by the Anglo-Americans. There were besides many other\r\nconfederations of the same nature, before the famous one of 1776, which\r\nbrought about the independence of the colonies.\r\n\r\nEach colony has, besides, its own historic monuments, some of which are\r\nextremely curious; beginning with Virginia, the state which was first\r\npeopled. The earliest historian of Virginia was its founder, Capt. John\r\nSmith. Capt. Smith has left us an octavo volume, entitled, The generall\r\nHistoric of Virginia and New England, by Captain John Smith, sometymes\r\nGovernour in those Countryes, and Admirall of New England; printed at\r\nLondon in 1627. The work is adorned with curious maps and engravings of\r\nthe time when it appeared; the narrative extends from the year 1584 to\r\n1626. Smith's work is highly and deservedly esteemed. The author was one\r\nof the most celebrated adventurers of a period of remarkable adventure;\r\nhis book breathes that ardor for discovery, that spirit of enterprise\r\nwhich characterized the men of his time, when the manners of chivalry\r\nwere united to zeal for commerce, and made subservient to the\r\nacquisition of wealth.\r\n\r\nBut Capt. Smith is remarkable for uniting, to the virtues which\r\ncharacterized his contemporaries, several qualities to which they were\r\ngenerally strangers: his style is simple and concise, his narratives\r\nbear the stamp of truth, and his descriptions are free from false\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nThis author throws most valuable light upon the state and condition of\r\nthe Indians at the time when North America was first discovered.\r\n\r\nThe second historian to consult is Beverley, who commences his narrative\r\nwith the year 1595, and ends it with 1700. The first part of his book\r\ncontains historical documents, properly so called, relative to the\r\ninfancy of the colonies. The second affords a most curious picture of\r\nthe Indians at this remote period. The third conveys very clear ideas\r\nconcerning the manners, social condition, laws, and political customs of\r\nthe Virginians in the author's lifetime.\r\n\r\nBeverley was a native of Virginia, which occasions him to say at the\r\nbeginning of his book that he entreats his readers not to exercise their\r\ncritical severity upon it, since, having been born in the Indies, he\r\ndoes not aspire to purity of language. Notwithstanding this colonial\r\nmodesty, the author shows throughout his book the impatience with which\r\nhe endures the supremacy of the mother-country. In this work of Beverley\r\nare also found numerous traces of that spirit of civil liberty which\r\nanimated the English colonies of America at the time when he wrote. He\r\nalso shows the dissensions which existed among them and retarded their\r\nindependence. Beverley detests his catholic neighbors of Maryland, even\r\nmore than he hates the English government; his style is simple, his\r\nnarrative interesting and apparently trustworthy.\r\n\r\nI saw in America another work which ought to be consulted, entitled, The\r\n_History of Virginia_, by William Stith. This book affords some curious\r\ndetails, but _I_ thought it long and diffuse.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient as well as the best document to be consulted on the\r\nhistory of Carolina is a work in a small quarto, entitled, The History\r\nof Carolina, by John Lawson, printed at London in 1718. This work\r\ncontains, in the first part, a journey of discovery in the west of\r\nCarolina; the account of which, given in the form of a journal, is\r\nin general confused and superficial; but it contains a very striking\r\ndescription of the mortality caused among the savages of that time, both\r\nby the small-pox and the immoderate use of brandy; and with a curious\r\npicture of the corruption of manners prevalent among them, which was\r\nincreased by the presence of Europeans. The second part of Lawson's book\r\nis taken up with a description of the physical condition of Carolina,\r\nand its productions. In the third part, the author gives an interesting\r\naccount of the manners, customs, and government of the Indians at that\r\nperiod. There is a good deal of talent and originality in this part of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nLawson concludes his history with a copy of the charter granted to the\r\nCarolinas in the reign of Charles II. The general tone of this work is\r\nlight, and often licentious, forming a perfect contrast to the solemn\r\nstyle of the works published at the same period in New England. Lawson's\r\nhistory is extremely scarce in America, and cannot be procured in\r\nEurope. There is, however, a copy of it in the royal library at Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom the southern extremity of the United States I pass at once to the\r\nnorthern limit; as the intermediate space was not peopled till a later\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nI must first point out a very curious compilation, entitled, Collection\r\nof the Massachusetts Historical Society, printed for the first time at\r\nBoston in 1792, and reprinted in 1806. The collection of which I speak,\r\nand which is continued to the present day, contains a great number of\r\nvery valuable documents relating to the history of the different states\r\nof New England. Among them are letters which have never been published,\r\nand authentic pieces which have been buried in provincial archives. The\r\nwhole work of Gookin concerning the Indians is inserted there.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned several times, in the chapter to which this note\r\nrelates, the work of Nathaniel Norton, entitled New England's Memorial;\r\nsufficiently perhaps to prove that it deserves the attention of those\r\nwho would be conversant with the history of New England. This book is in\r\n8vo. and was reprinted at Boston in 1826.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable and important authority which exists upon the history\r\nof New England is the work of the Rev. Cotton Mather, entitled Magnalia\r\nChristi Americana, or the Ecclesiastical History of New England,\r\n1620-1698, 2 vols. 8vo, reprinted at Hartford, United States, in 1820.\r\n(A folio edition of this work was published in London in 1702.) The\r\nauthor divided his work into seven books. The first presents the history\r\nof the events which prepared and brought about the establishment of New\r\nEngland. The second contains the lives of the first governors and chief\r\nmagistrates who presided over the country. The third is devoted to the\r\nlives and labors of the evangelical ministers who during the same period\r\nhad the care of souls. In the fourth the author relates the institution\r\nand progress of the University of Cambridge (Massachusetts). In the\r\nfifth he describes the principles and the discipline of the Church of\r\nNew England. The sixth is taken up in retracing certain facts, which, in\r\nthe opinion of Mather, prove the merciful interposition of Providence\r\nin behalf of the inhabitants of New England. Lastly, in the seventh, the\r\nauthor gives an account of the heresies and the troubles to which the\r\nChurch of New England was exposed. Cotton Mather was an evangelical\r\nminister who was born at Boston, and passed his life there. His\r\nnarratives are distinguished by the same ardor and religious zeal which\r\nled to the foundation of the colonies of New England. Traces of bad\r\ntaste sometimes occur in his manner of writing; but he interests,\r\nbecause he is full of enthusiasm. He is often intolerant, still oftener\r\ncredulous, but he never betrays an intention to deceive. Sometimes his\r\nbook contains fine passages, and true and profound reflections, such as\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"Before the arrival of the Puritans,\" says he (vol. i., chap, iv.),\r\n\"there were more than a few attempts of the English to people and\r\nimprove the parts of New England which were to the northward of New\r\nPlymouth; but the design of those attempts being aimed no higher\r\nthan the advancement of some worldly interests, a constant series of\r\ndisasters has confounded them, until there was a plantation erected upon\r\nthe nobler designs of Christianity: and that plantation, though it\r\nhas had more adversaries than perhaps any one upon earth, yet, having\r\nobtained help from God, it continues to this day.\"\r\n\r\nMather occasionally relieves the austerity of his descriptions with\r\nimages full of tender feeling: after having spoken of an English lady\r\nwhose religious ardor had brought her to America with her husband, and\r\nwho soon after sank under the fatigues and privations of exile, he adds,\r\n\"As for her virtuous husband, Isaac Johnson,\r\n\r\n  \"He tried\r\n  To live without her, liked it not, and died.\"--(Vol. i.)\r\n\r\nMather's work gives an admirable picture of the time and country which\r\nhe describes. In his account of the motives which led the puritans to\r\nseek an asylum beyond seas, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"The God of heaven served, as it were, a summons upon the spirits of his\r\npeople in the English nation, stirring up the spirits of thousands which\r\nnever saw the faces of each other, with a most unanimous inclination to\r\nleave the pleasant accommodations of their native country, and go over\r\na terrible ocean, into a more terrible desert, for the pure enjoyment\r\nof all his ordinances. It is now reasonable that, before we pass any\r\nfarther, the reasons of this undertaking should be more exactly made\r\nknown unto posterity, especially unto the posterity of those that were\r\nthe undertakers, lest they come at length to forget and neglect the true\r\ninterest of New England. Wherefore I shall now transcribe some of them\r\nfrom a manuscript wherein they were then tendered unto consideration.\r\n\r\n\"_General Considerations for the Plantation of New England_.\r\n\r\n\"First, it will be a service unto the church of great consequence, to\r\ncarry the gospel unto those parts of the world, and raise a bulwark\r\nagainst the kingdom of antichrist, which the Jesuits labor to rear up in\r\nall parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, all other churches of Europe have been brought under\r\ndesolations; and it may be feared that the like judgments are coming\r\nupon us; and who knows but God hath provided this place to be a refuge\r\nfor many whom he means to save out of the general destruction!\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, the land grows weary of her inhabitants, inasmuch that man,\r\nwhich is the most precious of all creatures, is here more vile and\r\nbase than the earth he treads upon; children, neighbors, and friends,\r\nespecially the poor, are counted the greatest burdens, which, if things\r\nwere right, would be the chiefest of earthly blessings.\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, we are grown to that intemperance in all excess of riot, as\r\nno mean estate almost will suffice a man to keep sail with his equals,\r\nand he that fails in it must live in scorn and contempt; hence it comes\r\nto pass, that all arts and trades are carried in that deceitful manner\r\nand unrighteous course, as it is almost impossible for a good upright\r\nman to maintain his constant charge and live comfortably in them.\r\n\r\n\"Fifthly, the schools of learning and religion are so corrupted, as\r\n(beside the unsupportable charge of education) most children, even the\r\nbest, wittiest, and of the fairest hopes, are prevented, corrupted,\r\nand utterly overthrown by the multitude of evil examples and licentious\r\nbehaviors in these seminaries.\r\n\r\n\"Sixthly, the whole earth is the Lord's garden, and he hath given it to\r\nthe sons of Adam, to be tilled and improved by them: why then should\r\nwe stand starving here for places of habitation, and in the mean time\r\nsuffer whole countries, as profitable for the use of man, to lie waste\r\nwithout any improvement?\r\n\r\n\"Seventhly, what can be a better or a nobler work, and more worthy of a\r\nChristian, than to erect and support a reformed particular church in its\r\ninfancy, and unite our forces with such a company of faithful people, as\r\nby timely assistance may grow stronger and prosper; but for want of it,\r\nmay be put to great hazards, if not be wholly ruined.\r\n\r\n\"Eighthly, if any such as are known to be godly, and live in wealth\r\nand prosperity here, shall forsake all this to join with this reformed\r\nchurch, and with it run the hazard of a hard and mean condition, it will\r\nbe an example of great use, both for the removing of scandal, and to\r\ngive more life unto the faith of God's people in their prayers for the\r\nplantation, and also to encourage others to join the more willingly in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on, when he declares the principles of the church of New England\r\nwith respect to morals, Mather inveighs with violence against the\r\ncustom of drinking healths at table, which he denounces as a pagan and\r\nabominable practice. He proscribes with the same rigor all ornaments for\r\nthe hair used by the female sex, as well as their custom of having the\r\narms and neck uncovered.\r\n\r\nIn another part of his work he relates several instances of witchcraft\r\nwhich had alarmed New England. It is plain that the visible action of\r\nthe devil in the affairs of this world appeared to him an incontestible\r\nand evident fact.\r\n\r\nThis work of Cotton Mather displays in many places, the spirit of civil\r\nliberty and political independence which characterized the times in\r\nwhich he lived. Their principles respecting government are discoverable\r\nat every page. Thus, for instance, the inhabitants of Massachusetts, in\r\nthe year 1630, ten years after the foundation of Plymouth, are found to\r\nhave devoted 400_l_. sterling to the establishment of the University of\r\nCambridge. In passing from the general documents relative to the history\r\nof New England, to those which describe the several states comprised\r\nwithin its limits, I ought first to notice The History of the Colony of\r\nMassachusetts, by Hutchinson, Lieutenant-Governor of the Massachusetts\r\nProvince, 2 vols., 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe history of Hutchinson, which I have several times quoted in the\r\nchapter to which this note relates, commences in the year 1628 and ends\r\nin 1750. Throughout the work there is a striking air of truth and the\r\ngreatest simplicity of style; it is full of minute details.\r\n\r\nThe best history to consult concerning Connecticut is that of Benjamin\r\nTrumbull, entitled, A Complete History of Connecticut, Civil and\r\nEcclesiastical, 1630-1764; 2 vols., 8vo., printed in 1818, at New Haven.\r\nThis history contains a clear and calm account of all the events which\r\nhappened in Connecticut during the period given in the title. The author\r\ndrew from the best sources; and his narrative bears the stamp of truth.\r\nAll that he says of the early days of Connecticut is extremely curious.\r\nSee especially the constitution of 1639, vol. i., ch. vi., p. 100; and\r\nalso the penal laws of Connecticut, vol. i., ch. vii., p. 123.\r\n\r\nThe History of New Hampshire, by Jeremy Belknap, is a work held in\r\nmerited estimation. It was printed at Boston in 1792, in 2 vols.,\r\n8vo. The third chapter of the first volume is particularly worthy of\r\nattention for the valuable details it affords on the political and\r\nreligious principles of the puritans, on the causes of their emigration,\r\nand on their laws. The following curious quotation is given from a\r\nsermon delivered in 1663: \"It concerneth New England always to remember\r\nthat they are a plantation religious, not a plantation of trade. The\r\nprofession of the purity of doctrine, worship, and discipline, is\r\nwritten on her forehead. Let merchants, and such as are increasing cent\r\nper cent, remember this, that worldly gain was not the end and design\r\nof the people of New England, but religion. And if any man among us make\r\nreligion as twelve, and the world as thirteen, such an one hath not the\r\ntrue spirit of a true New Englishman.\" The reader of Belknap will find\r\nin his work more general ideas, and more strength of thought, than are\r\nto be met with in the American historians even to the present day.\r\n\r\nAmong the central states which deserve our attention for their remote\r\norigin, New York and Pennsylvania are the foremost. The best history we\r\nhave of the former is entitled A History of New York, by William Smith,\r\nprinted in London in 1757. Smith gives us important details of the wars\r\nbetween the French and English in America. His is the best account of\r\nthe famous confederation of the Iroquois.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Pennsylvania, I cannot do better than point out the\r\nwork of Proud, entitled the History of Pennsylvania, from the original\r\nInstitution and Settlement of that Province, under the first Proprietor\r\nand Governor, William Penn, in 1681, till after the year 1742; by Robert\r\nProud; 2 vols., 8vo., printed at Philadelphia in 1797. This work is\r\ndeserving of the especial attention of the reader; it contains a mass of\r\ncurious documents concerning Penn, the doctrine of the Quakers, and\r\nthe character, manners, and customs of the first inhabitants of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX G.--Page 48.\r\n\r\nWe read in Jefferson's Memoirs as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"At the time of the first settlement of the English in Virginia, when\r\nland was had for little or nothing, some provident persons having\r\nobtained large grants of it, and being desirous of maintaining\r\nthe splendor of their families, entailed their property upon their\r\ndescendants. The transmission of these estates from generation to\r\ngeneration, to men who bore the same name, had the effect of raising up\r\na distinct class of families, who, possessing by law the privilege of\r\nperpetuating their wealth, formed by these means a sort of patrician\r\norder, distinguished by the grandeur and luxury of their establishments.\r\nFrom this order it was that the king usually chose his counsellor of\r\nstate.\" (This passage is extracted and translated from M. Conseil's\r\nwork upon the Life of Jefferson, entitled, \"_Mélanges Politiques et\r\nPhilosophiques de Jefferson_.\")\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the principal clauses of the English law\r\nrespecting descent have been universally rejected. The first rule that\r\nwe follow, says Mr. Kent, touching inheritance, is the following: If a\r\nman dies intestate, his property goes to his heirs in a direct line.\r\nIf he has but one heir or heiress, he or she succeeds to the whole. If\r\nthere are several heirs of the same degree, they divide the inheritance\r\nequally among them, without distinction of sex.\r\n\r\nThis rule was prescribed for the first time in the state of New York\r\nby a statute of the 23d of February, 1786. (See Revised Statutes, vol.\r\niii., Appendix, p. 48.) It has since then been adopted in the revised\r\nstatutes of the same state. At the present day this law holds good\r\nthroughout the whole of the United States, with the exception of the\r\nstate of Vermont, where the male heir inherits a double portion: Kent's\r\nCommentaries, vol. iv., p. 370. Mr. Kent, in the same work, vol. iv., p.\r\n1-22, gives an historical account of American legislation on the subject\r\nof entail; by this we learn that previous to the revolution the colonies\r\nfollowed the English law of entail. Estates tail were abolished in\r\nVirginia in 1776, on a motion of Mr. Jefferson. They were suppressed\r\nin New York in 1786; and have since been abolished in North Carolina,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri. In Vermont, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, South Carolina, and Louisiana, entail was never introduced.\r\nThose States which thought proper to preserve the English law of entail,\r\nmodified it in such a way as to deprive it of its most aristocratic\r\ntendencies. \"Our general principles on the subject of government,\" says\r\nMr. Kent, \"tend to favor the free circulation of property.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot fail to strike the French reader who studies the law\r\nof inheritance, that on these questions the French legislation is\r\ninfinitely more democratic even than the American.\r\n\r\nThe American law makes an equal division of the father's property, but\r\nonly in the case of his will not being known; \"for every man,\" says the\r\nlaw, \"in the state of New York (Revised Statutes, vol. iii., Appendix,\r\np. 51), has entire liberty, power, and authority, to dispose of his\r\nproperty by will, to leave it entire, or divided in favor of any persons\r\nhe chooses as his heirs, provided he do not leave it to a political body\r\nor any corporation.\" The French law obliges the testator to divide his\r\nproperty equally, or nearly so, among his heirs.\r\n\r\nMost of the American republics still admit of entails, under certain\r\nrestrictions; but the French law prohibits entail in all cases.\r\n\r\nIf the social condition of the Americans is more democratic than that of\r\nthe French, the laws of the latter are the most democratic of the two.\r\nThis may be explained more easily than at first appears to be the case.\r\nIn France, democracy is still occupied in the work of destruction; in\r\nAmerica it reigns quietly over the ruins it has made.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX H.--Page 55.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF VOTERS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nAll the states agree in granting the right of voting at the age of\r\ntwenty-one. In all of them it is necessary to have resided for a certain\r\ntime in the district where the vote is given. This period varies from\r\nthree months to two years.\r\n\r\nAs to the qualification; in the state of Massachusetts it is necessary\r\nto have an income of three pounds sterling or a capital of sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island a man must possess landed property to the amount of 133\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut he must have a property which gives an income of\r\nseventeen dollars. A year of service in the militia also gives the\r\nelective privilege.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey, an elector must have a property of fifty pounds a year.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina and Maryland, the elector must possess fifty acres of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn Tennessee, he must possess some property.\r\n\r\nIn the states of Mississippi, Ohio, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, New York, the only necessary qualification for voting is that\r\nof paying the taxes; and in most of the states, to serve in the militia\r\nis equivalent to the payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nIn Maine and New Hampshire any man can vote who is not on the pauper\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the states of Missouri, Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana,\r\nIndiana, Kentucky, and Vermont, the conditions of voting have no\r\nreference to the property of the elector.\r\n\r\nI believe there is no other state beside that of North Carolina in which\r\ndifferent conditions are applied to the voting for the senate and the\r\nelecting the house of representatives. The electors of the former, in\r\nthis case, should possess in property fifty acres of land; to vote for\r\nthe latter, nothing more is required than to pay taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.--Page 92.\r\n\r\nThe small number of custom-house officers employed in the United States\r\ncompared with the extent of the coast renders smuggling very easy;\r\nnotwithstanding which it is less practised than elsewhere, because\r\neverybody endeavors to suppress it. In America there is no police for\r\nthe prevention of fires, and such accidents are more frequent than in\r\nEurope, but in general they are more speedily extinguished, because the\r\nsurrounding population is prompt in lending assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K--Page 94.\r\n\r\nIt is incorrect to assert that centralization was produced by the French\r\nrevolution: the revolution brought it to perfection, but did not create\r\nit. The mania for centralization and government regulations dates from\r\nthe time when jurists began to take a share in the government, in the\r\ntime of Philippe-le-Bel; ever since which period they have been on the\r\nincrease. In the year 1775, M. de Malesherbes, speaking in the name\r\nof the Cour des Aides, said to Louis XIV. (see \"Mèmoires pour servir à\r\nl'Histoire du Droit Public de la France eft matiere d'lmpots,\" p. 654,\r\nprinted at Brussels in 1779):\r\n\r\n\"Every corporation and every community of citizens retained the right of\r\nadministering its own affairs; a right which not only forms part of the\r\nprimitive constitution of the kingdom, but has a still higher origin;\r\nfor it is the right of nature and of reason. Nevertheless, your\r\nsubjects, sire, have been deprived of it; and we cannot refrain from\r\nsaying that in this respect your government has fallen into puerile\r\nextremes. From the time when powerful ministers made it a political\r\nprinciple to prevent the convocation of a national assembly, one\r\nconsequence has succeeded another, until the deliberations of the\r\ninhabitants of a village are declared null when they have not been\r\nauthorized by the intendant. Of course, if the community have an\r\nexpensive undertaking to carry through, it must remain under the control\r\nof the sub-delegate of the intendant, and consequently follow the plan\r\nhe proposes, employ his favorite workmen, pay them according to his\r\npleasure; and if an action at law is deemed necessary, the intendant's\r\npermission must be obtained. The cause must be pleaded before this first\r\ntribunal, previous to its being carried into a public court; and if the\r\nopinion of the intendant is opposed to that of the inhabitants, or if\r\ntheir adversary enjoys his favor, the community is deprived of the\r\npower of defending its rights. Such are the means, sire, which have been\r\nexerted to extinguish the municipal spirit in France; and to stifle, if\r\npossible, the opinions of the citizens. The nation may be said to lie\r\nunder an interdict, and to be in wardship under guardians.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could be said more to the purpose at the present day, when the\r\nrevolution has achieved what are called its victories in centralization?\r\n\r\nIn 1789, Jefferson wrote from Paris to one of his friends: \"There is no\r\ncountry where the mania for over-governing has taken deeper root than in\r\nFrance, or been the source of greater mischief.\" Letter to Madison, 28th\r\nAugust, 1789.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that for several centuries past the central power of France\r\nhas done everything it could to extend central administration; it has\r\nacknowledged no other limits than its own strength. The central power to\r\nwhich the revolution gave birth made more rapid advances than any of\r\nits predecessors, because it was stronger and wiser than they had been;\r\nLouis XIV. committed the welfare of such communities to the caprice\r\nof an intendant; Napoleon left them to that of the minister. The same\r\nprinciple governed both, though its consequences were more or less\r\nremote.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX L.--Page 97.\r\n\r\nThis immutability of the constitution of France is a necessary\r\nconsequence of the laws of that country.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the most important of all the laws, that which decides\r\nthe order of succession to the throne; what can be more immutable in its\r\nprinciple than a political order founded upon the natural succession of\r\nfather to son? In 1814 Louis XVIII. had established the perpetual law\r\nof hereditary succession in favor of his own family. The individuals\r\nwho regulated the consequences of the revolution of 1830 followed his\r\nexample; they merely established the perpetuity of the law in favor of\r\nanother family. In this respect they imitated the Chancellor Maurepas,\r\nwho, when he erected the new parliament upon the ruins of the old,\r\ntook care to declare in the same ordinance that the rights of the new\r\nmagistrates should be as inalienable as those of their predecessors had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nThe laws of 1830, like those of 1814, point out no way of changing the\r\nconstitution; and it is evident that the ordinary means of legislation\r\nare insufficient for this purpose. As the king, peers, and deputies, all\r\nderive their authority from the constitution, these three powers united\r\ncannot alter a law by virtue of which alone they govern. Out of the\r\npale of the constitution, they are nothing; where, then, could they take\r\ntheir stand to effect a change in its provisions? The alternative is\r\nclear; either their efforts are powerless against the charter, which\r\ncontinues to exist in spite of them, in which case they only reign in\r\nthe name of the charter; or, they succeed in changing the charter, and\r\nthen the law by which they existed being annulled, they themselves cease\r\nto exist. By destroying the charter, they destroy themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is much more evident in the laws of 1830 than in those of 1814.\r\nIn 1814, the royal prerogative took its stand above and beyond the\r\nconstitution; but in 1830, it was avowedly created by, and dependant on,\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nA part therefore of the French constitution is immutable, because it is\r\nunited to the destiny of a family; and the body of the constitution is\r\nequally immutable, because there appear to be no legal means of changing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are not applicable to England. That country having no\r\nwritten constitution, who can assert when its constitution is changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX M.--Page 97.\r\n\r\nThe most esteemed authors who have written upon the English constitution\r\nagree with each other in establishing the omnipotence of the parliament.\r\n\r\nDelolme says: \"It is a fundamental principle with the English lawyers,\r\nthat parliament can do everything except making a woman a man, or a man\r\na woman.\"\r\n\r\nBlackstone expresses himself more in detail if not more energetically\r\nthan Delolme, in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"The power and jurisdiction of parliament,\" says Sir Edward Coke (4\r\nInst. 36), \"is so transcendant and absolute, that it cannot be confined,\r\neither for causes or persons, within any bounds. And of this high\r\ncourt,\" he adds, \"may be truly said, 'Si antiquitatem spectes, est\r\nvetustissima; si dignitatem, est honoratissima; si jurisdictionem, est\r\ncapacissima.' It hath sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making,\r\nconfirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving and\r\nexpounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations;\r\necclesiastical or temporal; civil, military, maritime, or criminal; this\r\nbeing the place where that absolute despotic power which must, in all\r\ngovernments, reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these\r\nkingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that\r\ntranscend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach of this\r\nextraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new model the succession to\r\nthe crown; as was done in the reigns of Henry VIII. and William III. It\r\ncan alter the established religion of the land; as was done in a variety\r\nof instances in the reigns of King Henry VIII. and his three children.\r\nIt can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom,\r\nand of the parliaments themselves; as was done by the act of union and\r\nthe several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in\r\nshort, do everything that is not naturally impossible to be done; and,\r\ntherefore, some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather\r\ntoo bold, the omnipotence of parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX N.--Page 107.\r\n\r\nThere is no question upon which the American constitutions agree more\r\nfully than upon that of political jurisdiction. All the constitutions\r\nwhich take cognizance of this matter, give to the house of delegates the\r\nexclusive right of impeachment; excepting only the constitution of North\r\nCarolina which grants the same privilege to grand-juries. (Article 23.)\r\n\r\nAlmost all the constitutions give the exclusive right of pronouncing\r\nsentence to the senate, or to the assembly which occupies its place.\r\n\r\nThe only punishments which the political tribunals can inflict are\r\nremoval and interdiction of public functions for the future. There is\r\nno other constitution but that of Virginia (152), which enables them to\r\ninflict every kind of punishment.\r\n\r\nThe crimes which are subject to political jurisdiction, are, in the\r\nfederal constitution (section 4, art. 1); in that of Indiana (art. 3,\r\nparagraphs 23 and 24); of New York (art. 5); of Delaware (art. 5); high\r\ntreason, bribery, and other high crimes or offences.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of Massachusetts (chap. 1, section 2); that of\r\nNorth Carolina (art. 23); of Virginia (p. 252), misconduct and\r\nmal-administration.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of New Hampshire (p. 105) corruption, intrigue and\r\nmal-administration.\r\n\r\nIn Vermont (chap, ii., art 24), mal-administration.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina (art. 5); Kentucky (art. 5); Tennessee (art. 4); Ohio\r\n(art. 1, §23, 24); Louisiana (art. 5); Mississippi (art. 5); Alabama\r\n(art. 6); Pennsylvania (art. 4); crimes committed in the non-performance\r\nof official duties.\r\n\r\nIn the states of Illinois, Georgia, Maine, and Connecticut, no\r\nparticular offences are specified.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX O.--Page 171.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the powers of Europe may carry on maritime wars with\r\nthe Union; but there is always greater facility and less danger in\r\nsupporting a maritime than a continental war. Maritime warfare only\r\nrequires one species of effort. A commercial people which consents to\r\nfurnish its government with the necessary funds, is sure to possess a\r\nfleet. And it is far easier to induce a nation to part with its money,\r\nalmost unconsciously, than to reconcile it to sacrifices of men and\r\npersonal efforts. Moreover, defeat by sea rarely compromises the\r\nexistence or independence of the people which endures it.\r\n\r\nAs for continental wars, it is evident that the nations of Europe\r\ncannot be formidable in this way to the American Union. It would be\r\nvery difficult to transport and maintain in America more than 25,000\r\nsoldiers; an army which maybe considered to represent a nation of\r\n2,000,000 of men. The most populous nation of Europe contending in this\r\nway against the Union, is in the position of a nation of 2,000,000 of\r\ninhabitants at war with one of 12,000,000. Add to this, that America\r\nhas all its resources within reach, while the European is at 4,000 miles\r\ndistance from his; and that the immensity of the American continent\r\nwould of itself present an insurmountable obstacle to its conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX P.--Page 186.\r\n\r\nThe first American journal appeared in April, 1704, and was published at\r\nBoston. See collection of the Historical Society of Massachusetts, vol.\r\nvi., p. 66.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the periodical press has always\r\nbeen entirely free in the American colonies: an attempt was made to\r\nestablish something analogous to a censorship and preliminary security.\r\nConsult the Legislative Documents of Massachusetts of the 14th of\r\nJanuary, 1722.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed by the general assembly (the legislative body of\r\nthe province), for the purpose of examining into circumstances connected\r\nwith a paper entitled \"The New England Courier,\" expresses its opinion\r\nthat \"the tendency of the said journal is to turn religion into\r\nderision, and bring it into contempt; that it mentions the sacred\r\nwritings in a profane and irreligious manner; that it puts malicious\r\ninterpretations upon the conduct of the ministers of the gospel; and\r\nthat the government of his majesty is insulted, and the peace and\r\ntranquillity of the province disturbed by the said journal. The\r\ncommittee is consequently of opinion that the printer and publisher,\r\nJames Franklin, should be forbidden to print and publish the said\r\njournal or any other work in future, without having previously submitted\r\nit to the secretary of the province; and that the justices of the peace\r\nfor the county of Suffolk should be commissioned to require bail of the\r\nsaid James Franklin for his good conduct during the ensuing year.\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of the committee was adopted and passed into a law, but\r\nthe effect of it was null, for the journal eluded the prohibition by\r\nputting the name of Benjamin Franklin instead of James Franklin at\r\nthe bottom of its columns, and this manoeuvre was supported by public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX Q.--Page 287.\r\n\r\nThe federal constitution has introduced the jury into the tribunals of\r\nthe Union in the same way as the states had introduced it into their own\r\nseveral courts: but as it has not established any fixed rules for the\r\nchoice of jurors, the federal courts select them from the ordinary\r\njury-list which each state makes for itself. The laws of the states must\r\ntherefore be examined for the theory of the formation of juries.\r\nSee Story's Commentaries on the Constitution, B. iii., chap. 38, pp.\r\n654-659; Sergeant's Constitutional Law, p. 165. See also the federal\r\nlaws, of the years 1789, 1800, and 1802, upon the subject.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of thoroughly understanding the American principles with\r\nrespect to the formation of juries, I examined the laws of states at\r\na distance from one another, and the following observations were the\r\nresult of my inquiries.\r\n\r\nIn America all the citizens who exercise the elective franchise have the\r\nright of serving upon a jury. The great state of New York, however, has\r\nmade a slight difference between the two privileges, but in a spirit\r\ncontrary to that of the laws of France; for in the state of New York\r\nthere are fewer persons eligible as jurymen than there are electors. It\r\nmay be said in general that the right of forming part of a jury, like\r\nthat of electing representatives, is open to all the citizens; the\r\nexercise of this right, however, is not put indiscriminately into any\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nEvery year a body of municipal or county magistrates--called _selectmen_\r\nin New England, _supervisors_ in New York, _trustees_ in Ohio, and\r\n_sheriffs of the parish_ in Louisiana--choose for each county a certain\r\nnumber of citizens who have the right of serving as jurymen, and who we\r\nsupposed to be capable of exercising their functions. These magistrates,\r\nbeing themselves elective, excite no distrust: their powers, like those\r\nof most republican magistrates, are very extensive and very arbitrary,\r\nand they frequently make use of them to remove unworthy or incompetent\r\njurymen.\r\n\r\nThe names of the jurymen thus chosen are transmitted to the county\r\ncourt; and the jury who have to decide any affair are drawn by lot from\r\nthe whole list of names.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have contrived in every way to make the common people\r\neligible to the jury, and to render the service as little onerous as\r\npossible. The sessions are held in the chief town of every county; and\r\nthe jury are indemnified for their attendance either by the state or\r\nthe parties concerned. They receive in general a dollar per day, beside\r\ntheir travelling expenses. In America the being placed upon the jury is\r\nlooked upon as a burden, but it is a burden which is very supportable.\r\nSee Brevard's Digest of the Public Statute Law of South Carolina, vol.\r\ni, pp. 446 and 454, vol. ii., pp. 218 and 333; The General Laws of\r\nMassachusetts, revised and published by Authority of the Legislature,\r\nv. ii., pp. 187 and 331; The Revised Statutes of the State of New\r\nYork, vol. ii., pp. 411, 643, 717, 720; The Statute Law of the State of\r\nTennessee, vol. i., p. 209; Acts of the State of Ohio, pp. 95 and 210;\r\nand Digeste Genéral des Actes de la Législature de la Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX R.--Page 290.\r\n\r\nIf we attentively examine the constitution of the jury as introduced\r\ninto civil proceedings in England, we shall readily perceive that the\r\njurors are under the immediate control of the judge. It is true that the\r\nverdict of the jury, in civil as well as in criminal cases, comprises\r\nthe question of fact and the question of right in the same reply; thus,\r\na house is claimed by Peter as having been purchased by him: this is the\r\nfact to be decided. The defendant puts in a plea of incompetency on the\r\npart of the vendor: this is the legal question to be resolved.\r\n\r\nBut the jury do not enjoy the same character of infallibility in civil\r\ncases, according to the practice of the English courts, as they do in\r\ncriminal cases. The judge may refuse to receive the verdict; and even\r\nafter the first trial has taken place, a second or new trial may be\r\nawarded by the court.
